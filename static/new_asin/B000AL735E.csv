8078716,5,B000AL735E,"Rory's DVD lessons are all gifts. There are a handful of truly accomplished blues players, and she's in the top two or three. And of course she studied with several key early blues masters, including the mighty Son House. This double DVD set should be in every blues player's library. Don't be influenced by that oddball 2006 review. To be critical of Rory is to show your own ignorance. Man, she's good and this carefully structured lesson set is as good as the teacher.",1455840000,,471,4.619047619047619
8078717,5,B000AL735E,"FYI one of the reviewers complains Rory was supposed to be instructing Delta Blues, but started out by saying she was going to teach some Country Blues. ""Country Blues"" is a musical genre of which ""Delta Blues"" is one [of many] regional examples.

The comment was like complaining: ""she was supposed to be teaching us how to make a cherry pie but instead she started out by saying she was going to teach us about making pies"".

Country blues (also folk blues, rural blues, backwoods blues, or downhome blues) refers to all the acoustic, mainly guitar-driven forms of the blues. After blues' birth in the southern United States, it quickly spread throughout the country (and elsewhere), giving birth to a host of regional styles. These include Memphis, Detroit, Chicago, Texas, Piedmont, Louisiana, West Coast, Atlanta, St. Louis, East Coast, Swamp, New Orleans, Delta and Kansas City blues.

Relax enjoy and learn. You are in good hands with instructor Rory.",1308614400,3,964,5.0125
8078718,2,B000AL735E,"Whilst Rory Block is a great teacher her style is not to my liking sat all. The DVD says Delta Blues guitar - but as the DVD starts she even says its showing you how to play ""Coutry Blues""!

For me the country style conflicts with the original idea of what the delta sound is - I think its wrong to advertise this as so.

As a result I think it's a little misleading. Left me a little dissapointed in the choices of songs especially as some have been changed by her. There's also a rather dissapointing ballad ""The Water is Wide"" which does nothing to add to the ""extras"" on this disk. It's tacky!

For me Rory borders on the edge of shouting and bangs the guitar so hard it looks like she might do herself injury at some point. Her style - like her dress sense - is forced and I feel a little uncomfortable watching her play. She hammers through some songs at a terrific pace and I found this very off putting. The songs that she does play she teaches well (I watch a lot of training vids and women always make the best teachers - imho). If your a fan of hers you'll like this DVD but if you just want to learn Delta blues songs as performed by the original artists you'll be left feeling a little dissapointed.",1146441600,6,1212,4.170940170940171
