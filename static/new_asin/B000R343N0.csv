Over the years as I read the novel and watched all the movies I found that along with the Christopher Lee films that this is THE BEST of the Dracula stories. Louis Jourdan brings us a charming but completely evil Count who has lived so long that he has little or no human traits left and that makes him so much more scary. This is one of the best looking versions of the oft told tale and finally after all these years it comes to DVD. I'll be waiting by the mail box for this in Sept. and be in front of the T.V. Halloween night with this ready to watch as soon as the kids go to sleep.

2856943,5,B000R343N0,"FINALLY!!!

I cannot believe that we are FINALLY going to be able to own this unforgettable BBC series!!!

The BEST version of Dracula ever placed on film! I have wished for, and waited, it seems like forever, for a chance to be able to not only see this great ""film"" again, but to be able to have it on my shelves to watch over and over anytime I wish to.

I am a long-time horror film buff, and have seen so many Dracula films I cannot begin to even remember all of them, and THIS is the BEST ever! It closely follows the book, and it also has no ""fantastic"" [s...] added (as Hollywood is won't to do).

If you are a fan of Bram Stoker's fabled book, then this is, certainly, the Dracula movie for you, trust me. Bravo to Warner Brothers for bringing this great masterpiece film to our list of ""available"" choices for Dracula on film. This is truly a milestone movie!!! ~operabruin",1183680000,65,883,4.301204819277109
2856944,5,B000R343N0,"This is the Greatest adaptation, of Bram Stoker's Count Dracula! The acting is top notch, Louis Jourdan, Frank Finlay, Judy Bowker. The scenery of the film alone should get 5 stars, The eerie Highgate Cemetary in London is greatly used. I have been waiting for this TV Movie to come out on DVD for years!

This film would make Bram Stoker very happy.",1183593600,5,350,4.555555555555555
2856945,5,B000R343N0,"I still feel this is the best adaptation of the book ever done.  It remains as true to the original as possible (given the public's expectations of the gentleman vampire compared to Max Schreck's physically accurate performance in ""Nosferatu"").  What it lacks in sophisticated special effects it makes up for in imaginative use of what they had available to them.  Add to that wonderful performances all around - not just Jourdan.

Frank Finlay's Van Helsing is wonderful. With all due respect to Edward Van Slone, Finlay is the one I would want at my bedside protecting me from vampires.  He's charming, gentle, caring, eccentric...yet at the same fiercely determined and wise.  He's my favorite of all the Van Helsings to date.

Judy Bowker (Andromdeda in ""Clash of the Titans"") is finally given a chance to act and she rises to the occasion beautfully.  Susan Penhaligon is coquettish as Lucy rather than borderline slutty as some productions would have her.

They even appear to have hired an American actor to play an American character for once - a novelty for the BBC.

This production was the first thing I ever recorded on my first VCR (a Betamax!).  I bought a region 2 disc (and a multi-region player) when it was released in the UK.  This is a wonderful production and worth it at twice the price of this disc.",1182384000,23,1322,4.75
2856946,5,B000R343N0,"I first saw this version of ""Dracula"" on PBS back in the 70's (shortly after having read the novel) and thought it a wondererful (albeit a little stiff) and very faithful film adaptation of Bram Stoker's classic gothic novel.  Of course there have been hundreds of films featuring Count Dracula down through the ages but very few of them adhered closely to the orignal source material.  In fact most of them just borrowed a few key characters and maybe a plot thread or two and then just created their own story.  Thankfully the BBC decided to rectify matters by filming their own adaptation for television and this is the first film that I am aware of that really does stay true to the novel.  In fact this was the first film to show many of the famous scenes from the novel that previous films had ignored.  Namely the scenes of Dracula crawling down the castle walls and a very controversial (at the time) scene where the Count offers a baby to his three vampire brides.

Now keep in mind this is 70's era BBC televsision.  While the acting is quite good some of the other production values are not going to be of the same quality that many of today's viewing audiences are used to.  For example many of the exterior scenes are filmed outdoors while the interior scenes are filmed on sets.  Consequently there is going to be some sequences with a certain stagey quality to them.  Some of the special effects shots are going to be...well, lets just say not all that special.  Now having said all that I still can tell you that there are more chills to be had from this version than the BBC's most recent and very disapointing adaptation of ""Dracula"".  In fact, I'll go so far as to say that this version is even better than Coppola's ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"".  I never really cared for Coppola's version anyway but I will give it high marks for production values.  One of the big mistakes with Coppola's film was the changing of Dracula's character from Stoker's concept of evil vampire to that of a silly, romantic love-struck vampire.  Louis Jourdan (Gigi, Octopussy) does a fine job as the Count despite the fact that he is one of the few things in the film that doesn't quite mesh with Stoker's original concept.  He does however convey very well that strange dichotomy of vampires.  Namely the sensual yet evil qualities we've come to expect from many other screen Dracula's.

To sum up: this film may be cheap in the production values department but if you are looking for a version that is faithful to Stoker's original story, character and concepts then you are on the right track with this offering from 70's era BBC.  There's lots of atmosphere and plenty of good chills to be had from this version despite the shortcomings it may have.",1181260800,133,2747,4.592213114754099

2856965,1,B000R343N0,"Save yourself the time....or rather, don't waste yours on this production.

No doubt largely due to the relative age of the production, it is amateurish in the extreme!  Think 'Dark Shadows' then dial back a dozen points or more.

I think the most frustrating aspect that had me wanting to turn the thing off half way through, were the simplistic and often very poorly implemented 'effects' if they can even be called that.  The most laughable of these was when the 'host' started smoking even before Van Helsing pressed it to Mina's forehead.

I was so surprised by this that I had to repeat it a couple of times the make sure that it was not a flaw in my perception.  Indeed however, it was true and a reflection of the fact that there apparently was no post-production editing or critiquing...very, very sad.

The acting was typical for the BBC...kind of stiff and cut-out cardboard types.  Mr. Jourdan was poorly cast as the Count.

All in all...a waste of 150 minutes.",1434499200,,973,4.643274853801169

Count Dracula changes very little  to the story except there are a few characters, Arthur Holmwood,  who turns up missing and it seems Mina is related to Lucy which she not related to her as in the book. But besides that this adaptation is scary, creepy and wonderful to look at as the story seems very  real. The special effects are old school but the story is well told. Louis Jordan, who just recently passed away, is dominant and powerful in this film. He sees the perfect stalking vampire who besieges a family and tears up their lives.  Van Helsing is portrayed by Frank Finlay who underplays the role, he does not exaggerate his role of Vampire slayer. He is the wise seer who advises and helps Mina and Jonathan in facing the vampire.

The acting is still good, it is just that the newer vampire shows have so much more special effects, that this older version can seem sort of ""hokey"" at times.  Plus, I was disappointed with how little time there was of the title character ""Dracula"".!!  I have always liked the actor who had that role, Louis Jourdan (France:  born Louis Robert Gendre).  In this version,  he is the only ""Dracula"" or main vampire of a story who is barely seen.  BBC's budget for this movie must have been minuscule, with little left over after acquiring Mr. Jourdan: ( who may have had such a busy schedule  that that accounts for his rare appearance in the film).
Now, years after this was produced, the ""Dracula"" type movies/ TV series have sort of made it an out-dated film.  ""Buffy, the Vampire Slayer"" TV series set a very high standard for any other such production.
In this BBC production, it still does bother me when Dracula brings his consorts that cute, chubby little baby--but this was filmed so that it is not actually showing them feeding directly on it--thank goodness.  It is the implied occurrence  that still lets your mind fill-in the bad stuff.!!!  The times Dracula is getting ready to do his thing, I think they used the film negative for the ""scary"" part---not so successful now-a-days.

The ensemble cast is good and as with all the presentations of the Dracula novel, some of the characters presented in the book are merged into one (in this case, the Quincy Morris character has taken over Lord Holmwood's and Mina Murray has become Lucy Westenra's sister and not her best friend).  Frank Finlay stands out as Van Helsing.  The production speeds up toward the end.  It would have been a better production had it followed the novel and allotted more time to the tracking down of the Count.  In short, the BBC production is competent but not particularly inspired.

While not historical, the original book uses historical incidents and was well researched in vampire lore.

In the interest of not making the film too long they omitted the atmospheric chase by boat where Mina Harker can see and hear what Dracula is doing at sunset and sunrise.  I think an extra 5 minutes could have been used to evoke these scenes, but the original had to fit within the time constraints of a TV series.  While the special effects are primitive, the overall look and feel evokes Victorian England and Transylvania.  A number of scenes were shot on location.",1383350400,2,990,4.851190476190476

2856998,1,B000R343N0,"Disappointing film adaptation of one of my favorite novels: Dracula by Bram Stoker. Do not know why some here describes it as the most faithful movie version of the novel. It is not!

Add to that the horrible acting. Louis Jourdan an especially scary Count Dracula? He is as monotonous and one-dimensional as a soulless robot. A talking mannequin. Even the computer Hall 9000 had a much vivid personality than this Dracula.

And the terrible editing! If this is to be considered a horror movie it should be for its horrific editing. Most of the sets are equally horrifying in their cheapness.  The bad transfer to dvd do not help either. The film looks bland and even blurry sometimes. Like some other reviewers have stated, the movie constantly alternates between the look of a grainy television movie and the videotape-like look of soap-operas.

There are other reasons for disliking this movie, but all of them have been excellently commented by other reviewers.

And finally my last reason for my one star rating, which I cannot say better than RANDEL (BOYNTON BEACH, FL) did, so I am taking the liberty of quoting that reviewer:
 ""I also deeply resent the BBC's practice of forcing home-viewers to sit through endless promotional commercials for other BBC series before watching the film they paid to see. One is not allowed to skip the commercials nor to fast-forward through them. This kind of intrusive, strong-arm tactic is not advertising. It's bullying. Commercials and promotions should be available as a Menu Selection.""

Yep, five stars or four starts or three stars or even two stars my arse. Rent it if you can, but don't make the huge mistake I made: to buy it.",1383264000,2,1678,4.846153846153846
2856999,4,B000R343N0,"The BBC, as is typical, have done a really good job trying to be faithful to the original Bram Stoker Dracula novel. Minor quirks, such as Dracula being too young, w/o mustache, or combining 2 characters, are to be expected. Jourdan is chilling.

2857000,5,B000R343N0,"Bram Stoker's novel Dracula is a classic, if not a literary masterpiece, and the last 40-plus years of scholarship have revealed the great depth of meaning to be found in every aspect of the story. On top of that, the book has passages that can definitely evoke a thrill of horror, such as the brides' abortive vamping of Jonathan Harker and the climactic confrontation Van Helsing and his companions have with Lucy in the graveyard, along with the famous staking of Lucy. With all this to work with, you'd think that for all the times the novel has been adapted for the screen, someone would have stuck to the original story at least once. Yet producers have usually refused to give us a straight rendition of the novel, apparently convinced that their own visions of the story are superior to Stoker's. Usually they aren't.

Well, this is the exception. In fact it's THE version (as far as I'm aware the only one, including even 1922's Nosferatu) that really sticks to the original, keeping not just plot but character largely intact. Yes, there are a few modifications, but most of them are harmless. The biggest deviation is Louis Jourdan as the Count; he portrays a more urbane and seductive Dracula than the one depicted by Stoker, who is more of a physically imposing, flamboyant  (and older) alpha male. At first reading you could be forgiven for believing that this must make a huge difference. But given the fairly limited screen time for the Count (this, too, reflecting faithfulness to the original), the change isn't that big of a deal. (And Jourdan is far better at urbane and seductive than Frank Langella, which is all to the good).

The other modifications are inconsequential. Lucy and Mina are now sisters, but this has no impact at all on the telling of the story; it merely serves as a way to keep them together more of the time, since the screenplay doesn't need to rely on the novel's epistolary device. Arthur Holmwood and Quincey Morris are merged into a single character, but again, this has very little if any effect on the story. Arthur and Quincey being two most minor of the book's major characters, the merger makes sense and does little if any violence to the story line. If the movie had been a longer miniseries, it might have made a difference, but at 150 minutes it didn't.

One area in which this production really shines is in what it doesn't do. It avoids over-the-top melodrama (cf. the 1992 version and many others), approaching climactic moments with a cold, unadorned bluntness, letting the narrative speak for itself. When we see Dracula climbing down a wall, or Harker finds him lying in his tomb, such moments should (and do) speak for themselves, without big musical crescendos or overdone reaction shots from Harker. When the vampire brides attack the baby, the mere fact of what they're doing, along with the glimpse of the orgiastic expressions on their faces (mouths dripping with blood), needs (and is given) no elaboration. The direction and acting tell us all we need to know at such moments, and the producer hasn't insulted us by going for overkill.

Of course, there are shortcomings. As has been noted, the production is a cheap one, and the effects are horribly dated. Most of the characterization and acting is good, with special kudos to Frank Finlay as Van Helsing; while he may not be precisely as I imagine Van Helsing to be, he comes close, especially given that a lot of Van Helsing's expositions from the novel are absent. Susan Penhaligon is winsome as the human Lucy, but as vampire Lucy her attempt at seductiveness seems too forced and relies too much on over-the-top breathing and raspy voice. (On the other hand, her staking scene is just as bloodily erotic and violent as in the novel, and other productions could learn from it.) Also, while what we have is faithful, a lot has still been removed. Most of it deals with character development (especially Seward's and Mina's) rather than with plot, although there was a little skimping on the storyline involving the corruption and redemption of Mina. Likewise, Dracula's vamping of Lucy could have been given more extended treatment, although it is treated more fully than the Mina episode. Would that we had four hours instead of two and a half.

Of the few bad reviews here, many complain about how ""slow"" the story is. In fact, it is no slower than is the novel. In the book, things take a while to unfold; it's not a continual bloodbath. In that, as in other ways, the production is faithful to the original.

Could a better job be done today? Probably, and I hope that it will be. Until then, though, this production is quite satisfactory, especially for the purist. All in all, it's such a great thing to have a faithful adaptation that the production's flaws can easily be overlooked.",1382832000,2,4815,4.752392344497608

2857004,3,B000R343N0,"This is a 3.5 star review, for true aficionados probably a four-star production. I had remembered this BBC production of Count Dracula as very effective with Louis Jourdan as an especially scary Count Dracula. On replay I still find Jourdan's Count Dracula to be quite scary in his deliberate use of under play. What had seemed like a classic BBC use of minimal and inexpensive staging at least for the interior shots; on replay looks like the worst of the original sets in the old TV classic Dark Shadows.
This is a case of a production that was quite successful in BBC of 1977 terms; failing to maintain its effect in 2013. With all, Bram Stoker would have been very proud of this production. It is so close to the original one could almost follow it using the original text as a script.

The particular slant on this version is of a Gothic romance complete with the victims finding themselves in a sexual love hate relationship with their fanged master. This aspect should recommend this version is especially desirable to the crowd now following the concept of vampires as romantic and desirable. For all the new vampire romances out there one would think this version of Bram Stoker's original would be more in demand.

As is typical in BBC productions supporting actors and actresses provide capable workmanship. Unfortunately the overall effect of performance and scenes for me tended to be a flat. The scenes between Jack Shepherd as Renfield, Dracula's London contact, and of the original Dark Lord did not work well for me in 1977 and look a little cheesy in 2013. Frank Finley as the heroic Dr. Van Helsing is quite good but now not as convincing.

The ghostly scenes of the various Dracula women being alternately seductive and evil were fairly effective 40 years ago and now seem to symbolize all that is not quite right about this not quite right production.

For all that this version of Count Dracula is stilted and flat it is very true to the original. Allowing for its shortcomings it is worthy of a viewing if not a purchase. For anyone wondering what inspired the Gothic movement long before Gothic was cool (it is cool right?) Louis Jourdan makes the case that Dracula can be cool.",1376092800,3,2202,4.711688311688311

I bought this because I needed something in my cart to qualify for free shipping & the glowing reviews for this movie made it sound like it would be a great addition to my vampire movie collection.
NOT!!!! I watched it last night with my youngest son [I have Bram Stoker's Dracula, we have both read it], & we just stared in disbelief at the cheesy production value, horrid acting, & slow moving script, waiting for something to happen. We felt that the movie was incomplete [yet it dragged on -get to the point already], had cheap special effects, [except for the mists], & the most boring, insipid, messy eating vampire I've ever seen. No chemistry among the cast members.
As for being faithful to Bram Stoker's novel, hardly. Mina & Lucy were not sisters. So much of the novel's storytelling is missing.
Please, somebody stake me.
It is hard to find an excellent vampire movie. Too many are just tasteless ripoffs & inane adaptations within the vampire genre.
Nosferatu with Max Shreck [spelling?] is creepy good.
If you want a visually stunning vampire movie, Coppola's Bram Stoker's Dracula [ Gary Oldman, Winona Ryder, Keeanu Reeves, Anthony Hopkins] is excellent. Variation on Stoker's novel, but well done.
For a Lord Byron esqe vampire, Frank Langella's Dracula [1979] can't be beat. Incredible soundtrack. My favorite. Nothing anemic about Langella. Oh,my neck is so available.
Lost Boys [Keifer Sutherland, Jason Patric], takes a different direction in the genre. A more ""hip"" version of vampires & a great soundtrack. Another favorite.
But my little gem [which my youngest made fun of] but now it's ""our"" movie to watch during a snowstorm, is Roman Polanski's, Fearless Vampire Killers. We are always quoting dialogue from the movie. Sharon Tate is luminous on screen. The count's castle is beautiful. I'd live there.

2857017,2,B000R343N0,"I honestly don't know why this version of Dracula is so popular. People have tried to tell me that it is the most faithful version to Stoker's novel.  It's not.  It's really not.  First Arthur and Quincey are combined as one character, Lucy and Mina are turned into sisters and this is the most dispassionate, dull portrayal of Dracula ever.  It's dull. It's drawn out.  Being dry and academic does not automatically make it ""more faithful"".

The Gary Oldman version of Dracula, that is to say the movie directed by Francis Ford Coppola in 1992 IS the most faithful version of Dracula to date.  It adds a love story but it does not take away from the original story the way this one does.  Dracula is full of passionate emotions from range and menace to longing and even grief.  Yes, that version added a love story but in doing so it added reason and motivation for the character.  And other than what is added it is still the most faithful version, nothing is taken away.

This version of Dracula is over-rated.  I can't understand why so many people like it. I think it's one of those instances where you are told you should like something and so you do.  But I don't.  My mind won't work that way.  This version is dull and the Dracula is about as passionate as Mr. Spock from Star Trek.  That's not true to the novel at all.  The character was very emotion driven even when the emotion was just rage.  This was dull and dispassionate.  Stick with the 1992 movie starring Gary Oldman.

Watch the Coppola version without acknowledging the love story and every scene, every work every gesture and outburst is from the novel.  Watch the Louis Jordan version and you have a version of Dracula so reserved and repressed that he's more like Spock from Star Trek.  He's dispassionate and detached where he should be a very passionate, very angry and aggressive and easy to provoke character.  Quincey Morris and Arthur are combined into one character and Mina and Lucy are turned into siblings. Just because something is drier, more academic does not mean it is more faithful.

Coppola's version might have added a few things but unlike this one it did not take anything away from the story.",1339632000,5,2188,4.594315245478036

2857019,5,B000R343N0,"Count Dracula is my favorite of all of the versions of Dracula.  As already said it is the closest version to the book.  Louis Jordan gives Dracula a very sensual and aristocratic feel that a king of the vampires who has lived for hundreds of years should have.  I love the scenes where Jonathan Harker in the castle with Dracula's brides which includes the baby scene.  I love the special effects during these scenes, even though others have criticized them.  Frank Langella's Dracula copies some of them.  I love the book and this is the book.  Even though Christopher Lee is my favorite of all the Draculas because of his sheer presence, and fright factor, but many times Lee says little to nothing in his Dracula movies.  Louis Jordan speaks a lot and sounds like an aristocrat.  I also like the scene in the cemetery with Lucy (or is it Mina.  Yes it may feel a little too much like a play, but you can't have everything.  If you need a shorter version with more action see ""Horror of Dracula"".

Here are my comments on the main different versions of the Dracula novel.
Nosferatu 1922 - great, black & white, eerie, and silent; different than the book
Dracula 1931 - Bela Lugosi - slow by today's standards; but Lugosi is Dracula!  He created the stereotypical version role o  f what we think of as Dracula.  When ever  anyone ""plays"" like they are Dracula, they are playing Lugosi's Dracula.
Horror of Dracula 1958 - Hammer films first Dracula movie.  Lee is great with lots blood, power and action.
Count Dracula 1977 - Louis Jordan - my favorite version and the closest to the book
Dracula - 1979 - Frank Langella - based on his Broadway play version;  good but very different than the book
Nosferatu - 1979 - Werner Herzog's version with  Klaus Kinski playing ""Dracula"". Very spooky nice remake of the 1922 classic, but
  different than the Dracula book.  I like this version a lot because of Herzog and Kinski.
Bram Stoker's Dracula - 1992 Francis Ford Coppola's version - very nicely done, lots of interesting new twists, and special effects, but I

Even though Dracula is not one of my favorite novels, I find it a tad boring, I decided to buy this movie from the reviews.  I also really enjoy Masterpiece Theatre so I thought I couldn't go wrong.  Well, I was WRONG.  I understand this production is old, and possibly even innovative in it's time, but it is more than boring to watch.  Sitting through scene after scene of endless, partially nonsensical dialogue was like watching paint dry, if paint was a taped, second rate play with mediocre actors.  The musical score is ridiculous.  Typically 70's bad movie.  The loud chimes that seemed to cue the actors to the next scene was absurd.  There were scenes that didn't seem to have a purpose.  Like Mina talking to Renfield.  It just lay there like a beached whale.  The effect of the vampire teeth was actually pretty good, not too big or silly, until the actors lip got stuck on a fake tooth!  Now I'm just laughing.  And what's with the extra scene of Van Helsing and Dr Seward coming into the bedroom to thwart Dracula taking over Mina?  They burst in once without sound and stand there and stare.  Then they pan to Dracula and MIna and when they go back to the door the two men burst in again.  This time with sound.  Is there some interpretation thing here I'm not getting?  I'm pretty good with symbolism and this just looked like a bad scene cut badly.
Someone said in a review that Louis Jourdan, a Frenchman, worked somehow as a Transylvanian Dracula.  Perhaps because the Romanian language is a derivative of Latin as is French, and I don't necessarily think he was bad.  But he wasn't all that great either.  I think he played it stale because the direction was stale.

In the end I just don't understand all these great reviews.  But it may be as so many reviewers said, the most faithful of all the Dracula movies, and that proves my point about how incredibly boring that book is.  One tedious conversation after the other.  I've read dozens of vampire books.  Good ones and poor alike.  Long ones and short stories.  By women and men.  And I still don't understand why everyone goes on and on about this novel.

He both repels and attracts, just as Dracula should.  And the music -!  I had never gotten that eerie, pure, and perfect theme out of my head.  The BBC can be counted upon to respect English literature.  With Dracula, as with so many other masterpieces, they're pitch-perfect and never make the mistake of thinking they can create a better story than the guy who wrote the classic.

This version, made for BBC in the late 70s, actually follows the book closely. That said, it isn't very entertaining or imaginative. The production values (sets, photography) are inconsistent and quite dull. The worst part of all is Louis Jourdan's lackluster impersonation of the Count who comes across as neither passionate or menacing. The same goes for the supporting cast. A few scenes are well done, particularly the one with Dracula climbing down the castle wall (this was also done in the Francis Ford Coppola version) but for the most part, the effects and creativity are woefully lacking here.",1302566400,2,717,5.136752136752137
2857029,4,B000R343N0,"Ok, I have at last come to terms with the reality that no one is ever going to make a movie that follows the book.  I have read the novel at least 7 times, so I believe I am qualified to evaluate this video.  As other reviewers have said, this one follows the book more closely than any other movie made so far, but that's not saying much.  The fact that it does follow the book makes the changes they made stand out even more.  Mina and Lucy sisters!!?? What were they thinking!  Lucy engaged to Quincy and not Arthur (who was totally eliminated in the video!!)?? Unthinkable!  The wild west shoot out at the end of the movie instead of the exciting, nail-biting ending in the book!??  Disappointment squared!  Dracula causing a small hurricane when he decomposes??!!  Comical!

Also, worst bat ever!  They must have gotten it at Wal-Mart.  Worst Texas accent ever!  And the red screen thing?  Definitely made in the seventies.  You can tell by Jonathan's disco hair cut.

I think Dracula was portrayed as being more suave than he was in the book.  In the novel, he was much cruder and had a demoniac temper that flared several times.  When he is cornered in his secondary house, in the novel, he acts like a cornered animal and desperately escapes.  In the video, not so much.  I think this took away from the character quite a bit.

Ok, that's off my chest.  It did follow the book pretty well.  Judy Bowker as Mina was stunning.  And it follows the book better than any movie yet, so I'll cut it some slack.  After all the mean things I've said, I'm going with 4 stars probably would give 3 1/2, if possible).  Enjoy, but remember, it is a made-for-TV seventies movie, so keep that in mind.",1301788800,,1694,4.436482084690554
2857030,3,B000R343N0,"A lot of people put a huge importance on whether or not a movie is 100% faithful to the novel it's based on.  I can certainly understand that.  If you've read the novel, you really want the movie to be faithful to the novel.  Count Dracula - BBC miniseries (1977) is nearly 100% faithful to Bram Stoker's 1897 novel.  Great.  Does this make it a great movie?  Not necessarily.

This TV miniseries is 150 minutes, but the problem is that it's slow moving, dull, and rather boring.  It does have some eerie moments, some scary moments, and pretty good sound effects.  The musical score, however, is just fair at best and doesn't appear often enough throughout the movie, but that's OK, because the music just doesn't fit the type of movie this is, anyway - a Dracula movie.  The music sounds like it would fit right in with that old TV show called The Friendly Giant.  The music is very low volume, also.  There is way too much silence without music in this movie.  There are so many scenes that could use a heavy dose of dramatic music, but the music is either absent altogether or just wrong for the scene.  The movie struggles to maintain energy due to its length.  It loses steam, then things pick up again, then loses steam again.  It simply lacks power.  It lacks that much needed ""oomph"".

How are the sets and special effects?  They are on the cheap side, but this isn't something I really complain about.  In fact, I'm a fan of ""raw"" low tech stuff over CGI any day.  I'm just pointing this out as part of my overall review of this movie.  The castle footage is dark and haunting.  The night footage outdoors is creepy.  However, I found huge inconsistencies with how the movie was shot.  One minute it looks like a TV movie with grainy film, then the next minute it looks like a daytime soap opera shot with videotape.  This inconsistency in filming techniques was distracting.  Grainy picture, then clear picture, then back to grainy, then back to clear.  Weird.

The acting, in my opinion, is wooden for the most part.  The best acting came from Judi Bowker (of Clash Of The Titans fame).  Louis Jourdan's portrayal of Count Dracula was fair.  Nothing great.  He was too stoic, dull, and ordinary looking.

I recommend this movie only for people who insist that Dracula movies follow the novel faithfully.  If you don't mind if a Dracula movie doesn't follow the novel faithfully, then I recommend other movies, such as Horror Of Dracula (1958), Dracula (1979), and Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992).  These movies are shorter, maintain a higher intensity, and have great musical scores that liven things up.  Horror Of Dracula's musical score is by James Bernard.  Dracula 1979's musical score is by John Williams.  Bram Stoker's Dracula has a musical score by Wojciech Kilar.  Music can make all the difference in the world.",1299196800,3,2831,4.651821862348178
2857031,5,B000R343N0,"Of all the filmed adaptations of ""Dracula,"" this BBC mini-series is the most faithful - and arguably the best.

Bram Stoker's original novel is sweeping, sensual, ambitious ... and consequently difficult to film. Indeed, most movie and TV adaptations slash Stoker's material to pieces by omitting numerous characters, locations, and major events featured in the book. But this BBC production manages to pack in most of the characters and events from the novel, making it the most comprehensive filmed version to date.

And this mini-series has many other virtues, beyond fidelity to the source material. Louis Jourdan makes for a suave and menacing Dracula, and Frank Finlay is arguably the best Van Helsing ever - he's convincingly Dutch, at any rate, and he exudes the intelligence and compassion of the character from the novel. This production is also surprisingly creepy at times; the scenes involving Dracula's brides, in particular, managed to weird me out quite a bit.

On the downside, this is a 1970s BBC production, with many of the same production flaws that one expects to find in old episodes of Blackadder, Doctor Who, and Blakes' 7. To be more specific, the quality of the video footage is bad, the special effects are lame, and some of the sets are rather spartan. However, I'm very used to watching period BBC material, so these flaws don't detract too much from my enjoyment; and I assume that other veterans of BBC-watching will be similarly undisturbed by the cheese on display here.

In the final analysis, Stoker's book is better than all the filmed adaptations - but, by adhering closely to the author's material, this adaptation rises to the top of the pack. Every filmed version of Dracula, no matter how good, has major flaws: the Bela Lugosi film is arguably stodgy; Horror of Dracula is cheap and over-the-top; the Langella version omits the great material in Castle Dracula; and Coppola's version is a gaudy nightmare that subverts Stoker's worldview while claiming to be faithful. This BBC miniseries is flawed too, but not in serious ways. It's got the Hollywood adaptations beat, in my view. For fans of the novel, this is the one to watch.",1294790400,7,2173,4.961538461538462
2857032,4,B000R343N0,"There is something about this version more than any other done before that makes me believe that this was the best Dracula of all. I would say it is ""atmosphere"" and little details like a screen entry of women ""dancing"" as they are bitten by the count or the sudden screen shot of Jourdan's reaction to the blood running down the cheek of Johnathan Harker when he cuts himself shaving. Plus the casual way Jourdan flippantly removes the shaving mirror and tossing it out the window while claiming that they are not to be trusted.
  Subtle details like these plus the characteristic underplay by Jourdan make this more chilling than any Christopher Lee-Peter Cushing flick (although these men are legendary)and the scenes of stormy Bohemia are somewhat more believable than the horror intended aspects of ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" with Anthony Hopkins.
  It is also more ""religious"" than most, especially with regard to the Eucharist. Overall a very entertaining BBC mini-series from the 70s. It moves slower than modern productions, so I expect younger people will be impatient to what appears to be ""slow spots"" but you have to remember, things moved very slowly in the time when ""Dracula"" was written and this production attempts to tell the story from the perspective of the era it was written in. Very good and worth watching and comparing to others in a similar vein. (no pun intended)",1290988800,3,1388,4.918803418803419

The special effects are not as good as a Hollywood blockbuster, but to me, the ""hand made"" aspect of the film gives it characters. There are several scenes that have no music, but rather have the sound of the wind howling through the catacombs of the castle, and the wolves howling in the distance.

2857036,4,B000R343N0,"Bram Stoker's Dracula is a character created purely from his imagination.  I have been to Transylvania, and it is nothing like the way it is described in the book.  While Dracula is loosely based on 'Vlad the Impaler', the real 'Dracula' was not a vampire, and was revered, and not feared, by the Romanian people for defending the country in a bloody, but apparently effective, way.  The vampire legends are not native to the province, but derived from folk tales largely from Hungary [one can imagine the Magyars dreaming up all sorts of tall tales about the strange Latin race to their east].

Of all the video versions of Dracula that I have seen, this one is probably the closest to what Stoker imagined as he wrote the book.  It makes no attempt to achieve any verisimilitude in terms of the presumed eastern European origins of the legend.  It is rooted firmly in Victorian England.  It is effective in a low key way as a horror story, but even more so as a reflection of Victorian attitudes of that period.  It has been said that the novel is an interpretation of Victorian sexual repression.  Well, in this version there is plenty of that.  Parts of it are quite erotic by the standards of a BBC television production.

The only negative criticism I can offer about this version is that its obviously small budget did not allow for any elaborate special effects.  In that regard, it is sometimes rather 'cheesy'.  The scene where Dracula crawls down the wall of his castle is laughably inept.

The real strength of this version is the acting of Louis Jourdan.  I think he is my favorite Dracula ever.  He takes the role seriously, but never goes over the top with campy accents or lines.  He plays the role straight, which makes his Dracula far more disturbing to me than, for example, B&eacute;la Lugosi's.

So, I'd recommend this video to anyone who wants to experience the Dracula story the way Bram Stoker probably imagined it.",1282608000,2,1939,4.669616519174041

Today it would have simply been computer generated, spoiling the realism.

I always looked for films in the Hammer Studios type-produced horror films portraying Dracula as with Christopher Lee. But never had I seen a full length version devoted to the entire storey. Everything from the journey to and from England and Transylvania, was incredible to watch. Even the music scared me..lol.. Louis Jourdan played the best of all Dracula characters ever!!!

2857045,3,B000R343N0,"When I first saw this on PBS when I was a kid, I thought it was the best and scariest version up to that point. I just finished watching the 1931 Universal Pictures version, Hammer's Horror of Dracula, and this one over the last four days, and while I enjoyed each one, I've learned that comparing the adaptations is like comparing apples and oranges because none of the adaptations are very faithful.  This one is about as faithful as they come.

The plot itself is faithful.  The supporting characters are faithful.  Dracula is not.  Not that this is a bad thing.  Everyone who plays Dracula brings his own style, and Louis Jourdan does a great job of portraying the vampire.  Jourdan's Dracula is more human than other portrayals, but a monster nevertheless.  He shows less anger, more seduction than rape, and at one point asks to be understood, but not pitied.  He's not the Dracula of the novel, but that's okay, his performance is positive and memorable.  Jack Shepard plays Renfield, and I think he captures the essence of Renfield of the book, as does Frank Findlay, in his portrayal of Dr. Van Helsing.

So, Dracula, although Jourdan does not capture the novel character's essence, does a great job in bringing his own interpretation to the character.  Shepard and Findlay totally capture the essence of their characters.  The only major character changes are that Lucy and Mina are now sisters, and Arthur Holmwood and Quincy Morris are combined into one character.  These are not major changes that affect the storyline.

On a technical aspect, I can only fault it for some of the music. The opening score itself is great and moody, but there are several scenes which the music is light and airy to the point where I am reminded of the sitcom, ""Bewitched."" And this became really annoying as the movie moved forward.

So why only three stars?  Certainly my tastes have changed since I was a kid, and the scare factor this movie originally had on me is no longer there - and there is nothing else to make up for that. As faithful as an adaptation this is compared to the other versions, as much as I like Jourdan's take on Dracula, as much as I think Finlay and Shepard do justice to their characters, the film as a whole lacks personality.  And this is a problem caused by the history of Dracula on film.  In the book, the main characters are pretty equal in their part in destroying Dracula. In the movies, it's pretty much van Helsing vs Dracula.  This version follows the novel, and the mono en mono aspect is gone.

Louis Jourdan gives Count Dracula a polite but slightly upsetting manner.  He seems like a gentlemen yet also makes you want to keep him in front of you at all times.

This is really a very good version.  The special effects are a bit clunky, from the mid-1970s, but the drama is very solid.  Louis Jourdan is one of the best Draculas I have ever seen:  he exudes this calm charisma, at once aristocratic and sexy, but also menacingly evil.  His performance is worth the price of admission.  The scene where he bears his chest to Mina, tempting her to share his blood as a way to initiate her into his sisterhood of the undead, is truly frightening.

The other actors are a mixed bag.  Mina is also truly excellent, a strong innocent who is drawn into a danger that could last forever.  I completely believed her performance.  While Jonathan and van Helsing are quite good, as is Renfield, their performances are only middling.  Lucy, Mina's beloved sister, is not very good, in my view, but pretty minor.

Even though I know the story, I felt the fear and suspense to the very end.  That is good drama, fun to savor.  And it sticks to the original story, without adding silly variations for commercial purposes.

Warmly recommended.  This version is not as slick as, say, Coppola's, or as darkly horrible as Herzog's Nosferatu, but it succeeds far better than Christopher Lee's never-ending series.  The standard, of course, is Bela Lugosi, but objectively that may be only because I saw it on late night TV as a child with friends.

It might not be possible (or even desirable) to faithfully recreate Bram Stoker's ""Dracula"" on the silver screen; perhaps the novel simply doesn't lend itself well to the camera.  I like the way Jourdan plays Dracula -- with the imperturbable, suave, sang-froid of a man who has been groomed for power and handles it skillfully.  The historical Dracula was the Prince of Wallachia and he wanted his power, privilege, and prerogative to remain unchallenged forever.  Jourdan knew that Dracula feels that he DESERVES to win because he believes that he's RIGHT.  Dracula does not think of himself as evil: Those who commit the most/worst evil in this world have convinced themselves that they are good.  Van Helsing: I don't remember the actor's name because it was not a memorable performance.  NO ONE has got this character right yet.  Mina Harker: I could do without the Victorian mellowdrama.

Over three hours long and surely an epic,this version includes most of the details of the Stoker novel,including Dracula's ability to climb down the castle wall,and yet sticking to cliches.

An example would be that Dracula(as portrayed by Louis Jordan) has a look more modelled after Lugosi than Stoker.
It's also Van Helsing who slays Dracula in this version,as opposed to Quincy Morris in the novel.

Still,these are minor quibbles as the film sports fine performances(particularly Jordan as Dracula and an energetic Frank Finlay as Vna Helsing),beautiful on location shots and great atmosphere.

It's unfortunate that they chose to film the Mini-series on Video,and used many outdated Video effects,but luckily they do not distract strongly from the story.

For Dracula fans and Horror buffs,this DVD is a must.

Note:In a bit of irony,it appears that the two most faithful versions of the two most celebrated Horror novels were filmed at virtually the same time.

The few differences I see is that this Dracula doesn't start off as an old man. He rather has the same late 40ish apppearance throughout the series. I liked the ladies that played Mina and Lucy. The gentelman who played Van Helsing was very good and very believeable. One cannot top Dwight Fry as Reinfield, but this gentleman who played him does a great job. I thought of Jourdan's Dracula as a French latin lover more than a vampyre from Transylvania. Since this film is English, it is  fitting that he is a ""French"" outsider looking in. The scenes with Dracula's 3 women were sexy, yet horrifying (baby scene). I believe the BBC at the time banned that scene.

2857057,5,B000R343N0,"Dracula has been reinterpreted, bastardized, glamourized and rewritten so many times that it's hard to even identify him as the charming, monstrous boyar bloodsucker.

But the closest thing to a faithful adaptation is the BBC's 1977 miniseries ""Count Dracula"", which changes only a few details from Bram Stoker's original novel. Louis Jourdan is a little too polished to be a truly faithful Dracula, but excellent acting and some wonderfully atmospheric direction elevate this above virtually every other movie made about dear ol' Vlad.

Real estate agent Jonathan Harker (Bosco Hogan) arrives in Transylvania, to arrange a London house sale to the charming, mysterious Count Dracula (Jourdan). But Harker is increasingly troubled by bizarre specters and Dracula's odd behavior, leading him to believe that Dracula is not actually human.

Meanwhile, his fiancee Mina Westenra (Judi Bowker) worries about Jonathan's absence, even as her sister Lucy (Susan Penhaligon) gets engaged to rising young Texan Quincey (Richard Barnes). But shortly after a ship piloted by a dead man crashes nearby, Lucy begins acting strangely -- and becomes ill from a mysterious loss of blood, and strange fang marks appear on her throat.

Lucy's ex-suitor John Seward (Mark Burns) calls in his old teacher Dr. Van Helsing (Frank Finlay). Despite their best efforts, Lucy dies -- but not before showing a savage sensual side. It's only then that Dr. Van Helsing reveals the true, ghastly identity of what killed Lucy, and has turned her into an undead seductress: the vampire Count Dracula, who has somehow made his way to England. And now that he's targeting Mina, Van Helsing and the three young men must stop him.

""Count Dracula"" is probably the most faithful adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel, ever. It has a few minor changes (Arthur and Quincey are squished into one man), but but the rest of the story is lovingly faithful to the source. It even has little details that most movies overlook -- including the grotesque scene where Dracula hands over a baby as ""lunch"" for his brides.

At first the action alternates between cobwebbed stone passages of Castle Dracula and quaint Victorian seaside towns. But Dracula's shadow falls over them pretty quickly, and everything starts speeding up. Suddenly we have gory midnight stakings, crypts, dark forests, and across the Carpathian mountains. It all culminates in a wild chase across Transylvania, fighting gypsies and fending off the brides.

Director Philip Saville does a brilliant job here -- he's good at the staid drawing rooms you expect from the BBC period movies, but he's equally good at shadowed smokey forests.  There are some horrifically erotic bloodsucking scenes (sort of a vampiric date-rape), as well as some cute romances between the human lovers. And he loves to linger on Jourdan's eerier moments, like when Dracula lazily smiles at a hysterical Harker.

Saville also slaps in reversed color and misty, dreamlike camerawork, giving any scenes with vampiric powers an eerie, hallucinatory feeling. It's a slightly dated technique -- as is the climbing-down-the-wall scene -- but it doesn't really detract from the creep factor.

Jourdan is not quite the passionate looming Dracula that, say, Christopher Lee was. He's a little too calm, polished and French. But his Dracula is still very good -- charismatic, intelligent, and gives the impression of great age and maturity. And he's freaking creepy -- those bloody eyes, hairy palms and chilly masklike expression are all wonderfully eerie.

Frank Finlay also makes a truly magnificent Van Helsing, who's as smart if not as lethal as Dracula; Hogan, Bowker and Barnes all do an excellent job, and Penhaligan does a great switcheroo between the sweet Lucy and her wanton vampire self. And Jack Shepherd is a truly brilliant Renfield -- wild-eyed, twitchy, erratic, and prone to biting the male nurses, except when falling in love with Mina.

""Count Dracula"" is the single most faithful adaptation of Bram Stoker's classic novel, and a solid horror movie in its own right. Definitely a must-see for those who appreciate Dracula as he should be.",1225324800,6,4145,5.179372197309417

It is more true to the story than the Hammer versions (though they have their charms, as well), and even the very-good Frank Langella portrayal (with Laurence Olivier and Kate Nelligan).  The supporting characters are fine (though none particularly stand-out), but Louis Jourdan is the star, and does an excellent job portraying the Count.  Being made for British television, some of the effects are rather simplistic and tacky, but the scene of Dracula scaling the castle wall is memorable, as is the sequence where he brings the three vampire girls a baby to feed on and we see their blood-stained lips afterwards.

This for me is the best adaptation of this classic gothic romance.  Although the novel describes Dracula as a horror figure, this adaptation makes the Dracula character more acceptable to the viewer (and attractive!).  Can't think of any woman resisting Jourdan.  His elegance, charm and attractiveness is much like that of Frank Langella (which by the way was, for me, the worst adapation of Dracula) and of Bela Lugosi.  And yet, there is an eeriness, mystery, behind Jourdan's portrayal...sort of an enigma.

I've always loved watching Frank Finlay.  He has an uncanny ability to portray various characters (from Porthos to Iago) and his Dr. Van Helsing is no different.  I do agree with the other comments here that it is at times a bit cheesy.

I still find it an engaging version with competent acting and production values. It's understandable that reviewers would remark on how close to the book it stays -- on comparison with Hammer films and their ilk. Count Dracula still has some significantly different details from the book, but the changes were intelligently made in order to create a tight tv production, and they don't alter the theme of the book.
I had totally forgotten the use of negative film for special effects. It appears to have had some hand-masking done too. Good craftsmanship. Special effects, incidentally, are used with restraint. That was fortunate, as it comes off less dated than some of its contemporaries.

2857068,5,B000R343N0,"In terms of acting excellence, atmosphere, location and period authenticity, this much-loved 1977 BBC production of Bram Stoker's novel, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dracula/dp/0312241704/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dracula</a>"", is quite possibly the single best (and therefore most essential) cinematic adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel available.

But I'll be damned if this version doesn't just wash and wipe the floor with Francis Ford Coppola's 1992 version while leaving the (admittedly, classic) Hammer Films Draculas to wax up afterwards.

Much has been made of the great performances given by the cast. ""Count Dracula"" presents us with an astute, intelligent Mina; a kindly, wise, and resolute Dr. Van Helsing, and an unabashedly female Lucy. Louis Jourdan portrays Dracula himself -- arguably the most famous vampire in all of western literature -- as a truly formidable, savagely urbane beast with a heavy overtone of repugnant sex appeal. The casual, arrogant dismissiveness with which he tosses off the famous ""children of the night"" comment, combined with his reptilian gaze, very clearly telegraphs how far removed from the line of men his Count Dracula has become over the centuries. It's also nice to finally see a portrayal of Jonathan Harker showing some actual balls with regards to his predicament as a hostage in Dracula's castle. All this in a film that essentially follows the novel's plot point-for-point.

The occasionally videotaped footage has the tendency to make this feel like a superior episode of ""Dark Shadows"" -- keeping in mind what a good show that was -- but that's all in its favour. The cinematography is, by and large, excellent. Whitby, England looks positively gothic while the frequent night-time scenes portray everything in ethereal detail. The music score, while sparse, is frankly spooky. The special effects generally aren't (with a few very notable exceptions), but they are few and far between and don't really detract from the effectiveness of the production.

The DVD itself is as bare-bones as they come with a series of ads at the beginning that becomes old very quickly (the more so since one cannot skip through them). Nevertheless, this is such a small price to pay -- and the disc is very reasonably priced indeed -- for the enjoyment of such a fine film. The transfer is solid, the sound is crisp, and the overall story adaptation is outstanding.

Whichever other versions of ""Dracula"" you may own, don't hesitate to add this one to your collection. If you've never seen any version of ""Dracula"" before, pick this up. Ultimately, it's the only one you need to own.",1202860800,5,3112,5.860927152317881

Memory can be a fickle thing, especially when something such as this video has not been available for viewing for so many years. I'm happy to say that my memory served me correctly. This is still a very good version of the novel 'Dracula' by Bram Stoker.

Some have commented on the production values being on the 'cheap' side, and it is true. But without modern special effects (and the temptation to overdo them to the detriment of the story) the tale is brought forth by good acting, and the production values actually seem to enhance the production instead of undermine it.

As this video was originally a mini-series, the video runs approximately 160 minutes, almost three hours. Another positive as far as I'm concerned, for the story can unfold in due course without being rushed.  Add to that Louis Jordan as a great Dracula, Frank Finlay as his equal as Van Helsing and a fine supporting cast, this video is a great one to watch.

Louis Jourdan does a great job as the Count and the rest of the cast does very well in their respective roles as well, but I often found myself wanting to push the fast-forward button on my remote just to get to some excitement. I can appreciate a filmmaker's desire to stay true to the novel, but their should be some surprises that those of us who've read the book won't expect. That's the whole point in film adaptations of books: FRESH INTERPRETATION!
The scenery and sets are beautiful and as I said, all the acting is well done. It is old, so some of the SFX are outdated, but the fangs and blood red eyes add great scare tactics. The one other thing that bothered me, however, was the use of thermal imaging. In  a few shots (used for FX), we get to see vampires in HEAT VISION!

2857076,5,B000R343N0,"On the 110th anniversary of Bram Stoker's publication of the vampire heavyweight,""Dracula,"" it has been a quite a year, especially on DVD, for the undying Count. First, PBS released a new version which explored the connection between disease & vampirism. Then, a great DVD came out of Jess Franco's version starring Christopher Lee.

 Now, the coup de grace, with the long awaited PBS adaptation from 1977, starring Louis Jourdan. This rightly has the reputation of being closest to the original source, and insinuates a subtle and creepy gothic atmosphere not seen in very many horror movies of today.

 The movie begins, much as Stoker first described, with young solicitor, Jonathan Harker (expertly played by Bosco Hogan) preparing to leave Whitby, England, and saying goodbye to his fiancee' Mina Westenra (Judi Bowker), her sister, Lucy (Susan Penhaligon) and their mother. He goes off to Transylvania to sell real estate to Count Dracula.  His journey to the castle and stay there, is creepily portrayed with a sense of dread, filled with well meaning carriage passengers crossing themselves at the mention of his destination, baying wolves, and a night cold and bleak. Harker's time at the castle is also much as Stoker described, with his host, the Count, cordial but bizarre and unsettling. Harker soon begins to feel like a prisoner due to the uncompromising demands of Count Dracula, and along with being locked in his room. As in the novel, other dreadful surprises await him, including Dracula's three bloodthirsty vampire brides.

  From there, Dracula sails to England, with the ship crashing onto Whitby shore in a storm. Soon, Lucy comes to display the classic signs of paleness, constant fatigue and weariness, and two red bite marks on her neck. One of her suitors and friend, Dr. Jack Seward, calls in his specialist friend, Dr. Abraham Van Helsing to examine her. Van Helsing puts the pieces together, and suspects the work of the vampire in their midst. Under Van Helsing's leadership, they seek to 'stamp out the evil' influence of the Count. For, as the Professor advises, ""Evil will not disappear simply because we disapprove of it. We have to fight!"" Thus the film is faithful the spirit of the novel in its portrayal of Good vs. Evil.

  The movie has several strong facets managing to be quite moody and chilling due to its dark atmosphere and creepy minimalist score. All the actors turn in A level performances. Frank Finlay as Van Helsing is excellent, believably pulling off the accent, but most importantly has plenty of charm, wit, and is a determined and intelligent leader. While Peter Cushing remains my all time favorite Van Helsing, Finlay's portrayal is closest to the novel's Professor. Jack Shepherd, is hands down, the best Renfield in recent memory. His portrayal of the patient in Dr. Seward's sanitarium, with a mysterious link to the Count, is effective and full of surprises. He can leap into intense outbursts and yet be calm and reflective at the same time all as he struggles with Dracula's influence. And Judi Bowker as Mina, with her angelic looks and honesty of her portrayal, captures the novel's sense of Mina in making viewers believe the men would fight and sacrifice themselves to save her from Dracula's evil.

  Finally, the most important performance, is that of the actor playing the Count himself. In that, Louis Jourdan does not disappoint, and even exceeds expectations. At first, one may be frustrated as he doesn't seem to closely resemble the Count as described in the novel, with the white hair and mustache: Jourdan is clean shaven, and looks relatively normal. However, Jourdan keeps his portrayal low key and cool and subtle. Gradually, one begins to feel his sense of evil creeping into the lives of the characters. Jourdan gives the impression of pure ominous evil, which is unlike other adaptations of Dracula at the time, such as from actors like Jack Palance, Frank Langella, and later, Gary Oldman, who are more ambiguous and lovelorn. Not so with Jourdan, and this is truly more in the spirit of the novel than in other portrayals despite their excellence in themselves. Jourdan does share distinct physical characteristics of the novel's Count, such as the fangs and black outfit, as well as clawed hands and hairy palms (which I've never seen in any other adaptation.)

  Lastly, as stated before, rather than be influenced by the cynical nature of other films with their ""downer"" endings, writer Gerald Savory's script centers squarely on the struggle of pious good men and women against the timeless supernatural malevolence represented by Count Dracula. It was this theme, he said as a young boy in camp, that made such a strong impression on him when he encountered the book, and wanted to bring that to the fore in his adaptation. With the assured direction of Philip Saville, this is fully realized in this adaptation. The only caveats are that the movie was photographed on film and video tape, and some of the technical effects used to demonstrate Dracula's influence are dated and somewhat campy. But, these are minor distractions in this telling of the story that is as faithful, effective, and genuinely as creepy and gothic, as its original source.",1193788800,6,5243,4.9942660550458715

2857080,3,B000R343N0,"""Count Dracula"" was a 2-part BBC miniseries in 1977, which seems to owe its enduring popularity to Louis Jourdan's suave, confident interpretation of the title role. Screenwriter Gerald Savory had in mind to adapt Bram Stoker's novel ""Dracula"" relatively faithfully to film, which unfortunately makes for a drawn-out affair that undercuts any spark it might generate. The film is labeled ""A Gothic Romance"" in the opening titles, and that accurately reflects its tone and pace. Like other televsion productions of ""Dracula"", its greatest contribution may be its influence on later theatrical films. In this case, the sexually charged scenes between Count Dracula and his young prey informed John Badham's 1979 film.

In 1890s London, Mina Westerna (Judi Bowler) sees her fiance Jonathan Harker (Bosco Hogan) off on a trip to Eastern Europe, where he is to have some paperwork signed for the sale of old Carfax Abbey. Mina's flirtatious sister Lucy (Susan Penhaligon) must choose between 2 suitors, family friend Dr. John Seward (Mark Burns) and a twangy Texan named Quincey Holmwood (Richard Barnes). As Mina anxiously awaits word from Jonathan and Lucy anticipates her marriage, Lucy falls mysteriously ill. Meanwhile, Jonathan has been imprisoned by his sinister host, Count Dracula (Louis Jourdan), and only sheer terror inspires a daring escape.

This ""Count Dracula"" makes Mina and Lucy sisters and combines Stoker's Quincey Morris and Arthur Holmwood. It moves scenes around a bit, but it leaves Stoker's basic storyline and intentions in tact, which some viewers may prefer. Because ""Count Dracula"" brought scant innovation to the evolving body of Dracula films, however, it has difficulty establishing any relevance to the time and place it was made. Louis Jourdan's interpretation of the predatory Count harkens to the Balderston/Deane play and Bela Lugosi's 1931 performance. This Count Dracula is erudite, urbane, and dismissive of his enemies.

""Count Dracula""'s greatest flaw is that it is too long. The film moves so slowly that it cannot sustain tension, and its sporadic bursts of horror and sexuality can only penetrate the languor momentarily. It has its moments. We have to wait a half hour between them. Production values are low. Psyychedelic visual effects when Dracula's blood lust is aroused neither enhance nor detract from the drama. Lucy is pure camp. On the upside, Frank Finlay and Jack Shepherd are noteworthy in their roles as Prof. Van Helsing and Renfield, respectively. Louis Jourdan's Count is charismatic, though not menacing. And there is a real live bat in this movie! It's kind of cute.",1192320000,4,2625,5.290167865707434
2857081,5,B000R343N0,"I have never fogotten the creeping horror this production gave to me when I first saw it, and the acting has not palled.  Louis Jourdan is the best Count Dracula I have ever seen, pulling off attractive and repellent at the same time, and proving what a skilled and versatile actor he could be with a good script to work from.  While other productions boast better FX, this one stands head and shoulders above the rest for acting and faithfulness to  the novel.  It should be in every horror collection.",1191801600,3,503,4.555555555555555

The thing that annoys me the most is the DVD forcing you to watch the BBC previews in the beginning. There seems to be no way to fastforward, Menu, Top Menu, or Chapter Skip to the main feature.  Has anyone else experienced this or found a way to get around it?",1191196800,4,477,4.10752688172043
2857083,5,B000R343N0,"I received this DVD of the BBC Production of Count Draculs (1977) earlier this week.  I must say that this version of the Dracula mythos is much closer to the story line of Stoker's classic novel than any other film to date.  Louis Jourdan did an excellent job in performing as Count Dracula.  Frank Finlay did a good job as Dr. Van Helsing with that interesting Einstein-like hairdo.  Jourdan's performance was somewhat more romantic than the animalistic Dracula of Bram Stoker.  However, the conveying of evil and power was excellent. For pure terror and dramatic tension, I still favor Hammer's Horror of Dracula with Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing.  Still...this film is very close in both quality and excitement in bringing to us a very haunting tale. I particularly enjoyed how the film used actual settings for the film including the use of the Whitby Abbey site.  This helps to bring a touch of realism which represents the story in a manner as Stoker probably envisaged it.

The picture as shown on this DVD was nicely presented in color with sharp images.  Though there are no extras to be found in this DVD, the movie itself is very much worthwhile for any viewer to see.  No true horror aficionado should do without obtaining this DVD of BBC's Count Dracula.

Finally, I noted that one of the earlier reviewers expressed concern that the famous baby scene might not be included in this DVD.  Rest be assured...the baby scene is indeed included in all of its gruesome glory.",1191024000,9,1488,4.76953125
2857084,5,B000R343N0,"There is no other Dracula movie out there that comes as close to the novel as this one.  If you're looking for a movie that does the novel justice then look no further! The scenery of the castle and the land is perfect.  The castle is dark and eerie, and as you watch you can feel the fear coming from Jonathan Harker, who is held prisoner in the castle.  This is, indeed, a very scary version of Dracula. The acting is good, the cast is good, and the plot follows very close to Stoker's work.  The BBC has certianly given the book the justice it deserves.

Louis Jourdan played the role of the Count very well.  I believe he really captured the nature of Dracula.  He's no Christopher Lee or Gary Oldman, but he deserves all the credit just the same.

They captured the role of Lucy Westenra quite well.  This really brought the book to life.  Lucy falls victim to the Count, dies and becomes a vampire.  The staking of Lucy, as well as stuffing her mouth with garlic, and then cutting off her head is every bit in the novel and is all included in the film.  Very well done!

The role of Mina was also captured very well.  Her love for Jonathan, her fears while he is away and her becoming victim of the Count to become one of his wives.  The scene were Van Helsing is protecting her from the brides of Dracula is very convincing and, at the same time, very frieghtening.

The roles of Jonathan Harker, Dr. John Seward, and Van Helsing have all been brought to life in a way no other Dracula movie ever has.  The gentlemen playing the role of Van Helsing (Frank Finlay) really hits the spot.  This is the best van Helsing I've ever seen.  Perfect!  Just perfect!  Watch and you'll see.

Now I would like to point out just a few things about the characters names, and as well as a few other things.  I'm not fussing but I think it should mentioned anyway.

1. Mina:  In the movie she is protrayed as Mina Westenra, sister of Lucy Westenra.  In the novel she is Mina Murray and no relation, other than best friends, to Lucy.

2. Lucy and Quincey P. Holmwood: (The role of Quincey was also done very well for this film. Just so you know that)  In the movie they are engaged to be married.  In the novel his name is Quincey P. Morris and, if I remember correctly, he proposed to Lucy, but did not marry her.  Lucy had chosen to be engaged to Aurthor Holmwood.

3. The death of Dracula:  In the movie he is staked.  In the novel Quincey's bowie knife plunges into the Counts heart while he is lying in his box of earth.  Also in the book, Jonathan used his own knife to shear the counts throat.  This happend, at the same time, as Quincey's bowie knife finished the deed.

4. In the novel Quincey dies from a stab wound caused by one of the Counts gypsies.  In the movie, though wounded from a gun shot, he appears to have survived as he lies against a tree while Van Helsing leads the group in a prayer of thanksgiving.

I may have forgotten to mention a few other flaws, but it doesn't matter.  These are very minor flaws and, as I said earlier, I'm not fussing about them.  They are so minor that they don't even affect the quality of the film in any way.  This is the best version of the novel you can get and it is one of the best Dracula movies ever made.  This is the first time I've ever seen this movie and, having read the novel my self, I've got to tell you that I have never been more impressed with such a fine adaption of Bram Stokers work.  Long time fans of ""Dracula"" will not be disapointed with this DVD.",1190937600,12,3518,4.227067669172932
2857085,5,B000R343N0,"I just received my DVD in the mail, so here is the good news:

This is the complete, uncut version -- baby scene and all. The picture quality is quite good, considering that this was originally a TV production shot partly on video and partly on film -- interior scenes were shot on video tape, exterior scenes on film.

The bad news:

There are no extras, not even a printed case booklet.  The US version is NTSC, mono sound, in 4:3 aspect ratio, not widescreen as claimed in the product details.

Overall, I'm very pleased to finally have a proper copy of this feature.  This is hands down the best screen(big or small) adaptation of Stoker's novel.

I saw this on PBS back in 1977 and have been rabidly searching for a copy to buy on the internet for years!  Every Halloween would bring this wonderful version of the classic tale to tv.

PBS does an amazing job as always.  The atmosphere is haunting, and while it lacks the sophistication of todays special effects, it is still rich in atmosphere.  The actors and sets are superb.  I always remembered the stairs in the seaside town that led to the cemetery.

Louis Jourdan was extremely sexy, and it made the thought of being a vampire exceedingly appealing when one could spend eternity with him!

Bravo to finally releasing this fantastic mini-series to DVD!",1190851200,7,769,4.644444444444445

2857089,5,B000R343N0,"I have long awaited the release of BBC's Dracula [1977] starring Louis Jourdan in the title role [was very young then, but remember watching it and having nightmares for weeks afterward]. This production is arguably the most faithful adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula, and the excellent casting, meticulous attention to the language and other details make this a must own for fans of Dracula.

Louis Jourdan plays Dracula with understated but palpable menace, and though he may seem a bit too good-looking for the role, he definitely plays his role with a high level of credibility. Frank Findlay makes a riveting and earnest Van Helsing, and Jack Shepherd as the maniacal Renfield is a 'delight' to watch. Both Mina and Lucy, the stalked prey of Dracula, are played to good effect by the beautiful and luminous Judi Bowker and Susan Penhaligon.

This version truly makes your skin crawl - it is so very atmospheric, and the convincing settings, such as the use of London's Highgate Cemetery provides an authentic feel to the story. The pervasive evil that underscores the story is felt throughout and makes this version of Dracula a visual feast, peppered with intelligent dialogue, and credible, convincing acting.

I had read the book as a child and knew the story backwards and forwards. I was At my grandmothers when I first saw this and It gave me such a lasting impression- I was awe stuck by the production (and not to mention scared silly for my age..but Loved every bloody minute of it) I only saw it once and to this day remains my favorite version EVER released-even though my memory of parts of it are a bit foggy the production was So powerful,so Seductive and deliciously evil especially the baby scene there are scenes I have never forgotten to this day. Thats How good this film is. I have recently caught tome scenes off the internet and my oh my it how great it was to see them again nealy after 25plus years after I first saw it and I can not wait for this to finally be released. Louis Jordan brings a subtile european flair to his character he has pulled it off like no one else has. With his suave sensual demeanor, underneath lies a dark evil that has nothing but contempt for man and views them only as food. After all he has lived over 500 years and those who dared to cross his path and cross wits with him centuries before they were born have died and  many not pleasently....So listen to them The Children Of the Night What Sweet Music they make...The cast , production, direction and scenery are top notch and some of the best ever put to film-SO-Surrender to the dark embrace and the best version Of Dracula EVER to be put on film...It Goes for the Jugular with a deep dark sensual bite...

2857092,3,B000R343N0,"I also, as others here, saw this on PBS when it was first released in the late 70s. It was rebroadcast a few years later, but only once, never to be seen again after that. As reviewers here have mentioned, the scene that sticks out in my mind is where Louis Jourdan, who portrays Dracula, climbs down the wall (I guess the reason that all of us here remember that scene is due to how surreal it really seemed for the late 70s, especially TV). Yes, it was one of those early BBC miniseries, so it was shot on videotape, but this only seems to have made it all the more eery for me @ the time(although, given, I was but a preteen). This video format also seemed to make a similarly-themed earlier TV show, ""Dark Shadows"", all the more immediate and, yes, eery. I also remembered the production music from the Jourdan series to this day and I have recalled just how insecure I got after each evening's chapter had finished. Since, first, only the final chapter had the 'happy' ending, with each of the others leaving me with a feeling of dread, and, second, I had to go to bed not long after each evening's broadcast(YIPES!!!), I was sure my imagination had built this up a bit, too. Over the years, my father and I had discussed this version & I remember him hoping beyond hope for it to be released on video, it seeming to have been forgotten. Alas, it never was released. In recent years, I had began to see it resurfacing in articles and books, renewing my need to see it once again. Last year, I found this(with what appears to be the same packaging as here)on eBay, through Great Britain(for about the same price, actually). I purchased it, along with another 70s TV release, ""The True Story of Frankenstein"", starring Michael Sarrazin. That one is going to my cousin, the childhood memory definitely being stronger than the actual production. This one, I'm happy to report, will become an annual Halloween viewing for me...even shot on videotape!!! It still holds up after all these years! I feel that this is due, partially, to the fact that it was more closely based to the Stoker novel than other adaptations, creating a much more literate and intellectual piece, making this DVD well worth its weight in gold.",1188950400,24,2217,4.545
2857093,5,B000R343N0,"I agree with all of the reviews ... have waited a very very long time.  This is absolutely the best version of the story, in any format, book, stage, TV or film.  The production is flawless and Jourdan is superb ... this is truly the absolute best.",1188950400,3,248,4.25531914893617
2857094,5,B000R343N0,"This has been the hardest version to find - I can't believe we are finally going to get the COMPLETE series (there was a cut copy floating around a while back that left whole chunks of the story out).  I recall seeing this when it was first broadcast, and getting chillbumps.  I can't wait for my copy to arrive!

This role was a wonderful stretch for Jourdan.  You may recall him from his parts in ""Gigi"" and ""Can Can."" This is as far from those as any actor could get, proving his considerable flexibility.  His Count is menacing and seductive at the same time, reasonable yet commanding.  The supporting cast is excellent.  The standout is Frank Finlay's Van Helsing is no-nonsense, as opposed to flamboyant.  The undercurrents in the confrontation between the two are amazing.  Judi Bowker returns to Mina the sensible nature with which Stoker endowed her.  Susan Penhaligon's Lucy is sensual without being silly.  Renfield is not comic relief here, either - he is truly a tragic character, and this interpretation is perfect.

Special effects are minimal, if memory serves, but this is not gore & horror in today's sense.  Adding more would have been overkill, and lack of them does not diminish this production in the slightest.

Now for the plot line.  This is, with a few exceptions, true to the original work.  Since the book was done in diary style, screenwriters have been plagued with problems trying for a 'definitive' version of the novel.  (And if you think you are inured to horror, try reading an unabridged copy of the Stoker novel.)  The book has Lucy and Mina as best friends, and Stoker gave Lucy three suitors.  This version has the girls as sisters (understandable).  Lucy's suitors, Arthur Holmwood and Quincey Morris, are condensed into Quincey Holmwood, with Dr. Seward (her third suitor in the book) remaining separate and not quite to type.  There are always problems with the conclusion, which was more closely followed in Coppola's ""Bram Stoker's Dracula.""  Oh well.  These differences should be noted (I tend to be a purist once I've read the book) but they are admittedly minor, all other things being considered.

This version is one of the top two out there.  It's running time allowed the producers to fully explore the book, which seems more complex after each reading.  If you have to introduce anyone to the Dracula genre, this would be the way to do it.  It is certainly a benchmark against which ALL other versions can be judged.

Update:  Well, it's not all here, but this is probably the best we are going to do.  Some sequences are still missing, but it does remain one of the best.",1188604800,7,2625,4.7560975609756095

It is unfortunate in a way that I saw this at such a formative age ... because I have viewed every adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel from the perspective of this classic drama.  Nothing ever came close.  It has all been a big disappointment.  Made in the classic years of British television, this for me, is the one and only -- the most accurate, most compelling, most frightening adaptation of the Dracula story I have ever seen.

I was just a little kid when this thing aired on PBS, and then . . . it never came on again, as near as i can tell.  What happened to the good old days, when PBS recycled?  Oh, they're still showing Lawrence Welk, but the Dracula mini?  Nay.  So I pondered and I puzzled, and I searched the Web in my adulthood feverishly for even a bootleg DVD, and now . . . it's happening.  My only regret is that I've orderewd this thing a month ago, and still have to wait until the end of September for it to arrive!  I remember the bad 70's vido special effects of this, but I don't care, because at the time, theu were being pretty cutting edge, especially for the BBC, who have much, much, MUCH more class than money.  So occasioanlly annoying effects aside, or production values stabnding out, like the obvious indoor sets, this is a great effort to really do something with the classic novel.  Here, Dracula is presented as an implied Antichrist or cult leader, seeking disciples, a very ominous concept for the late 70's, what with Manson and Jim Jones.  I have never forgotten the baby in a sack Dracula brought to his brides for food, because at that young age, I had not read Stoker's novel.  This is the show that made me want to read it, and as soon as i was able, I did.  I can say, hands down, this is the best adaptation yet.  There are some liberties taken with the story, but no more than any other Dracula movie - in fact, less than most.  And most importantly, in this post Anne Rice era, Dracula is EVIL in this one.  Sure, he can be romantic and sexy (we are talking Louis Jourdan, after all), but he is a monster, a bloodsucker, just as Stoker intended.  In my world, there's only room for ONE manic-depressive, remorseful vamp, and that's Barnabas Collins.  Kudos to whoever realized this was a DVD that needed to be released!

These are the flaws as I see them and they are minor compared to other versions of Dracula.  I wish it was subtitled as I am hearing impaired.  They make Mina and Lucy sisters for some reason and completely eliminate the character of Arthur.  Mina was very pretty but in my opinion was too young and did not really manage to portray Mina always as the strong and capable character she was in the book.
Despite this if you want to have an idea of what really happens in Bram Stoker's Dracula without actually reading it this is the best filmed version to date.  Even better is the audible book.
