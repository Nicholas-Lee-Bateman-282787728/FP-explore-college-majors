8020997,5,B00022UDOO,"This is not the Tonight Show Steve Allen, meaning his nightly 90-minute show. This is the weekly Steve Allen (""The Steve Allen Plymouth Show""), and equally a reminder of the kind of talent, humour, and personality it took way back when to sustain a TV show. Of course, with all the Cable outlets to fill, the talent pool is thinned out in this day and age. But let's give Allen and co., their due: despite the obvious ""boys club"" at work, and the 1960 approach to stand-up, both which cannot be exempt from serious scrutiny against today's standards of diversity, this tape has an abundance of intelligent witticisms, in stand-up, sketch, and straight man-second banana segments. Don Knotts, Gabriel Dell, Pat Harrington, Jr., Bill Dana, and Louis Nye all do well, especially in a satirical look at the crass commercialism
of the growing medium: Allen plays the President of a third-rate TV network, introducing new banal programming for the 1960-61 season.
Henny Youngman is on the scene with his rapid-fire, and mostly funny lines, although the young, unitiated student of comedy may be shocked at what was considered sophisticated stand-up at the time.
On the musical side we have Erroll Garner, Bobby Hackett, Les Brown, and Tony Bennett - Tony is typically great, in a lounge or big band backdrop. Talking about stuff you'll never see again, Tony lights up a cigarette, the perfect complement at the time for a smooth number sung close to the 88s.
Ginger Rogers has a slightly overlong, but interesting and funny scene, as the ""feminine comic"" - the answer to the stereotypucal lady comedian doing it guy-style in a guy's world. She slinks about in a semi-diaphonous robe in her low-lit boudouir and tells.....bar jokes! She's excellent....and more risque than one might expect for 1960!
To set up her bit, another lady comic demonstrates the masculine/feminine hybrid - unfortunately she's not identified.",1209168000,17,1911,5.012578616352202
8020998,5,B00022UDOO,"Steve Allen was one of the first great comic stars of TV. He had a kind of intelligent zaniness and surrounded himself with a cast of real comic characters, the most famous of whom Louie Nye ( Why not Boob-a-lee? ) and Don Knotts appear in this show. He had a very pleasant manner and an infectious laugh . His shows brought a lot of late- night comic pleasure.",1150329600,13,361,4.246376811594203
