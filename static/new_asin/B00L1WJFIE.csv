8663255,3,B00L1WJFIE,"This is kind of a really late review but,This movie wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be but the title is misleading I was looking for a leprechaun movie to watch during St. Patricks Day saw this rented it because it had Leprechauns in the title and guess what no Leprechauns was pretty disappointed in the lack of Leprechauns. There is only a one or two-minute scene with Leprechauns in it, but other than that the movie was not bad, it was actually good for the low budget it had. The voice talent is pretty good and the animation is not bad, story was good, not great but good I say its worth a watch and worth buying for five dollars or less but I would not go any higher its a good movie to watch if there is nothing else on and I think kids will get a kick out of it. If you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do",1528070400,,838,3.964497041420118

8663257,5,B00L1WJFIE,"One of my favorite bad movies (actually, probably my favorite). There are so many odd plot-elements, character design choices, editing decisions, and other such things. There are some movies that are so bad that they are unwatchable (The Little Panda Fighter), but this movie has just enough competence that you can follow it, but is also bad enough to be entertaining.

I genuinely enjoy this movie (with friends, that is).",1507161600,,424,5.057142857142857
8663258,1,B00L1WJFIE,"This film is terrible. We watched it because the title has ""leprechauns"" in it and it's March.

Well I don't want to spoil the film but there aren't any leprechauns in it.  It does have creepy lifeless characters and weirdly hypertextured fantasy creatures sure to give you nightmares with their unblinking bloodshot eyes.  Also the film opens with a montage from pioneer/covered wagon times- quickly advances to an old man dying of a heart attack alone in his kitchen (he must have been about 150 years old by then.).

About half of the film takes place in a subterranean acid trip of rainbow dancing colors- perhaps this film could be enjoyed by someone using psychedelic drugs.

My kids were held in a trance like state by the quick-cut style editing and bright colors but at the end were genuinely disappointed that nothing made sense during the film and there were NO LEPRECHAUNS!",1488585600,3,885,4.796052631578948
8663259,5,B00L1WJFIE,One of the worst animated children's movies ever made. This movie makes you feel like you just had a 2 hour long fever dream. If you like terrible movies this a must.,1485302400,,166,4.21875
8663260,5,B00L1WJFIE,"A great party film, if you're a conossier of weird and kinda bad films. I love the horrifying opening where someone dies of a heart attack. I love how all the dwegons are ugly as sin except for token female lead character. I love bootleg Boris and natasha. I love the terrible mouth flapping. Dweg on you guys.",1458864000,2,310,4.362068965517241
8663261,5,B00L1WJFIE,"I thought the animation was fine. Great story, cute characters. Kids love it! Finally a movie that isn't Planes 5 orCars 25! Original ideas are so much better than the same movie over and over again! Worth the spot in the DVD collection.",1418342400,,237,4.534883720930233
8663262,1,B00L1WJFIE,"My two and four year old sons enjoy the movie, but they also enjoy movies that are genuinely good. If you start to watch this movie and think the animation is bad, wait until the characters are introduced. The characters are stereotypical and highly unoriginal. Oh, and about that animation. I've seen some pretty bad low budget computer animated films, but this one seems to take the cake. It might be possible that the creators of this project intentionally made the animation so bad to distract the viewer from how bad the story line and characters are. This movie is almost bad enough to be a farce of itself.",1416096000,4,613,4.63302752293578

8663264,1,B00L1WJFIE,"The animation is terrible.  So bad, in fact, that we made it through approximately 3 minutes of the movie before shutting it off.",1414627200,3,129,4.608695652173913
