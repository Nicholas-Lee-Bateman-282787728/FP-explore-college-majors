1176720,3,B0000022L1,If you haven't seen the original version you will enjoy this one. The original one has better atmosphere but this one is not to be ignored. It has a good pace and keeps the viewer interested.,1171584000,,191,4.333333333333333
1176721,3,B0000022L1,"This is a remake of the 1949 movie of the same name that was superior in every way.  It goes for a Hitchcockian style of mystery but the directors are not nearly as skilled.  It does have a fairly fast pace to it which lifts it to a three star rating however.

The always likable Dennis Quaid is Dexter Cornell, an English Professor and author who is generally a beaten down wretch of a man.  He's a borderline alcoholic, his wife is leaving him and one of his students apparently commits suicide by jumping from a window.  He drinks himself into a stupor and when he feels especially terrible he learns that somehow he had been poisoned and has only 24 hours(give or take) to live and find out who poisoned him.  He enlists the aid of one of his students, Sydney Fuller (Meg Ryan).  Enlists isn't the right word.  He puts superglue on his hand and grabs her wrist, locking them together.  I guess the handcuffs of the original was a bit too mundane.

I like Dennis Quaid but found his portrayal just to be way too melodramatic in this film, far moreso than Edmund O'Brien's in the original.  And Meg Ryan just comes off as ditzy and a little too old to be playing a college student.  I know she has that young, fresh face but she was 27 at the time of this film and it strained credibility.  Add to that this film has a very annoying musical score througout that seems wildy inappropriate for this type of film.

Some good things are the style in which it was filmed.  There's some interesting angles and subtle things going on that makes it a cut above average.  Not bad but not great.",1117584000,8,1587,4.346938775510204

1176723,3,B0000022L1,"Although I liked this film, it's probably because I was an early teen when I saw Quaid and Ryan together in Inner Space. This remake is NOT directed well; it's perhaps the sloppiest directing job I've ever seen. Chemistry is nice between Quaid and Ryan again, but it kind of creeps you out that there's supposed to be an age difference here (I really don't agree that Meg is convincing as a 19-22 year old), and Stern is as menacing here as he is in Home Alone. The script is fairly predictable even if you haven't seen the original, and in general the point of this movie was to showcase the two main stars, not to make a good remake of a good but weird old movie.",1059091200,5,665,4.244094488188976
1176724,2,B0000022L1,"Unless you've seen the 1947 original, you can't appreciate this imitative parody. In the original film an ordinary man doing his ordinary job gets into a deadly situation. The original film is more credible in its events and characters. It may have been more believable to its audience.
This colorful version, whose everyday background contrasts with the original film, lacks the same credibility. While university professors may kill (Eichorn, Kaczynski), it is too much of a fantasy in this fictional example. Dennis Quaid has a little too much energy in him for a dying man.
One of the startling events in the original was to have the main character, the hero, die on screen. This was very unusual then, or now. This version could have been taken from MAD magazine.",1050451200,7,768,4.915384615384616

1176753,4,B0000022L1,"D.O.A. is a remake of the 1949 film of the same title that shares the same premise but otherwise have a different story and characters.

""They didn't kill me; I was dead already,"" is the statement uttered by Dexter Cornell, an English professor at the University of Texas at Austin who has been poisoned by a slow-acting toxin and who has twenty- four hours to track down his killers before he ceases to exist. Cornell is a burned-out novelist trying to hold on to tenure at the university while seeing his marriage collapse around him. As if that weren't enough, he is receiving amorous come-ons from smart, young student Sydney Fuller and being badgered by another student, Nick Lang, to read his brilliant first novel. Not long after Dex demurs to Nick to read his novel, Nick is killed in a fall. Only then does Dex find out that Nick has been having an affair with his wife. Things keep going from bad to worse when, after an all-night drinking binge, Dex discovers that he has been slipped a poison that will kill him within 24 hours. Teaming up with the adoring Sydney, Dex tries to track down the person who poisoned him while dodging the cops, since he happens to be a prime murder suspect.

It's not on the same level as the original, but this updated version still manages a few enjoyable twists, as it is a witty and literate thriller, with a lot of irony to cut the violence. The ending shouldn't be given away, but it hangs on a laughable motivation for murder that says more about the plagiarist Zen of Hollywood and screenwriters than anything else. Quaid is convincing as the chain-smoking English professor, Ryan is true blue as the stalwart coed and Rampling looks capable of keeping her victims alive just to toy with them. In summary, ""film noir on campus"" idea works surprisingly well as it has enough inventive moments to make it interesting.",1422316800,,1865,4.6314199395770395

1176766,5,B0000022L1,"Failthful enough to the original to be a valid remake BUT definitely different enough in its own right to be considered awesome on its own merit.  If you saw the original DOA nothing beats it for the plain scary creepiness of its story.  In its day the original DOA was considered a ""B"" Movie meaning it did not have the best studio system era cast, direction and support.  Yet even for a ""B PIcture"" the original DOA used light and shadow effectively to set the mood that in part carries the picture.

This DOA is just different enough to make it interesting to watch.  Yes in places this updated version of DOA drags almost to the point where I got bored.  There are more than a music club scenesin DOA that seem to be thrown in just to get lots of use the club set. The music is loud but nothing special.  This revamped DOA is more of a who done it and valid suspects are plentiful.  The characters are well acted an interesting.  The oiriginal DOA did a far better job of telling you time was of the essence.  This DOA uses a contemporary theme of a cheating wife, questionable associates and scheming students to create a web of suspects the main character must weed through.

The vetting process is funniest when the dying guy throws a suspect onto his dinner table climbs up tino the mans face to accuse him of bing his murderer.  The part where he superglues a lady to himself and drags her hither and yonder is the weakest plot point.  The student taking a swan dive off the roof of what was a very ugly building wins a prize.  The main character getting sick to as he looks out of an ugly window of an even uglier building while in mid vritigo effect was a memorable scene.  I enjoyed this version of DOA a LOT in its own right because the culprit was reveal to be a true PSYCHO!  No I won't spoil the ending for you here but the ending to this version of DOA was beautiful, just freakin beautiful.

Sure movie purists will tell you the original DOA is the best and this updated is a dud and in pure atmospherics and story telling they are likely right.  I counter that this new DOA does not really bare comparing with the classic old DOA because; they are two different creatures in almost every way.  In this updated DOA the killer is just plain nuts but in a very realistic shallow stupid year 2014 way.  The killer in this DOA is actually vapid a word I rarely get a chance to use in context.  Vapid describes this DOA version killer as a person utterly devoid of any spark of creativity to call their own.  This DOA became my all time favorite because it stirred such strong mixed emotions in me as it ended.  I laughed, I cried, I thought, I was perplexedand finally I summed up my experience watching this version of DOA by just saying WOW!

Is this DOA better than the classic version my answer is no but not for the reason you might think.  The method of murder using the luminous toxin is the same but almost everything else is different in ways that make easy comparrison difficult \ meaningless.  This DOA update stands on its own as a who done it that is at once very funny weird and serious.  For the pittence they are asking for this DOA remake, I must rate this five stars.  I have paid far more than this asking price for movies nowhere near this good!",1407110400,,3279,4.313725490196078

1176769,4,B0000022L1,"Spoilers may be lurking.  This remake of the 1950 original isn't up to the standard set by that film noir classic, but it does do it justice.  This film has the same central theme (hero mysteriously poisoned) but the setting and the circumstances are much different.

Here Dennis Quaid plays Dexter Cornell, an English professor at the University of Texas (I think).  He's struggling to keep his marriage together, having been separated from Gail (Jane Kaczmarek).  It seems she has been unhappy for some time, primarily because Dexter ignores her.  The cause is apparently the fact that Dex abandon a once successful career as a novelist.  What Dex doesn't know is that Gail has been playing kissy face with Nick (Robert Knepper) one of Dexter's students.  Nick had been hounding Dex to read a novel he'd written and offer some advice.  As it turns out Nick is also the beneficiary of a scholarship provided by Mrs. Fitzwaring, a wealthy alum.  Nick was the son of a man who killed Mr. Fitzwaring.  Say what?

In any case, Nick is killed falling from the building where Dex teaches.  Daniel Stern plays a good friend of Dex and Gail's, hoping to get a recommendation for tenure at the school.  Dex is drinking heavily and finds himself passed out in the dorm room of a freshman student named Sydney Fuller, played by Meg Ryan who was also Quaid's main squeeze, off camera, at the time.  With more than just a hangover, Dex is ill enough to check into a hospital only to find out that he had been poisoned somewhere along the line and that there is no cure.  He's given enough of a pick-me-up to keep him going but his prognosis is certain death in the next 24-48 hours.

He goes to Gail but stumbles in on an intruder and is knocked out.  When he comes to, he finds her murdered and he is now the prime suspect given that the two dead people are now connected.  Eluding the police, Dex drags Sydney along in an effort to find out how he was poisoned and when.  The why and when is what keeps the mystery going.  Even with a few suspects, it is fairly easy to spot the who.

The film's directors, Annabel Jankel and Rocky Morton give the film a noirish modern day feel.  They even use a black and white opening (and closing) sequence similar to the 1950 original.  Dennis Quaid gives one of his best performances here as well.  While not as good as the original, the film has enough going for it to be recommended.

The Blu ray transfer comes with 1080p resolution and has a 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  While this isn't a demo grade disc, it is certainly serviceable for a bargain basement purchase.  The film grain remains and is occasionally faulty.  There are a few dull shots and the film does suffer a bit from inconsistency.  Still not a big issue.  The audio features a DTS-HD Master Audio 4.0 track with stereo up front and a mono surround track in the rear.  A bit unusual but it works fine.  Like the video it is nothing special but nothing terrible either.  There is a trailer and English subtitles only as far as extras.",1403913600,,3026,4.491743119266055

The acting was overdone and not at all convincing.  While I like Meg Ryan, she was not convincing as a college coed. Dennis Quaid looks like Agent Smith from the Matrix and his acting is nearly as leaden (although for the Matrix, that was intentional; in this movie it was not).  Putting it on Blu Ray really did nothing for the picture or sound as both were unremarkable but at least the sale price was reasonable.

They have a chemistry that burns the screen, yet a greenness that shows their stage in their careers.  Still, this film, a remake of the 1949 O'Brien film, is carried by the directing team of Jankel and Morton.  Without their stylistic approach, this would have been a forgettable mess, but they layer each scene with a physicality that makes sense and keeps us interested.  The story (of a man poisoned looking for his killer before he dies) is an intriguing one, and one that is pulled off with some serious style.

The girl - Meg Ryan - is kidnapped, glued to Quaid, dragged out in a nightdress, shot at with a nailgun, and her reaction is little more than a girl who has broken her nail. Doesn't ring true. Emotion in movies has come a long way since the 80s, but even then movies were done better.

I can't believe I didn't review this much sooner D.O. A. is a 1988 remake of the 1950 film noir D.O.A. While it shares the same premise, it has a different story and characters.  The film was directed by Annabel Jankel and Rocky Morton, the creators of Max Headroom, and scripted by Charles Edward Pogue. The writers of the original film, Russell Rouse and Clarence Greene, share story credit with Pogue.  Film critic Roger Ebert called it a ""witty and literate thriller

DOA is failthful enough to the original to be a valid remake BUT definitely different enough in its own right to be considered awesome on its own merit. If you saw the original DOA nothing beats it for the plain scary creepiness of its story. In its day the original DOA was considered a ""B"" Movie meaning it did not have the best studio system era cast, direction and support. Yet even for a ""B PIcture"" the original DOA used light and shadow effectively to set the mood that in part carries the picture.

This DOA is just different enough to make it interesting to watch. The music is loud but nothing special. This revamped DOA is more of a who done it and valid suspects are plentiful. The characters are well acted an interesting. The oiriginal DOA did a far better job of telling you time was of the essence. This DOA uses a contemporary theme of a cheating wife, questionable associates and scheming students to create a web of suspects the main character must weed through.

I enjoyed this version of DOA a LOT in its own right because the culprit was reveal to be a true PSYCHO! No I won't spoil the ending for you here but the ending to this version of DOA was beautiful, just beautiful.

Sure movie purists will tell you the original DOA is the best and this updated is a dud and in pure atmospherics and story telling they are likely right. I counter that this new DOA does not really bare comparing with the classic old DOA because; they are two different creatures in almost every way. In this updated DOA the killer is just plain nuts but in a very realistic shallow stupid year 2014 way. The killer in this DOA is actually vapid

A word I rarely get a chance to use in context. Vapid describes this DOA version killer as a person utterly devoid of any spark of creativity to call their own. This DOA became my all time favorite because it stirred such strong mixed emotions in me as it ended. I laughed, I cried, I thought, I was perplexedand finally I summed up my experience watching this version of DOA by just saying WOW!

Is this DOA better than the classic version my answer is no but not for the reason you might think. The method of murder using the luminous toxin is the same but almost everything else is different in ways that make easy comparrison difficult \ meaningless. This DOA update stands on its own as a who done it that is at once very funny weird and serious.

Watch this with a big bowl of buttered popcorn & the original D.O.A.

SPOILER ALERT
A man staggers into the police station to report a murder. When the desk sergeant asks who was murdered, he answers: ""I was.""

That man is Professor Dexter Cornell (Dennis Quaid), who then sits down to video-tape his account.

Thirty-six hours previously, Cornell is on campus. He is a college professor, was once a promising writer, made his name and is secure in his tenure, but he has spent the last four years going though the motions and playing it safe. ""Publish or perish"" is the contrasting rule of university politics and Cornell helps his friend Hal Petersham (Daniel Stern) with his first book.

While he is in his office, a promising student, Nick Lang (Robert Knepper), jumps off a building right outside his office in an apparent suicide. This, coupled with the depressing Christmas season, unseasonably hot weather and the divorce papers given to him by his wife Gail (Jane Kaczmarek) leads Cornell to seek out the local bars for a night of drinking. There he meets admiring student Sydney Fuller (Meg Ryan) and they proceed to get drunk.

The next morning, Cornell, feeling his sickness is more than just a hangover, stops by the campus medical clinic for a checkup. After running some tests, they discover that he has been poisoned and has 36 hours to live. An incredulous Cornell staggers out to try to make sense of it all.

Aided by Fuller, whom he kidnaps by super-gluing himself to her arm, he attempts to recreate the events of the previous night hoping to discover who could have murdered him. The list of suspects includes his wife, who is also the victim of a murder, which the police make half-hearted efforts to pin on Cornell.

It is learned that Lang was not a suicide but was also murdered. Cornell also suspects Lang's mentor Mrs. Fitzwaring (Charlotte Rampling), Bernard (Christopher Neame) the Fitzwarings' chauffeur and Graham Corey (Jay Patterson), a jealous co-worker.

In the end, at the police station, Cornell has solved the crime. He staggers out to meet his fate.",1443398400,,5470,4.574642126789366

7902134,4,B0000022L1,"I don't know which pushes the limits of cerebral capacity more: figuring out your Alternative Minimum Tax or the plot of this movie. The opening shot in black and white is certainly an eye-opener. (The opener apparently references the film noir classic of the same title, D.O.A., 1949-1950, but the 1988 offering is not a remake) Prof Dexter Cornell, played by Dennis Quaid, stumbles into a police station to report a murder. The first question of course is who was murdered to which Quaid responds with his memorable but simple answer, ""I was."" Quaid plays an English professor-novelist who says, at some point, that English professors don't inspire the kind of passion to be victims of premeditated murders, which is I guess the point of D.O.A.: not even English professors are completely without risk. But don't let this movie fool you. Being an English professor is sort of like flying, it's one of the safest ways to travel.

The rest of the movie is a flashback entirely from Cornell's point of view in which the events leading up to his entry into the police precinct are retraced, which turns out to be two days. The movie shifts back into color, and we are taken back to the morning of two days ago in Cornell's writing class. The first hint of a plot is an unpublished novel written by one of Cornell's students, Nick Lang. Cornell had promised to read the work but delayed. After class, when Cornell is dashing off, presumably to another class or a meeting, Lang runs after him through the halls begging him to read his work. At one point, the student says he will kill himself if the prof dislikes his novel. A couple of scenes later, guess what? Lang is turned into mush, presumably having killed himself by throwing himself from an undergrad dorm window. Cornell's office just happens to be underneath, and the body hits the window before becoming a human pancake. (I have never heard of student dorms being above professor's offices on a college campus, but that is one of the many strange coincidences that permeate this film.) The incident does not stop Cornell and one of his colleagues from celebrating in his office shortly thereafter.

But this is just the beginning. A whole back-story about Lang emerges about him having been put through college on the tab of an older wealthy lady who shot a prowler-thief in her house 20 years previous to the events of the movie. As an interesting twist, it turns out Lang is the son of the slain thief. On top of that, Cornell's marriage is ending. He gives his soon-to-be ex-wife a toy Ferris Wheel and she gives him the divorce papers, a rather odd exchange of Christmas presents. They attend a university social function where he makes a drunken fool of himself. But to add to the twists, the event is sponsored by guess who? The lady financing the late student-writer.

It is never fully explained exactly what Cornell writes. We gather he had 4 or 5 successful books, probably novels, but has had nothing for the last four years. But what he is good at is the bottle. He goes to a bar and encounters a young woman who turns out to be the daughter of the lady of the student who killed himself. It's starting to sound like the nursery rhyme ""The Old Woman Who Swallowed a Fly."" The girl is dragged out from the bar by one of the lady's henchmen leaving Cornell to his own devices. But he is not alone. He ends up drinking himself into a frenzy with one of his students, played by Meg Ryan.

Next morning, he wakes up in Ryan's freshmen women's dorm room. One of thing about this movie: Quaid keeps waking up in places after having conked out. Luckily, he did nothing that would be reported in the gossip column of the university newspaper and jeopardize his tenure. But he feels worse than having a hang-over. He drags himself to the university hospital only to find that he has been poisoned. The lethal chemistry has been absorbed by the body enough that he only has 24 to 48 hours to live. And now he has to find out not only the who but the why. Sort of like a Clue game for geniuses, DOA has many pieces of the puzzle, and Cornell has to figure out their arrangement before he falls over for the last time, and not just from the numerous shaken-not-stirred martinis. Martinis and poison go well together to accelerate the demise of the poor victim. When the pieces start falling into place, they are like nothing you would expect.

The film moves a mile-a-minute, with people getting knocked over the head with things, people chasing through tar pits, and of course a short episode at the compulsory carnival. Seems like suspense movies from the 1980's until the mid-1990's always have a scene where the protagonist is stumbling through a carnival or bizarre of some sort late in the evening to add to his already dazed-and-confused condition. Some of the action is a bit unbelievable but what saves it are the fine performances of all the leads, particularly Quaid who keeps you wanting to find out with him what is really going on. Certainly not the best movie of its type, but it has a look and feel all its own. So take a break from trying to figure out your Alternative Minimum Tax depreciations and check this film out.",1433030400,,5194,4.592672413793103
