2423075,5,B000BKVRIS,"In the short story by Machado de Assis, A Famous Man, Pestana is a famous composer of polkas. His songs fell in love the common people, were whistles and played everywhere. Pestana but was not a happy man. Dreamed of having a book-sized, soft music on the level of the great masters, but only went out of their feathers polkas. Each time he threw one, was roaring success ""bestowed by the whistle."" Pestana always wanted to make something elaborate and high, was a celebrity, but was not satisfied with life. ""Die well with men and bad about yourself."" Pestana, in the words of Machado ""He dove at the Jordan without leaving baptized."" Jacques Offenbach is the Pestana French? Composed operettas of roaring success. Satirized everyone and everything, screwed up a Brazilian in the operetta La Vie Parisienne. The success brought wealth, but Offenbach was not happy with his operettas. I wanted to prove he could write serious music. Les Contes d'Hoffmann is his attempt to match the great geniuses of music. Does the end of Offenbach was equal to the Pestana?

There are several versions of this title on video, each director has their personal reading. Les Contes d'Hoffmann is an open work, with endless possibilities.

Director Robert Carsen hits on the fly. His reading modernizes the action, all are savvy and active. Theater that combines with the libretto. The scenery is magnificent, turn, fit with each piece of the plot. Of singular beauty, made me fall face down.

The opera requires a huge cast, parade soprano, mezzo, tenor and baritone all the time. Agreed on the choices. Recall that Les Contes d'Hoffmann are three operas in one. Neil Schicoff is superb. I already knew the non-commercial version of the Scala of Milan and Hoffmann His voice is a single entity. Bryn Terfel is a Lindorf Copplius + + + Dr. Miracle Dapertutto (Phew!) Baritonal voice that tends to treble, but scenically it dominates the character, making it dark and scary. Susanne Mentzer is a La Muse + Nicklausse perfect, what a beautiful tone!

Dsirr Rancatore Olympia is a doll with acute and coloraturas to spare. The Antonia Ruth Ann Swenson has the voice dark, delicate and seductive. But the main is restricted to the Giulietta. The Barcarole, ""Belle nuit,  nuit d'amour"" opens the curtains, red chairs of a fictional drama move. The bacchanal begins slowly and is gaining strength. Applause when the curtain rises, one of the most beautiful scenes recorded on video that this scribe has seen so far. Beatrice Uria-Monzon believes that the character is of dubious reputation, and does so magnificently. She seduces Hoffmann filled with serious and portentous: who would not deliver her to a shadow of mulhero.

Musically, Les Contes d'Hoffmann follows the style opra-lyrique. It tells the story of the poet who takes one and the other in a bar and will tell their amorous adventures. Describes three of them, and their loss to be a malevolent. At the bar, waiting for his muse, Stella, who is singing the opera Don Giovanni by Mozart at the theater next door. Drunk and out of you loses again to his beloved Lindorf. La Muse appears, forces the poet to love his art.

The orchestral writing numbers has well defined. Music with effortless style, each act follows a pattern. Nice melodies that mark and love. Les Contes d'Hoffmann had numerous versions of this century, each in its own way has set up an unfinished opera by Offenbach. Editing Michel Kaye is the latest and is based on manuscripts found in private collection.

The success of the opera, its music and theatricality can say that Offenbach operettas of success and made a single serious opra-lyrique, of international fame. Quite different from that produced only Pestana polkas. Too bad it died before its premiere.

Portuguese:

No conto de Machado de Assis, Um Homem Clebre, Pestana  um famoso compositor de polcas. Suas canes caam no gosto do povo, eram assoviadas e tocadas por todos os cantos. Mas Pestana no era um homem feliz. Sonhava em ter uma obra de porte, msica erudita no nvel dos grandes mestres, mas de suas penas s saam polcas. Cada vez que ele lanava uma, era sucesso estrondoso""consagradas pelo assobio"". Pestana sempre quis compor algo elaborado e elevado, era uma celebridade, mas no estava satisfeito com a vida.""Morre bem com os homens e mal consigo mesmo"". Pestana, nas palavras de Machado "" Mergulhava naquele Jordo sem sair batizado"". Jacques Offenbach  o Pestana francs? Compunha operetas de sucesso estrondoso. Satirizava tudo e a todos, sacaneou at um brasileiro na opereta La vie Parisienne. O sucesso lhe trouxe riqueza, mas Offenbach no estava feliz com suas operetas. Queria provar que podia compor msica sria. Les Contes d'Hoffmann  sua tentativa de se igualar aos grandes gnios da msica. Ser que o fim de Offenbach foi igual ao do Pestana?

Existem diversas verses desse ttulo em vdeo, cada diretor fez sua leitura pessoal. Les Contes d'Hoffmann  uma obra aberta, com infinitas possibilidades.

O diretor Robert Carsen acerta na mosca. Sua leitura moderniza a ao, todos so descolados e atuantes. Teatro que combina com o libreto. Os cenrios so magnficos, se transformam, encaixam com cada pedao do enredo. De beleza mpar, fizeram-me cair a cara no cho.

A pera exige um elenco enorme, desfilam sopranos, mezzos, tenores e bartonos a toda hora. Acertaram nas escolhas. Lembremos que Les Contes d'Hoffmann so trs peras em uma. Neil Schicoff est soberbo. J o conhecia na verso no-comercial do Scala de Milo. Sua voz e Hoffmann so uma entidade nica. Bryn Terfel  um Lindorf + Copplius+ Dr. Miracle + Dapertutto (Ufa!) de voz baritonal que tende para os agudos, mas cenicamente ele domina o personagem , fazendo-o sombrio e assustador. Susanne Mentzer faz uma La Muse + Nicklausse perfeita, que belo timbre!

Dsirr Rancatore  uma boneca Olympia com agudos e coloraturas de sobra. A Antonia de Ruth Ann Swenson tem voz escura , delicada e sedutora. Mas o principal fica reservado  Giulietta. A Barcarole, ""Belle nuit ,  nuit d'amour"" abre as cortinas, cadeiras vermelhas de um fictcio teatro se movimentam. O bacanal comea aos poucos e vai ganhando fora. Aplausos quando as cortinas se abrem, uma das mais belas cenas gravadas em vdeo que este escriba assistiu at o presente momento. Batriz Uria-Monzon entende que a personagem  de reputao duvidosa,e a faz de forma magnfica. Seduz Hoffmann com graves cheios e portentosos: quem no entregaria sua sombra a um mulhero desses.

Musicalmente, Les Contes d'Hoffmann segue o estlo opra-lyrique. Conta a histria do poeta que toma umas e outras em um bar e vai contando suas aventuras amorosas. Descreve trs delas, e a sua perda para um ser malvolo. No bar, espera sua musa Stella, que est cantando a pera Don Giovanni, de Mozart, no teatro ao lado. Bbado e fora de si acaba perdendo mais uma vez para Lindorf sua amada. La Muse aparece, obriga o poeta a amar sua arte.

Os nmeros tem escrita orquestral bem definida. Msica com estlo prprio, cada ato segue um padro. Melodias agradveis, que marcam e apaixonam. Les Contes d'Hoffmann teve numerosas verses nesse sculo, cada um a sua maneira montou a pera inacabada de Offenbach. A edio de Michel Kaye  a mais recente e se baseia em manuscritos encontrado em coleo particular.

Pelo sucesso da pera, pela sua msica e teatralidade podemos afirmar que Offenbach fez operetas de sucesso e uma nica opra-lyrique sria , de fama internacional. Bem diferente do Pestana que s produzia polcas . Pena que morreu antes de sua estria.",1287532800,7,7497,4.92936507936508
2423076,5,B000BKVRIS,"This is a very sexy, dark, death-ridden conception of this great opera.  Also, as others have said, one of the most complete musically, basically following the (somewhat flawed) Oeser edition.  The singing is generally very good, the orchestra lively, loud and appropriately driven.  I think Olivier Py's dark vision of the work is extremely effective in some parts and a little over-the-top in others (in the Giulietta act, for instance, the sex seems rather aimless and comes, I feel, at the wrong place).  But of the 9 DVDs of this opera I own this is certainly at or near the top, partly because it really makes you think about what this fantastic array of stories and songs could possibly mean, both in Offenbach's time and today.",1269302400,8,735,4.809523809523809
2423077,4,B000BKVRIS,"For some inexplicable reason this item is not availble through Amazon, but only their sellers. Inexplicable because this item is less than six months old.

To  be honest I dithered about purchasing it; of the singers I knew only three Petibon, Laho, and Denize. A clip of Petibon's Olympia was available for awhile on YouTube, I knew Denize from a production of the Carmelites, and Laho from a Glyndeboune production of Le Conte Ory. This is the only avaible DVD of the work, and Laho is hardly competition for Juan Diego Florez--a valiant attempt, but falling far short of the mark. Ultimately I decided to take the plunge and get it and as it turned out I made a wise decision. A bonus is a documentary of the making of the production. I found it extremely interesting. The conductor. Patrick Devin is quite aware of the ""new"" music that has been discovered so that while there is an editorial choice to be made, envitably no two Hoffmann's will be alike. The Diamond aria has been deleted, but the Barcarolle has been retained. Niklausse now has more music to sing and the role has become a major one. Even though this is not Paris it was performed in Geneva and is hence the most ""French"" Hoffmann in the catalogue and for me this is a major plus. Laho will never be accused of having a beautiful voice, but for much of the time he is up to the challenges as is Stella Doufexis, as Niklausse and the Muse. Petibon is a wonderful Olympia and is quite up to the difficulties of the role. Indeed that can be said of the remainder of the cast. Patrick Devin establishes brisk gallic tempi, but never at the expense of thse passages where explansiveness is needed. I must mention Nicolas Cavallier who sings all four villains. As Hoffmann's  nemesis he is superb.

The fly in the ointment for many will be the production by Olivier Py. It is far removed from any other production I have seen either in the theatre or DVD. It is essentially non-representational with the exception of the Antonia act. The weakest is the Giuletta act as it is simply not evocative of anything in particular. Having retained the Barcarolle he does nothing but that is at least preferable to the Carsen version with the chorus swaying in theatre seats. For many I suppose the most controversial directorial decision Py made was the use of nudity. If Petion is not naked she could be wearing a body stocking, but I would never testify to either. Others are in various states of undress, but only Petibon has a spotlight on her during the aria. Why the cross dressing? It makes no sense unless Py wanted to suggest a level of depravity that certainly would never have played in Offenback's time. The character of Luther is hardly a pivotal one, but why is he in drag?

Hoffmann is not an inexpensive opera to mount properly; apparently the Met was not successful with Bret Sher's current investiture. The Met also made some editorial decisions with the edition they performed so they offer more Choudons than Geneva. Since there will never be an Offenbach ""Hoffmann"", I suppose it is folly to argue for one over the other. Yet having Michael Kaye's edition it strikes me as perverse to ignore what he has made available. Devin and Py have made more of this than any other production and I for one am thrilled.",1266796800,9,3285,4.589437819420784
2423078,3,B000BKVRIS,"This production from the Geneva is about the most complete version we are likely to find today. It greatly expands the Guiletta act although it leaves out the Diamond aria which was not put there by Offenbach to begin with. The singers and the musical production are very good.
 The problem is the stage production. Olivier Py locates the opera in Offenbach's time when Paris was the city of lights. So most of the production has hundreds of white lights making up the set. They go on and off and form all sorts of dislays. The set moves quite frequently.
  The problem is that at least for me I have no idea what is is supposed to mean. It often doesn't serve the opera. And the Antonia act is so dark you can't see the singers. If you want a traditional Hoffman try the ROH with Domingo and directed by John Slessinger. For a more modern touch there is the Paris Opera version which takes place in the Paris Opera House.",1259971200,14,922,4.380116959064328
2423079,5,B000BKVRIS,This production is one of those which adheres to tradition but conforms to modern scholarship. The restored cuts clarify the action which is enhanced with the translation option. The Prologue is extended to intoduce the main characters of the opera. The Doll Scene follows in the same vein adding music which is cut from standard performances.,1258243200,4,343,5.142857142857143
2423080,4,B000BKVRIS,"I was taken aback by the previous reviewer's bashing of this VERY beautifully done Tales of Hoffmann, recorded live at the outdoor Macerata Arena in Italy.  Comparing it to both the older Covent Garden version with Placido Domingo (well sung, but an uninteresting, outdated production), and the newer one from the Paris Opera with Neil Shicoff (a glitzier performance but much of it bizarre to the point of being unsettling) I rate this one marginally highest of the three.

The singers, orchestra and chorus are, with very few exceptions, extremely satisfying.  The most impressive performances are the lovely, intensely moving Antonia [soprano Annalisa Raspagliosi], the commandingly sinister villains of famous Italian basso Ruggero Raimondi, whose voice is in great shape after a long, magnificent career, and the hilarious singing doll Olympia [soprano Desiree Rancatore -- her acting and conception of the role are absolutely riveting, although her upper register shows some signs of faulty vocal production.]  Also worth mentioning is Hoffmann's ""sidekick"" Nicklausse, mezzo Elsa Maurus; she is adorable and I've never heard it sung better.

Tenor Vincent La Scola in the title role is a convincing, sympathetic Hoffmann, solid throughout the opera.  Of course he doesn't have the creamy dark timbre of Domingo but his acting is much more natural and his singing/phrasing consistently enjoyable -- at times very beautiful (especially so in the 2nd Act Sextet.)  Conversely, he is not as dramatic as Neil Shicoff, but physically and vocally Shicoff just doesn't win me over as Hoffmann.  The only principal singer who falls a little short is Sara Allegretta as Giulietta; not bad at all, but not enough of a femme fatale in the role of the soul-stealing courtesan.

There are some other minor flaws in this version; Act 2 (with the afore-mentioned Giulietta) is not as successful as the rest of the opera, and a couple of the smaller roles could have been better done (esp. Antonia's unhappy father, Crespel and his comical servant Frantz who's good for some laughs but lacking vocally.  Both of those singers also have bit roles in the other acts which they handle somewhat better.)  Worst of all, in Act 1, the dancers' shoes squeak unnervingly loudly in their first number.

That aside, I saved the best for last.  Opera can be a hard medium to capture well on video, but whoever filmed this DVD had the knack of always being in exactly the right place at the right time.  Nowhere are those long close-ups prevalent in many other opera DVD's, where you end up looking down the singers' throats and watching their uvula quiver.  No, the cameras zoom out whenever there's a great panorama, zoom back in for all the good closeups, focus in on all the important action, and even show characters' REACTIONS to what is taking place --- brilliantly done!  This is all the more wonderful because the staging and directing are both visually appealing and dramatically fascinating.  This is an elegant, clever and powerful rendition of a real crowd-pleaser of an opera.  Add that all up and top it with the venue -- a stunning outdoor arena with an immense stage.  Really makes you wish you could have been in the audience seeing and hearing this production under the Italian night sky (and incidentally I would love to know where in Italy this was performed; none of the names on the cover or in the liner notes pinpoint the location.)

Out of the 3 most popular versions, this is the Tales of Hoffmann to own -- rent the other two.",1180051200,12,3532,4.934121621621622
2423081,2,B000BKVRIS,"This production is one of the more conceptless slap-dash, messy shows I have seen since my last community theatre show.

  The show has lots of strange imagery, im not sure why, The Villains are certainly vaudville demons of some kind, and the sets are difficult to understand.

  Certainly the most important failure here is some of the singing.  I couldn't complain enough about Raimondis flat, toneless villains.  he cannot phonate on the bottom tones, and his higher notes are screams without any trace of resonance.  The large majority of secondary singers have much more resonant voices.  His acting is way over the top and he parted ways with the orchestra many times.

  vicenzo La Scola was very general as hoffman.  He did not inspire any sort of pity.  His voice is very large for this part, and he added no touch of gentleness or pain to the tortured poet.  He looked fairly bored and lost onstage.

  Rancatore as Olympia was excellent as usual.

  A special thumbs up goes to Andrea Valis whose Janitors aria was some of the most hillarious schtick Ive seen.  (DID YOU HEAR THAT HIGH A?)

  --Probably a waste of money,

  The Domingo version is a great Classic reading and the Schicoff Terfel version is a great modern reading,

8088216,2,B000BKVRIS,"Warning, major spoilers ahead.

The problems plaguing this 2003 release do not include the singing.  Neil Shicoff is no stranger to a televised Hoffmann, having taken the part in 1988's Live From the Met production (alas, not on DVD).  His muse is Susanne Mentzer.  Earlier in her career Mentzer looked like Frederica von Stades successor as the foremost expert in trouser roles;  here she makes a chunky, butch Nicklausse, but she is in voice (her addition as Nicklausse was one of my foremost reasons for watching this version).  Bryn Terfel needs no qualifying, and hes perfect as the big, bad baritone characters.  The other singers are also quite good, including Dsire Rancatore as Olympia, not only singing well but hitting to perfection the intentionally slightly-off notes called for in her aria.

 I am personally dissatisfied is with the production itself.  I have no problem in recasting opera (or Shakespeare, or anything else, for that matter) in diverse settings.  The setting for this Hoffmann is modernesque.  Shicoff runs around in a worn suit and a necktie (it must be hard to sing in one of those), while the other characters are equally modernistic.  The chorus shows up in a wide array of styles, including suits, t-shirts, and . . . well, peculiar items.  In the mad scientist act, Olympia is operated by a remote control box, rather than wound with a key.  So far, so good.

Unfortunately, during her aria, Olympia engages in an act of simulated sex with the enraptured Hoffmann.  Later, when she is being destroyed, her wig and dress are stripped away and she runs on stage in a plastic naked suit (that looks about as real as body armor).  Its an intriguing staging of the Olympia sequence and it comes off well enough, but its not an interpretation I wish to see repeatedly.

And it gets worse.  In some places on stage the microphone is not picking up very well.  During one of the most beautiful songs ever written, the third acts barcarolle Belle nuit,  nuit d'amour, the staging consists of theater seats (at least, thats what I thought they were) moving back and forth, where Nicklausse and Giulietta sit down to sing.  I don't know how sitting in that posture and moving back and forth like they're on a fairground ride affects their singing; but occasionally one or the other winds up in that spot where the microphone does not pick them up perfectly and their voices fade.  While the barcarolle is going on the theater seats on stage fill with men and women doing all sorts of things to and with each other.  While this does not exceed the remit given by song itself, it is distracting from the singers (when you can hear them clearly); and while its good to have different perspectives on an opera, its a shame to throw out the Venetian setting, and a crime to risk distracting from the major performers at this point.

As far as staging goes, the most successful was Act II, which takes place on a stage on the stage, opening in what I took for an orchestra pit.  Unfortunately, from my perspective, Act II usually bores me and this was no exception.

If you like radically different takes on Hoffman this is the show for you.  As I said, the singing is quite good when everyone is on mike, and at rock bottom that is really the reason we enjoy opera.  However, if I may put in 2 cents, while Im not against untraditional performances (and this version could certainly be called regietheater), with the permanence of DVD and so few Hoffmanns in release it might be nice for the Powers That Be to  consider recording and issuing for posterity traditional stagings (for instance, the Venice scenes with Venice backgrounds),  without a lot of distraction from the singers.  It may be my perception, but it seems that more often it is regietheater novelties that make it to disk.  And novelties, however good they are, are enjoyed less on repeated viewings.  The only reason I see for having this version of Hoffmann on disk at all is the quality of the performers.  I might actually buy a cd release, if there is one.  I do not want to watch the show repeatedly on DVD, though I'm not sorry I saw it once.",1384905600,5,4138,4.650137741046832
8088217,5,B000BKVRIS,"My favorite production of this opera. Olivier Py is a little bit of a genius with his vision of Hoffmann; the clarity of the storytelling is what sets this production above others for me. The nudity is relevant, not gratuitous. The Antonia act is beautiful and breathtaking!",1351123200,,274,4.851063829787234
8088218,1,B000BKVRIS,"This stage production capitalizes on a destructive discovery: myriads of unfrosted light bulbs in a black background, combined with  clanking machinery, rivets the eye, triggers adrenalin flows and commands the full attention of the viewer.  This is aided by a clarity of photography that is lucid and startling.  The result is so successful it doesn't matter to us that the visuals unfold in brazen indifference to what the music is telling us.  We enjoy the two realms simultaneously, even though both are operating independently of one another.  We're galvanized, so we're happy --- or, at least the reviewers who gave this DVD 4 or 5 stars, are happy.  They get a buzz out of what they see and hear, and seem content that this production puts the two realms in parallel universes, where the visual routinely insults the well-rendered music.

This stage production is under the direction of Olivier Pye who, to quote a review in the International Record Review, ""hates beauty"".  He excels in throwing coarseness and ugliness around, relying on startling lighting and avant garde issues (frontal male nudity, lesbianism, cross dressing, simulated copulation with Olympia, Nicklause mirroring this copulation later) to thrill us with the thought that we're oh, so wicked, and among the emancipated elect.  This translates into ecited applause by the ""with it"" audience, always eager to see barriers going down.  Pye gets away with this in TALES OF HOFFMAN by pointing out Offenbach left no finished product, but this is a smoke screen for what he really cares about. His production of Gounod's ROMEO ET JULIETTE (Netherlands Opera, Amsterdam) provoked this review in the January, 2011 issue of Opera Magazine: ""On the whole it is a grim staging with a lot of violence and sordid scenes that don't really add anything to the piece; they don't concur with what the characters are singing or the music Gounod gave them."".  Exactly.  This is Pye's trademark and it's on display in this TALES OF HOFFMAN as well.  Other viewers have no objection to this, but I cry desecration of the spirit.

So many recent dvds of this opera have gone off the deep end and into the abyss: the Lyon Opera, the Paris Opera, the Opera de Bilboa --- with one staging the opera in an insane asylum, the three loves are presented as the ravings of a madman and the singers rushing around wearing white coats in a scary room with white, enamel walls --- a portrait of hell.  All these directors feel they have carte blanche to do whatever they want because it's all up for grabs.  There are no standards.  As long as the cast and orchestra are excellent, who can judge stage productions and rank one over another?  Anything goes, right?  Not so, and here I bring forward a reference production that shows the unalienable nobility that must be always be foremost in portraying Hoffman: the 1951 Beecham performance with Moira Shearer, now in vividly restored colour:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Tales-of-Hoffmann-The-Criterion-Collection/dp/B00008YOFG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Tales of Hoffmann (The Criterion Collection)</a>.  It has 43 five-star reviews --- 43 testimonies to enchantment. THIS is the reference film.

A dvd opera needs more than competent singing. The case for this is well made by the NEGATIVE 1 and 2 star Amazon viewers' reviews of this related production: Les contes d'Hoffman / Opera de Bilbao, with Guingal, Machado, Gorny (2007).  The issues raised by the 1 and 2 star reviews of that TALES OF HOFFMAN apply full strength to this one. They will make the case that Hoffman's nobility must not be sacrificed on any account; otherwise, reference points are gone and desecration results.

Before I sign off, I'd like to register my puzzlement at the unqualified acclaim given to Nicklausse in this production.  Her vocal gifts have swept away any critical appraisal of her acting abilities and her capacity to enter into the character, these being deficiences I consider sufficient to banish her from anything that welds a visual stage presence to the role.  Her acting repetoire consists of a standard set of smirks, coupled with the irritating mannerism of widening the eyes, leaning forward at the hips, and mugging at the audience in the unpolished manner that would antagonize us if we saw it in a low budget, high school farce.  Vocally secure, yes -- and fine on a CD; but for visual accomplishment, Nicklausse has to be entrusted to someone like the marvellous portrayal of Nicklausse in the Met production that has yet to make it onto DVD.

Meanwhile, consult the negative reviews of the Opera de Balboa production I mentioned in the previous paragraph.  They apply here and will quickly lead to a positive result re: a confident buying choice.  After all, $41 plus postage is what can go down the drain if you buy this one and are dismayed. It'll be worth the extra 5 minutes to get a fuller perspective.",1320537600,7,4966,5.051470588235294
8088219,5,B000BKVRIS,"That this production of Tales of Hoffmann should come out the hotbed of Calvinist fundamentalism (Geneva, Sw.) is ironic since it is probably closest to how Offenbach would have wanted it done, with the nudity of Gay 90's Paris and his incomparable music in a story of l'amour, la mort, et le desire, (love, death and desire), I found it fascinating and far superior to the Met's recent production.  Offenbach never saw his opera produced, probably despairing of the rigid rules in the old Paris Opera.  I found it profound, refreshing and enlightening. It's a celebration of basic human instincts, too long suppressed. The Met needs to come into the 21st Century.  CM Fox",1317168000,2,672,4.87719298245614
8088220,5,B000BKVRIS,"Where do I begin! For starters, this is the Fritz Oeser version performed here,claiming Five Acts. Well in fact it is three acts with prologue & epilogue.
Secondly; you need to be very broad minded as this production contains nudity.
This production explores the darker side of Hoffmann.
The staging is quite staggering and elaborate with its illuminating rotating mechanical sets and multi-layered stage. The costumes are quite inventive and fit in quite well. Those of you who have read my reviews in the past will be aware that I do not like modern productions of opera. I was convinced that I would not like it. But after watching it, I had to concede it actually worked. The image and sound quality is exceptional; which brings me to the cast; most of whom are unknown to me. Marc Laho (Hoffmann) is new to me and is well cast in the title role. His tone seems to be nurtured for this part. Stella Doufexis (Muse/Nicklause) what can I say. This woman is incredible. She has more to sing than anyone and the voice is as fresh at the end as it is in the beginning. Nicolas Cavallier (the four protagonists) holds his own throughout the production, using his stage craft to good advantage. In this production there are four individual women playing the roles of Olympia (Patricia Petibon), Antonio (Rachel Harnish), Giuletta (Maria Riccarda Wesseling) & Stella (Delphine Beaulieu) each brilliant in their respective roles. Eric Huchet (the four tenor comique parts) is brilliant to say the least. The remaining cast members & chorus are equally convincing.
You really have to see this version to appreciate it. It would take pages for me to explain it fully, but if an old traditionalist like me can enjoy it and I would happily have paid top dollar to see it; you should not have any trouble. Because of the nudity, I would restrict children from watching it as this really is an adults only version portrayed here. Buy, enjoy and see Hoffmann in a different light.",1294963200,12,1968,4.740524781341108
