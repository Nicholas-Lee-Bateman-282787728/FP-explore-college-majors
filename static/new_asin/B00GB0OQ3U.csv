I wanted to like this because the basics of the story were really very creative but my goodness it was just awful. The lead role actress was good, I have to say that, but not one other person in this film could act and that is a generous way of wording it.",1388620800,4,363,3.727272727272727

I guess if you like this kind of stuff you'll rate it higher.  However, if you have any pragmatism in you, you will quickly bore of this utterly mind numbing movie.

6069689,4,B00GB0OQ3U,"""The Banshee Chapter"" is one of those little jewels that are being dropped into the wild by the independent creators who will eventually run rings around the usual boring tripe that Hollywood produces. Based on real documents about various government-sponsored experiments with drugs like LSD and DMT, this story takes things a step further and hints at very dark and evil things happening behind the scenes. An investigative reporter decides to find out what happened to an old college classmate who has obtained one of these drugs and has taken it- and disappeared. The story is as much a psychological thriller as it is an old-school horror movie- with jumps aplenty, but also a premise that will haunt you long after the movie is ended- especially if you have read anything about MK-Ultra. And you'll never listen to a numbers station quite the same way again.

Katia Winter plays the reporter, with Michael McMillian as her missing friend, and an excellent turn by Ted Levine as the Hunter Thompson-esque writer who aids her in her quest.",1387843200,4,1043,4.926136363636363
6069690,5,B00GB0OQ3U,This is a good movie to get some friends and just watch. Typical jump scares and traditional scare tactics inside an interesting mystery thriller.

I have NO idea what the Banshee Chapter means nor is it mentioned in the movie (from my recollection) so lets give it a better title that fits more aptly like ""Chamber 5"" or ""what Ever Happened to....?""  A trip through a journalist quest to uncover the truth about cover-ups, radio transmissions and the desert in Arizona - on the edge of my seat for most of the movie and out of my seat at least 3 times!  Truly enjoyed the story, the actors were ALL spot on excellent (you'll remember Ted Levine from the unique sound of his voice, always loved him in movies too).

This whole thing is a good example of a movie that is unsettling because of what you *don't* see, and doesn't fall into the annoying trap of trying to explain everything to you. As the viewer you are caught up in the story with the lead (who does a great job) and really, unsettling and creepy is the best way I can think of to describe this.

6069701,5,B00GB0OQ3U,"This is great. Easily one of my favorite horror films of the past few years. This movie does several things that are often missing from horror films. First it makes you curious, and then it builds a sense of true dread as the events unfold. It is not without itsaying share of jump scares, but it successfully creeps you out while leaving you unsure of exactly what it was you just saw. Finally it does not insult the viewers intelegence, as it weaves multiple thread together throughout the course of the film.

It's not really a found footage movie, but it does use some ""real footage"" in weaving this tale of supernatural horror.

6069709,3,B00GB0OQ3U,"The is a pretty decent nail-biter, loosely based-upon or an homage to H.P. Lovecraft's ""From Beyond."" Our heroine Anne (Katia Winter) decides to investigate the disappearance of her college bestie (lover?) James, who himself was investigating admissions by the U.S. Government that it experimented on its own people with hallucinogenic drugs. James' on-video experiment with one such substance is the last record of him before he disappears.

Anne's investigation draws her to Thomas Blackburn (Ted Levine), a gonzo, mentally-unstable, drug-experimenting author (think Hunter Thompson meets Philip Dick) and the aforementioned government program that's at the core of the story.

Winter and Levine's performances are the highlight of the movie, but director Blair Erickson manages to deliver consistent scares throughout.

However, I have to complain a bit about the movie's shifting format. It stars as documentary-style, following James' recorded and edited file. Then as Anne enters the picture, it continues in a found-footage manner as she self-records her own journey. About 1/3 of the way in, it completely abandons documentary and found-footage to continue the story in a more traditional linear narrative. I couldn't figure out if this was an intentional stylistic decision by the director, or whether they realized that the found-footage approach could not be sustained and subtly tried to abandon it mid-way through. It was jarring and distracting and I think the movie suffers for it.

Overall, it's not intensely scary, and doesn't stay with you very long, it its a decent enough diversion. It might work better with some mind-altering substances.",1444867200,,1660,5.5236220472440944

6069713,5,B00GB0OQ3U,"A great mixture of H.P. Lovecraft, the CIA's MK ULTRA mind-control experiments, the mysterious unknown numbers stations, and Hunter S. Thompson.  I watched this movie for free on Netflix and enjoyed it so much that I bought the DVD.  Ted Levine, of ""Silence of the Lambs"" fame, does a fabulous job of portraying the Hunter S. Thompson-inspired character and he steals the show.  The interweaving of H.P. Lovecraft's ""From Beyond"" with the MK ULTRA experiments was perfect and it worked great.

For a low-budget movie, this one delivered more than major motion pictures.

By the way, the ""Lonely Traveler"" station that is featured in the movie is an actual unknown number station called ""Swedish Rhapsody"" in the community.  You can find actual recordings of that station on the internet if you search for ""Swedish Rhapsody Station"" or ""Conet Project.""",1438300800,11,851,5.086330935251799

6069715,2,B00GB0OQ3U,"I was disappointed in this movie, though it was delivered on time and for a good price.
I had watched another of this group's macabre movies, The Conspiracy, and thoroughly enjoyed it.  It blended urban legends,
conspiracy wackos and historical fact.  This one's theme promised an excellent movie, but the movie seemed more like
a cheap college course exercise.  In addition, there were no subtitles.  I am hard of hearing, and the louder I cranked
up the volume, the softer everyone talked.  In consequence, I found it hard to follow.",1431561600,,535,4.9
6069716,5,B00GB0OQ3U,"The story in The Banshee Chapter creates an almost instantly captivating tale around urban legends that arose after it was made public of the black ops experiments the Government implemented on citizens during the 60s and 70s using LSD. That is a conspiracy lore ideology that I find myself trolling the internet reading. This element weaves eerily effortlessly into the Lovecraft world of horror, particularly the story surrounding the scientist that creates an antenna that becomes a gateway between worlds ultimately allowing both sides to move between. The Banshee Chapter pushes out a dark, nightmare that stays serious, flows nicely, and maintains a chilling atmosphere from start to finish without becoming boring.

The acting in this film is pretty stellar, not too melodramatic or forced but so polished that it just seems over-rehearsed. The transitions between the found footage scenes and the standard third person point-of-view are balanced and move smoothly without the effects being made into some big production. The special effects and soundtrack in The Banshee Chapter both work nicely in creating a chilling, and entertaining atmosphere with moments that are gripping, and intense while feeling creepy as heck. The special effects are the usual gimmicks and tricks to create shock moments and suspense but the director maintains control of the elements so nothing looks cheap or pointless, or more importantly lacking.",1431129600,2,1437,5.415178571428571
6069717,5,B00GB0OQ3U,An interesting and scary movie. And the surpriz at the end with katia winter.,1430784000,2,77,4.571428571428571
6069718,4,B00GB0OQ3U,"Although the cover art for Banshee Chapter implies that it's something of a creature feature, there is really very little body horror in this production. Instead, we've got something closer to the Area 51, desert lab, and secret project atmosphere. The inspiration came from the true-life MK Ultra projects carried out by the CIA in the early 1960s. Mind altering substances and hallucinations play a seminal part in the plot: in the fictional present day, a young experimenter ingests a vial of the legendary hallucinogen and disappears. The story then takes up the quest to find him in isolated stretches of New Mexico desert (the movie was filmed near Socorro).

The production is enhanced by some great acting and characterization by Katia Winter, who plays an investigative reporter, and Ted Levine, whose character (a desert eccentric, Hunter S. Thompson type) is a highlight of this production. They uncover some weirdness which takes on overtones of H.P. Lovecraft's 'From Beyond', all woven into the government conspiracy backdrop.

Visually, the film is a patchwork quilt of video, standard 35mm, and infrared cams (hey, it's dark in the desert at night). The visual editing is not the most artful of constructions, but it suits the mood of the film. A few of you may have arrived at this review through the Lovecraft connection, but be advised that Banshee Chapter does not have the look and feel of more traditional Lovecraft adaptations, though the mental connection with H.P.'s nether-worldly outlook is clear (and acknowledged by the director),  and has a certain charm here.

There are extras in the form of  interviews with Director/Writer Blair Erickson, Katia Winter, and other production staff.  While the film itself is not the strongest 4-star affair, these extras enhance the DVD experience.",1426377600,,1814,5.174061433447099

6069723,5,B00GB0OQ3U,"Banshee Chapter is a low-budget horror film that creeps up on you, and lingers. In true Lovecraftian style, many stages of dread are introduced and drawn out. There are a few good jump scares for the adrenaline junkies. What made me love this movie is all of the real sights, sounds and events used to tell the story. Google video for ""Swedish Rhapsody"" to get an idea of the creep factor ... it is a real, working ""numbers station"" that's been around since I was a child. Shortwave radio enthusiasts will love this movie! One character is obviously based on Hunter S. Thompson who had a reputation for using plenty of hallucinogenic drugs; in this story he uses MKUltra, which is a real experimental drug so horrible that President Bill Clinton had to actually apologize to the world for the CIA experimenting with it on unknowing and unwilling subjects, when the Freedom of Information Act opened the files to the public. Add in Ted Levine's unmistakably deep, haunting voice (I'll let you get chills when you finally recognize who he's played before) and you've got major creep factors that will keep coming back to you for a while.

Because I loved hunting for numbers stations on shortwave as a child, this is the first horror movie to EVER have given me nightmares (and I've watched everything from Beyond The Black Rainbow to The Ring to Martyrs to Salo). Banshee Chapter is also even better upon a second -or third - viewing, because there are so many little things you will miss the first time that pop out at you.

6069731,4,B00GB0OQ3U,"""Banshee Chapter"" succeeds in being original, even as an entry in the ""found footage"" genre.  This movie shows that you don't need a huge budget if you have a compelling story and excellent actors.

""Banshee Chapter"" mixes real MK-Ultra history and real numbers stations (see the Conet Project for more information) with a fictional twist that is the conceit of this film - one particular drug tested during MK-Ultra results in the victims (er, subjects) seeing ""it,"" and that it sees them back.  Then it kills them.

This movie is refreshing in that it is neither unrelentingly grim nor jokey/comedic.  A very thinly veiled ""Hunter S. Thompson"" shows up about 30 minutes into the movie, and significantly livens up the proceedings.  Fans of ""Monk"" will appreciate that Ted Levine, who played Captain Stottlemeyer on that show, plays HST so well that you don't realize for a long time that it's him.  His presence is in many ways the solid center of this movie, around which the other weirdness is built.

On the downside, this movie relies a little too much on the ""something is hiding over here behind you just out of frame"" technique of scaring you.  I found the ending somewhat unsatisfactory, hence knocking off a star.  However, in fairness to the film, I don't know that they could have ended it differently.

Perhaps the scariest thing about this movie is the clips of 1970s vintage interviews with some of the actual MK-Ultra scientists.  (Some come from news reports, during a time when TV news actually committed occasional acts of journalism.  Others are clips from the Church Commission.)  American Mengeles to a man, they didn't care about the subjects they experimented on, whether they were hippies or Vietnam vets.  They were nothing more than lab rats in the War Against Communism.

This is definitely worth at least a rent.  Also, when it comes to the real MK-Ultra and the Church Commission, read more about it.  There are plenty of resources here on Amazon and elsewhere.",1407974400,3,1992,4.877976190476191

I'm not against the use of jump scares in such a narrative - especially one which primarily takes place at night - but when you start to anticipate said scares then they're detracting from the action.  And it feels a little too compressed to me, more time should have elapsed between the initial setup and Anne meeting Thomas Blackburn, though I understand this could have been due to the truncated shooting schedule.  But the end twists are definitely satisfying, and as I noted it is an excellent high concept - I find myself wishing someone could write a tie-in novel that elaborates on those plot points which are only briefly glimpsed in the film because it is a wonderfully creepy story with enormous potential.  I thought the found footage aspect was particularly well-done.  The best scene (IMO) is the very essence of the horror story a priori: as Anne investigates Callie's seemingly empty house, alone in the dark, Thomas relates the plot of Lovecraft's ""From Beyond"" on the two-way radio.",1406505600,2,1205,4.665094339622642

Director: Blair Erickson
Stars: Katia Winter and Ted Levine

 The BANSHEE CHAPTER is a Half fiction/Half documentary horror film that involves a project developed by the U.S government called MKUltra. The project having already existed of course was nothing to be compared to what we see in the film, which implies injecting a drug to a number of random patients in order to make them hallucinate. But going further into analyzing it would require much more reading for the moment.

Suggesting that the drug would make people more aware of their surroundings, it starts with a Young writer having been able through his contacts to put his hands on a dose of the said drug. Soon after he injects it, he disappears without leaving a trace. An old friend of his, reporter Anne Roland (The Lovely and Talented Katia Winter) sets out to uncover the truth about her friend's disappearance and about the drug by the same way.

If you've seen a little of T.V series Dexter and Sleepy Hollow or if you already follow them you probably know Katia Winter more than i do at the time but i liked her in this one. THE BANSHEE CHAPTER being a Half fiction/Half truth investigation, i doubt that fans of this type of horror movies will get out of this one having found a new favourite but this is more than Worth the Watch imo. The movie relies a lot on mystery and suspense, showing us threats but only in a calculated dose that you won't see or understand who or what is stalking its protagonists really clearly. But it does it well. Will result of this a couple good scenes of anticipation, a kind of thing that not many mystery horror or even slashers have done as effectively as the Extreme John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN in 1978. If you watched Halloween, you know what anticipation i talk about. There were other movies but quite Frankly, i think that Banshee Chapter plots its scares really well. And ain't that all that matters in a film like this one?

1. No subtitles; poor audio levels; poor enunciation. Doesn't matter because no one cares what's being said. Really bad acting.
2. Stolen script premise of journalist investigating missing person using newly found lost film/video of the event.
3. Use of the now heavily trodden by film crews of an underground bunker (or just anything that looks underground like a hallway anywhere).

This movie thankfully stops short of delving into the government conspiracy route, and it also avoids the cliche of every other POV film. In fairness, only parts of the film are shot that way (but those parts are the most frightening). This movie is legitimately scary, in both the creepy way and the sudden urge to jump kind of way. That's not to say it goes for cheap thrills; quite the contrary. You think the movie will go one way, and it takes a drastic turn to unimaginable places.

The character development is better than most movies, and I found myself actually caring about what happened to the folks in the movie. The plot was clever, and it made for a good show. Would you like me to now rehash the plot? Tough. Watch the trailer.

As for the cinematography, who gives a bucket of camel urine? I'm tired of sifting through HUNDREDS of reviews reading about whether or not the film was well directed, and who did the soundtrack, and if the cinematography was up to the reviewers standards. I just want to know, ""Is this a good enough movie for me to waste a few dollars on?"" Yes. It's worth spending a couple bucks on. I don't even know what cinematography is. Set your beret down, kick off your teva sandals and just enjoy watching a pretty good movie.",1391644800,5,1106,4.448275862068965
6069772,5,B00GB0OQ3U,"I discovered this movie by chance. I was browsing a site that listed upcoming movies being released to DVD/Blu Ray. I saw this and it intrigued me. So I watched the trailer and was stoked to see the film. I read that it was loosely based on ""From Beyond"" by the great H.P. Lovecraft. That made me even more excited because I love the creeping terror of many Lovecraft works. I saw the low score on this site and that only slightly put me off. But I saw that the critics were giving the movie positive feedback, something that doesn't happen often in the horror genre. So the movie comes out and I buy it and wait till the night comes to watch it. Boy was this a horror gem.

Plot Synopsis. The movie revolves around a journalist who discovers that her college friend has disappeared after taking a hallucinatory drug that the CIA used to experiment with on humans during the MKUltra project. After taking the drug a radio suddenly broadcasts a creepy numbers station signal of unknown origin before ""something"" comes and takes the person. She goes on a journey to figure out what happened and is joined along the way by a Hunter S. Thompson inspired character who uses the drug regularly. On the journey there are supernatural happenings and creepy CIA footage of patients from the MKUltra era. What the two discover is beyond belief and terrifying.

The movie uses found footage sometimes, but don't be fooled. This is not a found footage movie. There are instances where the film cuts to creepy fake documentary footage as well. But for the most part, the movie is directed in a way that can best be described as a combination of traditional film making and found footage. The directing style for these scenes I speak of is masterful especially for the low budget. The darkness that filled the screen a lot got annoying at first, but it actually becomes another character in the movie. The scariest scenes are the scenes in the darkness that don't show the monster or only show slight glimpses of it. The creeping feeling one gets from these scenes is done so well. There are many jump scares. Even if you don't get a glimpse of the entity shown during some of the jump scares, they still work. Some are cheap scares, but most are clever and truly terrifying scares. The music was also perfectly done. Very eerie and sometimes relaxing to the point of utter creepiness. The numbers station broadcast that plays to warn you that the entity is coming is one of the creepiest and original horror movie ideas I've ever seen or heard. The sounds heard are just discomforting and well crafted. The acting is also terrific from everyone. This is a low budge movie, but there are some veteran actors such as Ted Levine who plays the crucial Hunter S. Thompson type character amazingly and humorously. Those don't recognize the name will know his face from ""Silence of the Lambs"" and his voice from the now classic horror movie ""Joy Ride"". For such a low budget virtually unknown movie, all the actors and actresses give great performances. I have to say again that the style of directing is so original and clever. Sometimes it gets annoying and maybe boring during the long shots, but the payoff is worth it.

This movie will stick with you. The images seen will keep some people up at night. The radio broadcast sound will dig deep. I can tell that this movie will slowly become the cult horror classic it is destined to be. I look forward to the work from this new director as he gets into slightly bigger budgeted films. I do have one complaint that many might also have with the DVD. If not watching on Netflix when it comes out there, many will probably be seeing this on DVD. But the problem I had was that there were no subtitles. I don't have trouble hearing, but some of the dialogue was hard to understand or hear clearly even when blown up to a high volume. But that is just a minor issue. So buy or rent this horror movie if you need a good creepy scare for the night that will stick with you. Just be prepared to pay attention because you could miss things if not!",1391558400,22,4072,4.522388059701493

6069776,4,B00GB0OQ3U,"H.P. Lovecraft, Hunter S. Thompson, number stations, conspiracy theories... this movie picks from a variety of influences and reshapes them into a fresh and wicked creepy indie horror movie.  Despite what you may think given the trailer, this is not a found footage film.  The camera is never justified, and the person holding it is never acknowledged.  The view is shaky and claustrophobic, but that is an aesthetic choice rather than dictated by the format of the film.  This really worked well, and Banshee Chapter is one of very few horror films that has a dense enough atmosphere to freak me out.  Also, in a rare feat of success for the horror genre, I even found the movie's ending satisfying.  The actors were great and the characters were stand-out.

I took off one star for a few small reasons.  First, the camera work, while really adding to the intensity, still made me a bit motion sick, though far less than, say, Paranormal Activity.  If shaky-cam does this to you, be ready for it in this one as well.  Also, the ending didn't entirely make sense.  I won't say that it detracted from the film, but it left me scratching my head a bit.

8621903,5,B00GB0OQ3U,This is a really creepy movie on a premise that I've never heard of before.  It kept me guessing and made me jump more than once.  Great if you like strange and unusual story lines.,1525305600,,181,4.142857142857143
8621904,5,B00GB0OQ3U,"this movie, i had to walk away almost at the start for a moment, it got me, and movies never give me that creep vibe, good job banshee chapter. definately not a watch alone at night kind of movie the first time watching. even covered my eyes a couple times. near the end broke my heart also. so got my scares and my heart feelings all in one movie. i would recommend anyone to watch this.",1524960000,,388,4.118421052631579
8621905,2,B00GB0OQ3U,"Banshee Chapter has surprisingly good performances for direct-to-video horror, but it doesn't have much else going for it. The script is loaded with unnecessary exposition, and repeatedly loses track of what the characters know or don't know which leads to some really odd interactions. It's partly found footage but does nothing with the conceit, and in the end, it's just not weird enough to live up to the films and stories that likely influenced it.",1523750400,,453,5.053333333333334
8621906,3,B00GB0OQ3U,I liked this movie but it was confusing to me. It's a movie that makes you think. It's not a movie to watch when you're wasted lol.,1523664000,,131,3.888888888888889

8621909,5,B00GB0OQ3U,"My brother was browsing Netflix with a friend when he found this gem of a movie. He watched it not thinking it would be anything exciting but was extremely surprised. Knowing I am a horror fanatic he came to me excited to show me. When we watched it together I knew we had stumbled upon the greatest horror movie I had ever seen. The jumpscares we got didn't feel cheap and instead felt planned. The story confusing and great makes you want to find out more. The special effects were practical and on par. The monstrous demons freak me out to this day and I never want to listen to the music again unless watching the movie again.

This movie brings you to a type of movie that instills fear into adults and keeps it there for nightmare to form. No nostalgia fear or cheap fear, it's pure fear.

It is beautiful.

Highly suggest it.",1521244800,,832,4.354838709677419
