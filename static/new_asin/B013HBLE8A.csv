8727660,5,B013HBLE8A,"I am the director and principal instructor of the New York Historical Fencing Association, a group that researches and teaches longsword fencing in the tradition of Johannes Liechtenauer (www.newyorklongsword.com). I endorse this DVD for use as supplemental training for our members.

This is an excellent DVD for students of weapon based martial arts. Although the title suggests that it is a look at the history of Jogo do Pau, this is mostly an instructional DVD that explains many of the basic fundamentals of JdP and contains instruction in these fundamentals along with some simple drills. The instruction is presented along with the history lessons, which is great and makes it more fun to watch, but which also leads to some things being presented in a strange order (in a pedagogical sense). For example, fighting multiple opponents is the first lesson shown, because of how JdP shifted focus from multiple opponents to dueling. This is not an issue, as you should watch the whole DVD initially to gain familiarity with the system, and then view various sections as needed, in whatever order you prefer.

The audio is a little boomy in parts because of the location, but most of the narration is recorded separately by a person with a very clear and easy to understand voice. The production quality is very good for a martial arts DVD, and the content is very easy to understand and digest.

Luis Preto is an excellent fighter and teacher, and this shows in the video. I have worked with him in the past and he is full of insight and genuine knowledge and skill. Because this is based on a real martial art developed over centuries, and because it is presented by a genuine modern day practitioner and teacher of that art, its contents are invaluable both to people looking to learn JdP and for people who seek to supplement their training in other arts. If you're a beginner, you'll be amazed at some of the things Luis shows you. Some are so obvious and logical, and yet they are the kinds of things that you'd never think of on your own. If  you're not a beginner, you'll see some things that are familiar to you, but also quite a bit of new insights that will improve your understanding of fighting.

In closing, if you're a student of weapon based martial arts or are thinking of becoming one, get this DVD, along with as many of Luis's other DVDs and books as you can afford. You will not regret it.",1446422400,,2414,4.670588235294118
8727661,5,B013HBLE8A,"From battlefields to duelling: the evolution of Jogo do Pau is a further excellent DVD released by Luis Preto and Patrick Scheler. In many ways, it works as a companion to their Combat Tactics DVD, which focussed on the baton (cane, one-handed stick), though it also discussed the staff. This DVD concentrates on the staff, and so discusses guard, parry selection and so on from that perspective. I found having this second perspective made some things on the Combat Tactics DVD clearer.

Perhaps the first thing to say is that the title might appear slightly misleading. To me it suggests a historic study of Jogo do Pau, whereas, it is actually how to do Jogo do Pau, but informed by historic context. So, for instance, initially, Jogo do Pau was mainly a defence against ambush in the countryside  thus lots of space and probably lots of assailants. So, the forward pointing waiting guard will not be much use  which enemy will you be pointing at? Rather the need is to clear a space all around you, and here the backward pointing waiting guard from which you can circle the staff immediately is far more useful. So, initially (and still today if you are attacked by multiple opponents) the backwards pointing guard is more appropriate. When you move on to individual opponents in a duel, then the forward pointing waiting guard becomes more appropriate.

Having said the DVD is how to do jogo do pau, that should be qualified by saying that it is not how to do in the sense of the mechanics of the various rotational strikes. It is more how to do in the sense of how to move your feet when making a parry, how to riposte after a parry and so on  very much along the same lines as the Combat Tactics DVD. That being said, you do get to view two highly qualified exponents of jogo do pau  Luis and Patrick  performing the various strikes and parries, so you can observe and learn from them.

The material covered includes multiple opponents, guard choice, footwork, parries, counterattacks (ripostes) and one-handed staff use. There is also a section on how the study of jogo do pau can be related to the use of the German long sword.

All in all, highly recommended.",1444089600,,2169,4.612987012987013
8727662,5,B013HBLE8A,"I had finally the chance to sit on my sofa tonight and watch your last DVD ""From battlefields to dueling"". First of all, I want to thank you for all the work and effort you put into sharing with the entire community not only the tradition of Jogo do Pau, but also for your experience and effort in developing a solid educational method.

I am not sure if you faced similar challenges, but I personally found often in old traditions in Italy non defined pedagogic methods, transmitted orally for centuries, sometimes restricted within certain circles. Methods that for the modern practitioner can be difficult to grasp immediately and that often require an actualization with current pedagogic knowledge. Actually some of these traditions have, like JdP, an uninterrupted continuation since medieval age (Sicilian and Apulian stick traditions can be traced back to 1100-1200), and bring with them all their centuries of battles and oral transmission.

Now: coming to the video. It is a very well organized and well directed and clear pedagogic work. It covers important aspects of the personal setting and strategies in a combat/duel, such as"" how to ""read your opponent"" in the guard, timing, footwork. Strategies for counter attacks and striking options. I find the methods incorporating all the core principles of fencing, translated into two handed sticks.

There are several similarities (non surprisingly) with the two handed Italian sticks. In particular the traditional schools of south of Italy. But many elements of JdP are certainly the same of Italian XIX cent. two handed academic/military fencing sticks as well (Masters Cerri and Ceselli for instance).

Overall, Luis is a very clear speaker and a precise, professional instructor and a skilled stick fighter. On top of this, his pedagogic background and skills are strongly coming out in this DVD, that I certainly recommend to any western martial artists (well, any martial artists). Plus, the location of the video is certainly evocative and just about right. Good Job Luis! And thank you.",1441065600,,2056,5.183734939759036
8727663,5,B013HBLE8A,"FROM BATTLEFIELDS TO DUELLING: The evolution of Jogo do Pau is a great DVD that anyone in HEMA should be interested to purchase.

What we have here is a living European martial art that is taught by not only someone who is passionate, but also very educated in the field of sport sciences and coaching. He has a number of publications, all in modern English, and to boot hes alive.

So now back to the DVD, it goes through JDPs development as a martial art. What I love about this DVD is that Luis goes over reasoning behind tactical and technical actions. Luis doesnt just help develop knowledge on JDP but a working knowledge that can be applied elsewhere.

As a couple bonuses, Luis has included an analysis of German Longsword using a very effective flow chart, and a form interpretation in an outnumbered situation with a bladed staff.",1440547200,,840,4.624161073825503
8727664,5,B013HBLE8A,"I recently watched the DVD FROM BATTLEFIELDS TO DUELLING, the evolution of Jogo do Pau by Luis Preto. Having had the pleasure of being taught by Luis in the past and having read quite a few of his books on different training subjects, I knew the dvd would be an educational, well researched work, and it is. Whilst going through situational aspects and origins of basic stances, attacking and defending motions, the evolution of JdP is systematically brought to screen in five parts, with a clear summery at the end of each chapter.
A good understanding of the interrelationships between guards, attacks and parries helps in creating a good perception of timing and distance. In such the dvd proves useful to practitioners and instructors of weapon arts, both modern and historical: the mentioned correlations are well explained and lead to simple pointers in the making of tactical decisions.
The pros and cons of stances and attacks are clearly demonstrated and in addendum illustrated in relation to the German school of the longsword.
If we didn't already know it: heres a living history we can profit from and heres an instructor and coach who talks the talk and walks the walk.",1438905600,2,1183,4.92
