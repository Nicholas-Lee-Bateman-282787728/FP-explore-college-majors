519308,3,6302814804,"Giant scorpions go on the rampage in one of only three Sci-Fi films made in Mexico.  Something south of the border has a good effect on these flicks.  Like its companions, the Valley of Gwangi and the Beast from  Hollow Mountain, the Black Scorpion takes a plot that could have been just  plain silly and makes a shuddery success of it.  Even the cast seems  comfortable with the script, unlike much of the cardboard acting so  prevalent in early Sci-Fi.  The special effects are weak, but the action  sequences are well-staged and believable.  Not a classic, but well worth  watching.",943660800,2,585,4.75
519309,4,6302814804,"In this movie, a race of giant scorpions get loose in Mexico and start causing catastrophes. The special effects by Willis-O-Brian are superb. Richard Denning also play's a good roll as a professor from Mexico city.",940636800,3,215,5.0

519341,4,6302814804,"There are a lot of things to like about this oldie but goodie, and one thing that many might not like but that can certainly tickle others (like me): the frequent fakey drooling giant scorpion face prop!  That thing is uuuuuuugly!  But the surprising thing is that the scorpions in all of the stop-motion glory that was used look and move really, really well.  Perhaps the stop motion effects by Willis OBrien (King Kong) aren't quite up to Harryhausen standards but they are a delight nonetheless.  And OBrien dips back into his King Kong days by recalling the infamous Spider pit sequence when the two heroes of the story (two geologists) are lowered into a large crevasse opened by a volcano; in the ginormous cavern they encounter various scorpions, a giant weird inchworm, and a funky crab-like spider.  This is the centerpiece of the film and will stay within the imagination of those that love this type of classic movie.  But the entire movie, from its pacing to the staging in the back country of Mexico, to the love interest and the little Juanito that becomes sort of like the son that the falling-in-love adults don't actually have, to a fantastic grand finale battle that pits the giant black scorpion against the Mexican military and some huey helis that it reaches up and takes down are all fun and enjoyable and overall well done for this type of feature.  Sure theres a lot of re-used footage and spfx cheats of that sort but isn't that often part of the charm?  And dig that tag line: They came from belowto create hell on earth.  YES!",1513987200,2,1553,4.638686131386861
519342,5,6302814804,"My rating is for the stop-motion animation, itself.
The price was outrageous for a movie with a broken spindle-hub,
inside one of those ANCIENT----cardboard and plastic clip-on----
non-standard, DVD case. I repackaged it in a standard, wrap a-
round [21st century] DVD case.
The, substantial, video bonuses w-e-r-e EXCEPTIONALLY generous.

IF you can afford the DVD, it IS worth the ""collector"" price!
A new BLU-RAY has been announced. I', gonna double-dip it and keep
the DVD in the BLU-RAY case.",1512518400,4,497,5.2125
519343,4,6302814804,"Yep it is the standard big bug 50's sci-fi with a Mexican twist.

We start with the obligatory narrative and a description of what may come. The narrator thinks that volcanoes are evil and bring destruction to farmland. To this land comes a pair of archaeologically strange doctors. They discover a fallen girl (that was just horsing around) and one of the scientists falls in love. The other states ""man is born single.""

I will not reveal the ugly threat that you already see on the cover. However, I think they used them again in ""Attack of the Crab Monsters"". In addition, it is fun to look at the technology of the time; they use huge walkie-talkie's, flash cameras (out of flash range), and Bakelite phones. The annoying part of the movie is the kid that will not stay in the car; we all hope he is eaten early in the story.",1507507200,,830,4.453947368421052

Both livestock and people start to mysteriously disappear without a trace. Scientist Richard Denning ( Mr & Mrs north, Hawaii Five-O) and rancher Mara Corday discover a horde of giant scorpions , released from an underground cavern, are terrorizing the countryside. One of the coolest scenes is when Denning goes down into the seemingly bottomless cavern to see how many of the monsters there are. The tension is relentless until all of the mutant scorpions are destroyed. The scorpions are created by  the famed Willis O'Brien(the ORIGINAL King Kong). The film is in b&w which plays up the suspense. Great fare for a rainy afternoon or a popcorn party.",1449446400,4,806,4.676056338028169

519485,3,6302814804,"This is a reasonably good science fiction film from the 1950s featuring the ever dependable Richard Denning as a scientist battling giant scorpions on the rampage in Mexico after volcanic activity opens a passage out of the deep caverns where the creatures have long resided.  Denning delivers another solid performance and has a good female lead in Mara Corday, who costarred with John Agar in Universal's Tarantula (1955), one of the best sci-fi thrillers of the 1950s, and with Jeff Morrow in Columbia's The Giant Claw (1957), one of the worst sci-fi pictures ever made.  Denning and Corday, a 1958 Playmate of the Month in Playboy Magazine, have a nice chemistry as a couple who become lovers amidst the destruction wrought by the scorpions.  The special effects were created by Willis O'Brien, the animator of King Kong and Mighty Joe Young and a mentor of the great Ray Harryhausen.  The scorpions are nicely animated through stop- motion photography, Not every scene works, but the ones that do are impressive.  The overall direction of the film by Edward Ludwig is competent,  The HD print available on Amazon is of high quality and adds to the enjoyment of the film.  It's well worth a look.",1424390400,6,1200,4.8817733990147785

The drives around the  landscape after the volcano eruption are striking.  It's when the scorpions get into the picture that the inconsistencies start.  Willis O'Brien did a good job with the creatures in long shots.  But  the film makers should have taken a look at giant insect behavior Them before they  decided to have the scorpions roar like carnivorous cats.  Other thing - we get a continuous close-up of the same scorpion over and over.  He was more effective at a distance.  The film makers should have trusted themselves more.,1423958400,,660,4.9

No subs. The film is shot (mostly) on location, in Mexico with Mexican actors except for our leads, who graced so many films of this type they could probably do it their sleep (No jokes here please). I refer to Richard Denning and the wonderful Mara Corday, looking almost, stress the almost, matronly, but terrific. Their acting as such was perhaps never their strong point but they deliver the goods as required by script and subject. Willis O'Brien was in charge of the SFX and they are pretty good except for the close ups which are terrible and probably not him. These Scorpions move fast. Perhaps the film is 10mins too long (88 mins) for a film of this kind, and while it is no classic it is well worth a watch. (P.S.

It has some non-Politically Correct scenes, like where the male lead comments on an infant orphaned by the giant scorpions ""I'll feed my babies beans and tortillas so I can sleep at night!"" and another scene with a scientist who's substituting tequila for coffee on a coffee break.

they also use harryhausen type stop motion work that is top notch. WB put out for it's time a first class monster feature.

It's a b movie, that's true but it was made with a feel of a A  budget flick. Being backed by WB meant that this one is not shlocky in the least. It's superior and straighforward and Love those great giant creature features of that decade and this would be up their with ""tarantula' and 'them' as one of the better of it's type. I don't understand why none of these movies haven't come out on blu ray yet though.  Oh well , we can always hope for it someday.

Any SciFi movie with Mara Corday is for me. Playboy pin-up Miss October 1957 has had other grade B sci-Fi roles in the ""unforgettable "" Giant Claw and also in Tarantula.
The premise for the movie is volcano's and earthquakes cause giant fissures in the earths crust and thru these passages come the giant black scorpion and his fellow arachnida to wreck havoc on the unprepared citizens of Mexico City.
Special effects were co-designed with King Kong's Willis (Obie) O'brien. All I can say is the  special effects were not near the level of King Kong shot some 24 years earlier. Minatures looked like minatures, the black scorpion at times was just a black shaded figure which looked just plain bad.
Some goofs that I caught :
......In the scene where the scorpion attacks the passenger train, on the lead engine you can plainly see "" Lionel Lines"", which of course is the famous toy train manufacturer.
......When the scorpion attacks Mexico City , a couple a shots actually show the Empire State building in the background.
.....In some of the lab scenes you can actually see the shadow of the boom mikes on the sets walls.
The extra's provided on this DVD were more interesting than the feature movie:
...."" Stop-Motion-Masters"" with an interview with Ray Harryhausen.
.... Never before seen test footage of some Willis O'Brien idea's that were never filmed. "" The Las-Vegas Monster"" and "" The Beetlemen"" These looked great.
....A 1956 Harryhausen + O'Brien animated dinosaur sequence from Irwin Allen's "" The Animal World "" Just some amazing stuff for its time, I have never seen this before.
I couldn't go wrong with the price of this DVD. Bought this for a cheap price of $5.79 thru Amazon.",1266278400,,1735,4.7959866220735785
519696,5,6302814804,"Most people who are a fan of the original ""King Kong"" movie from the 1930's are aware of the so-called deleted giant insect/arachnid scene.  Willis Obrien did the animation for King Kong and was well known for saving his stop motion models for the movies he worked on after they were over.  Many of the creatures from ""The Lost World"", ""King Kong"" and ""Son of Kong"" appear in a least two of the above movies.

What does this have to do with ""The Black Scorpion""?  Think about it!!  Willis Obrien did the stop motion work on this movie using giant scorpions and spiders.  Watching this movie it is extremely apparent that it was a very low budget movie.  So how did they come up with money for Willis Obrien to create new stop motion creatures for this movie.  It seems very possible that these creatures are the same ones that were used for the deleted King Kong footage that so many fans pine for.  When watching the movie it strikes me that the sequence in the cave with all of the different creatures wandering around seemed very old fashioned and King Kong like.  Anyone who has seen the recreated footage, done by Peter Jackson as an attempt to approximate what the scene may have been like, will be interested in comparing it to the footage in this film and noting how similar it is.

The film itself is very good as a 1950's man vs monster movie.  However if it is viewed as a possible window into how Willis Obrien may have finally tried to recreate his lost King Kong footage, that rumor has he was very proud of, the movie takes on a more interesting aspect.

Therefore, I give it 5 stars for it historic appeal. If you are interested in stop motion animation, and more specifically the making of ""King Kong"" and the lost sequences from that movie, this movie provides some interesting insight.",1262736000,2,1804,4.4969325153374236
519697,4,6302814804,"THE BLACK SCORPION is a fine example of what cast and crew can do when money is in short supply and they need to film a story about a Big Bug.  By the time director Edward Ludwig got around to filming THE BLACK SCORPION in 1957, Hollywood had churned out a number of similarly themed movies like THE GIANT CLAW and THEM.  THE GIANT CLAW was a bomb on every level while THEM was an artistic and financial success.  What THE BLACK SCORPION shares with THEM is its ability to present some realistic (more or less) Big Bugs that seemed threatening despite Ludwig's not having computer effects or a big budget with which to work.  What he did have was the incomparable talent of Willis O'Brien, the FX master who decades earlier brought us KING KONG and showed that he had not lost his touch.

The cast was led by Richard Denning as Hank, a geologist who discovers an underground lair of colossal scorpions, and Mara Corday, as Teresa, a woman who owns a cattle ranch and provides the romantic coupling.  Both Denning and Corday had plenty of experience as B movie stars and both of them fit in well in a film that could have been a turkey along the lines of THE GIANT CLAW, which Corday had starred in three years earlier.  But here, they meet under menacing conditions and predictably fall in love.  The real stars are the giant scorpions, which means that Willis O'Brien is the unsung hero.  Since he lacked the money, he had to make do with facial close-ups, shadow super-impositions, and numerous shots of stop-motion scorpions running amuck.  Surprisingly, most of this works.  Toward the end, there are some gripping scenes of the biggest and baddest of the scorpions attacking Mexico City while crowds of panic-stricken citizens run in fear.  THE GIANT SCORPION works on a number of levels, so much so that we scarcely notice the cheesy FX.  We know when we are being manipulated but when a film as good as this one does the manipulating, we hardly care.",1256342400,3,1957,4.589080459770115

519701,4,6302814804,"""Big Bug"" movies were all the rage in the late 1950s and early 1960s--and the stop-motion animation for THE BLACK SCORPION was created by Willis O'Brien, who created the legendary KING KONG.  Alas, there is a very big difference between KING KONG, which had a budget as big as its namesake, and THE BLACK SCORPIO, which looks like it was filmed for five dollars and twenty-eight cents!  But while THE BLACK SCORPION is hardly the best of the best of its genre, it is still amusing enough to appeal to fans of 1950s horror in general and O'Brien in particular.

The story is essentially a riff on the 1954 creature-feature THEM!, which sported giant killer mutant ants unleased by atomic radiation; in this instance we have giant killer prehistoric scorpions unleashed by a series of earthquakes and volcanic erruptions in Mexico.  The earthquakes and such attract the attention of geologist Hank Scott (Richard Denning), who is soon distracted by the charms of local ranch owner Teresa Alverez (Mara Corday)--but before the two can become seriously involved they find her ranch over-run by creepy crawlies that drool in close up and have a really nasty sting.

The high light of the film finds Scott and company lowered into a deep crevass, the better to show the scorpions in their natural habitat.  It is indeed a mighty rip off from THEM!--but it works well on its own, and it is all the more interesting due to the O'Brien factor.  A similar scene was cut from KING KONG, and rumor has it that O'Brien recycled both the spider and the worm from that lost scene for use here.  There is also a memorable scene in which a train is attacked by multiple scorpions and a memorable finish for the last surviving scorpion, so it is easy to forgive the lackluster rest.

The DVD is quite interesting, for it includes several bonuses of interest to stop-motion fans.  No, THE BLACK SCORPION is never going to rivial any of the really good ""big bug"" films, but stop-motion fans and those who love 1950s ""B"" horror will find much to enjoy.  Recommended.

519702,4,6302814804,"I saw this movie for the first time at drive-in movie when I was 4 with my younger brother and older sister. This was in the era of ""Attack of the 50 Foot Woman"" and other flicks where much of the story was generated by the audience's imagination. It hasn't lost it's appeal in nearly 50 years.
Even at an early age I was well aquainted with scorpions, so this movie was like a personal experience. Even better was the fact that the scorpion had a snarling face with ""sharp teeth???"" complete with a little nose was even better. The part where the two scientists went down wearing canary suits and packing a light machine gun was classic 1950 attitude. With our technology and firepower we can overcome ANYTHING. So, why didn't they pack a bazooka. I suppose such firepower either wasn't in the Mexican Army arsnel or the movie budget.  I still giggle at the centipede in the pit, that didn't crawl but pushed itself up to full height before pushing off again.
About the dumbest part was when the vaquero fell off the side of the pit and the leading lady wanted to know to know IF they found him and his horse alive , after he fell like 1,000 feet into this pit. Ahh, the 1950s were VERY innocent even in regard to the laws of gravity, but few people, as Bugs Bunny would say, studied law back then.
Especially exciting was the black scorpion chasing the populace through Mexico City. AND they were able to keep a head of it. I'd really like to know what moron they got to drive the truck loaded with cattle to the bull fighting arena or why that Mexican general reached for a harpoon he knew was charged with 2,000 volts of electricity.

The American leaves early with the girl and everyone else has to stay behind to clean up.

Not bad at all, really, considering that they re-used a lot of footage and the bug scenes were either pretty good or laughably bad.

The transfer on this DVD is quite crisp, and the added test footage from O'Bie's Las Vegas Monster and Beetlemen projects (never sold or completed) make this a must have for his fans.",1137369600,2,888,5.006756756756757

I was fortunate to locate this one: it never pops up in ""related searches"" for movies akin to the Harryhausen series.  I'm glad I found it.

Havoc is being wruck(?) down near Mexico Way.  This is the 1950s once again, and a seemingly worthless insect specimen has suddenly got a lethal dose of hallucinogenic steroids from... surprisingly, not the H-Bomb.  This time it involves the unnaturally fast formation of a new volcano on the outskirts of Mexico City.  Lava flows have already begun decimating the hillside shacks and surrounding villages.  (*I will never understand why people reside near the base of prehistoric fire pits*)

Geologists Dr. Scott (Richard Denning) and Artur Ramos (Carlos Rivas) stumble upon some wreckage they believe to be a part of a recent volcanic spill-over.  One village is wrecked with a corpse and an abandoned baby left behind.  Faced with helping to evacuate the nearby town of San Lorenzo, they spy (literally) a ""cowgirl"" Teresa (Mara Corday) after a fall from her horse.

It's straight formula from there: she enlists their help to save the townspeople, REALLY BIG f-ckin' scorpions unearth themselves at night (along with the immortal ant-shriek from ""THEM!"") and have at the extras, doctor spends more time trying to bed Teresa and smoking cigarettes than helping anyone stay alive, attempt to destroy scorpion caves backfires and stirs up even more trouble...  it's the Texas 2-step of plot development.  But when it's got charm, it works.  And ""The Black Scorpion"" has charm.

""Scorpion"" greatly benefits from its authentic Mexico locations, healthy dose of carnage, and rather impressive creature/FX sequences set deep in the catacombs.  Willis O'Brien and Ray Harryhausen (uncredited) reference ""King Kong""(1933) a lot in how they stage the action.  Even the kick-ass finale within a soccer stadium starring King Sting vs. Army cargo choppers, tanks, and expendable soldiers contains a -- for lack of a better adjective: epic -- tone.  Just watch it, 'cause I can't really explain it.

Not seminal, but still a rip-roaring good time.

The Warner Bros. DVD is pretty decent: original theatrical 1.33:1 ratio from a somewhat damaged but completely forgivable b/w interpositive print, original mono sound mix, plus some short-but-sweet features regarding Harryhausen's appreciation for his late mentor ""Obie"".  BIG BONUS: the prehistoric sequence which opens Irwin Allen's 2nd documentary ""The Animal World"".  I guarantee you it is the best part of that whole film.",1136937600,7,2560,5.235872235872236
519730,5,6302814804,"Don't let these old flicks fool you; very often the imagery is just as horrific as anything that could come out of Hollywood today. Spielberg, in his recent War of the Worlds visually paraphrases from this movie. It's cribbed from one extremely disturbing nocturnal scene of these giant scorpians attacking some helpless folks--I won't spoil it for you. The older style acting and plot devices actually underscore the horrific moments.

Some see these flicks as just old and funky B-movies but I'm lately arguing that if you accept them on their own terms (kind of like accepting old literature or art on their own terms) they're pretty remarkable. Heck, the original King Kong still gives me the willies at times.

Black and white is perfect for horror. It tends to simulate the dream state. Old scenic work and effects, as opposed to the modern and sometimes too literal ones, often have a surreal quality. Think of that burning windmill at the end of Frankenstein. Poetic in a way no modern film can approximate. Interestingly, Spielberg nods to all of this in his last film--it's a conscious tribute to the artistry of these older films-- which is why it may ultimately be the grandest of all sci-fi/horror films.",1121126400,12,1217,4.874396135265701

519732,4,6302814804,"""The Black Scorpion"" is a prime example of a how a big bug film can be made on a low budget and still retain the big-studio gloss. From those fun folks at Warners, who's history of big stars and big films at the time was renowned, this story is set in the Mexican desert outside Mexico City. An unhealthy dose of atomic radiation has mutated a horde of black scorpions to giant-size proportions and set them on a path of destruction toward the heart of Mexico City. Bringing the scorpions to life is the stop-motion animation of the legendary Willis O' Brien. O'Brien is best-known for his work animating that hairy guy Kong in the 1933 classic ""King Kong"". As the 1950's rolled around, O'Brien had started to ride a bit on his past success with films like ""Kong"" and ""Son of Kong"", and his output was a bit spotty. His ""Beast of Hollow Mountain"", done a year prior to ""Black Scorpion"", featured some of O'Brien's most sub-standard effects work. It resembles the clay-mation process of the 60's more so than stop-motion work. But in ""Scorpion"", he is back in fine form. A great more detail has been given to the creature models and they actually feel real on screen. It gives the film a tension that other 50's ""big bug"" efforts lacked.

  Ably supporting O'Brien is a cast of 50's stalwarts, including Richard Denning as the iron-jawed hero, Mara Corday as the pretty heroine, and Carlos Rivas as Denning's friend and right-hand man. Even 50's favorite Nestor Paiva (the boat captain in ""Creature From the Black Lagoon"") pops up to remind us of the camp value of the film.

  This film has been unfairly criticized for its similar plot-line to the earlier Warners effort ""Them"". Frankly, ""Them"" set the tone for a lot of 50's ""big bug"" films. Unlike many of the others ""Black Scorpion"" holds its own against its 1954 cinema brother. As directed by Edward Ludwig, the film achieves a grittier feel than ""Them"". You can almost feel the hot, arid desert where the action takes place. And the scorpion attack scenes drip with tension.

  The film does suffer from the occasional bit of banal dialogue, but then, so did a dozen other sci-fi and horror flicks in that decade alone! it seems that a pre-requisite of the time was to not do the script until the plane ride to the set the day before shooting begins! But this is a minor sting (pun intended) against a fine genre effort.",1104624000,2,2377,4.60047281323877

I am a HUGE fan of ALL THREE, however, and enjoyed this film immensely!

519734,4,6302814804,"I am a fan of monster movies from the 50s and 60s than I am of the monster movies of today. The reason for that is because B&W movies just seem to capture the horrors better and stop-motion animation just seemed to be fun to look at. Plus with stop-motion animation being cheaper (but more time consuming), more and more monster movies were made possible.
The Black Scorpion has always been one of my favorites. Why I don't know. But, in my opinion, it is one of the very few giant bug movies that actually looks good and doesn't have really bad acting. Willis O'Brian had some pretty good looking effects in this one. Although there were some scenes which they used a blackened cartoon scorpion and on the close-ups of it, you could see the matting. Also there is some stock footage that is in this film. Don't worry, it's only stock footage from this film that repeats now an then when the Black Scorpion attacks. That in itself gets somewhat annoying and because some scenes don't fit right. Like when the Black Scorpion attacked two smaller ones after they had attacked the train, a close-up of the Black Scorpion killing the other two was stock footage used in the cave scene just minutes earlier in the film.
All in all, a classic B movies that really isn't as goofy and bland as some of the other monster movies in the 50s and 60s. I would suggest picking this one up if you are a fan of the genre.",1080432000,7,1405,4.407692307692308
519735,4,6302814804,"Released in 1957, The Black Scorpion followed in a long line of giant bug movie, probably most notable 1954's Them!, which dealt with giant ants.  The main difference being that in most of those movies, the gigantism in the creatures was caused by atomic radiation (I wonder how many men pondered radiating their private parts given that Hollywood seemed so determined to make us believe radiation would have the effect of embiggening things so?) and in this movie the cause was of a more natural reason.
The Black Scorpion stars Richard Denning, who I remember most from the movie Target Earth (1954) and Mara Corday, a darkened hair beauty whose other notable films include Tarantula (1955) and The Giant Claw (1957).
The plot involves a very active volcano in Mexico and geologists Hank Scott (Denning) along with a colleague are interested in seeing this activity first hand.  Corday plays Teresa Alverez, a ranch owner whose cattle is being mysteriously slaughtered and is having difficulties keeping locals around to help her round up the cattle as they believe some devil bull or something is responsible.
Turns out the active volcano has ripped open some giant fissures in the Earth, exposing a vast underground cavern containing mostly giant, prehistoric scorpions.  The scorpions, being a might bit peckish after years of living under the ground, start venturing out into the Mexican deserts, stinging and eating whatever gets in their path.  They are soon discovered, the military comes in, blows them up real good, and that's the end of that...or is it?  Okay, no it's not, as the humongous scorpions find another way out, and begin to do cool stuff like attack trains and find their way into populated areas.
What really worked so well in this movie is the special effects...well, at least the ones done by Willis O'Brien (King Kong) and Ray Harryhausen using stop-motion animation.  Harryhausen isn't credited, but he ended up doing about 90 percent of the effects, under the supervision of O'Brien.  The scenes with numerous scorpions attacking the passenger train are probably among the best in this feature.  These effects contrasted greatly with the 'live' effects, the ones showing the drooling visages of the beasties up close.  These were pretty bad, and they kept using the same visual over and over again, a gaping maw of a scorpion with custard-like drool leaking from between its' mandibles.  At some point the production ran out of money, so some of the effects are of the cheapest kind, basically looking like a real scorpion placed on some kind of empty matte invading a Mexican city.
In the end, there is a climatic battle, one with tanks, explosions, army guys and such...do they destroy the primitive creatures?  I guess you'll have to see the movie (ain't I a stinker?)
There are some great special features included in this release, which is strange as Warner Brothers really isn't known for this (they still use the cheap cardboard and plastic casing which drives me nuts).  A feature called 'Stop Motion Masters' has Harryhausen talk about his greatest influence, Willis 'Obie' O'Brien, the man behind King Kong.  Another clip included is one from the short called 'The Animal World', a feature created by disaster movie mogul Irwin Allen, which highlights HarryHausen and O'Brien's prehistoric segment, the highlight of the film.  Also included are some short test footage found by another stop motion artist involving a mutant ape attacking a house and truck, using props from The Black Scorpion, and a small bit dealing with Beetlemen who were actually astronauts affected by cosmic radiation and ended up growing exoskeletons.  Finally, there are some trailers provided, showcasing other Harryhausen and O'Brien films.  Oh yeah, if the noise you hear the scorpions making sounds familiar, I was told that's because it's the same noise that the giant ants made in the movie Them! (1954).

519756,5,6302814804,"What's so great about this 50's classic is the use of the same scenes over and over---the face shots of the scorpion; when the big scorpion is killing the others, the close ups are the same; when the scorpions come rushing out of their lairs, again the same scene; shots of the doomed train are the same--but it's fun, and it's what makes the big bug movies of the fifties such cherished items.  They are obviously way beyond par with today's CGI effects, but for kids growing up in the fifties and sixties, man were they scary!
The scorpion is actually well down in most shots, Willis O'Brien's swan song after creating King Kong.

519759,5,6302814804,"After disappointing DVD releases, virtually barren of extras, of some of the finest SF/horror films in their catalog (Them, Thing from Another World, Curse of Frankenstein, Horror of Dracula), Warner Video finally redeems themselves somewhat with this excellent package (and concurrent releases of Beast from 20,000 Fathoms and Valley of Gwangi). While the extras are not exactly generous, they're of great interest to B-movie and stop-motion animation fans. I have to place Black Scorpion in my top three Big Bug movies, along with Tarantula and Beginning of the End. Fans of Them will probably consider this heresy, but frankly, as fine a film as Them is overall, those big head-nodder ant props just never engendered much suspension of disbelief, let alone horror, in me, even as a kid. In contrast, Black Scorpion inverts the situation, with a pedestrian B-movie scenario framing some of the creepiest, scariest, and convincing Big Bug special effects footage of the era.

A volcano in Mexico releases a horde of giant scorpions that roam the countryside, destroying and killing, grabbing people with their pincers and jabbing them with their stinger tails. Several beautifully animated stop-motion set pieces are featured, including the sequence in which the scientists descend into the volcano crater to explore the scorpions' underground lair and encounter cool and creepy wormlike and spiderlike creatures; the scene of the scorpions destroying a train and feasting on the screaming passengers, then battling a supergiant ""king"" scorpion; and the king scorpion's last stand inside a sports stadium, where it scoops up military vehicles like marbles and plucks helicopters out of the sky, slamming them to the ground, while the military bombards it mercilessly. Black Scorpion was the last monster epic supervised by Willis O'Brien, the legendary stop-motion pioneer (The Lost World, King Kong, Mighty Joe Young, etc.), though the hands-on animation was done primarily by Pete Peterson, who proves himself a close second if not equal to Ray Harryhausen in terms of technical skill. His scorpions, in contrast to most other 1950s movie monsters, are realistic, quick-moving, bloodthirsty, and relentless. Unfortunately, someone had the really bad idea to keep cutting to inserts of a laughable, drooling, life-size scorpion head prop that distracts from and somewhat undermines the otherwise stunning stop-motion animation of the scorpions and other bugs. The ""black"" scorpion of the title is occasionally shown as an empty black matte silhouette, apparently because they ran out of money, and the special effects scenes also suffer at times from from matting and process work with poorly matched contrast. But when the scorpions are darting around, killing with their spiked tails, there are few 1950s SF creatures that can equal them for pure repulsive horror. The human leads are familiar B-movie stalwarts Richard Denning (Creature from the Black Lagoon, Target Earth, Day the World Ended, etc.), playboy model Mara Corday (Tarantula, The Giant Claw), and Carlos Rivas (Beast of Hollow Mountain). Director Edward Ludwig had previously directed mostly B-westerns and exotica such as Smuggler's Island and Jivaro, and must have seemed like a logical choice to the producers of this monster flick set in the Mexican desert. The story is pretty generic, but moves along reasonably well, and it's really just an excuse for the monster sequences anyway, so pop some popcorn, sit back, and enjoy.

Warner's DVD finally gives fans and collectors reason for praise rather than griping. The movie is presented in 1.33:1 full frame, open matte so you can enlarge it to its proper 1.85:1 aspect ratio on a 16x9 TV, and looks simply fabulous, with terrific black level, contrast, grayscale, detail, and sharpness. There is some nearly unavoidable very light speckling and spotting, but overall the print is stunning. The extras (!!) include trailers (Black Scorpion, Gwangi, Beast from 20,000 Fathoms, and Clash of the Titans); a three-minute featurette with Ray Harryhausen (talking about seeing King Kong as a child, meeting Willis O'Brien, and working with him on Mighty Joe Young) that's interesting and informative as far as it goes but much too brief; and the long-sought (by animation fans) and little-seen 10-minute dinosaur sequence from Irwin Allen's Animal World, apparently presented here for no other reason than Warner's had it and felt (uncharacteristically) like throwing us a bone. And last, but for me the jewels of the set, are two short (4:00 and :40) animation tests by Pete Peterson for proposed or aborted projects. The first is called The Las Vegas Monster and features a cool outsized astro-mutated baboon demolishing a house and tangling with a truck left over from Mighty Joe Young. The second, Beetlemen, is a clip of an army of walking insectoid creatures that's unfortunately in very poor condition and tantalizingly brief but still amazing and effortlessly beautiful. A comparison of Peterson's animation in these tests and The Black Scorpion with the Animal World footage (and more so Harryhausen's later films) demonstrates that while Peterson was close to Ray on a technical level, Harryhausen's creations project a ""life"" and ""personality"" that is noticeably absent in Peterson's otherwise impressive work. It really reinforces for me the true artistry of Ray Harryhausen's achievements (no slight to Peterson intended). I'm amazed that Warner bothered to include these rare tests (lost for years and discovered in a trunk) given their past track record. The only thing to complain about here are the cheap snap-case covers that Warner is still packaging their DVDs in, giving them a second-class, low-budget appearance, and leaving them more susceptible to dust, etc. But that minor grievance aside, this is a really fine release (especially for Warner Video) and needs to be in the collection of every 1950s SF or stop-motion animation fan.",1067731200,66,5974,5.334040296924709

The scorpions are well animated and are quick moving as opposed to the slow lumbering monsters that were the norm in the 50's. They are quite menacing. I can see how this movie might have scared people back in its day.
Other than that,everything in between the monster attacks I found dull. Richard Denning and Mara Corday are good actors but they came across as lifeless cardboard cutouts in this one.

Unfortunately, in later years he only got to make lower budget  films like THE GIANT BEHEMOTH and BEAST OF HOLLOW MOUNTAIN.

Recent violent  volcanic upheavals in a remote area of rural Mexico unleash this menace on  an unsuspecting world.  This is an entertaining, albeit derivative,  sci-fi/monster flick from the ""big bug"" school of the the 1950's.  As others have commented, it is a thinly disquised clone of  ""Them"" that replaces mutant ants with prehistoric scorpions.  This reviewer doesn't feel it's necessary to be entangled in a  ""creative purity"" debate.  If one rejected all the old monster  movies that are lacking in original ideas and plots, it would leave a very  small population.
This film offers good stop-motion animation by Willis  O'Brien (of ""King Kong"" fame).  After a slow start, the action  takes off when the giant creatures swarm over the countryside.  Things get  really tense when two geologists (Richard Denning and Carlos Rivas) find  the scorpions' nest in a deep cave-like fissure.  They get the bright idea  to descend into the fissure to determine the creatures' vulnerabilities.  I  mean, who else should study the habits of monstrous scorpions than a couple  of rock gazing geologists?  Beside the resident hordes of giant scorpions  fighting among themselves and ruled by a huge black scorpion (hence, the  movie's title) there are thirty-foot prehistoric worms (with claws, no  less) and a giant spider.  The fissure is dynamited into oblivion, but some  of the scorpions escape.  In another terrifying segment, the scorpions  swarm over a crowded passenger train as it hurtles through the desert  night. The blood bath so inflames the monstrous creatures that they turn on  each other.  The black scorpion prevails, heads for Mexico City, and  typical monster-movie hysteria and mayhem ensues.
One problem with this  film is the dark-tones of the B&W photography combined with the dark  tinted special effects.  The black scorpion that rules the arachnid hordes  is occasionally reduced to a shadow moving across the screen.  People who  viewed this movie at drive-ins back in the '50s had trouble seeing all the  action because of the dark photography against the night sky.  The  climactic battle scene has enough tanks, rockets, and explosions to satisfy  the savage beast in most blood-thirsty viewers.  Among classic  sci-fi/monster flicks, this film is a second-stringer.  For old-fashioned  ""Saturday afternoon at the movies"" fun, it serves the purpose  very well.

And it amazes me to no end as to why people just stand there with their mouths open doing nothing when a creature is getting ready to attack them, or even just make an inept attempt to protect themselves by throwing their hands up over themselves looking positively silly when a big, bad monster is getting ready to eat them. In this particular movie, in a scene where people were running around trying to escape the town being overrun with giant scorpions, while carrying large baskets or other household items in their hands. One would think that when you're trying to get away from a monster, you're not going to take the time to gather a giant basket making it extremely difficult to run.

7832048,4,6302814804,I adore the old 50s and 60s horror movies. Creatures especially. It's more than funny to know that three-quarters of the way through the reason that scorpions look just like Shadows rather than the whole scorpions that they were is that they apparently ran out of budget and that's all they could do. Still actually given when it was made it's pretty cool.  I could totally see people back in the day being really scared by it.,1524268800,,427,4.545454545454546

7832050,5,6302814804,"The movie itself was excellent. The video transfer great. The extras offered a documentary of Ray Harryhausen reminiscing over his mentor Willis OBrian who did the special effects for the original King Kong and The Black Scorpion. It also included the stop motion prehistoric segment from Irwin Allens documentary feature film The Animal World which was the last film collaboration of Willis OBrian and Ray Harryhausen.
In addition it had stop motion special effects footage from Pete Petersens aborted film projects. Petersen was OBrians assistant on Mighty Joe Young, The Giant Behemoth and The Black Scorpion. Petersen did the tedious hands on stop motion work under the supervision of OBrian.

My only quibble is the exact same extras were on the dvd release of the film and no new extras were made for the Bluray release. It would have been nice to have had a commentary tract done for this release.

About the film itself in my humble opinion its the second best giant bug flick made during the 1950s sci-fi movie craze. Only the classic Them surpasses it having superior story, acting and direction. Regarding special effects however Black Scorpion is superior. OBrians and Petersens stop motion in many ways surpasses Ray Harryhausens best work. Several scenes of scorpions on the rampage are genuinely frightening and caused me to lose sleep when I saw it in theaters as a child.

For those interested in classic 50s sci-fi, stop motion animation or just a great entertaining movie I highly recommend seeing The Black Scorpion.",1523923200,,1536,5.039370078740157
7832051,5,6302814804,"Another great blu ray product with all the resolution that I love for watching my favorite science fiction and fantasy films.  The photography and lighting in this one are excellent.  Story has a wonderfully paced dramatic buildup.  Love the staging of the scenes.  Im a life long fan of stop motion animation effects and have always appreciated the work of Willis OBrien and Pete Peterson.  Once again, they certainly do not disappoint.  For me, the acting seems better than usual for this kind of picture.  The music is clever and eerie throughout.  One of those movies I enjoy as much watching again and again.  Always interesting and fascinating.  The only criticism I have is that I wish the picture image were full-frame instead of cropped for the benefit of my wide screen t v.  All in all though its a fine product and I give it a five-star thumbs up.  Its worth having.",1522454400,3,878,4.666666666666667
