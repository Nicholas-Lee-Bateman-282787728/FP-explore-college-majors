This is a lead up to an 'emotional' reunion; a' la ""Oh sorry I wouldn't have tried to smash your head in with a wooden plank IF I'D KNOWN IT WAS YOOOUU"" or ""I'm so sorry, I wouldn't have paid gangsters to burn your family to death IF I'D KNOWN IT WAS YOOOOUU"".

Okay okay, I'm exaggerating, but it's usually something like cop bashes criminal mastermind only to find it's HIS BELOVED LONG LOST BROTHER and that's HE BEEN FRAMED. Yeah, that last one, that's ""Roop ki rani, Choron  ka raja"". That and the orphanage child-hood sweethearts who get separated. Truly.

""Roop ki..."" (Means 'Queen of Beauty, King of Thieves') was CRITICALLY PANNED at the time, and was A DISAPPOINTING COMMERCIAL SUCCESS. That is in spite of good acting and an excellent production, which was the highest budget hindi film up to that point.

It features many great scenes, including one where a man (well, Anil Kapoor) (who else?) is suspended from a helicopter to a train to try and break into it and steal valuable goods. Fantastic stuff. There are songs that look like they were worth millions to make, especially for Hindi cinema in 1993.

I really enjoyed the film, it has brilliant production and direction, and features Anupam Kher as a chilling villain. Worth watching for a great action adventure, with a few 'tearjerking' moments thrown in.",1383609600,,1566,4.846441947565543
