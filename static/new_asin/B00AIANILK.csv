I had a great deal of difficulty finding that information myself, so I thought posting it might be helpful to others.",1388188800,13,252,4.382978723404255
5425920,5,B00AIANILK,"An amazement you should not miss, if you care about movies, music, musicals or protest, HIPSTERS is the real thing -- and achieves that by often being creatively ""unreal"" and all over the place. Taking its cue from a (rather small, I would guess) movement back in 1950s Russia, in which teens and slightly older young people strove to ""make a difference"" by adopting odd clothing and musical tastes thought to be favored by American youth, the movie tracks a young man and his girl, members of the The Young Communist League or some such group, who break up a party of hipsters, after which the boy becomes enchanted with the style and one special young woman who embodies it.

The musical numbers are bright, smart, effective -- and very different in  theme and style, one from the next -- while the visuals are rich and colorful and the content of the movie encompasses everything from family to politics to sex to procreation (very interestingly handled, that last one). Performances are all they should be, and the finale, conflating music and protest in a marvelous time line, is one for the books: hugely entertaining and moving, too. If the musical, Hair, comes to mind, don't be surprised. HIpsters is equally good -- and also wildly exotic for most western tastes.",1373414400,12,1273,4.781818181818182
5425921,5,B00AIANILK,"The movie's opening scene is set in one of the Soviet's era ""Culture park"", basically, a place where people would come to dance, watch theater, take a walk, have an ice cream and enjoy the scenery.  The main hero of the movie, Mels, dressed in a typical Soviet 50's garb is part of the group of college students who have taken upon themselves the noble task of cleansing the society that has been in pursuit of Communism from undesirable elements, the kids of their age who idolize Western values-music, manners, and clothing. As Mels pursues one of such elements, a beautiful Polina through the dark park which the cinematography has transformed into an enchanted forest, it feels that he too becomes enchanted by Polina and everything that comes with her. I watched this movie 3 times-by myself, with hubby and then with my kids, ages 13 and 10. The movie is very colorful, with amazing score and top Russian actors playing the older generation-Mels', Bob's and Fred's fathers are literally creme de la crop when it comes to the middle aged actors of Russia. And Oksana Anichkina who plays Polina, I have first discovered her in the movie ""Sisters"", the directorial debut of the Sergei Bodrov Jr, whose untimely tragic death still resonates with many fans of the movies where he starred and then directed.",1370563200,5,1307,4.808888888888889
5425922,5,B00AIANILK,"I love this film.  Its a wild and terrific musical set in the Soviet Union during (I think) the Khrushchev era.  In this time, groups of wild, Western-swing music-loving Soviet youth dress up in fantasy versions of Western dress (a lot of colorful Hawaiian prints and eye-jarring wildly colored tweed suits) and go out dancing and partying to bootleg records of American jazz.  The film is slick and fun and sexy.  Undoubtedly the abilities of the kids to live large while flying under the radar of the Soviet authorities is exaggerated somewhat...just as the film's young hero ""Mels"" manages to learn to play saxaphone rather well in what appears to be an astonishingly short time...but the basic idea is honest enough, as anyone who's seen the documentary ""East Side Story"" can understand.  Definitely a fun, enjoyable, well-made film with some very appealing young Russian actors.  See it, and you too will know what is meant by ""boogies on bones.""",1368403200,5,951,4.949685534591195
5425923,5,B00AIANILK,"I don't speak Russian, I bought the movie previously region 5 pal and didn't understand a thing, but with the subtitles it now became clear.  I don't want to get into the plot, just love the movie, a fun musical about takes you back to 1950's Soviet Russia behind the red curtain and the rebellious teens who fought the system.",1366329600,3,327,4.45
5425924,4,B00AIANILK,"COLORFUL Soviet musical, in all senses of the word. Fun to watch for the music and dancing, and insight into what Russian culture might have been like in the Stalin era.

Could have used better editing; some of the plot is disjointed and I didn't understand the prologue at all.(Was the rest of the film supposed to be told in flashback? Which character's life was it?)

Definitely R rated; do not bring the kids. Movie runs 2 hours 5 minutes; not 89 minutes.",1364601600,2,459,4.518072289156627
5425925,5,B00AIANILK,"The western media is spoonfeeding us on a constant diat of the gloomey doomey past on what went on behind the iron curtain, no matter what. Something contradicting this agenda, has no chance of being published in the west. So in this movie we can take a glimpse at the ""hippster period"" how it was. I can only speak for east germany, where people experienced this period, pretty much just like it. I loved the muscic growing up in the 50's to the early 60's, and I really loved to see the girls in those pretty and very sexy dresses. I remember, that almost all girls dressed in the wonderful petticoat fashion, and looked beautiful, compeating with fluffyness.
I fondly remember the spontaneous beachparties, with the crankable recordplayers and barn parties where we kids where not allowed to go to, but we got secretly up and watched through the cracks, and getting into trouble.
The film portray's a conflict between the socialist goverment and the hippsters, that perhaps is a little bit exagerated, since I had the feeling, that it was more of a generational conflict.",1362787200,8,1074,4.779569892473118
8551945,4,B00AIANILK,"The movie Hipsters takes place in 1955 in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics capital of Moscow.  The film itself is directed by Valeriy Todorovskiy and stars Anton Shagin (Mels), Oksana Akinshina (Polly), Eugenia Khirivskaya (Katya), Maksim Matveyev (Fred), and Igor Voynarovskiy (Bob). The film itself is a Musical that expresses individuality in the Soviet Union during a post war time where Communism is in full swing in Russia.

The main plot of the movie has us follow Mels, a young enforcer for the Communist Regime in the Soviet Union. This Regime that he is part of is in charge of keeping the rebellious youth or the Hipsters in check. We first meet Mels when his band of enforcers raids a hipster party at an abandoned building. Before the raid is conducted Mels peers in and sees the bright colors and the dancing habits of the hipsters. At this point Mels chases after a girl named Polly who eventually becomes the love interest of Mels. At first it is a total Romeo and Juliet set up for a plot as both lovers come from two different worlds. Then we jump ahead to Mels starting to assimilate to the hipster life style. Then as he tries to become more Hipster for Polly we see him considered to be a traitor by his old friends in the enforcement group. Eventually as Polly and the now Mel become an item Katya expresses he interest in Mel. She even goes as for as trying on the Hipster style for herself. However, this ends up being a disaster for Katya and backfires on her. At another point in the film we see disaster strike between the two factions as Katya cuts off Pollys hair in a raid in front of Mel. The conclusion is not what you would expect as Fred the leader of the hipsters goes to America and disaster strikes back in Russia.
The one thing that this modern depiction of youthful rebellion in the Soviet Union is that the Jazz within the movie coveys the lively spirit that Jazz has always incited as a genre of music. This of course is used as the main music to sing along with in the musical and all the music within the film describes the emotions that the characters are feeling.  This of course is what Jazz and Blues were meant to convey when they were first played in the United States. This music is all about freedom of expression because it is the first music that you can swing to (which is an informal type of dancing).

Another aspect that conveys a message within this film is the costume design. All the people who follow the Soviet ways of living end up wearing dull colors. This is meant to show the equality among those who believe in the Communist ways of living. This also portrays the idea that everyone is equal because everyone looks the same and is no better that any of their peers. On the other hand those trying to be hipster wear bright and fantastic clothing with makeup and ribbons about their dress. This is supposed to represent the freedoms of expression which is a very radical western idea at the time. These ideas were considered unlawful and could cause one to be imprisoned for just owning the clothes.

In conclusion, I think that the movie was an excellent light portrayal of how some did reject the ways of Communism in a sort of non-violent way. I think that this musical did break the sort of unspoken rules for a Russian film. I did like it for its simple use of the Russian language because I could comprehend a lot of what the actors were saying with the Russian that I know. Overall I would recommend this movie to those who want an abridged version of what the cold war was like in Russia for the generation after those Soviets who fought in WWII.",1489017600,,3627,4.464555052790347
8551946,4,B00AIANILK,"In 2008, Valery Todorovsky directed , or Hipsters in English. Anton Shagin, Oksana Akinshina, Evginya Khirivskaya, and Ekaterina Vilkova starred in the film. The musical comedy-drama takes place in Moscow during the 1950s.

The movie begins with a confrontation between the Komsomol, young Soviets, and the Hipsters, who embrace Western style dress and jazz music. Mels, a Komsomol, chases down Polly, a hipster, through a forest. Their interaction ends when Polly invites him to experience the hipster lifestyle and then pushes him into a pond. Of course, Mels falls in love with Polly from that one encounter and soon begins transitioning into the hipster lifestyle. He buys new clothes, listens to new music, and learns new dance moves. Despite his attempts, Polly is unsatisfied with his changes so Mels learns to play the saxophone and perform. Eventually, Polly falls for him and becomes pregnant with another mans child. At the same time, Mels is shunned from the Komsomols. Polly has her baby and Mels stays by her side. The two move into Pollys mothers apartment. The film ends after Polly and Mels friend returns home from his excursion in America and comments on the presence of the hipster style in America.

Throughout the film, the hipsters dance to and play what they consider American jazz music. Music played a large role to the characters and in various scenes, Mels is seen carrying his saxophone. The musical soundtracks add great scenes to the film; however, the background music also contributes a great deal to the success of the film. The music was perfectly aligned with the mood of the characters.

The costume design of the movie added a whole new dimension to the film. It truly showed the contrast between the hipsters and the Kosmols/other Soviets. The hipsters were seen wearing obnoxious, colorful outfits while the Kosmols were dressed in plain, gray suits.

Overall, Hipsters was a quality, entertaining movie. The music, costumes, and plot made it easy to watch and follow. If you enjoy musicals, I recommend giving Hipsters a try. If you're looking for a film with accurate Soviet depictions, Id recommend looking elsewhere.",1489017600,,2160,5.076056338028169
8551947,5,B00AIANILK,"Must watch for all, that my opinion. The movie about love, self-identity, fight against oppression, friendship, art, fashion. It was created by a great team, from a director and actors to a costume designer and camera men. For those who are lucky not to live in Russia in 50s, it is a great opportunity to look into Soviet life. The movie is beautiful and dynamic but pretty accurately - still in very artistic way - brings you into that time and place. Great source for Russian studies students. Love this move.",1484179200,,512,4.637362637362638
8551948,4,B00AIANILK,"Two cultural references which may not be easily recognized. In the USSR bootleg copies of western music, in the form of playable phonograph records, were made on x-ray film. This accounts for the X-ray being taken taken scene in the beginning of the movie and then a hole being burned in the x-ray  with a cigarette to be a hole for the phonograph spindle. Another was the packed bag sitting on chair. This was a go-bag ready in the case of sudden arrest.",1437868800,5,455,4.481927710843373
8551949,5,B00AIANILK,Gorgeous colors and fashions.  1950's Moscow drab communistic life is uplifted by boogie woogie dance and music and wild rebellion.  Good close face ups in the personal scenes and panorama shots for the grim Stalin reality of communal apartments.,1423094400,,246,5.282051282051282
8551950,4,B00AIANILK,"The video arrived in good shape and plays perfectly.  It is filmed in Russian with English subtitles. I understand that it is not commercially available elsewhere.  Some parts of the story are a little confusing, but maybe it is just ""lost in translation."" The dance scenes are excellent.  Interesting that the first jazz number to capture Mels' interest in the saxaphone is Gershwin's""Summertime"" from ""Porgy and Bess.""  The surprise near the end may haunt back to that theme.",1422662400,2,477,5.076923076923077

8551952,5,B00AIANILK,Great color and music.  A fun and well-made movie.,1408838400,,50,4.555555555555555
8551953,5,B00AIANILK,"This movie had me laughing and crying. I loved it and I recommend it to anyone. On another site, someone has criticized the sex scenes, saying they had no place in the movie. On the contrary, I think they fit right in. The first one using illustrations from the Kama Sutra, was hilarious and had me laughing out loud. The second, with Mel and Polly putting their mattress on the floor so the rest of the family wouldn't hear the squeaky springs of their bed, was so sweet.

There was one scene though that I couldn't understand - maybe someone can help me. Towards the end, Mel sets up a meeting between his friend Bob and an American, so Bob can buy jazz records. Mel leaves and the transaction begins. Immediately the police swoop and arrest Bob and the American.

My question - Was Mel working for the police and did he set up Bob? If so, then it is a sour blemish on Mel's otherwise decent nature. It also makes me wonder about Mel's off-hand recounting of the bad things that happened to his other friends. Was Mel the cause of their misfortunes too?

If not, and it was just a coincidence that Bob was arrested at a meeting arranged by Mel, then the scene should have been left out because of what it wrongly implies.

Can anyone reassure me that Mel was an all round good guy?",1400976000,4,1283,4.355648535564853
8551954,5,B00AIANILK,Saw this movie at the Palm Springs International Film Festival & loved it! So glad it's available now in the U.S. Fun movie with great music.,1397088000,2,141,4.461538461538462
