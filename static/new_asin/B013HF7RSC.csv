7365039,5,B013HF7RSC,This was an awesome extravaganza!!!,1448409600,,35,6.2
7365040,4,B013HF7RSC,"After a slew of crappy events from WWE this year (NXT on the other hand has delivered with every Takeover this year) and a bad build to this event, the only thing drawing me to this was the 2nd meeting between Taker and Lesnar inside the cell (I don't understand why WWE never acknowledged during the build up for this match that they fought inside the cell before in 2002) Anyways, this was a solid show, not good, but not bad, better than most shows this year.

Moments I enjoyed include:

-Del Rio returning and beating Cena CLEAN, but the match itself was a snooze fest.

-Charlotte and Nikki delivered a much better match than their Cena-Esque style match from NOC the month prior. Really liked the finish as well.

-Rollins winning yet another Title match clean. Though the match was boring but at least he's winning clean.

-The cell match between Reigns and Wyatt was better than expected. A nice brutal cell match.

-the awesomeness that was Lesnar and Taker. Bloody, violent, and overall a nice conclusion to their feud. I still prefer their 2002 Cell match, but this IMO is a Match of the Year candidate.

Things I didn't like:

-why can't wwe make up their minds, either have New Day beat the Dudleyz clean or have the Dudleyz win the titles. No one really benefits from this feud.

- Cena only losing cause he's taking time off to work on a tv show.

- the moment where Lesnar starts to bleed yet the camera shows Lesnar's face not even touching the post.

Overall, a solid show and a step up for WWE. A show worth watching.",1447891200,4,1537,4.473118279569892
7365041,4,B013HF7RSC,"United States Champion John Cena vs. Alberto Del Rio - Del Rio made his surprise return to WWE in order to answer the open challenge with the even bigger surprise of having Zeb Colter with him as well.  Del Rio had the advantage early with his strong style of kicks along with having counters to Cena's signature offense only for Cena to come back with a counter of his own as they traded momentum with series of counters & reversals throughout the match playing off their past history with each other telling the story of how this surprise return caught Cena off guard.

Hell In A Cell Match: Roman Reigns vs. Bray Wyatt - Both men started off trading punches with the Cell coming into play very early with both men having their bodies being thrown into it along with various weapons used from Bray Wyatt torturing him with a kendo stick & breaking it over his head to Roman returning torture double time & using a chair in a way we haven't seen before in the cell as they continued to trade momentum using more weapons such as tables to not only put their opponent through but sacrifice themselves as well both in the ring & ringside resulting in what was just a physical fight.

Tag Team Champions New Day vs. The Dudleys - The Dudleys took out Xavier Woods earlier in the week so he wasn't at ringside as both teams went back & forth early with the Dudleys eventually taking control before the New Day was able to take advantage of a miscommunication singling out one opponent using their offense of power & athleticism along with tactics straight out of the playbook of a certain hispanic WWE Hall Of Famer in a solid tag team match.

Divas Champion Charlotte vs. Nikki Bella - It was stated on the pre-show that this was to be one on one with no else allowed at ringside with both girls going at it aggressively early on as the match went to the outside with one diva knocked over the barricade allowing an opening to heavily focus on the back area with different submissions & stretches & impactful offense to the point where you saw the effects when she attempted offense utilizing her back but kept coming back avoiding some of her opponents offense & having one unique counter to a superplex I've never seen before in what was a competitive encounter between both women that told a story of working over a body part.

WWE Champion Seth Rollins vs. Kane - The stipulation here was that ""Corporate"" Kane would no longer be the Director Of Operations if ""Demon"" Kane didn't defeat Seth Rollins.  Kane took control early with moves like a DDT & low dropkick staying a step ahead of Seth catching him in mid-air causing Seth to neutralize Kane's power keeping him on grounded along with using various dirty tactics & strikes as they traded momentum with both men taking it to the air & to the outside using the environment around them which didn't always work in their favor.

Intercontinental Champion Kevin Owens vs. Ryback - Ryback showcased his power early only for him to hurt himself when he mistimed a move allowing Owens to quickly capitalize only for Ryback to still catch him with his power offense causing Owens to resort to different tactics to counter & neutralize Ryback in an average contest that was all about who was able to ""pick their spot"" to get the victory in an average match that didn't surpass their previous PPV encounter.

Hell In A Cell Match: Undertaker vs. Brock Lesnar - This was set to be their final encounter & before I get started for those who like trivia, it should be noted that the announcers did acknowledge that Brock won his only other previous Hell In A Cell match but didn't state that it was against Undertaker over a decade ago making this the third time (technically) in history that there's been a Hell In A Cell rematch.  Brock started out taking the match to Taker right away attacking the midsection to punches & knees & shoulderblocks in the corner with Taker sending Brock to the outside using the ringside environment inside the cell to making him bleed in the opening moments only for Brock to introduce a weapon that resulted in Taker bleeding from his head as they traded momentum using the same weapons & tactics against each other along with Brock taking Taker to ""Suplex City"" destroying anyone & anything in the process while Taker continued to take advantage of his surroundings & use his trademark offense to wear Brock down in a match that lived up to the hype of their series with the only negative being the aftermath (depending on how you want to look at it).

The pre-show match was Dolph Zigger & Cesaro & Neville vs. Rusev & Sheamus & King Barrett.  In the end, this was one of the better events of the year from top to bottom delivering some of the best matches from the current feuds so it's worth checking out.",1447027200,2,4788,4.549361207897793

7365045,4,B013HF7RSC,"Hell in a Cell: United States Champion Roman Reigns Vs. Rusev
Both men took it to each other right from the onset with Roman immediately using the cell and steel steps in the opening minutes only for Rusev to use the cell himself and his power moves to focus on Reign's midsection along with utilizing the steel steps on multiple occasions. Reigns returned the favor dishing out punishment with a kendo stick as both men traded momentum and signature moves, at times in unique and physical ways, with a steel chain also coming into play in a very good opening contest that was physical from start to finish and the best encounter in their series.

Bayley vs. Dana Brooke
Bayley started off hot using her athletic ability to ground Dana including arm drags and a dropkick before Dana focused on Bayley's injured right arm after hyperextending it against the ring rope causing Bayley to have to resort to digging down deep to hit her signature moves and fighting at times left handed in an average match.

Enzo & Cass vs. Gallows and Anderson
Enzo and Cass relied on their quickness and strength tactics in the early going with Enzo going aerial at one point before Gallows and Anderson used illegal tactics and 'tag team wrestling 101' double teaming to isolate Enzo before Cass got the hot tag and cleaned house with Gallows and Anderson having to go back to dividing and conquering in a solid but basic tag team match.

Hell in a Cell: WWE Universal Champion Kevin Owens vs. Seth Rollins
Seth Rollins came into the match with an injured back after Owen's apron powerbomb on Raw. As with the first cell match, Rollins took it to Owens right away fighting to the outside in the opening minute while using his agility and moves such as the sling blade and blockbuster neckbreaker to keep the advantage before Owens focused on Seth's back by sending him hard into the turnbuckles and multiple sentons while even aggressively ripping off Rollin's protective tape. From there Owens displayed a mean streak I haven't seen since his NXT rivalry with Sami Zayn, including sending Rollins flying out head first into the cell and a cannonball against the cell, along with both men trading intense strikes and Rollins using the apron to get a measure of revenge as the match spiraled out of control into an unofficial 2 on 1 handicap affair with fire extinguishers, chairs, and tables being utilized in the process in a great match with the only negative being the ending (depending on how you look at it).

Cruiserweight Champion TJ Perkins vs. The Brian Kendrick
Both men started evenly matched in the beginning chain wrestling and showing off their athleticism before Kendrick targeted TJ's neck knocking him off the apron and utilizing moves like a belly to back suplex and swinging neckbreaker while TJ fought back with his aerial offense including a spring board dropkick and top rope twisting plancha as both men continued to exchange counters and hard strikes with TJ taking a nasty looking back suplex at one point before one opponent finally utilized his veteran savvy in a good match, but a step down from their previous ppv match.

Raw Tag Team Champions The New Day vs. Cesaro and Sheamus
Xavier Woods and Big E represented New Day while the odd couple Cesaro and Sheamus were put together after their best of seven series ended controversially. New Day took control early with Xavier using his fast paced offense against Cesaro before Sheamus used illegal tactics to turn the tide to the point where even his partner questioned his actions with Big E finally getting the hot tag as both teams exchanged power moves, high flying, and double teaming, including moves rarely seen from them, before the trombone and Kofi Kingston's involvement sealed the deal...but not in the way expected in a very entertaining match that left you wanting more, New Day's best ppv defense (so far), and the story of Cesaro and Sheamus working mostly as individuals being well told throughout.

Hell in a Cell: Raw Women's Champion Sasha Banks vs. Charlotte
Before I get started, I thought the entrances for both women were 'Wrestlemania Worthy' while this was also Sasha's hometown. This match started off with a bang before the bell with both women brawling through ringside and in the crowd with an announcer's table being destroyed in the process. The cell immediately came into play once the match began with Sasha even being monkey flipped into it at one point as both women continued to up their aggression using the cell to their advantage with tables, a chair, and the steel stairs all coming into play at various times with both women executing trademark moves using the weapons for more impact before one woman's injury finally came back to haunt her. This was a very physical match and a great main event as both women made history on several levels.

This was another good show from Raw as there wasn't a bad match on the card but some (Crusierweight title, Enzo / Cass vs. Gallows / Anderson, Bayley vs. Dana) having better encounters on free tv or past PPVS while the three cell matches were definitely the standouts. Overall this is a show worth taking a look at for the main events and the tag team title match.",1483488000,,5211,4.770509977827051

HELL IN A CELL 2015

Spoilers

1. DOLPH ZIGGLER, CESARO & NEVILLE VS SHEAMUS, RUSEV & KING BARRETT-insanely fun opening match for the event that was on the kickoff show. All six men were excellent here from the start of the match. Ziggler, Cesaro and Neville used their speed and technical ability to try and stop the brawling and power style of their opponents. This lead to a very competitive matchup with Neville getting the pinfall after delivering a Red Arrow.

2.[US TITLE]JOHN CENA VS ALBERT DEL RIO-this was the last match in Cenas US title open challenge, last because the call was answered by the returning Alberto Del Rio. Like with all of his open challenge matchs this was a great one. Del Rio wanted to prove something here and he did as he took it to Cena. This was a great opening match for the PPV with back and forth action. The crowd was so into Del Rios return and loved it when he got the win here, great match.

3.[HIAC]BRAY WYATT VS ROMAN REIGNS-probably Romans best feud as a solo act would be against the excellent Bray Wyatt. This was a great match with both men exchanging hard hit after hard hit including the use of tables. This match was one huge brawl that lasted for over twenty minutes, excellent match and possibly best of the night. Reigns would go on to win the match but I still feel like Wyatt should have went over.

4.[TAG TITLE]NEW DAY VS THE DUDLEY BOYZ-one of the most anticipated matches of the night for me as two of my favorite teams go at it. Xavier Woods was injured by The Dudleys  on Raw prior to this but Kofi and E were more than game against the legends. This was a fun tag match even with a botched spot that looked worse than it was for Kofi. Still a fun match in a fun feud with The New Day retaining.

5.[DIVAS TITLE]CHARLOTTE VS NIKKI BELLA-Charlotte is one of the best female wrestlers out there and admittedly Nikki is one of the most improved. So I thought this was going to be a pretty good match between the two when this was live. Thankfully it was a good match with both women looking good here. There was one moment in particular with Charlotte reversing a superplex that was amazing looking. She goes on to retain in a pretty good match between the two.

6.[WWE TITLE]SETH ROLLINS VS KANE-this was the match in which Kane would lose his job as Director of Operations if he lost here to Rollins. I don't know about the rest of you reading this but I actually enjoyed this feud. I thought Rollins was the perfect classic slimy heel and Kane was great as the guy who could not stand working with this ungrateful stuck up kid any more. This was a good match that would see Kane use his size and power to his advantage while Rollins had to be his usual self to get the upper hand. In the Demon would fall to the champ with Rollins retaining in a pretty entertaining match.

7.[IC TITLE]KEVIN OWENS VS RYBACK-I am still not sure why the IC title match went on after the World title match but whatever, I love Owens. This was a good match between the two even though it was a short one. A little back and forth that leads to Owens retaining.

8.[HIAC]THE UNDERTAKER VS BROCK LESNAR-the main event of the evening was going to be the end of this feud that started with Brock beating Taker at Mania ending the streak. Going into this one they were one and one as  this was the rubber match in this recent feud between the two. Like the previous Cell match this was a hard hitting battle with both men being tore up. Although it looked as if Taker was going to end the feud with a win it was not to be. The Beast  was able to pull off the victory after a great and really entertaining main event. After the match The Wyatt Family hit the ring to take the Undertaker out, literally.

This was a really good event that all wrestling fans should own. I really enjoyed every match on this card, some more than others of course.",1462492800,2,3883,4.3319559228650135

7365061,4,B013HF7RSC,"The United States Championship: John Cena vs. Alberto Del Rio was just okay. The Cena loss isn't surprising for us because we know hes taking too months off, but for viewers that don't read about wrestling online they are probably shocked by it. Im a bit surprised that Cena would be pinned clean like that since its so rare. However, that puts over Del Rio huge and also puts over the point of the open challenge because they said for months that anybody could win at any time and we just saw it happen. Ive seen them wrestle so many times, but it was a cool moment to see Del Rio back. John Cena losing clean in under ten minutes in the first match on a PPV? So rare, but I like it. The Hell in a Cell: Bray Wyatt vs. Roman Reigns was an excellent match that gets just over four stars out of five from me because it was the physical encounter they promised it would be. They broke tables, they used chairs, they used kendo sticks and they had some entertaining nearfalls as well. In addition to that, they were given over 20 minutes to tell a story and it led to the selling to be more realistic as well. Reigns was selling the ribs a lot and then he made that big comeback with the Spear off the apron through the table. I picked Wyatt to win because I thought there would be interference from his family and I got that wrong. Reigns getting the win ends the rivalry although Im not sure who Reigns would feud with next. The Tag Team Championship: The New Days Big E & Kofi Kingston vs. The Dudley Boyz was a cheap win for the heel champs, which is perfectly fine because thats what heels should do. They didn't have enough time to really have a classic match, but it was good for the time given. I hope the New Day holds the titles for a year or more. They are the best team in WWE and are better when they are holding gold, so just keep it on them. Im fine with the Dudleys continuing to chase or going back to the line because it will build up to that 10th tag title win for them next year or whenever it is. I predicted The New Day to retain and Im glad they did. The Divas Championship: Charlotte vs. Nikki Bella was a great effort by the ladies again. Give them time and they can put on an entertaining match just like the men. I liked the power moves used by Nikki throughout the match especially that Alabama Slam against the apron. Its similar to when Kevin Owens does the Powerbomb against the apron, but seeing it by a woman with that move is pretty rare. I have a minor gripe because Charlotte really didn't sell the knee injury enough after Nikki spent a few minutes working on it. I know that Charlotte didn't successfully apply the Figure Eight on first try, but it could have been more selling than that. Sorry for being picky, but it was pretty noticeable. I like how the finish was set up. Charlotte winning was my pick and was no surprise since this was the rematch for the title. The WWE World Heavyweight Championship: Seth Rollins vs. Kane was  pretty average for a WWE Title match. With all due respect to Kane, I hope hes not in the WWE Title picture again. Hes almost 50 and just doesnt put on exciting matches. Its not hate for the man. I just want others to be in that kind of position. I think Rollins is as good as anybody in WWE, but even he couldn't get the match to that next level to make it great. Im glad that Rollins won clean because he should have. Now I just hope they book him stronger in TV matches. Hopefully the feud is over because it was pretty silly for the most part. The Intercontinental Championship: Kevin Owens vs. Ryback was he shortest match so far and also the most predictable match on the show. Owens is a great IC Champ, but its time to move on from Ryback. You could tell from the crowd reaction that Ryback isn't getting big reactions anymore. Owens needs a new challenger. Sami Zayn is still a couple of months away, so hopefully Owens holds it until at least he comes back. The Hell in a Cell: Brock Lesnar vs. The Undertaker was a great battle worthy of the Hell in a Cell match and the right guy won in the end. It was a lot of fun and I loved watching it. Im not sure how many more Undertaker matches there are going to be left, but thats a match he should really be proud of. The blood by both guys was a nice touch. I know that WWE will say it wasn't intentional because of corporate sponsors leading to blood being planned, but I think they did spots with the idea of getting busted open. It was the same Lesnar spot that they did at WrestleMania too. Lesnar punching him above the eye is an old school way of drawing blood too. Anyway, the match was a lot of fun and I liked the ending with Lesnar exposing the wood because its different from what we usually see. Taker kicked out of two finishers and Lesnar kicked out of one, so thats fine. Lesnar won in part due to the low blow, which is okay for a face just because it fits their story. I thought Lesnar was going to win and Im sure that most people did as well. That just makes a lot of sense since hes the younger guy. The match was better than their WM30 and SummerSlam 2015 matches as well. I Give this PPV a 7 out of 10.",1448496000,2,5151,4.176884422110553
8727689,4,B013HF7RSC,"HIAC 2015: Not bad, I think the 2 Main Events and the Women's match save it or it might have been a dud show.

Bray Wyatt carrying the Dead Man off after that was nice; same thing with Kane the next night.
