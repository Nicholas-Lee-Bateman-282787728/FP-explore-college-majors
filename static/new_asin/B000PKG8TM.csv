2824381,3,B000PKG8TM,"Ben Willis is an Art College student who finds himself with a lot more time on his hands after he and his girlfriend go their separate ways. Not only does he gain the time they would have spent together, but also any time normally allocated to sleep since he is now an insomniac. The end of his relationship with Suzy has left him unable to fall asleep, so at least he tries to be more productive with his nights and gets a job at a local supermarket. Time is Ben's enemy; with each ticking second he has more waking time to think about Suzy. Until he fights back. Ben begins to daydream that he can stop time, everyone and everything stops except him. In his mind he uses this time to draw and paint the people that he sees. In between his daydreaming and the hijinks of other store employees, Ben meets a girl. She works one of the registers, she might be dating one of their coworkers, and she might be the key to Ben getting his happiness (and sleep) back.

I really liked the story and the idea behind this movie. I thought it was neat how the pieces fit together, or didn't fit together. It was one of the movies where just about everything comes full circle, which was entertaining.

My only gripe, and it is a small one, is that Cashback failed me with its execution. I just feel like the movie could have been better, though I am not sure how. See, not much of a gripe at all. The movie was cute and enjoyable, so check it out...unless of course you might be bothered by a few-minute sequence when every woman is fully or partially naked (all in the name of art!).",1188345600,6,1573,4.275167785234899
2824382,4,B000PKG8TM,"This is Sean Ellis's Academy Award nominated&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/short-film/dp/B000FSMEDS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">short film</a>&nbsp;Cashback expanded into feature film.  Cashback is a comedy first and foremost, and it is about an art school student and aspiring artist named Ben (Sean Biggerstaff), who recently suffered a breakup with his girlfriend of several years.  Because of the break up Ben cannot sleep for over the course of several weeks and this is the time period of Ben's life that we see and he narrates for us.  Ben gets a job at a grocery store to pass his time.  He often imagines stopping time completely and creating his still life art.  In fact, as the film goes one we begin to wonder if he really can stop time or not.  Soon Ben begins to fall for a clerk named Sharon (Emilia Fox) and his episodic insomnia gets resolved.

Cashback is rich with great characters and some hilarious moments.  Ben is dry enough to fittingly suffer through his many experiences, all the while his flat reactions to these other brighter characters is comedic in and of itself.  Ben's friend from childhood Shaun (Sean Higgins) is an amusing womanizer who seems completely at peace with the fact that most women will harshly reject his obnoxious advances.  Ben's boss Jenkins (Stuart Goodwin) is an absurdly arrogant person that also seems entirely unwavered by his failures to pursue Sharon, or even win a football game against a competing grocery store.  Barry and Matt (Michael Dixon and Michael Lambourne) are two colleagues of Ben's who are constantly being ridiculously mischievous and make for some of the film's best laughs.  Another colleague of Ben's is Brian (Marc Pickering) whose kung-fu training defines him as a person.  This is obviously a character-driven comedy, but it is the development of these characters that makes the more subdued drama work to its advantage.

The short film, which is on this DVD as well, is basically comprised of the scene in the film where we first meet and establish these colorful characters.  It is the most engaging part of the movie.  The only difference between the segment in the short film and the long version is that the long version is slightly edited for sexual content.  I found it strange that in the short film all the girl's are clean shaven but in the long version they suddenly have pubic hair.  Nevertheless, the feature film sliding by the MPAA with just an R-rating is still a wonderful surprise.  The standards have seemingly changed and perhaps the MPAA sees nudity as more pleasing to the eyeballs, as opposed to seeing someone's eyeballs being torn out of their head with pliers.  No matter, you get both versions with this DVD and the film's primary function isn't as a skin flick to begin with.  It is actually sort of disappointing to hear about all the nude scenes anytime I hear about this movie, although it would be silly not to point out that the nudity involves some of the most beautiful women in the world (e.g. Hayley Marie Coppin, Irene Bagach,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Keeley-Hazell/dp/B000LBLVOC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Keeley Hazell</a>).

I've heard that director Sean Ellis is working on a horror film next with Lena Headey.  That has me curious because Ellis shows more technical ability in Cashback than we are used to seeing in most comedies and I believe he has given me reason to look out for his next project.  Cashback is both more entertaining and more vulgar than most comedies out there and it deserves credit for that.  It doesn't seem to be getting the exposure I think the film warrants as it is probably very accessible to an American audience.  I hope it catches on as I enjoyed it very much.",1186963200,61,3809,5.103225806451613
2824383,4,B000PKG8TM,"In 2006, the short film Cashback was nominated for a best live-action short Oscar. Writer/Director Sean Ellis then went on to spin the short about a night-shift worker in a supermarket into a feature about a night-shift worker in a supermarket. Using the same actors, and even most of the footage from the original short, Ellis adds a painful breakup to our hero's life, which brings on a case of incurable insomnia. Looking for a way to cash in on his inability to sleep, art student Ben Willis (Sean Biggerstaff) applies for a job at an all-night supermarket.

Anyone remember Saved By the Bell and Zack Morris's envy-worthy ability to utter the phrase ""time-out"" and thus freeze time? In Cashback Ben has this same ability, but he uses it in a much more libidinous way: to undress attractive women in the grocery store he works at and then draw their nude figures. Granted, these gratuitous scenes are not the crux of the film, but they're likely to be the most memorable to most viewers. As the camera slowly pans over (and back over) the striking nude female forms, the audience is to see Ben as an intrepid young artist, not as a peeping Tom. The artistic presentation of the women, and the flashbacks to Ben's childhood experiences do their best to give this impression, but the extended length of the scenes and their lack of importance to the final outcome of the story, implies a hint of exploitation rather than simple artistic expression. For the most extensive look at the indelible female form since Striptease, Cashback has cornered the market. Cleverly disguised in the form of a romantic comedy, Cashback manages to comes across as an artsy British Garden State meets Showgirls.

With an endearing cast of characters, including Emilia Fox as Ben's new love interest at the supermarket, Cashback offers an intriguing story exploring the complicated topics of relationships and self-expression through surrealistic methods, including freezing and fast-forwarding time. At different points, the world is swirling around Ben, faster than he can keep up, while at others everything stops and he can examine the world between the moments that we live. Eventually he comes to realize that there are times when fast-forward and freeze frame are on equal footing; no matter what, the past can't be undone.

Cashback is the first feature from director Sean Ellis, and while it's clear that he has enormous talent in the fields of both writing and directing, it's also clear that he has much room to grow as an artist. At times the film begins to meander a bit, and points that seem to have real significance to the story are left by the wayside as new plotlines are picked up. This causes the film to play out almost episodically, like several short films strapped together. This is only fitting, considering that Cashback started as a short. Audiences will not be disappointed by the message of Cashback: ""Sometimes love is hiding between the seconds of your life"", but they may find themselves wondering about the presentation of the message.",1184198400,92,3051,4.908914728682171
2824384,5,B000PKG8TM,"this is the most charming romantic comedy in a longtime. as a first-time feature for the director, the camera work is awesome and the casting will keep you in hysterics days after you've seen the film

this feature film was based around a 2006 oscar-nominated short film - the feature has its own storyline, and includes only a small section of the short film. the short film is perhaps better-remembered due to the nudity - very candidly, this is an artist's discovery of beauty in the female form, and there is no need for a buyer-beware warning label

buy this and watch this with everyone you love - you will end up loving them even more afterwards!

2824395,5,B000PKG8TM,"I saw this movie on Netflix several years ago, so I jumped at the opportunity to buy the DVD when I came across it on Amazon dot com.

The main character is a student at a British art college who is suffering from insomnia because he is so upset about a recent break-up with a recent girlfriend.  He takes a job working at a local supermarket at night to take up the time that he formerly spent sleeping.  I don't want to give away the rest of the plot.

The bottom line is that this story rang true to me about the inner workings of a normal male college student's mind.  I found his reaction to the break-up real, the flashbacks to his childhood as real, his interactions with many of the supporting characters as real, and his imaginations as similar to the way an 18-22 year old imagines the world if he had a special power.  The story moves along nicely and I was sorry when the movie was over because I enjoyed every minute.",1512518400,,846,4.391025641025641

I've worked in grocery stores, experienced angry girlfriends, had a few schlub work friends and bosses, so it all had a strangely familiar feel. The technical and camera work was artful.  Sometimes the magical aspect seemed a little overplayed, and the story can move slowly, but other times it really zings.

I was totally caught by surprise by the sensitive and multifaceted portrayal of a young man (the main character of Ben) relating to the viewer his personal life, from childhood, on to his present situation. His fascination with beauty is something we can all relate to, and he seems to perceive it beyond the sexual aspects of it. Being an art student and possessing great talent and sensitivity, he finds out that his psyche simply cannot take the trauma of a break-up that he himself orchestrated. Luckily, his interactions with a female co-worker who initiates a relationship with him, is all that he needed to snap out of it. There is a moral to the story, and I will leave it to the viewer to find out what it is.",1502064000,2,778,4.440559440559441

There are quite a few dragging flashbacks to his childhood, possibly to try and justify a voyeuristic perversion masqueraded as heightened awareness of feminine beauty. Yes, the many nude women in this film are beautiful and lovely to look at and I imagine for that reason alone is why most people are interested in this film in the first place. Unfortunately, as a whole, Cashback (despite it's sad effort to be a deeply introspective portrait of a deeply introspective young man) was terribly misogynistic and dull.",1501372800,,695,4.898305084745763

This version is the result.  Ellis reportedly made the expansion in a single week.  After seeing the film, I believe it.
  Lots of naked girls make Cashback interesting.  The central character, an art student who suffers insomnia, cannot carry the film alone.  Ellis gives him the ability to stop time.  The artist uses the time stoppage to disrobe customers in his grocery store and sketch them.  All the while he morns his breakup with his girlfriend.

2824447,5,B000PKG8TM,"Did you saw the movie <ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND>?

What if I say I was shocked evenly as when I saw that movie or any other movie made by Michel Gondry?
The director just like Michel Gondry has a huge background.
He stars shooting still photos since 11 and became a photographer in Harper's Bazzar with David Lynch. Then I-D, VISIONAIRE, Dazed & Confused, Nu-Mero, He was become a superstar shooting photos as if it looks like movie and finally he made this <CASHBACK>.

Then he made another which is <METRO MANILA>. I will talk about it later.

This movie is pure amazing work of art. Visually and storywise as well as acting, music and so many ways.

This guy is just got out from art college and he is desperate for job. He constantly draw pictures but couldn't have decent job.
Who does.
So he works in a supermarket.
He's got a problem, insomnia. He also broke up with his girlfriend and that causes this.
He has this ability that he just figures out that is he can stop the time. He stops time in the supermarket and strip women to draw beautiful picture.
We before see ugly man -nude model  -posing for drawers and he even farts whole posing.
Then this. He can draw any women posing whatever he wants without any interruption.
He has this girl who he kind of like who also work in the supermarket and she asks him to join in the party. They get along well.
There is this turning point when one of the colleague teased him by calls him and says I am the ownere of the gallary and I saw your pictures and want to have a meeting with you which is a lie.
Not knowing this the artist guy brings his works to the owner and surprisingly the real owner happens to want to see his work. He takes a look and he really likes it.
Then he was able to have an exhibition.
That night when his beloved woman who works in the supermarket came to the exhibition, he says, do you trust me?
And then he shows her the most amazing thing in the world.
Yes it is cheezy but who cares?
It is romantic and it is gorgeous and it is artistic and it is fun.
You will enjoy this film and watch it again and again for sure.

This is a cool independent film idea that kind of gets bogged down by the constant female nudity. Naked people are great, but for a movie that had a cool concept with hints of the supernatural that seemed to be hindered by running time maybe less nudity and more content was called for. What I absolutely love are the interactions between the grocery store workers and the awkwardly British characters all viewed from an insomniac obsessed with the female form.

Man.  And all the crudity of some of the characters.  I know that's realistic, but still.  And at one point I thought I had purchased soft porn.  Not that there's anything wrong with that, as Jerry Seinfeld would say.  But still.  You have to go through all that to appreciate the ending.

The ending....  I have watched the entire movie a few times, but I have watched the ending many, many times.  The ending redeems the entire movie and then some.  And in repeated viewings you notice subtleties.  Like a reference to travel agencies in an advertisement next to the cash register of Sharon.

The Japanese subtitles are off-putting.  Go to the setup menu.  There are two sides, left and right.  The right side has three choices.  Choose the third (bottom) choice.  That turns off the subtitles.  I'm saying this because all the display is in Japanese.  So if you don't know Japanese, you're on your own.  I don't know Japanese.  I used the trial and error method.

2824639,5,B000PKG8TM,"Sean Ellis's movie ""Cashback"" is a remarkable mood-piece evoking the angst-ridden satire of Office Space with a surreal British touch. Emilia Fox and Sean Biggerstaff head a near perfect cast in this imaginative romantic comedy.

Sharon (Emilia Fox) works the night shift in the neighborhood grocery store, apathetic to her work and everyone around her. Ben (Sean Biggerstaff) who has been shown the door by his girlfriend Suzy (Michelle Ryan) and cannot sleep for nights after that soon joins the night shift at the same store. The job is a God-send for Ben. The job does not cure his insomnia but he enjoys the company. He is pushed around a bit, being the new guy, but the team at the store is a congenial and comic bunch.

Jenkins (Stuart Goodwin) as a narcissist boss at the store barks out orders every which way. His coffee cup with ""THE BOSS"" written on it further confirms that he loves the power trip and his job. Ben and friends at the store tolerate him. Stuart Goodwin has perfected the art of doing the bumbling buffoonery bit perfectly. A highlight of the sort of comedy that is at display here is his hilarious team building projects. The football match he arranges with a team of professional soccer players is meant to build morale. His rousing speech has a ring of the high seriousness and slapstick humor of Inspector Clousseau. Obviously his exhortations do not cut it as Jenkins and his team get a sound thrashing. Quite literally. They lose 24 to nothing. This rout is crowned with Jenkins sent to the hospital battered, bruised, and with a broken neck. The Boss is released with a neck brace and a head wound. But disgrace and injury do not prevent him from announcing a party. He is thus terrifically funny, unintentionally so, with an endearing quality despite his imperious ways.

The surreal beauty of the film is evoked by Ben's special capability. He likes to ""freeze time"" and walk around people frozen in time, like Tussaud Wax figures, carefully studying them. He is a painter, a quiet observer, able to extract beauty from the most prosaic and unlikely of moments. Those freeze frame shots with Ben in contemplation are remarkably expressive and is a reminder that emotional resonance can be derived from that now overused, even clichd technique, first made famous in the ""Matrix"" franchise.

The director, Sean Ellis has a subtle, meticulous, eye. The compositions of some of the scenes have the extraordinary sensibility of Richard Kelly at his peak in Donnie Darko. But that moodiness and remove from reality, even when this film is at its prosaic best, never gets pretentious. The rhythm and composition has a relaxed elegance about it. Sean Biggerstaff is important here. He is a natural in front of the camera. His Ben has an alert yet quiet remove from the world. A fitting perspective for a painter of much talent. He has an indifference about life until he observes beauty. He cannot help but occasionally steal glances at Sharon. Sharon revives him as surely as Ben brings the zest back to Sharon's life.

They reveal their dreams to each other. He wants his paintings to be exhibited at an art gallery, she wants to travel to South America. The highlight of the film is the conversation between Ben and Sharon and their delight in each other's company. Always natural, unaffected, the charm and chemistry between Emilia Fox and Sean Biggerstaff is worth calling out. At the risk of exaggerating my fondness for this scene, their screen chemistry reminds me of the remarkably tender scenes of conversation between Terry Malloy (Marlon Brando) and Edie Doyle (Eva Marie Saint) in On the Waterfront. Sean Ellis has Elia Kazan's way with actors. The acting is superb with that vintage British nuance. Emilia Fox's charm works so well with Sean Biggerstaff's disarming earnestness. She has the intelligent controlled screen presence of her father, Edward Fox, the original Jackal in The Day of the Jackal from the 1970s, and her uncle James Fox, that highly underrated actor of The Chase (1966) and Remains of the Day (1992).

Ben agrees to be Sharon's date for the boss's party. It is a perfect night until misunderstandings creep in. This light romantic comedy transforms from this point on to an unexpectedly moving story that is a reminder of those remarkably effective John Cusack movies from the 1980s: The Sure Thing and Say Anything. Sean Ellis's way with music to encapsulate the mood of the film from this point on with a song from an old eighties group Frankie Goes to Hollywood, their perennial hit The Power of Love, transforms the film from satire and comedy to a tastefully conceived melodrama in the tradition of the best films of Cameron Crowe.

When things threaten to unravel between Sharon and Ben, Ben opts to freeze time to undo Sharon's perception of what went on in the party, wrong as her impressions of the matter are. Ben walks around Sharon frozen in time, observes her distraught and sad. He unfreezes time, letting Sharon leave, since there is no way he can push back time.

The mood of ""Cashback"" only strengthens with scenes of astonishing lyricism, utterly authentic with genuine transcendental moments. When I heard the music in the film's end credits, a song at the end of it seemed to capture the entire mood of the film. An unforgettable mood piece by the Norwegian group, Ryksopp: What Else is There?, its pulsing, dreamy, rhythms could be director Sean Ellis's cinematic muse. There is a bit of Bjork in the otherworldly voice of (borrowed) lead singer, Karin Dreijer Andersson. Andersson's voice has dreamier turns of pitch and accent to make this track a curious blend of the best of Abba, Pink Floyd and Giorgio Moroder. This song, like the film, weaves a variety of genres into its expressive canvas.

Ryksopp and ""Cashback"" recall inspiring collaborations between director and composers: Vangelis and ""Chariots of Fire"", Pink Floyd and ""Zabriskie Point"", Vangelis and ""Bladerunner"", Tears for Fears and ""Donnie Darko"".",1358812800,,6002,4.893805309734513
2824640,3,B000PKG8TM,"Cashback (Sean Ellis, 2006)

The description at Netflix for Cashback actually refers to the short film Sean Ellis extended into this feature-length version, and concerns only a single sequence. It makes this sound like some sort of sexist science-fiction softcore; the movie, thankfully, has far more in common with Office Space than it does with some sort of interplanetary version of Gor.

Plot: Ben Willis (Sean Biggerstaff from the Harry Potter franchise) has just been dumped by his longtime, and first, girlfriend Suzy (EastEnders' Michelle Ryan). Seemingly unable to create and having developed a severe case of insomnia, Ben takes a job working graveyard shift at a local supermarket. Eventually, he discovers another talent (or is it all in his head?): he finds himself capable of stopping time, wandering through the frozen landscapes to find inspiration for his artwork. (This is where the description comes in--he stops time during a shift and wanders through the aisles, undressing customers and co-workers alike and sketching them.) But all that, while advancing the plot in a couple of key scenes, takes a back seat to the inherent craziness of graveyard shift at a grocery store, as well as a budding romance with co-worker Sharon (The Pianist's Emilia Fox) that lands Ben in a bind when he runs into Suzy at a party.

It's fun stuff, with a ridiculous but all-too-believable cast of co-workers to provide hilarity, a solid romance angle, and a crew who knows what they're doing, headed up by director Sean Ellis (who would return two years later with the above-average The Broken). Unfortunately, the final sequence of the film takes a turn into the godawful, but it's not enough to completely derail this otherwise delightful piece of work. ***",1354838400,,1762,5.0899653979238755

The movie had its moments. There were some scenes, lines, and characters that made me laugh. As for those who think this movie is ""art"" or a ""meditation on feminine beauty"", well, that's funny, too.

If you're hoping for some good T&A, you'll get it, a bit. Certainly more than your standard multiplex movie.

If you're hoping for a decent rom-com, you'll also get that, but nothing special. It basically follows all the formula requirements, solving the crisis in a very unrealistic manner (even a bit creepy).

One thing that annoyed me was that the movie implies that the male and female leads are both roughly the same age - college or grad school. But the woman is clearly around 30. I found it tough to suspend disbelief and pretend that she was as young as him. And a 30-year-old woman would not act the way her character does.",1346544000,,1195,4.570093457943925
2824654,4,B000PKG8TM,"This one is a tough call. It puts together a couple of different types of movies that, on the surface, might seem at odds. But, somehow, it felt good at the end. Sort of like eating a peanut butter and bacon sandwich.

Here's the scoop. Ben is a budding art student who has just been dumped by his girlfriend. It really threw him for a loop so now he can't sleep. He gets a job on the night shift at a local grocery to fill the time. The sleep deprivation, and accompanying dementia, give him the impression that he can freeze time and move freely within the frozen frame. He begins a relationship with a co-worker and puts up with the antics of his boss and fellow workers.

As I said, this is an odd mix. On one hand you have a protagonist that is an insightful character with whom you have a great deal of empathy. He reviews his life and how he came to appreciate the female form and how that urged him into the world of art. On the other hand you have these goofball co-workers and situations you would expect to find in a movie with Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn. These are funny scenes but they feel as though they belong in some other movie. Be that as it may, this is still a fun watch. The characters a colorful. There is a nice amount of female beauty on display. And, for my dollar, the end was satisfying.

This might be more three and a half than the four stars I gave it but it's still well worth the time invested to watch it.",1345161600,,1441,4.157706093189964

Ben- the main character- tells us his story in this brilliant British film. It is a classic boy dumps girl- boy finds new girl story. The sound track is wonderful (and available on CD- just note that you don't get all of the sound track- some great songs are not included). This movie has nudity- so if that bothers you- now you know. The nudity is a necessary part of the story because Ben is a young art student and views the female form as art. The movie has great visual effects that just add a wonderful texture and enhancement. Cashback was nominated for and is an award winner. This is a ""must have"" DVD.

2824660,5,B000PKG8TM,The Amazon.com review above is very good.  My wife and I enjoyed this film very much.  We finished the film smiling.  And later I wonder why Hollywood fails so completely at making this sorts of fun non-cynical films that aren't for idiots in the midwest with Chuck Norris posters on their bedroom walls?  My guess it that the decision in a conscious one by the Hollywood MBAs because we Americans flock in great numbers to the most mind numbing entertainment possible.,1326844800,,469,4.753086419753086
2824661,5,B000PKG8TM,"Although Cashback is by no means perfect, I found it quite moving, not to mention entertaining and artfully directed.

I thought I would address some of the more common critiques, instead of just mirroring the many rave reviews from other posters.

The protagonist's inability to see beauty much beyond the conventional beauty standards and, more importantly, his own sexual attraction, is adequately dealt with in the scene where he ignores the obese male art model, in favor of the beautiful girl beyond. Also, he mentions in the narration that his one year of art college 'was boring to say the least'. He is a somewhat immature, self-absorbed character, which is quite believable, I think, for a twenty-something, single art student.

I agree that his art is rather dull, although I am not an art expert by any means. The ending where his sketches are magically chosen by an important art gallery is cliched and silly.

Yet, for me, the movie's main appeal isn't about art, or the story of an artist. Neither is it about the main storyline of a young man's attempts to reconnect with another love interest, and reality itself, after an emotionally crushing break-up.

Instead, it's the almost magical, sexual power the female form holds over heterosexual males' psyches. Male sexuality is more visually oriented than that of females, which explains the much greater popularity of porn amongst men. The childhood sexual awakening (in regards to the Swedish exchange student, the softcore nudie mags, and the best friend's encounter with the sexually precocious Natalie) resonated with me. It is refreshing to see this sensitive topic dealt with in a realistic, thought provoking manner.

The main character cannot be dismissed as a sexist 'objectifier'. His childhood crushes on Zola Budd and the schoolgirl with the cast are mostly based on intangibles. He is flawed, but not unsympathetic. By the movie's end, he displays signs of increasing maturity. He begins to connect with the pretty checker Sharon as more than just an emotional support accessory, or a beauty object.

The director deserves credit for including pubic hair and excluding fake breasts on the models, something of which the Girls Gone Wild crowd would surely disapprove. Yet if the director had included highly unconventional beauty objects, the widespread resonance with heterosexual men would have been lost. I agree about Western beauty standards being arbitrary and unfair, but spreading that message was never this movie's intent.",1326067200,4,2510,5.182716049382716

2824689,4,B000PKG8TM,"When Sean Ellis' low-budgeted short, ""Cashback"", became a hit in the Indie Award circuit, it was expected that he'd be offered the opportunity to expand it into a feature; sure enough, it happened, but to his credit, Ellis largely kept his fidelity to the material, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cashback/dp/B000PKG8TM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cashback</a>&nbsp;retains it's wit, off-the-wall viewpoint, and surprisingly inoffensive sexiness. Taking a major male fantasy ('freezing' time, then undressing beautiful women in a public place), has pretty obvious 'sleaze' potential, but Ellis' protagonist, supermarket salesclerk/budding artist Ben (Sean Biggerstaff), clearly uses his fantasy for simply recreating the feminine mystique in nude sketches, not for any physical gratification (of course, if this were entirely true, all of his 'models' would not have been knockouts...which they are), and to playfully pull pranks on co-workers. The feature builds upon the employees, Ben's budding relationship with Sharon (Emilia Fox), and the realm of fantasy his hidden psychic abilities creates for the pair.

2824691,5,B000PKG8TM,"""Cashback"" is one of these strange fall-to-the-wayside type of movies that you feel glad as hell that someone picked out of the proverbial wayside and landed it neatly in your lap.

The main character is Ben, an art student who suffers a tremendous break-up with Suzy, his first real girlfriend, whose exit-stage-left leaves him quite destroyed. He develops a severe case of insomnia and after trying everything to wile away the time, he decides to become a Sainsbury supermarket clerk to kill the extra third of his life that this insomnia has produced.

The supermarket is where he meets odd characters (including an ex-stunt biker and a supposed kung fu master) and discovers his ability (whether real or not is really up to the viewer) to stop time. He uses this newly found ability to sketch (what I found to be) the surprising large number of model-esque supermarket patrons.

The movie is sensual and explores the beauty of all things, in particular, female nudity, Ben's own experiences with his perception of beauty and his object of newly-found affection, Sharon. It also takes a couple of jabs at men and how they look at women, with great moments from Ben's best friend, Sean, and his co-workers, Matt and Barry.

This is a beautifully filmed movie and the director is especially keen on making the women of this movie ethereal. All the women glow, as I do believe was his intention. It is a marvelously achieved piece of work with great shots and lighting and even if you aren't a film buff, this is a truly no-regrets option.",1304121600,,1539,4.774436090225564

I'm sorry I didn't just take b-gat's word for it, because this is just about the lamest movie I've ever seen. It is astonishing, even laughable, that so many people have gushed in their reviews about this film's artistic qualities, stunning visual effects, uniqueness, etc.; I guess this is a testament to just how powerful hormones are.

I give it two stars instead of one because yes, the chicks are extraordinarily hot, which must count for something, and also there are a few worthwhile moments. But if you are expecting something intriguing and stimulating like Run, Lola Run or Amelie or Memento, you will be disappointed.

If you're an adult, unless you have a teenage boy's taste in movies coupled with a need to pretend that T & A is Art (say, you have a cinematically equivalent situation to trying to convince your wife that you subscribe to Playboy for the articles), and unless you haven't seen any of the commercials or other movies that feature the visual effect of a scene being frozen in 3-D while one person continues moving within the frozen scene, you will find this movie boring. Because let's face it, as an adult, you can watch real porn if you want to; otherwise you're probably looking to watch an actually decent movie.

Cashback is what you might get if a 14-year-old boy had written and directed American Beauty, if American Beauty were only 16 minutes long and then padded out with another hour and 15 minutes of characters and situations lifted from The Office, Clerks, Porky's, and one or two John Huston flicks. There is not an original bone in this film's body. Here's the plot: Art student breaks up with his girlfriend. He can't sleep because he's traumatized by the breakup so he gets a night job at a grocery store. He fantasizes at length about how awesome it would be to be able to see naked the breasts, butts, and genitalia of every drop-dead gorgeous woman he happens to spot at a grocery store in the middle of the night, of which, naturally, there seem to be dozens. Mind you, he isn't wanting to see the WOMEN naked, just their breasts, butts, and genitalia--almost all the nudity in this movie actually involves strategically displaced clothing so the guy can ogle just those specific body parts. He tries hard to get the audience to believe that this creepy, extreme level of prurient objectification is actually a love of beauty and art. And, finally, he falls in love with a coworker. That's it. Oh yeah, there's also some stuff about the crazy, inappropriate boss and some crazy, inappropriate co-workers (The Office, anyone?) and a looooooong, irrelevant, boring soccer match for some reason. But you get the idea.

In closing, since I feel it is my duty to warn you away from this movie and I'm concerned that you may think I'm exaggerating about how sophomoric and not-art it truly is, consider: humorous farting is featured. 'Nuff said?",1302134400,6,3075,4.742056074766355

It was incredibly well done with some very cool special effects (not action scenes).  The acting flows easily and you really feel like you are a fly on the wall watching their life the story moves so effortlessly.  The beauty of the film is its study of relationships, time and our dreams; how we approach them and basically how well we spend our short time on this earth.  So it has these deeper issues flowing underneath a funny comedy.  The goofy co-workers and his best friend are funny but not outlandish or unbelievable.  In my humble opinion the negative reviews seem almost exclusively due to the nudity (there is a fair amount of nudity in the middle of the film) but they have missed the point of the film completely.  In my own view I would love to see some more modesty in our culture and prefer the old 50's classy styles to todays tight and cleavage showing dress but it still doesn't distract from the awesome acting and powerful goals of this film.

The nude male model's fat frame hugging the contours of a beautiful female art student was an enticingly grotesque and hilarious enough image, even though a crude fart coyly placed at the moment of disrobing (and don't get me wrong, I love farts) pushed it over the top.  Much of the movies' style hinged on scenes of dialogue being interrupted by the protagonists' long, metaphysical trances, which were strikingly relevant in some parts, incessant and redundant in others. I didn't understand why the film suddenly turned into the Mighty Ducks/Dodgeball for 10 minutes (the soccer game) as if apologizing for all its heaviness with some jolly old fashion slapstick. I guess my biggest beef was with Ben Willis's study of beauty: the film's thematic focus. I found myself chuckling as his ""artful eye"" undressed a cereal aisle full of playboy bunnies: strategically stripped lavender bras and skirts hiked above Victoria secret thongs. Yes, of course, Willis views the airbrushed snapshots of babes with boob jobs as an artist first, appreciating them for all their imperfections (?) and natural (?) beauty, but what can we expect from someone who thinks ""an artist is someone who captures beauty"" the way a shoe is just something that captures a foot? I held on till the end when Willis said something trite like ""I've learned that every second counts"" and then kind of gave up on it.",1295654400,4,1929,5.10126582278481
2824726,3,B000PKG8TM,"What if you could stop time, and just walk around people arrested in the position they were when time stopped?  What would you do?  Why, you'd undress women and sketch them!

Well, this is not the major plot of this movie, Cashback, but it is part of the male fantasy theme, along with scenes like the nude Swedish coed sashaying in front of a young Ben, or the stripper he hires to please his boss at a birthday party.

Aspiring artist Ben breaks up with his girlfriend, and is morose for the rest of the story.  Whether his ability to stop time is real or a fantasy (from weeks of no sleep... as if anyone can survive this), he blots out boredom by occasionally stopping time.  If he needed money, by the way, this would have been a good time to visit a bank.

But he falls in love with Sharon, a cashier at a local grocery store as he fills his non-sleeping time working the night shift.

This is really a shallow story with a titillating theme.  Don't look for a strong woman role here.  If you watch this in mixed company, be prepared for unease and squirming.  Just saying.",1295395200,2,1079,4.318407960199005
2824727,3,B000PKG8TM,"**REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS**

To distract himself from heartbreak, Ben (Sean Biggerstaff) figures out how to momentarily freeze women in place, so he can undress them and draw their naked bodies.  He defends this invasive procedure by saying he's just appreciating their beauty and hopes they don't mind, but never bothers to ask if they would mind.  That mindset made me question if Ben really wanted to capture beauty or just wanted control over women.

First of all, since his idea of beauty is limited to fertile, 20-somethings, this was really about capturing what's sexy to him rather than what's beautiful.  After all, if he wanted to capture his mom's beauty, he probably wouldn't freeze and undress her.

Second, and most importantly, was how controlling his methods were.  If he wanted to draw nudes, he could've drawn the nudes in art class or in men's magazines, where consent is implied.  Or if he had a specific woman in mind, he could've asked her consent first.  Instead, he bypasses consent which allows him to see their naked bodies on his terms, not theirs.  Immobilizing these women also gave off a date-rape drug vibe, making those scenes feel creepy.

I found it telling that he's unable to freeze his love interest, which tells me his freezing women wasn't as harmless as portrayed earlier.  To find real love, he'd have to give up being so controlling.  I also found it telling that when he paints her in the end, he focuses on the beauty of her unique face, rather than her body parts, which he tellingly chooses to cover up.

As for the rest of the movie, it had it's funny parts (especially with the roommate) and artistic moments (I like the scene where, while standing, Ben floats towards his bed).  I also like that the lead is a sensitive male (sort of).  However, the movie was also way too long (the drawn-out soccer scene could've been eliminated altogether).  So altogether, 3 stars.",1294704000,4,1918,4.781155015197569
2824728,3,B000PKG8TM,"A generally very good film, with generally good acting, characters and story. Some elements were a bit unbelievable (a grocery store with only five employees for instance) but all-in-all a feel-good kind of romance/soft comedy film. The main character was a good casting choice, not too annoyingly mopey but not too naive and innocent about the world, and the femme-interest was cast equally well too, coming across as the young-but-old and adventurous yet tired girl-down-the-block type. The supporting characters were good in their comedic relief, and the doses of erotic scenes were more artsy than vulgar. The lighting of the film was well-down, and the pace was slow but fast enough to hold my interest. I liked the mature handling of the romance/love dynamics of the relationships involved as experienced by the main-character, and is main reason the film was a good viewing; as opposed to most romance flicks which are only skin-deep and don't touch on the intricacies of relationships. All in all a good sappy romance movie with nice visuals.",1290902400,,1050,5.1104651162790695

I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes more 'art house' type movies.  The fact that you can now buy it at Target, WalMart speaks to its universal appeal.",1289606400,9,450,4.397590361445783
2824730,2,B000PKG8TM,"Studies have shown that British women have the biggest natural busts out of anyone. Thankfully, 'Cashback' offers plenty of scientific proof to back that claim up. But these copious amounts of full nudity are the only bright spots in this otherwise droll and dreary Brit comedy.

After dumping his nagging girlfriend, morose art student Ben (Sean Biggerstaff) develops a bad case of insomnia. Heartbroken and exhausted, Ben stays up for days on end with no relief in sight. After tons and tons of pretentious narration, he decides to do something productive with his extra 8 hours a night and takes a job as a stock-boy at the local grocery store. His quirky co-workers include a pair of horny cashiers (Matt and Barry), a goofy kid obsessed with kung-fu, a delusional boss (Jenkins) and a cute cashier named Sharon (Emilia Fox). It doesn't take long for the monotony to set in, but when it does, Ben discovers a hidden power he never knew he had: the ability to freeze time. Specifically, he can freeze whatever is happening in front of him, position people any way he wants them and basically wander around the still life that surrounds him. Like any aspiring art student, Ben uses his newfound power to undress the most beautiful and buxom female customers and sketch them in all their naked splendor. While undeniably beautiful to look at, these scenes raise a lot of questions and concerns. How lovable of a guy is Ben really if all he's doing is freezing time for the sole purpose of undressing vulnerable and unsuspecting women and then wrapping his crimes in the name of art? Anyway, Ben grows bored with his new hobby and sets his sights on Sharon. Before he can ask her out though he learns that Matt has beat him to it. Is Ben too late or will Sharon realize he's the one for her? Can these two shy and unassuming souls find love in each other's arms? Will Ben's ex show up at the worst possible time to throw a wrench into his blossoming new romance, forcing Ben to chase after Sharon and explain himself?

Those aren't spoilers by the way. If you've seen a romantic comedy, you know these are standard hurdles for the protagonists to jump over. This is my biggest problem with the movie: it uses gimmicks like freezing time and plenty of naked flesh to try to disguise the fact that, at its core, it's just your standard rom-com with a sullen boy trying to win the affections of a doesn't-know-she's beautiful free spirit while all around them quirky characters constantly threaten to ruin everything they've worked for. There's the possibility for a very interesting subplot after Ben discovers another person who has the ability to freeze time but the filmmakers never explore that route. It would have been a lot more interesting to find out who this person was than to watch an extended soccer match or a wild party at Jenkins' house featuring a barely legal stripper. Not to mention the fact that the film is pretentious as hell. Ben's dialogue is so smug and precious trying to pass for deep. How can you take a line like "" Every second matters because love is hidden between the seconds of time,"" or some other such crap seriously? Why would you want to? 'Cashback' is an okay movie if you're just looking for some eye candy and a few chuckles. Just don't expect anything deeper than that.",1288569600,8,3309,4.654700854700855
2824731,1,B000PKG8TM,"I will start out with something positive: This was a very pretty film. Other than that, it has nothing to offer. The first mistake would be the idea that the self absorbed art student full of ennui makes a sensitive and deep protagonist. I find the fact that he believes that, as an artist, he ""explores"" the idea of beauty to be both hilarious and offensive when really all he does is look at T&A (that all conform to very standard ideals of beauty) for an hour and a half. His narration is at times painfully dull and and at others laughably bad in its attempt to be profound. It is just generally lazy writing: anyone who has gone past writing 101 will tell you that showing is always better than telling, and a movie full of exposition leads the viewer to feel no connection with any of the characters. There were also attempts at ""humor"" that were so badly paced and cliche that they are barely worth mentioning. I also was questioning whether or not his ""power"" to stop time was real throughout, and in the end it seems that it may have been. If it was, then the fact that he is literally going around and undressing women without their consent takes his character from harmless self indulgent angst to someone who commits sexual assault. Seeing as the women in this film are already merely props and catalysts for this character, I would not say I'm surprised, but I do find it morally repugnant.  I mean, honestly, this is a movie that describes love as ""wrapped in beauty and hidden away between the seconds of your life.""  That sounds like something Michael Scott would write.  Ultimately, that's what this movie is: abstractions that don't mean anything thrown in between nude images of random women.

Also, if I was Sharon and showed up to that show at the end, I would have run away very far very fast.  Creeptastic.  And not actually all that good.",1287964800,16,1862,4.526785714285714

There is a lot of great comedic scenes, generally involving sex. Most of them are really funny.

Lastly, the music, it is INCREDIBLE. Some of the pieces are just damn genius and deeply touching, you are probably going to want the soundtrack.

This is an odd mix of chick flick, teen-college guy movie (though in fairness the nudity in this movie is more tastefully handled than it would usually be handled in one of those ""typical"" guy movies), and fantasy.

This kid works in a supermarket at night, where he admires the beauty of the women (apparently, only women who are gorgeous shop at this market) and when he gets bored, he freezes time so he can draw them with or without their clothes.

When it comes to it, this movie is similar to Girl Next Door in many ways, you expect possibly raunchy humor and get a touching romance with some fantastic laughs.
The main character is an art student that passes time at his night job by imagining that he can freeze time. As the film progresses, we begin to really wonder whether he is imagining this frozen time, or is truly freezing time. But other than this element, it is truly a very sweet romance that brings the characters to the forefront, and lets us in to their little world.

Sure, you have elements of a romance comedy thrown into this film, with even a final word on love at the very end of the film.  But to me, the main course in this meal is the male fantasy of the female body, and everything else is just side orders.

The film makes a valiant attempt to explain this fascination, via the main character's flashbacks of childhood experiences such as having a Swedish roommate in the house or checking out adult magazines with his best friend.  Cashback meanders at times while showing the artist's normal work and non-work life, before using the old finding love theme to reach a conclusion to this film.

Unencumbered by big-studio pressures,Sean Ellis took his original idea and came up with a 'gem' in a very short period of time. 'Time',in fact, is the novel aspect of this quirky and beautiful film. The fact that there is much graphic nudity will be seized upon by some as a no-no. But it's truly essential for the story of an art student who takes a boring night shift job at a supermarket to relieve himself of his insomnia(a result of his breakup with his girl friend) and provide needed funds for his art education.

Sean Ellis has taken a fresh approach to using the main character's ability to stop the events of time to allow himself to move within a time-suspended world to revel in the beauty of the commonplace and find real love too. There's a cast of wacky characters that provide humor and a connection to our own everyday lives. It's very, very well done and I found myself moved to tears by the end - both from laughing and having my heart deeply touched by the love story within. Simply put - it HAS to be seen to be appreciated for its genius.

This is one of those movies that gives me hope for the creative genius that all too few people are blessed with. It makes you laugh and tugs at your heart at the same time.

2824772,5,B000PKG8TM,"This is a dream-like film about art, the beauty of the female form, of love lost, and love regained, of the dichotomy of women in men's lives.

This is the story of Ben, a shy, awkward art student who is obsessed with the beauty of women.  His social skills are not matched by his artistry, however, as he struggles to connect with girls.

The film opens with a striking scene -  a high speed shot, played back in slow motion and accompanied by the glorious singing of an opera soprano, magnifying the contortions in the face of Ben's girlfriend as she hurls obscenities and a coffee mug and then a lamp at him.  The shot is repeated again near the end of the movie as another of Ben's girlfriends also shrieks at him in slow motion.

In between, Ben, having become an insomniac over his breakup with his girlfriend, discovers the power to stop time, a power which he uses to further explore his obsession with the female form.  Here, the movie shows off lots of beautiful women in various states of undress.

And this is the true genius of this film, to show the dichotomy of women, that they can be so lovely to men when calm and naked, and also be so capable of turning into these raging demons from hell.

At the grocery store, Ben falls for a pretty cashier named Sharon and then almost loses her over a trivial incident.

The finale to the film is breathtaking in its beauty and artistry.  Sharon reconnects with Ben at an art gallery.  With a kiss he brings her into his stop-action world, and they walk into a suspended snowfall, hand in hand, pushing through the snowflakes hanging in mid-air, glittering like diamonds in the moonlight.  Ben's voiceover at the end lingers in the soul...

...Once upon a time I wanted to know what love was.  Love is there if you want it to be.  You just have to see that it's wrapped in beauty and hidden away between the seconds of your life.  If you don't stop for a minute, you might miss it...

I mean let's get the cat out of the bag here-and-now and get to what really matters... this movie has NUDITY! If a couple shots of the female form is going to get your panties in a bunch then don't sit down to watch this film, please. Though cover art can be deceiving one should assume that the image of a possibly semi-naked girl might imply some nudity.

With that being said, 2006's Cashback is a story about newly single Ben Willis(Sean Biggerstaff, of Harry Potter fame) an art student who's break-up has given him an unshakable case of insomnia.

Ben realizes his inability to sleep might be fruitful if he gets a job, therefore he becomes employed at a local grocery store as a night janitor. With a crazy bunch of co-workers and his own special way of stopping time help to maintain any sense of his sanity against the long, tedious shifts and abrasive customers. Ben feels like he's barely getting by when he meets Sharon(Emilia Fox) a quiet checkout girl who works at the market, and who just might be the perfect distraction.

Cashback portrays an artists mind perfectly and beautifully as we examine Ben's ability to 'stop time' and admire every bit of beauty  around him, even in the hell hole he seems to be stuck in he can find beauty.

""I read once about a woman whose secret fantasy was to have an affair with an artist. She thought he would really see her. He would see every curve, every line, every indentation and love them because they were part of the beauty that made her unique.""

2824780,2,B000PKG8TM,"Cashback is one of the weakest romantic comedies I have ever seen. The acting is just fair. The plot does manage to move along despite the fact that the actors weren't given much of a script to work with. The cinematography is also just average--except in the scene when the young artist Ben floats from a payphone to his bed. In short, this is a light, fluffy film that nobody should take seriously even if they like it.

The action begins when a rather sensitive young artist, Ben Willis (Sean Biggerstaff), suffers a painful breakup with his girlfriend of over two years, Suzy (Michelle Ryan). Ben is so upset that he develops a very bad case of insomnia that leaves him unable to sleep for several weeks. Ben eventually takes a job as a night shift worker at a local supermarket to do something productive at night. It is at the supermarket that Ben meets and becomes enchanted by the lovely young checkout girl named Sharon Pintey, who is actually played rather well by Emilia Fox.

Nevertheless, Ben is shy and it takes him an entirely whopping four weeks from the time he gets dumped by Suzy to the time he starts to date Sharon. Ben, the poor guy that he is, just can't seem to take two steps or even put his underwear on right unless he has a girlfriend NOW. He also begins to imagine that he can stop time so that he is the only person who can move about somewhat secretly--where will this lead him?

Other complications soon develop. Ben's boss at the supermarket throws a party; and of course Ben and the rest of the night shift staff have to attend. What will Ben do when he arrives at the party with Sharon as his date--only to see that Suzy is now steadily dating his boss's younger brother? How will Sharon react to Suzy approaching Ben at the party? How does Sharon figure into the soccer match that Ben and the guys from the supermarket play against an opposing team? No plot spoilers here, folks--if you like this sort of stuff, watch the movie and find out!

The DVD comes with a short version of this film; I actually recommend you watch the short instead of the feature length film.

Overall, Cashback just can't avoid being a day late and a dollar short (no financial pun intended). If you like romantic comedies then you may want to give this one a try. I, however, put this one on my list of forgettable films that try to be good but just don't make it.

There are a few bits of immature humor but it just dragged on.  Did I say it dragged on and on?",1226620800,5,253,3.9019607843137254
2824792,5,B000PKG8TM,"Ok, I admit it ... just like many other people, it was the cover picture that caught my eye (as it was meant to).  HOWEVER, it was the cogent and intelligent comments here (on Amazon) that succeeded in clueing me in to a sensitively written high-brow gem of a movie, which I promptly purchased, and just finished enjoying.

Yes, Ellis' movie has the obligatory dysfunctional 'characters', and  sophomoric humor, required to keep what Shakespeare called his audience's ""peanut gallery"" contingent entertained ... thus freeing him to tell the deeper tale to the rest of the audience in peace.

In this instance, the story revolves around an intelligent, and very introspective, young art student who, shell-shocked from breaking up with his {superficially} beautiful girlfriend, goes through an emotional recovery phase (and a severe bout of profound insomnia) in which his understandings of ""beauty"" (both superficial and inner), and his perception time itself, shatter and rearrange themselves in surreal fashion into a new, deeper, and more mature awareness.

{By the way, the movie title is something of a double pun - the main character, as a result of his insomnia, uses his sleepless hours to work the graveyard shift at a local supermarket, theyeby getting 'cashback' on his surplus time (which seems to drag interminably) ... also, his new love interest, the cashier in same store, asks customers if they want 'cashback' on the card they use for their purchase.}

Anyway, it's a great avante garde movie.  Ellis deftly uses the combination of feminine beauty, and surreal time perception, as a sort of visual zen-koan, in order to help the viewer better empathize with the main character's attempts to reassess both concepts with his artistic mental microscope (like a microbiologist trying to study what's ailing him).  If you've ever been through a near death experience, a major accident, or a particularly deep & memorable emotional experience (good or bad), you'll have a leg up on grasping the slow-motion 'train wreck' altered-state-of-awareness effect (and it's aftermanth) that often accompanies such experiences, and how they often replay themselves over and over again in your mind ... sometimes fast, sometimes slow, sometimes timeless.

It's well done, and very enjoyable.  Stars: 4 1/2.",1225065600,11,2307,5.26158038147139

2824794,5,B000PKG8TM,"I selected this movie for the photo on the DVD cover, having no great expectations, but after watching it and the short film from which it was derived, I am in complete awe of the originality, creativity, and cinematic genius of it creator, Shaun Ellis. It succeeds on all levels: masterful camera work, perfect casting, splendid dialog, characters with whom you can really connect, and a clever, original plot.

Most of us can personally relate to virtually every situation, emotion, and comment made by the lead character. Rarely does a movie so accurately portray so many almost inexplicable emotions such as longing, loneliness, and utter boredom.

The characters are stuck in the most boring possible workplace and each seek their own ways to preserve their sanity. One idiotic pair play childish pranks, while the female lead, beautifully played by Emilia Fox, covers her watch with tape and avoids looking at the clock at all costs....for as we all know, a watched clock moves even more slowly.

The male lead, played by Sean Biggerstaff, however, embraces the slowness of time's passage, and appears to be able to make time actually stand still. During these periods, when everyone else is frozen in place, he roams about undressing and drawing some of the store's more beautiful clientele. As other reviewers have noted, this could have descended into gross pornography, but, as a testiment to the great skill of the author and director, Ellis, it actually rises to the level of art.

The dual love story is also quite moving: the painful destruction of one relationship and the gradual development of a new one. At all times, both are absolutely plausible and emotionally tone perfect.

In conclusion, there is a much better reason to buy, rent, or borrow this DVD than its cover photo: the simple fact that I and many other reviewers have given it our highest recommendation. So many people just can't be wrong. Please trust us and view this splendid film at your earliest convenience.

A bit of a twist of ""the office,"" meets Indie Films.  I loved it!

The 1st movie that came to mind for me after seeing this was American Beauty. I think it had a similar vibe, both with the story line (the search for female perfection)and with the cinematography. It seemed like too many reviews focused on the slacker humor (which was very well done) in their comparisons, leaving out the depth of the characters and the plot, which I found well done just because it's so generic (boy meets girl, blah, blah, blah).

2824814,5,B000PKG8TM,"When the DVD cover features a half nude young woman, you do not expect to find a profound and deeply affecting movie underneath.  ""Cashback"" is a standout film, one of those original and striking creations that blow you away once every few years like ""Trainspotting"" did, or ""Donnie Darko"" and ""Snatch.""  At once slapstick and quite amusing, ""Cashback"" is a startling meditation on the beauty of the female form introduced through frozen time, wherein the lead character is able to wander amidst the rest of us, stuck in our places, while he variously undresses, poses, and sketches us unaware.  Much of the movie is voiced over, an internal monologue that never tires its audience or slows the film.  The special effects last throughout the movie, fisheye lenses, time standing still, and a positively beautiful ending amidst a time-frozen snowstorm that the two lovers wander through, the individually discernable snowflakes parting in their wake to leave human outlines hanging in the air.  The soundtrack alternates between Ravel's ""Bolero""  and pumped-up house, the  plot taking on similar extremes of comedy, beauty, and profundity.  ""Cashback"" is like an old sweater that you just slide into on a rainy Sunday afternoon, everything is so comfortable and familiar as you microwave your organic popcorn, but at the same time the perspective is startling and original, the world is slightly askew, and you have stumbled upon a movie like ""The Time of the Gypsies,"" or ""Office Space"" meets ""The Matrix,"" if you want a comparison more widely known.  ""Cashback"" is funny, sexy, and wildly original, it moves, sings and transports, there is a hint of mystery; and in the end it is a simple girl-breaks-up-with-boy, boy-meets-new-girl story: but no one has told it like this before.",1212796800,3,1781,5.113793103448276
2824815,4,B000PKG8TM,"Cashback stands out because you hear the protagonist discuss each and every detail with himself which is what you hear in the form of his voice and something they usually call monologue. It made me smile to see how the character reads a lot of books following his breakup trying to travel and acquire wings or some temporary form of a ""just be"" existance.

There are many films that assume artistic license. Some do good and some do bad. Cashback takes the whole artistic license to a level where you won't even notice just how unbelievably dreamy and awake and scientific the film is at the same time.

Cashback is a bit like LITTLE CHILDREN, settles it's society scores not unlike SHOP GIRL but it is at the same time very interesting. I love the start of the film. One liberty the film-makers have taken is to actually slow the pace of the film as and when convenient. When the pace is slowed, words, opinions, thoughts, reactions, rewinds follow and it is most amazing to watch.

A must see for anyone who's still reading.

2824816,5,B000PKG8TM,"CASHBACK is one of the first movies I've seen this year that got me. I thought it would be a simple comedy and wasn't expecting much, but I digress.

Ben Willis (BIGGERSTAFF) is an art student who has recently hit a rough patch in his life as he breaks up with his girlfriend. He develops one of the worst cases of insomnia and after trying everything, Willis gives up. After reading tons of books, he finally applies for a job in the local supermarket's night shift.

Even doing a boring job doesn't deter Willis' creative side as he 'freezes time' as he puts it himself, and draws nude pictures of the women in the supermarket. But even during a scene which portrays full frontal and some genital shots, it's not pornographic (as I've seen numerous people name it). It's art.

The entire movie is basically a piece of art, no matter what way you look at it. Biggerstaff's natural charisma, whether he's elated, or melancholic or just sketching, will always draw you in immediately.

On that note, I'd like to add that I found Sean Biggerstaff (Willis) outstanding in this movie. Throughout the entire process, he shows that he's mostly 'lost' in our world. Though he didn't quite say it, the look in his eyes conveyed a lot more. It was as though he forcibly grabbed your attention and didn't allow you to look away until the very end. I very nearly clapped at the end of it. That's what it means to be a good actor.

Overall, it's very unique movie that'll definitely take you by surprise and show you some introspective. It's a slow movie at times with sad moments, but also happy moments and parts where you'll be laughing hard because of the stunts Ben's co-workers pull.

If you like cool looking movies like Snatch , Lock Stock, Layer Cake, Fight club , you will enjoy the cinematography of this film.  All in all a cute, slightly Artsy (be comfortable with some nude female human form or this aint for you) film. Perfect for the college movie snob to the older couple who like to take in the occasional independent film.  The nudity is not sexual content but more artistic.

1. An interesting narrative about Insomnia: but fails badly and constantly works to redeem, or rather replay itself, as if it somehow worked the first time you saw and heard it.
2. A tale about lost love: that never really gels or comes around or convinces you that there's nothing more in the Art School world than puppy love.
3. Growing up as a boy in England: that doesn't ever endear itself to the viewer at all and only serves to make the film longer and not any more interesting.
4. Working at an incredibly dull lint-ball-per-hour job: but abandons it as soon as it becomes interesting to show you some gratuitous football.

6. A Tim Curry-esque (Matt) comic relief: that is only slightly realized and comes off like luke-warm weak tea on a cold day.
7. An obscure but trendy soundtrack: that doesn't do much for the film or give it lifts where it's so badly needed but rather drags it down into murky cesspools, making you wonder: Who scored this?
8. Character montage scenes that are as dull as they are acted.
9. Donnie Darko-esque time warp movements that seem contrived and out of place.

2824832,4,B000PKG8TM,"I am just back from living in the UK for two years. I have to say that while I did not come back to the US with an accent (darn it), I did come back with an appreciation for some British movie sensibilities.

This movie is not the exploration of titillation that many may assume from its cover art or from the movies it gets grouped with (Notice what movie comes teamed up with this one in Amazon as the ""buy this one too and get X discount""). The movie description gives you the main assumption. A man hits emotional bottom and finds an ability to freeze time.

It's about where you end up when you feel you have screwed up in a relationship. It's about how you beat yourself up and wish you could undo what you have done. It is also about realizing that sometimes, those things you prayed to change were in fact the best things in your life.

We explore these topics through the eyes of a young man with a unique appreciation of beauty. Being a young Man, that appreciation gets its focus from the female form. It allows us to see the perception of beauty through his eyes. None of us will miss the in your face beauty that gets paraded before us. But will all of us notice the unique play on beauty when it's in a rage and how ugly that can be? Or will we notice that at least one person seems to blossom into their beauty as the movie progresses?

There is more than what you see on the surface of this film. It will likely leave you as happy as ""Love Actually"" did when it ended.  Plus, it will give those that don't want to spend too much time thinking about hidden meanings plenty of shots of naughty bits.... very beautiful ones at that.

But make sure and understand me here, the nudity that is presented does not feel ""personal"" or vulgar. It has the feeling of distance that you would get from viewing fine nude artwork at a museum. The language gets a bit rough at time, but not horribly so. So, while its definitely not for the kiddies, it does not even approach the types of concerns many parents of teenagers might have about the usual movie with nudity.

I suggest taking a chance on this one. In addition, if this is your first look at distinctly British films, try some of these:

However, this DVD is an exception to that rule of thumb.  I freely admit that I bought this DVD solely because of the VERY provocative picture on the front of the box cover while I was out shopping for something new on DVD the other day.  I have absolutely no regrets about that.

I just finished watching the Academy Award nominated original short version of ""Cashback"", the feature length version, and the ""Making of"" feature.  The original short and the feature length versions of ""Cashback"" are hilarious and the writing, directing, casting, cinematography, editing, and the sound were absolutely PERFECT.  The ""Making of"" feature is funny, entertaining, and informative too.

As an aspiring filmmaker, I must say that I hope to one day make a movie as good as or better than this one.  I can't say anything bad about this movie at all.  I highly recommend this to anyone that likes intelligent, well written, directed, cast, acted, and edited independent movies that are funny, provocative, moving, and unforgettable.  This wonderful movie is about a young man in college coming of age, coming out of one intimate relationship with a young woman and then getting into an intimate relationship with a different young woman, and all of the crap that life throws at you while they're going through all of those things and everything else in between.

I got lucky with the purchasing of this DVD.  This is definitely a DVD that you can judge by the photo on the front of the box cover.  This is one of my new favorites.

Now, I have a few suggestions for anyone that is seriously considering buying a copy of this DVD:

1.)  After it arrives in your mailbox or on your doorstep and after you open it, when you put it in your DVD player to watch it, go to the ""Special Features"" section first and watch the Academy Award nominated short version of ""Cashback"" first.

2.)  Don't watch this movie with ANY kids because it is absolutely NOT appropriate for ANYONE under the age(s) of 17/18 without a parent or legal guardian present during the viewing of this movie.  Yeah, this movie contains a lot of nudity and simulated semi-graphic sex and not so graphic implied male [...].  However, it is the mature adult themes in this movie that make it a VERY bad choice for viewing by any naive high school age teenagers.

This movie is not as sophomoric or misogynistic as the front box cover photo implies.  This is NOT a European independent ""American Pie"", ""Accepted"", ""Road Trip"", or ""Knocked Up"" kind of movie.  However, if you think that your teenaged son or daughter is mature enough to understand this movie's mature adult themes and that it's okay for them to watch this DVD alone or with their friends, then disregard this warning/recommendation all together.

3.)  My final recommendation.  Watch this movie with your phone and cellphone turned off.  Eliminate any and all possible distractions while you watch this movie.  That includes any preconceived notions or expectations that you may have because this movie is unique.  So, I won't compare this movie to any other movies here, other than what I stated in recommendation #2 about what other DVDs this DVD is NOT at all like, because that might take something away from your viewing experience and I don't want to do that.

So, buy this DVD, put it your DVD player, sit back, relax, and...enjoy the movie!",1200960000,5,3494,4.699013157894737

2824835,4,B000PKG8TM,"After watching this film the word that comes to mind is WOW!

As a young child I frequently had a similar fantasy myself about stopping time and going on all sorts of adventures.  So after seeing this film on the shelves of Target I became rather intrigued by the story, and after doing a bit of research I purchased it.

What we have is an incredible well written film that somehow combines the painful emotions of a break up, a love story, some comedy, a little mental fantasy and even a touch of sci-fi.  Unlike many other films that try to do this, Cashback succeeds with this mix rather spectacularly.

Most of us know the pain of a broken heart, and Sean Biggerstaff who plays Ben certainly manages to capture that feeling.  The constant memory triggers, the lack of sleep and constant wondering where our lost love is, what they are doing.  Even worse for poor Ben is that he is the cause of his own heart ache.  Optimistically he realizes his mistake and comes to terms with it. He also has the good fortune of discovering new love in the form of Sharon played by the delightful Emily Fox.

About the only thing I didn't like about this film is that it seems a little slow in some parts.  However it features a terrific happy ending that leaves us wondering if Ben's mental fantasies are indeed just fantasies, or are in fact reality.  Remember what I said about sci-fi?

One the more pleasant surprises is Michelle Ryan from more recent fame as the new Bionic Woman playing Suzie the woman Ben leaves.  Don't get your hopes boys and girls though there is plenty of female nudity in this film;  Ms. Ryan keeps her clothes on.  On the funny side in the opening Suzie launches in a silenced verbal tirade against poor silly Ben (breaking up with Michelle Ryan what are you on drugs?).  This tirade as we discover after the DVD and in the extra features section, is every bit as caustic as it looks.  Fans of the new Bionic Woman, some of whom questioned her lack of an English accent in that show can also feel rest assured about her nationality.

Word of Caution to those who are easily offended by nudity and language.  There is an abundance of both in this terrific little film.

Enjoy...",1196640000,10,2197,4.472361809045226

On top of that, much of it makes you feel like you're in the Twilight Zone, yet there's some downright slap-stick comedy that is stirred in for one amazing concoction of a story!

The DVD details the life of an artist (Sean Biggerstaff) who is having an awful time getting over his ex-girlfriend who just dumped him.  He's having such a rough time, in fact, that he can't sleep.  I mean, literally - he has the worst case of insomnia the world has ever seen.  Finally, he gets a job working 3rd shift at a supermarket, just for something to do.

While there he meets up with a very pretty cashier (Emilia Fox) and some just plain crazy co-workers.  He looks at even something as banal as working in a grocery store as being an ""artistic"" (if not metaphysical?) experience, and finds himself gravitating towards the lovely blonde cashier.

At the base, what this movie seems to be ""all about"" to me is a sort of meditation on feminine beauty, and the way that (straight) men perceive that beauty.  Yes, this includes the female nude, but in an artistic way as opposed to being sleazy.  The film is full of useful flashbacks that help us understand the evolution of an artist's perception of women.  Many of these flashbacks,in fact, I could relate to in my own life.

Be warned that this is a very ""different"" sort of movie.  Being an independent film, it goes well off of the beaten-track, and to me that's a good thing.  While I'm sure there are plenty of people who will watch this and say ""Boy, that was weird"" I'm also confident that there are many who will say ""Wow, I'd like to see more introspective flicks like that!""  I belong to the latter group.",1190937600,226,2514,5.806539509536785

The small British film ""Cashback"" is a sporadically engaging, but ultimately unsatisfying rumination on art, love and the relative nature of time.

The idea for the movie is, in many respects, better than the movie itself.  Ben Willis (Sean Biggerstaff) is an art student whose girlfriend has just broken up with him after years together as a couple.  Ben is so emotionally devastated by the rejection that he becomes virtually a dead man walking, an incurable insomniac who goes literally whole nights without sleeping.  To assuage his pain and to make the time pass more quickly, he takes a job working the late night shift at a local supermarket.  While there, he develops the sudden ability to make time ""freeze"" at will, kind of like in that old ""Twilight Zone"" episode, ""A Kind of a Stopwatch,"" or the movie ""Clockstoppers"" (though Ben doesn't need anything as mundane as a magical time piece to accomplish the feat).  Most of the movie is spent chronicling Ben's interactions with his amusingly eccentric co-workers as well as with the beautiful young cashier named Sharon (Emilia Fox) with whom he falls in love.

For all its undeniable cleverness and charm, ""Cashback"" never really finds a way to turn its fantastical premise into anything other than an overused gimmick.  Indeed, it's hard to tell what exactly Ben thinks he's accomplishing when he pauses everyone in mid action.  It doesn't even make much sense within the context of the movie's own storyline, since stopping everything dead in its tracks is certainly no way to make time go FASTER, which is what Ben, in voiceover recitation, keeps telling us he wants to do.

The movie is actually at its most enjoyable and authentic when it drops all the silly time-stopping shenanigans and pretentious philosophizing and simply shows us the day-to-day activities of Ben and his fellow employees at the market.  One of the themes of the movie is that time moves more slowly when we are trapped in tedious jobs and activities, yet, ironically, it is those very on-the-job activities that are of most interest here.  Much of the credit for that goes to the delightful performances of Stuart Goodwin, Michael Dixon and Michael Lambourne as Ben's loopy male co-workers.  They are certainly more interesting as people than Sharon and even Ben himself are.

Sean Ellis has written and directed the movie with a great deal of elegance and style, utilizing sophisticated ""freezing"" techniques, a smoothly-gliding dolly camera, and a classical music score to great effect.  The pacing is often tedious, however, and we sometimes feel less like a witness to Ben's bizarre time-stopping ability than a victim of it.  There were certainly times when I wished I had the power to make this movie go faster.

Part of the problem may be that the material was originally made into a short in 2004, then expanded into this feature length film in 2006.  That may explain the feeling we get that the movie is stretching itself further than perhaps it is able to go.  Still, there's much that is good in even this elongated ""Cashback,"" although it certainly leaves one wondering whether the shorter version might not in fact be the better way to go.",1189296000,19,3199,4.910780669144981

And the manipulation of time, which Ben could do.  But he didn't exploit it as some might be attempted to do. Ben used freezing time to explore the beauty of the world.  There was humor and pathos, and yes, there is some nudity.  Ben coped with his insomnia at losing his relationship with Susie by taking on the night shift at a supermarket, where he meets a group of characters, and also Sharon, which had ups and downs.  And the characters he met at work provided much humor.  There is a sweetness to this movie.  A running gag throughout the movie was Ben's close friend, who kept striking out in his quest for women.

The DVD also has the Academy Award nominated short film, from which this full length movie came from.
