1015342,5,6305324808,"This film turned me on to Rap music.  I didn't believe it possible, but it did.  Hyper-kinetic visual and quickly paced story telling, make for one excellent ride.  After merely seeing the trailer for this film, I knew this  must be greatness. The original score for this film is intensely  mood-setting as well.  Every shot was destined to entertain and tease the  audience, already waiting for more splendor.  If you are a fan of Luc  Besson films, such as ""La Femme Nkita"" and ""the  Professional"" you'll love this Hype Williams masterpiece.  It's about  time the torch is carried once again, making violience a beautiful  aesthetic.  Pick up, plug in and enjoy visceral entertainment at it's  finest . . . and you can say I told you so.",923443200,,739,4.708661417322834

1016969,5,6305324808,"I like Belly because of the relationship between Tommy and Sincere was so real. Even if they did not see eye to eye,  they never really argued. I think that Belly also had great  cinematography. The music for the film was well-suited for the movie and well-timed with the scenes. My favorite scene, is when Tommy is having sex with Kisha to get her mind off the argument. This was in total contrast to the loving scenes between Tionne and Sincere. You can really see that they love each other in their interactions. While Buns, on the other hand, really only cares about himself. He may have feelings for Kisha, but he is still gonna do what he do without a second thought about her welfare. I also like the scene where Tommy and Sincere meet at the restaurant. That is a great scene because of the changes and growth that had occurred. Tommy was coming to realize the same truth Sincere had told him about a few months prior. You also see that they sincerely respect and maybe even love each other.",1368144000,2,999,4.453551912568306

On the strength of the cast alone, you should already know not to expect Training Day or Shawshank Redemption.  Belly is a treat for the eyes and ears, and in that respect, it delivers like Karl Malone.

I first owned Belly on VHS, then DVD, and just knew I had to get it on Blu-Ray from Amazon after buying a player and an HDTV.  Sure enough, the colors look amazing, the picture is crisp, and the sound quality is great.  Hype Williams pulls out every video directing trick in the book to great effect, and it doesn't hurt that the soundtrack is also excellent.  Coincidentally, Belly was how I first discovered Sean Paul (performing at the Jamaican club) a good two years before he blew up with his second album.

So while I admit that the plot and acting both are weak, I will always enjoy Belly for the music and visuals (the same reason I enjoy music videos).  The movie looks great in Blu-Ray Quality on an HDTV, so definitely add this one to your collection.",1270857600,,1099,4.400990099009901

1017185,3,6305324808,"Look, I don't exactly think Hype Williams was aiming to outdo the 'Godfather' movies when he made 'Belly.' For me, however, it stands up there with 'Menace II Society' and 'New Jersey Drive' as interesting slice-of-life flicks.

Both 'Menace' and 'Belly' trip up on their grandiose ambitions of portraying gangsters trying (or being led slowly) to turning a page on their lives, but are certainly entertaining in the process. I prefer to think of 'Belly' as a series of scenes set to music, or a long-form music video. Hype Williams would probably hate this characterization, but I say play to your strengths. He knows how to set a visual to music, and it shows in many of the scenes.

True, some of Nas's lines as Sincere - who is just as much a gangster as DMX's buckwild Tommy character, but has a little more room for contemplation, and actually reads books (one of the movie's best and most hilarious exchanges is about Tommy's dislike of books; all I'll quote is ""Shorty can't eat no books, dog."") - are a bit cornball and cringeworthy, but take it in stride.

For me, what elevates 'Belly' above the average 'hood' film is the inclusion of Louie Rankin as Jamaican drug kingpin Lenox. His even-toned, gravelly patois gives the character an uneasy edge. You never know if he on the verge of serious violence, and his showdown with about 15 armed guards and a female assassin is a juicy action sequence. This, along with a side trip to the slums of Jamaica gives 'Belly' an international crime flavor that is usually absent from the average gangbanger morality tale.

Several supporting characters lend the film humor, including 'Menace's Tyrin Turner as a perm-flattened Nebraska hustler, and Method Man as a hired hitman pretending to be a cornball gangster-wannabe (""They call me Ike Luv, patna!""), and I'm still not sure why some people insist that ""there's no storyline."" Maybe they just get all lost during the Jamaican part 'cause everyone's speaking patois.

Is it the best film of 1998? No. Is it a pretty-good, visually-excellent gangster flick? Indeed.",1215388800,,2068,4.863636363636363
1017186,4,6305324808,"I've owned this movie since it's release and I too like many others who have written negative reviews here, didn't get it. At first glance, I was annoyed by the lighting and somewhat unrealistic story. Then, after each viewing things once fuzzy would become clear. The point is not to get too wrapped up in the surface things. The dark lighting of Sincere's crib was to make you focus on how he and his girl interacted and not what was in thier house. Hype had a lot of tricks that you really need to peep. Notice how you never see the faces of the white people. Even in close you only see their mouth moving as if to say they are not really here with us. They bark orders and we stay out of their way. The acting I could defintely let slide because the people he chose all brought a very realistic ""New York"" street sense that is very rarely captured in film. All that being said...THIS IS A FABLE. Bunz is Tony Montana and Sincere is Manolo. This is the dream life of Bunz, the drug dealer vs Sincere's dream of not getting swallowed up by the BELLY of the beast. OX dies a death Tony Montana and Spartans would be proud of. And to top it off Hype throws in his theory (I THINK) on how Malcolm X got assassinated. This movie is a gem and by far one of the most smart, entertaining pieces of black cinema ever. Those who need their plots spoonfed, hate subtlety or seek definite truths should go straight to Menace II Society, a great movie in its own right.

Yes, it was based around drugs, violence and sex, but it was so realistic as to what's going on in today's society, minus women killing their children, teachers having sex with children, rape and other everyday sagas that the world faces. For a dose of reality, I would definitely recommend this film. It's not far from the truth. Maybe not in the neighberhood it was filmed in, but not far from the truth.

However, the film's lackluster script, extremely corny dialogue, over the top editing, and poor narrative by Nas was almost unbearable if not stomach-turning. The only acting that seemed plausible was DMX, (Thats not really saying that much). Instead of releasing this movie theatrically, it easily could of been a 93 minute music video on Mtv. On a positive note, I appreciated the vibrant colors and newly remastered dvd transfer; it incorporated bright greens, saturated blue's and washed out reds. (Jamaica scenes manifest this description the best) the editing coincided well with the soundtrack for the first 20 minutes but quickly deteriorated along with the horrific acting. I wanted to see an actual film, not a eternal music video. I understand Hype Williams wanted to incorporate his music editing elements to the table; however, it suffered in the long run. Now to the acting, Nas as a lead role was hurtful and corny to watch on screen. its not like These hip/hop artists are being asked to portray complex characters, more or less themselves. Nas's poor narration just barely ties the rapid paced and unrelated scenes. Dmx, on the other hand, was the only actor who seemed like maybe he actually did some auditioning before the film; Dmx's deep scratchy voice is powerful and coincides well with his volatile demeanor as well as  profession. As far as the incomprehensible-gibberish speaking Jamaican drug lords go, I think  Al Pacino did it best with his Cuban accent. Enough said. For hip/hop aficionado's or fans of any of these artists should view this film, however, it should be taken with a grain of salt.

1017232,2,6305324808,"The American Dream is an appealing myth, no doubt. The idea that anybody can come from anywhere and strike it rich in America sounds great. The problem, as George Carlin put it, is that you have to be asleep to believe in it. So instead of representing opportunity for everybody it has become code for greed at all costs. And that is where ""Belly"" comes in, an ode to thug live and all the riches that come with it. This urban drama stars DMX (perpetually rapping), Nas, and Method Man and they would have you believe that they earned their cash by selling drugs and pimping as opposed to selling out to record companies. The story barely exists and seemed like a burden for the director who just wanted endless shots of people having sex and smoking drugs. When the plot does poke its head up I picked up on a criminal enterprise that moved shop from Queens to Omaha. Once there the cops get involved and people start getting shot. One couple tries to escape to Africa, but find it easier said than done. And Tommy (DMX) is sent on a mission to kill a minister. But really this film is about selling a lifestyle that doesn't even exist. Come on now, I've known drug dealers in my day, and they didn't live in large gaudy mansions . . . rap stars do. Rather they live in shacks or their parent's basement.

If my response to the film seems lukewarm it is because it is. The directing by Hype Williams isn't that bad. He is able to capture some beautiful images and uses a few creative camera tricks. The lighting never seems quite right, but I'm gonna let that one slide. As a man who has always called for more sex and drugs in films I can hardly complain about their presence here. There people are living life to the fullest and are certainly not being weighed down by bourgeois conventions. All that said this film still fully deserves the big no vote that I am going to give it. As the most nihilistic person I know I am surprised to report that this one really seemed lost. Any image they could flash on the screen that would appeal to the wannabes in the audience was used. The N and F words are used to comedic proportions. Their palaces that represent their gluttony are turned into war zones and destroyed for no good reason. And then, on top of it all, we have to listen to the characters wax philosophical on how leading this life somehow places them on a higher plain than the rest of us. Sorry man, but just because you sell drugs instead of stocks doesn't make you any less slimy than those Wall Street hacks. You're still a businessman. This film is not worth watching. Any social point that is made is made accidentally, and any filmmaking skills the director may have are lost under his love fest for all things gangsta. **1/4",1164412800,7,2744,4.4015748031496065

I also liked the all-star hip hop cast/cameos such as Method man, T-Boz, Nas, DMX, etc.  Also, I've been hooked on some of the movie from the film  like  D'Angelo's ""Devils Pie"" and the acapella version of ""However Do you Want Me?""

Nas isn't a good actor, I didn't really feel is performance. He seemed a little too sluggish/apathetic toward his character and though that might be how he is in real life it really didn't do much for the movie.

The scenes go from here to there without much explanation. You really got to watch it more than once. If you aren't braindead you can capture what is going on. But it does confuse a little bit your first time...

Other than thoose two arguments this movie is exeptional. DMX was fantastic. I thought method man was great in it. Some of the characters are really cool because they are unordinary.

1017295,5,6305324808,"""Belly"" is quite simply a great crime film that's inspired many rappers to begin to act.  The almost all Hip-Hop cast(including DMX, Nas, Power, T-Boz, and Method Man) are surprisingly good in their performances, especially DMX as Tommy.  X plays the dark character better than anyone could.  It's obvious that Nas should stick to rapping, but he doesn't do too bad on screen.  Method Man is very surprising as Shameek, a thug who's hired by Knowledge(Power) to go after Tommy.  Meth, who usually acts in  comedy's, is surprisingly convincing as a pipsqueek sort of guy.  An almost unrecognizable Tyrin Turner(Caine from ""Menace II Society"") makes a cameo as Rico, a local Nebraska druglord.

Basically, this film is an expose of the drug life.  It goes around the world, from Jamaica to Nebraska, and the characters are diverse and true to life.

The only problem is that the film was horribly edited.  Hype even complained that his film was ruined by the editing in his commentary, stating the film was originally 3 hours.

But all that aside, ""Belly"" is a great flick.  I would probably put it in the top 20 list of gangsta flicks.  It has great action, drama, and even a little comedy.  It's also very stylish and is shot very smoothly, especially the awesome opening scene, full of green lights and gunfights(LOL).

1017296,4,6305324808,"Belly is my favorite movie due to one scene: the scene when a group of men dressed in all black with automatics and beamers run into Lennox's {played by Louie Rankin} (the Jamaican druglord who is Tommy's connection) mansion and tries to kill him; drunk and high, he manages to kill them all with an assault rifle (chrome AK-47) by dodging the beamers and hiding behind walls, but it really gets good when he is lying on the floor killing the surrounding intruders but gets kill by a masked woman who jumps on his back and slices his throat ""she must be a fan of SOULJA SLIM"" that is the best scene I ever seen in a movie, although the copied SCARFACE's last scene",1097107200,4,664,4.362903225806452
1017297,5,6305324808,"First of all, anyone that complains about the lighting in this movie has been brainwashed with too many theater realses.  It's people like those that make Producers want to walk on the set and pull the creative control away from the Director and Cinematographer, doing this to try to protect an investment made by the production company.  Do Kubrick's movies always move at desired speed?  No.  If you understood anything about movies besides knowledge gained by watching countless numbers of horrible movies, being the actual mechanics and sub-text going on with lighting, sound design, and editing within this movie, you'd want to watch it a few more times just to focus on one part of the movie with each viewing.  I'd recommend this to anyone.  You don't need to know the slang to understand the movie either, although it would help.  It's a hero's jounrey completely nainling a new form youth rebelion.  - WATCH IT",1091059200,,919,4.883870967741935
1017298,5,6305324808,"Some acting's bad, but besides that ""Belly"" is an everyday crime film, only with alot of style and alot of truthfulness.  DMX and Nas star as Tommy and Sincere(a modern day Butch and Sundance as Sincere puts it).  They are thugs who rob night clubs.  Then Tommy finds out about this new kind of drug, hooks up with his Jamaican druglord friend Lennox(one of the coolest performances), and builds an empire in Nebraska.  Everything's cool until Knowledge(rapper Power) gets locked up and starts screwing Tommy's business up.  He recruits Shameek(Method Man) to hunt them down and kill them.  At the same time, Sincere starts to reconsider his lifestyle.
This isn't the greatest crime drama ever, but it is cool.  DMX gives an outstanding performance.  Nas' Sincere seemed a little dreamy at times, but his role still works.  T-Boz outacts Nas because of the scene when Method Man breaks into her house and she freaks him out when she pulls a gun on him.  Method Man gives an alright performance, but his role was too small.  Taral Hicks plays Tommy's girl Kiesha, who in the end symbolizes woman power as she fights off Method Man.
As for the movie, there are alot of memorable scenes, the most being the opening nightclub robbery.  Neon lights, glowing eyes, and quick getaways.
This is probably the biggest Hip-Hop cult movie.  For these being debut actors and a debut movie director, this movie's amazing.  The best is that most of the same things that we found wrong with this film, Hype(the director) found himself.  It would've been better if it hadn't been edited so much(Hype says in the commentary that the movie was like 3 hours originally).  The last stand of Lennox is a little like the last stand of Tony Montana in Scarface, but it is more realistic and stylish.  Anyways, good performances, great directing, awesome cult classic.

1017378,4,6305324808,"Hype William creates a great movie which is like the typical gangster movie.  The main character starts off, gets more and more successful, is at the top of his game, and BOOM -- it's over.
So it is like that, however, this is a well-crafted urban gangster story with rappers Nas and DXM as the movie's two main characters.
The story also has a twist where both are able to achieve redemption in the end.
I believe that this is a 5-star movie, but I deducted a star.  The reason for this is I already had the old release of the movie and bought the movie for the deleted scenes.  However, there is only 1 deleted scene in a strip club that is censored and only lasts less than a minute.
There also is a soundtrack, however, it is just the old soundtrack that came out when the movie was originally released.
My advice -- buy the original version if cheaper, even thought the black cover does look cooler.",1086998400,2,904,4.337278106508876

1017382,2,6305324808,"While this movie can't be considered a long music video, it is essentially filmed in the Hype Williams music video style.  There are numerous slow motion shots, and also present are the rich Hype Williams background textures.  However while this works for four minutes of booty shaking, it works to hurt a feature length film.
The slow motion shots work to slow down the film (duh) but while this helps in a music video, it seems silly used so much in a motion picture (can you imagine having 30 slow motion parts in The Godfather? ---seems silly right?).
Also, the textures used in the film are cool in themselves but end up giving the film a surreal feeling, and given the gritty nature of the issues dealt with in Belly, I think that surrealism wasn't the way to go.  For example, in the opening scene Williams uses light to give the characters eye's a neon hue, while the rest of thier bodies appear black.  While this looks great for Busta Rhymes in a video, it serves no purpose in Belly.  Why are their eyes like this?  Is it because it helps to tell the story?  Or is it just to show off?
Another issue is Nas' acting.  Not to jump on his back but he's nervous throughout the film and it's obvious he's not an actor.  That is acceptable in music videos or light comedy, but in a film where he is supposed to be comtemplating deep issues, his inexperince as an actor is uncomfortable to watch.  You end up nervous because you know he's nervous.
Hype is obviously talented, but just because he makes great music videos doesn't mean he can make great movies.  After all, just because Michael Johnson can sprint with the best doesn't mean he can excel at marathons right?  It's a different animal, and this one devoured Hype Williams.  Here's hoping he can improve.",1075248000,5,1769,4.507836990595611
1017383,2,6305324808,"When I first heard that Artisan would be releasing a brand new special edition of ""Belly"", I was intrigued. I already owned the original DVD release which was alright but a little light in the special features category. On it, director Hype Williams spoke on a number of scenes that were omitted from the final release. He talked about wanting to put together a ""director's cut"". With this edition, I was hoping that we would finally get to see the footage he talked about.
Much to my dismay, this entire ""Special Edition"" is one of the weakest and most half-baked attempts to re-sell the same DVD twice that I've ever come across. Not only is there no added material from the actual movie but the special features included have me more confused than most viewers were with the original version of this film. The so-called ""Deleted Scene"" is actually just one solid shot of a bunch of people standing in front of some strippers at a night club. When they turn around, their bare breasts are blurred out like some TV reality show or something. I find it very hard to believe that this was ever even intended to be in the movie as the inclusion of it would make no sense once so ever. In fact, I think it's safe to say that it's probably just some daily from one of the filiming days at the strip bar. As for the ""Spoken Word Featurette"", it is actually just a bunch of people performing live poetry based on some of the characters in the movie. What The?!?! The only added feature that has anything to do with the movie is the music video for the song, ""Grand Finale"" off the film's soundtrack. Even the advertised bonus CD soundtrack is not the full album but eight songs from it thrown on a disc. The rest of the features are just recycled from the previous DVD release.
I have always considered ""Belly"" to be one of my guilty pleasures. Many critics trashed it, the film bombed in the box office, but found a cult following on video. Sadly, Artisan chose to hit said fan base in the crotch and the wallet with this awful excuse for a ""special edition"". If you already own the first DVD and the soundtrack, I promise you that you will regret updating your collection with this waste of time. There is no behind-the-scenes footage, ""making of"" featurette, or any ommitted scenes. Nobody from the cast or crew had anything to do with this at all.

So, I'm trying to understand, critics, how did DMX NOT portray this in the movie?? DMX was not only fearless and ruthless, he was pretty damn funny too. NAS plays his buddy and partner ""Sincere"". NAS was also great in the movie. He wasn't quite as risk-taking and evil as DMX was in the movie, but he worked really, really great with DMX as his drug-dealing partner. Also, By far, the biggest criminal in the movie was a Jamaican drug kingpin named Lennox. He was Tommy's biggest drug connection and you got chills just looking at him. This movie has some very brutal violence and action scenes, which may have turned some critics off. Jeez......if you don't want to see that stuff, then head over to the comedy section of the video store. Also in the movie, look for ""Knowledge"", Tommy and Sincere's partner/connection.

This review had me BELLY-up on the floor laughing.  I couldn't watch more than 10 minutes of this thing.  The script was all OVER the place.  It stylized African-Americans as gangsters with money... but, too stupid to hire a real writer who could do justice to our culture.  I do NOT think singers/rappers should consider doing both film AND records unless they really have the time to devote to their craft.  Very few people can do that and NONE of these folks here CAN... REGARDLESS of this RIDICULOUS SCRIPT.  I have worked on Hype Williams videos and feel bad that this ""movie"" even exists for he has done some amazing stuff with music... but, filmmaking... eh eh... this is not where he should put his $$$.  His writing skills suck and, moreover, the rest of us ""little people"" who are not in musicvideoland are not glossy gangsta types.  Magic Johnson did right by not playing this film in his chain.  We got enough problems trying to clean up the REST of hip hop from these loony toon rappers like LudaPRIS and ""Da Dredded Minstrel"" Lil Jon.  And, Malik Sayeed needs to open up his brain a few more F-stops and learn his craft a little better.

1017443,1,6305324808,"Some movies were never meant to see the light of day. Belly happens to be one of those movies. To begin with, when this film was initially released I was restricted from seeing it due to my age. Recently, my best friend gave this movie to me as a gift--I've regretted it ever since. Besides being an overextended music video (Hype Williams directed it) this ""movie"" has no plot or script. It was eccentric and trite; the odd camera scenes and cuts to various locations without explanation were annoying and hard on the eyes. Furthermore, many of the ""actors"" were rappers who had no talent in that field. For instance, Nas' performance in this film is downright nauseating. The man has no type of acting skills whatsoever; I've never seen an individual sound and appear so out of place with a character. The same goes for DMX and the rest of the cast. It's quite obvious that this movie wants to reflect the drug game in the same manner as ""New Jack City"" (a classic film) but fails miserably. The fact that other members gave this movie ratings higher than one is astonishing. This hot-mess of cinema will go down in history as the perfect example as to why rappers shouldn't make movies, let alone be directed by directors with a thirst for opulence. In an effort to spare others' money and sanity, purchase (or rent) ""Paid in Full"" and/or ""New Jack City"" in replacement of this BS.",1069977600,3,1384,4.584677419354839

The plot is barely noticable, it's more or less a look in days of the lives of these 2 criminals.
I think that HYPE should have made the twists more upfront couse a lot of things happen in this movie which makes u wonder, Who was that guy and what's his beef? and Why are Nas watching white kids bully another white kid on TV? etc. etc.
At the end of the movie not much is explained, still it's a pretty interresting piece of work and the camerawork is excellent of course but the movie leaves u more or less confused",1066521600,,686,3.9782608695652173

You minds well say nas and dmx are playing themselves because the movie comes off like their songs. It's ironic how Nas goes back to Africa and Tommy is involved in a spiritual organization. You can't say nas did a bad job because he played himself, a family man who reads a lot and smokes a lot of weed. The best thing about this movie is it's political awareness, like how Tommy is about to got to jail for life and the government bails him out and tells him if he killed this minister he wouldn't do any time. This makes you wonder how many more black leaders were set up by our government. Only if you are really into Nas's and Dmx's music would you understand this movie because their music has a lot to do with the plot of this story.",1065225600,2,877,4.1647058823529415
1017446,3,6305324808,"Music video director Hype Williams makes his feature-film debut in this urban action drama starring rappers Nas and DMX as childhood friends who take two seperate paths in their adult lives.
Nas, who co-scripted the story, plays Sincere, a hustler out of Queens who with his partner, Tommy ""Buns"" Brown, decides to invest in a big-money scheme invovling a new form of high-grade heroin. But Sincere wants out of the game badly. Torn between his loyalty to his friend and his ambitions to become a family man with a legitimate lifestyle, Sincere finds knowledge and guidance through the books. Tommy, however, is a gun-toting madman who's only goal in life seems to be the pursuit of money at any cost. Through their decisions, the two follow their lives down seperate paths with Sincere plotting an escape to Africa while Tommy is caught up in a plot to assasinate a religious leader.
""Belly"" plays itself more difficult than it needs to be at times. The dialouge is so filled with street lingo that only people who truly understand the hip-hop culture will be able to really understand what is going on. While this does provide the film with a level of realism that most films never capture, it may take many people numerous viewings to pick up on what is really going on. Critics were quick to blast this film for the fact that the majority of its stars are rappers who have never even acted before but to their credit, DMX and Method Man do well. Nas as Sincere is about as painful a narrator as you can get. He trys to do Liotta in ""Goodfellas"" but his narration is all over the place. After explaining Tommy's transformation in one scene, he seems to ""rewind"" himself back and act like he doesn't know what is really going on. In some scenes, he even rambles to the point where it sounds like even he has no idea what he is saying.. Taral Hicks is one of the few actual actors in this rapper-dominated movie. She has a commanding prescene as Tommy's ""boo"", Keisha. Louie Rankin's Jamaican drug lord is also presented well. His English isn't great but his performance comes off authentic regardless. He sounds like the real deal, not some bad actor who can't read dialouge but rather someone who understands his character. The closing monolouge by Dr. Benjamin Chavis as ""The Minister"" is the icing on the cake. While some claimed that the movie seemed to glorify many of the elements that Chavis' speech criticized, many of these critics seem to be missing the point all together.
The movie is shot with a lot of dark images as Williams has a little too much fun with the visual end. The fancy imagery seems to overpower the story at times. Aside from the introduction of Method Man's ""Ike Love"", there really isn't a lot of humor in this film. Another problem. It could stand to lighten up at times. It's clearly not a comedy but it could benefit from pulling away from its somber overtone at least a little bit. There is no need to bombard the audience in a dark and somber atmosphere for the full two hours. Even when there are some attempts at comedy, they aren't picked up because we're paying too much attention to the aforementioned ""imagery"" and not enough to the characters.
""Belly"" is not a terrible movie. In fact, it is pretty good but the roughness of the presentation hurts the appeal of the story. Looking past the negative, this movie does have a lot to offer. If you have the patentience to sit through the gritty images and rugged dialouge then you might be able to appreciate the entertaining aspects of this somewhat uneven film.",1063497600,2,3554,4.625

What really makes this a movie worth buying is the images and the music. Keep your eyes open for Method Man's appearence in the movie. If you're into crime movies and eye-candy this is good movie to watch. Not to say that the basics of the movie are not good. The story moves you along with good acting for the most part.

Nas is one deminsional and cardboard as the anti-hero. He constantly talks about going back to Africa? Huh?!  I think we are suppose to belive by his unexplained desire to go back to the motherland we are suppose to believe that he is deep - his character is as deep as a thimble.  DMX however, saddle with a truly bad script and a sad and misguided cinematographer rise above the mire and puts in a truly credible performance.  Tboz is unsympathtic as Nas' girlfriend.  These characters want you to feel compassion for them because they are too lazy to use their skills for anything other than drug dealing, the tired writing doesn't make you feel anything for any of the characters.  They try to top the infamous ending of Scarface with a nonsensical killing of a jamacian drug kingpin by some mysterious painted woman.  Its over the top and unbelievable in its violence.

I've heard several people liken it to an updated ""New Jack City"", but this movie is told in a far different manner. First off, you don't see the movie through the cops' eyes, but rather through those of the criminals. Also, there isn't that annoying undertone of bad karma (don't do drugs and all that), even though it is somewhat thrown in at the end. In fact, the movie can be more likened to ""Goodfellas"" with a modern, urban New York twist, in that it's portraying the main protagonists (or antagonists, depending on how you look at it) in their struggle to rise to the top of the criminal food chain.
Now, there were a few negatives to the film....most notably, Nas' character Sincere got on the nerves at times and didn't really come through as a hard gangster. DMX carried that image all by himself, making you wonder how they referred to themselves as ""Butch and Sundance"". The plot was kinda hard to follow at times and could require you to watch the movie a couple of times, but I didn't complain, as just with ""The Matrix"" you pick up new things each time you watch the movie.

The plot was all over the place, but the film style looked so good that I concluded that Hype used the ""style over substance"" approach. As for the stars, T-Boz should stick to making records because she is not an actress. However, Taral Hicks IS a good actress and singer; T-Boz should take some lessons from her.
The only thing I liked about the movie was the ending because 1.) it signified that the movie was over and 2.) DMX's character and the minister play an emotional scene. But DMX and Nas aren't actors, either. Sure, they're actors when it comes to rapping, but that's another story.
Hype, making videos and movies are two different things, so think about that before you make your next movie.",1019865600,,879,4.569620253164557

1017539,1,6305324808,"I usually like movies with rappers in it. But not ""Belly"". Well maybe it's that the rappers should stick to comedy and/or action films. Becuase when they do a darma turn it's bad. Every thing about this movie is bad and hear is why:
Directing - Hype Willams can not direct an 96 mintue movie only 4 mintue music videos. Plus when your actors are not doing what they are supposted to the director is to tell them what they are doing is wrong and how to do it right. Well, I guesse no one told him that. Oh,no wait I got it:He [is bad] as a director.
Script - Hype Willams also can not write a movie...!!. The dialgo in this movie is horribel. Also when you make up a script it's ment to about something and tell why the movie is named ""Belly"" neather was inculued it that. You also need a good stroyline to carry the movie, it did not have that. I saw it 3 days ago and still wondering what the plot of it was.
Editing - I know there was an editor on this film because all films have them. But what did he do? I don't think he did any thing at all.
Cinemtography - I hated the way the movie was shot. Fast,then slow,then fast and back to normal. Also with all those flashy lights. Just bad.
Acting/Cast - DMX must have been high the whole time while making this movie. I mean he is a pretty good actor. He made good turns in ""Romeo Must Die"" & ""Exit Wounds"" but in ""Belly"" he was bad. His chactor was dumb. Did someone forget to tell him this was movie? And to talk like a person not like he is rapping. Well I guesse he figured it was music video shoot becuase Hype Willams was the director and Nas, T-Boz & Method Man were in the film also. Yo, Nas stick to rapping you do it better. I know you've only had two good cds (""Illmatic"" & ""Stillmatic"") but you are going on where fast in Hollywood. Nas can not act his way about of paper bag. Method Man needs to stick to comedy because ""How High"" was funny. T-Boz she needs to go back to TLC. I guesse I could say the cast had alot of names but they can not act in darmas.
Music - They made a really good soundtrack from this movie. But they didn't include any of it in the film. That was smart! Use a [bad] score. Smart move!
So this movie does nothing for any one. I don't see how any would like it unless there higher DMX in the restuant scene. Other things to mention about this movie:It's slow ... The 96 mintues seemed like 10 hours. The extas on the DVD were junkie. What a waste of time. Do not see this movie...

1017540,2,6305324808,"Hype Williams is arguably one of the best music video directors of our time. From Missy Elliot's ""The Rain(Supa Dupa Fly)"" to
Biggie's posthmous ""Mo Money Mo Problems"" to TLC's ""No Scrubs""...
Hype's extenstive resume is impressive so you'd think that when
Hype would finally make the jump to the thunderous world of motion picture it'd be as vivid,vibrant,and inspired as his countless music videos.
Not really. 1998's ""Belly""-Hype's film directoral debut-is to put it lightly-A MESS!
What's the plot? It's plotting,heavy handed,and VERY unfocused.
What was Hype trying to say with this movie? Was it an ode to the downside of ""the game"" or a ""New Jack City""-esque anti-drug flick? ""Belly"" is very aggraviatliny confusing.
""Belly"" stars DMX(who at the time this film was made was an unknown;then when this movie was released in November '98,he was
a hip hop superstar with a number one album to his credit),Nas,
Tionne ""T-Boz"" Watkins(good actress;I'd like to see her do more movies),Method Man,Taral Hicks,among others. But this high powered cast can't save ""Belly"" from it's lack of direction.
But I have to admit with it's many flaws,""Belly"" is a very nicely shotten film. The cinemography is great and so is the direction. It's a nice looking mess as one person put it.

It's a movie shot like a music video. It's about a lot of different things all mixed in together, as it is in real life. Theres money , greed, envy, love, betrayel, drugs, and the struggle of life. Most of all it's about Redemption and accepting God. I think if you pay attention and try to understand the plot you'll enjoy this movie as much as I did.

1017574,4,6305324808,"Hype Williams directorial debut was solid yet confusing. Belly gives you the feel of an overextended music video gone awry. The first few minutes are focused on a glossy holdup of NYC's Tunnel Nightclub. The two main characters, Sincere and Tommy, played by rap stars, Nas and DMX have masterminded a scheme to expand their local empire and popularize a new underground drug. In their efforts, they enlist a Jamaican drug lord (played by Louie Rankin  who's authentic but small part is noted:)to front them the cash for quick profits. This sounds like a simple plot, but unfortunately a terrible editing job has made this story difficult to understand unless you view it more than five times. After some reasonable success, the operation is depleted and Tommy and Sincere go in opposite directions. Sincere, played horribly by NAS, and his wife, (Tionne Watkins)who is equally as bad, agree that Africa is their safe haven, and they decide to make the move. This, in my estimation is another confusing part of the story. Why Africa? What sensible black couple would just pick up and travel to Africa to start another life? It just doesn't make sense. The story takes another weird twist when Tommy (DMX) becomes entangled with the Federal authorities to conspire an assaniation plot on a Louis Farrakhan character they foolishly call ""The Minister"". This Minister character is a cameo role for Dr. Benjamin Chavis, who recently embraced the Nation after a heated ordeal as leader of the NAACP. This climax is fitting since the story has us totally bamboozled by now. Your probably wondering why I gave it four stars, but my explanation should be suffice. DMX holds this picture on his back, he literally carries it from start to finish. Watching him is like seeing Tupac for the first time as a crazed ""Bishop"" in Juice. Critics say that he simply played himself, if that's so it was a hell of an acting performance..........Otherwise this is a silly story filled with several holes....And whoever is responsible for  distribution, should redistribute with the unedited segments.

1017577,5,6305324808,"Hype Williams feature length debut is an artistic masterpiece of visual, musical, and character dynamics.  Like musical masterpieces such as The Planets, by Gustav Holst, Hype touches every point of the spectrum.  From a cappella to slammin' rap joints, from the absence of color to nothing but a kalediscope, this film is anything but a two hour adaptation of William's music videos.  The story, centered around two best friends, explores their growth apart and there eventual redemption when they step back from the life they have lived and gain some knowledge of self.  The violence and calousness of the characters is the foundation for the greatest of contrasts.  The absence of the value of life to the understanding of the importance of all life.  Very good performances from first timers DMX and Nas, as well as amazing cinematography and lighting place this film in a whole different category than Boys in the Hood and Menace II Society.  To believe that this is another violent ""Hood/Gangsta"" movie is only one of the many reasons that Belly is among the most underrated and misinterpreted films of the 90's.",972259200,8,1118,4.978494623655914

The dark lighting and overall dark mood reflect the dark clouds of  sadness, despair and gloom that cover Black America due to poverty, drugs,  and violence. Very clever. Besides, anyone that knows anything about real  mobsters and gangstas(from any generation) knows that many of them are  nightowls anyway. I had a hard time understanding the language(they should  have also used captions on X, Nas, and Meth in some scenes), but it added  to vibe of the film.

1017580,3,6305324808,"being an aspiring director myself, I decided to check out Hype Williams' Belly.
hype opens the film up brilliantly; images that will forever stick in my head.  i've seen alot of 'beautifully shot' films ranging from the works of akira kurosawa,sam pekinpah, john woo, oliver stone, to brian  depalma among others, and williams surely ranks with these men, at least in  directorial efforts.
the images are beautiful, each frame carefully shot.  there are crane shots, dolly shots, tracking shots, its all there.  my  only gripe is that there were some scenes that were so dark it was hard to  tell who was in it or what was going on.
the actual movie is a whole lot  weaker than the great visuals that hype gave it.  there's way too much  going on in the movie; it seems hype wanted alot for his characters to  achieve.  the characters are underdeveloped and certain characters are  introduced, then forgotten.  others are just introduced, making us wonder  where exactly did they come from.  if williams wanted so much out of his  story, he should have done a 'godfather trilogy' thing.  then he would have  let his characters breathe and really live.  here, as presented, they just  move from scene to scene, situation to situation.  there is a message in  Belly, it just takes a while to get to it.
with a better script, this  movie could have been one of the most beautifully shot action/drama to have  ever graced the screen.  as it stands, its just a great teaching tool.
this is a 'must see' for future directors and cinematographers... there  are just too many scenes that need to be studied.",961459200,2,1599,4.699275362318841

It's like they just tacked on the  ""lets all get togther ednding"" just to make you forget about the  actual theme of the film. It doesn't make the film any worse, just  puzzling. One great thing is how the characters that Nas, X, and Meth play  are exactly how you would vision them in real life. X is hard and crazy,  Nas is down, yet knowledgable and intellegant and Meth is grimy. If you  like these artists, you'll love Belly. If you don't, you'll probably do  better of watching somthing else.

7888379,4,6305324808,"An unrated crime drama, that was unfairly criticized during it's era, it was the reflection how our youth viewed their culture, the direction of Hype Williams was brilliant and original with the use of jazzy camera angles and color to reflect mood and setting,the cast was excellent, DMX ,NAS and the female leads were beautiful to look at , and the dialog was believable about friendship and love, the redemption speech at the close of the movie was powerful, a lot of Nas rap One Love was seen in that moment between him and that child hustler which was powerful, I rank this gem right up there with New Jack City as one of the best urban crime dramas out there,I hope Hype Williams continue to be a video pioneer his work behind the camera had a lot to say , search this gem out for late night viewing.",1520812800,,805,4.409395973154362
