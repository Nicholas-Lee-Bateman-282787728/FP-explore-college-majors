7089314,5,B00VG94FF0,"The best magicians from all over the world are interviewed about the art of magic. From Las Vegas headliners, to underground Japanese legends. Beyond what you think you know about magic, Our Magic is a glimpse into the underground world of secrets, slight of hand, and illusion. Highly recommend for anyone interested in history, performing arts, and of course, the secrets of magic.",1429574400,,383,5.095238095238095
7089315,5,B00VG94FF0,"A wonderful insight to the art, passion and skills these magicians possess. Their pursuit of excellence and showmanship is so clearly defined through this documentary!! I highly recommend this to anyone interested in the fascinating world of magic.",1429488000,,248,5.552631578947368
7089316,4,B00VG94FF0,A true pleasure to watch.  Prefect for the curious who still want to feel wonder when they see magic performed.  Dan and Dave are keeping magic alive for future generations while pushing it forward end helping to evolve an age old art form. Bravo to them.,1429488000,,255,4.521739130434782
7089317,5,B00VG94FF0,"So glad this thoroughly thoughtful and loving documentary is now available to the general public.  How lovely that those with a passing interest in magic will now see the deep thought, passion and love that serious magicians apply to their presentations.

Beautifully directed, edited and lit this film captures the very best thinkers and performers of our time and illustrates wonderfully why good magic is still relevant.

In a word this film is a delight.",1429488000,,458,5.08
7089318,2,B00VG94FF0,You think a doc about magic would have a little more energy. I found it a bit boring and not interesting. I do not recommend.,1481846400,,125,4.04
7089319,2,B00VG94FF0,"I wanted to love this film. From the perspective of an amateur magician, any positive exposure in popular culture to the nuance and subtlety of magic performance should be applauded. Every single person in this film eclipses my own modest abilities without a single conscious thought.

This isn't saying much... but I happily purchased this film legitimately even though pirating would have been a faster method given the cumbersome Vimeo + Paypal ecommerce flow, solely because I genuinely wanted to support the magicians I admire.

I would wager that the directors of this film thought that they were being creative when, given an opportunity to film the greatest technical/comedic/artistic performers alive, they opted to ask faux-intellectual questions incapable of resolution. To have all these luminaries of magic performance at one's disposal, and rather than provide a showcase for the sheer physical/psychological miracles these people can perform, opt for just armchair banter is truly mind-boggling.

In the absence of a performance element to show that the interviewees are genuinely amazing (as only magicians truly appreciate), this film is no different than armchair philosophy/psychology professors BSing about human perception.",1481328000,,1244,5.641711229946524

7089326,5,B00VG94FF0,"If Magic is important to you, then this is something to watch.  There are no magic tricks revealed in this film, it is all philosphy.  If you want to understand at a deeper level what Magic is, watch this.",1464912000,,205,4.230769230769231
7089327,5,B00VG94FF0,"A meditation on the 'art' of magic. Beautifully realized with a diverse cast of characters (all of whom I wish I knew personally) that are interesting, quirky individuals deeply committed to their art.  A gem of a film.",1464480000,,219,4.7631578947368425

7089329,5,B00VG94FF0,"If you are a magician, no matter what skill level, you need to watch this. After you dedicate all your life to this art you ask, ""Why"". This film makes you proud to be a magician and be proud you know the access code to the secret safe of magic buried deep in the mountains of Himalayas guarded by a flying dragon which insists on showing you a card trick with Juan Tamariz riding on the back of it.",1463788800,,399,4.063291139240507
7089330,4,B00VG94FF0,"Good documentary. Tells some of the history of magic, but if you want to know how they do certain ""tricks"", sorry they aren't talking.  Worth the time to watch.",1463616000,,160,4.517241379310345

7089335,3,B00VG94FF0,I expected more. But I really enjoyed it. It is an interview with the world's top magicians. Plus max maven is in it. Not sure why.  Luke jermay is in it. It's a lot of discussion about magic theory. Unless you're a magician you probably will not like it.,1461801600,,255,4.204081632653061

7089337,5,B00VG94FF0,One of the most affecting docs I've seen. Beautifully paced and touches on the personalities and backgrounds of the magicians covered. I'm a psychologist of over 30 years and this doc moved me in ways few have before. You owe it to yourself to give it a view! Beautiful!,1459382400,,270,4.530612244897959

7089348,2,B00VG94FF0,Magician talking about magic.  This could have been done in 15 minutes as a short.  pretty boring unless you are a magician and want to hear other magician's philosophy about magic.,1453075200,,181,4.806451612903226
7089349,1,B00VG94FF0,Very boring.,1453075200,,12,5.5

7089352,2,B00VG94FF0,"boring - talking heads and no magic - it does ask an interesting question: what is magic? in fact a far more interesting question that is answered in this film - if you want a really excellent answer read Giordano Bruno: Cause, Principle and Unity: And Essays on Magic (Cambridge Texts in the History of Philosophy)
now there's a heavy thinker - the first chapter answers the question in a thorough and most engaging manner",1449100800,2,423,4.653333333333333
7089353,3,B00VG94FF0,A good watch for teh average magic fan,1447632000,,38,3.875
7089354,4,B00VG94FF0,As a magician I enjoyed it.  It jumped around a little too much from story to story and really did not have a direction or story.,1447372800,,129,3.9615384615384617
7089355,5,B00VG94FF0,"This was simply marvelous. I've always wondered about what would drive a person who loves magic to take it to the highest degree of craft, then choose to become a professional. I assumed they were out of the mainstream, of course, even fringe-dwellers and statistical outliers. And indeed, that's precisely what they are. That doesn't mean they've been damaged as children, nor are they mentally ill. It's only that while each one is highly individual, they form a circle of like-minded people who deal in illusions and mystery to make the rest of us revisit the experience of wonder. It's probably the same feeling some church-goers get when they've been absorbed into the choir's beautiful voices.

As a kid, I was intent on performing magic for my friends. I found two books at the local library in the section for adults, one published in the 1930's, I believe. It was difficult to read for an eight-year-old, but I persevered. I can't recall the other one, but it wasn't as good as the first. (Sure wish I could recall the title or author.) And then I began to practice in the mirror on my mother's dressing table. For Christmas, she bought me a sort of kit with devices - Chinese coins, cups, and a coffin you could saw in half, among other things. The problem was that there were no little girls who were interested in magic at all, and that's an age when boys think girls are pretty well ""icky."" The boy magicians formed their own circle, so I worked in a vacuum. Guess I just didn't have the talent to overcome my limitations. However, magic - especially close-up magic - and magicians remained a fascinating temptation for me. Once you're bitten by it, you just can't let it go.

It was only when I first saw the Amazing Kreskin that I knew I'd make a terrific mentalist. It's astonishing that many people believe you actually have telepathic or supernatural abilities. I took what I'd learned into fortune-telling and did it to pay part of my college tuition, mostly reading cards. Sure beat working as a bus girl.

This documentary introduced me to magicians who eat, sleep, and practice their craft all day, every day. Everyone included was a performer in either stage or table magic. It included several Japanese practitioners, and a delightful, older Spanish man to whom all the rest of the magicians paid homage as perhaps the best working magician today. I should be ashamed to admit I didn't recognize more than half these guys (and the lone woman), but they're all listed at the end. As far as my investigation has gone today, YouTube has videos of most of them.

You owe it to yourself if you want to learn about the psychology of magic - why the conjurers do what they do, and how they use us to fool ourselves. Don't expect tricks; this is about the art, craft, and philosophy of the field.",1447286400,4,2812,4.629258517034068
7089356,4,B00VG94FF0,You have to be a fan of magic to enjoy this. Not a fan of just magic tricks. Nicely shot. Enjoyable and talented magicians being interviewed and offering their thoughts and insights into the art. I really enjoyed this.,1447113600,,218,4.615384615384615

7089358,5,B00VG94FF0,"If you love magic, you must see this documentary. If you are a magician or an aspiring magician, you must see this. If you just want to know about magic or something new, you must see this. If you hate magic, you must see this. If you are just looking for something interesting to see, you must see this. In other words, JUST SEE THIS FILM! I could write a list of words to describe this film to entice you to see it but there are too many and if you do not see this film, then, in my opinion, you have REALLY missed out on one of the great films about one of the oldest and most intriguing art forms in the history of mankind. Not only that, but you will miss some of the most interesting people you will ever come to know who have blessed the face of this world we know called Earth. I can seriously call this one of the most eye opening intriguing and moving films I have viewed in my lifetime. There will be more, I am sure, but this is one of the top. Thank you, Mr. Wilson.",1445212800,3,979,4.0
7089359,2,B00VG94FF0,Slow but somewhat interesting.  Watch if you are interested in becoming a magician.  Lots of talking heads.  Keeps the mystery of magic alive.,1445040000,,142,5.086956521739131
7089360,3,B00VG94FF0,"There's no question that the intention behind this piece was honorable and approached with the spirit of love for magic as an art form. However it falls short of telling an organized story or communicating a focused point of view. Beautifully photographed and with interesting magicians who are certainly qualified to comment on the skills being discussed, it fails to make clear connection for non-magicians about (most critically) the history of magic tricks *with examples and clear explanations*. I emphasize I was not expecting a bunch of trick reveals. I was expecting a beginning, middle, end structure that left me with a feeling I'd learned something. I never got it. A great deal is alluded to or implied. I wished I could go back and re-edit the whole movie so that I personally could understand what I was supposed to take away. It seemed a long argument on the ineffable nature of magic performance and why it entertains. The good thing about it is that non-magicians can become familiar with a few important magicians they've not heard of and tantalizing glimpses of magic apparatus and 19th-century conjurers who still influence the art can be gleaned.",1443830400,4,1167,4.98974358974359

8710020,3,B00VG94FF0,"I was very excited to see this documentary, not only because of the respect I have for the card work I've seen from director Paul Wilson and producers Jason England as well as Dan and Dave Buck...But because it included so much great talent throughout.
While I thought it was nicely shot, (good cinematography) The style of Q&A was so ""inside"" that it lacked the one thing that makes magic so great.  There were no surprises!  There was nothing ""Magical"" about seeing a bunch of interviews with guys discussing magic. In fact,  it becomes painfully obvious soon into the film that the director is actually going out of his way to feature as few ""magical"" moments as possible.  A creative choice that I feel backfired in a big way.  I truly thought I would feel a lot different about this, and I will probably give it another shot down the road.  By comparison, Ricky Jay's Deceptive Practice or even Richard Turner's Dealt (on a lesser level) were both far more interesting docs for those who want an inside view of this world and its great characters.",1524441600,,1052,4.629032258064516

What this movie is, is a collection of viewpoints on the impact of magic, the power of it, its meaning, how it's done well (or not), its relevance, and how it affects all of us, both performers and observers. It's not flashy but beautifully filmed, slow-moving but thoughtful. The spectrum of opinions here is as varied as the performers expressing them, but there's insight to glean from all of it. While it isn't a documentary of magic's history (and it's not trying to be), and there's no storyline to follow, there's a lot to appreciate from it. And discovering a new performer or two is a bonus.",1511827200,,758,4.532846715328467

There are several stories from famous magicians about what made magic so enticing to them and what it means to them.  Some of the stories are straight hilarious while other ones are more serious, each one making me appreciate my own interest much more after watching it.  I actually watched it enough times that I ended up buying it just in case it gets removed from prime unexpectedly.  Two thumbs up on top of the five stars.",1502668800,,517,4.586956521739131

Well, since that time, I've taken up magic as a hobby, learning basic sleight of hand techniques as well as the rich history of the art and many of the magicians featured in this film, and I absolutely loved the movie this time around. If you're expecting to see tricks then you'll be disappointed, it's not that kind of film; it's more about magicians talking about the craft on a philosophical level.",1496188800,,556,4.683673469387755

This movie has a TED-talk meets interview style with a variety of entertainers who give pause to not just ""their magic"" but what makes a performance or skill memorable, engaging, and meaningful to both performer and audience. Definitely worth watching by anyone who is in the performance category, regardless of being a dancer, magician, mime, or other.
