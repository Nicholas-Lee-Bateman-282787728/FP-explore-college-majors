4904135,5,B005Y3SR0S,"Probably the best season ever after season 2. The first disc was absolutely stunning in color and sound quality. I watched it over the weekend on a 55 inches TV and blu-ray player, completely enjoying every single minute of it. Great job, CBS and Amazon!

Much better than the recent seasons including the last one which was a complete letdown with extremely awkwardly placed non-elimination legs and stupid crazy detours! Extra Bonuses: beautiful people and really funny lines!

The last season was absolutely the WORST season ever. I lost interest completely once they arrive in Austria. The last 3 episodes were wretched to watch!",1324944000,,633,5.076923076923077
4904136,1,B005Y3SR0S,"Episode #1 was good & #2 was pretty fun too until the DVD froze up.  I pulled it out of the player & found it was terribly scratched, both across the disk from the center to the edge & major scoring around the disk tracks.

Checking the other two unplayed disks, I discovered they were also deeply scratched/scored.

Since I'd also purchased Amazing Race Season #4, I opened that one up and found all three of those disks were damaged right out of the box too.

It appears the disk burner they're using is gobbling up the disks as it's producing them, and no one is noticing that they're sending out defective products.  Hey, nice quality control!!!!  A guy with a $100 DVR, making bootleg copies in his garage, would have a tough time making worse junk than what I received.

Amazon is sending replacement copies, so I've got my fingers crossed that the 2nd time is the charm.",1323907200,4,877,4.477987421383648
4904137,5,B005Y3SR0S,"Attention fans of Amazing Race fans write Amazing Race Productions, Inc. (check online for address)let's convince them to release ALL seasons in a limited edition total box set for Christmas 2012 on ""gray"" (non-dvr disks). If you notice, the first 2 seasons were ""gray"" non-dvr disks and contained many extras. Also the picture was outstanding. The sooner you write them the sooner a box set may be possible.
DO IT NOW!!!!!",1323561600,3,423,4.971830985915493
4904138,5,B005Y3SR0S,"Just finished watching The Amazing Race - Season Three... but had to do so using my portable DVD player hooked up to my television. Buyers should keep in mind that most DVDs made ""on demand"" like this set will not play on a DVR machine. I found this out when Warner Bros. released the second season of Falcon Crest on demand; at least their website had a disclaimer. Just a heads-up!",1322524800,3,383,4.408450704225352
4904139,3,B005Y3SR0S,"This is my favorite season of my favorite TV show, and I've been looking forward to getting it on DVD for a long time.  Unfortunately, this DVD-R set suffers from poor quality control.  Two of the three discs that I received have heavy circular scratches/scuffs that appear to have been caused during the production process.  I returned the set for a replacement, but it has the same problem, and one of the discs is completely unreadable.",1322438400,11,439,4.75
4904140,5,B005Y3SR0S,"CBS is continuing to release The Amazing Race on DVD. Season 3 consists of 3 discs with Episodes 1-4 on Disc 1, Episodes 5-8 on Disc 2, and Episodes 9-11 on Disc 3. This setup is much better than Season 2 which had 5 discs and 2 separate cases. The episodes also have closed captioning on them for the hearing impaired. Season 4 is also being released so pick that up too.",1322352000,5,372,4.180555555555555
4904141,5,B005Y3SR0S,"The Amazing Race 3, the season that started the series' Emmy domination, is quite possibly the best all-round season of the franchise.  An excellent, diverse cast of teams, an interesting and exotic Race course, and some of the most memorable tasks ever on The Amazing Race; having the season finally on DVD is long overdue.  Hilarious and fun moments, quotable quotes, beautiful locations, a flood of emotions, and the infamous ""Dieselgate,"" The Amazing Race 3 has it all.  For fans that have been there from the beginning to fans that have just discovered TAR, this is a must have DVD set.",1320624000,6,591,4.8316831683168315
4904142,5,B005Y3SR0S,Season 3 of the Amazing Race is one of my favorite seasons.  I have been waiting for this season to be released....Finally!  This is the first season I watched and what got me hooked on the Amazing Race.  There are some great teams and some of the best challenges.  Good stuff!,1319587200,4,277,4.372549019607843
4904143,4,B005Y3SR0S,"October 25, 2011 -I AM SO GLAD THEY ARE FINALLY RELEASING THIS!!! last year season 2 was released as was survivor seasons 3 and 4...then we come to find out the amazing race 3 & 4 and survivor 5 and 6 are being released!!! awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i cant wait to buy all 4 seasons!!! i love this show and i really hope all the seasons come to be released sooner or later. this definetly gives me more hope that they will!!!

January 10, 2012
So glad that they released this back in November. Hopefully we will see seasons 5 & 6 released soon. Very happy over all with the releases...except for the fact that these ar MOD products...WE WANT ACTUAL IN STORE RELEASES!!!

About the DVD...
The packaging makes a lot more sense than the season 2 release last february. This set has has three discs with disc 1 having episodes 1-4. Disc 2 has episodes 5-8. Disc 3 has episodes 9-11. The picture and sound quality is beautiful! The cover art however is lame compared to the covers of season 1 & 7...it honestly seems like someone got lazy while designing it! Something i was really disapointed in was the bonus features and extras....THERE WERE NONE!!! Because of the bonus features and cover art is why i rated it 4 stars.

About the Show... ***SPOILER ALERT***
This season definetly ranks in my top 5 along with seasons 6, 7, 14, 16. Its so much more interesting in the older seasons when the teams had to figure out where to go rather than just being told. Something i thought was unfair was in episode 3 when Andrew & Dennis were in about 3rd place...they decided to do the fast forward yet it was soo far away that they came in last place and were eliminated.....what??

NOW COME ON AMAZON AND CBS...PLEASE RELEASE MORE!!!!!!!!!!!!",1319500800,3,1741,4.57051282051282

4904145,4,B005Y3SR0S,At the end of this season is when I first became aware of the Race and started watching it.  It was so nice to be able to go back and see the episodes I had missed.  Been a faithful watcher ever since.  This season helps illustrate the point that you never know how it is going to end until it actually ends.,1388620800,,308,3.935483870967742
4904146,1,B005Y3SR0S,I didn't realize both season 2 and 3 were used...they froze up in several places.  I should have sent them back.  My first bad experience wi t h purchases from amazon!,1384387200,,167,4.354838709677419

4904152,5,B005Y3SR0S,"I can't say enough about how good this dvd is!  Except RELEASE MORE TARS!!!!!  This DVD brings back so many good memeries, and even though I know who would win, it is just as thrilling just the same!!",1344124800,,200,4.2368421052631575
4904153,5,B005Y3SR0S,"This is the third installment of this fantastic show.  The rules are the same. Teams of 2 race around the world. In the process, they have challenges  to do and pushes them to their limits. This really is a good season. There are teams that you love, and teams that you love to hate.

I've read a lot of complaints on the discs. My copy is fine. I didn't have any problems with the discs freezing or skipping, and were in working order. The only small issues is that when it came to the spot where a commercial breaks were. I lost the sound, or it was grubbily. It was just in those spots, so it wasn't a big issue.

If you're seen the other seasons, then you'll want to add this to your collection.",1341964800,,699,4.155555555555556
4904154,5,B005Y3SR0S,"I've seen every episode of this series and think this is one of the rare reality shows with true value.

The thing I love most about the show are the locations.  It is the next best thing to traveling the world myself.  Not only do I get to see multiple and varied locales, including many that I will likely never get to travel to myself, but the show producers also do a great job of finding the most unique adventures to complete in each area.  I've learned more about world geography and different cultures than I ever learned in any classroom.

It's also interesting to watch the interpersonal dynamics between teammates and between teams.  I'd be lying if I didn't admit to finding the conflicts entertaining . . . and the stress of travel and competition does bring it out.  But I always root for the teams that are nicest to each other.

And it's rewarding to see how the intensity of the race truly brings teammates closer together by forcing them to work together and rely on one another.",1340755200,,997,4.5
4904155,5,B005Y3SR0S,"As you can infer from the title, I am in firm belief that the final half of the season 3 is in contention for quite possibly the most memorable piece of TAR history.  With incidents like ""Dieselgate"" (where teams filled their diesel vehicles with unleaded [leading to disastrous results]) and Flo's maniacal breakdown, the season became one that shocked and surprised me, kept me on the edge of my seat, and had me screaming and cheering at the TV more than what is considered normal.  As with all seasons, there were a couple of teams that were duds and were just waiting to get eliminated but for the most part, the teams selected showed great chemistry and were very enjoyable to watch.  I will say that Flo (of team Zach and Flo) WILL make you cringe at times and I agree with another reviewer who said it best, it is simply quite painful to watch her compete. Season three is a classic season and an enjoyable trip around the world.",1338681600,,937,4.5
4904156,1,B005Y3SR0S,I bought both seasons 3 and 4 of the amazing race and NEITHER SEASON WORKED. All the discs were scratched up and they sent me the wrong invoice slip so I couldn't return them. I bought them in feb so I don't think there is nothing I can do now about it.,1336780800,,253,3.8846153846153846
4904157,3,B005Y3SR0S,"We were able to watch most of this season, but we had problems with the disks skipping and missed a good 20-30 min. of some of the episodes due to the poor quality disks. Amazon returned them with no hassle, but unfortunately were having the same problem now with season 4. Just sent them back for replacements today.",1332892800,3,317,4.482758620689655

4904160,5,B005Y3SR0S,"I am a big TAR fan, but didn't discover the race until a few years ago. So I have enjoyed catching up as the old seasons are released on DVD. I have Seasons 1, 2 and 7 on DVD and have watched them over and over.  I was so excited to see 3 and 4 released FINALLY!  Just finished watching season 3 and really loved it ... may watch it again right away.  Great cast ... it was nice to see the racers being competitive without being nasty.  These people genuinely seemed to enjoy each other.
Will be hoping for other seasons to be released soon.
Season 3 does not disappoint.  I had no quality issues with my discs.",1327017600,2,611,4.100840336134453
4904161,5,B005Y3SR0S,"I am so glad that additional seasons of the Amazing Race are now available on Amazon.com.  I have been waiting years.

4904162,5,B005Y3SR0S,"The early seasons of the Amazing Race are the best since the participants hadn't become so camera savy. The editing in this season is absolutely superb and the cast is very memorable. Zach and Flo are the most colorful team with Flo having many melt downs and histrionics. She is often painful to watch but to see Zach's patience is something to behold. He deserves his own place in heaven for what he puts up with. Still, Flo is among the most interesting of TAR participants and it is great to see this once again. The other great thing about these earlier episodes is that there was a real challenge to finding the best flights. It seems that today, TAR tends to limit the options for international travel to avoid having the teams spread out. But with so many twists and turns, this is truly one of the great seasons of the Amazing Race. It still is the best thing on network television and each season holds its own special moments, but this is definitely one season you will want to watch over again!",1325203200,5,1006,4.4728260869565215
4904163,5,B005Y3SR0S,"Ordered for my wife for Christmas.  She and my daughters are big on this show, but started their relationship with it after the fourth season.  They are already almost all the way through this whole season.  They liked the race better when the racers were required to do more figuring out of what they had to do, this is a good example. Some humorous characters and even the one's they are rooting against aren't too obnoxious.  Fun times!",1325116800,,439,4.589743589743589
