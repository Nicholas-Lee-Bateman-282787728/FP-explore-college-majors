1009101,1,6305326681,"I watched this online. I've always liked Jean Stapleton.  She was good as were several others in the cast.  But it is one of the worst made movies I've ever seen. The weak, weak story might have been okay as a Saturday morning cartoon in the 70's. Don't waste your time.",1378598400,2,270,4.2745098039215685
1009102,4,6305326681,I found the DVD in good quality. However I did not like the organization of the menu. After some playing around I got it to run as it did not start immediately as I am used to by DVDs. The film itself is a nice spoof on everything from gangster theft to mother-son conflict. It's a one off comedy that some may enjoy.,1336953600,2,317,4.0476190476190474
1009103,5,6305326681,"I only purcased this movie to see Geraint Wyn Davies (who gave a great comic turn), but Ms. Stapelton was marvelous as well!  I thoroughy enjoyed it!",1268006400,,149,4.518518518518518
1009104,5,6305326681,"My wife loves this movie. I bought the DVD for her since she is a Huge Geraint Wyn Davies fan.
I would highly reccommend this movie to anyone with a mother (or as my wife says (mother in law)",1258070400,,191,3.923076923076923
1009105,5,6305326681,"I am one of the lucky ones who owns this movie! So I watch it over and over again and have the same great fun. By all means, watch it!",1053302400,4,134,3.5
1009106,4,6305326681,"OK -- I admit that I originally only bought this video because I wanted to see Geriant Wyn Davies in something other than Forever Knight.
After watching the video, however, I can definitely recommend this to just about  anyone.  The movie is light-hearted fun.  Jean Stapleton is perfect as the  mother who doesn't know when to let go.
The alternate title of  ""Ghost Mom"" would make more sense than the ""Bury Me in  Niagara"" title does.  Regardless of what it is called, watch the movie  and enjoy yourself for 1 hours.",948240000,5,519,4.626373626373627
1009107,4,6305326681,"Bury Me in Niagra AKA in the USA as Ghost Mom has two notable actors-- Jean Stapleton and Geraint Wyn Davies ( Nick Knight of ""Forever Knight""). GWD's characer is a doctor who has an intrusive mother (  Stapleton). When she dies she holds a ""lucky pebble"", ( a  disguised mystical ruby) and her ghost insists that her body be buried in  Niagra. Road trip via ice cream truck, pursued by Chinese gangsters who  want the ruby, the son finally meets his father. GWD hams it up in various  scenes and while the movie lacks some credibility at times, it is a comedy  in the same vein as the Hope and Cosby road trip movies. Being a GWD fan I  liked to see him in a comedic role as Nick Knight was mainly too angsty.",925862400,9,710,4.214814814814815

7887615,2,6305326681,"Jean Stapleton was great as well as some of the other actors.  I usually enjoy Canadian productions....the story line is not bad, but the way it was written was corny.  I am neither better nor worse for watching it.  One could choose something else to occupy your time, however.",1378944000,,278,4.63265306122449
