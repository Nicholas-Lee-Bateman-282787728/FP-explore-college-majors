224065,5,6300198413,"I had to read the story for literature class this semester. I also had to write a paper on the differences between the movie and the literature. And to determine whether the film adaptation did so successfully. There were a few changes to the story however these changes in the film took the literature to a higher level. Not only were you to fall in love with the character of granny weather all, but also see the family structure and the dutiful daughter that so seemed her mothers approval. A wonderful movie! A must see....Do not listen to the negative reviews...it was a wonderful adaptation.",1326844800,,597,4.695238095238095
224066,4,6300198413,"Granny Weatherall has worked all of her life. She is proud of her accomplishments and still remains a demanding woman in her old age. Now things are changing. She's hearing things and seeing people long dead but she stubbornly refuses to slow down, until her body plays its own wicked game with her.
  For the first time in her life this old woman is forced to confront the deep pain that she has carried in her heart. Her great love left her at the altar of matrimony. The incident infused a deep anger and sorrow that she carried around her for the rest of her life. Now ,in her old age, she must give an account of her life as she comes closer to the shadow of death.
  This adaptation of Katherine Anne Porter's story shows us the dynamics in a woman's life when she  abandons her dreams and substitute them for being a work horse. A vibrant young woman's folly turns into the bitterness of an old woman still holding a grudge over the man her left her and those who died on her. What is she left with after all of these years of sacrifice?
  Such a snapshot of a woman's life give us pause to wonder about the meaning of our lives as we determine what is important. Are we to become the work horse grannies or the dutiful daughter called Cordelia who is ever faithful but unappreciated. Porter's story causes us to reflect upon this and this cinematic portrayal will make you think twice about your life. This is an enjoyable presentation with a profound message about living fully.",1016841600,8,1487,4.424908424908425
224067,2,6300198413,"Katherine Anne Porter's short story ""The Jilting of Granny Weatherall,"" being told in stream-of-consciousness, could easily have been a cinematic tour-de-force. Unfortunately, director Randa Haines drains any interest out of it by trying to present it in a literal manner. The story would have been nothing special were it not for the stream of consciousness technique. Instead of trying to express Granny's feelings, Haines simply gives us static reenactments of events in her past, filmed in such conventional ways that we do not get much of Granny's attitude toward how she remembers things.
In this TV movie, it is simply an old dying woman having flashbacks. Had Porter's story been given an imaginative director, it could have easily been made into a remarkable and astonishing film. Instead, we get a lame Cliffs Notes version of the story.
I would recommend this film only to curious Porter fans, but I don't expect they'll like it. Anyone who took interest enough to read this review is referred to the short story, which was very innovative in its day. It could make an innovative film someday, but this definitely is not it.",1010448000,5,1135,5.01058201058201

224114,5,6300198413,"Geraldine Fitzgerald is beautiful in this adaptation from the book. She portrays a woman who lived a happy life and a bitter one that was probably hidden from her family until the shadows creep closer. She was of jilted by a young man in her youth and harbors resentment of what could have been. It is a film that tends to make a person review his or her own youth and choices. Great acting for Ms. Fitzgerald, as always, and her beauty and strength shine through the dim of passing years.",1439078400,,489,4.384615384615385
