8204246,5,B000S3656W,"I truly enjoyed this video and even though I did not really learn anything new, it gave me some new ideas I have always thought of but have not tried. Al Linder was a blast to watch as well.",1355788800,,190,3.8974358974358974
8204247,2,B000S3656W,"The video is enlightening to those who have never fished for stripers but for those like me who wanted to know more it wasn't much help. The video is a little out-dated and could have showed more details on tactics and tackle instead of reeling in fish after fish. I also purchased ""Striper Tactics"" and it found it to be much more useful but the buying both is a good idea for the novice. The In-Fisherman guys are great!",1352332800,,422,4.3544303797468356
