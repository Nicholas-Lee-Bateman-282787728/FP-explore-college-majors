2739407,5,B000MR9CZU,"I love Tamilee's DVD's for the no-nonsense approach.  She is not cheesy, ditzy or too muscled up.  These are excellent!  You can chose to target key areas one day at a time or build a full workout depending on your time and motivation.  Each DVD has a different cardio/aerobic section that is challenging but not complicated.  The toning exercises are effective classics.",1200528000,8,371,4.919354838709677
2739408,5,B000MR9CZU,"THIS IS MY FAVORITE OF ALL I OWN OF HER VIDEOS!  They are no nonsense get to the point exercises that are short timed but intense!  You feel it, and you notice the change in your body.  THIS IS THE SET TO GET!!!!! It's not cheesy and I love that there is a timer on the bottom of the screen.  Just when your ready to say FORGET IT I'M DONE....you look down and theres only 2 mins. left.  It's like...ah I can do that...THESE ROCK!!!!!!!",1200268800,22,436,4.08235294117647
2739409,5,B000MR9CZU,"As a matter of fact, it is my favorite! I highly recommend the bonus workouts that come in each DVD.",1190505600,8,100,4.05
2739410,5,B000MR9CZU,"I've been doing Tamilee's videos for 15 years, and I have to say this one is one is on top of my list!  Quick workout that really works!  Highly recommended !",1190332800,12,158,4.064516129032258
2739431,5,B000MR9CZU,"As a mom of two boys, I don't have much time to myself.  These 10-minute workouts are fantastic, whether you get to do 1,2, or more in a day.  I usually have to do one at a time because then my 2-yr old finds me :) but if you're a fan of Tamilee, her enthusiasm is here, and the exercises are not monotonous, so the time really flies.  It makes it easy to work out every day when you can do bits here and there.  It all adds up!",1235865600,,428,3.7752808988764044
2739432,5,B000MR9CZU,"I like these DVD's because it lets me pick and choose which ones to do on my own time.  I like to combine a few to customize my workouts also.  The other thing I like is Tamilee isn't one of those cutesy barbie-type trainers either, she is a well trained professional and it shows.",1230681600,,281,4.185185185185185
2739433,5,B000MR9CZU,"I own several of Tamilee's videos and have to say that this set is one of my favorites.  I do mix and match with the other sets for variety.  This is so easy to do yet very effective.  This is a no nonsense approach, has no confusing moves, just a great overall workout.  You can do a 10 minute workout, 20 minute workout, or the whole video and still feel great about what you have accomplished.  I love the additional 10 minute workout included as a bonus.  Tamilee has got to be the greatest instructor.  I am never disappointed with any of her videos.",1227571200,,555,4.278846153846154
2739434,5,B000MR9CZU,"I only have one other Tamilee workout, but I liked her in that one and I was looking for a new short toning DVD to replace the one I've gotten bored with.  This is it!  The Buns & Thighs workout is tough.  The only exercise I wasn't crazy about was the abs & core workout on the Body Blast DVD.  The Total Body workout on the Hot Spots DVD was a little challenging because I'm not the most coordinated person so it took me a couple of trys to get it right.  Overall I am very pleased with this purchase.",1219622400,,503,3.99
2739435,5,B000MR9CZU,"I just love Tamilee Webb's exercise videos. They are tough and she is not one of those annoying instructors like many. The ""Tight on Time 2PK"" is great when you are short on time, or just to mix them up with other workouts.  I also would suggest her ""I Want That Body"" DVD.",1219363200,,273,4.150943396226415
2739436,4,B000MR9CZU,"I have several of Tamilee's videos and have always found her to be very good. She cues the moves very well, keeps the movement going, and is inspiring without being obnoxious. I liked this video as well as I wanted a workout that I could do in a minimum amount of time but get in all the major body areas. I am glad I bought this item.",1216771200,3,335,4.014925373134329
2739437,5,B000MR9CZU,"Tamilee Webb is great to follow on these DVD's.  She doesn't talk too much, but she explains the workouts.  The workouts are designed to be short segments that you can do together or pick and choose what you have time for.  I would have liked a longer aerobic workout instead of 10 minutes, but the workout here was true to the DVD's name ""Tight on Time.""  I just do the step part twice.",1216771200,3,387,4.260273972602739
2739438,5,B000MR9CZU,"Once again, Tamilee Webb has made some great workout videos. You will need a step, mat, 1 or 3 lb weights, and bands. I think this video is great for all levels of fitness from beginners (who will need to take it slow, use less resistance, and maybe cut back on the reps at first) to advanced exercisers. I have been exercising regularly for 12 years so I used 5 lb. weights for all segments that required weights. I will increase as I become familiar with the exercises. The clock that is shown helps keep me motivated through each segment on days when I am not in the mood to exercise. I am always glad I did at the end of the workout.

I would highly recommend this set to others. It is also a great way to work exercise into your day if you are just starting to exercise or are very busy and only can allot a few minutes a day to exercising.",1215648000,2,845,4.121212121212121
2739439,5,B000MR9CZU,"Each DVD in this 2 pack contains three 10 minute segments plus a 10 minute bonus workout.  There's also a warm up and stretch but it's the same on each DVD.  In Body Blast the segments are: BUNS & THIGHS, Cardio STEP and ABS.  The bonus workout is with a stability ball.  Buns & thighs is all floorwork with classics like donkey kicks and side lifts.  The Abs workout is balance exercises.  It's effective; but I didn't like it that much.  The stability ball workout was great.  It was mostly lower body and abs focused.  In Hot Spots the sections are: ARMS & SHOULDERS, TOTAL BODY & SUPER ABS.  The bonus workout is total body with rubber tubing.  I used a resistance band but you could also use light dumbells.  In arms, upper body and abs you use light dumbells.  Arms & Shoulders had classic exercises but Tamilee keeps it interesting with good combinations.  In Total Body you work upper and lower body at the same time with lunges, squats and warrior pose while you work bicep, triceps and shoulders. The Abs section is great.  The dumbells really increase the intensity.  You hold them in your hands while you lower your body and also put them behind your legs during reverse curls.  Overall I was very pleased with this purchase.  Tamilee is friendly and down to earth and cues well.",1215302400,19,1291,4.539130434782609
2739440,5,B000MR9CZU,"I get home late every night and leave early every morning during the week, but I want a good workout.  I used to be able to do 45 minute to 1 hour workouts a day at my old job, but now I only have a few minutes and don't want to put weight on.  I purchased this CD pack because it had 10-15 minute workouts and it focused on problem areas.  I love it!  I throw one in the DVD player, do a warmup, a workout, and the stretch.  Takes me at the most 20-25 minutes.  You can really feel it too.  And, Tamilee is not annoying to listen to.  Highly recommend!",1210118400,3,553,3.875
8171068,5,B000MR9CZU,"Both videos are excellent, and Tamilee is a fabulous instructor!",1467244800,,64,5.5
8171069,5,B000MR9CZU,We purchased this for our daughter who uses it every day and absolutely loves it.  It is just what she wanted.  The seller handled this order in a very timely manner and the product arrived just as promised.  I would recommend this to anyone wanting to tone up.,1360972800,,261,4.395833333333333
8171070,5,B000MR9CZU,"This gives 3 work outs...  Easy to follow and Tamilee is awesome, easy to follow.  It's a thorough work out for after cardio to help firm up!
IT's a GREAT workout for just what it says....tight on time!",1289088000,,202,4.2894736842105265
8171071,5,B000MR9CZU,This is a great workout video that allows you to do 1 or 2 workouts or all of them in one session.  It can be used with other workout tapes that do not have a warm up or cool down.  I really like Tamilee as an instructor too.,1283040000,,225,3.6666666666666665
8171072,5,B000MR9CZU,"10 minutes work outs is the best thing. Everybody can find 10 min (+ 3 min to warm up and 5 min to cool down) for a work out. And the programs are different, so you can choose one for every day of the week or do a combination if you have more than 10 min to spare.
Tamilee Webb is very energetic and motivating, plus you have the clock on your screen to monitor the time left, that helps to keep up, knowing it's almost over )).",1272412800,,428,3.875
8171073,2,B000MR9CZU,"I do a lot of exercise and this video was not a challenge for me.
She wants to work abs, buns and arms all in 10 minutes, with poor results...
I prefer her other videos.",1269043200,2,169,3.857142857142857
8171074,3,B000MR9CZU,"This set contains two dvds each with 3 main 10 minute workouts and one bonus 10 minute workout.  There is also a three minute warm-up and a cool down stretch on each video.  The warm-up and the cool down segments are the same on each dvd.  The warm-up is relatively short (around 3 minutes) which, while I know this is a ""tight on time"" workout, I do not feel even close to warmed up after 3 minutes.

Regarding equipment used: Most of the segments use light hand weights.  There is one step routine, one stability ball workout, and one tubing workout.

The level of intensity of this workout is aimed more for the beginner exerciser.  Increasing the amount of weight might raise the intensity of the exercises presented but most intermediate and advanced exercisers may not get pushed hard enough to really feel the burn.  That said, Tamilee does not always give enough instruction on how to perform the exercies properly so beginners may struggle on how to perform a few of the exercises.  It might have helped to have different camera angles to see how some of the arm exercises are executed.  There are a few spots where I was not really sure how she was performing the exercise.

That aside, I do enjoy these videos on days when I need a lower intensity workout. I used them quite a bit when I was first starting to exercise regularly and I would suggest that if you fit that description, these might be a set worth considering.  Tamilee is upbeat and encouraging without being annoying.  The exercise segments are fun to do and the time does fly when I do these exercises.  If there was better instruction on performing the exercises, I would have given this a higher rating.",1263081600,5,1681,4.578595317725752
8171075,3,B000MR9CZU,"I received this product timely. However, one of the disks is cracked and won't play. I checked with the post office and they said that it was not damaged in shipping. But I'm already using the other one.",1262995200,,203,4.368421052631579
8171076,4,B000MR9CZU,"I usually love Tamilee - she's motivating, never annoying, and really seems to know what she's talking about.  I was a huge fan of the I Want That Body set because of how challenging and effective each workout was.  However, I have really mixed feelings about the Tight on Time set.  Some sections are great, but others don't provide enough challenge or variety.  Furthermore, the music on some sections is quite irritating.  However, I do think the 10 minute timer on the bottom right of the screen is a good idea for motivation.  For this workout you need some handweights (she recommends 3 pounds), a step, and maybe a mat.

On the Body Blast DVD:  I really liked the buns and thigh workout (other than the music), which is sort of a leg lift/donkey kick set.  I could really feel my butt during this segment.  The abs and stability ball section were alright - the moves were good, but I needed a few more reps to really feel the burn.  As for the cardio step section - it's a good idea in theory to add a cardio section for the time crunched, but it doesn't really get hard enough until the last 2-3 minutes.

On the Hot Spots DVD:  Really enjoyed the arms and shoulders workout.  It's classic moves, but done in combinations that keep you interested.  I do this segment with 5lb weights and it's quite challenging for me.  I also enjoy the total body section which is a lot of squats or lunges combined with upper body work.  There's one move where she works the hamstrings in a way I've never had the pleasure of doing before.  However, I wasn't really feeling Super Abs since it gets a little tedious (and holding weights can feel impossible if you've done the arms & shoulders section before it).

There are definitely sections of Tight on Time that are wonderful, but unfortunately about half of the DVD I don't use at all.  I think this workout may be better for a beginner to intermediate level exerciser.",1247097600,4,1916,4.498550724637681
8171077,5,B000MR9CZU,You can have it play all the sections or just pick and choose the sections you want to work on for the day. Nice to have the flexibility to work out for a half hour or a full hour.  Tamilee Webb does a good job with the instructions - just wish it showed a little more of the stretches at the end of each section instead of fading out to begin the next section.  Nice getting a 2 pk - great deal for the money.,1245801600,,410,3.8117647058823527
