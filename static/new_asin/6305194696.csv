7884807,4,6305194696,"I remember this show.  I remember watching these episodes.  The two on this VHS must have been the first ones I'd seen of the series.  I can't believe there are still tapes of it available for purchase.

I was six when it first went on the air and while for some reason I pretended to hate it in the beginning (for the record, I was a strange kid back in the day), overtime I gave into it and looked forward to watching each and every episode every weekend.  I also recall visiting its website a lot as well, for it had to be one of the coolest ones I'd ever seen.  Not to mention that it's through this series that I recognize Pat Morita.  From there on out, when I first saw the voice actor for the Emperor for ""Mulan"" and when I first watched ""The Karate Kid"" and saw Mr. Miyagi, the first thing that came to mind was, ""Oh!  He's the bookstore owner from 'Kanga Roddy'!""

As a member of its original demographic audience, I definitely recommend this show for kids even in today's time.  It's not cliche like other kids shows (which shall remain nameless for the benefit of the doubt) with overly catchy songs and overly obvious plot lines.  This show taught lessons for life- such as having confidence and being brave- as the episodes on this VHS demonstrate- through contemporary music and non-violent martial arts.

I read an article online once that out of the kids who watched it, it was mostly boys who were into the sports and martial arts aspect of it while the girls were mostly into the music.  Without a doubt, I was more with the boys on this one, for I thought it was fascinating that martial arts was incorporated into the show.  I'm a practitioner of karate and taekwondo and with that in mind, along with seeing through the eyes of an adult now, I can see how the lessons that are taught and the martial arts go hand-in-hand; because from my experience, martial arts is a part of life.

If anything, that aspect can contribute for a demand for this series to be viewed by today's kids now more than ever before.  When the show first broadcast, it was in attempt to show the philosophical elements of martial arts minus the violence shows like ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" and ""Power Rangers"" exploited at the time.  In today's era, violence is present now more than ever in society; such as the shootings that have been going on within the last couple years and more and more shows exploiting violence.  Why, even earlier today, I read an article about how a little girl was suspended from school for threatening a student with a toy gun.  I think that if kids watched this show, they would learn better otherwise about both the engrained meaning behind martial arts and the life lessons that are taught.  After all, I remember President Obama reading a quote from a little boy who was hiding with several others in a bathroom during the Newtown shooting last month who said, ""Don't worry.  I know karate.  I'll lead the way out.""

Despite having slightly paved away from this being a review on a kids show, bottom line is that I highly recommend this series for kids and families to watch.  While the acting and special effects aren't the best quality, it's the story and the elements behind it that makes this show stick out in my mind even now as I keep going forward as an adult.",1358640000,,3303,4.475792988313857
7884808,1,6305194696,"This has got to be the dumbest show ever. The kids are so stupid, they dance like ... and aren't much better at singing.
The premise of the show is utterly moronic. The kids go to a computer type in a special word and then they fly on a computer chip to the land of Hi-Yah. In the land of Hi-Yah Kanga Roddy lectures them on how when he prepares for a Kung Fu match, he uses virtue.
There is also this one kid who is the bully of the cast. Everytime they want to make an example of someone, they use him. Thats a wonderful lesson for your kids, make examples of the stupid.
How did Ronnie Lott and Joe Montana get dragged in to this piece of .... I would divorce my wife if she proposed a show like this.
By the way, Amy (other reviewer), are you crazy, I can almost understand your kids enjoying this, but you too. Thats a real shame. How can you like this muck ?

And in the episode ""Facing Your Fears"", she sings really awsome!  And she overcomes her fear in a way that doesn't  seem forced or preachy.",943660800,,312,4.7407407407407405
