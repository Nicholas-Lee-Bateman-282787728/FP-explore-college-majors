3830469,5,B0020LXALI,They've corrected the only problem with the first season--they've doubled the number of episodes! This is a great series : ),1294099200,3,124,4.9523809523809526
3830470,2,B0020LXALI,The fun of creating these cakes really reels in my teens and I can see that - but the shows are chopped up into lots of soundbites that are repetitve -- and they repeat themselves a lot too -  and they include a lot of pointless filler -- they just sort-of don't have anything to say a lot. (That's a sample.)  They are best for people with a  desire to feel like they are buddies with the people they are watching and don't mind that 10 minutes of content has been stretched to fill 30 minutes of your time.  The people are nice tho and the cakes are fun.,1269648000,4,556,4.073394495412844
