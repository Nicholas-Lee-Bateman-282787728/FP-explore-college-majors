2886502,1,B000SK5Z7A,The worst war movie ever filmed and I'm sure one Tom Selleck (one of my very favorite actors) wishes he'd never done.  I only gave it one star because I could not rate it with none.  A true STINKER!!!,1239321600,4,200,4.102564102564102
2886503,1,B000SK5Z7A,"We are fans of Tom Selleck.  He is not a great actor but a wonderful personality.  In this movie his performance, when compared to the rest of the cast, is of Oscar quality.  The direction and camera work are as bad as they get.  The script was found in someones trash.",1217548800,5,269,4.215686274509804
2886504,1,B000SK5Z7A,Received the DVD and when we tried to watch it there was a loud noise and picture 'skipping'.  I returned it and then received a second DVD - it too was defective.  I returned the second one and asked for a refund.  I still would like the DVD but it's too much trouble returning the item.  I have ordered many DVD's from Amazon without any trouble.,1215648000,6,348,4.2272727272727275
2886505,3,B000SK5Z7A,"First of all the music is really bad.
The one fellow in 1940 France calls the Tom Selleck character ""Gung Ho""
which comes from a 1942 Marine movie ?
Some of the props in the biology lab are just there by
""time travel' with plastics and electronics not seem until the 1980's.
I have no idea if France ever had a secret biological
lab, but if it did, it would have been very near
Paris?
In short the acting  may be better than the script writing,
producing and directing here?
Missions like this weren't organized until later in the war
and were mostly carried out by British commandos under the OSS?
The art work in contrast to the music is very well done.",1214870400,37,655,4.32520325203252
2886506,2,B000SK5Z7A,"They put this low budget, poor excuse for a made for TV movie on DVD?  Where is Lassiter?  Where is High Road to China?  Who makes these choices? I like Selleck movies, but stock clips poorly mixed with back lot (room, lot would be too lofty) scenes complete with learning the trade acting. Did I really give it 2 stars.  I guess I really do like TS movies.",1207440000,43,357,4.205882352941177

2886523,3,B000SK5Z7A,"I like Selleck as an actor on Rockford Files and Concrete Cowboys and other TV shows and movies. Not a fan of his Magnum PI show.
I remember watching as a kid when this originally aired and it was okay then after adding this to my collection I thought it was horrible
like most reviewers. But I've watched a few times since and it's an enjoyable classic tv movie but not great. The writing and plot and
directing is not good and seems like it wasn't edited very well either which coming from Stephen J. Cannel is surprise. Maybe it was
rushed into production and making. But again it's 100x's better than any of the CRAP from Hollyweird and network TV today! I say it's
a good movie to sit back and enjoy and have fun. Selleck gives a good performance nothing great and his friend James Whitmore Jr.
who seemed to be in many NBC and Cannel productions back then is okay as his sidekick. Not as good as Jerry Reed in Concrete
Cowboys which would have made a great TV series. So if you like old TV movies and Selleck it's a good movie.",1431216000,,1033,4.275510204081633

2886542,2,B000SK5Z7A,"A good overall plot idea, using gypsies to smuggle OSS agents behind Nazi lines to investigate a secret biological warfare lab. However, this low budget - early Tom Selleck flick comes off comically trite and the acting craft is really immature. Hardly worth the money to buy this little known movie.",1385596800,5,300,4.901960784313726

2886546,2,B000SK5Z7A,"This is probably one movie Tom Selleck should not have made.  For those who like him this is not one to get excited about, a one-time viewing for sure.  Disappointed but only got it because of Sellck's name being on it.",1363996800,,219,4.317073170731708
2886547,1,B000SK5Z7A,"I am a big fan of Tom Selleck and WWII movies but it was a chore to make it through this one.  The made-for-TV movie storyline is like something from an old B-movie serial.

The Germans, while occupying France, have a secret chemical lab in which the Allies want to take the chemicals and destroy the lab.  They plan to do this with the help of local gypsies; whose characters are heavily stereotyped.

So what's the plan: get Nazi uniforms, fake German accents, and just go right on into the secret base without anyone realizing.  I honestly think Colonel Hogan and the men from Stalag 13 did it better and with much more flair.
If it wasn't for Tom Selleck, I would have turned it off; but my commitment to Mr. Selleck forced me to finish it, all the while praying for the credits to show up.

Ok, at the price it's being sold and if you are true Selleck fans go ahead and buy the DVD.  However, It is as close to a ""one time watch"" movie as it can get... even starring Tom Selleck.

PS: If you insist on getting the movie, try getting the ""Murder 101/Gypsy Warriors - Double Feature!""  You still get the Tom Selleck movie, but you also get ""Murder 101"" with Pierce Brosnan, which isn't too bad.

2886549,3,B000SK5Z7A,"As one other reviewer stated, it's Tom Selleck.  The quality of the movie is not that great and there is a lot of night stuff, so it's hard to see what's going on.  The story is ok because it is eliminating some Nazis.  It's one of those movies you see once and that will probably do you for a lifetime.",1325203200,,303,4.016666666666667

2886555,1,B000SK5Z7A,"I like Tom Selleck, but this movie is very poor.  If you look closely at one of the night scenes, you can see the World Trade Center - the two towers - in the back ground.  Duh!  The towers were not around during WWII.",1265241600,13,218,3.909090909090909
2886556,3,B000SK5Z7A,"I am a fan of Tom Selleck and have purchased most of the available DVDs he has been featured or associated with. When I saw the photo on The Gypsy Warriors I was intersted and read what little data that was offered... little information and no story line or teaser that told the fact that this was more or less a tv show expanded to a less than satisfying waste of time and money.  I would classify it as a C story and a C+ for acting.  It is one of those cases where: ""if you have never heard of the movie there is a good reason"". My one consolation is that the service to get it was good, and the price was less than going to the theater. Would I recommend it to a friend? No, but I will keep it on my shelf as reminder to look closer before I leap.",1242518400,64,751,3.9019607843137254
