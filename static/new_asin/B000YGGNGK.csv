All 22 Episodes Available in a Three-Disc Boxed Set

Culver City, CA (November 12, 2007) - Expand your television DVD collection of great classic comedies when Sony Pictures Home Entertainment debuts Barney Miller: The Complete Second Season on DVD January 22. The ABC series, which was nominated for six Emmys including Outstanding Comedy Series, stars Hal Linden (TV's Search for Tomorrow, The Other Woman) daytime Emmy nominee Abe Vigoda (The Godfather), and Jack Soo (Thoroughly Modern Millie, The Green Berets).

The three-disc DVD set includes all 22 episodes from the second season, with guest stars Linda Lavin (TV's Alice), David Doyle (TV's General Hospital), and Adam Arkin (Hitch).

Barney Miller is the kind of cop we'd all like to meet. He somehow manages to maintain order at New York City's 12th Precinct in Greenwich Village and remains level-headed while dealing with a group of off-the-wall inner-city detectives. Among them is a gambler, another who attends renaissance philosophy conventions for fun, and a third who spends most of his time daydreaming about being an author. This season, the precinct deals with potential layoffs, a man who threatens to blow up the station unless he can speak with President Nixon, marijuana evidence that suspiciously disappears, and a job offer from Florida for Barney.

Rumor has it that the show's seri-comic take on police work, and the characters who pass through the squad-room, was partial inspiration for the breakthrough cop drama  ""Hill Street Blues.""",1470700800,,348,4.507936507936508

3028829,5,B000YGGNGK,"One of the best smartest wittiest intelligent and funny shows on TV which is rare even back then especially now and they made jokes about
everybody and everything without all the political correctness crap! My favorite is the shows with the gay characters of Marty and Daryl who
should have had their own show! and the episode about FISH taking restricted duty and Deitrich appears for the first time and goes to Fish's
apartment to convince him to come back to work and does the funniest Gregory Peck impersonation ever! classic! The first 2 seasons are
the best in my opinion but season 3 is also great. I haven't seen the other seasons since reruns and will be completing my collection soon.
I was lucky to find the first 3 seasons on sale and I'm so glad I bought these because they are as funny as ever and better than anything
on network or cable TV today! Let's hope they don't try and 'remake' this show like Hollyweird seems to be doing now!",1445731200,,950,4.497109826589595

3028860,4,B000YGGNGK,Product arrived early and in excellent condition.  I was happy to find this product as I remember this show well from when I was younger. They are just as good now as they were then!,1394928000,,182,4.2
3028861,4,B000YGGNGK,"Despite age, this show still has legs!
I have watched TV out of the womb in '68. I was deep into Trek growing up and all other shows of the 70's. Now I understand that acting back then was breaking free of the tight binds of the 50's & 60's, some of the performances can seem a bit off tilt by today's standards. That being said the storylines based in NYC  during the throws of the 1970's still hold up as funny. Older NYPD cops that I know will tell you Barney Miller was closer to the real thing than you might expect for the day to day encounters. They rarely touched on the true horror of the job what with the time which the show aired. They did confront officer shootings and other themes with a seriousness unexpected of a sitcom but overall, Barney Miller still remains an immensely entertaining time capsule that hold its own just fine.",1391731200,,846,4.320754716981132
3028862,5,B000YGGNGK,Barney Miller still is up there with the best comedy shows of the 1970s.  A must see for all Barney's and the gangs fans,1387670400,,120,4.0

I gave this as a gift, it came shrink wrapped and all, so you can imagine my horror when my guest opened it at home and found the set incomplete! I tried to contact the company but the number was no longer in service.",1386720000,,268,4.173076923076923
3028865,4,B000YGGNGK,The characters are well developed and respond in ways which correlate to their stereotypes within society. Highly recommend if doing research on stereotypes of the 1970's.,1385769600,,171,5.615384615384615
3028866,5,B000YGGNGK,"Once again, the blast from the past puts to shame anything on TV these days. There was a genuine sense of comedy with this show, no canned laugh track, and the writing was excellent!",1381536000,,182,4.382352941176471

3028872,5,B000YGGNGK,"This is a great season of Barney Miller. Season 1 pretty much introduced all the characters and let us become acquainted with Barney's home life. Season 2 really concentrates on the humor of the show and the interactions of the detectives and the people who frequent the squad room.

I couldn't wait to get Seasons 2, and 3 in the mail. For me it had been a long time since I had watched any of the Barney Miller episodes. I was quite pleased with the product. My only beef was the video quality, of course the show was filmed in the late 70's, and early 80's. When I played the DVD on my 42 LCD flat screen I quite shocked how poor the video was on the DVD. There were times when there was a long shot of the squad room, and it was blurry, then when they switched back to a close up showing two of the detectives the picture immediately cleared up.  Also on almost every video on the far left there are vertical lines side of the TV screen, although this is only visible on a panel HDTV. If I played the same DVD on one of my older CRT tv's, you couldn't see the lines. That is my only beef. I have all the Columbo DVD's, and those movies were filmed in the 1970's, and the picture quality on my flat screen with them is excellent.
 If you are a die hard Barney Miller fan  I strongly recommend that you buy these DVD's. You will enjoy every episode, and every minute

3028892,5,B000YGGNGK,"After a somewhat shakey start in its short first season, ""Barney Miller"", here in the second season, develops the format that made it so popular that it could last eight seasons. Although Barney's wife, Liz, is shown in the show's opening we actually see her very little, which I think was the right move. Whereas in the first season we see numerous scenes that take place outside the squad room, by the second season, almost all activity is restricted to that one set.  However, the most important change was making Wojo (played by Max Gail) the frequent main focus of the stories.  I think this came as a disappointment to Gregory Sierra who played Sgt Chano Amangual, the Puerto Rican detective who left the show after this season. Sierra was the most well-known actor when the series began, and yet as the second season progresses, we see less and less of him and there are few episodes in which he is the focus of attention. In the first season there was an episode that showed him undergoing a crisis because he was forced to shoot and kill and suspect and we see him in anguish over this, an episode in which he was able to show his acting abilities to the fullest.  However, the creators of the show felt that this type of story was not appropriate for a comedy so by the second season we no longer see stories of this type.  I presume that it was frustration over this that led Sierra to leave the series, which I think was unfortunate.  Linda Lavin appears in several episodes as Det. Wentworth, but this also didn't last very long.  Steve Landesberg is introduced as Fish's nemesis, Det Arthur Dietrich. Although we don't see much of him in this second season, he later became one of the stars of the show and we see flashes of his dry humor that added so much to the show.  I also feel that Abe Vigoda's role as Det Philip K Fish was too restricted because almost everything he says is a complaint about his age, his health, his wife Bernice and his need to go to the restroom. Having mentioned these minor complaints of mine, I still want to say that the show is one of the finest comedy series ever made. Many comedies of the 1970's that I once found hilarious, such as ""The Odd Couple"", ""Bob Newhart"" and ""All in the Family"" now seem dated to me but ""Barney Miller"" is the exception and it is still fresh as it was then.
My favorite episode is ""Fear of Flying"" in which Wojo's reluctance to fly in an airplane while extraditing a prisoner to Cleveland (of all places!) is the centerpiece. His charge is a bigamist played by the always deadpan Jack Riley and whose wife in New York, played by the underappreciated actress Valerie Curtin shows up at the 12th Precinct and overdoses on sleeping pills. Wojo calls the hospital and they tell him that she must ""emtpy her stomach....you know...upchuck!"" as Wojo tells Barney in his inimitable Polish way.  Upon hearing this everyone turns to Yemana and says ""give her coffee!"".  See it for yourself to see how it turns out!",1242000000,3,2982,4.507407407407407

But to be able to laugh over and over is definitely worth every penny. It is time for Sony to get on the ball and release the rest of the show.

It rarely steps out of the squad room, but the programme seems richer for it because we can really get to grips with the depth of the characters within the series. There's seriously funny one liners alongside some really subtle stuff, as well as some very pertinent moments that tug on your heart strings like a bulldozer. On top of that, you get the wierd and wonderful characters that occupy the cage from time to time.

3028907,5,B000YGGNGK,"Barney Miller is one of those shows that holds up over time, even if its' ideals and naviete are of a bygone era.  Barney, played by Hal Linden, is the fatherly figure that leads this wonderful ensemble of actors through daily life at the 12th precinct in New York City.  Whether it's dealing with the myriad of characters his detectives come into contact with or helping his men deal with their own problems, he is a thoughtful listener as he guides them to their own solutions.  Two of the detectives, played by Abe Vigoda and Jack Soo had a deadpan delivery of their lines that would have been the envy of Jack Benny or Steven Wright.  Ron Glass-the hip dectective is also a part time writer and full time clotheshorse and trend-setter;  Maxwell Gail, Wojohowitz, finds his ideals don't always jive with those he comes into contact with.  His temper tends to get to get the better of him when this happens, and when it does, fatherly Capt. Miller steps in to calm things down.  Gregory Sierra, as Det. Almanguada, is the Latino that seesaws between what the writers saw as the Latino temper stereotype and a more subdued and reflective individual.  Sierra, rises above the writing to deliver wonderful performances.  While the writing relects some stereotypic ideas and traits, Barney Miller is and was a sensitive and idealized portrayal of not only the realationship between law enforcement and public but also between individuals themselves.  The humor is smart and crisp. Best of all, Barney Miller is never maudeline, much to the credit of the writers, director and cast.  It is one of the best series ever produced.",1211068800,4,1624,4.805755395683454
3028908,5,B000YGGNGK,"BARNEY MILLER: THE COMPLETE SECOND SEASON is a great addition to anyone's DVD collection.
The show ran from 1975 to 1982, but, other than clothing and references to current events of the day, I found myself forgetting that this second season was originally broadcast more than thirty years ago.  The jokes are fast and furious and Hal Linden (Barney Miller) and the rest of the cast are wonderful.  The episodes run the gambit of scenarios.  Everything from retirement to on-the-job romance to gay bashing are dealt with intelligently and humorously.  I'm almost certain you'll find yourself watching these episodes again and again.  These are hard times and it's important to make time for laughter.  Life is too short.",1209168000,27,720,5.059322033898305

Fans of the Barney Miller Show will be happy to see that the wait is finally over and perhaps we can even hope that subsequent years will be released at a much more rapid pace than what we've seen so far.

While the first season was short and still finding its way, we start to see the show develop into its true routine here. Barney's wife is in just two episodes (a welcome relief) and life in the squad room clearly takes center stage. The one exception to that rule is a single episode that revolves around Fish (Abe Vigoda) that feels very much like a pilot for a spinoff series that never happened. That same episode also introduces the character of Det. Dietrich (Steve Landesberg) who becomes a regular in Season Three.

Watching these episodes again after such a long time has been a real treat. The cast is stellar and the writing much more intelligent than the typical sitcom. Abe Vigoda is especially deserving of praise as his deadpan delivery makes almost anything seem funny. If you're a fan of the show, you will definitely want Season Two. If you haven't seen it and are curious this is actually a great place to start since the first season is very uneven in quality.",1207526400,4,1499,5.0894308943089435
3028911,5,B000YGGNGK,"More of this classy series has finally became available on DVD. The first season (a paltry 13 episodes) came out several years ago, and it has taken a long time to add to that collection.  With all of the garbage that is being released on DVD, we need more of this level of quality.

Barney Miller is an ensemble piece about a group of policemen trying to control the chaos without losing their humanity.  Today's ""cop shows"" are so obsessed with realism that they forget the value of a little perspective, especially a humorous one.  Like MASH, Barney Miller can take you from a guffaw to tears in a heartbeat, and the streets of New York City in the 70s provide an even more varied backdrop than does the Korean (or its analogue, the Vietnam) war.

The episodes in this collection are classic, from ""The Layoff"" which was written in response to the city's plea to the Federal Government for emergency funding, to which the Feds responded with a resounding ""Drop Dead"" to the colorful characters that are always multidimensional and unique.  The quality of this show is unsurpassed.  I sincerely hope that the rest of these shows are released at reasonable intervals.  They deserve far more respect and will deliver far more enjoyment than most of the rest of the drivel that is out there.",1207180800,8,1290,4.676991150442478

The first season, which was just a half season, set the stage for the second season, and the series only got better.  A terrific ensemble cast, great stories and very well directed.  Linda Lavin's best role was here as Det. Janice Wentworth, definitely NOT Alice.  Abe Vigoda as Fish reels off great one-liners.  Much was made at the time (I was 15) about the diversity of the group and it genuinely made a difference.  Plus you get a better insight to the 70's than just about any show with respect to the issues of the day.  I can't wait for the rest of the series to come out!!!",1206489600,13,714,4.363636363636363

3028914,5,B000YGGNGK,"The producers found their niche in the second season of Barney Miller. The laughs are cranked up as is the realism. Will they survive the layoffs? Will they ever get heat again? Will the federal government bailout New York City? And, yet, they find ways to make us laugh at what many consider to be the most real cop show on television.

Linda Lavin makes four appearances as Det. Wentworth (Before she became ""Alice""); She & Wojo are developing a relationship. Dietrich makes his first appearance (appearing a few episodes before as a priest who never was). Fish is on the verge of retirement, we even get an episode of him at home. Harris begins his writing career for the local police newspaper.

The comedy is turned on high, we can't help but laugh at what goes on at Precinct 12. Even Barney himself carries on as a trooper maneuvering through a couple of episodes with a broken foot. This set has 22 episodes on 3 discs but there aren't any bonus features. I'm not going to count the two excerpts from other ABC series going on DVD.

3028916,5,B000YGGNGK,"Barney Miller was(along with Hill Street Blues and the first three seasons of MASH) the last prime-time, commercial television show that I actually scheduled into my weekly ""To-Do"" list, so I greeted with absolute elation the news that somebody had finally made the second season available. I check here almost daily to see if additional seasons have been released (and would appreciate if anybody in the know would let me know if the release of additional seasons are on the way.)
It isn't hard to figure out why Barney M. was, and still is, the high watermark in television comedy: Good writing. The story, the humor was everything. No exotic sets (basically the entire eight seasons are shot in the squad room) no special effects, no sex, no violence. All the money seems to have been spent on writing good scripts. The cast look, talk and act like real, believable people in the real world. (There are actually old people in the cast, women who don't bulge from low-cut blouses and parents that don't look like high school students.) Even more amazing, most of the characters dealt with here are actually non-people like taxi drivers, plumbers, waitresses and street urchins who take a bus to work. Everybody in entertainment today knows that real people are doctors, lawyers, advertising executives, bankers and handsome corporate heads who drive expensive sports cars. Character development is fantastic, and even semi-regulars  like Lugar and Skanlon are unique, superbly developed characters..and hilarious.
This show is, above all, a rare adult comedy. I understand it hasn't been released before (aside from the first season) because there didn't seem to be a market for it.",1204243200,17,1684,5.07942238267148

Barney Miller is the kind of cop we'd all like to meet. He somehow manages to maintain order at New York City's 12th Precinct in Greenwich Village and remains level-headed while dealing with a group of off-the-wall inner-city detectives. Among them is a gambler, another who attends renaissance philosophy conventions for fun, and a third who spends most of his time daydreaming about being an author. This season, the precinct deals with potential layoffs, a man who threatens to blow up the station unless he can speak with President Nixon, marijuana evidence that suspiciously disappears, and a job offer from Florida for Barney.

Rumor has it that the show's seri-comic take on police work, and the characters who pass through the squad-room, was partial inspiration for the breakthrough cop drama  ""Hill Street Blues.""",1470700800,,348,4.507936507936508

3263326,5,B000YGGNGK,"One of the best smartest wittiest intelligent and funny shows on TV which is rare even back then especially now and they made jokes about
everybody and everything without all the political correctness crap! My favorite is the shows with the gay characters of Marty and Daryl who
should have had their own show! and the episode about FISH taking restricted duty and Deitrich appears for the first time and goes to Fish's
apartment to convince him to come back to work and does the funniest Gregory Peck impersonation ever! classic! The first 2 seasons are
the best in my opinion but season 3 is also great. I haven't seen the other seasons since reruns and will be completing my collection soon.
I was lucky to find the first 3 seasons on sale and I'm so glad I bought these because they are as funny as ever and better than anything
on network or cable TV today! Let's hope they don't try and 'remake' this show like Hollyweird seems to be doing now!",1445731200,,950,4.497109826589595

3263358,4,B000YGGNGK,"Despite age, this show still has legs!
I have watched TV out of the womb in '68. I was deep into Trek growing up and all other shows of the 70's. Now I understand that acting back then was breaking free of the tight binds of the 50's & 60's, some of the performances can seem a bit off tilt by today's standards. That being said the storylines based in NYC  during the throws of the 1970's still hold up as funny. Older NYPD cops that I know will tell you Barney Miller was closer to the real thing than you might expect for the day to day encounters. They rarely touched on the true horror of the job what with the time which the show aired. They did confront officer shootings and other themes with a seriousness unexpected of a sitcom but overall, Barney Miller still remains an immensely entertaining time capsule that hold its own just fine.",1391731200,,846,4.320754716981132

I couldn't wait to get Seasons 2, and 3 in the mail. For me it had been a long time since I had watched any of the Barney Miller episodes. I was quite pleased with the product. My only beef was the video quality, of course the show was filmed in the late 70's, and early 80's. When I played the DVD on my 42 LCD flat screen I quite shocked how poor the video was on the DVD. There were times when there was a long shot of the squad room, and it was blurry, then when they switched back to a close up showing two of the detectives the picture immediately cleared up.  Also on almost every video on the far left there are vertical lines side of the TV screen, although this is only visible on a panel HDTV. If I played the same DVD on one of my older CRT tv's, you couldn't see the lines. That is my only beef. I have all the Columbo DVD's, and those movies were filmed in the 1970's, and the picture quality on my flat screen with them is excellent.
 If you are a die hard Barney Miller fan  I strongly recommend that you buy these DVD's. You will enjoy every episode, and every minute

3263389,5,B000YGGNGK,"After a somewhat shakey start in its short first season, ""Barney Miller"", here in the second season, develops the format that made it so popular that it could last eight seasons. Although Barney's wife, Liz, is shown in the show's opening we actually see her very little, which I think was the right move. Whereas in the first season we see numerous scenes that take place outside the squad room, by the second season, almost all activity is restricted to that one set.  However, the most important change was making Wojo (played by Max Gail) the frequent main focus of the stories.  I think this came as a disappointment to Gregory Sierra who played Sgt Chano Amangual, the Puerto Rican detective who left the show after this season. Sierra was the most well-known actor when the series began, and yet as the second season progresses, we see less and less of him and there are few episodes in which he is the focus of attention. In the first season there was an episode that showed him undergoing a crisis because he was forced to shoot and kill and suspect and we see him in anguish over this, an episode in which he was able to show his acting abilities to the fullest.  However, the creators of the show felt that this type of story was not appropriate for a comedy so by the second season we no longer see stories of this type.  I presume that it was frustration over this that led Sierra to leave the series, which I think was unfortunate.  Linda Lavin appears in several episodes as Det. Wentworth, but this also didn't last very long.  Steve Landesberg is introduced as Fish's nemesis, Det Arthur Dietrich. Although we don't see much of him in this second season, he later became one of the stars of the show and we see flashes of his dry humor that added so much to the show.  I also feel that Abe Vigoda's role as Det Philip K Fish was too restricted because almost everything he says is a complaint about his age, his health, his wife Bernice and his need to go to the restroom. Having mentioned these minor complaints of mine, I still want to say that the show is one of the finest comedy series ever made. Many comedies of the 1970's that I once found hilarious, such as ""The Odd Couple"", ""Bob Newhart"" and ""All in the Family"" now seem dated to me but ""Barney Miller"" is the exception and it is still fresh as it was then.
My favorite episode is ""Fear of Flying"" in which Wojo's reluctance to fly in an airplane while extraditing a prisoner to Cleveland (of all places!) is the centerpiece. His charge is a bigamist played by the always deadpan Jack Riley and whose wife in New York, played by the underappreciated actress Valerie Curtin shows up at the 12th Precinct and overdoses on sleeping pills. Wojo calls the hospital and they tell him that she must ""emtpy her stomach....you know...upchuck!"" as Wojo tells Barney in his inimitable Polish way.  Upon hearing this everyone turns to Yemana and says ""give her coffee!"".  See it for yourself to see how it turns out!",1242000000,3,2982,4.507407407407407

3263404,5,B000YGGNGK,"Barney Miller is one of those shows that holds up over time, even if its' ideals and naviete are of a bygone era.  Barney, played by Hal Linden, is the fatherly figure that leads this wonderful ensemble of actors through daily life at the 12th precinct in New York City.  Whether it's dealing with the myriad of characters his detectives come into contact with or helping his men deal with their own problems, he is a thoughtful listener as he guides them to their own solutions.  Two of the detectives, played by Abe Vigoda and Jack Soo had a deadpan delivery of their lines that would have been the envy of Jack Benny or Steven Wright.  Ron Glass-the hip dectective is also a part time writer and full time clotheshorse and trend-setter;  Maxwell Gail, Wojohowitz, finds his ideals don't always jive with those he comes into contact with.  His temper tends to get to get the better of him when this happens, and when it does, fatherly Capt. Miller steps in to calm things down.  Gregory Sierra, as Det. Almanguada, is the Latino that seesaws between what the writers saw as the Latino temper stereotype and a more subdued and reflective individual.  Sierra, rises above the writing to deliver wonderful performances.  While the writing relects some stereotypic ideas and traits, Barney Miller is and was a sensitive and idealized portrayal of not only the realationship between law enforcement and public but also between individuals themselves.  The humor is smart and crisp. Best of all, Barney Miller is never maudeline, much to the credit of the writers, director and cast.  It is one of the best series ever produced.",1211068800,4,1624,4.805755395683454

The jokes are fast and furious and Hal Linden (Barney Miller) and the rest of the cast are wonderful.  The episodes run the gambit of scenarios.  Everything from retirement to on-the-job romance to gay bashing are dealt with intelligently and humorously.  I'm almost certain you'll find yourself watching these episodes again and again.

Fans of the Barney Miller Show will be happy to see that the wait is finally over and perhaps we can even hope that subsequent years will be released at a much more rapid pace than what we've seen so far.

While the first season was short and still finding its way, we start to see the show develop into its true routine here. Barney's wife is in just two episodes (a welcome relief) and life in the squad room clearly takes center stage. The one exception to that rule is a single episode that revolves around Fish (Abe Vigoda) that feels very much like a pilot for a spinoff series that never happened. That same episode also introduces the character of Det. Dietrich (Steve Landesberg) who becomes a regular in Season Three.

Watching these episodes again after such a long time has been a real treat. The cast is stellar and the writing much more intelligent than the typical sitcom. Abe Vigoda is especially deserving of praise as his deadpan delivery makes almost anything seem funny. If you're a fan of the show, you will definitely want Season Two. If you haven't seen it and are curious this is actually a great place to start since the first season is very uneven in quality.",1207526400,4,1499,5.0894308943089435
3263408,5,B000YGGNGK,"More of this classy series has finally became available on DVD. The first season (a paltry 13 episodes) came out several years ago, and it has taken a long time to add to that collection.  With all of the garbage that is being released on DVD, we need more of this level of quality.

Barney Miller is an ensemble piece about a group of policemen trying to control the chaos without losing their humanity.  Today's ""cop shows"" are so obsessed with realism that they forget the value of a little perspective, especially a humorous one.  Like MASH, Barney Miller can take you from a guffaw to tears in a heartbeat, and the streets of New York City in the 70s provide an even more varied backdrop than does the Korean (or its analogue, the Vietnam) war.

The episodes in this collection are classic, from ""The Layoff"" which was written in response to the city's plea to the Federal Government for emergency funding, to which the Feds responded with a resounding ""Drop Dead"" to the colorful characters that are always multidimensional and unique.  The quality of this show is unsurpassed.  I sincerely hope that the rest of these shows are released at reasonable intervals.

Linda Lavin's best role was here as Det. Janice Wentworth, definitely NOT Alice.  Abe Vigoda as Fish reels off great one-liners.  Much was made at the time (I was 15) about the diversity of the group and it genuinely made a difference.  Plus you get a better insight to the 70's than just about any show with respect to the issues of the day.  I can't wait for the rest of the series to come out!!!",1206489600,13,714,4.363636363636363

Will the federal government bailout New York City? And, yet, they find ways to make us laugh at what many consider to be the most real cop show on television.

Linda Lavin makes four appearances as Det. Wentworth (Before she became ""Alice""); She & Wojo are developing a relationship. Dietrich makes his first appearance (appearing a few episodes before as a priest who never was). Fish is on the verge of retirement, we even get an episode of him at home. Harris begins his writing career for the local police newspaper.

The comedy is turned on high, we can't help but laugh at what goes on at Precinct 12. Even Barney himself carries on as a trooper maneuvering through a couple of episodes with a broken foot.

3263413,5,B000YGGNGK,"Barney Miller was(along with Hill Street Blues and the first three seasons of MASH) the last prime-time, commercial television show that I actually scheduled into my weekly ""To-Do"" list, so I greeted with absolute elation the news that somebody had finally made the second season available. I check here almost daily to see if additional seasons have been released (and would appreciate if anybody in the know would let me know if the release of additional seasons are on the way.)
It isn't hard to figure out why Barney M. was, and still is, the high watermark in television comedy: Good writing. The story, the humor was everything. No exotic sets (basically the entire eight seasons are shot in the squad room) no special effects, no sex, no violence. All the money seems to have been spent on writing good scripts. The cast look, talk and act like real, believable people in the real world. (There are actually old people in the cast, women who don't bulge from low-cut blouses and parents that don't look like high school students.) Even more amazing, most of the characters dealt with here are actually non-people like taxi drivers, plumbers, waitresses and street urchins who take a bus to work. Everybody in entertainment today knows that real people are doctors, lawyers, advertising executives, bankers and handsome corporate heads who drive expensive sports cars. Character development is fantastic, and even semi-regulars  like Lugar and Skanlon are unique, superbly developed characters..and hilarious.
This show is, above all, a rare adult comedy. I understand it hasn't been released before (aside from the first season) because there didn't seem to be a market for it.",1204243200,17,1684,5.07942238267148
