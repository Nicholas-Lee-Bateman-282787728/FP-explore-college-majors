7873514,2,6304524722,"There is NO bloopers in this video.  This is a tape that shows 39 straight minutes of action from the 70's/early 80's with annoying background music.  I think this tape was poorly set up because it had absolutly no talking in  it.  It started up with showing wrestling clips and after 39 minutes, the  tape just cut off. This is ok, if ya like to see action from back in the  day, and it barely earns the 2 stars, but for the price, I guess you can't  really complain.",946252800,11,468,4.191011235955056
