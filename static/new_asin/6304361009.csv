Together, they go on a killing spree, eliminating the most popular kids at  school, only seeing their plans backfire, when the most hated kids at  school become the most-loved.

850624,5,6304361009,"A sparkling script which plunges its claws firmly into every teen movie cliche, stellar performances from Slater and Ryder, and a brilliant encapsulation of some of the worst of 1980s ""style"" make this one  of my favourite movies of all time.  The story revolves around a pair of  teen killers who make Mickey & Mallory look like slow-moving dullards.  Their quest to make their high school ""a nicer place""  incorporates strip croquet, cow tipping, murder-by-Dran-O and some of the  best one liners this side of ""This Is Spinal Tap..."".

850625,5,6304361009,"""Heathers"" is one of my all time favorite movies! I recommend buying it for anyone who loves the darker side of the teen years, and also for anyone who loves some great one-liners. This movie defines the high  school experience by subconsciously fulfilling the need for every teenager  to be rid of that oh-so-annoying clique of snobs that is present in any  high school in America.

You'll learn to hate  the ""Heathers"" and will want to kill them as much as I did.  Draino anyone? Don't know if you want to see it still? Oh come on, splurge  a little!

850810,4,6304361009,"RELEASED IN 1989 and directed by Michael Lehmann, Heathers stars Winona Ryder as Veronica, a high school student in Ohio who has sold herself out to join the popular clique of three girls, all coincidently named Heather (Kim Walker, Lisanne Falk & Shannen Doherty). The more she spends time with them, however, the more she discovers she cant stand them. Enter mysterious new kid, JD (Christian Slater), who has a macabre solution to Veronicas conundrum.

This is an oddball teen movie that tries to be edgy and amusing with its black humor and overt cussing. Future movies were influenced by it, like Jawbreaker (1999) and maybe even Mean Girls (2004). The commentary on peer pressure, teen suicide and the maiming destructiveness of cliques is potent. Teens can be misled by the popular students, yes, but they can also be misled by the outcasts.

Slater stands out as a sorta dark Fonz of the late 80s, easily one of his best roles ever. Ryder is surprisingly good as the protagonist. I say surprisingly because I was never big on her (although I didn't dislike her either). The first act is quite good, but the story gets humdrum in the middle; thankfully, the last 20 minutes perk up. The late 80s ambiance is to die for.

Im not going to give it away, but the original ending was way more morbid. They had an alternative ending that they didn't go with either. Apparently the studio pressured the writer/director to go with the theatrical ending, which I approve. Its a story of redemption. Being misled by corrupt people for a season doesnt define a person forever.

THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hours & 43 minutes and was shot in Los Angeles (the high school) and surrounding area (Santa Monica, Tujunga and Pasadena). WRITER: Daniel Waters.

851202,5,6304361009,"The 1998 cult satire film ""Heathers"" is essentially a review on many of the cultural teenage clichs that we have so effortlessly brushed aside in today's society. Director Michael Lehmann highlights the irony, sadness, and fragility of teenagers desiring to be popular, to be authentic, to be heard, to be respected, to be loved, and to have angst through a fictional high school set in Sherwood, Ohio. The film follows the Westerberg High's crew of popular girls of Heather Chandler (Kim Walker), Heather Duke (Shannen Doherty), Heather McNamara (Lissane Falk), and Veronica Sawyer (Winoca Ryder). Through a series of unfortunate events, carefully calculated plots, and dark secrets the people of Westerberg High are put at a great risk from bad-boy ""dark horse"" J.D. (Christian Slater).

851208,4,6304361009,"I loved this movie when I was a teen in the 90's, but hadn't seen if for probably around 20 years before I decided to buy it after bringing the movie up in conversations from time to time. As well as the dark humour I'd always remembered the 80's attitudes of this film with things like bottled mineral water meaning someone was gay, simply by putting it at a scene, the cops pull it out and just know.  Likewise the dad at the funeral. All the dark humour scenes I'd remembered over the years were as good as ever, but I had to admit I was hoping there were others I'd forgotten, but once all the ""fake suicides"" are done, the movie is a bit slow after that. I had forgotten the whole son and dad switching roles in every conversation Slater's character had with his father.  It becomes more of a dark thriller once the bully suicides are done until the end of the film.  Still I highly recommend Heathers.  Heathers is by far the best ""mean girls"" type movie, the film of that title made after this. Heathers is synonymous with the term dark comedy, when you come across another dark comedy movie, and try and explain what it is, you usually say, if you liked Heathers, you'll like this too.

On the DVD version (region 4) I bought, there's also a twenty one minute interview with the scriptwriter, director and producer, there they talk about how the film got made, alternative actresses who could have played Veronica such as Justine Bateman as well as Heather Chandler, who Heather Graham was keen to play before he parents said no as it was too Satanic.  They talk about how schools have changed today in America and how the events of Columbine and other massacres have had people comment on the film. They acknowledge if this film was made today it would be different and scenes like the gun one in the cafeteria with the jock bullies would have a lot more serious consequences then back then.  They also point out how some critics somehow miss that the film is actually anti suicide for teens and highlights with its teacher and other adult characters how at the time they weren't handling the issue well.  You'll also learn that a few of the actors have died, including one who did take their own life. The scriptwriter also talks the audience through some alternative endings.  If only a few dollars more, if you can get a DVD with the featurette Return to Westerberg High, it's well worth choosing that version.",1471996800,,2422,4.511415525114155
851209,5,6304361009,"This movie is a black comedy classic.  No wonder it rebuffed mainstream audiences when it was first released: with its biting satire and comedic turn on disturbing subject matter, Heathers is too dark for the average couch-potato.  Luckily, it has built a devoted cult following over the years, gaining a rightful reputation as one of the best high school movies ever made.  The dialogue is smart, with infinitely quotable and hysterical lines as ""Did you have a brain tumor for breakfast?"" and ""I love my dead gay son.""  Winona Ryder, one of my favorite actresses, excels in the role of sarcastic, conflicted Veronica.  Christian Slater, however, is the real star of this movie as teenage rebel-cum-murderous psychopath JD. Spouting off nihilistic soliloquies and morbid jokes with a sardonic grin, he oozes a demented charm that truly carries the film.  One of my favorites.",1470700800,,876,5.090909090909091

On the other end of the spectrum, one of my now favorite films of all time, ""In Bruges,"" completely took you there, mixing laughs with murder and exceptional themes. ""Heathers"" is certainly on the ""Bruges"" side of things. It's ""Mean Girls"" written by Quentin Tarantino. I know she's had her problems but I positively fell in love with Winona Ryder as Veronica, the wide-eyed, vastly beyond her years high schooler caught in the middle of teenage angst, except she has psychopath J.D. edging her to do some, uh, highly illegal things. The movie is satire extraordinare, married with some of the funnest teenage writing since the aforementioned Lohan classic. Honestly I laughed a little every time Christian Slater opened his mouth: his devilish J.D. wants to be a prophet, but you can't help but laugh at his voice, which sounds like a 99 cent Jack Nicholson impression. The film mixes deadly serious themes like suicide (tons of it) and fitting in, but it does it all with a smirk and witty phrase. Maybe reserve this for older teens who can distinguish that it is a satire, and yes CSM, Columbine was at the forefront of my mind, especially Slater's character. But this was made long before that tragedy, and the best way to take ""Heathers"" is simply with the goal of having a great laugh.

851294,5,6304361009,"When this movie was first written by genius Daniel Waters, nobody was willing to fund a movie that after the John Hughes era of sugar cookies as High School films, was anything but. Heathers is legendary, and rightfully so. The screenplays bravery tackles on huge issues people still find cumbersome to even think about. If you watch Heathers, you won't be able to escape the pitch black darkness that exists in every High School, whether you're in Westerburg, or anywhere else in America.

Starring
Winona Ryder
Christian Slater
Shannon Doherty
Lisanne Falk
and Kim Walker

Heathers is most often related to the 2004 cult classic Mean Girls, although the two films are so different people like to relay the one common thread between both films, to stop and scare the ""popular"" kids from being cruel and in addition, giving the queen Bitch of the school a lesson she'll never forget.

Veronica Sawyer (Winona Ryder) is a smart, sullen beauty. She graduates from her ""nerdy"" friends in exchange for an offer almost no kid would turn down; become one of ""us"", and be at the top of the social pyramid by Queen Bee Heather Chandler (Kim Walker) who rules the school with an iron fist and an icy stare that could stop a truck. Heather Chandler and her two minions Heather McNamara (Falk) and Heather Duke (Doherty) are the ones in charge. They're feared, hated, worshipped and admired.

It doesn't take Veronica long to realize that she sold out a true friend, Betty Finn, for the selfish, cruel and elitist Heathers. Coming out of left view is Jason Dean, or JD as he likes to be called (Christian Slater) a calm, cool and suave sociopath who thinks the answer to clique problems is as easy as murder. Which is a far cry from Janis (Lizzy Caplan) from Mean Girls. In fact, Kurt and Ram, two senior jocks who are just as bad as the Heathers, decide to act on JD's slick way of putting Veronica under his spell. It is that iconic scene that shows JD has no time for name-calling and taunts in a disturbing act of violence that would terrify any mother to clutch her pearls until she chokes.

What I have to applaud the movie for is its sheer bravery. What other films have tackled school shootings and classroom violence? And the all too sensitive topic of teenage suicide. Being primarily a Comedy, it's nothing short of amazing that while handling these heavy social topics without coming off as pretentious or sleazy. As a former suicidal teen, I can safely say that if anything, Heathers is the anti-suicide valentine any lost and saddened teen can feel a sense of brutal comfort from. This movie doesn't speak, it screams. The messages conveyed are clear and concise. In a potent scene, a character is so desperate to kill themselves, they try to in the girl's bathroom. ""You're throwing your life away to become another statistic"", Veronica passionately asserts. And she's right. Suicide is not a private thing as the movie portrays all too well.

When the Queen Bee gets her head cut off, her ""suicide"" makes her more popular than ever. Students are running to cameras and news networks cashing in on their 10 cent memories of the fallen teenager. It's sick, it's perverse but it's real. I had one of my best friends die in my school and I felt so relatable. After my friend had died, every kid that could get any attention would speak well and fondly of my friend, mostly people who didn't treat him well when he was alive. In this sick and twisted revelation, seeing Heathers a few years later struck me and rocked my mind. Someone actually gets it. The writer, Daniel Waters is a genius. As a society, something that should be private like suicide is instead exploited.

Veronica soon learns that JD has a much bigger plan than just picking off the A-list kids, she gets back her conscious and faces off with her ex lover in a fight to the death stand off.

Shannon Doherty makes her film debut as Heather Duke, a seemingly quiet, bookish girl with bulimia who fills the shoes of the late Heather Chandler, proving to herself and others that she can be just as callous and manipulative. Doherty plays the role with perfection. Heather Duke's transformation from being Chandler's sidekick to successor goes to show that cruelty runs deeper than commitment and High School is a jungle of its own. You can stop a dictator, but who will take their place? The movie answers with a slap in the face reality check.

Full of witty dialogue, great acting, quotable lines and a style that nothing can live up to; Heathers is a champion of Dark Comedies. The wit and sensibility is razor sharp, there is truly no weak moment or player in this film.

Whether you're in High Street, just got out, or barely remember, this film is a must see for anyone and isn't a teen movie that falls so easily into a small young demographic. I think from a 15 year old girl to a 70 year man, Heathers has something for everyone. High School may be the setting, but the film's social commentary hits the nail on the head about any caste system.

With holding as much spoilers back as possible, it's hard to list all the poignant and all-too-real issues Heathers tackles with style. When the movie was first written, it was buzzed around to producers as being a daft, blunt dark satirical comedy that felt wildly inappropriate giveninappropriate given the unapologetic reality this film puts the viewer in. Even when the film was being made, many actors were even warned ""this movie will destroy your career!"" And they couldn't have been more wrong.

Subversive, dark, edgy and unique are just some of many adjectives I can use to describe this gem. What I will say though is ""Teenage Suicide: Don't Do It!"" rang to me loud and clear. This movie, while being about suicide, is in no way encouraging self-destructive behaviour, instead shows you how to be brave. Don't be a Heather, be a Veronica.

Rated R for Violence, Coarse Language, Sexual Content and drug/alcohol use all involving teens

My rating: 15+
The mild violence may disturb some, there are points of the movie that may be uncomfortable to watch. This movie is no sugar sweet lollipop. Brief graphic images involving murder and violence and semi-frequent profanity may offend some.",1468713600,2,6220,4.694495412844037

851458,5,6304361009,"First of all, let me just say right now that this movie is NOT for children. Late teens, maybe! Not children!! With that being said, this movie is one of the greatest dark comedies ever made. It was way head of its time in many ways when you think of the social hierarchy of many schools today. Come on now, I know there were several girls I would have liked to have killed myself when I was in high school. This movie is certainly one of Christian Slater's best, in my opinion. Out of all the 80's brat pack movies, I would have to say that this was one of the most realistic ones when you go inside the dark minds of teenage angst, so it was actually the antithesis of those movies in every way which is a good thing, I guess, since it wasn't directed or produced by John Hughes.

The movie starts of with Heather Chandler, Heather Duke, and Heather McNamara (the Heathers). The odd-ball of the group is Veronica Sawyer, played by Wynona Ryder, who's a happy, but also a reluctant member of the school's most popular, loved, AND HATED clique. Especially since she hates the leader, Heather Chandler. Correction, she hates her, but she likes her all at the same time. Of course this is one of those movies where you get the idea that's it's better to be ""friends"" with the ""mean girls"" or risk being on the other end of their wrath along with the rest of the socially awkward outcasts.

A lot of this sounds familiar all these decades later, doesn't it? I think this movie set a huge precedence here. The good thing is that I don't think there's ever been one that has matched it's ""cleverness"" since.

Moving right along, Veronica becomes smitten with the school's newest bad boy, Jason Dean (Christian Slater). However, it's not until she starts a full-on relationship with him that she sees into his dark, twisted, and dare I say, murderous mind. The fun starts with the death of the first Heather, (of course they make it look like a suicide) and then the snowball effect kicks in .After that, the series of unfortunate events start to happen. Saying any more than that would ruin the whole thing. Does any of that sounds familiar to you? ""Jawbreaker"", perhaps? ""Drop Dead Gorgeous"", ""Clueless"", the surplus of Lifetime Movie Network films, need I say more?

This movie touches on lots of hot topics regarding teens such as popularity, jealousy, death, exploitation after death in regards to social status, sexuality, unhealthy friendships, unhealthy romantic relationships, and  trendy suicide attempts. ALL  from a very dark perspective. I wouldn't miss this movie if I were you!!!",1455926400,,2588,4.6644736842105265
851459,5,6304361009,"I bought the movie after seeing a production of Heathers the Musical in Nashville! This movie is a hidden gem that everyone should watch!

Veronica soon finds herself falling for JD who in turn, starts to help Veronica with her problem with the Heathers.

Director Michael Lehmann has made some really dreadful films, like Airheads, 40 Days and 40 Nights, and My Giant. Heathers, though, is a notable exception. I'm not sure how I feel about the ending (my feelings may change with another viewing), but overall, this film is a fairly effective black comedy.",1437955200,,855,4.903448275862069

I don't think this film succeeded at either. I think it was mostly just stupid, violent, and mindless. Here are plot highlights, you can judge for yourself:

Three ""Heathers"" make up a clique at the high school.
Veronica (Ryder) is also allowed to join the clique.
Heathers clique plays croquet together.
Veronica is attracted to student JD (Slater), ""rebel without a cause"" type.
JD pulls a gun and fires shots (blanks) on two jocks / bullies in the cafeteria.
Veronica tires of the Heathers, decides she does not like them.
JD and Veronica kill a Heather by spiking her milk with drain cleaner.
Veronica writes a fake suicide note, everyone thinks Heather killed herself.
Veronica goes to a college party with a Heather, avoids date rape.
Rumor is spread around that Veronica had oral sex with two jocks.
JD and Veronica kill the jocks by luring them to a rendezvous and shooting them.
This time, the suicide note is designed to make them seem homosexual.
Martha, grossly obese and unpopular student, tries to step into traffic to kill herself.
Another Heather tries to commit suicide by taking pills, is stopped by Veronica.
Veronica breaks up with JD, he goes to her bedroom with the intention of shooting her.
Veronica feigns hanging herself in her bedroom, fools JD into thinking she is dead.
Wearing an overcoat, JD plants bombs in and below the gym with pep rally.
Veronica stops JD, shoots him several times, the bombs do not go off.
Outside the school, Veronica finds JD, he sets off a bomb strapped to his chest.
Veronica invites Martha (unpopular and obese) to hang out with her.

A few parts I liked were 1) the yearbook editor decides to include a two-page spread on the suicide of one of the Heathers, and 2) the reactions of the adults to the spate of ""suicides"". The movie is not totally dumb, just mostly.",1407628800,,1959,4.691860465116279

It also points out the dangers of cliques and how important acceptance is.  I loved this movie growing up and still do.  If you remember watching this movie in the late eighties or early nineties, you may want to check it out again.  It was actually a lot funnier than I remembered.

""Heathers"" (1989 releases; 111 min.) brings the ultimate high school movie, in which 3 girls named Heather are the 'cool' girls who feel free to terrorize the lesser cool kids. Veronica (played by Wynona Rider) tries to be a part of the Heathers clan, but doesn't really buy into it. She befriends J.D. (played by Christian Slater), a self-pronounced rebel, who is all too happy to teach the Heathers a lesson. Before we know it, Veronica and J.D. induce the top Heather to drink a potent drink that leaves her dead. Veronica's first reaction: ""I'll have to send my SATs to San Quentin instead of Stanford"", ha! But Veronica and J.D. manage to make it look like a suicide. To tell you more will spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this movie is darker than black. You can't really call it a comedy (even though there are a number of funny sequences). Neither can you call it a commentary on society set in '89, but instead call it a visionary movie on the future. Given on how things play out, there is no chance, ZERO, that a movie like that would be made today. ""My teenage angst has a body count"" comments the Veronica character, and sadly this has happened too many times in real life in recent years. Talk about premonition. The movie is of course also memorable for the early career performances of Wynona Rider and Christian Slater. They look so young!

The DVD comes with a number of extras, the best being the 30 min. documentary made many years later called ""Swatch Dogs and Diet Coke Heads"", interviewing the cast and the makers of this film with the benefit of 20-20 hindsight. It's pretty clear none of them had any idea how long a shadow this movie would cast all these years later.

852257,4,6304361009,"Roughly 25 years after is release, Director Richard Lehman's now cult classic black comedy  is still rightfully the subject of much conjecture.
  Most likely loosely based on Randall Sullivan's 1985 article for ""Rolling Stone"" magazine, ""Death of a Cheerleader""( later a TV movie in its own right), ""Heathers""  tells the tale of the downfall of the vapid but most popular clique at Westerburg High School in Sherwood, Ohio.
  To a gently sung riff of the song,""Que Sera Sera"", the red scrungie of the blonde-haired leader of the attractive and wealthy  clique  of Heathers--this one with the surname of Chandler(The promising Kim Walker, whose infamous line from this film, ""Did you have a brain tumor for breakfast?"" in response to a comment she thought to be stupid, has become ironic as the aforementioned disorder claimed her life 13 years ago today) comes into view as she presides over a game of croquet at the home of Veronica Sawyer (Winona Ryder), the only non-Heather of the group, with the well-read bulimic Heather Duke(Shannen Doherty), and the emotionally fragile cheerleader, Heather McNamara(Lisanne Falk). They are the epitome of fleeting High School glory.
  Although a guest in someone else's home, the bossy Ms Chandler asserts her rights over the red ball at all times, and there is a bit of symbolic imagery in how the studious, brilliant Veronica, once a more independent girl with a nicer set of friends, is treated by her clique mates.
 We observe their routine at school where the humiliate students at the bottom of the social latter, most notably the quiet, obese loner, Martha Dunnstock(Carrie Lynn), and annoy students with pseudo-intellectual polls.
 At one point, two football players  named Kurt Kelly and Ram Sweeney( Lance Fenton and Patrick Labourteaux), with too much time on their hands, harass a dour, leather-clad newcomer named J.D. (Christian Slater) as he sits at a lunch table.  In a rehearsal for a later scene, J.D. pulls a gun on his detractors, much to everyone's alarm, and receives a relatively minor punishment from school authorities, who would have done better to have heeded Heather Chandler's observation to her friends that he should have been incarcerated.
 Veronica has a chance to talk with J.D. later on  while at a convenience store where she is picking up  Corn Nuts for the impatient Heather Chandler, as they are en route to an illicit college party.
 Veronica expresses her dissatisfaction with her life as part of the popular set, claiming that she doesn't like her friends. The frequently uprooted J.D. agrees with her on this point, noting that he's observed similar patterns  among High School students everywhere he's lived.
  Veronica rushes off to the party with Heather Chandler, and fails to make a decent showing as a party guest, vomiting at one point, earning Heather Chandler's ire.
  Heather threatens to tell everyone about Veronica's behavior and ruin her social life.
  J.D. appears at Veronica's house later that evening, and after a game of strip croquet that leads to a sexual liason on the Sawyer Family's lawn, J.D. agrees to help Veronica put Heather Chandler in her place before Heather, the promiscuous party girl can humiliate her.
 This part of the story does resemble ""Death of a Cheerleader"" wherein an attempt to sabotage public humiliation takes a fatal twist.
  Amid what will be a rising body count, we see Veronica devastated at the way she is so easily deceived by J.D., whose relationship with his demolition man father(Kirk Scott), and the death of his mother will explain more than a few things about why he is so twisted.
  As the new head of the clique, we will see Heather Duke step up her game of being conniving and spiteful, an inept space cadet of a teacher(Penelope Milford) who commands no respect from anyone completely mishandle the situation, false friends pandering before TV cameras in response to the first alleged ""suicide"", the truly nice kids of the school, Rodney(Jon Shear), Veronica's friend prior to her joining the Heathers clique, Betty Finn (Renee Estevez) take a back seat, a Principal (John Ingle), priest(Glen Shadix), and two police officers(Mark Bringelson and Chuck Lafort)  among the many who are mislead about the calamities, three attempted suicides, and two affluent parents(William Cort and Jennifer Rhodes) who are completely unaware of things their daughter is really up to.
 Another irony since the film's release is tragic suicide in March, 2000 of actor Jeremy Applegate, who played the ambitious student Peter Dawson, whose character hoped that he would never commit such an act.
 While a little on the sick and twisted side, the film lays bare some undeniable truths about the issue of teen violence, and as Veronica gradually claws her way to self-reclamation(although there is a feeling that she will pay for her crimes somewhere down the line) and eventually makes amends in certain areas, taking the red scrungie as her merit badge, there is a sense of grim satisfaction  that she has shed all the evil influences of her life, at least for the time being.",1394064000,,5105,5.030915576694412

(You're being messed with already.) Finally, the punch-line, which has something to do with Veronica's (Winona Ryder's) head. If you're looking for things to be more conventional after that, forget it.

""Heathers"" is not a chick flick. It is not a teen angst flick. It is definitely not a feel-good romance. It is not about the enduring friendships formed in high school. There are catty chicks, romance, friendships and angst but not in the ways you might think. When I first saw it way back when and when I saw it on cable last weekend, one word came to mind: Power. This is a movie about domination and who rules whom. And this power is based on shallowness, deception and the possession of violent tools. In other words, it's a great comedy! Dark as it may sound, it gets even darker. And funnier. Another reviewer mentioned this movie as being a great strain on one's willing suspension of disbelief. But if you can do it, the comedic reward is rich! This is a great dark comedy. Ryder, Doherty, model Lisanne Falk, and the late Kim Walker are perfectly cast and seem to really enjoy their roles.

In the slew of high school movies made in the 80s, three rise above the pack as classics:  ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"";  ""Better Off Dead"" with John Cusack;  and ""Heathers.""  I am roughly the same age as most of the stars of these flicks (Matthew Broderick, John Cusack and Christian Slater are all, like me, children of the 1960s; while the female lead of ""Heathers"" was slightly older, from 1971).  By the end of the 80s I was fed up to the back teeth with teen movies and missed all three of these superlatives on their first run.  In fact, I came to ""Ferris"" twenty-five years after it hit the theaters, ""Better Off Dead"" more than a quarter-century after it was made, and ""Heathers"" (last but not necessarily least) at only slightly less than that (it came out in 1989 and I saw it first in 2013).

My unfamiliarity with these movies was a terrible strain to lots of my friends in the 1990s.  I was running with a younger crowd and they were always talking about ""Ferris"" and, even more, about ""Heathers.""  In fact, one friend had what amounted to an obsession with it.  And I, their best friend, never picked up on any of their references.

All three movies hold up well, but all are problematic.  ""Better Off"" -- about a young man (Cusack) who tries unsuccessfully to kill himself after his girlfriend breaks up with him -- is arguably the funniest movie of the bunch, though its wackiness fades in the big ski contest at the end.  ""Ferris"" is, for the most part, exactly what it purports to be:  viz, a feel-good movie about a boy who plays hookey.  It loses its compass in the beginning of the final act, but finds its way back on track in the final chase sequence.

Like the other two, ""Heathers"" is a comedy, but it belongs in a different class.  It's about three girls in a high school clique, all of whom are named Heather;  and a fourth girl, Veronica, who has only recently been catapulted to their stratospheric levels.  The Heathers (and Veronica, Winona Ryder) are the cool girls, but they have a penchant for wicked practical jokes.  Veronica is having a few qualms of conscience, but she doesn't know how to deal with the problem other than by making vicious (and hilarious) entries in her diary.

Enter J.D. (Christian Slater), a new boy in school, who knows how to pay wicked little girls back.  In the dark comedy that follows Veronica and J.D. start murdering Heathers.  And Jocks.  And just about anyone else they don't like.

Where Heathers fails is that is doesn't go far enough.  EXTREME SPOILER.  In ""Heathers"" best scene, Veronica, feeling pangs of guilt, pushes a hot car cigarette lighter into her hand, and J.D. lights a smoke from her red-hot palm.  It's too bad the movie did not retain that attitude for the rest of the picture.

It starts to go wrong -- remember, here there be spoilers -- when, at the funeral of one of  their victims (well, two) Veronica and J.D. start laughing.  A little girl with a sad face looks back at Veronica, and the horror of what they are doing begins to impress itself on Veronica's psyche.  In a dark comedy, death should be unapologetic.  But after this Veronica begins to pit herself against J.D.  And then J.D.'s character goes wrong and he launches into the old canard about how no one ever loved him.  Boo-hoo.

After Veronica tries to stop any more murders the movie lurches off in the direction of a slasher film and it never finds its sea legs again.  It has one last superb moment EXTREME SPOILER (where Veronica, who missed an entire jock with a handgun before, is now such a good shot she's able to shoot off a single finger), but by that time the flick is moribund.

Though it calls itself ""Heathers"" and poses as a murderous romp where the Heathers are all set up as excellent targets for homicide, Veronica and J.D. leave some of the Heathers alive at the end.

So, ""Ferris Bueller"" is a success because it wants to be a feel-good movie and ends up that way despite a bit of bewilderment near the end;  but while ""Heathers"" starts out as wickedly funny dark comedy it almost become a message movie.  Too bad.

And I hope that while I have remained tidily childless, all the friends I used to run around with, who were obsessed with how great ""Heathers"" was, now have kids nearing high school age.  That's the great thing about irony.  It's so ironic.",1369699200,4,4503,4.514851485148514

When the pressures of popularity become too much to bear, Veronica decides to climb the social ladder by killing off her classmates with the help of her new rebel boyfriend, but their plan backfires when teen suicide becomes the hip new fad on campus! Daniel Waters' brilliant black comedy turns the tables on teen hits like SIXTEEN CANDLES and THE BREAKFAST CLUB, showing the darker side of the high school experience. His are teens that have been generally overlooked by their parents and teachers, and whose friends are more like enemies in an uncaring social battlefield. The warped humor and exaggerated situations in HEATHERS make it quite unlike any other comedy of its time, while the hushed topic of teen suicide is brought to the surface in a provocative yet contemplative manner that avoids disrespect through its absurd handling of the subject. Winona Ryder gives an unforgettable performance as Veronica, allowing Christian Slater the time to work on his Jack Nicholson impression beside her. Still just as relevant and frighteningly funny than ever, HEATHERS has stood the test of time as the teen comedy that defined a generation disenchanted youth. As JD plainly states, ""The extreme always seems to make an impression.""

Before proceeding, I would like to thank Gary F. Taylor for his excellent review of this film.

I'll also note that one of the visual bits seems to be an allusion to the horror-comedy Hotel Hell.

Behind the over-the-top dark funniness, there is a genuine feeling for the traumas that lurk behind the plain walls of high school - appropriately ultra-plain in the film.

I showed the film to friends just after the CO theatre massacre, and I find this film more interesting than the repetitious and exploitative reportage that is all too typical of TV. Compared with TV, the film sheds more light on the motivations of disturbed young people who commit attrocities, although it doesn't explore the copycat phenomenon.

Not a horror movie, though there is hilarious horrible deeds done in this film. Also, some down right cold, disturbingly horrible deeds done in this film.  Not a fantasy, though there is fantastical funny happenings here, & some fantastical sobering, somber happenings here.

A true black & blue, black comedy, with enough devious wit for 10 movies. Right on the mark acting, especially Christian Slater as the manically black hearted, funny J.D., whom killing people to him is like playing 18 holes of golf on a sunny 80 degree day, while skipping school! J.D. offs half the high school with the glee of a 13 year old boy who has just got his first kiss!

Winona Ryder as Veronica, is perfect as one of four girls (the only one who is not named Heather & the only one with black hair) who rule their high school like the wicked witches of the west, but she wants out, anyway she can, or so she thinks. So J.D. comes in like her knight in shining black armor, & they both plot to do the three Heathers (hence the name ""Heathers) in! But along the way, other popular kids get the Heather treatment too, & Veronica is having second thoughts about J.D.

""Heathers"" is definitely a twisted film for those with a twisted sense of humor, the more twisted the better! Truly an original break through black comedy that has a rabid cult following, but never got excepted to college.",1337040000,,1396,4.5458167330677295

The story, the characters, the look, the sound, they all add to the overall feel of the film and make it a great example of American satire. The dialogue is witty, the characters smart, and the plot line solid.

I already owned a copy of ""Heathers"" when this edition was released so I hesitated to buy it, but I ultimately caved in and got it.

And boy was I happy I did so.

First off, the locker is a fantastic idea for a rerelease of this movie. So many movies don't even try to capture the essence of the film in their rerelease packaging but I really think the marketing & design departments went over and beyond for this one.

Included in the locker were two DVDs and a Blu Ray. The film itself is same old same old but the special features disc includes two documentaries and a few other extras. I don't own a Blu Ray player as of yet so I haven't been able to watch the Blu Ray version but I'm sure the quality is amazing.

The discs were inside of a shockingly realistic yearbook from 1988, profiling the trends and such from that year. Also included was a fake Algebra II book that held a t shirt inside. The t shirt is quite large, but I'm sure it'll shrink a little after being washed.

The magnets are fantastic! I put them on my fridge so every time I get something to drink I can laugh a little.

853095,4,6304361009,"The 1989 dark comedy ""Heathers"" stars Winona Ryder, Christian Slater, Shannen Doherty, Kim Walker and Lisanne Falk. It centers on a clique of four girls-3 of which are named Heather- and the highschool drama that surrounds them. This film, deals with heavy issues such as hazing, suicides, and murder. Ryder's character, Veronica, is part of the 'Heather' clique but doesn't judge people by their looks or likes to deal with the drama that comes along with being in highschool. The Heathers (Doherty, Walker, and Falk) take pleasure in trying to sabotage people's lives and Veronica won't stand for it. Slater's character, J.D.,  befriends Veronica and they collaborate together to bring down the leader of the Heathers, Heather number 1. Can they succeed or will it be an epic failure for all of Westerberg High to witness?

I guess the best word to describe this film would be crazy. I recently saw this film, because I've always been intrigued and interested and seeing it in the year 2010, twenty one years after its release,  probably had a different effect on me than people who saw it back in the 80s. For starters, it's vulgar, it's rated R do to sexual situations, gore and violence. Right from the start I was in shock at how crude the language and some situations are that it's hard to believe it's a highschool comedy. This day and age we have vulgar, disturbing movies but they are never within a highschool comedy or drama. But, ""Heathers"" is also a very dark highschool comedy that I never knew until I watched it.

I really enjoyed this film, mainly because it was different than anything I have ever seen. Sure 'Mean Girls' is similar with the mean cliques and stuck up snobs but that was more funny and fun than dark and suspenseful like 'Heathers'. I liked how ridiculous some of the lines were and how it had that classic 80s feel, that all 80s movies have. I think it stands out because of the fact that it has a lot of gumption. It doesn't hold back and director Michael Lehmann took a lot of risks and succeeded.

I thought all the actors were decent, Slater and Ryder were a good match and the audience loves to hate Shannen Doherty which was a great surprise to me that she was in it. I think this movie will always be considered great because of its unique idea and outlandish characters and plotline.

All in all I would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys 80s movies, films that don't hold back and people who have lived through highschool and probably have encountered at least one person just like a Heather.

853098,3,6304361009,"The movie tells the story of typical, 1980's, Hollywood stylized version of high school--there are the jocks and the nerds and the quintessential queen bees that are running the show.

Veronica (Winona Ryder) and her friends, all named Heather, are the most popular of the popular, but Veronica feels she is different from her friends.  She is deeper and more introspective (probably because she wears a monocle).  In any case, when the new rebel (Christian Slater) enrolls in school and threatens to turn the traditional hierarchy on its head, Veronica immediately signs up for the ride.  Unfortunately, she doesn't fully understand his means and methods to social reordering.

The movie was made prior to Columbine and other high-profile school tragedies.  This movie is clearly an over-the-top satire, but I doubt any movie company would be willing to touch the subject matter today.  It is part of the American cinemagraphic lexicon.  Everyone has to see it.  Plus you get great lines like, ""What is your damage, Heather?"" and ""Well, f*** me gently with a chainsaw.""",1270166400,2,1070,5.103448275862069

853200,5,6304361009,"Heathers is a fantastic movie full of wit, wryness, and sarcasm, and yes, twisted humor.  The snobby clique (all girls named ""Heather"", with the exception of not-so-snobby Veronica, played by Winona Ryder) present an exaggerated look at an alpha-female high school group.  If you've been a high school girl at any point in time, they're not as over-the-top as it seems.  You have Christian Slater playing the bad-ass J.D. in this movie, complete with motorcycle.  J.D. convinces Veronica to play pranks on the snobby kids, yet one by one, the pranks end in those kids' deaths and J.D. using Veronica's abilities to forge her friends' handwriting to cover the deaths up as suicides, complete with manufactured suicide notes.

***SPOLIERS AHEAD***

The movie premise is unrealistic on so many levels.  Honestly, would the first Heather really drink Drano out of a cup on a dare?  I mean, after the first sip, surely she'd spit it out rather than down the whole thing?  After that death, would Veronica really go along with J.D.'s plan to set-up the football jocks in the woods?  Her character is a smart girl, and yet she's made to look ""dumb and in love"" as she follows J.D.'s schemes without questioning his motives or intentions?  And what's up with J.D.'s dad in this movie?  What a weird character to randomly throw in as an attempt to explain why J.D. is so messed up.

But all in all, it's a great film, I love the sarcastic one-liners, the dry humor, the fact that Winona Ryder and Christian Slater look fantastic in this movie...  I love that they play strip croquet, and all the 80's fashion is even more fun to watch now that that decade has passed (Swatch watches! Jackets with padded shoulders! Odd color combos!)

Definitely a good movie to add to your collection, but only if you don't take yourself too seriously and have a good appreciation for dark humor.",1268179200,2,1871,4.74922600619195

853203,1,6304361009,"I finally caved to the hype and watched ""Veronicas"" on a slow Sunday night. Wow - I was amazed at how perfectly it failed to live up to every expectation. Smart, well-read people told me that this film is smart; it is typical dopey teen stoner talk smart - ""Donnie Darko"" smart. The dialog is haltingly false. The hero's motives are beyond unbelievable. Even if the movie had been brilliantly edited (it wasn't) the pacing would still suffer from a poorly constructed story.... I'm sorry - constructed is too strong a word...

The story doesn't cohere because the screenwriter didn't know anything about storytelling. The comedy didn't function for me because the story flatlines after the first staged suicide, with an intolerably long wind down to the third act, which is just the last few minutes of the film. Imagine that there was a third Coen brother - one who was kicked in the head by a horse as a child - that is who made this movie.

""Veronicas"" is posited as a dark, thoughtful satire, but its cultural background is lost on me these decades later. Apparently ""HEY GUISE TEEN SUICIDE!!!!"" was hot topic in 1989, and the mere mention made people feel all weighty and thinky.

I suspect that this movie is so hyped because hip, influential people reviewed it favorably. Maybe the movie is worth preserving as a historical curiosity because, even considering advances in technology, this level of irony is probably not possible to achieve today.

On the positive side, I will recommend a few movies that were doubtless influenced by this inexplicably revered standard:

Mean Girls: a much lighter movie written by SNL's Tina Fey. It looks at the same phenomena in high school society. Unlike ""Veronicas"", it is a has just a tinge of darkness and is written to well adjusted teens. And most unlike ""Veronicas"" it actually is funny.

World's Greatest Dad: written and directed by ""Bobcat"" Goldthwait. It manages all the challenges that ""Veronicas"" took on and succeeds in every category. It is relentlessly dark, viciously satirical, and painfully hilarious.",1261267200,9,2064,4.916666666666667
853204,3,6304361009,"I suppose at one time a movie like this one would be considered funny.  However, since 9-11, Columbine, and suicide bombers, this movie really loses any appeal it may have had.  Christian Slater appears as a wannabe Jack Nicholson/James Dean character who seems to have it in for his peers.  He tricks Veronica into killing her fellow students.  At first it seems like it was just a scare gag gone wrong, but soon we learn that this kid really is not content until he kills as many classmates as possible.

As a parent of a high schooler, I found this quite disturbing and realy not that good of a movie.  Some of the performances were decent, but the whole storyline was troublesome to me.  I think there is too much emphasis on death in the teenagers world and this film only heightens that emphasis.",1260144000,3,802,4.527777777777778

This movie really makes you think about what is important, like popularity and having the ""right"" friends. And just like in real life, you find characters doing things that you know they never would do and you find that maybe being popular and pretty isn't so important.

----------------
Heather McNamara: It's your turn Heather.
Heather Chandler: No, Heather, it's Heather's turn. Heather?
Heather Duke: Sorry Heather.
========================

Veronica Sawyer (Winona Ryder) is the only non-Heather in the Heathers clique, and she is still being hazed by the full-fledged members. It's brutal in High School. They make her forge notes for pranks on the misfit kids. She reluctantly goes along -- for now.

At home Veronica is the trendy teen with a perky quirky vocabulary of the latest slang.

--------------
Veronica Sawyer: Great pate, mom, but I gotta motor if I wanna be ready for that party tonight.
====================

Then she meets a stranger. J.D. (Christian Slater) is a dark and brooding teenager dressed in black. He must have been trying to play the entire role using his Jack Nicholson impression voice. His continual brooding is occasionally supplanted by a mischievous grin.

-------------------
J.D.: Seven schools in seven states and the only thing different is my locker combination.
========================

Veronica is impressed, but a bit taken aback. J.D. it seems was also acutely aware of the cruelty of the Heathers, as was she. This strange realization created a bond between them that was beginning to grow. J.D. constantly challenged Veronica's involvement with the Heathers. The more he did, the more their own bonds of affection grew.

--------------------
Veronica Sawyer: How very.
======================

Christian Slater and Winona Ryder are both very young, reckless, and beautiful here. It is worth watching the film just to see them. Winona is astonishingly beautiful, and Slater carries his half of the film with panache.

---------------------
J.D.: [lying on the ground with Veronica under his jacket] Mmm. I thank you. That was my first game of strip croquet.
===========================

The film is a black comedy, and the only problem is that it takes as its subject school shootings, bombings, and violence, and in a post-Columbine world, such subjects are never as funny as they seemed in those halcyon days before Columbine.

Bad break for Heathers. If only it hadn't been so prescient about events yet to come. It could have been a cult film, yeah, it is a cult film, but it could have been a cult film with a much larger cult.

----------------
Heather Chandler: I brought you to a Remington party and what's my thanks? It's on a hallway carpet. I got paid in puke.

853346,4,6304361009,"Heathers is quite prossibly the only (okay, not likely, but I haven't had the chance to see a few other contenders such as Election and Dazed and Confused) high school movie that's good, for various reasons.  First, it's hilarious, and while the plot deals with high school (something that's pretty mundane and can be done as an actual person), it's plot is anything but.  After all, how many homicidial kids that Heathers, despite it's obviously outdated fashion senses (well, the movie still is kind of 80's in fashion), is also pretty relevant today in a sense (though I feel that cliques have softned up and are not as stereotypical today). Besides, I don't think these are the kinds of thigns I never see in High School either.  Of course, that's because I basically ignore most people and talk to the people necessary.

Heathers starts with a mean joke played on some hapless fat chick, one of the most often ridiculed kind of classmate you probably know.  It's mean, but it's darkly hilarious, and maybe even I take some pleasure in seeing it.  The Heathers are depicted beautifully as these nasty, mean clique of three girls, who are determined to be a tryniccal force of girls who rule the school and put nearly every other school pupil to shame.  It's a bitter movie, as most of the characters are not portrayed in a good way, not even Veronica's boyfriend.  Very few are portrayed as good, and even Veronica herself isn't some amped up good person either.

Suffice to say, once Heather meets the outsider to help her get away from the clique she hates, she'll realize that It turns into a pretty biting yet darkly hilarious look into teen suicide as well, and the final confrotation also is eirre.  You're going to have to watch the rest to know what happens at the end.

For what's it's worth, the film-making aspect of it is good, basically because this isn't a heavily-stylized visual feast.  But there is style within, and not just the 80's clothing.  Dramatic camera shots and lighting are used to great effect in this movie, and the soundtrack enchances that, more so than your average movie (give or take explanation, but I think you should just listen to it).  The acting itself is good, it does the job well; Christian Slater is disctinctive amongst the rest of the classmates, and has his own style of speak and dress, which makes him all the more of the ""outsider"".  Winona Ryder and the rest of the Heathers are all rather pretty, though the Heathers of course are just pretty on the outside, obviously.  All the characters are still a bit stereotypical in these days, although, as someone who pretty much goes through school, I haven't had much of a clue, but even the jocks I have talked to aren't as brain dead as the two jocks.  Though I think that may be the point, considering there is elements of satire in this movie.

Plenty of other movies, such as Mean Girls, have made an attempt to ape this movie or have similar plot lines, but movies like that don't portray the kind of popular douchebags as well as this movie does.  And I'll bet that none of those movies are ""...a cynic's chocolate binge!"" (back of the box).  Reccomended.

She is their apprentice whom they are grooming to join their ranks. Daily taunting and humiliation are part of her initiation and Veronica is having a change of heart. She finds an ally in Jason Dean (Christian Slater), or J.D., a mysterious student who has transferred to her school. The two bond over their mutual disgust of the Heathers and J.D. suggests teaching them a lesson. His methods are a bit more extreme than Veronica's and before she knows it she is standing in Heather's bedroom, with J.D., looking down at the dead body of her ""best friend and worst enemy"". J.D. has the idea to make the murder look like a suicide. This sets off a dark chain of murders rigged as suicides targeting all the bullies that J.D. and Veronica despise. The film is extremely dark and shocking. Frightening even in the wake of such high school massacres as Columbine and Virginia Tech. The comparison is unavoidable but yet to focus on that would miss the film maker's intent to create a satire. Daniel Waters' script is extremely intelligent and often funny full of quotable lines. That isn't to say that every joke works since  some try too hard and fall flat. Couple the great writing with great acting from Ryder, Slater, and Shannen Doherty and you have the makings of a cult classic. It's no wonder that 'Heathers' is the most imitated of high school films. Other movies like 'Clueless', 'Jawbreaker', and 'Mean Girls', to name  a few, have borrowed  from it. Worth mentioning is the fact that 'Mean Girls' director Mark Waters is the brother of 'Heathers' writer Daniel Waters.  After 'Juno' came out and Diablo Cody was hailed as an innovative new voice critics began reassessing Dan Waters' work and wrote articles that noted the similarity between him and Cody. Having seen most of his films 'Heathers' is his masterpiece. Unimpressed the first time I saw the film I gave it a second chance years later and now count myself as a big fan. It helps that I'm  a huge Diablo Cody and Winona Ryder fan.  Ryder is gorgeous in one of her best film roles.  The movie isn't without it's faults. It's too long and things start to slow down as it reaches it's shocking conclusion.  The DVD extras have a lot of good stuff like a retrospective documentary and a commentary.

853447,5,6304361009,"Watching ""The Truth About Cats and Dogs"" director Michael Lehmann's audaciously abrasive comedy ""Heathers"" with Winona Ryder and Christian Slater is like spiking your morning orange juice with Drano. Although the unsavory shenanigans of Ryder and Slater are rather morbid and mean-spirited, the victims of their pranks fully deserve the consequences. No, audiences who adored John Hughes' delightful teen angst comedies would probably find it a supreme challenge to sit through this trenchant, traumatic tale. The same applies for uptight religious fanatics and self-conscious prudes without a sick sense of humor. Anybody that has ever suffered at the hands of snobbish people or bullies will relish this film thoroughly and ultimately want to add it to their film collection. Generally, most critics cite the Leonardo DiCaprio drama ""The Basketball Diaries"" as the stimulus for the dreadful Columbine high school massacre. In retrospect, ""Heathers"" surpasses ""The Basketball Diaries"" as a most likely candidate for the movie that triggered the shooting rampage that Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold launched back in April 1999 as a result of the social cliques, subcultures, and bullying that pervaded their Colorado-based high school.

""Heathers"" takes place at Westerburg High School in Sherwood, Ohio, where fashion-minded Veronica Sawyer (Winona Ryder of ""Lost Souls"") tries to fit in with three vain and vicious vixens all of whom share the same first name Heather: Heather Chandler (Kim Walker of ""Say Anything""), Heather Duke (Shannen Doherty of ""Mall Rats"") and Heather McNamara (Lisanne Falk of ""Suicide Kings""), that reserve nothing but venom for all that cross their paths. Veronica comes from a well-to-do but rather dysfunctional family, too. When her father (William Cort) wonders aloud why he reads spy novels and smokes cigarettes, Veronica reminds him that he is an ""idiot."" Strangely, while she lacks the cruelty that drives the Heathers, Veronica has a conscience and a kind word for most people, so she seems rather out-of-place with this terrible triumvirate. Indeed, she seems like a considerate Nazi that follows orders. The Heathers are grooming her and they use her uncanny ability to forge letters. For their first prank, Chandler coerces Veronica into forging a note from a jock to a Martha 'Dumptruck' Dunnstock (Carrie Lynn of ""Disturbed""), a short, fat, ugly girl. While the Heathers and Veronica are up to these antics, Jason J.D. Dean (Christian Slater of ""True Romance"") watches this spectacle from the corner of the lunchroom. Dressed in a long, black coat, J.D. wears a squinty-eyed expression and delivers each line with a Jack Nicholson-esquire accent. Not only does J.D. attract Veronica's interest, but he also draws the attention of two letter-jacketed jocks, Ram Sweeney (Patrick Labyorteaux of ""Ghoulies III"") and Peter Dawson (Jeremy Applegate of ""The Cable Guy""), who try to harass him. J.D. rises and pulls a pistol and shoots them. Later, we learn that he had loaded blanks in his gun.

""Heathers"" was scenarist Daniel Waters' first screenplay. He went on to write ""Hudson Hawk,"" ""Demolition Man,"" and ""Batman Returns."" Waters' script drips with sarcasm galore. Look at the ""Heathers"" home page on IMDb. COM for these memorable barbs. Anyway, Lehmann and he skewer themes like teen suicide and peer pressure without a qualm. Audiences that cringe at the frequent usage of the F-word and the S-word are hereby warned. Eventually, Veronica joins forces with J.D., a loner who has spent his life moving around wherever his father's jobs take him in the construction industry. Like Veronica, J.D. enjoys a witty, irreverent relationship with his dad. Revealing anything else about this absolutely brilliant but politically incorrect chronicle would dilute its impact. Prepare yourself to be entertained and enlightened by one of the more clever example of the 1980s. Sadly, the careers of both Winona Ryder and Christian Slater lost them impact in the late 1999s. She got into trouble for shoplifting, while Slater repeatedly chose bad movies and eventually found himself in straight-to-video schlock with occasional exceptions like John Woo's ""Windtalkers."" Director Michael Lehmann helmed a couple of winners like ""The Truth About Cats and Dogs"" and the goofy ""Airheads,"" but he has confined himself since to television. Nevertheless, ""Heathers"" remains a groundbreaking film that can be watch repeatedly.

Of course, the dark side of this film is that could be charged with creating the kind of moronic, anti-social imbeciles who engineered the Columbine massacre. And you know in our society, we always have to find a scapegoat--like a great movie--to blame what went wrong rather than the parents, administrators, and students that forged those monster.",1228608000,,4799,5.370517928286852
853448,4,6304361009,"I absolutely LOVE this movie. The limited edition set was a great concept, capturing the overall school-themed feeling of the film. The set includes: a T-shirt, tin locker, magnets, 2 dvd's, and the Blu-ray release of the film. The case for the T-shirt is made to look like an old algebra book, while the case for the DVDs is a hard back yearbook with photos and signatures in the back, making it extremely authentic looking.

I was a bit disappointed at the quality of the locker itself. I have another metal locker that I purchased a few years ago, and I figured the quality would be about the same, but it wasn't. The metal that the locker is constructed of is like that of a tin lunch box, had it been die-cast metal, then it would have been without flaws. I was lucky enough to purchase this set on sale for $45.99, I think it is worth just that. Any fan of the Heathers film will be pleased with this set.",1228435200,2,911,4.3274853801169595
853449,4,6304361009,"Likely you've already seen this excellent film starring Christian Slater and Winona Ryder. It's a contemporary cult classic and for good reason.

Therefore, I'll give you some info on this limited edition release :

This limited edition comes from Anchor Bay Entertainment and is packaged as a blue metal locker. Inside the locker is a bunch of very cool stuff. First, a cool t-shirt. There are three possible shirts which you might get, but you only get one. Secondly, there are a set of magnets which can be used to decorate the locker. Not outstanding, but kind of neat, none the less. You also get a year-book, featuring info and photos from the film.

What is not made clear though - is that you get your standard wide screen DVD version, you also get a BLU-RAY version of the movie. Look closely at the picture of the back of the packaging. See that there are three discs displayed? One is a Blu-Ray. Yipee!

Oh, and each locker is a numbered limited edition.

Exact Description of Contents : The Limited Edition Locker Set contains: a numbered locker, a 20-page hardcover Heathers yearbook, an 'awesome' T-shirt, 14 locker/fridge magnets, a collectable Westerburg algebra book, the BluRay Disc and two DVDs. Those DVDs will present the film in an anamorphic 1.85:1 transfer with Dolby Digital 5.1 sound and contain the features highlighted above in addition to an original ending screenplay excerpt accessible from DVD-ROM.

This is a great collectible, well worth the price.",1228262400,24,1482,4.908
853450,4,6304361009,"What more can be said about an 80's classic that hasn't been said already? Probably not much. The odds are that most or almost all of those going for the Blu release already own the DVD or remember watching the movie on tape or maybe in a  theater. I will therefore focus on my impressions as an owner of the DVD as I watched the Blu Heathers and asked myself if it was worth buying it.

[To those new to Heathers, my advice is maybe read some movie reviews and if you decide to buy it, go with the Blu, if you have a Blu player.]

So, not sure if this is a statement about 'Heathers' or about the reviewer (that would be me) but, the fact is that I had Heathers as a VHS tape before I had it as a DVD. This Blu 20th anniversary edition is a timely and needed release and it doesn't disappoint.

To make it short, what you get approximately the Blu-enhanced release of the Heathers 20th anniversary DVD. It sounds better, the colors are shaper and more brilliant. I don't believe I noticed to many artifacts and, in some instances, I did have a few 'aha' moments where the Blu resolution enhancements were evident. This being a re-release of a late (very low budget) 80's movie, the quality doesn't approach that of 21st century movie on Blu but my suspicion is that even the original picture had an added and very slight dream-suggesting blur-glow as the story line tends to follow the border between a make-believe reality and a world of dreams and wishes. Or, maybe it was just the cheap film could afford and the fact that all had to be done in a hurry as Heathers was the last movie New World Pictures was going to distribute before going out of business.

Surprisingly, for such an inexpensive port to Blu, this 'Heathers' comes with a VERY useful Blu-specific feature that I don't believe could be implemented on a DVD. The 'Fast Film Facts', when selected, will pop little post-it-like notes during playback, giving us some insights on what's going on behind the scenes, sometimes literally. For example, we learn that One of the Heathers was Christian Slater's real-life girlfriend, that Winona turned 16 while working on Heathers, that Heaters was released in Europe as 'Lethal Attraction', that the movie was done on a $2 million budget and that budgetary constraints were responsible for many shortened scene and for the somewhat botched ending.

In addition, the two featurettes are very much worth watching. They've been done approximately 10 and 20 years after Heathers' debut with the more recent, ""Return to Westerburg High"" featuring interviews with writer Daniel Waters and director Michael Lehmann, apparently shot in HD and the older ""Swatch Dogs and Diet Coke Heads"" sill fresh, informative and entertaining after all these years.

Overall, even though I still have the original DVD version, I am happy to add Heathers to my Blu-ray library and it's not likely that I will ever play the DVD again. For a Blu-ray release, NOT a restoration, this is as good as it gets and the price is right. I hesitated between a 4-star vs. a 5-star rating. And it was the compromised ending that tipped the balance down. Regardless, I will always love this movie and, as teen, dark comedies go, Heathers will always be the frame of reference.",1227744000,14,3248,4.648083623693379

Actually I do; we're a Nation of Laws, aren't we? But my Brother the Lawyer said they witch-hunted her worse than they would have John Q/Jane Doe. Nuts to that Saks store detective Clown called her a ""rich b----""; said  he'd ""make evidence"" against her. She oughta sue the Buffoon Fool no jest! Marisa Tomei's Father the Judge could make him drink muddy water, sleep in a hollow log, and endure the chicken-baking heat of the Libyan Sahara. Then he could be forced to look into Winona Ryder's eyes for one minute. To this end he could be strapped to an immovable chair and eye drops could be periodically  applied to his corneas to keep them from drying out. A surgical device could hold his eyelids open; necessarily compelling him to view whatever was in his line of vision at that moment which in this case would of course be the lacerating glare of Her Hotness. (Stanley Kubrick, as you may know, used this technique to great effect on the main character of A Clockwork Orange. More on Mr. Kubrick later.) Ms. Ryder could also utilize that left foot forward stance some women employ when they decide to let the hammer down. I can hear it now: ""No, noooo! I apologize!""

I went a little overboard just now and I apologize! I think it was S. J. Perlman, though, who said that people who never get carried away should be. Taken in this light it seems perfectly normal for an individual to go Hog Wild over certain movie stars, who seem to be germinated and generated in such a way as to attain and maintain the ultimate level of charisma. (The Dream Machine) They're like bar magnets; the kind you studied in High School science lab- all those iron filings in a pattern. I'm like one of those filings, or like one of thousands of spermatozoa hell-bent for that Pot o' Gold! (Don't laugh, this actually is a pretty good metaphor for the viewer/film industry dynamic. You've got about as much chance of making it with your favorite movie actor or actress as any oversexed MRC* has at scoring with that Queen Bee.)

At a certain point back in the Day; (70's I guess, don't ask me to specify); my friends and I found ourselves navigating a relatively degenerate period in our lives, indulging most of our spare time in just cruising around, drinking beer, getting high, and engaging in sundry other Activities. (Reference ""Time"", Dark Side of the Moon, Pink Floyd.)

We drove mostly American Deathtrap V-8's, continually searching for that Pot o' Gold! There seemed to be two types of speedometers back then: the ones that went up to 100 MPH, or the type; usually found found on V-8's; that topped out at 120. If you were traveling over the maximum indicated speed there was no way to know what velocity you were hauling at.

""How fast were you goin' down that hill?""

""Damn 'fi know; sonofab---- was pegged!""

There was a little peg at the end of the scale, stopping the needle's travel. Just now it occurs to me that no matter how much hyperbole were you to apply; any description of Her Charms would; in a sense be ""pegged"", just like that speedometer. I mean; even if you were to go Hog Wild and refer to W. R. as a STUPEFYINGLY ADORABLE, MOUTHWATERINGLY DESIRABLE, SUPER-HYPNOTIC-CUTE-AS-A-BUTTON-ONE-OF-A-KIND-FILM ENCHANTRESS, it would be like an astronomer referring to the number of known stars in the universe as ""over 120"".

Speaking of the Universe, I recently rediscovered Mr. Kubrick's magnum opus, 2001: A Space Odyssey. I say rediscovered cause the first time I saw it I near fell asleep in the movie theatre. The second time I Got Something out of it. I think it has something to do with Man's quest for [???]. (You figure it out.) After Hal the computer kills off all the astronauts except for Keir Dullea, the Monolith sends him into a stargate or wormhole whose inhuman G-forces deliver him to [???]. (You figure it out.) With regard to the real world, Steven Hawking has said that because of the intolerable amount of gravity involved any astronaut having the misfortune to fall into a black hole would instantly be turned to spaghetti. I wonder if something like that would happen to you if you were to gaze a little too long into the sparkling Spellbinders; the Windows to [???] of the Mesmerizing Miss R. (You've figured it out.)

Some people will be upset that the new edition doesnt offer much in the way of new material. Ok, thats fine, but I lost my old Heathers DVD (or someone borrowed it permanently) and I was going to get a new one anyways. So the release of this turned out to be perfect timing.
The dvd looks and sounds great and there are the nice extra features, though only one that was not on the last release, so I can understand some of the discontent amongst those eagerly waiting for a while new dvd.
A lot of films from the 80's, to me, aren't that good and so when I came across this film it was shockingly good. I almost felt guilty at enjoying it so much because it deals with some very dark subjects and does so in a sometimes serious, sometimes frivolous manner. There is no film quite like it.
To sum up, if you have the old 2001 release, you don't need to get this one, not really. Its mostly the same, but if you don't have it, get this one. It is well worth the price and yeah, I wouldve loved to have seen a really long in depth documentary for the 20th anniversary release, it doesnt detract from the overall quality.

In an age where many DVDs are being re-released with new packaging and no new features, i congratulate Anchor Bay for going one step further. Anchor Bay pulled the same thing last month with Dario Argento's Tenebre and Phenomena by adding approx. 20 minute documentaries to each of them, yet no one seemed to complain. I am also very happy that Anchor Bay decided to use the original poster art instead of the blah and boring individual closeup covers that graced the last release.

Why? Quite simply, it's money. It's much, much cheaper to simply re-release a film with a proven track record than to gamble on the initial DVD release of an (albeit wonderful) 13 year-old film like 'Angus'.

Studios will never halt their process of releasing a title 2x,3x,4x,5x, etc., due to money. Ever heard of Sam Raimi's first film 'The Evil Dead'? How many releases has it had so far on DVD? I think the last count was 666 (???)  A classic teen flick such as 'Heathers' has a fan base of which a certain percentage will buy **every edition* ever issued on DVD.

853618,5,6304361009,"J.D. (Christian Slater), a rebellious student, shows up at Westerberg High, a school dominated by a bitchy clique of girls, all called Heather. With the unwilling assistance of his girlfriend, Veronica (Winona Ryder), J.D. starts murdering the school bullies and making the murders look like suicide, but as one bully vanishes, another just rises up to take its place.

To say that ""Heathers"" is unique would be wrong, as it is essentially a remake of a little known 1970's movie, ""Massacre at Central High"" (although ""Heathers"" is by far the superior film), and I found ""Ginger Snaps"" to be very similar in style and tone (some people have compared ""Mean Girls"" with ""Heathers"", but ""Heathers"" is far darker and make ""Mean Girls"" look like a romantic comedy in comparison). However, there are very few teenage movies that show the dark side of adolescence with this much humour and accuracy. Not that that surprises me. Could you really imagine anyone financing a movie now where the film's protagonist brings a gun to school in order to scare the school jocks?

""Heathers"" is a well written, well directed film, with all of the actors in top form. I am a big fan of Christian Slater and will watch just about anything that he is in, but this is by far my favourite of all of his films. Slater is always at his best when he is playing a character that is not entirely balanced and the character of J.D. is Slater at his most psychotic. ""Heathers"" is one of those rare films where the more times I watch it, the more I love it. As I said before, it is ""different"", so some viewers might not like it at first because of this (the first time I saw it, when I was 14, I didn't really like it).

853621,4,6304361009,"I watched this movie so much when I was a teen that I can't believe I've never plugged it here before now. Coming in at the tail end of the image-obsessed 1980's and skewering the many high school films made in that decade, Heathers casts a Jack Nicholson-esque Christian Slater with a raging and pseudo-self-loathing Winona Ryder (and a pre-Brenda Walsh Shannon Daugherty) in a sick and absolutely delightful tale of homicide and suicide among popularity-seeking social climbers and mainstream rejects at a typical suburban high school. If someone crossed one of Tim Burton's daydreams and John Hughes' nightmares, the result might just look something like this cunning masterpiece set amid the twilight zone of high school cliques. Getting a lot right in its parody of adolescent sub-cultures, teen angst, and the quest for popularity at all costs, Heathers shows us how one semi-accidental killing of a bitchy it-girl by the young, er, lovers, played by Ryder and Slater, sets off a chain reaction that leads to Slater's plan to blow up his school during a pep rally, and thereby hold the entire student body to its unwitting pledge to commit suicide. The brilliant dialogue in Heathers (and if you really don't know how this film got its name, you'll enjoy finding out) reminds me of Dorothy Parker's stinging wit, and there are expressions here (like the one about a chainsaw...) that still stick in my mind to this day, fourteen years after I first saw this old favorite of mine.

Mine involved eggs and not household detergent and guns, but to each his own, or in this case, her own. With ""Heathers"" we follow the misadventures of Veronica (Winona Ryder) as she and her partner in crime Jason Dead (Christian Slater projecting an image of James Dean but whose speech patterns were downright Nicholsonian) take their Scorched Earth policy through an Ohio high school. Early on Veronica tries to fit in with the Heathers, a mean girls type clique that supposedly are the envy of the entire school. Veronica disappoints them at a party and one of the Heathers scolds her for it. The obvious thing for her to do would be to give up the inane dream of being popular, but then we wouldn't have a movie. So instead she decides to wreak havoc on this Heather's life. Of course wreak havoc is putting it lightly as Bonnie and Clyde depend on ""big blue"" to off one of the most popular girls in the school. Since the cover up is ridiculously easy more murders follow, followed by more cover ups. The whole issue of teenage death is brought up. Teachers debate proper tributes which lead to the dead being glorified beyond recognition. Seeing this, the other kids decide that the only way to be hip is to do it in the terminal fashion, thus faux suicides begets failed suicides and chaos rules the day.

Since the film is hardly going to take the side of murdering your classmates Jason goes a little overboard and decides to blow up the entire school. At this point the film switches from satire to thriller and becomes a lot less interesting. The ideas from the first two thirds still hold up. Not to sound genocidal but the people that were offed were simply embarrassments to the human race. Jason even says, oh so honestly, that the only things the school lost with their deaths were ""Date rape and AIDS jokes."" The script by Daniel Waters is the star of the show as its bitter tongue and cynical nature were written in intellectual fashion. The slang does show its age; I hope the last time I heard the word ""motor"" in place of ""hurry"" was 1989. Above all it seems to remind kids of all generations that their puny high school existences don't matter. Yes, I know it seems like it does, it really seemed like it did to me, but it doesn't. If you were to drop dead today your school would just make up colorful lies about you and then benefit from your absence. I also enjoyed the way the film took glee in other peoples misery. Early on the Heaters (who are so aristocratic they play croquet) set their eyes and claws upon an obese girl. The public ridicule she suffers may be heartbreaking for her, but for us it is hilarious. It's not our fault that extreme embarrassment is funny, that's just the way it goes. This film has been compared to ""Mean Girls"" but the main difference is the darkness that runs throughout this one. The main character in that movie is a lost soul who gets involved with the wrong crowd. Here our main character kills without consequence and in the process lands on the top of the social ladder. Sure, she's still a hero, but a dark and flawed one, that's for sure. ***1/2",1166313600,5,3241,4.465430016863406

One accidental (well, sort of accidental) death leads to a series of other deaths, all poking fun at the serious issue, teen suicide. Fall in love with the crazy Veronica and JD as Veronica tries to stop their crazy ways.

Laugh your butt off at the lines used in this cutting edge film. Believe me, you have NEVER heard or seen anything like it. You may even pick up a couple of crazy lines you hear in this movie, I know I sure do. Have fun watching these crazy and bizarre scenes that will make you laugh and say ""Wow"" at the same time.

""Heathers"" is a movie that is ahead of it's time, teenagers can relate to the characters, it pokes fun at serious issues.. but it is 100% hilarious. Loosen up and watch ""Heathers"".",1153526400,2,1481,4.552631578947368

853782,2,6304361009,"Rather than give another general review as others have kindly done,  my review focuses on one aspect of the film, indeed one character, that of Martha.

Martha Dunstock is known throughout the film as Martha Dumptruck. Even the film credits include the nickname `Dumptruck' besides the character's surname (evidently feeling the need to labour the point). Portrayed as unattractive and pathetically grateful for any attention she is given, she unwittingly provides the Slater character with information enabling him to murder a student. Later, when the cult status of the `suicides' (that is, murdered students) becomes apparent, Martha attempts her own suicide by walking into the path of traffic. But her attempt is shown as a failure. At the end of the film Martha is bruised and now disabled, in an electric wheelchair. Ryder's character, having finished her voyage of self-realisation, rejects the school Prom night and instead invites Martha to stay in with a video and popcorn. Martha gratefully accepts and the closing scenes show Ryder walking along the corridor while Martha encircles her like a planet around the sun.

The image of Martha in her wheelchair, an object of pity for Ryder and for the audience, signifies to us fears of being different, of not being beautiful, of not being loved and respected. Martha is the person we are all frightened of becoming. She is given no means of solving her predicament by the film maker. And though some of us in the audience may be fat, or disabled, or both, we may yet still fear Martha, and are invited to consider Ryder's protagonist's journey of self discovery as our own, even is in physical and social reality, we are more like Martha.

For this reason, `Heathers' fails as an exploration of the `Hell' of High School ( a description often used by Buffy/Angel/ Firefly's Joss Whedon). Those in the audience NOT as thin and complying with Western standards of `beauty' as the protagonists (probably the majority of us) ultimately may find the so-called subversion of cruel hierarchy in this film just that little too shallow, leaving a bitter after-taste. The way `fat' people are portrayed in films such as these unfortunately often reflect the predictable, transparent and absurd fixations of the film makers. Sadly this is happening even today - in some ways it has gotten even worse since the Western World decided to wage a 'war on fat' (to quote Paul Campos) - and even at best it is lazy film-making.",1139356800,10,2468,4.954106280193237

Still this movie has achieved cult status and many people, as you can tell from the other reviews, love this movie.  This movie was not for me.",1135296000,5,439,4.317073170731708
853786,5,6304361009,"First, let me say that ""Heathers"" is a fabulous movie.  It ended the 80s teen movie genre.  The writing is witty, and the story and acting are all top notch.  Others have written better on these subjects than I could, so instead I will concentrate on Veronica, the antiheroine of this movie.

""Heathers"" begins with Westerberg's power clique, consisting of Heather Chandler, Heather Duke, Heather McNamera, and Veronica Sawyer.  The Heathers are cruel.  Veronica starts hating her friends and her life.  Heather Chandler, the leader, confirms that Veronica has turned her back on her true friends for power and popularity.  After a fight with Chandler, in which she vows to destroy Veronica's social status, Veronica writes in her diary that she wants Chandler dead.  A few hours later, with the help of J.D., she accomplishes this.  Was picking up the wrong glass truly a mistake?  Consciously, perhaps.  Subconsciously, I feel it was deliberate.  To coverup the crime, Veronica composes a fake suicide note.  In her prayer at Chandler's funeral, she confesses her guilt.

Later, two jock jerks sully Veronica's reputation.  She and J.D. hatch a plan to shoot the jocks with nonlethal bullets and make them appear to be homosexuals.  Once again, did she really believe the bullets were nonlethal?  Regardless, when she finally shoots Kurt, she is very aware that the bullets are lethal, but kills him anyway.

[As an aside, I am an ex-DA.  Veronica's guilt of murder on the first three are all slam dunks.  In each case, even if she did not mean to kill them, she assaulted all three intentionally (including Ram, for she and J.D. attacked Kurt and Ram together).  If you intentionally harm someone and cause his death, you are guilty of murder even if you did not mean to kill that person.  On the other hand, given J.D.'s mother's suicide, sadistic father, and antisocial behavior, it is quite likely he would be found not guilty by reason of insanity.]

Her fourth crime is the attempted murder of J.D.  Of course, it was done for what in her mind was to save the students of the school.  But had she truly wanted to save the school, she would have contacted the authorities.  She could not do that without confessing her other crimes, so she took justice into her own hands.  The added benefit, of course, was eliminating the one person who knew of her other crimes.

So what do we have at the end of the movie?  Four people are dead.  Three were cruel, and one was crazy.  None needed to die, but since they were mean people, Veronica eliminated them.  Her crimes were horrible, but for a greater good in her eyes.  As she said in her prayer, she just wanted a nicer school.  To her credit, she accomplished this.

As the movie ends, Veronica snatches the red bow from Heather Duke and assumes her position as queen of Westerburg.  At the beginning of the movie, we had Chandler as the leader with three friends in her clique.  At the end, it is exactly the same!  Veronica, the former best friend of Chandler, has assumed her place.  Martha, the former best friend of Duke, replaces her.  Betty Finn, former best friend of Veronica, takes Sawyer's place.  And McNamera, who was humiliated due to her own act of contrition, retains her position in Veronica's circle.  At the end, Westerburg is a nicer school, thanks to the many murders of Miss Sawyer.  The ends justify the means, and Veronica Sawyer is truly beyond good and evil.",1131148800,5,3438,4.734797297297297
853787,5,6304361009,"For those who do not respond well to irony and satire, then Heathers is not a film for you. Taking the contemporaneous hysteria over teenage suicide and using it to poke fun at the high school world that more closely resembles reality than John Hughes' films makes for touchy subject matter for those who can't see the irony.

From the invented group ""Big Fun"" who sing the popular song ""Teenage Suicide (Don't Do It)"", to the interior monologues of various teen friends as they stand around the coffin of one of their departed (but once hated) fellow students, suicide is used by the narrative for both humour and social commentary. This is not to say that the film encourages teens to consider ending their lives; instead it promotes other ways in which teens who feel victimised in high school can deal with its horrors.

Winona Ryder and Christian Slater in the leading roles were actually teens when the film was shot, and lend a lot of credibility to the film where other teen films fall down with their twenty- and thirty- something casts. The scriptwriting is phenomenal for a teen movie, and this brilliance has probably not been replicated in this genre since. The DVD also includes a great commentary track noting the original ending which was too controversial for New World Pictures to allow to be produced. You can find the script for the alternate ending in the bonus features as well.

Given that New World Pictures (the only studio willing to give the ""out there"" script a go) went out of business just after the film's release, and the monopoly of the big studios continues, it's unlikely we'll ever see another film quite like it for teens.",1130544000,3,1659,4.73356401384083
853788,5,6304361009,"This was a MOVIE, and that deserves to be in all capital letters.  Before there was Heathers, there was nothing even remotely close to this.  There were movies about high school, to be sure, but they featured nothing but beautiful people in the midst of adolescent crushes and breaking down social taboos.  There was nothing that implied that any of them were anything but vain, none of them were genuinly evil.  But man, these gals were absolutely positivly EVIL.

Chocked full of great quotes (ex. ""What's your damage, Heather?""), hilariously funny scenes which should otherwise be depressing around suicide / murder scenes, and misguided high school mentality, this took the high school experience to a new high and new low.  Veronica, played by Wynona Ryder in her first major break through role, is one of the Heathers.  She wanted to get into the most powerful clique in school, a group of arrogant, evil girls who all the boys want to screw and all the girls might hate but secretly want to be.  She finds that being with them is not all it's cracked up to be.  She's conned into the note trick, going out to parties she otherwise doesn't want to be at, and hanging around with people she otherwise doesn't like.  It's lonely at the top, as they say.  One day she meets a handsome stranger, JD, a young Christian Slater who made girls squeal before he turned into a burned out Hollywood celebrity who does little but skirt chase and get nosebleeds, and is smitten in teen lust for him.  The Heathers don't approve of him, as he's not their type of material, but he wins Veronica over with his bad boy charms and soon the two are an item.  When Veronica accidentally kills the most evil Heather of them all when she serves her a hot cup of liquid Drano, they decide to cover it up with a suicide note.  Soon, teenage suicide takes on a whole new spin.  Suicide victims are glorified, a new Heather rises to the occation, JD goes on a new rampage to rid the world of other social degenerates, and all hell breaks loose.

There is so much genius in a dark comedy like this.  From the subtilies of their slang, the silent prayers of the other kids at the funerals, the attitudes of the teachers, to the other, lesser characters in school, eveyone had something terrible to say about how rotten it is to be a teenager.  And somehow Veronica had heart about her.  She is the snotty popular girl who was accepted in the clique, but she still longs for her more geniune friends (Betty).  What keeps her from going with the really good people and back to the bad ones (the Heathers and JD) is that she's weak.  Like one of the other Heathers, it's easier just to be a follower than to stand up to the stronger ones or shun them completely.

Those teachers with all their academic, elitist yet flake mentalities are a scream.  The cruel and aweful treatment of Martha DumpTruck (way before political correctness told us not to make fun of people with sizest disabilities) make you cry as much as they make you laugh.  I even knew a gal in high school who had the same relationship with her parents that Veronica did with hers which made it all the more funny (""Want some pate?""), and she was one of the clique.  And she was a dingbat.  If she only knew how funny it really was looking back.

This also paved the way for many movies to come.  Take away the 80s fashions and it transends the ages.  Extreme violence movies, modern day toils about high school antics of the popular girls making others' lives bad (ex. Mean Girls), and even the somewhat raunchier sitcoms (ex. Sex In The City) all had roots here in Heathers.  Unfortunately, there are some very dark roots in Heathers, as this was made long before kids were bringing guns to school, detonating bombs, and destroying everyone around them.  Enjoy it for what it is, a fest of evil, self serving meanness.  And it's deep too.

It's so funny now to see this, now that I am so much older and wiser, I see that so many things change as much as they stay the same.  Self centered teenagers with bad attitudes never seem to go away despite what others may or may not think.  High school is still a horrible experience, and it's so funny to see them discovering the same things year after year, thinking they are so original.  In my day it was Lost Boys, today it's Twilight.  There are still parents who want to be their child's friend rather than their parent, still the old passing of notes trick (even though now it's based on texting and IMs) to get dirt on others and use it against them, and there will always be those who think they are so important and so cool when they are going to fall down.  It's all about power and control, not truly being ""popular"".  Because you know what?  Being a cool, popular adult is really a lot of fun and moreso than it was in high school.  And the politically incorrectness of people smoking, violence, and bullying is so un PC now it's unbelievable.",1130198400,2,4943,4.4782122905027935
853789,5,6304361009,"Released in 1989, HEATHERS received sharply mixed reviews.  The film was popular in a few major metro markets, but it proved a box office disappointment overall.  Although many regarded it as a failed take-off on such ""high school angst"" films as THE BREAKFAST CLUB, more than a few critics saw it as a film too much ahead of its time and predicted that it would have more of an impact down the road.  They were right.  When the film began to reach the home market it exploded in popularity, and given such later high school horrors as Columbine today the film seems less take-off than downright prophetic.

It is also one of the most wickedly funny movies to hit the screen since Stanley Kubrik's DR. STRANGELOVE.  The story starts off normally enough: extremely bright, extremely attractive Veronica (Winona Ryder) is a high school junior who has fallen in with the high school clique to end all high school cliques, three young women each named Heather (Kim Walker, Lisanne Falk, and Shannen Doherty.)  The Heathers are pretty, smart, rich... and intent on shoring up their own social positions by crushing every one around them with a degree of vindictiveness that only the teenagers can successfully carry.

When Veronica meets new student J.D. Dean (Christian Slater) her interest in the Heathers begins to wane and they turn on her.  J.D. has his own plan to help Veronica get even.  It involves a cup of Liquid Drano--and before Veronica can think she finds herself making a murder look like suicide.  The result is, as Veronica puts it, teen-age angst with a body count, and quite suddenly suicide seems the ""in thing"" at Westerberg High.

If you recall high school fondly, you were probably one of the popular kids.  For the rest of us, HEATHERS is so accurate that it will make you wince in its portrait of unthinking cruelty: the meanness of the up-scale cliques and brainless jocks, the ridiculed good kids, the savage assaults on the unpopular ones.  it is bitter, bitter stuff.

It is also extremely funny.  Much of this is due to a truly brilliant script by Daniel Waters, who recognizes that teens rarely speak to adults in the same way that they speak to each other--and he not only brings forth the casually used profanity, he essentially creates a truly believable and hilariously funny mode of slang that characterizes the ""in crowd.""  And Waters' plot is even more disconcerting and outrageously funny as it runs, with unexpected logic, to a truly deadly conclusion.

The performances are knockouts.  Ryder has given quite a few memorable performances, but she has never been more remarkable than she is here as Veronica, the good girl turned unintentional killer; Christian Slater has never topped the performance he gives here as J.D.  The ""Heathers"" are perfectly, flawless cast, as is every one from the weary principal to Veronica's vacuous parents.  As for direction, Michael Lehmann moves the film at a rapid clip, hitting more high points than you can imagine.  Indeed, everything about the film is first-rate.

The DVD package is very nice, including an interesting audio commentary, an interesting documentary featuring interviews with director, writer, and major cast members (Kim Walker, who died in 2001, sadly excepted), and a script of the ending as originally planned by writer Waters.  I recommend the film as a ""must have""--but a word of warning.  If you were one of the very popular during your high school years, you won't find it in the least enjoyable.  Yes: that's really how the rest of us saw you.

In every way this movie is terrible - script, cast, directing, editing, soundtrack. It is offensive, poorly acted, stupid and Christian Slater is ungodly bad (does Amazon let you swear, because f---ing piece of s--- is the more appropriate title of this film). If you buy this movie, you are just plain stupid. Sorry, but it is that bad. And I don't feel like I will ever have to defend my rating - if you trust the people on Amazon that have given this flick (dump) 4-5 stars, that's your own fault. Don't say I didn't warn you. And if you do like the film, I can send you a movie of my dog taking a c--- for $3 instead.

853791,5,6304361009,"The Heathers are the darlings of Westerburg High, the ""in"" girls who hang out with the jocks, garnering the envy of all. But these ultra-snobby girls do what most 80's teens do, drink, party and make the oddballs feel bad. Veronica Sawyer (Winona Ryder) is on the edge of the group, drawn to their cool chic but turned off by their childish and mean-spirited pranks. When Veronica finds herself attracted to Jason Dean (Christian Slater), bad things happen: the lead Heather ""commits"" suicide, two jocks kill each other in a parody of gay bashing. But JD, the misfit personified, has even bigger plans for Veronica and himself. Overcome with self-disgust for assisting in JD's murderous machinations, Veronica turns on him and they do battle.

This movie was immediately successful but has enjoyed more popularity as a cult classic, but its post-Columbine humor pales a bit in the light of events. There is also rampant homophobia, which may have been funny pre-AIDS, but also loses its edge with a quick reality check. On the upside, Ryder is at her sneering and mocking best, especially when teamed up with Christian Slater, who channels Jack Nicholson throughout. The costumes are equally over-the-top, giving the piece a very period look, although Slater's ubiquitous black trench coat is a bit jarring (again Columbine). Viewed in the perspective of the times, Heathers is a sharply tuned satire on teenaged class-consciousness. It is almost eerie to consider the cheerful cynicism of 1989, when the film was released. To remain a cult classic it is necessary to ignore the blatant disregard of gays and escalating school violence. Heathers is an example of the good old days, before the world got more complicated and attitudes more sensitive. If nothing else, this film clarifies what we've known all along: Shannon Doherty really is a Heather. Luan Gaines/2005.",1127174400,4,1869,5.087947882736156
853891,5,6304361009,"After I finished watching Heathers for the first time, I couldn't help but look over my body to make sure that I wasn't bleeding from any cuts.  This was literally the sharpest written film that I have ever experienced arriving from the 1980s.  From the dialogue to the story to the underlying symbolism that hits you right in the face, it is hard to believe that this film isn't on the top list of everyone out there.  It reminded me of the first time that I watched Fight Club.  The darkness surrounding Tyler Durden was nearly the same as what followed Slater around as he forced Ryder into these situations.  In fact, the similarities between the two films are outstanding.  I would love to take these two movies and watch them back to back to see what else could be connected.  For those that liken Heathers to Mean Girls, I would say ""yes"", but Fight Club has more relevance.  Even the film The Suicide Club seemed to ooze a bit of Heathers the first time I watched it.  Either way, this movie stands out above anything else that I have witnessed.  The dark characters, the lines spoken by the actors and the story just seeped ""cult classic"" and should be watched by everyone interested in film.

I have to applaud the actors in this film.  I realize that this was one of Christian Slater's first films and he was phenomenal.  The speeches that he delivered spoke to me and really defined him as a better actor than what he eventually became.  Ryder was exceptional as well.  The chemistry that these two had together should go down in film books as one of the quirkiest romances Hollywood has ever contrived.  Their ability to make us believe in their plight as well feel their frustration and anguish is tough to find in today's Hollywood.  Combined with some great performances by (gasp...should I say it?) Shannon Doherty, Lisanne Falk, and Kim Walker as the three ""Heathers"", you cannot help but find yourself lost in these rich, devoted characters.  While the story carries itself, these actors brought the words of the screenplay to life.  They spoke of more than just high school drama, but instead the status of our society and the absurdity of suicide.  They changed themes, destroyed stagnant decisions, and opened the door to so many possibilities, both dark and comical, that I am shocked that more isn't explored with this film.  If I were to grab three films about our society to show to a race of aliens, I would take Fight Club, The Suicide Club, and Heathers.  These are the films that are not afraid to speak the truth about our world.

I need to go ahead and say ""WOW"" to the story.  Not just ""WOW"" in a state of shock, but also a ""WOW"" in the style of excitement.  I did not see this film coming.  I knew that it had been promoted as this ""dark comedy"", but I have seen plenty of those and was concerned that it just wouldn't hit the buttons that it needed to.  Again, and I love to say this, but I was wrong.  Daniel Waters dove deep into the world of High School and exposed some of the darkest corners that other Hollywood films were afraid to touch.  Even Mean Girls never quite hit the buttons that it should have.  This movie talked about sex, parties, drugs, clicks, and the harshness of being an outcast.  It did this in such a ""real"" way that you could not't help but think back to your own High School days while watching this movie.  The language is so intense that after you watch it for the first time, certain quotes are just imbedded in your mind.  What other film can you say creates that impression?  I know of only a handful that I walked away from still quoting the movie.  Heathers is a success and should never be ignored.

Finally, I would like to give credit to director Michael Lehmann for exposing such a brutal topic and not going too commercial with it.  There were some moments where you could tell that there was a Hollywood path that Lehmann could have followed and made viewers probably happier, but instead he completely turned and went a new direction.  There were scenes that I was shocked to see, like the scene in the bathroom with Heather and her pills, because it was as if Lehmann was creating more than just a story, but an entire world.  His attention to detail and obvious hand on the pulse of the young adult world was obvious in this film.  Lehmann successfully created a lasting dark comedy that is both thought provoking and exciting at the same time.  I would even go so far as to say that this might have been the best movie to come out of the 80s, but I don't want to jump too soon ... but it is close.

Overall, I suggest Heathers to everyone and anyone.  I also suggest skipping any version that comes on television and go straight to getting it on DVD.  The R-rating gives you the full effect of this film, while I think anything less would diminish the quality of this Grade ""A"" work.  For those that passionately loved Fight Club and want to see the issues expressed in that film on a high school level, than this is the film for you!  Amazing from beginning to end with some of the greatest quotes any singular film has created!  I cannot wait to watch this film again ... and again ... and again ... and again ... and again!

853893,2,6304361009,"I first saw 'Heathers' when I was sixteen years old, and it spoke directly to my nihilistic and careless malaise that's at the heart of any good period of teen angst. I loved it.

Now, some years later, I've come back to it with nothing but the fondest of memories, and I find that while it's still the same movie, it hasn't aged at all well.

The basic plot premise consists of Bored Popular Girl (Winona Ryder) meets Edgy Ne'er-Do-Well (Christian Slater) and begins to inadvertently act out her rebellious fantasies of murdering those who cross her. If you could cross 'Degrassi Junior High' with 'Bowling for Columbine' you'd have sort of an idea of what I mean.

The movie is laden with self-conscious performances from its leads, and the supporting cast is a blacker-minded sort of stock eighties teen, but homogenous nonetheless. It's difficult to watch Slater shamelessly plaigarise Jack Nicholson (in that it's not a particularly good impression, nor is it a likeable one), and Winona Ryder does try her best, but she's just not very convincing as a Murderess. It's sort of like watching an Olsen twin trying Shakespeare, but not as literate.

Direction is similarly overstated, it's a post-Molly Ringwald excessiveness that strips away creative ambiguity and spells everything out for the audience - except when the plot devices (Ich Luge bullets and Beaker mix-ups) are so blatantly hokey, this works against the movie, in that we end up wondering how Veronica could have been so stupid in the first place.

But maybe that's not the point - maybe Slater's speech about how her subconscious really wanted to commit murder is the whole point of the story. If that's the case, however, the unsuredness and inexperience of the two leading actors makes for performances with zero depth or subtlety - in short, one-dimensional characters trying (and failing) to give their collective raison d'etre some hidden depths.

It's not all bad news, though. Some of the scenes are amusing to watch (particularly the Homosexual Artifacts one, a curious and almost quaint look back at how attitudes have since changed) and some of the pranks played by the Heathers themselves are still blacker-than-pitch (poor Martha Dumptruck!). All in all, though, 'Heathers' is a movie that hasn't aged well. Be prepared to make major allowances for time and talent if ou choose to watch it again!",1120867200,16,2378,4.9773299748110835

Brilliant acting from Winona Ryder and Christian Slater captured the angst of the outsider and the unhappy insider of the popular cliques in a large high  school setting. This movie also attacks divorce and its effect on the kid, and the remorse that comes with doing something irreperable to someone else. Witty writing and real characters made this film one of my favorites. With many Literary references from Charlottes Web to Huck Fin. Its a brilliant well thought out film.

853895,5,6304361009,"who would of thought that a movie dealing with the issue involving teen anxiety would turn out to be actually decent? i sure didn't but after seeing this movie not only was a forced to admit some movies can be good even if the theme is stupid, i actually ended up loving how they protrayed the theme in this movie!

for a movie origionally released in 1989, its kind of interesting and disturbing to see Christian Slater's character wear a black trench coat and go around shooting other kids, but there is so much more to this movie than just murder and violence.

this movie is categorized as a dark comedy, but there are some very heart touching moments of seriousness that really stand out to the viewer. All the stereotypes that are given to highschool cliques of various sorts (cheerleaders, jocks, stoners, etc..) are incorporated in a way that not only makes it look funny, but makes us realize how shallow we all were in high school. then there are examples of how parents can be very ignorant and apathetic towards their kids, as seen with christian slater's dad and both of wynona rider's parents. and also we get to see examples of irony and the sickness of human nature when the person's reputation is at stake, like when the girl's were going out with the jocks on a cow tipping run only because rider's 'friend' needed to have a double date with the jocks, and when rider and the first Heather go to the frat party even though rider doesn't want to go and ends up having a horrible time.

but by far the best part of the movie is the last (at least) 1/3 of the movie, the plot is on a very fast track with no intent on stopping, it is full of many interesting twists and turns until it comes to the very end. The ending to this movie is probobly the best ending ive ever seen for a movie (at least it is off the top of my head right now anyway) and really presents to the viewer the futility of all our stupid barriers we set up against other people just because they're not cool and are different, and we also see what happens when these actions take their toles on the unfortunate people that are cast out.

id consider this a timeless classic that should get more recognition, expecially with all the stupid new teen movies like Euro trip. what we have to keep in mind though is, even though this is supposed to be a comedy (dark comedy, but still...) there are many people out in the world that embody the traits of these characters, and this alone should make us sad.",1115596800,3,2486,4.386117136659436

853897,5,6304361009,"'Heathers' is one of those movies that could probably not be made in this current day of age; most likely being deemed to insensitive or too dark. To an extent this was also the case in 1988, but thankfully near-bankrupt New World Entertainment decided to stick their necks out and do the piece. Revolving around the high school popularity and the inherent cliques that come from it, to murder and teenage suicide, 'Heathers' is undeniably one of the best dark comedy/teen movie ever made.

'Heathers' tells the story of a power and callous clique of `Heathers,' and the entry of Veronica Sawyer (Winona Ryder) into this group. We get an ultra-satiric glimpse of high school (set in the 1980s); from the geeks to the jocks, along with the war like activities high school students unleash on each other... here, to the ultimate of extents. After Veronica begins to despise her supposed friends, she meets up with Jason Dean, played by the young ""Jack Nicholson-esque"" Christian Slater, whom helps to escalate this hatred for the Heathers (and some others... ). As the body count begins to rise Veronica tries to break free from her and J.D.'s doings; dark comedy and great satire flow like water.

'Heathers' is one of those cult classics that one will either love or walk away sickened and disturbed wondering what the hell the writers and producers were thinking. I am of the first group of course. If you just look at 'Heathers' on the surface, and do not try to look any deeper into the underlying meaning, then you have missed the point. If you haven't seen it yet, you really should; it's an 1980s classic and shouldn't be missed.",1104192000,4,1635,4.753521126760563

853899,4,6304361009,"This has to be one of the better high school movies that Hollywood has churned out over the years. And the fact it features a really young Christian Slater doesn't hurt either!

There should definitely be a special edition out there of this movie, whether Winona/Christian want to forget they ever did it or what, but this has to be a cult classic. There should be at least something about Kim Walker, who played the truly great Heather Chandler, having died from cancer in March 2001, at the tender age of 31. She almost stole the show away from Winona & Christian, with such memorable lines as: ""No, Heather, it's Heather's turn. Heather?"", ""You were nothing before you met me. You were playing Barbies with Betty Finn. You were a Bluebird. You were a Brownie. You were a Girl Scout Cookie"", ""F*** me gently with a chainsaw. Do I look like Mother Theresa to you?"", ""Did you have a brain tumor for breakfast or something?"", and the greatest one of all ""You're such a pillowcase"".

This was amazingly filmed in 32 days, yet it doesn't show in the film. You'd think it would, considering it was so speedily filmed, but it's a true classic.

The only problem I have with this movie is the ending. I've been watching this film for years, and I still never really like the ending. It seems like it's just been tagged on at the end, and utterly pointless. The original screenplay had a different ending in which Veronica kills J.D. by shooting him and then straps the bomb to herself. It is implied that the school is destroyed and the last scene is an eerie prom sequence where all those murdered are alive and happy. This was intended to be shot but the studio thought it was too dark and opted for a lighter ending. That sounds loads better to me, but it doesn't seem to imply that it was filmed or anything.

It's been over 10 years now since the film was made, so I'll patiently wait for a 20th/25th anniversary edition - that's ages away! It would be nice, for all the stars, apart from Kim Walker, to look back on the film. And considering how much hair Christian's lost now :) If you haven't seen this, grab a copy any which way you can. You'll thank me later.",1097539200,2,2163,4.44080604534005
854057,5,6304361009,"This dark comedy is laced with satire, humor, and wit, much like many of my favorite novels.  Winona Ryder and Christian Slater make the ideal duo - until she realizes she needs ""cool guys like him out of her life.""
Winona, here as Veronica Sawyer, was formerly the best gal pal of dorky yet insanely innocent and kind Betty Finn (both character names are derived from the Archie comic strip).  Now, she's taken it up with three girls by the name of Heather.  Duke and Chandler may or may not be genuinely evil, while McNamara is just plain pathetically insecure.  The thing is, Veronica hates her new so-called friends.  It's just their ""job to be popular and s***,"" that's all.
Christian Slater, to my utter dismay, seems to have disappeared off the face of the earth since this booming debut.  Here, his performance mimicks that of witty and humorous Jack Nicolson.
""Greetings and salutations."" :)
J.D. and Veronica make the ideal couple.  Both are witty, bright, and loathe the existence of the high school world.  Only J.D. is insanely violent as well, and his actions are bringing about vast repercussions for not only himself, but for Veronica as well.  And Veronica is beginning to wise up and realize that J.D., despite his charms and wit, isn't worth all his trouble(s) and excess baggage.  Besides, he's got an unhealthy fascination with guns.
After the demise of the leading Heather - their doing through liquid bleach - a second Heather takes her place as leader, even more aggressive and bratty than her predecessor.
Veronica ponders what to do over old and new friendships and accidental deaths in her diary.  She and hunky J.D. manage to kill a Heather and two dim-witted jocks but escape suspicion for murder because they leave behind suicide notes.  Veronica can perfectly imitate handwriting styles, as we find out during the first 5 minutes of the film when the three Heathers coerce her into writing a love note to high school outcast Martha ""Dumptruck"" Dunstock and signing a popular jock's signature to it.  She approaches him at his lunch table and uproarious laughter ensues.
Teenage suicide seems to be all the rage in the world of Westerburg High, despite the popularity of fictional band Big Fun's hit single, ""Teenage Suicide (Don't Do It).""  Even though Veronica has left J.D. behind, he still has conjured up his own evil plans concerning the future of Westerburg.  And the Heather in control is abusing her privileges - Veronica knows she wants out.
HEATHERS is so much more than a screwball comedy.  Since its release, no other film has managed to live up to the same wit and dark humor and charm found throughout, making this film a genuine benchmark in the history of movies - and the 80s, for that matter.  HEATHERS takes one glimpse at the work of ultra-cool 80s director/writer John Hughes and laughs in his face, making his Molly Ringwald flicks look like garbage in comparison.
Could this be why Winona is still alive in Hollywood and Molly is not?

If you're looking for the sugary sweetness of those happy endings - Heathers isn't for you. There are no scenes that are going to make you overly nostalgic for being a teen in this dark comedy.
The 3 Heathers rule the school of Westerburg High and Heather Chandler (#1) is the dominant red wearing queen. Veronica Sawyer (Ryder) her best friend is dressed mainly in blue - for truth? She is our perspective for the most part and her diary entries (where she pours out all her true feelings) are perfect. Heather Duke - dressed in green for envy of Heather Chandler's power. And Heather MacNamara dressed in yellow for her fear of - everything. They walk the halls of Westerburg secure in their popularity and the fear the instill in their peers.
Enter Jason Dean (Slater) the ""black horse in the running"". He attracts Veronica mainly because he's an outsider too cool for anyone else and she's sick of the Heathers. He is seen in black for a very good reason. He is ultimately the protagonist for the killings (which are all too believable)
The movie is great, showing without remorse the absolute solitude that HS can be. The stereotypes, while exaggerated are suspiciously close to the truth. Arrogent teachers, clueless parents, heartless peers...  Ahhh High School.
Heathers is also has great quotes. BVS is the only other thing I can think of that perfected it's own slang so well. It makes the movie timeless.
""F*** me gently with a chainsaw. Do I look like mother Theresa?"" - Heather C.
""I just killed my bestfriend."" - Veronica ""And your worst enemy."" - JD ""Same difference."" - Veronica

As some reviewers lament, be prepared for parts that are dark and disturbing, but the film is also hilarious for the most part, and whatever your emotional reaction, the dialogue is never off-target. In fact the film's script and visual style are so clever that laughing at murder does not seem much of a guilty pleasure.
For all the talk of suicide, the underlying theme couches a universal and heartening meaning: that all people are created equal, the ""in crowd"" as well as the nerds.

The one difference between Westburg High & my high school is nobody was killing the popular kids off. Christian Slater plays Jason Dean (JD)  a sociopath new kid in school who is fed up with cliques and the everday sheep students trying to fit in with the cool kids. Winona Ryder plays Veronica an individual but hangs with the Heathers to make life in HS easier. She  notices JD's individuality and they start dating. Everythings is great until he wants to kill off the  Heather girls & popular students. So he manipulates Veronica to help him kill off her simple minded friends & make it look like suicides.  At first she is repulsed but can't stand her friends so she gives in. If you look deeper into this film beyond the quirky comedy the message is scary the desensitized unemotional oblivious parents, the quirky teacher who still wants to be a student, the song ""teenage suicide don't do it"" set to a pop upbeat melody. It really reflects high school a bit exaggerated but still relatable. A very dark film about the lengths kids will go to fit in and be liked. One kids twisted view of how the world should be.  The ending is great the little speech Christian Slater gives to Wynona Ryder after attempting to blow up the school listen to it  makes you think about what he says long after viewing the film.

854061,3,6304361009,"You know how there used to be half a dozen Jennifers in every high school class?  Well, what we have here are three Heathers (last names: Duke, Chandler and McNamara, if anybody cares) who reign as upper crust sosh queens at Westerberg High, home of the Rottweilers.  One of the Heather Rottweilers is Shannen Doherty of TV infamy who seems perfectly cast except for the fact that if she's still in high school, I can play opposite Barbie Doll.
Trying to work her way into their circle is a one-time study-freak with a talent for forging handwriting named Veronica (would that we had Archie and Jughead as well).  I mention her penmanship because it's part of the plot, although why they bothered with the fancy foreshadowing I don't know since most of the story is beside the point anyway.
This is a black comedy that takes off on the usual high school teen angst cliches: suicide, rigid social stratification, dumb jocks, dumb parents, dumb administrators, and even dumber teachers.  And there are some very funny bits to be had along the way.  Unfortunately playing Veronica is Winona Ryder who, although she is as pretty as pretty can be, even sporting a monocle--yes, somebody must have pointed out to director Michael Lehmann that putting nerd-girl glasses on a pretty girl has been done to death, so he had an Inspiration.  Ryder has moments--some of them unintentional--but there is no way she can be seen as a comedic actress.  We really needed Rene Zellweger or Reese Witherspoon.
Playing opposite Ryder with some finesse is Christian Slater as J.D. Dean, teen psycho, son of Psycho Dad, who explains that he is blowing up the school ""because nobody loves me.""  What really cracked me up about Christian Slater is that ""Columbo"" voice he sometimes uses.  And what I found funny about Winona Ryder were all those outfits with the cutesy hats and leggings.  If only they had let her keep them she might have missed her day in court.
Best bit: the two jocks getting their just deserts and the two cops ""investigating"" the scene.
So bad it was almost good: Veronica getting her cigarette lit by a dynamite explosion.
Like, this could happen: Veronica and Martha ""Dumptruck"" Dunnstock doing popcorn and old movies together on prom night.
I want to see her do it again, slowly: the Rottweiler cheerleader doing a twirling handstand.

854062,4,6304361009,"It's hard to believe that Christian Slater's breakout role as Jason ""J.D."" Dean in Heathers was almost 15 years ago. It's also amazing how well he pulled off his take on Jack Nicholson and psycho characters. Of course, when you look around, Christian Slater has all but fallen off the face of the earth. I haven't seen him since his two-minute cameo as a Starfleet officer reporting to George Takei's Captain Sulu in Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country, and that was in the early 90's. I can't remember if Murder in the First was before or after that little spot.
As to the movie itself, it definitely falls under the category of cult classic. Very 80's, very much a cross between social commentary and satire about that commentary with plenty of comedy and surrealism thrown in for good measure. An interesting feature from the DVD of Heathers is a screenplay of the original ending where Winona Ryder's Veronica kills J.D. in the boiler room, then takes his bomb and blows herself up outside the school. The original ending finishes with what seems like a dream-like school prom where all the cliques of the school break out of their molds and dance and mingle with each other. This includes all the characters who died during the movie. Apparently, the powers that be felt this ending would have been too dark for the teen audience of the time. I'd actually have to agree, although it would have fit in with the strangeness of the movie in general.

It was and remained a favorite of mine for the ensuing decade.  With a cadre of young unknowns, some of which would go on to better things, like shoplifting or partying with Heidi Fleiss; its hip wit and catch phrases pushed it quickly into cult status.  Veronica wearies of her existence as fourth wheel in the powerful Ohio HS clique of girls named Heather, each color coded for easy identification.  Christian Slater arrives snarling/preening in his Jack Nicholson way, and Veronica latches on.  Together they wage a quiet, if effective war on the status quo, tilting it in directions they hadn't imagined via murder/suicides.  There are moments of picturesque beauty; the opening scene in slow motion as the Heathers laugh, talk, and move forward w/ their croquet mallets to the tune of Que Sera Sera, only to crush the flora beneath their feet.  Over the years, the movie's message delivery mechanism has become much more somber, owing in no small part to the cretinous real life actions of Gen-Y murder-spree kiddies.  Back in the 80's JD's antics were inconceivable and suggested a dark and troubled, but fantasy world-view.  However, today, the reality is almost par for the course.

What other reviewers seem not to have touched upon are numerous undercurrents in the film: The ""Teenage Suicide: Don't Do It"" pop song echoes the equally banal and insightless 80s propagranda line of ""Just Say No to Drugs""; the gulf between parents and their teenage children is portrayed in brilliant carricature; after rejecting the popularity culture of which the Heathers are the school's representatives, Winona Ryder's Veronica instead follows Christian Slater's J.D. into a darkly comedic series of murders of all the popular players in school, each murder creatively staged to look like suicides. Nobody seems to question these ""suicides."" And that pop song keeps on going, as if it were all the answer and all the solution.
When J.D.'s destructive designs escalate to pretend that the entire school committed a collective suicide, Veronica breaks away from him and in an unforgettable ""mexican standoff"" she challenges him to back down. But instead of lighting her cigarette he goes through with the remainder of his plan (though the school is saved). She is then free at last to assert her own values and make friends with whom she chooses, rather than by succumbing to peer pressure.

But other then that, the movie is terrific.
The plot is:
There are three girls name Heather; Heather Chandler (Kim Walker), Heather McNamara (Lisanne Falk), and Heather Duke (Shannen Doherty), joining them is Veronica Sawyer (Winona Ryder). Winona meets a new guy at school named J.D. (Christian Slater). He tricks Veronica into killing some students at school, and making it look like a suicide.
The movie is well written,, acted, and directed perfectly.
For those of you who think Jawbreaker ripped off Heathers, what the hell are you thinking? Heathers and Jawbreaker are two completely different movies. I noticed a couple lines that were similar, but that movies are different.
Rent this movie, it's great!

854295,5,6304361009,"For a lot of teenagers, popularity takes precedence over high SAT scores or early admission into an Ivy.  It's literally viewed as a matter of life or death, and no film brings that truth to life as vividly as ""Heathers.""  Winona Ryder is Veronica, who (along with Heather Duke, Heather McNamara, and Heather Chandler) belongs to Westerburg High School's most elite and coveted clique.  These four young women supposedly epitomize the essence of cool, and earning their stamp of approval is as prestigious as getting knighted by Her Majesty.  But things get nasty when Veronica violently clashes with one of the Heathers, and shortly thereafter the clique slowly collapses under its own weight.  Of course, there's much more to the film's plot, which is a brilliant satire on high school, the firece competition to be popular and well-liked, and the faculty's inability to connect with their students.  Pregnant with one-liners and armed with a Ginsu-sharp script, ""Heathers"" is a pitch-perfect comedy that's wickedly funny.  The best performances definitely belong to Ryder and then-unknown Shannen Doherty.  Those who rolled their eyes at the ""happily-ever-after"" sentiment of ""Sixteen Candles"" have bonded with this film over the years, turing it into a small scale classic.  ""Heathers"" didn't exactly set the box office on fire upon release in 1989, but it's definitely grown in popularity since then.

The sight of Ram, the jock, in his casket with his football helmet on while his dad says, ""I love my dead, gay son"" always throws me into a laughing fit.  ""The Simpsons"" would probably do something like that if they ever made a full length movie.  Like others have stated, the quotables in this movie will stay with you forever.

This is one of my favorite black comedies, ever. The acting is excellent, as well as the sharp dialogue. Though not all high schools are made up of kids this cut-throat, it is still a good portrayal of teen angst taken to the extreme. Years later, Jawbreaker was made in an attempt to recapture the brilliance of Heathers. It was a formidable task, and Jawbreaker couldn't compare. In fact, it was hardly even worth watching.

Producer Andrea DeNova is the amiable voice of fandom as she defends the movie against director Michael Lehmann's and especially screenwriter Dan Waters' acerbic wit.

854302,5,6304361009,"The story of two non-geeks who are sick of the pretentious ""in"" crowd's thoughtless, tormenting ways towards outsiders, Heathers is a darkly comedic vision of revenge and regrets.  Winona Ryder plays Veronica, the fourth in the most popular group of girls in school, the other three all named.. Heather.  She meets J.D. (Christian Slater's angst-y, eventually psychotic portrayal of a loner going to the same school), who is a refreshing drink of apathy to her dehydration from cliques.  From there, they join forces in overcoming stereotypes and unintentionally creating new ones as they ""accidentally"" kill the most popular Heather and make it look like a suicide.  As J.D. has a hard time hiding his urges to continue doing the same thing to other popular students, Veronica begins to question his sanity, as well as her own.
Ryder plays an excellent basketcase of a character, who knows deep down what is right (following your instincts and doing what you want to do, not what your friends want you to do), but has a hard time deciding whether or not to be her own person or just go along with the Heathers.  Although Slater can, at times throughout this movie, get a bit annoying (Jack Nicholson, anyone?), but in such a way that you have a hard time deciphering whether it's just part of the character, or his acting ability (or lack thereof).  Shannen Doherty also plays a wonderful snob in what ultimately turns out to be one of the best dark comedies of the 80's.. the type of movie that is often poorly imitated but never duplicated.
Highly recommended, especially if you went to school (any grade, anytime) during the 80's.  Even if the storyline doesn't pique your interest, off the wall humor and loads of sarcasm and cynicism will make this an enjoyable movie for you.",1026604800,3,1782,4.803921568627451

He's a dead-on ringer for Jack Nicholson (too bad Slater seems to have fizzled away), and he and Wynona Ryder sparkle on screen.

""Heathers"" came out in 1989, and I was 20 years old then.  Even though I was technically out of my teen years, I totally could appreciate this movie as it had some of the wittiest and most original dialogue ever to come out of any movie, especially a movie of the ""teen"" genre.
Not only is the screenplay the bomb, but the acting is superb.
Winona Ryder and Christian Slater have an amazing chemistry together, and they both truly carry this movie.
This is deemed to be one of the true classic movies of all time, in my honest opinion, even now, 12 years later and I am now in my 30's, I still love love love this movie!!!!
I just bought the dvd, and watched the film with the running audio commentary from the writer,(You rock, Daniel Waters! I'd love to see you write Heathers 2, just as Winona has been asking), the director,Michael Lehmann, and the very cheery producer, Denise Di novi.
It gives you real insight into the making of the film watching it this way. I didn't realize it had been made on such a small budget.
The movie itself is a great hour and a half of film.  Like i said, it has some of the best dialogue to ever spring from the lips of actors.  It's fairly intelligent, and I think people of all different age groups can appreciate the humour, the story, and the message that the story conveys.
If anyone knows where to find the screenplay for this movie, I'd love to hear from you.  I've been looking for it on line, and have had no luck thus far.
This is definitely worth buying for those die hard fans of this film.  Their are some extras on it such as the 30 minute ""swatch dogs and diet coke heads"", and the original ending of the screenplay, only in writing, it was never ok'd to be filmed.

No subject goes too far for Heathers - suicide, murder, eating disorders, sex, whatever.  It take equal aim at all of these, as well as people, our educational system, and many aspects of society.  It does so in such a viscious and in-your-face way that it is impossible not to look on, even if in a rubber-necking at a car accident way.
Very early in the film, we are treated to a scene that is thematic of the experience.  Christian Slater, in the role that cemented his comparisons as a ""Little Jack Nicholson"", is sitting in the cafeteria getting harrassed by two jocks from the same school.  Instead of fretting, he calmly raises a large firearm and fires two shots directly at their faces.  Blanks, of course, but Jason Dean (his character) gets more viscious very quickly.

And, it can't be avoided.  This is the trenchcoat mafia in the movies.  It's such a good film, such an amazingly good film, and yet its legacy is pretty undeniably Columbine.  Destruction for its own sake.  The joke isn't, alas, as funny as it was.",979603200,2,556,4.670103092783505
854532,5,6304361009,"""Heathers"" is simply the funniest movie ever made. That is, if you're like me & find a scene of a girl lighting a cigarette off a guys smoldering arm (he had just burned it with a cigarette lighter to impress her) to be absolutely roll-on-the-floor hysterically funny. If however, you just read the sentence above & think I'm extremely sick, then you probably should skip ""Heathers"". Just keep in mind that you'll be missing the best performances of Winona Ryder's & Christian Slater's careers (thus far) & the only good performance by Shannon Doherty (as the last surviving Heather). Truly a classic moment in cinema!",977270400,2,618,4.895238095238096

This movie is great, the lingo is hilarious (""what's your damage,"" or, my personal favorite, ""how very"").  But I do think that this movie is a bit over the wall.  Don't watch it expecting it to be right on the money.  For example, the police just accepted the jock's double suicide??  I would have been a little suspetious.

854534,5,6304361009,"First Veronica wants to be in the most powerful clique in High School. But  that's before she realizes what being accepted really means. Her new life  of popularity is so suffocating that she's desperate to escape. And that's  when she meets J.D.
He helps her discover that with the HEATHERS is not  where she really wants to be and after a harmless prank involving liquid  drainer, Veronica's whole life spins out of control. Her new boyfriend is a  cold, careless psychopath who'll stop at nothing to shock the school. She  can't seem to stop the train before it crashes again and suicide is on  everybody's mind.
Shocking and cut-throat black comedy is dead-accurate  (no pun intended), and takes no prisoners. The entire cast turns in killer  performances (once again: no pun intended). The plot twists, turns, and  writhes in every direction and the ending leaves the viewer feeling blown  away (no pun intended X3)! An excellent psychological and social thriller.  See it or you'll miss out on something incredible.",965952000,,1021,4.970414201183432
854535,5,6304361009,"Imagine a school free of homophobic jocks, ...cliques, and snobs? It might seem like a dream come true, but in reality it is an idea that seems too far fetched. In ""Heathers,"" we get to live the dream in a comedic masterpiece that has become a cult classic.
Veronica (Ryder) is a member of the most popular clique at Westerburg High. The clique consisting of three girls all named Heather, rule the school with fear, and no one dares to rain on their parade, until a dark knight named Jason Dean or J.D. for short (Slater) moves into town. After a miserable social debut at Remington University, Veronica is banished from the clique by Heather No. 1(Lisannne Falk).
The day after, and probably by accident on Veronica's fault (but J.D. knew about it), Heather No. 1 is killed by a cup of liquid drainer and Westerburg is pulled into an emotional outpouring of hypocrisy following the death of Heather No. 1. After the planned murders of the two homophobic football jocks, Veronica realizes that the most hated kids at school have become more popular in death. After breaking up with J.D., Veronica now must stop him from committing the ultimate act of high school social sanitization--blowing up the entire school with kids and all.
Considered by many as being one of her greatest performances, Ryder carries the film with witty, sarcastic language. J.D. is excellent as a Jack Nicholson-esque rebel bent out uniting all social classes in the only place where they are equal, heaven. The late Kim Walker (she passed away in March 2001 of a brain tumor ironically, since one of her famous lines in the film was ""Did you have a brain tumor for breakfast?"") was amazing as the ever-difficult Heather Chandler, leader of the notorious clique.
This film has provided Generation X with probably more catch phrases than any other film in recent history. Phrases like ""...me gently with a chainsaw,"" ""Do I look like Mother Teresa?,"" and ""You're Beautiful,"" have all becomed part of the modern lexicon in America. New terms such as ""Swatch dogs,"" ""Diet Coke-heads,"" and even the name of a character in the movie (""Martha Dumptruck"") have all become popular words in the average Gen-Xer's vocabulary.
Things to look out here are a pre-Beverly Hills, 90210 Shannen Doherty playing Heather no. 3. Veronica's best friend in her pre-Heathers day, played by is Betty Finn (get it? Betty and Veronica, as from the Archie comics) and the school was named in honor Paul Westerburg, the popular musician. By the way, Betty Finn is played by Renee Estevez, sister of both Emilio Estevez and Charlie Sheen...",963705600,,2587,4.855203619909502
854616,5,6304361009,"We all remember those cliques in high school, you know the snobby kids who had it all and made those outside suffer and of course we always wanted in.  Heather's came upon the scene and opened up the doors of dark comedy to a  whole new generation of MTV vidiots. The film is very morbid and the  subject matter is quite shocking but the direction of Michael Lehmann is  well played and the portrayals of the students involved come across most  effectively. This film really does speak out to so many of us who went to  school and felt left out. A film that really does end in a bang!",960076800,,584,4.263636363636364
854617,5,6304361009,"It's one of the most quotable movies of the 80s, but I hadn't seen it  since middle school.  It was listed @ Amazon as one of my film  recommendations so I decided to purchase it; I watched it just the other  night and I had completely forgotten how many phrases from this film had  become part of our high school lingo.  Some gems include, ""F**k me  gently with a chainsaw!"" or ""Did you have a brain tumor for  breakfast?"" or ""Greetings and salutations (with a notable  Christian Slater/Jack Nicholson tone)"" or ""Great pate but I've  gotta motor if I'm going to be on time for that party"" or ""Dad:  Why do I smoke these things [cigarettes]? Veronica: Cuz you're an idiot.  Dad: Oh, yeah.""
The 80s are well represented in the characters'  lingo and dress, but even more so is the underlying theme of stepping on  the little guy to get to the top.  The 80s was certainly a selfish decade  and this film captures that feeling very well with the microcosm of an  American high school.  Just as in life, if you off the top dog another  (probably more vicious) dog is bound to step into place.
Although this  film is 95% funny, the remaining 5% is a powerful, slightly gruesome  message about society.  Enjoy the laughter but don't forget to think.",959904000,2,1243,4.479820627802691
854618,5,6304361009,"I laughed the entire way through the film.  Yes, it did have its serious points, and yes, it DID deliver a meaningful message.  However, it also had some of the most clever, satirical, and darkly funny dialogue of any movie  in the last 20 years.  My favourite running joke is:  (Veronica's Dad)  ""Why do I (smoke, etc.) these (cigars, etc.)?""  (Veronica)  ""Because you're an idiot.""  (Veronica's Dad)  ""Oh,  yeah.""  (Veronica's Mom)  ""You guys.""  (Veronica)  ""Great (pat, etc.).  I've got to motor if I want to make it to that  (funeral, etc.).""Oh, and remember:  If it's a thick blue liquid, DON'T  DRINK IT!  :O)",959212800,,615,4.786407766990291

854623,3,6304361009,"This Digitally Remastered VHS Letterboxed Collector's Edition is a lovely gift. Anchor Bay Entertainment has recently revived some long-lost titles in its library and, thankfully, they have restored the prints to the proper  format. No more EP videocassettes!
I do feel I should clarify,  however, that this VHS edition does NOT have clamshell packaging. Rather,  its front cover opens to juxtaposed messages from scripter Dan Waters and  director Michael Lehmann.
For $13.99, this edition of HEATHERS is quite  the bargain. For starters, it is 100 times more worthy than the DVD format  release. Anchor Bay does well in its VHS territory, but its DVD format  releases are problematic. The special features rarely work and my DVD  player has actually refused its discs before.
What is also nice about  this edition is its inclusion of several theatrical trailers (far too  many!) and promotional interviews with lead actors Winona Ryder and  Christian Slater. Too bad these recorded sessions couldn't have been  digitally remastered; they haven't aged well.
As for a previous  reviewer's joy at the absence of Molly Ringwald in this 1980s black comedy  for the teen set, she is way off the mark. Molly Ringwald was hardly  featured in every '80s teen flick--just the good ones. Just what, exactly,  is she overjoyed at? Christian Slater in a '80s teen pic is supposed to be  a relief? I don't get it. Let us leave Molly's good name untarnished, OK?",945475200,4,1448,5.042194092827004
