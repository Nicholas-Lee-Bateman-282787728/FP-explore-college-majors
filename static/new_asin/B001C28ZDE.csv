3503621,5,B001C28ZDE,"This dvd is well worth watching. The subject matter is dealt with in a nice, down to earth way. The children are real children, with real children's lives. Just that they also happen to have various kinds of psychic abilities. My family and I found these stories fascinating.",1249689600,,275,4.75
3503622,5,B001C28ZDE,"This is a great show I had no idea that children suffered with such things.  I am so sorry that other children treat them so badly, it is only because they are scared an do not understand it is a gift instead of a curse. It is not evil only if the persons chooses for it to be. From this program it shows they are normal children with a gift from God, and weak minded people that will not open themself up to others being different.",1247702400,2,432,4.023255813953488
3503623,5,B001C28ZDE,"I thought this series was interesting and I looked forward to the DVD.  The care and understanding is so positive and helpful to the children involved.  The DVD I received had one flaw, but it may have just been this one disk. I think it was the bonus episode or possibly the last program on the disk, that maybe within the last ten minutes of it, the sound was badly out of sync, not just a second or two, maybe more like a minute.  Makes me think they are rushing these things out as soon as possible and not being very careful of any flaws.  Again, it could just be this one disk, and its not enough of a problem to return it, but it was annoying. I still love the show itself.",1247616000,9,680,4.090225563909774
3503624,5,B001C28ZDE,"As someone who was born psychic I have a deep appreciation for the help the children on these shows are getting from a very qualified and gifted psychic - Chip Coffey. The basic episodes follow the path of introducing you the children who have abilities and are not able to move forward with them or have fears about them or are misunderstood by family and community. An expert in psychology and a professional psychic come in and speak with one of these children then bring them all together in situations to face together as a group. the children face their fears, make new friends(the other children) and come away having a sense of their true selves.

An excellent series that I have recommended over and over to anyone who is interested in psychic mediums or to those who have abilities or children with gifts - and everyone else ;-)",1247270400,26,838,4.624161073825503
3503625,3,B001C28ZDE,"Some of the kids are very psychic, meaning they can sense apparation and messages from another dimension, human and animal spirits, human's aura, supernatural healing ability, premonitions, etc. But some of them just merely victim of the ghost sighting, or simply having creative imagination. But overall, not so many documentary about supernatural can be easily found and made, so any collection in this category should be given credit above than average.",1246233600,3,456,5.436619718309859
3503626,5,B001C28ZDE,"I have watched this program in A&E. One of the ""caring experts"" is the great Chip Coffee (the phychic who appears in almost every episode of Paranormal State). It is very well done, and seems to really help these young kids. It is a very interesting and entertaining program.",1234483200,19,275,4.63265306122449
3503627,5,B001C28ZDE,i had know problem with product it also came in fast and in good shape vary happy.,1229817600,2,82,3.8823529411764706
3503628,5,B001C28ZDE,Love this show I wish it was never canceled.  I would have bought every season.,1431734400,,79,4.266666666666667
3503629,5,B001C28ZDE,I used this as part of research for a fictional character in a novel.  It was a fantastic resource and also a generally well done and educational (not too mention entertaining) series.  Hope seasons 2 and 3 become available.,1426723200,,224,4.717948717948718
3503630,5,B001C28ZDE,"Easily my favorite series. Disappointed that there are only 7 episodes (there were 3 seasons to the whole show, people!!!) though this show brings back a ton of memories. I grew up in a haunted house, and like many of these kids my psychic abilities terrified me. I'm so, so happy that Chip worked with these kids to overcome their fears. Kids are often invalidated and shot down, all the in the name of a snob who is looking to crush some kids' hearts. Chip is an amazing psychic and he really has a lot of confidence, and he shows the kids lots of different devices to confirm their abilities (EMF readers, ghost box, etc) and I'm happy that other psychic kids can learn to manage their abilities just from watching this show. Definitely recommend to anyone with psychic abilities or anyone who is curious about them.",1425168000,,819,4.578231292517007
3503631,3,B001C28ZDE,words and video didn't match up on one of the shows,1418083200,,51,3.727272727272727
3503632,5,B001C28ZDE,These stories shared are truly an inspiration of the gifts kids have and may not understand. They take that and show the kids how to help others with this special gift and teach them not to be afraid of it.,1413331200,,206,4.175
3503633,5,B001C28ZDE,Very informative. I enjoyed watching it. It let's you know what's out there if you don't know. It is a must see.,1399075200,,112,4.136363636363637
3503634,3,B001C28ZDE,These kidas don't see ghost no more then I do but its a ok movie if you like to watch stuff you know that the kids or being told to said before hand,1396396800,,148,3.515151515151515
3503635,2,B001C28ZDE,"Here's what I like - I believe in these kids and their struggles. And 'Chip' and Lisa seem to help them.
What I Don't like - is the photography and sound effects and creepy music.
On one hand - they try to show these kids as fearful - then this show adds stupid sound effects to make it all seem Much creepier - much filmed at night for more creepy (Unnecessary effects).
Then there's the subtitles - they always move faster than my comfort level - and NO back up audio - for those like me who want to listen - and Not read.
The intent of the show is good - the result is weird and poorly done. : (",1391385600,3,598,3.950413223140496
3503636,5,B001C28ZDE,I really liked watching this show. It was entertaining to see. Like when the kid who went fishing had a feeling he was right on top of where a dead body was.,1391385600,,157,3.9375
3503637,5,B001C28ZDE,"I'm looking for psychic kids, episode spirits among us with two 11year old girls if it's on DVD love what chip is doing for these children and Edy Nathan wonderful job love the show.you are so dedicated to helping kids",1391040000,,218,4.475
3503638,5,B001C28ZDE,I watch the show on TV.  It is fascinating and heart warming how the children are helped overcome their fears and manage their gifts.,1387065600,,133,4.541666666666667
3503639,4,B001C28ZDE,The rest of the series is hard to come by.  We would love to have the rest of them! !,1378080000,,85,3.25
3503640,5,B001C28ZDE,"I wish the show would have continued. I also hope to see seasons 2 and 3 come out on DVD with first season. Why put out the first season and not the next two seasons. Makes no sense.

Chris Fleming who is the lead psychic in the next two seasons and I loved watching him help with missing persons cases.",1377907200,,303,4.05
3503641,5,B001C28ZDE,This dvd is very exciting to me as I love to watch and see the experiences that these youngsters have encountered.,1376956800,,114,4.476190476190476
3503642,4,B001C28ZDE,I found this to be heart-warming that Chip Coffey and the psychologist worked together to help kids with psychic abilities understand what being psychic is all about and not to fear this ability.  I am dissapointed that the second season and any other season are not available.  I also feel that we miss a lot due to time constraints.,1374624000,4,334,4.6440677966101696
3503643,5,B001C28ZDE,"I'm pleased there are people willing to dedicate their expertise to help others, especially children.  A subject matter whose validity is often questioned, I am thankful for those willing to step forward and make a difference.",1361664000,,226,5.277777777777778
3503644,5,B001C28ZDE,Good to see kids that are going through something I can not understand find other kids they can relate too and be normal.,1360627200,,121,4.304347826086956
3503645,4,B001C28ZDE,I think it is a shame that this series was not picked up again.  Chip Coffee has lots to offer,1353110400,4,94,3.7
3503646,5,B001C28ZDE,"There is only one problem with the series ""Psychic Kids""...we need more episodes!! This is one of the most interesting and watchable TV programs out there.  Chip Coffey is an empathetic yet empowering mentor to young, confused and frequently frightened, children whose gifts seem to exceed their levels of understanding. MORE!!  MORE!!  MORE!!",1309132800,6,343,5.433962264150943
3503647,4,B001C28ZDE,"I agree with the previous review.  One episode (disc 2), is seriously out of audio/video sync, preventing me from giving this otherwise excellent set 5 stars.",1291507200,3,158,5.076923076923077
3503648,5,B001C28ZDE,"Chip Coffey hits a home run in this series.  Children with psychic abilities are introduced, and their challenges with growing up with unique gifts are illustrated.  Chip helps the kids by giving them ways to cope with their skills, and helps parents accept their children and their gifts.  Parents are also given support tools and methods of helping their kids.

Even if you don't believe in the paranormal, it is clear that Chip has truely helped these kids adjust to adolescent life.",1287878400,4,486,4.890243902439025
3503649,5,B001C28ZDE,Chip Coffey is an amazing psychic.  These episodes show how isolating it can be for a child.  I really like the way the parents are counseled so they are not feeling as isolated as they once were. What a cool subject for a show.  I just wish there were more episodes.  Kudos to Chip!!!,1286236800,2,285,4.222222222222222
3503650,2,B001C28ZDE,"I was expecting a story, not another ghost hunter type thing.  Do not go by my thoughts though, if you are into boring real life (??) watch and enjoy.  I will not be waisting any more money!!!!!!!!",1275696000,2,197,4.297297297297297
3503651,4,B001C28ZDE,"As a professional Psychic and Art Director for over 12 years, I was really happy to see a program focusing on helping children understand, harness and develop their paranormal abilities. As the mainstream is becoming more aware and beginning to accept the reality of PSI abilities, it is important to have information and guidance available to the children who are dealing with their gifts. I highly commend Chip Coffey and Dr. Lisa Miller for taking on this endeavor. I wish I had this sort of information available when I was a child struggling to understand and find some sort of validation for my own gifts, rather than having to find my way on my own during my developing years. The only criticism I have is in the actual editing, art direction and sound design of the series. Although I understand the need to create interest and keep the audiences attention in the show, I feel the effects and sound design were a bit over the top and overly dramatic, which in my opinion, takes away from the actual content of the show, lessens the validity of ESP abilities and made it seem a bit ""hokey"" and ""hollywoodised"". Other than that, again I applaud A&E for taking on such a program and putting it out to the world.",1268611200,5,1216,4.608294930875576
3503652,5,B001C28ZDE,New quality arrived before expected date great condition great service all around great experience. Would totally order from seller again and would reccommend both the dvd and the seller to others,1266537600,,196,5.354838709677419
3503653,5,B001C28ZDE,"This documentary of children gifted with various talents within the realm of the paranormal is quite a fascinating trip!
If your a medium and/or have had a taste of the paranormal yourself in some way, this film is especially for you!~~As it can help validate your own personal encounters pertaining to the supernatural, as you watch these very bright, intelligent children open up and share their true stories to the world. It's also an enlightening experience to see how Chip Coffey takes each one of the kids under his wing, and literally teaches them how to manage their gifts both on an individualistic level and within a group setting. So if you yourself has ""repressed"" any of your gifts due to fear, open up and live through their experiences~allow them to be your guides  ...",1262217600,9,784,4.807407407407408

100% recommended.",1257292800,,220,4.972972972972973
3503655,5,B001C28ZDE,"Ok, let's start with the bad.  The last 10-15 minutes (somewhere in there) of 'Angels and Demons' is about 10 seconds or so out of sync between the audio and video.  Other than that, this is a great series.  I always make a point to watch this on A&E, but now I don't have to.  This is a wonderful series chronicling children/young adults (aged 8 to 19) who have or believe they have psychic abilities.  I do believe things such as this are possible, but I will admit it is remotely possible it is faked.  I will say that all these young people do seem genuine, and I do believe they have the abilities they say they have.  It is a very well done series; whether you believe this or not, check this out.  It may change your mind.",1253577600,,729,4.194244604316546
3503656,5,B001C28ZDE,"Nobody with regular senses and perceptions would believe in what they see. I'm not a psychic but I know from my studies of paranormal activities and spiritual (not religions) books that such things as ghosts are exist. In normal life what would you do if somebody intervene in your home? First reaction is fear. That is what kids feel. Especially if you do not know how to interact with not physical essence. Normally if you not interesting in contact ""they"" will eventually will loose interest in you or you will ask ""them"" to leave. Same like with people. That what mature psychic Chip Coffey trying to do in this film.
Kids look really scared and it does not look like they faking it. Some kids posses with healing gift. And this work for them even better then any adult psychic could do because they not polluted with negative energy yet. But to perform healing they need a guide of course.
Movie well done. DVD 2 disk set. There is a glitch though in second disk in ""Angels and demons"" (last 7 minutes of video does not synchronized with sound). In total film would attract your attention. It is not like interview film it is field film out of movie studio. I'd recommend to watch.",1253059200,,1186,4.546728971962617
3503657,5,B001C28ZDE,"If you have any interest in the paranormal this series will get your attention.  Physic medium Chip Coffey and child psychologist, Dr. Lisa Miller interview and eventually help children understand and learn to live with their psychic gifts.  It's an interesting series and watching these children, who many for the first time, interact with someone who is encouraging and accepting is rewarding and touching.  It is also educational as to how these children learn to use their psychic abilities in a safe nonthreatening environment.  I highly recommend this DVD.  Pop the popcorn and get ready to pull the covers over your head.  This is the real deal not fiction amd you'll truly enjoy it.",1252713600,7,690,5.008771929824562

8285669,5,B001C28ZDE,"I bought this Season 1 DVD when it first came out a few years ago, and was disappointed to see that the audio and video are out of sync in the last few minutes of the ANGELS AND DEMONS episode. Many reviewers here report the same problem so A&E engineers should have cought this production glitch. Another disappointment was that Seasons 2-3 were not released on DVD. For those of you who may be interested, I'd like to say that Seasons 1-3 are now available on Amazon Instant Video. I bought all three seasons and there is no problem with that ANGELS AND DEMONS episode.

Too bad A&E canceled this after only 21 episodes in 3 seasons. I say this because I know how helpful this show was to these special needs gifted children and their families. Psychic children often suffer in fear and isolation and parents don't know where to turn for help in dealing with these paranormal experiences. I respect that the producers of PSYCHIC KIDS took a holistic approach by featuring psychologists Lisa Miller or Edy Nathan along with experienced psychics Chip Coffey or Chris Fleming. We get to see how the kids and their families were helped, guided and encouraged by this supportive team.

Each episode tells interesting facts about what the kids are facing and they are brought to 'haunted' locations or partake in police investigations as training in learning how to handle their psychic abilities. It's great to see them grow in confidence as they learn to face and overcome their fears.

The production quality of these shows is excellent. Anyone interested in psychic gifts and how people learn to cope and use them can enjoy these programs.",1439078400,2,1639,4.764084507042254
