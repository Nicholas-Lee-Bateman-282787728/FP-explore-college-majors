4483054,1,B004VLLWBU,"What is the point of a murder mystery when you figure out who the killer is in the first 5 minutes? The killer ends up being the only person in the town who smokes, spits and swears. He's only character in the town that is at all suspicious.  If you're considering buying, renting or even *gasp* downloading this movie, don't. You're better off watching a law & order re-run on tnt.",1309910400,3,382,4.380281690140845

4483059,5,B004VLLWBU,"Different, totally wonderful. As in the title, the songs, the music is a big player in this film. It's a common theme of love and redemption beautifully, intriguingly done. I've seen it 4 times and will again just for the way it's put together and the blending of the filming and the music. Could it be better than the small town sheriff leading the house that is being moved along main street as a surreal parade. Big movie in this small town. Not a block buster maybe, but terrific for film aficionados. Real art, it will be appreciated and studied for a long time.",1481932800,,567,4.461538461538462
4483060,4,B004VLLWBU,A fascinating small-scale mystery story that deserves to be seen by more people. And you get the ineffable Peter Stormare as leading man!,1481587200,,137,5.0

4483065,5,B004VLLWBU,"I loved this murder mystery. Peter Stormare was remarkable as a middle-aged sheriff obsessed with a woman who is terrified of him. The supporting cast is impeccable. This is art in a very anti-slick, non-Hollywood style.",1475107200,,220,5.138888888888889

4483067,3,B004VLLWBU,"This was kind of a quirky little movie. I liked it because I am from a small town and it depicts that small town mentality very well in how everyone knows everyone else's business and how a murder would certainly cause a major uproar in the community and stir up a myriad of emotions among the townspeople. The accompanying music being played throughout the movie was interesting, to say the least. I felt the actors all did a very good job in their respective roles. While I have never lived near an Amish or Mennonite community, there is also that element to add to the story line. So, if you're looking for something a little bit different some evening, I say give it a try. It may be a little dark for some. It's not Mary Poppins, for sure, but there is some intrigue there.",1473811200,2,778,4.372413793103449

4483106,3,B004VLLWBU,"It was interesting. I had wanted to see Peter Stormare in something other than Fargo. I guess you might classify this as an Indy film. It was filmed in Ontario, Canada. The sound track was outstanding.",1462233600,,201,4.611111111111111

As for the story itself..it just didn't deliver. There was no flow to it.",1460419200,,340,4.074626865671642
4483109,2,B004VLLWBU,The story line is very thin which is drowned out by the background music.,1460073600,,73,4.285714285714286

4483113,4,B004VLLWBU,"The hero of this film is the sheriff of a small, Canadian farming community and, apparently, a lapsed Mennonite. It opens with his re-baptism back into the church. We later learn that he has anger issues and is prone to violent outbursts, which now he is trying to control. His ex-girlfriend has taken out a restraining order against him. When the nude body of a young woman is found in a field, he must solve the murder - his first. A city detective is sent to take charge of the case, but he is a bit of a jerk and a fish out of water in this community, where many folks will only speak a form of German. And not many of them seem to trust the sheriff either. All I'll say is that the sheriff messes up big time, the detective leaves in disgust, and there's still a murder to solve. The story is simple, driven by character, not the murder investigation. Who did it is known fairly early. These are essentially non-verbal people. There's a minimum of dialogue, befitting the stark, wintry landscape. Which makes the music soundtrack all the more startling and wonderful. If you don't know about shaped-note music, see this film and prepare to be elated. Shaped-note is a form of musical notation invented for the non-musical, so that they could sing sacred songs. It taught them how to read the shapes and their corresponding notes - do, re, mi, etc. And what's so marvelous is that many church groups in remote nooks and crannies of North America are still singing in this way, sometimes at joyous, rollicking speeds. All the suppressed passion of the movie's characters is expressed in the soundtrack. See the movie just so you can hear it.",1458777600,4,1644,4.5574324324324325
4483114,1,B004VLLWBU,The movie made no sense.... One almost felt as if they came in the middle of it.... Lots of questions with very little answers. A waste of time.... The only good part of movie was the music....,1458000000,,193,4.243243243243243

4483118,2,B004VLLWBU,"Peter Stormare is a good actor, and the story had a good supporting cast. The location was perfect for the story.

4483125,3,B004VLLWBU,I certainly liked the camera work directing and scoring. It was a bit anticlimactic for me. I was unclear if it was a movie about a killer and a murder that needed to be solved or about a man who struggled with his anger and being a better person.  However I did like that when he overcame his demons he solved the case,1457222400,,319,4.063492063492063

4483131,3,B004VLLWBU,"It's a character study of a small town Canadian cop trying to investigate a murder.  He was born a Mennonite but left the farm and became a born again Christian.  He's wound up tighter than a faulty clock and really doesn't seem to go through life with a full deck.  Basically, I think its a Christian movie that is more into Jesus Christ's teachings than providing a solid plot for the story. There were flash backs where he is beating an unidentified man who either lived or died.  I guess he lived or the cop would have faced prison, but the circumstances remained a mystery throughout. A jelly bean had more personality than the main character. For Prime members it was free (if it wasn't it would have been a complete rip off). It would have been better if more time had been spent on the victim instead of a cop undergoing a religious tribulation.",1456531200,,853,4.483870967741935

Four CAPTIVATING Stars! In this award-winning, oddly-titled ""Small Town Murder Songs"" movie, the uneasy Chief Walter Ruden, his staff, and outside police help are caught up in this murder mystery in a small town in GreyFork County. With an unidentified body, a Mennonite-influence, starkly beautiful scenery, and a very distinctive music soundtrack, the search is on to find a killer in an unusual area with tangled relationships. Starring Peter Stormare, Aaron Poole, Ari Cohen, Stephen Eric McIntyre, Jackie Burroughs, Herm Dick, Erin Brandenburg, with Martha Plimpton, and Jill Hennessy (Crossing Jordan). On the second viewing, all the nuanced clues are right there for the discovery. Four REVEALING Stars. (Telefilm Canada. Produced by Lee Kim. Written, Produced, & Directed by Ed Gass-Donnelly.

4483280,4,B004VLLWBU,"The movie is not really about finding a murderer; it is about a man finding redemption from his troubled past.  The story revolves around the murder of a young girl in a small Canadian town and the town's police chief (Walter) who finds himself caught between standard police procedure and achieving justice for the victim.  The plot is complicated by the fact that the murder suspect is the live-in boyfriend of his ex-girlfriend and by his struggle to keep his impulsive and at times violent temperament in check with his new found faith in God.  In the end, his need for justice brings him close to breaking but his faith prevents him from going over the edge and his actions lead to the murderer's arrest.

I enjoyed the glimpses of small town life in Canada, so similar to small town life in America.  The pace is slower, like life in the town, because the focus is on character development not action.  Walter's history is revealed through short scenes that give you insight but don't hand it to you on a silver platter.  I enjoy movies that don't hold your hand and explain every little thing that happens.  The music was a bit jarring at times but I felt it complemented Walter's story.

4483323,5,B004VLLWBU,"""Eerily beautiful. Evoking the Coen Brothers,"" proclaims the cover of this DVD. Really? It's obvious why a marketing department would seize upon that quote, but it's also risky. After all, the Coens are filmmaking deities, and to set such expectations for a low-budget drama by an unknown director invites daunting comparisons. But...

""Small Town Murder Songs"" is eerily beautiful, and does indeed evoke the Coen Brothers.

From the onset, this film conveys a Fargoesque setting that is both foreign yet familiar, a mood that is uneasy yet comforting, and characters that are frightening yet likable. Indeed, these dualities are an integral motif, because this film is not about the murder or who did it, or even the tension between characters. It's a about the conflicting pressures within one man. The real ""bad guy"" is not the killer. The real bad guy is inside the good guy, and that's where the understated plot evolves. Focus on the topical, and you will miss it.

Accentuating the mood is a haunting soundtrack, immersing the viewer in this hypnotic, trance-like experience. Meanwhile, let's not take the Coen comparison too far, because you will not find the Coen's humor or left turns here. But this is a film (and soundtrack) I will return to again and again.",1346025600,7,1270,4.981132075471698

A few small town policemen find themselves in the rare predicament of having to solve the murder of a young woman from out of town, probably killed by a community member. The harsh timber, tone and cadence of the music underscores the situational paradox, while the religious score drives the redemption message home.

The question is, can these small-town characters hold up without tearing each other apart under this kind of pressure? I'm a small town girl and I had to score this a 5 for the very realistic portrayals by these actors of earthy, basically good people, worn yet willfully working on, combined with Bruce Peninsula's killer musical assist!",1343952000,12,726,5.05
4483325,1,B004VLLWBU,"This film has inspired me to come up with a new rating system based on whether or not I can stay awake during a movie. A rating of 10 means I could not stay awake more than 5 minutes on the first viewing; a rating of zero means I could not fall asleep even if exhausted. particularly if I am viewing the movie for the second time.

I'm sure that ""Small Town Murder Songs"" is all very artsy and grand; the musical score is fairly compelling, loud and modern, ( not really to my taste, though). The bonus features include a download which I intend to listen to some day when I'm not trying to watch the movie.

""Small Town Murder Songs"" gets a 9 on my snooze-o-meter scale. I could not stay awake longer than 2 minutes. I would have rated it a 10, but I admit I was pretty tired when I stuck it in my DVD drive. I was able to keep my eyes open long enough to eat a couple of tacos, but nodded off immediately afterwards. I kept quickly nodding off during several subsequent attempts, until I finally gave up. It just wasm't interesting enough to keep trying, so back it went to the DVD rental store.

Very bleak, slow-moving, and, despite the subject matter, very boring, in my opinion. And I'm a fan of slow-moving, contemplative films, (as long as they're interesting and well-made.

The plot was very thin. It tried to rely on the down home, small town atmosphere it created and the personal conflict of the characters...but it didn't work. The dramatic tension was limited to what Stormare produced in his fine performance, but these were isolated scenes that didn't carry over to the rest of the movie. It didn't play itself out in a compelling manner.

The ""troubled cop with a past seeking redemption"" theme was not fully developed and was not brought to a satisfying end and it was pretty humdrum when it was all said and done.

I could see the intention of the music and the chapter headings, but they were poorly executed and became an annoyance. Why so loud?

Walter is the chief of police in a small Ontario town that has just recorded its first murder in recent memory. And he has more than his fair share of troubles with the case. Through brief encounters and off-hand comments of the town's citizens, we learn that Walter is the semi-shunned son of a local Mennonite community. Not to mention, he is not over a stormy relationship with a woman who is now bedding up with the natural uspect -- a complete sleazeball. Walter is desperately trying to shed his past violent ways by getting religion. The man is packed with more high explosives than a Fourth of July fireworks barge.

Meanwhile, the murder of a yougn woman, dumped by the river, has the town in panic and blaming Walter for being too slow to solve the crime. Walter has no one to talk to but a local bubbleheaded waitress. He is a volcano of repressed feelings, rage and helplessness.

Peter Stormare is awesome as wound-up Walter. He is simultaneously sympathetic and scary. The script is terrific, giving just enough information to piece together the story. The rugged soundtrack is sometimes overblown, but adds to the sense of isolation and depair. Terrific storytelling and acting.",1311465600,,1221,4.777251184834123
4483332,4,B004VLLWBU,"The soundtrack is performed by Bruce Peninsula, a Canadian indie rock group, and is just incredible.  I immediately got an album by Bruce Peninsula after seeing this movie, I was that impressed.  The movie itself is good but not great. It is a study of a small town Canadian cop whose professional side mixes with his personal love life because he suspects his ex lover's new boyfriend murdered a local girl.

If you are looking for a scintillating murder mystery, this is not it.  If you are looking for a good character study of people in this Canadian backwater town, this is worth watching. You would never guess any of these people are even actors because they seem to be real life citizens of this town. Because of this, it almost has a documentary feel to it.  There are also a lot of Mennonites in this town so there is exploration of that lifestyle as well.

To improve the grade on this movie, I'd say what its director needs to improve on is his or her pacing skills. The camera lingers more often than not on scenes with no inherent dynamism to them.

After discovering a murdered girl in a field, Ottawa police officer Walter (Stormare) is put in charge of trying to find the killer.  When the pressure of the case starts to get to him will he act like the officer he is, or will his past catch up with him first?  This is another movie that has a very deliberate pace, it does drag a little in spots, but overall a very good movie.  The best way to describe this is slowly watching a man who has it all together begin to lose it.  All the while you begin to feel sorry for him, and you feel like you shouldn't.  This is the best Coen Brothers movie that they haven't directed.  This movie has the pacing and feel of one of thier movies, even though they had nothing to do with this one.  The acting is excellent and is a joy to watch Walter try to stay calm in the midst of the pressure he is facing.  This is a great choice if you are looking for a movie. I liked it a lot.  Overall, a very good movie filled with great acting.  The music used in this movie is excellent, and it really adds to the feel of the movie.  This is another movie that is not for everyone, but those that like the Coen Brothers will really enjoy this movie.  I give it a B.

There are strong religious overtones so if you are one of those persons who simply want nothing to do with the Christian religion and don't believe in salvation, etc. then I would avoid this movie like the plague. But if not, this movie is darn good and will keep you guessing til the end. But it's not just about religion. It also brings home that a man is a man and only has enough blood to work one head at a time, religious or not religious. Saved or not saved.",1501718400,,823,4.15

There was something here, then there was nothing.  Good atmosphere and fine filming, some good acting, but it all leads to nothing.",1497398400,,269,4.428571428571429

8443566,4,B004VLLWBU,"Wrong! I go against all the other 200 plus reviewers that said its just a pokey little detective drama about small town Canadians, dontcha know? Ok , spoiler here, but pay attention from the beginning and you will come to the conclusion that the Sheriff  did it, yes he violently punched that girl to death. First scene, sets it up with words from his brother, "" we don't like that kinda violence, not raised that way"". The movie has a lot of long pauses, people looking over cornfields, so if you want action and crime investigation, this is not your movie. I swear the Sheriff is the real bad guy and he got baptised and sings in church to cover up his true self.",1488672000,2,665,4.362903225806452
