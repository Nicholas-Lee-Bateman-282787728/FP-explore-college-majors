516131,5,6302804825,Discovering this movie was truly a stroke of luck. You'll find yourself quoting lines at parties for years - if you can find someone else who's seen it!,941760000,10,152,4.464285714285714
7831752,5,6302804825,"Underrated film. Rarely seen by most people. Explores relationships between family, friends and lovers. Has an interesting way of showing how dysfunctional relationships thrive and how to move on from them to more healthy ones. The script, cast, dialogue are all terrific. It has never come out on DVD. It plays on rare occasions on TV. If you get a chance WATCH IT!",1426723200,,366,4.825396825396825
7831753,5,6302804825,"One of my favorite movies of all time and it's SO DISAPPOINTING that this movie is not available on DVD yet.

Unbelievable!!!!

When is this movie coming to DVD??????

This movie is one of the most masterful and seductive indoctrinations of showing how the small things we do become so important over time.

All of us have these little things we do, little rituals and traditions, that we forget about.

This movie will make you wish for the weekend and when it comes, start doing the greatest pranks on your buddies and then screaming, ""WATCH IT!!!!!!!!""

If you find this movie on DVD or on NETFLIX, contact me immediately if NOT SOONER!!!!!",1416700800,,643,4.696428571428571
7831754,5,6302804825,"This is one of those B-movie gems (where the creative people are allowed to run free because there isn't enough money riding on it for the bean-counters to be hovering over it). Tho it has many endearing features, it's chief feature is a 6-minute comedic rant by John C. McGinley on WHY NICE GUYS NEVER GET THE GIRL. It is so hilarious that I was rolling on the floor, trying not to swallow my tongue!! Unfortunately, it's very hard to find, and never made it from VHS to DVD. What a shame--it is a cult classic waiting to be discovered!",1297728000,,537,4.38
7831755,5,6302804825,"My wife turned me on to this movie early in our relationship.  It's an outrageously funny dramedy, especially if you enjoy practical jokes.  I just wish I could find it on DVD or via Netflix.",1286323200,,191,4.428571428571429
7831756,4,6302804825,"I happened to stumble on this film in the mid 90s.  Nobody I know has ever heard of it, I can't find it on Netflix and it seems to have sunk without trace, which is a real shame.

The plot centers on 4 guys who share a house in Chicago and who amuse themselves by playing practical jokes on each other, generally culminating in one saying to the other ""Watch it"", as the joke is revealed.  It sounds rather puerile, and it is in some ways, but it's still a really fun film.  All the actors are good, there's a good plot an some excellent dialogue.

How this film has never caught on as a 'Cult Classic' I'll never know, when there re so many other films that are described in that way that are truly, mind-numbingly dull.

I won't give it 5 stars.  After all, it's not Pulp Fiction or The Blue Brothers.  But it is well worth 4.  If you ever find it, rent it.  I will.",1269561600,,868,4.0828402366863905
7831757,5,6302804825,"Some how this gem flew in under the radar when it was released in 1991, so many people don't know how good it is. ""Watch It"", in my humble opinion, is a truly excellent date flick that somehow hasn't appeared on DVD format yet. What perturbs me the most is there is no ""Alert Me"" provision on Amazon's VHS or Laserdisc promotional web pages for this film. GET WITH THE PROGRAM AMAZON!",1251504000,3,384,4.347222222222222
7831758,4,6302804825,"I simply don't understand how this particular movie hasn't made it to the DVD format.  Many of the actors have gone on to stardom- for one.  There are certainly multitudes of titles far inferior to said film that have been produced on DVD- often in several ""pressings"" in different editions! This was (in my useless opinion), the golden age of indie dialog-driven, no murder and/or explosions comedies, dramedies, etc, and it is well represented by an adequate, charming, and enjoyable, if indeed ""inconsequential"", outing via ""WATCH IT"".  How's that for a run-on deliberation?  I honestly think a great detriment to it's DVD birth is the title.  The term ""Watch it"" is too common place in searches and activities and I'd bet this has secured it's obscurity as the two words simply rarely if ever arrive and/or occur in the context of a movie title.  Place this sucker on DVD already!",1241222400,5,884,4.86
7831759,1,6302804825,"I'm so ashamed for having sat through and watched this whole movie. Don't buy it...send me postage and I'll send you my ""newly"" bought VHS for free.
Save yourself the shame...never ""Watch It.""",1195516800,,192,4.848484848484849
7831760,5,6302804825,My wife and I both absolutely love this movie.  It is truly a gem that unfortunately has been overlooked by most people.  I have been looking for it to come out on DVD for two years now and it just isn't coming out.  What's the deal??,1105315200,16,234,4.043478260869565
7831761,5,6302804825,"How I stumbled upon this movie:

 At my local blockbuster in Gillete NJ, I came across a black box with a yellow stick on it that said ""watch it!"" Apparently someone had lost the case and the replacement display box used was just a black box with a sticker and the name of the movie. However, since the title was watch it! I had no idea what it was, AT ALL. So i did what it said, and i ""watched it"" AWESOME MOVIE, HILARIOUS.",1091664000,8,425,4.0476190476190474
