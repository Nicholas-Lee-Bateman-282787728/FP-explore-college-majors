8061847,3,B0009JD784,"This dvd is okay.  The quality isn't great.  It is something you would find in the bargain bin of  The Old Country Store at Cracker Barrel.  It is good family entertainment.  The Lassie movie is like all Lassie movies.  She out smarts the bad guys and saves the day.  Her name is Lady in this and not Lassie.
And The Three Stooges are The Three Stooges no matter who the line up is. I did not stay a life long Stooges fan.  I loved them when I was a kid.  And I enjoy watching them now for the memories it brings back.  But their kind of slap stick comedy doesn't work for me as an adult.",1500681600,,588,3.9913793103448274
8061848,1,B0009JD784,"This DVD does NOT have six shorts on it, but only four! And the four that are included are hardly the Stooges best work. These are the same tired, lame shorts that you can find everywhere.",1123459200,,188,4.25
