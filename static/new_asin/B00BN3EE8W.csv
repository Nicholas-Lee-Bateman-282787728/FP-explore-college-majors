Who comes up with these ""deals?"" (And who found this review - which warns people off from paying almost double what they should be paying through amazon to obtain this films - unhelpful?)

8571359,5,B00BN3EE8W,"This is a bundle of five war movies.  Each of these films deal with the second World War, including major events such as D-Day and the attack on Pearl Harbor.  Together, the five films would give a decent experience of what the war was like from multiple points of view.  Of course, we should be cautious about turning to movies to get our factual history of the war... but these films are an entertaining way to appreciate what an event like WWII meant for our country, our soldiers, our allies, our adversaries, and our world.

Now, these films are older, so they aren't necessarily going to have the same level of spectacle as more recent films like ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""Pearl Harbor"".  But they have just as much heart, and there are a variety of fantastic performances across the five films.

Please note that this is not a box set, it is just the five movies sold together - each movie comes in its own separate blu-ray case.  If you're a fan of these films, then they've never looked and sounded better than they do on these blu-ray discs.  Some have expressed concern with the video transfers on some of these movies, but I find the image to be fine in most cases (although it could certainly be better).

Here are the links to the individual releases (prices are always changing, so sometimes it might be cheaper to buy the films individually):
