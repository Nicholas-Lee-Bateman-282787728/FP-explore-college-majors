You know that you have ventured into sad territory when you can't even tell a story without violently debasing a naked woman within the first five minutes of your story. Is it really super crucial to have them cut her clothes off and further did you need to put a bag over her head, essentially not even giving her a human identity? Watching her writhe around in utter debasement, not even with a face, literally nothing more than a writhing naked torso and vag. How pathetic. Really? That's the opener? So basically let's start your story by giving rapists and woman haters a huge treat before whatever else your film is about. Ok, how about LOSING ANY INTELLIGENT FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER ALSO. I don't watch excrement. Sorry chaps, if that's the best you got. I don't waste my time, sorry you thought I would.",1438905600,3,896,4.677215189873418

I am chagrined to confess I have never seen THE DISAPPEARANCE OF ALICE CREED, even though its been sitting on my shelf for months.  Ive heard good things, though.  When I found out RECKLESS was a sort of foreign retelling of the same story, my curiosity got the best of me, and I decided to take a look.  Im happy to report RECKLESS is a riveting and thrilling film, a  true masterpiece of crime cinema!

I love everything about this movie, which is why I am happily giving it five out of five stars.  It is that good.

The cinematography in RECKLESS is great, and the film looks tight onscreen.  The direction is outstanding, and it shows in the fluid way the movie moves along.  This is a 90 minute film, but the credits were rolling before I knew it.

The acting is excellent as well, with the whole cast giving top notch performances.  Tygo Gernandt and Marwan Kenzari portray the kidnappers, while Sarah Chronis plays the victim.  I am not familiar with their previous work, but I hope to see more of them in the future.

The story is the big winner in RECKLESS, though.  It is chocked full of suspense and tension.  There are also several twists that occur throughout, and each is a welcome surprise.  I stayed glued to my screen for the entirety of the film, eager to see what was going to happen and hoping I hadnt missed anything.

RECKLESS is a major win for me, and I highly recommend it.  It is a foreign film with English subtitles and no dub-over, so be ready to read the dialogue.  But that does not detract from the film at all.  Give this one a look for sure.  It is available now.",1438214400,3,1671,4.339805825242719
