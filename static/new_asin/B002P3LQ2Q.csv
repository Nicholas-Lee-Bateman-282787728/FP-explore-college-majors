8376606,5,B002P3LQ2Q,"I found this movie while doing research on the brown-water Navy in Vietnam, the River Rats.  There aren't all that many photos of Zippos doing their thing, and here is some excellent footage from the time period taken by two crewman!  It really gives you some perspective on what the Zippo boats were like.  Highly recommended.",1353715200,,327,4.803571428571429
