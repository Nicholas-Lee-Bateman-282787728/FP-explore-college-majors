503229,5,6302718805,"This delightful documentary gives a keen look at the intimate parts of Stephen Hawking's remarkable life.  Interviews of friends, family members, and colleagues are artfully weaved with pictures of Hawking, computer graphic illustrations, and the commentary of Hawking himself.  Along with the overview of Hawking's life we get fascinating bits of physics and philosophy that challenges his mind and everyone else's.  If you have an interest in popular physics, then this would be a worthy purchase.
This isn't a spectacular documentary, it stays true to the accepted style that is both entertaining and at times predictable and plodding.  It is humorous though, the opening scene involves a chicken and some stars, and much of Hawking's narration is filled with wry wit.
The First portion of the film is almost solely devoted to the early years of Professor Hawking's life.  He wasn't good at school we learn surprisingly.  He was never as attentive as he later wished he should have been.  However, his genius was enough, and he got his degrees.  However, it was being diagnosed with ALS that forced him to focus on what really interested him, the aftermath of which has been the cosmologist we know today.
Further into the movie there is a discussion of black holes, which is the subject of Hawking's first successes in physics.  This segment alone I consider worth the price of admission, however an even stronger segment comes next; a discussion of the origin and outcome of the universe in which we live.  It's all concluded by some whimsical observations by Hawking.  This isn't a classic, but for those that don't have the time to jump into many works of cosmology and physics and philosophy, this provides entertainment and a fair dose of where physics stands today.",1059696000,10,1775,5.003401360544218
503230,5,6302718805,Rob Lightner's review says it all.  This is a beautifully crafted glimpse at the very frontiers of scientific research.  Hawking's quest for the ultimate theory is not only scientifically compelling but spiritually uplifting as well.,1005696000,3,233,5.628571428571429
503231,4,6302718805,"'A Brief History of Time' is a film that mixes both the story of Stephen Hawking's life and his theories on quantum physics. At times, it goes through unnecessary stories about Hawking's life; for example, they showed how much he loved Monopoly when he was young. Is this really needed? How many people in the western civilization didn't or haven't played monoply? Nonethless, the movie is mindbending at times, espicially when discussing black holes and the theories of time. Beautiful Philip Glass score, and an inspirational ending.",981676800,2,535,5.160919540229885
503232,4,6302718805,"Remember Captain Pike on classic Trek? He was the burnt, mute guy in the futuristic electric wheelchair. Dr. Stephen Hawking, the star of  ""ABHOT,"" is in much the same situation, except that he's also a  f-ing genius with the incredible ability to distill complicated quantum  physics concepts into simple, understandable stuff for the rest of us  morons. And he even makes it sound cool and (...gulp) interesting. Yikes!",967939200,5,421,5.147058823529412
503233,3,6302718805,"If you are looking for information on theories than go read the book, this is a review of hawkings life.  It is good in that regard but has nothing on science.",944438400,12,159,4.129032258064516
503234,2,6302718805,This video should have rather been called a brief biography of Stephen Hawking. It only touched very lightly on his theories and works. I thought it would be a video version of his famous book but the video can not  compare to the book at all. There are many interviews with people but one  has no idea who these people are or what their relationship is to Dr  Hawking as there are no subtitles. I suggest viewers first view the credits  at the end of the movie where a list of interviewees is given and then go  back and watch the film. The video is also dissappointingly short lasting  only for 80 minutes.,943142400,19,608,4.336283185840708
503235,5,6302718805,"I rented this video at our summer house and was so entranced by it, I watched it three times in a row until 4:00 AM.  Stephen puts very complex, cutting edge theory into easy to understand models for the average guy.  Even if you are above average in your understanding of the universe, you  will still be provoked intellicutally.  I can't say enough about this  video.  Get it for the kids and watch them astound you as to their ability  to think in concepts and question accepted ideas.  JUST BUY IT!!!  -  Terrence J. Boylan, Jr.",939859200,17,532,4.447916666666667
503236,5,6302718805,"If you have any inkling of intelligence, and crave pondering the mechanisms of the Universe, then this is a must see vid for you.  One day, the human species will catch up in our evolutionary process and be able to  reach the itch that Hawkings scratches.",939686400,12,255,4.521739130434782
503237,2,6302718805,"Hawkings is an amazing guy and this is a good biography.  However, if you're craving lots of good science, you'll be disappointed with this amalgam of anecdotes about his health from Stephen's mother.",916012800,4,200,5.0606060606060606
7830321,4,6302718805,"This film, which I reluctantly give four stars (I say relunctantly because all the banter of time and black holes and expanding and contracting universes and stars and singularity and infinite density is totally lost on me), is made keener by interviews with Stephen's mother, who admits that had Stephen never contracted Lou Gherig's disease, he probably would never have been the great scientist that he is, and he probably would have never fully understood Einstein's principle of relativity.  That is because Stephen became trapped inside his body, his only salvation his mind, ears, nose and eyes to work everything out.  He could not use his hands, and after a while his body had pretty much withered away.

While it was difficult for me to follow how Mr. Hawking thinks of time, there are enough vignettes of Stephen's life offered by many respected scientists to keep this film going.  In fact one scientist friend says that Stephen was probably the ""most normal"" of all the members of his family.

This movie ends with an account of Stephen getting hit by a car trying to break to avoid running into his wheelchair.  Stephen receives some stitches to his face, and life goes on, although what has happened to his computer guided mechanical body one can only assume.  And along the way, you, the viewer, is afforded a glimpse into a Brief History of Time.",1498003200,,1363,4.824034334763948

7830325,5,6302718805,"I probably watch this documentary at least once a year, but it's never been available on DVD until now.  I just saw it last night.  It was almost like watching for the very first time.  Morris brilliantly combines aspects of Hawking's life with parts of the book the documentary is named after.  The score by Phillip Glass complements the film like a slow, pulsating heartbeat of a black hole.",1397260800,,393,4.6521739130434785
7830326,5,6302718805,"Most intriguing and informative movie that gives much background on Stephen Hawking, both historical and personal. The oxymoron of a brilliant mind paired with a degrading physical stature; Sad for Stephen, but inspiring for us.",1361318400,,228,5.542857142857143
7830327,5,6302718805,An interesting story of the technical side of astrophysics combined Stephen Hawkings' personal story. You can tell that his mind powers his body rather than vice versa as most of the rest of the human race. I find him admirable and inspiring in the face of extreme adversity.,1246838400,,275,4.75
7830328,2,6302718805,"This video was purchased as part of the required material for a college course.  I've always been interested in science and the people at the cutting edge, but this autobiographical account of Mr. Hawkings path through life tended to drag.  There were even moments when I almost became convinced that we'd been dragged to the event horizon of one of the black holes he is so famous for working with.  There are some moments of interest that can draw your attention, but they are few and far between.  Unless you are into biographical videos, I wouldn't suggest purchasing this one.",1245974400,6,581,4.78
7830329,3,6302718805,"A very fine and intriguing documentary from Errol Morris about the life and work of physicist/celebrity Stephen Hawking, who revolutionized the way we think about the universe in his monumental book of the same name. The film is really divided into two stories, the life of Hawking as he struggles to overcome his paralysis, and the brilliant work he achieved in spite of his physical limitations. One gets the impression that had Hawking never became ill, he wouldn't have been as compelled to carry out the kind rigorous intellectual work that he of course did carry out, and (he himself notes that he was quite bored with life prior to his paralysis). Morris does a fine job with the material; the first half hour of the film suffers from a dry PBS feel, but the aesthetic and intellectual intensity takes off from there, the film never digresses into a mere sob story. Morris nearly always keeps the material more intellectually intriguing than it is uplifting and sentimental.",1130457600,2,981,4.880239520958084
7830330,3,6302718805,"Many documentaries focus on either the scientific ideas of a person, trying to explain them to an audience wherein most people can understand what is being talked about.

Other documentaries are about people who against the odds do something great that everyone will remember them by.

This documentary combines both in a very interesting mix. Through interviews with his mother and sister we get a good insight into his life as a teenager and part of college. From his fellow students we learn more about him as a student at Oxford and Cambridge (with not the best grades btw). From colleagues we learn what a brilliant mind he was.

Hawking is the only person to really talk about both sides, about how his disease (ALS) developed and also how he came up with his brilliant ideas, also fully admitting where he was wrong.

The maker of this movie has made a very good mix of a biography of Stephen Hawking but inbetween also a good explenation of time, black holes and such that even someone with no feeling for math and physics can understand.",1122336000,3,1046,4.668478260869565
