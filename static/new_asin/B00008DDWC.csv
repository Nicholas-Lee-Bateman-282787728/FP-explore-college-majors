8078646,5,B00008DDWC,"Greetings;

I won't bother to add to what the previous reviewer stated about the plot. I will even agree that the subtitles were a bit lackluster. I will say that the acting was pretty good, that as a Chinese movie, there are several primary acting groups or schools as I recall and the fact that this movie involves a traveling troupe, I always sort of thought payed homage to that. The actual 'plays' that are put on within the movie arn't too shabby-if you have seen any of the Mr. Vampire series, you will notice that on occasion, there will be a fairly elaborate ceramony that is being done-largely special effects. The Plays put on in this movie were I felt, rather indicitive of that.
If you are like me, you probably happened across this movie while you were looking for other Lam-Ching-ying movies. There are a haldfull or so of them, though not all of them are what you might come to expect. I don't really remember, but I do seem to recall that the third or fourth 'The Gods Must Be Crazy' movie, actually had a Taoist Priest in it, I believe that it was actually Lam himself, though I could be mistaken. It is something I havn't bought yet but still. Someday I will bring myself to do so. In either case, I have spent a good number of years trying to get all of the Mr Vampire series. I have more or less all of them though three of them were actually from China and while regionless, proved to be cheap enough that my dvd players seem to have fits trying to play them. They were produced by...Yung Xin Zhu Jiu Pin Zhi and Um....Kind of hard to tell. G-Juxing, Classic Movie? In either case. I plan to re-order from amazon. I found several copies that I think should work out, appear to be done by DeltaMac, which was the group that made my copy of Hocus Pocus as well as 'Vampire vs Vampire.'The other group I think that is doing one or so of what I will order is 'Media Asia.' I suggest that you should look for similar companies if you are looking to expand your collection, though always read the reviews and know that sometimes there are multiple copies. For example, my copy of Hocus Pocus was a DeltaMac and the artwork is different from what you see there in the description. Unless I am mistaken, looks like it might be a Media Asia. Either way, good copies though the DeltaMac seems to be harder to come by for some reason.

Thank you...",1349568000,,2359,4.359090909090909
8078647,3,B00008DDWC,"The 1980s had a lot of supernatural comedies, and ""Hocus Pocus"" is one of the flimsier examples of the genre. While the script is about as lackluster as it comes, the actors keep up a pretty steady stream of pyrotechnic wire-fu and slapstick prankery. And Ching-Ying Lam knocks the whole thing up another notch.

A troupe of wandering actors come to a theatre in a large town, and delight the locals with their tales of ghosts, gods and battles. Behind the scenes, there's a power struggle going on between two bright young actors, and a bunch of young men playing ghostly pranks on each other.

What they don't realize is that there's a REAL ghost (Yuet Sang Chin) causing mischief backstage. So the troupe's ghost expert, Master Sheng (Ching-Ying Lam) has to come up with a way to get the ghost to go away -- except that after they satisfy the mischievous ghost, they attract a malevolent one instead!

The first half of ""Hocus Pocus"" frankly seems pretty directionless, with lots of drunk actors playing jokes, acrobatic shows, and the ghost causing mischief. Fortunately the plot gets moving after that, with some excellent ""hauntings"" and a climactic battle with the malevolent spirit. It doesn't hurt that the combatants are in full supernatural dress, either.

The dialogue tends to be rather lackluster, although that may be the fault of the translators rather than the scriptwriter -- the subtitles are very awkward. To compensate for that, the filmmakers threw in lots of slapstick -- people walking into walls, tripping over spooks, floating in the air, and the occasional bit of toilet humor.

Ching-Ying Lam hadn't yet made ""Mr. Vampire"" when this movie was made, but he does more or less the same job -- he's the capable, level-headed sage, who is surrounded by idiots and spooks. And his presence is enough to knock the production up a notch. The other actors are capable, including Yuet Sang Chin, although none of the other characters are really fleshed out.

""Hocus Pocus"" is a pleasant ghost story, lightweight and a bit slow, but still worth watching for people who like a little comedy with their hauntings.",1161043200,,2128,4.880886426592798
