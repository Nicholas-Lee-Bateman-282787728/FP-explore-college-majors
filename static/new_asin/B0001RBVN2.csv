2024016,5,B0001RBVN2,"This DVD is a performance of Mozart Requiem to celebrate the composer's Bicentenary. It is also the last performance of Arleen Auger, before she died tragically of cancer. It is an excellent recording on all counts, with Solti rounding off a superb interpretation.",1087171200,35,264,5.162790697674419

8016188,3,B0001RBVN2,"Today for the 225th anniversary of death of Mozart (12/05/1791) I enjoyed watching this special Requiem mass in honor of Mozart, done at St. Stephen's Cathedral in Vienna.  The service was on the 200th anniversay of his funeral rites in the same venue, done the day following his death.  Of course, it cannot be said it is a re-enactment, as the Mozart Requiem was not performed at that time, and in fact, it wasn't even finished yet.  It also brings up another puzzling question I will have to look into:  so Mozart was dumped in an unmarked grave on the day he died, and the following day, a service was said for him at this great Cathedral?  Those two items don't seem to add up ...

Anyway, I think you will find this Requiem the finest on video.  It certainly outshines Bohm's dated approach, and Bernstein's lethargically slow performance.  (No disrespect to them, I enjoy them but this is better :)  It also gives us a superb opportunity to view Solti at work, and I wonder why don't have more of his performances on video.  One may also enjoy seeing (and hearing) Rene Pape at only 27 years old, likewise Cecilia Bartoli in her young prime.

The video is clear and sharp for its age, and surprisingly well-lit.  Problem:  there is approximately 70 millisecond delay of picture after sound.  Look at for example closeups of soloists in Tuba Mirum.  This can be corrected with a sound delay box which has brought fresh life to many classical DVDs, but it's pricey.  Would have been much better if the DVDs were correctly engineered to begin with.

Another reason for the lowered rating is that I believe most purchasers in the U.S. would want English subtitles.  Most music lovers do not need subtitles for the Mozart Requiem, but their family members who may want to watch around Easter would certainly want them.  And certainly for the spoken service, in German, I think almost everyone would want them.  I have probably at least as much German as the average music major, and more liturgical German than most I am sure, and I can pick up 'not quite enough' to provide decent commentary on the fly.  So what's with this purchase price and not providing English subtitles?

Recommended with those reservations ...",1480896000,4,2220,4.682170542635659

This piece was directed by Georg Solti with passion and authority, and the 4 soloists were heavenly to listen to, though the tenor was a bit weak, in my opinion.  I will listen to this version many, many times more!",1380499200,10,306,4.648148148148148
