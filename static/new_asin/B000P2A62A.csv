8188529,5,B000P2A62A,"Remote Viewing Training Sessions - Part 1 - 7 - Introduction to RV by Prudence Calabrese. Technically low quality DVDs from an entertainment point of view (White board talk). It is like a home movie of people in a get together in a Days Inn in California. I was amused by Pru. The ""home movie"" recorded class conducted while there was a power failure in the hotel. The power came back on while Pru was teaching. It went off again as DVD 6 ended. Pru presented several techniques not taught in other RV home study courses. She teaches a different resolution to analytical overlay. Pru uses the terms ""weird"" and ""woo woo"" to describe what she is doing. She said she viewed ET children playing with futuristic toys on a planet orbiting a star in the pleiades. She says she contacts para physicals like ghosts. She said one of the woman viewers working with her had a ghost fall in love with her. She has been accused of being self deluded or a fraud. I understand she quit doing RV training.",1217376000,,989,4.469613259668508
