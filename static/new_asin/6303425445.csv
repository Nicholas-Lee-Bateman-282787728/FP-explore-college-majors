Highly recommended!",1470787200,,372,4.328571428571428
7846229,5,6303425445,"Knowing from the very first time I saw this Video, I would want to see it over and over again. I decided to make a mark on the video protective case in order to keep a record of how many times that I had viewed the tape. I now have 79 viewing marks recorded. I also have bought a second BACK-UP tape just in case something should happen to this tape. I sing along with my tape and pretty  well know it by heart. I'll never get tired of this special tape !",996969600,5,455,3.89247311827957
