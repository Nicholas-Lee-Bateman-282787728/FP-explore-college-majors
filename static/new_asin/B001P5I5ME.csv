3738125,5,B001P5I5ME,"I have been waiting for this series to be released here in the United States, and watched it within two days. I have to admit that I have yet to read the book (of the same name) by Flora Thompson that this series is based on (I plan to do so soon). The book is said to be semi-autobiographical but I can't really comment on how faithful the series is to the book since I've yet to read it. My review as such will be confined to the BBC drama.

The story follows the lives of the inhabitants of the poor, sleepy hamlet of Lark Rise and the more affluent and snooty inhabitants of Candleford during the last decades of the 19th century (sometime in the 1880s I believe). The central character Laura Timmins (Olivia Hallinan) is a young girl from Lark Rise who is sent by her parents to work as an assistant to the postmistress, the capable and sensible Dorcas Lane (a brilliant Julia Sawalha). Initially Laura balks at the more restrained and formal way of life in Candleford, and is humiliated by the way some of the town's more snobbish inhabitants (such as the Pratt sisters, Pearl and Ruby, credibly portrayed by Matilda Ziegler and Victoria Hamilton) look down upon her, but she gradually finds satisfaction and a measure of happiness in her job and new surroundings, and comes to develop a true understanding of the inhabitants of both Lark Rise and Candleford, in all their complexities. Julia Sawalha is amazing in her role as the kind postmistress who acts as a sort of mentor to young Laura, and whose own life seems deceptively straightforward, despite some undercurrents, brought on by her close friendship with town squire, Sir Timothy Midwinter (Ben Miles) who is married to a city girl,the cool and composed Lady Adelaide (Olivia Grant).

To delve too much into the plot would detract from the viewer's pleasure, and so all I will say is that this excellent series has everything to recommend it - a wonderful score, beautiful cinematography of the lush English countryside, and plenty of human drama, dealing with social issues, marital strife, forbidden desires, love across the different social classes,friendship, and lots of good old-fashioned humor. The ensemble cast is excellent and a delight to watch, engaging viewer's interest from the first episode till the last of the season, and I was sorry to see it come to an end.

If you have ever been a fan of BBC shows, then you will quickly discover that this wonderful cast of characters includes quite a number of faces you will recognize (Julia Sawalha, Olivia Hallinan, Brendan Coyle and Dawn French, among many others.)

3738127,4,B001P5I5ME,"A sweet yet engrossing little British television show with a really seriously top notch cast. A mite bit sacharine at times, but absolutely well worth watching nonetheless. And -- as anyone who has watched the show will empathise with -- I loved tuning in to see what the postmistress's 'one weakness' would be each episode!

Highly recommended, especially for fans of Cranford, and for anyone who loves to see stars from such shows as Ab Fab and Coupling, to name but a few.

I'm glad to see series 2 has been made, and I for one can't wait to see it.",1244678400,5,552,4.455445544554456
3738128,5,B001P5I5ME,"This is a wonderful series on BBC in England, based on Flora Thompson autobiographical trilogy ""Lark Rise to Candleford"".  Those of us in the USA would love to see it available in a DVD format that we may watch, again and again. It can easily be compared to an English village version of Little House on the Prairie or Anne of Green Gables series; both beloved classics. Crossing our fingers!",1237507200,14,392,4.6
3738129,5,B001P5I5ME,"PBS needs to snap up this gem of a show - it's utterly delightful.  I cannot wait for BBC to release a US format version.

If you have been dreaming of a weekly costume drama, it's here!  It exists!  Based (Well, perhaps loosely) on the actual diary of the ""main"" character, Laura, Lark Rise to Candleford is a gentle series about rural vs. town life in the late 1800's.

Laura is from the little hamlet, Lark Rise, and gets a position at the post office in town (Candleford) working for her mother's cousin, Dorcas the postmistress.  Through her we're introduced to all the characters in the town & village and we follow them through their little adventures.

3738130,5,B001P5I5ME,This mini series is simply fabulous for any age group any time but especially for rainy winter weeks when you don't want to leave the house.  So many tiny details of life in the 1800s spring out of the script  like measuring in chains - who knew how that was done - all wrapped up in a charming family story that moves between the up-market town and the nearby down-market village.  A timeless classic.,1519430400,,402,4.405405405405405
3738131,4,B001P5I5ME,"It's engaging, but not really funny. Cranford was rather funny, but Lark Rise to Candleford is definitely more of a drama, full of the characters' introspections, which to me gets kind of boring at times, so I often fast forward to the next scene.

My only complaint was Season 4.  Clearly the writers/creators had much more in mind and in Season 4 everything just gets thrown together and all the story lines wrap up lightening fast (given the pace of the previous seasons).

3738156,1,B001P5I5ME,"We made it through the 2nd, maybe 3rd season before we had to stop. And I can't believe we made it that far. Most of the characters just become annoying after a while.
Docas Lane: knows how to solve everyone else's problems, but not her own. She could've married her soul mate, but she was too much of a coward to, so she just has an emotional affair with him through the duration of the first season. Even my kids were disgusted with the two of them needing to consult each other on trivial matters all the time, while his neglected wife nearly went crazy over it.  What jerks! She could've married that drifter teacher who was interested in her, but she was just not up for the fight.  Oh well, Mr. Drifter Teacher.  Looks like you're just not worth the trouble. And then there's Robert, her third love interest.  I couldn't wait for that to end. NO CHEMISTRY AT ALL!
Laura: ready and willing to surrender her heart to the first, second, and third handsome boy she meets.  She hates him, no she loves him.  ugh.
Thomas: Oh, Thomas. I was rooting for you. You, who were described by your wife as the most devout man in the parish. You became nothing more than the typical portrayal of an uptight, closed-minded, God-fearing man. But more and more this is exactly how television portrays Christians  to its viewers.  I couldn't even stand to hear you or Margaret speak. So so disappointed with you.
Queenie: Now here's the woman with all the answers.  She's got the heart of gold, is able to cure all manner of illness, has keen insight into the emotional affairs of her neighbors, and enjoys friendship with all. Unfortunately, all the magic, pagan, occult (whatever you wanna call it) themes revolve around her.  She reads her neighbors' tea leaves, speaks to a ghost, even holds a seance with several respectable characters in attendance at night in the woods, but when she called upon the spirits to inhabit her body to attend to the needs of the witch tree, I'd had enough.  I can't really believe I let us get so far into this series with all this obvious witchcraft, but I guess I was really hoping it would improve and I was bored. We all were.  At least we had an interesting discussion after we turned it off about all the stuff we didn't like about it.  So, as a warning to other viewers like me, It doesn't get better. It just gets weirder.",1490313600,5,2352,4.480093676814988

3738159,2,B001P5I5ME,"I really liked this series for the first several episodes, maybe even into a second season until I realized that nothing ever happens. Literally, nothing ever changes to the characters of this story. The performances are fine, it's got the requisite period set and costumes we all look for in these things, but each episode is a slight variation of the one before it. It's sort of like a live action Sesame Street for adults only less educational and creative. I had to stop watching at a certain point--life is too short.",1489795200,,522,4.684782608695652

3738161,4,B001P5I5ME,"The show is precious. In a good way. Here are a few of my opinions and observations:
1. Lark Rise characters are more interesting and have more depth than Candlefordians. With one exception, the postmistress Miss Lane.
2. The main character is probably the most boring of all, and the love triangle in the 3rd season was hard to get through.
3. The episodes, as I said, can be a little precious, but the show maintains a light and not too serious mood throughout. It makes for a nice break from the earnestness that is prevalent in most current programming.
4. There are many one off episodes and characters, so you get some good cameos.

3738506,5,B001P5I5ME,"An excellent, almost sickly-sweet show about the various townsfolk and their various small problems and solutions to their problems.  It's nice seeing a total lack of grandiosity as the ""little people"" make their way in the world.  The first couple seasons are excellent, the next starts to have increasing problems, and from there it gets a little weird.  I can recommend the first couple seasons without any real misgivings except it is cloyingly sweet.

==============
That said, here's my criticism of where the show eventually goes after a few seasons.

I'm beginning to notice a trend with these BBC productions - sometimes the first season or two is excellent and then it's as if they feel the need to replace storytelling with agenda.  We end up watching strangers instead of the characters we first came to like.

Deeper into the show, we have men generally being depicted as silly and dumb while the women deal with weighty issues.  We have the main character saying in total seriousness that single motherhood (in what, 1805?) obviates any and all need for a man in any way (the child in question's father being a man she was in love with who she essentially stole the child from...)  We have another character huddling against a tree stump in the forest instead of living in her own house making a speech about how living with men is bad and being out in the wilderness is much better because she can ""have her own thoughts""  Just a few examples.

So there's a bit of overt man-hating that starts up by season 3 or 4 - it gets to the point where I feel like I am being beat over the head with it.  Do they just assume anyone making it to season 3-4 must be a woman, so now they're resorting to outright pandering?  It's condescending to the audience.  Are there really no more stories to tell about these characters?

We've got this freethinking stonemason character who echoes enlightenment era ideals, says anyone can better themselves and has a right to free speech... why are the writers, over and over, putting the most misogynistic lines in HIS mouth?  It makes no sense at all.  Why not the hyper-religious mail deliveryman?  Are they suggesting to us that the liberty-minded are the most prejudiced of all?

If they really want to go out of their way to examine women's roles in that time period, they could have done a lot better.  Geez.  Crack a book!  Crack a bunch of books by women of that period!  They WERE writing, you know!  There is plenty of actual, interesting, compelling history from this time period regarding women.  It's as if the show writers, choosing to set the show in this time, rather than researching the period and lovingly speaking to its people, have decided it is deplorable, no understanding or knowledge is necessary.  It is apparently enough to let us know and implicitly rail against it.

And one should not be naive.  Historically, when a segment of the population has restrictions put on them, often you find they turn around and excel in other areas.  50% of the population must definitely DID make their will felt in this time period, don't kid yourself.  While I myself prefer my own culture and time period, it's almost as if the show writers assume other cultures - this one happening to exist in a different time period - must be WRONG if they are organized differently.  Again, I greatly prefer the values of my own time period, I'm saying I don't think it is quite as SIMPLE as that, and they are bending, folding, spindling, and mutilating their characters and plot when all they really need to do is have some respect - some curiosity! - for people in that time period and tell their stories -- all the more so if they have any feminist intentions in how they are writing.  Geez.  Read some George Sand at least.  Something.  Gah.

Obviously, they had the option of just trundling along with various problems, solutions, and relationships right?  They always had that option.  They chose to ditch their successful, endearing ""small people, small problems"" format for the vague, uninformed, somewhat mean-spirited hackwork.",1483401600,3,4086,4.727015558698727

Her one failing was ""My one weakness,"" which turned out to be at least a dozen (I stopped counting then). This was one of the best series I've ever watched. It had humor, heartache, surprises, superstition, religion, and all things beautiful as well. I watched and watched and watched, and I knew I had work to do, but I put that aside and watched some more. I cannot recommend this series too highly. There is a character for everyone, and an incident to which everyone can relate. Don't miss this series, or you will regret it for the rest of your life. Somewhere, sometime, you will meet yourself in one of these characters. I met myself so often that I thought I was actually visiting my family. Just loved this series; just loved it. I'm ailing, so it was that proverbial shot in the arm that kept me going on, sometimes with a tear in my eye, sometimes with a smile on my face, and sometimes with a hearty laugh coming from way deep down inside, making me know that I was still alive. Don't miss it! You will be so glad to have watched it and gleaned insight into many facets of life that are oftentimes left unfathomed.

Watch the days unwind from the in's and out's of the patrons of the Candleford post-office and you will be tempted to take tea in the back kitchen of the Postmistress as she keeps your company and sorts out all the issues between village and town.  One must ignore the all too ironed attire and admire the costuming as well as the sweet atmosphere. No messes in the streets here.,1477612800,,538,4.536082474226804

and their changing circumstances. I did notice that the character Caroline was sent to prison and returned
home and then later the children are with Queenie and told they always have a home with her, then in a
later episode Lily goes into Caroline's empty house...??? I know I did not dream Caroline's return. Did
someone else dream it? Maybe it was another of the characters? That confused me, but the series overall
is very good. I will watch the rest of what is available on prime. I never pay for watching later seasons of
things or even episodes. If they think showing one season of something, or one episode in the case of Gilmore
Girls will make me buy it they are wrong! I normally do not like Victorian era things, but this one is good.",1477440000,,854,4.5519480519480515

It is as though these people have known each other their whole lives! Lark Rise to Candleford is meant to be a contrast of the two communities, but many times it seems as though they are one, each an extension of the other.

I have found the characters sticking with me, in my mind, and I think this is one of the best series I have ever seen. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do! Enjoy!",1477353600,3,551,3.919642857142857

3739053,5,B001P5I5ME,"I love period dramas, and no one does them better than the British. So, when  my sister, who is like-minded, highly recommended this series, I was intrigued, as I had never heard of it. Well, when I saw it was available in on Amazon Prime, I jumped at the opportunity to binge watch it.  I was not disappointed! This BBC production is top notch, with excellent production values and first rate acting.

Based upon Flora Thompson's semi-autobiographical trilogy, this four season series takes place in rural England in the latter half of the nation's nineteenth century. It explores the symbiotic relationship between the citizens of  the hamlet of Lark Rise and those of  the little neighboring town of Candleford.  They are only approximately eight miles apart, yet the differences between the two are as stark as  those between night and day.

Lark Rise is firmly entrenched in the past, almost feudal in feel, while Candleford is a bustling hub with a stake in the future. Yet, the two co-exist peacefully, united as they are by the Squire, Sir Timothy, who rules benevolently over them, master of all he surveys. The most prominent of the Lark Shire families is the Timmons family, while in Candleford, Dorcas Lane, the Post Mistress, is central to Candleford life. Dorcas is a cousin of Mrs. Timmons. So, when Laura,  the oldest Timmons child is a teenager, her parents send her to apprentice and work at the Candleford post office. It is through Laura's eyes that events unfold.

As they live their lives, the characters slowly develop. The intricate and often complex relationships that evolve  and the vicissitudes of life that engulf them capture the attention and imagination  of the viewer, keeping  the viewer enthralled. Each episode leaves the viewer wanting more. Kudos to the actors who bring each and every  character delightfully and beautifully to life. Those who love period dramas will surely love this one.",1476489600,18,1928,4.965732087227415

3739361,5,B001P5I5ME,"This series is a little different than Downton or Mr. Selfridge. The tone is a little different being that this is in a small town, country setting, and revolves around a post office. That's where all the gossip is which is a smart move for the creators. All kinds of shenanigans begin there. You get a bit of a country setting, yet, the mistress of the postal service is a well dressed and schooled woman who takes pride in her inherited work with class. A girl is forced to work with her from her country home after her mother sends her off but her father can't change the mother's mind. Home is all she's known and she somewhat helps with her siblings but after her mother gets overwhelmed and sees her daughter reading a book and ignoring her crying sibling, her mother has enough. Her father helps her cope a little and the girl takes on the new job and at night writes in her diary. The shows begin with her first person narrative of what happened that week and her feelings on it. The rest of the show plays out and she sometimes finishes with her last thoughts on the matter. The show starts out slightly slow if you're used to the fast pace show of Mr. Selfridge or Downton. It then begin to pick up when you get a view of some of the lively characters, especially a town woman who has several children and only her son who brings in the money. She then takes the cash and overspends on beer at the pub or spends it all on one big meal for the family. Soon, it gets her in trouble but she's a funny lady who's written comedic books. There comedy, a few sad times too, but overall it plays sort of like Little House On The Prairie without the heavy heavy drama.",1474416000,,1669,4.26813880126183

Some are so preposterous, so hackneyed that I'd given them a single star.  Overall it's a formula British series, beautiful production, small town with eccentric characters. If you're looking for something that'll give you an occasional laugh, an occasional tear, that's neither lowbrow nor terribly challenging, this is the series for you.",1474156800,,481,5.666666666666667

3739533,5,B001P5I5ME,"I needed a 'fix' since Downton Abbey is no more. Lark Rise to Candleford definitely did not deprive me of my love of period dramas. The amazing thing about this BBC product is that every character in this engaging drama has a story that is brought to life as the episodes progress. As the seasons and episodes play out, you find yourself appreciating the humility, loyalty, candor, and resilience of the characters of both Lark Rise and Candleford. How they coped with adversity and challenges, and rallied around each other was remarkable I found myself binge-watching as I was sucked in by each episode and I was deeply saddened when I got to the final season. I also loved the fact that the producers of the show emphasized the growth of the characters which was not sudden or abrupt but realistically developed over a period of time. The scenery from the show is breathtaking......and the theme music is elegant and haunting. I can never forget Twister Turrill proclaiming that his landlady was a 'rent snatching old hag...with a face uglier than a potato'.....Ah, Twister.....he was just one of those endearing characters that the show had so many of!",1473120000,,1156,4.843434343434343

3739551,5,B001P5I5ME,"Feeling bereft after Downton Abbey ended, I decided to try out Lark Rise to Candleford, and wow, was I rewarded for my curiosity!  I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys historical dramas.  It is set around 1895, so things are starting to change (railroads, bicycles, etc), but we haven't yet arrived at the massive changes brought about near World War I.  I found that I enjoyed the peace and tranquility of the small town life presented in Lark Rise to Candleford, but I also found myself sad on the inside, thinking about how so many of the characters (if they were real people) would have had their lives destroyed in 20 years by The Great War.

But, oh, my!  What an all-star cast.  Every once and awhile, I'd get a jolt when a new character would appear: She's from BBC's Pride & Prejudice! He's from Downton Abbey!  She's from Mansfield Park!  It was like a celebrity tour of all the best British actors, and I was constantly astounded at how good the acting was from everyone in the cast.

Also, the characters were so fun and funny and maddeningly realistic.  I loved that there weren't always happy endings, that some of the characters DON'T change for the better, even when you hope they will.  That's life, right?

And so many strong female characters!  I loved that there is such a variety of them, too. Women who have families, women who have chosen careers, and women who are still deciding who they are and what they want out of life.

The first season was definitely my favorite. I loved every episode.  Some of the stories got a little less interesting as seasons 2 - 4 progressed, but still good enough that I watched all 4. And indeed, some of my favorite events happened after the first season.",1472947200,12,1721,4.5602605863192185

3739753,5,B001P5I5ME,"Nobody does period dramas like BBC. This one emphasizes common people in a small town, and an adjacent hamlet. The actors are superb as British actors generally are. Brendan Coyle's Mr. Trimmins is notable. After four seasons BBC cancelled Lark Rise (the hamlet) to Candleford (the small town) because Bill Gallager, the creative force, refused to sign on for a fifth season in spite of a popular petition for BBC to reconsider the cancellation. Little did the public know. They loved BBC's next period drama Downton Abbey as much, if not more. Also, Brendan Coyle reappears in Downton Abbey. A Game of Thrones actress also appears in a episode of Lark Rise to Candleford. Guess who?",1470700800,,683,4.896551724137931

3740022,3,B001P5I5ME,"The BBC rolls out its stock characters in a peaceable, totally fabricated setting in a non-existent mid-Victorian England.  Cardboard cut-outs would not do justice to the depth and expansion of the actors and their acting.

Julia Sawalha is a marvel to watch.  She plays such a sweet, mature, compassionate role in Lark Rise, fun to compare to her bratty part as a younger Bennett sister in Pride and Prejudice, and her sad put-upon Saffie in AbFab.  Brendan Coyle is always great too.  This series is full of wonderful actors, I'm enjoying each segment so much!!",1468627200,,491,4.855421686746988

The inhabitants are engaging and their dialogue is well written. It took me a couple of episodes before I really cared about the inhabitants, but once I became hooked, I binged. Twister, who is an irascible old coot who likes whiskey and hates work, is a scene stealer par excellence.  A good view.",1468540800,,450,4.69620253164557

3740094,5,B001P5I5ME,"Marvelously well-rendered English period piece, which perhaps was the inspiration for Downton Abbey. Like Downton, the many fascinating characters have intricate relationships, joys, and tragedies. Brendan Coyle (who plays Bates in Downton) has a leading role, and the rest of the cast is entirely outstanding as well. The writing is superb, and based on a biography of the same name, describing life in two villages in the 1880's; the small, rustic Lark Rise, and the much larger and prosperous Candleford.
The entire class structure from laborers to aristocracy are engaged.",1468540800,,576,5.411111111111111

3740195,4,B001P5I5ME,"Pros:
Carefully and nicely directed.
Sensitive and insightful revelations of beauty of marriage, friendship, family, faith, rural life.
Nice variety of amusing and lively characters who are believable.
Poignant and ""deeper"" than most of these romanticized mini-series.
Usual PBS charm - period costumes, horse and carriage, pastoral vistas, smiles and tears.

Cons:
Historically inaccurate language, conversation, customs.
Formulaic plots and stereotyped biases; this worsens in 3rd season.
Terrible syntax errors in spots, especially considering this is, after all, British!
Heavy imposition of ""post-modern"" views obscures the gentle loveliness and authenticity of Thompson's novel.

Summary:  if you like this type of romanticized, simplified view of life in Victorian rural England, you'll enjoy it!  Because it's based on a novel by a woman who lived through it, this is better than most stories of this type.  Delightful, funny, touching, and relaxing to watch.",1467763200,3,967,5.829787234042553

3740224,5,B001P5I5ME,"Of course, I watched this to see more of Brendan Coyle, but I also love period pieces.  I was looking for something to watch after Downton Abbey.  This definitely fit the bill.  The stories were family friendly, and usually there was a moral some lesson to learned whether it was prejudice, making assumptions, greed, or something to do with all type of relationships:  between sisters, parents and child, and of course the romantic type.  There some grown-up type themes, that would be over the head of most children, although teenagers would probably pick them up. Some of the stories have a sense of the macabre, adventure, and of course drama. I haven't quite watched the whole series, but I have seen enough to recommend it.",1467504000,,729,4.8

The whole series is heartwarming without being overly sentimental. The overall series plot is reminiscent of a simpler time and place, reminding us of our heritage and the source of our root values.

The story line continually hits home to my emotions, morality and sensitivity to others. It feels like a mixture of Downton Abbey, Little House on the Prairie and a smattering of Dr. Quin, Medicine Woman.

It's wonderful to escape today's sordid realities, while seeing just how things always are, so well put by the French, ""Plus a change, plus c'est la mme chose."" We say it in a similar way: ""The more things change, the more they stay the same."" Greed for wealth and position have stalked us humans throughout our our history.

I like that while there is some continuity over the series, each episode has a good standalone story that leaves you feeling upbeat rather than some of the depressing downer series that there are too many of. The Brits have a way of getting more out of a simple story line without resorting to gimmicks and special effects. Good acting goes a long way too. My TV is getting more use now that I can stream what I like when I want to see it. I almost gave up TV when US networks offer mainly insipid ""comedies"", reality shows, edgy crime or fantasy shows, and way too much focused and biased ""news"" without really telling what is happening in the world.",1465776000,,723,4.526717557251908

Can't give it enough accolades for good old fashion storytelling in this day of reality shows and nonsense.

I don't know why I decided to give it a chance, but I'm glad I did. The casting and acting is very well done. I realized the main character, Dorcas Lane, is the actress who played in Pride and Prejudice (Colin Firth version) as the younger, empty-headed sister. She did a great job portraying this character, but does an even better job of portraying Candleford's postmistress. Brendan Coyle is also one of my favorite British actors after I saw his abilities in Downton Abbey and North and South.",1465344000,,666,4.6525423728813555

3741247,5,B001P5I5ME,"Flora Thompson s trilogy (written between 1939  1943) of auto-biographical fictional novels were strongly influenced by events in her own life.  They take place in Oxfordshire, England  at the end of the 19th Century -- in both the fictional poor town of Lark Rise and the nearby richer marketing town of Candleford.  It is seen mainly through the eyes of young teenager Laura Timmins who goes to work for Dorcas Lane, her Mothers Cousin and Postmistress, in the Post Office in Candleford.  The adventures involve the entwinement of both towns and its citizens  with much rival between the two -- and the focal point is the growing friendship between Laura and Dorcas.  The many characters are lovingly developed until you feel like they are family.  There are (4) Seasons and plenty of varied stories to keep your interest.  If you are a watcher of BBC One and PBS, youll recognize many of the actors  and the Narrator.  These Series aired between 2008 and 2011  in both the UK and US.",1464998400,,986,4.735294117647059

In that sense, it feels more like Little House on the Prairie than Downton Abbey.",1464220800,,393,4.865671641791045

First, there is the nostalgia factor, in that the central character is ""remembering"" what it was like to be 16, and it's adorable to watch her journey of discovery (most often she needs to discover that the world does not entirely revolve around her!).  The entire cast of characters is populated with very real, very human and generally good people played by spectacularly good actors.  The stories are well-told, the cinematography is impeccable, and the music is warm, lively, and effective.

The biggest problem I have is with Julia Sawalha's portrayal of Dorcas Lane. She always has that smarmy, phony, annoying smile, and is right up in everyone's face with it. She invades everyone's space, and gets too close to people, even strangers. Her over-the-top acting ruins what could have been a great character.",1463702400,,433,4.786666666666667

3741802,4,B001P5I5ME,"I'm binge watching this series; I'm midway through the third of four seasons. This is obviously a sanitized and romanticized version of 1890s life in an English hamlet and a small town.  Having not read the novel on which the series is based, I'm  curious about whether the original work may have presented more realistically the living conditions and culture of the setting.  As is frequently the case with television series, plot lines often don't make sense or are abruptly abandoned; characters are awkwardly written out, or simply vanish. This having been said, it is still a charming and engaging series, full of character development and presentation of the thinking of characters in that time and place. Serious, sometimes tragic, topics and situations are introduced, and are handled with varying levels of believeability. Overall, however, the series is lighthearted and optimistic.  It is well acted, with especially good performances by Brendan Cole (Robert Timmins), Claudie Blakley (Emma Timmins), and Linda Bassett (Queenie Turrill).",1463184000,,1048,5.411042944785276

How they are solved tells this tale.,1463184000,,326,4.423728813559322

3741833,5,B001P5I5ME,"I love this series.  The characters are multi-dimensional: they can be gentle, irritable, stupid, clever and funny.  There's something to like in each one, but they each have little surprises.  The costuming is gorgeous, but I like that women sometimes wear the same dress in different episodes.  Each episode can stand alone, but there are stories that develop over time.",1463097600,,372,5.15

3741847,1,B001P5I5ME,"Very contrived. If you like period shows, avoid this one. While set in late 19th century England with the actors wearing period clothing, that's as far as it gets to the reality of the time.  The acting is fine, but the writing is terrible.  Story after story tries to cast today's ideals onto those of 150/years ago.  So unrealistic and so badly done.",1463097600,5,352,4.555555555555555

3741866,5,B001P5I5ME,"""Lark Rise to Candleford"" is  yet another in the wonderful group of costume dramas presented by the BBC.  I thoroughly enjoyed Season 1 and am presently in the process of enjoying Season 2 just as much if not more.  The excellent cast is partly made up of old friends, including the incredible Brendan Coyle (Mr. Bates) of ""Downton Abbey"" fame, as well Claudie Blakley and the sparkling Julia Sawalha from ""Cranford.""
  Set in the mid-1880s, the series details the stories of the people of two neighboring towns in Victorian England, lower-class Lark Rise and burgeoning middle-class Candleford.  Just as with the earlier ""Cranford,"" there is a sweetness to this series, a faith in the goodness of the average person.  Do bad things happen to these good people on occasion?  Of course.  In the end, though, one leaves each episode of the show feeling better about these characters, which for me speaks volumes about why ""Lark Rise to Candleford"" is such a success.",1463011200,2,964,4.901234567901234

3742122,5,B001P5I5ME,"A delightful narrative of country life in the 1800's, Lark Rise to Candleford details the concerns of country life, as well as the ups and downs of marriage, and the coming of age of one of the main characters. The characters are diverse and richly depicted in their settings, either the tiny village of Lark Rise, or the post office in Candleford. At this time in history (I'm not exactly sure of the date), the post office was a hub of activity. It also doubled as a home with dormitories for the workers. The post mistress is a complex character who counsels all who come to her with wisdom and compassion as she sorts out the many little trials, tribulations, and conflicts that occur around her. She also must come to terms with her own life and the decisions she has made to become the spinster she is. I've found the series to be quite enjoyable.",1461715200,,853,4.4743589743589745

Lark Rise to Candleford is not like any show on American TV: no one gets voted out of the village, it's not trashy or flashy, it doesn't star drunken housewives from anywhere.  (Ok, except Caroline Arless...)  It's a quiet show telling the story of life in the late 1900's English countryside.  The characters and stories feel real.  I have not seen any truly manufactured plotlines yet, although I'm not quite done with the whole series.  If you watch British television regularly, you'll see some of your favorite actors, including Brenden Coyle, Dawn French, and Claudie Blakley.

This was such a nostalgic show for me evoking the charming close knit family culture I left behind after immigrating. The episodes were poignant sad exhilarating and insightful in turns. However life was quite sugar coated and as a TV mandate, problems were solved during the episode cleanly and surgically. Wish life was as easy. The corn fields, the post, office, the farm were such a strong part of the story and made it so much more than a typical costume drama. The story telling without vulgarity violence and gore made a good break from Game of Thrones.",1461542400,,712,4.658730158730159

After starting episodes of other series and not finding them enjoyable I decided to give Lark Rise to Candleford a go. I am hooked now.

3742277,5,B001P5I5ME,"This is an outstanding series  about a small town and the adjacent hamlet in rural England  ion the late 1800s.  It has a romantic and sentimental view but that would be expected in a dreamy personal history written in a time when peril and danger seemed unavoidable (the book was published in three volumes in 1939).  I have also read the book and while the series follows more of the idea than the text, they did get it right.  The author was worried that the era would disappear completely and be forgotten amidst the flurry of changes such as automobiles, airplanes and World Wars; and it largely has, beyond this and a few other  memoires of  the era.  The narrative is largely wound around the coming-of-age of one young girl but she is also learning a good bit about society in general, which really had not penetrated her hamlet home.  So if you are looking for intrigue, murder mysteries, car chases and the like, this is the exact opposite -- it is old-fashioned storytelling with a wide scope.",1461110400,,1004,4.595505617977528

3742279,5,B001P5I5ME,"It was one of the most realistic of human interfaces and was splendidly acted out. We have been a fan of British/English television drama coupled through first hand knowledge from a first person account of what life was like in England eighty-five years ago. You see a lady we know lived through the era of WWII as a 17 year old and has relived many of her childhood memories for us. The hamlets illustrated in the series were just as she described them with everyone knowing EVERYTHING about everyone within twenty miles. The only purpose for a newspaper was to see who got caught. The costumes and dress code as well as the speech were very realistic for this time period. As time passed new inventions, attitudes, progress and customs were developed in keeping with the actual time of the day. All in all you felt as though you really got to know the characters as they were developed and they grew older in real life and on the set.",1461024000,3,936,4.511764705882353

3742383,5,B001P5I5ME,"This is a lovely BBC mini-series based upon the recollections of Flora Thompson.  It is set during the end of the 19th century during a time when there is still some remnant of feudalism left, but also the beginnings of change are on the horizon.  The stories center around Laura Timmens, who is pushed out into the world by her Mother with the arrival of a new baby into the household.  While not very far away by today's standards, she enters the world by assisting her mother's postmistress cousin in the snobbier town of Candleford.  Laura quickly adapts to Candleford and although she doesn't fully realize it, she does begin to outgrow her hamlet of Lark Rise.  Something which begins to trouble her Mother underneath, although, she isn't fully aware of it. Also a mainstay of this Season 1 is the unrequited love between the dashing nobleman and the postmistress.  Class distinctions being a part of the culture, their love is an impossibility.  But their affections for one another are still very much present, although, the local nobleman is married to a lady of his class and she suffers much due to not having her husband's full attention. The spinster Pratt sisters provide comic relief at various times throughout the series.  And the charmingly awkward romance between the minister's daughter and the very Christian mail carrier is also sweet.  It would be tempting to dismiss this series as feel good frippery, except that it actually has a lot of social commentary throughout the stories and it emphasizes different aspects that everyone faces in life.  It is excellently done and has quickly become one of my favorite BBC series, ever.",1459641600,,1652,4.888888888888889

3742388,4,B001P5I5ME,"My wife and I started this series and overall enjoyed it very much. Great cast, well written. However, I must say that I find the portrayal of the Christians troubling. The mail carrier, who quotes scripture is portrayed as a bimbo and an Idiot, the local rector is cold and judgmental and not the least bit endearing. Those who are ""progressive"" in their thinking are all wise, all knowing. I know the entertainment industry despises Christianity and it is very evident here. The Christians that I know, and believe me they are not perfect, are kind and giving and sacrificial. That is my only complaint with this otherwise excellent show. Give us a break man.

I started watching the series, Lark Rise to Candleford through Episode 2 and was enjoying it so much that I thought my husband may also enjoy watching the rest of the series with me.  It's a wonderful story told in the early 1900's in Great Britain about the life and times of the very poor living in the parish of Lark Rise and the prosperous living in the community of Candleford; about a rock's throw from each other.  The characters are so unique; our favorites being Minnie & Miss Lane, Emma & Robert, Queenie & Twister.  It is a tender, lighthearted story with humor and romance, focusing on the struggles and the innocence of that time.  It was very refreshing.  My husband and I both enjoyed the series!

This is a feel-good series and although it has its share of troubles, conflicts and woes, each episode has a positive resolution while maintaining some threads of on-going relational challenges and open issues that keep you hooked. The acting is superb and the costumes and scenery are just great. You grow to love some of the characters so much that  you miss them when it is over! But then, you can just watch it again!
This is something the whole family can watch, although I doubt the little ones would be interested; but definitely 8 and up could enjoy this. Some may want to know that there is a mother of many with a drinking problem and she goes to jail for awhile because she fails to pay her debts but, instead, spends her money on alcohol.

3742619,5,B001P5I5ME,"I LOVE British programs.  There are two things in particular that I enjoy.  The first is the acting.  The actors look like real people instead of made up glamorous dolls that you usually see in American productions AND they can really act.  Big named stars with great training appear in regular programs.  That is the case with this one, Lark Rise to Candleford.  The acting is everything a British program might be expected to be.  The second thing I like are the sets.  The locations in this series are interesting.

The story is a bit sappy, but that is to be expected since it is an ACTUAL autobiography journal of a real person.  This is a series I would recommend to anyone who likes British series.  If you loved Pie in the Sky or The Darling Buds of May, you'll love this series.  If you haven't seen these two, get them.",1418083200,,829,4.417218543046357

It contrasts a rural farm community of Lark Rise against it's neighbor, Candleford, another rural community, yet more cosmopolitan in attitude and living style. The portrayals of the townspeople are seemingly impeccable and costumes are beautiful and appropriate to their income and characters.

""forbidden "" love between the postmistress and the town squire, is getting a bit stale. My friend watches it with sub-titles, because

3742756,5,B001P5I5ME,"Found out about this show from an Amazon advertisement.  Was a little skeptical as to the value of the show since it seemed like a soap opera set in days of old.  However, as I continued watching, the characters and story development took hold, and I am now hooked!  Have to be careful and not watch too many of the shows, or it will all be over in no time!  So, each afternoon, during rest time, I gleefully look forward to the show and what might happen next in the story.  Love the characters especially Brendon Coyle (fell in love with him in Downtown Abbey...so good!)...such a reliable actor with excellent acting skills.  The two sisters ( Matilda Ziegler, Victoria Hamilton) are a hoot, Twister is a delight, and I would love to have a one on one conversation with Queenie.  British actors are so reliable with their skills and talent.  Anyone interested should watch the first season...after that you won't miss the rest of them!",1415836800,,938,4.608433734939759

3742759,4,B001P5I5ME,"Great show, well written with characters who tend to be stereotypical of types. Much of the season was predictable but with plot twists that added to the richness of the tale. The romance with the Squire had to end as it was too powerful and determined to destroy too many lives. Once the Squire goes to London, there is no pairing for the character of Dorcas and she loses her energy and seems less youthful. Settings are fabulous with the contrasts between the hamlet of Lark Rise and the more metropolitan scene in Candleford.

I must admit that I love the characters of Pearl and Ruby Pratt; specifically Ruby Pratt as the younger sister does not seem to be bound by the stiff rules that haunt her elder sister. At times, Ruby's behavior is delightful, refreshing and shows the growth that can be in characters in a series of this type. I don't see this growth in Dorcas as she seems to be sprung from the head of Zeus fully developed, so to speak.

Overall, I have enjoyed the series and will continue to watch into Season Two.",1415836800,,1032,4.48404255319149

Mind you, I'm a full time worker, so this is not about me finding something to do.

We see wise, gentle commentary on our weaknesses and heartfelt celebration of our humanity.  This is more than a TV show; it touches and enriches our lives, the way good literature and cinema are won't to do.  Sure, it's a bit schmaltzy at times, a bit predictable, maybe, but the acting and the staging make us feel like these are real people in a real place.  Julia Sawalha is marvelous; she does more acting with the nuanced tilt of her head and flash of her eyes than most actors bring to bear in total.  Enjoy!",1414800000,,725,4.262773722627737

The eccentricities of all the diverse characters, their complex machinations, their own well-written stories makes this show completely consume you.

  And, Dorcas Lane, is extraordinary (as Minnie would cleverly say) in that she is that type of indomitably, unforgettably clever characters, of such tall stature, that I swear the day I meet her in person, I might just lose it altogether. These characters are so fully fleshed out that they feel so real, and it's hard to even convey this to you, until you've seen this series for yourself.

I find the actors refreshingly new and believable most of the times. There are agnostics, evolutionists, Christians, and those who believe in superstitions passed down through the ages much like our folklores and various groups within our country. This is a series that teaches good moral values and appropriate for the most part for the whole family. It actually has all 4 Seasons attached but once you get through the first Season and into the next ones, in order to ""resume"" watching, you must click the ""Next"" button all the way through Season One and subsequent ones to get back to your resume point which is a bit irritating.

And the simplicity depicted, calmer speaking, and kindness, thoughtfulness.

The setting is of two small communities, one wealthier, and self appointed more refined,
verse the working class, with less means, but strong camaraderie, social comradeship.

A show that requires one to slow down, and rewards by leaving you calmer then you where.
The fabric of the script? Honestly - morality - kindness - romance,
and the best humans can be in hard times.

After racing through Season 1, I have decided to ration the rest to no more that 2 a day because I don't want it to end. If you enjoy historical novels or period drama, this one is sure to be a winner. The sets and costumes are done with the usual BBC attention to detail and watching Lark transports me to a simpler time. Brendon Coyle is wonderful as Robert Timmins; so much so that I occasionally want to smack him a good one. If, however, fast pace and action are what you crave, this may not hold your attention so I would stream an episode or 2 before you buy the DVDs.

The sound quality is typical of BBC productions and combined with the various accents make it somewhat difficult for those of us with aging hearing to understand.

Even the lighter plots are satisfying.  New characters are introduced naturally and the writers take advantage of the strengths (sometimes quirks) that the new actors bring with them.

The so called ""towns people in Candleford"" and the farmers and poorer people in the country ""Lark Rise"". The series centers around the little post office in Candleford and how the people interact with the less fortunate people in Lark Rise and a little bit of  upper class that lives in a castle of sorts. This series, as well as the following other 3 Seasons - 4 Seasons in all- show the ups and downs of the people in their daily lives.

Lark Rise to Candleford is the best of all that I have watched, and I have watched them all (or am working my way through them). I thought nothing could top ""Sherlock"" with BC and Martin Freeman (loved him on the British version of The Office), but this show is now my all time favorite. With most series, you get emotionally invested in a few of the characters, but with LR2C, all the characters work their way into your heart. Truly a wonderfully produced series. Excellent character casting. (If you are a Downton Abbey fan, you will really enjoy seeing Brendan Coyle). You are missing out if you don't watch it. I have seriously considered buying all the seasons and I never buy shows that I can watch for free. This is a show the whole family can enjoy.

There is mild tension between the more affluent city-dwellers of Candleford and their poorer neighbors in Lark Rise. The drama challenges the injustice of a privileged aristocracy as well as the prejudices of some of those who oppose them. But there is little to really excite me: no unsolved mysteries or terror-inducing violence. This is just a story about people journeying through life and being changed.

Set in the late 1800's in England, the stories tell of the relationships of the people and events in two neighboring communities. Lark Rise is the home of a small group of rural poor English folk and Candleford is the nearby town composed of more wealthy residents. The tales are told through the voice of a young woman from Lark Rise who goes to Candleford to work in the Post Office there. Since the post office is at the center of most people's lives in this era, the young narrator has a special insight into the strains caused by class distinction according to wealth and birthright or lack of it. The day-to-day details of residents' lives spill out of the TV and capture our imaginations and our minds/hearts and weave us into the lives of the townsfolk.

3743672,5,B001P5I5ME,"Here's a charming story of two communities in the early 1900's in England... and all trials and tribulations and joys experienced by a group of characters you will not soon forget.  The characters are believable, the dialogue is sharp, witty, and poignant. I found myself immersed in the beauty of the English countryside and the lives of the characters. The only flaw is the abrupt way the story ends... it leaves you with too many unanswered questions and feeling a bit cheated.  The last season was only six episodes and many of the characters and stories were left hanging uncomfortably.  I had the feeling that there were many missing episodes that were simply dropped off the schedule.  The stories, however, are charming and the overall experience was a pleasant relief from life in this insane world.",1405814400,,808,4.919117647058823

3743733,2,B001P5I5ME,"Very rustic. Very, very cute. We usually enjoy these English period pieces but after watching the first episode of this we debated whether we should try the second. We decided to give it a chance. I suppose it's not really fair to review it based on two episodes but we couldn't take any more of it. If we'd watched the whole thing, it would have turned our brains to oatmeal. I'm trying to think of something positive to say about it so you understand why I gave it more than one star ...

OK. Here are the good points. The yokels are clean and well-dressed. They don't swear, though some of them drink beer. They don't till the fields. The cast is a good one and tries hard - if they'd all played it as comedy (as Dawn French did), the show might have been worth watching.

I find the attention to historical detail in the show amazing and interesting to watch. I ignored it for a time because I didn't understand the title. It is explained in the very first episode.

3743770,5,B001P5I5ME,"This review encompasses seasons 1-3, rather than only one. I feel that my appreciation for the entire story is best told after viewing a number of episodes. Also, it has taken some time for me to be able to articulate what I find so appealing in these seemingly simple stories of country life in England.

When I tried to come up with proper adjectives to describe the show, I found myself using rather clichd and Pollyannaish words--nice, sweet, etc. But then I realized that there was no fault in finding a show simply pleasant. And that word- pleasant- has become my adjective of choice.

It seems as if many movies and television shows reveal the worst of the world, perhaps so that we can appreciate the goodness that does exist in our more mundane lives, and in most people.  But this approach can obviously lead to a warped view, and an oft depressing one. ""Lark Rise"" has the courage to show a more normal world where most people are basically good. Where the ""villains"" more often act thoughtlessly, rather than with malice, and are usually ""rehabilitated"" by the end of the episode. It is a show where people apologize when they err, and seek to smooth over conflict and differences, and, again, succeed by the end of the episode.

Some characters are perhaps caricatures, but they are extremes of virtue, honesty, self righteousness, and perhaps foolishness, But not of evil and greed.

Were this show one of many that may have existed 40, or maybe 50 years ago, it might have been just one of many-- the shows that hid us from the more stark realities that do exist in life.  But there is no risk that now we are sheltered by what we see and hear. ""Lark Rise"" is not simply ""Father Knows Best"" with an English accent. And if it is ""pleasant"", so be it.

And ""Lark rise"" is not without its own life's lessons. But they are told with a gentle subtlety that is convincing but not unnecessarily complex.

The show is also beautifully filmed, well acted, and with wonderful costumes.

I feel as though I have written an apology rather than a recommendation. The simplest thing I can say is that I enjoy this wonderfully filmed, well acted, often humorous, always insightful, and gloriously pleasant show.",1404172800,3,2211,4.648717948717949

All the principal players skills are making re react with laughter, tears, interest, concern, and compassion.

I was totally surprised by how optimistic and warm I felt after only one of two episodes and had to watch the rest.  The two communities of Lark Rise and Candleford illustrate how supportive people can be in the successful handling of problems that might come up.  The postmistress Miss Lane is so engaging, you can't wait to know how she will handle the next situation of personalities that mingle and clash in this small town and hamlet close by.

These aren't exactly the same since it takes place in old England small towns and communities, but the characters draw you in to their simple lives and going on.

The acting is excellent, the scenery is beautiful; hubby and I  enjoyed this very much, and the following seasons as well.  However, I am periodically taken aback by various things that just don't seem historically accurate for the time and place, unlike series like Cranford and even Upstairs Downstairs that seem to be a little closer to truth in expressing that historical period.

Reminds me of my childhood when we were very poor and had to pool efforts to make ends meet and keep food on the table. Our upbringing wasn't in the midst of taverns and drinking folks we were more anchored in the rock of salvation. Anyway it's a great depiction of life for poor folks in the UK in earlier times.

The setting is mostly historically accurate, with a few small errors that do not detract from the plots at all.

The lives being intertwined from the hamlet at Lark Rise to the town of Candleford, but the distinct social classes remaining were very moving and enjoyable!  Similar in genre to the series Cranford.",1400198400,,356,4.515625

I find it delightfully entertaining with a similarly enticing character development, subtle humor, and a touching plot line. People are quite similar whether they come from the upper levels of society or from the lower ranks; these folks run the gamut from noble to asinine, with all shades in between.

Good episodal plots but suggest you do as we did and use Amazon Prime to start with Season 1 Episode 1.  Most episodes are a story in themselves, but to truly benefit from the plots the background of each character is essential and builds with each episode as does real life.  The HD photography alone, with excellent period clothing and sets, makes this program worth watching.  Don't spoil it by watching later seasons or episodes, just enjoy the run!

I have seen many shows about the affluent and upper crust in 19th and early 20th century society in th UK but never any about the tiny hamlets or even the bustling ""towns"".  It is witty and charming.  The only thing that I don't appreciate is that the writers? try too hard to show Miss Lane's disdain for any type of religious association.  It seems to be a recurring theme in many episodes.  It is a wholesome and thoroughly entertaining show.  But it does make anyone that entertained the notion of believing in God as foolish.  I love so many of the characters, great character development.  I look forward to seeing other shows that are written for a wide audience.  I, personally, love period dramas.

People who inspire us to be the best of ourselves even in times of adversity. Characters who show us mature relationships and how to have peace in the home.

Truly top notch.  The storylines are developed from what in the original memoirs (Flora Thompson) may have been only a brief mention of a person or practice.  The characters develop and interact across the four seasons in sometimes surprising ways, and one can tell that the actors enjoy their tasks, depicting them.  The composer of the show's theme music is some kind of genius, making the first few phrases slightly, enticingly irregular in length.",1398297600,,761,5.015873015873016

3744006,4,B001P5I5ME,I have really enjoyed this program. It is very well done. The scenes would seem to be accurate in their portrayal of the time period. The acting is believable. Many have stirred real emotions. Overall a very wholesome program. Just a couple of criticisms. 1. The postman who is a dedicated Christian is often presented as stiff and fanatical as a Christian. That would not have had to be that way was portrayed. Once in a while he is presented in a positive way but mostly he is stiff and fanatical. 2. The writers just had to work into the script at least one program that I watched so far where an Atheist was cast in somewhat of a hero type character. There was no valid reason why that particular scenario had to be drawn. Someone was using the program to make a point and that lessons the purity of a good program like this.,1397520000,,829,4.354838709677419

3744063,5,B001P5I5ME,"The program could be subtitled ""The postmistress knows best"". The stories are well written and well acted. The series provides some insights into Victorian era England and some of the dynamics between a very poor village (Lark Rise) and a slightly wealthier small town (Candleford). While the area is under the control of the local Squire, the real source of guidance is the postmistress. Educational, insightful and very entertaining.

I feel as though I've been plucked from this modern world and allowed to reside for a short time among new friends and neighbors, in the sweet simplicity of life in the late 1800's. Not to say that their lives are easy, but that they seem to appreciate what they accomplish and have a spirit of community, in spite of social classes. These characters come to life and will remain as dear friends long after the series ends.",1396137600,,521,4.4375

I was hooked quickly after first viewing an episode which aired on PBS.  The characters are well developed, full of human failings and lovable even when they're being bad.

8332132,5,B001P5I5ME,"The first season of the series Lark Rise to Candleford is one of my all time favorites; but for all the wrong reasons. LRtC is a show that tries to come off as moralistic and righteous but fails miserably in its attempts. The reason for this is because of the characters and how incredibly dumb they are; regardless of their upper or lower class upbringing they all come off as equal in their stupidity. The character backgrounds are fleshed out enough for the audience to care and relate, but it`s the stories and the morals put in place and how they deal with them that make them come off as idiots; and it`s wonderful.

 I don`t know if you`re the kind of viewer that loves to watch certain things because you love to hate them or not but I sure am; at least when it comes to LRtC. The mixture of everything right when it comes to making a show along with the terrible story plot points and conclusions are just too infectious to ignore. They`re like a fabulous train wreck (In example only) where you can`t take your eyes off as it`s about to happen and the train`s filled with everyone you hate. It all crescendos in an orgiastic explosion of wonderful viewing topped off with mind boggling writing that asks the viewers to suspend disbelief to accept what they`ve just experienced; no, it`s not as bad as Paul WS Anderson or Michael Bay, but close.

 The pros: Great acting, amazing sets, wonderful lighting (I kid you not, it almost looks like a Thomas Kinkade painting most of the time), incredible music (Downloaded the opening theme I`m so hooked, now as my ringtone), gorgeous period attire thanks to the shows stupendous Wardrobe department, locations, direction, camera work, you name it, it all just about works and looks classy, Artful, and tasteful.

 The Cons (Even though a number of them work for me for said reasons): Horribly dumb story writing, plot points, conclusions, forgotten about morals and values that are set up but left in shambles, the asking of viewers to suspend disbelief because 99% of the time the stories go nowhere due to garbage threading together of story lines, and lastly, drama for dramas` sake to keep the series going when it basically concluded in seasons one (Think Downton Abbey which was a crap show even during the first season).

 I can`t say enough about how much I genuinely like the first season of this series. Even with the dumb characters and their stories I find myself enjoying repeated viewings thanks to how much I wish them all ill. Two of my favorites that I love to hate, although I basically hate them all, are Twister and Zilla who are like adult children. Their selfishness and disgusting nature effect everyone they supposedly care about and infect with their poor decisions and bitterness. The show rewards you, however, in the last episode of season one by making you want to get up and applaud (I know I did) when something wonderful happens to one of their story lines; a real unexpected treat and one I`ll always appreciate out of the plethora of shows that are out there.

 Yes; do buy the first season of LRtC as I can`t recommend it more highly; just keep in mind that everything changes in the later seasons for the worse (Yes, it can happen), except the acting. I give it five stars as it deserves it for all the wrong reasons. It`s a disaster I never get tired of and I feel you won`t either.",1526947200,,3373,4.597337770382696

8332136,5,B001P5I5ME,I absolutely loved this series and am very sad that there are no more episodes to watch.  Most everything works out in the end on this series but I couldn't help but fall in love anyway.  The characters are so good and endearing.  It's a wonderful show to watch with the family.  I highly recommend this show to any and all who love a good period piece that is wholesome enough for the family to watch together.,1523404800,,411,4.298701298701299
