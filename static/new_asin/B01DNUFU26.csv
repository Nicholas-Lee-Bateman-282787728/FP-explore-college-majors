8756477,2,B01DNUFU26,"While watching I noticed A LOT of errors in translation as well as errors in when the words appear (sometimes making it almost impossible to understand and read)...... It was still watchable, but not great quality.... plus the cover was spotted.",1497484800,,245,5.0
8756478,2,B01DNUFU26,"The subtitles are either missing, poorly timed, or incorrect.
The instant video on amazon is WAY BETTER! but season 3 isn't available.",1488844800,,134,5.136363636363637
8756479,3,B01DNUFU26,"The sound was slightly off from the mouth movement. The subtitles were even more off than that, resulting in a lot of stop and go playing. Really irritating, I can't even watch the show. I've seen this in a better quality online and I know that it could be better, I just don't know why it wasn't. I love this show but I'm very disappointed with the quality.",1473724800,4,358,4.279411764705882
8756480,3,B01DNUFU26,"I haven't watched all the discs yet. I have seen this series previously and because of that am well aware of the quality deficit. I will say that to get all three seasons at this price is still a positive for me. So far, however, the timing of the subs, the editing and content of the subs, the audio quality and video quality are all not very good. Poorer audio and video quality were somewhat expected since all three seasons were on three discs. The subs could have been so much better though. Fan subs would have been better. The quality is adequate to convey the story, so far. I may update later if I notice anything else. I did add a couple of snapshots to give some idea of picture quality and the types of errors most common in sub editing. They do not, sadly, convey the distracting timing of the subs.",1470528000,9,812,4.313725490196078

8756482,2,B01DNUFU26,Subtitles aren't all there and there is a lot of misspelling. There is at least one missing episode. Kind of disappointing.,1467590400,3,123,4.904761904761905
8756483,3,B01DNUFU26,Came before estimated date. Wonderful quality but the subtitles became almost impossible to read. If that was fixed it'd be five stars but the subs bring it down to three.,1464825600,,171,4.733333333333333
