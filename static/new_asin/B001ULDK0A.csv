8344437,3,B001ULDK0A,"This DVD is just what the Doctor ordered.  I'm not going to give it 5 stars because its not Hollywood value, (its filmed in a real sprout farm).  It does cover most if not all sprouts, and shows two major spouts in depth.  you can figure out any with this video.

Clearly, if you want only ONE video on sprouting I would pick this one over anything else.

Well recommend.",1264204800,,371,4.242857142857143
8344438,1,B001ULDK0A,"Poor audio and production. If your looking for just very basic sprouting info, this video isn't the worst I've seen.
The only sprouting he shows in detail is wheatgrass and sunflower (everything else just gets a brief mention and vague info on soaking/grow time). I assumed from the reviews and the price that I would see much more about mold control/storing/how long each type last etc... I would love to send this back but DVD's aren't returnable so I'll just chalk it up to buyer beware.  VERY unsatisfied.",1258761600,9,509,4.784090909090909
8344439,5,B001ULDK0A,"I have been looking for an insurance policy for food if and when the SHTF...and sprouts are the best way, most food value, you can eat them raw or cook them, they will last 2000 years or more, and they could be lived on 100% if you had to - and you may end up with better health then had you been eating the normal junk we eat day to day.

This DVD will show you how to grow and prepare them, and make the process simple.

I have read so much on the net about how to sprout, but paying for this DVD was the best investment I could make in my family's future.

Great value!",1255219200,3,572,3.871794871794872
8344440,5,B001ULDK0A,"We live on sprouts at our house---as a cancer survivor, I eat brocolli sprouts everyday. I even built a big sprouting cabinet to grow sprouts for my small herd of dairy goats. It's a great and healthful way to supplement their diets. This video is the definitive word on sprouting. I sent one to each of my nieces!",1243036800,8,314,4.431034482758621
8344441,5,B001ULDK0A,"Plain and simple: if you want, like I did, to learn how to sprout, without fuse, mess, without special equipment or costly supplies, this is it.  Shows how to do it all with things that are around the house or easy and cheap to get, no special 'sprouter' needed - that will save you time and train you if you don't have access to a sprouter.  Who needs it anyway - the sprouts do all the work if you follow this DVD training!  Full marks!",1240444800,3,438,4.129411764705883
8344442,5,B001ULDK0A,"I was not really thinking about the end of the world, (as much as I like to watch zombie movies :) , when I ordered this.  I just needed to know how to grow sprouts.  I'd tried before, I had all that was needed, (more then I needed), I just did not have anyone show me how.  That's why I am praising this DVD.  It is fantastic, the teacher is very clear, funny and has lots of knowledge to spare.  If you want to sprout, this will teach you.

Now that I know how, I still hope its not the end of the world soon! :)",1239753600,,514,3.80188679245283
8344443,5,B001ULDK0A,"Not a lot to say, this DVD WILL show you, without any doubt, how to sprout.  Sprouting has to be the best kept secret - if you are making provisions for the future, get this DVD and watch it a few times - it will make the difference between eating well, and wondering what went wrong with all your seeds.",1238457600,,304,4.066666666666666
8344444,5,B001ULDK0A,"Needs to be watched by anyone who wants to survive! 100% info on how to sprout for pennies a day.  All types of sprouts and methods.  I have tried to learn this before, but too often the directions on sprouting came from the people selling me the seeds, and sadly they were lacking.  So I did some checking and many in the community suggested or recommended this DVD.  I can see why, this is the how-to of how-to's (for sprouting!).

It won't fail you - learn, save, survive and live!",1237680000,,484,4.333333333333333
8344445,5,B001ULDK0A,"...knowing that you will have plenty of food to eat, and food that is nutritious and healthy, and VERY inexpensive is going to be the difference of life or death for some - that's why I did a long investigation on what to eat, and how to eat it, and how to prepare it.
I found the answer is various types of sprouts.  I bought bags of seeds, (and don't regret it), but each supplier said it was easy to sprout.  Well easier said than done.
But not so with this training DVD.  Very clear, very easy to follow step by step directions, covers all sorts of types of sprouts and how to use earth or just water.
This presenter is a sort of sprouting guru, and the DVD delivers much more then promised.
Get it and watch it - before the lights go out!",1237420800,2,743,4.110344827586207
8344446,5,B001ULDK0A,"You can live on such a small amount of money, by sprouting.  First time I tried to sprout, I raised a crop of mold.  I had tried to follow some tips on the net for free, but it was a waste of time and money.

I invested in this DVD and it was so clear, so easy, and foolproof.  I highly recommend it, not just for survival, which was my original intent, but for healthy eating, you can't beat sprouts.

Well worth the tiny investment.",1236902400,4,434,4.0588235294117645
