6879379,3,B00QT4VEYM,This movie was okay. I only became interested when I saw the guy from the Haves and the Have Nots. I think he's a great actor but this was low budget and not clear meaning it was hard to hear. Bad Audio. The simmons girl is pretty but not good acting on this movie. Overall it's a good story line so I gave it 3 stars.,1437091200,,318,3.8333333333333335

8692830,3,B00QT4VEYM,"What would you do to be successful in Hollywood? Thats the main conflict in this light-hearted drama about making it in Hollywood. To be fair, this movie was a first attempt and like many first movies, there were a plethora of stories and lots of little technical mistakes. BUT the soft drama is still very engaging. The story focuses on an entertainment reporter who resorts to  digging up dirt to be promoted to an anchor position. Along the way, her moral growth is challenged and changed. Significant performances from Federico Dordei, Jon Briddell, Vanessa Simmons, and Tyler Repley (The Haves and Havenots) add the needed gravitasse, while serious issues like sexuality, disease, faith, and ethics are addressed. All in all, its an easy Friday night movie to share with friends and family. It can also serve as a conversation starter and cautionary tale for Hollywood hopefuls!",1513641600,,883,5.0479452054794525
8692831,1,B00QT4VEYM,"It was not a good movie for me. The acting didn't flow it seemed forced, the plot was lacking any sort of depth, very surface and superficial as well as predictable. Hats off for putting something together and getting it out there. That's more than most.",1503014400,,254,4.543478260869565
