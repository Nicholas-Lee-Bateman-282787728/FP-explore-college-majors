7920530,1,B00004LMOS,"Well, I don't know why all these reviews are about Italian . . . but for the actual DVD above, on Carbohydrates . . . This DVD is nothing to write home about. It looks like something out of the 80s, and a low budget endeavor at that. It is basically just a glorified power point. There is a good amount of information, but it's pretty boring. The DVD is only 18 minutes long, but it feels like 3 hours. It's basically just shots of people talking, with the words they're saying showing up on the screen. They didn't really take advantage of it being a movie, and there are no good graphics or entertaining/interesting segments. The little bit of humor is really cheesy, too.

The best part is probably the Bonus feature at the end, which shows how all the macronutrients are used in digestion. But it is still simple diagrams and not really very interesting to watch. My family, with no science background, was very bored when I started watching this DVD with them. I do not plan to use it with my high school students, now that I have seen it.",1199232000,2,1044,4.381443298969073

7920532,5,B00004LMOS,I loved these tapes. It really broke Italian down for me and made it seem so easy! I honestly recommend them a great study tool.,982454400,3,128,4.16
