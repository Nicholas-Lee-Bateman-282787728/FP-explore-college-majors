7828035,4,6302622875,I DISAGREE WITH THE CRITICISM POSTED ON AMAZON ABOUT THIS MOVIE.I SEE IT AS A STORY WHERE THE CHARACTERS HAS TO BE UNDERSTOOD OR THE STORY WONT HAVE A MEANING. MANY B GRADE MOVIES HAVE A CULT FOLLOWING AND THE STORYLINE IS ABSURD THE DIALOGUE IS SUPERFICIAL YET THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO LOVE IT.I HAVE SAW MAD AT THE MOON THREE TIMES AND EACH TIME I CAME AWAY WITH A LITTLE SOMETHING MORE.THE DIALOGUE IS TELLING OF COMPLICATED TROUBLED PEOPLE WHITCH AS IN REALITY ONE HAS TO BE A DEDICATED PROFESSIONAL OR LOVE THE PEOPLE OTHERWISE ONE BECOMES IMPATIONT AND DISMISSIVE.THIS STORY IS ONE OF BOTH HORROR IN THE TRADITIONAL MOVIE SENSE AND LOVE MOST TANGLED ONE MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY IDENTIFYING IT.IF SOMEONE LIKES DARK SHADOWS OR ROD SERLINGS NIGHT GALLERY THEY PROBABLY WOULD LIKE MAD AT THE MOON.BUT THEN AS WITH POLITICS NOVELS MUSIC OR ANY COMPOSITION IT DEPENDS ON ONES VALUES.THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER MOVIES THAT WERE FINANCIAL FAILURES AND TRASHED IN EVERY IMAGINABLE WAY YET A LIFE SPRUNG UP OF ITS OWN AND A CULT CLASSIC EMERGED.THE WIZARD OF OZ WHEN FIRST RELEASED WAS CALLED A REAL SINKAROO BY A PROMINENT FILM CRITIC AND WE ALL KNOW WHERE THAT WENT TO.I BELIEVE SOMEDAY MAD AT THE MOON SHALL BE REDISCOVERED AND HOLD AS MUCH AFFECTION AS ANY OF THE FOREMENTIONED FILMS AND TELEVISION PROGRAMS WITH AS MUCH INTEREST AND NOVELTY AS AN ED WOOD FILM AND ALBEIT CAMP OF DARK SHADOWS WHITCH IN ITS TIME WAS LAUGHED AT AND INTENDED FOR ADOLESCENTS YET IN THE TIME BEFORE V.C.RS AND CABLE TELEVISION MANY ADULTS WOULDNT EVAN TALK ON THE TELEPHONE WHILE DARK SHADOWS WAS ON. OH TELL THEM ILL CALL THEM BACK.NO I DO NOT THINK MARY STUART MASTERSON OR ANY OTHER PERFORMER IN THIS MOVIE MADE A MISTAKE BY APPEARING THEREIN.BECAUSE SOMEDAY THERE SHALL BE ARDENT FANS WHO WANT TO TALK TO THEM ABOUT THIS VERY FILM WITH THE SAME SERIOUS REVERENCE AS DARK SHADOWS STAR TREK OR ED WOOD FANS HOLD THE SAID ARTICLES AS WORKS OF ART.AND YES I DO APPRECIATE ANYONE WHO CAN APPRECIATE ANY FORM OF ART HOWEVER SUBJECTIVE.,1422921600,,2001,4.623595505617978
7828036,1,6302622875,"Mary Stuart Masterson is my all time favorite actress BUT: she should fire her manager for getting her this job. Also the writer and director should never work again.

My copy of this movie is going into the trash.",1156636800,,214,4.487179487179487
7828037,1,6302622875,"I Don't know what Martin Donovan was hoping to achieve in this visually stunning but emotionally empty piece of garbage.  There's so little dialogue that when it comes, you expect something revealing?  Forget it...Mary Stuart Masterson, Fionnula Flannagan and Hart Bochner are totally ineffectual, and the plot is so stupid and threadbare, one has to wonder who put up the money for this one!
DO NOT BUY...DO NOT RENT......A WASTE ALL AROUND!",1076198400,3,442,5.125
