7928267,4,B00004Z4VO,"This is a very heart felt episode of a middle-aged man who's not spent enough time with his son and made alot of wrong decisions in his life getting mixed up in organized crime.
He one day gets a call from the army saying his son has been shot in South Vietnam and may not make it. Interesting how this was the last Twilight zone season (1964) when the problems in Vietnam were just beginning with the American army going there to fight, even though the official war began in 1965. The American peace and women's  revolution and hippie years with alot of it being based around  Vietnam was just a few years away from the time of this episode.
Pip hears the news about his son during a confrontation with the organized crime boss, and a kid working for them had just broken a few codes and was in hot water with them. Pip, hurting over the news on his son, decides to let the kid go but he gets shot himself. With a bullet wound, he stumbles onto the closed fairgrounds outside where he used to take his son when he was a kid.

SPOILERS BELOW

This is where the surreal happens. Pip sees his son as 10 years old again on the nighttime fairgrounds. Pip sees him just as he saw him 10 years ago when he was 10. Pip is baffled over how he could be 10 again, but he is so immensely thrilled, it's such a wonderful dream, he takes his son on rides and games in rich reunion enjoyment.  Eventually, his son says ""I must go now"" and Pip prays to God not to take his son but to take him instead.
This is very interesting and surreal. It's another episode where Rod Sterling leaves things to the viewers' imagination.  I believe this is like ""Occurance at owl creek bridge"" where Pip's life flashed before his eyes after he was shot. The entire fairgrounds bit with Pip and his 10 year old son was all in Pip's mind and soul as he was dying alone on the empty fairgrounds. He was clinging to his memories.
What really occurred was after Pip's runion with his 10 year old son and his prayer to God to take him instead was that Pip died while his 20 year old son in Vietnam recovered and came back to America, and we get that last scene with 20 year old son of Pip at the fair with his mother reminiscing about how his late father used to take him there.",1509321600,,2242,4.190255220417633

7928269,4,B00004Z4VO,"These are the episodes in this collection...

Hocus-Pocus and Frisby (Episode 95 - April 13, 1962): Andy Devine is Frisby, a loud-mouthed braggart whose boasts attract the attention of aliens. Perhaps he should have read the story about the boy who cried wolf before embarking on his greatest adventure...

Of Late I Think Of Cliffordville (Episode 116 - April 21, 1961): William Feathersmith (Albert Salmi), a bored, wealthy business man, gets a chance to go back in time and start over, armed with all the knowledge he's acquired - an arsenal that's not as powerful as the thinks.

Mr. Garrity And The Graves (Episode 152 - May 8, 1964): Jared Garrity (John Dehner) makes a living by reviving the dead in the Old West. He doesn't make money from people who want to see their loved ones again, but from the many townsfolk who will pay to keep the dead buried.",1393200000,,860,4.682119205298013
7928270,5,B00004Z4VO,"I don't believe we will see the likes of Rod Serling again anytime soon, He was thoughtful, introspective, a good man with a great conscience that knew how to tell stories of right and wrong in such a mystifying way. A lesson learned in each and every story with some suspense thrown in. Love, Love, Love the Twilight Zone",1365465600,,322,4.47457627118644
7928271,5,B00004Z4VO,"""MR. GARRITY AND THE GRAVES"" is a very captivating and ultimately haunting episode from the TWILIGHT ZONE. John Dehner, a totally underrated actor, gives a multifaceted performance as Mr. Garrity who promises that he can raise the dead to the realm of the living. And it unfolds from there with still another innovative twist.

""OF LATE I THINK OF CLIFFORDVILLE"" sounds like my kind of episode. It seems like it has that longing for the past and perhaps something about reconciliation and redemption for deeds done long ago but never forgotten. Such things can haunt a lifetime and that is often a running theme we find in the TWILIGHT ZONE. However, I was totally disappointed in this hour long episode from the Fourth Season. Unfortunately, it is Albert Salmi's performance, which is totally unconvincing and in fact and I hate to say rather poor, that undoes this entire episode and squanders a very effective performance by Julie Newmar. This was a hard fact to swallow viewing this, but I still love the title.

""HOCUS-POCUS AND FRISBY"" is indeed Cracker-barrel witticisms and humor at its best. With many thanks to Andy Devine's performance, which he seems to have thrown a lot of himself into bringing this character to life. Yes, there is a conflict. Does he get his comeuppance? That depends on your point of view. It's a bit of fluff, but we need that from time to time.

Let's just say that Mr. Garrity saves this volume or perhaps better stated, nostalgically and visually all 3 of these episodes are still impressive to the eye, the mind and the heart. And that is the magic of the ""Twilight Zone.""",1334880000,,1611,4.767025089605735
7928272,5,B00004Z4VO,"HOCUS-POCUS AND FRISBY is a science fiction story starring Andy Devine.  Howard Near, famous for his roll of Floyd the Barber in the Andy Griffith show, has a minor part in this story.  The story is a fine one.  It is not a great story, but it is fun watching over and over, in view of the abundantly likeable Andy Devine.  In a nutshell, Mr. Devine is the owner of a small shop in a country village, some time in the present era (early 1960s).  Some aliens drive up in an automobile, and they request a fill up.  The aliens look like ordinary businessmen, but they are really aliens.  Their goal is to confirm that the man they met is really Andy Devine.  This goal arose from their intelligence sources who informed the aliens that Mr. Devine is the smartest human being on earth.  This information arose from the fact that Mr. Devine had a habit of bragging of his remarkable accomplisments in the fields of science, politics, and the humanities.  At any rate, the aliens make a mistake in thinking Mr. Devine to be the most intelligent man on earth, and they then kidnap him.  Their spaceship is the same, exact flying saucer seen in the famed T.Z. episode, TO SERVE MAN.  But the aliens in HOCUS-POCUS AND FRISBY are not the same aliens as in TO SERVE MAN.  In HOCUS-POCUS AND FRISBY the aliens look more like frogs.  At any rate the surprise ending takes the form of Andy Devine's unusal technique in escaping from the flying saucer.  The storyline is not much to speak of, but the local color, and Andy Devine's splended mannerisms and character, are what keep this story humming with charm.

OF LATE I THINK OF CLIFFORDVILLE features Albert Salmi, who plays a business executive who engineers the takeover of smaller companies, with the goal of destroying careers of upper management in the target companies.  This kind of scenario happens to dozens of companies per year (or perhaps more) in the United States of America.  But since this is a T.Z. episode, there is a slight twist.  The Devil pays Mr. Salmi a visit one night, and they make a deal.  The deal is that Mr. Salmi can go back in time by about 50 years and retain everything he knows.  Mr. Salmi eagerly agrees, since he knows the location of natural resources, such as oil, and a general knowledge inventions, such as engines, motors, and pharmaceuticals.  But when Mr. Salmi goes back in time, he is in for a rude surprise.  First, all of his business colleagues, including the janitor (actor Wright King), have counterpart citizens in the town back in time.  Secondly, Mr. Salmi discovers that simply knowing that a particular invention will be invented some day, is not quite enough to actually having somebody build it.  The most delightful part of this story is when Mr. Salmi strikes a business deal with two businessmen, and where the two businessmen delight in the fact that they had tricked Mr. Salmi.  As part of this delightful trick, Mr. Salmi gets stuck with the ugly daughter of one of the businessmen.  One of the business partners, actor John Anderson, has been in about 40 movies, and in hundreds of television episodes.

The plot of CLIFFORDVILLE is one of the better T.Z. plots.  My only complaint is that Mr. Salmi has a grating voice, and he is not such a pleasant actor.  Mr. Salmi is in a couple of other T.Z. plots, A QUALITY OF MERCY (where his acting is just right) and in EXECUTION (where his grating quality is way over the top, and gets on ones nerves).

MR. GARRITY AND THE GRAVES is one of the greatest of the T.Z. stories.  John Dehner plays the main character.  Mr. Dehner has starred in dozens of movies, often as a villain.  Fans of cowboy movies from the 1960s will be glad to see Percy Helton as one of the minor characters.  Percy Helton is renowned for his raspy voice (along with actor John Fiedler), and for acting in many cowboy movies, such as Ride the High Country, 4 for Texas (with Frank Sinatra & Dean Martin), Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, and Gunsmoke, as well as in various thriller films and detective movies.  At any rate, John Dehner plays a charlatan who convinces people that he can bring dead people to life.  This particular town, which is a frontier town in the wild west, is distinguished in that many of the former residents are dead.  What also distinguishes the dead people, is that their living relatives hate them, and prefer that they remain dead.  Mr. Dehner's scheme, which is a complete success, is to collect bribe money from all of the living relatives, where the goal of the bribe is to prevent Mr. Dehner from bringing the deceased back to life.  MR.GARRITY AND THE GRAVES is one of the greatest T.Z. stories for several reasons.  First, the acting of the ""character actors"" is superb.  The term ""character actors"" is a term of the genre, meaning people who are exceptionally skilled at playing a certain type of character, such as a bartender, and play this type of role in many, many movies.  Second, there are few people who can resist watching a little story occurring in a little frontier town in the wild American west.  Third, the scriptwriter was in total command of the story from start to finish.  There is not one line that is out of place.  And fourth, there is an excellent surprise ending.",1296000000,2,5253,4.587982832618025
7928273,4,B00004Z4VO,"...""Of Late I Think of Cliffordville"" is the reason for this DVD to be sought after...Julie Newmar of course steals the show, though Albert Salmi is not without interest  (but it is his weakest TZ episode...see ""A Quality of Mercy"" for his best TZ performance [there were three total]).  Unfortunately ""Hocus-Pocus and Frisby"" and fifth season ""Mr. Garrity and the Graves"" are not as commendable.  However, like almost all TZ episodes, they are of great merit in comparison to the vast majority of things being aired on television then or now.  The hour long episode DVD's are especially valuable because these fourth season episodes are rarely shown at all in syndication  (and of course TZ is always cut in syndication anyway).",988761600,3,729,4.991735537190083
