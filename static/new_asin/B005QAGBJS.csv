4857970,1,B005QAGBJS,"I was very disappointed with this movie. The movie does not have professional actors. The movie is definitely of bad taste. The octopus head is a balloon. The movie is in black and white, giving the impression that it was made in the 50s or 60s, but it was not. The movie lasts for only 43 minutes. It is not a full-length movie. The bonus movie ""Frankenstein Versus Hitler"" is even worse. It is a silent black and white movie, giving the impression that it was made in the 1920s, but it was made that way on purpose. The dead corpses look like plastic dolls. I certainly cannot recommend these movies. I watched the movie for a few minutes and then I kept on moving it forward to see different scenes and it was all very displeasing. Don't bother to order. You will be throwing your money away. Don't listen to those positive comments. I listened to them and now I am disappointed.",1343260800,5,882,4.41717791411043
4857971,1,B005QAGBJS,"It came from Alpha Video. What does one expect? Only cheapskates who prefer to buy by price and not by quality will be duped into thinking this is a quality product. Note: Anything that is an Alpha Video release is not worth buying. And more than half of their titles are available on Amazon from other companies like Roan, VCI and Sinister Cinema in MUCH better quality and almost for the same price. Stay away from this DVD!",1326585600,3,426,4.4743589743589745
8482970,1,B005QAGBJS,"Thank God it was only 44 minutes long.  Had it been longer I would have had to consider plugging my ears with cement and poking my eyes out with a fork.  This, unfortunately, is an 'as bad as it gets' short by some kid and his friends with a home video camera.  The film is equal to a third rate (I'm being kind) high school production with kids who are basically clueless about acting.  However, at least they are trying... as painful and heinous an attempt it truly was.  The sound is terrible, uneven as it gets, and the video is just abysmally done.  The only redeeming factor was large portions of the soundtrack that were ripped from the Creature From The Black Lagoon trilogy.  Hope he doesn't get busted for copyright violations.  This film as far as spoof horror films go doesn't even pass the giggle test.  He really should have paid us for watching this painfully awful DVD.  As for the ""Bonus"" feature.....We won't even go there...",1521676800,,943,4.5266272189349115
8482971,5,B005QAGBJS,"hooray for the young people making films like the vintage 50s black and white horror films and silent movies instead of the filth and boulder dash that are prevalent today, a lot of imagination and courage to revive an old trend that was entertaining and relaxing never how silly which is what the world needs not a hard dose of reality you get just living in a fallen world but I'm  a guy that likes ed wood",1517184000,,408,4.298701298701299
8482972,1,B005QAGBJS,"An early film of Joshua Kennedy, made with production values that are so low that its not even cheesy-movie fun.  The audio recording is horribly annoying, with poor quality and frequently alternates between too loud and too soft.  And the special effects are beyond cheap (and not even entertainingly cheap.)  Stay away from this one, and don't waste your money on it.",1514592000,,369,4.919354838709677

8482977,3,B005QAGBJS,"I really liked this . Clearly amateur on a technical level, but clever and knowledgeable in  film references. Alot smarter than most  films made by kids. Loved the numerous  references Corman,  and William Castle. Definitely A for effort. We'll be hearing from this kid in  the future .",1383868800,,286,4.875
8482978,3,B005QAGBJS,"Is ATTACK OF THE OCTOPUS PEOPLE a great film? No. Is it a good film? No. However, it is okay, and it was made for no money, by a kid! A kid who obviously loves the genre. While this film, and it's co-feature, FRANKENSTEIN VS. HITLER are amateurish (as they should be), they do show promise. I shudder to think of what MY first movie would look like! I couldn't make anything remotely watchable now, let alone when I was sixteen! A note to Director, Joshua Kennedy: Don't be discouraged. Keep making movies! I hope to see your name in lights one day...",1372982400,4,551,4.359223300970874
8482979,3,B005QAGBJS,"Written by, directed by, and starring 16 year old Joshua Kennedy, ""Attack of the Octopus People"" is an incredibly amateur film about a plot to take over the world by foisting delicious pastries called ""Octopies"" on humanity. It will not surprise you to learn that this propagates a race of balloon-headed octopi and serves to turn all mankind into octopus people. The film is an obvious spoof, and is extremely heavy handed at some points. While it's inconsistent, there are also moments of budding brilliance in the film, and before he's done pretty much every B-movie clich&eacute; from the 1950's is recycled in some form or another. I was especially fond of the balloon octopus head technique, the very primitive stop motion photography Kennedy used, and occasional lines of dialogue were most amusing, e.g. ""'What's wrong with your eyes?'...'They're allergic to questions.'"" Not bad pseudo-surrealism for someone way too young to remember the psychedelic 60's. I was torn between a two and three star rating for the film. It's hardly a feature at 44 minutes long, and it is very uneven, but for a 16 year old to make and produce this requires the realization that this is the formative stage of Kennedy's career, and he has the potential as he gains experience to be a keen independent filmmaker.

As a bonus the DVD includes a second feature which almost made me deduct a star from this review: it involves a dictator versus classic movie monster and was made as a silent film making an already boring film nearly excruciating, although it's mercifully short (though not short enough.) It's all over the place: there's vampires, there's dancing, there's beheading, and ultimately an unsatisfying conclusion, but then what else would you expect from a film titled ""Frankenstein vs. Hitler?"" Boo!",1369440000,4,1800,5.0200668896321075
