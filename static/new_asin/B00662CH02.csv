4961670,5,B00662CH02,Absolutely loved every episode in this collection. I was only sorry that there aren't more episodes available. The acting is excellent although I found Alan Davies's lisp annoying (I was a speech teacher once upon a time many years ago). The other actors in the ensemble (Chambers) are terrific and the stories intriguing and not trite.,1343952000,6,336,5.017857142857143
4961671,1,B00662CH02,"I have the entire Inspector Morse series.  In Morse, John Thaw portrayed the ultimate in the intelligent, moral, highly cultured, dedicated super-detective.  In the series he is meticulous in professional and private behavior and possessor of amazing skill in dealing with the broad spectrum of problems and personalities that might confront such a figure as Morse.  I bought the ""Brief"" series because it is reputedly produced by the creators of the Master of Sleuth himself.
However, I see no similarity in the two heroes of the DVD legalistic genre.
I was deeply disappointed by the Yuppie-life-styled attorney figure presented in ""Brief"".  He is personally and often professionally sloppy, and commits all domestic ""crimes"" that would offend Morse to no end.  He drinks to excess, womanizes, and gambles foolishly.
I gave my copy away!",1341964800,12,839,5.2781954887218046
4961672,5,B00662CH02,"there is a great character balance between humour and realism if court proceedings. Alan Davies is a good comidical actor and does the ""serious"" well. Love everything he has done.",1339200000,2,179,5.0
4961673,5,B00662CH02,I had never heard of this series but gave it a try because I generally like British police and court dramas. I expected something similar to American dramas of the same genre and was delighted that it was much superior. A British series is not subject to the pressures of creating a episode every week; it is acceptable to broadcast a new episode whenever it meets the producer's standard. It is similar to what occurs with some shows on premium cable channels in the US. And these shows seem to garner lots of award nominations.,1334880000,4,529,4.578947368421052
4961674,4,B00662CH02,"This series, which only ran for eight episodes, is another fine British crime series being distributed in the US by Acorn Media. (These are the same folks who distribute the ""New Tricks"" series, which is still my favorite.). Produced by Carlton Television, one of the largest producers of TV shows in the UK (and now part of the larger ITV commercial network) in 2004, the series follows criminal attorney Henry Farmer as he both defends and, sometimes prosecutes, cases in the London court system.

My fellow reviewer, ""Doc"" Wolf, has outlined the eight episodes for you, so I won't rehash that. What made this series most interesting for me - and I hope others - that, line many of fine British crime shows, the actual crime cases take a back seat to the series character's own lives. Farmer is separated from his wife (who is raising their 12 year old son) and is having an ""affair"" with a woman whose husband is terminally ill (and is fully aware of the affair because he wants her to be happy). I'm not giving you a ""spoiler alert"" because this relationship is revealed early in first episode and forms just one of the ""back stories"" in the series. Another is Farmer's gambling habit. But there's some humor in this series as well, which makes it well rounded.

Each episode runs about 70 minutes and the ""Complete Season"" set is packaged as ""Series One"" and ""Series Two"".

Like me, some of the British court system language and the various ""management levels"" in Farmer's law firm may confuse you, but you can gather most of it easily. The accents can sometime - not often, but sometimes - be hard to decipher but the DVD has an English subtitle option to overcome that issue.

It's series like ""the Brief"" that never make it to US television and so I'm thankful to Acorn for giving us the opportunity to experience them.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

4961680,4,B00662CH02,An excellent series with a different take on the legal system (I am used to the L&O series in the US) with interesting characters and plotlessness.

4961690,5,B00662CH02,"Fantastic series!  This is quite a different role for Alan Davies and gives him and us an opportunity to see the scope of his talents.  Henry Farmer is a character you can't help but feel a bit sorry for.  He's got potential and the drive to achieve it, but can't quite seem to get there. For those who complained about his faults, those faults are what make him.  He's flawed, like the rest of us.  We can relate to him because of those flaws and we want him to overcome them and succeed.  We want him to win the case, we want him to win the girl and get his life sorted. That's kind of the point of the series.  He's not supposed to be like other characters in law dramas.  Henry not only defends the underdog, he is the underdog.  As far as the drinking (he is NOT an alcoholic) and gambling being over done, I have to wonder if these reviewers watched the entire series.  Neither of these issues are overplayed and in no way interfere with the storyline other than to help define the character.  If you're looking for a cold, hard legal drama then this may not be for you.  If you're looking for a realistic drama with a character you can identify with and want to see him succeed, then by all means ignore the negative reviews and pick this up.",1428537600,,1249,4.245762711864407

4961701,4,B00662CH02,"It's unfortunate that this intriguing series set in a London law firm didn't last past two seasons and only eight episodes. The interaction of the characters in chambers and the courtroom, especially Alan Davies and Cherie Lunghi, are reminiscent of RUMPOLE OF THE BAILEY with Davies' lead character a compulsive gambler rather than a semi-alcoholic. Like Rumpole, although his personal life is a shambles, he manages to practice his vocation extremely well.  Edward Petherbridge, a one-time Lord Peter Wimsey, scores well as Davies' dysfunctional father, a retired judge. Very absorbing courtroom drama.",1395187200,,604,5.565217391304348

Not only does Davies shine through with a beautifully understated performance, but he is also surrounded by a wonderful cast of characters. To call them ""supporting"" actors would be wrong - they are far more than that.
Having just watched and admired John Deed from A-Z, I thought The Brief might seem a little lame in comparison. But no! Some of the storylines are hard-hitting and just as controversial, I would have thought, as those taken on by the Judge.
The two seasons are all too Brief. I wonder why a longer series didn't materialise? Surely, there's plenty of material for stories at the Old Bailey, and plenty of scope for character development?",1360454400,11,741,4.936
