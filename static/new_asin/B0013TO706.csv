8252811,3,B0013TO706,"This video includes a number of exercises that work your ab muscles.  If you have a condition for which your midwife/OB doctor doesn't want you to work your abdominals while on bedrest, this probably isn't the video for you.  If you want a video for just arms and legs, I recommend googling the on-line bed rest video by Dr. Cathy (websited is called ""Educated Pregnancy"")",1336435200,2,372,4.707692307692308
8252812,5,B0013TO706,This was a great thing to have during bed rest as I felt productive and still in control of my body. I highly recommend; just clear the exercises with your OB first.,1301270400,,165,4.1875
8252813,3,B0013TO706,"I was so eager to do this video when I ordered it at 21 weeks pregnant.  I am on bedrest from a short cervix.  When it did arrive I was to afraid to do most of the exercises.  I am not even suppose to be sitting up and in 90% of the exercises she has you sitting up.  She also has you moving/changing positions between most exercises, sometimes unnecessarily because they do a graphic between each pose before she shows you what is next.
I waited to do the video again until I reached 25 weeks and felt comfortable sitting up.  I am alternating the video now with my own workout that I do laying on my side with hand and ankle weights.
She seems knowledgeable, but there is also too much chit chat in the video.  This would be fine if you were doing the video one time, but if you are sentenced to 4 months of bedrest and want to do this video daily, it gets very old.  The main problem is that all this talk happens between exercises so you have to wait to begin, which makes it drag on.
There is a ""music only"" option, which I thought would be great because it would cut out all the explaining, stories, ect, but it is the same version just without the words so you still have to constantly wait.  Now I just do the exercise as it should start and find I am doubling her reps at minimum.
With all that said it is still a good alternative to my regular workout.  Also, if you are unfamiliar with exercises laying down or are a beginner to exercise in general it is a good start to keep you moving.
I have never been sore in the slightest, but the point is to keep you from losing all your muscle tone, which it helps with, so although I don't love it, I still use it and would recommend it.",1227657600,10,1691,4.1
