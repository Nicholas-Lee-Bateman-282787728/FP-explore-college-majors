If you've seen Aliens...then you've seen this movie--I'm not kidding.",1425081600,6,116,5.105263157894737
6936286,3,B00RWCJXBQ,"Bruno Mattei's final film, God rest his soul.  Not entirely bad, despite being  near incoherent and all over the place.  Better than I could do by a landslide!  Lovers of Italian Horror ar advised to order this DVD it's better than most of the post-1980's Italian Horror films.",1424736000,10,277,4.708333333333333
6936287,5,B00RWCJXBQ,"Zombies the Beginning is much like a lot of other zombie movies.  A laboratory is full of zombies, and a crack team of soldiers have to clear it out of threats.  This is basically Island of the Living Dead Part 2, with one of the actresses from the first one returning as the top-billed role.  What's different here is the sheer amount of insanity director Mattei throws at you, even ripping off the movie Alien in a way you won't easily forget.  You get action, stock submarine footage, lots of head explosions, hilariously dubbed dialogue, and a movie to munch popcorn like a zombie would flesh.  Great stuff.",1424390400,14,611,4.62037037037037
6936288,4,B00RWCJXBQ,"This is late Italian exploitation director Bruno Mattei's final film (directed using the pseudonym ""Vincent Dawn"", one of more than twenty aliases he used in his long career) and, while it pales when compared to his 70's & 80's output (CAGED WOMEN - 1982; RATS: NIGHT OF TERROR - 1984), it still stands out heads-and-shoulders when compared to his later films, including CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST: THE BEGINNING (2003) and THE TOMB (2004). Meanwhile, his WIP flick, THE JAIL: A WOMEN'S HELL (2006), is supposed to be the best (and sleaziest) of his final output. This Philippines-lensed horror film, a sequel to Mattei's 2006 zombie flick, ISLAND OF THE LIVING DEAD (but with a few cosmetic changes), begins where ISLAND left off: the rescue of sole survivor Sharon (Yvette Yzon), who, after waking up in a hospital (where she has nightmares of turning into a zombie and munching on a nurse), relates a story about an uncharted island that contains hordes of the living dead to the unbelieving insurance representatives of the sunken salvage ship The Dark Star, of which Sharon was a crew member before it exploded after a zombie attack. No one believes her story and six months pass before she is contacted by Paul Barker (Paul Holme), a drug company representative, who wants her to join a rescue team to investigate the disappearance of a crew of scientists sent to the island several weeks earlier to bring back some zombies for further study, in hopes of creating new drugs to prolong life. A now-Buddhist Sharon eventually agrees (she's got nothing to lose, since she's still haunted by nightmares and unemployable in the outside world) and joins a small group of heavily armed mercenaries as they head to the island in a submarine (cue the stock footage!). Once on the island, Sgt. Zamura (Robert B. Johnson), the leader of the mercs, discovers that the missing scientists' base of operations is deserted, but fully operational. The mercs find a warehouse full of eaten body parts and then a laboratory lined with cages containing zombies and aborted baby zombie fetuses. What kind of experiments were the scientists performing? It's not long before everyone on the island will find out the answer and the mercs' numbers begin to dwindle, thanks to attacks by zombie babies (actually Filipino dwarves in disguise!) and a swarm of mutated zombies. While Barker, Sharon and Capt. Jurgens (James Paolleli; STRANGLEHOLD - 1994) monitor the situation from the Control Room, it becomes quite obvious that Barker knows more about this situation than he letting on, as more mercs become zombie chow and Sharon pulls a Ripley, commandeers a vehicle and tries to rescue them. The remainder of the film details Sharon's battles against the zombies and the eventual uncovering of Barker's true reasons for wanting to come to the island. Sharon makes a shocking discovery in the bowels of the base (a queen zombie spitting out babies like Pez and a giant brain controlling it all!) and uses her trusty flame-thrower to destroy it all.  This zombie flick is a not-so-thinly veiled rip-off of James Cameron's ALIENS (1986), substituting zombies for aliens. Many of the sequences are copied verbatim, including the birth of a baby zombie clearly patterned on the baby aliens bursting from the stomachs of their human hosts and the character of Barker representing Paul Reiser's corrupt representative Burke in ALIENS. Barker even locks Sharon in a lab with a bunch of hungry zombies, mimicking the scene of Ripley locked in the lab with a face-hugger. If you can ignore all the similarities (and that a big if, because a drinking game can be played spotting the ALIENS homages and you'd be smashed after the first twenty minutes), the bad acting, the horrendous English dubbing and dialogue (Typical exchange between two mercenaries: #1: ""Now we're in deep s***!"" #2: ""Shut your f****** mouth!""), you may find yourself enjoying all the decently-done gore, which includes gut-munching, a body being torn in half, appendages being yanked-off, decapitations and exploding heads. This is by no means a good film, but it is probably Bruno Mattei's best in the crop of films he directed in the new millennium. I know that's not saying much, but that's all we have now that Mattei shuffled off to the Great Beyond shortly after finishing this (There's a short tribute to the frail-looking Mattei during the closing credits). Filipino staple Jim Gaines (also the Production Coordinator here) puts in a cameo as a giant zombie. Also starring Diana Croyston, Mike Vergel and Gerald Acho. Now available on widescreen DVD for the first time in the U.S. from InterVision Picture Corp., an offshoot of Severin Films.",1424217600,2,4686,5.007692307692308

8696091,3,B00RWCJXBQ,"When I read that it had ripped off Aliens, I never thought to the extent that it does.  It is basically Aliens without the tech of a futuristic space era with some modifications to the story line.  No little girl, no android or as it preferred Artificial Person, and only one may have survived.  Actually I am amazed that they were not sued by the makers of Alien or maybe they were.",1478304000,,383,4.291666666666667
8696092,5,B00RWCJXBQ,"Recently released from Intervision Pictures Corp./Severin Films is a film that I was initially hesitant about watching. Why, you ask? Well I am a lover of Italian horror cinema, but my knowledge of anything post 1980's is very limited. Plus, Bruno Mattei's film career is definitely spotty and though I've grown to love many of his films, I just wasn't sure what to expect here. But I really am thankful that I took the plunge.

Zombies: The Beginning (with its ripoff of Fulci's Gates of Hell cover art) begins with a traumatized woman found afloat in the water. The woman suffers from nightmares about the living dead, which she claims to have killed her colleagues and is then fired from her job due to these crazy stories. She then becomes a Buddhist (?) but is brought back to the island by the Tyler Corporation, who have a sneaking suspicion that a ""sample"" (aka Zombie) that they sent there has...um...caused some problems. The girl travels with a group of soldiers to the island to see the prognosis. Just a hint...it's not good.

Ok so what I may have missed from my fuzzy, incoherent synopsis (for this fuzzy, incoherent film) is that this film is basically Aliens, with zombies instead of Aliens. Ok, not basically. It IS Aliens. The funny thing is that Bruno Mattei (billed here under his usual moniker Vincent Dawn) already did an Alien ripoff in 1989 called Shocking Dark. But that one included elements of The Terminator, instead of zombies so it's ok. So basically, this film is a ripoff of a ripoff. Not something completely unheard of for a Mattei film, nor is the ""borrowed"" footage (yes, you can see Viggo Mortensen for a couple seconds thanks to some Crimson Tide footage), horrible dubbing and script (""You Ugly Witch""). But you know what? I actually really enjoyed this film. Like I stated before, I was initially concerned by the time when this film was made, but luckily (at least in Mattei World), not much has changed in 25 or so years! Replace some terrible CGI with terrible models and BAM! It's the 80's all over again! So what did I like about this film? The makeup FX were surprisingly well done. The story was engaging (despite its unoriginality) and there were plenty of laugh out loud moments to keep you watching. So in closing, don't expect a great film (or an original one) but do expect a breezy, cheezy splatter-ific gas! There wasn't much improvement needed to be done by Intervision for this release, seeing how it is a fairly recent film so the picture quality is fine and there is also a trailer and a nice little featurette with the writer and his relationship with Mattei.",1449532800,2,2619,4.691304347826087
8696093,2,B00RWCJXBQ,"I expected this movie to be bad but I didn't think it would be so HILARIOUSLY bad. This is a full-on, total, rip-off of ""Aliens"" complete with the same dialogue (with a few minor alterations) and even some of the same music. If you've seen ""Aliens"" then you know exactly what's going to happen with every scene. Every time a familiar piece of dialogue popped up (roughly every 30 seconds) I laughed my a$$ off. Everything about this video is sub-par (even by Mattei's standards) so expect the worst acting, effects, and...well... everything else. I think some of the submarine footage comes from ""Crimson Tide"" but I'm not positive. I guess this is supposed to be some sort of sequel to ""Hell of the Living Dead"" but if so, it makes no sense at all. I think that in order to REALLY enjoy this film you need to have four shots of tequila in quick succession, then bite into a Thai Ghost Chili Pepper, then four more tequila shots. This will put you in the proper mood to view this video. As you roll on the floor, sick with pain, and eyes spewing water like a fire hydrant, you will only catch blurry glimpses of this cinematic mess and it may seem to make some sense. However, the ending will still make you cringe or laugh hysterically, depending on how much of the tequila you managed to keep down.",1439769600,,1300,4.443514644351464

8696096,4,B00RWCJXBQ,"This is the late Bruno Mattei's sequel to the abominable zombie flick Island of the Living Dead.  It is also an unapologetic rip-off of James Cameron's Aliens (I'm surprised that Cameron didn't sue or at least cry plagiarism).  Using Aliens as a blueprint, this sequel follows the only survivor of the first film as she is goaded into leading an army onto a second island where zombies are being kept, being experimented on, being altered...........  Things do not turn out well for all concerned.

When you consider the audacity it takes to copy someone else's plot in such an egregious fashion, this movie actually gains points for being so blatant and obvious.  What gall.  What impudence.  What malice aforethought.  Surprisingly, I actually liked this mess enough to want to keep it and watch it again.  (The same cannot be said of the first film.)  It caught me off guard.  It took me awhile to figure out why it felt so familiar.  And then I thought, what nerve, swiping someone else's work and then trying to pass it off as your own.  Wow.  (And what other film can boast scenes where they use flamethrowers on zombie babies.)",1427587200,3,1134,4.719387755102041
8696097,1,B00RWCJXBQ,"It looks horrible, it's horribly directed, it's basically just Aliens remade as a crap zombie exploitationer shot over three days in the Philippines, with a totally uneven tone and s***ty acting. Mattei's penultimate picture is so bad it's bad; charming like your sloppy-drunk friend, whose antics you shamefully enjoy, knowing the evening will be over thankfully soon. One Star. (Obviously there is a subset of readers who will be emboldened to watch Zombies: The Beginning after reading this. Knock yourselves out!)",1427414400,2,517,5.395061728395062
8696098,5,B00RWCJXBQ,"This movie is well worth the price and I plan to watch it again, but it has to have some of the worst voice actors that have ever dubbed an Italian film. A lot of mismatched voices, yelling and over reactions. It kind of reminds me of Demons.",1426464000,,242,4.0625
8696099,5,B00RWCJXBQ,"This is one big bloody mess of a movie. If your into a script that makes no sense, actors who cannot act, and every idea used before in horror and sci-fi movies then you found a gold mine. I gave this movie the rating I did for one reason. The best of bad movies I have viewed. Take my word of caution. Have a few drinks before and during the movie. It will help give you a false sense of storyline. There is plenty of blood and gore. The last ten minutes of the movie will have you crying or laughing at how things end. You have to give it a once over to appreciate this cinematic disaster.",1425686400,4,591,4.016949152542373
