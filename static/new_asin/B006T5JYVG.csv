8503913,4,B006T5JYVG,"Great documentary however I would have loved to see the perspective of other persons who had interacted with Manley and how this impacted their lives good, bad or indifferent, that instead of or in conjunction with what Beverly and peter had to ramble about. Manley possessed an insight on the disparity between the haves and have not and that education and true self awareness of ones potential is a great asset that should be employed for positive effect in this Beverly and Peter should have been asked what they have done to continue and transform this vision of awareness now that Michael in now gone and they were so close to him.

PS. now I need more footage of his speeches in Parliament and on the road.",1400112000,,712,4.606299212598425
8503914,5,B006T5JYVG,This film is great!!! As the only film on the Life of Michael Manley I enjoyed it thoroughly. The interviews were spot on and the archive footage was amazing. I don't get the other review as the description states interviews were from those who knew him best and since this film was made in 2012 an interview with Michael Manley would have been impossible. and the film was made by one man on a tight budget and still manages to impress. 5 stars!!!!,1393718400,,449,4.421686746987952
8503915,1,B006T5JYVG,I expected some interviews with Michael Manley.  This documentary just has interviews with his family and friends. I was very dissapointed.,1380240000,2,139,5.619047619047619

The documentary eventhough is about Michael did give in my opinion a holistic view of the country and how he fits in.",1358121600,,209,5.0
8503917,5,B006T5JYVG,"I've always admired Mr Michael Manley and this DVD gave so much information on another side his life.  Captures his passion for poor and under privilege people.  It gives more insight into his leadership skills and all the challenges that he faced.  Good overview of his affiliations with other not so popular nations,  Cuba - Fidel, and its misrepresentation.  His policies changed the way of life for Jamaicans and it's all touched on briefly on this DVD.....I thoroughly enjoyed it.",1351555200,,485,5.0125
8503918,5,B006T5JYVG,"As a tremendous admirer of Michael Manley I am honored to write the first review of The Word is Love. This is an extremely well done documentary in that it gives the viewer a strong feel for the man- his beliefs, his passions, his personal life, and the things that drove him and made him who he was. There is a good diversity of people who speak eloquently and candidly about their recollections of Manley and their storytelling is excellent. While it is certainly meant as a tribute, I did not have the impression that Manley's travails or shortcomings as Prime Minister were glossed over or ignored. While perhaps not entirely objective, the film is overall honest. If I had any complaint it would be that I had hoped for more firsthand footage of Manley himself, but this is this does not detract substantially from a fine piece of filmmaking. I would strongly encourage anyone with an interest in Michael Manley to have a look. It is well worth it.",1334448000,,953,4.6117647058823525
