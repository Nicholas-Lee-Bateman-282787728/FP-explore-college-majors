5399772,5,B00A8KJLPM,"I really enjoy the Maigret Collection.

I am so glad that was re-released and I look for more quality productions to find their way on DVD in the near future.",1364083200,,158,4.266666666666667
5399773,5,B00A8KJLPM,"The perfection Michael Gambon brings to the starring role is magnificent. My one deep regret is that they only produced twelve episodes, so I must force myself to wait at least a year between watching them over. Why in the world couldn't they have made 24 or 36 episodes? You can taste the atmosphere, and the music is so good that I would order a soundtrack. What can you say after you've said perfect? As the Dean definitely did not say to me as I got my college degree, ""Sorry, but Summa Cum Laude is the highest recognition we are able to give."" I have three sets. I don't want to take a chance on any of my discs going bad and not being able to replace it.",1361232000,48,661,4.171875
5399774,5,B00A8KJLPM,"I agree totally that this is a terrific adaptation of the great Maigret stories (though too bad it stops at only 12 episodes). Gambon and his supporting actors are uniformly terrific. And Budapest makes a super stand-in for 1950s Paris. The question here is this: How is this set different from the one that came out 8-10 years ago? Has the video quality been upgraded? (This was recently done to wonderful effect for the earlier Poirot shows. The Blu Rays are fantastic.) I see no mention of remastering the Maigret shows, which they definitely could use; no mention of Blu Rays. Until that happens, I have no interest in re-buying.",1361232000,32,633,4.763636363636364
5399775,5,B00A8KJLPM,"Georges Simenon's novel sleuth, Maigret, comes alive through actor Sir Michael Gambon, some declare to be the finest Maigret ever. It's period Paris underworld of crime. 12 episodes adapted from among 75 novels and 28 short stories of Simenon. Novel sleuth Maigret first appeared in 1930. Some episodes appear to be 30s while others are certainly mid 50s. Stumbling on this DVD set of UK TV crime is a delight. It proves again, nobody televises murder better than the UK, even in 1992-3. Realistic sets (though filmed in Budapest), costumes, props, cases, and dialogue.

Maigret displays characteristics making this series appear the forerunner of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Midsomer-Murders-Village-Case-Files/dp/B003YCI1XE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Midsomer Murders: Village Case Files</a>. Did Midsomer (1997-today) use Maigret as a blueprint? The style of sleuthing, even hubby/wife relations (actress of Mrs Barnaby actually appears in an episode), and the heavily peppering (like the who's who) of UK guest stars, make both great series look similar. CI Maigret is the early sleuth master of using psychology, a victim sympathizer, very polite, and constantly puffing his Briar. Supporting regular cast: Lucas (Geoffrey Hutchins); Janvier (Jack Galloway); LaPointe (James Larkin) and too many guest stars to name them all.

5399780,5,B00A8KJLPM,This is an enjoyable DVD.  My husband and I watched it and then I shared it with a friend.  I'll now donate it to my neighborhood library.  It is the complete collection so you're not left hanging...good acting and good mysteries following the writings of Georges Simenon.,1518825600,3,272,4.74468085106383
5399781,5,B00A8KJLPM,"We absolutely love this series.  Gambon is spectacular and this is really the only series I can describe as beautiful.  Its Paris and France in the 1930's and you are there.  Each episode is as wonderful as the last and the next, and this particular series will always be timeless in a way that series produced today just don't seem to be able to realize.  The trick with this series is that it appears natural, flowing, seamless, without effort.  This is the ultimate secret to movie making and screening stories.  Gambon is the perfect Maigret in that he captures the calm, highly cerebral character without appearing to ""act"" making quite effortless, each frame, shot and episode.  Fantastic!",1518825600,4,695,4.888888888888889

5399783,5,B00A8KJLPM,"I loved this series, and I watched all 12 episodes in a few days. I love detective fiction and I have all the books and movies featuring Sherlock Holmes, Hercule Porot , Colombo, Lord Peter Wimsey etc. Inspector Maigret is a pleasant surprise, and I've already started reading the novels by George's Simeon. If you like great mysteries, you should watch this set.",1518307200,,363,4.777777777777778
5399784,5,B00A8KJLPM,"Superb collection of this drama series.  Michael Gambon is terrific as Chief Inspector Maigret.  The supporting cast of regulars and the guest stars in each episode have been perfectly cast in bringing to life the characters from Georges Simenon's novels.
Additionally, the locations used for shooting the scenes makes the stories come alive as well.  The lighting, too, is crisp, not muddled and filtered like in so many British crime dramas to add 'mood'.
This collection is entertaining and very well produced.  A must for your collection if you enjoy police dramas. The stories move at a good pace, there are witty comedic breaks to lighten the tale as the hunt for the suspect progresses, there is seriousness in presenting the very different French style of the legal-judicial system and how it operates, the home life of the Chief Inspector is very French, too, showing the deep love and respect the husband and wife have for each other. So many interesting points that keep the pace of each episode moving along briskly and engagingly.
One more point I appreciated is that there is a real attempt to pronounce the French names of places, people and things properly.
All in all, I highly recommend adding this to your collection.  You'll want to watch the episodes again as they are rich in detail and entertainment.",1516924800,8,1323,4.914798206278027

I've always had a high regard for Michael Gambon and he seems tailor-made for the part.",1513987200,,252,4.229166666666667
5399790,5,B00A8KJLPM,"I first saw a few of these mysteries many years ago on PBS.  I enjoyed them then, but due to other obligations missed most of them.  The acting is superb and the writing just as good.  The location shoots are wonderful and have some beautiful scenery.  Just as good was the fact that sometimes Maigret doesn't win.  Villains can escape responsibility just like in real life, and sometimes he makes mistakes.",1513814400,,407,4.676056338028169

5399792,5,B00A8KJLPM,"Five stars says it all. It is a well done series based on the Georges Simenon books. Michael Gambon is excellent (as always) as Maigret. The only  problem I had was that somewhere in the third season, they just changed the actress who played Mme. Maigret. And that happens. It was interesting to see all these British actors playing French characters. Thank goodness they didn't attempt to change accents. It's a good series.",1512000000,,425,4.821917808219178

5399796,1,B00A8KJLPM,"The series in French is so much better.  Bruno Cremer  IS  Maigret .  Michael Gambon is a good actor but just doesn't have the nuances of character that Cremer brings to the role.  Of course the language makes a great difference , so for me , Maigret does not translate well into an English production.",1509408000,,302,4.418181818181818

5399799,5,B00A8KJLPM,"Historical productions. Yes this series with Michael Gambon was good when originatley shown on PBS.  But the video quality and sound was not very good. These 12 shows are a revelation of quality of vision and sound. This is what you missed in the original productions. Sorry that the Morse series which was filmed on Kodak negative film, which looses its print and color in a few years, cannot be brought up to todays standards. This Maigret is one that lives again on these new dvds and is a tribute to the Maigret writer Geroges Simneon.",1505952000,,539,4.614583333333333

5399805,5,B00A8KJLPM,Not the usual murder mystery detective stories.  You might not like if that is what you are expecting.  Its more psychological and Maigret is not flashy or action packed.  It doesn't necessarily present a series of clues that you can try to figure out.  But it is excellent in its own right.  I'll let others describe the stories.,1498262400,,330,4.620689655172414

5399813,5,B00A8KJLPM,Done in the early 1990s but still riveting today.  Top notch French detective sleuth Maigret ( pronounced May gray ) is played captivatingly by the great British actor Sir Michael Gambon.  There are many layers to his personality and his performance as a clever but understated detective.  His cases are interesting with enough mystery to keep you guessing. An added plus is the sets and scenery. A very good series that still holds its own today.,1482710400,2,447,4.855263157894737

5399831,5,B00A8KJLPM,"These are wonderful and a real bargain.  As others have said, it's a pity they only made twelve episodes.  Gambon of course is terrific with an unending series of great British actors you will recognize from so many other dramas. Saw Joanna David tonight and she has been on everything, for good reason.  Hungary stands in well for Paris of an earlier day and the stories are engrossing tho they would have to be longer than shy of an hour to fully flesh out a story.  I don't see any comparison with Midsomer Murders, as others have suggested.  Maigret is far more worldly than Barnaby and I enjoy them both.

My only small issue is the French pronunciation, especially Monsieur.  No, no it is not M'shure as we hear over and over.

More episodes please!  It is not too late.",1455580800,5,776,4.485714285714286

5399835,4,B00A8KJLPM,"I had taped several episodes off of PBS ages ago but wanted all of them in a more durable form. The quality of this over 20 years old series is good with some digital noise as might be expected. I am assuming this series was recorded on video tape rather than film. There is no information on this in the booklet included with the DVDs.
Gambon is a subtle actor with a mellow acting style and voice. He is exceptional as Maigret. This series is an exceptional value at the price and well worth investigating for anyone who is a fan of Simenon or detective stories. I especially appreciate the low key atmospheric nature of the crimes and the police response. Very refreshing with our pop culture need for extreme action and violence. .",1451433600,13,735,4.492537313432836

Michael Gambon is very low key in this show. It is sometimes so low key that it is hard to stay awake!  Maigret is a police detective in Paris. Interestingly, you rarely hear a French word. He is kind of a Colombo/Ironsides character that always solves the case, of course. Another interesting thing about this show is that Maigret's wife is played by 2 different actresses on 2 different seasons. The wife character changes quite a bit with the change of actress as well.

5399876,2,B00A8KJLPM,I have to agree with most of the negative reviews. This series just does not capture the atmosphere of the Simenon novels or the personality of Maigret. It's also pretty obvious that it wasn't produced in Paris. Another irritating side note: nowhere on the box or inserts or discs or on your website are the episodes listed.

5399881,4,B00A8KJLPM,"The only reason I give this series 4 rather than 5 stars is that I'm jaded.  After the Sherlock Holmes series (Jeremy Brett) and the incomparable David Suchet's Poirot, as well as Michael Kitchen's Foyle, Gambon as Chief Inspector Maigret has a number of tough acts to follow.  That being said, the short series (6 episodes) is well worth the time to watch it.  Set in France in the 1950s, I could relate to many of the scenes, having lived in the country during that time period.  The acting is well done.  The technical direction is about 98%.  (I caught a couple of anachronisms).  The scenery is excellent.  The stories are, if not exciting, somewhat cerebral and interesting to watch unfold.  For the price, the series is well worth it.

My only quibble is (of course) that Chief Inspector Maigret is French, but this series is an UK production, so it takes a certain suspension of disbelief to hear them speaking English but reminding yourself, ""it really is French they're speaking"".  They get around this problem by throwing in the occasional ""bonjour"" or ""madame"" or ""merci"", but it is a little bit funny to see the inspector in Paris, speaking in English.",1419552000,2,573,4.947916666666667

5399907,5,B00A8KJLPM,"Invariably, Chief Inspector Jules Maigret (pronounced MAY-gray) is compared to Sherlock Holmes. True, both use superior intelligence to solve crimes and, more superficially, both smoke pipes, but there is little else in this reviewers opinion that links the two great detectives. Unless, of course, you count the fact that both characters have been well-represented on screen in dozens of interesting and engaging mysteries.

Maigret stands on his own as being a wonderful, fun fictional detective to observe and enjoy on his own. There are several details from the twelve episodes that comprise the two disc, 12 episode complete collection release which illustrate the shows originality. Maigrets frequent touching of people (versus Sherlock Holmes general lack of emotion), for example, be it a hand on someones shoulder or cheek, is a nice change, strikingly different from most literary sleuths. And MAIGRET the series is full of fun touches in the productions design, such as the brand name Mercedes on a typewriter (there is indeed a tenuous connection between the famous car company and the typewriter manufacturer). There is always something to catch the eye and provoke a smile, even if the series is, by and large, low key.

One criticism that has been leveled against this manifestation of Maigret in particular is the opinion that the show is too English. A French series of MAIGRET was in production around the same time as this one in the early 1990s. No doubt with the Gallic actors speaking French and perhaps even looking more authentic, the French TV show may have an edge in this regard, but not everyone wants to read subtitles. The English actors combined with accented pronunciations of French names is, if one stops to think about it, potentially troublesome for some, but the show is so well done that even the Eastern European locations substituting for France are entirely convincing (let alone the English actors). And if you get right down to it, why not just enjoy both versions?

However the series under consideration here is bolstered by one important key ingredient: Michael Gambon as CI Maigret.

Gambon might not be considered in quite the same level of stardom as his contemporaries, Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen, but in my view he is a much more interesting actor. Usually flamboyant and always memorable, Gambon as Maigret is subtle and even placid at times. Yet he never relinquishes his role of being at the centre of each episode, despite star turns from various guest artists, especially the perpetually weary-looking Edward Petherbridge in one of the later episodes.

Michael Gambon tells the story of how, as a young actor, he managed to snag an audition for Laurence Olivier, then the Artistic Director of Londons flagship National Theatre. Gambon very bravely assayed Richard IIIs opening soliloquy Now is the winter of our discontent as his central audition piece. Olivier of course had famously made Shakespeares King Richard one of his signature roles on stage and on film. Attempting Richard in the presence of Olivier took gutsor the foolhardiness of youth. Gambon had both. Oliviers reaction shall forever remain a mystery however, as Gambon, at a key point in the speech, grasped a wooden support column and swung around with a flourish, only to catch his hand on a nail in the column, tearing a huge gash which in turn gushed red. With blood pumping dramatically everywhere, no doubt exacerbated by performing-enhancing adrenaline, Gambon felt certain he had blown his big chance. Olivier, perhaps feeling sympathy, perhaps impressed by young Gambons willingness to shed blood for his art, hired him on the spot. That was Michael Gambons big break, without which we likely would never have had the opportunity to enjoy his superb interpretation of Inspector Maigret.

See for yourself. One might easily conclude Olivier would have hired him, even without the sacrificial display.",1397433600,,3937,5.134165366614664
5399908,3,B00A8KJLPM,"Bruno Cremer adds so much depth, understanding of people and anticipation, I saw MAIGRET on your site and jumped for it .... only to discover that Maigret was NOT Bruno Cremer.

Totally unbelievable to have the French chief inspector using phrases like ""bloody good show"" and ""by jove"".
Worse than that, the thing is very, very boring. The acting is extremely overdone.

5399934,3,B00A8KJLPM,"I enjoy Gambon, but he is just not Maigret. Too light, playful, well dressed. Still these are entertaining stories, very English in feel rather than French.",1390694400,,156,5.038461538461538
5399935,5,B00A8KJLPM,"This was recommended by a good friend. I have read most  of the books in paper back. I would highly recommend these to any pipe smoker, as the inspector is a pipe smoker. It is nice to see films where Smoking is like the old days. In my opinion this is better than Sherlock Holmes.",1390694400,,281,4.109090909090909

5399938,5,B00A8KJLPM,"I really enjoyed these programs.  My all time favorite in mystery shows is the Poirot series that used to air on PBS.  I enjoyed them for the period setting, the acting and of course the puzzle of the mystery.

The Maigret series is much the same, but the main character is not quirky like Poirot.",1390262400,,297,4.363636363636363
5399939,5,B00A8KJLPM,"Enjoyed this detective series.  Would have enjoyed more of them.  Interesting that it is set if France, but they are all in English.  The street signs and business signs were in French.  Good series though.",1390176000,,206,4.8

5399951,5,B00A8KJLPM,"I had already read all the Maigret books, and bought this set because I liked the books so much.  I loved the movies!  Gambon was the perfect actor for this series.  I'll be watching this again!",1387152000,,194,4.333333333333333
5399952,3,B00A8KJLPM,"The first series is very good work all round and to my mind a faithful interpretation of the novels, but in the second series, MAigret's character changed--he looked seedy and a little less intelligent, almst thuggish. The wife in the first series was perfect. The actress who replaced her had none of the warmth of the first one and their relationship was far less charming. I loved the novels, enjoyed the first series but was disappointed in the second series.",1386806400,4,463,4.8

5399954,4,B00A8KJLPM,"Very enjoyable entertainment.  Great acting, scenery.  Totally worth your money.  We loved it.  A little lighter than some of our favorite British actors, but still worth the money.  Michael Gambon gets a little tiring toward the last.  He seemed to be somewhat bored toward the end.",1384905600,,283,5.043478260869565

5399960,5,B00A8KJLPM,Maigret is a laid back French chief police inspector who takes on cases that on occasion are even out of his jurisdiction. He always gets him man or woman. The most noticeable thing is that no one has a French accent. So why a French setting? I have no clue. The story lines are good and enjoyable. Not much in the way of intensity but neither is there the over the top drama which seems to dominate American detective presentations. It's a worth while purchase.,1381363200,,462,4.447058823529412
5399961,5,B00A8KJLPM,"I had gone through, most of the BBC mysteries and was looking for another series to buy.  Gave this a try and it worked just wonderful.

5399963,5,B00A8KJLPM,"This is an absolutely wonderful series; the characters are neither too intense nor too shallow.

5399965,5,B00A8KJLPM,This is old school police whodunit with the class that  most of today's shows lack in spades.  The criminal element hasn't changed much but how sin and degradation is handled certainly has. Those of you who love to get to know the characters will find themselves wanting very much to be able to sit in a caf with Maigret.,1376956800,,321,4.423728813559322
5399966,5,B00A8KJLPM,"This collection is just a delight. I am a huge fan of BBC mysteries- Morse, Cracker- and had never heard of Maigret but it popped up as a suggestion and I am so glad I purchased this. Michael Gambon is a delight as Inspector Maigret. The series is based in France but the actors are clearly English. The tone is not as dark as some of the BBC murder mystery fare, but thankfully is not as lightweight as Midsomer Murders. Gambon is graceful (as someone else pointed out) and expressive. Maigret is not a tortured soul and does not have any internal demons. The police team he works with is a constant from episode to episode and make up a terrific ensemble cast. This series is such pleasure to watch. I am sorry they only made 12 episodes.",1376784000,,740,4.369565217391305
5399967,3,B00A8KJLPM,"It's OK, but not great. Hard to say what wrong with this. Excellent actors and so on. But it really doesn't work. The French version of ""Maigret"" with Bruno Cremer was much better, more atmospheric and better acted. It seems to me the British are playing ""Othello"" where ""The Cherry Orchard"" is required -- completely different pathos. The French version is more nuanced. Bruno Cremer uses nods and turns of the head to make a point, where Michal Gambon raises his voice, like a stage actor would do. He is over-playing. Not a good role for him. Skip that. Buy one with Bruno Cremer and watch ""Maigret chez les riches"", it's awesome.",1376697600,39,633,4.660714285714286
5399968,5,B00A8KJLPM,Love it!  Every episode held my interest.  I could not stop watching the series.  Highly recommended for every mystery lover.,1376265600,,125,5.15
5399969,4,B00A8KJLPM,"Simenon was the French master of mystery.  Maigret is the equal of Poirot and Lord Peter Wimsey.  It could only have been better if filmed in Paris with French actorr -- but the Brits are great, and Budapest stands in fairly well for the 'City of Light'.",1375747200,,254,4.382978723404255

5399976,5,B00A8KJLPM,The story lines are interesting and surprising. Maigret is quiet and not theatrical. I viewed one episode a while back and was glad to see that the whole set was at Amazon.

5399978,5,B00A8KJLPM,"I had seen these on PBS years ago, though I may not have seen them all.  Watching them again is a joy.  These may not be for everyone - not a high-action cop show where there are constant cars chases and things frequently explode.  Very little gore.  This is Maigret, the French detective done by Brits - so few authentic French accents.  I would rather have these clear crisp British accents than if they tried to fake it.  (Same goes for a faked southern accent in American film, but I digress.)  Michael Bambon is great and the stories hold the interest.  Nice relaxing entertainment.",1373673600,,587,4.576923076923077
