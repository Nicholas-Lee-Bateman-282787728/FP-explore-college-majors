7823580,3,6302215846,"If you loved Hemo the Magnificent, this one has less content and less animation.  It explains how genes are passed from one generation to another very clearly, explains Gregor Mendel and his work, and hints at DNA's role.  It's a good teaching movie for people with long attention spans who read at grade level (I'm a 7th grade science teacher) and completes the collection of the hardcore fan of the Bell Science series.  Bright, cheery and optimistic in tone. Special effects are seriously dated, but charming.",1237852800,3,512,4.930232558139535
