8560773,2,6301762169,"This is the type of bare-bones video I remember snoozing through in junior high social studies class. If you know nothing whatsoever about Korea, this video would serve as a simple albeit dated introduction to the country and its major cities and regions. Because this was produced shortly after the 1988 Summer Olympics, it imparts the message that Korea has more pride in its Olympic athletic complex than its own historical culture. Please don't be fooled. If you are looking for any level of cultural enrichment, this is not your solution. Instead take a look at the PBS video ""Hidden Korea.""",990662400,6,596,4.910891089108911
