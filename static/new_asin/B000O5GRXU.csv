2790936,5,B000O5GRXU,I saw this movie at the recommendation of a friend and was very pleased. It reinforces the message of loving your neighbor. Desmond Doss cared about other people from a young age right on to the end. He was a true patriot and strong believer in his faith. He did not back down and his God strengthened him to do things beyond normal human ability. Watch this film and learn how obeying God brings much happiness in life.,1227398400,3,420,4.397435897435898
2790937,5,B000O5GRXU,"This is the inspirational story of Army Infantry Corporal Desmond Doss, a conscientious objector who served in the Pacific Theatre in WWII. Frankly, it is one of the most moving pictures I have ever seen and I highly recommend it.

Desmond Doss grew up as a Seventh Day Adventist, his mother being the spiritual leader of the family.  She hung a picture of the 10 commandments in the Doss living room, and young Desmond studied those commandments and took them to heart - literally.  He was particularly affected by the picture depicting the commandment ""You shall not kill"", where Cain stood over a slain Abel, holding a club in his hand.  After being convicted in his heart, he vowed then and there that he would never take a human life.

Fastforward 15 years and Desmond Doss enlists in the US Army, intent on becoming a medic.  The Army accepted him, but instead did not accept his request to become a medic.  Instead, they tried to break Doss and turn him into a fighting soldier.  Thus came a series of hard-nosed company commanders who rode young Private Doss hard and persecuted him to give up his religious beliefs and take up a rifle.  The men of his own company rejected and ridiculed him, believing he was weak, a coward, thinking he would get them killed in battle.  They threw Army boots at him as he prayed on bended knees at his cot.  The persecution went on for months, yet Doss stood firm and refused to learn the task of killing.  He was totally isolated and alone, yet, remarkably, this young man did not give up his belief that killing was wrong.  He stood firm.  Finally, the Army relented and Doss entered the medical corp.

It was in Okinowa that Doss proved himself.  In the weeklong struggle to take ""Hacksaw Ridge"" from the tenaciously dug-in Japanese, Doss single-handedly saved over 75 men from certain death, many of the men who had ridiculed him for being a coward. Doss evidently had divine protection, for all the men who saw him wade into the Japanese machinegunners to rescue yet another downed American, said what he did was miraculous.  For his bravery in the face of certain death, Doss received the Silver Star, personally awarded by President Harry S. Truman.

This DVD documentary depicts the story of Desomnd Doss using stark visual images, the personal accounts of Doss' fellow soldiers, (some of whom Doss saved from certain death), and a return to the site of Hacksaw Ridge (now a children's playground).  Told through the words and tears of his fellow soldiers, the struggle to take Hacksaw Ridge did more than scar the physical body; these men are emotionally scarred by what they have witnessed and done.  Yet, Doss remains sigularly faithful to his beliefs.  He refuses to hate the Japanese, even going so far as to treat the wounds of several Japanese soldiers.  Doss's faith and beliefs learned as a child hold him up during the brutality of all-out war, and he earns the respect and admiration of a nation for his bravery and selfless actions.

The world is fortunate to have men of faith like Desmond Doss, for there are so few men like him.  You will be inspired by his story, shocked at the graphic brutality of war, and in the end, you will be blessed having known the story of a true man of courage and faith.

The Bible says faith can move mountains.  Desmond Doss moved his mountain on Hacksaw Ridge.  It is a story of a man you will never forget.  Buy it used, buy it new, share it with others, but GET it.  You will be blessed.

2790938,5,B000O5GRXU,"This is a story about an amazing man who refused to carry a gun, was persecuted for it over and over, yet never gave up his conviction. And as the story unfolds, the very people who persecuted him, not only come to love and respect him, but their very lives are saved by the man they tried to get booted out of the army for his beliefs. What an amazing story.",1213488000,8,359,4.070422535211268

2790940,5,B000O5GRXU,"Am amazing story about a man who stood for his principles despite the challenges and difficulties he had to face during WWII.  Director Terry Benedict, does a great job telling the story of Desmond Doss, the only winner of the Congressionl Medal of Honor in WWII, who refused to carry a gun.  The documentary follows Doss and a group of his fellow soldiers, some of whom had previously ridiculed Doss, back to Okinawa and the place where Doss had saved almost 100 of his fellow soldiers by personally lowered them down the escarpment knowns as ""Hacksaw Ridge.""

2790943,5,B000O5GRXU,Please watch this first....Then the Mel Gibson theatrical version. His version should have gotten many awards and cuts back the heroism and the protection provided by God so subject of the movie saved so many lives. The documentary states the reason for this was that the general public would not accept Gibson's version as being true because the subject person truly performed miracles with God's help because there were just far too many of them that happened. I am NO bible banger but I believe anyone who does not believe in God should watch this documentary and just TRY to explain how this guy did all he did WITHOUT God's help....,1490832000,,637,4.747747747747748
2790944,5,B000O5GRXU,"This is an incredible documentary about Desmond Doss, the first Conscientious Objector to win the Medal of Honor.  The documentary includes interviews with Doss telling his own story and how he single-handedly rescued 75 casualties on Okinawa during World War II.  Doss is so humble and soft-spoken as he tells his story.  The documentary is far superior to the Hacksaw Ridge movie which took quite a bit of ""artistic license"" and really didn't do justice to the true story.  Doss went through incredible abuse and hazing during his time in the Army, but he never let bitterness consume him or shake his faith.  It's an incredible story and an incredible documentary.

""The Conscientious Objector"" was well done and very informative. The documentary featured interviews with Desmond T. Doss, the Medal of Honor recipient who was the subject of the documentary, and his family and those who knew him.

It goes into more detail about Desmond's family life and his unit fighting in Guam before the Okinawa campaign.  It's a documentary so it's not exciting but it certainly fills in the blanks for those who are curious.  There does seem to be a problem with the copy on the Amazon Prime server because the left side of the image has been shortened and the first part of peoples names are cut off.",1478649600,,477,4.459770114942529

2791001,5,B000O5GRXU,"After seeing the trailer for Hacksaw Ridge I did a little research on Desmond T. Doss, the first Conscientious Objector to receive the MoH.  Looking on Amazon I found this documentary in which Desmond and some of his fellow soldiers tell his story in their own words.  If you have an interest in military history and in the trials and tribulations soldiers face on the battlefield this is about the strangest tale you will ever come across and to him hear tell it in his own words is worth the cost of the DvD.  From the time he joined the Army in 1942 until his unit got in combat 2 years later he was the most hated man in his unit due to his religious pacifism.  No one wanted to go to war with him in the unit.  However, once the bullets started flying all came to realize he was the bravest of them all as he moved around the battlefield like he owned it applying his medical skills to save his wounded comrades, many of whom survived the war because of his care for them.  If Mother Teresa wore a helmet and combat boots she would be called Desmond T. Doss.  However, don't let that description make you think this is a Sunday walk in the park.  Desmond's unit was in some horrific battles in the Pacific and he became the rock that gave them hope when all around them was death.  If this story doesn't awe you check your pulse.  It is humbling to listen to him and know that most of us will never equal his humanity and care about his fellow man.  Do yourself a favor and watch this.  I'm glad I saw it before seeing Hacksaw Ridge.  It will be interesting to see how well the theater version follows this hero's real story.  .....  I'm no film critic and can't comment on the technical aspects of the movie making that went into this.  Some may be put off by the simplistic approach that was used.  To me the approach permitted the entire focus to be on the storytelling, which was as it should be.",1473552000,5,1905,4.26183844011142

I didn't find it preachy at all - you simply can't tell this story without highlighting his faith.  His faith was his strength and his commitment to his mission.  The movie never tries to say that everyone must believe the way he did - it's simply telling his story.

2791017,5,B000O5GRXU,"This documentary was moving, heart-breaking, frustrating (what he went through) and amazing. This is one of the most beautiful war stories I have ever heard. My heart ached as the ""Objector"" himself told much of the tale with no malice whatsoever where most people would feel it mandatory. If there is a movie about this hero, please leave a comment below. If there isn't there really should be. This is a story that needed to be told. From a historical point of view, there were things this documentary discussed that I feel I should have heard about before and I was ashamed for not knowing (as I've read a lot about the world wars).

I think this film would be perfect for history classes, especially for young people, because it clearly illustrates the war while not including tons of gratuitous images of carnage. It covers history, but it's intimate...

There is something about this film that, either by the perspective of the film maker, or the veterans telling their stories, that fills a gap in my knowledge of or feelings toward the war. I felt more whole, having seen it, and while I didn't think I could feel prouder of or more supportive of our veteran and current service men and women, after watching this I felt utterly humbled by the bravery sometimes necessary just to ""get through a day's work"" and get home. By the end, all I could do was cry.",1457395200,17,1364,4.609053497942387

2791038,5,B000O5GRXU,"I watched this movie with my wife and daughter and it is truly an awesome and inspiring story. Desmond Doss was a conscientious objector who loved his country and wanted to serve during WWII, but his religious and personal convictions would not allow him to pick up a weapon or kill anyone. After being drafted by the Army, he stayed true to his values and despite many attempts to get him kicked out by many different NCO's, officers, and even his fellow soldiers (who often abused and insulted him), he was able to serve as a medic and not carry a weapon. After training at various posts in the US, Desmond found himself in the battle of Okinawa, one of the most horrific, brutal and grueling battles the US military has ever fought. It was at Okinawa that Desmond heroically saved the lives of 75 men in a single night, the actions that earned him the Congressional Medal of Honor. Desmond experienced many adversities in both combat and his personal life that would have broken many men, but his faith and steadfastness of his convictions and values saw him through. Even throughout the insults and hardships, the interviews in the movie show he holds no anger or hate towards those who treated him so badly. In modern times where ""heroes"" are athletes and reality TV stars who are praised for their bad behavior, true heroes like Desmond Doss should be talked about more and help up as examples of what it means to really be a hero. Desmond Doss was truly an inspiration and learning his story makes the viewer want to be a better person!",1421625600,4,1543,4.594202898550725

Medicine for the soul. Amazing only 1 dose of Doss and you want to find Doss in you.
I am sure many people have never even heard of Private First Class Desmond Doss, U S Army Medical Detachment.
A man true to his convictions, had grown up as a Seventh Day Adventist, refused to carry a gun in the army. One day this man is cleaning toilets & the next minute he is cleaning up a carpet of wounded & dead warriors. How did he get there? Why did the army keep him? How did one man save 75 men in Okinawa's Hack Saw Ridge? Superman in a camaflouge. How did this conscientious objector win the Medal of Honor?
A must see. It's a miracle.

This wonderful memoir discusses one man; an extraordinary old gentleman who was interviewed for this movie just a few months before his death. As he (Mr. Doss) and his former comrades discuss their individual dramas of the Pacific Theater we - the viewers - realize that human carnage, death, and mutilation was a day-to-day experience. Not for a day or two but for months - perhaps a couple of years. In our era we toss the word 'hero' out like confetti. If you want to see real heroes, you'll meet them in this flick. Hats off to Terry Benedict for allowing them to tell their story. A passing thought: as these old gentlemen relive their past, listen not only to their stories and shared experiences; listen 'between the lines' to what is NOT said.",1402444800,3,798,4.5874125874125875

While the approach is simple and rough around the edges, the story of Desmond Doss, - at first a hated outcast for his refusal to carry or use a weapon, later a hero among heroes for his saving of over 75 men as a medic in what seemed all but impossible circumstances - is so unique, and almost hard to believe that it pulls you in completely, whatever its budgetary or stylistic limitations.

I was surprised to see a few critics attack it as being an ad for Christianity, or for Seventh Day Adventists in the specific. I'm neither Christian nor religious, yet I never felt I was being preached at. It's simply the case that for this man his faith is what helped give him his courage and convictions. Would I want a documentary about Martin Luther King to not deal with how he drew his inspiration from his faith? Or Gandhi or the Dali Llama from theirs?

Told by the men who were there, including Doss himself, this is a film that speaks of the grace of refusing to conform, and being driven to do

2791091,5,B000O5GRXU,"I usually don't watch war movies or documentary but my husband being a Marine Veteran I decided to watch this as he had to work on Memorial Day.  I had planned to watch and tell him about it but this documentary is really very moving.

It tells of a solider, MEDIC who based on his faith tradition as a Seventh-day Adventist did not believe in carrying a gun but he wanted to serve his country.  The documentary includes soldiers who had treated this man very bad prior to the battle field and who admit they did everything to get him thrown out of the military. The change of heart to hear how these very men later would recommend Desmond for the highest military award is so amazing.

I admire the men who were men enough to admit that they were wrong and the sense of forgiveness shown by Desmond in truly loving thy enemy.  He appeared to be a humble and caring man.  Words can not express how I found myself asking God to let me be true to my own faith as this man.  It is a must see documentary.  I am going to purchase the movie for my husband to watch.

I highly recommend it regardless of ones faith as it shows just how circumstances of ""ONE MAN"" could change the opinion of an entire group of soldiers.  I think it is a must see and purchase or would make a great gift of a military person especially veterans to know that they are appreciated.  God Bless Desmond for having allowed at least 75 mens to come back and God only knows how many of the children, grandchildren and great grands owe their lives to the lives of these men having been saved by someone who was able to look past the diversity that he experience.  May we all look pass our differences and realize we are one in God and in America.",1306713600,13,1714,4.24
2791092,5,B000O5GRXU,"The subject matter of this ""war"" bigraphy is excellent for those who have ever wrestled with the question of whether a Bible believing Christian can OBJECT to their country's decision to go to war and yet go and serve his country in spite of it. Desmond Doss was an extraordinary man in an ordinary life and like everyone else, was compelled to make some very challenging choices. I consider this man who refused to kill other men, as much a loyalist or patriot as any man that ever wore a military uniform. He brings PROOF to the table that love of freedom, love of country and love of fellow man, can also allow for ""LOVE YOUR ENEMIES..."", as Jesus Christ directed his followers to do. A video that will help those who think for themselves, but also think correctly, see that staying true to your conscience will pay off in the end, even when contrary to popular public or political policy. It may cost you something as it did this soldier but it never bothered this brave man one bit. An excellent video!

My only regret: there are not more copies available at a reasonable price.",1302912000,2,1083,4.525510204081633
2791093,5,B000O5GRXU,"If someone ever makes Desmond Doss's story into a feature move, the biggest problem is that people will think it is fiction! I would love to see this story made into a feature movie. But how would they film the story of Desmond by himself rescuing 75 men? Lowering them one by one down a 50 foot cliff.

On May 5th the tide of battle turned against the Americans.  Enemy artillery, mortars and machinegun fire began to rake into the ranks of Company B, 77th Infantry Division.  Japanese soldiers swarmed out of their foxholes and caves in every direction.  Almost immediately 75 men fell wounded, and the remaining men were forced to fall back and retreat to the base of the escarpment.  The only soldiers remaining at the top of the cliff were the wounded, the Japanese, and Desmond T. Doss.

Reports of that day tell of Japanese advancing with rifles and bayonets to within a few feet of the medic, who was slowly lowering his men to safety. Then one of the American wounded would kill the enemy before they shot Doss. Japanese snipers reported that their guns refused to fire when they had Desmond in their sights! This went on for TWELVE HOURS!

The Japanese tried to kill UNARMED Desmond for 12 hours. They had just wounded or killed 100 American soldiers and drove every other uninjured man off the hill, but they could not kill or even injure Doss after trying for TWELVE MORE HOURS!

We make fun of Rambo movies because the action scenes are so ridiculously unbelievable, but what Desmond actually did was so much more amazing. In my opinion Desmond's story is the MOST amazing story of World War II.",1297900800,2,1608,4.5979020979020975
2791094,5,B000O5GRXU,"I came across this movie on tv one day completely by accident.  I am a huge history buff and WWII is one of my favorites.  I realized halfway through the movie that my mouth was hanging open.  I was blown away by Mr. Doss and his story.  How often do you find someone who stands by their morals....no matter what?  The level of integrity this man displayed was beyond reproach.  I would've loved to have met him to thank him for the lessons he taught me.

I find it ironic that the officer that gave him such a hard time in the beginning and tried to get him kicked out, ended up being the one who deserted his men in the heat of battle.  I served in the U.S. Army for 11 years, and I can count on one hand (with a few fingers left over) how many true ""leaders"" there were.  Real leaders lead by example, never ask their soldiers to do something they aren't willing to do themselves, and go to bat for their people no matter who they have to go up against.  You will find those leader's soldiers giving them 110%.

Mr. Doss never compromised, even in the face of evil, even when he was being humiliated by his fellow soldiers and superiors, and not even in the middle of treacherous battle.  He risked his life for the same people that a few months before hated his guts.  He gave, not even knowing, or caring, that he would get something in return.  He forgave those that persecuted him.  We should all be like Mr. Doss, the world would be better for it.",1289520000,2,1455,4.221014492753623
2791095,5,B000O5GRXU,"I just finished watching ""The War"" - Ken Burns' documentary about World War II.  I mention this because Mr. Burns is considered the consummate documentary filmmaker - but ""The War"" does not come close to Terry Benedict's ""The Conscientious Objector"" - a film about Desmond Doss, perhaps the bravest American to ever wear a military uniform, even more remarkably, never touching a weapon.

I was previously unaware of Mr. Doss, but this film blends first-hand accounts from the members of Company B with archival footage, and the result moved me to tears.

Desmond Doss was a Seventh Day Adventist, and did not want to violate the biblical Sabbath, Saturday.  Furthermore, his beliefs would not allow him to touch a weapon, much less harm another human.  But he did not want to use his conscientious objector status to avoid service - he trained as a combat medic and put his faith and skills to use saving the lives of an estimated 100 fellow soldiers.

The film begins slowly stateside - as our Hero is ridiculed and ostracized for not carrying a weapon.  Several senior enlisted leaders and officers try to humiliate Doss; if not out of the army, at least out of their company.

But the leisurely and safe pace in the U.S. changes as Desmond's unit is sent to the Pacific theatre where they face action from Guam (where a previous tormenting Captain shows himself a coward running away from the battlefield) to Okinawa.  What Doss does on Okinawa I will leave for you to discover, but it is significant that fifty years later, man after man who was with Doss on that island recount his bravery as tears run down their cheeks.

They were not alone.

An absolutely amazing story of faith and perseverance and bravery beyond anything I've ever heard of, you absolutely must see ""The Conscientious Objector"".  In the film Harry Truman is quoted as saying that he considered it a greater honor to award Desmond Doss the Medal of Honor than to be elected President.",1289433600,5,1961,4.752212389380531
2791096,5,B000O5GRXU,"Put the events surrounding Desmond Doss's experiences in World War II into a fictional account, and critics would pan it as sheer fantasy.  But it's all true.  When Doss died on March 23, 2006, the world lost a man as brave and true as any who has ever walked the earth, and that is not hyperbole.  Get this magnificent documentary and show it to everyone you know.",1288224000,,365,4.417910447761194
2791097,5,B000O5GRXU,"Every now and then a movie comes out which is unlike anything else I've seen.  The Conscientious Objector is such a movie.  This documentary examines the World War II experiences of Medal of Honor winner Desmond Doss, and the circumstances which led him to formulate and live his beliefs.

This film is not fast paced or loaded with special effects.  This movie is of a nature and topic deserving a thorough examination of a man of extraordinary heroism and moral courage.  I have studied the battle and walked the battleground in Okinawa where Desmond Doss made history.  His brand of courage is too rare and not retold enough.

If you are a teacher or leader and have opportunities to use video for training or teaching, I highly recommend The Conscientious Objector.  If you are a parent who wants to share with your kids a powerful message about doing the right thing, then I also recommend this movie.  If you just want to learn the story of one of the most humble and heroic men who ever lived and you've probably never heard of, again, I recommend this film.",1283558400,2,1065,4.622340425531915

I had never heard of Desmond Doss before seeing this video, but he should truly be a name that all people, especially children in school, should be familiar with. He had tremendous courage and faith.... the only truly important weapons necessary when entering any kind of battle!

After viewing the students should be ask what is a true hero.

2791107,5,B000O5GRXU,"This presentation is a must see for anyone interested in Pacific Theater WW II and in the nature of true faith.
The interviews with the veterans are well done and revealing as to actual combat conditions on Okinawa. The central person, Doss, had a deferment but elected to serve his country but with one major wrinkle. He did not want to carry a weapon and wanted to serve in the medical corps. Not many in that situation of war and the army at that time understood his beliefs, particularly his commanding officers. Yet, in the end they saw his unremitting valor as he would go to any wounded even Japanese in any dire situation. For this Doss received the Medal of Honor from Harry S. Truman. The documentary is superb. I will add that true faith is not a call to pacifism but to follow the one true God. This may well mean to uphold freedoms by force of arms if necessary.

Also, it should be noted the US Army ultimately respected Doss for his beliefs in the end, even though they did not agree with them. Russia, Germany, China, Japan of the time would have shot him with not a blink of the eye for cowardliness in the face of the enemy.",1245974400,2,1142,4.36150234741784

I told a guy about Mr. Doss and his first response was, ""He was a coward"" - just like the men initially who served next to him as well as his commanding officers.  In spite of the abuse he received from these men, he risked his life for those very same individuals.

The complete reversal of opinion that these men testify about in this movie tells you just how impressive the bravery of Mr. Doss was when things got rough.  A stunning turnaround of perceptions.

I had the privilege of meeting Mr. Doss in the last years of his life.  The Desmond that you will see in this video is exactly the man that I personally experienced.  I sensed no bitterness in his recollection of his experiences, and I had no idea of the injuries that he suffered until I watched this movie (I thought it was just his age that resulted in his physical limitations).",1522108800,,910,4.413173652694611

When he was in the midst of death, Desmond put his trust in the Lord and courageously tried to save as many as he could... it was miraculous.

The other thing that makes this documentary special, is that it features Desmond T Doss himself before he died, and he narrates some parts of this; it also features several other soldiers who were there too.

Hollywood took a lot of liberties regarding the real life of Desmond Doss, but I understand that it would be difficult to put everything he did into a Hollywood-style movie. Most Medal of Honor recipients earn that medal due to one act of bravery over and above the call of duty, Desmond Doss did it almost every time he stepped onto the battlefield.
