4134491,3,B003L195DI,"I'll give this three stars for the excellent presentation on Seattle, which was top notch and worth the price of the blu ray.

But San Francisco! This blu ray misses the best of that city entirely.

Why didn't it show Golden Gate Park? That is the best thing San Francisco has to offer. The Japanese Gardens there, or the Young Art Museum, or the Science Academy, or the botanical gardens? Golden Gate Park is the most unique, largest, and fabulous park outside of New York's Central Park. It is so incredible and has so many different things to do and see there that to omit it from this blu ray is a crime.

It touched on Haight Ashbury so briefly that it might as well have not shown it at all. San Francisco is famous for its inspiration of a whole generation of hippies in the 60s and 70s. Haight Ashbury still has many head shops and it is unique, because no where else in the world is there a Haight Ashbury.

This blu ray spent way too much time in Chinatown, which is nice, but it took time away from other amazing San Francisco attractions. It did show the making of sour dough bread, which is a San Francisco specialty, so that is a plus.

But how about the beaches? Why didn't it show the amazing Pacific Coast? You can see wildlife like starfish right there on the beach. Or focus a bit more closely on the street performers at the Piers, and visit a couple of restaurants instead of focusing on just one? What about the fresh seafood sold right there on the Pier in open markets? We all know about the cable cars, but what about the ferries? How about a trip up Nob Hill? What about the theater district or the night life?

You can tell I live close to San Francisco. This is a city that stands apart from others, and this blu ray most certainly did not get that message across.

But its presentation of Seattle was top notch, and worth the price of the blu ray. I offer no opinion on Vancouver because I have never been there.",1311033600,6,1941,4.301369863013699

8399207,5,B003L195DI,"An brief but very efficient overview on three west coast cities and areas. The presentation of the most important things to see was excellent. The quality of the Blu Ray is really very good, usually travel blue ray are very deceiving, but not this one, it's excellent! Rudi Maxa is great !!! A very good preparation for my first trip to Vancouver and Seattle, coming from Europe :-). - Still missing a Blu Ray like that on cities like New York, Philadelphia or Boston....
Add in 2018: nothing to change my review, but still missing the east coast area like Boston ....",1445299200,,568,4.578431372549019

I ordered this blu-ray after a recent trip to Seattle and Vancouver, and thought it would be fun to see what we missed and also to say ""Hey! We went to that!"" etc. While the video quality is EXCELLENT, and the host is quite likeable, I found myself pretty unsatisfied. I was thinking the videos would focus more on ""touristy"" things, and offer a variety and ""best of"" or at least ""must see"" attractions. I've been to two out of the three places in this video, and while entertaining, it didn't really offer much interesting ideas for me. Having never been to San Francisco as an adult, I did find some ideas, but after watching the Seattle and Vancouver ones, I can only imagine what was left out. Most likely, quite a bit. Each episode is only a half hour. I was just expecting more of a touristy type show, as I am not familar with this series. Maybe I should have researched it better, but don't have a travel show if you're not going to show me the best of what a city has to offer. Unlike ""No Reservations"" where you generally don't get a lot of touristy ideas, you still get a ""feel"" for the city and it's overall vibe. This video seemed to me like watching a jolly guy go to a city, eat some food, drink some wine, then quickly go over some things you should see that someone told him were cool things to see.

If you are planning on buying these videos as sort of an idea maker for a future trip, and would like to focus on ""touristy"" ideas, this video collection doesn't offer very much. BUT, if you have already been to these places and are looking for ideas that aren't so ""touristy,"" then you might like this blu-ray, as it has some odd highlights. SO, depending on what kind of traveler you are, you may find this blu-ray enjoyable.

Or if you are just looking for a staycation video, to enjoy places from the comfort of your own home, you will most likely be delighted with the great scenery, picture quality, interesting showcases, and likeable host.

3 stars for me. :)",1349827200,3,2005,4.367292225201072
