so long, the explanation lies here.  Traditions,tutoring

587494,4,6303168426,"'Backstage at the Kirov' was one of the first ballet documentaries I ever saw and, like many ballet film collectors, I have long prized my ailing, ancient VHS recording of this classic program. I was delighted to see it made available on DVD, but also cautious - after all, not every transfer of an old film to DVD is a success. So, what's the verdict?

Well, the good news is that this transfer isn't too bad. If you're looking to replace a tired and battered video then don't hesitate to snap up this release. There are just a couple of things worth noting. My main criticism is that the DVD version looks a lot darker than my video copy and I had to adjust the backlighting, contrast and brightness on my TV quite substantially to avoid missing much of the detail in the dimmer scenes.

The overall sharpness of the picture is nevertheless much better than video (as you'd expect!), and the film looks pretty much as it always did. No one has interfered with the voiceovers. The English subtitles are new but look to be unchanged from the original version - although I note the ballet mistress now berates the corps by saying ""This is lousy"" instead of ""That was lousy"". I don't know which is the better translation and am assuming someone just retyped the text without noticing the difference.

There is a gitch (black blur and flash of green) about midway through - nothing to worry about though, especially if your old video was as sparkly as mine! The only other minor disappointment was to find that some of the panning shots now seem to 'ripple' on the DVD. This doesn't affect shots of the dancing much, but was noticeable where the camera panned across staff gathered at a meeting early on in the film. Movement blur/rippling doesn't bother everyone to the same extent, of course.

So all in all, I was pleased to purchase this DVD as a replacement for video. It's just a little annoying that the TV's picture settings will need to be adjusted each time to see the film properly.",1327795200,11,1990,4.565826330532213
587495,5,6303168426,"I love this movie! I really enjoy seeing some of the ""children"" from the theater street documentary grown and dancing as corp members. For any lover of Russian ballet, this video is a ""must-have"" for your library!",1326412800,4,213,4.783783783783784
587496,5,6303168426,"This film was shot in 1981 and shows what life is like for the professional dancers(and some of the students) at the Kirov Ballet. It is the only documentary that shows us both Konstatin Zaklinsky and his wife, Altynai Asylmuratova, rehearsing together and separately for the principal parts of Swan Lake. Other dancers are also shown, such as Galina Mezentseva. Many classroom scenes are presented and they are very interesting and exciting, showing very difficult combinations and dancers getting very exhausted and laughing about it. I especially enjoyed seeing what happens to Zaklinsky practicing when he gets too tired and falls out of many of his pirouettes; he musters one last bit of energy and completes his pirouettes successfully and throws in the towel. It is nice to see this video finally come to dvd, since it has been on VHS.",1322524800,20,842,4.9787234042553195

587498,5,6303168426,"From the opening sequence of swans waiting to go onstage to the closing shot of a young ballerina just after her triumphant debut in Swan Lake, this documentary is masterfully conceived and filmed. Amid scenes of corps  de ballet rehearsals, classes, coaching sessions and backstage  preparations, the focus is the upcoming debut of Altynai Asylmuratova as  Odette/Odile in Swan Lake.
There is something fascinating here for  everyone:  for dancers, a chance to compare training methods and styles;  for balletomanes, scenes of past, present and future great dancers; and for  people new to ballet, an illuminating look at the hard work it takes to  become a great dancer.
For a sense of continuity, also see ""Children  of Theatre Street,"" a 1978 documentary about students at the Kirov  (there's a very brief shot of Asylmuratova as a student, sitting at a desk,  then looking at the camera), and ""The Leningrad Legend,"" a  documentary about Makarova's first return to the Kirov after her defection  many years before (Asylmuratova has become the Kirov's prima ballerina, and  several of her former classmates are also rising stars of the company).",962064000,52,1149,5.173913043478261
587499,5,6303168426,"Director Derek Hart takes us where we've never been and shows us what we've never seen backstage at St. Petersburg's famed Kirov Ballet--arguably the best classical ballet troupe in the world.  The company was responsible  after all for producing Swan Lake, Sleeping Beauty, The Nutcracker -- as  well as Baryshnikov, Makarova, Nureyev, Pavlova and Nijinsky.
This is not  just a behind the scenes look at a ballet company.  Hart's choreography of  the camera on stage with the dancers in Act 2 of Swan Lake is an inspired  evolution of Busby Berkeley's filming techniques of the 30s and 40s  musicals he is associated with.  Want to know what its like to fly across  the huge Kirov stage like a world class ballerina?  Buy this film and find  out.",915062400,15,747,4.7952755905511815

7840020,3,6303168426,"The one good thing here is that you get to see Mezentseva dancing at moments, and you see a young Asylmuratova. But for the most part other documentaries show a lot more about a dancer's experience. I think this is okay and maybe a must for Mariinsky fanatics, but the average person will probably not find this so great.",1362787200,3,321,4.4576271186440675

7840022,2,6303168426,"I was SO excited to watch this documentary... I love the beauty and the struggle that comes with the art of ballet and I was so, so disappointed with this film. Granted, it's quite old now but it just NEVER got going. It didn't delve deeply at ALL into the world of ballet, instead most of the film is showing the actual performance of Swam Lake. I wanted to learn about the dancers, see into their lives, watch their struggles, see their pain and triumph but they were so GUARDED and BORING. They had VERY little to say during the entire film. Very, very little. What little they did say was very generic, 'I don't really like class' or 'I was nervous, but I was excited'. Truly, this is as in-depth as it got. I'd be SO interested if someone re-made something like this that really explored further.",1356393600,6,801,4.418918918918919
7840023,2,6303168426,"I have been fortunate enough to start dancing ballet at 2 1/2 yrs old and become a principal dancer in my career. Ballet has been my life for as long as I can remember. I was really excited to watch this but I was shocked by some a lot of the things I saw. In a few shots where the camera showed the dancers feet during allegro I was shocked. More than one dancer was not getting fully over onto the platform of her shoe.  Others were obviously dancing in dead shoes to make their feet look better and girls were knuckling all over the place. These type of things are called cheating in the ballet world and I'm really sure most of these girls 3/4 their shanks. Sometimes what looks good for a short period of time can lead to a injury. Recovering from an injury very hard on a dancer because not only to have to you get to the place you were at but you must surpass it because everyone in the company has been hard at work while you are taking time to heal. Dancers work the hardest, we do things with our bodies that aren't supposed to be possible, and we love it. That being said it is all cut throat and I didn't think this film depicted what is like to be in a company. I know people have complained about not seeing the final performance but that doesn't seem the point of the film to me. In my opinion, the process is the most interesting because that is where discovery takes place. Thank you",1356134400,7,1400,4.166051660516605
7840024,5,6303168426,"I rented it and watched it several times. I am now going to make the purchase. This beautiful film carries us away to the difficult life of these amazing athletes who have the greatest passion for what they do, which shows so much when  they step on stage.",1353456000,2,256,4.333333333333333
