7600041,5,B01AGTOU00,I really enjoyed this movie the director really tried to stay as true to the book as possible. I also liked the actor's who played Keary and Zacari the book was a very good read and the movie was just as enjoyable to watch.,1455408000,2,223,4.090909090909091
7600042,2,B01AGTOU00,"I watched this movie with no true background on the story and I will say I want to read the book because I think the story will be good.

I do have to be honest and say the movie adaptation didn't do it for me.  I think the story was rushed so you didn't get to build an affinity for the characters and their relationship or believe that in a manner of 9 months these characters actually fell in love.  I think there are really nice guys out there in the world who face responsibility instead of run from it, it would have been nice to have some history on Keary and Jacari for that matter.  There were so many holes in the story that I was dizzy from trying to understand the dynamics.

I have to be honest that the actors who were probably first timers, took away from the story for me, though the young man gave a more believable performance.  The lines weren't always delivered free from error and there was no chemistry between them and the emotion in the delivery was sometimes off.  Add to that poor microphones/sound, bad sets, a lack of proper progression/timing of the story, and editing (I think this part may not have had the attention it needed) and it makes for a poor experience.

Again, I want to read the book, I'm sure that version will give me what the movie didn't.",1455408000,8,1285,4.3029045643153525

7600049,5,B01AGTOU00,I have to say this movie I watched and rewatched about 10+ times. The acting is not great but it seemed to be very authentic. Like the acting wasn't acting but I could see myself in a situation like this in real life. It felt more like two friends putting on a 1st year college film. I thought it was very cute. I might rent it again. Sound could definitely use some work.,1491609600,,372,4.109589041095891
7600050,4,B01AGTOU00,"Well, for what it's worth this movie is good. There's already another novel with the same name and plot by another author done in 2011... unexpected pregnancy by the son of a woman's employer. Just because this one is IR doesn't make it different enough. The characters are pretty much one dimensional and at times I can't tell if they are pronouncing the male protagonist's name as Kerry or Keary? The camera angles are all off, heads cut off in screens, and close ups to dang close (maybe it's the ""large"" screen verses ""small"" screen formats) but to never have a full on shot of the baby's face can't be blamed on film format.

One thing about good acting... when it's good you don't notice it but when it's bad it's easy to spot. In this the acting is hit and miss by everybody. Thus at times the movie felt like someone just didn't take the time to redo screens that really needed it. To have an actor fall in a screen was too out of place to be part of the script. Then there's the sound. Was there anyone actually in charge of getting the sound right? Who knows. And finally the one screen that should have been the climax was just bad, almost to the point of cringe worthy. Overacting at it's finest.

So why the 4 stars? Well, it's like starving, even a cold, dry hot dog without the bun or condiments can taste pretty dang good. You might even ask for another one. I've watching this four times now and probably will again.",1489449600,,1433,4.3632958801498125

7600052,3,B01AGTOU00,"This was an okay movie.  I expected so much more from it...more character development and believable love.  The book was so much better (imo) because I could feel the intimacy between the characters.  In this movie, though, the two main characters struggled to make their love seem real.  They had a lot of uneasy moments and no true connection with one another.  The acting seemed forced and unnatural at times.  Because the book was awesome, I gave this movie a 3.",1487635200,,466,4.691358024691358

7600060,2,B01AGTOU00,"I like the idea behind it, but not the execution. It felt like a college project with absolutely no funding to help with light, sound, etc.  The characters were unrealistic and the scenarios unrealistic.

The initial scene...her bosses son offers her a ride in the limo and her gratitude is to hump him in the back seat. Okay. A movie about a slut who gets pregnant.  And the bosses son who wants to be a part of their child's life...and won't take no for an answer. And while that is an admirable stance, it doesn't mean I want to watch a movie as long as this about that.  The characters lacked acting ability, and the script was not well written. Character develop was small.  In the end, you only cared that boy got girl for the sake of the child, not because they had any compatability on screen whatsoever (and that has nothing to do with the race difference).",1477353600,2,866,4.421383647798742
7600061,1,B01AGTOU00,"First of all, I don't know why they needed a screenwriter for this film, because 95% of the dialogue came straight from the book. Also, the baby's daddy's family, the O'Conners, are supposed to be extremely wealthy, yet the characters in the film looked like they were strictly dressed out of Walmart! I realize this was a low budget film, but surely they could have done a better job with the wardrobe.

I don't know which was more annoying about this film: one of the minor characters unintentionally falling down some steps, the non chemistry between the 2 leads, or the Debbie character looking like she had just left the trailer park. This film really annoyed the heck out of me!",1475712000,,684,4.652892561983471
7600062,1,B01AGTOU00,"Okay, everyone needs to start somewhere, I get it.  However, this movie proves that it is not just what you see on the screen that makes a good movie (not saying that is the case here), but what happens behind the scene has a big impact as well.

If a quality sound guy, director, producer, writer, lights, set ,actor and actresses, were not in the budget, I think that whoever started this project should have waited until it was.

The editor must have been working on this during his free time. There were no do overs, which made every line flub, painfully clear. Not to mention, I had to sit with the remote in my hand to change the volume for high to low and back to high again.

My boyfriend did not believe me that this movie was that bad. So I made him watch it. He believes me now.",1475539200,,789,4.2052980132450335

7600068,3,B01AGTOU00,"** Minor Spoiler Alert **
I love bad acting.  Let me explain more. I love when actors are attempting to act.. they have the skills but they fall just short of giving a good performance. The male lead gave me my bad acting fix. He was amazingly horrible. The female lead was okay, she carried the male lead somewhat.  It was the typical BWWM romance with a surprise little addition. I actually paid to rent the the movie (not included with my Prime Membership). I don't feel like it was a waste of money.",1472083200,3,503,4.340425531914893

8747321,3,B01AGTOU00,Ok the one good thing is I read the book prior to watching the movie and the movie played liked the book minus the steamy sex. I wished the male lead couldve been more built physically after eating the book. He look ok but couldve been more handsome. Also the baby wasn't interracial. Looked like it couldve been Melvins instead of Keary. In the book the baby had green eyes like Keary. As Ive been on the BWWM romance novel reading marathon it was nice to it one of these books on film. Id like to see move even if there are B movies. There should be bunch of them and maybe just maybe a handful of the would hit the mark.

8747326,1,B01AGTOU00,Where to begin.... The acting was extremely terrible. To the point that was laughable and you're wondering why this awesome book was turned into this hot mess of clips. The movie was also a bunch of badly edited clips that were put together to make this so called movie. I'm still trying to understand why they down graded the O'Conner's like they did in the movie. To the point that when Zacari told Pam that Keary was the CEO I laughed because if it wasn't for the limo that pulled up to the curb.... to save face she would have looked all kind of stupid. I'm also trying to figure out why they included the Ratchet friend of Zacari when she was not needed at all in the movie! Don't even get me started in Debbie ..... Just somebody please tell me why?! Question why in the would did the director or whoever put in a newborn baby cooing right before the nurse comes to get the baby? The list can go on and on as to why they should've either saved for a better movie or just never have tried to create this hot mess!,1505520000,,1018,4.198979591836735
