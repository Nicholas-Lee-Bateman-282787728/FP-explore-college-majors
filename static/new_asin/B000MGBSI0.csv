2731674,5,B000MGBSI0,"It was a pleasure to see this series after all these years. I remember when we used to eagerly await Tuesday nights at 9:30pm for our dose of the Melrose gang.

Season 2 is one of the best of the entire series with classic storylines throughout.  It's also where Heather Locklear's character really took over and she is simply brilliant throughout.  It's not just her though that has made this the classic it is. You have Laura Leighton who shines as Sydney, Marcia Cross as Kimberley, and then there is the annoying but likeable Alison (played by Courtney Smith).

Look out for those famous scenes ie.
-where Kimberley removes her wig to reveal a nasty scar from the accident.
-Sydney hits rock bottom and becomes a prostitute
-Amanda throwing her weight around at work
-Billy and Alison's constant fights

The show actually holds up very well after all these years. Sure, it's far fetched at times and trashy, but there are also some true heartfelt moments which gave the show a human touch.

This is a risk free purchase. A must own!",1179532800,4,1036,4.664835164835165
2731675,5,B000MGBSI0,"This season is truly outstanding.  There are lots of twists and turns in this show - you'll never be bord.

I should also mention that I have watched all 8 discs, and they all played without any problems.  I will say, however, that discs 7 and 8 are grainy, especially disc 7.  It is really sad that these discs were not re-done.  In this day and age there is just no excuse to not fix a disc to superb quality.  After all, we are paying for these discs and we expect quality.",1178928000,4,476,4.119565217391305
2731676,4,B000MGBSI0,"Watching these many years after the show first came out is a lot of fun; the first season was somewhat of a snoozer, but with Kimberly and Sydney on hand, season 2 becomes much more entertaining and campy. If you want great acting and credible storylines, Melrose Place is not for you. If you're looking for cotton candy entertainment and great zingers, well, it doesn't get better than Amanda (Heather Locklear) and crew. Have to comment on the DVD's themselves; Paramount didn't go to too much trouble in giving a high quality picture; the source looks like a VHS tape, and it was somewhat disappointing to read on the liner notes that episodes had been edited and the music changed. Looks like Paramount went on the cheap for this one.",1178409600,4,738,4.684615384615385
2731677,1,B000MGBSI0,"I love the show  however the people who put it on dvd ....did very poor quality control... I bought 3 sets at 3 different places .. searched the town over and could not find one that WASNT defective!!!!

on disc 3 it never opens up to the menu stage thus you can NOT play the disc.. ( 2 @ Walmart... 1 @ best Buy before I gave up) ... It likely exists on  many of the Amazon copies as well...  Poor quality control!!! I guess it is easier to recall thousands of sets than to perhaps spot check a few.. go figure!!!

Again my review is of the lack of quality control over the discs themselves... not the show!!!",1178064000,5,610,4.092436974789916
2731678,5,B000MGBSI0,"This is were being nice stops...and the real tacky,raunchy,back-stabbing,two-facing,selfish behavior kicks in. Heather Lockear's character ""Amanda"" really made this show,with her no-hold bars antics with co-workers,employees and her tenants. Melrose Place made Falcon Crest,Knots Landing look mild. You definately would have to put this series in the family with Dynasty where Heather started out and Dallas.

Nothing but a dysfunctional group of people all under one apartment complex....can't get no better than that!!!",1177804800,4,521,6.136986301369863
2731679,5,B000MGBSI0,"I was in high school when this show was on the air and every monday night was melrose place night.  Remember the tagline ""mondays are a bitch"" with a big picture of Heather Locklear?  This show was so much fun, I was too young to really get into Dallas or Dynasty or even Knott's Landing, so Melrose Place and 90210 were my primetime soaps! Season Two was when it really started getting good, season one was so boring, in these days of come and go TV shows, Melrose and 90210 were both lucky they survived such slow and sometimes absurd first seasons to really mature into addictive drama the way they did in their second seasons.  I can't wait to buy this and I can't wait for season 3 which is the best season of the entire series, in which Kim blows up the building, we meet poor little rich girl Brooke and watch Alison become a raging alcoholic.  So much fun, so much drama!",1170892800,9,879,4.3090909090909095
2731680,5,B000MGBSI0,"Season 2 picks up where Season 1 left off, but takes off in an entirely new direction.  Gone are the mundane ""after school special"" lessons of the first season episodes.  Madness, murder, mayhem, and backstabbing abound as Billy, Alison, Amanda, Jo, Jake, Michael, Jane, and Matt try to live life.  The relationships between the characters become more complex.  Amanda moves from messing things up between Billy and Alison, to driving a wedge between Jo and Jake.  Alison and Billy become engaged, but as their wedding approaches Alison begins having horrible nightmares which lead to startling revelations about her father.  Jo's new beau, Reed, kidnaps her and she ends up having to kill him.  Michael and Kimberly become engaged and buy a beach house together; Michael ""kills"" Kimberly drunk driving, is blackmailed by Sydney into marrying her when she finds out, and later dumps Sydney when Kimberly comes back.  Kimberly comes back wrong though, and runs Michael down in Jane's car, framing Jane.  It's been years since I've seen this season so I don't really remember much about Jane's new relationship or what Matt did in this season (other than help Michael cover up his role in Kimberly's ""demise"").

I highly recommend this season, as this is when the show became a ""must-see"" hit.  Also, Marcia Cross and Doug Savant (Desperate Housewives) and Courtney Thorne-Smith (According to Jim) aren't the only Melrose alum back on tv... check out the Courtney Cox show ""Dirt"" to see Grant Show (Jake on Melrose) in a very interesting role!",1170806400,11,1541,5.02755905511811
2731681,5,B000MGBSI0,"I think this season is already better than the first.  It's so trashy and yet addictive and I love it.

Continuing right on from the end of last season, Amanda throws a party to celebrate her buying the building and moves into Rhonda's apartment.  As you could probably guess, she starts setting her sights on Jake who is still with Jo.  Michael gives Jane divorce papers, and plans to move in with Kimberly.  Further on in the season, the drama continues as Sydney becomes a more permanent fixture.  She's the evil and manipulative sister of Jane and she's the character you love to hate.  Michael gets addicted to pain killers, Sydney blackmails Michael, Billy and Alison get engaged (but not before various troubles in their lives) and so on and so on and so on.

This has all the makings of a typical Aaron Spelling production and it is the kind of show you will take the phone off the hook for.  I love it and can't wait to watch all these episodes again.  Be warned; you will get hooked.",1169856000,14,993,4.466666666666667
2731713,5,B000MGBSI0,"I had the series bootlegged from iffer.com but when I get my refund back at tax time I decided I wanted the whole series regular artwork DVDS, I gave the disk's away the fake one's loved the show, opening music, cast and characters!!!",1374019200,,234,4.465116279069767
2731714,4,B000MGBSI0,It came quickly but the packaging was a little smashed. I liked that this item came quickly as I am addicted to the show. There has been a couple skips in the dvd's but overall good.,1351641600,2,182,4.083333333333333
2731715,4,B000MGBSI0,"I'm just getting into MP - I was like, 11 when it debuted on FOX. Anyway, Season 2 is full of drama and scary stuff. And there's a lot of people looking out the window on each other. I don't like how some stuff repeats from season 1, like when Alison and that guy are in his hotel room and the champagne spills on them, is just like season one with Billy and Amanda. And then Alison saw Amanda kissing Chas just like she saw Michael kissing Kim in season one! And Amanda's mom appears and they don't get along, just like Jake & his mom.

Billy is much more mature now then in season 1. He's manly and not all goofy. The triangle between Michael x Kimberly x Sydney is dumb... Mancini ain't all that, ok?  It's hilarious how they're all trying to murder each other. And I'm surprised Amanda went into business with Reed after telling Jake that Reed seemed odd to her. She's always bragging about how she's ""such a good businesswoman"", yet she didn't trust her instincts. In season 1, Jo seemed tough and street smart, but season 2, she's such a wuss.. Season 1 Jo would've dumped Reed as soon as he  pointed her gun at her.
I really feel for Jane in season II. she seems so nice and is getting the short end of the stick...I was really pulling for her and that lawyer dude...

I am looking forward to watching Season 3! Does Jo have her baby? Will Billy & Alison get married? Will Jake choose Amanda or Jo? Will any romance happen between Billy & Celia?",1312848000,,1452,4.2690909090909095
2731716,5,B000MGBSI0,"Loved this show in the 90s and still loving it. ""Melrose Place"", the spin-off of ""90210 Beverly Hills"" has great storylines and very good dialogues, love, intrigue, affairs, suicide,  pregnancy, rape, etc and many things more.

Special guests: Marcia Cross as Kimberly Shaw, William R. Moses (""Falcon Crest""), Rob Estes, Monte Markham (""Airport 1977"", ""Baywatch""), Mara WilsonGail sTrickland, Kelly Hu (well know in Aaron Spellings ""Sunset Beach""), Jason Beghe (Monkey Shines),  Linda Gray (Sue Ellen Ewing in ""Dallas""). Her character (mother of Amanda Woodward) opens the storyline for the following spin-off ""Models Inc."" which run sadly only for one Season with 29 episodes. Other characters from that show appearing here: Cassidy Rae (Sarah), Stephanie Romanov.

Other guests are: Thom Bierdz (""Young & Restless""), Stanley Kamel (""Monk""), James Wilder (who's appearing also in ""Models Inc"" but with another character), Matt McCoy (""Police Academy""), a young Ben Browder (who came later famous with ""Farscape"", ""Stargate SG-I"".

Actors Lonnie Shuyler and Rob Estes are playing 2 different characters in ""Melrose Place"". Shuyler is playing in this season for any episodes a young assistant doctor and in a later season an actor who is also Matt Fielding's boyfriend.
Rob Estes (Jossie Bissts real-life-houseband) is playing in season 2 a architect for one episode and in a later season as Kyle.

Cute/hot guys :-)  in small or supporting roles: Andrew Williams (""Chris Marchette"", is living now in Australia as singer), Christopher Gartin (""Ted Ramsey""), Jason Beghe, Steven Eckholdt, Ben Browder (""Farscape"", ""Stargate SG-1"").

GOOFS:  in a scene (a few episodes after Jo killed Reed),  at a photo shooting, when the camera follows Jo and Allison behind a mirror: you can clearly see the filming crew-member in the mirror: camera man and his assistant!!!

THE DVD:

The DVD quality is good but in dark scenes it could be much better. Its look a little bit corny. But don't be worry its only in a few scenes.

Sound: Dolby Surround

Subtitles: NONE  :-(

Bonus-Features: contains a few audio-Commentaries by ""Melrose Place"" (and ""Sex and the City"") -Creator Darren Star, like in the episode: ""The Bitch is back"".

Not very interesting bonus-Features: the relationships /the worst of the Season clips.

FAZIT: of course I also watching ""Gossip Girl"" but ""Melrose Place"" has definitive more story, better acting, better dialogues, each episode has more play time (approx. 44 min,  ""Gossip"" only ca. 38 min) and less sort-of-video-clip scenes. Both decades are very different but well... the age changes. :-)",1312761600,,2607,5.314634146341463
2731717,5,B000MGBSI0,"So you've all read the stories about the first season and how it's boring, well the stories are true. It was't until the last few episodes of that season that Melrose Place because Must-See. Season 2 begins with a bang, literally, as Alison's deranged ex boyfriend stalker blows his brains out on the phone while Alison is on the other line. The Michael, Jane Kimberly love triangle really heats up and then they threw Sydney into the mix, making it a 4-some! That was some craziness, they really went really over the top in such a quick fashion that you start to wonder who Michael is really with every episode. And then Kimberly dies...and comes back! The writers knew what they were doing here, making the show sexier, crazier, and better. I loved Kristian Alfonso and Lauren, she was such an uber biotch. I think they should have canned the Matt character along with Rhonda at the end of season 1, it seemed like the was just htere most of the time doing nothing, and his storylines were pretty boring and useless. The season just gets better and better and by Season 3, the end of each episode had so much drama packed into it that they left you wanting so much more that because all felt like Season Finale episodes. Definitely recommended.",1304121600,,1246,4.591928251121076
2731718,3,B000MGBSI0,"I did get exactly what I paid for, and I remember being addicted to this show when I was in high school and it was on TV for the first time, but I didn't like it this time around.  The storylines aren't that exciting and the characters aren't all that interesting.  However, the DVDs did arrive exactly as ordered in good condition and within the time expected, so I'm not unhappy overall.  If you're thinking of getting this, maybe wait til it's really cheap!",1298332800,,460,4.4523809523809526
2731719,5,B000MGBSI0,love it i am already on disc 5 of season 2 love beening able to watch mp and other tv show i love to watch that is not on tv anymore great idea putting them on dvd love it.,1298160000,,172,3.4358974358974357
2731720,4,B000MGBSI0,"MUCH more exciting than Season 1, though I hear the show keeps getting better until the sixth season. Kimberley dying and then showing up again was crazy, and her scar was horrifying. I loved Jo's ""deep-sea"" storyline, and how she had to shoot the father of her baby to save her own life. And then the aftermath in court was great too. Allison and Billy were about to make their way down the aisle, finally, until Allison's visions of her father's molestation of her and her sister began reoccurring. (That was really creepy; I had to fast-forward through those nightmare scenes.  ) Amanda's sexual harassment storyline was kind of boring, and it seemed like they just wanted to do something with Linda Gray, who was just mediocre. Sydney, just the annoying little sister from Season 1, became the main villain of this season, plotting against Michael and her own sister, Jane. I thought the square of Jane, Sydney, Kimberly, and Michael is the most interesting aspect of the show. It originally started out as a seemingly perfect newlywed couple, Michael and Jane, and then transformed into a monstrous four-way relationship. Michael cheating on Jane with his co-worker Kimberly, and then sleeping with his ex wife's younger sister, Sydney, until Kimberly dies, only to wed Sydney by force, and then Kimberly comes back alive with a vengeance (and a scar), and everything just gets crazy from there. I'm excited.",1278892800,,1413,4.936974789915967
2731721,5,B000MGBSI0,I love Melrose place and will not watch the new one. It's just not the same no matter what they do,1257120000,,98,3.7142857142857144
2731722,5,B000MGBSI0,its awesome to own because no one runs it except the soap opera channel which i don't subscribe to. i loved the show and i got a great deal. it was only 19.99 when i ordered it.,1218153600,,177,3.810810810810811
2731733,5,B000MGBSI0,"Melrose Place - The Complete Second Season is my favorite of this prime-time soap opera. Heather Locklear, Laura Leighton, Doug Savant, Courtney Thorne-Smith, Andrew Shue, Daphene Zuniga, and hunky Grant Show continue to deliver the goods. I think Marcia Cross returns this season and boy she is some nut! I loved this show and now I can watch these yummy episodes anytime I want. I highly recommend purchasing this sinfully addicting show, enjoy!",1214611200,,447,5.136986301369863
2731734,3,B000MGBSI0,"Season 2, though enticing in its twists and turns, is painful to watch owing to its wretched picture quality. Even on a Sony Bravia 32"" by way of a blue-ray player(blue ray improves the picture of even regular DVD's by 2.5 times) there is visible fuzz on the screen. I cannot imaging watching this on a regualar TV and a standard DVD player. It's laughable how bad the characters look thanks to an abysmal video transfer. CBS needs to publish Melrose Place on blue-ray to make the show watchable, lest fans cringe like Michael when he learned Kimberly was ""dead.""
I realize all older shows leave something to be desired in terms of picture quality, but this is a mess! Here's hoping the DVD sets of Season 3 or 4 are better.",1203206400,,724,4.492424242424242
2731735,3,B000MGBSI0,"i recently got both seasons available (1 & 2) and they should have put a little more work on the menu. They almost didn't have any menus, no setup options. I bought it and didn't realize that most of the chapters didn't even have english subtitles. I would have like to have it subtitled in spanish, but at least in english on all chapters! great dvd though. should have been better.",1189468800,,383,4.408450704225352

2731738,5,B000MGBSI0,"Season 2 was ""Melrose Place's"" breakout season; cementing it in primetime soap history forever. This is when ""Melrose"" really began to rock. There are tons of awesome eps during Season Two. Get Season Two and your DVD player will sizzle!!!

When Alison goes back to Keith's hotel room to take him to the airport he tells her that he has been stalking her and then tries to rape her! This ep was sorta unrealistic (in a foolish way.)

Revenge 9/22/1993
Billy shows up at Keith's work to tell him to stay away from Alison. After being shot down by Alison over the phone Keith takes his own life. Sydney gets her kicks by cleaning Michael's dirty laundry.

Sydney takes a job at Shooters as a server. Kimberly catches Sydney in bed with Michael then runs to Jane for sympathy. Alison is jealous (yet again) when Steve starts to casually see Jo. By the way, I love it when Jane says to Alison, ""my sister, that's really sick."" Honey, she ain't seen nothing yet.

Furious with Alison (for spending Thanksgiving out of town with Steve), Billy goes to stay with Jake. Meanwhile, Syd goes to work for Lauren.

Strange Bedfellows 12/15/1993
Alison goes to Steve's ranch but (like Kirstie Alley did) realizes that he isn't the man for her. When Michael falls off the sofa (at Jane's apartment) Syd hears his agonizing cries and offers to help him, only after he agrees to apologize for the way he treated her. On the rebound from Alison and on the rebound from Jake, both Amanda and Billy spend the night together.

Under the Mistletoe 12/22/1993
Billy is able to sneak out of Amanda's apartment without Alison seeing him (although he is half nude.) I really like how they played the Christmas Music as Billy was scurrying through the courtyard holding his pants; it really added a touch of class & Christmas cheer!

The s ex is videotaped and an anonymous package is sent to Jane who subsequently throws Robert out in the middle of the night (when she finally gets around to watching the video.)

Arousing Suspicions 1/26/1994
After Michael rejects her (once again) Sydney tells Jane about Michael's involvement in scheming to break her and Robert up. Michael tries to explain to Jane but she throws him out anyway as he says, ""like I drove her kicking and screaming into the w horehouse."" Jane tells him that Syd has made her mistakes but she would rather have her sister in her life than his sorry self!! I loooooove it!!

The Young Men and the Sea 2/2/1994
Amanda and Jake invest in Reed's business. (Who knows why, because about the only thing that Reed looks qualified to do is strip.)

The girls' fight spills over into the pool as Jane says to Sydney, ""you are trash Sydney, with the rap sheet to prove it."" Later in the ep, Mrs. Andrews (Gail Strickland) comes to the beach house to try to get Sydney to come back to Earth. Syd says to her mom, ""why don't you take your broom and fly back to Chicago!"" And, she goes ahead with the wedding and the only guest is Matt (who little Syd is also blackmailing.) Michael takes Sydney on a honeymoon and implies to Matt that he is going to be a widower in the near future!

Love, Mancini-Style 3/16/1994
Michael attempts to try to kill Sydney but just can't do it. Matt confesses to Jane why in fact Michael agreed to marry her little witch of a sister. Jane uses this info to stir up trouble for the new Mr. and Mrs. Mancini.

The Two Mrs. Mancinis 3/23/1994
Billy goes back home with Alison for a family event. Alison begins having strange nightmares. Michael and Sydney show up at Gram's will-reading hoping to get a piece of the action when Jane is awarded $100,000.00.

In which Michael replies, ""trash today, bucking bronco tonight."" Levin has no choice but to promote Michael. Michael's finally starting to enjoy being married to Syd; as they kiss the screen pans very far away to the outside beach...to a watchful Kimberly! (Incidentally, Marcia Cross is unbilled in this ep, I suppose that was so no one would know that she would be seen at the very, very end!!)

The B itch Is Back 4/27/1994
Kimberly shows up, ""looking like a refugee from the night of the living dead"" as Michael put it (in Season 3.) Michael then dumps Sydney and she sics the cops on him. When Kimberly shows up again at the hospital Sydney faints at the shock of seeing her. ""Finally the response I was waiting for,"" evil Kimberly says.

Imperfect Strangers 5/4/1994
Amanda hires her mother's lover, Chas Russell (Jeff Kaake) which really annoys Alison because the only thing Chas likes to do is talk about his sexual proclivities with Amanda. Meanwhile, Sydney goes to Jane saying between pathetic sobs, ""I think I'm having a nervous breakdown, can you help me."" Jane says to her in such a hateful (and incredibly condescending tone,) ""No Syd, I can't"" right before she slams the door in her face! Later on, Kimberly threatens Sydney when the little idiot won't take ""no"" for an answer. Sydney's hooker party is broken up by the newly freed Lauren who also threatens Sydney's life. Boy, Syd isn't have a very good day, is she?

Devil With the G-String On 5/11/1994
Billy tells Alison to keep quiet about Chas (there is actually nothing to keep quiet about because Chas made all this up to start a little trouble.) Michael and co. find Sydney stripping under an assumed name, ""Jungle Jane."" Billy blurts to Jake that Amanda slept with Chas when he becomes drunk. Michael is demoted when Kimberly set him up to sabotage. Kimberly then bullies Jane into forking over money from the business and tires to use the money to take out a hit on Michael.

Till Death Do Us Part 5/18/1994
Jo just wants Amanda to step aside so she can be with Jake. Hilary Michaels (Amanda's mother) (JR's wife, Linda Gray, of course) refuses to believe that Amanda did not seduce Chas. Chas then files suit against D&D and Bruce refuses to support Amanda. Sydney is assaulted by a few street hookers. Kimberly consoles her and over some ice-cream in the park they plot to kill Michael. Billy's old college buddy comes to town for the wedding and gets really chummy with Matt. The two men share a passionate kiss, but FOX was too h omophobic to air it; so it was completely edited out. Jake and Amanda fool around and Jo catches him coming out of Amanda's place half nude. Jo then breaks it off with him. Amanda tries to butter Alison up in the hopes that she will not testify against her during the sexual harassment arbitration. Kimberly and Sydney attempt to kill Michael but Jane comes to his safety (by accident.) Kimberly steals Jane's car keys at the wedding. Just before Alison is to walk down the isle she remembers that it was in fact her father who molested her as a child. Mr. Parker (Monte Markham) threatens to kill her if she says anything. And Alison flees out the window and goes to Meredith's (Tracy Nelson) home in San Francisco. Chas' claim is thrown out when Hilary hears him taunting Amanda. As Michael is coming out of the hospital Kimberly runs him over in Jane's car. In syndication, this is a 2-part ep.

The Cast of Season 2 was awesome. It's hard to say who my favorite is. Perhaps Reed Carter. Wasn't he so hot? He looked a lot like Jake but he had some more meet on his bones. He was a crazy ex-con, but that didn't seem to matter to Jo. I loved when Reed said to Jo (when she broke out of the boat-dungeon that he put her in,) ""stupid Jo, really stupid."" I guess the writers liked that line a lot, too. Because they used the exact same lines (in a very similar plot) a Season later with Jo and Jess (Dan Cortese.) Although, this time it lost some momentum because Jess was no Reed Carter! I also really started to appreciate Syd during Season 2. She proved that she wasn't just a stupid hooker when she blackmailed Michael and then turned around and plotted with Kimberly to kill him!

Michael wins the hutzpah award. Of course by Season 2 he shows his true colors and we all learn that he's nothing more than a cheat. But he is intent on living his life according to his own set of rules. You gotta give him credit for that. I especially loved it when Michael set Robert up with one of Syd's hooker-friends. When Robert comes to the hospital and accused him Michael even admits it! And Robert says, ""Jane still knows there's a big difference between you and me."" And, Michael replies (without blinking,) ""There is a difference, I cheat with doctors, not WH*RES!"" I also liked how Michael used Ingrid (another of Sydney's hooker-friends) to blackmail Dr. Levin (Carmen Argenziano,) saying, ""trash today, bucking bronco tonight.""

(Very) Slight Continuity Error:
I am not sure which ep it is. Perhaps ""No Bed of Roses"" or ""The Tangled Web"" or another ep around this time. It's a very brief error, you have to be watching very carefully and closely. Jo comes to D&D to see Amanada. I believe it was about photographing Jake. Anyway, before she goes into Amanda's office, she stops and chats with Alison. You will notice that Jo's hair has that ""just woke up look"" with fly-aways. It was cute, but it looked somewhat undone. Anywho, Alison directs Jo to Amanda's office; more or less, you know how people at D&D just barge right into everyone else's offices. And by the time Jo gets to Amanda's office her hair is fixed! Keep in mind there wasn't a commercial (that would at least help to explain if Jo stopped and went to the restroom.) Nope, she kept walking right from where she was with Alison straight into Amanda's office! And when you look at Jo's hair (while she's inside Amanda's office) you can see that her hair is nicely styled. It's soft and flat without any fly-always. We all know that they film, take after take after take. I suppose the director noticed that her hair wasn't ""Melrose Perfect"" and decided to splice 2 scenes together? But couldn't he have re-shot the first part?

This season mostly deals with the dr micheals storyline... and janes sister becoming a women of the night... the writing is just bad.. and distasteful, as well as negative in light. Would like to have seen better more tasteful storylines.. not a season for anyone who is not adult. I won't go any further with this show.

8168700,5,B000MGBSI0,"In its 1993-94 Season, MELROSE PLACE turned up the heat, resulting in a funnier, sexier series. Alison Parker(Courtney Thorne-Smith) continues to see Billy Campbell(Andrew Shue), the hunky Jake Hanson(Grant Show) moves in with down-on-her-luck Jo Reynolds(Daphne Zuniga), and Jane Mancini(Josie Bissett) divorces the despicable Michael Mancini (Thomas Calabro), who shacks up with psychotic Kimberly Shaw (Marcia Cross).

That leaves Dr. Matt Fielding(the underused Doug Savant), who has an affair with a sailor; Amanda Woodward(Heather Locklear), who sets her sights on Jake; and the conniving Sydney Walsh(Laura Leighton), who sets hers on Michael. A lot changes during the year: Sydney turns to prostitution, Jo kills in self-defense, Amanda and Jo catch a voyeur in the act, and Michael and Kimberly end up in the hospital when he crashes their car. Though Michael recovers after a few episodes, Kimberly slips into a coma and then disappears.

Michael is told she's died; fortunately for fans, he was misinformed. Kimberly eventually returns, but though she looks the same, she isn't. Turns out, she's now a certifiable loony--and she intends to make Michael pay. As she memorably tells Sydney in the season finale, ""You're looking at human garbage... when Michael's dead, God's gonna do a jig.""

By the end of the second year, one marriage will have taken place, while another will be called off at the last minute. After an entertaining, if overly earnest First Season, MELROSE PLACE had found its footing.

The acting isn't always first-rate--the crying scenes are particularly unconvincing--but 31 episodes in one year must have been draining on the cast (most dramas top out at 23).

Guest stars include Parker Stevenson as a high-tech millionaire, Gina Gershon as a waitress/call girl, Linda Gray as Amanda's estranged mother, and future X-MEN star Famke Janssen as a high-class hooker.

A nighttime soap opera about the lives, careers, trials and tribulations of a group of young people living in an apartment building in the trendy neighborhood of MELROSE PLACE.

The show was a spin off of BEVERLY HILLS 90210 and starred Heather Locklear as the scheming Amanda Woodward, head of her own advertising agency and owner of the apartment building.

MELROSE PLACE also takes me back to memory lane to when I used to watch it on Fox every Wednesday night at 9PM after BEVERLY HILLS 90210 at 8PM back in the Fall of 1993 thru the Spring of 1994, which was of course before Fox moved MELROSE PLACE to Monday nights at 8PM before it's spinoff series MODELS INC at 9PM in the Fall of 1994.

I also used to watch MELROSE PLACE in reruns on Pop-TV and every weeknight on E! from the late Summer of 1996 till the mid Winter of 1999.",1388966400,,2733,5.028761061946903
