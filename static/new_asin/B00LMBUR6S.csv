6491196,5,B00LMBUR6S,"(updated 10/17/14)

I have the disk in hand and have viewed both versions and all the extras:
Disk 1 Theatrical Cut. This is from the film inter-positive, not the negative, the result is grainy and sometimes murky looking, but over-all leaps above the DVD and easily the finest presentation the film has ever had. Nothing has been done to this, it's just the producers cut as seen on film, vhs and dvd these past 24 years. DTS 2.1 stereo mix is all it comes with, no extras, commentary, etc.

Disk 2, The Directors Cut. This is 40 min shorter than the Cabal Cut, for a few reasons. The Cabal Cut contained nearly the entire Theatrical release plus ALL the scenes they could find that didn't duplicate events. Clive excised 20 min from the theatrical (about 10 of that is the ending) and added 40 min back. The result is 120 min, and still does not contain some of the scenes many of us thought it would, but does contain footage not in the Cabal cut because it was not in the work print.

Most of the new footage is in the beginning and end, added back are some moments between Boone and Decker that explain Boones not been in therapy for four months, it shows Boone slowing getting worse and worse on the drugs Decker gives him, and stopping at the club Lori is singing at (she sings ""johnny get angry"" in it's entirety"" the last 15 min is nearly all new, and the at least one character gets a fate not ever seen in any version.

The new sound mix is awesome, 5.1 DTS Master. unfortunately the score had to be recycled for scenes and that doesn't always work so well if you have seen the film as many times as I have and know the score as well.

The picture quality varies, though color corrected some scratches early on are visible. The new 40 min is from the original negatives and LOOKS BETTER BY FAR than the 80 mins left from the theatrical that are from the Inter-positive elements. Seems odd, they found the missing negatives but not the ones used for the Theatrical cut?

What's odd is what's missing. The love scene between Suna Sashi and Peloquin is partly in the extras, and actually discussed in detail in the documentary, but not in the final cut? I don't know if this was the love scene Clive has mentioned cutting out, or if the jail cell sex-scene in the book, but neither are here. The scenes of Decker talking to the button-eye mask are also not included, but two deleted scenes show that they didn't work on film, so while missed, it's better that way.

Over-all the Directors cut does not offer quite the epic Clive talked about or nearly all the scenes in the Cabal cut. Most of Decker's scenes are here, including some you might think must have been from the producer ordered re-shoots, but they work regardless and I'm happy they are still there. What this cut mostly offers are two things, a better sense of story and pacing, plot holes filled and characters fleshed and a better, more satisfying ending that mostly matches the novel. Also notable is the return of Doug Bradly's voice, not the silly, fake accent German overdub. Though it seems to return for one line at the end... Rachel's voice also seems to be overdubbed for the theatrical scenes and the actress's voice for the new scenes (guess they couldn't get her to come re-record her lines) it's minimal, but noticeable.

The extras are extensive, but don't expect all the deleted scenes, for reasons unknown they are not here. only about 15 min worth (it says 20 but the theatrical ending is pointless included, especially since it's on the theatrical disk!) Some of the VHS footage is here, but not much, the certainly didn't include all the cut scenes -- and considering the nature of the crowd work that went into this, not including every scene on an $80 set is disappointing. The documentaries are very thorough and even a little longer than they need to be sometimes. There's ample commentary tracks to wade through, easily 10+ hrs to watch every last thing here.

The packaging is heavy duty, not a cheap slip cover, the booklet is a nice, well printed touch. There's a new intro by Clive but not the original VHS intro (big drop of the ball there.)

Now, my original review, the story behind this thing.

After 20+ years the myth becomes real.

Clive thought all was lost, we all did. Morgan Creek had ordered extensive reshoots and 45min excised from Clive Barker's epic adaptation of the Novella ""Cabal"" and after years of searching, we'd all given up on the film elements with the cut footage ever being found, or existing at all.

Then a few years ago 2 VHS work prints where discovered, with the missing footage (grainy, washed and dismal but there) and a few brave souls re spliced the footage to match the screenplay, re-dubbed Doug Bradely's dialogue (it's his image and voice actors voice in the theatrical cut) and went on tour screening ""The CABAL cut""

Then, finally, last year Scream Factory announced they would restore the VHS as best they could and give a delux blu-ray. This year, the did one better, they announced that they found 600 boxes of negatives and prints and with Clive Barker's direction reconstructed and fully restored his original vision. Thus, ""Nightbreed: The Directors Cut""

One of the most sought after restorations in history of cinema, and fully unprecedented release, Nightbreed The Directors cut is must own for any horror / fantasy fan.

The story in brief, follows Boone, a troubled young man who's convinced by his doctor that he's been murdering families. after being injured in drug induced state he meets Narcissist, how he convinces to tell him about a place called Midian, a place where the monsters go, where all your sins are forgiven. Boone flees, but he's pursued both by his girlfriend, Lori (easily the most dedicated lover since Juliet) and Dr. Decker (the real killer).

In Midian,  Boone finds more than he imagined, after a run-in with some locals, he's transformed, beyond death, he becomes both the cause of there destruction and possibly their savior.

Nightbreed is unlike anything you've ever scene. There's a unique twist of Barker's combination of Horror and Fantasy, the movie tells a tale of persecution, the monsters are not ""good guys"" but they are not evil either. Echoing the violence of racial and sexual bigotry and hatred, ""the sons of the free"" converge on Midian and havoc breaks loose. In the center is a serial killer who wants them wiped from the planet, and Lori, willing to go to her death and beyond to be with Boone.

It's not for everyone. Nightreed was fairly low-budget, now sports a running time pushing 3hrs (turns out Clive chose to excise 20+ min from the theatrical cut, and added 40 min new footage, bringing this to just over 2hrs. There are no plans for the 2hr 45 min Cabal cut)and is a violent and explicit tale. That said, Barker weaves a world unlike any other and this may be the best cinematic expression of his world-building and epic story-telling skills. If you dare, come take a journey with the dead of night.

If all you want is the film on blu-ray plus DVD with no extras disk or theatrical cut, there's a $20 - range version for mass release available.",1404777600,80,7155,4.62253743104807

6491198,2,B00LMBUR6S,"What makes this movie tolerable is the great make-up, practical effects, sound design, and overall score by Danny Elfman. Everything else is just really bad. The story doesn't make any since. You don't understand anyones motivation to do anything in this film. Its just soooo choppy and uninspired as far as plot and story go. If you're really into special effects especially those from the 80's and early 90's then check this out simply for that, the make up and monster designs are really fantastic. If you're not into that sort of thing then just avoid this altogether.",1507248000,,572,4.846938775510204
6491199,2,B00LMBUR6S,"Hate to say it, but this is one of those rare occasions where the studio execs were right.  This version of the movie just blows.  I mean there's some truly embarrassingly cheesy stuff here that was cut out for the theatrical version.  I won't go into all of it, but the little musical number Lori sings is enough to make the originally released theatrical version easily more watchable than this thing.  Don't know why this director's cut gets such high ratings except that it's fans of the film from way back who are loyal to Clive Barker whether he's right or not.  In this case he was quite wrong.  I'm sorry to say it, but if this version here had been released way back when I was fifteen years old, I'm afraid it would probably be considered one of those awful movies that are so terrible and earnest that they are made great and enjoyable because of how bad they are.  This would have ended up a rifftrax flick.  I was very disappointed in this version, really expected it to blow the theatrical out of the water and deepen the story.  Instead it just removed what little bite the theatrical version ever had.  Sure, it follows the book more closely, but that's not always a good thing.  Unbelievable that the trimmed version of a movie can be less neutered than the director's cut.",1504051200,,1290,4.493562231759657

6491201,5,B00LMBUR6S,The first time I saw this movie was years ago and it was a well used rental from Hastings.  It is good to get to see it again and I love the extra footage.  This movie has been one of my favorites for years and remains even more so after seeing the Director's Cut in a clearer format.  That old tape had made it difficult to tell what was happening in the original film so many years ago.,1502236800,,388,3.948717948717949
6491202,5,B00LMBUR6S,"Totally awesome story! Much improved over the chopped up version I saw years ago. I really don't understand why they make movies so short. Tell the story. If the story is forty five minutes fine if it's four hours and forty five minutes that should be fine too. If you can't or won't set through it then don't. Wait for it on Blu ray or DVD and watch it in halves. To me the story and entertainment are everything. I like to get lost in a movie. I like to go into the past or future or try to be scared to death. I don't know if I am so different than everyone else but it takes more than an hour and a half to slate my desires. At least some movies should, most should. This extended piece really gave more depth to all the characters. It also flushed out the story so much more. I felt it was more satisfying, as well as more true to Barker's book. Well please watch well worth the time.",1498262400,3,889,4.056818181818182

I've seen the original theater release and I feel this Director's Cut is a much better version compared to the one I've seen in the theaters.  Sadly, the original movie flopped at the box office, but I blame that on very poor promotion because this movie tells a very interesting story as it shows who the real monsters are.  If only this movie were successful enough, who knows how the sequel would've worked or maybe it could have been turned into a TV series.

It is a little out there if you don't like weird movies. But if you do like me you'll love it. The movie was directed by and wrote by Clive Barket (Hellraiser, Lord Of Illusion). And the score was done by Danny Elfman ( Batman 89, Batman Returns, Simpsons, Beetlejuice, Spider-Man and a whole bunch of other crap) giving it a bigger epic feel. If you like out there movies or monster or horror movies check this out. It sort of as a Stephen King novel mixed with a 80s slasher with monsters feel to it. David Croneberg (Scanners, The Fly, Videodrome, A history of violence, dead Zone) the film director is it and does a decent job of acting. Check it out its s solid horror or out there film.

Worth picking up even if you're not a Barker fan because of the unusual idea of a city of monsters and what happens when they meet the monstrous attitudes of regular people.  Fascinating work and point of view.  Shame there are no sequels- but at least you can watch this and the theatrical cut and make comparisons.

6491241,5,B00LMBUR6S,"Behold the Yellow Brick road to Hell.

Stunningly beautiful. Shout/Scream Factory re-created this imaginative masterpiece in a re-fixed clarity that defies the mind. The image is vibrant, crisp and elegant laced beauty. Shout/Scream Factory did an extraordinary job with this amazing Blu-ray. I absolutely love what they did. A beautiful work of perfection and gave this movie what it deserved at long last. One of the great imaginative experiences in film.

Shout Factory brought out a perfection on this quality Blu-Ray. A perfect added beauty to anyone's movie collection. The enhanced new form and amazing restoration is worthy of awards. Shout/Scream Factory and all those involved in bringing Clive Barker's vision to a new light deserves; around of applause.

Nightbreed will always remain dear to my movie loving soul and Shout Factory made it all the tighter in my movie loving soul. Clive Barkers original vision and the restored clarity gives this generation a whole new vision and a whole new film to explore and to experience over and over again.

Both versions of this special edition Blu-ray are worthy to own. The 2-Disc Special Edition Directors Cut and the 3-Disc Limited Edition are both highly praised by A Bucket of Corn and if there was a national award show for best Blu-Ray release it would go to Scream Factory's Nightbreed.

I can't speak enough upon the restoration and the restored footage. I was in heaven experiencing this whole new film. I first saw Nightbreed at the movies on a Saturday night in 1990. I remember it vividly. I was eleven years old. I was one of only about a dozen people in the darkened audience. I remember it so vivid because my mother had purchased my ticket for me and allowed me to go to the movies by myself. It was the first alone experience in a theater I ever had and it was the defining moment in building my love of imaginative cinema.

This was like that experience all over again. Nightbreed Directors cut is something so new and so fresh that I fell in love with it. Midian is alive. Scream Factory created movie watching bliss. I thought it was solid. I loved the restoration and the whole new feel.

I willingly accept an invitation to Midian. Nightbreed is a different style of film and is one of those over the rainbow oddness of horror. It's not for everyone. It builds upon the imagination. The never never land of nightmares. The monsters of the darkness and the boogie man of folk tales and ultimate nightmares.

NightBreed was written by one of my favorite writers of all time. A man who has a vivid imagination for the darkness and sexual reality of evil or the nightmarish world he puts on page. Darkness bleeds off the pages into the viewers mind and his movies are no different. I absolutely loved Hellraiser and Lord of a Illusions, Candyman, and Dread. He just has a way with creating interesting scenarios and vivid characters filled with backstory and beautiful wide imagination. Clive Barker is one of the greatest creators of different worlds, of different scenarios, of different darker realities. He is your fantasy nightmare, or creator of darkness that shines in so many different ways.

Sadly this movie never got the push and the reality that it deserved when it first came out in 1990. It is based on his short story Cabal. I think what the studio actually did to Barkers vision when it originally came out, was screw him over. Barker did protest that the company tried to create your basic horror film and crafted it as a slasher flick, but in reality Nightbreed was so much deeper. So much darker. It detailed characters and a vision into a fantasy reality that gets to the soul and the true nature of Nightbreed. Its a brilliance that only Barker could create. He tried to transcend that creation onto film but the studios basically destroyed his ultimate reality when it first came out.

Now amazingly it was originally intended to be a trilogy but because of its box office failure, which basically is due to what the studio did to the film; it never went forward. Sadly we never got to experience the rest of the stories. The rest of the characters never got to move on. Barker said that we all envy the power or the reality of being able to live forever. He wanted to create a mythology around these characters and create their own understanding in their own little world. I think that is what the movie does. We all can somewhat relate to and or become a part of the darkened imagination. I for one love monsters. I love the reality behind the monsters. I've always had an affection for vampires. I've always thought it would be interesting to live as a vampire, as weird as that sounds I think we all have that imaginative imagination to become some type of monster or some superpower that makes it stand out from so called normal (there is no normal in reality).

Nightbreed is a story that needed to be told in so many different chapters of film. It could be explored throughout a comprehensive understanding of each character or the reality of where all these characters came from or to further explore the adventures of these odd and interesting monsters. I think further sequels could've done this movie justice in exploring everything it had detailed. Barker had a vision and yet the studio would not let him finish or create his vision. They chopped his film. Originally it was supposed to be 2 1/2 hours but sadly when it was released in 1990 it ran 102 minutes, basically chopping out half of the film.

Starring the wonderful actor who I feel has never really gotten the stardom he deserves is the wonderful Craig Sheffer who plays your main star Boone in Nightbreed. Also starring the beautiful and stunning Anne Bobby as Boones girlfriend Lori Winston. Both shine in there parts and the chemistry between the two bring the film into all it's wonderful twisted glory with an old school style of love and a fleeting sunset kiss. The Director's cut was able to build these two characters in more of a personal reality which is a huge plus as more story or love is added to the film giving it a more personal touch.

Something else that stands out is the soundtrack. The original motion picture soundtrack by Danny Elfman is brilliant. I think it all creates something composed for a different type of film. It leaves and works so perfect in the end result of the film. I feel it brings to life a lot of the unexplored darkness to the atmosphere and scenarios of the film.  Elfman along with Shirley Walker crafted a memorable soundtrack that stretches the viewers mind and gives everything into one soundtrack. It combined so much darkness and yet it created that ancient old African tribal type setting with the music. The drums and the voices composed inside it was just an orchestrated odd masterpiece of music.

Through horrible bad marketing and lack of promotion and the ultimate horrible editing and chopping of the movie, it failed miserably and pretty much faded away from the public into obscurity. Except for cult status. Except for the dear fan and the brilliant underground of movie lovers that know what the original product was supposed to be and even with its odd somewhat different film that it was in 1990; I still loved it. I still saw Barker in it. I still saw his darkened vision and his unexplored spiritual recesses of the flesh and of the darkness that we all can become afraid of and yet want to know.

I think Nightbreeds ultimate brilliance is the reality and basis of the films content. The so-called normal people. The normal world or the naturals as they are in the film are more evil and worse than the creatures in Midian. There's a psychological concept there. There's a psychology reality where anything that is an unnatural or anything that we don't understand we destroy. They are freaks. There monsters. They need to be stuck in the netherworld or ultimately destroyed by the so-called normal people which are the true monsters and not the Midianites.

Another thing that makes Nightbreed so brilliant is, specifically in this directors cut, is the complete imagery of the makeup and sets and cinematography. The fantastic make-up and special-effects which are stunningly brilliant lets the viewer explore these monsters as if they are real. The creatures and monsters are a make-believe that becomes an impressive masterpiece of makeup and of unexplored creatures of a dark nature. The fantasy monsters have a unique personality to each one that shine through their ultimate creation.

Now just for fun lets look at all the actor connections in the Clive Barker world that is in Nightbreed. Something on an interesting note is the actors playing some of the parts became Clive Barker regulars. Such as Simon Bamford who plays the character of Ohnaka in Nightbreed. He played The Butterball Cenebite in Clive Barker's Hellraiser and Hellraiser 2 and also many of the other sequel's. He also played in Clive Barker's 2009's Book of Blood. Oliver Parker plays the character Peloquin in Nightbreed. He was in Clive Barker's Hellraiser and Hellraiser 2 in small parts such as a moving man and a work man. Catherine Chevalier who plays the character of Rachel in Nightbreed was Tiffany's mother in Hellraiser 2. Nicholas Vince who plays the character of Kinski also plays the cenobite known as Chattering in Hellraiser 1 and 2. McNally Sagal who plays a simple part of the motel receptionist plays in Clive Barker's Lord of Illusions as Detective Edison. Bradley Lavelle who plays the character of Cormack in Nightbreed plays the character of Officer Kucich in Hellraiser 2. Kenneth Nelson who plays a simple part as an emergency doctor in Nightbreed played the character of Bill in Hellraiser. Now the big actor that is a stable in Barker films is Doug Bradley. He plays the character of Dirk Lylesberg in Nightbreed. All horror fans know him as Pinhead in the Hellraiser series which is 8 films. He also played in Barker's two short films in Salome (1973) and The Forbidden (1978). He also was in the Barker movie Book of Blood.

Also I have to mention  the wonderful cameo of a movie icon. The one and only drive-in b-movie master actor John Agar himself becomes a victim inside the nightmare that is Nightbreed. Agar needs no real introduction of his long and lasting career. From such classic drive-in features as Tarantula, The Mole People, The Brain from Plant Arous, Revenge of the Creature, Attack of the Puppet People, and so many others. It was a priceless cameo and a worthy experience to see this old school master of the acting talent of the olden days. Agar was a b-movie acting god and created so many interesting moments inside my movie loving mind and he being a victim of Decker in Nightbreed just is all the more iconic.

Now don't get me wrong I am not saying this movie is with out it's flaws for it clearly is a horror film and has the mistakes and flaws that many movies have. If I was to rate Nightbreed on it's imagination and makeup and strange odd and original style of story then it's a flawless masterpiece but I don't rate films like that. I rate films for the quality and the overall acting, direction, script and everything else that goes into making a film. Clearly this film is not for everyone. It has it's elements of a late night drive-in cult status film. It's flaws are simple yet brilliant all the same. From it's weird football shoulder pad wearing Berserkers to the clearly visible painted aerial shots of the cemetery. I over look these things because I consider this The Wizard of Oz of horror films. Instead of the yellow brick road to the Emerald city, its the yellow brick road bathed in blood to Midian. This has a style of story book imagination and an Alice in Wonderland trip down the hole into a whole other world and concept of reality. This makes me think and sends me back into a world where film was painted in techno color, but this time, the paint is thick and the story is thicker.

Now thankfully through Mark Miller who is the co-head of Barkers production company Seraphim Films went about looking and tracking down the missing footage that was cut from the film. Miller thankfully discovered some of the footage in the studio back in 2009. Basically after much fan support and uproar to bring out the beauty of this film; it worked. In 2013 Clive Barker announced that Shout Factory through its horror label Scream Factory would be releasing the film. Now this new version that Shout Factory announced would be a film over seen by Barker himself with an added 20 extra minutes that was not in the theater version and also contain 40 minutes of new and altered footage. Shout Factory along with Warner home video located the original film elements from the archives. Shout factory was able to bring the ultimate vision that Clive Barker had wanted and also all the hard work of Mark Miller to finally give the fan the ultimate edition which I am reviewing and obsessing over in this write up.

I have to say this is one of the most highly praised and anticipated Blu-rays of my movie loving career and when Shout Factory announced I quickly pre-ordered as soon as I could both versions and I proudly display them on my shelf right now. Shout/Scream Factory gives me hope and the exploration and the imaginative wonders of cinema through all their titles. They craft with ultimate brilliance and bring out some of the hard-to-find films in ultimate editions. This three disc limited edition is absolutely brilliant and could not have been any better. It is the tour-de-force of Blu-rays. The two disc Blu-ray is brilliant and amazing. Both versions are highly mastered. Highly created through stunning vibrant care and love. This film was restored and collected for a new generation to explore the wonder that Clive Barker's mind is.

I bought both versions and both versions are well worth it. The 3 Disc is amazing and the 2 Disc is amazing. I like the 3 Disc Artwork, booklet and special features because it gives so much more. But if you decide to but the 2 Disc it's just as brilliant.

If you buy the 3 Disc I feel this is possible one of the best productions of Special Features out there and the only other thing that comes close is Shout Factory's 15 Disc release of Halloween Blu-ray which I love just the same. Scream/Shout Factory is a company of perfect gifts to the fan. They know what the fan wants and they give it with heart and soul to the fan.

Overall:

I was so freaking happy when Shout/Scream Factory announced this ultra collectors orgy of perfect amazing brilliance on their part. They are a company that I find to be one of the greatest companies releasing films for fans by fans.

Finally Clive Barker's, rich imagination gets it's just do. Uncut for the first time so that all fans can get a huge boner (that is if you have a weiner) on it's amazing reality. Some of the coolest characters ever.

I was so happy to get this in the mail. For if you are reading this and have not decided to buy yet, what are you waiting for.

These are out to purchase on Oct. 28th. You can pre-order now. Their are two versions, the basic 2 Disc or the Special Edition 3 Disc which only 10 Thousand Copies have been produced which comes with special artwork and a booklet.

Also if you buy from the company and if your one of the first 3,000 you get special 18/24 posters which are just amazing and will grace my movie loving wall as soon as I frame them.

6491245,5,B00LMBUR6S,"Wow.  I'd always suspected that this movie had been ""hacked up"" (and not in the good way) by the studio suits...but this is nearly a different story altogether--one that's far truer to what any Barker fan would expect (especially after reading ""Cabal""). For those unsure of whether this is being over-billed (i.e., just a money-grab re-issue of the old w/a handful of otherwise useless deleted scenes thrown back in for fluff), you can toss those worries into Baphomet's fire; it does take on a somewhat more dated feel when it comes to the song performance by Boone's girlfriend, and the alternate voice track for Doug Bradley's character sounds painfully similar to his more-famous role (which, while not a horrible thing in and of itself, does detract from what evidence there was for lauding the actor's range), but the character/plot development so far exceeds that of the original theatrical release, it's clear the suits behind the first run took a dim view of their audience's ability to appreciate good storytelling.  I came upon this almost accidentally (still can't believe I hadn't heard of it sooner), and am SO glad I did.  If you like Barker's stuff--or if you're simply after a NON-cookie-cutter-hack-'n'-slash-yawn-fest-with-barely-passable-CGI--then BUY THIS immediately.",1445040000,,1289,5.3088235294117645

A lot if the added scenes were really bad and were rightly removed. But so many were cut out, the viewer missed a lot of details for Boones relationship... So adding them back made some sense. If you didn't like the first cut, you'll probably feel the same about this. But if you did like it, this version will keep your interest.",1438819200,,450,4.5
6491252,5,B00LMBUR6S,"This is the Blu-Ray version any fan should want to buy.
The BD arrived Brand new and unopened.
I found this cut of the film to be very good.
It really is a fantasy and not a Horror film.
As Clive Barker mentioned in His commentary Fox did not like Clive Barker's vision. And butchered the film  when it was released in theatres.
This is unfortunate.
I found the A/V presentation to be first rate with plenty of supplamenta material.
Unlike the netflix version which does not maintain good picture quality. I mean the quality of the picture keeps breaking down/collapsing.
Besides it's only on Netflix for six monthe.
After that you either have to Download it or buy this BD.
And I choose BD over Downloading any day of the week and twice on Sunday.!!!!!!!!

Twenty minutes longer with forty minutes of footage not in the theatrical release? Very much a whole new film. And you can feel it throughout. This isn't just some extra fluff to say it was longer. There are entire plot points that now make sense. The citizens of Midian are back to being the good guys.

This is a wonderful, beautifully produced, special Blu-ray edition set from Scream Factory. As you know, the Theatrical and Director's cuts along with extensive special features and goodies are added here, so, I won't bore you with what better reviewers can give you in, well, a better review. What you should know is that there is no end to the production value on this set and, where I would normally say ""Nothing can be worth that price"", I have to admit, this time, this one really is. This rivals Criterion quality and then goes above by adding a second version of the film and so much love in the packaging. I've never seen a set like this and I find myself wishing they'd done this for Lifeforce. I love this. That's all there is. I just love it.

At last, it is here ! The director's cut ! The movie as Clive Barker wanted it from the beginning ! And the quality is perfect ! The new footages are clean, with a very good sound. If you love Nightbreed, you definetely need this version ! More monsters, more story, a better beginning, the real ending. I'm a huge fan of this movie and I'm very happy I have purchased this new cut !
If you have never seen Nightbreed :
This movie is an awesome horror story. Please keep in mind that this movie is old. The special effects are not cutting edge. The theater version had been cut by the producer to remove all that made this movie unique : the fact that the good guys are the monsters. Fortunately, this producer did not manage to destroy the movie that remained a very good and unusual one. But this new version does justice to the world of Barker and to the wonderful and fascinating creatures he created.

Si vous connaissez dj le film :
Enfin, il est l ! Le director's cut ! Le film tel que Clive Barker le voulait depuis le dbut ! Et la qualit est nickel. Les nouvelles scnes sont propres, avec un trs bon son. Si vous aimez Nightbreed, il vous faut dfinitivement cette version ! Plus de monstres, plus d'histoire, un dbut pas bacl, la vraie fin. Je suis une grande fan de ce film et je suis ravie d'avoir achet cette version !
Par contre, il n'y a pas de piste en franais et pas de sous-titre en franais. Vous devrez lire le sous-titre anglais.
Si vous n'avez pas vu Nightbreed/Cabal :
Ce film est une excellente histoire d'horreur. Gardez bien en tte que le film est vieux. ne vous attendez donc pas  des effets spciaux super modernes. La version cin avait t coupe par le producteur pour tenter de faire disparaitre tout ce qui rend le film unique :le fait que les monstres sont les bons. Heureusement, il n'tait pas parvenu  dtruire le film qui restait bon et surtout original.

This ""directors cut"" is basically ""every piece of film we could find... including the garbage that needed to be cut"". I watched the whole thing because I really enjoyed the original theatrical version, but it took quite a bit of work.

6491304,2,B00LMBUR6S,"First off, I thankfully didn't spend the money to actually buy this on blu-ray, I watched it streaming on Netflix.  I ALMOST pre-ordered the limited edition version without ever seeing this cut of it, and I'm so glad I waited because I would have been really mad at myself for wasting so much money.  Being a huge Clive Barker fan, I bought this movie when it was first released on VHS and I must have watched 20 times. Apparently being in my late teens and being enamored with the visuals & character design must have clouded the fact that unfortunately it's just not a great movie. I know he was forced to make lots of cuts and changes to the story, so I attributed its faults to those factors. When I heard of the Cabal/Director's Cut, I was really excited to finally see what Clive's true vision had been. Now that I've seen it, I've got to say it was kind of a letdown. I have a companion book for the movie which has gorgeous professional photos of each creature as well as back story for each. The amount of detail in the stories and their design/makeup is truly impressive, and I remember thinking it was a shame that most of them were relegated to the background or just shown for a split second. This version rectifies that a little by giving the creatures a bit more screen time, but yet still never gives any of them any depth or context. The ending is completely different, but almost worse because it sets the tone for a sequel that will never be; plus it never really ties together all the many goings-on throughout the movie.  The original version had a ton of interesting themes and ideas, and I expected the added stuff to flesh them out and make the movie as a whole more coherent. Instead I got to see pointless scenes like Boone trippin' out and watching himself do it with his girlfriend (whaaa?) and then going to a club where we're subjected to said girlfriend screeching out a song & dance number (why??).  I give the rating of 2 stars because I honestly feel that Clive is a man of great vision and imagination.  There's a lot of it on display in Nightbreed, but unfortunately there is also a complete lack of focus... as if he had 2 or 3 different ideas for a movie and decided to condense them all into one. Sometimes cuts are made for a reason, and just because you found the footage 20 years later doesn't mean it's good enough to go back in. I had high expectations for the added material to make up for the original's shortcomings, instead unfortunately it underlined them.",1422835200,,2505,4.4369565217391305

6491312,5,B00LMBUR6S,"This is NOT a movie review! This is just for the product.  Great little package, but a little odd. The package contains 2 discs. You would think since this is a Special Edition Director's Cut one disc would be the theatrical version and the other would be the DC. Or one disc would be the film and the other the bonus features, right? Well that makes sense so Scream Factory didn't do that. Each disc has exactly the same content, one is a DVD and the other is a BluRay. Why in the high holy hell they did this is beyond me. Someone told me it was a money issue but I would have payed the same price if it was a single BluRay disc. I just wanted to see the director's cut I have been waiting on for 25 years.

Disc Contents:
Director's Cut of the film which is really neat, it even has a different ending
Introduction by Clive Barker
Commentary with Clive Barker and the restoration producer
Making of Nightbreed featurette 72 minutes
Makeup effects featurette 42 minutes
2nd unit shooting featurette 20 minutes
Theatrical Trailer
Not a bad selection of bonus features for a cult classic
The other disc is a DVD with the exact same film and features. Exactly the same, right down to the crappy cheaply designed menu. The only difference between the two is one has a really clear high definition transfer and the other is a DVD.

If you're interested, here is what I did with the extra disc....
I have the original theatrical release on DVD and a friend who won't upgrade to bluray for some dumb reason. I put the Director's Cut DVD in the theatrical release case and gave it to him. I took the theatrical release DVD and put it in the place previously occupied by the DC DVD and now I have both versions in one bluray case. Yay me!",1421020800,,1731,4.352941176470588

6491321,3,B00LMBUR6S,"While it's nice to see this title on Blu-Ray with special features, the marketing for this product is extremely misleading. According to the box and the introduction, there's about 40 minutes of new footage, with a net addition of 20+ minutes running time. Aside from an awful musical number and a tweaked (albeit improved) ending, I couldn't tell you where the other additions lie. This film feels almost identical to the original release. For that, it loses a star.

Still, if you don't already own the film - or you're interested in the special features (like I was), it's definitely worth picking up. Just don't buy it thinking that the ""director's cut"" addresses any of the core problems of the original release.",1419465600,,717,4.877049180327869

This is a beautiful package.  The picture here doesn't do it justice.  The 3 Blu-ray discs are presented in two plastic cases house within a gorgeous hard illustrated slipcase.  Also included is a booklet containing character photographs and an essay on the history of the restoration.
The Directors Cut and the Theatrical Cut have both been remastered for both picture and sound, and they've done a wonderful job.  Most notably, the audio for the character Lylesberg has been re-recorded by Doug Bradley (Pinhead in the Hellraiser series).  His character now has the gravitas it always needed.
Although it's quite an expensive package, the combination of the two versions of the film and the extensive special features only contained in this edition make it worth the money.  Highly recommended.",1419292800,,867,5.15

6491326,5,B00LMBUR6S,"I've never really been a fan of NIGHTBREED; I always preferred HELLRAISER myself. I guess I never felt like a marginalized group so the WIZARD OF OZ quality it held never appealed to me. Nevertheless, I've always been a fan of restored master edition films and so I bought it blind when the price dropped to $52.

My money was well spent.

For starters, the sleeve is a very sturdy box with a frosted texture surface containing 2 blu-ray cases and a booklet. One case is the 2-disc director's cut and the second is the original theatrical release.

But what is TRULY AMAZING is how incredible the transfer is. The film has been restored by re-integrating the actual film stock that was assumed lost for 20+ years, and because it went untouched for so long, that footage looks as new as the day it was shot. The ""lost"" footage is in some cases in better shape than the footage that was in the theatrical edition, but the consistency of the image is very close nonetheless: the digital color correction and restoration has made both sets of footage almost identical in terms of quality. Now, the film WAS shot in 1989 so the lighting is softer and more diffused than modern films, but there's no loss of detail in this effect. Grain is surprisingly light and the blacks are quite rich, but then again, the film was lit surprisingly bright, even with the dark scenes.

The special features are a tad off-kilter because the featurettes about the making-of are split between the 2 discs of the director's cut. And sadly, Clive Barker and David Cronenberg aren't interviewed in ANY of them; aside from the video introduction prefacing the director's cut, Barker is absent from this set aside from the audio commentary, and for the life of me, I can't imagine why. NIGHTBREED's director's cut sits up there with the great long-lost studio-mangled films like THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS, LONDON AFTER MIDNIGHT, and NAPOLEON...Barker should be all over this thing chomping at the bit for his victory.

So the set is expensive, but for people looking for the director's cut of their favorite cult film, or for those who want an excellent historical archive edition for their collections (like me), NIGHTBREED is not a disappointment and the price tag is justified for all the stuff it comes with. Now I waited until it reached $52 and you might wanna do the same, but I recommend that you deal with the price now before it becomes a collector's item you have to buy used for $100+.",1419120000,4,2469,4.706018518518518

It seems to me that all they did was cut out scenes and re-inserted scenes. I kept reading that they added 40 minutes of footage so I thought that meant additional scenes to what is already there. Nope, they basically just reedited the film and the results are lackluster. Im so glad I saw this on Netflix,(yes Netflix got the directors cut just a few weeks after the Scream Factory release),instead of paying for it. Soooo many more things don't make sense.

6491338,1,B00LMBUR6S,"It's hard to fathom how the director of Hellraiser and Lord of Illusions could have made a movie this sloppy and inept but Nightbreed is pretty much a disaster on every level.  While the material clearly isn't meant to be taken seriously Clive Barker doesn't do camp well and after a while the movie becomes such an unholy mess that it's hard to figure out what Barker was even trying to do.

The story concerns a young man (Craig Sheffer) who is manipulated by his psycho killer psychiatrist (David Cronenberg--the film's only highlight) into believing he's a murderer.  The psychiatrist also frames his patient for the police.  Added into this mix seemingly out of left field is the fact that Sheffer has recurring nightmares of an underground town filled with monsters that turns out to be real.

Clive Barker really needed to spend more time setting up his movie's premise.  We have no idea why Craig Sheffer's character immediately believes his psychiatrist when told that he's a murderer--most people would require a lot more convincing.  We don't even know why he was seeing a psychiatrist in the first place or why he eventually stopped going.  The opening scenes in Nightbreed feel way too rushed even in this director's cut--Barker tells us virtually nothing about his hero and gives the audience no reason to care about or root for him--a situation made worse by future straight to video star Craig Sheffer's weak leading man performance.

The effects and monster make-up in Nightbreed are surprisingly cheesy--the monsters frequently look more rubbery than alive and the underground town that they inhabit seems severely under-realized, possibly because there wasn't enough money in the budget for decent production design.

If this wasn't a Clive Barker movie I have no doubt it would have been completely forgotten by now but Barker has a lot of admirers who are clearly willing to give him the benefit of the doubt so Nightbreed has its fans, even if it does nothing to deserve them.",1418169600,4,1998,4.937313432835821

6491340,2,B00LMBUR6S,"Off. I happened to be in video distribution when this was first released on VHS (did I say that out loud?) and it was rather well received. Video rental stores did well with it and I remember liking it well enough. Well....many years have passed and this director's cut has popped up. Advocates of the film seem to like a lot so I keyed it up. What a mistake. This was two hours that seemed like two days.

Here's the scoop. Aaron Boone (Craig Sheffer) is having bad dreams involving murder. He visits his shrink (David Cronenberg) whom he has not seen in some time. Cronenberg convinces him that the murders were real and he (Sheffer) is responsible. He gives him drugs, and Sheffer seeks out a place, Midian that crops up in his dreams. Cronenberg rats him out and the police kill him. He somehow comes back to life makes his way underneath Midian, a cemetery, and meets up with all manner of monsters where he finds he is actually a prophecy come true to lead these folk to a new land.

It's difficult for me to believe how much some people like this flick. It's pretty awful. Clive Barker is not a good director. I have to believe the producers put him on the project for his name and his previous success with ""Hellraiser."" But he stinks here. His camera always seems to be in wrong place and he cannot seem to setup shots for a smooth editing transition. Some of this might be due to budgeting restraints but what about the script? There is no story arc. The Aaron Boone character should be the typical reluctant hero like Luke Skywalker. You should see his gradual transformation as he accepts his role. Here, the transformation happens in the blink of an eye. And what of the Cronenberg character. I see no motive in him whatsoever. He wants to wipe out all the monsters. Why? How does he even know about them and why does he care? Why does he kill people for seemingly no reason? And then there's the local sheriff. He jumps in with both feet without knowing what's going on. Then he proceeds to arm a bunch of local, drunk hunters with state of the art bang bang and explosives to help wipe those filthy monsters out. Yup. Sounds like a good idea to me.

And the acting. They must have hired Cronenberg for his name because, as much as I like him as a director, he's awful as an actor. Sheffer is Okay but not much to speak of. His girlfriend (played by Anne Bobby) isn't very good either. She doesn't have a good camera face and I didn't believe her. Charles has had better roles. The makeup effects are uneven and the d.p. needed to be better. The music score and sound design  were actually pretty good.

This film is a mess. It suffers at nearly every level. I kept hoping something would happen to keep me in the game but it never did. It just stinks through and through.",1418169600,2,2786,4.391472868217054

6491350,3,B00LMBUR6S,"In my opinion, Clive Barker is not only one of the world's finest living writers, but he's certainly my favorite horror author of all time. His work never ceases to amaze, primarily because he's more interested in traveling outside the standards of horror by creating vivid fantastical worlds for us to visit and explore, but he also tells incredibly vivid and compelling human stories. I first saw NIGHTBREED when I was a teenager (and before reading the book), and was very dispassionate about it. I was excited by the incredible practical effects work done for the denizens of Midian, but thought it was technically shoddy, underwritten, and excruciating lead performances. But thanks to Barker's longtime friend and colleague Mark Miller, Barker's original cut aka ""The Cabal Cut"" was unearthed, and the fine folks at Scream Factory (who also created a fantastic blu-ray release of Sam Raimi's cult gem DARKMAN) were able to create an excellent high-def release of the director's cut of NIGHTBREED with oodles of extras.

However, even with the 40 minutes of alternate and new footage, NIGHTBREED is still not a very good film, but the Director's Cut is far superior to the original cut.

The alternate and extended footage gives us a greater glimpse into Midian's occupants, but also gives more time between Boone and Lori. Now, if the performers involved weren't Craig Sheffer as Boone (who is an actor I like in other films, but really not in this one) and Anne Bobby as Lori (who is just excruciating to watch), I might have even liked the original cut as well. But the performers that really work here are still Charles Haid as Eigerman and particularly David Cronenberg as Decker/Buttonface. Cronenberg's consistent calm, monotone delivery of his lines is just kind of perfect for who Decker is. Another problem that the extended footage doesn't solve is the overblown Danny Elfman score. In fact, because of the enhancements in the soundtrack, it's even louder and more bombastic. Now, Elfman's style is much more suited to Tim Burton films than anything else, but he has also proven that he can do restrained too (see his score for GOOD WILL HUNTING), but hearing a lot of this over-the-top score in this film doesn't do it any favors. Also still something that gets a failing grade is Barker himself. He's an excellent writer and a very compelling visual artist, but his skills adapting his own work and also directing it in all of his films, from this to HELLRAISER to LORD OF ILLUSIONS... he just doesn't quite work as a filmmaker. He has no real sense of space, pacing, and he seems to be self-censoring by not giving these film adaptations the eroticism the books had. It's just frustrating more than anything. The alternate ending is much more interesting and in keeping thematically with the book, but also sets up for a sequel that just will never exist.

While ""The Cabal Cut"" of NIGHTBREED is a superior version of its original release, it's still a better version of a bad film.",1417737600,3,3001,4.868884540117417

""The Cabal Cut"") to come out on DVD for several years. There have been exclusive showings at various art-house movie theaters, but I have never been in the right place at the right time in order to attend a showing. Nightbreed has always been one of my all-time favorite horror movies. I wasn't sure if I was going to be upset by the changes or not, but from what I had heard, the Director's Cut adhered more to the original Clive Barker story, ""Cabal."" The Director's Cut version of Nightbreed has a whopping 40 minutes of additional footage added which absolutely makes this film 100% better. It provides for more continuity and more character development. It is so unfortunate that the studio executives ruined Clive Barker's original vision by forcing him to trim down the original movie so much. This version is so very well done with amazing special effect makeup and more engaging characters.

And it works! What made me want to see it was an article I read in a magazine. It  said that this version is what Barker intended it to be before it was cut to pieces by bad editing. To be honest  just seeing the name Clive Barker and I was hooked. Barker is one of the kings of the horror genres. While I'm still being honest I had to rent the movie twice as I had forgotten to finish it. So everyone can see that I gave it a chance to impress me. The second half is the best part to watch so hang in there. The fantasy scenery was fantastic for its time. They combined prosthesis and makeups in ways that were unmatched at the time and some still stand even by today's standards. They even used some stop motion animation for a few scenes. The use of CGI was just hitting the movies making the special effects here stand out as well. Newbie Danny Elfman's music is easily heard throughout the film but his credit is for one piece alone. Sadly all of this combined was not enough to make up for the absolutely horrible acting. Apparently the actors were allowed to use accents of their own choosing. The actors playing the police in the movie often ad-lib with, ""Yeah!"", ""Me too!"", or ""Take that!"". While Charles Haid had been known as a decent actor he must have decided to play his character with a gonzo kill'em all attitude. Maybe he thought no one would ever see it. The overacting/reacting was almost comical at times. So watch it for the special effects but fast forward through the acting.

I purposely went for the boxed set to get both the director's cut AND the theatrical cut on Blu-ray so I could upgrade my theatrical from the DVD. But when I watched the Blu-ray of the theatrical cut, instead of the 5.1 audio track that was promised on the back of the box, I could only get a 2-channel stereo track. Knowing my DVD of the movie has a 5.1 track, I figured maybe there was a problem with my Blu-ray. So I posted my issue on the Scream Factory facebook page, and they were kind enough to respond to the post:

Sorry but there is not a 5.1 track on the theatrical cut on all discs. We discovered the misprint that it include it after the wrap had printed.

The misprint shouldn't even be considered the problem. They couldn't include the 5.1 audio mix that already exists since it was on the DVD??? So much for Blu-ray giving you the ultimate movie experience.

I mean, it is not everyday that you have this incredible author adapting his own tales for the big screen. This interpretation brought that mind's eye image of fantasy to real life. From the opening title to the final frame, I love Night Breed. However, NIGHT BREED: THE DIRECTOR'S CUT may be one of those examples where splicing in original footage that was altered or taken out entirely has had a slightly negative effect for me. It was fantastic seeing more footage with the amazing characters, but there is just this soar thumb feel to it because I have seen the theatrical version a thousand times over. Either way, it is very worth watching the director's cut if you are a fan, but if you tend to be very fond of the original you may want to buy the combo. I now regret that I did not.

6491389,5,B00LMBUR6S,"I am mainly a big fan of Clive barker's Hellraiser films actually
so when i found out that scream factory were releasing Clive barker's Nightbreed on blu-ray
well i was surprised, but interested & curious to buy it
i have only seen the film once on VHS back in the 90's so i actually forgot all about it
plus the Hellraiser films are the Clive barker films that are more popular than Nightbreed
so it's easy to forget this lost bizarre Horror

there's 2 blu-ray versions that scream factory have released
the stand alone Director's cut blu-ray which has only the extended cut of the film
which i didn't know there was a UNRATED cut which contains lots & lots more scenes inserted back in the film
and the other blu-ray release is the Limited edition Director's cut
which is a 3 Disc package
Disc 1 is the Directors cut, Disc 2 is Bonus DVD of more new special features
and Disc 3 is the Theatrical cut on blu-ray for the first time

i bought the Limited edition 3 Disc set, if i was going to buy a copy i might aswell buy the 3 Disc set
which has the Bonus Disc of very interesting new special features
i watched both versions of the film to compare the extended cut & the Theatrical cut
the story line of the Theatrical cut makes no sense
Morgan creek who Distributed NIGHTBREED back in 1990 cut alot of scenes out
to make the Theatrical cut only 102mins long
where infact the extended cut is at least 120mins according to the runtime on the blu-ray cover art
there are alot of differences between the VHS version and the new extended cut
the VHS version has LYLESBURG played by Doug bradley Dubbed in German accent
the story line makes no sense
the new extended cut has about 40mins of new scenes inserted back in the film
which Doug bradley's voice is not Dubbed so you here his actual voice in the film
there is lots & lots of new scenes of more bizzare monsters than there is in the VHS version
more blood & Gore in the kill scenes done by DECKER played by David cronenberg
for me i prefer the Extended cut which ties the storyline together

the picture quality is amazing for both versions, not much Grain at all beautiful HD transfers in 1:78:1 widescreen
both versions were given the exact same blu-ray transfer
the special features are worth the $70 i paid for
Disc1 has all new 70min making of Documentary TRIBES OF THE MOON
with all new interviews with most of the cast & crew
Clive barker is not interviewed thou
he does give a introduction speech to the new extended cut when you play the film
MAKING MONSTERS Documentary new interviews with Bob keen, Paul Jones about 40mins long
FIRE FIGHTS, STUNTS interview with 2nd unit Director Andy armstrong
and a new Audio commentary by Clive barker himself
Disc 2 is the Bonus Disc
Deleted & Alternate scenes, 20mins worth of it.
Monster prosthetics master class which continues new interview with Bob keen
Cutting Comprmise interview with editor Mark Goldblatt
 who edited the film for Theatrical release
there's also
Matte painting tests, Make up tests, stop motion lost footage, extended torture scene
rehearsal of Boone's Death
Extensive still Gallery Photos of on the set footage
Disc 3 is just Theatrical cut of the film that's all
plus a 34page booklet is included aswell, all new photos of most of the monsters from the film
plus new liner notes on the film

Disc 1 & 2 are in the same blu-ray keepcase, Disc 3 has case on its own

this 3 Disc set cost me a big $70 on amazon.com but Definitely worth the cash cause of the Bonus Disc
the 3 Disc set has sold out now on amazon only 2 weeks after it was released to buy
so if you want a copy try ebay.com you might be lucky to get a copy but probably close to $100 now or more
but Definitely worth the cash i have no regrets paying $70 or more

the Director's cut edition blu-ray is still available Directly from amazon listing for $19
and has the 70mins TRIBES OF THE MOON Doco
 plus the MAKING MONSTERS Doco plus the new Audio commentary by Clive barker
but you don't get the Bonus Disc with it
which has the Alternate scenes & other Deleted scenes plus other Goodies aswell
so it's up to you, your Decision which version to buy

i gave this 3 Disc set 5 stars for sure worth the cash all the way.",1415664000,2,4211,4.388461538461539

Movie: 5

I purchased Nightbreed: The Director's Cut (Limited Edition  3 disc) Blu-ray on August 3, 2014.
The disc was released on September 28, 2014 but mine was not shipped until October 31, 2014. I finally received it on November 7, 2014. Correct me if I am wrong, after paying the ridiculous price of $77.01, the movie should have been here on the 28th, at least by Halloween. I was really looking forward to watch it on Halloween, not 10 days after it was released. Why pre-order if I cannot get what I ordered in time? For that reason I give the seller a big fat 0!

Now to the movie. First of all, I am glad that the theatrical version of Nightbreed is included. Even before receiving my package, I knew that I would at least enjoy that version and now have it on Blu-ray. Of course, for $77.01, the original movie plus some special features will not cut it.

The Directors Cut is not bad at all. The transfer is better than I expected and the old VHS footage blends in seamlessly. Lets not forget that this is a movie from 1990, so please do not expect Ultra HD. It still looks pretty crisp though...

I do not believe that people who hated the original will now all the sudden love this new version. This is for fans whose only complaint was that the original felt a bit too disjointed and maybe help covert those who were on the fence about the movie and just needed a more cohesive storyline.

Decker feels like a proper antagonist now and he actually makes sense in the new version. There are some changes to other characters as well but I will not give away anything else here. I watched the original version quite a lot over the years and the new version only once so far. Some things confused me a bit but I think that is simply because I am so used to the old version.

I will not rate the special features because I have not watched them all yet. I did watch the deleted scenes and found it interesting at first how it switches from original VHS footage to the remastered material because it shows exactly how nice the final version actually turned out. After a while it gets a bit old though.

Objectively I would give the original version a 3.5 out of 5 and the new version a 4 out of 5; subjectively it a 5 out of 5 of course. I always loved this movie, flaws and all. That is the only reason I was willing to pay that ridiculous price for this version of Nightbreed.",1415318400,2,2406,4.2725274725274724

6491393,4,B00LMBUR6S,"Written and directed by Clive Barker based on his novel Cabal, Nighbreed follows Aaron Boone (Craig Shaffer), who suffers from re-occuring nightmares. When his psychologist Dr. Decker (David Croenberg) convinces him the nightmares are due to surpressed memories of murders he's commited, Boone winds up in a hospital where crazed patient Narcisse (Hugh Ross)tells him of Midian, a place 'where the monsters go'. Believing Midian might accept a 'monster' like himself, Boone seeks out the fabled city. Soon he's got the police and Decker on his tail, as well as his girlfriend Lori(Anne Bobby), and finds himself in a clash between the Breed and Naturals (humans).
  First released in 1990, Barker was never happy with the original version of Nightbreed. Film company Morgan Creek didn't get the original title (Cabal) or concept of monsters as the good guys and demanded cuts to the story, promoting it as a typical slasher. The result was Nightbreed being a failure at the box office, though it later achieved cult status due to home video release and Barker fans.
  In 2009, Mark Miller, head of Barker's film production company managed to track down a couple of VHS workprints of Nightbreed. One of these was edited together with a DVD copy of the original release by college film professor Russel Cherrington, forming what came to be known as the 'Cabal Cut' which was shown at various horror conventions. Fan support and demand lead to our current Director's Cut.
  All that said, what's different about the director cut vs. the original? Well it's rather hard to tell at times as the film is only 18 minutes longer than it's original 102 minute release. This is because some of the 'new footage' is simply alternate takes, giving story we've seen before from a slighty different perspective. As for the rest, we get much more of Lori and her relationship with Boone. This adds much to the story in terms of explaining why she's even bothering with a guy who obviously has several issues, and we even get a bit of her singing at a nightclub. Decker seems less in the forefront in this version, though he is still a threat. We get a bit more of Captain Eigerman and troubled priest Ashbury. Scattered throughout are more bits with the Breed(Peloquin and Shuna Sassi are lovers, go figure) and there's a different ending. My one question is however, since the 'Cabal Cut' is said to have run 155 minutes, what's in the 35 minutes not in the director's cut? Is it simply alternate or extended material, or are there still scenes the general public hasn't seen?
  The extras are informative and entertaining. Fans might be interested to learn some of the actors in the first couple of Hellraiser films show up as Nightbreed. Doug Bradley (Pinhead) is Lylesberg, 'spiritual leader' of the Breed, Nicholas Vince (Chatterer Cenobite) is moon-headed Kinski, and Simon Bamford (Butterball Cenobite) plays Ohnaka, the guy with the chest tattoos and bird necklace.
  Overall, good edition, though a bit ticked they didn't offer a version with the director's cut and ALL the extras on DVD rather than only making it available on the 3-disc Blu-ray $70 some dollar version. I for one don't need a disc of the original film, which could have been released seperately. Would have prefered a simple DVD/Blu-ray release with all the extras and leave the original version as a thing to itself. And again, curious what we are missing from the 'Cabal Cut'.",1415232000,9,3441,4.886792452830188

A lot of audio effect's were removed (lylesburg's cool voice is gone and replaced with Doug Bradley voiceover), removing a lot of his gravitas. It almost played exactly like the theatrical cut. Now, we get to see the motivations for a lot of the scenes we know and love. Boone's and Lori's occupations are fleshed out, more of her willingness to sacrifice her normal life for Love. The added scenes of Decker and Boone's relationship play out a lot more sinister and evil. Almost none of the nightbreed action and interaction's don't play out till the Hour mark or so. MORE MONSTER'S were promised!! It should be said more monster flashes and quick cut's of monster's posing has been added and that's it. I WANTED more Midian and there society (I guess none was filmed). There's more of the Son's of the Free (getting ready for battle and killing nightbreed) than anything.

Clive Barker (the author turned director) wrote the book, screenplay and then directed this.

I saw it in the theatres back in the 80's and always thought it was great but that something was not quite complete about it. But since I'd seen Hellraiser (Barker also) and it had really disturbed me I thought it must have been intentional.

I always ""got"" that it was a story about not judging books by their covers, because sometimes the monsters aren't the bad guys, but apparently there were a lot of folks who didn't.

The studio apparently didn't like monsters as ""good guys"" so they butchered the theatrical release of the film. Barker and friends found his old ""lost"" footage and were able to re-do the film more to his original intent.

There's apparently over 40 minutes of new footage, but only 20+ minutes of additional time added to the film (they replaced some previous content with the new, you see).

I agree the new story is more cohesive and the Blu-ray really makes the thing pop! For me it's one of those films I can watch over and over because there's always something new to see.

The bonus portion to the Blu-ray is the interview and the ""making of"" part and that IS here in this less expensive DVD. There is another more bonus filled version that goes for around $70 that I just couldn't justify.

6491401,3,B00LMBUR6S,"Im no stranger to looking past how certain movies have aged over the years. I can still enjoy a film from decades gone by and overlook their special effects and production values from the time. However, there are certain aspects I have a hard time ignoring. A lack of cohesive editing and scrambled arrangement is the downfall of Scream Factorys Nightbreed: The Directors Cut  Limited Edition.

Theres always been a lot of talk about studio tampering when it comes to the theatrical version of Nightbreed. Clive Barkers cut of the movie is a disjointed mess of scenes that jumps back and forth giving it a scattered and clumsy feel. It doesnt convey its creators genius the way it should.

If you look past all its negatives, Nightbreed: The Directors Cut  Limited Edition does a great job showing Clive Barkers talent at manufacturing characters that are both sympathetic at a human level and unique in design. The creatures found in the movie each have their own characteristics and look, much the way Barker did for the Cenobites of Hellraiser. You empathize with each one even if they do appear frightening on the outside.

Nightbreed: The Directors Cut  Limited Edition features a new 1080p high-definition widescreen transfer with 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio. The picture is beautiful and has never looked so good. The surround sound will have home entertainment audiences peering over their shoulders as the creepy environmental reverberations of Midian envelope them in terror.

From a religious standpoint, most fundamentalist Christians are going to have serious issues with Nightbreed: The Directors Cut  Limited Edition. The title group worships Baphomet, which is an idol or deity most commonly associated today with the Church of Satan. Aside from that, its referred to as a representation of the sum total of the universe  male and female, good and evil, etc. From what I understand, Barker is an atheist so its safe to say he uses Baphomet as a symbol of the latter. Either way, its pagan in design which won't make Christians comfortable watching it.

Nightbreed: The Directors Cut  Limited Edition is unrated but could easily hold an R. Theres some nudity and gore, but nothing that sends it into NC-17 territory. Theres the usual amount of violence and gore found in horror films as well.

Scream Factory has packed tons of great bonus material into the Nightbreed: The Directors Cut  Limited Edition. A new introduction from Clive Barker kicks things off when you play the movie. Audio commentary is provided by restoration producer Mark Alan Miller and other talent associated with the project. Cast and crew give new interviews for the release as well. They include Craig Sheffer, Doug Bradley, Hugh Ross, and many more. We also get other special features like deleted scenes, matte painting tests, a theatrical trailer, and more.

Its said that Clive Barker was attempting to create a world of horror the likes of what Star Wars did for science fiction. As far as characters and settings go, he accomplished his goal. However, the breakdown for Nightbreed was in its lack of cohesion when it comes to narrative arrangement. Its unconventional editing and thrown-together feel hijacked any chances of conventional moviegoers catching on to it. I do believe its ripe for a sequel in a day and age where older concepts and movies are being re-booted and given another chance.",1414972800,3,3391,5.021390374331551

6491406,4,B00LMBUR6S,"When I saw NIGHTBREED theatrically back around 1990, I remember turning to my friend after it was over and saying ""Whoever edited this movie must have used a hacksaw.""  Of course, I had no idea back then what had happened to the film behind-the-scenes.  Regardless, now we have a film more closely aligned with what Barker originally intended.  As others have noted, the result is a better film.  It flows much better now, without the abrupt jumping into unrelated scenes and lapses in logic. Don't get me wrong, it's still a flawed film (the only reason I docked it 1 star)...but it's a very unique one.  Looking at it today, one can find similarities to what filmmakers like Guillermo Del Toro ran with later.  NIGHTBREED is probably more influential than one might first assume (given its history and box-office tally) and this new cut will certainly extended that impression even more to a new generation of digital moviemakers.

Years ago, I had hoped a different version of NB might appear on laserdisc.  That never happened.  But now, at last, the film can be seen as intended, with a very nice video image and great audio.  The fact that fans can opt for a Deluxe Edition (a bit pricey, tho) or a standard-combo edition ensures that anyone with an interest can finally own a copy that befits their budget.

after seeing this directors cut of ""the honorable"" Mr. Clive Barker's original intended version of this film Nightbreed, i will say the following...

1. how dare the studio behave in such a selfish MPAA bowing manner and chopping up this film in 1990, when horror fans like myself were naive concerning censorship and the level of sacrosanct power they hold over hollywood.

2. i am officially finished with the R-rated version of this film and will not watch it again.

3. i am so very impressed with all the pride, devoted work ethic, and pain, both personal and professional everybody went through
to get this excellent film adapted and transfered from book medium to iconically classic horror film.

from ""The Honorable"" Mr. Clive Barker all the down the line and i thank you ET. AL. you have not only giving us horror fans a healthy glimpse into movie making, but also a much deeper appreciation for the so-called hell which must be conquerored in oreder to see ones visions realized!

And while it still is not perfect - I think ""perfect"" for this film would merit at least an X rating - overall it has improved a lot. There is more explanation for those who may not have read the novella, of what is going on and why. We get more backstory for Lori, although its actually wrong - Lori is not a nightclub singer, she is a white-collar office worker, minor quibble - Sheryl's insertion into the movie makes a little more sense and what ends up happening to Ashbury also makes more sense, since both versions of the film skate right over just why he is so markedly at Eigerman's beck and call. [I loved Sheryl in the novella and she was important to the story. But in the first movie she was just sort of shoehorned in.] But best of all, the ending has now changed.

BEWARE SPOILERS FOLLOWING, PLEASE!:

In this version, Decker is DENIED resurrection as Nightbreed, as he should be. The original story states that Boone goes out of his way to explicitly deny him resurrection, then in the original film what does he do but resurrect. *big sigh* Decker dies here, and he stays dead. GOOD. Boone doesn't end up in essence leaving Lori on a hilltop as he does in the original film, she actually goes through death and resurrection as she is supposed to do, and now they will be together forever. One of the final shots in this version is of a painting on Midian's ""lore/history"" wall, showing a rough outline of a couple, standing underneath a starry sky and standing over a decorative arc of skulls. It has been foretold that they would meet, right along with the rest of the 'Breed's history. Excellent! Boone needs Lori, she is essential to what he has to do.

I do wish Barker has told us more about this fascinating set of characters in further works, because ""Cabal"" is probably my favorite work of his. But..... since that didn't happen, this is what we have. The Blu-ray is diamond-clear, really enjoyable to watch. I saw a lot of details I'd never noticed before in many watchings of the original.

6491419,2,B00LMBUR6S,"So disappointed!

First, this is certainly a better film than the theatrical cut. As other reviewers have noted, many of the logic gaps have been filled. For example, where did Baphomet go? In the theatrical cut, the god just sort of vanishes. In the new cut, Lylesburg explains that the god can be moved. This, and many other explanations like it, help the flow of the film tremendously. Well done Mr. Barker, shout factory, and all those fans who worked so hard. Getting this together was a truly herculean task.

So why did I find the film disappointing? Two reasons. First, the additions change the films theme. Second, the new ending reduces the challenges the Nightbreed face, diminishing their status as sympathetic heroes.

First, the theme seems to have changed. For me, the old theme of this movie was that there are certain underrepresented segments of society that need a special place where they can be tolerated and find love. These segments of the population are more sensitive to suffering, having faced it themselves, and are, therefore, worthy of preservation and equality despite their minority status. The new theme seems to be that monsters are just as violent and abusive as regular humans; they just don't get the chance to commit revenge-slaughter as often.

For me, this theme is created by the addition of the song, Johnny Get Angry, a song which tacitly sanctions emotional abuse, and the addition of Boons militia like calls that the Nightbreed defend themselves. Lauries singing of Johnny Get Angry puts Boon in the role of Johnny, who, in the song, is called upon by the singer to put women in their place, an outdated 1950s gender paradigm, and not one based on equality or even what most people today understand as love. Boons calls to arms, do certainly make the Nightbreed more heroic, as Mr. Barker claims they are in the introduction to this cut by, I suppose, making them more active participants in their own fate; however, Boons encouragement that the Breed fight, for me, colored the moments when they revel in the suffering of their human attackers as cruel and mindlessly vindictive rather than regrettable but justified by self-defense.

Second, I miss Deckers resurrection. Why? To me, Barkers best villains, the Cenobites, Nix, and Uriel from Weaveword, are vast, powerful forces of nature driven by primal arche-motivations that mortals can barely understand. This arrangement puts his heroes in the role of true outcasts; they have our sympathy because they face such insurmountable odds, just like people who seem to face such primal, persistent, and seemingly insurmountable human prejudices as racism and sexism. Decker fits this mold much better than Father Ashberry. Decker states, I am death, plain and simple, which puts his villainous status on par with the mightiest Barker villains, a pure anti-life force to counter the similarly primal, yet severely weakened, power of Baphomet. While Ashberrys claim to villainy, he burned me, I want to burn him back, just seems like petty vindictiveness, and is out of keeping with his character, who, up to that point in the film, had been begging the police to show mercy.

Watching this film, I had a terrible thought. I am very sorry, but here it is. I couldn't help but thinking that, this is an out version of Nightbreed. The film seems to have forgotten what it is like to be an outcast, and has drunk the Kool-Aid of Americas post 9-11s pro-war mentality. The theatrical cut said, There are safe places, different places, and those places are protected by their own laws and their own gods. Go there, and your dreams will find refuge. The new cut says, There are no safe places. Everyone is on the same footing lets just fight it out.

6491423,3,B00LMBUR6S,"Let me first say I don't usually favor director's cuts over theatrical cuts. It's neat to see the cut content, but I'm often in agreement with why it was cut. While there are some exceptions, Nightbreed unfortunately isn't one of them. I saw the director's cut of Nightbreed last night at a special screening in Hollywood, coinciding with the Scream Factory release of this long awaited disc. The pacing is slowed way down, corny scenes are shoehorned back into the film, and none of the new content reveals anything of weight or consequence to the story. It was neat seeing more Nightbreed makeup concepts and characters, but the overall film isn't helped by these things. In fact, a couple themes are entirely removed like the fact that Decker feels rejected by the Nightbreed, and the great ending shot where the carpet is essentially pulled out from under the audience, revealing the fact that we're rooting for the monsters / demons. The impact of Baphomet is also reduced in the director's cut by seeing too much of him for too long. The fact that he essentially can do nothing but stand there is made more obvious, where as in the original cut his few lines motivate the climax in a more direct way.

The audience was laughing at a lot of the added content. It wasn't supposed to be funny. The chemistry between  Lori & Boone is minimal, and seeing so much more of this relationship, and ultimately hinging the whole movie on their love detracts from the overall theme of the film. I really appreciated seeing the new director's cut of Nightbreed, and I respect Clive Barker so much, and am so happy for him that he finally got to see his vision of the film come to fruition, but as an audience member, I will stick with what worked best for me -the theatrical cut is better.",1413849600,8,1782,4.60062893081761
6491424,5,B00LMBUR6S,"Here's the thing. If you have an attachment to the theatrical then don't bother with this version. The theatrical cut has a lot of fans which I can appreciate because there's quirks to it that separate it from the standard horror pack. As a kid I loved it, thought it was cool.

As I got older and having read the book I just couldn't get on board with it. There were TOO MANY logic gaps in the story to make it even remotely satisfying. Boone and Lori as characters were just place holders, ciphers who loved each other without any meaningful motivation to get us as the audience invested into their plight. Just a wretched truncated story designed to make a quick buck. Having read the behind scenes drama with the studio demanding cuts now I know why the theatrical version has as many problems as it does.

All the problems I had originally have been effectively rectified in this new cut. Like the book, at its deep heart, it's a love story mingled with a classic hero's journey messiah myth. Is it still cheesy in some spots, hell yeah, but it wears its heart on its sleeve with pride and gusto, I'll take that over cynical cash grabs any day over the week.

Boone and Lori are now at the forefront in this cut which in turn makes the investment into the story more exciting. The stakes have been raised exponentially. There's more personality to the proceedings this time that gives it a much more distinctive identity than it had before. To me for what was once a cult guilty pleasure has now effectively become one of my favorite movies of all time. I wouldn't be surprised if they start releasing this cut during midnight screenings or festivals or even at the Alamo Drafthouse, getting a new lease on life with cinema critics and enthusiasts.

I can go on and on and on about how friggin' cool this movie has become in its current form, but all I can do right now is just pass the word. If you're into Clive Barker, see this cut. See this movie if you love horror. If you love fantasy. If you love allegories about society persecuting the different. If you love well told stories that don't waste your time and emotional investment. Then see this movie. You will not be disappointed.",1413676800,42,2194,4.491228070175438

6491426,2,B00LMBUR6S,"Ok, so I have been a massive fan of this movie since I first caught glimpse of the trailer on a VHS of Dolly dearest back in 1990. As a young teenager I found the theatrical cut to an amazing fantasy film and held it in high regard since. As I grew older and learnt some of the mythology about the production and the complications with the studio, This cut had become a thing of legend...it had been said the story was completely different, the motivations of characters, more Breed, more mythology, less random scenes cobbled together..so i went into this Directors cut imagining that those things that didn't really add up in the theatrical would be rectified in Barkers Very own Directors cut...however this was not the case, this cut offers little more than a few deleted scenes at the beginning of the movie, which frankly made it drag and can understand the studios decision in removing them, they offered little more to the story apart from showing us a bit more of Lori and Boone together, Scenes were still not there that I expected or would have liked to have seen...a few extensions but nothing to have me believe this differed too far from the theatrical, it just slowed it down. The major change to this cut, is the Battle of midian is fleshed out but nothing to write home about and some pretty random stuff as well, Boone's character seems to just run around dishing out pieces of Wood to the Breed as if that will do anything against the raging arsenal of the Shearneck police...I expected a difference with Decker also, but apart from the shot with Narcisse demise, I noticed nothing different, and no insight into his motivation either, and to top it off, I found the alternate ending with both Eigerman (it was good to finally find out where he went, in the theatrical he just disappeared) and the ending on the hill to be a bit...lame. I had high hopes for this and found it to be a massive let down, scenes reported as to being shot are still not here and those that have made the cut just didn't add anything new or exciting to the movie...the holy grail of alternate cuts turned out to be just another extended version which had no real benefit to the actual movie as a whole! No doubt fans of Night breed (which I am I might add) will disagree but I just don't think it lives up to anywhere near the hype it has gathered over the years.",1413331200,14,2360,4.452655889145497
6491427,5,B00LMBUR6S,"I won't go into the same thing about how this set is worth the price, but will focus on what you actually get here.  First of all the discs and booklet are housed in a very sturdy slipcase with the artwork from the Director's Cut on the outside.  The case also has a nice feel to it.  Instead of a shiny surface, which would show fingerprints, it's more of a matte finish.  Inside the slipcase are two blu ray cases; one for the Director's cut and the other for the Theatrical cut.  As is true with most Scream Factory titles, you have the option of choosing what artwork you want to show on the cover of both discs.  That's a feature I've always liked that about Scream Factory titles.  The bonus content on the disc with the Director's cut is about 2 hours of really good quality behind-the-scenes goodness.  That doesn't include the commentary track. The Director's Cut itself is worth the price to me.  This cut is a totally different film that the theatrical cut.  While some extended cuts just throw some extra scenes in, that's not what was done here.  Some scenes have been replaced or extended, and they really make for a more satisfying film experience.  It was so cool to see some new monsters that didn't make it into the original release.  The Bonus disc that comes with this version has a little over an hour of really interesting content. You get to see some deleted scenes, lost footage, stop animation footage, and an extensive stills gallery of artwork.  Inside the second blu ray case is the Theatrical version.  It includes the same quality of picture as the DC, and the only bonus content on this is the original trailer.  Now all of this alone would be worth the price in my opinion, but Scream Factory didn't stop there.  You also get a very nice booklet that has some really cool artwork of the main characters, and a very well written extensive essay about the history of the film.  The bottom line comes down to just how well do you like Nightbreed.  If you are a casual viewer, and just want a good horror flick, the single disc version should suffice for you.  However, if you are a big fan of the film, and have been waiting for a long time for this film to get the special treatment, then there is no question, you MUST get the 3-disc Director's Cut.",1413244800,6,2280,4.448192771084337
6491428,4,B00LMBUR6S,"An extended Directors Cut long coveted by fans, Shout! Factory has made the restored version of Clive Barkers NIGHTBREED a reality at last. The labels meticulous reconstruction of the horror auteurs original version  recklessly cut down and reshot at the insistence of Morgan Creek executives  is cause for celebration for the movies admirers, who have long believed that a better, more consistent cinematic vision existed on the cutting room floor.

Nightbreed is certainly a bit of a flawed movie even in Barkers 120-minute new cut, but at least its an entertaining and occasionally inspired monster mash, mixed with slasher horror and capped by a love story. If nothing else, the picture is certainly unique, and comes much closer to being a satisfying product in the Directors Cut.

Barkers adaptation of his short novel Cabal tells the story of Boone (Craig Sheffer), a troubled young man with visions of a nightmarish monster land named Midian. His psychiatrist, Decker (played by director David Cronenberg), though, is the real monster in the movie  a serial killer who pins his killings on Boone. With nowhere else to go, Boone finds Midian, a sanctuary for shapeshifters, demons and other creatures of the night, but the group initially rejects him because hes a mere human. After Decker pursues Boone, though, our hero is killed and resurrected as part of the Nightbreed, leading him to help the cause of the persecuted monster-outsiders and fight back against humans who believe Boone is responsible for the murders.

Morgan Creek didn't care for Barkers original cut of Nightbreed, which balances horror with a strong love story between Boone and his girlfriend Lori (Anne Bobby), and also focuses heavily on the monster community of Midian. By the time Nightbreed reached theaters in the winter of 1990, the movie had been cut down and reshot, shifting much of the focus away from the monsters and towards Cronenbergs Decker. Apparently thinking Deckers slasher-villain would be more marketable to the Freddy & Jason-loving masses than the gallery of ghouls living in Midian, Morgan Creek changed the shape and very intent of Barkers story.

The final product didn't work and fizzled out at the box-office  yet enough of Barkers intent seeped through, allowing for Nightbreed to generate a cult following. The films admirers have, for years, hoped that Barkers intended cut would see a release  and several years ago, a crudely-packaged Cabal Cut surfaced, restoring all kinds of lost scenes off a VHS workprint dub and mixing them together with the theatrical version. The result was reportedly a bloated and unfocused 160-minute cut that needed some trimming  yet it was long thought that the deleted footage was lost in the Morgan Creek archives. The prospects of a genuine restoration appeared bleak, with murmurs floating about that some restored scenes would have to originate from a VHS source, or might be lacking audio and would necessitate subtitles.

All of those early reports, thankfully, were completely inaccurate in so far as to the newly minted Directors Cut edited by Barker and restoration producer Mark Allan Miller goes. Showing a consistently crisp and healthy image from start to finish, with just a bit of dirt in the added scenes visible once in a while, this new cut of Nightbreed is a triumph for all involved. Theres little disparity between the new scenes and material derived from the theatrical version, which was sourced from an interpositive at Warner Bros., which currently distributes the film as part of an arrangement with Morgan Creek (the film was theatrically released by Fox). The 5.1 DTS MA and 2.0 DTS MA stereo mixes are wonderfully handled, offering an active sound design with a glorious Danny Elfman score (more on that in a moment).

Barker opted not to include every last scrap of material here  a wise idea since at the two-hour mark, the running time for Nightbreed feels just about right. Barker and Miller removed the reshot Morgan Creek scenes and added some 40 minutes of new/alternate material, resulting in a film thats 20 minutes longer than its theatrical cut but contains more many alterations than the time disparity alone suggests. In every way, this is a superior version of the picture  the story has time to breathe in its early going, allowing for Boone and Loris relationship to more satisfyingly develop. The monsters are also given more focus, and thats key to this new version of Nightbreed. Morgan Creek wanted more of a straight-ahead slasher movie  but Barkers story was more of a dark fantasy than a pure horror film, and this new Nightbreed is, naturally, much more aligned with what was intended all along.

Not that the movie isn't without its faults. Barkers limitations as a director are evident throughout the picture, which  despite having been shot on an expansive set at Pinewood Studios  is claustrophobically staged and executed. Theres no real sense of scale or scope in the movie, with Barkers style exhibiting a vanilla, point and shoot type of approach. The make-up effects are striking and some stop motion animation is utilized at one point, but one can only imagine how much more visually powerful the film may have been in the hands of a veteran director.

Thankfully, Danny Elfmans music compensates for the movies weaker aesthetic elements. For every composer theres a particularly fruitful era in their filmographies, and for Elfman, theres little disputing that Nightbreed fell during one of the most creative and successful times of his career. His first score written after Batman and prior to Dick Tracy and Edward Scissorhands, Elfmans Nightbreed is, quite simply, one of the most appealing scores in the composers oeuvre. Sure, its as dark, pulse-pounding and exciting  colored by tribal percussion and chanting choral passages  as youd expect, but its also gorgeous. Otherworldly, melodic and surprisingly romantic, its the most polished technical element in the picture (Barker has said as much), and its orchestrations are striking. At times Elfman sustains scenes with an almost Herrmann-like use of strings, while in others, he characterizes the monsters and their plight with a genuinely poignant sensitivity. It all culminates in a lovely ending  one that was unceremoniously dropped from the original theatrical release  and an End Credits track that was likewise trimmed, leaving off the redemptive final notes of the composers music thats, at last, restored here.

Shouts Blu-Ray/DVD combo pack of the Nightbreed Directors Cut is highlighted by a commentary with Barker and Miller. Its an engaging track occasionally stymied by a lack of focus, but fans ought to enjoy it just the same. Craig Sheffer, Anne Bobby and members of the supporting cast are on-hand  minus Barker  in a 72-minute new documentary on the film thats heavy on the actors anecdotes about the production, and light on the recutting of the picture (save for a few minutes at the very end). Separate featurettes on the 2nd unit directors and make-up artists were also newly produced for this release, and its rounded out with Foxs brief original theatrical trailer, narrated by Charles Aidman and partially underscored with Enemy Mine music.

Nightbreed may still be a flawed film, but its nevertheless an entertaining, offbeat genre-bending experience thats stuffed with imaginative elements and a sumptuous Danny Elfman score. Backed by a more satisfying ending and more emotional content throughout, its well worth a visit this Halloween season.",1412812800,64,7542,5.145543744889616

After 20+ years the myth becomes real.

Clive thought all was lost, we all did. Morgan Creek had ordered extensive reshoots and 45min excised from Clive Barker's epic adaptation of the Novella ""Cabal"" and after years of searching, we'd all given up on the film elements with the cut footage ever being found, or existing at all.

Then a few years ago 2 VHS work prints where discovered, with the missing footage (grainy, washed and dismal but there) and a few brave souls re spliced the footage to match the screenplay, re-dubbed Doug Bradely's dialogue (it's his image and voice actors voice in the theatrical cut) and went on tour screening ""The CABAL cut""

Then, finally, last year Scream Factory announced they would restore the VHS as best they could and give a delux blu-ray. This year, the did one better, they announced that they found 600 boxes of negatives and prints and with Clive Barker's direction reconstructed and fully restored his original vision. Thus, ""Nightbreed: The Directors Cut""

One of the most sought after restorations in history of cinema, and fully unprecedented release, Nightbreed The Directors cut is must own for any horror / fantasy fan.

The story in brief, follows Boone, a troubled young man who's convinced by his doctor that he's been murdering families. after being injured in drug induced state he meets Narcissist, how he convinces to tell him about a place called Midian, a place where the monsters go, where all your sins are forgiven. Boone flees, but he's pursued both by his girlfriend, Lori (easily the most dedicated lover since Juliet) and Dr. Decker (the real killer).

In Midian,  Boone finds more than he imagined, after a run-in with some locals, he's transformed, beyond death, he becomes both the cause of there destruction and possibly their savior.

Nightbreed is unlike anything you've ever scene. There's a unique twist of Barker's combination of Horror and Fantasy, the movie tells a tale of persecution, the monsters are not ""good guys"" but they are not evil either. Echoing the violence of racial and sexual bigotry and hatred, ""the sons of the free"" converge on Midian and havoc breaks loose. In the center is a serial killer who wants them wiped from the planet, and Lori, willing to go to her death and beyond to be with Boone.

It's not for everyone. Nightreed was fairly low-budget, now sports a running time pushing 3hrs (the final cut excised 20 min from the theatrical and replaced with 40 min of new footage bringing it to just over 2hrs, no plans to include or release the longer Cabal Cut are forthcoming) and is a violent and explicit tale. That said, Barker weaves a world unlike any other and this may be the best cinematic expression of his world-building and epic story-telling skills.

The theatrical version has a load of problems even for die hard fans, there are just leaps of logic and time lapses that are jarring, and the character motivations are again jarringly questionable but all of my gripes were erased when I saw this cut. It's a real movie with a beginning middle and end. And surprisingly touching beautiful love story set behind a world of monsters. Craig Sheffer, Ann Bobby, and David Cronenberg better clear their schedules because they will be hounded by film festivals and bloggers lauding their work in this new version. I hope their acting careers get a major uptick from this because They are awesome in this version. Ann Bobby whose Laurie now is a fully fleshed out character with motives anyone can understand. Craig Sheffer as Boone is engaging and intense with a clear character arc(for the freek and geek set you're about to have a new hero). And Cronenberg is even more creepy in this version making psychiatrists the new bogeymen of our age. Now after seeing the footage there was concern that all we would see would be the VHS work print footage. Now they've found the original negative and we will now be able to see it in 4k glory without any visual hiccups. WOW!

6491448,5,B00LMBUR6S,"I concur that $72 seems a pretty steep price for one film.

Keep in mind that even Clive himself was convinced that it was all lost years ago. It was all a labor of love, with the ultimate goal of restoring the film to show audiences and fans Clive Barker's original vision for the movie. It's my understanding that with this 3 disc set you get the theatrical release of the film, the director's cut, and a third disc of extras. I'm pretty sure that the third disc of extras does not come with other DVD/Blu Ray combo pack. They made 3 batches of this limited edition: 1st has 1000 copies, 2nd has 3000 copies, and the 3rd brings the grand total to 10,000 copies.

6491451,5,B00LMBUR6S,"To be clear here my 5 star rating is for the film itself.

I have adored this film ever since I first saw it in it's original theatrical release.  By that time I had already devoured Mr. Barker's Books of Blood, Weaveworld and best of all Cabal, which the film Nightbreed is based on.  I loved the book and the film as well.  But the film didn't follow the book all the way.  It stopped when things were getting even more interesting!  I prayed that one day Clive would return to his film's Midian world and complete it with a sequel or three.

Now this.  I had already preordered the blu-ray Director's Cut when it came out for sale here on Amazon for a reasonable price of $24.99.  But now I find there's a Limited Edition Director's Cut for $74.99??!!  What in the world is going on here?!  What is the difference in the two?  Could this Limited Edition be worth that gigantic price tag?

Named for the book it's based on, The Cabal Cut was a rough piecing together together of dvd footage from the theatrical version with scenes that were cut or extensions of scenes thought lost. They were found in a box of vhses.

This year is going to be amazing for fans of what have now become cult classic horror films with this remastered and reconstructed bluray of the director's cut of Nightbreed as well as the fabled Halloween 6 Producer's Cut releasing as well. These 2 movies' secret cuts have been whispered about and demanded since the early 90s.

As someone who loves the theatrical Nightbreed I can honestly say Cabal Cut was even better, even in its non remastered vhs (and possibly overly long) format. The character of Lori especially gets the best service as she is no longer just a worried girlfriend of the protagonist,  but a fully fleshed out dual protagonist herself. More depth is given to many side characters and creatures that got the bare minimum of development in the original film. The ending is also completely different!

Clive Barker's vision for this film was never fully realised, in fact it's why he got turned off working with Hollywood, until now. Due to enduring fans and hard work, Barker is so eternally grateful and I hope feels ready to extend the Cabal mythos as he originally intended to.

The great thing with this bluray limited edition set it has an extra disc of special features, and the Theatrical cut of Nightbreed on bluray for the first time too. It makes it easier to compare the two versions. Unfortunately it is in limited supply. Hopefully WB will see the demand and extend the rights and work with Fear to see this superb edition gets more release. It also has exclusive artwork approved by Clive Barker himself.

8666584,3,B00LMBUR6S,"Nightbreed is an early nineties horror film by Clive Barker that has developed a decent cult following and has a newly restored director's cut that includes a half hour of previously cut footage and apparently changes the ending. It tells the story of a young man who dreams of a place called Midian where an extremely varied group of monsters hide from humanity that hunts them.

The Good: David Cronenberg. Yes, this is a film written and directed by horror auteur Clive Barker but it is David Cronenberg that steals the show. David plays a soft-spoken serial killer wearing a Coraline mask simply slaughtering all that come before him while setting up our protagonist to take the fall. The creature designs are also, on the whole, very well done. It is a delight to see McDonalds moon mascot Mac Tonight in his big screen debut.

The Bad: David Cronenberg's character really should have had his own movie. The story of the creatures also really needed their own story. Putting both together seems to cheat each story. The feeling one gets is as if halfway through Jaws Richard Dreyfuss character started making mashed potato mountains on the Orca and left the boat to hook up with Terri Garr and some aliens. Another thing that does not quite click unfortunately is our leads. Craig Sheffer and Anne Bobby seem to lack a certain chemistry, More damning they clearly were chosen based on their resemblance to the leads of Dirty Dancing which graced screens three years earlier, Anne Bobby, in particular, seems to be channeling her inner (and outer), Jennifer Grey. Somebody really needed to put that baby in the corner. Lastly, the film's direction and tone seem all over the map, particularly in the third act. You have a sheriff and various yahoos who are seeming out of a cartoon, you have the monsters reenacting a particularly sad version of 1932s Freaks, you have David Cronenberg who clearly is in a better movie somewhere, and you have direction that never makes it clear who is where related to everyone else and how many of whom there even are.

Overall Nightbreed is more entertaining than I made it sound above. It reminds me of all things the recent Monster Trucks in terms of theme and tone. If Monster Trucks had Michael Myers killing entire families in the first half.",1520985600,,2287,4.77020202020202

8666588,1,B00LMBUR6S,"I went and saw this during its first theatrical run. It was a truly frustrating experience; being a fan of the novel and of Clive I really wanted to like it. I didn't. When it came out on video I bought it hoping that a subsequent viewing would improve my opinion of the film. It didn't. So, here we are a few decades later and they have miraculously found several minutes of cut and thought lost footage. At last, we'd all get to see the version Clive had intended before the corporate suits butchered his ""baby"" and so tainted his masterpiece! Nope...
This is one of those occasions where the imposed cuts have been proven to be absolutely necessary. Sorry, Clive",1515974400,,665,4.5041322314049586
