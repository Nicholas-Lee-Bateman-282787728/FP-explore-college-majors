4644573,5,B005BRFN8Q,"I pre-ordered Christmas with a Capital C, however I have seen it twice on GMC-TV  last year.  It is a shame this film did not have theater release as it definitely deserved to make all the major theaters across America plus have over seas distribution.  It is an excellent film with a top cast and it cannot be praised enough.  It mirrors the on going war we have against Christmas in our nation today and is so very well handled.  There is a tendency for reviewers to be spoilers when it comes to films and I do not want to do that.  Suffice it to say that while every cast member does an outstanding job, Nancy Stafford stands out and I believe would have been up for an Academy Award.  Her thoughtful observations are a center piece in this film and I will be urging all of our friends to purchase it on November 1. We even asked for one day delivery so we could begin showings as quickly as possible.  My copy will be used in Bible Studies and I will be encouraging local churches to show it in the theater format it so richly deserves.  Wish we could give more than five stars as this film deserves top honors.",1312588800,73,1115,4.246445497630332

I used to watch it with my family all the time on Netflix, then they removed it from the movies they offer and I was not able to watch it this Christmas season.  I am so happy I found this for sale on Amazon.  It tells the story of the real meaning of Christmas.  This is a heartwarming movie everyone should watch to remind them going into the Christmas season what it is they are celebrating and not to turn the holiday into Santa and toys only.  I love this movie and the message it provides.  Ted McGinley is one of my favorite actors.  I have followed him since he was on Happy Days and The Love Boat.  I love everything he has done.

Mayor Dan Reed has to decide what to do when the citys right to display a traditional manger scene on public property is challenged. Should he fight for the freedom of religion or give in to a personal rival? He is challenged to decide between standing up for what he believes or accepting government regulations. Throughout the movie you cant tell what way Mayor Dan will go. This made me think about what I would do in this situation, and I believe this movie got it just right.

4644648,5,B005BRFN8Q,"Christmas With a Capital C is a movie that we all enjoyed very much this year.  We caught the end of the movie and liked it so well that we ordered it.  It is a story that contains many of the issues we all face in our lives every day.  Old grudges, long harbored, are exposed again amid the tangled thoughts and feelings surrounding the blending (or not) of religion and politics.  Hidden truths come to light as the real meaning of Christmas is shown by the actions of the townspeople.  They have decided that the battleground of rights and wrongs in the political arena will actually never show us the true meaning of Christmas, and they are right.  They begin ""living and doing"" Christmas with unexpected results.  Loss, redemption and forgiveness are all part of the healing of old hurts and rivalries as the doors are opened for new beginnings.  Ted McGinley is one of our favorite actors and gives a great performance as the Mayor.  Brad Stine plays the Mayor's brother and nearly ""stole the show"".  His character was so endearing and funny and kept us laughing.  Nancy Stafford is as beautiful as ever and Daniel Baldwin never disappoints.  We really enjoyed this movie and recommend it to everyone.",1421020800,,1207,4.668246445497631

I like it because it highlights the tension between folks who believe displaying Christmas scenes is somehow very important with those who have an exaggerated sense of imposition when those are displayed at taxpayer's expense.  A good and practical ending.  Through it, a true (IMHO) meaning of Christmas is shown, first by the little girl, and then by the community.

4644683,1,B005BRFN8Q,"Lets start with the touted review:  ""Love triumphs over political correctness."" --Movieguide

So we already have people throwing up human equality as 'political correctness' and saying its the opposite of love (as love is 'triumphing' here.)

This movie is sad fundamentalist crap.

- High school hero is town mayor, has perfect movie family
- Anti-hero is a bad person who: went to college, left town, and got to know the world
- 'Happy holidays' is anti-christmas apparently (Remember, 'Love Triumphs' over including other religions in our merry wishing!)
- Small towns are godly and big towns are scary and godless
- Anyone who isn't a christian is secretly sad and poor
- Single token black person in town
- Elections can happen at any time
- Writers think the 'Chamber of Commerce' is an actual branch of government.

If you are really Christian, reject this madness and the idea that 'politically correct' is anything other than prejudice with another name. Welcome all people, not just yourselves.",1417132800,4,1004,5.024096385542169

4644711,1,B005BRFN8Q,"Awful, simply awful. The atheist who returns to the town after 20 years, seems like an embittered and angry man, out on a personal vendetta against the heroic Christian mayor. The premise is that the mayor is building (and using some city funds) to build a stand outside of the town's city hall, for Christmas. There will be Christian decorations displayed along with more secular Christmas decorations. So this evil atheist type files an injunction to stop work on this stand.

Now, atheists aren't the only people who support keeping government and religion untangled, many Christians (though usually not evangelical types) also favor that. Atheists aren't out on personal vendettas against some Christian mayor or politician when we do so. Also, the ""Merry Christmas"" banner is moved because of this injunction. Frankly, no atheist has ever objected to a ""Merry Christmas"" sign, even in front of a courthouse.

In fact, I don't know if any church/state or atheist group would even object to this stand, unless it solely has Christian symbols. Atheists just want neutrality or at least, an open forum. Have Christian symbols such as a nativity scene, fine, but allow a display of the Flying Spaghetti Monster.

The Christian mayor in one scene recites the free exercise clause of religion, which for some reason makes this evil atheist type, say touch. That seems to imply the atheist knows he is violating the free exercise rights of the residents, but there is of course no free exercise right to have the government put up a display, even if not centered around Christian images solely.

This movie was produced by people who seem to have never met an actual atheist in their lives. Full of fear and strawman. If I could give a negative star, I would.",1392336000,10,1756,4.902356902356902

4644720,4,B005BRFN8Q,"Though this is a Christian film that clearly supports the idea of a ""War on Christmas"" it handles it in a way that I consider fair. The Christian characters are genuinely good people who don't mean to force their religion upon others. They simply don't realize they're doing it until the atheist bad guy complains. Also, the film doesn't try to whitewash the Establishment Clause, it's treated for what it is; the law. I liked how the mother of the Christian family explains, to the other Christians, that Christianity is something to be lived, not just believed. In my experience, most Christians do lip service to their religion without actually living it. I also liked how the story wasn't presented as the entire town against the atheist. My biggest complaint about the film is with the cookie cutter bad guy atheist. He's angry and lonely. Atheists are no more angry or lonely than anyone else. The Christian family in the film could just as easily have been an atheist family. All in all I think the film gets across the right message, that it's not necessary to shy away from your religion, just don't force it upon others. It's possible to be a Christian, Jew, Muslim, Sikh, Jain, Hindu, Buddhist, or whatever and live your beliefs while still allowing others to live their beliefs, or lack thereof.",1386547200,,1307,4.762114537444934

4644777,5,B005BRFN8Q,"The question put forth in this movie is about how to be obedient to the total of Christian teaching and keep Christ as the center focus of Christmas.  Christians believe in respecting the law and showing love and charity toward all, including those with whom there is disagreement.

The town of 4,000 in Alaska has a man returning to live there, the town where he grew up. There is the tradition of the town's nativity display which has been put up every Christmas for 50 years, but now there arises conflict over the legality of the display on city property. Soon signs are being changed from ""Merry Christmas"" to ""Happy Holidays"" and ""Seasons Greetings.""

Leaders in the town, including the pastor, come together to discuss how to work this out and still remain faithful to their faith.  They also meet with a judge over the dispute.  In this time of so much conflict between Christians and those who don't respect Christian rights to free speech, this movie shows how remaining faithful can be accomplished without sharp words by putting the needs of others on all sides first.",1356220800,,1080,4.754010695187166
4644778,1,B005BRFN8Q,"As an agnostic who celebrates Christmas (in a secular sense), I was not at all surprised that this movie created an atheist caricature who went to Berkley then moved to San Francisco, leaving the ""real America"" of his Alaskan small town, only to end up penniless and bitter.  Listen--we agnostics and atheists don't care how many nativities people put on their own private lawns or on church property--we just don't want it on government property, and we're not all miserable loners with no family.  I was actually surprised at how the villain was a rich guy, considering the recent ""job creator"" language all over the Republican party in the last election.  Also interesting how the other members of the town who supported Daniel Baldwin's character were not considered.  It seems for the mayor and his brother's thin skin and easy offense over someone wishing them a happy holiday, they have no problem making anyone who celebrates a different religion in the town feel uncomfortable--even to the point of the mayor's brother ranting at a coffee shop owner who wished him a happy holiday while she smiles on like a Stepford wife.  (Yes he apologizes--but it's still clear we're supposed to be cheering his rant.)  At a town council meeting, they even go so far as to insult Kwanza ""whatever that is"", along with implying that displaying a menorah publicly would be a bad thing.

Naturally, people who agree with this movie will love it.  But it does nothing to convince anyone who is not an evangelical christian why saying ""happy holidays"" is apparently so offensive.",1355529600,12,1570,4.89811320754717

Eph. 6:12 says ""For our struggle is not against flesh and blood,...but against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places."" Reacting to Mitch Bright's evil invasion of their
comfortable traditions the townspeople get nowhere, while in the flesh. However, when they allow themselves to be humbled and seek God's grace and guidance, things turn around. In their strength nothing but frustration is accomplished. In God's strength, peace and restoration come shining through, all to God's glory. The message is elemental to the Christian walk.

4644794,1,B005BRFN8Q,"The plot of this film centers around two former high school rivals who once again live in the same town, when Mitch Bright, portrayed by Daniel Baldwin, returns after having ""seen the world"" by leaving Alaska and going to Berkeley and living in San Francisco.  He awes the locals by displaying his wealth, although, it turns out to be just for show as he lost his money in some bad investments.  The local boy, Mayor Dan Reed, is quite fond of the fifty year-old town's traditional Christmas Nativity display, something to which the Christphobic Mitch Bright takes offense.  So Bright soon files a complaint and all the Church versus State issues come into play.  The movie acts like it is promoting putting Christ into Christmas by taking the viewpoint that it is all about Christians doing for others, which is partially true, but its emphasis on overlooking political activism is actually a red herring.  As while yes Christians should do for others, they don't need to let themselves be shoved into the background by letting people like Mitch Bright always be victorious.  Which is why this film gets no more than a one star rating from me.  I admit the two male leads do a fantastic job of conveying their animosity onscreen, so some of the acting is quite impressive.  The teenage love story seemed superfluous to the plot.  And the film could have had a lovely ending if they had showed the Nativity display back in the city square, but instead they leave it alongside a remote highway, even though, in the end Bright comes around and withdraws his complaint.",1327622400,8,1566,4.749077490774908

4644817,5,B005BRFN8Q,"This is a good ""family"" movie with a message.  And although it is certainly brought up in the movie, the message isn't that you should say Merry Christmas instead of just Happy Holidays.  In fact, several of the key characters point out that, while the holiday is certainly about Jesus and originated as a celebration of His birth, concentrating too much on which phrase people use can take your mind off other issues that His followers should be interested in.  The Christians in this small town square off against a ""villain"" who has returned to his home town after many years and begins causing trouble.  It takes a little ""angel"" to show them how to give their faith feet.  It won't win an Oscar, but it's well worth watching.  The guy who plays the mayor's brother is a real hoot and the movie is worth watching just to see him.",1323734400,3,833,4.52

4644819,4,B005BRFN8Q,"I liked this show and it will remain in my ""30 days of Christmas"" line up for the following years. It did not get the 5 stars, only due to the fact the ending felt rushed and it was not played out as much as this great storyline could have been. Saying that, it gives the viewer an excellent concept of what really is Christmas about, and if the ""powers that be"" do remove signs, titles, nativities, etc... from ""Christmas"" does this really ruin it? The movie suggests these are just traditions, but no one can take the real meaning which is the gift of love that was given to us, at His birth and sharing it thru giving of ourselves and caring for ""people"" more than caring for the ""traditions"" that we once held dear. It is the true concept of Christmas, not played out by lights, statues and ""things"" but in fact loving the un-lovely the ""one sheep"" that has gone astray and reaching out in whatever way you can to show love and ....well, ""Christmas"" to them.",1323561600,8,962,4.35

Yes, in the first half hour or so the acting is a little shaky, but it evens out. I love hearing Jesus' name spoken reverently on screen, and this one did a good job of that also. The ending maybe was a little far-fetched (where did the neighbors get all their pies and gifts if they were just sitting at a Christmas program ten minutes ago?) but aren't most Christmas movies more about the 'feel good' aspect than reality?

4644832,5,B005BRFN8Q,"KNOW it is a Christian DVD. PURE/FLIX is a Christian distributor. Christians making a faith-based film. Excellent actors in a good Christian tale written by Andrea Gyertson Nasfell. A story with a moral meaning, but don't confuse that with the politics also included.

There's teenage romance, a Mayor's race, a ski race, and Mitch (Daniel Baldwin, yes Alec's bro) returns after 20 years to oppose the long-time Mayor's (Ted McGinley) reelection as well as City Hall's use of a ""Merry Christmas"" banner and an antique local Alaskan's nativity carving. More than the ""Merry Christmas"" vs ""Happy Holiday"" issue is a greater theme of ""goodwill to all men"" & ""peace on Earth.""

Two magnificent aspects shine like tree-topping angels.
First is the filming location of Seward, Alaska; converted to Trapper Falls, small town of 4000 and home of moose burgers. Scenery is breathtaking. Local Alaskan's know that.
Second is an absolute show-stopper performance in a scene when the Mayor's brother, Greg (Brad Stine-Christian comedian) explains the Christ birth story to 3 youth. He rolls, an animated Christian Christmas fanatic, ranting like Robin Williams, and stealing the best segment of the entire film. It was intentional, as much of the segment was taken from his stand-up comedy routine, written into the film by the writer.

The film ends with the spectacular scene of the life-size hand carved town's crche (now privately owned and displayed) set up with Alaskan mountains as a backdrop. Credits roll including ""It's Called Christmas with a Capital C"" music by Go Fish, a song the movie was based upon.
The 81 min. film does have SUBTITLES and a Dove Approval.
Bonus stuff: Commentary option; Behind the Scenes-24 min; Highway 101 Bio-8 min; Highway 101 Music video; 6 Trailers.

Highly recommended Christian Family Film viewing. A keeper to watch every year. Although the constitutional question of City Hall Christmas political correctness is included; look instead to the greater story of reaching out to others at Christmas, even to a life-long rival. That theme works for all, regardless of your name for the Holiday. The happy ending is universal, something like Dickens's Christmas Carol. Merry Christmas.",1320364800,37,2213,5.207865168539326

I am related to the writer and know some of the cast and crew so must admit to some potential bias.  Frequently the ""Christmas Wars"" between the sacred and the secular can spoil and blur the simple message of peace on earth and good will toward mankind. In this presentation the writer and the actors do not present mere platitudes and predictable answers. Nancy Stafford is the voice of reason and grace - I found her straight forward wisdom about what really makes Christmas ""Christmas"" compelling as well as inspiring.
