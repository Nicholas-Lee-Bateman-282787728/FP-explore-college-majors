8248623,2,B00130070E,"The box claims to have ""over 1 hour"" of footage(as if that is impressive), but the actual DVD contains even less(just under 50 mins of content). Also the back of the box advertises matches(and footage) that are not contained in the DVD. Here is a complete listing of the content of the DVD I received:

1) Nikolai Volkoff Promo Interview
2) Iron Sheik Promo Interview
3) Ace Darling vs. Mr. Motion
4) Iron Mike Sharpe vs. The Cheetah Kid
5) Misty Blue vs. Linda Dallas
6) Iron Sheik vs. Nikolai Volkoff

This DVD is from an indy promotion known as 'Maccabiah Mania' and takes place in the late 90's. The matches take place under a tent set up next to someone's home with about 50 people in the audience. Picture quality is bad and resembles home video footage from the 80's(audio is just as poor). The Darling/Motion match features some decent high flying action.

All the old-timers of course are a shell of their former selves with The Iron Sheik looking the worse. Sharpe and Dallas are still the same with their constant yelling and groaning during the match(and always trying to draw the ire of the crowd).

And lastly there's a preview section that features a kid's show(on a wrestling DVD?). Overall this is a very low quality wrestling DVD with limited content and false match listings. Get it only if you are nostalgic about your old-time favorites and can find the DVD for under two bucks.",1354579200,,1399,4.629032258064516
8248624,1,B00130070E,"This is the first of a few really horrible indy shows on. I don't know who ""The mighty Mackabee"" is but he sounds like a guy who either spent a bunch of bucks or had some organization spend a bunch of bucks to put himself over ome really over the hill WWE guys. The only thing about either of the DVDs I got was that some of these guys have really fallen on hard times to put on this crap DVD.",1334880000,,393,3.8641975308641974
8248625,1,B00130070E,"The version I have differs from the one pictured. On the side of the case it still says Grand Masters Of Wrestling, Vol. 1, and it's still a slim case. This one I got at Walmart for 1 dollar.

The version I have features 3 matches. Ace Darling vs. Devon Storm, King Kong Bundy vs. Iron Mike Sharpe, and Jimmy Superfly Snuka vs. The Metal Maniac.

Darling vs. Storm is easily the best match on either volume. It's a pretty decent match. Some nice spots. Overall, for 1 dollar, a much better match than I was expecting. Still, it's not great. But definitely watchable and a bit entertaining.

King Kong Bundy vs. Iron Mike Sharpe was pretty bad. I'd call it a dud.

Metal Maniac vs. Jimmy Snuka was in between the two. Not quite a complete dud, but not decent either. Pretty bad match. Metal Maniac sucks, and Snuka was coming out of retirement to compete in this match.

Then there were some backstage interviews which were pretty fun. Overall, a bad DVD. Darling vs. Storm made it worth the 1 dollar I paid, but for 18 dollars? A complete ripoff. Stay away, unless you're getting it at Walmart or somewhere else that has it for a dollar. Even then, keep in mind that you get what you pay for.",1228694400,,1192,4.375565610859729
