8750996,4,B01BPHGIAW,"This Bluray disc contains the 54-minute documentary that filmmaker Susan Shaw created to help promote Wynton Marsalis 1996 album Blood on The Fields.  It is divided in virtually two parts. The firs was filmed was digitally filmed in New York City, where Marsalis is the Director of Jazz at Lincoln Center.  This portion is all filmed in grayscale (not as sharply divided as black and white. At the 25-minute mark, the filming moves to Marsalis home town of New Orleans and from there to the end, it is in color.

Much of the commentary by Marsalis was recorded in the back seat of a limousine. There are comments about his methods of writing and direction his group  The Jazz Orchestra of Lincoln Center  by members of the band but, oddly, only a few are identified, and most arent.  Marsalis  at that point in his career  was a controversial person among jazz fans. Many thought he was staying too much with tradition, while others liked the fact that he made jazz more accessible. Youll hear his thoughts on performance here as well as hear sample from the album (but virtually no complete selections). And youll Saw uses images from both the elevated subway in New York City and the French Quarter of New Orleans, to accompany the music.

At times Marsalis gets a bit too technical about jazz performance for the uninitiated. Though the album was released by Sony in 1996, this making of film has not been on home video until now. It is on the Austrian home video label, ArtHaus, distributed by Naxos. It is Region Free in both BD and DVD.

As with other ArtHaus BD and DVDS, there is a booklet (12 pages this time) with a two-page essay in English, French and German., There are also subtitles in all three languages.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
