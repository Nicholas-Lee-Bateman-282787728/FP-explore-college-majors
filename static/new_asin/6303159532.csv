This tape is a mediocre offering of 60 minutes which shows his matches with sub-standard wrestlers like IRS, Fatu and Bam Bam Bigelow. The only saving grace is his steel cage match with Shawn Michaels.
Notably missing are classics such as Bret-Owen at Wrestlemania 1994, Bret vs Razor Ramon at King of the Ring 1993, Bret vs Jerry the King Lawler at Summerslam 1993, Bret vs British Bulldog at Summerslam 1992, Bret vs Piper at Wrestlemania 1992,vs Ric Flair at Saskatoon 1992,  Bret vs Mr. Perfect at Summerslam 1991......the list goes on and on!
Why they chose Fatu, IRS and Bam Bam over these classics is beyond me.....I just can't understand it!!!!
What a waste!!!",1056153600,,893,4.7243589743589745
