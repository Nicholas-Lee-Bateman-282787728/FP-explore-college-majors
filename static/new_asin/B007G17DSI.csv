8561441,5,B007G17DSI,Jancs is one of the famous Hungarian movie editors. I love both his social messages (under the Russian occupation era and the Kadar-regime) and his style. If I have to give an impression of how Hungarians and Eastern Europeans felt under those occupation and regimes I would certanly suggest Jancs's movies.,1440028800,,307,5.03921568627451
