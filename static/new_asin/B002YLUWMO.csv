8519059,5,B002YLUWMO,"I bought this to use in a government class, and I thought it was well done for that purpose.  It does a good job introducing students to third parties (Green, Libertarian, and Constitutional), so is a good companion piece when studying the platforms of the Democratic and Republican parties.  My students enjoyed it.  Good for a two-day lesson with a discussion afterward since it is about 60 minutes.",1354752000,,401,4.867647058823529
8519060,5,B002YLUWMO,"""Crashing the Parties 2004"" is a wonderful documentary, originally aired on PBS, that shows how difficult it is for minor parties and independent candidates to receive media attention and recognition from voters and to compete for political dollars in the U.S.  Viewers also learn about the wide breadth of views represented by third parties and the limited choices offered by the two-party system.  The film is engaging, entertaining, funny, and informative and it makes a wonderful instruction tool for anyone teaching courses on American politics, presidential elections, political parties, campaign finance, or general education American government classes.

""Crashing the Parties"" follows several third party campaigns, including the presidential candidates for the Green Party, the Constitution Party, and the Libertarian Party, as well as Ralph Nader's independent candidacy, during the 2004 presidential election.  It explores in depth questions surrounding Nader's impact on the 2000 presidential election (e.g., was he a spoiler, or was he pursuing his democratic rights and giving voters more choices?) and Nader's subsequent loss of support in 2004; the contentious nomination of the Libertarian Party presidential candidate at the party's convention; and the day to day campaign of the Green Party candidate.  Through these accounts, it shows a variety of barriers facing minor parties today.

The film also portrays the enthusiasm that third party supporters feel for their candidates, their parties, and, most of all, their political platforms.  Many students struggle to understand that there are acceptable political ideals that fall outside of those presented by the Democratic and Republican parties.  ""Crashing the Parties"" displays the range of issues and positions third parties represent and the reason so many people are drawn to support third party candidates.

Perhaps the most beneficial element of the documentary, though, is its ability to communicate the ""catch-22"" that third party voters feel about their decision to support a non-major party candidate.  Voters often feel that if they vote for a third party, they are ""wasting"" their vote or will end up with their least preferred candidate as a result of pulling votes from the ""lesser of two evils.""  This conundrum was a common theme in the days and months following the 2000 election and was used to discourage voters from supporting Nader in 2004, but it also is a consistent concern for anyone thinking about supporting a third party candidate.

""Crashing the Parties"" does a wonderful job of capturing all of these elements and portraying honestly the daily lives and struggles of third party candidates and organizations.  As such, while the film focuses on the 2004 election, the content and educational elements are timeless.  The themes the film touches on and the barriers to minor party success are as equally applicable today as they were when the film was made (and are unlikely to change any time soon).  If it were not for a brief appearance by Democratic nominee John Kerry and President George W. Bush at the beginning of the film, I doubt anyone would easily recognize that it was filmed in 2004.  While I hope the directors are able to make another one of these films in 2012, this film will surely be useful in classrooms for years to come.

Finding films about minor parties in the United States is almost impossible.  The only other films I could find were either, very old and focused on the socialist and communist movements or primary, uncut source material such as footage from the 2004 third party debate held at Cornell (which is available in poor quality on line).  No other films I could find did such a good job presenting a comprehensive overview of the status of minor parties in the United States today in such a professional and thorough manner and in the relatively short amount of time (just over one hour) that is necessary in order to cover the material in a single class.",1262822400,,3996,5.1770186335403725
