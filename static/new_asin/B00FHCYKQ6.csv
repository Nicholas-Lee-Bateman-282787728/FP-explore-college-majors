5992970,4,B00FHCYKQ6,"Years ago I read an article by Yogi Berra where he said children benefit more from playing unorganized stickball in the streets or at a sandlot, as opposed to in Little League or other adult-organized youth baseball.  Berra reasoned that kids can learn to work as teams better and learn to settle disagreements (""He was safe.""  ""No, he was out."")  without having grown-ups telling them what to do.

I thought of Berra's remarks as I viewed the fine 2012 documentary DOIN' IT IN THE PARK: PICK-UP BASKETBALL, NEW YORK CITY.  As opposed to baseball for youngsters, this film covers basketball played by adults but the rewards of unorganized sport seem to apply.  The community that is built by these men (and some women) who gravitate to the public basketball courts throughout the New York City's five boroughs proves that games are not just for children and while no one plays to lose, the bonds made on the court continue after the match ends.  With the cost of the blacktop and hoops covered by the city, participation is accessible to anyone who wishes to show up and try his or her best.  As the film depicts, that community includes the many who simply wish to watch the pick-up games.  I envy the participants and the crowds they attract, as I've known few from any neighborhood in which I've lived in my adult life; I couldn't tell you the names of some who lived on the same street.

In fact, I dare you to spot anyone text messaging or checking a Tablet in  DOIN' IT IN THE PARK.  Internet connection cannot stand up to human connection.",1403136000,2,1546,4.602189781021898
