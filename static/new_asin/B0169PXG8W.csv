7464471,5,B0169PXG8W,"Loved it , it had similar to universe to the previous animated movie which had night wing , batman and Damian as robin . This one now included batwing and cat woman which made it more even more exciting and they were a great addition to an already great family . It was a excellent movie and really enjoyed the movie . Also Alfred and the fight scenes were also good .",1453248000,3,368,4.125
7464472,3,B0169PXG8W,"Really great action, but most of the movie does not have Batman in it.  Also introduces the LGBT agenda into the DC Universe w/ the introduction of the 2nd Batwoman as seen in the 52 #7, guess saying that LGBT should have super hero inspiration as well.  Other than that it's always nice to see Grayson and Robin (Damien).",1453161600,,322,4.440677966101695

7464474,5,B0169PXG8W,"Excellent.  You have to give DC credit for their work on their animated titles.  While their feature films may not be up to the Marvel level, their animated features are FAR superior. This story incorporates so many of the characters from the Batman family (at least their new incarnations) and  brings out some of the psychology of what ties them together.  I am also glad that the villains are not the major attention of the story.  While they are the antagonists that make the story go, this is about Batman, Nightwing, Robin, Batwoman, and now Bat Wing. Of course, this is only 70 minutes, so do not expect the character development of War and Peace.  But if you know the Bat folk, you will love this animated feature.  Thank you, DC!",1453161600,6,738,4.587786259541985

7464496,4,B0169PXG8W,"After a bunch of just OK DCAU films and one triumphant return for Bruce Timm with the previous release, the New 52 Batman saga continues with Batman: Bad Blood.

I was not the biggest fan of Batman vs. Robin but, this third and most likely final installment was much better than I anticipated. The film is action packed with a great story behind it. However, the driving force of the film is the chemistry between the characters and the true meaning of family. With Batman mysteriously gone it is up to the rest of the Gotham Knights to put their differences aside wheather working with Batman or not and attempt a rescue for The Dark Knight. This film gives us some true nods to the more recent Batman lore by including The Batwoman and one of the newest creations in the Batman Universe, Bat-Knight. The animation is much improved upon since the last film with this animation style and there is a great blend of action, drama and comedy. Not to mention a fantastic climatic battle sequence an unexpected main antagonist revealed and a true parting nod to all that is Batman when the film comes to a close.

Will this story line continue on its own, I can't say for sure but, this is not the final time that we will great these characters once more in the near future.",1486598400,,1269,4.489177489177489

7464525,4,B0169PXG8W,"As the third chapter of the ""Damian Trilogy"", Batman: Bad Blood follows the events of Son Of Batman and Batman Vs. Robin, but is intended to be blended adaptation of the Batman: R.I.P., Battle For The Cowl, and Leviathan story arcs from the comics. This also takes place in the New 52 storyline as most of the postFlashpoint movies done by DC Universe.

 Batwoman drops in on a group of C-list supervillains tormenting mob accountant Chuckie Sol(a character from Batman: Mask Of The Phantasm), and Batman drops in to lecture her on using guns. The villains leader shows up, who is a large man called The Heretic wearing a Batman-type mask. An explosion goes off, where Batwoman escapes thinking that Batman was killed. Hearing of Batman's disappearance, Damian Wayne returns to Gotham as Robin, and Dick Grayson assumes the mantle of Batman to make it look like the Dark Knight is still alive. The three heroes confab, but Heretic breaks into the Batcave and kidnaps Robin. Damian awakens in the Heretic's lair where he finds the villains and Batman unmasked as Bruce Wayne being mind-tortured by Mad Hatter. Heretic reveals himself to be aged clone of Damian, and he captured him to transfer Damian's memories into him, but is killed by Talia al Ghul, who is the true mastermind behind this whole scheme. Grayson and Batwoman head to the nunnery where Robin is being held, along with Batwing, the son of Wayne Enterprises head of staff Lucius Fox, who uses a new armored flying batsuit to join the team. They defeat all of the ""warrior nuns"", along with some of the other supervillains, while Talia escapes. Sometime later, Bruce seems to show now ill effects from his torture, and is busy setting up a new Wayne Tech communication device to several world leaders in a summit in Gotham. Batwoman however is nearly killed by her father who is under hypnotic control, and informs Robin and Nightwing to deduce that this was all arranged by Talia. The head of the League of Shadows uses a still mind-controlled Bruce Wayne to use the new Wayne device to hypnotize all the foreign delegates. The Bat-Family unite to stop the Wayne HQ which is now airborne, while Alfred manages to get loose and put the screws on Mad Hatter and Calculator. Nightwing is nearly killed by a hypnotized Batmank, but Robin, Batwoman, and Batwing help break Talia's hold on him, while Damian's mother escapes, only to be possibly killed by Onyx, a companion of Heretic. The Bat-Family later teams up to chase Penguin, who in this story is more of a colorful bank robber instead of syndicate head, while a younger Batgirl swings off to join in the fight.

Bad Blood certainly cleared off most of the Batman rogues gallery, conveniently killing off any of the villains who learned Bruce Wayne's secret identity, so its hard to say where they'll take the Batman titles that are tied to the New 52 from here, although there are plans to do a solo-animated movie of Harley Quinn. The animation has just as good quality as the previous production, but not exactly up to specs as the Justice League movies. This film acts as a lead-in to Justice League Vs. Teen Titans, at least with Robin's development as a hero and acting as part of a team. I'd personally say that Batman Vs. Robin was the better of this ""trilogy"", but Bad Blood manages to keep its head above water long enough to be an acceptable Batman movie.",1469923200,,3383,4.720812182741117

7464527,1,B0169PXG8W,"My son and I watched both this Bad Blood and the also recent Justice Leauge vs Teen Titans as we are both DC fanatics.  Bad Blood was almost unwatchable.  It is interesting that both of these movies feature Damian prominently.

What has always drawn me towards the Batman was his general desire for solitude.  It has also been widely acknowledged with varying levels of mockery that the character best known for stating, ""I work alone,"" has more side characters than any other hero ever created.  If we are actually trying to create a story that caters to Batman and his ilk, adding another bat tag-along is a horrible idea!

There are some decent moments in the movie, but they are greatly overshadowed by the bulk of mindless garbage.  Do we really need a Falcon rip-off from the Marvel Cinematic Universe?  Since when is Talia wholly evil?  The final 20 minutes is a series of mindless, unrealistic action sequences.  If you are on the fence about which to purchase between Batman:Bad Blood and Justice League vs Teen Titans, definitely go with JL vs TT.",1469404800,,1057,4.726775956284153

7464531,2,B0169PXG8W,"I'm a bit of a Batman purest, so I'm glad I rented this rather than purchase it.  I own a lot of the other animated features, but this one was unfortunately only worth the 1 viewing. The predictable story is alright, but it's far from great.  And it's definitely not for preteen kids. At least, I wouldn't let my child watch it.  Bat woman has been revamped obviously for more PC diversity. I actually prefer the old Batwoman story, but DC feels the need to reinvent its characters to appeal to a new audience of non traditional Millennials. I would've rather seen Batgirl in the story instead, but she only makes a brief 5 second appearance. Again, I would definitely recommend renting this before buying it.",1468281600,,709,4.611111111111111
7464532,3,B0169PXG8W,"The Movie is pretty decent, lots of main characters, however for a bunch of proteges of the dark knight all act a little stupid.  Kind of makes me worried about the DC Universe when the Dark Knight finally kicks the bucket.  Some interesting special features on the BluRay, and the movie does look amazing.  It does have a lot of D-List villains, and a little bit of a wonky plot, but the movie does see a lot of torches being passed.  The voice acting is great however with a lot of interesting choices, and the excited to see where the voice acting for Damian Wayne goes in the next few years.

Language includes repeatedly  ""He- and Da..,(repeatedly)  vulgar words such as *itch- (twice) A-hole, are also used"". This language has no place with these characters. Very disappointed that the writers feel the need to include this garbage. Batwoman is a lesbian and picks up on Detective Montoya (In all the comics I've read with Batman, never have seen any hint that Detective Montoya was a lesbian) and they meet at a bar (presumed to be a Lesbian Bar). The violence includes head-shots, and throats being cut,  We loved other DC animated videos but this one's not family-friendly and not what we would show our kids. So glad we previewed it first.

7464588,2,B0169PXG8W,"This is the latest New 52 take on the Batman universe. It's everything you would expect - Batman is intense, he's the best at everything, and all of the sidekicks are well fleshed out. There is a thundering threat to be dealt with and the team rallies to meet the challenge.

There is a lot here that left me dissatisfied. The Batwing character is way too derivative of Marvel's Iron Man. I am sure that Lucious Fox could come up with that kind of a flying armored suit, but it was just in the way of taking the story seriously. When DC has to ape Marvel, that's not a good sign. I think other plot lines or characters would be much better and more effective than one more Iron Man clone flying around and shooting clusters of microrockets. There are way more interesting ideas and characters out there, both in the known DC universe and yet to be created in imagination - which has no limits! If you are going to add someone to the already crowded Team Bat, I just think Batwing was a very weak choice.

Defining Batwoman as a really strong kickass character with a terrific backstory is very effective. I think the tension created by her wanting to be her own person as opposed to another Batman appendage is really good, and her skill set and connections with the secret world through her father really add a lot to the mix. But I am at a loss why her Lesbian orientation is of any relevance to the story. Nitewing also is given a little zippy reference to his heterosexual liaison at one point as well. I do not like this material in a cartoon that is sure to be watched by kids. Can't we just keep the superhero series simple and not drag all of this baggage into the story? I challenge the writers to justify the inclusion of these sequences referencing character sexuality that with either advancing the story or making the characters more admirable or respectable.

One positive thing I want to point to that was very well done was the fight sequences. There was a lot of hard work put into the fight scene that was really outstanding. It's too bad the distractions caused by raunchy material took away from an otherwise fair to good Batman story.",1461974400,,2155,4.464467005076142

The only thing is missing from this movie is a BATDOG because everyone else in the movie is already some sort of Batsomething.

7464720,5,B0169PXG8W,"First, I know this is a long(ish) review, but please bear with me. I am not a DC fanboy, but I AM a big Batman fan(atic). This is the best animated Batman release since Under the Red Hood and The Dark Knight Returns (the latter being the best of the best). IMO, Son of Batman was a 3.5 and Batman vs. Robin a 2. The Animated Series has some sentimental value for me in its legacy continued in Conroy, Hamill and Harley (and some of its depictions of Dent, Clayface and Captain Clown), but I don't think it has withstood the test of time and is mostly crap (including Mask of the Phantasm). I am also a BIG fan of Williams and Blackmans Kate Kane.

Now that you have an idea behind the history of my taste levels, let me say Bad Blood is awesome. The pacing is constant, the characters are portrayed relatively realistically and the action is FANTASTIC. Its obvious that the screenplay writers know that Bat-Fam fans are sick to death of expositional content for characters we are well acquainted with, and we are given just enough to feel like we know Batwoman and Batwing.

Lastly, let me address a few common criticisms I have read in the amazon reviews of this movie. Batwomans origin is quite light-handed, and any complaints about her part in this movie are either from the impatient and/or homophobic. Anyone complaining about the pacing being too quick has probably read the comics and either lacks perspective in being able to see this movie as a standalone work, or they just wanted the whole Batman Inc. arc to be given more attention. Every cinematic release based on written work is streamlined in some way; get over it, this movie did it exceptionally well. While its true that Batman isn't in this movie much, it is my opinion that if you only see the Bat-Fam members as sidekicks as opposed to independent heroes in their own right, you don't REALLY get Batman at all.

Love is thicker than blood.

There was great interplay between the characters. I like that the movie stayed true to the characters and yet gave a different perspective on Batman's ""Father-mentor"" role. Damian is always on point with the one liners. DC continues to up the adult quotient by pushing the boundaries of language and violence - HOWEVER, Batman (and Wonder Woman honestly) live and thrive in a world of violence - complete with bone breaking, heinous crimes and sometimes death that cannot be prevented - to keep things interesting and realistic.

The really big negatives, and God knows that I like the DC Cartoons better than the Marvel ones, Batwoman and Damian Wayne as Robin. To me Batwoman is and always has been a 4th rate character and will never be anything more. And now the big drawback....Damian, I don't get why DC keeps shoving this character down our throats, he isn't interesting in any way, just petulant. They killed him off a while ago and I was grateful and they bring him back. Well, even with the comics is stopped getting many ""Bat"" titles they have been messing up the characters for a while now.

7464804,5,B0169PXG8W,"My favorite animated DC film since flashpoint! I'm a fan but not a hardcore comic fan, which to me I think works to my benefit so I can have no expectations when watching these animated movies. As a fan who had no background knowledge of batwing and bat woman, I thought it was well done how they incorporated them into the team. The action was amazing to watch and the pacing of the movie was great, no dull moments. Night wing shined in this, stakes felt higher with batman gone and in the final act/fight, the team-up scenes at the end got me giddy like a comic fan wants to feel watching these movies. Judging from it alone and not comparing it to comics is the best approach, nothing ever will match and you'll just set yourself up for disappointment if you always expect a literal translation from comics to the screen! This applies to all comics/books to movies/tv.",1455494400,2,872,4.490566037735849
7464805,1,B0169PXG8W,"As a DC fan of over 50 years (and Batman in particular), I proclaim this my obituary of DC animation.  It lived in Batman:  The Animated Series and Superman: The Animated Series, became ill with Batman Beyond/Justice League, with the disease worsening with each successive series, reaching terminal status on TV with Teen Titans/Teen Titans Go!.  The virus spread to the video releases, each becoming more diseased than the previous release, until the entire library is now infected, with no chance of survival.  DO NOT waste your money on this, unless you want the Nightwing collectible figure.

Mike Carlin and Dan DiDio are cancers that should be removed from all DC properties.  If there is a God, and my prayer is answered, and I ever find myself in ownership of DC, the resulting bloodbath in the executive offices will make the St. Valentine's Day Massacre look like a pillow fight...",1455494400,4,891,4.906666666666666

7464807,5,B0169PXG8W,"Just finished: along with Jeff H., watching ""Batman - Bad Blood"" released by Warner Brothers.
Batwoman is a problem that Batman has been putting off making a decision about for about two years now since her first appearance as crime fighter in Gotham City.  Batman doesn't approve of her style - especially since she uses a gun with real, instead of rubber bullets, to take out criminals.
Still, the issue becomes a mote one when Batman disappears after saving Batwoman's life during a deadly encounter with Tusk, Killer Moth, and Firefly.
Summoned back to Gotham City by Alfred, Dick Grayson learns that Bruce Wayne has disappeared.  ""It's not the first time,"" a less than thrilled Dick points out.  Alfred agrees but tells Dick that Gotham City is in turmoil over Batman's disappearance and that something must be done about it in order to prevent crime from running rampant.
So, a reluctant Dick takes on the mantle of the Batman, and quickly encounters Damien Wayne who came back from his retreat in Tibet to discover the whereabouts of his father.  Damien tells Dick that he needs him to pull off his Batman impersonation, which even Batwoman isnt' buying into.
Spoiler Alert - Identities are revealed and Bruce soon learns that hate can be just as powerful emotion as love and it can motivate a woman to do deadly things.
Alfred does get to shine by taking out two criminals with bare handed boxing techniques.
Highly Recommeded!
Ten Stars!",1455408000,,1446,4.842105263157895

PROS:
1. The ANIMATION is outstanding.
2. The story is centered not only in Bruce Wayne.
3. New CHARACTERS introduced (Both heroes and villains).
4. They really put a lot of work in making creative ACTION SCENES.

CONS:
1. TOO SHORT for a story like this.
2. They reveal the bad guys identity way too soon (halfway through the movie). This takes away the mysterious tone.
3. Doesn't  show the full scale repercussions of batman's vanishing from Gotham City.
4. The ending action scene is pretty standard (compared with the other ones in the movie)

Overall good movie. Totally recommended.",1455235200,2,647,4.758928571428571
7464813,5,B0169PXG8W,"Hate to say so, but this was actually really enjoyable! While not on the level of Flashpint Paradox, it is miles above Throne of Atlantis and most other DC animated recent movies. I really didn't like Damien Wayne, but it is nice to see the character grow by the end of the film. And despite what other reviewers have said about this feeling too PC in terms of diversity, I did like how subtle a lot of the interactions were and not so in your face as in most modern shows. I never found the diversity aspect to be something that made the movie worse by any means, just somewhat unexpected but it was executed in such a way that it felt pretty natural. Story wise the plot was okay, with some moments that genuinely made me laugh when I shouldn't have (Nunjas anyone?). The real gem was the overall animation and the fantastic execution of the fight scenes. PURE GOLD! Even if this does not become a favorite movie, it's worth the watch for the animation alone!",1455148800,,961,4.404494382022472

The villains are terrible, the ""twist"" is just plain stupid & both Batwing & Batwoman are pretty lame & unlikable additions to the team. Also in the past the animated movies being able to go a little darker was cool but ultimately it felt very forced in this film & every time a character cussed or something it just felt cheesy. Also there are a lot of noticeable action/comic book movie clichs used like the pointless & obligatory car chase & barely stopping a giant object from crashing into another.

7464832,2,B0169PXG8W,"The first two-thirds of this film are great, with some strong character development and exciting action scenes. The film also introduces and handles Kate Kane's (aka, Batwoman) sexuality very well: in a restrained and natural way. The film goes out of its way to show how ""adult"" and hard core it is, with lots of light swear words (""I'm making Gotham my bitch!""), cold and sudden murders, and even shows Bruce Wayne naked and in bed with THREE other nude women (in a delusional psychotic dream sequence).  However, the last 20 minutes of this mature build up falls apart when the villains' end-game ""evil plan"" is revealed to be as sophisticated as a 1980s episode of G.I. Joe.  SMALL SPOILERS AHEAD:  The brainwashing of Batwoman's father is inexplicable and very poorly done. Also, every villain who knows Batman's secret identity conveniently dies (I counted three on-screen deaths and three off-screen/implied deaths). Finally, this movie is inconsistent with prior DC animated films like Justice League: DOOM, which is about villains using Batman's secret contingency plans for taking down members of the Justice League (which is based upon a comic book story).  In the comics, Batman also has a contingency plan for himself if he ever came under a psychic or brainwashing attack (Google: Batman of Zur-En-Arrh). I thought this movie was going in that direction (which would've been fantastic), but instead it all comes down to a horribly executed and simplistic plot of ""brainwashing the worlds' leaders to control the world.""  It's like something an eight-year old would've come up with. The Justice League and Batman solo animated films seem to take place in different universe/film continuities, which is also very confusing. Overall, I'm pretty disappointed with how DC handled this movie and the overall progression of its animated franshiches. What was extremely strong several years ago has really gone down hill.",1454976000,2,1927,5.183279742765273
7464833,1,B0169PXG8W,"(Spoiler Warning)

This is not a Batman movie, this is a Batwoman movie with a very unlikable Batwoman. Batman quickly takes to being a background character to let Nightwing and Robin to team up with token black Batman Beyond. Set amongst an inconsequential story whose sole purpose to exist is to move the view from one painfully dialoged scene to another.

Each character falls flat, with dialog written  with clear lack of understanding to their characters and the arcs these characters have already endured over Son of Batman and Batman Vs Robin. Robin is angst driven, then confrontation with Nightwing when the scene requires is. Nightwing's determination to become his own person, to step out of Bruce's shadow and establish a life for himself is replaced with Daddy Issue as Bruce never opened up to him.

Batwoman is the worst of all characters. Her reason's for becoming Batgirl are simply Batman saved her from a rape gang who were in an ally she didn't need to walk down. Not exaggerating, her motivation to become Batwoman is as flimsy as her voice acting. Her dialog often is devoid of emotion, stopping at the end of the sentence as it was read from the script. In the name of diversity she is also a lesbian, a fact the movie will jam down your throat as you watch her hit on a cop with don't just by appearances dialog.

In the same vain each male character is emasculated. Nightwing has daddy issues, Heretic the movies big bad unstoppable villain is a mangina with mommy issues. Literally groveling on his hands and knees to his mother, driven by an out of nowhere desire to have memories of his original self (he's a clone who's life's been accelerated).

Story wise there isn't much to this movie. Heretic joins together a bunch of b-list batman villains to take over Gotham from Black Mask, to then break Batman, and includes the old Batman won't use a gun trope. It's all over the place spending the majority of its screen time featuring characters whine about their past (see Nightwings Daddy Issues, Batwoman's owe my god  life is so bad past, and Robin angst about his Father missing with poor writing).

7464851,1,B0169PXG8W,"THIS REVIEW HAS SPOILERS FROM THE PLOT.

I'm sad to say, this movie sucked.  I liked the previous two films, Son of Batman and Batman Vs. Robin; they were interesting and had a coherent plot.  To be fair, the first 30 or so minutes of Bad Blood had me interested.  But the second half of the move made me feel like some b-rated writer had gotten ahold of a decent half-finished Batman movie script, then without changing anything from the first half, did whatever the heck he wanted with the rest of the plot.

The first half hour made me think that Heretic was an evil version of Damian from the future.  I could roll with that.  But then it's revealed he's actually a clone of Damian, his growth hyper-accelerated to adulthood, created to be the perfect soldier.  Okaaaay, that works too I guessand then Talia shoots him in the head for wanting to have the memories and feelings of being her son by stealing them from Damian.  Creepy and weird, and totally ruined it for me.  Not only that, but later Talia is willing to kill Damian because she feels that Batman has influenced him too much, even though two movies before SHE put Damian in Batman's care BECAUSE she wanted Batman to be a good influence on him.  WHAAAAT.  And Batman calls her a control freak in this movie, though in the previous film she was willing to let Damian make the choice whether to go with her to the League or stay with Batman.  It's like her character had a huge turn-around from the previous films.

My other complaint is that making Batwoman/Katie homosexual in this movie is so painfully obviously a plot device.  I mean, it doesn't even make sense in the flow of the plot (what little there is).  Like, they give us a random scene of her in a bar and asking some girl out, and then that girl arrives at her house at the end of the movie and sits down to dinner with Katie and her dad.  What does this have to do with ANYTHING that happens in the rest of the movie?  It just bothered me because it was unnecessary and poorly done.

Final complaint: I hated the end.  I mean, they have this whole film of all these Bat-themed heroes saving the day because Batman isn't around to do it, then at the VERY END, out of nowhere, Batgirl shows up.  No explanation, no background, no appearances in the previous films.  She's just there.  And Batman is ok with that.  What the heck?  When has he EVER been okay with new people joining the team right off the bat (no pun intended)?",1454716800,4,2456,4.380530973451328

7464885,5,B0169PXG8W,"Batman: Bad Blood is the 3rd installment of the recent Batman animated films featuring Robin & Nightwing. It was preceded by Son of Batman and Batman vs Robin, each great in their own right. This 3rd film is also quite good! I don't think that it's for children as it is VERY adult themed. In fact, NONE of the films in this series are for children!! They are too dark, too graphic and violent for children. If you're a teenager or adult, I think that's fine. However, this film isn't for kids under 13.

Meanwhile, this film introduces new characters which was a good idea, but not necessary. Batwoman isn't necessary, nor is her storyline. BatWing was cool in that he is Lucias Fox's son and is a hero of color. Otherwise, they should've let Batgirl have Batwoman's part. The only letdown is the villain of the story. Was really disappointed with whom they chose to make the villain. Aside from that, it was a great animated film. The animation is GREAT!! Especially the scenes of Gotham and Way...

The movie is a bit of an improvement in the fact that they didn't give Damian Wayne ridiculous abilities to make him look good. Like when they showed little Damian Wayne deafeating Desthstroke all by himself with two gaping holes in his forearms. Or when Damian beat up Batman in Batman vs Robin. But overall, the DC animated titles have lowered in quality story telling ever since Bruce Timm stepped down and Jay Oliva took over. Jay Olivas talent lies in story boarding action sequences, and thats it. But a movie with all action and no quality storytelling leaves you with a bad after taste. Like Spawn.",1454544000,12,782,4.5928571428571425
7464893,5,B0169PXG8W,"This is another well done animated DC film. Marvel just can't compare when it comes to the animation department and the quality of DC films. With that being said, the plot of the film pertains to the so-called death and disappearance of Batman. While Gotham presumes that Batman is missing in action, Night Wing fills his shoes by dawning the bat suit since crime in Gotham just doesn't stop. Of course, Robin and Batwoman immediately know its Dick Grayson behind the mask. All of the heroes are trying to get down to the real reason behind Bruce Wayne's disappearance which involves the League of Shadows. I won't go much further into the plot, but i must say this film has a lot of action and is paced appropriately. There never seems to be a dull moment. The only downside is the film is around 72 mins like many other DC films and i truly wish it was more on the 90 min to 2 hour side.

The only other minor complaint i have is with the animation. Though it is well done, it seems not as polished and fluid as their other films such as Son of Batman or Justice League Doom. At times i notice the anatomy of the characters feet and hands could have been drawn better. I got the blu-ray combo pack and recommend everyone else pick that version up as well. Having the digital HD version is great for streaming on those long trips, boring bus rides, or times when sitting at a coffee shop waiting for a friend to arrive has one going mad.

7464908,3,B0169PXG8W,"Batman: Bad Blood is an animated feature that reunites the Dark Knight with both Robin and Nightwing. The film marks the debut of Batwoman and Batwing, two characters that have only been seen previously on the printed page.

With Batman missing and presumed dead, its up to Dick Grayson (as Batman), Robin, and the new members of the extended Bat family to solve the mystery of the Caped Crusaders disappearance and save him from his sworn enemies, The Heretic and Talia al Ghul.

Adapting some characters for animation proved more difficult for character designer Phil Bourassa than others. Batwoman made the smoothest transition, since her look in the comics is so striking and elegant. The Heretic was problematic because the character hasn't figured in a big way in the comics. Bourassa researched the character on the Internet and used that information as a jumping off point, his imagination completing the job.

The films animation style is limited, which means only parts of the images have motion, usually the mouths and parts of the body involved in fights. This is a less costly form than the traditional full animation pioneered by Walt Disney in such classics as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Pinocchio, and Bambi.

In keeping with Batmans alias, the images are darker than youd expect from an animated film. And there is plenty of action, though the storyline is pretty thin. The recent live action Batman movies have been successful largely due to first-rate writing. Here, everything seems derivative and rushed, looking as if everyone was working against the clock to get this on the market as soon as possible.

The PG-13 rated film comes in a Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack. Bonus extras include two behind-the-scenes featurettes, two cartoons, and a sneak peak at DCs next animated movie, Justice League Vs. Teen Titans.",1454112000,5,1835,5.0230263157894735

This movie was a solid movie, nothing to special but enough to keep me entertain and left me satisfied. This movie isn't anything new or groundbreaking like Under The Red Hood or Mask of the Phantasm but it is an improvement from Throne of Atlantis or Son of Batman. It does have it's cliche moments but with great characters, great fights, great artwork, and good story I will definitely be watching this somewhere in the future. DC you sure are stepping up your game and are putting Marvel Animated Movies to shame.

Also for those complaining this movie being Political Correct READ SOME COMICS. Batwing has always been black and Kate Kane has been a lesbian since the new 52.

Almost all original comics all the heros they're all white because remember white racist America ? Not that long ago. And you're getting your panties in a twist because there's one hero black guy? Really? Her being gay doesn't take away from the movie at all they were all in some kind of relationship and a scene of Bruce in bed with 3 women, but no one is upset about that... That's toatally normal. Complains takes away from how great this movie was!
(Spoiler) I'm really glad they had Rene Montoya in this I hope it's a sign that they'll have her later as the question! Which means two face might show up too!
I'm so glad they got a chance to show Damian a little more matured and how you hear more love when he says ""father"" my heart fluttered!
Some friends say it took a while for it to pick up but I guess I just love the Lore and back stories and twists equal to the action.

If you do have kids I'd be hesitant about the bed scene and some of the killing,  but they are just clothes and talking, not sure if kids would question why he's in bed with 3 women. And Katie does mention that she was in a blur of ""sex and drugs,"" before she changed. Some twists I would imagine would be hard to understand for Some kids. It really depends how how strick a parent you are and how much your kids already know about the bad things in the real world if considering letting them watch this even with the 13 rating.

7464911,1,B0169PXG8W,"Unlike the others my dislike of this has nothing to do with the gay agenda or any such nonsense: I just found this movie to be utterly lacking across the board. The plot was lackadaisical, the voice acting sounded like people reading off of cue cards, the pacing was poor & the actual story was utterly lacking in any kind of story structure.

Even since the movies went NU52 there has been a notable down turn in the quality of the material.",1454025600,4,442,4.390243902439025
7464912,4,B0169PXG8W,"To start I actually own the movie... I bought it on Amazon video.

Bad Blood pretty much tells how Robin, Nightwing, Batwoman, and Batwing all have one thing in common - Batman. For me, the title fits what the movie is about and some... A lot families do have bad blood, but in the end they come together... It is a good storyline, but it has some ""Meh"" moments, but I liked the movie a lot... One thing I did like is the Talia was connected to all of the movies. Heretic was something else, but he got it... In addition, you get history on how Batwoman and Nightwing came to be too... The fight scene: Nightwing vs Batman, Batwing vs Firefly, Batwoman vs Talia, Robin vs Walrus face... The fight scenes were good and Alfred got in some fight time too. We see Katana as well, but she was on Talia's side... Overall I liked the movie, not going to give anything away and I am thinking the next movie will focus on... Well, I'm not spoiling it.

If you rent or buy, then I hope you like it... Sure some people will not like it, but I am not one of them",1453593600,2,1050,4.142156862745098
7464913,5,B0169PXG8W,"I love this series, and I hope they continue with it. Great cast, good script. Of course, there are some plot holes and a bit of deus ex machina, but it's Batman. What else do you expect?",1453593600,5,187,4.081081081081081
7464914,4,B0169PXG8W,"""Rented"" this on my XB1.

I've always been entertained by DC Animated Movies more than Marvel Animated Movies which is unusual for me at times. I was always more of a Marvel Fan Girl but recently, DC has been stepping up to the plate.

Although the movie itself had it's flaws (Batwoman's history was quickly explained, Batwing just puts on a suit and immediately a super bad a**) it has also great fight scenes. Honestly, if it was just Nightwing, Robin, and Batman, I think the story line would've developed more than what was shown here.

Regardless, I enjoyed this sequel to the 2015 Batman vs. Robin. Well, I think that's what it really is supposed to be.",1453507200,2,660,4.576271186440678
7464915,4,B0169PXG8W,"Batman: Bad Blood is DC's latest in several animated films exploring the relationship between Batman and his son, Damian Wayne. You do not need to have seen Son of Batman or Batman vs Robin to ""get"" this film, but it wouldn't hurt. In this film, Batman goes missing, presumed dead, and Dick Grayson steps in to take his place. Alongside them are Batwoman (not to be confused with Batgirl) and Batwing.

Should you watch it with your kids? Violence and fighting reign heavily in this film, like the others. People die. It has mild PG-13 language. And one of the characters is an open homosexual. If those things bother you, perhaps pass.

The good: the animation, fighting sequences, and plot are all pretty decent. They are definitely better than Son of Batman and Batman vs Robin. The biggest improvement was that Damian didn't seem as overpowered as he did in previous installments. The story moves along and doesn't get sidetracked with pointless action sequences as it did previously. Voice acting is good and overall it's a worthwhile film.

The bad: After seeing DC's best films, they still aren't digging deep enough into these characters. That's the biggest problem with all of DC's films lately. You just don't care because there's never any ""moments"" to let you into their heads. The film is basically one long chase. Damian never really reacts to his father's disappearance. Dick Grayson never really opens up about his issues with being in Batman's shadow. Batwoman and Batwing have really no depth. There's just no character building, so the movie lacks the depth it needs to really matter the way Mask of the Phantasm and Under the Red Hood did. I'll never watch these newer movies a second time because there's nothing memorable about them.

DC needs to take a more character-oriented approach and let the action develop around those stories rather than developing action-oriented films and trying to squeeze in moments of characterization. However, the latest bunch of films set in the New 52 universe have all been lacking that ingredient. Whereas the films made during and right after the DC Animated Universe timeframe were all head and shoulders better than what we've been offered lately.

3.5 stars",1453420800,2,2220,4.956989247311828
7464916,4,B0169PXG8W,"Ok first off, the title is horrible. With that out of the way, the movie itself is actually pretty good. You can see my further reviews of DC Animated films and one of my constant gripes is that the films of recent don't live up to some of the best (Dark Knight Returns, Year One, Red Hood, to name a few).
Avoiding spoilers this movie is basically another mash up of stories that some mesh well, while others do not. Like last times ""Court of Owls"" watered down story, ""Bad Blood"" is a SEVERELY watered down version of ""Batman Incorporated"". While the last film bared some semblance to ""Court of Owls"", Bad Blood literally has almost nothing in it that reminds me of ""Batman Incorporated"".

Now with that mini rant out of the way I will say this, the film is pretty decent and a good fun solid 70 minutes. By retaining several of the same voice actors DC is slowly building up a continuity in its film universe unlike many of its other ""one off"" films. I like this. I enjoy the fact that this brings continuity as well as leads us to a bigger story. My main problem with the film, as I said in my previous review, is Damian Wayne. I have given him a pass in my last review but by this point in the comic universe, Damian is like able. We want to cheer for him. Instead he is still just as pompous and annoying as when he was first introduced. He's not arrogant in the Han Solo type of way, but a bratty 12 year old kind of way. Yes I am aware that's what he is, but in Grant Morrisons run with the character Damian evolves and becomes more likeable and personable. Morrisons run with Dick Grayson as Batman and Damian as Robin solidified Damian as a character and introduced us to IMO the best batman and robin pairing. Instead ""Bad Blood"" does this pairing in a measly 15 minutes before ending it. No progression for Damian, no character evolution. He is no longer closer to Grayson in this film as he was in the last.

Yes as times the film can be a cluster, but it is fun. It's popcorn. Not nessecarily filling or satisfying but fun to eat. Despite all my negative comments I will say this film won't bore you, with the perfect running time and introduction of new characters, it's a solid fun reccomend.

Thank you for reading my review and I hope you enjoy the film! Please reccomend if you found this helpful!",1453420800,43,2316,4.319540229885058

7464918,5,B0169PXG8W,"Although I felt that the previous two films in this series (Son of Batman and Batman vs Robin) were disappointing and was slightly apprehensive about this movie, I was surprisingly impressed by what I saw.

Definitely the darkest installment in the series, it involves a lot of new members of the Bat-family and new villains (not to mention older villains with an enjoyable twist). One of my worries prior to watching this movie was the concern that they might be squeezing in too many characters to develop properly, but the film balances this out very well. Both Batwing and Batwoman get due backstory and development in the given timeframe. I am not overly familiar with either character but felt this movie gave a good introduction to both. This also feels like the first of the three films to really give Damian Wayne proper character development.

Hopefully this movie is a good sign that DC animation is getting back on track after a recent spate of so-so movies.",1453334400,3,970,4.802395209580839

7464920,1,B0169PXG8W,"May contain spoilers. The cast was good and I liked the mystery of Batman disappearing so Nightwing becomes Batman. I disliked the addition to the Batman universe because and I don't care if its in the comics batwoman did not need to be lesbian. I feel like it took away from the hero aspect of it all. I personally and I respect others who feel differently feel that hero cartoons should be directed at the kids. Or at least stay truth to decency. It doesn't matter whats socially considered acceptable what matters is that kids will want to watch this then they'll think they have to be a certain way to look up to their comic book hero. I don't want my niece, daugther cousins watching this.
Pros good cast and mystery elements even some good values
Cons there are mixed messages here and it distracted from what I hoped would have been enjoyable",1453334400,15,849,4.51948051948052
7464921,5,B0169PXG8W,"Batman: Bad Blood is the 3rd installment of the recent Batman animated films featuring Robin & Nightwing.  It was preceded by Son of Batman and Batman vs Robin, each great in their own right.  This 3rd film is also quite good!  I don't think that it's for children as it is VERY adult themed.  In fact, NONE of the films in this series are for children!!  They are too dark, too graphic and violent for children.  If you're a teenager or adult, I think that's fine.  However, this film isn't for kids under 13.

Meanwhile, this film introduces new characters which was a good idea, but not necessary.  Batwoman isn't necessary, nor is her storyline.  BatWing was cool in that he is Lucias Fox's son and is a hero of color.  Otherwise, they should've let Batgirl have Batwoman's part.  The only letdown is the villain of the story.  Was really disappointed with whom they chose to make the villain.  Aside from that, it was a great animated film.  The animation is GREAT!!
