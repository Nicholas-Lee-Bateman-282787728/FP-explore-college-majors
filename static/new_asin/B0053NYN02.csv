Good fun, as are all of Eddie's vehicles of this era.  Some are complaining about bad transfer, but I appreciate the fact we can get to see the film in any condition - its never going to be available on a major label - but its a great opportunity to own it and see it.  Good on Twentieth Century Fox for releasing these archive films!

Its a shame its not available through Amazon UK - as many archive DVDs are - because postal charges and additional customs charges are added on Amazon US and it works out expensive ($47 for two DVDs!).  If it was available on Amazon UK I'd only pay 1.25 postage and it would have taken half the time to arrive!",1489881600,,774,4.099337748344371

8455321,1,B0053NYN02,"First off this is a GREAT Cantor film. Great sets, great cast and a lot of fun. The problem is the transfer.

It appears that a 16mm Dupe was the source material for this version. The picture is dark at times, and there is a ""hiss"" on the soundtrack which is common in 16mm prints. I know for a fact that pristine 35mm prints exist. Why didn't Fox put some care into this release? It could have, and should have been a major relaese. And Fox blew it.

One more thing. A musical number with Tony Martin was cut. Making the film's running time 77 minutes instead of the original 81 minutes. SHAMEFULL!!",1366761600,16,600,4.300884955752212
8455322,3,B0053NYN02,"Unfortunately, the folks at Fox don't give a damn about film
or the quality of the dvds they release. Overall, the picture
quality of Ali Baba Goes To Town is acceptable except for a few
problems in the beginning. There is a fairly annoying hum for the
first half hour of the film. Fortunately, it cannot be heard
during the musical sequences. I would have rated this film 4 stars
if the quality of the dvd were better.

If you are a fan of Eddie Cantor, you will enjoy this musical comedy.
The big song and dance number, Swing Is Here To Sway (with the
delightful Paris Sisters), is a wonderful treat, even if Eddie
performs in blackface. He later appears in drag as a Harum 'beauty'.

The supporting cast includes Tony Martin, Roland Young, June Lang,
Louise Hovick (aka Gypsy Rose Lee), Raymond Scott and His Quintet,
John Carradine, Virginia Field, Alan Dinehart, Douglass Dumbrille,
Warren Hymer and the Paris Sisters...unbilled: Lynn Bari,
Lee J. Cobb and Marjorie Weaver...
brief cameos: Phyllis Brooks, Dolores Del Rio, Douglas Fairbanks,
Jack Haley, Sonja Henie, Victor McLaglen, Tyrone Power, Ritz Brothers,
Cesar Romero, Ann Sothern and Shirley Temple.

I urge fans of 20th Century Fox films to call them at 888. 223. 4369
and voice your opinion. If enough people call, they may improve the
quality of their dvds and stop with the pan and scan releases of
widescreen films. The irony is that Fox created CinemaScope and now
they are turning their back on widescreen movies on dvd.",1366243200,12,1491,4.793774319066148
8455323,4,B0053NYN02,"This film shows Eddie Cantor, still a Star, but no longer at the top. One of the premiere vaudevillians,a Ziegfeld Follies regular, among the most successful movie stars in a series of Sam Goldwyn hits, super (primitive) ratings radio performer, he is now at 20th Century Fox, in a routine musical. He will continue to make the occasional film but no longer in ambitious vehicles. He will continue in radio until its demise as a major entertainment center and then star for NBC, rotating with such as Martin and Lewis, to challenge Ed Sullivan; of course, he will entertain the troops during the War, but the mid-fifties will see ill-health put an end to a sparkling career.
These are the reasons why you might want to see this 1937 outing. It should not be solely something to watch for historical reasons. A couple of experienced tune-smiths produce workable though forgettable (and forgotten) songs. He does a few production numbers which show the kind of thing he had done, still with vigor, but with the vigor of  a man in his mid-forties. He does work in black-face, something just not done today, but a commonality on stage and screen in those days. Take a look so you know what it was like. The Peters Sisters are an excellent trio in song, and the other supporting singers and dancers do pretty well, the latter under the direction of Sammy Lee, who created many dance numbers in the early days of talkies. Finally, there is a chance to hear and see in dance, Raymond Scott's very popular 'Twilight in Turkey'. (Scott was one of the most creative musical figures of his time, although pretty well forgotten today, except for people like me. )
In sum, this is a reasonably entertaining movie starring someone who was rarely out of the upper tiers of show business for more than forty years.",1355270400,8,1798,4.689873417721519
