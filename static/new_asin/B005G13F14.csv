I had high hopes for this movie (and adore Japanese TV and movies), but unfortunately I don't know Japanese and had to rely on the ridiculous subtitles. Other than finding the English translations difficult to follow, it's obvious the translator didn't know what they were doing because the English that's subtitled (about a 1/4 of the film is in English) is just as bad! The spoken English is great. The subtitles -- I tell you, I don't think I've giggled that much in a long time.

If I find myself watching the movie again any time soon, I'll note down some specific examples. There is a scene with a science teacher talking about the universe that I remember being particularly amusing.",1335398400,,791,4.731884057971015
