5893522,1,B00E6PUYJW,I DID NOT LIKE MOST OF EACH OF THESE MOVIES.  I LIKE THE MORE TRADITIONAL STORIES AND THESE WERE A LITTLE TOO CRASS FOR ME.  CRASS AND CHRISTMAS DO NOT GO TOGETHER.,1384819200,6,164,4.09375
5893523,3,B00E6PUYJW,"I'm enjoying the movies okay but disappointed because the first DVD only had one movie on it. I never saw Holiday Spin. Holiday Spin was listed on the DVD itself but not listed when I put the DVD in the player. When I'm done watching the last movie, it's going to Goodwill.",1384646400,,273,4.269230769230769
5893524,5,B00E6PUYJW,I've seen The Christmas Consultant & The March Sisters which I both loved.  The Holiday spin is okay and I haven't seen Hollys Holiday yet.  So I figured this was a great price for 4 movies since I paid more for the purchase of the March Sisters last Christmas.,1383696000,,261,4.3061224489795915
5893525,5,B00E6PUYJW,"This delightful collection of new holiday movies arrived in time for a weekend of watching movies. These are original movies brought to the public through the collection.

The four movies as mentioned above were titled: THE CHRISTMAS CONSULTANT, HOLIDAY SPIN, THE MARCH SISTERS AT CHRISTMAS, AND HOLLY'S HOLIDAY. The various topics of each one I found interesting and entertaining too.

I will review two of the movies in this report.

The first one is THE CHRISTMAS CONSULTANT starring David Hasseloff and Caroline Rhea. Caroline's character is under a lot of stress: moving her family to a new location, a new job, the holidays are just around the corner, and not only are family members arriving but her boss insists on a Christmas party in which a new client will attend. David 's character comes to the rescue with decorating the house, baking, getting everyone involved in Christmas, and basically taking over the holiday. As the family enjoys Christmas ,Caroline's character feels even more stress until she shows her anger and frustration.

The movie reminds us how our family and love for our family are the most important aspects of the holiday. Spending time with our family and friends is builds more memories than all the glitter and sparkle, the gifts and the fancy decorations.

The second movie was THE MARCH SISTERS AT CHRISTMAS. This movie is a contemporary take on LITTLE WOMEN. The sisters find our that their parents want to downsize to a smaller home and they move out. The sisters are determined to renovate their childhood home.

By sticking together, working side by side, and finding others who will help with their huge undertaking, they complete their renovation in time for Christmas. In between the work on the house the women have their careers to explore, there are some complications with men they love, and they find joy and happiness with each other in spite of their individual differences which is of course what makes a family so interesting.

5893526,5,B00E6PUYJW,I love these movies the first one is a lot corny. The second one with Ralph Macchio is a good touching story about a Dad and son...not a normal story line..the march sisters is an enjoyable re-make...and holly's christmas is so cute to watch her uncle's work together to take care of her...,1379462400,25,290,4.490566037735849

5893532,3,B00E6PUYJW,"Four Christmas movies on two disks.  I bought this collection for Hollys Holiday, the rest were varying degrees of dreck.  The first movie deals with an obnoxious Christmas consultant (David Hasselhoff).  Christmas is referred to as a pagan ceremony.  This not so jolly tale includes a mother-meltdown (Caroline Rhea); she wrecks her house and the holiday.  The second movie has little to do with Christmas.  It involves a deadbeat dancer dad (Ralph Macchio) who has to bring home the son he abandoned after the sons mother is killed.  Theres a dance duel and a sore loser.  Not much joy to be found in this tedious story.  The third movie is a rip-off of Little Women and not in a good way.  They made it modern and populated it with tedious people.  The character Jo is particularly nasty (unreasonable, unrealistic, irresponsible, and stubborn).  One of the nitwit sisters sets the house on fire.  There are several turgid non-romantic entanglements and numerous boo-hoo-moments.  Self-righteous Jo constantly rides roughshod over her sisters (Im surprised no one mentioned an anger management class for the hateful wretch).  Then theres a water heater accident.........just when you don't think it could get any worse.

The last movie is why I bought this collection.  The humorous plot concerns a woman (Claire Coffee) who yearns for a perfect life, a perfect boyfriend, and after a thump on the head she gets it (in her dreams).  Careful what you wish for.",1482710400,5,1462,4.995850622406639

The Christmas Consultant is a favorite and has a lot of humor! The March Sisters At Christmas is one I always look forward too!

5893564,1,B00E6PUYJW,"While I enjoy most of the holiday movies on Lifetime, none of their DVD releases come with subtitles. I have to watch them when they show on TV so they are closed captioned.

A fun holiday flick to watch every year. I actually bought this set for the movie the March sisters , loosely based in little women,(very loosely).

5893585,4,B00E6PUYJW,"I have already given a review of the Christmas Consultant so I will just say again I really enjoyed that movie, even though some of the other reviews were a little mixed.  As for the other three movies in this collection......

 I really enjoyed Holly's Holiday.  It was a sweet story with a lot of funny moments.  I'm just not too sure about the ending, or the twist at the end.

Holiday Spin was my most favourite in this collection.  It didn't have much to do with Christmas (except for a small scene where they buy a Christmas tree and decorate it), but I didn't care because it was so enjoyable to watch.  I loved the costumes at the end, and the dancing was fantastic.  Did anyone else think the teenage boy looked a bit like Zac Efron from High School Musical.  They even dance the same.

As for the March Sisters At Christmas, this was my least favourite.  Maybe because I love the original story, and the faithful adaptation to film.  I thought Amy came across as very spoilt.  Jo was a little too cold and bland for my liking instead of just being feisty like she was in the original story.  Meg was probably the only character I liked in this version, and I barely remember Beth's character in this movie except the older gentleman seemed to have a creepy fascination with her.  I won't say skip this movie because other people may have a different opinion, but that's just how it came across to me.

This is still a great collection of movies at a great price.",1417910400,9,1472,4.392592592592592

I watched that one first because some reviewers said it wasn't the best movie so I thought I would get it out of the way.  It turns out I loved it.  I've been a fan of Caroline Rhea since her Sabrina days, and she didn't disappoint in this movie.  Her facial expressions still crack me up, but she can also tug at my heart strings in her more serious moments too.  As for David Hasselhoff, his character is a little over the top at times (almost like Willy Wonka without the chocolate factory), but I really understood his character towards the end, and it explained why he acted the way he did.  As for the scene where everything fell apart at the end, I really felt sorry for David's character, and actually had tears in my eyes (yes, I'm  a big softie sap when it comes to these types of movies).  I can't wait to watch the rest of these lifetime holiday films.",1414627200,9,989,4.251336898395722

THE MARCH SISTERS AT CHRISTMAS is a modern (and adult) take on LITTLE WOMEN, and mostly I liked what I saw. I thought they translated the characters well to the 21st century--some people were upset that John and Meg had sex (and on Marmee's bed, too!) and that the girls held parties where alcohol was drunk, but these are modern mores, not Alcott's 19th century children's book guidelines: Jo, a talented writer, is making a living keeping up Twitter accounts for celebrities; Meg is an attorney; Beth is a shy music college graduate who isn't pushing herself enough for Meg's taste (Meg always was a little bossy, but the thought of the real Meg pushing the real Beth like this is kinda over the top), and Amy is an aspiring actress and a bit of a wild child. All the young women are horrified when they find out Marmee is going to sell their beloved old house, so while she is away nursing her war-injured husband (Mr. March in this is a photojournalist who was injured on the job), they decide to spruce up the place so she will change her mind.

The female cast is pretty good; the younger male cast...eh. I don't see Laurie (known as ""Teddy"" to everyone, not just to Jo in this outing) as a jock, and John Brooke is this wild-haired sad sack. However, John Shea makes a terrific Mr. Lawrence (here he's Teddy's uncle, not grandfather) and there's also Marcus Bhaer, who's older than Jo, but definitely not portly and grey.

Based on the reviews, not to everyone's taste, but I found it an enjoyable update.",1506470400,,1653,4.521739130434782
