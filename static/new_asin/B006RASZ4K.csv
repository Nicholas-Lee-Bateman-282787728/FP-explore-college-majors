5014764,5,B006RASZ4K,"Wow! My attention was immediately captured by Lise's unique and engaging delivery of valuable information.  Staging 101 is an amazing tool for homeowners, stagers and the real estate community.  Lise provides you with a clear and concise understanding of why staging is so important.  She also provides solid, statistical data throughout the video, which reinforces the benefits of staging, as well as step-by-step instructions on how to stage a property.  Her knowledge and expertise are clearly evident throughout.  Staging 101 is a must have for all stagers, regardless of their experience level, and for the homeowner, who wants to sell their property.",1327795200,,656,5.392156862745098

5014766,5,B006RASZ4K,"I'm always on the look-out for works that have the ""WOW"" factor & Lise's Home Staging 101 DVD has it. In the first 14 minutes, she explains the ABCs of ""Why Stage?"" in a clear, no-nonsense manner making this a really helpful tool for me as a Home Stager in my presentations to home owners and Real Estate agents. Lise is masterful with her use of statistics which will help the more analytical home owner(and anyone else) understand the importance  of Home Staging ""to the bottom line"".

Her advice and tips for getting a home ready to sell are ""right on"" and would benefit anyone in selling their home faster and for more money!

I believe Home Staging 101 is a super addition to the Professional Home Staging industry.",1327622400,,720,4.565891472868217
5014767,5,B006RASZ4K,"Watching this DVD is like tuning in to a great TV show--fun to watch with real tips and techniques that anyone can put into immediate use.  It's a lot like watching Suze Orman give great advice about your finances--her conviction and credibility makes you want to take action right away.  The information that Lise shares makes perfect sense and makes you want to jump up and start rearranging furniture!

As someone who's lived in and sold a number of luxury homes, I know firsthand how important home staging is--and in today's competitive market, it's more important than ever!  What I like about Home Staging 101 is that it's not just a show you watch once.  It's actually more of a reference that you keep going back to.  And since it's divided into easy to find sections and topics, you can literally cue up the DVD to the room or topic that you're focusing on.

I think this would be an amazing gift that every real estate agent should give to their sellers.  Whether those sellers work with a professional home stager or choose to do it themselves, every seller in every price point would benefit from watching and implementing Lise's easy-to-follow tips and instructions.

As Suze Orman says, ""Many people are in the dark when it comes to money. I'm going to turn on the lights."" Well, in Home Staging 101, Lise Desormeaux literally ""turns on the lights"" on what makes a home sell faster and for more money. I recommend it to anyone who wants to a competitive advantage in marketing a house for sale!",1327536000,,1509,4.642857142857143
5014768,5,B006RASZ4K,"As a professional stager, I was very impressed with this dvd. In the first 15 minutes Lise answers the most important question of all - why stage? along with other relevant questions about staging, with clear explanations, and a sense of humor. The rest of the dvd, the actual ""how to"" segments, are full of important information and excellent instruction.

I agree with Lise's viewpoint - staging is about doing the work so that your very large investment is ""ready to market"". Occasionally, there is a misunderstanding regarding staging - that it is to hide flaws, or to soften the harsh feel of an empty house. This video explains clearly that the goal of staging is to create a move-in ready property, with furnishings that will help buyers bond emotionally with the potential new home they are viewing.

Home Staging 101 - Why Stage, would be an excellent tool for anyone, stager, real estate agent or other, addressing a group on the importance of staging. It acknowledges how all parties, homeowner, buyer and agent, benefit from staging, then tells you how to get the job done! I would recommend Home Staging 101 to anyone ready to make the property they are marketing the one everyone wants to buy, whether they stage themselves, or bring in a professional.",1327363200,3,1266,4.829493087557604
5014769,5,B006RASZ4K,"No other video that I have seen, gives so much useful information. I can take all that knowledge, and bring it to my own Home staging career. It was put together very well and it made a lot of sense, even for beginners. I would recommend this DVD in the future to anyone needing help in this area.",1326240000,,297,4.137931034482759
5014770,5,B006RASZ4K,"I have been staging Metro-Atlanta homes since 2007, seeing all types of listings at all price points. As an Approved Instructor offering 3 CE credit hours to Georgia Real Estate Agents on home staging, I saw Lise's DVD (a fellow Atlanta Stager) and was curious as to her point of view and staging style. I was delighted to discover her perspective is in complete alignment with my understanding of what staging is, what it means and how much work it takes to present a home in 'Market Ready' condition.

This DVD is also an asset to me as a Stager. It is a resource to provide Agents in their toolbox of necessary information and it communicates to Sellers the value of staging. It is great because Lise details with great accuracy and fact the question ""WHY STAGE?"".

Using this DVD, does NOT put your business at risk for losing clients, at best it displays your professionalism and desire to clearly communicate how much work staging requires. The information provided to the consumer (seller) is thorough, yet it may seem overwhelming when the seller gets down to business.  They will still need the expertise and neutral eye of a professionally trained Home Stager.  They are not trained to know the current trends in furnishings, fixtures and surfaces.

Most importantly, Lisa puts her money where her mouth is in our industry.  She is on the Atlanta Chapter Board for RESA, the leading Real Estate Staging Industry Association.  She knows the importance of pricing staging services accurately, understanding that staging does provide thousands of dollars in ROI (return on investment) to homeowners.

It is so important for our clients to understand staging is not fluff, it is turning their home into a PRODUCT in which we MERCHANDIZE it according to the types of buyers available in their market. Staging benefits sellers, Agents and BUYERS. The majority of buyers do NOT want fixer uppers, but move-in ready condition. The HOME STAGING 101 DVD can transform listings into an attractive product with more buyer appeal when used effectively.",1325635200,2,2049,4.9533527696793005
5014771,5,B006RASZ4K,"Prior to watching Lise Desormeaux's Home Staging 101, I thought I knew how to prepare my home for sale - you know, keep everything dusted, clean, and otherwise tidy. Well, shows what I know. Success in selling a home is so much more than just tidying up. With Lise's how-to, step-by-step DVD I discovered all of those subtleties that I had overlooked for the first two months my house was on the market. Within weeks of following Lise's instructions, I found a buyer and got my home sold! I highly recommend this DVD. I also think this DVD would be great for anyone in the Real Estate market because the information in this video would be a HUGE help to agents and sellers in this tough market.",1325462400,2,694,4.47244094488189

Love Lise's tips in selling one's home - I'm not in the market to sell but want to keep my home in the best possible condition as if I was !  One will learn to have the eye to little but important details. Her tips are so helpful and love the tips for the top three rooms to maximize one's positive selling !

8503534,5,B006RASZ4K,"Well I'm not in Real Estate, and I fail miserably at home decorating, so this DVD was like a step by step tutorial in home decorating! I know it is geared to those who are trying to sell their homes, but ANYONE can benefit by the incredible tips Lise offers in this compelling and easy to follow DVD. Each section showed me ways I could spruce up my home by de-cluttering and keeping an eye on details on a room by room basis. Great ideas by a delightful and energetic hostess who clearly knows what she is doing when it comes to making your home sell!! I'd recommend it to anyone.

8503536,5,B006RASZ4K,"OMG, I have had my home on the market for almost a year.  The economy may say that the realestate market is down, but by using the steps in this video I was able to sell my home in less than 4 months.  Also, I had it on the market for a reduced price and was able to negotiate up if I left everything, for an additional $35,000. This young lady knows what she's talking about and keeps reminding me to stay full of energy. I wish you all the success it brought me, and i also suggest not only buy the video for yourself, but for anyone you know selling their home.",1330300800,,564,3.982300884955752
8503537,5,B006RASZ4K,"I am a native Atlantan, a top tier realtor and have been selling real estate for 30+ years.  I also have a back ground in decorating with `Designs by CiCi'.  I thought I knew a lot about design, colors and staging myself until I met Lise.  I can tell you that I work with Lise in Atlanta and she has helped me sell 4 houses not to mention 1 recently in less then a week.  I can also tell you that Lise is the only stager I use but after watching Home Staging 101 I realized that she is the same in action and in person as she is in the video.  That's incredible because in this video she walks you through your home just like she does in person and you'll know immediately what furniture, rugs, accessories, pillows and colors you need to make it look fabulous whether your selling a home or just wanting a polished designed look. The information in this video is so detailed that honestly I was completely amazed and I'm sure you will be too.
