6597500,5,B00MP0T0U4,"OK, let's  start with the staging: this is NOT a traditional approach to i Capuleti. Joyce DiDonato refers to it as ""abstract"" in her interview, and perhaps it is. The costumes are more of Dickens than 14th Century Verona, the stables of the Capulet Palace are full of hanging English-style saddles (which, if memory serves, had not been developed in the 14th Century) and Juliet's bedroom has only a toilet and a sink. So how in the world could your humble reviewer give this a five star rating?

It's the singing, gentle reader, which is exquisite. All the singer do well, but when Mesdames DiDonato and Cabell take the stage, wonderful sounds ensue. This is true whether the singing is solo or in duets, but with the latter, the blending of the voices and the perfect rapport between the ladies is as close to celestial as these old ears have ever heard. I try to avoid hyperbole in these reviews, because it does not assist prospective buyers, but the musical quality of this performance trumps the issues I have with the staging.

I Capuleti was composed in six weeks, an unusual timing for Bellini, who did not usually compose at the pace of his contemporaries, Rossini and Donizetti. It followed closely Bellini's single ""flop"", Zaira, and used quite a bit of the music from that work. It enjoyed ""immediate and immense success"" according to Charles Osborne (The Bel Canto Operas) and never quite disappeared from the operatic repertory. Currently, there are two exceptionally well sung versions in CD format, one with Netrebko and Garanca and the other with Mei and Vassilova.

This performance was Nicole Cabell's first essay at the role, according to her interview. She is a lyric, rather than coloratura soprano and is possessed of a rich, flexible voice with adequate range and profound musicality. I had not heard her before and was delighted to make her aquaintance.

Nothing I can say about Joyce DiDonato has not already been stated with more depth than I am capable of articulating. She is a gifted singer with immense stage presence. Anyone who takes issue with that evaluation should take a peek at Maria Stuarda.

Samir Pirgu does a fine job vocally as Tebaldo; in fact, I was pleasantly surprised by his singing, believing him to be a Mozartian. His acting skills, however, need work, although I fault the director for leaving him without any stage business while the orchestra plays a finale or two.

I am a huge fan of Maestro Frizza and he does not disappoint. Neither do the chorus and orchestra.

Disc quality in Blu ray is definitive; picture and sound are full, detailed and flawless.

This one is a winner, with all my reservations about staging. Opera is, after all, theatre, and as such needs to be seen as well as heard, especially in that wonderful HD MA  sound!",1416182400,11,2795,4.780082987551867
6597501,1,B00MP0T0U4,"It is a pity that this so rarely performed and very beautiful opera by Bellini has been so badly mistreated by SFO. It is an ugly too modern production that does not fit with the beautiful music. Romeo and Giulietta voices blend quite well but Romeo should have at least cut her hair to look like a man. I hate travesti roles ( Romeo, Oscar, Cherubino, Octavian, etc.) I heard Pavarotti and Jaime Aragall in a pirated recording of this opera and the effect was so different!",1415664000,12,474,4.459770114942529
6597502,4,B00MP0T0U4,"I was pleased to find this Blu-ray available at War Memorial Opera House a few days ahead of Amazon release date, and surprisingly at a noticeable discount as well.  Wouldn't you have expected full retail price at the 'Gift Shop', full MSRP or even higher??

I am really surprised and happy at the quality of the current crop of Blu-rays coming out of San Francisco Opera.  They are cutting edge--in my opinion, among the finest technically in the world.  Picture, sound, musical performance, camera work etc.  All outstanding.  The SFO videos keep their extras and interviews etc. as a separate menu item, not knocking you over the head with them everytime the curtain goes down.  SFO videos are elegant and beautiful and give you more the actual feeling of a nice evening out, being there.  Yes, I do love the San Francisco Opera :)

Now, about Bellini's Montecchi & Capuleti.  First let us note it is not exactly the Shakespeare story, in the way Verdi adapted Macbeth or Falstaff.  No, the Bellini opera is based on Italian sources that pre-date Shakespeare.  Interestingly also it is the rewrite of an earlier unsuccessful Bellini opera, one Zaira.  Read the Wikipedia article, it is an interesting history.

Now as to this particular production.  For those who require a traditional production, such as SFO's recent Traviata or even more to the point, their traditional-to-the-point-of-reactionary Ballo in Maschera, this will not fit the bill. Neither can it be categorized as ""mostly traditional, somewhat abstracted, still visually very beautiful"" as for example their gorgeous production of Norma.  No, I would have to characterize this staging as something from an alternate reality.

I would not call it ""modernized"" per se ... what looks like this in the modern world?  I would rather call it surreal, abstracted.  The costumes alone are (perhaps) modernized to the time of Bellini, scruffy formal wear with stovepipe hats, worn and dirtied in the sweatshops and soiled by Industrial Revolution-era particulate emissions.  The rest of the stage accoutrements do not seem to suggest anything in particular--they are mostly blank walls swathed in muted browns, blues, grays, and greens.  Perhaps there is some message intended, but I am more interested in Bellini, not much interested in digging for someone else's message.  At least I'm grateful the scenery is drab rather than loud, coming out as a visual shockwave.  Meaning if I have to watch a troublesome staging, at least let it be dark and drab, rather than calling even more undue attention to itself (for example, by being gleaming white and bright, as in SFO's recent Partenope).

So if you are looking for the traditional visual Romeo and Juliet experience, stick with the Zeffirelli movie ... or possibly the Gounod opera with Alagna.  Those are beautiful and romantic.  You should not come to this production with those expectations.  Rather you should simply expect some of the best bel canto singing available in the modern world, and enjoy it on those terms.

The music performance in this production is strikingly excellent with not a weak link in the ensemble.  Both soprano leads (Romeo & Juliet are both played by women, even in Bellini's time) are enjoyable to hear, with superb technique.  Their voices are also contrasting, an ideal not always achieved in casting.  The lesser parts are excellent, the chorus is excellent, and the orchestra and conducting is excellent.  Sorry about all the excellents.  I have no complaints at all, musically--my quibbles are only on non-musical matters.  (Even the acting throughout is natural and believable.)

I will throw out one more observation that does not often get mentioned.  I hate hearing mechanical Italian, phonetically-learned Italian with no apparent understanding.  It happens everywhere, I am afraid even in Italy.  Here, the Italian sounds natural from everyone.  (I shall have to give it a relisten because I agree that claim is particularly outlandish.)

In short, I enjoyed the music, the acting, the diction, and the technical qualities of the video and audio.  I did not care for the staging, but did not find it a total deal-breaker.  Hence my rating:  4 stars.

8673526,2,B00MP0T0U4,"First of all the singing was 5 Stars - I can not take anything away from the singing.  The staging was 1Star - it was a mess.  The sets and costumes, I will give minus 3 Stars.  They were like a bad dream.  At one point, you wonder where Romeo parked his motorcycle.  The use of leather for so much of the costumes was way over done and the dresses just looked like rags draped over someone.  I have seen better in a second hand shop.  What ever happened to the traditional staging, sets and costumes for the period in history where the Opera was written for.  This is one production that is better to listen to then watch.

8673527,4,B00MP0T0U4,"The best version of this opera out there. In fact, the best opera written about Romeo & Juliet, far better than Gounod's Romo et Juliette (1867, revised 1888).",1488326400,,159,4.714285714285714
8673528,5,B00MP0T0U4,"I knew a young man once who was a B+/A- student. At the beginning of his Sophomore year in high school, however, something clicked, and he went on to become valedictorian in both high school and college. It was some kind of an IQ boost.
As I watched this Blu-ray from the San Francisco Opera, I came to think that something like this had happened to Bellini in the second half of this opera; he became the Bellini we all know and love in the rest of his works.
He had the benefit of the outstanding libretto, which was the latest of a number of libretti based on the Italian sources. Felice Romani's Romeo and Tybalt are more noble figures than Shakespeare's. The English characters are immature, boys becoming men without really growing up. That Tybalt dies without undergoing any character development, and that Romeo is only sorry he killed him because he was Juliet's cousin. In this libretto, they both learn of Juliet's (feigned) death while in mortal combat, and both are transformed by remorse, each begging the other to kill him while refusing to do so for the other. Romeo takes the potion because Tebaldo refused to kill him!
At that moment in the story, Bellini's music ratchets up to a new level, and every note of music becomes perfect and inevitable. For the first half of the opera, there is a high level of workmanship, but many of the melodies are negotiable. If Bellini had not been under time pressure, while actually ill, he might have done something different. But from the duel onwards, no human being could have written any better music.
I think the singers under their director and the players under their conductor are carried along into higher spheres as well at that point in this production. I was a little put off by poor Juliet having to wear a skiff through almost the whole opera, though obviously a rich girls' skiff, and having to balance on top of furniture and at the edge of the orchestra pit, a girl on the edge physically as well as emotionally. But the handling of the tomb scene is so sublime as to be insuperable. And the singers, who were doing great work individually for the first half of the opera, become a vocal texture wonderfully knit together, such a feature of the rest of Bellini's work.
I think Romeo made Bellini a genius, and that those who perform or hear Bellini's Romeo can become transmuted as well. Sometimes this happens in a given operatic performance, and it happened for me in this one. I am only sorry I waited until two years after I bought the Blu-ray before actually making the time to watch it!",1481068800,,2565,4.59041394335512

8673530,4,B00MP0T0U4,"I will quote from the Opera News review: ""... as the DVD began, I wondered, would Joyce di Donato and Nicole Cabell's voices blend as beautifully as i recalled?  Would Vincent Bousard's production seem utterly inane? The answer to both is yes.""
In other words, buy the CD, not the DVD.  Inane is a kind word: the production sucks. Bellini is probably the composer most affected by the current mania of idiotic producers who want to reshape Bel Canto operas.  Vocally, it is a marvel, but i could not take the transposition to a David Copperfield scenario.  Another Bellini production down the drain.  If this keeps up, I'm going back to CD's. Meanwhile I will listen to the DVD.  God forbid I should watch it.  By the way, Cabell is one gorgeous creature!  My four stars are ONLY for the vocal part.  The production deserves a -0.  FURTHER NOTE: On a second listening, I was able to concentrate on the voices, not the production.

8673531,5,B00MP0T0U4,"I admit that the foremost reason for my acquiring this DVD is Didonato's Romeo.
Back in 2009, there was a French production of Bellini's "" I Capuleti e I Montecchi"" between Didonato and Netrebko that was never released. I saw bootleg excerpts of it on Youtube at some point of time. Then came the DG release of this work with Netrebko, Garanca as Romeo.
It was some years afterwards, in 2012, that San Francisco Opera very wisely staged this work with Didonato as Romeo.
I have heard of Miss Cabell, since her spectacular win at Cardiff in 2005. She, however, did not become an overnight star, but some how got regulated to the less glamorous venues, though singing top notch performances.
So we have a very very nice (indeed, more than 'nice) surprise of her singing Giulietta alongside Didonato.
The result? It is spectacular, it is sensational. These two leads have such marvelous musicality and chemistry, and both voices blend together so well ( I can imagine that Didonato will hardly find a better partner in this work than Cabell these days). In these bel canto works, Monserratt Caballe has been my benchmark for years. Now, hearing Nicole Cabell, I rest assured that the great Caballe has eventually found a worthy successor.
Needless to say, the singing and acting of Didonato are both burnished and flawless. Hitherto I loath Joyce in trouser roles. Not here - she convinces right from the moment Romeo enters the stage that she IS Romeo. her voice, her expressions, her body languages, all direct the audience to this reckless and helpless youngster.
The supporting roles are equally well undertaken. Saimir Pirgu is new to me, but he is clearly a top-drawer tenore di grazie, owning a beautiful timbre and marvelous stage presence, if only his acting is a bit less committed as Joyce and Nicole. Bass baritone Li Ao also owns a wonderful instrument, and he makes good uses of it. The role of Lorenzo as well as the Capulet Sr. are by far lessor in this work, but Eric Owen also gives a perfect rendition as Giuliette's father.
I must admit that I am a bit troubled by Giuliette appearing in a sanitary atmosphere and singing her first major scene standing so awkwardly on a sink. This sort of staging needs accustoming to, yet once you go into the heart of the staging, things make good sense. The final Scene has Giuliette standing still before Romeo as if dead. The final death scene has Romeo and Giuliette touching each other's hands (almost for the first time), standing still. Again, they are both dead, and the family members look on the stage floor as if they are both lying down, dead.
This sort of staging is not easy to assimilate, but it is very effective emotionally.
Similarly, the beautiful costuming by Christian lacroix requires certain amount of visual adjustment, but once accustomed to it, they make terrific impact on the drama. Giuliette never had shoes on. The wonderfully lithe and well-postured Nicole Cabell brings out the scantiness of Giuliette's emotional state to a point of heartbreaking intensity. The lighting is simply spectacular.
Of all these wonderful things, my only quibble lies with the conductor. The pacing is a tad to stolid, too unvaried. Luckily the singers manage to pull the score off with their marvelous vocal out pour.",1426377600,3,3282,4.8312611012433395

8673534,5,B00MP0T0U4,"I Capuleti e i Montecchi is a very seldom performed operatic gem from the team of F Romani and V. Bellini. It was first produced at carnival in teatro La Fenice 11 March 1830. It was an immediate success and remained a favorite in Italy and Central Europe for many years. Romani had earlier written a libretto for Nicola Vaccai called Giuletta e Romeo (1825) based on a play by Luigi Scevola (1816). There were numerous plays and operas on this traditional subject. These did not reflect on Shakespear' s drama as he was unknown in Italy until about the time of Verdi.
Romani rewrote the Vaccai story for Bellini. Both operas were well known in the 1840s and later in Italy and contraltos who could master the low notes often substituted the tomb scene from the Vaccai opera into the Bellini opera (it was published as an appendix by Ricordi to Bellini's opera).In later years a tenor often took the part of Romeo (even in the 1967 Edinburg Festival) but this practice is no longer followed.
The music for the opera has some reworkings from a earlier opera Zaira, by Bellini that was not a success. By changing meters and accents the music was refitted into the story and it succeded.
This opera is seldom performed unfortunately. I have seen it live but once: in a small theater in Washington D.C. in the 1960s. The Romeo was Tatiana Troyanos. I was smitten by her and the opera and have loved both ever since, A  previous dvd disc is available from the Ravenna Festival (recorded 2005). The singers do well and the background is a series of moving video images. Clever but it lacks spirit and a good orchestra.
In the preset performance we have an excellent orchestra, decent sets and costumes, good chorus and a great cast of singers.
The Romeo is Joyce Di Donato whom I consider to be one of the few great singers of the day. She is capable of bringing vibrant new life to old scores  such as her breathtaking performance in Maria Stuarda as noted by my colleague John Gleeson above.
The Giuletta of Nicole is also well done. She is a rising young star with a strong voice of depth and excellent technique. In solos she is fine and in duets with Romeo the blending is beautiful and the depth of emotion great. Bellini at his finest!
A short note about the production. Yes, this is the age of RegieTheatre and Euro trash. Yes, it was time to sweep away the dust and cobwebs of 19th and early 20th century scenery, sets  and practice. In this production some of the scenery bits are clever but quite a few are simply silly. However it is in the last analysis the singing that counts and this recording has it. Highly recommended",1422748800,9,2630,4.5210084033613445
