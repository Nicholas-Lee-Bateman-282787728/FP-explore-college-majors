The `Perry Mason' show lasted for nine seasons, a record then. Out of its 271 episodes 120 were used for sixty VHS tapes around 1994. Later 108 of these were used for twenty seven DVD discs in four volumes. In 2006 they started to release the whole series on DVDs, a half season at a time. The First Season was the best as most of its stories came from Gardner's novels. A [year] identifies the original novel.
