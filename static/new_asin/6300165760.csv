210592,4,6300165760,"Being Christmas time I felt it appropriate to review a Christmas movie.  And what better Christmas movies are there than the Silent Night Deadly Night Series?  I know what your saying, But Steve, why choose the second film to review when the first one is far superior?  Well I'll tell you why!  Because this movie is essentially just the first movie done in flashbacks with 15 to 20 minutes of extra footage added.  That's right these guys made a whole sequel and only had to spend enough money to film a few minutes of extra scenes.  Pure genius  and that's what I like in a horror movie...blood, guts and brains (and Santa Claus if it's at all possible)  So remember when deciding which Silent Night Deadly Night to watch, go for number 2  because it's two film in one!",974764800,,771,4.489208633093525

I haven't seen #s 3,4, and 5. I've heard that 4 and 5 aren't  good. I don't know. When I see them I'll tell ya. I think the first silent  night was much better. Billy killed people in such creative way. The deer  head thru that girl's chest was funny. Yeah, I'm a typical teenage girl  finding slasher films funny. That doesn't make me bad. It's entertainment.  Although Even though the first was probably the best I have to compliment  the second on it's interesting death of Mother-what's-her name. I'd  definetly recommend renting this one! : )",967593600,4,706,4.376923076923077

In this sequel, we are following the path of the younger brother of the killer in the first movie.  Which is a very good B movie, it was even picketed for it content..you know a movie is  good if people wanna get rid of it.  Anyways, so we have Eric Freeman  playing the younger brother, haunted by flash backs from the first movie  (which this movie has alot of flashbacks), he begins a rein of terror in a  santa claus suit, as did his brother.  all the b movie elements are evident  here.  bad acting, nudity, sex, killing, blood, etc.  I recommend this  movie to anyone that has seen the 1st one.  The 3rd isn't bad either.  Stop  there.  4 and 5 have nothing to do with the first 3.",956102400,,797,4.206666666666667

I enjoyed this movie alot, but the  middle scenes were sort of driving me crazy, i guess because i was in a bad  mood, but things quickly began to pick up and by the end i was really  fascinated by the movie..it was great, the acting was a bit annoying and  there really was too much of the first one, which was cmpletely  unneccesary, but i enjoyed it...",947894400,,541,4.536082474226804

Pretty stupid sequel is sick and boring at times  but certain events are funny and the lead uses his sexuality to sway the  mood. I realize the intent of the film makers is probably not to make  people laugh, but a movie like this can't help but do much else. Don't wait  around for the DVD version.

210723,1,6300165760,"This movie is flawed in so many ways. First off there are so many flashbacks of the first one,I would recommend just seeing the first one and skipping this. Secondly terrible script and horrid acting by Eric Freeman(Ricky's character) and also slow paced at times unlike the first one that kept me attention the whole film. Thirdy Ricky does a lame job with the killings unlike his predcessor(Billy who was actually scary/crazy),I mean running around with a gun thats lame,and killing someone with jumper cables,give me a break. FINAL VERDICT: SKIP THIS EXCUSE FOR A SEQUEL AND WATCH THE 1984 CLASSIC(SILENT NIGHT,DEADLY NIGHT)WHICH IS A CULT HORROR CLASSIC THAT IS LONG OOP AND HARD TO FIND BUT WELL WORTH IT AND SELDOM ON EBAY IF YOUR LUCKY!",1052611200,,743,4.858267716535433
210724,5,6300165760,"First off, please understand that there is no need to EVER see part 1. This film is all of part 1+ about 20 minutes of extra footage which is then called part 2. The star of the show, Ricky, is in a mental institution after seeing his parents slaughtered by Santa Claus. Ricky's brother killed a bunch of people in pt1 and now its Ricky's turn to deliver holiday cheer on Christmas Eve (which in this movie also happens to be ""garbage day""). While watching this fine feature film, please take note of the attention to detail. Children sled on flat ground. A dirt pile/construction area appears out of nowhere during Ricky's oscar worthy rampage. Trucks kick up dust eventhough there is suppose to be snow on the ground. 2 people manage to sneak away from a five person party in a toy store. Ricky consistantly avoids being hit by the boom mic. Note Ricky's reaction to what his girlfriend says the movie they are watching is about. All the witty comments by the guy in the back of the threatre. And finally how one gentleman realizes that he would rather have a beer than make love to his girlfriend (he's SUCH a pig). I find it hard to believe that this movie is not available on DVD. Let alone that a 15th anniversary edition was not even thought about this year. One day when this movie is appreciated for its true beauty, everyone will regret that they did not see it sooner.  A MASTERPIECE!!!",1039737600,3,1397,4.47843137254902
210725,5,6300165760,"I look forward every year to Christmas time because that means that my buddy and I get to dust off his copy of Silent Night Deadly Night 2. It's become a tradition every December for us to watch the one Christmas movie that truly puts us in the holiday spirit.
First of all, how this movie wasn't nominated for an Oscar is beyond me. This is some of the best acting I've ever seen. The dialogue is terrific. Mesmerizing if I may say so.
There's no need to buy the SNDN part 1 because part 2 has all of the best scenes from the first one and so much more. There are some side-splittingly funny scenes like when this guy trys to rape this girl and she stops him, he says, ""F this, I'm gettin' a beer"". Moments later, he's run over about 30 tmes with his own Jeep Wrangler. Towards the end, the movie theatre scene is one for the ages. You even get to see a set of jumper cables hooked up to a '67 Mustang and placed into a guy's mouth.
Good luck finding a video store that actually carries this movie.

210726,1,6300165760,"I saw the first Silent Night, Deadly Night and actually found it to be a pretty good film. It wasn't too gory, had a pretty well done plot, and delivered a few good thrills and chills along the way! Hey, what do you expect from the usual Class-B thrillers of the eighties?
So, I rented part 2, and I expected a pretty standard sequel. Expecting something that was Halloween 2 to Halloween 1 (higher body count, a few more revelations revealed, but obviously still B-class). Unfortunately, what I got was a clip show of gore from part 1 mixed in with the unfortunately terrible acting on the part of Ricky.
The plot of this movie seemed okay. From what I thought, Ricky the brother of the killer from the first movie, killed some people and was put into a mental institution for questioning. I thought it would flash back and forth in what he did and possibly reveal something that happened to him causing him to snap (besides his spooky ending speech in Silent Night Deadly Night 1).
The actor who plays Ricky is terrible. Everything that comes out of his mouth is honestly laughable. From his first words to when he tells the psychiatrist ""Because........ I was there"", I knew I had made a mistake in renting this. Ricky, proceeds to tell the well acted psychiatrist all about his brothers killings, things he wasn't there for so how would he know it! Then, he goes on talking about how he killed some people, the best one being a guy with an umbrella in an alley.
The murders in this movie are pretty pathetic. They are much more abundant than in the first movie, and not as well done as in the first one. He actually goes on a shooting spree in this movie, now how is that scary? I'm sorry, but there was no suspense and if he was trying to pull an American Psycho on us he failed miserably as he is nowhere near as easy to emphasize with as Patrick Bateman and Rachel Newman (American Psycho 1 and 2 GO SEE THEM!!!).
All in all, this movie is not worth a buy unless under $5. If you are curious rent it, but I just didn't care for the movie.
However, something did tell me to rent Silent Night, Deadly Night 3 Better Watch Out. Hopefully that will be better, as it was mentioned in last months Fangoria (May's Issue). It has Mulholland Drive's Laura Herring, a former Miss USA! I'll review that soon, but to all of you out there who read my reviews peace! I love y'all!",1028764800,3,2373,4.383219954648526
210727,1,6300165760,"After my review of the first film, I did not think the sequel could be any worst...boy, was I wrong.
This 88 minute film rehashes the entire first film through flashback for the first 40 minutes. Not only does it cover the plot, it shows all the awful scenes that made the first one so bad.
This time out, adult Ricky is talking to a psychiatrist about his Santa dressing killer brother Billy in a mental hospital. It seems Ricky has a good memory, since he repeats scenes that neither him or his brother witnessed, and the film makers change the plot of the first film to suit their needs. Ricky also seems to have taken some classes on how to play a character completely wrong. His scenes with the psychiatrist are terrible.
Ricky kills the psychiatrist and escapes to take revenge on the first film's Mother Superior character. Ricky is set into murderous rages by the color red...you know that color, you probably go days on end without ever seeing it. I would hate to see Ricky's reaction at a four way stop intersection.
Ricky dresses like Santa, and begins hacking and killing. In the end, two bullets and a shotgun blast send him through a plate glass window, but he seems to survive, appearing in the next sequel. Just as awful as the first, and just as repugnant.
This is rated (R) for strong physical violence, strong gun violence, some sexual violence, gore, strong profanity, female nudity, sexual content, and some sexual references.",1023148800,2,1447,4.67843137254902

210730,1,6300165760,"Confined in a mental hospital, Ricky - driven by the horrible memory of his parent's death and forced to relive the violent actions of his brother - explodes in a frenzy of murder and mayhem.
Don't let my synopsis fool you. This movie was only about flashbacks. Most of them were from the first SILENT NIGHT, DEADLY NIGHT, and the rest were Ricky's flashbacks that had nothing to do with Christmas. The only part of the film that had something to do with Christmas was the ending, when Ricky broke out of the mental hospital.
Sure this movie was like two sequels in one, but were we warned that there was? No. If I knew this film was only about flashbacks from the first one, I may have rented it on a two-for-one night. This sequel could have been like the FRIDAY THE 13TH films. What I mean is, in the first FRIDAY THE 13TH, Jason's mother was the killer. In the first SILENT NIGHT, DEADLY NIGHT, Ricky's brother was the killer. Unlike FRIDAY THE 13TH, the makers of SILENT NIGHT, DEADLY NIGHT messed up their series horribly. They only needed at least five minutes of flashbacks for their sequel.
Eventhough this movie was boring, there are some funny scenes. The scene in the movie theatre was quite funny. And as if we didn't see enough flashbacks, the movie being played in the theatre was SILENT NIGHT, DEADLY NIGHT.
If you want to see a good horror movie that has something to do with Christmas, then check out the first SILENT NIGHT, DEADLY NIGHT or BLACK CHRISTMAS.

7803382,1,6300165760,"Absolutely hilarious in a ""did these people actually watch this when they declared it complete"" kind of way. With worse acting than Troll 2, a plot so derivative that half its run time is footage from the original, a series of gratuitous rape scenes and buckets of bloodshed, this is precisely the kind of movie I'd have been looking for at 3AM on Cinemax during my adolescence. Lead actor Eric Freeman utters nothing but awful catchphrases from start to finish, delivered with the kind of wild-eyed sincerity that left me wondering how blurry the line between fact and fiction really was for the filmmakers. In comparison to Freeman's scene-stealing ineptitude, the rest of the cast fades helplessly into the wallpaper - and that's probably for the best. What this ultimately boils down to is about fifteen minutes of uproariously funny bad cinema, padded to a ninety minute ultimate runtime with ruthless disregard for relevance or entertainment value. Needs to be trimmed down to a highlight reel before it's truly watchable.",1315699200,,1028,5.052941176470588

The first half of the movie is just flashbacks of the original. Ricky Caldwell is the insane brother of the killer from the 1st movie. Ricky gets a lot of facts wrong, he has crazy eyebrows, and of course that awesome 'Garbage Day' line. On Christmas Eve, Ricky tells a psychiatrist his life story about how he was adopted, killed naughty people throughout his life, and fell in love with a woman named Jennifer.

7803384,5,6300165760,"I ordered this movie after seeing the famous ""garbage day"" video on youtube. I watched the movie and thought, this is actually pretty good for it's time. Unlike the other slasher movies of the 80's, this one had an original story that actually made sense. I won't ruin it for you though, and it's hard to tell the story without ruining it for those who want to see it. There are some repetitive parts, and the acting is a little over the top especially by Eric Freeman who plays the main character, but then again his performance is enjoyable and comical to watch. I wish he was in more movies or TV. My only complaint is that this should have been the first movie of the silent night series (and the only, 3-5 suck). If you've seen the first one, the second one will be of no interest because nearly all of the second movie is a recap of the first. With that said, you don't need to see the first to enjoy the second. Also, I won't give away the ending, but I'll just say it's rather inconclusive. I still highly enjoyed this movie, and it is a must have in anybody's collection. It's a brilliant idea with attention capturing performance that is completely under rated. It should be a Christmas Special.",1265414400,,1205,4.408071748878924
7803385,2,6300165760,"In a world that's filled with Z-grade, bottom-rung movies Silent Night, Deadly Night Part 2 is one of the most fascinating. I heard of it only because of the legendary ""Garbage Day!"" youtube meme and I went ahead and watched the first one. I didn't particularly like it and found many scenes hilarious due to poor acting and idiotic dialogue, but all the bad from that movie truly can not hold a candle to how atrocious everything in this movie is. Oddly enough, while this movie by no means falls into the so-bad-it's-good category of movies; it's so horrible, I actually enjoyed watching it more than the first one.

The plot is essentially the entire first movie with new scenes to actually make this film it's own movie. While the scenes are slightly abridged you will feel like you just watched the first movie.

Eric Freeman plays Ricky, the deranged brother of the equally deranged Billy from the first movie. Ricky is incarcerated and as the movie opens he (attempts to) stare(s) menacingly into the camera. Freeman is incapable of looking natural while doing something and even holding a cigarette seems like a challenge. A psychiatrist named Bloom interviews Ricky about his view of the events leading up to his incarceration, including the events of the first movie, of course and his first meeting/courtship with Jennifer (Elizabeth Cayton).

Is a plot description necessary? No, not at all, but I thought I'd fill you in. As the film is essentially one long flashback, it seems pointless to even mention the hilarious attempt at continuity, specifically when Ricky narrates events he couldn't know about. And the plotting is ridiculous (obviously) such as a scene where Ricky and Jennifer go to see a movie...Which ends up being the first movie.

The dialogue in this movie is beyond any definition of idiotic. It's so poor, in fact, I had trouble believing it could be made worse by it's delivery...But it is. Besides ""garbage day"" and Jennifer's line to an ex-boyfriend (""...you cheated on me, you ruined my best sweater), there's also this Oscar-worthy exchange:

Mother Superior-""You're being naughty!""

Ricky-""Naughty this!""

Finally, Ricky's walk through suburbia (where the ""garbage day"" scene occurs) is one of the funniest, most poorly executed sequences committed to celluloid. Even worse is that we're to assume the filmmakers intended to frighten the audience.

Is there anything good about this movie? No, not technically. However, I found Cayton gorgeous and there is an Oscar-worthy uncredited performance in this movie...Eric Freeman's eyebrows. You'll know what I mean moments after this movie begins. They're absolutely fascinating.

This is a hard movie critique, because quite frankly it's one of the worst films ever made. This movie features the very definition of bad acting, bad writing, and bad filmmaking. However, if you're bored and have 88 minutes to waste you'll likely be entertained as it is entertaining because of how bad it is. So, I give it 2 stars because it really can't be awarded 3 and a 1-star rating simply brands it unwatchable.",1252281600,,3084,5.043222003929273
7803386,2,6300165760,"Well, if you've seen the first one, don't waste your time here, it's pretty much all the footage from the first one with about 20 minutes of horrible new stuff edited in with it.

7803388,1,6300165760,"My, god, what is with these people? I am shocked and appalled that this film got so many good reviews. I counted almost half a dozen five star reviews on the first page alone, and it averages at around 3. What have you people been smoking, and why aren't you sharing it?

The acting in this thing is putrid, especially on the part of Eric Freeman, who plays the kid brother of Billy from the first film. His acting  was so horrible I had to get up in the middle of the film and go into the bathroom to empty my bowels, because I had an attack of diarrhea. He doesn't look like he's acting at all, really. It looks more like he's trying to pass a gall stone. I'm an actor, myself. So, I think I have the right to say that I wouldn't spare this kid a drop of piss if he was on fire.

In this film we reunite with Ricky (Eric Freeman), Billy's little brother. He has apparently been incarcerated in a state mental hospital for killing a bunch of people. In the first scenes, and in a collection of tiresome flashbacks from the first film, Ricky reveals to a prison Psychiatrist why he did the things he did. He tells the story of his parents murder, and his older brother's subsequent nervous breakdown, as an adult. If you are already fed up with Ricky's whining, and long for the original film, don't you worry. They show clips from it for almost two thirds of this one. When finally we see what Ricky, himself, got into trouble for, we are treated to a number of lame scenes in which he runs amok with a pistol and kills several people in a quiet neighborhood. No axe for Ricky. Oh, no! That would be too sensational. No, just a good old .357 magnum. Not quite like Dirty Harry, but close enough.

As you may have guessed, Ricky eventually escapes from the mental hospital, and goes after Mother Superior from the first film. (I think it's a different actress, but I couldn't tell, her makeup was too thick.) You can probably predict what happens next, but I make it a rule not to blow the ending of any movie, even when the film deserves it. Suffice to say that Ricky dons his own Santa Claus outfit, the way his brother did in the first movie, when he takes care of business

So, there you have it. That's Silent Night, Deadly Night Part 2. In my humble opinion they took a good idea and wasted it. It was overkill. I think it would have been way cooler if they had just had the original actor from the first film come back as a zombie Santa Claus to continue on his original path of destruction. That would have been much easier to take than this miserable product.",1096243200,,2568,4.275720164609053
7803389,5,6300165760,"I completely agree with Derek below. Most people don't like this film because they were expecting a horror film.  But if you look at it a little differently, get ready cause you're in for a treat. Forget Plan 9 From Outer Space, Robot Monster, etc. This is the true champ of ""so bad it's good."" I haven't laugh so hard in a long time. In fact, there were tears in my eyes from laughter at certain points. And the funny thing this wasn't even a comedy.
Where to begin? Let's start with Eric Freeman who's in the leading role of Ricky. To say he's overacting isn't enough. Words cannot describe it. Just watch any scene where he's talking to the psycharist and try to keep a straight face.  While you try, look for the boom microphone making an appearance above his head.
Speaking of which, Ricky's session contists of half and hour of footage from the original film.  His older brother, Billy was the killer in that film. Somehow, he manages to know what his brother did even though he wasn't present to witness a good chunk of this(in some cases, no surviving witnesses to tell the story). Silly as this sounds, this is only the beginning.
In Ricky's story, I learned a few details:
  -You can run over a guy with a truck backwards and forward and get thanked by his girlfriend.  The guy's crime was that he was a little too sexually aggressive with her. Nothing like a little roadkill to settle the score.
 -You can take an umbrella and impale someone with it and yet the umbrella will be able to open.
-Somehow your girlfriend will just say, ""I hate you, go away"" right after you've fed her ex-boyfriend some battery electricity.
-Cops will still set up a road block when the killer is travelling by foot.
There's more I could go on about, but let me not spoil it for you. Just grab a few friends and a few beers and watch.  One last thing, to everyone who's seen that film, I wish you a happy GARBAGE DAY!",1056153600,10,1908,4.400568181818182
7803390,5,6300165760,For you people who disliked this movie I think you are taking it too seriously.  About once a year my friends and I watch this movie and we laugh through the whole thing.  We fast forword the slow parts mostly parts from the original just so we can get to the parts with Ricky.  Nothing beats Freeman's performance.  Just from seeing that sick grin on his face makes us laugh.  The highlights are the movie theatre scene and when he goes on his other killing rampages.  You can even notice the film crew in the background when he is on the street.  I also like the scenes where he is in the institution and the dialogue with the pyscologist goes unsurpassed.  Also It is funny in the sledding scene where we have two highschool age guys cheering with glee as their sleding down the hill like their in kindergarden.  And thats just a little bit of it. This is one of my alltime favorites and I recomend it to anybody who enjoys cheesy 80's horror/comedies.  And for those who didn't like it I think you need to watch it with some friends and make fun of it with them and then you will enjoy it more.,1052870400,2,1098,4.286407766990291
