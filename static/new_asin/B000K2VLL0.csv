8154066,4,B000K2VLL0,"The first thing I should point out is that this is in fact region 0 meaning you can play it on regular DVD players in North America and presumably anywhere else in world, so don't let the description of PAL format put you off.

This is probably something that is only of interest to anyone who is/was a fan of MMEB. It contains a good variety of material from their early days through to much more recent songs, and it is interesting to see how the band members have changed over the years, especially Mick Rogers who was in the original lineup with Manfred and is I believe still in the group today. The picture quality is understandably poor for the older songs but the sound is not bad throughout.

There are no extras on the DVD itself but there is an informative booklet which is enclosed with the DVD, giving information about the background to each song and the band members who perform it. It is good to have the opportunity now to see this archive footage put together, something I did not expect and I am happy I stumbled across this item and made the purchase.

If you want to see more reviews, check out the UK Amazon site where the band has had more of an audience.",1415664000,3,1178,4.345454545454546
