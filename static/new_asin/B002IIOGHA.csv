8370975,1,B002IIOGHA,".... I will buy this Film when it has English subtitles..... I don't understand Tagalog.  sorry.  I am interested in seeing the movie, but I want to know what is going on (audibly).",1350172800,,181,4.454545454545454
8370976,4,B002IIOGHA,"""Binyag"" means Baptism - according to my Tagalog-English dictionary.  Why do I have to look it up?  Because this film, a lot like many other Filipino Gay movies, tend to forget that many of us don't speak Tagolog.  So, again, I have to give this review on a viewing-only basis.  The cover and back of this DVD has English discription for the movie but NO ENGLISH SUBTITLES are available.  Ebony Productions should make subtitles for future DVDs.  Storyline seems a bit slow and dragging - but the beauty of the main character and the beaches are breathtaking.  The female character in this movie seems to be out-of-place and quite frankly - not necessary.  3 stars for the guy and beach scenery (which they could have shown more of), while 1 star for the plot.  Also this DVD has a nice Photo-gallery as a Special Feature.",1249171200,5,822,4.613793103448276
