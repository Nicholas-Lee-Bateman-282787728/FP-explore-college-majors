1880922,4,B000096IBH,"From day to day my feelings about this movie change from 4 to 3 stars because the problems I have bother me more when I focus on them.  When I only focus on the positives I come to the 4 star conclusion.  So, this was Charlie's first talkie and it's his most commercially successful film.  You can tell right from the beginning that his silent style physical characterizations have held over and don't exactly gel smoothly.  Somehow, he's still able to put together brilliant pieces and performances that make up for the awkwardness.  The film isn't really weighty at all until the final monologue. There's a lot of comedy variety here and my personal favorite moments are the scenes Chaplin shares with Reginald Gardiner as Schultz.  There's an overload of silliness in the interactions they have that they're able to expertly play relatively straight and it makes them brilliantly funny.  I don't think there are better comic scenes like this in the history of talkies, or otherwise.  Other than that, I love the genteel way Chaplin handles dancing with a very brusque femme in the Italian dictator's wife.  Neither of them knows how to deal with what has just taken place, but he's polite anyway and leaves promptly. Comedy-wise you can't go wrong if you enjoy film comedy, or vaudeville style.  This film is a goldmine, if uneven.

The speech at the end is the reason a lot of people talk about this film nowadays and it's a shame, in my opinion.  The speech doesn't really belong in a film that only partially commits to being a satire of real life events.  Even Chaplin admits he wouldn't have even made the movie if he knew the realities of what the Germans were doing in the war. I find that hard to believe based on how cultured he was, but that's neither here no there.  The point of the movie is to show the folly of war and conquer structure through absurd comedic means and to demean advancements in war technology because it separates us from the reality of the carnage.  All of this was more than shown through the comedic storyline and bits.

A heavy handed and humorless speech at the end isn't welcome in a film that is expert in one thing.  It's a massive bait and switch at the end.  Beyond that, it doesn't matter how well written the speech is if it doesn't work with the rest of the film. People ignore this because they agree with the sentiments.  I'm not a member of the sheep who subscribe to that idea. A film needs to be consistent with what the aims and strengths it possesses and serious political moralizing isn't the strength of this film. The strength is ridicule that proves to be both relevant and irrelevant to the satire. No one is perfect, but I would seriously consider ever watching another Chaplin film if I were around in that time. As I can watch it on video, I can choose to skip it.  I would suggest everyone else to do the same after first viewing  if you enjoy comedy over overt political statement.

I recognize Chaplin and I are separated by significant cultural differences in the time periods and I give him the benefit of the doubt as an artistic genius, but a politically relevant commenter he is not.",1502323200,,3154,4.564831261101244

1880925,5,B000096IBH,"i've never doubted or disputed that Charlie Chaplin was brilliant bordering on genius. i've just never revered him quite as i do The Marx Brothers or Monty Python, or even necessarily The Three Stooges.
the reason for this, which i confess may not be quite fair, is that i've never managed to ""click"" with silent cinema. i'm at a particular loss to seen the appeal of silent comedy. as far as i can tell, it always seems to boil down to the same basic punchline, namely really frenetic music making the world run at about 20 times it's normal speed.
but i hasten to add that his considerable talent was always perceptible, and this film more than confirms my suspicion that if he'd worked exclusively in the sound era, he might very well measure up to those comedians i most idolize. (additions to the aforementioned include Jack Benny, Abbott & Costello, Red Skelton, Mel Brooks, Steve Martin, and '70s-era George Carlin.)
as if just to bear me out, The Great Dictator was the single biggest moneymaker of Chaplin's career, and has been called his masterpiece more than once.
it's also his most controversial work. you can still tell that it's one of the ballsiest films ever made, but curiously, not all the reasons it was such a gamble remain readily apparent. the major obstacle Chaplin faced is that it came along a few years before any hostilities were officially addressed, before America had even considered getting into the war. there were stories of what the Nazis were up to, but they tended to be sketchy at best. Chaplin, among others who were uneasy about Hitler, was up against a consensus of opinion that, however tragic, it was ultimately none of our damn business. and because Hollywood's major studios at the time had a standing policy of not ""rocking the boat"" when it came to political issues, Chaplin was left to produce the film independently.
ironically, it was felt that Chaplin was entitled to a more modest potshot at Der Fuhrer. for as long as people had known who Hitler was there had been jokes about his appropriating Charlie Chaplin's trademark mustache. ultimately, of course, this is about as scandalous as the baby-boomers swearing off haircuts after falling under the spell of The Beatles. even so, there was actually a time when, as far as many could tell, it was the extent of Hitler's tyranny. Hitler was actually a legitimate celebrity for at least a decade before it became all too clear that 'stache plagiarism was the least of his atrocities. now there's a twist ending worthy of O. Henry.
the plot is a variation on The Prince & The Pauper. the former is represented by ""Adenoid Hynkel,"" a Mad Magazine-esque caricature of you-know-who. the latter is represented by, in his last cinematic bow, Chaplin's iconic Little Tramp. he'd long known well that his signature role's formula wouldn't have the same magic in a ""talkie,"" but nonetheless felt compelled to pay homage to the character to whom he owed his career. so Chaplin gradually develops his hapless barber hero from the familiar mute version to a character more readily compatible with what cinema had become. it's a seemingly natural progression, enabling the beloved character to go out with the proverbial bang.
as for the Dictator, Chaplin's masterstroke is to reduce him to a delusional, petulant spoiled brat. in fact, this ""spiritual leader"" is such a temperamental, volatile figurehead that one wonders how such a doofus manages to get into office in the first place, let alone hold the nation together when he he gets there. this actually semi-dovetails with something that's always puzzled me about Hitler. did he really, as the story goes, sway Germany on rhetoric alone? seriously, how could someone basically scream at the audience the way he did and come off as anything but a delusional lunatic?
alas, success in both the artistic and the financial senses of the word couldn't save the film from a certain stigma. at best, some called it mere gossip, an overreaction to to a story of which we'd only heard a part. at worst, there were already no few Nazi supporters in the States, who came out of the woodwork to picket the film and accuse Chaplin of misinterpreting if not slandering a distinguished elder statesman. it remained divided enough an issue to, two years later, similarly plague Ernst Lubitch's similarly themed To Be Or Not To Be. (although granted, that film's failure had more to do with star Carole Lombard's untimely death than any political rhetoric.) the truth would out, but not just yet.
tragically, Chaplin himself came to have regrets about the film. he later said that, while it was certainly enough to outrage and frighten him, he had only a layman's understanding of the situation. if he'd had fuller knowledge, particularly of what went on in the concentration camps, he probably wouldn't of bothered. at the very least the film wouldn't of been a comedy.
it's frankly depressing to think that outside influences could bring about such misgivings for creating about such a masterpiece. but at least they were too late to prevent Chaplin's assault on Hitler. we need laughter, particularly when confronted with what someone claims is no laughing matter. and indeed, since that was Chaplin's forte, that's how he should approach the matter. Hitler could supplant basic human rights, but he couldn't defend himself from ridicule.
it's interesting to note that a few months before, The Three Stooges had launched their own assault on Hitler in what is sometimes called their own finest hour, You Nazty Spy! Moe Howard, who frequently cited this as his personal favorite Stooges episode, launches just as merciless a caricature, and due to the act's slapstick nature, resulted in an even more chaotic cluelessness on the part of their version of a despot. so well received was it, in fact, that by the end of the year there would be a sequel, I'll Never Heil Again! this may not prove much else, but is a reassurance that Chaplin wasn't a lone voice in the wilderness. others were on the same page.
and of course, when the truth finally did ""out,"" Der would-be Fuhrer's legacy had such staying power that nearly 30 years later, Mel Brooks could take some of the piss out of his with The Producers...and again when he converted it to a Broadway musical 30 years after that!
today, when we can't so easily hide from the truth, the film has a new Achilles heel in a certain maudlin quality. most obviously, the ersatz Fuhrer's final speech. the inevitable switcheroo has taken place: the Dictator is detains by his own authorities, and the barber, masquerading as his doppleganger, finds himself having to address the nation and/or world his his place. here Chaplin finally gets to his central point: doesn't Germany realize what a psychotic lunatic they've handed the reins to? isn't it obvious he can't be trusted? why are we listening to this ogre when we should be pooling our efforts to topple his regime?
by slipping so abruptly out of character to deliver a Roosevelt-esque ""fireside chat,"" some have argued, he goes from an everyman underdog to a preacher.
second most obviously, Paulette Goddard's character, serving chiefly as an idealist beacon of hope, has a certain Little Mary Sunshine quality which, according to some, is rather out of place.
you could also argue that it provides a misleadingly pat solution in it's implication that this one speech is all it takes to make the land of Tomainina come to their senses and throw off the shackles.
these naysayers are half right. such, frankly, sap would absolutely be detrimental to a simple comedy for comedy's sake like, say, Austin Powers or The Naked Gun. The Great Dictator, however, is aiming much deeper. (it certainly wouldn't be the only Chaplin production to make such use of the human element.) the film can't make it's point without acknowledging that it's target is a colossal cataclysm who tends to have less than rosy effects on the people in his wake. Chaplin had a serious message lurking within his humor.
in any case, serious or comedic, what's even the point of making such a film if you're not gonna take a stand?",1496793600,,8133,4.860230547550432

There are deeper moments, nuances, like in all Chaplin films. The final speech is brilliant with its message, but watch closely. It's not just the words, it's the subtle expressions on Chaplin's and Goddard's faces that give power to the words. (Amazon: you should add Goddard to ""starring"".)

1880942,5,B000096IBH,"Ridicule and satire have always been some of the most potent psychological weapons against authoritarianism.  Authoritarian leaders have no sense of humor.  Have you noticed that ""the donald"" never laughs?  Churchill understood the power of satire - he routinely referred to Hitler as ""Herr Schicklgruber"", calling Hitler by his true family name, i.e. the surname of his paternal grandmother because his father had been born out of wedlock. Volker Ullrich, author of the latest biography of Hitler, notes that a salute of ""Heil Schicklgruber"" would have elicited nothing but laughter. So it is sobering to consider that history was so devastatingly transformed because a brother of Hitler's father's stepfather changed the family surname to ""Hiedler"" and Hitler's father's birth status to ""legitimate"" simply to shield his estate from inheritance taxes (permutations in spelling sent ""Hiedler"" to ""Hitler"").  When we contemplate the change of ""the donald's"" family name from ""Strumpf"" to ""Trump"" we see a similar historic catastrophe with the transformation of an inelegant name into a global brand name that made billions for the Trump family and provided the springboard for propelling ""the donald"" into the White House.  Charlie Chaplin understood better than anyone the role that ridicule and satire could play in bearing witness to  these historic calamities and getting under the thin skin of authoritarian and demagogic leaders, and he aimed The Great Dictator at Hitler, the nemesis for his times.  We can only hope that similar artistic geniuses will direct their arts against the growing demagogic and neo-facist threats to our times:  i.e. ""the donald"" and aspiring nationalist-populist leaders of other Western nations.",1482883200,,1731,5.481203007518797

I just had a preconceived notion of what his films are like but to my great surprise I've discovered what wonderful films he has made.  The first Chaplin film I was introduced to was ""City lights"".  How he can carry a film with no dialogue is amazing.  I was thoroughly entertained throughout the entire film.  This film was very enjoyable as well...especially the water bottle scene while the airplane is flying upside down is very creative and silly (in a good way).  Shaving scene with Hungarian dance No. 5 and the world globe scenes are just too creative!

1880997,5,B000096IBH,"Let me make clear at the outset that I'm reviewing the Criterion Collection DVD set. Why call it a set? Because it includes two discs and a booklet, and these extras truly enhance viewing the film. I'll refer to the 27 page booklet and the extras on the second disc in the course of this brief review, but what they do is drop the viewer (and reader) into the environment in which the film was made, appeared, and was viewed and discussed. One reason I think silent movies are so often underrated is due to the lack of a suitable environment to view them in, a sense of the milieu in which they appeared, and the erroneously but widely held view that everything newer must be better, what C.S. Lewis called ""chronological snobbery"".
The extras in this set enabled me to avoid all that, and I am coming to question this uncritical worship of ""progress"" greatly as I see, for instance, old RKO pictures in which the dancing, acrobatics, music, set design, stunts, and least of all acting far surpass anything in movies nowadays. If that dates me, so be it. To the notion that new is better, especially as regards films, I give the raspberry.
The silent or near silent bits in this film are masterstrokes, as funny in their way as the house scene in Buster Keaton's ""One Week"". They could be pulled out and shown as short films. Arguably it's an open question how much comedy can be made of tragedy, but this film gives a resounding answer. It skirts very decently the political and social uncertainty of the times. Then, like now, it seems only bullies were in power. They could not know that once Germany was out of the scene, Russia was waiting in the wings, or that this was only the beginning of the mass slaughter to come in the ages when man counted for nothing.
Instead, Chaplin goes right to the human question. ""I believe in God"" asserts the heroine. One need not say that this was not the thing to say to help a film along. But it is the underpinning of the final speech, which at the time so many found shocking, dropping as it does any pretense of political support for the warring parties, and stressing the reality that springs from that statement, of the intrinsic worth of Gentile, Jew, black man and white man, as it's put in a particularly telling phrase. The film answers the question, could anything about ""talkies"" improve on silent films, could anything be said that could improve on silence, and here brilliantly answers 'yes'.
For the rest, it really is a silent movie, and a very good one, full of enjoyable visual bits. It may stand as the template for all the mistaken identity films to come, whether in the Three Stooges, Laurel and Hardy, or Bugs Bunny. And, since cartoons took their cues from live action shorts, and played off accompanying movies, the barbershop bits are not so different from ""Rabbit of Seville"".
That said, it is notable that while Chaplin invented names for two warring countries, he did not disguise the name ""Juden"", a very real people in a very real way being made scapegoats at one of the darkest times of the world. Hollywood was at the time straining at the bit, waiting for the U.S. to declare war, to unleash their artistic batteries in outpourings of talent and patriotism that would result in some of the most popular movies and musicals ever made. But Chaplin fired the shot across the bow. The film ends not in any assurance of final victory, but with what Chaplin and comics have always brought us, a common man proclaiming the common things, which somehow outlast all the uncommon and outlandish attacks on them, and the heroine who looks forward hopefully to an unseen future. Not for nothing does the film end with the instrumental notes of a final Amen.",1445212800,,3720,4.595488721804511

Even brother Chaplin, Sidney was totally against the production of the film ""the Great dictator"". But Hallelujah Chaplin for his commitment and perseverance, for it is the steadfast determination to make this movie. And now we can enjoy this amazing cinema. In the film's satire is closely intertwined with the drama. Chaplin selflessly makes fun of fascism and the two dictators of the early 20th century. The culmination of the film is his final speech.

I would have enjoyed this film, if ONLY it would have been playable.  But it wasn't.

The disc arrived and due to two deaths in the family that happened right after it arrived, I was not able to try to play it for several weeks thereafter.

When I was finally able to put it in my nearly brand new Sony Blu-ray player, all that would display was the Criterion Collection logo.  No menu screen, no response to hitting any buttons on either the player or the remote. Nothing.

I figured that the specific disc that I received had a sample defect, so I ordered another one.  The second one arrived a few days later.  Same problem.  Lovely logo, I must say.

I returned both of them but received a refund for only one of the two that I returned. They would not refund the first one because it was more than 30 days after I received it, and they disclaimed returns after 30 days.

Not only did I not get to see this otherwise terrific Charlie Chaplin film, I had to pay for a disc that wouldn't play and could not get a refund.  They still have my money and I have nothing.  I don't even have the unplayable disc.

If they weren't going to refund that, then they should have sent it back to me. Then at least I could have put it on the Christmas tree.  ON the tree, not under it:  as an ornament, mind you, not as a gift.

So after all of that I was more than slightly amused when I received an e-mail today inviting my review of their wonderful product.  So my wife said, ""Fine. Let 'em have it!""

I expect more from The Criterion Collection.  I have been a big fan of Criterion since its earliest days but this experience was terrible.

This totally sucked.

By the way, the problem was definitely not with my Sony Blu-Ray player.  Every other disc that I have played in that before or since has worked just fine. The problem was the disc, and it is not simply a sample defect, since the same problem happened with both discs that were sent to me.

Don't by this unless you can return it within 30 days of shipment.  Hopefully your inevitable return of this unplayable disc  won't get delayed by any deaths in your family.",1418428800,,2265,4.243559718969555
1881043,5,B000096IBH,"The Great Dictator is a comedy film by Charlie Chaplin. Like most Chaplin films, he wrote, produced, and directed, in addition to starring as the lead. Having been the only Hollywood film maker to continue to make silent films well into the period of sound films, this was Chaplin's first true talking picture as well as his most commercially successful film. More importantly, it was the first major feature film to bitterly satirize Nazism and Adolf Hitler.

With this pithy opening title, Chaplin begins his first all-talking feature film, The Great Dictator. During World War I, a Jewish barber in the army of Tomania saves the life of high-ranking officer Schultz. While Schultz survives the conflict unscathed, the barber is stricken with amnesia and bundled off to a hospital. Twenty years pass: Tomania has been taken over by dictator Adenoid Hynkel and his stooges Garbitsch and Herring. Hynkel despises all Jews and regularly wreaks havoc on the Tomanian Jewish ghetto, where feisty Hannah lives. Meanwhile, the little barber escapes from the hospital and instinctively heads back to his cobweb-laden ghetto barber shop. Unaware of Hynkel's policy towards Jews (in fact, he's unaware of Hynkel), the barber gets into a slapstick confrontation with a gang of Aryan storm troopers. He is rescued by his old friend Schultz, now one of Hynkel's most loyal officers. Thanks to Schultz's protection, the ghetto receives a brief respite from Hynkel's persecution. The barber sets up shop again, developing a warm platonic relationship with the lovely Hannah. But things take a sorry turn when Hynkel, angered that a Jewish banker has refused to finance his impending war with Austerlitz, begins bearing down again on the Ghetto. Near the end of the film, when the dictator is expected to make another one of his hate-filled, war-mongering speeches, the barber steps up to the microphones...and Charles Chaplin drops character and becomes ""himself,"" delivering an impassioned plea for peace, tolerance, and humanity.

Like all major Chaplin works, The Great Dictator was a cheaply, but methodically, made film, a cardboard act of humanist defiance, and, thanks to its purity of purpose, the cheesier the jokes get, the harder they land. Aside from that,The first full-blown talkie from the biggest star of the silent era, complete with a message that he couldn't have sent more loudly or clearly. Finally,the film hasn't aged well, but in 1940 it was perceived to be original, bold and controversial due to its combination of slapstick satire of the German dictator. It is one of the best films ever made in cinema history.",1418342400,,2625,5.14519906323185

1881045,5,B000096IBH,"How ironic that maybe the greatest speech in the history of movies was given by the very actor who was renowned for silent movies. How ironic that the 2 dictators parodied in this movie very likely watched this movie. How ironic that Charlie's speech mentioned the aeroplane and radio as great tools to unite people,while little did he know that the internet could be an even greater tool to unite people,and with this very speech itself being a great tool to unite people when shared over the internet!

I found the entire movie entertaining,but in my view the speech alone makes it merit a 5 star rating. Here is the text of the speech:

""I'm sorry, but I don't want to be an emperor. That's not my business. I don't want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone - if possible - Jew, Gentile - black man - white. We all want to help one another. Human beings are like that. We want to live by each other's happiness - not by each other's misery. We don't want to hate and despise one another. In this world there is room for everyone. And the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way.

Greed has poisoned men's souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical. Our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery we need humanity. More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost....

The aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together. The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men - cries out for universal brotherhood - for the unity of us all. Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world - millions of despairing men, women, and little children - victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people.

To those who can hear me, I say - do not despair. The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed - the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people. And so long as men die, liberty will never perish. .....

Soldiers! don't give yourselves to brutes - men who despise you - enslave you - who regiment your lives - tell you what to do - what to think and what to feel! Who drill you - diet you - treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder. Don't give yourselves to these unnatural men - machine men with machine minds and machine hearts! You are not machines! You are not cattle! You are men! You have the love of humanity in your hearts! You don't hate! Only the unloved hate - the unloved and the unnatural! Soldiers! Don't fight for slavery! Fight for liberty!

In the 17th Chapter of St Luke it is written: ""the Kingdom of God is within man"" - not one man nor a group of men, but in all men! In you! You, the people have the power - the power to create machines. The power to create happiness! You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure.

Then - in the name of democracy - let us use that power - let us all unite. Let us fight for a new world - a decent world that will give men a chance to work - that will give youth a future and old age a security. By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power. But they lie! They do not fulfill that promise. They never will!

Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people! Now let us fight to fulfill that promise! Let us fight to free the world - to do away with national barriers - to do away with greed, with hate and intolerance. Let us fight for a world of reason, a world where science and progress will lead to all men's happiness. Soldiers! in the name of democracy, let us all unite!""

Well said,Charlie. I would like to end this review with one of my favorite quotes from John Dalberg-Acton:

""Power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely.""

1881049,5,B000096IBH,"Charlie Chaplin, in his classic comedy released on the eve of World War II, is a biting satire of Hitler and the Nazi Party. Chaplin plays dual roles, Adenoid Hynkel, the dictator of Tomania, and assumes his trademark ""little tramp"" character, an unnamed Jewish Barber who is released from a soldier's hospital after suffering from amnesia in WW I and returns to his shop in a Jewish ghetto. The movie pretty much follows the broad themes of 1930s Germany including spoofing Herman Goring and Joseph Goebbels -- Field Marshal Herring and Herr Garbitsch in the movie, the crackdown on Jewish individuals and businesses, and the alliance with Benito Mussolini - Bacteria's dictator called Benzino Napaloni, and the invasion of Austria.

There are several memorable scenes in the film including Hynkel's speaking before a throng in a gibberish-like parody of German, ""translated"" at humorously obvious parts in the speech by an overly concise English-speaking news voice-over. In one scene we see Hynkel dancing with a helium filled globe. There are numerous scenes with Napaloni, his inner circle, and between the Barber and the regime's Storm Troopers that are pure slapstick and could have been lifted from a Three Stooges movie.

The end is noted for its obvious political overtones. Hynkel, for some reason goes on a duck-hunting trip, falls overboard and is mistaken for the Barber and is arrested by his own soldiers. The Barber, who escapes from a concentration camp absent mindedly assumes Hynkel's identity and is taken to make a victory speech. Garbitsch, in introducing ""Hynkel"" to the throngs, decries free speech and argues for the subjugation of the Jews. The Barber then makes a rousing speech, reversing Hynkel's antisemitic policies and declaring that Tomainia will now be a free nation and a democracy. He calls for humanity in general to break free from dictatorships and use science and progress to make the world better instead. It is up to the viewer to determine if Chaplin meant this as an indictment against the Fascist nations or if he was including a broader charge against capitalism as well.",1413676800,,2118,5.083333333333333

The biggest shock to me was the fact it was not a Chaplin silent movie (something I had assumed would be) and despite Chaplin's reluctance to become part of the talkies, it totally works in this film!
The plot is wonderful and with such a serious subject of Hitler and his war, especially against the Jews, I was curious to see how Chaplin would overcome this with his brand of comedy.
He did a marvelous job with a sensitive subject with the ""good will overcome evil"" applied philosophy to the plot. The choice of actors was perfect and the filming was beautifully executed. His solo dance with the globe in his office is absolute magic!
This film is a significant piece of work of Chaplin's and his unique artistry is something that I truly miss in today's movies.

1881060,3,B000096IBH,"This movie was made in 1940 and detailed what Hitler had done up to that point...just before far worse was about to happen.  Jews were subject to persecution and abuse, ""Hynkel"" was shown as treacherous to the nations and world leaders (including Mussolini) around him, and his ambitions were laid bare.

The story is told in both pantomime and conventional acting sequences.  A Jewish barber and ""Hynkel"" look-alike is a soldier wounded in World War One who ends up being hospitalized for decades and is released just as Hynkel is coming to power.  Of course, there is little the barber can do against Hynkel's thugs, though he ends up somehow being able to impersonate Hynkel and fooling people.

Chaplin was a great pantomime performer, but a very poor conventional actor, and of course the pantomime sequences (the barber as a soldier trying to deal with a dangerous bomb, the train not being able to stop at the platform, Hynkel treating a globe as a beach ball) were the best parts of the movie.

1881062,5,B000096IBH,"THE GREAT DICTATOR is a cinematic masterpiece with equal doses of vaudevillian humor and poignant drama. It is the story of Adenoid Hynkel and a Jewish barber. One aspires to take over the world, while the other just wants to live his life free of oppression. It is to Charlie Chaplin's credit that this film is able to speak to the human heart in such a moving way, which is what it's all about. Charlie Chaplin gives two excellent performances as the dictator, Adenoid Hynkel, and a Jewish barber. Both roles give him an opportunity to display the physical comedy which he was already so famous for. He also gets a lot of laughs by ranting in pseudo-German. The rest of the cast also do well in their roles, particularly the actor who played Benzino Napaloni (a parody of Mussolini). There was also some great cinematography and set design. The only minor thing I felt was wrong was the opening sequence, which I felt dragged on a little too long. Still, it was a nice throwback to Chaplin's previous silent movies and had some nice sight gags (really, there was quite a number of hilarious sight gags throughout). Overall, this should be seen by any self-respecting movie-lover, if only for the impassioned speech at the end, which ranks as one of the greatest movie speeches I've ever witnessed.",1403308800,,1299,4.701754385964913

1881070,5,B000096IBH,"A few years ago I completely binged on all things Charlie Chaplin.  I literally watched about twenty of his films in a week and I remember quite distinctly the night I watched The Great Dictator because it was the night that my wife went into labor and so it ended my marathon of Chaplin films.  I had other things to occupy my time for a while.  I remember this film for many other reasons as well, obviously, but that is the first thing I think about when people mention this movie.

Chaplins first real talkie, The Great Dictator is an astute and powerful political satire wrapped up in Chaplins iconic comedic style.  It is also one of the best films of the 40s.  Taking on the reprehensible Hitler, Chaplin paves the way for greats like Alec Guinness and Peter Sellers by taking on two distinct characters with their own identities and their own storylines.  Playing both an innocent Jewish barber and the sadistic dictator he is mistaken for, Chaplins remarkable look at the political state of the times is as poignant today as it was then.

1881074,4,B000096IBH,"The Great Dictator was ranked as the 37th best American comedy of all time by the American Film Institute. Then again the AFI seems to think that the only funny films are old films. I was confused by the film right from the opening scene. Chaplin plays a soldier in the German army during WW I but it was difficult to tell that it was supposed to be Germany since nobody is trying to affect a German accent and the uniforms aren't really correct. My assumption had been that he was playing a young Adenoid Hynkel (Adolph Hitler) because Chaplin and Hitler have the same moustache and I knew Chaplin was playing a parody of Hitler, however this is a completely separate character, a Jewish barber. Chaplins barber bumbles his way through the fighting and ends up helping a pilot named Schultz escape with an important dispatch and again I was confused because actor Reginald Gardener speaks with a very British accent even though he is supposed to be a Commander in the German army.

This film is more a series of comedy sketches rather than story and when it does try to inject a story it drags the film down. Every single moment of magic in this film is entirely due to the comedic talents of Charlie Chaplin. The classic scene of Hynkel playing with the globe is absolute magic and I loved the scene where Chaplins barber and Schultz are flying upside down. On the other hand there is some really dated humor including a not very funny scene where Hynkel throws the Nazi salute at Benzino Napaloni (Benito Mussolini) as Napaloni is trying to shake hands prompting Napaloni to throw the salute as Hynkel goes for a handshake and back and forth. It wasn't funny yet they try the bit at least twice more. The film also goes for the incredibly clich&eacute;d food fight.

I cannot express how much this film is reliant on Chaplin and as someone who is fairly ignorant of his works I became keenly aware of his comedic genius. Theres a scene where Hynkel gracefully climbs the drapes for no apparent reason and it is absolutely hilarious to see. On the other hand if Im going to praise Chaplin for his comedic timing Ill have to give him the blame for the story. Its mostly just a thin vehicle to get from one comedy sketch to another but when you have scenes of Jewish owned businesses having their windows smashed and people being shot to death for resisting Hynkels Stormtroopers it puts a damper on the hilarity. There is also quite a bit of lazy scripting. The movies ending sees the Barber mistaken for Hynkel and he ends up giving an impassioned speech in favor of democracy and human rights. But that begs the question of why Schultz, who had worked with Hynkel directly, never mentioned that he and the barber could be twins. In order to swap Hynkel and the barber the script has Shultz and the barber escape from a concentration camp in full Nazi uniform with no explanation as to how they did it. Then Hynkel is inexplicably out duck hunting in a tiny boat when in the previous scene he was ordering an invasion of Osterlich. He is mistaken for the barber and knocked out by soldiers searching for the escaped pair and again they make no note of the fact that the man they knocked out is a dead ringer for Hynkel. This may seem overly critical for a comedy but I do believe even comedies can have solid stories to back up the humor.

I did not laugh once watching this movie and that doesnt necessarily mean its not a funny movie. It probably had audiences rolling in the aisles in 1940 but this isn't 1940. This is more of an occasional smile or possible chuckle movie rather than belly laughs. I could probably compress the entire funny bits into a 20 minute YouTube video. This is an earnest attempt to create a propaganda film to battle against the spread of fascism in the 1940s and inject some humor. Its a fine movie to watch with a very good message but its unlikely youll need a hanky to wipe away the tears of laughter.",1396828800,,3937,4.488145048814505

The movie also has some lessons about the human race and that everyone is equal. These lessons are specifically mentioned in the final speech of the movie.

1881088,5,B000096IBH,"The best scenes in the film are all at the beginning  the Jewish Barber (The Little Tramp) fights World War I with Big Bertha, flying a plane upside down, before entering a hospital for a decade or more. Well! In the meantime, Hitler has risen, Jews are on the hate list, and hes oblivious to it all. Chaplin does a great job showing the villainy of Adenoid Adolf Hitler Hynkel, and making fun of his Germanisms, although the dialogue is often a bit dull (not enough physical humour  what s Chaplin going to make of the sound age? Will he survive? Well, we will later see that he does sort of). Turns applause on and off. Even the microphones react to his spit!! Great gags around the bulletproof silk, the parachute hat. Funny to see him giving Paulette a shave!! Bouncing the world around, twirling it on his finger, as the lyrical music plays  beautiful! Portrait and sculpture posing. Shaving to the tune of the Hungarian Rhapsody. Peace is declared. Great train station monument clock with Hynkels pose next to it.

The DVD comes with a full set of great bonus materials, including a 55-minute documentary called The Tramp And The Dictator, showing how Charlie faced off against the monster that he had strange parallels with  Chaplin and Hitler were born only four days apart into middle class families, with Chaplin the elder, and both experienced poverty before their rises to tremendous power and influence. The narrators describe both of their lives, showing that Chaplin tasted success earlier than Hitler, whose patience was rewarded with unprecedented levels of power and the capacity to do evil on a totally new scale. The documentary makers hired Kenneth Branagh as the narrator, and he gets into some nonsense about Chaplin using the power of laughs to take on the monster (sticks and stones), nullifying him by refusing to take him seriously (please!). They gave some perspective of the times, explaining that without the crash of 1929 Hitler could never have reached power, as it brought chaos back to Germany, and that Mussolini was particularly admired by businessmen, who liked his ability to whip things into shape and make the trains run on time (always more important than human rights, of course). Chaplins son explained that he and his father would often go to a newsreel-only cinema (such things existed in those days!!) and just watch the news, and he was fascinated by Hitler, who he considered the greatest actor hed ever seen, according to Sidney Lumet. He went to Berlin in 1931, got a great welcome; the Nazis thought that he was a Jew, an accusation he stubbornly refused to deny (possibly out of solidarity with the Jewish people  after all, anyone funny was Jewish, according to Lumet). Chaplins visit is included in The Eternal Jew with nasty commentary, and he was also profiled in Die Juden Sehen Dich An (and we get Ivan Montagu talking about how he sent Chaplin a copy). The documentary makers quote Reinhard Spritzy, who is described as being part of Hitlers inner circle (theres not a lot of information about Spitzy out there), who believed with certainty that Hitler would have seen The Great Dictator, as hed have seen all of Chaplins films (official records show that Hitler ordered delivery of the film  twice!). Chaplin also travelled to Venice, but he didn't meet Mussolini, says Ray Bradbury. The casting of the exuberant Jack Oakey as Benzino Napaloni, Dictator of Bacteria (a take on Benito Mussolini) was a spot of brilliance.

We get interesting historical perspective, such as the thought that Henry Ford  who the film-makers note was anti-Semitic  initially supported Hitler, and at the time there was a German-American Bund which had meetings at Madison Square Gardens with up to 20,000 followers, often making anti-Semitic statements. At the time there were over 100 anti-Semitic journals in the US, including American Gentile, which would run nonsensically threatening headlines like Jews defile our Christmas. There were even congressional investigations into the Jewish influence in Hollywood (WHAT!!!); the documentary points out that Hollywood made money in Germany and Italy, and there were occasions when films were censored of their anti-German content, often after being previewed for the German consul (wow  American collaboration with Nazi Germany!). One such film was Blockade, which was critical of the fascist forces in the Spanish civil war (a cause that the Nazis supported) that as such included a nasty closing line by Henry Fonda in defiance of this situation, Wheres the conscience of the world?! Charlie Chaplin owned his own studio and self-financed the film, so he didn't have to worry about as many things as others might have, but there were early indications of resistance from countries like Chaplins native UK, which didn't want to piss off the Nazis. But Chaplin got full support from the President of the US, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who personally, silently encouraged Chaplin to continue with his film, which began filming six days after World War II started (but, of course, two years before the US entered it). As Chaplin was filming the closing speech the attack on France happened, and by the time that the film was released Hitlers Blitzkrieg had just been launched  finishing the whole film took 559 days (they even had to rebuild the ghetto set to re-shoot scenes that Chaplin wasn't happy with)!! The documentary shows scenes from the original ending, which included a folk dance with hundreds of extras (and we get wonderful colour shots of this from private shots taken by Chaplins brother Sidney). We also see Chaplin venting on an assistant director. The film opened in the UK, despite the earlier misgivings figures there had about the topic, and it became Chaplins biggest-ever money maker, even though it was banned in Europer, some parts of South America, and even Ireland (!!!).

The extra features also shows Sidney Chaplins personal colour films: in the first part, The Ballroom, where a girl sticks out her tongue, the camera pans around a lot, that lasts 4.5 minutes. Two minutes of the falling-down-stairs scene, 3.5 minutes of scenes from filming the ghetto, then the World War I reel in its entirety, where we see girls who were visiting the set, and several stage hands, and we see the World War I explosions  Charlie gives extras a pep talk from the Big Bertha prop, lots of laughs (7 minutes).

As a prelude to the barber scenes, we get Charlie The Barber, a short piece of seven minutes that shows Charlie, the worst barber in the world, seating a client in a broken-down barbers chair, Charlie reads the customers newspaper while lathering him, he has a ticky arm, the chair falls apart, the customer is burned, blinded and brutalised.

The hilarity of his global balloon dance, his silly trip on the ""Nazi"" pattern of the floor, as well as the names he gave to his global characters, make this a Chaplin masterpiece.  Chaplin had the forsight and nerve to attack Hitler before U.S. entry into WWII through this film.  His passionate speech at the end brought brutal reality to what appeared to be comedy.

And above all the accurate sense of what power means for some people and how one day we are up and in the other we can be down. Of course that since humanity wants to see what is really happening lot of people died in brutal conditions. So, what we can do is not forget ever what happened and why...and why nobody stopped things when they have to. Perhaps we can find that power appears again.

I was thoroughly entertained the entire time, and this blu ray makes the movie look and sound better than I would have imagined.  I know that the final scene has been called melodramatic or saccharine, but I think it's a bold statement for the times, and despite being a little Capra-esque, it doesn't take away from the rest of the movie (in fact, I wished that more of our political leaders of today spoke with that kind of passion and conviction).  The run time is a little long, and some of the sequences with Hynkel are a bit overplayed, but this is definitely worth watching again, and I look forward to sharing it with my kids when they're old enough to enjoy it.",1339545600,,910,4.3352941176470585
1881126,5,B000096IBH,"Every once in a very long while I watch a film that is obviously a masterpiece; and Chaplin's ""The Great Dictator"" is certainly one of them. Chaplin took almost three years to make this film from his very first thoughts to the last scene to be filmed and all put together; it was worth every bit of effort he put into it. Chaplin studied Hitler's style, movements and manner of public speaking by watching numerous newsreels in theaters; and his ""Little Tramp"" character was the perfect way to portray the Jewish barber who for once cannot easily give his tormentor a swift kick in the tush and run away to safety. Indeed, everything about this film is so well done that I can't think of anything wrong with it--at two hours it is still very easy to focus and follow the storyline with genuine interest. I truly wanted to know what would happen to the characters and Chaplin builds up to the final scene with that incredible monologue as only a genius could do. The quality of the print is excellent and the musical score lack nothing; this is just an incredible film.

Chaplin plays Adenoid Hynkel, Dictator of Tomania; this is a very thinly disguised portrait of Germany's dictator Adolf Hitler. Chaplin doesn't miss the slightest detail; he has his imitation of Hitler down to a science with gestures, photo ops that happened in real life and more. Chaplin then uses his ""Little Tramp"" character (for the last time) to also play a Jewish barber who gets the rudest awakening possible. While the barber suffered from amnesia in a hospital after World War One, Hynkel and his brutal police force gained power and forced Jews into a ghetto to terrorize and even kill them. Paulette Goddard plays Hannah, the girlfriend of the Jewish barber; and Jack Oakie portrays Italy's fascist ruler Mussolini in the guise of Bacteria's Napaloni in the film. While we witness horrifying scenes in the Jewish ghetto (and this is what it looked like without Chaplin knowing the full extent of what Hitler was doing to the Jews), we also see a number of hilarious interactions between Hynkel and Napaloni when they meet and fight! Look also for terrific performances by Reginald Gardiner as Schultz; Henry Daniell as Garbitsch; Billy Gilbert as Herring and Maurice Moscovitch as Mr. Jaeckel.

There are eerily splendid scenes and sequences scattered all throughout the film; but perhaps the most brilliant that deserves special mention is Chaplin's dance with the globe as he portrays Hitler's desire to be ""Emperor of the World."" I rarely see such excellent cinema.

There are a wonderful lot of extras on the second DVD. We get a documentary about Chaplin and Hitler; color footage of the filming taken by Chaplin's brother Sydney and more.

""The Great Dictator"" is essential viewing. Even if you don't have much interest in World War Two, watching this film may well change that. Chaplin was very brave to attack Hitler in this film; before the United States entered World War Two one did not take on Hitler all that easily. Chaplin endured a great deal of pressure not to make this film but he made it anyway and FDR himself made sure that Chaplin was able to release it. In addition, people interested in World War Two and dramas with social and political themes should get this for their collections; Chaplin fans will be delighted with the film.",1339027200,,3336,4.776429809358752

1881128,5,B000096IBH,"I've turned to classics for awhile. This is one of the most enduring classics of all. Charlie Chaplin plays two roles: the Phooey [fuhrer] Adenoid Hynkel and a mild-mannered Jewish barber. Hynkel is the dictator of Tomania. The barber saved the life of an officer in The World War (i.e., the first one), and in doing so, suffered an injury that left him amnesiac and in a hospital for 20 years. By the time he walked away from the hospital, thinking it had only been a week or two, things had changed quite a bit.

In the ghetto, the barber quickly discovers what has been happening while he was gone, and that he has been gone a lot longer than he supposed. He and his neighbors plot how they might thwart the stormtroopers when Hinkel announces a ban on persecuting Jews. It is only so a wealthy Jewish banker will agree to loan him the money he needs to invade Osterlich, however, and when the banker says no way, the repression is right back on.

The one scene I think everyone has seen by now is the dance with a world globe balloon. Hinkel has just been told by Herr Garbitch that he could rule the world, and he is in ecstasy. At least until the balloon breaks and he is left holding a shriveled piece of torn rubber.

One of the most entertaining part of the movie is the satire running through people and place names. Field Marshall Herring is fat and stupid; Herr Garbitch is lean and entirely too clever. Benzino Napaloni is the uncivilized dictator of Bacteria, nicknamed Il Digy-a-Ditchy, who has threatened to invade Osterlich. He has his army secreted outside Pretzelburg, all ready to strike. But he decides to try to make a deal with his ""little buddy,"" the Phooey. Of course Il Digy wants the Phooey to sign the agreement first, then he will withdraw his troops. Hynkel wants Napaloni to withdraw his troops first, then he will sign.

The ending is as worthy of the film as that global fantasy scene, however. Through some half-way plausible circumstances, the little barber is mistaken for Hinkel and thrust up onto a platform full of microphones. The speech he gives, while everyone think it is the Phooey giving it, is awesome.",1336780800,,2148,4.571428571428571
1881129,5,B000096IBH,"Here we have some of the greatest films ever made. I will leave the reviews to the above. I would like to comment on print quality. All of the films in this collection are made from pristine 35mm prints from Chaplin's collection, and are truly amazing. The issue is the running times of the films. When Chaplin re-released his films in the 1960's and 70's he trimmed some of the scenes to tighten the film. Hence the shorter running times of some of the prints. Modern Times should run 86 minutes yet runs only 83. The Great Dictator should run 125 minutes but only runs 121 minutes. The complete versions currently are only available from the 20th Century Fox Playhouse VHS that were released in the late 80's.

1881131,4,B000096IBH,"Though not as funny as his silent films, this one has much more heart then most of his other ones though. What I find most amazing about it is that this film captures the suffering of the jews before the WWII even started. It's almost prophetic about what would happen if the world didn't wake up. It really annoys me how some people say it makes a mockery of the plight of the jews, when it's actually amazing to see a how a movie like this was made before we even know the full extent of what Hitler was going to do.
About the film, I really enjoyed the scene where he spoofs Hitler's Speeches with some absolutly hilarious gibberish.  The altercations between him and Napaloni(Mussolini) are also hilarious.

1881133,4,B000096IBH,"The Great Dictator (1940), released to DVD and Blu-ray on May 24th, 2011 is the second of Charlie Chaplin`s features to receive the Criterion treatment, following 2010's release of Modern Times (1936).  Times was Chaplin's last silent feature, produced nine years after the advent of sound.  Chaplin stated that when, and if, his famous character the Tramp ever spoke, it would be as a farewell.  He found a reason for the Tramp to break his silence in the rise of Adolf Hitler and the Third Reich; this was the birth of The Great Dictator.

Few people wanted Chaplin to make this anti-Hitler satire, and the speech at the end of Dictator was even seen by some as communist propaganda.  It securely put Chaplin on the subversive list.  Within a few years, Chaplin was thrown out of the United States, only to be invited back by the Academy Awards for a honorary Oscar (he never actually won one) in 1971.  Chaplin accepted the honor as a sign of mending.

Chaplin later said that if he had known the actual extent of the horrors perpetrated in Nazi Germany, he could never have made The Great Dictator.  His detractors went so far as to accuse him of merely being angry at Hitler for stealing his mustache.  Of course, Chaplin had been making films against government oppression and the struggle of the little man almost from day one.  Additionally, Chaplin's half-brother's father was Jewish, giving him further motive to lampoon the dictator.  Chaplin's mistake was that he spoke out against Hitler and the Third Reich before the United States entered the war.

Whether or not the Jewish Barber is the Tramp has been debated for years.  He is not referred to as the Tramp, but he is certainly a Tramp-like character, and that is really enough.  But, for the first time, Chaplin is uneasy with his iconic character.  After seeing the Tramp in all of his silent eloquence for years, hearing him speak in the opening WWI sequence is  greatly disconcerting.  This opening is awkward, and Chaplin reveals that verbal humor is not his strength.  Jokes about gas and, later, plays off the words ""Aryan"" and ""vegetarian"" fall embarrassingly flat.  His Tramp doughboy had done better lampooning the Great War in First National's uneven Shoulder Arms (1918), which may be the first anti-war film.  Still, the Marx Brothers bested Chaplin in both of his anti-war films with their hilariously surreal and biting Duck Soup (1933).

When The Great Dictator picks up in Nazi Germany, the film improves, albeit sporadically.  Not surprisingly, Chaplin's best moments are in two and a half silent vignettes.  In the first, the Jewish Barber is in a scuffle when Paulette Goddard's Hannah accidentally hits him over the head with a frying pan intended for one of the bullying Nazi soldiers.  The Barber's brief, dazed dance trot down a ghetto street, past shop windows painted with the word ""Jew,"" evokes anxious humor.  Unfortunately, this brief scene is only half silent.  The scene is framed with slapstick interplay between the Barber and the stormtroopers--ranging from buffoonery with a paint dipped brush to an attempted lynching--which further weakens its impact.  All of this is akin to Keystone Cops antics.  Something more unsettling was desperately needed.

The second and third silent vignettes are shared between the Barber and the Great Dictator (also played by Chaplin).  The Barber's shaving of a customer, choreographed to the music of Brahms, is a brilliantly polished bit of quicksilver business and has nothing to do with the rest of the film.  (The shaving sequence had been attempted in a previous short and is a good example of how Chaplin re-worked ideas).  It is the Tramp's best moment in the film, however.  In the final silent vignette, The Great Dictator nearly copulates with a balloon globe of the world.  Oddly, it is in the portrayal of Hitler, rather than the Barber, that we see more of Chaplin's Tramp shining through.  The Dictator hearkens back to the earliest Keystone Tramp characterizations, when the little fellow could be cruel, selfish, and remarkably antagonistic.  (Later in his career, Chaplin's First National Tramp has a moment, in The Pilgrim [1923], when he delivers a sermon in a hyperkinetic, uncannily Hitler-like stance).  Chaplin clearly invests most of his energy into this new character.

The Barber's cutesy relationship with Hannah is forced and occasionally irksome, although through no fault of Goddard, who is probably Chaplin's best leading lady.  Her role here is not the level of her compelling Gamin in the Modern Times, but she is Chaplin's equal in ways that Edna Purviance, Georgia Hale, and Virginia Cherril, good as they were, could not be.

In 1917 Chaplin lost his great on-screen nemesis, Eric Campbell, to a car accident.  Chaplin's films thus lost the sense of rudimentary mystery that Campbell's foil gave to the Tramp.  The closest Chaplin came to having a worthwhile nemesis again was in Jack Oakie's ""Napolini"" (i.e. Mussolini.).  Although Oakie has been rightly praised for his performance here, time  has also somewhat rusted his Chico Marx-like caricaturization.  Almost as good, although his appearance is brief, is Henry Daniel's Herr Garbitsch (likely based on Joseph Goebbels).  Daniel, as usual, supplies macabre precision to his villainous role, although he is, overall, too sophisticated for the part.  The Great Dictator benefits from Chaplin's attention and development of his co-stars Goddard, Oakie, and Daniel, but the film also frequently flounders by being littered with flat, obvious jokes.

The speech at the end is as naive and as heart-felt for its age as John's Lennon's ""Imagine"" was three decades later.  Chaplin steps out of character here, and critics of the period were right in their assessment that the speech throws the film off.  In hindsight, the oration is a  coda of sorts for Chaplin's Tramp, although, again, verbal expression amounts to a new, nervous language for the actor.  The creation and the creator merge into a persona of maudlin sentimentality and extravagant social satire.  To criticize Chaplin for either is to criticize Chaplin as a whole.

Chaplin said if the Tramp ever spoke, he had to say something important.  Imagine, a filmmaker actually believing a film needs to have a point.  For all of its flaws, The Great Dictator is an important and enjoyable film.  Whether it's important or enjoyable enough is debatable.

*The Criterion extras are sprinkled with The Great Dictator`s seeds.  ""Chaplin's Napoleon"" is a short ""visual essay"" detailing an abandoned film on the French dictator.  More interesting is the short King, Queen, and Joker, directed by Chaplin's brother Sydney. It contains one of two blueprints for the barbershop sequence (the second is a scene cut from First National's Sunnyside).

Another fascinating document in this impressive criterion package is film critic Michael Wood's impassioned essay in defense of the film. Chaplin was probably grateful, considering all the negative heat he received from other quarters.

1881134,5,B000096IBH,Who but Charlie Chaplin could make a comedy about Nazis. But to call this film a mere comedy would be an injustice to it. It is a deeply intelligent and thought provoking film that was made during the time that the Nazis were rising in power. It is also Chaplin's first full lengeth sound feature. Also featuring the beautiful Paulette Goddard. The Criterion Collection brings this brilliant film to blu-ray and it looks amazing. From the brilliant mind of Charlie Chaplin we see a piece of cinema that can truly be called great. From beginning to end this film is entertaining. Highly recommended for all Chaplin fans or fans of films about complicated issues.,1318896000,,661,4.807017543859649
1881135,5,B000096IBH,"I'm sorry but I don't want to be an Emperor, that's not my business. I don't want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone if possible, Jew, gentile, black man, white. We all want to help one another, human beings are like that. We all want to live by each other's happiness, not by each other's misery. We don't want to hate and despise one another. In this world there is room for everyone and the earth is rich and can provide for everyone.

The way of life can be free and beautiful. But we have lost the way.

Greed has poisoned men's souls, has barricaded the world with hate;
has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed.

We have developed speed but we have shut ourselves in:
machinery that gives abundance has left us in want.
Our knowledge has made us cynical,
our cleverness hard and unkind.
We think too much and feel too little:
More than machinery we need humanity;
More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness.

Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost.

The aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together. The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men, cries out for universal brotherhood for the unity of us all. Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world, millions of despairing men, women and little children, victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people. To those who can hear me I say ""Do not despair"".

The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed, the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress: the hate of men will pass and dictators die and the power they took from the people, will return to the people and so long as men die [now] liberty will never perish. . .

Soldiers: don't give yourselves to brutes, men who despise you and enslave you, who regiment your lives, tell you what to do, what to think and what to feel, who drill you, diet you, treat you as cattle, as cannon fodder.

Don't give yourselves to these unnatural men, machine men, with machine minds and machine hearts. You are not machines. You are not cattle. You are men. You have the love of humanity in your hearts. You don't hate, only the unloved hate. Only the unloved and the unnatural. Soldiers: don't fight for slavery, fight for liberty.

In the seventeenth chapter of Saint Luke it is written:
""The kingdom of God is within man""
Not one man, nor a group of men, but in all men; in you, the people.

You the people have the power, the power to create machines, the power to create happiness. You the people have the power to make life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure. Then in the name of democracy let's use that power, let us all unite. Let us fight for a new world, a decent world that will give men a chance to work, that will give you the future and old age and security. By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power, but they lie. They do not fulfil their promise, they never will. Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people. Now let us fight to fulfil that promise. Let us fight to free the world, to do away with national barriers, do away with greed, with hate and intolerance. Let us fight for a world of reason, a world where science and progress will lead to all men's happiness.

Soldiers! In the name of democracy, let us all unite!

. . .

Look up! Look up! The clouds are lifting, the sun is breaking through. We are coming out of the darkness into the light. We are coming into a new world. A kind new world where men will rise above their hate and brutality.

The soul of man has been given wings, and at last he is beginning to fly. He is flying into the rainbow, into the light of hope, into the future, that glorious future that belongs to you, to me and to all of us. Look up. Look up",1317945600,,3817,4.350210970464135

1881137,4,B000096IBH,"The Great Dictator is a good movie but by no means one of Chaplin's best. It is very very funny but not as funny as his silent films. I have no problem with the politcal message, the drama, or even the speech at the end. I do, however, think this movie is much too long. It is stretched out to 205 minutes. In my opinion it should only have been about 90 minutes. It is simply not funny for the last 45 minutes, and it takes longer than necessary to get to the point.

There are definitely some funny scenes in this movie. Scenes remind me of Abbot & Costello, the Marx Brothers, and of course Chaplin's own Tramp. The funny scenes are very VERY funny, and I laughed out loud many times. Unfortunately much of the film is not funny.

The dramatic story is also very good. The drama would have mixed better with the comedy had the film been shorter instead of stretching everything out. Both times I watched this movie I had to struggle to stay awake past the first hour.

The political message is highly relevent today now that the enemy of liberty is not a foreign dictator but our own government. It is true that the film ends on kind of a confusing and downer note (especially for an alleged comedy), but Chaplin gives one of the best motivational speeches I have ever heard.

In closing, this is a good movie but not a great one and is much too long. I would have given it 3 stars, but its historical significance warrants a 4th star. (It is Chaplin after all.) I recommend that all Charlie Chaplin fans see this movie, but only die-hard fans need purchase it.

Plenty of dark humor, and some parts are outrageously funny...but the overall message is deadly serious.",1313539200,,316,5.428571428571429
1881140,5,B000096IBH,"The Great Dictator was truly an ambitious endeavor for Charles Chaplin. In the middle of World War II, when Hitler was invading all Europe and Jews were persecuted and murdered without mercy, the greatest actor in that time and the most loved person decided that it was time someone stand against him. With Hollywood playing dumb, Chaplin created a parody that it's not only inmensely funny (which is a little bit uncomfortable due to the subject matter), but also, it's humane, poignant and not afraid of showing the evil things that were going on at that time.

Chaplin is absolutely brilliant in the dual role of incompetent dictator Adenoid Hynkel and the jewish barber (who is a variation of his popular Tramp character). There are big laughs in the movie mostly the parts involving the dictator and his circle. But, even when there are big laughs in the film, there are also moments of pain and sadness that makes the movie more compelling. The controversial last scene where Chaplin steps out of character and gives a passionate speech about the evil of war and that people should stand and defend liberty. Many critics have argue that this scene is abrupt and detracts from the rest of the film. I partly agree with them. Yes, the scene is abrupt and yes it takes you out of the rest of the story (it does not help that we do not have a proper ending for the story) but I think it was a very important and daring thing to do. When the world turn the back to the horrors of war, Chaplin adressed them and talked to millions of people that watched the movie. He tried to raise awareness and even if he didn't, at least he tried when most of the world didn't bother. An excellent film.

Video & Audio:
Criterion, once more has suprassed my expectations because the great dictator looks absolutely terrific on Blu-ray. The transfer is clean without any signs of damage or compression artifacts. Contrast and detail are superb and film grain has remained intact.

Likewise, the uncompressed monoaural sound is also spectacular. Dialogue is crisp and clear without any signs of damage or hiss.

Bonus Material:
Criterion has put a nice assortment of bonus features to accompany the film. First you have an audio commentary by Chaplin's historians Dan Kamin and Hooman Mehran. You also have the terrific documentary ""The Tramp and the Dictator"" in which filmmakers and historians parallel Chaplin's and Hitler's lives and discuss the production of TGD. You have two vissual essays one discussing Chaplin's ambition to do a Napoleon film and other about the production of TGD. A real treat is to see the color production footage of the film shot by Charlie's half brother Sydney. Then you have a sequence from a Sydney Chaplin's short called King, Queen, Joker (1921) and a deleted barbershop sequence from Chaplin's 1919 short Sunnyside. Closing the disc is a rerelease trailer.

A booklet is also included containing an essay by film critic Michael Wood, Chaplin's 1940 defense of his movie, a reprint from critic Jean Narboni on the film's final speech and Al Hirschfeld's fantastic pressbook illustrations.

Closing Thoughts:
The Great Dictator is one of Chaplin's best films and one of the most important ones. Humor is impeccable and performances are brilliant. Criterion has done a terrific work with this classic and is a must-own release.",1313452800,,3347,4.852889667250438
1881141,5,B000096IBH,"Most of Chaplin's silent film efforts were whimsical slap-stick comedies with slight undertones of social satire: booting the rear of an immigrant official, escaping the clutches of fool-hardy police, or being trapped inside a mechanized factory. The Tramp, the first iconic figure of the new medium of film/cinema, was the nameless but lovable immigrant, not knowing quite where he fit in. Always on the periphery of the establishment but ultimately of a kindly and innocent nature, the Tramp was endeared by audiences across America and Europe. For those coming to Ellis Island for the first time to forge new lives in a America, Chaplin's comedy probably reflected their grappling with this alien world. But on the surface, the main point was always entertainment, mostly comedic and occasionally sentimental but never biting. And then, Chaplin fused both comedy and political/social commentary into a film which really does make quite a political point.

The Great Dictator is one of the best mingling of social satire and comedy, a brilliant and effective combination of entertainment and commentary to ridicule fascism which had taken over Germany and Italy. The Tramp or nameless barber is a private at the very end of World War I fighting for the fictional country of Tomainia. He along with a pilot escapes from the front lines, crashing in a plane, luckily just in time for the Armistice. But the Tramp is hospitalized for 20 years, and he suffers memory loss, and doesn't know the country is under new leadership.

His country has put their faith in a new leader, Adenoid Hynkel, who looks one helluva lot like a cross between Adolph Hitler and Charlie Chaplin. In this country, Jews are being targeted. After leaving the hospital, the Tramp returns to his barber shop. He is immediately assaulted by policeman in helmets with armbands with crosses. A scuffle and chase ensues in typical Chaplin fashion, with lots of running around and a head being banged more than once, the service being provided by a woman in an upper window. As he navigates down the streets while evading authorities, he sees the word ""JEW"" written in bold letters on shops and windows.

Eventually the film cuts to behind-the-scenes of Adenoid Hynkel, the new Great Leader of Tomainia. My favorite aspect of this film is the portrayal of the Leader/Dictator. He's pompous, arrogant, and vain, so exaggerated he would give Stalin and Hitler a run for their money, or would he? He has a military officer lick his envelope, and is simultaneously having his portrait painted and his bust sculpted. He ceases persecution of the Jews, not out of moral indignation, but he wants to borrow money from one of them! The Dictator then makes speeches on loud-speakers in a kind of gibberish which sounds German-like, with the words sour kraut repeated many times. In a couple of crazy scenes, the Dictator is shown bouncing around a large medicine ball which looks like the world. In another, he confronts another Dictator who looks like Mussolini, and they engage in a race to the top in barber chairs! Then the awful helmeted police are after the barber, presumably because he's Jewish. Through a crazy series of madcap adventures, not unlike many of his silent films, the Tramp, who looks like the Dictator, eventually is mistaken for him, and compelled to make a speech, one of the greatest in cinematic history.

What the Nazis were doing in Germany and then in Europe was no joke, but Mel Brooks pointed out that the only way to deal with their hypocrisy, prejudice, and ultimate lunacy, is to laugh at them. And that's what Chaplin did many years before Brooks' ""The Producers"". But inter-spliced in Chaplin's comedy is a very caustic criticism of fascism. Of course, the reality of the Holocaust was not known to Chaplin at the time of production, and I don't believe he was making light of Nazi atrocity. At the same time, by pointing out the ridiculousness of fascist dictators, Chaplin was really harpooning those who put themselves above others as infallible and the ludicrous behavior which goes with it, usually blind adoration. Ultimately, the Dictator is just a Tramp.",1312588800,,4157,4.9598278335724535
1881142,5,B000096IBH,"I've loved Charlie Chaplin since the first time I saw him as a kid. I always thought of him just as a comedian. But that's like saying Mark Twain was just a novelist.

This film shows that Chaplin knew what many others knew before and since: sometimes you can get people to listen to your point of view better if you give it to them with jokes. The first hour of the movie is mainly signature Chaplin slapstick, but slowly changes to more serious tones at the end after having passed through excellent satire of Hynkel/Hitler's motivations.

This is the first time I've seen Chaplin in this light and now I respect him even more than I have in the past. If you want non-stop laughs this is not the film for you, but if you love political humor and satire and don't mind serious subjects made fun of (ala The Daily Show), you'll hate missing this.

It doesn't hurt that the blu-ray looks like it was shot recently. The sound is great and the image looks better than a film of this age has a right to. I think it's clearer than ""Young Frankenstein"" or the B&W parts of ""Wizard of Oz""",1312329600,,1081,4.315270935960591

This film introduced me to Chaplin and I intend trying to collect more of his films, and hopefully Criterion will release more in the near future. I won't spend too much time on the plot, but basically, Chaplin plays a barber and a dictator, both look alike, and the dictator is obviously a parody of Hitler. Not only is there brilliant dialougue humor, but also great physical comedy. The film cost roughly $2 million and it shows greatly in terms of production value. The film was nominated for 5 Oscars, including Best Picture(Chaplin), Actor(Chaplin), Screenplay(Chaplin), Supporting Actor(Jack Oakie as the hilarious parody of Mussolini, as Napoloni of Bacteria), and Best Score(Meredith Wilson). The DVD is excellent. The audio commentary track alone is worth the price of this already marvelous DVD. To add to the value, a documentary has been included from ten years ago, that discusses the similarites between Hitler and Chaplin.(the similarities don't end at the mustache).

Perfect cinematography and sound, wonderful writing, and very intense subject matter.  Other than some slight overacting by the obnoxious Mussolini character, and some mock-German speeches of Chaplin's character being a tad longer than they should, I really can't find any flaws.  It has aged extremely well, and were it not for some dated slang and obsolete special effects, you probably couldn't tell it from something made in the 60's, or heck, even the 90's.

1881157,4,B000096IBH,"The very first Chaplin film that I ever saw was when I was a kid when my mother brought me to see ""The Great Dictator"" on the big screen.  As a kid, I didn't really appreciate what the movie was about and so although I laughed at the slapstick moments, I didn't really ""get it"" until I watched it again many, many years later as part of this very good box set.  The only downer is that my copy here is faulty and hence everything after the classic pudding scene for some reason will not show; as no one else has mentioned it here I'm assuming that I'm just the unlucky one to get a bum disc.

Watching the other very well restored picture and remastered sound quality films I realised that Chaplin's genius was such that I actually enjoyed the ""silent"" films like ""Modern Times"" and ""The Gold Rush"" - redux a.k.a. 1942 version a whole lot better than the sound comedies of the time and also many of the more recent comedies that age poorly from the 70s.  I was amazed that I could still laugh at most of ""Modern Times"" which I can now say is not only my favourite Chaplin film but also one of my favourite comedies ever as well as the re-done ""The Gold Rush"" especially the dancing rolls scene with the very well composed piece accompanying it as well as the brilliant boot-eating scene.  I have watched ""City Lights"" separately which is also a very good film but I feel Chaplin's best work is in this volume one collection.

Watching these films made me realise just how talented this man really was as he was also very good in talkies such as ""Limelight"" which is also an excellent film.  He composed the score which was later awarded an Oscar and indeed he was an excellent composer and singer as well even if it is gibberish lyrics such as in ""Modern Times"" or on ""Limelight"" where he also wrote the script and directed this and all his movies.  I can't imagine why people say sound killed the silent stars except perhaps because of their own unwillingness to make the transition as watching Buster Keaton's cameo and very funny role on ""Limelight"" I thought there was nothing wrong with his voice and if he wanted to, he could have made the transition to voice just as Chaplin did.  He would just need to find a good script or write his own as Chaplin did.  In fact, I thought Keaton's cameo on ""Sunset Boulevard"" was good although he hardly said anything.

I watched the Marx Brothers Collection immediately after this set and it is night and day with regards how much more I liked Chaplin's work over that one.  For one most of the jokes are still funny with Chaplin while much of the Marx Brothers' stuff made me keep looking at the watch to see how much more time there was left to endure it.  Also Groucho shamelessly steals many of Chaplin's dance moves with the kicking steps in some scenes of ""Horse Feathers"" which if you compare are identical to what Chaplin does in his earlier films.  Amazing how so many words on the Marx Brothers can barely raise a chuckle from me while the sparse and efficiently used words on Chaplin's works made me laugh a whole lot more and I am actually looking forward to watching them again and even to buy ""The Great Dictator"" again to replace the dud that Amazon sent me the first time.  I thought ""Duck Soup"" was pretty good but you'd have to pay me to watch the other ones on that set again; maybe ""Cocoanuts"", ""Animal Crackers"", ""Monkey Business"" and ""Horse Feathers"" were funny during the Depression but watching them today almost gave me a depression!

Excellent restoration job, excellent choice of content, good special features extras and packaging make this a very good value purchase and a must have for any fan of film's video library; just make sure you don't get a dud disc like I did.  As I live too far away from the U.S. I'm afraid I can't do a return or exchange but I'm sure you can.

1881167,5,B000096IBH,"What a glorious, uplifting movie this is. A great cri de coeur against war and hatered, and in favor of tolerance and peace. That the message it presents is, by this point, somewhat of a given does nothing to diminish its importance.

You doubtless know of the plot by now. Charlie Chaplin, a man with a moustache suspiciously similar to a certain unpleasant fellow in history, plays the role of an anti-Semetic dictator named Hinkel and a poor Jewish barber. That these two look exactly the same is obvious. That the fact doesn't come in handy until the end is somewhat unexpected, but still great.

The movie avoids getting bogged down in all the obvious traps that await a film with content such as this. It doesn't become preachy until the very last couple minutes when the Little Tramp (not called that, but let's face it, he is), stands and makes a speech that most people seem to feel brings the film to a grinding halt. Not I. I really liked it and the statements therein. They were obvious, but needed to be said. That they still do need saying is a sad commentary on where we are versus where we should be.

This disc includes some amazing special features, such as behind-the-scenes color footage and the usual trailers, etc. What makes for a really nice bonus, however, is the inclusion of a documentry on the relationship between Hitler and Chaplin (born only a few days apart). It includes a lot of information on this movie as well as, stunningly, some great photos showing Hitler in a crowd in Berlin on the day war was declared back in 1914.

I thought the films looked great, and enjoyed the late-career additions of music and film edits that Charlie made.  Chaplin's singing at the beginning of ""The Circus"" was delightful. It was fascinating to see how his films were made, and how he put the finishing touches on them later in life.  I thought the extras were very informative, though sometimes not so interesting.

1881174,5,B000096IBH,"I first saw THE GREAT DICTATOR when I was in grade school, around the time that SCHINDLER'S LIST was released, a far more sober look at the devestating effects of the Holocaust on countless Jews and gentiles alike, as well as the work of Oskar Schindler during that time of such unrest and profound social injustice.  THE GREAT DICTATOR is a social satire, directed by and starring ""The Little Tramp"", himself, Mr. Charles Chaplin.  I know it sounds really strange, gruesome and even inappropriate to create a film that is centered on poking fun at the evil commited by the Third Reich and the effect of Hitler, the Nazi regime and how that resulted in the death, torture, and imprisonment of droves of Jews, Gypsies, Jewish sympathizers, Gentiles and many others.  I ask that you suspend your imagination and give this film a try anyway.

Charlie Chaplin plays two very opposite men.  One is Adenoid Hynkel, a swarthy and short-tempered fascist dictator, based on none other than Adolf Hitler himself.  The other man is a very good and courageous Jewish barber who must face the wrath that Hynkel inflicts on his ghetto.  What's more, Hynkel is alligned with Benzino Napoloni (Jackie Oakie), an Italian fascist dictator (based on Mussolini).  Together, they hope to completely drive out Jews and other groups they feel are standing in the way of the master race.

This film was Chaplin's first ""talkie,"" is brilliant, thoughtful, humorous and provocative.  I reccomend that you give this one a try.  You won't be sorry and it will really leave you thinking hard about the state of the world when you are done watching it.",1188518400,,1622,4.840579710144928
1881175,5,B000096IBH,Charlie Chaplin was a true Genius of His time. He was superb in all his silent films. They each carried volumes of subliminal meassages of wit and  reality.

1881176,5,B000096IBH,i recommend this classic movie highly ... it is available at last!!! great special edition. if we germans would have seen this movie in the thirties  history would have taken another course ... hopefully!,1185235200,,204,5.0
1881177,5,B000096IBH,"Although working conditions and terms don't create genius, it sure can inhibit and even destroy its expression. Buster Keaton and his experience at MGM are Exhibit A of that scenario. Chaplin, however, was in complete creative control of almost his entire career. After his early Keystone shorts, Chaplin never again starred in someone else's film production. In short, nobody could ever say ""no"" to his creative ideas and make it stick. Thus we can look at the films in this collection and lay any blame or applause entirely at the feet of Charles Chaplin, and that circumstance is as unique as Chaplin the artist himself.

It's very hard to describe this excellent set in the context of Chaplin's genius and his evolution as a film maker, because the films are separated from one another by quite large time intervals and interim films that are in volume two, with the exception of Modern Times and The Great Dictator which were sequential projects. ""The Gold Rush"" shows Chaplin's talent at comedy and pathos set in the heart of the silent era (1925) after he had already had some success making silent feature films. ""Modern Times"" is perhaps the best film he ever made, again a silent picture, long after silent films had gone out of vogue in Hollywood (1936). If anything, as time passes, Modern Times just becomes more and more relevant. ""The Great Dictator"" (1940) is Chaplin's first talking picture, and today, given the benefit of the knowledge of what was really going on in Germany during this time, the film almost seems in bad taste. However, even Chaplin admitted that if he had really known the extent of what was happening in Europe at the time he probably would not have made the film. Still, Chaplin turns in a fine performance in a great film where the best parts still involve Chaplin's gift of pantomime. Finally, there is Limelight (1952), which is a very sentimental film that has Chaplin perhaps looking back on his own career and showing what he was truly afraid of having happen - that he would someday be seen as a relic of the past and that only when people were told ""who he used to be"" would he be appreciated or for that matter even welcome. Thus it is really necessary to watch the films in volume 2 to fill in the blanks between the four movies in this collection and get a true picture of Chaplin the artist.

1881178,5,B000096IBH,"This is a great DVD, especially if you can get it for a good price.

We all know the plot, this is a parady of Hitler and its brilliantly done. I've never been a great Chaplin fan but you have to give the man credit - this is a masterpiece. Not only is it funny, but its message, especially the end speech, is deeply moving. The film shoot started 6 days into WW2 and took another 559 days to complete and Chaplin changed the ending completely when he realised that Hitler was even more of a lunatic than he first thought!
The extras are good. There is some colour footage that his brother shot, and a very interesting documentary (thats been on TV) which parallels the life of Hitler and Chaplin. They were born in the same week of the same year.

The most political of Chaplin's films, ""Dictator"" combines slapstick humor and vicious parody; in particular, portly actor Jack Oakie's Mussolini-like incarnation of Napaloni, dictator of Bacteria, is pure genius. Notably, Chaplin's pointed criticism of the Nazis occurred before Hollywood at large was daring to follow suit. (Most brilliant sequence: Hynkel's sublime dance with a balloon-like globe.)",1182729600,,666,6.411111111111111
1881180,3,B000096IBH,"Having heard for many years of this famous film, I finally caught up with this 2 disc set and looked forward to the viewing event with enthusiasm.  Why was I so disappointed?

As a piece of film making, it is very ordinary.  It plays like a cartoon with cardboard sets, a poorly developed story without much logic and some corny gags, many of which can be seen in the skits of Benny Hill who incidentally Charlie Chaplin admired tremendously. Paulette Goddard is poor and most of the supporting cast have little to do with the notable exception of Jack Oakie who wildly burlesques the famous character he imitates and is quite funny.  There are a few jewels like the dance with the globe but most of the humour is pretty basic.  By 1940, Hollywood was capable of much more sophisticated satire.

However, the DVD print is excellent and the film really can not be appreciated without an understanding of the context of its release.  Accordingly, the DVD contains an excellent documentary which follows the lives of Chaplin and Hitler, who co-incidentally were born within a week of each other.  As a result of the documentary, I watched the film again and there is no doubt that it was an extraordinary undertaking by Chaplin to make the film at all.  His final speech resonates and is patently sincere.  The film opened to controversy and I asked my 89 year old mother if she recalled it.  Her reply was enlightening.  She said that she was never much of a fan of Chaplin but she specifically avoided this  film when it was released because her own world was turned upside down by the events of the day and at the time the uncertainty about her own future was such that she felt Chaplin's film was offensive.  I am sure she was not alone.

The DVD contains a few other extras which are variable. There are scenes from other Chaplin films, clearly included to encourage purchase of those DVDs.  There is also some rare home movie footage in colour of the making of the film but it quickly becomes boring to watch.",1180137600,,2012,4.578212290502793

In one of the extraordinary scenes of Chaplin art, Hynkel performs a ballet with the 'world' which bursts when he thinks he has it in his grasp...

Chaplin also has some biting words on war and war films... In a scene at the beginning of the movie, which takes place during World War I, the Tomanian messenger crashes the plane and thinks... He is about to die... In a state of delirium, he begins to say ridiculous words... The empty double-talk continue ascending into a brilliant take off on all the heroic death scenes of War films...

The sequence in which he and four other characters eat cream cakes containing coins to determine which shall sacrifice his life to murder the dictator is a bitter hilarity filled with great fear...

For all its disappointing shortcomings, ""The Great Dictator"" is still a significant movie for the ironic tones of the film adding something that neither Chaplin nor anymore else could have given it: the irony of history... The necessity to murder Hynkel presages the assassination attempt against Hitler by his generals... The force of the original satire is only surpassed by history's imitation of art...

With a splendid sequence like the duck-shooting accident which leads to the dictator being mistaken for the humbly Jewish barber and vice versa, ""The Great Dictator"" is Chaplin's first talking movie...

1881184,5,B000096IBH,"Chaplin's production of his first true 'talking"" film, ""The Great Dictator"" was commenced one week after the onset of WWII and is a powerful critique of Hitler and the doctrines of Nazism.

Chaplin plays the dual role of the feared and racist dictator of the fictitious country of Tomania, Adenoid Hynkel and a poor Jewish barber living in the ghetto.  The barber had been a veteran of the First World War where he heroically had rescued eminent Tomanian pilot Commander Schultz played by Reginald Gardiner.  In an ensuing plane crash, Gardiner was unscathed but Chaplin suffered injuries leaving him hospitalized for 20 years with amnesia.

After his release the Jewish barber returns to his now ghetto neighborhood unaware of the policies being espoused by Hynkel and his cronies.  He is subjected to persecution as Hynkel denounces the Jewish population.  While there he becomes enamored with Paulette Goddard an attractive Jewish girl, Hannah, living in the ghetto, who eventually flees to neighboring Osterlich.

Dictator Hynkel gets more and more brazen threatening to invade the peaceful Osterlich along with his ally Benzino Napaloni an obvious parody of Mussolini played by Jack Oakie.  Meanwhile the Jewish barber and Schultz who has been branded a traitor get sent off to a concentration camp.

Chaplin and Gardiner escape and in a mix up reminiscent of ""The Prince and the Pauper"", the barber gets mistaken for dictator Hynkel.  He is coaxed to get up in front of the masses to orate.

Chaplin's soliloquy in the movie's finale as the Jewish barber portraying Hynkel rings loudly in the condemnation of Hitler and his policies.  Chaplin uses his immense talent in verbiage, gesticulation and mannerism to cobble an impressive impersonation of the despicable Hitler.

1881188,5,B000096IBH,"Although this set tries to do the impossible, it cannot. But it is a very good collection of Chaplin films.

So, to start with, let me cover what is great in this set.

First, the films are as clearly presented as possible, with great sound, pretty good mastering, and good clarity of image. The speed of projection, a subjective topic at best, is quite carefully handled, and seems to be quite good for the most part. (This only affects the silent Gold Rush, btw.)

The restoration of the original silent Gold Rush is excellent, and a welcome addition to the canon. I don't bother arguing over which version is better, silent or sound, because they both exist in our world and such arguments end up amounting to mere preferences.

Which brings me to the first impossibility. It is IMPOSSIBLE to present a ""definitive"" version of most any Chaplin film, due to the cuts and changes he made in them over the years, and the variation in the editions originally issued. In addition, there are some bits from the original release which simply don't exist in a quality comparable to the quality of the current versions, and which could not be edited in without comprimising the quality.

The Chaplin family made a decision, and stuck to it. They decided to issue the films in the final approved versions, with cuts intact. They also decided to include all cuts as additional material, so that we don't lose what was taken out. I'm not sure how I feel about this, but sometimes a decision must simply be made and stuck with, and the Chaplin family went with this. Not everybody will be satisfied, but the choice has been made.

The additional materials are often good, but equally often pointless. The good stuff includes the Great Dictator documentary, lots of home movies and still, and various sequences from older films that are relevent to the title. The bad stuff includes the truly boring ""Chaplin Today"" documentaries, which are a great example of material trying to prove a point but instead shooting itself in the foot. I regard these documentaries as another example of doing the impossible - by trying to argue that Chaplin is relevent today (and I think he is), the directors end up proving otherwise. Some things can't be won through argument, but only through experience.

One troubling aspect of this set is that, instead of tranferring the movies fresh from film to NTSC video, the films were transferred from film to PAL video, and then converted. This changes film speed a bit, and introduces unavoidable artifacts and degrades the video quality. While not as bad as the HORRENDOUS ""Phantom of the Opera"" fiasco, it's a shame that we cannot see these films in their top quality without getting imported dvds from overseas in the original PAL format.

That all said, we have here four (or five) Chaplin films in possibly the best quality possible in a neat package with lots of goodies. There are plenty of quibbles with this set and it's companion, but the fact is that this is as good as it might ever get, until an even better format comes along. The films are wonderful, and it's nice to have a good edition of them again.",1154649600,,3137,4.711678832116788
1881189,5,B000096IBH,"The Great Dictator is a film that took such courage from the star and director, Charlie Chaplin. The movie was filmed and released at the beginnings of World War 2 and at the rise of the Nazi party. The similarities between dictator Adolf Hitler and the comedic genius that is Charlie Chaplin is quite interesting: both sported the small mustache and were born in the same year, same month, in the same week. Chaplin took a serious approach when spoofing Hitler for this film; he viewed many news reels and studied his technique before making it funny on film.

The Great Dictator has the ability to tug at your heart and make you laugh until you cry. The music is gorgeous and the writing is superb. Though some scenes do drag a bit, most of it flows smoothly.

Perhaps the most famous scene in the movie is the final speech given by Chaplin. It is just him staring at the camera, and nothing stops him from saying what he feels.

Movie buffs have to see this film. The Great Dictator is a beautiful presentation that showcases the cinema genius of Charlie Chaplin.",1149465600,,1066,4.541666666666667

I won't repeat what the other reviewers have written,but I will say it NEVER fails that tears come to my eyes every time I see/hear Chaplins closing speech.

  Jack Oakie is great in support and the extras,that come with this DVD are outstanding.

1881195,4,B000096IBH,"This was Chaplin's first all-talky picture, and the results are mixed. The movie is a biting satire of Hitler and Mussolini, their henchmen and their fanatical way of life, especially regarding the persecution of the Jews. It was daring and forward for 1940 and must have made a lot of people in high places squirm.

But the laughs are on the sporadic side and come mainly with some of the slapsick routines - the old schtick Chaplin had immortalized 20 years earlier. Some of it is priceless: he gets bonked on the head with a frying pan and does a dazed walk down the sidewalk and curb that's as graceful as any Astaire dance routine or anything else on film.

Chaplin plays Adenoid Hynkel as well as a Jewish barber in the ghetto. They are look-alikes (obviously) and at the end the barber is mistaken for Hynkel, which allows Chaplin to end the picture with a 5-minute propaganda speech on the evils of tyranny.

The movie runs 126 minutes; if Chaplin had kept it silent, thus eliminating the odious script and empty talk, and cut the story (and tightened up on what was left) and let up on the propagandizing, the movie might have been a great one instead of just a good one. With Chaplin, of course, mere competency is way better than most other filmmakers can ever expect to do. Certainly worth a watch, but it could have been better.",1133308800,,1341,4.533057851239669

The dance with the globe and the manic speeches are all right on the mark. In fact the fake German is so hillarious that one starts to laugh hysterically every time one listens to it. However, it is the last 6 minutes that are true magic. Chaplin steps out of of his charachter, and pleads for the world to cast of dictators and he even quotes Luke 17 which is brilliant move. As for acting it is stupendous. Paulette Godard is astounding and she is beautifull even with this baggy looking clothes. Chaplin is brilliant in his portrayal of the tramp and Hynkel.

1881199,5,B000096IBH,"This is one of my absolute favorite films of all time. However, I'll confine myself to the DVD here.

Warner usually does unmatchable DVDs of classic films, which is why this one is such a disappointment. The restorations of all of Chaplin's films were done in France, where they use the PAL system for televisions.

Because this DVD is mastered from a French master, it runs, like all PAL videos, 4% faster than normal. As if this were not annoying enough, the difference in speeds causes a sort of multiple exposure problem with the images, since frames don't match up to each other.

It's a real pity, because the restoration was done with great care, and the bonus features are great. However, what matters to me is seeing the film in the best possible way. For that, you'll have to do like I did and track down the out-of-print Image DVD, which is mastered at the correct speed and does not have the PAL ghosting of the image.",1115942400,,931,4.529761904761905

1881205,4,B000096IBH,"""The Great Dictator"" (1940) is an uneven satire that displays Charlie Chaplin's mastery of pantomime and social commentary. This was the comic filmmaker's first talkie  featuring his inspired dual role as Hynkel and the Jewish Barber. However, with the exception of Hynkel's globe dance and the barber's musical shaving technique, ""The Great Dictator"" does not utilize sound and silence nearly as well as ""Modern Times."" The barber's final speech remains stirring (if obviously out of character), but the awkward dramatic elements do not blend well with the film's satirical fabric. In terms of story structure, ""Monsieur Verdoux"" (1947) works better  far more assured in its overall pacing. Though flawed, ""The Great Dictator"" showcases Chaplin in excellent seriocomic form.",1096675200,,775,5.559322033898305
1881206,5,B000096IBH,"Four movies.  Three comedies and one drama.  These are not merely four of Charlie Chaplin's greatest films; they are four of the greatest films of all time.  They're funny, they're sad, but most of all they're passionate.  Chaplin has often been criticized for putting too much sentimentality into his films, and it's a fair complaint.  But for my money, no one did it as successfully as Chaplin.

The four films in this collection represent a sizable range.  The comedy is astonishing, of course, but so is the amount of emotion.  Watching them all in a short space of time really highlights Chaplin's strengths as a director.  I love the way he lets people's faces tell the story; no overuse of dialog cards is required.  Look at the scene in MODERN TIMES where the unemployed father wonders how he will feed his children.  The camera lingers on his face, which tells everything.  Or look at the New Year's Eve sequence in GOLD RUSH where the lonely tramp gazes upon the happy expressions of the partygoers.  It's touching and is played flawlessly.

One of the great things about this set is that three out of four of the movies contain, if not outright sound, a synchronized soundtrack (and even THE GOLD RUSH contains a ""sound"" version that Chaplin dubbed for the 1942 re-release).  Speech isn't the thing to note here -- it's the music.  Chaplin's musical abilities are often forgotten about in lieu of his acting/pantomiming, writing and directing skills.  But just listen to the soundtrack to something like MODERN TIMES.  It's catchy, funny, and fits each scene perfectly.  Wonderful.

Each of these four movies has been restored so the picture and sound quality are excellent.  Out of this set, the big revelation for me was seeing the original version of THE GOLD RUSH for the first time uncut and with the picture in decent shape.  Jokes that I had missed before were suddenly revealed, and I got to appreciate some gags that the previous poor picture quality had hidden.

The DVD extras are fantastic (each individual movie also comes with an entire second disc with nothing but special features).  Deleted scenes are included, as are theatrical trailers (most of which are from later re-releases of the films).  But the best features are the mini-documentaries included with each movie.  They're quite good managing to maintain a good balance between interview footage and modern interpretation.

This set is invaluable for Chaplin fans.  Chaplin was a genius of filmmaking and his movies finally have the release that they deserve.  I'm now eagerly looking forward to delving through the second box set in this Chaplin DVD series, and I can only hope that it's as brilliant as this one is.",1093651200,,2703,4.8791208791208796
1881207,4,B000096IBH,"My God, what courage Chaplin had in making this!  He did what so desperately needed to be done, and what no one else was willing to do: show how absurd, hateful, and inhuman the dictatorships of Mussolini and especially Hitler really were.  Almost everyone was against him in making this, either because they were afraid of the effect it would have on the German market for Hollywood films, or because they were afraid that the German Jews would receive even worse treatment at the hands of the Nazi's because of this picture.  My definition of a great, heroic human being is one that sees what needs to be done, and despite great opposition does it anyway; I don't think anyone could argue with me when I say Chaplin was a hero, according to this definition.  The speech at the end of the film is not artistically necessary or even connected with the rest of the film, but Chaplin had to have his say, and what a say it is!  This speech appeals to the very best in us, and while it leaves the execution of its divine vision ambiguous, we nevertheless have a goal to work towards, and I found myself looking at the problems around me in a different way after I saw it for the first time.

  Chaplin achieves his principal goals as outlined above wonderfully, but unfortunately, the material surrounding this is uneven in execution and, for me, detracts from the potent message of the film.  There are moments of briliance which could only have come from Chaplin, such as the often mentioned dance of lust for world domination that Hynkel has with an inflated globe, the incomparably sad moment when the Barber watches his shop and home go up in flames, and many others, but there are also jarring parts.  Although many people seem to like Jack Oakie's portrayal of Mussolini, going so far as to say it steals the show, I find it to be too loud and overbearing for my taste (I understand that it is supposed to show how ridiculously pompous Mussolini was, but Oakie's performance is just beyond believable for me, damaging the effect of the satire).  Also Paulette Goddard, wonderful as she was in Modern Times, just doesn't work well with the dialogue here, with an obvious New York accent that jars with Hannah's German Jewish background.  Even Chaplin's technique, well nigh infallible in the 1920's and 1930's, has embarassing lapses, for example the WWI airplane sequence (funny, but irrelevant to the plot and embarassingly amateurish looking), the scene where the Barber first meets Hannah (hitting people on the head with a frying pan is funny here, but jarringly Keystone-ish, not fitting at all well with Chaplin's wonderful satire elsewhere), the scene with the Mussolini character getting off the train (funny at first, but went on so long that the laughs dried up before the end), and elsewhere.

  In short, Chaplin has an important message to deliver, and does so powerfully, but if some of the rough edges could have been smoothed out, this film could have had a much greater impact for me, easily a contender for Chaplin's greatest film, hence one of the greatest films of all time.  Much as I would like to give The Great Dictator five stars, I can in honesty only give it four, but that should not discourage you from buying this DVD (incidentally including a superb TCM documentary on the film and on the eerie parallels between Chaplin, and Hitler, his opposite), and watching a historically important film with moments of incomparable brilliance.",1092268800,,3467,4.753333333333333
1881208,5,B000096IBH,"His statement can be found in the second disc of this set which contains interviews with family and friends of Chaplin, historians and even some of Hitler's associates.  I hadn't planned on watching that one, but now I can't imagine not having the first disc without the second.  That supplementary disc, narrated by Kenneth Branagh puts into proper perspective the making of this controversial, but classic film which debuted in October of 1940.

Throughout the movie, the scenes alternate between events in the ghetto of the amnesiac barber and the world of Hynkel whose administration is dominated by Herr Garbitsch, the Minister of the Interior, later promoted to Secretary of the Interior, Minister of Propaganda and Field Marshall Herring, Minister of War.  The scenes with the two dictators, Hynky, the Phooey of Tomainia, and the Il Dig a Dichy, Benzino Napaloni, the dictator of Bacteria are my favorites.

I didn't think this movie was as funny as Modern Times; I wasn't laughing as hard!  However, I've now changed my mind.  I love this movie; I find myself chuckling over so many of the scenes and, like one of the film critics interviewed in the Tramp and the Dictator, felt ""deeply moved"" at the ending when the jewish barber, mistaken for his excellency Adenoid Hynkel, dictator of Tomainia, addresses the sons and daughters of the double cross with an apology and an admission that he didn't want to be an emperor any more, followed by a speech Chaplin had hoped would move others to stop the violence and keep the world from war.  If coups could only be so easy and bloodless!

I hadn't realized that this country had some semblance of fascism brewing in our midst around the time of the second world war.  That fact is revealed in The Tramp and the Dictator as well as the fact that Chaplin left this country in the fifties during the upheavals that occurred here during the McCarthy era when many persons' careers were irretrievably ruined.",1091836800,,1959,4.838323353293413
1881209,4,B000096IBH,"When Chaplin began planning his next film in 1937, criticizing the rise of fascism in Europe and condemning the treatment of the Jewish people under Adolf Hitler were controversial ideas, although they would become more accepted by the time of the film's eventual release in 1940. Chaplin stated in later years that he would not -- could not -- have joked about conditions in Germany had he known the full extent of the Holocaust. But this was an important film to be made. When the world was hemming and hawing over what to do about this great evil, Chaplin didn't back down. Maybe not all of the comedy is as successful as it could have been, but the movie's heart is definitely in the right place.

 The film is divided roughly in half, with Chaplin playing the starring role in each segment (I've never understood the opening disclaimer stating that the resemblance of the dictator and the Jewish barber is entirely coincidental; the final portion of the film depends precisely on their similarity). The first role is the most obvious, given Chaplin's familiar mustache and general appearance. He plays Adenoid Hynkel, a very thinly veiled impersonation of Adolf Hitler. Chaplin's motivation appears to make Hitler look like a goofball -- the target of ridicule. He falls down stairs, he flies into a rage when his office supplies don't function correctly, and he plays a childish game of one-upmanship with his ""brother dictator"", Benzino Napaloni of Bacteria. In one of the film's most memorable sequences, he performs a dance with a globe of the Earth, happily gazing at all which he hopes to conquer. It's a bizarrely wonderful moment -- funny, frightening and beautifully directed. And it surely can't be by chance that in the first shot of the globe itself, the Western Hemisphere -- the United States of America -- is what is pointed at the camera.

 The other part of the film is ultimately the most moving, especially from a modern day perspective. Chaplin's tramp had always been the everyman -- the little guy up against the world. Surely there had not been a more beloved character in the history of film than the diminutive beggar with his ill-fitting costume. Gaining sympathy for his cause is simplicity itself; take this adored tramp who has entertained millions and turn him into a Jewish barber living in central Europe. Seeing this wonderful and charming character thrown into the horrors of a ghetto in Germany during WWII is shocking. It's almost inconceivable to imagine the fictional tramp existing in the same world as the horrors of Nazi Germany. In earlier films, we never really feared for the tramp's safety; we always knew he'd figure some way out of trouble. But here, he's powerless. He must run away. He can't simply kick the policeman in the butt and scamper to victory. It's a subtle but important difference from his other films. His adversaries until now had been easily defeated heavies. But now he's up against something horrible and real. He's dragged across a street, beaten and almost hanged by stormtroopers. The word ""Jew"" is painted on the front of his shop. His home is burnt to the ground. He retains his humor, his hope and his will to fight, but he needs the world's help -- which is one of the movie's messages.

 Chaplin's final speech, where he breaks character and vehemently decries fascism, hate and bigotry, has been called overwrought and schmaltzy. I disagree. I get goose bumps every time I hear it. As one of the interviewees on the DVD documentary states, ""He said what had to be said."" It's fascinating from a historical point of view. There are plenty of propaganda films from WWII (which is what this basically is when you boil down to it), but how many of them appeal to basic human decency instead of blunt patriotism?

 One of the DVD extras is a documentary, THE TRAMP AND THE DICTATOR, produced by Turner Classic Movies. This is actually really good. Showing footage from the movie next to newsreels of Hitler just goes to demonstrate how spot-on Chaplin's impersonation was. Fascinating is the inclusion of excerpts from one of the worst Nazi propaganda films (""The Eternal Jew"" -- a hateful piece of appalling racism) which features Chaplin's 1931 visit to Berlin and denouncing him in a series of racial epitaphs. The discussion as to the appropriateness of laughing about something evil as Hitler is touched on and the topic is worthy of debate.

 Also included is some recently discovered color footage shot on the set of the film by Charlie's brother, Sydney. It's also included in its entirety as an extra, but it works better when excerpts are seen in the documentary. The footage by itself is relatively boring for most of the time; the documentary uses the most interesting material. On the other hand, I was amused by Sydney Chaplin's focusing in on seemingly every woman present during the filming of the ballroom dance scene.

 The movie does have its weak points. The WWI portions are more silly than genuinely funny (though I've mellowed to the upside-down airplane gag the more times I've seen it). And although Jack Oakie's performance as a Mussolini-clone was inspired, one feels that the movie is biting off more than it can chew by including both dictators. As a result, some portions dealing with their relationship drags. So too does the whole Commander Schultz subplot. Additionally, a lot of the humor seems somewhat stuck between being silent and being talkie. But for all of the flaws, this is still an excellent movie that I appreciate it a little more on each viewing. Perhaps not the best Chaplin film, but it definitely has something to say.",1091491200,,5643,4.848390446521288

1881211,5,B000096IBH,"This film is an excellent piece of anti-axis propaganda in the guise of a hilarious satire of totalitarianism. Chaplin portays two characters who's resemblance to one another is merely coincidental.  One is a Adenoid Hynkel, dictator of Tomania with a jewish name, the other a Jewish barber with impeccable instincts for sussing out trouble. Overall, ""The Great Dictator"" attempts to demonstrate the idiocy of war.  By turning the key players into buffoons, it portays the war machine as a circus.  This film is much more than a lampoon of the Nazis, however.  The silliest characature of all is of Benito Mussolini.  Jack Oakie's portrayal of the Dictator of Bacteria,  Benzino Napaloni, is the highlight of the film.  He's like a stereotype of one of those ""larger-than-life"" tourists who bluster with absolute authority wherever he goes. It is really hard not to picture him in the loudest hawaiian shirt  know to man.  It is really obscenely funny.  The interaction between  the two dictators provides the most sustained lunacy in the film. Their attempts to one-up one another are just brilliant.
""The Great Dictator"" does have an extremely serious side. There is an attempt to portray the plight of the displaced Jews with care and much pathos.  It works, more or less. The Jewish Ghetto is given enough attention that the viewer develops a connection with them as they attempt to get on with their lives.  Maurice Moscovitch as Mr. Jaeckel is particularly effective.  Paulette Goddard plays Hannah as a rather dim, dreamy stumblebum. She's cute, but occasionally annoying.  Sometimes, it feels like Chaplin has transported Hannah back to the Wizard of Oz--she speaks in that same half-whimpering, dreamy manner as Judy Garland's Dorothy.
Finally, this film certainly transcends any single political agenda.  The only agenda one can associate with it is the aim to bring laughter to a world torn asunder by the vagaries of milatary posturings. It seems telling (to me, at least), that Adolf Hitler viewed this film twice.  I have always been curious as to what his thoughts were on this total classic send-up of the great men of the Blood-Axis in their own time. Perhaps by the end of the first viewing, he perceived that Mussolini got the worst of it. Then he watched it again--this time with pleasure. If you can't laugh at yourself...",1088380800,,2343,4.997422680412371
1881212,5,B000096IBH,"DVD is the perfect medium for many of Chaplin's films. He demanded a lot from his audience. Each film carries it's own message. Each section of a film addresses a part of that film's message. Every facet of a work has a purpose. He lightened the load through the use of humour. The viewer has to be thinking every minute though. It's possible to watch these films time and again, or to watch different segments repeatedly and keep finding something more. They really are that complex. Fortunately, the DVD medium makes doing that easy.
The Great Dictator is as relevant today as it was when it skewered Hitler and his gang of Fascist bigots back in 1940. It took aim at Hitler but its target could easily be any warmongering regime from any period of history. The parallels are all there. Chaplin addresses each of them and does it well. His character Hynkel is a bumbling and ineffective ""leader"". He's driven by greed. As the film unfolds it's obvious his greed is rooted in feelings of inferiority. The more his mouth moves the less he says. His economic policies are a disaster-to wage war he has to borrow money from the ""enemy"". He is petty beyond belief. Ultimately, without an ""enemy"" to point toward, he's nothing. His entire mantra-loss of liberty, racial persecution, lust for control and so on-is all for one thing: he has to cover the fact that he can't rise to the level of the most humble of those he torments. This is a fundamental truth about people who lust for conquest. Chaplin illustrates it brilliantly.
The film isn't perfect. Chaplin and his crew weren't entirely comfortable when working with sound. Many scenes have dialogue but lack background noise. It was a common fault of the time though. The players have an assortment of accents. The Tomanians (with the exception of Herring) sound British. As the Jewish barber Chaplin sounds British. Many of the Jews in the Ghetto sound Jewish but Palette Goddard as Hannah, sounds as if she came from Queens. There are at least a couple of interludes that interfere with the continuity of the film. These are small complaints though. There are many scenes that have never been bettered. One is the episode with the coins and the cakes. On its own it's pure comedic brilliance. Combined with the statement it makes about the utter ridiculousness of martyrdom for its own sake (not to mention the unwillingness of leaders to become martyrs) it's timeless. The scene with the cannon is a gem. The ""ultimate"" weapon is shown as the ultimate (and expensive) waste; this could easily be the Crusader Artillery System. The tenderness between Chaplin and Goddard is a thing of beauty. Jack Oakie is fabulous as a Mussolini clone. The scenes between him and Chaplin are hilarious. (Watch the scene with the hot mustard and do some thinking.) The innuendo in the film is brilliant. Who but Chaplin would conceive of Tomainia (after ""Ptomaine, poisonous and putrefying organic matter), the ""Sons of the Double Cross"" or Hynkel's first name, ""Adenoid""? The entire backdrop with its ""Thinkers of Tomorrow"" and other absurdities modeled on the vanity of the Dictator is amazing; it captures the madness completely. The ballet with the globe is beautiful and astonishing. The music representing the ideals for the greedy and the humble is identical. The message: people are alike. As is the norm for Chaplin he did it in a way that was subtle; it's the theme of the Grail Knight descending from Wagner's Lohengrin. Hitler loved Wagner's music. Chaplin would have known that. It's his way of saying Wagner's music wasn't to blame for Hitler's madness. There's more but this should give an idea.
What nobody seeing the film for the first time can be prepared for however, is the way it ends. I wasn't. I saw a few of Chaplin's films as a student but had missed this one. I was floored. His statement about the nature of the people who make war is valid in any age. It always will be.
Watch it and then look closely at the events of the present.",1087084800,,3997,4.744252873563219
1881213,5,B000096IBH,"Charles Chaplin was the greatst cinematic genius of the 20th century. His brilliance was celebrated and recognized for decades, but then America brutally turned against him. How it grieved him that his adopted homeland, the country that had given him fame, riches and untold fortune, denounced him as a Communist and basically didn't allow him back into the country. What a singular disgrace. His story is told magnificently in these four films, spanning thirty years. We open up with the little tramp and conclude with the haunting, depressing, yet poignant ""Limelight."" This last film is my favorite of them all, with Charlie's unique, beautiful voice speaking so softly to a 19 year-old Claire Bloom. It was send chills down your spine to see his work (finally) restored to its original glory. The final scene, with Keaton standing behind, when they slowly draw the sheet over his face signifies the artistic death of Charlie Chaplin. No one went out with more grace and pathos.
If you're a long-time Chaplin fan or a Charlie newbie, this set has something for everyone, from the globe dance in ""The Great Dictator"" to the depressing scenes of Calvero unable to make his audience laugh anymore. It's all here and it will touch anyone with a love of film. There was only Chaplin and this set shows the entire spectrum. My highest recommendation.",1081728000,,1347,4.938325991189427

I have to say that I thoroughly enjoy all his films, even the more obscure ones that weren't necessarily box office hits.  But of all his films I believe ""The Great Dictator"" to be his masterpiece.  ""The Gold Rush"" may have been the film in which he wanted to be remembered, and it is certainly a great film, but this film is working on so many levels as to seem superior to me.  Sufficed to say, I love satire.  This film is loaded with satirical referrences and subtle and not-so-subtle wit and clever word-play as well as all the brilliant physical humor that initially made Chaplin famous.  There is so much intelligence in this film that it is easy for me to praise and recommend.  I could relate scenes that I absolutely loved, but there are too many to name; and I certainly don't want to ruin all the comedic surprises for those who have yet to see this film.  Even after ten viewings I find myself laughing at Chaplin's antics: verbal and physical humor of the highest level.  In fact, I guarrantee laughter.  There is so much humor here, of so many varieties, that there is no doubt in my mind that anyone viewing this film for the first time with giggle, chuckle, then laugh heartily.

The way that Chaplin abruptly switches from light-hearted comedy and parody into moral finger-pointing and back again, destroys the flow and consistency of the film.  It feels long, bloated and self-indulgent at turns...I kept thinking, ""this guy Chaplin needs a good strong producer who'll trim out all the fat 'cause this movie's just bulging!""  There is no momentum and no clear direction...wish someone could've put this one on the Atkins diet!
What an unfortunate waste of Chaplin's considerable comic gifts.

The facts, however, say it all.
This film was made at a time when most of America was anti-semitic, when no one wanted to think of getting involved with Europe's affairs, and when Chaplin's own art of pantomime had been lost in the onslaught of 'talkies'.
And for Chaplin to choose *this* premise for his farewell to the little Tramp-- turning his Tramp into a Jew and turning himself into Adolf Hitler-- well, it's nothing short of daring.
For those that prefer Charlie as just the funny little fellow, and not his serious side, there's enough slapstick in this film to satisfy even them: the comedic highs are the moments when no words are needed-- the misplaced grenade, the dance with the globe, or the shaving scene to Brahm's Hungarian Dance. But the film IS at its best when Chaplin's Adenoid Hynkel is shown as a stark raving madman, and he with Jack Oakie's 'Napaloni' expose the true ridiculousness and lunacy of it all.
Cynics have been known to call this film 'preachy', but as far as I'm concerned, it was awful gutsy of Chaplin to speak out on the issue-- and not just speak out, but to point a finger right in the face of Fascism and to charge it as a 'blunder' of humanity. For him to be *successful* in making us laugh on a subject that, in its essence, is not funny in the least really is a testimony to his abilities as an actor.
His other films may be better than this one, and it's not my personal favorite of his work, BUT: **this** is the film that made Charlie a hero in my eyes.  And that sort of passion for speaking out in what you believe deserves Five stars anyday!",1074297600,,1710,4.4113924050632916

As Chaplin pushes these issues he offers the audience a farce based on the Nazi leader Adolf Hitler, who was actually a very real threat at the time of the film's release.  As the story unfolds, the Tramp is mistaken for the dictator Adenoid Hynkel.  This leads to several scenes with situational comedy and slapstick humor, however, it is Chaplin personal touch that gives the film a true meaning beyond the humor.  In its historical context this film should also be considered one of the most courageous cinematic creations ever made.

His impeccibly limber gesturing, sense of timing and evocative facial features have made him a landmark artist, a masterful film maker and one of the greatest talents to ever grace the silver screen. What more can be said; does it get any better than the little tramp?!?  And now, Warner Home Video proves that it does, indeed get better; a lot, lot better.  Having had to contend with poorly transferred, badly worn VHS and primative bootlegged DVD copies for years, the home video audience at last gets to witness Charlie in his best video incarnation ever!  This box set features four classics from the Chaplin legacy; Modern Times, The Gold Rush, The Great Dictator and Limelight. In each case, Chaplin illustrates the art of making movies as no one before or since. Great fun!
THE TRANSFER: No expense has been spared in making each film sparkle as never before.  The gray scale is incredibly rich and beautifully balanced.  Blacks are deep.  Contrast levels show off Charlie's make up.  Fine detail is gloriously realized.  Minor edge enhancement and some pixelization do occur but nothing to distract or even hint that anything but absolute care has been taken to make these films look as good as they possibly can.  Almost all age related artifacts are gone.  Truly, I can't say enough to recommend these transfers.  The audio is mono and nicely balanced.
EXTRAS: Each disc comes with a brief featurette on Chaplin's legacy and some interesting supplimental extras including outtakes in some cases and interviews in others.

1881224,5,B000096IBH,"After my gross disappointment at the edition of The Gold Rush that's part of this series, I'm happy to discover that the other releases seem to be much better.
The Great Dictator has never been one of my favourite Chaplin films, probably because it's so dependent on its own specific timeframe. Many details in this film do hinder its effect: Chaplin's very theatrical dialogue delivery, complete with a British accent which jars mightily with the German and Jewish characters he's playing, especially when mixed with the hilarious ""faux German"" he employs for the role of Adenoid Hynkel; the corny music, which verges on the melodramatic and sounds syrupy especially during dramatic climaxes; the wandering central narrative; and the final speech, where overly florid writing and delivery make the central message sound less heartfelt than it could have been.
But perhaps director Sydney Lumet says it best: ""[The final speech] was inartistic; I don't care. Nothing has to be perfect."" And considering that Chaplin funded the film himself at enormous cost (559 days of production and post-production!) and took direct aim at Adolf Hitler, the film was still a massive achievement, a testament to the fearlessness of art and artists. And proof positive that such fearlessness is often rewarded, given the film's tremendous box-office success. Let that be a lesson to Hollywood.
The DVD extras are very good. The documentary ""The Tramp and the Dictator"", co-produced by both the BBC and Spiegel TV, sheds light on many aspects of the film's production and contextualizes Chaplin's life and filmmaking with the career of Adolf Hitler clearly and engagingly. It also features excellent narration by Kenneth Branagh. The colour footage shot by Sydney Chaplin is just priceless -- it's eye-opening to see the staging of the film in colour form, using different angles. There's also a scene that was cut from the earlier Chaplin short ""Sunnyside"" which may have informed the ""Hungarian Dance No. 5"" sequence in The Great Dictator.",1059436800,,2024,5.192660550458716

1881228,4,B000096IBH,"The Great Dictator is the first Charlie Chaplin movie I have seen and it is the one that I had been looking forward to the most.  This was the fist all-talking movie that Charlie Chaplin made and it was the last appearance of Chaplin's famous character: The Tramp.  This movie is filmed to the brim with a serious social and political message and satire.
Charlie Chaplin plays two roles.  The first role is a dictator named Adenoid Hynkel.  Hynkel is the dictator of Tomania.  Tomania is a nation that is a mirror image of Nazi Germany and Hynkel is very obviously Hitler.  Hynkel and Tomania are persecuting the Tomanian Jews.  The other role Chaplin plays is a Jewish barber, a war hero just returning home after the first World War after being in a hospital for nearly a decade.  He doesn't know what had happened or why people are afraid of the Tomanian Stormtroopers.  The barber also happens to look identical to Hynkel.  Paulette Goddard (Chaplin's real life wife at the time) plays the love interest for the barber.  Jack Oake plays Benzino Napaloni (a spoof on Mussolini), the Dictator of Bacteria.
The Jewish Barber returns home years later and finds that he now lives in a Jewish ghetto.  Since he doesn't quite know what is going on he resists the efforts of the Nazis to label his shop a Jewish shop and also directly resists the Nazi soldiers by bumbling his way through a fight sequence that could only be done by Chaplin.  At the same time, Hynkel is consolidating his power by giving speeches that sound spot on like Hitler...only the German/Tomanian words are clearly nonsense.  The crackdown on the Jews continues and the Barber meets his love interest.  We see the famous scene where Hynkel, in his dreams of world domination, has a little dance routing with a large inflatable globe.  By the end there is a mistake in identity and the Barber is able to give a strong speech in favor of democracy.  The entire movie is a satire of Hitler and the Nazi era in Germany and helps show how stupid the Nazi position really was.  Remember this film was released in 1940 (though conceived in the mid 30's) and we did not quite know the extent of the Nazi brutality.
I will admit that this film did not quite live up to my unreasonable expectations, but this was an enjoyable film.  From what I know, this is not quite vintage Tramp (for that, Modern Times is probably the answer) but is a classic and a defining picture in the career of Charlie Chaplin.",1057708800,,2465,4.574031890660592
1881229,5,B000096IBH,"Here is Chaplin at his directorial best.  In this film, he takes on the role of director, writer, performer, and composer.  When the ""talkies"" first appeared on the scene in the late '20s, Chaplin was hesitant about giving his Tramp a voice.  However, he knew he had to jump at the opportunity of capitalizing on his character's physical similarities to Hitler (for both critical and financial reasons).  The diversity of this single film is its greatest accomplishment: social commentary, dramatic undertones, and comic situations.  Even the comic situations are diverse with the classic silent slapstick that made Chaplin famous, as well as the use of sound for verbal irony and a perfectly casted loud-mouth Mussolini-like character.  And the last speech will leave you in chills.  Certainly a must have.",1054771200,,807,5.209302325581396

He plays two role; one as a dictator to beat Napolean to invading Ostervich and then taking over the world, and one is a barber in the Ghetto, where he meets a girl he likes (as usual). No matter how serious it gets, there's at least 3 funny things every minute. But it'll probably take you a good 5 or 7 times watching to actually understand the entire subject of the film. After the barber Chaplin becomes a soldier and helps Commander Schultz escape in his plane, they crash and the war has long been over, Chaplin's side losing. When he is fully recovered from his mental disorder, he returns home to his barber but starts fighting storm troopers. Soon they try to hang him when he meets with Commander Schultz. Meanwhile, the dictator is trying every which way to invade Ostervich with his two helpers, Garbage and Herring. When they find out that Napolean wants to take over Ostervich, too, the dictator invites him to Tomania to talk things out. And as soon as they do, the dictator takes over Ostervich. But the storm troopers got hold of the wrong Chaplin so the barber is the one that has to make the speech. I'm sure Chaplin fans will love this. You will see that there are funny parts everywhere, like Chaplin tripping, holding the dirty baby, slapping Herring, modeling for a statue and painting, ripping up papers in anger, the German speech in the beginning, and many, many more.

While faimiliarity of the era and historical events helps in one's appreciation of this film-the overall message is timeless-the struggle between freedom versus tyranny and persecution. Chaplin's speech at the end is a classic piece of literature on its own.

Actors and technicians were sworn to silence; reporters were barred from the entrance, dodged on queries; even the respectable magazine of the day, LIFE was sued when it printed a portrait of Chaplin as Hynkel without his permission.  In this little gem from 1940, Chaplin plays a bewildered little soldier of the World War.  His German officers bully him and the German war machinery overwhelms and all but swallows him.  An Attack of amnesia releases him.  As a shy little barber in the Berlin ghetto, her tries to resume life in a world where little men count only as pawns for the mad aspirations of Hynkel, the dictator.............he finds love and the persecution of the Jews.  Chaplin's voice had never been heard by movie audiences until this came out; it's the only one to cry out in a wilderness of force.

1881234,5,B000096IBH,"Charlie Chaplin said that once he made The Great Dictator, his first all-sound movie, it was time to retire the ""little fellow,"" but I could not help but feel he was wrong. How much do I love this movie? I first saw it in a movie theater in college (a revival). I later was over in Spain freelancing for various newspapers and I saw it dubbed into Spanish in early 1976: Spanish dictator Francisco Franco had just kicked the bucket and this flick, banned by him since its original release, was released. Audiences stood up and cheered at the top of their lungs when the Jewish barber (the classic tramp character), having mistakeningly traded places with the Hitler-like dictator (also played by Chaplin), delivered a rousing speech about liberty and humanity. I saw this movie 13 times in Spanish and it helped me learn the language (I did news features on its 1976 release in Spain for The Christian Science Monitor and other papers, plus one for the international edition of Newsweek). Then I came back to the United States, bought it on video and watched it about 20 more times. Why do I LOVE this movie -- and recommend everyone who can afford it buy it? A lot of reasons: a)Classic comedy bits. The timing as usual is superb. There are a slew of bits, such as the Jewish barber shaving a nervous customer in time to classical music, that are absolutely hilarious. b)Classic slapstick: the food fight between the Hitler-like dicator and the absolutely nutty Mussolini-like dicator played by a scene stealing Jack Oakie is worth the price of the tape (ANYONE who likes slapstick including Stooges fans would love it!), c)The no-mercy satirization of Hitler and his regime; Chaplin later said he wouldn't have done it if he knew had brutal Hitler had been but it still has never been matched, d)the dictator's loving play with the world globe, e)the serious message about humanity and religious freedom, f)the speech on freedom at the end. A word on this: critics sometimes called this speech jarring. It was to me the first time I saw it. But it clearly is the actor speaking to the world, delivering a message that transcends a movie or theaterical piece. It is from Chaplin's soul and deeply felt. And given the historical context this speech is remarkable. If I had ONE Chaplin movie to show to high school students this would be it.

There is even a cameo role for Mussolini  (senor Napolioni of ""Bacteria"").Especially funny are Chaplin's  spoofs of Hitler's speeches____all ticks and mannerisms included!  I don't  want to give away the end of this movie( which is sobering) but can tell  you that after seeing it you will never be able to watch one of those WW-II  documentaries without getting a chuckle out of them!",967939200,,811,5.2578125
1881240,5,B000096IBH,"Hello my name is Amy and I'm 15. My dad got me into Charles Chaplin and I love him. ""The Great Dictator"" was one of the best movies I have seen of his.(Maybe because he was talking.) My dad told me the movie was on but I wasn't interested at first but then I went to go watch it and I didn't want to leave. I'm totally into old movies but Charles Chaplin is one of the best actors and he plays two great roles in this film. This movie will really make you laugh, But it also has a great point to it. It shows some comdey, liberty, and justice to all people. It is a great movie to show to your kids and anyone else you love. It would be a movie that everyone in the family would love to watch. Everyone in the cast all did very well on playing thier role. I hope you all enjoy the movie and I recommend it to everyone. Thank you all for reading my review!  Sincerly,  Amy Jones",967507200,,877,3.9213483146067416
1881241,5,B000096IBH,"One of the greatest satires ever filmed and Chaplin's most fully realized comedy.  A beautiful blend of the usual Chaplin slapstick and pathos along with a very effective social and political commentary.  Charlie is Adenoid  Hynckle, dictator of an only slightly fictional country of Tomania.  He  also plays a Jewish ghetto barber.  Both are played with such impeccable  accuracy that to distinguish between them is extremely easy. Names are  changed but this film is still the most effective film of Nazi Germany and  Hitler's thankfully aborted attempt to take over the world.  Chaplin's  script never gets too preachy at least without an equal dose of satire.  His approach is to make people laugh while teaching them at the same time.  Nowhere is this more apparent than in his final monologue.  After a  predictable mistaken identity episode, Chaplin as the unnamed Jewish barber  speaks of the horrors of Nazism.  This climazes what may be the greatest  performance in the history of comedy films.  The greatest because it does  more than simply make us laugh-it makes us think.  The film earned Chaplin  well deserved Oscar nominations for Best  Picture, Screenplay and  Actor.  This is a film you must see.",958176000,,1215,5.0456852791878175
1881242,5,B000096IBH,"Charlie Chaplin showed in The Great Dictator that he was a genius in sound as he was on the silent screen. Combining Hynkel the Dictator with a very  meek Jewish barber whom suffers alongside the other Jews under Hynkel's  tyranny, he made a very powerful statement against the Nazi regime. Even  though Hitler has thankfully been gone for several decades, the film still  is worth viewing and enjoying, and it is definitely one of Charlie's best.",941414400,,447,4.842105263157895
1881243,5,B000096IBH,"A daring commentary, prophecy, and spoof of Adolph Hitler made before the full horrors of the Nazi regime were known. Chaplin's concluding speech regarding humanity might be equalled only by Lincoln's Gettysburg Address.  In the speech, Chaplin refers to the scriptural passage of St. Luke Chapter  17: ...behold, the Kingdom of God is within you. He makes but a subtle  mention of this, but it is the foundation of the speech...and it is the  foundation of Chaplin and his work: that we must RESPECT not only ourselves  but ALL of humanity. For within us ALL is the Kingdom of God!",913507200,,582,4.78

Unfunny. I didn't laugh once. I was amazed at this. Such a cited and acclaimed movie. Recommend to me by the mass media a million times over. I watched it twice to make sure I wasn't missing something. This films only purpose is only to make you feel sympathy for the (((chosen))) people.
