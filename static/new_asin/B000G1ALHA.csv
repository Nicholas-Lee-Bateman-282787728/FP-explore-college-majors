8128249,3,B000G1ALHA,"Boy, I must have forgotten how long ago 2006 was.  The production value is pretty good still, but some of those songs really felt old.  I'm not sure I was the target audience here.  I wanted to learn to dance to pop music, and while some of this stuff was useful, I did feel like the routines were basic, and some of the moves felt like I was exercising versus dancing. The DVD was about 40 minutes long including introduction and credits, but 7 routines did feel like plenty. Overall, if you really enjoy the songs in this DVD and want to dance to them, or if you are inspired to learn a few routines for school or for fun, then you might like this.  But if you're looking for a good instructional video, then I might look to learn ""how to dance"" elsewhere.",1320451200,,758,4.243055555555555
8128250,3,B000G1ALHA,"This is done on an all white stage you see demonstrated by the 3 preteen & teenage girls & 2 guys you see. The production & sound quality are great. The songs demonstrated are: Rock your body, You make me wanna, Don't stop movin', Just a little bit, Sound of the underground, The tide is high, Opps, I did it again.

Paulette is only a voice over counting & telling you the move like ""snake, shake your body, left kick & right arm out...""

Each song starts with the music playing softly with one of the dancers show you ONLY the chorus moves with a break in between, the moves themselves are still done in normal speed. The chorus is only 10-15 moves, most are repeated. Then the song is started again in full volume & the rest of the dancers start the routine. They all dance normal speed & up to you to watch & figure out the moves & do them. Considering most videos have dancers doing different moves at once, you see this hear to & up to you to pick which dancer you want to concentrate on. When they do the chorus 2-3x, least then you have no problems. The pace of the dvd is ok overall, I didn't get bored.

This may seem practically impossible, but what helps is the camera doesn't move too much, the lighting doesn't blink too much to be any distraction, etc. which is a huge difference from the videos.

But from what I can tell, the moves seem to have been simplified a bit from the original. Half the time I thought the moves were a bit... like fake punching, etc. Some moves are cool, some taught, most not. But even in the normal speed, if you have the patience to watch it over & over most people should get it.

The walking around a lot IS in the videos & also since on the video the choreography is almost never done all one shot, that's probably why there's even more aimless walking around & stepping forward & back.

If the dvd actually showed the full out moves in all it's complexity, showed the move a little slower &/or built it up if very complex, no annoying 5-7 second rests in between each move, I would give it 5 stars.

I rented this dvd since I want to learn how to dance no matter the style or who teaches it, as long as it's not boring.",1175990400,3,2168,4.197115384615385
8128251,2,B000G1ALHA,I expected this DVD to contain a bit more information than just simple dance moves like walking in a circle and clapping your hands to your heart. I also was disappointed because it had choreographed dance moves to particular songs - and only a handful of songs. It was also boring to watch and listen to - the songs were not even sung by the popular artists that sing them on the radio.,1167782400,7,387,4.315068493150685
