8541488,3,B009H3LOLA,"The DVDs are a waste of time. They could have been left out of the book. They are redundant and non-informational. I felt like trashing them. I thought the video footage was going to be special and interesting about Michael, but instead it fell flat and worthless. The book has nice photos and quotes from Michael, though I didn't actually read the book from front to back yet, I think that the written contents are words that are not ""new"" to most of Michael's True Fans. Overall, it was a good buy, if only to see more beautiful photos of Michael.",1367798400,4,549,4.445544554455446
