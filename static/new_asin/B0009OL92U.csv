In BLACK GOLD (1936), a Poverty Row adventure set in an oil field, director Hopton cameos as ""Joe.""

This tiny-budget programmer is from CONN Pictures, one of the smallest of the small studios. In their four years of existence, CONN regularly turned out mostly throwaway westerns featuring 'B' grade stars Kermit Maynard and Tim McCoy. With their non-westerns, handsome but vertically-challenged Frankie Darro often led casts of not inconsiderable quality.

BLACK GOLD is a good example of CONN in its prime. Perhaps to save time and capital, the story opens with a montage of oil field footage, including grimy roughnecks hard at work. Much of the story does unfold on a real oil rig, undoubtedly a nearby one that never produced or maybe ran dry. In any case, having this working derrick available frees the film from being studio-bound on barebones sets, although we do spend a bit of time in such settings.

Frank Shannon (as Frankie Darro's dad) is a long-time field worker who's gone wildcatter. At age 50, he hopes to bring in a well that will provide for his son's future. The rig and land were sold to Shannon by local financier Berton Churchill, the usurious villian of our story, because Churchill was convinced the spot is worthless.

But all indications are Shannon is about to tap into the dead center of a huge oil field. Churchill, with the help of right-hand thug Stanley Field, is determined to see that Shannon fails, so he can reclaim the property and hit ""black gold"" himself. Standing in Churchill's way are Shannon, roughneck-in-training Darro, and Roy Mason, the tall, silent, handsome hero of our story who plans to help all the local widcatters in their fight against evil Churchill.

Sure there's predictable plot points, like pretty schoolteacher Gloria Shea, who romances Mason when she's not fighting Frankie's chronic hooky-playing, and of course sabotage, a calculated death, plus one bang-up finale that precedes the requisite happy ending.

BLACK GOLD is worth an hour of your time. Certainly there's far worse back alley Hollywood stuff out there.

Also with George Cleveland, 'Snowflake' Toones (comic relief, natch) and Dewey Robinson (as the big dumb henchman).",1407888000,,2278,5.058666666666666

The film begins at an old refinery, they show various views of machinery, then many oil derricks. ""Fishtail"" is the young man's nickname. Clifford is truant from school. His father wants the best for him. Mr. O'Riley visits Mr. Anderson to borrow $500 to continue drilling; he is refused. O'Riley will lose his lease if he doesn't strike oil. In school the children are taught Evolution. Agriculture and living in caves marked modern man. Later someone sabotaged the oil well! What can they do? A stranger, Henry Langford, offers help to continue drilling. Henry encourages Clifford to continue his schooling. Mr. Anderson exploits the small oil well owners by under-payments. The small owners meet in a tavern to organize as a group. After the meeting Langford is beaten as a warning.

Then one of the cables starts to go, Dan O'Riley falls to his death! Langford found traces of corrosive acid on the cable, it wasn't an accident. Why? Greed for oil, black gold. Anderson has a new plan to grab O'Riley's well. Stevens kidnaps Langford and takes him to an isolated cottage in the mountains. Clifford goes to see Anderson, who wants to buy him out. ""You're full of bunk!"" Can Langford escape? The group meets for action against Anderson. His gang attacks the O'Riley well. The explosion blows up the well. Debris falls on Anderson's car. The unintended consequence is an oil gusher! This will allow Clifford to attend a military school to become a gentleman. The ending shows the boys bearing arms. [The 1968 Gun Control Act would later ban this right.]

This story repeats a theme common to popular movies of that era. Only united action by the people can defeat the ""malefactors of great wealth"". How does that work today?",1265155200,,1886,4.796923076923077
8064198,3,B0009OL92U,"Frankie Darro's cinema appearances are never less than tolerable, as is the case here, an action/adventure affair with oil drilling forming its background, a quite popular minimally budgeted effort that regularly played the side street ""B"" movie circuit for at least twelve years after its initial theatrical release, its title becoming a mimetic phrase for crude oil, and although the plot is somewhat hackneyed, a capable cast makes the most of thin material.  Darro plays as Clifford ""Fishtail"" O'Reilly, his nickname given him by his father Dan (Frank Shannon) after a drill bit used with rotary rigs during the early days of oil exploration that form the setting for the storyline.  When Dan falls to his death due to sabotage arranged by loan sharking J.G. Anderson (Berton Churchill) who wishes to take possession by default of the well, Clifford must decide if he will continue in working the site wherein he has spent many of his ripening years.  His initial uncertainty ceases when freelance geologist Hank Langford (Roy Mason) convinces him that the well is about to gush, additionally joining with Fishtail in working the rig, while being stimulated by the presence of Clifford's friend and guardian Cynthia (Gloria Shea).  Because Anderson's acquisitive interest in the affair is imperiled by Langford's involvement, the latter, as well as the younger O'Reilly, are soon in danger of losing more than eventual oil based income.  This is a short (53 min.) film, that is long on documentary montage of oil drilling techniques, additionally and quaintly supplied with two original musical numbers, one of which is sung by Darro and Mason.  It benefits from the able camerawork of Arthur Reed and strong turns are contributed by Darro, Mason and the beautiful Shea, with acting honours going to ever reliable Churchill, cast as leader of the Forces of Evil.",1170547200,2,1866,5.121710526315789
