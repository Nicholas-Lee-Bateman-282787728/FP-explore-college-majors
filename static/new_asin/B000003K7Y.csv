7902935,5,B000003K7Y,"When I was watching this episode, I finaly realized how evil Kai Win was.  I had missed a lot of the first few seasons, such as the Bajoran Revolution and the exitingof Kai Opaka, and at first thought of Win as just another side character.  But when I watched this episode, I realized she was as much of a dictator as anything.  it happened as soon as the Bajoran security guards walked into the hut where Kira and her former leader were located and said 'You are under arrest by order of the Kai,' for no other reason thans he wanted it to happen, she became the villan captains hate: in charge of a government who thinks she's wonderful, wanted to be remembered as great and willing to do anything to get there, and angery that the prophet is a non-Bajoran.
The last time I saw this episode, I didn't fully understand it, but since then, I've gotten a new under standing of military and political operations and dialogue (Thank you West Wing and Tom Clancy).  Kai became a spoiled girl in this episode.  By trying to coerce Sisko into giving her Federation help by withdrawing Bajoran application for membership, and by trying to arrest people for no reason, she became to me what I think the writers wanted her to be: someone who is in a position they should not be in, too small and too weak to do anything but what they want.",972432000,11,1330,4.412244897959184
