8247352,5,B0012R3DUO,"Oh, absolutely fantastic what this remarkable woman has done.  She came from parents who sang opera, spent some years trying other things like flamenco dancing and then, when her mother suggested that she start working with her daughter's voice, Cecilia was very receptive.  Because of her, I have again fallen in love with vocal music.
She is splendid.  People need to realize that what might be criticized...the rapid-fire delivery in melismatic passages, is the way singing occurred, at least in Bach's day.  Listen to a rendering of the Magnificat and you will understand why Ms. Bartoli sings the way she does.  Like so  many children who grew up with operatic singing parents, she develop perfect pitch early on.  This is lacking in many singers who have the voice but not the background of piano playing and hearing accurately whatever surrounded her in those early and formative years.  And there is no other way to deliver - like an externally-played musical instrument - the voice on those passages of notes other than to articulate each one.  Her smoothness of delivery over her entire range is phenomenal.  Many people have been influenced by her ability in a solo concert, to convey exquisitely, the emotions that fit with the words of the songs, no matter what the language.

Having been fortunate to have majored in music at a university where there were high level other developing musicians, it became evident that exposure to excellence has to be there from early on.  Hearing and seeing and doing.....is absorbed unconsciously and without duress in formative years.  Then to be later exposed to others, you are not afraid as you alreadyknow what they know, yourself.
The advantage, however, of growing up in Rome, a cultured environment where singing opera is like breathing, gave her a tremendous advantage of understanding what she heard, what she sang.  There is nothing in the way in pronunciation of anything Italian.....just think how hard it must be for an Asian budding singer...to have to learn a totally different thought-process for speaking English, German, French, Italian, Spanish.  But the do it!
I am just explaining that for C. Bartoli to sing Maria Malabran's roles, fitting for herself also, a mezzo-soprano herself  She has brought about more than one long-defunct development...that of other buried music that was just waiting for the right person to discover it in archives.  Ms. Bartoli has brought about music that a new generation will be able to learn and share with the world.  This might never have happened had she not found that being a coloratura mezzo soprano limited the known and available music that she was suited to sing.  Anything that had been pitch-raised from 430 to A440 changed where the break in the voice would naturally be as well as creating a more shrill sound.  She has educated us in many ways by refusing to sacrifice herself rather than to stand by what was actually correct when this music was created.  She has also brought about enormous exposure to the two wonderful leading early music groups using period instruments for a softer sound....and that has put them on the world map...those of La Scintilla (largely Zurich opera musicians) and la Giardelli  Armonica.

She has benefited from by absorbing:  1) early exposure to excellent Italian opera, 2) parents with splendid voices, 3) a culture all around her, being in Rome, and 4) opportunities to be herself but to be guided by an expert....her mother.
What a remarkable woman must be her mother....the very best vocal teacher and later, coach, as well as to be able to wisely impart guidance in her daughter's developing professional life.
So Cecilia Bartoli has the combination of her own beauty and self and that of another generation of wisdom, that being from her mother.  Phenomenal and not likely to be found in any other person to this extent in these areas.

We are so lucky to be able to procure recordings of this marvelous person and singer. nancy morse",1420243200,3,3994,4.950524737631184
8247353,5,B0012R3DUO,"What a remarkable DVD (2) by this very important artist, Cecilia Bartoli.

As a bicentennial celebration for the early important singer Maria Malibran (1808-1836) Bartoli tracks the career of Malibran around Europe and in the process you get to see behind the scenes the places where Malibran lived, sang, the scores she used the costunes she wore and the beautiful little opera house in Venice which still bears her name... The Teatro Mailbran and the story behind the naming of the theatre as a result of a sensational Malibran performance of La Sonnambula in Venice in April 1835.

In addition, Bartoli fill out the Malibran biography with a concert of the opera arias and songs that were sung all over Europe by Maria Malibran during her short tragic life. Malibran was only 28 years old when she died tragically from an accident. Yet her fame lives on to this day!

Highly educational and beautifully executed. Great credit to Bartoli and her team who put it all together. Well woth having.",1396483200,3,995,4.841176470588235
