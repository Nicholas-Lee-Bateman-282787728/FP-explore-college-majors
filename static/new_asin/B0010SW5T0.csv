3050025,1,B0010SW5T0,"I assure you, the people raving about this waste of time worked on this (notice the one guy raving about ""director Paul Borghese"" who couldn't direct his way out of a paperbag). Check out their ""reviews."" They have one. It's this movie. There should be a rule, if you worked on a video, you cannot go into the internet pretending to be a regular viewer raving about it. Even the most movie-deprived person having been living on an island for ten years who finally gets to see a movie and its this one would be screaming ""This sucked!""

This is another poorly cast and directed ""mob"" movie given a title that implies it's a ""classic"" when in reality, it's just insulting. I read the original title was ""Goat"" which is a very apropos title for this waste of time.

Here we get yet another ""mobster"" who tells what it's like being in the ""life"" for all us regular folk who don't know. However clearly the writers got all their ""this is how it is"" scenes from the same mob movies and shows we've all scene. It's just one mob cliche after another. We're introduced to a plethora of cliched mobsters one-after-another and each one is the same type of mobster we've seen a million times. Every one of these bad wannabe mob movies thinks they're the next Goodfellas and it's nothing but a bunch of bad actors in a movie shot on video trying hard to be film, poorly directed and acted.

I couldn't make it past 30 minutes. I'll give any film 30 minutes but it was painful, oh man. The lead guy is clearly wearing a wig, I'm wondering if we weren't supposed to know. He has absolutely no charisma and this is the guy they're hanging this movie on?

I try to find something positive about movies I watch but I couldn't in this thing. Absolutely terrible. AVOID",1369440000,3,1749,4.4392523364485985
3050026,5,B0010SW5T0,"Not only great writing and great direction by Paul Borghese, but his role as Agent Russo was subtle, understated and the perfect cherry on top. This was a really, really, entertaining movie and a lot of people put a lot of work into it. It was the director that made sure everything fell into place. He got the most out of his actors. I noticed interesting editing, angles, and other choices that took imagination and skill to execute. Very proud of Paul's work. Two thumbs up.  If I had another thumb, I just might add it.  Then, again, with these guys, you just might end up with someone else's thumb.",1369353600,,603,4.472727272727273

3050029,5,B0010SW5T0,"Action, drama - cars, girls and guns - it's all here. Once Upon a Time in Brooklyn knows what you want in a movie of this genre and definitely delivers. The cast is strong and the writing is sharp. This movie holds no punches, literally, and hits you with a couple of laughs from some clever screenwriters. Bobby's character played by William DeMeo is a tough guy right out of prison struggling with making the choice to go back to the life he knows or make his family proud. High adrenaline from the opening credits to an unexpected twist of an ending this is a movie you don't want to miss and without a doubt one to add to the collection!",1367625600,4,641,4.305785123966942

The acting is great and the story line moves a quick pace always keeping you on your toes.  I'm a fan of this genre so I guess I'm biased, but I can truly say that I enjoyed the entire film and the ending was pretty cool as well.",1367280000,3,356,3.9305555555555554

3050032,2,B0010SW5T0,"Not really worth purchasing. If you have a friend with this joint then you can just borrow theirs.

3050034,1,B0010SW5T0,It was like goodfellas played by amateur actors. Terrible movie !!!!!! If I had to to give this movie a rating it would not even be one star.,1374364800,,141,4.071428571428571
3050035,1,B0010SW5T0,Terrible movie!! Except for a few scenes with Armand Assante. Script was awful! Acting was worse. Ice Tee and Ja Rule were awful,1371945600,,128,4.608695652173913
3050036,3,B0010SW5T0,"Saw this a couple of days ago and thought it was pretty good. I don't think it's as bad as people are making it out to be, the movie has its moments, especially the ending. Without giving anything away, I was pretty impressed with the way it ended and felt it was a fresh take on the genre.",1370563200,,290,4.017241379310345
3050037,3,B0010SW5T0,"Bobby (William DeMeo) gets out of prison after five years for armed robbery. He opts to go after the rats that put him in there. He works for a crime family. He is the son of a well off somewhat honest construction company owner who does not like the mob, but must deal with them. The story is told with flashbacks and flashbacks during flashbacks. It has some first person narration by Bobby, but changes up at will to have some policeman narration.

The film is a gritty look at the crime world filled with connections and favors. Bobby loathes the flamboyant lifestyle of those criminals who flaunt their wealth, but is forced to work with them. Bobby is by no means an honorable person himself, screwing up relationships, sometimes being his worse enemy.

The acting was wonderful, but the plot wasn't solid as if the editor had hiccups. Worth a rental for those for enjoy mafia style crime movies.

Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, stripper nudity.",1370304000,2,949,4.704819277108434
3050038,5,B0010SW5T0,"When I read the storyline and saw the roster of actors, I knew it was going to be a great movie, but after actually seeing it, it exceeded my expectations. The caliber of acting talent was out of this world and the production really brought to life the depth and intensity of the storyline. I was hooked beginning to end and recommend Once Upon a Time in Brooklyn to anyone! Mr. Paul Borghese has a bright future in the film-making industry.",1370217600,,441,4.45679012345679
3050039,4,B0010SW5T0,Watched this movie last night and found it to be alot more then expected from an independent film.  The acting was great.  There was lots of action and the story line  hit a cord showing a father and son relationship that's more like water and oil.  But in this film a father's love is forever.  You must watch it to know what I'm talking about.  I'm surprised I didn't see this film in theaters and I'm lucky I picked it just because I live in Brooklyn.  I highly recommend this film if you don't know what to watch.,1369958400,2,517,4.214285714285714
3050040,5,B0010SW5T0,"Beautifully directed drama with Armand Assante is at the top of his game! Original music was a breath of fresh air as well. William DeMeo's performance was brilliant. Although his character was no hero, his innate ability to win the audience over as a protagonist made me root for him throughout. His charm and warmth transcends the screen - something not easily accomplished even by some of Hollywood's best known actors.",1369872000,2,422,4.957746478873239

Will Demeo is great as the lead and sells a nice contemporary mafia movie. Love the portion when the rats get whacked out. If you're into mafia movies definitely check this one out.
