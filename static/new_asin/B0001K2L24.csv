2007682,4,B0001K2L24,Product arrived in a reasonable time in good condition.  The movie presentations were entertaining.  Jack Nicholson is funny as usual if you like his sort of hiumor.,1262908800,,165,5.074074074074074
2007683,5,B0001K2L24,Man Trouble was a lot of fun to watch; it was like watching an old Rock Hudson/Doris Day movie.  I would recommend it for a light hearted enjoyable movie.,1209686400,,154,4.310344827586207

8013476,1,B0001K2L24,"I purchased this DVD, and didn't get around to watching it until two and a half months after my purchase.  This DVD doesn't work, and there is a sixty day return policy (which I was unaware of)  from Moviemars.  If you buy from them I would suggest you checkin out immediately.  This was the first time I've purchased a DVD and it didn't work.  Very disappointing!!!!!",1489708800,,368,4.515151515151516
8013477,5,B0001K2L24,THIS MOVIE IS BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN THATS FILLED WITH A INTELLIGENT STORY THAT HOLDS YOUR INTEREST TO THE VERY END . BIG BUSINESS AND GREED ARE FULL THROTTLE. THE ACTING IS FIRST CLASS AND A FAMILY RELATIONSHIP STORY THROWN IN.  THIS FILM SHOULD GO TO BLU RAY AND SURROUND SOUND  ITS A GOODY THAT YOU WILL WATCH A FEW TIMES EVERY YEAR,1486339200,,332,4.426229508196721

8013479,5,B0001K2L24,"Wow, what an excellent movie!!  It's older so the styles were funny but lots of life lessons in this story.  Great acting, lots to ponder, revelations of how class action suits get started and how corporations react.  Thoroughly enjoyable.  Bravo!!",1468627200,,248,5.125

8013484,1,B0001K2L24,"I am sick and tired of the totally predictable corporate bashing that makes this totally predictable movie. There is an idealistic, decent class-action attorney, and there is the evil octopus that is the motor company. Guess who is the hero!",1336089600,,241,5.05
