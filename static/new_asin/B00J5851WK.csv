8648196,4,B00J5851WK,"Very upbeat documentary on the ever growing numbers of open LGBT people serving in American government. The list goes from the U.S. Senate, where Tammy Baldwin not long ago became the first openly gay non-incumbent elected, to multiple state and city politicians and judges, not just from obvious places like New York or San Francisco, but from places one doesnt think of as so gay friendly, like Texas.

This could be a great film for teens  LGBT teens get to see that theres nothing they cant do, and straight teens could get a positive lesson on tolerance and openness.

All the men and women interviewed are smart, honest, inspiring, sometimes very funny, and occasionally openly sad when revealing moments where they were rejected by friends or family, or threatened with violence. But all have gone on to flourish and excel, and now share their variations on the watchwords it gets better.

One could carp  by trying to get to as many people as possible, the film cant go very deeply into anyones life story. But that really isn't the aim here. Its more an affirmation than an expose, More a celebration of change than a rigorous examination of national prejudice.",1421971200,2,1170,4.83
8648197,5,B00J5851WK,Fascinating movie.  I had no idea that so many politicians have come out as being gay or lesbian.  That is one thing that you can not tell about a person just by looking.  The old limp wrist got a lot of straight people in trouble when people thought that a limp wrist meant you were gay.  I am using my copy to educate members of the Senior Center in Iowa City and even the City Hall.,1411430400,,385,4.026315789473684

  My name is LTC Justin F. Blum, a retired U.S. Army officer and a JROTC Instructor now in my 19th year working with at risk youth.  After viewing the documentary Breaking Through, the following are my thoughts on the positive and constructive merits brought forward from the documentary.

  Breaking Through is by far one of the best Learning for Life documentaries I have ever seen.  So many male and female teenagers in the U.S. are struggling with any of the following obstacles:  lack of motivation, discipline, low self-esteem, inability to handle negative peer pressure, frantically searching for positive role models in their life, and afraid to show their true inner feelings in fear of being ridiculed or even bullied by others who may be exhibiting similar problems but are trying to conceal their feelings.

  Each of the highly successful men and women featured in the documentary are outstanding role models for todays youth setting an example in courage, candor, determination, selfless service, perseverance, and commitment to excellence for all to emulate!  So many of todays youth are struggling with similar circumstances as portrayed by the now highly successful politicians and judges who are the epitome of good citizenship.  As an Army JROTC instructor, I take the mission very seriously; The mission of JROTC is to motivate students to be better citizens!  The men and women interviewed display outstanding character to the degree that the words I cant are not part of their daily lives and they have all learned how to stand up against all negative forms of peer pressure.  These two traits are much needed by todays youth and Breaking Through clearly shows by example that these traits can be acquired.  All LGBTQ youth can benefit from the character education lessons brought forward by the documentary.  Non LGBTQ youth who exhibit the characteristics of a bully, due to their own low self-confidence or simply being homophobic, can also benefit because those interviewed can teach the so called bullies empathy towards others.  One who is a bully will not get close enough to his victims to understand their feelings.  The interviewed men and women of courage in the documentary can instill empathy in all that view the film.

8648199,5,B00J5851WK,"This documentary is a must watch for anyone passionate about social justice or the current political state of America. The film follows a number of Americas top LGTB politicians and difference makers, including Barney Frank and Houston mayor Annise Parker. The filmmakers do a remarkably good job of getting these influential people to open up and be vulnerable about their own struggles and insecurities. The politicians reveal how difficult it was and still is for anyone from the LGBT community to get elected to public office. The film also shines a light on how far this country needs to go in order to openly accept and treat the LGBT community as equal. All the stories told were especially moving and powerful, especially the ones from Annise Parker. I cant recommend this documentary highly enough!",1402963200,2,807,5.029850746268656
8648200,5,B00J5851WK,This documentary really was uplifting and hopeful. It made me feel like there has been a lot of positive progress as far as the LGBT community. It was really amazing to find out that so many politicians are advocates of LGBT rights. It was just a beautifully made documentary. One of the best parts of the documentary is that it left nobody out! I highly recommend it for those interested in LGBT rights like I am.,1402963200,,414,4.4605263157894735
8648201,4,B00J5851WK,"I recently watched Breaking Through and I absolutely loved it. I never knew there were so many politicians who were LGBT. What I liked best was that the film not only revealed the members of the LGBT community, but also showed that there are more people involved in the politics who are not the same Caucasian heterosexual men we see on the news. Many of the people interviewed were people of color, or female. Not only that, but the film did not only interview politicians who are gay or lesbian. There were many who were bisexual or transgender, which is great because often, those two branches of the LGBT community often feel under represented. I would have loved more narration, but I deeply enjoyed the film and found it to be incredibly educational.",1402876800,,756,4.69172932330827
