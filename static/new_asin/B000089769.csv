1830545,4,B000089769,"Movie was a good fun movie, plenty of gratuitous flesh and a reasonable story line.  The acting was OK and the actual picture detail and effect were good for the budget it was probably given. The lead actress was extremely georgous.",1369526400,2,232,4.658536585365853

1830547,3,B000089769,"Well this was interesting. I thought that I had seen (or at least heard of) darn near every soft-core B movie from this era, the mid 1990s, but I'd never heard of this one until stumbling across it on Amazon. And for the era, it's not bad, with big-breasted Debra Beatty as the dead protagonist in a weird VR Purgatory. The plot doesn't make a lot of sense, really, but Debra pulls out her twin towers a BUNCH of times, even goes full frontal a couple, and that's nice. Includes a token lesbian scene here just about the time when these movies became obsessed with including such. The sex is about average for something in this genre from the mid 1990s.

It probably would have been good enough for four stars from me, except that every scene is shot in that darned dark lighting, as if they throw blackout curtains all over the room and lit the performers with one 60-watt incandescent lamp bulb. I HATE that (it's actually a very common technique these days). I don't watch movies to see 90 percent of the screen in shadow.",1365724800,9,1025,4.452127659574468
1830548,4,B000089769,"The future is bright, sexy, naughty, and delicious. I think we all need to take a second and more detailed look at video games.",1364860800,2,127,4.333333333333333
1830549,4,B000089769,"in brief, this movie was one the best soft-core films that i had seen or brought. all of the sex scenes were hot, but they did not last long enough. i collect types
of movies and this one will be a welcomed addition to my collection!! amazon, you rock! a very satisfield customer!!rwbramlett1956@hotmail.com",1335139200,2,307,4.811320754716981
1830550,4,B000089769,"Softcore erotica actors and actresses put together a meadow muffin of a movie that makes 87 minutes seem like 3 hrs.  ""Cyberella Forbidden Passions"" was spawned in 1996 and somehow they managed to get Debra K. Beatty as the lead seductress.  She's why you keep watching.  It helps if you have tried a career in the computer sciences, but as long as you've been lied to, cheated on, and stolen from, you'll relate to the plot.  Like I said, you watch this film for Debra K. Beatty.  This version here on Amazon has more of what you want to watch in the video, the shorter version is edited enough that you won't finish it.  If you're a Victorian prig looking for stellar thespian skills, skip this.  If you have an hour and a half to indulge a rise in your Levi's, this DVD is the ticket.  Pavlov's dog MIGHT have drooled more, but I doubt it.",1329609600,9,842,4.352564102564102
1830551,4,B000089769,wow!  a flick I had never seen before..a hidden gem...I liked it nice looking girl  a plot (most movies should be buried in a plot) but not this one. here is a film I could and will watch again..,1326240000,5,195,3.9743589743589745

1830553,4,B000089769,"This movie was made and released on vhs in 1995, then in 2003, was transferred to dvd. It was didgitally mastered so it looks really good. I'm afraid the woman on the front cover isn't in the movie, but don't worry as there are several great looking gals that are in it. This is a very well done soft porn film, with many ""scenes"", plenty of nudity and some pretty good acting and plot. This is the 87 minute ""R""  rated version, that has not been cut. The movie was done with taste and class, nothing vulger or demeaning. It is also good to see the mid-1990's in clothing, appliances, and just general living conditions. Check it out.",1322265600,38,634,4.372881355932203
1830554,4,B000089769,"The version detailed above is the unrated ""87-minute"" one...the other is highly edited ""78-minute"", with toned-down sex scenes compared with the original.  It doesn't change anything with regards to the plot, really, but if that isn't your primary reason for watching this movie, it can make a difference.  The plot is kind of cool; the protagonist is a (attractive, smart) computer geek who, after her boyfriend leaves her abruptly, dies in an accident while plugged into her virtual reality program.  Awakening in an afterlife that has windows into the live world through virtual reality, Mara discovers that she has to ""visit"" live people to help them, and to learn her own lesson along the way.  A nice re-imagining of a kind of purgatory for the modern world, with some good (if corny) ethical lessons.",1230681600,38,807,5.0

7980292,2,B000089769,"Likewise never judge a DVD etc.

I don't know why I bought this possibly because of the good reviews or possibly there was someone in it I thought I liked.
The long and the short of it is that the good reviews were wrong and there was no one in it I liked.
The story was thin and predictable.
the acting was not bad but the intimate scenes were clichd formulaic setups. I won't go as far as to say that as adult entertainment it was godawful but it was pretty poor.
Also (sorry dear) but the lead actress was carrying a few and looked quite hard faced at times.

ACID TEST: would I buy again or recommend? NO Absolutely not.",1494201600,,624,4.148760330578512
