1211446,3,B00000FE08,"""Tarzan and the Trappers"" is edited together from three episodes of a potential television series that was rejected. Now, granted, at face value that bit of information should send animals running from through the jungle, but Gordon Scott is one of the better Tarzans and this black & white film certainly exceeds low expectations, even with all the clips of jungle scenes re-edited from previous Tarzan films. The plot is an old Tarzan standard where the Lord of the Jungle has to stop the a bad guy, the evil Schroeder (Leslie Bradley) in this case, from illegally trapping animals for zoos.  However, once Schroeder is stopped it turns out he has a brother, Sikes (Sol Gorss), a big game hunter who is even worse and who wants to turn the tables on Tarzan by stalking the Ape Man (pretend for a second this is not a really stupid idea and that he is going to go down hard). Eve Brent is a blonde Jane and Rickie Sorensen plays Boy, and while neither has much to do in this 70-minute effort, there is certainly the sense that even if they are living in the middle of the African jungle this is just a normal family. The biggest clue this was intended to be a 1950s television show is that Tarzan and Jane each have their own tree houses (presumably this Boy was adopted too; so much for Edgar Rice Burroughs' Korak the Killer). In terms of releases, this is the third of five Tarzan films starring Scott, the others being ""Tarzan's Hidden Jungle"" (1955), ""Tarzan and the Lost Safari"" (1957), ""Tarzan's Greatest Adventure"" (1959), and ""Tarzan the Magnificent"" (1960), of which the last two are the above average efforts.",1068595200,12,1621,4.628472222222222

1211473,1,B00000FE08,"When I was a little kid, this was okay, because I was a big Edgar Rice Burroughs and Tarzan fan.  Even as a kid, I knew this was not really a good film with bad acting and pathetic staged scenes.  As an adult, I couldn't force myself to watch the entire thing.  It was just awful.

They probably didn't have the resources to re-shoot. Come to think of it they should of re-cast and started over. The chimp(s) were good.",1426204800,,303,4.428571428571429

1211548,2,B00000FE08,"It was pretty clear from the start that the script writer never read a single Tarzan book. He just followed the previous writer's formulaic script that cast our protagonist as monosyllabic noble savage.with an America Jane and a young sidekick who wander into troublesome situations that require a last minute rescue.
I liked Gordon Scott in the role of Tarzan, but I disliked the script.

Author Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote Tarzan as a more interesting, multilingual multifaceted character.",1391299200,,490,5.282051282051282
1211549,3,B00000FE08,"As a kid , I always liked Tarzan and as an adult, little has changed. It is a movie and star that I will always like, but only the real Tarzan buffs will appreciate movies made 30 to 60 years ago. It is B&W; has film flaws; acting is ""B"" movie quality; but it brings out my inner child. I would recommend it for the serious collector; but others may find it on a streaming movie server. It is a good wholesome family movie.",1391126400,,423,4.0476190476190474

1211554,4,B00000FE08,Watching this movie took me back to Saturday afternoons before tv was dominated by animation.  This was truly enjoyable to watch with my young children.  They were very entertained by action and the Tarzanglish.  I look forward to sharing more memories of childhood with them as we explore the many Amazon Prime offerings.

1211555,3,B00000FE08,Gordon looks more the part than Johnny but Weissmuller still holds top spot for Tarzan. That said this flick is entertaining if you want something light to watch on a rainy night.,1371168000,,179,4.625

The only good thing in it is Gordon Scott.
But who wrote the blurb for this?  ""Gordon Scott was always Edgar Rice Burroughs' choice to play Tarzan BEFORE Johnny Weissmuller took on the role?"" Gordon was six years old when Johnny Weissmuller first played Tarzan so either the blurb is wrong or ERB had AMAZING foresight.
If you meant AFTER you'd have been right. ERB wasn't that impressed with Les Baxter who replaced Johnny and NOBODY was thrilled when Jock Mahoney (TV;s Yancy Derringer) replaced Gordon.",1452729600,,580,4.686274509803922
