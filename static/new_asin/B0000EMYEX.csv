8002200,4,B0000EMYEX,Thanks for quick shipping. Movie was ok. Too bad it is only in Spanish. At least it had subtitles though.,1515715200,,105,4.3
8002201,5,B0000EMYEX,"An enigmatic aunt comes to stay with her estranged extended family....and well, all hell breaks loose! Not a single frame wasted in this creepy tale that builds to a searing climax and an ending that leaves a thought-provoking question mark. Great acting and thoughtful, quiet direction make this one of my list of favorite thrillers.",1393113600,3,334,5.090909090909091
8002202,4,B0000EMYEX,"Upon my first viewing I wasn't all that impressed with AUNT ALEJANDRA but after giving it a second shot I really found it to be a tense supernatural thriller worth owning. Is Aunt Alejandra really a bruja practicing black magic or is she an innocent old woman falling victim to a grieving family's misfortune? The first time around I felt this was a bit too tame, bordering on a made-for-TV supernatural thriller from the Seventies, but this grows on you and though it comes off ambiguous, it answers questions that may develop during the course of the film. The finale was so powerhouse I knew I had to add it to my collection of Mexican horror cinema. LA TIA ALEJANDRA (AUNT ALEJANDRA) is a keeper.",1374019200,3,700,4.608
8002203,4,B0000EMYEX,"I watch a lot of vintage horror, especially Eurocult and related films. La Tia Alejandra is in the vein of CasaNegra films. I'm surprised they didn't pick it up. Excalibur does a very good job with the transfer. While there are a couple of spots of film damage, it does not negatively impact the viewing experience. The rest is excellent, given the age of this film. The film has very good atmosphere. Back in the day of these films, atmosphere made the movie, as they had minimal gore and violence that contemporary movies rely on to shock you. The actress who plays Alejandra does an excellent job. She portrays a powerful yet sinister woman without relying on words. She carries the movie. Big problem: the Amazon synopsis gives away the whole film, including the ending! I'm glad I stopped myself from continuing to read it all before I watched the movie. A better- nonspoiler- synopsis is: An elderly woman- Alejandra- moves in with her nephew and his wife, as well as their 3 children. The family is in debt and is grateful for Alejandra's generosity, as she has wealth and is paying their bills in return for their hospitality. Aunt Alejandra seems to have ulterior motives, and begins to instruct the children in the arts of black magic. Death and destruction falls upon the household. What is Aunt Alejandra really after? I enjoyed this film. Its very well done. You must consider its age when you set your expectations. Its not a thrill a minute film but more in line with gothic horror of the 70s.",1368576000,3,1508,4.672932330827067
8002204,3,B0000EMYEX,"I was surprised by the violence, nudity and dark quality of this Mexican horror film.  It was scary and quite disturbing at times.  I would not reccomend it as a stellar film but it is worth the watch.",1320192000,,201,4.2631578947368425
