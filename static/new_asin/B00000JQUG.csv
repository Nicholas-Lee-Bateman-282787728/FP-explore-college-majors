1237102,3,B00000JQUG,"The first half of this film is exciting--as Florenz Ziegfeld creates his Broadway reputation, woos Anna Held to the stage, and mounts his ""Follies.""  There is a thrilling backstage atmosphere, and a beautiful recreation of the era (at least 1936's view of it--as stills from the original follies prove they weren't nearly as stupendous, how could they be?).  But then, after the centerpiece ""Melody"" number (in a word--wow), the movie slips into a sleepwalk, tries to create drama where there isn't any, and commits felonies like cutting away from Fanny Brice while she's singing ""My Man.""  There is also a ballet number with Harriet Hoctor that is a horror, and is what fast forward buttons were invented for.  Essential viewing for those interested in 30s cinema--it truly is a gigantic movie.  But you should brace yourself for that last hour. (See also ""Rosalie,"" a Ziegfeld show MGM turned into a film the following year, for more of the studio's crazy ""bigger is better"" mentality.  That film, written by the same writer and  almost topping this one in scale, is catastrophically bad.)",1072051200,6,1091,4.994475138121547
1237103,4,B00000JQUG,"There are a few things to know going in: It's a biography with music (but not a musical), it's more than 60 years old, and it's three hours long!! Now I'm okay with all that, but I'm an old movie snob. This one is proof positive of the old Hollywood dream factory, where you were guaranteed happiness, pathos, bells, and whistles in practically every picture. But the film isn't as happy-go-lucky as you might expect; it gives a rather astringent portrayal of a gifted showman who knew how to dazzle audiences, but never how to save a buck. According to this book, his was a never-ending cycle of glittery and expensive theatrics pitted against dodging creditors his whole life. In that respect, we are to conclude that his lack of business sense was tempered by his need to entertain. He also knew talent, as is represented by his discovery scenes with Bolger and real Ziegfeld veteran Fanny Brice. (Watch how he hires her on the strength of her comedy, then humiliates her during a rehearsal in order to get her in the mood to belt out ""My Man."") And of course, not enough can be said of the eight-minute ""A Pretty Girl Is Like A Melody"" finale where spangled showgirls, opera singers, grand pianos, and a single, all-enveloping curtain hang on a revolving staircase in the shape of a wedding cake. You have to see it to believe it.",1032912000,12,1334,4.585774058577406
1237104,5,B00000JQUG,"I can't quite remember how old I was when I first saw this film, I must of been 4 or 5, all I remember was I didn't attend school yet, but, ""The Great Ziegfeld"", was the ultimate movie of my childhood. It's what first put the thought of making films in my head. Recently I viewed the movie again, and it's still as charming and as wonderful as ever! Just about every momemnt of it brought enjoyment.
 It's not hard to see why this movie won the best picture Oscar in 1936. The big sets, the lavish costumes, beautiful women, and the all-star cast headed by William Powell (whom sadly wasn't given a nomination for this film, but, was up that year anyway, for ""My Man Godfrey"")and including Myrna Loy (Whom has acted with Powell in ""The Thin Man"" in 1934, I think), Luise Rainer (Who won an Oscar for her role, she also won the following year for ""The Good Earth""), Frank Morgan & Ray Bolger (Both probably best known for their roles in ""The Wizard of Oz"" Morgan - Oz, Bolger - The Scarecrow), Fanny Brice, and Virgina Bruce, are just a few of the famous face who appear in and out of this movie. One can only imagine, since I wasn't even born yet, what kind of reaction this film was received with when first released. I can only guess people were truly taken away with it. It really must of been something special to see this back then. This isn't really a great film. I enjoy it true, and I will continue to watch it again and again. But, this movie is just like the shows put on by Florenz Ziegfeld himself, an extravaganza! It ""pretty"" to watch. It's fun to go back in time and relive the past. To see what entertained people back then, but otherwise, this is not a ""best picture"" type of film. But, like I said, it's understandable as to why it won back then. People, I assume must of never seen a big, splashy movie like this before. And even in the modern world, I'm still amazed by it. Then again, I'm a bit bias towards these movies. I love films from the 30's and 40's. They're part of my childhood. Even though I'm 19.
 ""The Great Ziegfeld"" tells the story of America's greatest showman, Florenz Ziegfeld Jr. (William Powell). We see him at the Chicago World Fair in the late 1890's. He's struggling with a ""world's strongest man"" act. His main competition is Jack Billings (Frank Morgan), who also happens to be a close friend. He has a ""women's show"" called ""Little Egypt"". We see Ziegfeld, then turn himself into a great showman. By playing the press. He creates stories to keep his talent in the papers, then he gets a break. It meets Anna Held (Luise Rainer, and I agree with everyone on here, her performance is a standout. It's truly unforgettable). Who he opens a lot of doors for and she for him. But, it's not untill he gets an idea to do a ""women's show"" ""glorifying"" the everyday women, ""The Ziegfeld Follies"", that he achieves his greatest success. I really don't want to spoil too much of the film for those who haven't seen to film yet, but, that was a brief description of the events that take place.
 ""The Great Ziegfeld"" went on to earn 7 Oscar nominations, and won 3;""Best Picture"", ""Best Actress"" & ""Best Dance Direction"". The film's highpoints for me include the big elegant dance number of ""A Pretty Girl Is Like A Melody"" which goes into a medley including Puccini's Un Bel Di Verdremo, and closing with Gershwin's ""Rhpasody In Blue"". Then there's Ray Bolger's song and dance to ""She's A Follies Girl"". His dancing is really amazing and proves what type of talent he was. I also enjoyed seeing Buddy Dolye impersonate one of my favorites Eddie Canntor singing ""If You Knew Susie"". Seeing Fanny Brice sing ""Yiddle On Your Fiddle"" and ""My Man"" was also wonderful. There's a nice set piece when Vigina Bruce sings ""You Never Looked So Beautiful"" and hearing ""You"" put a smile on my face.
 If you enjoy classic films, than this should please all filmbuffs. It's nice knowing, that while Hollywood can't make 'em like this anymore, I'm still able to revisit my childhood as long as we have these tapes.
 Bottom-line: The ultimate movie of my childhood is one of the great early movie musicals of all time! Big and splashy it shows us what Hollywood was once like, and what it can never be like again. This is one to watch for it's ""time capsule"" purposes mostly.",1026604800,35,4291,4.461146496815287
1237105,4,B00000JQUG,"Great movie for stage and movie buffs. Outstanding costumes and sets. Seems a little long at times, but length is overcome by the high quality of the acting put forth by the lead characters. Luise Rainers portrayal of the first Mrs. Zeigfeld is the most memorable performance in the film. In the movie, her phone call to Zeigfeld to congratulate him on his second marriage will leave you with a broken heart . No wonder she won an Oscar for her performance! You won't regret buying this movie.",1021075200,5,493,4.613636363636363
1237106,4,B00000JQUG,"The legendary Florenz Ziegfeld was the consummate showman who, in the 1907-32 period ""glorified the American girl"" in a series of Broadway productions that made him (and them) famous the world over. Billie Burke, the fey and sparkling character actress who made a new career for herself in the talkies following the death of her spouse, personally chose Powell for the role. While Powell didn't resemble the showman physically, he reputedly had the right ""manner and approach"". Costing a phenomenal (by 1936 standards) l. 5 million dollars to film, this extravaganza traces Ziegfeld's entire career from his sponsorship of strongman Sandow at the 1893 Chicago World's Fair to his initiation of his famed Follies in 1907 which led to a great career as a musical entrepreneur - i.e., the 1927 stage version of SHOW BOAT, etc. - followed by his death in the depressed year of 1932. Powell is strangely touching as Ziegfeld; his performance conveys many facets about the man: his esthetically impeccable and exquisite taste, his unique genius in his chosen field - and even his financial impracticality. Powell's performance is winning, poised and charming as he gets across the poignancy implicit in Ziegfeld's financial misfortunes following the 1929 crash, and scenes with his daughter Patricia are done with sensitivity. Loy was not exactly an inspired choice to play Burke, but she plays with poise and charm. Luise Rainer won an AA for her playing of the famous chanteuse, Anna Held and her telephone scene is classic: she poignantly hides her grief while congratulating Flo upon his marriage to Billie. I certainly didn't think Virginia Bruce was best choice for the gal on top of the ""Stairway to the Stars"", i.e. A PRETTY GIRL IS LIKE A MELODY (as sung by Stanley Morner aka Dennis Morgan) sequence!",1017446400,2,1804,5.036789297658863
1237107,3,B00000JQUG,"On a purely technical level, everything about THE GREAT ZIEGFIELD is big: big sets, big costumes, big musical numbers, big crowds, all of it lavish, all of it over the top, all of it very enjoyable.  The main cast--William Powell, Luise Rainer, Frank Morgan, and Myrna Loy--plays with considerable wit and precision, and the supporting cast includes such famous Ziegfield stars as Fanny Brice and Ray Bolger.
Unfortunately, the film is not as much fun as it sounds.  The script and story give us an extremely sanitized and rather sentimental version of showman Flo Ziegfield, his loves, and his stars, and in spite of film's lavishness and fine performances, it gradually becomes a very mild but very elephantine movie that only really comes to life during its musical numbers.  These a justly famous, with the ""A Pretty Girl"" number living up to its reputation as perhaps the single most extravagant musical number ever placed on film.
Luise Rainer's famous performance as Anna Held will charm virtually every viewer, and fans of Powell, Loy, and Morgan will certainly find much to enjoy--as will musical fans of all stripe.  But even so, as the film drags on and on, most viewers will be tempted to hit the fast-forward button more than once.",1011657600,3,1244,4.90952380952381
1237108,5,B00000JQUG,"I saw this movie when it first came out, I was about 12 years old. I have always been a big movie fan,and I always loved the lavish musicals, and the comedies. This movie has the best of the best. Almost all the screen greats of the 40s, and then some, are showcased here. I saw it once on TV, and this is a movie I could watch a hundred times. A perfect example of why movies were so great, they don't make em like this anymore. Pure intertainment!!!!!",997401600,4,453,4.101123595505618
1237109,3,B00000JQUG,"Anybody who has ever seen this bit of kitsch will remember it's famous highlight: the enormous musical number set on a revolving wedding cake set that features snippets of ""A Pretty Girl is Like a Melody,"" ""Rhapsody in Blue,"" arias from various operas, and women in cat-faced headpieces (all topped by a colossal spiral screen that drapes over everything at the end). In some ways, this film was meant to out-do the Busby Berkeley spectaculars, and its most successful moment is actually a medley of four wonderful and imaginative staged songs at the rooftop of Ziegfeld's number: ""You've Got to Pull Strings,"" ""She's a Ziegfeld Follies Girl,"" ""You,"" and ""You Never Looked So Beautiful Before."" The movie is worth seeing just for this, and for the glimpse of great showgirl costumes during the latter song.
There's not much going for the movie in dramatic terms, although you do get Luise Rainer making her famous smiling-through-tears phone call (for which she won an Academy Award). Otherwise, things are pretty dull: in fitting with the usual santization of public figures' lives in biopics, Flo Ziegfeld is not a philanderer at all, but rather a poor completely honorable sap who keeps getting trapped in compromising situations by drunk showgirls like Virginia Bruce. Even Myrna Loy can't add much to the mix: her impersonation of Billie Burke is absolutely nothing like Billie Burke, and she and William Powell make a pretty dull couple in this film (you'd never know how much fun they had been in the THIN MAN films from this).",976406400,5,1534,4.949612403100775
1237110,4,B00000JQUG,"As someone who is not a fan of musicals, I was already at a disadvantage before the movie even started.  I fast forwarded through most of the numbers, and they looked dazzling enough and I'm sure would be entertaining for people who like that sort of thing.  I concentrated on the drama between the numbers, and with that I was quite satisfied.  William Powell is excellent as the famed, extravagant theatrical producer, Florenz Ziegfeld Jr.  The film chronicles the many highpoints and lowpoints of his career, as well as his two marriages.  Myrna Loy co-stars as his second wife, actress Billie Burke (Glinda the Good Witch from the Wizard of Oz), and although she gets second billing, she doesn't have much to do.  But the chemistry between her and Powell is once again a high point.  Luise Rainer, who had a brief career in Hollywood, stars as Anna Held, the first wife, a passionate, impulsive singer that Ziegfeld made a star of in America.  Rainer's scene on the phone has become quite famous, and she plays all of her scenes with great drama.  The film is a bit long, but it doesn't get boring, thanks to the stars, the story, and the great personalities that appear (Ray Bolger, Fanny Brice).  And for people that like musicals, this will probably entertain them even more.",975110400,2,1282,4.708520179372197
1237131,5,B00000JQUG,Good product and prompt shipping - thank you!,1497657600,,45,4.75
1237132,5,B00000JQUG,"Hollywood had a history of making bloated, boring extravaganzas in the past and this could have been just one more, but this time everything fell into place. It deserved its four Academy Award wins, including Best Picture and the enormous success it had with the public. Its three hour running time only drags a bit near the end, But then wraps itself up quickly. Because it was about Florenz Ziegfeld, a man who took living large to new extremes, it simply had to be a big and lavish film. It was directed by Robert z. Leonard, who had directed many of the MacDonald-Eddy musicals.

The cast is one of the film's greatest assets. William Powell is in one of his his best roles here, his natural warmth and charm energizing the entire production and carrying the film which was no mean feat. Luise Rainer's Anna Held is charming, vulnerable and sympathetic. Old pro Frank Morgan is fine as Ziegfeld's competitor and friend Jack Billings, the one imaginary character among the principals. Myrna Loy wisely chose just to be her charming self as Ziegfeld's second wife, Billie Burke instead of imitating her unique mannerisms. Burke was going to play herself in the original conception of the film at Universal, but when MGM took it over (it was too expensive for Universal) they wanted a better known star. Besides, Ziegfeld met Miss Burke when she was 26 and by this time she was 51, while Myrna Loy was 30. Nat Pendleton, the former Olympic medal-winning wrestler, played Sandow and would later play lieutenant Guild in two of the Thin Man pictures. Reginald Owen, as usual is the perfect English butler and Herman Bing makes the most as Ziegfeld's eternally flustered costumer.

The script is what you would expect of a Thirties film, with many saccharine moments, but it never overdoes it too much, not even in the famous ""telephone scene"". For a Hollywood biopic is actually stays fairly close to many events in Ziegfeld's life, and certainly to his extravagant spirit. His father really did found a music conservatory in Chicago, and he really did get his start with strongman Sandow at the 1896 Chicago World's Fair. He did find Anna held in London and did promote her in New York with shameless publicity stunts. His ceaseless womanizing was sanitized for the film but did have a long affair with Follies star Lillian Lorraine, an erratic, irresponsible woman thinly disguised here as Audrey Dane (played by Virginia Bruce).  It was actually Anna who suggested doing a follies show similar to the Folies Bergere in Paris, somehow not realizing she was putting a kid in a candy store. He did marry Billie Burke, His habit of giving extravagant gifts and sending telegrams to people who were nearby are well documented. The script had a few nice touches that could almost go unnoticed: men, like those from the barber shop incident mispronounce his name as Mr. ""Ziegfield"" (a common error) when he presents them with tickets, but those who actually know him call him Ziegfeld.

The musical numbers were wisely kept to just a few, preventing the film from becoming a vaudeville show. The two main numbers, the extraordinary ""A Pretty Girl Is Like a Melody""  number and the Midnight Frolic on the roof of the New Amsterdam are back to back, seeming to overstuff the film's middle, but were separated by an intermission in theaters. The only misstep was cutting Fanny Brice off just as she begins her signature song, My Man. What were they thinking? I'd have much rather had that number in instead of the dog and pony show that occurs later in the film.  The film rightfully won the best Dance Direction Oscar for the Pretty Girl production, one of the most famous musical scenes in Thirties film, with its elaborate costumes and staging and its mix of Dvorak, Liszt, Johann Strauss, Mascagni and Gershwin.

If you want to give it a try, set some time aside and enjoy this great epic musical of the Thirties.

Florenz Ziegfeld (1867-1932).

Florenz Ziegfeld (William Powell) is a barker at the 1893 World's Fair in Chicago, Illinois. In the Streets of Cairo area, he runs the Sandow, the Strongest Man in the World side attraction. His opponent, Jack Billings (Frank Morgan) barkers for The Little Egypt side attraction and always seems to draw a crowd with his harem ladies. Ziegfeld's outside audience ends up going over there as soon as Billings starts his barkering.
  Ziegfeld wants to make changes to his attraction. He wants to build the back seats higher, but Sandow (Nat Pendleton) says they had no people sitting in the back. They are not packing them in like they use to.  Ziegfeld takes Sandow to dinner. There Ziegfeld receives a message that Billings wants to merge with Ziegfeld's show. Nothing doing. Ziegfeld has better ideas for himself and Sandow. He wants to quit this circus in Chicago. So he takes Sandow with him to New York, Sacramento and San Francisco. They do well, but after having Sandow do a fake lion act, they lost money and Ziegfeld lost Sandow to a New York troupe.
Ziegfeld is on a ship to Europe where by chance he meets Jack Billings again. Following Billings, Ziegfeld finds a new venture to bring back to New York...Ann Held (Luise Rainer).

1237203,4,B00000JQUG,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Once I saw ""Funny Girl"" I assumed the beauties in the Follies could never compare to the 20s/30s standard and wow was I surprised. Those girls were truly beautiful, tip to toe and talented! Typically when you see even 40's musicals, you just assumed that women's stature, legs and poise eventually evolved to todays uber standard. However, in this epic biopic every dame is a winner. I figured since they weren't wearing mini-skirts and bikinis in those days it was not as hard to compete for men's attentions.

I have been to many stage productions and could never imagine seeing moving sets with dancing girls on mattress tops. The LA Hard Rock show probably is the closet to this technique and I was over the top with just their small interpretation. But in the 20's? How truly shocking, exciting, and spectacular!

Ziegfeld was a genius to attract all that talent to produce unforgettable moments in entertainment history. I had no idea his shows visualized profound eye candy, particularly the sets.

I found the movie too long and was not prepared to see almost full shows and routines. But this is more documentary format than stage play. Ray Bolger exhibited enormous talent that only shone through slightly in the Wizard of Oz. Amazing how many characters from this film ended up together again in 1939.

I did not find the Helm character interesting and her phone scene was overly dramatic and tired. She reminded me of the woman who played Joan of Arc, the silent version, very expressive eyes. I also did not see the appeal for Fanny Brice, Streisand probably spoiled that image for me.

Powell never disappoints and is aged well into his final moments. I watched this film primarily for his performance and this role was most likely very gruelling given the length and amount of dialogue.

High recommend for appreciating Ziegelds's early musical stage shows, the bevy of leggy beauties and fabulous sets.",1421193600,2,1960,4.867867867867868
1237204,4,B00000JQUG,"The film was full of Ziegfeld production numbers that were beautifully overdone and in crisp black and white. Ray Bolger was seen at his best performing in the style called eccentric dancing the same style that George M. Cohan was famous for. If you ever have the chance to see the real Cohan in some of his rare film clips don't miss them.
The highlight of The Great Ziegfeld is the rapid performance of Luise Rainer who could only be described as a cross between Bugs Bunny (for movement) Audrey Hepburn (for cuteness and lovability) and Hedy Lamar (for accent) all combined was enough to win the Oscar for best actress which she again received the next year. Luise Rainer would have been a contender today. She recently passed away at age 104. She alone is worth the price of admission.",1420588800,,789,4.602836879432624

in the movie,  and of course William Powell was great as usual",1417737600,,188,4.636363636363637
1237229,5,B00000JQUG,My new favorite movie of all times!!!! It's 3 hours long but I watched it twice in one weekend.,1414022400,,95,4.052631578947368

1237231,5,B00000JQUG,excellent,1412640000,,9,9.0
1237232,4,B00000JQUG,"I find it almost shameful that I wasn't really aware of who Luise Rainer was until a few weeks ago.  I had heard the name, obviously, but I didn't know the face, and discovering that she was a two time Oscar winner was kind of a shock to my system.  Watching The Great Ziegfeld made it all the more shameful, since shes so incredible in the film that I feel as though I should be more familiar with who she is.

Im rectifying that the best I can.

The film itself tells the story of famed producer Florenz Ziegfeld and his captivating stage shows.  I had seen Funny Girl years ago, and so I was familiar with Ziegfelds Follies and the whole Fanny Brice chapter of his career, but I was not familiar with his early years nor his later years, and so it was nice to see how well this film handled the entirety of his career.  I do find that the last chapter of the film does feel rushed, pertaining to his marriage to Billie Burke and his death, and poor Myrna Loy is horribly underused here, but his rise to fame and marriage/relationship with Anna Held is covered tremendously well, and his hold on the industry and immense eye for talent is brought to the light beautifully.

The ensemble here works wonderfully together, with Powell anchoring the film in such a strong way, delivering a well-rounded man that we can root for despite the obvious failings.  Frank Morgan is a great supporting player here, playing the perfect shoulder for Ziegfeld to lean on.  Morgan was such a great character actor, one who I continue to be moved and surprised by.  Fanny Brice is nice in small role as herself, and Virginia Bruce is the perfect foil to a happy marriage, but this whole film belongs to Luise Rainers brilliant portrayal of Anna Held.  What a marvelously crafted performance.  Touching every corner of this womans personality, Rainer crafts a complete portrait.  We see her impatience, her ambition, her loyalty, her frailty, her heartbreak, her loveeverything.  She moves with such grace and charm and creates an unforgettable presence.  Maybe thats why she won the Lead Actress Oscar despite being a clear Supporting player in this film.

The sets are beautiful, the costumes spellbinding and the music lavish and fun.  I do wish that some trimming had been done, because even though a lot of the film moves briskly despite its three hour running length, there are moments where it feels like Im watching a stage spectacle (especially that bloated presentation of Ziegfelds Follies) and it takes me out of the intimacy created in the actual story being told here.

Overall, I was impressed and cant wait to watch more from Rainer herself!",1412640000,,2641,4.667386609071274

1237246,4,B00000JQUG,"As I love old movies and wanted to hear and see Fanny Brice in the flesh as it were, I loved it. Louise Reiner was cloying sweet throughout and made it hard to watch at times. Myrna Loy made up for it.  William Powell was amazing and lovable perhaps not like the real Flo Z.

A follow up will be to see The Ziegfeld Girls with Lana and Hedy in all their glorious halcyon days.

Any fan of movies old or new should see this flic. Vunderbar!!!!

It's a classic black and white, but I kept finding myself wondering what it looked like in color (as they were shooting it).  Wonderful sets, music, dialogue and dancing.  He was such a genius, too bad he couldn't reel in his compulsive spending.

Fair warning - it's a long movie, about 3 hours.  Take advantage of the ""Intermission"" segment. :-)",1390867200,2,430,4.821917808219178

The film is, indeed, enjoyable, but the storyline is not as authentic of the life Ziegfeld as it could be. It is basically apocryphal to present the showman in a heroic manner . Fanny Brice, a sensational, electric major star of her time, has a brief and too abrupt part in the film. The same thing could be said for Will Roger' s appearance. The costumes and scenery will take your breath away! They really capture and recreate a 'typical' Ziegfeld Follies show. For the costumes, scenery, great acting  by William Powell, Myrna Loy, and Louise Rainer, this film is a winner.",1390348800,,745,4.601503759398496

1237254,4,B00000JQUG,"A period piece that is fun only if you're into such movies. It's corny as all get out, but it is what it is: a fictionalized biography of Flo Ziegfeld's life as a promoter and showman. I bought it primarily for the production musical numbers which are perfect examples that nothing succeeds like excess. Ziegfeld spared no expensesomething his creditors apparently hounded him about trying to get him to pay his bills. Comments on his extremes are quickly followed by in-your-face examplesblatant foreshadowing with instant payoff, if you will. Relationships are very nearly all caricatures, and the scenery must have tasted very good for all the chewing it receives. Yet I enjoyed itwell, parts of it, and will look at those extravagant musical numbers repeatedly, though I'll never watch the entire movie. I recommend it only with a strong caveat.

1237277,3,B00000JQUG,"As a rule, I tend to watch anything claiming to be a biopic with a great deal of suspicion (as far as reliability goes).  In this case, the claim is that this is a `fictionalized' tribute to Florenz Ziegfeld, Jr. and therefore already has the suspicion of inaccuracy built in.  Names of real people were changed to avoid lawsuits.  Billie Burke acted as the film supervisor, which did not include playing herself as Flo's last wife (the role went to Myrna Loy instead, who managed to act like everyone but Glinda the good witch).  The movie is long (on the long side of long) at 185 minutes.  Not all of it is entertaining.  But yes, ""a Pretty Girl is like a Melody"" is a fabulous number in dazzling black and white (a feat of engineering alone for the way the curtain lowers over the freakishly large wedding cake set piece).  Ray Bolger, playing himself, has a fantastic dance number.  Unfortunately, they all but obliterated most of Fanny Brice's numbers.  Frank Morgan is a hoot as Jack Billings, Flo's nemesis and friend.  Reginald Owen is great as Flo's nervous bookkeeper.  While William Powell, on the other hand, portrays Ziegfeld as a superstitious, manipulative charmer never completely satisfied with anything, bent on ruin, losing his first wife to neglect and indifference, in all, not a very nice man.  As for Luise Rainer's Oscar winning role as Anna Held, all I can say is that Carole Lombard was robbed (nominated at the same time for My Man Godfrey).",1380412800,2,1469,4.7176470588235295

1237301,5,B00000JQUG,"Florenz Ziegfeld dazzled Broadway for decades with his extravagant ""Follies"" revues but never indulged in the staggering opulence MGM lavished on making this movie about his life. Hunt Stromberg paid about $2 million in 1936 for three hour filming to make this movie the most expensive for the studio.  Some of the memorable scenes worth mentioning are the musical number ""You never looked so beautiful before"" with Virginia Bruce at the top of a highly extravagant set, and ""Pretty girl is like a melody"" with its revolving set like a gigantic wedding cake bearing numerous girls, costumes and props are simply outstanding. The dance sets were created by John Hatkrider and dance director Seymour Felix have done a tremendous job in making the dance sequences memorable. Luise Rainer as Anna Held, the first wife of Ziegfeld and Myrna Loy as the Billie Burke, the second wife of the great showman has done marvelous jobs.

The story of Florenz Ziegfeld Jr. (William Powell) starts as a carnival barker at the 1893 Chicago Fair and his discovery of Sandow, the muscle man (Nat Pendleton). He competes with his best friend and rival, Jack Billings (Frank Morgan) by signing a popular French actress named Anna Held (Luise Rainer) to work for him in United States. Later they get married, but surrounded by gorgeous show girls; his relationship with his wife suffers, mainly from Audrey Dane (Virginia Bruce) who breaks his marriage to Anna Held. Ziegfeld later meets and marries Billie Burke (Myrna Loy), and she stands by him during the downfall of his show business at the height of great depression. Throughout his career he uses the skills of Ed Wynn, Fanny Brice, W.C. Fields, Will Rogers, and Bert Williams as the comic leads, combined with music of Jerome Kern, Victor Herbert, Irving Berlin, and the Gershwin. Above all his dream of ""Glorifying the American girl"" pays off in the early part of his career.

The movie won the Academy award in the best picture category and also for Louise Rainer in the best supporting actress category. Unfortunately another MGM's all time great ""San Francisco"" about 1906 earthquake surpassed Great Ziegfeld in popularity to become one of the MGM's all time winners. In the same year MGM's another success story, ""Camille"" starring Greta Garbo in the lead offers the best performance of her illustrious career only to be beaten by Luise Rainer during the 1936 Academy awards.

1237326,5,B00000JQUG,"Though I am not normally a fan of musical shows, I have made two exceptions in my sixty-odd years.  The first was The Sound of Music, with Julie Andrews which I saw many years ago.  Recently I added The Great Ziegfeld to my rather short list.  Previous to watching the film (which I first rented), I knew nothing about the title character who, it turns out, is one of the greatest showmen of all time.  Though the acting is typical of the 1930s, '40s and '50s, there is nothing stereotypical about some of the great stage shows that Ziegfeld originated and produced before the great financial crash that led to the Great Depression.  His shows on Broadway were a drastic departure from everything that had come before, featuring opulent stage dressings, extremely innovative moving stage parts, and sing and dance numbers that put most modern productions to shame.  These were all a staple in most of Ziegfeld's productions, but the one that bowled me over would be considered extraordinary even by today's standards.  The center stage ""prop"" was in the shape of a multi-layered cake with a staircase beginning at the bottom and spiraling around and around to the very top.  At various stages of the ascent were completely individual companies of performers portraying a specific theme, and it was a glorious extravanganza that left me slack-jawed with amazement.  It was like nothing I have ever seen before or since, and impressed me on such a grand scale that I immediately went online and bought the DVD.  I happen to be a fan of old movies from the '30s and '40s, but only the really good ones like ""To Have and Have Not"" with Bogart and Bacall, and ""it Happened One Night"" with Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert find their way to my shelves.  Added to my personal collection is ""The Great Ziegfeld"" for the storyline itself, and the incredible visual feast for the eyes that characterized most of Ziegfeld's stage productions.  Do not let the artwork on the cover dissuade you from buying this film; rent it first if you can, then buy it to savor again and again clips of some of the greatest stage shows of all time.",1357430400,,2123,4.692722371967655

On the other hand, it is still a 1930's Hollywood musical, best compared to the Busby Berkeley genre.  The story is a bit more interesting, with the early career of Flo Ziegfeld being the excuse for a musical (it's not biographical in any sense), whereas the stories in many of the Berkeley films were merely a frame from which to hang the numbers.  Like the big Berkeley musicals, the music is much more frenetic than the hottest popular music of the day, but the numbers here are best compared to wedding cakes and staircases, not the top-down, geometric patterns made from women's bodies; sets revolve, unwind, curtains spiral up,  all as seen from a high balcony.

Another, more modern comparison would be the Barbra Streisand epics ""Funny Girl"" and ""Funny Lady""  (based in part on the Ziegfeld Follies) where the musical numbers are interludes that flesh out ideas in the story, as opposed to ""Oklahoma!"" (and operas) where the music moves the plot along.  And that brings up an interesting point:  If you've got an afternoon to kill, a blizzard or something, watching ""The Great Ziegfeld"" and ""Funny Girl"" back to back would provide an interesting contrast.  Ziegfeld's most profitable years ended with WWI.  This film was made some twenty years later, and the latter, another thirty years after that.  They both deal with much of the same period, yet are aimed at audiences of very different eras, and tastes in music and clothes.

The DVD itself is of the ""Roadshow"" production, meaning the version intended for the  initial release in select cities, with but one or two showings a night, with reserved seats and higher prices;  as a result, it has a full Overture, and Intermission, and Entr'acte.

What?

In effect, you get a static screen with the image of one of the words, and a selection of tunes from the show, as if you were at one, and not at a movie, and this is in addition to the opening and closing credits...  If you wanted to make more popcorn, call Aunt Edith to tell her the house is buried in snow, or feed the cat, you could do that, within reason, to a great soundtrack, and not miss any of the show.  Otherwise, you'd better have a working remote.  I found the black and white to be sharp and clear, but not stunning.  The sound was also very well mastered, but to no special praise.  It's the quality you'd expect from a major studio release of a classic, if rather forgotten old film..

I bought the DVD, since the last time I looked for it I couldn't find any version, anywhere;  and certainly no streaming or downloadable versions to rent or buy.  Now Amazon has all three---DVD, Stream to rent, or to buy.  I'll probably watch it more than my Busby Berkeley DVDs, which means about once a year, if that.  It's good, the music is Terrific!, but it's still a fairly typical 1930's film, and even with William Powell and Myrna Loy, it just isn't something I'd watch very often, although it's much better than I'd expected, in that regard.",1350172800,,3052,4.605555555555555
1237329,3,B00000JQUG,"The Great Ziegfeld is the first of three movies that deal with Florenz Ziegfeld and his legacy, the later ones being Ziegfeld Girl and The Ziegfeld Follies. For those who don't know, Ziegfeld was a master showman who recognized that beautiful women were all that one needed to sell a show, and with poise, dazzling costumes, and opulent scenery, he showcased hundreds of women in all their glory on Broadway. Naturally he was a bit of a ladies man, and had a common law marriage with star Anna Held and later with actress Billie Burke, with a few dalliances in between.

William Powell portrays Ziegfeld here, and he is polished and precise, but I believe too reserved to bring Ziegfeld to life. This was a man who managed to steal his rivals' stars and still get financial backing from them! He is not reserved and gentlemanly; he is brash and charismatic. This biopic is quite long at three hours, but I didn't feel any more emotionally involved in these people after watching it. The storytelling is methodical and seems like points on a timeline.

The only real thing to capture the audiences' emotions are the musical numbers, which are outstanding. They're a joy to watch and hold up well, even though Ziegfeld's heyday was about a century ago. Even though I have seen clips of the revolving cake number in documentaries, I was astonished at how beautiful and intricate it is.

I also wondered why some of these people didn't play themselves, as they were still living at the time this movie was made. Fanny Brice does an excellent job of captivating with humor and pathos even though she has only a few scenes; no one could have played her better. So why do we have an impersonator for Eddie Cantor? Couldn't Billie Burke have played herself? Perhaps they would not agree to it. I will say that the actor who plays Will Rogers is astoundingly like the original.",1348531200,2,1868,4.671732522796352
1237330,5,B00000JQUG,"The Great Ziegfeld is a captivating film that chronicles the ups and downs of Florenz Ziegfeld's life and his career in show business. The cinematography and choreography are excellent and the musical score, while a bit syrupy sweet at times, generally enhances the film. The quality of the print varies at times but overall it's pretty good. The plot moves along at a good pace and I wasn't ever bored; the musical numbers are perfect!!! The story of Ziegfeld's life is rather condensed even in this roughly three hour film; but I got a good sense of his life story.

When the action starts, we quickly meet small time, relatively young show business rivals at the Chicago World's Fair of 1893; Flo Ziegfeld (William Powell) and Jack Billings (Frank Morgan). Flo has a strong man act that gets attention and customers after Ziegfeld has a brilliant idea much to Jack's consternation. Flo also has a penchant for stealing Jack's lady friends--and sometimes even Jack's star female performers.

Time goes by and Jack is in Europe to sign Anna Held (Luise Rainer), a great French star, to be in one of his shows. But before Jack can sign Anna, Flo steals her away using his charm and intellect; Anna and Flo also fall in love. They all return to America and before you know it (the film glosses over a lot) Anna and Flo have been married a year. Meanwhile, Flo puts on shows starring Anna but eventually Anna becomes quite jealous of the other ""girls"" Flo has his eye on as these women could be future stars for future shows. It's interesting to see that although they are rivals, Jack Billings knows a business opportunity when he sees one so he and his partner Erlanger (Paul Irving) often loan Ziegfeld money to put on shows. Ziegfeld also becomes famous for putting on shows called ""The Follies.""

Anna leaves Flo after a misunderstanding; she sees Flo with the talented but most unreliable Audrey Dane (Virginia Bruce). (And yes, that telephone scene in which Luise Rainer acts so well must have clinched her that Oscar; her performance there is brilliant.) Flo becomes depressed but he eventually meets Billie Burke when she attends a party one night with Jack and, predictably, woos and steals Jack's woman once again. Flo and Billie fall in love and marry.

More time passes and we see Flo putting on more shows. He has a daughter with Billie Burke; and the rest of the film reveals how Flo's personal life and career work out.

Look also for fine performances by Ray Bolger playing himself, Fanny Brice as herself and Harriet Hoctor as herself. Nat Pendleton is terrific as Sandow and Joan Holland plays little Patricia Ziegfeld. Ann Gillis plays Mary Lou as a child; Jean Chatburn plays Mary Lou as an adult; Rosina Lawrence plays Sally Manners; Marcelle Corday is Anna's maid Marie and Ernest Cossart plays Sidney.

The DVD comes with two great bonus features. We get ""Ziegfeld on Film"" and ""New York Hails The Great Ziegfeld.""

The Great Ziegfeld deserves recognition as a fine motion picture that tells the story of Florenz Ziegfeld's life. His story is an important one not simply because he knew how to make savvy business deals but because of his contributions to the arts. People who enjoy classic movie musicals will want this for their collections and fans of the actors will not be disappointed.",1344038400,,3313,4.7613240418118465
1237331,5,B00000JQUG,"Bought this 3 hours movie already in 2004/2005 (the german DVD was released a little bit later but edited down toa lousy 120 min).

The biggest surprise for me was the in 1910 german born actress Luise Rainer - she's completely unknow in the german speaking part. Very nice, the DVD contains a interview with Luise Rainer which was recorded for this DVD and I was surprised she was still living. And she still do (stand: January 2012). I sent my DVD Cover in 2005 to her and got it (lucky) signed back.

She was the first and only german actress who won a oscar. She won surprising 2 oscar - the second was for her role in the following year in ""The Good Earth"" (which is in my mind still a very good drama!!!).

This movie is a nice bio about Lorenz Ziegfeld who changed the stage play/revues on the broadway and was very successful.
The movie contains some musical/revue scenes but its not really that what I would call a musical like following movies ""the Ziegfeld Girls"", ""Ziegfeld Follies"".

The Picture Quality is pretty good. English Subtitles are available.

FAzit: a good bio with William Powell, Myrna Loy (as Billie Burke who his famous today more for her role as Glinda in Wizard of Oz than as real-wife of Flo Ziegfeld), Frank Morgan (the wizard in ""The Wizard of Oz"")  and Luise Rainer. Also Appearances of real Ziegfeld Player: Fanny Brice, Ray Bolger (Tin Man in ""The Wizard of Oz"").

But be careful: not each event in the movie was like in the real - Anna Held died before Ziegfeld did. Also Gershwins ""Rhapsody in Blue"" was written later and not used in the real Follies.

Trivia: Dennis Morgan has an uncredited part in the show/revue scene: ""A Pretty Girl Is Like a Melody"". His singing voice was dubbed by Allan Jones (""A Night at the Opera"" with the Marx Brothers and ""Everybody Sing"" with Judy Garland).",1326153600,,1826,4.52887537993921

1237336,4,B00000JQUG,"The Great Ziegfeld(released April/36)was MGMs most lavish musical picture for that time and many would argue its' most lavish ever. Based loosely on the life of Florence Ziegfeld Jr.,it traces his beginnings as a side show barker to his greatest triumphs on Broadway and to his decline and death in 1932. Of course this is Hollywood and very little is ""truth"" here,only similarities or suggestions of. Stars such as Fanny Brice,Will Rogers,Eddie Cantor,Bert Williams,Anna Held among so many more,were to pass through his productions,the Follies. Anna Held he married,and eventually another actress Billie Burke(played by Myrna Loy,a natural choice,by now VERY popular with audiences starring next to Powell in the Thin Man series),who many will recall as Glinda the good witch in the Wizard of Oz. The fact is Florence was quite the ladies man and he went into debt many times over during his illustrious career. He in fact left a giant debt for Billie which is the reason she had to return to work just to pay off Florence's substantial bills,when he died of pleurisy in 1932. The theatre he had built and named after himself was taken over by William Hearst who had originally loaned him the money to build it in the first place.
There is no denying Ziegfeld`s great influence in the show business world,even to this day,and fewer still can match a track record of 24 years of lavish stage productions;1907 to 1932. This film does manage to capture the ``spirit`` of Ziegfeld however and MGMs pick of William Powell as Ziegfeld was a great choice. Luise Rainer plays his French wife,star Anna Held,and she got an OSCAR for her outstanding performance. In fact the picture got two more OSCARS,one for best picture and one for dance director Felix Seymour. This is also the closest any studio ever got to matching the lavishness and technical brilliance of Busby Berkeley musical numbers;any one of them could have given Berkeley a good run for his money in their design and execution. The huge sets are still breathtakingly beautiful to watch.
Technically the movie is,at times,a bit scratchy and it could certainly use a good remastering. But over all it is a clear and crisp print. Extras include a featurette on the making of the film and a rare vintage newsreel from the film`s premiere. The newsreel is a real kick as for the most part it is a camera staring at an open mike and stars waltzing up to it and saying a few syllables about anticipating the films premiere. Watch for a very young Ed Sullivan waxing lyrical,looking more like a member of the mob than the entertainment columnist and radio man he was(he Walter Winchell's biggest competition at that point).This film(thankfully)is the road show version which means you are getting the top dollar $2.20-of-the-day price version as opposed to the 176 minute pared down standard version. It is a whopping 185 minutes;that`s three hours and five minutes for those in Hoboken. But those 185 minutes go by quite fast,which is a sign of a very good film.
The Great Ziegfeld is an engrossing 185 minute juggernaut which does NOT fail to entertain and impress thanks to the performances of Rainer,Powell,Loy and its`great supporting cast. It`s lavish production and dance numbers are a sight to behold and they give Busby a real run for his money. This was MGM`s highest budgeted pic for the depression and a gamble,but it paid off and was a hit. You won`t find a factual biography of Ziegfeld but Powell`s resemblance and his turn as Flo give the film the impetus it needs to chug right along in grand style to the end.

With a running time of well-over three hours (including an intermission), this movie was a unique entertainment event for Americans who had recently passed through the Great Depression's darkest days.

Ziegfeld regular Ray Bolger's dance cameo marks his first appearance in a sound film. Fanny Brice also performs, but missing are the real Will Rogers (who died in a plane crash a year earlier) and Eddie Cantor. They're portrayed by mimics, plus W.C. Fields has no representation here at all. These are however minor quibbles.

The story episodically covers Florenz Ziegfeld's life from 1893, when he was a World's Fair carnival barker, until just after his financial ruin in the October '29 stock market crash, an event that forced the closing of Ziegfeld's popular musical,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WHOOPEE/dp/B00CA4S308/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WHOOPEE!</a>&nbsp;A troubled marriage to Anna Held (Ranier) is chronicled. In the last third of the story, Flo (Powell) marries Billie Burke (Loy), a union that proves a blessing for the aging showman when those lean years do come.

Before we reach sadder days however, we're treated to lavish and historically accurate costumes, huge production numbers, beautiful girls and especially many talented performers who recreate a sparkling facet of early 20th Century Show Biz. For fans of epic MGM musicals, this granddaddy of them all is a must see, as it is for anyone interested in all-out cinematic extravagance on a scale that perhaps only the Great Ziegfeld himself could have imagined or brought to realization.

What a spectacle this film is! I had seen clips of certain scenes before when watching bios on MGM or in things like THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT, but I finally sat down and watched it tonight and it was excellent. I'm not a huge fan of ""musical"" themed films. I'm downright picky actually. But the production in this film is really something to see.

It's not just mind boggling production and great music either, even though the film has plenty of great Irving Berlin music in it. There are some great performances by Powell as Florenz Ziegfeld, Luise Rainer as Anna Held, his first wife (common law wife in real life) and Myrna Loy as second wife Billie Burke. Frank Morgan is also fun in this as the longtime friend, competitor and financial backer of Powells ""Ziegfeld"". Powell is really good and I'd have to rate this as one of his best films.

The film is a fictionalized, glamorous account of Ziegfelds life. It shows Ziegfeld as a small time carnival barker and stage manager who rises to become the master showman of the Broadway stage. There are bits of historical accuracy thrown in such as Anna Helds ""milk baths"" that Ziegfeld publicized to great effect and which makes for a funny scene in the film between Powell and Rainer. It also shows the constant ups and downs of his financial situation and how he was wiped out in the stock market crash of 1929. But the real treat in this film is the outrageous spectacle of the production number that we see at the end of the first half of the film. It's one of the most amazing technical achievements in both production and camera work that I've seen.

The film won the Best Picture Oscar as well as Best Actress (Rainer) and Best Dance Direction. The real Billie Burke was a technical advisor on the film and for her efforts was rewarded by Louie B. Mayer with a seven year contract at MGM where she would go on to do some of her better known film roles like Wizard of Oz and Topper. Other fun performances worth mentioning are Fanny Brice and Ray Bolger playing themselves. The movie runs just over the three hour mark (this includes the overture and intermission music), but it is pretty fast paced and engrossing with really great visual eye candy. And just for laughs you can try to find former first lady Pat Nixon who plays one of the many uncredited ""Ziegfeld Girls"".",1250726400,9,2353,4.555555555555555
1237340,5,B00000JQUG,"Ziegfeld's second wife, Billie Burke, chose William Powell to play Ziegfeld.

Luise Rainer won the Best Actress Oscar for her performance as Anna Held, Ziegfeld's common law wife and the star of his early Broadway productions.  The film is very coy in its treatment of the Ziegfeld-Held relationship.  One minute he's trying to manufacture publicity to introduce the French singer to American audiences, the next moment he's sending her massive jewels with notes referring to her as his wife.  (Which she makes her maid read aloud twice and repeats herself...""my wife."")  Audiences of 1936 probably knew the back story.  It was quite the scandal in its day.

A special mention should be given to Virginia Bruce in the supporting role of Audrey Dane.  Dane is not a historical character; she is a composite of the women with whom the philandering Ziegfeld dallied.  As such, she is marvelously juicy character who says she would sell her soul for jeweled baubles and stardom; she brings contraband champagne backstage during performances; she makes inappropriate speeches during curtain calls; and ultimately causes the break up of Ziggy's first marriage.  Bruce, who had actually been a Ziegfeld Girl on Broadway, does a fine job with the singing and dancing, and she's electric in the hard edged backstage sequences.

Ray Bolger and Fanny Brice play themselves.  Just...WOW!!

The most impressive musical number, ""A Pretty Girl is Like a Melody"" (with a generous helping of ""Rhapsody in Blue"") will knock your socks off.  The costumes range from frothy 18th century ball gowns to eerie art deco bird women.  They threw everything but the kitchen sink into this number, and somehow managed to pull it off!  It could not be recreated today without CGI.

The DVD does have some problems.  The film is about three hours long and, although cleaned up, is not in the best shape.  It's a film that cries out for a commentary, but there is none.  Perhaps in 2011 they will see fit to give us a Deluxe 75th anniversary edition with the treatment this classic deserves.  However, between musicals having fallen into general disfavor and diminished audience attention spans, don't hold your breath.

Anyone interested in classic film and/or American musicals owes it to themselves to see this.  While it gives us an extended bio of one of Broadway's most successful producers, Florenz Ziegfeld, Jr., it is an amazing piece of American cultural history in itself",1247961600,2,3395,5.8121212121212125

William Powell plays Ziegfeld and he gives the showman a great tribute. Fannie Brice has a small part but it shows her as her silly self. The music in this movie, the Overture and the Intermission and throughout the film is wonderful and exciting. Frank Morgan (the Wizard of Oz), does a fantastic supporting role. Luise Rainer has many special qualities about her as an actress, and she won an Oscar for her performance. There are many inspiring showpieces in this movie. One of the best is a spiral cake with girls dressed in long flowing gowns and men dressed in tuxedos. As the camera rises to the top of the cake there is a beautiful girl who looks like a queen with stars in the background. A fashion show with girls dressed in rich apparel with extravagant designed hats and one girl with a white cottonball-like plume taller than she is on her side. Ray Bolger sings and walks across small steps at a high level with girls all around him. Will Rogers and Eddie Cantor have bit parts. One awesome scene begins with balloons on ribbons which come out into the audience. Another fantastic scene is a row of various kinds of dogs on the stage and girls dance around them. One scene is of the inside of homes and these homes are on rolling platforms, 5 of them in a row. Girls asleep in beds wake up and make their beds and then the camera shows them dancing on these platforms as they move in and out, seperately, from one another. Fantastic! The end of the movie is sad as the Stock Market crash of 1929 has come and Ziegfeld loses all his stocks and is broke. He has 4 shows that he has ready but they have to be shut down because of a lack of money. Ziegfeld misses Louise Rainer alot, which adds to his depression. When he hears that he has lost all of his stocks and money it is the final blow. Before he dies he sees the shows that he has made as they come to his remembrance. He then looks up and says words about steps, and he says, ""I must go higher. Higher."" Then he passes away, thus ending the movie. This film shows Hollywood at it's finest.

1237343,3,B00000JQUG,"""The Great Ziegfield"" was a mammoth box office hit for MGM in 1936 and it is a stupefying and interminable bore today, with the exception of a few tremendous musical numbers. It may be the very best example why so many of the films of MGM, the Tiffany of its day, have not stood the test of time. MGM spent truck loads of money and mounted the biggest show in the cinema but in doing so, they removed almost all vestiges of vitality and wit. At least the over-the-top no expense spared approach mirrored Ziegfield himself and it should be noted that the screenplay is a reasonably accurate depiction of his life and times. The art direction, costuming and sense of period, also, are lush and accurate. William Powell is good casting as Ziegfield but Myrna Loy has little to do as Billie Burke. Luise Rainer won a famous Oscar for her smiling through tears phone scene but this was the year Greta Garbo was up for ""Camille"". Are you kidding? Fanny Brice (""Funny Girl"") appears too and every moment is solid gold but it is a tragedy that her version of ""My Man"" is truncated.

The DVD print of the film is only OK which is disappointing. There is a short film about the making of the film and this is invaluable because appearances are made by Ziegfield's daughter and Luise Rainer herself. In fact the whole DVD is worth viewing just to hear Rainer tell how she walked out on Louis B. Mayer ""...to save herself and here I am an old lady and I saved myself"" delivered with a radiant smile and a look of triumph which strips away the years. The theatrical trailer is included too.",1236816000,,1577,4.437931034482759
1237344,5,B00000JQUG,"In the course of my reading I have come across a great many references to Florenz Ziegfeld and his legendary ""Ziegfeld Follies"".  But I knew precious little about them.  It seems that for three decades between 1907 and 1936 Flo Ziegfeld's lavish productions were all the rage on Broadway.  And why wouldn't they be?  The list of stars who performed in these shows reads like a ""who's who"" of show business during this period.  Recently, I came across a VHS copy of the epic three hour 1936 film ""The Great Ziegfeld"" at my local library.  It turns out that ""The Great Ziegfeld"" is not only a biography of this show business icon but the film also offers you an incredible opportunity to relax in your living room and  sample the best of the what the Follies had to offer all those years ago.  What you will discover is that these extravaganzas were postively ""stunning"".  There has never been anything else quite like the ""Follies"" before or since.

For me, what was really neat about watching ""The Great Ziegfeld"" was the opporunity to partake of actual performances by such legendary figures as Al Jolson, Will Rogers, Fanny Brice and the song and dance man Ray Bolger (later the 'Tin Man' in the ""Wizard of Oz"").  It easy to see why these folks were such crowd pleasers in their day.  But it was not just the so-called ""stars"" that made ""Ziegfeld Follies"" so special.  It was was the lavish sets and the cadre of beautiful girls who would appear in each show.  Literally hundreds of beautiful girls!  These shows truly were spectacular in every way!  And although this film was made more than 70 years ago I was glued to my TV the entire time.

As I mentioned earlier,  the film also doubles as a biography of Flo Ziegfeld....well, sort of.  The producers take liberal amounts of literary license with his life story.  We do learn that Flo will spare no expense to make sure that his shows are the most ostentatious productions on Broadway.  This penchant for lavish spending will land Flo in the poor house on more than one occasion.  ""The Great Ziegfeld"" also focuses on  Flo's personal life including his long-time common-law marriage to the Polish born performer  Anna Held (played by Luise Rainer) and his subsequent marriage to actress Billie Burke (played by Myrna Loy).  Indeed, I would be remiss if I failed to mention the outstanding music in this film by Walter Donaldson and the great Irving Berlin.

""The Great Zeigfeld"" won three Academy Awards in 1936 and was nominated for four more.  Kudos to William Powell for a splendid performance as Flo Ziegfeld. I found this to be an outstanding film on so many levels.  It is a movie that I could watch again and again.  Highly recommended!",1235433600,4,2700,4.661016949152542
1237356,4,B00000JQUG,"I almost gave up on this three-hour film around the 45-minute mark because of Luise Ranier's shrill and annoying character, plus there hadn't been much in the way of music which is what I wanted in this film in the first lace.

However, after the first hour the story picks up considerably with the music numbers and some nice-looking and interesting women. I liked Myrna Loy playing Billie Burke. In fact, I like Loy a lot more than Burke in everything! This was my first look at Fanny Price, who reminded me of Barbra Streisand with her looks and Brooklyn accent.

William Powell, playing Flo Ziegfeld, was, of course, the undisputed star of the film. He was terrific, too, start-to-finish. Powell had great screen presence and was a good choice for this role. Frank Morgan played his normal role with that stupid laugh of his, but he was good as Ziegfeld's generous friend. Another famous name of the day, Myrna Loy, gets good billing in here but not much of a role.

Some of the sets on the Ziegfeld Follies are amazing Busby Berkely-type extravaganzas that certainly mark the 1920s and '30s. The line, ""They don't make 'em like that anymore"" certainly rings true. It's also true they look corny today, but they're still fascinating to watch.

If I was older and had lived through some of this time period, I would really feel nostalgic watching this film, sad for an era now long gone.",1234915200,2,1390,4.661224489795918

1237358,4,B00000JQUG,"THE GREAT ZIEGFELD was another big one for MGM, a biopic extravaganza in which the life of Florenz Ziegfeld was used as a sounding board for a variety of ever more spectacular musical numbers. Along the way, there are brief respites for some guest stars (Ray Bolger and Fanny Brice - her line, ""For Ziegfeld, I gotta be an urchin... even in burlesque, I was middle-class"", is priceless), and mind-numbing musical numbers (how were those supposed to be done live on stage?), tied to a story of Ziegfeld's life and loves. This was not only a box office smash, it was also a big award magnet, winning the Academy Award as Best Picture as well as the award for Best Actress for Luise Rainer's portrayal of Anna Held. Now: this is an example of the height of frivolity, because Anna Held was a great sex symbol in her day (the turn-of-the-century equivalent of Brigitte Bardot in the 1950s) and the waif-like Luise Rainer is anything but... But does it matter? Rainer gets to do a celebrated smiling-through-tears telephone act (impressive enough for her to win the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress, which paved the way for the inevitable Oscar), and Myrna Loy shows up as Billie Burke (Mrs. Ziegfeld Number Two), though this caused the real Billie Burke no end of distress (she couldn't see why she shouldn't play herself).

Today it does seem overly long on musical numbers that could have been cut and short on storyline. There are probably several reasons that the picture could have been better and wasn't, the primary reason being that at the time the film was made Ziegfeld had only been dead four years and was thus still fondly and recently remembered. Also, according to the little featurette that comes with the DVD, Ziegfeld's widow Billie Burke was heavily involved in the making of the film and wouldn't allow anything in it to besmirch his memory. Finally, the production code had just begun to be sternly enforced in 1934, making a true accounting of Ziegfeld's personal life pretty much impossible. As a result Ziegfeld is portrayed as just the unluckiest of fellows who is always being wrongly perceived as a ladies' man just because his business involves large numbers of chorines. In fact, Ziegfeld cheated on both wives incessantly, and Ziegfeld never even formally married Anna Held to begin with - instead they had a common law marriage according to the statutes of New York. However, none of these other factors can account for the complete lack of chemistry between Powell (Ziegfeld) and Loy (Billie Burke) in the film. Considering how the two had already been in several movies together by the time this film was made, and that they never failed to sparkle on screen together in the other movies, there must have been either a complete lack of direction or over-direction to wind up with the rather wooden performance that results whenever the two are in scenes together.

This movie would probably warrant only about three stars if it wasn't for William Powell's performance. Marvelous as always, he was at least allowed to portray Ziegfeld as the cagey trickster and gambler with tremendous class that he was, and he absolutely makes the film. I can't think of any other actor of that time period who could have done as good a job. As far as video quality, I was surprised at the scratchiness of the video portion of the transfer. There are numerous artifacts in the video that can be quite distracting at times, and at other points the video looks nearly perfect. There are only two extras features. One is a featurette lasting under ten minutes on the film and Ziegfeld's life with Luise Ranier, Ziegfeld's daughter, and others.

But when the production numbers begin at about the second hour, the senses are overwhelmed. I don't think I've ever seen a more spectacular production--ever--in 30 years of viewing movies.  No superlative adequately expresses this production. More beautiful girls than you ever saw, more beautiful gowns, more beautiful music, just doesn't exist anywhere else on celluloid. I wonder who the handsome crooner was? His voice was haunting in its beauty.

The third hour is part melodrama, part musical production. The circus number is first-rate, but doesn't match the sheer genius of the 2nd hour.

One stage number shows many balloons floating slowly towards the camera and behind them is one scene after another of beauty. Another number shows a line of dogs standing still while girls dance around them. Another great number shows couples living in fancy houses, but the scenery is on moving platforms, three of them, and each one moves at a different time. The couples are singing in this scene.

1237389,4,B00000JQUG,"THE GREAT ZIEGFELD, often misspelled as Ziegfield, a lavish biopic from the consistently underrated MGM director Robert Z. Leonard (did the ""Z"" stand for ""Ziegfeld""?  I don't think so).  The true facts of Flo Ziegfeld's marriage to soubrette Billie Burke may never be known, but Eve Golden's 2000 biography of Anna Held gave a good, wide-screen picture of his charm and business savvy.  In Leonard's film, William Powell is magnificently sensual and aristocratic, while Luise Rainer breaks your heart as the petite, submissive, flirtatious Anna.  Her famous phone scene won her the Oscar; when she uses the telephone to congratulate Flo on his marriage to Billie Burke, her regret and sorrow and loss play directly into the camera, which seems to eat them up like so much chocolate.  Rainer's acting is hammy, though not as much as contemporary actresses like Meryl Streep or Jessica Lange, both of whom would have swallowed the phone for an Oscar.

People in the 1930s must have laughed at the idea of Myrna Loy playing Billie Burke, seeing as though they had the real Billie Burke right there to compare to her and as everyone knows, they are absolutely nothing alike.  Though the offstage Billie Burke must have been more of a femme fatale than we think of ""Glinda"" as being, she denied, for example, having sex with Flo while he was still married to Anna.  That would have spoiled her somewhat sexless, daffy image, sort of the Carol Channing of her day.  The movie invents a fictional showgirl and has Virginia Bruce play her with a rapacity and blowsy sex lure not seen again until the recent Elizabeth Berkley classic SHOWGIRLS with Gina Gershon.  Berkley and Gershon seem like virgins compared to Virginia Bruce playing ""Audrey.""

In other casting, having Fannie Brice playing herself must have been a no-brainer, but the truth is that the great stars of Ziegfeld made very few movies and were skittish about playing for the movie cameras.  Or else they weren't good looking enough (like Ethel Merman)!  Or else they were black and so doomed to underemployment in the racist structures of classic Hollywood cinema--think of Bert Williams for example, a star on Broadway, a nobody in Hollywood.  Or else they had signed up to other studios and weren't available for MGM--Eddie Cantor made plenty of money for Sam Goldwyn, W.C. Fields for Paramount.  Will Rogers, for example, had a long term contract with Fox and before his tragic 1935 had entertained a proposal by which he would have left Fox for MGM, nixing it saying, I've got a good thing going here as Fox's biggest star, but at MGM I'd just be another Fannie Brice.

Thus we get Ray Bolger in THE GREAT ZIEGFELD.  And Harriet (""Who?"") Hoctor.  Still it's spectacular and no picture that introduces the divine Dennis Morgan can, in my opinion, receive anything fewer than four stars.",1127952000,3,2847,4.871369294605809
1237390,5,B00000JQUG,"Covering forty years of a man's life from 1893 until 1932 in a hugely engrossing 184 minutes of screen time (plus intermission), THE GREAT ZIEGFELD (1936, MGM) is the summit of the so-called Golden Age of Hollywood, a ""guilty pleasure"" masterpiece, and a richly deserved Best Picture Oscar winner.  Nothing could be more suitable for family viewing now, except for the length with working people and students who have to get to bed after homework.  Maybe a Friday or Saturday night.  The life story of Broadway showman Florenz Ziegfeld, Jr. (a wonderfully cast William Powell), the film opens at the 1893 Chicago World's Fair with a young Ziegfeld (""Flo"") promoting a strong man named Sandow (Nat Pendleton).  His main competition across the midway is Billings (Frank Morgan) with a dancing girl named Little Egypt.  Billings and Flo will become lifetime friends from this beginning.

Around the 45 minute mark of a slow first hour, undeserved Oscar winner Luise Rainer shows up as Gay 90s European singer Anna Held.  (Rainer is very good in the supporting role, but no match for Best Actress competitors Greta Garbo in CAMILLE or Carole Lombard in MY MAN GODFREY.)  Held's big number is ""It's Delightful to be Married.""  Off-stage, she seemingly becomes Ziegfeld's first wife.

THE GREAT ZIEGFELD becomes absolutely spectacular in its second hour-and for a full hour.  Dazzlingly choreographed back to back musical numbers include the Oscar-winning ""A Pretty Girl is Like a Melody"", ""You Never Looked So Beautiful Before"", and the mind-blowingly lavish ""Wonderful You"".  Only one studio in Hollywood could have made this fabulously entertaining movie that keeps topping itself with musical numbers for half an hour on either side on a theatrical intermission.  (Entr'acte and prologue music have been restored to the VHS tape version I am reviewing.)  It is all enthralling and exhausting.

At the beginning of the third hour, second-billed Myrna Loy finally shows up as Billie  Burke at a party and soon marries Flo.  (This confuses me.  The real Burke was still alive in 1936.  She was the Good Witch three years later in THE WIZARD OF OZ.  Why didn't she play herself here?)  Billings is still around as a pleasant pest to borrow money for rival stage productions.  For Barbra Streisand fans, the real Fanny Brice shows up for a few fun scenes.  And Anna Held divorces Flo over seeming adultery with a vain showgirl named Audrey (Virginia Bruce).  Then she has a telephone scene that is one of the most overrated scenes for me in Hollywood's history as she congratulates Flo on his marriage to Billie.  (One undistinguished telephone scene, and she wins a Best Actress Oscar over Garbo and Lombard?!)

The last 45 minutes of THE GREAT ZIEGFELD has Harriet Hocter play herself for another opulent musical number, ""A Circus Should Be Bigger in a Ziegfeld Show.""  A young lady from the film's first half hour, Sally, gets a show named after her.  We are up to the 1920s, and Ziegfeld has four shows running on Broadway at the same time. (One, RIO RITA, he personally supervised the 1929 film of.  It shows up now and then on Turner Classic Movies.)  Billings and Flo both go broke in The Great Crash.  The movie ends with the great showman's poignant death in 1932.

This MGM blockbuster, mammoth even by today's standards, was produced by Hunt Stromberg, directed by Robert Z. Leonard, and written by William Anthony McGuire.  In 1936, William Powell appeared in not just this cinematic sparkler, but also AFTER THE THIN MAN (also with Loy), MY MAN GODFREY (Oscar nomination), and LIBELED LADY (again with Loy).  It is a stupendous product of the Hollywood factory and star systems, and again it is about perfect for family viewing--complete with an intermission if you need to do its 184 minutes in two nights.

1237395,4,B00000JQUG,"""The Great Ziegfeld"" is a biographic film on Broadway impressario, Florenz Ziegfeld Jr., the man who ""glorified the American girl"". Determined to squeeze every last ounce of opulence from its coffers, MGM spared no expense in retelling what is essentially a melodrama with musical numbers tossed in for good effect.
Flo (William Powell)is a cheap carnival barker when he crosses paths with Anna Held (Luise Rainer). Their chemistry is instant and through her talent as an artist, fame comes to them both. However, all bliss is fleeting and their marriage ends when Flo takes up with a chorus girl. But he ditches her for sassy Billie Burke (Myrna Loy) and then proceeds to create a series of lavish spectacles that only MGM could afford to do justice to. The most spectacular of these remains ""A Pretty Girl Is Like A Melody""; a gargantuan revolving platform covered in dancers and art deco magificence.
Aside: Flo's second wife, Billie was a contract player at MGM during this time. Her best known role is as 'Glinda' the witch of the north in ""The Wizard of Oz"".
TRANSFER: Surprisingly smooth and very well balanced black levels and a good gray scale are the real selling features of this 3 hr. plus spectacle. Unfortunately an excess of age related dirt and scratches greet the viewer throughout the first hour of running time. However, things get cleaned up half way through for a really stunning transfer. Shadows and contrast levels are exemplary. The audio is clean, well balanced and quite simply, one of the best you are likely to encounter for a film of this vintage.
EXTRAS: A couple of featurettes that round out the history of the film - all too briefly.

While I like musicals (my husband, not so much), this one ok.  It was a long movie and did have a bit too much in the way of song & dance.  Despite Loy getting in on the top billings, she didn't enter the movie until way late (almost the end).  We were rather disappointed with that, but once she entered, Powell and Loy placed very well off each other (just as they did in the Thin Man movies).  The sad ending kind of left you walking away sad and rather made you forget about the rest of the movie.  All in all, the movie was ok.  I would recommend it, but not sure that I'd personally watch it too many times.",1498867200,,755,4.095238095238095
