1254103,2,B00002JWYZ,"Wicked City is essentially Ninja Scroll with a darker atmosphere, a slower plot, and more rape. In the story, there exist two worlds: this world, and the black world. The black world is full of supernatural beasts, some bloodthirsty, some peaceful. Two agents- Taki, a man from this world and Makie, a woman from the black world, are assigned as partners to protect an old man who is about to sign a peace treaty between the two worlds. But, a group of radicals from the black world want the old man killed. When Makie is captured, Taki puts his job aside to save his partner, and an interesting love story unfolds.
Action is rampant, and fight scenes are excellent, save for the fact that almost every enemy eventually transforms into a drooling, tentacle-bearing monster that enjoys raping Makie. Speaking of which, there's a ridiculous amount of twisted... activity in the movie, as well as a slew of other grotesque things that the movie could have easily done without. The story suffers from being too slow in too many places, and oftentimes I wanted to prod the plot right along. Despite some cool action scenes, Wicked City is a messy anime that isn't worth putting money into.",992995200,6,1184,4.752427184466019
1254104,5,B00002JWYZ,"I think many anime fans remember Yoshiaki Kawajiri for his work on the popular Ninja Scroll and his short work on Biohunter, but Wicked City stands at the appex of Yoshiaki's success. The story revolves around Taki, a software worker and Black Guard. After having an extremly close contact with a monster from the Black World, Taki is assigned to guard Josepy Mayart who will be used for signing a treaty for the Earth and the Black World. He goes to the airport to meet Mackie, his new partner, but runs into trouble with two Black World demons. Mackie comes just in time and saves Taki's life. They then meet Mayart, the comic relief of this film. Mayart prooves to be very amusing with his constant whining and complaining to be with women. Even his theme music is hilarious. Mayart is brought to special hotel, only to be attacked by a Black World demon with cool sunglasses. After making his upstairs to Mayart's room and having his way with Mackie, Taki pulls out his huge gun and makes quick work of him. Now the two have to go get Mayart who escaped through the bathroom. They find him at a bathouse being absorbed by another Black World demon. After they take her out, Mackie and Taki head over to the hospital to cure Mayart only to be stopped have way when Mayart spits out a parasite that has its way with Mackie. Taki and Mayart escape to the hospital and Taki is confronted with Black World demons having their way with Mackie. Taki head over to where she is only to be attacked by more Black World creatures. After taking out just about all of them, Taki faces great danger when the main leader's body turns into stone. However, Taki shoots right for the mouth and kills him. After the two report back, they are both fired from the case. After a little romantic drive and another appearence by Mayart, they run into a Black World spider girl that was shown early on. However, Mayart makes quick work of her. Taki and Mackie then awake in a church and get to know each other a little more. While Mayart helps destroy the leader who regenerated himself, Mayart reveals that this whole operation was to make a half-human\half-Black-World child. And Taki and Mackie are the ones to do it. After a sweat battle scene with all three of them against the leader, Taki and Mackie confess their love, head over to confrence and they both get their jobs back. Pretty sweat. Whatever category you can fit Wicked City into, its not your average film. Not your average action film, not your average sci-fi film and definetly not your average hentai film. The animation is that of Goku: Midnight Eye. The character desings are great and who doesn't love the odd design of Mayart. He's just too funny! The dubbing is very well done and is a lot better than that of Carl Macek's other dubbing works on Vampire Hunter D and Fist of the North Star. And I must compensate Carl for the brilliant way he dubbed the song playing on the radio during a slow romantic scene. With comedy, action, monster, secret service, hentai, romance and many elements from shows like the X-Files, this is a must see movie. It's exciting, fast and never gets boring. Highly recommended.",983059200,,3161,4.566901408450704
1254105,5,B00002JWYZ,"Then buy this tape. This is not ""Pokemon"" nor is it like ""Sailor Moon"". Its gritty, well drawn animation that is entertaining from start to finish.

1254106,2,B00002JWYZ,"Cops meets Demon City in a world vividly recreated by some fine artists in this anime. The story is a little dry really but interesting. For the most part it is a worthy purchase but many will find it too dull if they expect another Demon City. The movie never quite harnesses it's opening eerie environment, and then loses its hold on you as the story drags on. The themes are mature and there is nudity and graphic violence. Basically a cop must fight demons before they come and take over the dimension in which humans live. A dirty old man is the secret to stopping them and he is hired to protect him. A few laughs involving the old mans ruthless desires to the demon woman who was sent to also protect him. The cop falls for the demon girl in text book format and the story progresses until you wake up.",980208000,2,809,4.294117647058823
1254107,4,B00002JWYZ,"The art and storyline in this anime are intriguing.  It has a well-developed plot which focuses on two agents of the Black Guard.  These two are helping preserve the peace between the two worlds -- our world, and the more sinister shadow world.
There are some rather graphic and violent scenes.  But one becomes engrossed in the story, and what becomes of our protagonist Take -- and the black world woman he begins to romantically fall for.",971740800,,441,4.701298701298701
1254108,5,B00002JWYZ,"Wicked City was the best Japanimation movie I have ever seen. It is filled with action suspense, horror, and comedy. I sugjest this movie to anybody who likes movies period.",970704000,,173,4.8
1254109,4,B00002JWYZ,"It seems like the 1990's have seen a slump in creative horror movies. Chainsaw wielding psychopaths and kids running through forests screaming  seemed to be the best the genre had to offer. Thankfully, our Japanese  neighbors have saved us.
For starters this film doesn't just have sex...  it oozes it; and not in the titilating Playboy fashion but more in the  terrifying, animalistic, black widow sense. Secondly, the plot is highly  intelligent: two worlds (ours and the ""Black World"")whose  peaceful co-existance is threatened by radical extremists. A human and a  Black World warrior must protect an old man who has helped maintain the  peace for two centuries. And still all is not as it seems (surprise,  surprise).
To be honest this film can be rather gross at times. The twice  raping of the female protagonist didn't feel warranted to me and the  morphing of a female Black Worlder into a giant female reproductive system  made me neausous. Not for the young or the sensitive. But if you can look  beyond these, you are in for an original film experience.",967334400,,1065,4.88268156424581
1254110,5,B00002JWYZ,"Traditionally, amine' has been most popular as a sophisticated form of animation that was obviously foreign in design and both flamboyant and uninhibited in subject matter and delivery. Over the past several years, the genre has continued to evolve and mature, and ""Wicked City"" stands at the forefront of that evolution.
The animation is near CG in quality. Although the graphic violence and highly sensual nature of the film makes Wicked City more adult than standard anime', this production is unusual in that it presents characters the viewer can connect with on both an intellectual and emotional level. In short, rather than the usual comic book style caricatures inherent in most Western animation, ""Wicked City"" provides a hero and heroine who are almost human, possessing developed personalities and believable individual traits. In fact, by the end of the film, both Take and Makiye (pronounced Mak-e-a) are closer to live action science fiction characters than anime' characters.
The story line is classic anime'; the traditional battle between good and evil. The protagonists have the responsibility to ensure the safety of the critical delegate who can ensure the success of treaty negotiations between Earth and the Dark World. Subversive ""radicals"" are out to do anything they can to stop them. However, ""Wicked City"" moves well beyond routine action lines, developing into a clever sci-fi/drama, drawing the viewer into a strangely believable, surrealistic world of tomorrow. The ending is both oddly credible and very satisfying.
For those who want something a cut above the ordinary, this one works. Don't miss it!",961718400,7,1632,5.329457364341085
1254111,4,B00002JWYZ,"From the team that brought us ""Ninja Scroll"" and ""Demon City Shinjuku"" comes an anime title that is sure to blow you away. The animation is good, especially when Taki is forced into a fight to the death  against demons from the Black World at the Tokyo Airport. The music is a  little above average, about what you got in ""Demon City  Shinjuku"". Yet I must give warning to all this is not a film for  anyone under seventeen. This is due to the fact that a main pillar to the  plot is sex!
The story occures near the end of the millenium. It is time  when the people of earth must renew a treaty with another dimension known  as the black world. Taki is a member of the Black Gaurd, a secret agent  from Earth that is assigned to protect the life of a Black World ambassador  for 24 hours. Yet on this mission he is assigned a beautiful partner from  the Black World. But grauding the ambassador is not going to be easy as  rebels from the Black World relentlessly try to kill him.
This anime is  what brought about the widely sucessful movie ""Men in Black"". The  amount of sex and violence is some of the highest ever, yet it is essential  to the story. If you want something diffrent and slightly bizzar in the  sci-fi genre then you need look no farther. As if I even need to say this  next part. Warning this film contains Strong violence, Gore, Nudity, Strong  Sexual Situations, Rape and Strong Language.",961286400,5,1409,4.337164750957855
1254112,5,B00002JWYZ,"I was lucky enough to see this movie for the first time on the big screen in 1994, when it made its very limited US theatrical run.  Part ""X-Files"" and part bondage film, ""Wicked  City"" has more twists and turns than a roller-coaster and plenty of exciting and erotic thrills.  It's also an excellent  example of Gothic-inspired horror and dynamic tension, as the action stops  and starts again, often unexpectedly and jarringly.  The art is also  unusually spectacular, unusual because most of the colors are very dark and  muted: lots of blues, purples and blacks, which contribute in no small way  to the many creepy moments in the film.  Highly stylized and slickly drawn,  ""Wicked City"" tells the story of two agents , one human and one  Black World Warrior, who must protect the Earth against subversive  terrorists from the same Black World.  Without giving anything away, let's  just say that HIGHLY unusual and violent events follow.  This is DEFINITELY  NOT for children, and some adults as well...if you have a weak stomach or  are put off by violence or blatantly erotic imagery, this flick is probably  not for you.  However, if you like to be pushed to the limits in your  movie-going experience, then by all means, buy this movie...NOW!",950313600,,1251,4.834123222748815

1254134,4,B00002JWYZ,"If Stuart Gordon made an anime, it would probably look a lot like this. Lots of slimy Lovecraftian ultra-violence combined with kinky thrills and badass gunplay. But this is neither a work of art or an animation classic. The scenes of sexual violence executed with appalling bad taste make it really hard to enjoy this movie without guilt or utter disgust. The plot is also quite thin and has some ridiculous twists that will hurt your brain. But I like the movie anyway for its exciting action-horror elements and the superb animation. The DVD also kicks ass with lots of cool extras.",1495584000,5,585,4.745098039215686

If you don't already know, Wicked City is from the same makers of anime classics like Ninja Scroll and the more recent Redline. Wicked City is one of their earlier works from the late 80s, and is rich with violence and over-the-top Japanese sexuality, but if a NSFW anime movie isn't a problem for you, this is film belongs in any serious anime collection.",1482105600,6,602,4.742857142857143

1254162,5,B00002JWYZ,"This movie kicks off strong as our hero Taki goes home and gets lucky with a woman who turns out to be a spider demon! Maaaaaybe not so lucky.  After sex she transforms, with her arms eerily elongating and her lady parts becoming a menacing toothed maw.  I see where Tokyo Gore Police (2008) got the idea.  Not to be confused with some pornographic hentai, this very mature Anime does feature abundant nudity and sex scenesand ""sex-like"" scenes.  It also manages to mix some romantic elements into this otherwise largely perverse movie.

Our human world and the Black World, a parallel dimension, have had a treaty in place for centuries.  The denizens of the Black World must use approved channels to come to our world and when they violate these rules, members of the Black Guard keep them in check--Taki is one of them.  The Black Guard is a lot like the Men in Black (1997), operating in secret to protect people from the harm and even frightening knowledge of these extra-dimensional beings.

Now that the 1851 treaty is nearing an end, a new treaty must be signed and interdimensional political turmoil ensues as Taki and a Black Guard from the other side (Makie) must team up to protect an important old man from assassination attempts by Black World demon radicals.

All manner of weirdness can be found.  Weaponized ribcages, prehensile gut tentacles and a crawling eye-stalked head are all reminiscent of The Thing (1982) and likely pay kind homage to its effects.

There's also prehensile hair, strangely erotic engulfing and elongating fingernails of death.  We find various succubus demons seeking to engulf their victims in various ways, demonic parasites, stone demons, the return of our web-slinging (from her crotch) spider demon, and spiky tentacle demons that regenerate.  Clearly, this movie is loaded with awesomeness.

Whether you love Tokyo Shock cinema like Tokyo Gore Police (2008) and Vampire Girl versus Frankenstein Girl (2009), or simply love anima and weird stuff, you should probably give this classic demon Anime a shot.

1254184,1,B00002JWYZ,"Yoshiaki Kawajiri's WICKED CITY, based on a similarly titled book by Hideyuki Kikuchi (who also wrote VAMPIRE HUNTER D) has its share of devoted fans who consider this a classic in the halls of Anime, but I stand firmly behind this review.

This is a disgustingly vulgar, reprehensibly distasteful, and needlessly gory animated mess with little in the way of genuine appeal.  Despite a promising start and a potentially interesting plot, WICKED CITY goes all out on shock value at its most repulsive level -- to the point that whatever virtues it may have are all but forgotten.  It's misogynistic as well, with extensive scenes involving a female character being raped (three times!), and other two femme fatales who use their sexuality as a weapon to deceive and/or kill unsuspecting prey.  As mentioned, it's also quite violent, with plenty of moments involving blood splattering, again for no specific reason other than violence for the hell of it.  Shock value for shock value's sake does not a good film make, animated or otherwise.

Too bad, because WICKED CITY does have a few moments of redeeming qualities, although as mentioned, they aren't enough to elevate my star rating.

The film's opening half hour is arguably the best; sans again another sequence that will make one queasy.  The sequence in question involves Taki Renzabur', a salesman by day, spy by night, who lands a ""date"" of some sort with a pretty girl at a bar after winning a bet.  She takes him to her home, and, after an extensive sexual intercourse session, she transforms into some sort of monster with spidery legs.  Her VAGINA, of all things, even transforms into a fearsome maw with sharp teeth!  Taki survives the encounter, and his boss reminds him to ""be a little more sexually cautious from now on.""  Shocking and revolting as that opening scene is, it is practically nothing compared to the other graphic bits that happen throughout this seemingly never-ending 80-minute ""thriller.""

Following that unpleasant episode, we learn that Taki is a spy for some sort of ""Black Guard"", which apparently helps keep tensions between humanity and the ""Black World"" (in other words, monsters and ghouls) in check.  He is assigned to protect an ancient (200 years old) midget named Giuseppe Mayart who has come to sign a peace treaty that will ensure public safety.  Taki also meets Makie, a beautiful but skilled Black World woman who becomes his partner and something much more besides.  Their mission to keep Mayart safe from attacking ""Radicals"" who want to sabotage their efforts proves to be anything but easy.  Mayart, incidentally, is a most unpleasant character.  He's a repulsively lecherous, crude, and generally foul-tempered pain in the butt who arguably proves to be more troublesome than one would expect.  He refuses to stay put when his guardians take him to a hotel for his own good, goes off gallivanting to a ""soapland"" where he gets into trouble with a demon posing as a slut, and acts contemptuously toward the people who are in his best interests.

At this point, the film devolves into a back and forth series of violent confrontations involving nasty, nightmarish creatures, mostly in the form of rapists and seductive temptresses.  The most sickening of these creatures isn't even the last obstacle our heroes have to encounter.  Midway through the film, Makie and Taki are attacked by some sort of ""parasite"" no bigger than a tongue (I kid you not) which burrows its way into the former and bursts from her stomach, transforming into a phallic tentacle which takes the unfortunate girl captive and begins to sexually assault her.  As if that isn't enough to make one uneasy about seeing more, we are also treated to two other such scenes, both of which involve Makie being violated, and our hero coming to save her.  And so on and on it goes, to the point where it becomes tiresome.

If this is the sort of stuff viewers of Japanese animation demand, then WICKED CITY certainly delivers, but I found it to be very off-putting and too overdone.  Part of this may be because I am of the standard that works involving violence and sexual assaults should present the material in question if the plot commands for it, or at the very least doesn't do so gratuitously.  Satoshi Kon's far more interesting and arguably more terrifying PERFECT BLUE found the right balance in its effort to tell a ""break the innocent"" sort of story in which the protagonists is subjected to such atrocities and feels rightfully terrified because of it.  Here, however, the unpleasant bits are thrown at the viewer in non-stop fashion that whatever story it tries to convey ultimately becomes forgotten.  That, to me, is poor filmmaking, and it's a shame that Kawajiri's efforts are wasted on such a wretched work.

To Kawajiri's credit, however, WICKED CITY does sport an appropriately gothic, smoky atmosphere.  The animation, although at times limited, is smooth and legitimately frightening as opposed to being cheap and nasty.  Produced by the folks at MadHouse, who are legitimately known for lavishly animated and often times disturbing series, the monsters are imaginatively drawn and while the transformations may again rub viewers the wrong way, they are at the very least convincingly depicted without looking hokey.  On that level, WICKED CITY does at least excel.  Kawajiri also treats the picture like a live-action movie, and it shows from the skillfully edited and choreographed action bits.  It's almost enough to make the viewer forget that they're watching an animated feature.

The film, interestingly, received two different dubs around its release.  The version most American viewers are familiar with are done by Streamline Pictures, while international audiences had to endure a somewhat censored cut by Manga UK.  Neither is a particularly outstanding effort, but of the two, the Streamline dub, surprisingly, is more effective, which is not something I usually say when it comes to their output.  Their dubs have often been hit and miss, with most of their efforts (with the exception of Fox's MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO) being in truly dreary territory.  This is actually one of their better ones, with appropriately cast voices and smooth-sounding dialogue.  Greg Snegoff gives Taki a very natural, tough-guy persona to match his personality, while Gaye Kruger, Mike Reynolds, and the late Jeff Winkless all excel.  The Manga UK dub, on the other hand, is a seriously awful, laughable, choppy, stilted embarrassment with both bad acting as well as phony (and out of place) accents.  Save for some characters like Makie and Taki's boss, everyone else is miscast.  The dialogue adaptation is also needlessly profane, with smatterings of f-words every fifteen seconds as well as lines that come across as either rushed or so bad they're funny such as ""Don't ever think you can win this battle, you pathetic ANIMAAAAAAAAL!""  Not having seen the Japanese version, I can't say how either version compares, but if it's English you want to hear this movie in, the Streamline version is the less cringeworthy one.

Discotek Media has recently rescued WICKED CITY from the morgue of oblivion and will be including both dubs in their rerelease, with superior video quality to boot.  Considering the company's track record, fans will surely be pleased.  I, on the other hand, absolutely detest this film and I can not recommend it to anyone who is faint at heart or even for pleasurable entertainment. Or for ANY reason. So... take my review with a grain of salt.",1438300800,4,7548,4.996003197442047
1254185,5,B00002JWYZ,"I'll give it the full 5 but may take off half a star due to some of the background music in the film.  It's funny cause this is a common occurrence in many anime movies. Don't get me wrong,  there are many anime movies that have great soundtracks. For me, Wicked City just falls a little short in some parts of the soundtrack.  The movie itself is definitely a classic.  Not just in anime but in the sci-fi universe as well.  It came out in the late 80's and wasn't released in the U.S. till the early 90's.  Back in 92', my buddy in high school introduced me to such classics as Vampire Hunter D, M.D. Geist ,Appleseed and Akira!  To most fans of the genre, these are some of the ones that started it all. Wicked City is no exception and later came Ninja Scroll. Ah man, have to write a separate review for Ninja Scroll, it rocks! Wicked City along with those other greats helped show that cartoons could be just as graphic and violent as live action. Plus it could tell a great story at the same time. Live action movies could not recreate this kind of art, nor could CGI. When you think about it, classic animation is one of the most purest forms of art and cannot be replicated.  Wicked city and anime in general is the Anti-Disney. Speaking of the story, it takes place in modern times and portrays the relations between two worlds, earth and an alternate universe called the Black World.  In the black world, humans are not the dominate species.  The black world is like a demon world, a dark realm that most people don't want to know about or be associated with. Yet, it is there and very real. The inhabitants of the black world live in a violent kill or be killed environment. And at the same time, they have a kind of love-hate relationship with the earth. At times they are fighting and others at peace. There are guardians on both sides fighting to restore order. These guardians or black guards are elite fighters and help protect the freedoms of citizens of each world.  Now, bring in the 2 main characters of the film. Both are black guards, one from earth and the other from the black world.  They are forced to team-up and protect an important diplomat that is crucial to help bring a peace treaty to both sides. There is much more to the story but I will leave it at this. Lots of action,violence, blood, porn, comedy, and drama. Wicked City has it all. They also made a live action movie but it can't touch the animated version. Check it out!",1429228800,4,2461,4.37280701754386

I guess for me, I will praise the other items, as they are truly gorgeous items within the film.  The twists and turns within the plot keep you guessing till the very end, and the characters are, for me, the best part of the movie.  You really feel for some of them, and can't wait to see how some of them will meet their grisly end.

Many things have been said about this film based on a book and directed by ""Ninja Scroll"" director Yoshiaki Kawajiri. Things like ""disgusting"", ""classic"", ""dark"", ""horrible"", ""great"" and so on, many different opinions. Well I am somewhere in between all of that although I think anyone would agree with the dark thing, because it is. This is one of those films that will shock you if you don't know what type of flick you are getting into. You could throw it in there with the hentai type of Anime but that is only half of what the film is.

The people of Erath have been sharing their world with that of the ""Black World"" which the realm of demons. To help keep things peaceful between the two there is a group called the ""Black Guard"" and a new treaty needs to be signed. So a member from each realm [Taki {male human} & Mackie{female demon}] must come together to protect a negotiator until he can make the treaty happen. But radicals from the ""Dark World"" will stop at nothing to make sure that does not happen.

This film is full of atmosphere and style and of course all of it is dark. The horror element here is probably the strongest thing the film has going for it. The occult like story helps maintain your interest in the film even when things seem out of place. Now I am sure that when I say that most people will assume I am speaking of the sex related moments in the film. That is not true and while I think the film would have been fine without them the tone and nature of the film lend to the scenes. I am speaking of the comedic moments, which at times are funny but do not fit. This of course comes mostly from Giuseppi Mayart who is the guy the ""Black Guard"" must protect. I must say that he would be right at home on ""Dragon Ball Z"" alongside Master Roshi. Trust me if you have seen both then you will know what I am talking about.

Then of course we get the action which is good as is the animation, I kinda miss these older drawn ones. There is a nice twist towards the end that leads to a good battle but you will see for yourself. Still regardless this film just seems average to me which is good, it is not horrible. The demons are cool and the look of the film is just as good. There is one female demon here that would have been a big fan of the film ""Teeth"". Of course there are moments when you will be saying to yourself ""why does this not make sense"" and all I have to say is wait for the end, it becomes clear. Also on a side note Taki and Mackie were voiced in the dud by a mother and son acting team.

This isn't a bad film and for some people might be a great film. For me it is just a cool Anime, a good if average flick. If you don't mind rape and violent scenes in your Anime then this is for you indeed. But if you like the kid friendlier stuff then stay away. This has some cool stuff in it that make me want to recommend it to anyone who has yet to see it. But like I said it may not be for everyone, decide for yourself.",1377648000,2,2975,4.087328767123288

The thing that caught me up was all the Rape sceans, Sexualality and other things that was just unnessary I will say I don't mind alittle bit in Adult anime's but please don't go to far.  This one gose over the edge just a bit.

1254213,5,B00002JWYZ,"Still have this one on VHS with the old Streamline trailer that included classics like Akira, Neo Tokyo,Fist of the North Star, and Vampire Hunter D. Basically, the film's about a secret agent named Taki and his incredibly beautiful partner named Makie. They are assigned to protect a pint-sized pervert named Giuseppe Mayart who's coming to Tokyo to sign a 500 year old peace treaty between Earth and the Black World, a parallel dimension, which also happens to be where Makie is from. Throughout the film, the agents do battle with a host of weird creatures determined to sabotage the treaty.

This film contains explicit and offensive content, including a creature that resembles a giant phallus, sodomy, a very graphic rape scene, bad language, etc. At the same time, these elements are what sets this film and its director apart, his way of making even bad stuff look hot.

Hard to put my finger on exactly how (or why) he does this. The artwork is absolutely gorgeous. Kawajiri's trademark throughout all of his films are the long mysterious Japanese eyes and this film is probably his best in that regard as Makie has got to be the sexiest female ever in an anime.

But I can't stress this enough: this one is for adults only. A good example of hand-drawn artwork before 3D rendered artwork took over. Like the song at the end also. If you like Takashi Miike's stuff you should have no problem with this one.",1321574400,2,1415,4.69758064516129

Here's a break down of my ratings for the movie:

ANIMATION: 9/10

STORY: 6/10

CHARACTER DESIGN: 9/10

IMAGINATION & VISUALS: 8/10

So, OVERALL: 8/10

If you're already familiar Japanese Animation then the elements in this movie may be nothing new to you. But if you are a new comer then this movie may surprise you, shock you, or even offend you. But thank God for ""Freedom of Speech"" and ""Freedom of Expression"" because that is what WICKED CITY excels at with its presentations of horror, imaginative visuals, and story telling.

I first watched this film back in the mid-1990's when Japanese Animation was just getting its over due recognition in the United States. One of the great things about Japanese animation is that there are literally all Genre's within the realm of animation. There exist comedies, love stories, action, science fiction, mecha, dramas, martial arts....etc. This film happens to be an adult-themed horror/science fiction movie. If you like variety in the movies and animated films that you watch then this will be an interesting film for you.

But be warned, it lives up to its title of being TRULY WICKED.  (For Open-Minded Viewers Only)",1268524800,,1376,4.995614035087719
1254216,4,B00002JWYZ,". . . it was just the tip of the iceberg. Nothing graphic, or objectionably too-realistic (pornographic) but prurient in an adolescent way. The dated but still good animation cuts down an X-rating to a light R. Dubbing, which one reviewer dinged, seemed fine to me; actually the inflection and 'acting' was pretty good.  I was entertained, with not a few smirks throughout.

One of the better animes within this soft-porn/action genre. Could've been a pretty good movie; the CGI treatment would be interesting to see. If anyone wants to see a Japanese movie of this sort, see ICHI THE KILLER or FUDOH.",1214611200,2,601,4.825242718446602

Only one problem, Mayart is just a stubborn old sex crazed dude and he is the only one that can make peace between both worlds but how can can both Makie and Taki protect this man from the Radicals?

Bizarre and exciting 1987 Japanese animated horror/sci-fi/fantasy flick from the director of ""Ninja Scroll"" known as Yoshiaki Kawajiri is one of the most unusual and overlooked anime movies around. The animation is very good, the storyline is kind of complicated and is loaded with nudity, sex, gory violence and some humor as well. Makie is simply a gorgeous anime character guaranteed to arouse some anime fanboys, it's nowhere as excellent as Kawajiri's ""Ninja Scroll"" or ""Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust"" for that matter but it's still an enjoyable and nasty bit of Japanese animation.

This DVD has good picture and sound quuality with both English language and Japanese language with English Subtitle audio. The extras include trailers to this and other Urban Vision anime, biographies of the characters, interview with the director and Weblink.

Also recommended: ""Ninja Scroll"", ""Urotsukidoji: Legend of the Overfiend"", ""Ichi The Killer"", ""Akira"", ""Ghost in The Shell"", ""The Professional: Golgo 13"", ""Grindhouse"", ""Kite"", ""Lifeforce"", ""From Dusk Till Dawn"", ""Vampire Hunter D"", ""Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust"", ""Fist of the North Star"", ""X The Movie"", ""Sin City"", ""Re-Animator"", ""The X-Files: Fight the Future"", ""Men in Black"", ""Heavy Metal"" and ""Perfect Blue"".",1204243200,2,2219,5.141274238227147

The storyline is reasonably engaging.  I watched it in Japanese with English subtitles, since bad dubbing or voice-acting can ruin a movie for me.  I must admit that the animation is a bit primitive by today's standards--even when compared only to cell-drawn animation--but it wasn't really a big enough problem to detract from the movie.  There are a few instances in which presumably contemporary (to the movie's production) pop music intrudes upon the soundtrack; the music sounds dated and awkward in such a context but it only happens two or three times and fortunately only lasts thirty seconds or so.  The movie does suffer somewhat from some of the common problems found in anime such as ambiguous plot and vague action scenes and resolution.

If you wish to see a horror flick with great visuals, Blood the Last Vampire is a good option.  If you are looking for a horror flick with gratuitous gore and female nudity, Ninja Scroll is a good choice.  Lastly, if you are looking for an action/horror series, Hellsing is a great pick.

1254233,3,B00002JWYZ,"When Wicked City (also called Supernatural Monster City) was new, it was very impressive for its time. As anime evolves, a lot of what once made this anime stand out -- its adult theme, strange demons, and plot twists -- have become stereotypical standbys of the genre. While not as classic as such seminal movies as Akira, Wicked City still had a lot to offer anime fans.

The biggest flaw this movie has is its absolutely dreadful English dubbing, which manage to flatten out all interesting charactization, lose important plot details, mangle other plot details, and criminally distort much of the dialogue's actual meaning. (The English dubbed version of Wicked City drops the rating to one star.) If you insist on hearing it in English, at least turn on the English subtitles as well so you can see what you're not hearing. Better yet, just leave it in Japanese with English subtitles.

Be warned, this is an adult movie. There's sex, violence, rape, and at least one monster that will make male viewers gulp and cross their legs. Some of it's gratuitous (and some of it's tame in comparison to films like Urotsukidoji), but viewers who are okay with these kinds of topics will find much to enjoy.",1105401600,22,1202,4.774038461538462

Wicked city is fast moving action type of anime with a sexual overtones, some demonic shape-shifting, and some people seem to think its quite gorey...though I personally didn't think the gore was overdone...just part of the plot. At it core this film is really a cop movie...a cop movie that goes alot beyond the standard cop movie fare. The anime is a bit cartoonish, but is quite well done...though, I would dare say its more animated-film than anime.

I watch anime movies, but I'm not a fan of hentai and this movie didn't bother me. I've noticed some reviewers take particular qualm with the spider-woman from the black world...but personally I don't get the qualms..I thought it was an inventive additive that worked well within the plot.

To those who have problem with the old guy...I agree he can be a little over the top in an otherwise very serious plot, but thats part of the humor to me...i thought he was hilarious! He's great comic relief and keeps the rather dark film a bit in the light.

To me the film is really a modern take on a classic detective story. I highly reccomend it. To this day its one of my favorite animated films.

Ok, if you are reluctant of this movie because people tell you that its really gory/sex-oriented, then I feel you should see it for yourself.  I was severely disapointed on how little this made me cringe.  Yes, there is sex.  Yes, there is gore.  But NO, its not as bad as everyone says...unless you are easily grossed out.  There is probably one sex-like scene that made me squint, but otherwise nothing is that bad in this.  The worst you will see as far as nudity is concerned is female breasts and butts...there are a few questionable parts though (the spider-woman's use of her vaginal area for where she removes webbing).
The gore factor isn't as terrible as people say.  If you really want gore, then see some of the Hentai titles like Midnight Panther, or Demon Beast Invasion and this will seem like child's play.
PLOT:
The story isn't that bad, but it tends to lean towards female abuse and/or taking advantage of the female body.  The ending is what made me keep the DVD because it seemed like it leaned away from the over-used sex scenes and towards an actual story.
DVD:
The DVD is good, and it offers a lengthly interview with the director, bios on the characters, and the original trailer.  The menu is also easily navicable, which is a plus for these types of movies.  Also, as usual, the Japanese and English versions are available with the Japanese version creaming the dub as far as quality.
OVERALL:
To sum this movie/dvd up, I would say its like Ninja Scroll with sex and demons instead of nudity and ninjas.  I would get this DVD is you are a fan of Ninja Scroll, Demon City Shinjuku, or a Wind Named Amnesia.",1021507200,19,1640,4.54421768707483

I just cant belive it was made in 1987.",1016409600,2,851,4.937062937062937
1254240,5,B00002JWYZ,"This film is a big landmark picture in anime do to its art work and extrem adult contant. This pushed anime a step futher and made it more mainstrem. It has a very good story about shapeshiffiting demons who come to reek havic on earth. There is much more to the story than that but you can find that out for yourself. The DVD is good for anime.

1254241,1,B00002JWYZ,I caught this movie on late night cable about a month ago and it has disturbed me ever since.  I lost count in the amount of violence especially towards women.  How do you have a woman raped by two men and ten minutes later have sex with the one man she is attracted to and who saved her life. A woman is depicted as a spider who shoots webbing from her genetalia?  Movies like this make me wonder more about the persons who create this madness. All I can think of is that they are future rapists and serial killers.  My sons love Japanese anime.  I pray they never come across this movie.,1006732800,4,589,4.176991150442478
1254242,4,B00002JWYZ,"Wicked City is by far the nastiest, sickest, most twisted anime I have ever laid my eyes upon, and I love it!!!  While the storyline is far from original, there's enough blood, gore, nudity, and sex to keep you interested.  But be warned, if you have a weak stomach and are turned off by grotesque sexual imagery, this is not for you.  (I really sound like a freak don't I?)",997574400,6,374,4.314285714285714

7915820,5,B00002JWYZ,"A dark and morbid anime old school gem. Blurring the lines between anime and erotica without going too far into the latter. The story may seem nonsensical at times, but the artwork and old-school vibe more than make up for the stiff voice acting",1523232000,,245,4.590909090909091
7915821,5,B00002JWYZ,"One of the best anime's ever, and definitely not for kids due to lots of: violence, blood, gore, and sex. This movie just keeps you on the edge of your seat! Another classic of Earth battling aliens, and some of the aliens care for the Earth, as well. I love the plot, and as the movie unfolds, it is not what you originally thought it was. It is very cleverly done. The music is superior, and so are the crisp images of the movie, highly recommend! Two thumbs way up.",1522540800,,468,4.211111111111111

Great Anime Classic just be warned that even though it's a cartoon its got a lot of strong sexual explicit graphic scenes that'll likely make you feel like you're watching a anime hentai movie. lol Its got good action too, the animation for its time is amazing. Thanks Amazon! :)",1502064000,3,331,4.724137931034483
