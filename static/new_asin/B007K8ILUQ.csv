5092876,4,B007K8ILUQ,"I just watched the Blu-ray of Kubricks first feature Fear and Desire. Its taken me 40 years to finally see this movie (which Kubrick himself had suppressed) and I have to say it was an interesting experience. It certainly has its flaws, but it is still a fascinating piece of work and definitely ranks as a Kubrick film. Believe it or not, its kind of a mash up of The Thin Red Line and a Twilight Zone episode! Much of the dialogue (which was looped) is stilted and the dramatic structure is clumsy, but as a first time effort from a 24-year old, it is quite ballsy. The cinematography is stunning, which is really Kubricks strength here. The characters are ciphers for the most part, and the acting is a mixed bag. Frank Silvera (who would later play the villainous gangster boss in Kubricks next film, Killers Kiss) does the best work, while Paul Mazursky is the weakest playing a nutjob. Kubrick certainly got better with actors and scriptwriting (a mere ten years later he was doing Lolita and Dr. Strangelove!), but this first film is very much a flawed gem. Perhaps strangest of all is that the film has a couple of optical wipes, which I believe are unique to the Kubrick canon. Im guessing he had to use these to get out of an editing jam. There are no extras to speak of (a pity), unless you count the inclusion of The Seafarers. Too bad they didn't get Mazursky to do a commentary! Curiously, his character recites material from Shakespeares The Tempest, which the actor-turned-director went on to make as a film himself 30 years later. Not sure what to make of that! All in all, a satisfying experience. I wasn't disappointed.",1353196800,18,1638,4.574829931972789
5092877,5,B007K8ILUQ,"The restoration is amazing - almost worth watching just for this reason alone. Of course the reason to watch this is if you strongly like Stanley Kubrick's work. Otherwise you'll likely take notice to its low-budget and mostly average performances too much. It's fun to watch if you're interested, like I was, to see a filmmaker just getting started, developing his style, with strong hints of what would come from him later. The scene between the soldier and the young woman taken prisoner is probably the highlight of the film. The violent sequences are simple but effective; the shot selection and editing is what makes it work. I give it 5 stars mainly because it was good to finally see Kubrick's first film, one that I thought would never be available on DVD. Kubrick dismissed this film, I can see why. He couldn't get over its flaws but, somehow, I think he'd be OK with people seeing this film now, knowing that the viewers appreciate the mark he left in filmmaking.",1352937600,7,975,4.707602339181286
5092878,3,B007K8ILUQ,"FEAR AND DESIRE (1953)
A little-known, rarely seen, low budget, Military Adventure film.
Short, crudely edited, and with a crew of only 15 people, Fear and Desire is Stanley Kubrick getting to grips with his style. He later tried to prevent it from being screened, since he had little love for his debut.
Fear and Desire is not extraordinary. Only a true Kubrick fan would love it.

It's Kubrick, warming up for his greatness to come.

P.S. I hope you enjoyed this short review, and read my other Kubrick reviews. Thanks!",1351641600,10,521,4.714285714285714
5092879,3,B007K8ILUQ,"""Fear and Desire"" had, for me at least, always been this mythical film until recently (when it was shown on TCM and then issued on DVD/blu-ray).  I ordered up the Blu-ray, to add to my Kubrick collection, and found it to be more interesting from a historical and artist-development perspective on a great filmmaker, than finding it to be a good film I'd watch more than once - he'd make far, far better war pictures with ""Paths of Glory"" and ""Full Metal Jacket"".  I don't think anyone will mistake this for his best work, but as a seldom seen first feature effort (also included on this disc is a half-hour film he made for a seaman's union), it's essential viewing for any serious Kubrick fan.  There are moments in ""Fear and Desire"" that do hint at what was to come from Kubrick (composition of shots, interesting angles, striking images) and when you consider that within the decade, he'd deliver both ""The Killing"" and ""Paths of Glory"", it's pretty apparent that he developed his own style in relatively short span.  As for the restoration, both films on the disc look good considering their age, especially ""Fear and Desire"", compared to some very grainy multi-generation-knocked-down footage I saw in a side-by-side comparison.  It looks about as good as it probably ever will, at this point.  Added reason to watch: A very young Paul Mazursky as an unhinged soldier, kinda hamming it up.",1350950400,2,1394,4.7875
5092880,5,B007K8ILUQ,"Finally the long forgotten first film by the legendary director Stanley Kubrick has been released on a home video format for the first time and it is truly a sight to behold.
 There was believe it or not a time when Stanley Kubrick wasn't one of the biggest names in film history, Yes, that's right, Stanley Kubrick, a man who's Career in the industry has no equal started out as a nobody who had to raise funds from family and friends to start production on what would be his first full motion picture, and like most directorial debuts, it was a box office failure, even after having been given high praise by some notable critics at the time, audiences just didn't care for it.
 It's been said many times that Kubrick was before his time, and the same can be said about this film. At a mere 60 minute's, it is by far Kubrick's shortest movie, and lest polished, but contained in it's short run time are the ideas that gave birth to the style of film making that Kubrick continued to used and hone throughout the remainder of his career.
 My personal thought's about the film the first time i watched it(this was many years ago) were that of the audiences, i didn't see anything of the man that Hollywood considered one of it's best. Now Many years latter and after several reviewing's i've realized that i was so so wrong. It's easily understandable for a person to say that a older low budget film like this sucks when they've seen films like 2001: A Space Odyssey, you have to look at this film a little more deeply to see the true skill of it's creator at work.
 Throughout the rest of his life Kubrick shunned this film, was embarrassed by it, he even tried buying up as many original film prints as he could find, with the plan of preventing it from ever being seen again. Thankfully he didn't get them all, and now it has been beautifully restored in high definition and released for the world to enjoy and to see first hand how one of the greatest directors of all time got his start. If you are a Stanley Kubrick fan then you must own this film, cherish it, and be happy it still exists.",1350950400,17,2097,4.383033419023136
5092881,4,B007K8ILUQ,"The fact this DVD also includes ""The Seafarers"" makes it a must-have for Kubrick film collectors.  Both ""Fear and Desire"" and ""The Seafarers"" have been beautifully restored.  You have to wonder as you watch ""Fear and Desire"" if Rod Serling didn't find inspiration in it for his ""The Twilight Zone"" series that first appeared 6 years later.  The sense of foreboding enhanced by the score and the cinematography are great.  The script has its moments and the existential message is clear.  Visually, the acting is really good.  Unfortunately, the dialog is obviously dubbed and not very well at all.  Sometimes I wondered if, as in some David Lynch films, the underacting was intentional, but I decided it wasn't.  I give it 4 stars for its historical significance and its beauty.  I am a huge Kubrick fan and this DVD completes my collection with the exception of his earliest shorts.  ""The Seafarers"" is a commercial film done for the Seafarer's International Union.  It was, unquestionably, ahead of its time for such documentary films.  In addition, we learn a lot about the union's benevolent benefits and wonder at the luck of those fortunate enough to be its members.",1424736000,,1172,4.923469387755102

5092885,1,B007K8ILUQ,"I love Kubrick's films...normally. But this one, his first, is too painful. I bought a copy and watched it...and not since Space Jam have I felt robbed of not only my money, but my wasted time.

To be honest, I couldn't even finish the film, it was that bad.

Right off the bat, the acting and locations are hollow, secondly, the Americans are wearing German Helmets with WW2 Marine Cammies, along with their uniforms. Even their web gear is German and American. The Pilot has on a Fifty Mission Crush hat and the wrong insignia. The 'German' Spotter plane is a Piper Cub down to its civilian paint and civil registration numbers. The German soldiers are wearing a mix of uniforms and wearing US steel Helmets. The so called German General certainly lacks respect of his troops, who are on perpetual relaxation around him in a war zone instead of on guard. The US Troops openly build a raft on a bare beach in full exposure behind enemy lines and worry about being spotted! Thats using military discipline and skill!! *Sarcasm*

The acting and narration....Horrid, absolutely horrid!

I literally quit watching the film within the first half hour, its that bad!",1389312000,4,1161,4.7611940298507465
5092886,3,B007K8ILUQ,"Superb acting makes this film work, the storyline is forceful and the plot is good. Obviously as an older film the technology is not first rate, but the trench warfare is well done.

5092889,1,B007K8ILUQ,Kubrick's first effort proves that genius is not always born; it's often taught. And the fact that he chose to bury this movie for 60 years also shows that he knew his own potential - and how short this first effort had fallen.,1383264000,3,227,4.3023255813953485
5092890,5,B007K8ILUQ,"My entire life I've waited to view Fear and Desire - the masterpiece that Stanley Kubrick had tried to destroy.

The story goes that Stanley worked to buy back and destroy every print except the one in his archives. I know that there was a print in collection in NYC but that might as well have been a world away from me.

The Kino restoration is crisp and striking. The only drawback is the complete lack of special features.

Now my collection is complete... It was sad,sir, to realize watching this film that it was the LAST time I would see new Kubrick work.

Many have tried to be Stanley (there have been many pretenders - Spielberg's A.I. and Minority Report, STARZ attempt at Spartacus, attempts at Napoleon...) but there will never be another Stanley Kubrick. And there will never be another chance to see new work from the master.

Hopefully later there will be a blu-ray with special features. But for now, this Kino Restoration is amazing.",1375488000,2,951,4.636904761904762

5092893,5,B007K8ILUQ,"Whether you were inclined or disinclined to cozy to director Stanley Kubrick there is no denying that he was a unique visionary artist who was unimatable.  The common thread I see in these reviews is that ""Fear and Desire"" is a work of a novice director on a low budget.  I will agree that Kubrick had limited resources but I would argue that he made the most of what little was made available to him.  The theme of the brutality of war and the dehumanizing effects it has in those engaged in it comes across loud and clear and this is a piece with ""Paths of Glory"" and ""Full Metal Jacket"" where budgets weren't as much of a concern.  It's pretty daring when you consider that the U.S. had only been removed from World War II a scant eight years and were now engaged in the Cold War.  If there is any flaw here it may be in the script by Howard Sackler which is a bit heavy handed.  Kubrick compensates, however, by projecting stark images on the screen that sear themselves to your soul.  The story here is of two unidentified combatants one being a group of soldiers crashlanded in enemy territory trying to claw there way back to their home base.  The scene where the group slaughter their opposites while they are consuming cold stew will leave your draw drop.  Another powerful scene is when the men kidnap and tie a peasant girl to a tree and leave a green private to guard her while they look for a raft they misplaced.  The private played by Paul Mazursky, who would later become a renowned director in his own right, exhorts the girl to forgive him as he slowly descends into madness.  I also like the conceit that the actors who play the lieutenant and private from one side play the general and captain from the other side and voice the same reservations about the toll war takes on man's psyche.  I don't know if casting the same actors was an artistic stroke of genius or a budgetary constraint but it works.  It would be interesting if you screened this film for an audience who didn't know it was a work of Kubrick's and what their reaction would be.  Also included on this disc is ""The Seafarers"", a promotional film for the International Seafarers Union that Kubrick was hired to direct.  There is nothing artistic about this exercise other than as a tool to attract dues paying members to the union.  For Kubrick fans the only nuggets left out there are two short subjects he made prior to this film, ""The Day of the Fight"" and ""The Flying Padre"".",1368576000,,2465,4.444444444444445
5092894,5,B007K8ILUQ,Great re-release of Kubrick's early work. A nice addition to any classic director series. Glad that this DVD has been reissued,1366156800,,126,5.0476190476190474
5092895,2,B007K8ILUQ,"There's a reason Kubrick disowned this film after its release. The movie, while it has an interesting plot, suffers from poor writing, poor acting, and general poor quality. It could have been so much more, granted it was done with a skeleton crew with a low budget, but Kubrick could have tried harder.",1363046400,,303,4.735849056603773
5092896,3,B007K8ILUQ,"I honestly didn't know anything about the story of Kubrciks first film.  I never expect a fiction world surrounded by war.  I guess this 1953 reflects the concerns of a young American about war.  Madness, murders, meaningful life etc...  It is not really a good film, but help us to show young Kubrick's concerns, for example in Paths of Glory...",1362787200,,346,4.716666666666667
5092897,2,B007K8ILUQ,"Director Stanley Kubrick's first film was made available for purchase late 2012.  Finally Kubrick fans, like me, were able to view the debut of a cinematic legend.  There are some items worthy of praise here namely the cinematography and the inventive editing.  The story itself follows a group of soldiers trapped behind enemy lines trying to march back undetected to friendly territory.  Unfortunately, the lack of character depth sinks the movie.  All the characters feel like thin cut-outs rather than living breathing men.  It doesn't help that the audio overdubs are poorly done and just scream low-budget production.  Be warned this war drama doesn't offer much for anyone outside of Kubrick devotees.  All in all, ""Fear And Desire"" shows promise from a visual standpoint, but is lacking in every other department.

  For blu-ray fans, this release is pretty much bare-bones with the exception of an early Kubrick documentary short called ""The Seafarers"" (1953).  The audio and video are of good quality on this disc from KINO Classics.  That said, this blu-ray is really for the most devoted Kubrick fans.",1359331200,13,1113,5.150837988826815
5092898,5,B007K8ILUQ,Got it for my husband and he really liked it.  Order arrived in a very timely fashion. I would recommend your service.,1357603200,,118,4.363636363636363
5092899,4,B007K8ILUQ,"Stanley Kubrick, one of America's legendary filmmakers responsible for films such as ""Paths of Glory"" (1957), ""Spartacus"" (1960), ""Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb"" (1964), ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1968), ""A Clockwork Orange"" (1971), ""The Shining"" (1980), ""Full Metal Jacket"" (1987), to name a few.

But all filmmakers have their beginnings and for Stanley Kubrick, his first feature film would be the 1953 film ""Fear and Desire"".

Having created two documentaries (""Day of the Fight"", ""Flying Padre: An RKO-Pathe Screenliner"") in 1951 and employed at ""LOOK"" Magazine, Kubrick quite his job to create his first feature film.

Using funds that were raised by his family and friends, Kubrick and a classmate from his old high school, Howard Sackler, would go on to create ""Fear and Desire"".

While not a box office hit, the film captured the attention of film critics, who took notice of Kubrick's talent.

But among the Kubrick films available, ""Fear and Desire"" has only been screened at very few places since it's release.  One of those screenings were at the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. back in 1993.  The film also has not been released commercially and even was downplayed by Kubrick, when he was alive, calling the film a ""bumbling amateur film exercise"".

But in 2010, Turner Classic Movies aired a restored print courtesy of the George Eastman House and now, Kino Lorber will be releasing the film on Blu-ray and DVD in October 2012.  The version of ""Fear and Desire"" presented was mastered in HD from archival 35mm elements newly restored by the Library of Congress.

The Blu-ray and DVD release will also include ""The Seafarers, a short film created in 1953, a film which Kubrick took on in behalf of the Seafarers International Union in order to raise money for his next film ""Killer's Kiss"" (1954).

""Fear and Desire"" revolves around four soldiers who have crash landed in enemy territory.

Lt. Corby (portrayed by Kenneth Harp), Sgt. Mac (portrayed by Frank Silvera), Pvt. Fletcher (portrayed by Stephen Coit)  and Pvt. Sidney (portrayed by Paul Mazursky) are six miles away from where they should be and know they must cross a river in order to survive.

So, the four led by Lt. Corby, must evade enemy forces and create a raft and during nighttime, try to escape.

But while building the raft, they are afraid they may have been spotted by a plane flying above them, so the four leave the raft and try to see what is out there in the surrounding area.

The group spots a cabin where two enemy soldiers are eating.  Seeing their weapons and food, the four knows they must take the soldiers out and so, they devise a plan and are able to kill the two soldiers including one enemy soldier returning to the cabin.

But Pvt. Sidney begins to crack after he sees the dead mean staring at him.

As the four begin to work on their raft and see what is ahead of them near the river, a woman is seen catching fish with other women in the river.  While going home, she hears a noise (made by the soldiers hiding behind a bush).  The soldiers take her, bind her and try to interrogate her, but she does not speak any English.  So, the three continue their reconnaissance and leave the unstable Pvt. Sidney to watch over her.

But with Pvt. Sidney's mind becoming more unstable, can the soldiers trust him to watch the woman?

VIDEO:

""Fear and Desire"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:33:1, black and white) and features the rare George Eastman House print that is mastered in HD from archival 35 mm elements newly restored by the Library of Congress.  For the most part, picture quality for this film is very good considering its age.  I detected no film warping, excessive blurring or a lot of scratches.  There are nicks and dust that can be seen but by no means, does it prevent you from enjoying the film.  Whites and grays were well-contrast, black levels were inky and dark.  Overall, picture quality of ""Fear and Desire"" on Blu-ray is not pristine but the film looks great!

As for ""The Seafarers"", the film is presented in color but definitely looks its age.  While in HD, it does have that feeling of early '50s documentary shorts.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Fear and Desire"" is presented in monaural LPCM 2.0.  I detected no major hissing or pops during my viewing of ""Fear and Desire"".  Audio was clear and dialogue can be heard clearly with no problems whatsoever.  It's important to remember that this low-budget film was shot without sound and dialogue and effects were added during post production.

There are no subtitles included on this Blu-ray release.

SPECIAL FEATURES

""Fear and Desire"" comes with Kubrick's 1953 short ""The Seafarers"" which was preserved by the Museum of Modern Art.  The Seafarers is a industrial documentary promoting the Seafarers International Union.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Fear and Desire"", the first film by Stanley Kubrick that he never wanted people to see.

Who can blame Kubrick?  Having a remarkable list of films in his oeuvre, his first film was seen by him as amateurish and low-budget.  And as a filmmaker, one can easily criticize their earliest work and would rather have people remember the popular films that he's known for, not his first film that he created at 24.

But for cinema fans, ""Fear and Desire"" is fascinating American cinema for the fact that it shows that Stanley Kubrick was a filmmaker and writer that was ahead of his time.

""Fear and Desire"" is cleverly written to poke at America's continuing involvement in war.  And while ""Fear and Desire"" is not about the United States but people of an unknown country, Kubrick tries to relate one's feeling towards war, the futility of the actions of government and like its title, our soldiers that are sent to fight in a war instead of live for their families, are in fear of their lives being taken and their desire to survive another day.

For Kubrick's first film, the use of cinematography and clever editing worked to the film's efficacy.  From the facial expressions and the eyes of the soldiers, the sight of a dead person as he grasps the food to show signs of life until no movement can be seen.  Also, closeups showcasing the sight of death or insanity for a character to wide angle shots showcasing the river and the wilderness.  Kubrick's cinematography was amazing to see at his young age and once again, showing how he was ahead of his time.

Also, intriguing was the use of two characters playing the enemy.  Actors Kenneth Harp who plays Lt. Corby also plays the enemy general and Stephen Coit plays Pvt. Fletcher and the enemy captain.

Kubrick utilizes each character effectively.  From the young woman (portrayed by Virginia Leith) with fear on her face as the unstable Pvt. Sidney starts to go insane and rubs his face all over her.  While a seen between Kenneth Harp's two characters who encounter each other is quite a memorable sight.

For the most part, Stanely Kubrick was able to craft an intelligent film that pokes on society during that era on war.  Something he focuses a lot decades later in his film ""Full Metal Jacket"".

As for the Blu-ray release of ""Fear and Desire"", the fact that many people were exposed to bootlegs, because the film was never released should be happy that the 35 mm elements was restored and that Kubrick fans finally get their wish for an official video release.  Not only is the film restored but the film looks great on Blu-ray!

As for the inclusion of ""The Seafarers"", it's more of an industrial documentary promoting the Seafarers International Union but for Kubrick fans, the short gives people a chance to see how a young Kubrick was able to pay the bill sand eventually finance his next film, and that was taking on these type of jobs to earn money.

So, you get the 1953 film and his short made that same year in this one Blu-ray release!  Just to get this rare gem, restored and presented on Blu-ray is fantastic!

Overall, while Stanley Kubrick has many films in his oeuvre that will be forever known and loved by cinema fans, ""Fear and Desire"" is the legendary filmmaker's first feature film that provides an insightful look at a young Kubrick at work and how his work was ahead for its time.  Highly recommended!",1354320000,22,8248,4.7296918767507

8518959,3,B007K8ILUQ,"Stanley Kubrick himself disavowed this film, calling it ""amateurish rubbish.""  After years of wondering about it ... I have to pretty much agree.  As a fan of early Kubrick especially, I was hoping for some glimpses of the genius of THE KILLING or PATHS OF GLORY ... but FEAR AND DESIRE really comes across as a pretentious student film.  If the name Stanley Kubrick was taken off it, and people nowadays watched it for what it is, it would very likely be roundly panned.

It was definitely ambitious, however, and everyone has to start somewhere, and I give Kubrick full credit for this first attempt.  It is definitely of interest for that reason ... but it is just not very satisfying.  The dialogue and characters are not believable, and with a few exceptions, the acting is weak overall.  Virginia Leith is very good in her debut.  Paul Mazursky seems to have come straight from an early-50's ""method acting"" class, however, he is so self-indulgent, self-conscious and over-the-top.

The composer, Gerald Fried -- whose first feature this also was -- told me that Kubrick tried to buy up all prints of this film to destroy them.  And I have to say, the best thing about this film is Fried's music.  Mr. Fried told me that Walter Winchell even said the same at the time of its release!  Now THERE was a film debut to note.",1435017600,3,1326,4.619658119658119
8518960,4,B007K8ILUQ,"Okay, so, the movie is pretty bad, for the most part. It has glimpses of Kubrickian genius, but generally feels like an episode of the outer limits. The restoration is excellent quality, and the real gem is the short documentary included, 'the seafarers'. Even though it's just a promotion for the seafarers union, it's delicately directed with kubrick precision. This bluray is perfect for collectors such as myself, but I wouldn't recommend it to people just to watch.",1432425600,3,470,5.038461538461538
8518961,3,B007K8ILUQ,"In 1952, legendary film director Stanley Kubrick was getting ready to make his first feature film based on a screenplay written by a
poet friend, Howard O Sackler, (at Kubrick's suggestion) who attended the same school he did, Taft High School in NYC. It was first
called ""The Trap"", then ""The Shape of Fear"", and finally ""Fear and Desire"". Of the future film, Stanley said, ""Its structure: allegorical.
Its conception: poetic. A drama of ""man"" lost in a hostile world, deprived of material and spiritual foundations, seeking his way to an
understanding of himself & of life around him. He is further imperiled on his Odyssey by an unseen but deadly enemy that surrounds
him; but an enemy who, upon scrutiny, seems to be almost shaped from the same mold....... It will, probably,  mean many things to
different people, and it ought to."" Even at this young age of 24, Kubrick had well connected and talented friendships. Sackler would
go on to win the Pulitzer Prize for his landmark 1969 play ""The Great White Hope"" and he also wrote an early draft of ""Jaws"" (1975).
Stanley Kubrick is my favorite director and has been since I first saw his amazing, mind-blowing masterpiece 2001: A Space Odyssey
on a huge screen (and ice cold theater) in 1969 when I was 13. I had heard and read about his first feature film ""Fear and Desire"" for
years, but had never seen it until this blu-ray was recently released. On a $53,000 budget that he raked & scraped together to make
the picture, it's not that bad. Of course it doesn't have the flawless polish and performances of his landmark work to come, but for a
1953 debut effort with limited resources, a viewer has to take this into account. Shot with a rented 35mm Mitchell film camera (with
four lenses), he had no previous experience with it. Kubrick recalled, ""I went to the Camera Equipment Company at 1600 Broadway,
and the owner, Bert Zucker, spent a Saturday morning showing me how to load and operate it. So that was the extent of my formal
training in movie camera techniques."" In a striking hint of Kubrick's future methods, a NEW YORK TIMES journalist (Thomas M Pryor)
who interviewed Stanley before filming started wrote, ""The one requirement is that the cameraman must agree in advance to follow
the blueprint laid out by Stanley, who will direct and produce the film."" But on ""Fear and Desire"", Kubrick would do all of the camera
shooting, himself, even using a baby carriage to move the camera for certain shots as there was no dolly track available. In his 1999
autobiography, ""Show Me the Magic"", actor Paul Mazursky (who played Sidney in the film) wrote of Stanley, ""Conditions were never
easy. No matter what the problem, Kubrick always seemed to have an answer. To me, there was never a question that Stanley was
already a master of his universe.""  The video quality on this new blu-ray of the restored ""Fear and Desire"" is simply outstanding with
remarkable black and white clarity. I've read that Kubrick tried to obtain and destroy all copies of ""Fear and Desire"", as he was not
exactly proud of it: ""The ideas we wanted to put across were good, but we didn't have the experience to embody them dramatically.
It was little more than a thirty-five millimeter version of what a class of film students would do in sixteen millimeter."" Kubrick offered
to HORIZON magazine (in 1960) that it was, ""a lousy feature, very self-conscious, easily discernible as an intellectual effort, but very
roughly, and poorly, and ineffectively made."" Thankfully, some copies did survive giving us witness to the early work of a true genius
just getting started. ""Fear and Desire"" is probably the only movie one will see Stanley's first wife, Toba, who appeared in the scenes
where the three women are wading in the water. I recognized her from several books with photo's about Kubrick & his films that I've
collected. (She's not the one who is later kidnapped & held hostage). The blu-ray also contains another early long-lost Kubrick effort
called ""The Seafarers"", a short subject documentary that he made before this first film . Great to have it now available, as well. At a
running time of one hour, ""Fear and Desire"" gives us a quick glance at the seeds of how a master film-maker thinks. His next picture,
""Killer's Kiss"", would gradually reveal even more of what was to come. Kudos to all those involved in the restoration and availability of
""Fear and Desire"" on this glorious-looking blu ray.

P.S.  Two tracks from composer Gerald Fried's score for ""Fear and Desire"" (""A Meditation on War"" and ""Madness"")
totaling more than nine minutes can be found on a 1999 Silva Screen cd called ""Strangelove: Music From the Films
of Stanley Kubrick"". Recommended listening from this rarely heard music that was re-recorded by the City of Prague
Philharmonic Orchestra.",1431043200,,4810,4.805555555555555

8518963,3,B007K8ILUQ,"""Fear and Desire"" (1953) is Stanley Kubrick's first feature film made on a budget of $53,000. It's the story of a group of American soldiers who are behind enemy lines and trying to make it back to their side. This relatively short film (60 min.) shows aspects of Kubrick's future interests in cinematography and story telling. It's not as refined as his later works, but it shows Kubrick's grasp of the language of film and his talent for conveying something beyond the norm. This black and white film is interesting given that at times it seems to be a blend of early silent film's stylistic qualities contrasted with more contemporary naturalistic film making.

The picture quality is excellent with good contrast, though as with the Kino aesthetic the images have not been totally cleaned of the specks of dust on the film. This set also includes an early documentary (Seafarers, 28 min.) which Kubrick filmed in the same year as he made ""Fear and Desire"".",1424995200,,960,4.818181818181818
