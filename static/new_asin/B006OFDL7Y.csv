8501906,5,B006OFDL7Y,"Not well known film noir.  Von Stroheim was in Sunset Blvd.  Power, mistrust, fear, leading to madness.",1518652800,,103,5.0
8501907,4,B006OFDL7Y,"Posterity has not been kind to this little flick, but I quite enjoyed it.  Neat little horror/noir B, with von Stroheim and Van Sloan, not to mention the guillotine and the cat, giving it a little Gothic air at times.  Not sure what the mask in the title alludes to, but nevertheless, a fun flick if you like 40s horror or noir.",1477526400,,328,4.274193548387097
