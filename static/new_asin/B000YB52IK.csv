8231718,4,B000YB52IK,I watched this movie in my foreign film class and loved it. The only downer is that it needs a all region DVD player. I ended up watching it on my laptop. Great movie though! So worth it if you loved it the first time to watch again.,1441411200,,233,3.875
8231719,5,B000YB52IK,"This is the must see movie if you long for love and miss the value of families and friends.

Almost like animations, violent and tragic, but the message is very cleer through the nephew's tracing back of her life.

This is the story of wounded hearts we carry through the life of Matsuko, that tells us to look around and think of the everyday life and the simple meaning of giving Love.

very tastefully done, too. Bravo to the director! a great story!",1203033600,,453,4.433734939759036
8231720,3,B000YB52IK,"Nakatani Miki is captivating in this delicious, but occasionally disturbing confection told in reverse from the director of Kamikaze Girls. The camera loves every expression on Nakatani's gorgeous face, and rightly so: look in her eyes long enough and you'll feel all gooey inside. If you can bear to watch this beautiful creature retain her optimism despite a string of violent, abusive lovers and a series of cruel deals from fate, this movie rewards in bucket loads. More colour than the Wizard of Oz. More songs than Fidler on the Roof. More outlandish costumes and hairstyles than Elizabeth. More family angst than Happiness.",1202601600,,630,5.12621359223301
