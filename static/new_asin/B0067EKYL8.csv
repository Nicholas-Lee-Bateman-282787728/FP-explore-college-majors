4962990,3,B0067EKYL8,"***This review may contain spoilers***

  The trailers advertising ""Parental Guidance"" (hereafter PG) were not only unpromising, but borderline appalling.  It emphasized the tired, painful slapstick and saccharine sentiment of so many other formulaic family comedies, that I was determined to avoid it.  But, visiting my mother and deciding to take in a movie before lunch at Bugaboo Creek Steakhouse, we decided upon PG because it was the only movie that had subject matter my Mom (not particularly keen on hobbits, 40-somethings, or even Lincoln) was interested in.  After seeing it, we were pleasantly (if surprisingly) entertained, despite the dilapidated old ""Clash of the Generations"" plot.  Our amusement was largely due to those reliably schticky comedy workhorses Billy Crystal and Bette Midler.

  Crystal and Midler play fairly (but not completely) old-fashioned Artie and Diane Decker, parents to Type-A, harried upper-class daughter Alice Decker Simmons (Marisa Tomei).  Alice is married to Phil Simmons (Tom Everett Scott) a basically easygoing engineer who, like Rick Moranis's Wayne Szalinski in the ""Honey, I.."" movies has converted their home into a technological, computerized, self-sustaining ""house of tomorrow"". Their children are Harper (Bailee Madison), who is as neurotically driven as her mother, Turner (Joshua Rush) her more levelheaded, technologically savvy brother who has a stuttering problem, and certainly not least, the mischievous, irreverent, red-haired Barker (Kyle Harrison Breitkopf) whose best friend is an invisible kangaroo named Carl (not Harvey).

  Unlike the paternal grandparents, Artie and Diane have not seen their grandchildren in months, if not years.  They are ""the other grandparents"".  But they get a chance to bond with the tykes when Alice and Phil leave for a week for a scientific convention and, somewhat reluctantly, call on the ""out-of-it"" folks to baby-sit. As they say, hilarity (amazingly) ensues.

  Artie and Diane, although sharp and game, have their work cut out for them.  Besides the aformentioned baggage (and yuppified names!) each grandchild carries, and the mechanized Jetson-like home, Artie and Diane have to contend with the permissive parenting their charges are used to and their high-maintenance demands (e.g., each kid gets his own meal at suppertime, and Barker doesn't like his food touching other food).  Furthermore, Artie is despondent over his firing from his minor league baseball announcer job, and he fears telling Alice.  All sorts of slapstick hijicks, misadventures, and misunderstandings ensue.  Examples, Artie has to bribe the bratty Barker to do anything, Artie's advice to Turner to stand up to the bullies making fun of his speech impediment gets the kid a shiner - from the bully's sister, the kids get an amped-up ""sugar high"" from some forbidden birthday cake, Artie protests at a little league baseball game that has no strikes, timeouts, or scoring and gets a bat in the crotch for his troubles, Barker gets indelible day-glo paint on Artie's face just before Harper's violin recital, and of course Artie sneaks off with Barker to an X-Games announcer's interview where Barker's escape and urination ruins an X-games skateboard stunt (and is broadcast nationally) as well as Artie's job prospects. Diane has a confrontation with Harper's demanding, martinet East European violin instructor, calling her ""comrade"".  The comedy of errors keeps on coming.

  In the hands of inexperienced actors, PG would be a groan-fest.  But in Crystal's and Midler's capable, vaudevillian, borscht-belt hands, they are surprisingly funny.  Crystal's cynical comments and one-liners wryly commenting on the insanity of their grandkids' lives, even more than the predictable slapstick, keep the laughs coming, because we agree with their disapproval of the grandkids' overwrought, permissive, but also perfectionist lifestyle.  Even so, they love their grandkids and incrementally not only get to know them better, but also to overcome their handicaps and neuroses.  At first shocked at Artie's and Diane's interference, Alice gradually gets reconciled to their ways of doing things, and to them as general.  In unrealistic but satisfying sitcom fashion, everyone's issues get resolved and everybody's happy.

  Yes, PG is unsophisticated and predictable and even a bit low-brow.  But Crystal's and Midler's tried-and-true comic personae wring out the laughs and make you feel reasonably good.",1357171200,34,4480,5.556047197640118
4962991,3,B0067EKYL8,"Billy Crystal skillfully and funnily portrays Marisa Tomei's Dad, who finds himself without a job - after many years in (what appears to be) double-A baseball annoubncing. He takes it more or less as an opportunity to pursue his dream, as a San Francisco Giants announcer!

Bette Midler plays Marisa's Mom (and plays the occasionally exasperated feminist Wife - creating just a little confusion when she encourages the 12 year old daughter to dress to impress...16 year old boys). MT is a Mom, too, a ""working Mom"" of a bunch of severely screwed up ""modern"" kids, who have no traditional Parental Guidance other than playing their own parent, albeit a very strict parent, nutritionally and culturally and otherwise.

Grandparents Billy and Bette are also kind of in the ""minor leagues"". They can never be in the same class as Marisa's spouse's parents. But they are summoned to watch the inspired brats while their parents go off to a business vacation. They decide, this time around, to learn 'em the ""old fashioned way"".

Before long, the two sons and the one daughter are devouring anniversary cake, urinating in public, watching Gramps vomit on a little leaguer, going to wild parties.

The story doesn't matter, but I'll play no spoiler here. Plus, the one saving grace is Crystal's often hilarious bits and pieces, some I presume adlibs. He looks great and gets the best closeups of the movie, as nice as Marisa and Bette look. He and Marisa - very conservatively dressed, sorry dudes - pull off some dandy sight gags, too. Baseball themes work in well. I wonder who in the cast may have had a little pull, in that area? :)

Movie runs about 12 minutes too long (home editors, work your magic on the DVD!) and misses many opportunities to be a true perennial: Marginal Three stars.

4963023,1,B0067EKYL8,"The kids thought the trailer looked funny so we tried it for a family movie night. Well, whoever edited the trailer did an excellent job because the movie is just terrible. The talents of Billy Crystal, Bette Midler and Marisa Tomei go a long way toward making it watchable, but the cliched stereotypical jokes about modern parenting are very tired and the situations are so unrealistic that they are just not funny. For example, the kids in the movie have never tried sugary food before until Crystal gives them cake with... you'll never guess... disastrous results, then at the little league game, Crystal insists that his grandkid's bully should be struck out after 3 strikes... only to discover that this league HAS no outs, just like it has no losing teams. The humor seems intended for senior citizens, and perhaps it works for that audience. But it's not a funny movie for kids. My kids were so bored we had to stop the movie halfway through. I fear that they will never want to watch a Billy Crystal movie ever again.",1519257600,,1025,4.668508287292818

4963141,4,B0067EKYL8,"Now days, Billy Crystal doesn't appear in films as often as he used to, but for the right project and cast, he's always willing to remind us of why he's a household name. It doesn't matter if it's a raunchy comedy or a family film, his quirky and unique sense of humor always makes whatever he stars in that much more enjoyable and Parental Guidance is no different. On the surface, this is just another family comedy about Grandma and Grandpa getting in over their heads when they agree to babysit for the weekend. Add Crystal and Bette Midler to that and all of a sudden the film is taken to a whole other level. Everyone knows what to expect from both Crystal and Midler, but the real magic is their chemistry and how they play off each other, especially when you throw three unpredictable kids into the mix. Some of the scenes with the grandparents trying to use the modern technology or the kids taking advantage of the grandparents lack of respect for their parents strict instructions are truly laugh out loud funny. Yes, that's exactly what I said, it's a PG rated family movie, but it has more than a couple of laugh out loud moments. Parental Guidance is a film that the parents and grandparents will want to see for it's terrific cross-generational cast, but the kids will enjoy it too, for both it's old school and modern humor. It's the perfect rainy day weekend family feature film.",1474243200,,1396,4.565737051792829

In it, the grandparents are asked to come care for the grandkids after the parents are converting a business trip to a mini-vacation.
What is really good is the paring of Billy Crystal and Bette Midler as the grandparents. I was reminded of how funny Crystal can be.
Lot of gag bits but humorous to see how the family dynamic plays out. It reminds you that parenting is trial and error and there is no real way to mess up the childrens lives.",1417219200,,566,4.6138613861386135

Marisa Tomei plays a modern mother complete with all the angst that goes along with the job and Billy Crudup is her husband. The children are typical children with normal challenges.

Billy Crystal, Bette Midler and Marisa Tomei prove that laughter is relative in this comedy thats fun for the whole family. Old-school grandparents Artie [Billy Crystal] and Diane [Bette Midler] get more than they bargained for when they get stuck babysitting their daughters [Marisa Tomei] over-protected kids. But things go from hectic to hysterical when Artie realises the kids are running the house with their new-fangled technology. By playing by his own rules, which include sugary snacks, old-fashioned games and tough love, Artie manages to outsmart the kids and achieve the impossible  bringing the family closer together.

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: Parental Guidance, is a hilarious comedy with Billy Crystal, who is about a minor-league baseball announcer who, after hes canned for being an old shtick in the mud, he doesnt know how to tweet, develops a new relationship with his daughter and grandkids. Actually, he teaches everyone a lot of lessons and it is revenge of the old geezer and allowing him to have his curmudgeonly cake and eat it too. It could be worse, and would be without Bette Midler or Marisa Tomei. Ms. Bette Midler plays Diane Decker, the saint married to Billy Crystal as Artie Decker. The kooky Diane Decker is first seen, half-heartedly and fully clothed, working a strippers pole in her living room alongside her gal pals, which they seem to have brought their own.

Alice Simmons [Marisa Tomei] and her husband Phillip Simmons [Tom Everett Scott] have a weeklong vacation plans at Hilton Head that don't include their three children. With husband Phil's parents unavailable to baby sit for a week, Alice Simmons [Marisa Tomei] reluctantly asks her old-school mother Diane Decker [Bette Midler] and father Artie Decker [Billy Crystal] to do their Grand parenting honours.

They're very much aware that they're the last resort for their daughter with her 21st Century methods of childrearing, but they make the trip from Fresno to Atlanta to help out and do their best. And they find they're constantly challenged by the hyper-serious twelve-year old Harper Simmons [Bailee Madison], the stuttering eight-year old Turner Simmons [Joshua Rush], and the pre-school banshee Barker Simmons [Kyle Harrison Breitkopf]. All of their parenting methods seem to turn out disastrously with the three grandkids that are simply used to being dealt with a different skill set, but small, positive events make the grandparents start to believe that it's not a hopeless case with their grandchildren.

Screenplay Lisa Addario and Joe Syracuse don't miss an opportunity to work in possibilities for groin, puke, poop, and pee jokes [was there any doubt about it given the ages of the three kids], and none of them are especially effective. Better are the more charming and funnier moments when Diane Decker [Bette Midler] takes Harper Simmons [Bailee Madison] dress shopping making her feel like a million bucks or Artie Decker [Billy Crystal] tries to grasp the new rules for children's baseball. In order for the film's most ridiculous slapstick sequences to work, the seniors, especially Artie Decker, who makes one bone-headed decision after another, have to let common sense completely evaporate from their brains which sometimes tries the viewer's patience. As the grandparents continue to adjust to their approach to the children, the more complicated things become. Yet, the whole family learns new things about each other and themselves through both the bonding opportunities and disastrous turn of events they encounter along the way. Ironically, the only thing that brings Parental Guidance' together comes during the end credits, which are lined with photos of the cast and crew enjoying life with their families. Those moments depict love, humour and lots of beautiful human emotions.

Does it work? You bet it does. There are smiles and tears, love and affirmations, a few funny jokes and a lot of easy sentimentality. At one point Artie Decker and Diane Decker sing a song, delighting the children and suggesting that more tunes would have been a nice idea here. Any time Ms. Bette Midler is around, its smart to have her sing. She and Ms. Marisa Tomei are sympathetic, likable screen presences, but there isn't much for them to do except smile indulgently at, and be upstaged by, men and children alike. And while this may nominally be a family affair, don't be fooled for a second: this is Billy Crystals show from opening to close, and he is not especially good about sharing.

Blu-ray Video Quality  The film has been transferred in its original 1.85:1 theatrical aspect ratio and is presented in beautiful 1080p encoded image. Sharpness is generally excellent apart from a few weirdly soft shots at unexpected moments. Colour saturation levels are very much under control resulting in rich colour [the green lawns are quite striking] and believable flesh tones. Black levels are very strong.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio sound mix doesn't do much with its wide soundstage. Most of the films sound design is front-centric with only Marc Shaiman's music occasionally dipping into the rears, but Billy Crystal's [and everyone else's] wisecracks and verbal humour have been well recorded and have been placed in the centre channel.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary: Commentary with Andy Fickman and Billy Crystal: The director Andy Fickman and star-producer Billy Crystal share the microphone for the commentary. They carry on an entertaining conversation and manage to cover most of the high points in the film's production between cracks and jokes.

Special Feature: Deleted Scenes with Optional Commentary by Director Andy Fickman [2012] [1080p] [13:00] Fifteen scenes are offered individually or if you prefer in the ""play all,"" and there is optional commentary from director Andy Fickman that can be turned on.

Special Feature: Gag Reel [2012] [1080p] [13:00] This is a produced/edited collection of bloopers and outtakes that was mostly likely put together for viewing at the cast and crew wrap party. There's nothing particularly funny here, other than the fact that it is apparent that Bette Midler was the cast member who most often flubbed her lines.

Theatrical Trailer [2012] [1080p] [2:00] This is the Original Theatrical Trailer for the film Parental Guidance.'

Finally, Parental Guidance' mixes laughter and tears in a steady fashion, which keeps you amused throughout the film. Fans of the stars Billy Crustal and Bette Midler will give you lots of joy and especially seeing them together, as they work so well together and I hope they appear in another film together in another screwball comedy like this one and the PG rating assures it's safe for the whole family. Overall I had the most marvellous time watching this wise cracking film and so pleased I have added this to my Blu-ray Collection. One big bonus with us in the UK is that our Blu-ray Cover is a far superior design to the US Blu-ray cover design. Post Script: to all of you out there who is deciding what Region Blu-ray to buy, either in the UK or USA, well I ought to point out that the UK Amazon has got the Region information wrong, as it this Blu-ray is All Regions. Highly Recommended!

4964421,4,B0067EKYL8,"Parental Guidance will be hated by 'critics' and other proponents of snobbery. They will only revert back to tunnel vision romance of Billy Crystal's Harry and Sally fling. I'm sure that 'bad Tomatoes' will give it 10%. However, I couldn't stop watching this movie, and I have 0 kids nor have I attained grandpa age.
 Billy is great, bridging the gap and voicing the absurdities of life in the 24/7 wired lives we are thrust into. He is charming and snarky. Bette looks and plays great, of course, and I rekindled my crush on Marisa Tomei.
The plot is actually plausible. Set in Atlanta, it sends up a MARTA bathroom stall with hilarity. It's obviously corny, but it's got a song and dance from Crystal and Middler. 'Nuff said...
Oh yeah, Campbell Scott brown is in it too. It's the only decent movie he'd been in since 'That Thing You Do.' Gedde Wantanabe kills an imaginary kangaroo with his ""Auto-Moviiile...""",1394150400,,912,4.7

The movie doesn't show real life but an exaggerated version of real life to get audiences to laugh at the characters. One of the funniest parts is when the 5-year-old boy messes up the X-Games (with some surprise guests). However, the jokes around the same character's imaginary friend fall flat. In all, we found it a fun movie to watch.

4964514,2,B0067EKYL8,"This movie received two stars because it wasn't brazenly sexual, violent or full of expletives.  It really had the potential to make a comment on the generation gap and the 180 degree turn from how people were raised 35 years ago compared to present but the script was simply lousy.  In its attempts to be funny, it fell far short, I didn't even crack a smile, let alone laugh.

The acting seemed very contrived.  It definitely demonstrates the concept of overacting both Crystal and Midler (or perhaps the director) apparently believe that if they talked louder it would be funnier, unfortunately, it distracted and detracted from the movie, further being more an annoyance than humorous.

The premise is that Grandparents are needed to babysit one week for 3 grandchildren two of whom are unruly tyrants.  They are instructed that no discipline other than reasoning with the grandchild is allowed.  The children are pampered by coaches, teachers, with the exception of a Russian Musician, who takes her responsibility so seriously, she offers destructive criticism as motivation.  The Grandparents initially want to gain points with their daughter and grandchildren by going along with protocol, but finally loose control in the face of all this pandering to children and its absurdity.

It was a great idea but poorly written and the acting just wasn't realistic.  Billy Crystal looks ancient in this movie making it hard to believe that he is the grandfather and not the great-grandfather, and he is so full of botox, his features are somewhat distorted.

This movie just didn't do anything for me.  I saw it the first time two or three months ago, and I didn't realize until about 40 minutes into it that I had already seen it.  I tried to watch it all the way through but after 60+ minutes, I quit, I was just to bored to see it to the end a second time.

This definitely wasn't a good forum for some excellent actors.  If they hadn't been on the billing, this would have gone straight to video.",1388016000,,2001,4.793002915451895

The way ""Fartie"" was able to make a special connection and relate to his troubled grandson Turner and thus reconnect with his daughter Alice was so powerful in its message.

The directing is very good. The story flows.

As a grandparent, I was prepared for an assault that never developed.  I enjoyed the movie. The entire cast worked well together. But I must warn you, there are no car chases, no explosions and no guns.

4964683,2,B0067EKYL8,"Often in restaurants, eateries, while shopping, or while just observing behavior patterns wherever they occur one wonders whatever happened to parenting and discipline. Reasoning with public misbehaviors doesn't even lift an eyebrow for fear of damaging a child's freedom of expression. Place this depressing bit of generation gap on the screen and the result is this flimsy, trite, overacted, and wearisome PARENTAL GUIDANCE. The true test of patience is being able to resist turning it off.
Sixty-something grandparents Artie (Billy Crystal) and Diane (Bette Midler), pushed into the background because of their old-fashioned  structured ways of dealing with their grandchildren Harper (Bailee Madison), Turner (Joshua Rush), and Barker (Kyle Harrison Breitkopf) as raised in the permissive non-confrontational new parenting modes of daughter Alice (Marisa Tomei) and husband Phil (Tom Everett Scott). Asked to `baby sit' for a week, the two forms of parenting clash and the result is a display of some of the most trite overindulged childish behavior ever screened. There are occasional moments of giggles - such as when Artie bribes the kids with money to do his will - but for the most part this is just a loud silly movie for the masses. There are some good actors here but by and large their acting is sub-par and who can blame them. This is a film that falls into the `must miss' category even if you love Marisa Tomei, Bette Midler, and Billy Crystal. Grady Harp, September 13",1379289600,,1485,5.136363636363637

4964776,1,B0067EKYL8,"This movie really is a complete mess.  I really question all the positive reviews.  Fifteen minutes in I was thinking 'wow - this is off to a bad start'.  30 minutes in - still bad.  The trend continued through the entire movie.  The ONLY reason I didn't turn it off was because I was watching it with my kids.

The only thing this movie had going for it was the big name cast but this movie is living proof that it doesn't matter who is in a movie - if the writing is bad and their chemistry with each other is bad there is no hope.  The writing in this movie is really, really awful.  It 'should' be a family comedy but there are almost zero laughs in it.  Plenty of lines 'meant' to be jokes, but sadly nothing was funny.  Well I'll be honest, I think I giggled lightly 2-3 times overall at probably 300-400 'attempts' of the writers trying to be funny.  The story line is stolen from lots of other similar movies over the years but you spend most of the movie wondering where the heck it is going? (and not in a good way)

I feel bad for the youngest child with the red curly hair.  If there was ever a kid-actor thrown into something by his parents and got a role just for his 'look' it is this poor child.  He was like a deer in head lights and the character was not likeable at all.  There was really no decent character development with any of the kids despite them having pretty important roles.

Like another reviewer said, this was TV movie quality at best.  But I would feel ripped off even watching it for free because it's 2 hours I'll never get back.

So here is the BUT.... One of my two daughters actually liked it.  I'm not quite sure why.
Here's a bonus BUT.... The ending when the boy comes out of his shell was bizarre but it did stir a little something inside of me which caught me off guard.  But..the scenario of his older sister having a breakdown and dropping out of an audition from the stress and then him suddenly slipping into her time slot and shining was pretty off the wall.

It's not a classic or so good I'd watch it again. It's a little cheezy but with nice life lessons about understanding and respect across generations, and the impact technology has on family - on reducing quality family time.

I love Midler (but this was *not* up there with her other movies) and the entire cast, really, so I'm just wondering why high quality actors are taking up screenplays that really ought not to be made... or need to be rewritten.

4965282,4,B0067EKYL8,"Titled somehow different on-line, this is a perfect satire on the modern upbringing where natural activities and relations have been substituted with meticulously narrowed paid-attendances of activities occurred, kids being shifted in-out in luxury cars by/of parents well-hilled.

In such environment, none cares of other's death by own grandchild's fulfilment of a pee-need - and, whatever such a way of the modern upbringing positively-heralded from screen is, action has hardly convinced a viewer in a strength and own brain abilities of kids relaying on computing more than on human possibilities and team relations.

Only in America?",1372550400,2,639,5.645833333333333

As a mom of 3, my kids hardly see my parents since they are overseas. They finally had a chance to meet them last Oct for 2 weeks, too short. I want my kids to know how lucky they are to have their grandparents who love them and this movie shown them that. More importantly, this movie shown the distanced relationship between parents and grown up kid. I love my parents but now that I have my own family I have distanced myself from them due to everything, work, kids, friends...etc. This movie reminded me that family matters. One line in particularly, Billy Crystal said to Marisa Tomei, ""Don't let your daughter turns her back against you, because you will regret it, because I know it."" This broke my heart. I will never turn my back against my parents. And why do grandparents need to fight for the love from their grand children...",1372377600,,976,4.519774011299435

I enjoyed the peace in the class and really enjoyed the movie even though I saw it three times that day and watched it at home with my family that night.
The humor is light and there is a sentimentality with which everyone can identify.
It was great fun!",1372204800,,519,4.473684210526316

I really enjoy this type of comedy more than the slapstick stuff (""Dumb and Dumber""), but it didn't hit a high mark. Billy Crystal and Bett Midler are two of my favorites, and I enjoyed them together. I enjoyed watching this film and it was perfect for a night of not wanting to see anything serious and just enjoy a good laugh. It fits the bill!",1372118400,,466,4.065217391304348

It brings ""old school"" to ""modern day hip"" and shows, in the end, that the two can coexist; but not without a few fun crises in the course of action. I loved it, my kids and theirs did as well. If you want to have an  enjoyable movie experience and the old timers get to chuckle at what they so identify with--equally for the new generation--then this is a good pick for you.",1372118400,,515,4.202020202020202

Instead of entering a world where you believe the story being told as reality for 90 minutes, it was painfully obvious ""acting"".  Maybe it was bad direction?  I don't know, expected more from Chrystal and Midler.  I wish I could have overlooked Chrystal's ridiculous face lift, or filler or whatever he had done.  It's a shame how much he has jacked up his face.  The divine Miss M looks divine as she should, and of course the obligatory singing scene is included here.

The grandparents are worried they are not the favorite set of grandparents. The grandmother drags the grandfather along to babysit the children while they go on a business trip/mini vacation. The mother has issues with the way she was raised and raises her children differently. They live in this crazy sci-fi house that open doors for them and says hello to people. I guess that was to show the difference in the new generation vs the old grandparents. The bonus for this film was the Sixteen Candles Asian exchange student is in the film as a restaurant owner. He was funny in all his scenes. In the end, the family has a happy ending and comes together.

4965873,5,B0067EKYL8,This is by far the best comedy I have seen in a very long time. It is good clean humor that makes us think twice about what parenting has become.,1369699200,,145,3.8666666666666667
4965874,4,B0067EKYL8,"Very cute with typical Billy Crystal humor and Bette Midler flair.  It's not a ""must see"" but it WAS very enjoyable.

In this, Billy is a sports announcer and very good at it. He loves his job. He gets fired when the company decides to update everything and everyone.  While grieving over his lost job, him and his wife (Bette) get a call from their daughter asking them to watch their grandkids for a week.  Bette is over the moon for the opportunity to get to bond with the grandkids, and Billy is a bit more hesitant -- knowing he's just in for a lot more of his daughters disapproval.

His daughter (Marisa Tomei) has 3 children, the eldest is a girl who is a very talented violinist who expects herself to excel in everything - so she doesn't have much ""fun""... the 2nd child is a boy who stutters and is going to a lame therapist with a degree from Yale which seems to be pretty useless. The youngest child is a cute little redheaded boy with an imaginary kangaroo friend. -- They live in a super high-tech home, are doing all the new parenting things ""use your words"", they don't say ""no"", there are no outs in baseball and no scores so everyone is a winner, etc.  They eat stuff like tofu and never eat sugar, etc.  And Billy and Bette have a heck of a time trying to follow all the new rules of parenting and make quite a few ""mistakes"" - which, turn out to be just what this family needed after all.

Everybody learns a little and grows a little and they bond pretty tight and it's just cute and enjoyable in Billy Crystal style.

I think if you enjoyed ""City Slicker"" you will probably enjoy this - especially if you disagree with some of the ways kids are raised these days
because you'll enjoy Billy's struggles with them all the more.

4965888,4,B0067EKYL8,"Billy Crystal and Bette Midler play Artie and Diane Decker, a couple in their late 50's who have been married for 35 years and became parents to their only offspring, 38-year-old Alice (Marisa Tomei), when they were in their early 20's. Artie has made a career as a sports announcer for a minor-league baseball team, and Diane spent years as a ""weather girl."" They traveled around a lot during Alice's childhood and viewed themselves as fun, laid-back parents. They assumed at the time that Alice was having a fun time, too, but that perception was proven false when Alice went away to college and rarely had anything to do with them after that.

Alice has been married since her mid-20's to a brilliant engineer named Phil (Tom Everett Scott) who's about her age. Phil has recently moved his family into a prototype, computerized home he designed. It is so huge that, the first time Artie sees it, he refers to it as a ""McStadium"" (a play on the derisive term, ""McMansion,"" for a gigantic, tastelessly generic suburban home). Though Alice and Phil are in a loving marriage and are kind, attentive, non-demanding parents, it becomes apparent soon after we are introduced to them that they may have ""coddled"" their children far too much, because each has a distinctive, emotional problem.

Their oldest, 12-year-old Harper (Bailee Madison), is a highly talented violinist who's mapped out her whole life with the ultimate, adult goal in mind of playing in a world-renowned orchestra in Europe. Unfortunately, her driven behavior to reach this enormous goal is stealing all the joy from her childhood.

The middle child, 8-year-old Turner (Joshua Rush) is smart and quite mature for his age, but he stutters, which has led to him being socially awkward and bullied at school.

The youngest, 5-year-old Barker (Kyle Harrison Breitkopf), wears weird outfits and constantly follows the mischievous commands of his invisible best friend, a kangaroo named Carl.

Unlike Phil's parents, Artie and Diane have not seen their grandchildren very often because of the way Alice has withdrawn from them over the years. When Alice and Phil have a chance to take their first vacation in years to spend a week in a tropical paradise for a conference where Phil is slated to win a prestigious award, they need someone to watch their kids. Phil's parents are unavailable, and Phil urges Alice to allow her parents to take care of the kids. Alice squirms at the thought of entrusting her precious children, each with a demanding protocol for his/her care, to her flaky parents, but to please Phil she calls them. Artie wants to refuse Alice's request because he's depressed about being dumped from his job, but Diane ignores his protests and eagerly accepts for both of them. She insists to Artie that they have to be on their best behavior with Alice and the children because Diane no longer wants to be ""the other grandparents"" whom her grandchildren barely know.

I love Billy Crystal and Bette Midler, whom I personally consider comedy-flick royalty. My husband and I rented this movie because we couldn't resist seeing what they'd do to redeem the many groan-worthy cliches of slapstick, family movies, where the main source of ""laughs"" relies on the antics of out-of-control kids and pets who utterly trash their home one or more times during the course of the movie, and multiple other venues as well. I've never found that type of movie funny, and I was relieved to discover that: (a) there is no elephant-sized, destructive dog running rampant in this movie--there are no criminally untrained pets at all, and (b) there is only one scene in which the kids make a horrible mess, and they don't produce any property damage while doing it. Everything can be fixed with nothing more than a good scrub with soap and water.

Billy Crystal is unquestionably the star of this show, but Bette Midler is a close second. Each makes the most of every potentially humorous line, and their interactions with each other are consistent, comic gold as both are equally capable of performing as the funny guy or the straight man.

Marisa Tomei (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Cousin-Vinny/dp/B00517F03Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Cousin Vinny</a>) does a terrific job as a harried daughter, mother and wife, who just wants to do the best she can with all the conflicting demands on her from her family.

Tom Everett Scott (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/That-Thing-You-Do/dp/B000I9W0OM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">That Thing You Do!</a>) puts in a solid, appealing performance in the thankless role of the father of the family. I admired the fact that he doesn't resort to the clich&eacute; of clueless scientific genius. Instead he portrays his character as a sensitive, fully-involved father who's every woman's dream for a co-parent.

The three children are amazing actors, all of them, and they are each so utterly adorable, every woman in the audience will want to pinch their plump, rosy cheeks. Joshua Rush and Kyle Harrison Breitkopf were both nominated for the Young Artist Award as Best Supporting Young Actor Age Ten and Under in a Feature Film for this movie. In addition, all three of the children were nominated for the Young Artist Award for Best Performance in a Feature Film in a Young Ensemble Cast for this movie.

Finally, I want to commend the hilarious performance of Rhoda Griffis (I know her best in the part of bitchy Lenore Baker Ludwig on the TV show, Army Wives). In the role of Harper's harsh, Russian violin teacher, Dr. Schveer, her interactions with Bette Midler are priceless.

This is an ideal, G-rated, family film. There is something for everyone, young, middle aged and old. There are plenty of laughs, and several places made me cry, not from sadness but because the film is so moving.

Highly recommended.",1369526400,2,5898,5.093167701863354

4966009,3,B0067EKYL8,"PARENTAL GUIDANCE seems to have it all with a great cast that includes Billy Crystal, the lively Bette Midler and the gorgeous Marisa Tomei. Unfortunately, these three great talents are lost in a very cliche and predictable script. This story has been done over and over and there is nothing new to make PARENTAL GUIDANCE anything more than a cute little movie without much purpose.

Alice and Phil Simmons have a chance to attend a conference and finally have some alone time away from their three kids. Alice's parents Artie and Diane (Crystal and Midler), are hesitantly asked to fly into town to stay with the three young Simmons kids. It's not clear why Alice has distanced herself from her parents and why babysitting duty seems like a bad idea. Who would love feisty Bette Midler as a grandparent?

The Simmons household is a modern one. They live in a voice-activated home that caters to their every wishes. Inter personal communication is a thing of the past. It's sort of cute for all of 5 minutes and then it just becomes annoying. Phil and Alice are modern parents who live in a world where baseball games are always a draw. There can be no winners and no losers. A kid at bat stays at bat until he makes a hit. No one ever strikes out.
Artie and Diane are old school parents who rebel against this modern parenting.

The predictability is strong that we know what is going to happen when Artie and Diane are told the kids cannot have sugar and cannot watch scary movies. Anyone knows what will happen next along with Artie telling the middle son how to handle a bully. There just is no middle point here. Anyone could guess how this movie will play out so in the end the question is, ""what is the point?""

Midler does light up the screen and it seems like she is working hard to shine in a bland script. Cystral just seems tired throughout the film. Even Tomei seems like she would rather be somewhere else. PARENTAL GUIDANCE is pleasant but just so disappointingly predictable. It's not a bad film. It's just not a good film.",1369008000,3,2039,4.532608695652174

4966110,1,B0067EKYL8,"Comedy is a risky business and what one person finds funny may not even bring a smile to the next person.  Taking care of kids is a common theme of many comedies.  Movies like ""Uncle Buck"" pull it off while movies like ""Parental Guidance"" do not. There is a point in comedies where ridiculous situations with kids become so absurd that they are no longer funny they are just ridiculous. Add to that a Billy Crystal who's face looks like it's pulled tighter than Kenny Rogers' and is full of tired one- liners and you have ""Parental Guidance.""  I don't know how people could give this movie a high rating.  Perhaps it's so hard to find a PG movie the family can watch that is not animated that you're willing to accept anything thrown at you.  We should have followed our gut instinct as we thought the movie would be bad but the overall rating convinced us to give it a try.  Big Mistake!",1368403200,,888,4.384146341463414

4966231,4,B0067EKYL8,"I found Parental Guidance to be an entertaining movie. It's meant to be a fun film and not one to be taken too seriously. Better Midler and Billy Crystal play a long-married couple, Diane (Midler) and Artie (Crystal) who step in when they are called on to help care for their three grandchildren while their parents, Alice (Marisa Tomei) and Phil (Tom Everett Scott) go on a work/holiday trip. Alice is super anxious that her parents will make a mess of things, especially her father Artie because both her parents' parenting styles are way more different than her and Phil's avant garde version of parenting (not using ""No"", replacing it instead with strange phrases like ""Use your words"" etc.). The three children are a mixed lot - there's high-achieving, high-strung teenager Harper (Bailee Madison) who aspires to be a violinist with the Atlanta Youth Symphony, eight-year-old Turner (Joshua Rush) who has a stutter and is undergoing very expensive therapy to correct it, and the youngest, five-year-old Barker (Kyle Harrison Breitkopf) who has no sense of boundaries and has an imaginary friend, a kangaroo named Carl.

The fun begins when the grandparents arrive - Artie has just lost his job and is hoping to land some auditions whilst visiting with the grandkids, a decision that puts him and Barker in some awkward and funny situations. Diane forms an easy bond with Harper and under her gentle guidance, Harper blossoms into a more confident young woman and relaxes a little. Artie makes many missteps along the way but does bond with the two boys, and the grandparents and grandchildren end up having a whale of a time.

I wouldn't say the movie is funny throughout but there are some great laugh-out loud scenes and of course the requisite poignant ones that had me tearing up. Is it a cheesy movie? Yes, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. This is a fun movie that can be enjoyed by the entire family.",1367712000,2,1918,4.826747720364741

Billy Crystal & Bette Midler are the perfect couple and I hope to see more movies with them together in the future!  Their chemistry is right on!  It was good, clean, family fun and I would let any child over the age of say 12 watch this.  The ONLY questionable scene was *spoiler alert* in the beginning Bette and her friends are pole dancing exercising.  Lets just say there was nothing sexual or sexy about it at....all.  They were not good, which was what made it so funny!
Marissa Tomei is a doll as usual and the comparisons in parenting strategies was incredibly comical and enlightening to say the least.
Best part of all????? NO SWEARING, NUDITY OR VIOLENCE IN THE WHOLE MOVIE!  WOOHOO!  Finally Hollywood is paying attention!",1367280000,,817,4.704225352112676

This one really is worth owning if you want a feel good movie that has a good script and likeable chaaracters, no ugly demonized family members.  Of course it's about 'out of touch' grandparents, but it doesn't condemn them to the stupid pile, as most do.  They are appreciated and respected in the end, bringing a valued dimention to otherwise chaotic, materialistic and stressed family.  The relationships are refreshing, especially between the grandparents as a couple.

4966553,1,B0067EKYL8,"I am very disappointed after seeing this film. I have always enjoyed Bette Midler's work, and thought with her teamed up with Billy Crystal, the film would have to be funny. I was so wrong. The film is about three kids that are catered to 24/7, and all the adults in their world that spend their lives catering to them. The children are rude and disrespectful, and allowed to throw one tantrum after another because Artie, played by Crystal, DARED to try to impose any limits on their behavior, or to tell them NO. The youngest little cretin ruined a symphony performance, in only one example of his behavior, and still Artie was chastised for even implying that discipline would result. All the adults spent all their time apologizing to the children, when the children, specifically the youngest, were the ones that had done wrong, and should have been taught that they were doing wrong. Sadly, this kind of ""non parenting"" has become prevalent, where the children are in charge of the adults and the household, and it's doing no one any favors, least of all the children. I don't know how Crystal's character could have told Tomei's character that she was a ""good mother,"" with a straight face. Non parenting, and allowing horrible behavior, is being the worst kid of parent. Bribing the children with cake and money was pretty bad grandparenting as well, and I didn't like how Midler's character kept ragging on Crystal for trying to discipline the children, and ruining her chance to be the ""fun"" grandmother.

I did feel for the oldest child, who was being pushed into devoting her entire life to playing the violin. It is ironic, that the film was about ""parents making sure that children are heard"" yet no one heard that child.

I guess that some people thought the movie was funny, if they like seeing horrible monster children being as horrible as possible while their mother looks on lovingly, and seeing zero respect for any adults exhibited or expected, and seeing all the adults crawling around catering to and placating the children. I didn't think it was funny. I gave the film one star because I can't give it less.",1366761600,5,2132,4.743935309973046
4966554,1,B0067EKYL8,"I like Crystal and have seen Tomei shine in the past, so I thought ""How bad can it be?"" - Wow, you'll get an education in bad-movie making here and you will find out. Forced. Nothing moves smoothly. Everything is dis-jointed and stuck together with obvious plot-lines/story-lines and one gets a feeling the whole cast is at odds with something here.",1366761600,2,349,4.737704918032787
4966555,5,B0067EKYL8,Good movie for the whole family. Glad to know they can still make movies that are funny without swearing and sex... Great movie for whole family... The little boy is adorable......,1366761600,2,180,4.838709677419355

4966646,3,B0067EKYL8,"This was a good movie to watch with the family.  It was not filled with bad language and had a basically good moral premise.  Unfortunately, it also had a lot of convenient plot points and some things that were not very believable in the story.  But it was fun to watch, and we enjoyed it.  Just don't over-think this movie.",1366502400,,324,4.35
4966647,3,B0067EKYL8,I'd classify this DVD as more of a drama than a comedy.  The career and family drama definitely overshadowed the humor in this film.  I was disappointed by that.,1366502400,,161,4.517241379310345

4966682,4,B0067EKYL8,It's a good movie for all ages. Plenty of laughs. It's a story about how a daughter leaves the nest and forgets all the good times she had with her parents.

4966685,3,B0067EKYL8,"Like the review title says...It's good, not great, I've seen better, and I've seen worse.  The movie was a bit predictable.  Grandparents and kids are afraid of each other at beginning of movie and by the end, they're a family.  It's been done a lot, but there were good parts of the movie and is a family movie worth watching on a slow night.",1366329600,,343,4.328125

4966691,3,B0067EKYL8,"Billy Crystal/Bette Midler do a great job of playing stereotypical grandparents who are out of touch with their grandchildren's generation and the technology that goes with it. As is common, grandmother had her finger on the pulse of what's really important - their hearts. Grandfather comes around to that idea with some encouragement. It's an evening of entertainment. The viewer has to give the movie license to not be exactly like your family. Give it some breaks and enjoy the movie.",1366329600,,488,5.037037037037037

4966695,5,B0067EKYL8,Family friendly. No cursing or crude comments. Love the mom actress. All the actors were exceptional. It was hard to picture Billy Crystal married to Bett Midler but it worked. Funny movie. Whole family would love. Good plot. Problems these new generations face are accurate.,1366329600,,275,5.133333333333334

4966726,4,B0067EKYL8,I enjoyed it. It's a feel good movie. How our parents feel about how we raise our children and how we feel we were raised. The I never's come in play. A coming together of generations. We need more of these.,1366243200,,207,4.073170731707317

4966728,5,B0067EKYL8,"Billy Crystal follows the tradition of many great comedians that never used offensive language to make a great joke.  The movie is very cleaned, but not boring or idiotic.  As we all get older, we see our roles changing from loving relationships (when Harry meets Sally), to more mature (City Slickers), and now as grandparents.  It is a great family comedy.

Sweet performances by Bette Midler and Marisa Tomei, and Billy Crystal's comedic stints were stopped just short of becoming annoying.

Several times during the movie, the streaming video froze. I had to turn off/on my TV and disconnect/reconnect the ROKU-2 device to resume the movie. Although I eventually was able to get to the end of the movie, my experience was less than satisfactory; and for this, I was charged $6.51?

During this period at the urging of his wife, they travel to their daughter house where they find out that they are the other grand parents.

They rarely see their grandchildren, but are asked to come for a few days while Marisa and her husband attend an award ceremony.

The three children are all uptight in some fashion, one stutters, one has an imaginary friend and the oldest plays the violin non-stop. Their parents have good intentions and are bringing the children up their way. Bette and Billy arrive with different methods but they strive to be like their daughter asks.,well, of course, all goes awry, the children are a wonderful time after a few strange episodes. Parents arrive home early, feelings are hurt, but that is OK.

This is a feel good film with lots of gags. Grandparents will love this film, and I urge every single one of them to see ths film.

There was something sweet about the theme--the out of town grandparents who see their grandchildren infrequently--and want to be significant parts of their lives.

The young children stole the show--and perhaps, as in most Midler films, I will watch it again and again.  I do not want to be a ""spoiler""; however, I think that for me, the film reinforced the thought that regardless of age or situation, we all have much to learn from each other.

Storyline is predictable - grandparents reject technology and dislike the way their grandkids are being raised, parents go away for a few days, mishaps ensue...  very tired, very predictable.

By 15 minutes in I was ready for the movie to end.  By the end of this long, rambling, random mess of a movie I was so beyond ready for it to be over that words cannot express the relief I felt.

4967261,5,B0067EKYL8,"Looking for a light comedy, I rented Parental Guidance because of Bette Midler and Billy Crystal; two of my favorite entertainers.  This movie had no sex, no violence and I don't remember a single curse word (not that this is an issue for me... just a nice, unexpected change of pace).  A great family film, appropriate for any age.

The basic premise of Mom and Dad needing a break from the kids, and having to call the out of favor grand parents, kind of reminded me of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Uncle-Buck/dp/B001BR90SO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Uncle Buck</a>&nbsp;as Billy and Bette are a barely known commodity to the kids and definitely not the first choice of their parents to watch them.

The movie focuses on struggles and resolutions. For parents, grandparents and kids. Not always perfect, but real, and well payed by Billy and Bette with a great supporting cast.

Another common theme throughout the movie (and one of the best springboards for Billy Crystal's humor...) was the generation gap.  Struggles with a high-tech world that is normal for the kids, but like a foreign land to grandparents.

This movie isn't about a strong story line, it's about laughing your way through the absurdity that is sometimes our lives.  The ups and downs of parenting, the wisdom of grandparents, children struggling to grow and the love that binds families amid it all.

If you're looking for a family film with strong comedic laughs, sweet moments with some tears, and a triumphant ending.  You'll enjoy Parental Guidance.",1365292800,3,1574,5.285140562248996

I was born in the late eighties and caught the tail end of Bette Midler and Billy Crystal's established years in the spot light, so I was familiar with their careers and schtick growing up as a kid. The jokes were subtle but funny, and there were times I literally laughed out loud and that says something because I watched this on an iPad with headphones, and usually I'm dead silent. It's a kid movie so you have your pratfalls and kicked in the nuts jokes but it wasn't dumbed down and the the actors delivering their lines are obviously going to make the best out of that material. I didn't watch this movie to roll on the floor laughing, but hey, I feel it was worth the rental. It was sweet, had a good message, and ended on a high note with singing by Bette and Billy that is a good throwback. If your kid is very very young the adult  jokes will go over his/her head, which is good sometimes for a giggle or two. I'd say watch this with your 12 year old, have a good laugh, and be entertained.",1365292800,2,1043,4.215

4967291,2,B0067EKYL8,"OK, I have to start off saying my wife and my niece enjoyed this movie far more than I did.  I wanted to like this movie, really I did.  Most of cast are great actors, but the script wasted what could have been a truly funny movie.  I found the storyline to be predictable...so predictable in fact that I was able to say what was going to happen while I went to get a popcorn refill.  I think during the whole movie, I laughed maybe twice.  I wish the movie had been more like the ending, where Billy Crystal is obviously ad-libbing and being much funnier than the scripted parts.  Marisa Tomei should have been given a more meaty role.  Her comedy in ""My Cousin Vinnie"" showed her comedy chops.  And Bette Midler, who has a caustic, whip-like whit was totally reduced to stupid formulaic punchlines.  Really?

4967345,5,B0067EKYL8,"The 411 by Maria:

Now that I have cleared away the tears, I can talk about the movie even though my throat hurts. It wasn't a sad movie by any means just a very sweet, loving movie about family.

I am a huge fan the actors in this movie, I have loved Bette since The Divine Miss M (one of my favorite albums) and Billy Crystal, well there's Monsters Inc but more than that he's Billy Friggin Crystal. City Slickers is one of my favorite comedies.  After that we have Marisa Tomei (Different World and My Cousin Vinny) and little Bailee Madison who has turned into a beautiful young lady!

In Parental Guidance, Phil and Alice Simmons (Tom Everett and Marisa Tomei) are flying out because Tom's product is being recognized. They haven't been on vacation in years and talk of leaving one set of their parents in charge of the kids while they are away.  Artie and Diane (Alice's parents) agree to watch the kids much to Alice's surprise. Artie was recently laid off of his much loved sports announcing job. Their different parenting styles surface early on and Alice has a hard time leaving.  When she finally leaves the grandparents in charge much mayhem ensues and the comedy is mixed with magical moments between the grandparents and the children. It is a great movie for the entire family.

Parental Guidance is a wonderful look at two generations different parenting styles and the effects as such. As parents we think we are doing things so much better than our parents generation but when it comes down to it, are we? Our childhoods were filled with imagination and wonder yet our children are now used to helicopter parents who micromanage their every move. There were some moments in the movie that really had me thinking that our parents generation knew what they were doing. There is a moment when Billy Crystal's Artie goes to spank his grandson in front of many, many people and he talks about how the only thing kids don't hear now a days is the word ""NO"". Like the audience in the movie, I was nodding my head as well.

I especially loved the ending with Philip Phillips ""HOME"" playing during the credits that included family photos of the cast and crew. Great touch to a wonderful movie.",1365033600,2,2201,4.596938775510204

4967347,4,B0067EKYL8,"It was a fun movie to rent. It highlights the extremes of the old school way of parenting and the new school way of parenting. Thus, it provides a good deal of material for discussion for my wife and me. Caricatures always making things funny.  Billy Crystal is tooo hilarious. It isn't an incredible flick but an enjoyable one.",1365033600,,328,4.559322033898305
4967348,3,B0067EKYL8,I LIKED IT.  IT WAS WORTH THE MONEY AND I THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY.  I LOVE BILLY AND BETTE MIDLER,1365033600,,94,3.65
4967349,4,B0067EKYL8,"I watched this film with my husband, three children ages 6-9, and father, and it was perfect for a multi-generational evening together. Billy Crystal and Bette Midler play the parents of Marisa Tomei's character, and grandparents to her 3 kids. Her husband has won a big award and wants her to go away with him to accept it, but she's never left the kids, and is loathe to leave them with her parents. She eventually does, and both calamity and insight follow as the grandparents and kids move to a new level in their relationship. The humor mostly centers on the differences in generational parenting - Tomei's character tells her parents ""We don't say 'no' or 'don't', we say 'think of the consequences' or 'try it this way.'"" Midler does her best to honor her daughter's wishes, but Crystal just rolls his eyes and bribes the kids with cash to do what he wants.
There are a lot of funny moments, which I won't spoil here by describing, but there are also a few misses. For example, I didn't enjoy a skateboarding scene featuring Tony Hawk, where Crystal is supposedly auditioning for an announcer's job - it felt too contrived and pandering, like someone had stuck it in just for the youth 'cool' factor (which it didn't have.) But mostly it was a good, entertaining, ultimately warm-hearted family film, and all 6 of us watching got plenty of laughs out of it.",1365033600,,1364,4.640495867768595

This movie is on par (maybe slightly worse than on par) with Disney Channel's Zoog movies of yore. The script is terrible, as expected, but the acting, my God the acting! So forced. So fake. So awful. I wouldn't be surprised if this entire movie was shot in a weekend.

Although a comedy, it was a little low key; a comedy of observation comparing modern day parenting to traditional parenting, with not too much over-the-top humor (albiet there was some bathroom humor so prevalent in most comedy movies these days). Also, we haven't seen Billy Crystal, Bette Midler or even Marisa Tomei in anything for a while. Crystal and Midler have pretty good on-screen comic chemistry as grandparent characters to Tomei's  daughter character's 3 children (who were not too annoying). The comic situations developed for the film are not too straining or forced, with set-ups that can almost can happen in the real world. This reviewer found this film a pleasant surprise and found it a very relaxing film to watch with an intermittent amount of chuckling here and there to get through the film. Lastly, there was a hint of baseball and other sports situations spread throuout the film which always helps.

""Parental Guidance""
Reviewed by Brianna Hope Beaton
Video reviews available at kidsfirst dot org.

""Parental Guidance"" is extremely funny and enjoyable. Artie Decker (Billy Crystal) is let go from his baseball announcing job which he truly loves. His only daughter, Alice Simmons (Marisa Tomei) and her husband Phil Simmons (Tom Everett Scott) get a chance to go on a vacation and need someone to look after their three school-age kids. Artie and his wife Diane Decker (Bette Midler) agree to look after them for a week and will do anything to not be  the ""other grandparents."" But, their style of parenting clashes with Alice and her husband's parenting ways.

This film kept me laughing a lot and I must admit,  I shedded a few tears. My favorite character is Barker Simmons (Kyle Harrison Breitkopf). He has the cutest little face with red curly hair, and cracks me up with some of the things he does. The acting is really good and believable. I can actually see this plot happening in real life - that's how believable it is. I also like Harper Simmons (Bailee Madison) as she acts very well. She is so intense with her acting and so believable with her crying scenes.

I have two favorite scenes. One is when Harper has a mouthful of cake and then says to her mother, ""yogurt is not like ice cream, you lied."" The other is when Artie is at the little league baseball game with his daughter and causes trouble because there is no 3 strike game rule.

Andy Fickman directs ""Parental Guidance"" and Lisa Addario along with Joe Syracuse who wrote this very funny script. Other talents include Jennifer Crystal Foley, Rhonda Griffis and the very funny Gedde Watanabe.

A lesson in this film is to live your life, love yourself and laugh a lot. I recommend ""Parental Guidance"" for ages 6 and up. This is a great film for the family and your friends to see. It's a really good comedy that will keep you laughing. Get ready to laugh, cry and have a good time.

I give this film 5 out of 5 five stars.  I love the actors, the plot and comedy. Billy Crystal and Bette Midler are hilarious together with their style of parenting. Have some fun with your grandparents and see ""Parental Guidance."" I'm sure you will love it.

I love this movie. It has something that every age group can relate to. Artie (Billy Crystal) and Dianne (Bette Midler) are asked by their daughter Alice (Marisa Tomei) to watch her three kids for one week. Alice and her husband have won a trip for two to celebrate their success. However, Alice wants Artie and Dianne to use her method of parenting not the old school way that Artie and Dianne used to raise her. The children are Harper (Bailee Madison), Turner (Joshua Rush) and Barker (Kyle Breitkopf). They are not to have any sugar and live a very structured life. Each has their own issues. Artie and Dianne have to learn how to deal with their issues using the 21st century method.

Billy Crystal owns his character. I really see Billy Crystal as Artie. I did not see any acting with this character. Bette Midler also does a great job as Diane, funny and great voice. Artie and Dianne's lines seems like they are improvised and their comic timing is awesome. The child actors are great too. Harper's look of awkwardness when her crush asks her to his party is so true to life. Turner's speech impediment is so real; I thought he really has the impediment. Barker is a riot; he has that face that looks as if he's up to something.

The movie quality is very clear. The props for the smart house are awesome. One day we will all have a smart house and our parents will think it's creepy. The small home town setting looks just like it's in Fresno, California.

My favorite character is Turner. He is determined to overcome his speech impediment and defend himself with the bully. He does a great job of stuttering. The lesson in this movie is each generation has their own way of parenting. I rank this movie 5 out of 5 stars. I recommend this movie to ages 5 and up.",1364342400,,4592,4.588522588522588

4967698,5,B0067EKYL8,"""Parental Guidance"" is meant to be a comedy on the generational gap in parenting techniques but Billy Crystal completely steals the movie with his smooth and silky talking. Billy Crystal, acknowledging that he is the attraction of the senior crowd, embodies the fuddled grandpa trying to understand the softness of the suburban life but at the same time vying for his youth. As clichd as ""use your words"" has become of modern parenting, Billy Crystal is the one who uses his words expertly and elevates the movie from being another generic family movie.

In regards to the modern methods of parenting techniques, there are two opposites of parenting presented: first, the red haired Russian shrieking ""practice, practice, practice"" method; and second, the soft version of baseball where no-one given out method intended so that there is no ugly competition and just good clean fun. The first type is deemed to produce uptight children and the second type deemed to produce stuttering, diffident children or children with imaginary friends. So, it is up to the grandparents to come in to the picture and sort this out. The solution of course, you might have guessed, fun in its various forms; feel good but not a real answer or revelation.",1364083200,3,1238,4.980676328502415

After having her parents come stay for a few days, she soon learns that a healthy combination of the 2 styles may be for the best. I enjoyed this movie because it did not involve killings, cursing, and an over abundance of adult scenes. Rarely do we get the opportunity to see family movies with a positive message. Great movie for everyone!",1361750400,4,623,4.621621621621622
4967701,4,B0067EKYL8,"Parental Guidance is one of the few films, regardless of genre, that I have watched and felt genuinely happy while watching it. True, it wasn't anything particularly deep, complex, or emotional and it was also a bit predictable and cliched, but it was absolutely hilarious and I liked almost all of the characters! It was written by Lisa Addario and Joe Syracuse and directed by Andy Fickman, all of whom I've never heard of before. It stars Billy Crystal and Bette Midler as Artie and Diane Decker, two old school grandparents who are looking after their daughter's kids for the week, all of whom have issues they need to overcome. I could pretty much predict the entire film, with a few exceptions, but I still enjoyed it for the most part, there were a few jokes here and there that I wasn't particularly fond of but overall it was a good film. Bailee Madison as Harper plays a young violinist who tends to take things too seriously, Joshua Rush, as Turner, has stuttering issues to overcome, and the youngest kid Barker, played by Kyle Harrison Breitkopf, is somewhat annoying and one of the few characters I didn't like too much in the film, alongside the overbearing mother Alice, played by Marisa Tomei. Parental Guidance is a breath of fresh air when it comes to modern American comedy. Most comedies nowadays tend to be more like Project X, Superbad, or Knocked Up, but Parental Guidance is fun for the whole family and I respect that! It didn't have to be crude or offensive to get laughs, and that alone keeps it from anything less than a 3 star rating! It makes me almost not care about how predictable it is, although there were a few vulgar jokes, for the most part it was clean. Some critics actually derided this film for being inoffensive, I find that very hard to believe and am disgusted that America has sunk so low to have a criticism like that!

4967702,5,B0067EKYL8,"Artie (Billy Crystal) loves his job as a minor league baseball announcer. He dreams of announcing for the Giants. His dream is cut short when his job is terminated at the end of the season. Artie is old school. He is technically challenged. Meanwhile his daughter Alice (Marisa Tomei) is desperately for a sitter for week and calls her parents. Artie's wife Diane (Bette Midler) agrees.

Alice and her husband (Tom Everett Scott) are technically savvy. Their three children all have issues from having overprotective parents who use the new school of parenting. It isn't hard to figure out what happens.

This is a good family film. Kids will enjoy this more adults who will have felt they have seen this film watching it for the first time. Crystal once again infuses his love for the game of baseball into a film. The movie has funny one liners, some heartfelt scenes, and good fun.

Perhaps this isn't really a five star movie. There is no heavy thinking involved. No deep meanings or metaphors. It is simply a popcorn eating, relaxing, family film, something I haven't seen in a long time.

4967703,4,B0067EKYL8,"Being an avid fan of Billy Crystal, I eagerly awaited his return to the silver screen. I was not disappointed. Coupled with another veteran actress in Bette Midler (his doting wife), they made we 'older' parents appear archaic with their 'tough love' approach - (didn't all Baby Boomers experience this as children?). The story goes on to explain how they are 'the only' set of grandparents available, to care for their 3 grandchildren, 12, 8 and 5, much to their daughter's reluctance. Their daughter (played by Marissa Tomei) is all about 'new age' parenting and frowns heavily upon any strayings from her teachings. Therefore laying down her set of rules and opening the door to laughter.

Naturally, things are going to go wrong, as Billy and Bette strive to keep the peace and understand their charges. As not only do the 'Oldies' react to each situation in an uninitiated new age-old age way causing havoc, but are also victims to a completely automated house which initially sees them as intruders, much to their grandies delight. PARENTIAL GUIDANCE is a movie worth taking a look at and taking your grandkids to. It's a feel good movie. And without giving away the plot, Billy Crystal plays his usual affable self, who belts out an unexpected Acapella duet with Bette, along with some great co-stars of all ages, who end up loving him in spite of his mistakes.",1358121600,43,1368,4.821276595744681

8494306,5,B0067EKYL8,"There's something about this movie. Let's get this out of the way, it's not great, from a film perspective. The acting, while serviceable, is nothing to write home about. The dialogue isn't sharp or witty, and the movie doesn't do anything new I'm the family comedy genre. But there's just something incredibly charming about it. It definitely falls in the ""feel good"" type of movie. It's just very wholesome and enjoyable to watch, and I definitely recommend it!",1525478400,,463,4.948717948717949
