8195506,4,B0007GP7Q4,I had this movie on vhs so when I saw it on Amazon I purchased it. It's about a backwoods family where they come into money and the effect it has on the family. They go to a carnival and the two older kids grow up in a hurry with everything tempting them. Simone Griffeth plays the innocent 16 year old daughter who is taken advantage by a circus stunt rider and learns about life overnight. Mercedes McCambridge is excellent as the mother trying to keep her family together.,1362960000,2,475,4.348314606741573
8195507,3,B0007GP7Q4,This movie was a little disapointment. I was looking for more nudity. This movie should be not in the mature section If see more nudity in movies that are not in the mature section. Other then that it is a good movie to watch.,1206662400,8,226,4.159090909090909
