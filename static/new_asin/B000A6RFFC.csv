2367217,5,B000A6RFFC,"I am impressed with this DVD workout - not only did I lose 30 lbs, but I was able for the first time to walk on the beach with my shirt off without embarrasment!  The two workouts (Cardio and Sculpt) are over 30 mins in length, and Tony hams it up enough to keep you smirking but is motivating, too.  If you change your eating habits (less fries and bread and more fruit and veges) as well as work out with this DVD, you will lose weight and tone up your body.  I couldn't be happier, and I tell everyone who asks how I did it to get their own copy of Power 90.  Thanks Tony!

By the way, the previous reviewer took some of his comments about Lisa out of context.  He did tell her to stretch it out, but that's exactly what was happening - a stretch exercise!",1175990400,13,759,4.026666666666666
2367218,2,B000A6RFFC,"Well I was really impressed with the hours of infomercials I saw before actually getting the video.  The results were quite inspiring especially since the program was tried and true by some very average build guys trying to get 'ripped!'  The video itself was far from that.  Actually there were times when the leader was so out of breath he stopped working out and commented on ""Lisa's"" performance.  ""Oh come Lisa, I thought you were tougher than that!""  Or, ""That a girl Lisa, Oooh yeah, that's nice...stretch it wide!""  WHAT THE HECK!  Why do I even remember Lisa's name?  Because I actually gave the video so many tries before getting disgusted.  I rolled my eyes every time it got to that part!  I was even LESS impressed by the cheap setting of the work out location which looked like it took place in front of a blank wall at the Pool House of an apartment complex!  So disappointing!  No music at first.  When you select the music option to play, it's so obvious they are not doing the routine to that particular track because the fitness instructor and instructies ""APPEAR"" to be off beat.  Additionally as far as results, I did not loose inches but gained some muscle control.  The yoga inspired moves were quite challenging, but I tone better and much quicker when exercising to Pilates, Tae Bo, and my favorite, Gilad's Body in Motion Series.

Sorry to seem so drab.  I really wanted to support.  Hopefully you will investigate all workout tapes before purchasing and take advantage of their 30 day return policy unlike me!  I waited 1 day too late!",1172534400,8,1562,4.655677655677656
2367219,4,B000A6RFFC,"My husband and I purchase this after spending few weeks on the first power 90 dvd. The workout is almost the same as the first one,more repetition though and a little harder. I lost a few pounds with it (not so successful on my part) but my hubby lost about 40 lbs. He did follow the diet religiously though.  I can say that this is a good workout for people who are starting to get back into shape.",1154995200,8,399,4.115384615384615
2367220,4,B000A6RFFC,"This workout is very challenging. It consists of sequenced basic cardio moves such as jumping jacks, various leg kicks, punches, etc. There is even a round of Power Yoga at the beginning, following stretches. You really break a sweat with this one! I find myself having to slow down and I am a fairly advanced exerciser. However, Tony Horton, the instructor, is a little annoying and has a way of mildly teasing the individuals doing the video along with him. I also find that this workout is so repetitive and boring that I couldn't bring myself to stick with the 90 day program. Ninety days of doing the same moves with no fun involved? I think I will stick with The Firm, but this workout is great when you want a little change once in a wihle. I would recommend for those that don't care about variety. I danced for years, so this is simply too basic for me.",1139702400,13,862,4.427672955974843

2367261,5,B000A6RFFC,"I am going through Power 90, and this is essential in my opinion. If you are on the fence because you hear it is the same, I am saying you should get it for the following reasons. The workouts are the same, but the intensity is higher, the pace is faster, and Tony is more motivating to keep moving and work hard. The tone of this workout video is unlike the first one, where the tone was figure out the moves, press pause, take your time. There is a little of that in this but it is probably for liability.

This version is a lot more intense and will push you harder than 1-2.

The moves are the same as the first video with 3 sets for each round instead of 2. Kicking is the only group that is still only 2 sets, but the pace is a lot faster.

This video has the ab ripper 200 on it as well. It is 200 situps which is also the same, you do 20 for each different ab exercise instead of 10.",1332288000,4,891,3.911602209944751

I decided to try Power 90's phase 2 (Sweat Cardio 3-4) and was not disappointed.  It was made apparent to me that Tony's precursor to P90X is what gave that series its motivating edge.  P90 Sweat Cardio 3-4 gets your heart pumping, burns 100s of calories and leaves your workout clothes quite soaked with sweat.  Also, the workout time is only about 45 minutes and it fits great into my schedule.  I'd recommend this DVD to anyone who wants an effective workout.",1329523200,3,581,4.77

2367267,5,B000A6RFFC,"To provide you with some background, I am a 56 year old, deskhugging male who has been overweight for the last 15 years (40 pounds), and I am just recovering from a very serious blood clot in my left leg. My doctor ordered two things: 1) that I begin exercising regularly, and 2) that I begin losing weight.

I began working out with a group of men that gathered three days a week ... but the cost was $120 every six weeks.  After doing this series of exercises three times (that is 18 weeks), I began to realize that while the workout was great, that I was using financial resources that the family desperately needed.  So, I began looking at various exercise programs, including the P90 and P90X.

When it came down to it, the P90 was just what I needed.  For a man just getting back into exercising and needing to ""lean up"" and lose weight, this is not the crazy stuff of some of the other packages.  It's good for getting my body accustomed to the exercising --- and, yes, it is a great workout!

The workout nicely progresses from warming up, to getting the blood pressure up and keeping it up, and then a nice warm-down.  For those of us who are needing assistance without craziness, I would highly highly recommend this program.  My fat is becoming muscle and I am slowly losing weight. Of course, if I would follow their diet program (as I should) I would be losing a lot more weight --- but I am working on that!

At some time I hope to graduate to a harder program, but right now I am listening to my body --- and my body says that this is just what I need!",1292803200,,1567,4.263513513513513

Review

I love it. I like Tony Hortons personality and the way he motivates.  He makes me laugh while I am working out.  I mix this and the P90x up.  The P90x series was definately done with a bigger budget and Tony really motivates well.  My honest recommendation is if your already in shape do P90x, if your not in shape and have spent to much time on the couch then do P90 then p90x.  There is a reason why Tony is #1 in the industry right now, he is making people healthy and he loves doing it.  I have had over 5 different personal friends get great results from the programs and now its my turn.

Beachbody does offer marketing options for people to collect orders and make some side money on the programs.  I am glad I just found that out and have never seen it until I read about it on the net.  If one of my friends had approached me with it I would have told them to stuff it.  Plus.. my true friends would have just burned me a copy, not tried to make money off me rofl.  I think it weakens my opinion of them but I guess they do what works.

As far as the previous review about Tony commenting to Lisa well... all I can say is that reviewer is projecting some of thier own issues into the DVD.  Thats just odd.",1267574400,,1849,4.316860465116279
2367291,5,B000A6RFFC,"Everyone has a different level of fitness, but if you're just getting started, or ready to work up to the next level, Tony Horton is the way to go. I like that I feel energized and charged after his workouts, and not like I'm either going to die, or that I'm going to quit. It's a fun challenge.",1264896000,,295,4.103448275862069
2367292,3,B000A6RFFC,"oldie but a goodie... for the most part.  it is dated for sure, and compared to the P90X it looks someone's home video, but... it is not an easy workout and is a bit more than a beginner should take on.  overall it is a good addition.",1258848000,,234,3.9574468085106385
2367293,5,B000A6RFFC,This video was very hard for me at first but I am loving the workout and am able to do most of it now. I feel great after it and not too soar,1255305600,,141,3.303030303030303
2367294,5,B000A6RFFC,"I have been impressed with all of my Beach Body workout tapes.  They can be a little cheesy at times with Tony and his lack of joke making, but they give you a great workout with a great stretch.  The first time you just want to die half way through, I won't kid you that you don't.  But after a few times it is still challenging to work your body out, but your body deals better with the work it is doing and you start seeing results.  The best thing about the workout is that it isn't hard stuff to do.  I have a few aerobic videos that I can't keep up with or even figure out what I am suppose to be keeping up with. The Beachbody videos can be done by anyone and they are good about giving alternative ways incase you aren't as flexible as they are.  I do recommend starting off with 1-2 if you are just starting out!",1226275200,2,821,4.006134969325154
2367295,4,B000A6RFFC,"I have no problems with the DVD. It gets the job done. I especially like the way they split screen the same exercise with wts and bands. I find that the exercises are explained appropriately and I generally like the both discs.
Tony Horton though, gets on my last nerve. He never shuts up from the time the tape begins and his banal, stupid joking with the assistants are annoying. What is it with him and his need to say boom during each exercise?  I would not buy another tape bacause of his silliness. Gilad is a better choice for me.",1211414400,,537,4.316831683168317
2367296,5,B000A6RFFC,"Both the Sweat 1-2 and 3-4 programs that come w/ Power 90 are very straightforward no nonsense type routines.

The 3-4 program is exactly like 1-2 but it moves with a bit more intensity and does an extra round of each cardio circuit.

You start off with warm ups, then do Yoga, Standing Ab work, X-Work (which is footwork based around an X pattern (actually it's more like a plus sign) and then you move on to kickboxing type work.

The program is followed with an Ab ripper 200 program (the Sweat 1-2 is followed by Ab ripper 100) which is an effective short ab routine. I personally do the moves at half speed and contract my abs more intensely because I find that less reps this way is safer and more effective than doing the faster higher reps approach, but of course that's a personal preference.

As with all of Tony Horton's programs, they are straight forward and hard work. No magic bullets, just a simple format that works if you actually do the work.

The Power 90 programs are the earliest of Tony's programs w/ Beachbody and were definitely low budget endeavors compared to P90X which was done when they had more money to invest in production.

Still, Power 90 is very effective and quite challenging.

I do want to mention that during the X-work there are some high impact moves so be aware of that, BUT Tony does show modifications for that and encourages folks to work at their own pace.

If one commits to this (or really ANY exercise program) and you clean up your nutrition you'll get results. If you don't make any effort then you won't make any changes.

Tony, by the way, is a bit of a character so be prepared. As one person wrote in a review I read elsewhere ""Sometimes Tony's funny and cute and sometimes you want to smash him in the face with a brick!"".

I find him mostly funny, but some may find his personality to be less to their liking.

Still, even if you can't stand him but do the workouts anyway, you'll end up loving what YOU get out of it.

I do highly recommend this and Tony's other programs and even recently bought the Power 90 set for one of my brothers because I know how effective they are.",1195948800,7,2134,4.388324873096447
2367297,4,B000A6RFFC,"This dvd is no nonsense and straight to the point. Its a simple workout yet it gets your heart rate up. If you like the traing camp approach then you'll love this workout. Its murderous on your knees, so if you have weak knees then you might want to take it easy at first. The abs ripper section is my favorite part because it targets your entire stomach and lower back. I like to use this dvd before I hit the gym. Overall a very solid workout for the price.",1194048000,6,459,4.111111111111111

8074940,4,B000A6RFFC,"I loved P90x and 22 Minute Hard Corps, so when I got the chance to pick up an old Tony Horton classic- I was so excited to give it a try. I was only able to get this one DVD and not the whole program, but I figured it would be fun to stick into my routine every once in a while.

After doing a lot of his more recent DVDs it was so funny to see ""vintage Tony""- It was like going back in time. But, it also meant I kind of got to experience where some of his famous moves started out.

Time: The warm-up was about 4:30. The main workout was about 32 minutes, followed by a cooldown/stretch that lasts another 5:30. BUT THEN you have 7 minutes of Abs thrown in as a bonus. Total commitment: Just under 50 minutes.

Skill Level: If you do each workout as stated, an upper level beginner could do it no problem. There are ways to make each move harder. You could pick up a set of weights for most of them (I used 3# for some parts) or just do the moves faster. One funny thing is he actually moves slower than the music for almost the whole workout so if you just made a point to stay on beat with the music you're going to step it up a notch.

Equipment: No weights are needed, unless you want to add weight to make it harder. If you're ambitious, pick up a set of 3s or 5s. He also uses an ""X"" taped the the floor during one section, but you don't really need that- he uses it mainly for demonstration purposes.

Breaks: There is one 30 second break about 2/3 of the way through the workout.

Format:
As mentioned, you start with a warmup. If you have done ANY of Tony's other workouts, it will be very familiar. Then, you do about 4/5 minutes of yoga- just the basics like vinyasas, crescent, warrior 2, etc.

There is a progress bar on the right hand side so you can track your progress. ""Warm up"" and ""Yoga"" are both indicated by their names- the actual circuits are illustrated with bars that turn green, yellow, and red as you progress through them. There are also countdown timers for the section you are on, as well as the workout as a whole. Careful, it is a little misleading because though you see the Ab section listed, they don't count it in the main workout countdown. So just when you think you're done more time gets added and you switch to abs!

The 5 main circuits follow a similar format (3 moves, repeat 3x) with the exception of the kicking section (3 moves, repeat 2x). I guess the rationale was you have to do the kicks on each leg making it long enough to not have to do a third round :)

Circuits:
1- low impact- this is where I added 3# weights and sped up the pace, basic arms and legs cardio
2- higher impact (think: jumping jacks- not rockstar jumps)
3- ""X"" work- hops/jumps/fast feet using the ""x"" taped into your floor (or in my case the invisible x)
***30 second break***
4- Kicks
5- punch combos

Cooldown/Stretch

Abs: 200 reps- 10 moves with 20 reps per move. I'm feeling it in the abs a day later!!!

Overall, I don't think this workout will be in my usual rotation. It is a bit longer than a lot of the others in my collection and I don't feel like the extra time really gave me anything extra. I would recommend it for beginners/lower intermediate level people since it is a little sampling of everything (yoga, cardio, kickboxing, abs). I will also keep it on hand to use as a pregnancy workout since it is low impact (I'd just stop before the ab section).",1466985600,,3392,4.193548387096774
