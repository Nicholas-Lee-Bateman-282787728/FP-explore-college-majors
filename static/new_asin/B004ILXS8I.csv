8430803,5,B004ILXS8I,"This is the complete 3 volume dvd set of the Korean Drama King and I with a plot line centred on the Eunuchs and their role in the Palace politics and Korean history. The drama is well acted and directed but the story lines is sad and the ending tragic. However there is a lot to learn from it. If you are familiar with Korean historical drama you will know that court politics, plotting and scheme were the order of the day and it was no different here. The story is well told and well acted but it is sad and sorrowful. The dvd packaging is the best i have seen with gold edged boxes and ribbons housing the dvd. It is now very difficult to obtain but well worth it.",1475280000,,668,4.106870229007634
8430804,5,B004ILXS8I,"Volume one through Vol. three was just thrilling, great performance by the actors.  Actually, watching the many episodes of these three volumes has interest me so much that I am putting a great deal of study in to the history of Korean",1381017600,3,235,4.595238095238095
8430805,5,B004ILXS8I,What can I say except that I have become interested in Koren history and these series are a way to understand a certain period of time in Korean history.,1371427200,3,153,4.310344827586207
8430806,4,B004ILXS8I,"It is hard to write a review on this series simply because it was so terribly depressing. It is well acted; beautifully costumed; extremely well produced and perfect sub-titles. The story is the saddest of all the series I own. I only watch it about once a year. It is so depressing I feel suffocated by the plot at times. I kept hoping for a turn to the better for the characters, but it does not happen. Apparently this was not a good time in Korean history. Not a single character finds happiness. All end in tragedy. That said, it is worth watching as it is such a well acted series. I just can't put it on my favorites list. Be preparred for rather graphic things. I knew nothing of the life of eunochs and found that to be amazing. Watch for historical content, not for a great love story or happy events. It tells a different part of Korean history. Just how powerful eunochs were and how much they influenced the events that took place. The cast is truly wonderful. I gave it a high rating because of the cast and directing, etc. I also give credit to the courage to tell of a time that was not so great in history.",1354060800,12,1123,4.276995305164319
8430807,4,B004ILXS8I,This was interesting to watch. Eunuchs as the main characters in the story instead of adjuncts to those they serve. I didn't care for the end but all the self-sacrifice and controversy in the middle was interesting. Court politics and male female roles in society more drama. Not my favorite but it gave me insights into the culture.,1334707200,7,333,4.758620689655173
