7988814,5,B000093I82,"This is a different kind of hunting video. It is not as commercial as the majority of those on the market. Why do I say this? It is due to the fact that those on the video are there to hunt, not to sell products. It is also not a movie where everyone jumps around like a nut after each kill. It is more educational, informative, and well balanced than other hunting movies. It is a great movie to watch if you are into hunting. A little bit dated, but still a very good movie. I would suggest it to anyone.",1507766400,,506,4.01980198019802
7988815,4,B000093I82,Ken Wilson has produced a number of these films.  He has hunted all over the planet for big game trophies and his films are always very interesting and educational.  By educational I mean to say that the animals are described in detail along with trophy qualities and assortment of details to look for in an exceptional animal. Australia has no native deer.  These deer have been brought in from other nations yet they're thrived in Australia and Tasmania.  Ken explains all this is his friendly and like-able manner. What I like most about this DVD:  1) the exotic and foreign lands 2)the quantity and quality of these animals rarely viewed outside of zoos 3) the ethical hunts for these marvelous animals.  Watching hunting videos is not for everyone.  But this film is a refreshing break from the countless amateur videos featuring shooting of wild hogs and whitetail deer in a southern USA environment.,1245110400,,906,4.882352941176471
