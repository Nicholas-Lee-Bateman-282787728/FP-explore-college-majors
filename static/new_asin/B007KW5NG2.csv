5094059,3,B007KW5NG2,"Lawless is an entertaining but uneven adaptation of Matt Bondurant's novel The Wettest County in the World, which was inspired by the author's grandfather. Part gangster flick, part Southern gothic, and part Western, the story follows the three Bondurant brothers in Prohibition era Virginia. They are reputed for their survival skills and good moonshine. Local authorities don't care. The oldest two brothers don't think twice about beating aggressors with bare fists or brass knuckles. The youngest is eager but more of a lover than a fighter.

Occasionally, a gangster might stray into town to commit murder or a gang might try to rob the brothers. Otherwise, all goes smoothly until a lawman from Chicago swoops in and wants a cut. Denied this, he wages war against all bootleggers in the county, including the intrepid Bondurants.

The atmospheric beginning captures the hard boiled life of our heroes in all its browns, from beards and clothes to ramshackle buildings. The detailed depiction is both accurate and the archetype of a mountain town in the early twentieth century: expect strong accents and tobacco spit (and blatant WHITES ONLY and COLORED signs, in case you forgot people were racist then). The evocative soundtrack is gorgeous if occasionally heavy handed. Landscapes are equally memorable, from a smoky mountainside to a kudzu covered wonderland.

This film takes its time in introducing its enjoyable characters before it veers off course. The acting is excellent. A surprisingly funny Tom Hardy plays Forrest Bondurant, the occasionally tender hearted but tough as nails ringleader. Jason Clarke does well with less as the haunted, constantly drunk Howard Bondurant. Shia LaBeouf is effective as Jack, the baby. Ambitious and foolish, the endearing Jack tries to swagger, but he generally reacts to violence the way most of us would--with pure terror.

Jessica Chastain has little to do but look concerned and lovely like many women in Westerns, but Mia Wasikowska has a little more meat as the unattainable preacher's daughter who catches Jack's eye. She enjoys flirting with the love-struck, unsuitable Bondurant boy; her sly coquetry is highly believable. Dane DeHaan plays Jack's sweet, innovative friend, and their relationship is predictable but convincing in its innocence.

Gary Oldman has a small role as a notorious gangster, and Guy Pearce plays Special Agent Charlie Rakes. Pearce is amusing but not exactly subtle. For example, when introduced, he walks up to the first woman he sees and leers at her for several minutes. He openly laughs in the faces of these ""hicks,"" as he calls them.  (The audience gasped whenever he unexpectedly appeared and cheered when he sustained injuries.)

As disturbing as Rakes can be, his villainy is somewhat diminished since the protagonists are as brutal as he is. Rakes may abuse innocents while the Bondurants torture murderers, but it's difficult to get behind characters who mutilate people. The villain's crimes are portrayed as sadistic and traumatic, while the main characters' violence is often shown to be grim but funny and deserved.

The violence itself is extremely graphic but not always serious. The Bondurants are rumored to be ""indestructible,"" so don't be surprised if characters recover remarkably quickly from life-threatening wounds. The theme of immortality is successfully played for laughs, but it could have been a statement about the Bondurants' reckless youth and egomania.

An amalgamation of genres gives the film a unique feel, and a few surprises await viewers. But the story also contains numerous clichs that don't serve the plot. One fears for the safety of a good natured but physically disabled character, and several women are raped because... they are women? At least one of the sexual assaults is shown off screen but does nothing to forward the plot or the victim's arch. The act is hardly addressed, but then again, little of the violence here is.

The movie's tone is simultaneously too lighthearted and too dark. Grisly though it is, Lawless is still a fun and well-acted film. It's unfortunate that the movie doesn't reach its promised intensity, reducing what could have been a rousing legend into a diverting yarn.",1347062400,6,4232,5.219440353460972
5094060,5,B007KW5NG2,"Great performances, a fantastic script and vivid cinematography combine to create a powerful film about three backwoods brothers trying to survive in the world of violence and corruption caused by Prohibition.

The Bondurant brothers seem like decent, hard-working folk just out to pursue the American dream.  But their business happens to be bootlegging.  And so their success brings them up against powerful interests, from brutal gangsters like Floyd Banner (Gary Oldman) to corrupt and savage G-men like Special Deputy Charley Rakes (Guy Pearce).

But the Bondurants, led by strong stoic Forrest (whose brothers are in awe of his courage and seeming invincibility), decide they will not submit to those who would muscle in on their business.  Violence ensues, as the brothers refuse to be bullied, and respond to brutality with savage reprisals.

The film could have easily descended into a meaningless and gory testosterone-fest, like many other action films, but it is a tribute to the actors, script and direction, that you cannot help but care about the Bondurants and marvel at their bravery and courage in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds.

The story of the Picaresque hero, the outlaw underdog battling the more powerful but corrupt system, using ingenuity and ethos, is a classic theme in American film.  And here it is played to perfection.

The villains, led by Rakes and his henchmen, are especially odious.  Guy Pearce gives an intense performance as the evil and sadistic lawman from ""upper class"" Chicago.  Gary Oldman as the gangster Floyd Banner has only a minor role in the plot, but electrifies the screen with his raw and gritty performance.  In contrast to these caricatures of evil, the Bondurants are wonderfully sympathetic characters-  the romantic younger Jack (Shia Labeouf), learning what it means to become a man by building his courage and loyalty, and clumsily courting the preacher's daughter; the middle brother Forrest (Tom Hardy, in an Oscar-caliber performance), an intensely powerful but decent man, and the older Howard (Jason Clarke), battling his demons and trying not to feel the pain of the savage violence he has had to be a part of.

Watching Lawless, I was reminded of The Godfather, another film with fascinating characters where family loyalty, and a code of honor collide with a violent and corrupt world.  Like Godfather, Lawless is an unflinching look at morality--personal and societal--and the corruption of power, as well as an absorbing action thriller that will linger in your mind after the last scene is over.",1346889600,5,2578,5.193236714975845
5094061,4,B007KW5NG2,"The Bondurant brothers--Forrest (Tom Hardy), Howard (Jason Clarke), and Jack (Shia LaBeouf)--are getting along as best they can in depression-era Virginia. They run a little diner and gas station in Franklin, but they have a more lucrative source of income that involves running moonshine. They don't have to worry about the law--not only is the local constabulary in the know, but they're also customers.

Legend has it that the Bondurants are invincible, and sometimes the boys believe that story themselves. Forrest is short on words, but what he does say carries a punch. Jack is still young, but he's eager to learn and he hates the way that they often blow him off. He plots and schemes with his best friend, a crippled young man named Cricket who's a mechanical genius, experimenting with making his own brand of white lightning. When he first spies Bertha Minnix (Mia Wasikowska), he is smitten with the young girl. Unfortunately for him, she's the daughter of a very protective minister, and when Jack shows up unexpectedly at one of their services, he's not prepared to have his feet washed by Bertha, and bolts from the premises as though a fire was lit under him.

Bad news arrives in Franklin in the form of a new special agent, Charlie Brakes (Guy Pearce), who's determined to do things his way, and to have everybody in the county knuckle under to his rule. He is a nasty piece of work, and right away he and the Bondurants butt heads.

A young woman named Maggie (Jessica Chastain) shows up one day looking for work, and Forrest hires her when she tells him she's tired of life in the big city, she's looking for something easier.

One day Jack witnesses a remarkable sight. He spies a man with a Tommy gun shoot up a man in cold blood. He knows who the killer is--the infamous Floyd Banner (Gary Oldman). He makes eye contact with Banner and the killer winks at him before he drives away. Later, when due to circumstances their paths cross again, that first meeting will stand Jack in good stead.

When the rest of Franklin gives in to Brakes and his bullying tactics, the Bondurants refuse to cave and find themselves standing alone. Jack is determined to pull his weight, so that he can be worthy of courting Bertha, even if he does run when he sees her preacher father heading in his direction. He gets his chance to shine when Forrest unexpectedly ends up in the hospital, showing that he is true Bondurant material. The brothers are doing well for themselves, but how long can that affluence last when Brakes is bound and determined that they will knuckle under to his authority?

Based on a true story, this is a tale of three brothers and their struggle to survive during hard times. The tagline for this film is: When the law became corrupt, outlaws became heroes. I read a criticism of the film, before I saw it, and one of the comments involved Tom Hardy's accent, claiming it was thick, and hard to understand, and not well done, but I didn't find that to be the case at all. I had no problem understanding him, and I thought his portrayal of Forrest Bondurant was well done. In fact, my daughter, who watched the movie with me, said she thought he could have used a little more of an accent, not less. I recently saw Tom in Tinker Tailor, Soldier, Spy, and that character and this were totally worlds apart. He has a rather chameleon-like quality, similar to another actor in TTSS, who also plays in Lawless, veteran actor Gary Oldman. Of Mr. Oldman's performance, all I can say is I wish he'd had more scenes; he lights up the screen every time he's on it. I liked Jason Clarke as the often volatile Howard. I used to watch him in Brotherhood, and before that I saw him in the film Rabbit Proof Fence. You wouldn't know he's Australian; he does accents very well indeed. Shie LaBoeuf is great as the young, up and coming Jack Bondurant. I loved his scenes with his friend Cricket, as well as his wooing of the young religious girl, played by Mia Wasikowska, whom I saw in Jane Eyre and Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland.

I enjoyed the plot and the writing, and there are some rather stunning visuals in this film. I grew to like and root for the Bondurants, and I prayed that they would not come to a bad end. If you want to know whether they do or not, you'll have to see the film. Lawless is a violent film, so I wouldn't recommend it for young children, but teenagers and up should be fine.  I rate this film 4 stars.",1346630400,2,4450,4.519254658385093
5094062,5,B007KW5NG2,"This has got to be one of the best movies I have seen in years.  It grabs you on a visceral level from the first minute... and even has a good ending (I'm still a girl, what can I say).  I never write reviews, but I just really think that this movie has not near been appreciated enough.  In a time when everything coming out of Hollywood is a remake or just plain stupid this was a shining example of what a movie can be.  It was pure Americana with love, family, principle, and in the end, justice.  And though Forrest doesn't talk much, everything he has to say is poetic, even when the talking he is doing is with his brass knuckles.",1346544000,2,637,4.146341463414634
5094063,4,B007KW5NG2,"""Lawless"" (115 min.) brings the story, ""based on true facts"" we are reminded at the beginning of the movie, of the Bondurant brothers -- Forrest (played by Tom Hardy), Howard (played by Jason Clarke) and Jack (played by Shia LaBeouf) in the early 1930s, running a bootlegging business in ""the wettest county of the world"", Franklin County, VA, during the Prohibition era. Of course troubles ensue, when the authorities try to bunker down on their illegal activities, none more so than by brutal Special Agent Charlie Rakes (played by Guy Pearce). To give more away of the plot would riun your viewing experience.

Several comments: first and foremost, Tom Hardy shows us what a great acting talent he really is, in a role which allows him to stretch, much more so than when we saw him earlier this summer as the ""mask man"" in The Dark Knight Rises. But there are several other choice performances: Jessica Chastain (as the eventual girlfriend of Forrest) confirms once again that she is truly one of the best up-and-coming female talents of this generation (after her recent roles in The Debt, The Three of Life and The Help). And what about Mia Wasikowska, in the role of eventual girfriend of Jack, still only 22 yrs. old and continuing her ascent as one of the better femal actresses today as well.

The movie rolls along very nicely, and these 2 hours flew by in no time. I enjoyed this from start to finish. ""Lawless"" brings an excellent slice-of-life from the turbulent early 1930s. ""Lawless"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1346457600,31,1521,4.801526717557252
5094064,4,B007KW5NG2,"""Lawless"" is one of the best examples of a new trend in Hollywood to advertise a movie as being something they are not. Judging by the trailers I felt I was going to see a fairly typical prohibition era gangster movie with plenty of action and violence between backwoods moonshiners and big city gangsters/cops. What I got instead was something akin to a prohibition era ""Goodfellas"" of three brothers in Franklin County Virginia (which if I'm not mistaken is to this day the moonshine capital of America). It is a quiet movie revolving around the everyday activities of three men who live anything but an ordinary life and just because it lacks action doesn't mean it is short on violence most of which is shown to the audience starkly and via close up in a way that is troublesome to say the least, if not downright disturbing. I enjoyed the film very much, my only real complaint was that Tom Hardy's performance was so understated that it left me wanting to run and ask someone to raise the volume in the theatre so that I could better hear what he was saying.

This movie should please anyone who is okay accepting that gangster movies are more than one action scene after another and I greatly recommend it to any fans of ""Boardwalk Empire"" as it could easily be viewed as the story of where Nucky's booze comes from.",1346457600,2,1323,4.5588235294117645
5094065,5,B007KW5NG2,"There had been talk before sitting down to see ""Lawless"" that certain actors had been labeled as underutilized in early reviews. The only person you could really make that argument for is Gary Oldman since he only has around five minutes of screen time, but his performance is still memorable. He still makes one hell of an impact and hits all the right marks you expect him to when he plays a villainous type of character. The rest of the cast is absolutely extraordinary, as well. You may still hear a hint of Bane in Tom Hardy's voice, but he quickly wins you over with his subtle humor, deep voice, and slight drawl. It was surprising to see Jessica Chastain nude here, but her emotional performance is what you'll remember most about her character.

This is very much Jack Bondurant's story. Portrayed by Shia LaBeouf, it has become easier and easier to write LaBeouf off as an actor since he's always sticking his foot in his mouth in interviews. If you were ever a fan of his, he reminds you why you ever appreciated his talent in ""Lawless."" Jack really comes into his own throughout the length of the film. You see him mature and lose his innocence along the way. He's tainted by the events of the film and LaBeouf portrays this incredible display of temporary nobility, despair, heartbreak, and revenge.

Without a doubt, the actor you'll be talking about the most is Guy Pearce. Pearce is rarely disappointing, but he brings it to another level here. Charlie Rakes has no sense of morality and will stop at nothing to get what he wants. He's downright despicable and the way his facial expressions are immediately overcome with the overflowing urge to hurt whoever is standing in his way is terrifying in this extremely impressive sense.

The film is able to do some extraordinary feats with just a change of lighting or weather conditions that usually involve a character being hurt or killed. The scene outside the gas station where Maggie (Chastain) finds Forrest (Hardy) and it's just beginning to snow is fantastic. It's so tragic yet beautiful at the same time. Then there's that scene on the bridge near the end of the film where Jack and his brother Howard (Jason Clarke) chase after Rakes. A wooden tunnel causes nearly the entire sequence to be shot in the shadows. There's also the aspect of three characters going into that tunnel and when they emerge on the other side, none of them are the same.

The only issue really seems to lie within the ending, which isn't bad and shouldn't even be considered as unsatisfying. It's just a little lukewarm in comparison to everything else that came before it and is the calmest moment of the film.

""Lawless"" is an incredible crime film that allows each of its key cast members to shine. The subtle and dry humor is really funny at times and Guy Pearce is so devilishly evil that you can't help but love his performance. While the summer season is winding down, ""Lawless"" is the intense, bloody, and remarkable reminder that the best films of the year are right around the corner.",1346284800,73,3043,4.680373831775701
5094066,3,B007KW5NG2,"Three Depression-era Bondurant brothers in Virginia - who just happen to be bootleggers - contend with competition and crooked cops. With R-rated action and brutal people, this one made me hide my eyes more than a few times....things are far more intense for me when I know in advance that a story is based on real life.

We see:
  * Jason Clarke (""Zero Dark Thirty"") is Howard Bondurant, the oldest brother; just don't make him mad!
  * Tom Hardy (""Warrior"") is Forrest Bondurant, the indestructible one; his brushes with death are the stuff of local legend.
  * Shia LaBeouf (""Transformers"") is Jack Bondurant, the reckless youngest brother, always in need of a helping hand from his older siblings.
  * Dane DeHaan (""In Treatment"") is Cricket, the sweet friend who suffered from rickets as a child, but is a great tinkerer!
  * Guy Pearce (""Lockdown"") is Charlie Rakes, the vain, over-cologned federal officer.
  * Jessica Chastain (""Coriolanus"") is Maggie Beauford, Forrest's love interest... When I admired Ms. Chastain in 2008 for her work in ""Jolene,"" little did I realize the magnitude of her impending success. She works harder, in a wider variety of roles and more consistently than anyone else I can think of.
  * Mia Wasikowska (""Jane Eyre"") looking for all the world like a Vermeer painting, is the preacher's daughter who catches young Jack's eye. Her preacher/father does NOT like him!

We watch the arc of the Bondurant family's success in the late 20s and early 30s and see the impact of federal authorities who have been sent there to clear out the moonshiners. The locals are merely intimidated bystanders, but when the chips are down, it's clear where their loyalties are.

Car lovers will LOVE all those period automobiles; one even runs on moonshine!

Some of these guys talk like they have a mouthful of chewing tobacco; I'll be glad when this is available on Amazon.com so I can use the Closed Captions!",1346198400,12,1927,4.876923076923077
5094067,5,B007KW5NG2,"THE LAWLESS is finally getting the attention it deserves.

From the Paramount ""B"" unit of Pine-Thomas, this is their finest hour indeed.

Many scenes were actually repulsive in how violent they were and didn't do much to add to the movie.

A lot of the movie just seemed so stereotyped (of course the young outlaw falls for the preacher's daughter) and contrived (why on earth would the youngest brother leave on his own to sell the alcohol)? Shia LeBouf had a terrible accent the entire time. As a review I read said, the movie alternatingly tries to be too serious and then too lighthearted.

5094077,4,B007KW5NG2,"In Hollywood, there has always been a tendency to play it safe and produce films based on tried-and-true formulas designed strictly as mainstream entertainment. Yet in every decade there have been a few brave directors who defied convention and dared to create substantive motion pictures dealing with important social issues.  Many of these bold productions are pretty much forgotten, but modern audiences now have a chance to see, thanks to DVD, a number of memorable movies from the past that explored how fear and ignorance can quickly lead to violence and hatred.  Two of the most notable examples are THE WELL, directed by Leo Popkin & Russell Rouse, and this film, THE LAWLESS, directed by Joseph Losey.  While neither could honestly be called a cinematic masterpiece, both are worth viewing for their consciousness-raising content.
THE LAWLESS deals with the friction in a small California community between self-righteous townspeople and Mexican-American farm workers (referred to as ""fruit tramps"" by the locals).  Macdonald Carey plays a newly-arrived newspaper editor who becomes interested in the case of a young Hispanic man wanted by the police on a number of questionable charges.  The trouble reaches a boiling point when the youth is captured and the ""decent"" townsfolk assemble in a mob determined to carry out their own ideas of justice.  All things considered, the film takes a fairly bold stand on the rights of the accused, and the subject matter is pretty strong stuff for 1950.  Unfortunately, the movie's power is somewhat muted by a rather uninspired performance by Carey and a script that lacks a sharp dramatic edge.  One never gets a sense that the editor has any deep convictions, so it's hard to know how he truly feels about the farm workers.  Consequently we don't develop any emotional connection with him and the film's climax falls a bit short of expectations.  Nonetheless, THE LAWLESS definitely holds your attention and ultimately packs quite an impressive punch.
Sixty years later, many of the issues explored in these remarkable films remain sadly relevant.  America is still wrestling with matters of race and ethnic/religious heritage, as any survey of the daily news will attest.  So, were any lessons learned from motion pictures like THE WELL and THE LAWLESS?  Obviously they were not big box-office hits that created a national discussion.  They mainly served to shine a light on some naked truths about the fragility of our ostensibly civilized society.  Film lovers will have to console themselves with the thought that if these movies caused even a few individuals to stop and think, then they were at least partly successful.",1347580800,4,2677,5.150115473441109

Pros:
-Honest look at relationships (especially for the time)
-Didn't translate when Spanish was spoken (only a few, but I hate language restates in movies)
-Acting was good for the year and ""B"" movie tag
-Portrayed both sides with sympathy (not typical race relations movie)

Cons:
-Caucasian (White) playing the lead Hispanic role (I would have given 5 stars if a Hispanic person would have played the Role, so close to an absolute groundbreaking movie)

I liked the film.  There were a few films around this time that attempted to portray minorities and minority plight with honesty and a little sugar, so that the majority could understand what was really happening in Minority Life and how it affected society.  This movie did a very good job with making it understandable that anyone could find themselves in these situations.  Again, this was 1950 and I don't know if there is any other film before this time that captured real drama (as opposed to Hollywood's typical melodrama that continues to today).  I recommend this film to anyone.",1460505600,,1086,5.0

8519184,4,B007KW5NG2,"It was a good ""old movie"".  Just make sure you are a fan of the old black and white movies before watching this movie.  The story was interesting enough to keep my attention.  It was more or less about the hardships of Hispanics living and working in the U.S. and the wealthier white kids and even the white grownups looking down on them and judging them and making life hard for them. One newspaper man printed the truth about one particular Hispanic who was wrongly accused of crimes, and his newspaper was burned out by the angry mobs.",1418515200,,538,4.469387755102041
