2964715,5,B000WC38WS,"This movie was one of the most heart touching movies I have seen in a very long.  The characters were so true to real life and every one of the actors gave superb performances.  I really loved this movie, and it is one move that I will watch over and over again.  This movie will make you think about what your priorities are and might give some people a chance to reevalate their priorities.  This is truly a worthwhile film.  My hat is off to each and every person who was involved in the production of this movie. A class production that is definitely worth watching.",1318204800,4,570,4.339622641509434
2964716,3,B000WC38WS,Thanks for the fast service. I could not get into this movie. It is a okay movie. But slow I thought!!!!!,1305417600,,105,4.0476190476190474
2964717,3,B000WC38WS,"""A Perfect Day"" is tolerably preachy, tolerably predictable, tolerably sentimental -- and provides a perfect (mind-wandering) way to wile away 90 minutes with your eyes half-glued to the TV set.

The ""guardian angel"" surprise at the end (if not all that convincing) was appreciably clever enough to allow me to award the film three generous stars.

Without expecting anything intellectually challenging or profound, go right ahead and watch it once -- then make a gift of it to a simpering relative.",1302825600,,499,5.148148148148148
2964718,5,B000WC38WS,"A Perfect Day, is a great film. IT reminded me of a modern day It's Wonderful Life. Don't miss this one, rent it buy it or watch it with tissues.

I highly recommend this film.",1259798400,11,176,4.0285714285714285

2964720,5,B000WC38WS,"I liked this movie. It is a good family movie. It doesn't go by the book all the way through but I have given up on hollywood ever going by the book! The acting is good, and the story is good. The book gives soooo many more details that make the story make sense. Read the book first, then watch the movie.

A man's dream of a national best seller and his dream comes true. What he does with that sucess is not so good.",1199404800,9,419,3.929411764705882
2964721,4,B000WC38WS,"A perfect Day is one of those films that are great for a cool winter evening.  Cuddle up on the couch with your family and enjoy the heart warming journey to success and back to valuing what is really important.  Rob Lowe, Christopher Lloyd and a well chosen cast bring the Richard Paul Evans novel to life.

It's not a Hallmark production, but it is packed with good solid storytelling and performances.  Love never goes out of style.

2964774,4,B000WC38WS,This movie really hits home for many people.  It shows how we can get really involved with something and forget what is really important in life.  I really recommend this movie.

2964778,2,B000WC38WS,"It is somewhat unfair for me to rate the movie at all because I started watching it, being a free movie, was interrupted and had to stop the movie. When I went back to resume the movie it said it was $3.99 to watch so I didn't get to finish watching. To say I was irritated and angry was putting it mild.

2964855,1,B000WC38WS,"Disappointment doesn't begin to describe how I feet about this movie. I usually love Rob Lowe but this was, in my opinion, not worth watching. A few reasons. The H and h had a very poor relationship from the beginning and unfortunately the man was clueless as to how he was breaking his family apart. He is arrogant, cocky and a regular pain in the rear. He listens to no one! Oh yes, did I mention he always does exactly what he wants and to heck with his wife and child.

Husband barely talks to wife all throughout the movie but he sure could talk to the pretty lady who was his traveling partner as they toured months on end and rarely does he bother to call home.

I didn't feel any emotional connection between myself and the characters in the movie. I just felt nothing for these people. I tried really hard to stir up some emotions in myself but it just didn't happen. There was a barely there ending but not one that left me feeling happy or at least satisfied.",1448841600,,970,4.295081967213115
2964856,5,B000WC38WS,I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. Good one to watch with the wife around Christmas time. Similar to a Christmas Carol/scrooge.,1448755200,,134,5.136363636363637
2964857,2,B000WC38WS,"The reviews and description of this movie were misleading! Great storyline & premise, wasn't even in the same category of A Wonderful Life. Spoiler alert: his first agent Camille and another author under her supervision concocted a ""game"" in which he was brainwashed into believing he would die on Christmas Day all in the cause to save his marriage. I would have reported them and sued. Not a good holiday story :(",1448496000,,415,4.777777777777778

2964903,2,B000WC38WS,"I thought this was going to be an uplifting movie, but I was mistaken.  The scant description seemed to be a good premise for a story - ""A family man and suddenly-successful author encounters a mystic stranger who warns him he has only 40 more days to live.""

With a seeming Christmas theme, I assumed this would be somewhat of a ""It's a Wonderful Life"" or ""The Family Man"" type of movie where the main character realizes that his family is the most important thing in life and all else is unimportant and the viewer is left with a feel good vibe.  But, it was an hour into this 1 hr and 30 minute movie before he was told he only has a limited time left to live. So, for an hour, we see how he becomes successful and his family life subsequently starts to fall apart.  A downer!  After he's told he's going to die (and I missed where he was told 40 days...), I didn't feel there was any emotion in his character and I'm not even sure how he ended up back with his wife and kids.  It could have been a good story, but it fell flat for me.",1448323200,,1038,4.088669950738916

2965061,4,B000WC38WS,"A tale w/a twist on Dickens ""A Christmas Carol"" redemption. The main character, Lowe, suddenly finds writing success, but lets the fame, attention and money go to his head, eventually and inevitably running off the tracks. The twist comes when you find that Lowe's first publishing agent works w/her mortician/writer client to turn Lowe around. But the ""twist"" goes too far, nearly wrecking the intended purpose. However, Lowe finds just in time that people and family are worth much more than everything he's found through writing success and salvages his life.

A film w/a good story line. Characters are well-acted and believable. Possibly one of Lowe's better performances. On balance, worth the time spent watching, as well as time spent trying to determine just how things will be resolved and what's really going on behind the ""scenes.""",1439596800,,843,5.153284671532846

God's Word says it this way: What good will it be for a man if he gains the whole world, yet forfeits his soul? Or what can a man give in exchange for his soul? (Matthew 16:26)

Our greatest joy becomes what we can do for others and give to others, and how we can help them grow and prosper spiritually. Those who have risen to these heights of achievement understand true success, because a person can have all the power, money, popularity and prestige the world has to offer, but if his soul is empty and bitter, worldly success is really failure.

Life is all about choices and priorities. This movie was written with the best ones in mind! Watch it through to the end and learn it's life lessons.",1420502400,,789,4.2885906040268456

There are some different plot and character elements which make this story somewhat different from other renditions, but it's basically a story which has been told countless times before. And try not to think too much about the ending of this one, because if you do you'll begin to see that it just doesn't make sense, especially concerning the mysterious stranger.

She was very good and made me long to see her in other things. I've been a fan of hers since Six Feet Under and she played this movie role with sincerity and aplomb.

3199214,3,B000WC38WS,"""A Perfect Day"" is tolerably preachy, tolerably predictable, tolerably sentimental -- and provides a perfect (mind-wandering) way to wile away 90 minutes with your eyes half-glued to the TV set.

The ""guardian angel"" surprise at the end (if not all that convincing) was appreciably clever enough to allow me to award the film three generous stars.

3199352,1,B000WC38WS,"Disappointment doesn't begin to describe how I feet about this movie. I usually love Rob Lowe but this was, in my opinion, not worth watching. A few reasons. The H and h had a very poor relationship from the beginning and unfortunately the man was clueless as to how he was breaking his family apart. He is arrogant, cocky and a regular pain in the rear. He listens to no one! Oh yes, did I mention he always does exactly what he wants and to heck with his wife and child.

Husband barely talks to wife all throughout the movie but he sure could talk to the pretty lady who was his traveling partner as they toured months on end and rarely does he bother to call home.

I didn't feel any emotional connection between myself and the characters in the movie. I just felt nothing for these people. I tried really hard to stir up some emotions in myself but it just didn't happen. There was a barely there ending but not one that left me feeling happy or at least satisfied.",1448841600,,970,4.295081967213115

With a seeming Christmas theme, I assumed this would be somewhat of a ""It's a Wonderful Life"" or ""The Family Man"" type of movie where the main character realizes that his family is the most important thing in life and all else is unimportant and the viewer is left with a feel good vibe.  But, it was an hour into this 1 hr and 30 minute movie before he was told he only has a limited time left to live. So, for an hour, we see how he becomes successful and his family life subsequently starts to fall apart.  A downer!  After he's told he's going to die (and I missed where he was told 40 days...), I didn't feel there was any emotion in his character and I'm not even sure how he ended up back with his wife and kids.

3199558,4,B000WC38WS,"A tale w/a twist on Dickens ""A Christmas Carol"" redemption. The main character, Lowe, suddenly finds writing success, but lets the fame, attention and money go to his head, eventually and inevitably running off the tracks. The twist comes when you find that Lowe's first publishing agent works w/her mortician/writer client to turn Lowe around. But the ""twist"" goes too far, nearly wrecking the intended purpose. However, Lowe finds just in time that people and family are worth much more than everything he's found through writing success and salvages his life.

A film w/a good story line. Characters are well-acted and believable. Possibly one of Lowe's better performances. On balance, worth the time spent watching, as well as time spent trying to determine just how things will be resolved and what's really going on behind the ""scenes.""",1439596800,,843,5.153284671532846

God's Word says it this way: What good will it be for a man if he gains the whole world, yet forfeits his soul? Or what can a man give in exchange for his soul? (Matthew 16:26)

Our greatest joy becomes what we can do for others and give to others, and how we can help them grow and prosper spiritually. Those who have risen to these heights of achievement understand true success, because a person can have all the power, money, popularity and prestige the world has to offer, but if his soul is empty and bitter, worldly success is really failure.

Life is all about choices and priorities. This movie was written with the best ones in mind! Watch it through to the end and learn it's life lessons.",1420502400,,789,4.2885906040268456

With the support of his wife he finishes a book that he near completion.  After several attempts he finds a agent that believes in his talent and the book is a outstanding success.  The book goes to number one and it also goes to his head as he forgets his friends and family who supported him for money and success.  With prodding by a mysterious stranger he finds his way back.  A well done movie with a Hallmark feel to it.  Enjoyable and entertaining.  Again, solid acting.",1413244800,,597,4.3545454545454545

3200004,5,B000WC38WS,An excellant story about prosperity and how easily it can change ones values. Even though I watched it fairly closely I was surprised at how the end came about.

8222245,4,B000WC38WS,"Rob Lowe (Wayne's World) initially plays a similar character to Benjamin in that movie who after 15 years is let go by his radio station, whose advertising revenue is dropping fast with an attractive young woman getting the promotion he thought he'd get.  Rob (yes they use the same first name as the actor) is ambushed by a surprise party celebrating the promotion and tells his judgmental father in front of everyone that he quit his job.  His father rants on about him being an idiot and later he confides to his wife the truth about being laid off.  Being his work life experience is in a rapidly downsizing industry he can't land a job so his wife encourages him to finish a book he's been writing for years.  Unbeknownst to her it is about her life.  She loves it and so does one of the publishers he's sent the book too.  Soon the book goes viral and he's the most sought after author in the world.  But with fame cames a weird stalker (Christopher Lloyd) who keeps warning him with mysterious lines, and as their runs in continue seems to know stuff about the writer's life that has never been made public, he even seems to be able to predict the future.  Is this Doc Emmett who is visiting from the future to warn the author of a path that leads to disaster, he even insults him with Doc's dog's name at one point?

It's not a bad movie, but part of the fun is the fantasy Back to the Future stuff your making up as the movie goes along.  There's nothing wrong with any of the acting but the wife is a somewhat annoying character (spoilers follow).  Rob would of course have to keep promoting and going on TV whenever the rare opportunity arises to keep the momentum going of sales of his only book.  Once they stop they've got no income since she has lived the lucrative life of radio executive wife and now author wife rather than working herself over the years.  Surely they could have just homeschooled the daughter on the road trip around America and traveled as a family, the daughter would have learnt more on the road seeing the country and meeting people from different cultures and demographics than a couple of months at home.  Why would he sabotage his own career to go to the funeral of an old woman?  She's dead she doesn't know or care who's there and why hold it on the same day you know he has major commitments at an important event where if if he snubs them his career will come to a halt.",1466985600,,2417,4.363839285714286

If you haven't watched The Grinder, or read his books Love Life and Stories I Only Tell My Friends, please do so immediately!  That being said, A Perfect Day is so dreadfully bad that the movies on either side of it in the Amazon movie listings should have stars deducted from them due to guilt by association.  So bad, it makes The Christmas Shoes watchable by comparison...So bad I'd pay another $2.99 to ensure I'd never have to watch it again...The Grinder rests...",1454889600,,527,4.526315789473684
