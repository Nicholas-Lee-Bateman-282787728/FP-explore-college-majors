4126121,4,B003IB0FRG,"hink Survivor.  Outthink, out perform, outlast:  survive!
The media hit Survivor is `real', partially scripted, heavily edited, and high on drama.  Endgames' premise is very similar with the winner leaving his his/her life!  It doesn't get any better for any action/drama film.
Two rival teams of government assassins working out of the same top secret government installation are locked together after the murder of the boss.  Secrecy is the key as the individual members go by tarot names, and the new guy, The Fool, is pitted against his team-mates and rival assassins.  The result is fireworks, intrigue, deception, and survival of the fittest.
You might expect this would be an all out action film, but it is not.  There are some light moments with comedy, and very creative uses of office furniture and supplies.  The film is Restricted for violence (obviously) and high on vulgarity.  Aside from that, it is well constructed and produced, with the actual action sequences `realistic' (as much as they can be), and the dramatic tension well maintained.
""Operation: Endgame"" stars Joe Anderson, Rob Corddry, Ellen Barkin, Odette Yustman, Emilie de ravin,  and Maggie Q.  Highly promoted this is one of those films that just might become a cult favorite!
Check it out!",1280880000,,1272,5.096618357487923
4126122,1,B003IB0FRG,I rented this movie because of Ellen Barkin. I never would believe she would participate in such an incredible bad movie. I was proven very wrong on that assumption. I could not finish this movie. It was so bad. I can't think of a worst movie.,1280793600,5,243,4.304347826086956
4126123,3,B003IB0FRG,"I could barely believe what I was seeing as I sat and watched this digustingly funny movie. This is a coal black comedy about two covert government departments (Alpha and Omega) who are supposed to keep each other in check so that the black ops they are pulling off don't get too out of hand. A new kid arrives for his first day on the job and the boss gets murdered. Next thing you know the two teams' members are knocking each other off one by one as they try to find a way out of their secure facility before a bomb goes off and wipes the entire place out.

I have never heard so much foul language and over the top, up-chuckingly vile insults in my whole life. Ellen Barkin delivers one insult that is so disturbingly toxic I considered taking a shower afterward.

On the good side they put the budget in the cast. The sets are limited so the likes of Barkin, Zak Galifianakis, Rob Corrdry, et al get to do their thing without being swallowed up by their surroundings. The cinematography, editing etc. are all decent. Everything else goes to the writing.

This is not an easy type of movie to pen. Yes it's a dark comedy, but the darkness comes from the fact that, at the base of this, there are truisms. There are several off-handed remarks that reference various conspiracy theories currently in circulation. And that you are dealing with a highly secret department, while the Obama inauguration airs on various televisions throughout the film, and he speaks of hoping to offer a transparent government, is a sad reminder of what has happened to our supposedly free society. To balance this with the utterly depraved humor is no easy task. My wife heard much of it from the next room and thought it was rather horrible. She is probably right, but that's what the producers were going for. They succeeded all too well.

This is not for everybody. There is a meanness to it all. But it's more incredible than seeing a train wreck. You simply cannot believe what you are seeing. It just doesn't compute.",1280448000,2,2006,4.533149171270718
4126124,1,B003IB0FRG,"With such a promising cast.. this movie was absolute trash. There is a reason it went straight to DVD. The script sucked, the directors vision sucked and the movie budget had to have been a rented out office and a HD cam from best buy. Not sure how they paid the actors and expect to get ANY kind of return from this with the DVD sales. Do yourself a favor and don't watch it. You will be terribly disappointed. Apparently it's the directors first movie and it will almost definitely will be his last.

The guy with 1 review on here saying all these great things that are in it is 100% part of the movie in some way. There can't be one person who would ever think this movie is good. Fighting scenes get summed up like this: one 60 year old lady with a putter will intimidate and beat up 3 assassins who don't even try to fight back.. yes, that's a real scene. You won't laugh, you'll just wonder ""why am I still watching this?""

I just truly feel sorry for the actors who agreed to do this film not knowing what the director was capable of. Sucks for them and sucks for anyone pulled in by the cast that will watch this movie, like I did.",1280188800,3,1139,4.172727272727273
4126125,5,B003IB0FRG,"Those who are calling this movie a let-down are entitled to their opinions, but I viewed this film not knowing what I was watching until I was entranced in the intense footage of the action scenes, blood and all. After researching some, I realized what I was watching, and although I was still a bit confused, everything cleared up as the movie progressed. This movie shouldn't be taken as a serious storyline and plot, but rather one of excitement and a laid-back guy's night in flick while eating or doing whatever makes you have a great night. It is what it is, a dry-humor comedy with action and drama. Great film!",1279929600,6,618,4.576576576576577
4126126,4,B003IB0FRG,"Aside from there being no marketing for stores to carry this title, the entire cover being false and misleading, and the title being incorrect from the content - this was actually worth the watch.

The title played well for customers on a couple screenings but mostly just for Corddry's opening 12 minutes of one-liners. The story follows a group of secret agents and their watchers as they fight for their lives in an underground base that contains all of the government's secrets for the last 50 years. The makers have this entire film take place on the inauguration day for Obama - rife with plenty of speech footage being intertwined with the action. The violence is bloody, the one-liners are all delivered by Rob and a few by Barkin, and the rest of the performances are either short-lived or average. My only other real like of this film are the security camera watchers that observe the whole chaotic mess unfold (that doctor guy from Serenity plays well here).

The BD quality is decent, but once the lights go out during the last 15 minutes, the clarity fades. The special effects sequence/explosion is laughable and has no reference points. The sound is selectable between a PCM (my preference) and standard Dolby. The special features were an after thought and include:

* Alternate Opening, 2 minutes. Forgettable and makes no sense once you know what the twist in the film is.
* Alternate Ending, 30 seconds. Huh? Nothing was different - waste.
* Behind the Scenes, 11 minutes. An un-narrated mess of film clips and interviews, gives one or two fair moments of material about the film making - not worth the time though.

Now the dings - the cover art would have you believe everyone shoots a gun (no). Interesting enough that the only person who actually uses a gun in the entire film is not even on the cover. Galifianakis is front and center, but he is actually in it for only a few minutes. The rated-R rants of Corddry are what save this film and his brief action stints were fun to watch. 2.5 for the film, .5 for the BD quality and inclusion of weak extras, and .5 for Rob. Not a great product overall, but customers are extremely interested since no one got to see it in theaters, a rental not a buyer.",1279929600,5,2224,4.608585858585859
4126127,5,B003IB0FRG,"Gross, bloody, marginally reasonable with many twists that goes beyond the traditional spy and lock-up suspense thriller. The director really did a good job. It kept you wondering what's going on, with the right timing and dose of violence, and even black humor. I am used to fast forward in this genre of movie. However, I didn't even press once for this. I really would love to share with you more but I dare not steal you of the fun by telling the plot (who and how each ""assasin"" died). In short, recommended strongly, in particular with your girl friend beside.",1279411200,3,566,4.6138613861386135

4126145,5,B003IB0FRG,"This movie is different, and I like it because it is. I did not find it predictable and the fight scenes may be brief but you didn't have to suffer a 30 minute slap fight. The plot is a group of spies, alpha and omega, are locked in an underground facility after their boss was assassinated. The facility set to blow, suspicion and conspiracy has the two teams killing each other, all being witnessed by two monitors who can do nothing but watch while they are locked out of the system.

It has a cast but if you're expecting Maggie Q. or Zach G., they're barely in it. And, if your on a time limit say, a buildings about to go down, are you gonna tickle, slap, or whatever happens in extremely long fight scenes? or are you gonna kill your obstacle.",1451606400,,750,4.28169014084507

4126152,3,B003IB0FRG,This movie was...interesting. The seemed to try to pack a lot into this movie and it felt as though some of the best characters didn't get the amount of screen time you'd expect/want.

4126161,5,B003IB0FRG,"Anything with Joe Anderson in it is worth the purchase in my book.  What an excellent actor!  Not bad to look at either!!  This is just my own personal opinion though, you have yours.",1363305600,,183,4.323529411764706
4126162,2,B003IB0FRG,"""Operation: Endgame"" (also known as ""Rogues Gallery"") starts out promisingly, with a newly recruited agent codenamed ""Fool"" (Joe Anderson, ""Across the Universe"") ready for his first assignment. He is sent to the government's underground facilities, where he is introduced to members of two groups Omega and Alpha. Both teams are composed of eccentric agents all named after tarot cards, including ""Chariot"" (Rob Corddry), ""Empress"" (Ellen Barkin), ""Hierophant"" (Emilie de Ravin) and ""High Priestess"" (Maggie Q) and ""Judgment"" (Ving Rhames).

However, there is something not quite right about the way some of the agents including ""Devil"" (Jeffrey Tambor) act. With a new president about to be inaugurated, there is some conspiracy going on. And it looks like things are definitely not right when one of them is found horribly murdered (with pencils stuck in the body).

What follows in this dark action comedy is a survival game of government agents killing each other. The idea is fine and the cast is interesting, but the story is poorly written (script penned by Sam Levinson, director Barry Levinson's son), and the film is woefully directed. Actors like Maggie Q, Ving Rhames and Zach Galifianakis are all wasted in forgettable roles. Action scenes are amateurish. Rob Corddry and Ellen Barkin are fun to watch, but not enough to save this mess.

Produced by Richard Kelly of ""Donnie Darko"" fame, ""Operation: Endgame"" becomes tedious towards the end, taking itself too seriously. With a running time of less than 90 minutes, ""Operation: Endgame"" feels very long, not knowing what it really wants to do.",1354838400,2,1606,5.217054263565892
