7811189,4,6301332865,"One dreary afternoon a few years ago, I happened to be flipping channels when this movie aired on A&E, and I was glued to it the entire running time. It is quite dated, to be sure, but the thrills come from actual suspense and some subtle hints, which make more graphic TV movies more obvious.

Kathleen Beller is exceptional as Amy, the heroine, who is menaced by a stranger in a ski mask. The problem is, no one believes her, and her stepmother Adele (a masterful Mariette Hartley) begins to think that her stepdaughter is on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Amy is seeing a psychiatrist, portrayed by Keir Dullea, who thinks her father's tragic death may be the cause of any hallucinations Amy may be having. Twists and turns abound as Amy begins to wonder if she really is losing her mind, or is the stalker flesh and blood real? Gary Graham does an excellent job portraying her mysterious love interest, David. Let's just say that things are not what they seem, and we have an array of possible suspects. A girl can't trust anyone anymore! With her large, beautifully haunted eyes, Beller is perfectly cast as the terrorized young artist/heiress, and she gave an equally excellent performance as a rape victim in the TV movie ""Are You In The House Alone?"" (1978). Hartley's portrayal is superbly mastered with conflict. Dullea, in one of his many subtly creepy turns, fits the bill, while Graham embodies his elusively seductive character expertly.

Don't miss it if it airs on TV again, and a DVD release should be in consideration!",1334361600,,1539,4.717472118959108
