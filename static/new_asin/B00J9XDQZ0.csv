8649152,5,B00J9XDQZ0,"Showgirl Toni impulsively marries a college boyfriend, but the marriage is short-lived when her husband assumes she is having an affair with the shows financial backer. Because of the scandal and notoriety, she becomes the talk of the town and very wealthy. Other secrets and complications emerge as the film progresses. This is a highly entertaining precode drama. Joan Blondell and a young Ginger Rogers help make this a hit. Plenty of showgirls in underwear and lots of sexual situations and banter make this a quintessential precode film. The movie is totally engaging, well-acted, great story, and a very satisfying viewing experience.",1487894400,,640,5.284313725490196
