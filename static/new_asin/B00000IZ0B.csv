1231095,5,B00000IZ0B,"Watched twice, still as powerful as the first time since I watched it years ago.  It is a story about a Tai Chi master from Taiwan and living with his American daughter in Law who doesn't speak any Chinese except  ""Thank you"".  As the time goes on, the film portrayed 3  generations in this family: the son, the father, the American wife and the  American born boy.  Not only the communication creates a huge gap between  each generation; also each one of them lives a life with different  characters.  At one scene when the father telling his son that he is no  longer valuable considered by the society and his life is going no where;  the son also told him that throughout his life he is trying to put  everyone's life together with houses, more money, and jobs rather than  finding out the true meaning for the family and the bond each one hold for  the other.  The film shows how each one explored their own worthiness and  how it has impact other people within the family.  Superb acting makes the  film very real and touching.  Indeed a film that is true to life and true  to our hearts.",962150400,22,1094,4.402010050251256
1231096,3,B00000IZ0B,Who thinks that the intelligent niche audience that would go see a non-Hollywood film would appreciate the sides being chopped off?  This is one film that only an idiot would think did not need to be done in a  widescreen format.  This is DVD guys wake up!  Great film though.  Really  touching and made me want to call all my elderly family when I got home.  I  have yet to see an Ang Lee film that isn't worth a Special Edition version.  Another wonderful film by a master.,961286400,12,475,4.306818181818182

7911677,5,B00000IZ0B,"this movie is excellent for those who really truly understand the foundation of tai chi, and the struggle mixed families undergo. might be boring for others.",1390262400,,157,5.076923076923077
7911678,5,B00000IZ0B,"I searched years to find a copy of this film to have and hold for my very own.  A great Ang Lee production, this movie, like so many of his other works, addresses issues of contemporary Chinese culture, following an elderly traditional Chinese man as he adjusts to life in New York.  Cross cultural, inter-generational and aging issues confront Bo Z. Wang as he tries to find a place in his son's mixed-marriage family.  And the push hands sequences are entertaining too!",1360454400,3,471,4.719512195121951
7911679,4,B00000IZ0B,"Another great movie by Ang Lee and superb interpretation by Sihung Lung. The eternal problem of how do deal with our elders. Difficult to keep them at home with our spouses, yet difficult to abandon them in a hospice for old people. It can be a lose-lose situation. Or it can be a win-win situation if all concerned make an effort. In the end, in this movie, the grandfather successfully blends his need to keep in touch with son and grandson, but without interfereing in their lives too much.

As always with Ang lee and Sihung Lung, food and cooking plays out all along the film. It is a healthy reminder of the central role food and eating together plays in family life in any culture. Tai chi is not a central part of this movie, and therefore I'd say the title is a bit out of context. Also, some of the fighting scenes where old Sihung Lung beats dozens of younger men while practically standing still are a bit exaggerated!

The movie is set in the US with a Chinese protagonist, and as such does provide insights into the problematic meeting of Western and Eastern minds, though the issues it addresses are really universal. Strongly recommended.",1341964800,,1154,4.570048309178744
7911680,5,B00000IZ0B,This movie was so very poignant.  The American wife Martha was really good.  Who is this actress.  I'd like to see more of her on films.,1085702400,5,136,4.153846153846154
7911681,4,B00000IZ0B,"While Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon shot Ang Lee into household ranks for his fluid, creative martial arts histrionics, this is no less a masterpiece in the somewhat more subdued version of Kung Fu -- the chinese art of Tai Chi.
The story is wrapped around an old Mr. Chu,a tai chi master (played almost effortlessly by Sihung Lung) who has moved from the rigors of a Beijing life to settle down in the suburbs of NY with his son Alex and his American wife, who's a novelist working from home. Mr Chu is at his wit's end, in a new culture, sans the language, spending his days watching Hong Kong videos vocally critiquing the Kung Fu moves much to the obvious chagrin of his American daughter in law.
While the pretext is predictable (They Dont Get Along), the emotional tussle of his son as an intermediary between his wife and father is well told, even comical at times. The film explores the Chinese ethic of filial relations -- father-son / man-wife / father-daughterinlaw etc. The movie is of a subtle, soft-spoken vein despite the loud emotions.
One minor grouse -- Tai Chi could have been a bit more integral to the story in a manner that food was to Eat Drink Man Woman ( another sensual feast from Lee) particularly in defining the character of Mr. Chu. It is a little difficult to digest that a ""master"" of Tai Chi could have the level of conceit and stubbornness that his character is shown to display.
But that's minor. I doubt Lee would put this movie on the top of his favorites stack, but this is a precious peep into the Lee of yore, the more honest movie maker before he set about making Hollywood blockbusters. Reason enough for me to watch it.",1051142400,20,1662,4.506622516556291
7911682,4,B00000IZ0B,"I can't think of another director like Ang Lee, in that his films are so vastly different from each other yet all are so great, each in their own unique way.
Like many of his films (including Crouching Tiger), this one stars Sihung Lung, a great Chinese actor who unfortunately died of liver failure last month (May 2002) after filming ""The Touch."" He is amazing to watch, as usual, and plays very credibly in Pushing Hands as a Tai Chi master who moves to New York City to live with his son, his son's tightly strung Euro-American daughter in law and their bilingual child.
The ""parent immigrates to live with children and doesn't fit in"" story has been told many ways in many films, but somehow i doubt many of the rest of them are this human, this insightful, or this delightfully humorous.
It's really hard for one who hasn't seen Pushing Hands to imagine from the title, the tagline, the trailer and reviews what makes this film great, because what makes it great is Ang Lee, his constant writing companion James Schamus (also of Crouching Tiger fame), and the great acting, led by Sihung Lung.
If you're not already a fan of Ang Lee's other work besides Crouching Tiger (i.e. Eat Drink Man Woman, The Wedding Banquet, et al), then you might want to rent this one before you buy it, but if you already know you love Ang Lee, it's worth the purchase.",1025481600,12,1354,4.530612244897959
7911683,5,B00000IZ0B,Very simply put this is a TAI CHI classic. Ifyou do Tai Chi or are curious you need this DVD.The film will be understood by TAI CHI practioners and open the minds of those who are contemplating taking up the practice.,997833600,10,217,4.317073170731708
