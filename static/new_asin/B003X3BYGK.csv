8407750,4,B003X3BYGK,"This documentary is only 1 hour long. For the price, I think it is really expensive. It's very enlightening, and I recommend it for any student of art or film. It shows the parallels and differences with the beginning of the art of motion pictures, and how Braque and Picasso both influenced film and was in turn influenced by film. It shows rare nascent clips.",1407801600,,361,4.569230769230769
8407751,2,B003X3BYGK,"Used to introduce middle school students to cubism. They were really uninterested, as was I. Typically I limenlyofrsms like this, but I've seen better.",1404172800,,151,5.333333333333333
8407752,5,B003X3BYGK,"An entertaining and enlightening look at how the new medium of motion picture influenced two of the most influential artists of the 20th century. I own about 4 DVDs (never really was much interested in owning movies), and this is one of them. After seeing it as a loan, I had to have my own copy. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in art, esp. early modernism.",1384905600,,369,4.4411764705882355

8407754,5,B003X3BYGK,"For cubist and film fans, this short documentary was very enlightening. It will change the way you think of Picasso and Braque in the future.",1370131200,,141,4.68
8407755,5,B003X3BYGK,Loved the movie. Will make a huge difference in the history of Art. I just couldn't see what Picasso was getting at until it registered that there was motion. Terrific.,1350432000,,168,4.633333333333334
8407756,4,B003X3BYGK,"I learnt much of cubism and art from this compact sixty minutes documentary of art greats.
