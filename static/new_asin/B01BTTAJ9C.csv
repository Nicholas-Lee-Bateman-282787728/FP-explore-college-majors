7669302,5,B01BTTAJ9C,"This is a family friendly kid movie that has Dolph Lundgren vs kids. How awesome it that? Universal took the reigns and released a sequel to a classic movie. They got director Don Michael Paul on board who has had success with sequels like Jarhead 2 and Tremors 5. His vision is seen in these films as fresh and imaginative. Their plots were different that what a preview appears to show. So, I know that Kindergarten Cop 2 will have just the same impact, that the plot will have something that is unexpected. Thanks to Universal and director Don Michael Paul making this film.",1456272000,5,577,4.5576923076923075

7669305,5,B01BTTAJ9C,"When I first saw the trailer for this, I was a bit worried. It seemed very kiddy and not as mildly gritty as the original. There didn't really appear to be the ""bad guy"" element that made the first so great. Well, after watching an advanced international copy (the Egyptian subtitles were actually sort of educational) I found that I was pleasantly mistaken.

Dolph Lundgren is not to be trifled with in any movie, and KC2 (as it's being called in the underground circles) is no different. Why would the elementary school in the same town think it necessary to bring in yet another oversized foreign police officer to teach kindergarten? First off, it worked the first time around. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Even more importantly is why he is there though... Both detectives John Kimble and Phoebe O'Hara (Schwarzenegger and Reed) have been brutally murdered, and there isn't a suspect in sight. They were loved in the town, and their enemies from 25 years ago have long since been extinguished, so motive is near impossible to fathom.

In comes Dolph Lundgren. Law enforcement (CIA, FBI, and of course, Astoria PD) are at their wits' end. He is their last hope. Their only hope. And he is going to get to the bottom of this... By starting at the bottom. The kindergarten class. As we all know, former detective John Kimble had excellent classroom management skills, and his students' behavior was always top-notch. And color outside the lines they did not. So it makes perfect sense that they should be able to point Dolph in the right direction.

What isn't shown in the trailer, is that there is more than meets the eye. And that is the side story of Dominic Palmieri (aka Cullen Crisp Jr). While he had the love and support of his mother and kindergarten teacher / step-father, he never fully adjusted from having to flee from the ""bad people"" during his early childhood development and also having basically watched his biological father and grandmother get murdered. It started off simple. First it was cigarettes, then looking for love from girls on the wrong side of the tracks. He became obsessed with the dichotomy of crime prevention as well as crime. At age 18 he disappeared into the military under an assumed identity, and wrote to his mother every year or so just to let her know he was ok.

Fast-forward a few years, and Dominic/Cullen is a trained killing machine. After leaving the military, he reunites with his former t-ball coach, Gus, who we all know was at minimum better than Mr. Kimble. Gus's past is as dark as Cullen Sr, but that is not the focal point of the film. All we know is that Dominic/Cullen goes to work for Gus as an assassin, yet still struggles with his own feelings of watching his own father and grandmother be killed at the hands of law enforcement. Eventually, he just breaks. In a calculated fit of rage, he returns to Astoria to seek vengeance on his father's murderers, who also happen to be his step-father and assumed Auntie.

Only by way of sheer fortitude and stick-to-itiveness is Dolph Lundgen able to deduce all of this information from a small group of 5/6 year olds. However, once the case is solved, Dominic/Cullen is nowhere to be found. It's very rare today that a movie ends without the satisfaction of closure. Perhaps the director was trying to make a statement about the current political landscape in a partisan America, or the fact that it's very confusing that whole milk is really only 4% milk. I mean what's the other 96%?

In my humble opinion, best movie I've seen... Possibly ever. And the best Dolph Lundgren performance since Dark Angel.",1455580800,7,3617,4.697160883280757
7669306,2,B01BTTAJ9C,Kindergarten Cop 2 is a direct to DVD video. Overall the movie was fine.  Had a couple cool action scenes.  Dry humor here and there and the story was okay. The villians weren't as menacing as the first one. The movie was fine but doesn't come close to being as awesome as the first one with Arnold Schwarzenegger.  The first one was the best and a classic.,1473292800,2,357,4.298507462686567

7669311,2,B01BTTAJ9C,"It wasn't nearly bad as I thought it would be and Dolph did an alright job.  However,  I watched this with my kids,  thinking we'd have another Kindergarten Cop film to add to our family collection.  However,  I don't think we will.  It was often filmed in a way both my kids and I found amusing but then, the next scene would be inappropriate close ups of women in tiny swim wear or skimpy clothes.  Think they should have went the family film route.. but, oh well.. we'll survive.",1468627200,,482,4.348314606741573
7669312,1,B01BTTAJ9C,Not as funny as Kindergarten Cop 1.,1466985600,,35,4.142857142857143
7669313,4,B01BTTAJ9C,Not Arnold but it is Dolph and that is almost as good. Once again and undercover agent is looking for information that can lead to the arrest of a drug lord and the only evidence has been left behind somewhere in an elementary  school by a teacher.  It has it's moments and is a good family movie.,1466812800,,297,4.192982456140351
7669314,3,B01BTTAJ9C,It was OK...but not the quality of the first one........Arnold had a better chemistry with the kids or the kids were a better mix....As a stand alone show it would have been ok.,1466812800,,177,4.393939393939394
7669315,1,B01BTTAJ9C,"This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen for 20 minutes.  We couldn't stand to watch it anymore. The acting was horrible. I know that Arnold isn't a great actor either, but at least he seems to know it and has fun with his bad acting. Also, he was surrounded by top class acting in the original.  Not so on either count here. Dolph Lundgren doesn't have the funny factor going for him.  He plays an older, always serious FBI agent (fact: in real-life Lundgren is past the mandatory retirement age for FBI agents) who goes undercover as, you got it, a kindergarten teacher.  The cute kindergarteners make the same cute comments as those in the original movie including the female genitalia comments.  At one point, when Lundgren is having his initial interview with the school principal (who is no Linda Hunt) a young female teacher sticks her head in the door to ask a question.  While Lundgren's old enough to be her father, I got the impression that a relationship was going to happen with the two of them and the idea grossed me out.  As I said, I didn't make it past 20 minutes so I hope that impression didn't play out.  This is just my two cents, but if you want a fun movie, go watch the original again and bypass this awful movie.",1466726400,,1247,4.391304347826087

7669321,4,B01BTTAJ9C,"I enjoyed Kindergarten Cop 2 with Dolph Lundgren very much. This is a fun entertaining movie. Having said that I do admit Im not sure who the intended audience is for this movie. There are shoot outs, fights and when we visit the bad guys home-we are treated to multiple shots of various women in teeny tiny bikinis oh and a roomful of little kids. This movie is not a sequel as others have suggested but rather a whole new adventure/slash remake of the original. If you're a fan of Dolph Lundgren then you should enjoy this movie. One can almost envision the Dad telling his wife, go out and relax have a girls night out, Ill take care of the kids in fact I have a movie we can watch.  But it was fun and enjoyable.",1465171200,5,716,4.226277372262774
7669322,4,B01BTTAJ9C,"This is one of the better efforts put out by Lundgren in a B movie.  If you are a fan of the original film with Arnold, then you know what up already. Of course its not as good as the original, even though Dolph does a pretty descent job recreating some of the original scenes that made the first movie great in the first place. Good soundtrack, and the supporting actors are all funnier then Lundgren so that helps. I found myself laughing more then expected, so what else can you ask for from a movie like this. I think Ahnold would give a nod of approval so do I. There are some Hand to hand and gunfights which are just good enough for this kind of movie, yeah they could of been better. But hey Lundgren isn't getting any younger, so he still gets credit. I think Lundgren should do more roles like this its suites him... anyways Check it out!",1464134400,4,848,4.234567901234568
7669323,3,B01BTTAJ9C,A witness protection list has been hacked an it is determined that a kindergarten class may know the location of the list. An FBI agent is sent in to get information for the children. he meets female teachers and a jealous janitor. Food and manors issues. A visit to a cowboy bar? Really?,1463961600,,288,4.452830188679245
7669324,2,B01BTTAJ9C,Should have left this movie alone. Dolph Lundgren is not good at being the main character. He needs to stay in the background for movies. This was just a copy cat of Kindergarten Cop #!. His boss was very annoying to listen to. Did not pull off being the police chief. It was like watching Cedic the entertainer. All I can say is poor acting and poor job of making a sequel.,1463961600,2,374,4.208333333333333
7669325,2,B01BTTAJ9C,"""They're children. I can handle this."" Agents Reed (Lundgren) and Sanders (Bellamy) are trying to find a stolen list of names. When the owner winds up dead they only have one lead, he was a teacher. With no other option Agent Reed goes under cover as a teacher in the school in hopes to find the list before more people wind up dead. The original is a borderline classic and is still funny and enjoyable to watch today. It was strange at first to see Schwarzenegger in a comedic role but his timing was great and it really worked. That's one thing this was lacking. This is really Lundgren's first real acting role, and he comes off as stiff and forced. The comic relief is left to Bill Bellamy and the supporting cast. The movie is watchable and entertaining enough but does nothing to add to the original and is a straight to video movie that should have been second guessed. Overall, watchable and entertaining but is nowhere close to being as good as the original. Another sequel that leaves you asking why this was made. I give it a C.",1463011200,3,1040,4.450261780104712

And, as we all know, Dolph Lundgren is NOT the best actor in the world - but I enjoyed the movie and honestly seeing Dolph line-dancing was hilarious for me.  Just this big Swedish man attempting to 'boot scoot and boogie' just tickled my funny bone.  Anyway, a great movie? No.  But it was fun and if you aren't expecting a lot and just want to watch it for the enjoyment of seeing it, you should pick it up.",1482710400,3,486,4.25
