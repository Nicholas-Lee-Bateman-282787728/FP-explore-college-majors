8039277,5,B00066N9W4,"Thank you, Sam Weber and Rusty Frank, for giving the tap world a fabulous, detailed and accurate representation of Eddie Brown's genius.  I highly recommend this DVD as a learning tool. Sam's first hand knowledge and understanding of Eddie Brown's material, combined with his ability to teach and explain the fine points of Eddie's rhythms, makes this DVD a must for every tap dancer interested in rhythm tap.",1208044800,,409,5.014705882352941
8039278,5,B00066N9W4,"I love this D.V.D I have only played it twice, and I am very excited about learning this routine. I am very impressed with the presentation of the dance. For those who need steps to be broken down, he does this, and then for those like me who neeed to see it done at tempo you get this as well. I loved the extra's, footage of Eddie Brown dancing is truly wondeful! You get a lot for your money with this D.V.D I would think that you would need to be an intermediate to advnce dancer for this one.",1129161600,3,497,4.03030303030303
8039279,5,B00066N9W4,"I bought this several years ago, it took a while to learn but it's my favorite routine. The tune Sam Weber uses is Tip Light, but I also like using Sunny Side of the Street by Steve Tyrell.",1126828800,,189,4.0
8039280,5,B00066N9W4,"This is one of the Best Instructional Tap tapes (read=DVD) that I've ever seen.  Well-taught, well-lit, great music, well-organized.  Eddie Brown is a Legend and the Eddie Brown Choruses are a Must Have.  Highly recommend. A+++++",1098489600,5,229,5.305555555555555
