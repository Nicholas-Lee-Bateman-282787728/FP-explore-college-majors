7833439,4,6302989531,"the amazon description is incorrect. this item has two episodes (total 42 minutes). the first is hampton, plucky, babs, and buster on the beach. they find a treasure map and go to an island where a mysterious bird lives. the second is a bit postmodern: babs and buster are dissatisfied w/ the episode (which is supposed to be hampton's solo), so the duo take it up w/ spielberg himself who makes them film an episode in hawaii written by three 8th graders. the 2nd episode has more of the other characters which makes it more fun. all in all some pretty funny stuff.",1140134400,,566,4.504854368932039
