8370403,4,B002HK4OXA,"Eventually, this work is a French approach to so popular in an Anglo-sphere applied psychology counselling is.

A practitioner of a money-milking edged-with-charlatanry-barely ""cure"" had awaken to a dead body of his patient - a sado-masochist sex-worker struggled by him unintentionally and unwittingly while himself falling in a trance uncontrolled during a ""medical"" session.

Everything is OK anyway as a police investigator was a mate of him and his own psychologist committed suicide and took a crime on himself.

A clever sarcastic work.",1355097600,2,543,5.518072289156627
8370404,3,B002HK4OXA,"Jean Jacques Beineix is one heck of a director. Exploding onto the scene with ""Diva."" Then following it up with the somewhat drugged out ""Moon in the Gutter,"" and following that up with ""Betty Blue"" made him the director to watch. So did he go brain dead or something?

Here's the scoop. Michel is a shrink with an odd female patient named Olga. She's a kleptomaniac/thief who gets sexually aroused by being beat by her rich, corrupt husband. She's stolen $8,000,000.00 from him and relates all the sordid details to Michel during her sessions. He falls asleep during one of these sessions and someone comes in and murders her. Certain circumstances make him feel he needs to lose the body instead of reporting it and therein lies the rub.

Beineix shows his usual exuberance and flare for the medium. It's a visual feast with good use of color and set. And the basic idea of the story is actually pretty cool, but he got really stupid with the script. Some of this is (I suppose) supposed to be black humor, but it veers way off into farce and slapstick. And while some of the plot points were forced, others were so sophomoric and hackneyed it amazed me that any director of his stature would not know enough of the history of film to use some of these gags. This is a real shame as, at times, there was a lot going on that kept me in the game.

I don't want to throw the baby out with the bathwater so I don't want to say don't see this flick if you're a true lover of film. Just be prepared to be frustrated at how good something could have been.",1354233600,4,1550,4.356401384083045
