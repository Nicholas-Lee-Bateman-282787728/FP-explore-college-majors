47639,4,0783211694,"When two New Mexico cowboys head for New York in search of a missing friend, East meets West with explosive results.  Kiefer Sutherland and Woody Harrelson star as two estranged team ropers who determine to teach a group of small-time gangsters that THE COWBOY WAY will win out every time. Dylan McDermot of THE PRACTICE plays the ruthless gangster who has all the answers the cowboys are looking for. The confrontation between Sutherland, Harrelson and McDermot is classic.

No, it's not LONESOME DOVE.  But THE COWBOY WAY is a dramedy that will keep you coming back.  Kiefer Sutherland, who is a roper on the side in real life, is especially convincing.",1091923200,2,655,4.873873873873874
47640,5,0783211694,"They come from New Mexico.  2 Ropin and Ridin Cowboys head for the Big Apple in an Action Adventure Comedy that will have your complete attention during the duration of the film.  Dylan McDermot of ""The Practice"" plays a very convincing bad guy in a suave manner.  There are great moments when the Cowboy meets the big city including a great moment when the two main characters go dining in a fine New York resturant.  They don't completely stick out like a sore thumb though, and New York seems to speed right by them with no glance what so ever.
The movie brings up thoughts of wanting to do some line dancing and some ""shiver shots"".  Don't know what that is?  You'll see.",1053561600,4,675,4.4471544715447155
47641,5,0783211694,"I have little use for Woddy Harrelson, himself as a person, but he and Keifer Sutherland have a profound on-screen chemistry that made this movie one great escape from Real Life.  I wish there would be a sequel.",964310400,4,211,4.552631578947368
47642,5,0783211694,This is by far my favorite movie. It's about 2 team roping buddies that broke off the team a year earlier. They then set off to help their cuban friend find his daughter right in the heart of New York city.,957398400,3,206,4.048780487804878
47643,3,0783211694,"I have only recently viewed this movie.  Why did I wait so long?  It was very funny, and very entertaining.  I would watch it again and again. I read Leonard Maltin's review of the movie. In it he says something about it  being ""unrealistic"".  Well, duh, it's just a movie. So just  relax.  It can be unrealistic if it wants to be.",954892800,3,331,4.241935483870968
47644,5,0783211694,this is a great movie. I thouhgt it was funny. with the pairing of the patient sonny with the fast riding pepper. it is funny watching them try to save a cuban girl while trying to put up with each other,947030400,4,203,3.975609756097561
47645,5,0783211694,"Do you like a tried and true format like the American Western with some interesting twists for the changing times, and two really likeable cow pokes in the big bad city where they, of course, take it by the tail and  rope it?
Hey,this is a funny, funny and totally enjoyable treatment of  the genre and you're in the right place for an excellent modern cowboy  story. How can you help but love a cowboy? The story  and acting are  superior without the touch of snobbery from taking yourself too seriously.  Ride this one right to the end for great laughs and imaginative  situations.
This movie also proves you don't need much of anything  gratutious to make it enjoyable for the younger set and the ancient ones,  like myself...",944006400,6,729,4.589147286821706

47690,3,0783211694,This is a pretty good movie.  Woody Harrelson and Kiefer Sutherland play two rodeo cowboys who go to New York City to help  a friend find his missing daughter.

47797,5,0783211694,"Laughs, action, and good 'ole fashioned fun on this wild wide... Woody Harrelson and Kiefer Sutherland bring on the fun as two rough ridin' rodeo cowboys from New Mexico who grew up as best friends but had an argument over a year ago when Pepper (Harrelson) didn't show up as Sonny's (Sutherland) partner at an important championship rodeo. Straight from the get go, you can tell that a year of silent treatment will not break up this friendship though - they are like family. Comic scenes of Harrelson playing Big Chief keep us busy until Sutherland announces that he's off to the big city, New York, to look for Nacho - the kind Cuban cowboy who lives with him at the ranch. Apparently, Nacho has been paying some (we later learn) slimy garment district slave trader in the fashion industry to get his daughter to the USA from Cuba.

Dylan McDermott is great as the power hungry scumbag who ends up killing poor Nacho for $5000 and takes the daughter on as his personal plaything. Harrison and Sutherland saddle up and hop in the truck making the cross country drive to New York City. That's where the non-stop laughs begin and hilarity ensues. From how they try to get a room, to ordering dinner, to attending a fashion party and riding with a NY City cop (Ernie Hudson) whose dream is to be like Willie M. ""Bill"" Pickett, a black and native American cowboy, rodeo, and Wild West show performer from the early 1900's.

Will they save the girl? Will they make up and be friends again? Will the New York city cowboys ride again? Brilliantly shot with some awesome scenes (roasting a pigeon on a spit over a campfire in Central Park, riding horses on the Brooklyn Bridge, an 'intimate' encounter at the city zoo, an Andy Warhol style party and a Calvin Klein ad you won't soon forget), this is a film that will take you away from any stress or problems and will entertain you and keep you on the edge of your seat and laughing. This is what movies are supposed to do - entertain. Yippie ki-yay!",1439942400,,1994,4.520775623268698

Every thing goes wrong that can go wrong.  The two cowboys are out to get the guys and find the girl. It's action all the way,
Woody Harrelson is really a hoot, Keifer is the serious one, he is trying to keep Harrelson in check with no luck. They get shot
at, beat up, eat in the fanciest hotel in New York (without money) now that gets interesting. They ride through New York on horse back chasing the bad guy (Dylan McDermond) and he is one mean person.  The ending is so cool.  Harrelson has money and he won't tell Keifer how he got it.  As they are leaving new york, there is a Giant bill board, that will tell you where he got the money.

It's got the cheesy clothes, haircuts, and one-liners of the 90's, but I like the fish out of water story. I live in the country but close to the city, and I can recognize some of the awkwardness Sonny and Pepper experience in this film. The last few scenes are classics, and some are poorly shot, but it reminds me of the 90's and it's just a unique comedy.",1394236800,,489,4.0

47958,5,0783211694,"This may very well be my favorite Woody Harrelson movie . He plays a rodeo cowboy . He is paired up with Keifer Sutherland . Also a rodeo cowboy . The two grew up together and it seemed as though everytime Pepper (thats Harrelson's characters name) - would get into any trouble , Sonny ( Sutherlands) would bail him out . Seems as though things never change . Pepper is in debt - could care less of who he may be sleeping with (married or not) and just an all out 'I'll fight anyone at any time' type personality . But funny as hell !!!! And thank the Lord that Sonny is always there (even though he does not want to) to help him out .-- Well a very close friend of theirs (Nacho) had to leave New Mexico , and head to New York City , to find his daughter ( who had left Cuba illegally ) and is being held (basically) for ransom . By the way , the bad guy holding her is portrayed by Dylan McDermott- very well. When Sonny finds out that Nacho was heading to New York , he did not like the sound of it at all , and decided to go track him down.  And sure enough , Pepper said ""well - Nacho is my friend too !! So I'm going with you )""!! Now the excitement - action begins . Pepper and Sonny are going to do anything there is to find him . Remember-- They are rodeo cowboys . And a rodeo cowboy,to me, are the most daring- fearless men in sports . Think about it ! When it comes to saddle bronc riding or bull riding - It's not ""Am I going to get hurt""? -But more like -""how bad am I going to get hurt""?! So with that kind of mentality ,their fearless-but careful determination , the two go on their quest to find their friend and his daughter . Let the action begin !! ---- P.S.-- This film was released back in 1994 I believe . And why it has taken me sooo long to watch it is beyond me ! -- Anyway--There was an article that I had read, a long time ago,that said something like "" Keifer Sutherland liked performing in the film 'Cowboy Way' so much , that soon after ,decided to rodeo in real life "". And I believe he is still living that lifestyle today ( more ranchin' than anything nowadays ).",1389398400,2,2097,3.992857142857143

The man's daughter had previously vanished having been kidnapped by a gang using the sweated labour of illegal immigrants  and kidnap victims .The plot revolves around their attempts to locate their friend and his daughter and there is a sub-plot about the attempts of one of the gang members(played by Dylan McDermott)to take over the leadership of the gang from the present incumbent -and being none too scrupulous as to methodology.

The comedy of the movie arises from incongruity -cowboys in a Latino bar ,trains being chased by horse riding cowboys and a Black New York cop with aspirations to live the cowboy lifestyle .The movie is a juxtaposition of ""sophisticated""urban ways cheek by jowl with outsiders with an altogether more innocent ,naive and trusting view of the world ands who prove more than a match for the urbanites in many ways

Sutherland and Harrelson are fine and make a good pairing and help make the movie eminently watchable .The subject was better -and more soberly -treated in Coogan's Bluff but in its own  cartoonish and broad way this is an energetic and watchable time passer",1204156800,4,1414,4.949367088607595
48070,4,0783211694,"To put it straight and simple, COWBOY WAY is a fun filled couple of hours with some real men tearing up New York City.

Sonny (Kiefer Sutherland) and Pepper (Woody Harrelson) are a couple of New Mexico cowpokes looking for their friend Nacho, after he up and left to get his daughter out a New York sweatshop.  When the cowboys find out that Nacho's been killed by the lowlife (Dylan McDermott) running a racket smuggling young girls like Nacho's daughter into the US to work as slave labor in his rag factories, they're ready to open up an econo-sized can of whupass on the dude, his crew and anybody else who gets in their way.

Sutherland plays it level-headed and cool to Harrelson's hilarious cocky redneck in the big city, and together they make a fine pair.

Highlights in this movie include Harrelson wearing Sutherland's ears out during the ride to New York.  The scene with them ordering dinner at a five-star hotel will also leave many of you fellas rolling on the floor with laughter.  Nothing, however, beats the scene with Harrelson showing up at a fashionista soiree, encountering high end floozies and a couple of Euroqueen designers cruising to get him out of his longjohns.

Considering that the saw's of torture porn continue buzzing away in dank and dismal hostels, while we are treated to yet another cinematic rendition of redacted defeatism playing out in the Valley of Elah, I've been appreciating my DVD player and movies like the COWBOY WAY here lately.  What's more, here's an idea for a sequel to this movie that I'm offering to  Hollywood free of charge, something that also fits into its fixation for politcal messages and its self-delusion of being duty bound to preach to the masses as well:

--Sonny and Pepper find out that their friend Ibrahim, who runs a string of concession stands selling falafel and kebabs on the rodeo circuit, has gone off in search of his son Omar, who he believes was absconded by the CIA to Egypt.  After following their buddy to Cairo, the good ol' boys kick up some sand in between checking out the national bellydance championship finals.

(Now don't that sound nice?)",1203811200,19,2132,4.747967479674797
48071,5,0783211694,"This movie arrived in the promised condition, played well and was as entertaining as we hoped.  Product arrived in timely manner.  Thanks!",1188864000,,138,5.2272727272727275
48072,4,0783211694,"Professional reviewers have savaged this movie, but I think their attitude is a bit harsh.

Yes, the plot has been done before.  Yes, the humor is a bit forced in spots.  Yes, there is a cringe-worthy torture scene involving a calf.  Yes, the villain is a one-dimensional cardboard character.

But, the world will never tire of ""buddy"" movies, or fish-out-of-water plots.  Screwball redneck humor isn't going anywhere either.  And if we must have a one-dimensional villain, at least he's dreamy Dylan McDermott.

""The Cowboy Way"" won't win any Oscars, but it doesn't aspire to; it was meant as light entertainment, and it *is* surprisingly entertaining.

Woody Harrelson is ""Pepper"", the comic half of the duo, and he has a certain brash charm which actually is amusing to watch.  Kiefer Sutherland plays ""Sonny"", the deadpan half of the pair, and his serious nature is an effective foil to Harrelson's excesses.  Their characters are believable, even if the plot strains credibility at times.  Sutherland has a memorable moment during a scene that takes place in a morgue after the death of a minor character; the simple grace and dignity of his farewell gesture reveal he has inherited at least some of the great subtlety and power of his father, the magnificent actor Donald Sutherland.

Their adventures in New York, searching for a lost friend and attempting to rescue a kidnapped daughter from slavery, take a few detours along the way.  The pair quarrel, seperate, and Pepper meets some interesting New Yorkers while Sonny gets in serious trouble, but they reunite just in time to kick some bad guy butt with the help of some of New York's finest.

The bad guy is dispensed with in a rather creative, if cruel fashion, romance blossoms between Sonny and the female lead and they all drive off into the sunset in their pickup truck.

I'm neither a big fan of things cowboy, nor particularly of any of the actors involved, and from the reviews I was not expecting much of this movie, but it was worth a few chuckles.  I can think of worse ways of spending an afternoon than watching this.  I gave it four stars partly to make up for the harsh reviews it has gotten from others though I think it really deserves three.  If you are sick of overhyped, straining-for-Oscar movies and want a mildly enjoyable, unpretentious bit of entertainment, this little sleeper may be perfect for you.",1177891200,5,2389,4.825552825552825

48074,3,0783211694,"Not the greatest rodeo movie ever made but by no means the worst.

Tends to drag on a little but overall is worth the effort. Some of the casting is strange mainly because there is no chemistry between the characters, but the storyline is above average and Keifer Sutherland does enough to carry the rest over the line.",1154563200,3,319,4.5
48075,2,0783211694,"I guess it's still true (to some degree anyway) that being a MOVIE STAR has more, uh, cachet to it than being a TV actor.  But sometimes you have to wonder why.  Watching this mediocre-at-best 1994 effort featuring former TV star Woody Harrelson, future TV leads Kiefer Sutherland and Dylan McDermott, you just might wonder why that's the case.  These actors can all be justifiably proud of their work on (respectively) CHEERS, 24, and THE PRACTICE.  I can't imagine that they bring up this film much in conversation as being one of the highlights of their careers.

Which is not to say that they don't all give it their best shot.  As our cowboys-loosed-in-the-Big-Apple heroes, Sutherland and Harrelson are affable enough.  And it's interesting to see McDermott take on a menacing villain's role.  But otherwise, this movie is pretty predictable ""fish out of water"" fare.  And speaking of TV shows, didn't Dennis Weaver pretty much mine all the possibilities of out of that particular plotline decades ago on McCLOUD?

Of course, McCloud never resorted to such grotesqueries as we witness in the ""hungry calf"" scene.  Even in the new millennium, television seldom stoops quite THAT low. The filmmakers must have been getting a little desperate at that point.  I believe this is what's known as ""jumping the shark.""  Or some variation on that phrase involving a ""calf.""  One shudders to think.",1149984000,3,1394,4.978354978354979
48076,5,0783211694,"The film brings to the screen the story of two cowboys out of New Mexico who come to NY looking for their friend who's gone missing while searching for his daughter.

It is a highly entertaining, action-packed adventure with significant elements of comedy.  To a certain extent it brings to mind Next of Kin starring Patrick Swayze.

Woody Harrelson, Kiefer Sutherland, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least.  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)!

The plot, the setting, the dialogues, and the music, are all WONDERFUL!

The Cowboy Way is a movie definitely worth watching, and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!",1113523200,3,783,5.0310077519379846
48077,4,0783211694,"It's rather more violent than ""Crocodile Dundee"" or Tom Selleck's early effort ""Concrete Cowboys,"" but ""The Cowboy Way"" reminds me of both.  Once again, the chief thrust is incongruity--the country boys in the Big City, coping with its traps and perils in their own distinct style.  And while I'm not a fan of either Harrelson (who plays the womanizing Pepper Lewis) or Sutherland (his steadier, more focused lifetime buddy Sonny Gilstrap), I enjoyed the way they brought their characters to life.  What's more, there's an element of inter-hero conflict in the bitter estrangement that has stood between them ever since Pepper failed to show up for a regional event and they had to forfeit their chance at the prize money that would have been ""a down payment on [Sonny's] ranch.""  Besides a very nasty villain and a more avuncular, almost sympathetic one (who is ultimately shot by his young protege), the peripheral characters include the black mounted cop Sam, who plays a major part in the resolution of the case.  The scriptwriters reveal the depths of the two protagonists gradually and skilfully, culminating in Pepper's unexpectedly creative means of ransoming the treasured New Mexico State Champion buckle Sonny has pawned to arm them.  This is ultimately a story about friendship, loyalty, forgiveness, and courage, and as such it appeals on a very basic level.  It may never be called a ""classic,"" but it's definitely worth a look.",1098748800,7,1442,5.059071729957806
