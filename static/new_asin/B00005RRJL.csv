1657733,5,B00005RRJL,"This is a tremendously funny, original film made by some very talented people. It's also a great example of how independent movies made on a shoestring budget by people who just love doing it are far more engaging and hilarious than big, bloated Hollywood blockbusters. A good plot summary is on the official Website ..., but you really don't need that -- just go rent ... or buy this movie. And if you can, see ""Cow Monkey,"" the second film by and starring the same people who made this one. I saw it recently at the Seattle Underground Film Festival and it's a fantastic and very funny follow-up to ""Fishing with Ghandi.""",1008028800,5,623,4.571428571428571

Danno, grappling with complex issues of identity and purpose, runs headlong into simplicity and meaningless clarity in the form of two redneck brothers who give him a ride in a broken down truck.  His deep thoughts about the meaning of life are contrasted masterfully by Roy and Gil, who don't seem to worry much about anything.  Their lives are infinitely worse than Danno's, but they are oblivious to this and obviously happy.  He slowly comes to realize that he is taking himself too seriously.

Anyhow, the Roy & Gil characters are great.  I think Dax Shepard stole Roy's look, voice, and mannerisms for Frito Pendejo in Idiocracy, which should give you an idea whether or not you'll find this funny.  Personally, I think it's great, the deadpan stupidity is priceless, and really reminds you of some of the odder people you've met...

The rest of the characters are a bit hit and miss, though it's fun from a historical perspective to remember a time when slackers were living in San Francisco (Pac Heights, I think?).",1472083200,2,701,4.620967741935484

Meanwhile Danno's roommates, the very sensitive Giles and Stephen await his return from his mom's wedding, worried about their friend's state of mind.  All in all the trip seems to have done some good for Danno.  And as he leaves the brothers, says that he is sorry he was so quiet at the beginning and  that travel makes him a little moody and ponderous.

No big name actors, no chase scenes, no CGI, there really isn't even much of a story here.
All you have are a handful of moronic characters saying things that are so stupid that you are
forced to laugh, and then they say something even dumber and you laugh harder.

Several of my friends have bought copies of their own (or flagrantly stole mine).  I have (so far) bought 4 copies to replace loaned copies that got ""lost"" or re-loaned.

This movie is gloriously funny.  It's indescribable and anything I say about it will be off the mark.  Just do yourself a favor and buy a copy.

1657791,5,B00005RRJL,"""Fishing With Gandhi"" is one of the most amazing films I have ever seen. This low budget wonder follows the adventures of Danno, a troubled hitchhiker, and his road trip with perpetual slackers Roy and Gil. Significant plot point revolve around badminton, puppy diseases, and wrestling moves such as the ""Brazilian Guillotine"" and ""Fishing With Gandhi,"" which Roy and Gil demonstrate with aplomb to hapless Danno.

Believe it or not this film harkens back to ""Hamlet"", in that Danno is upset that his uncle has taken advantage of his father's recent (possibly suspicious?) death and married his mother, while Roy and Gil are near perfect Rosencrantz and Guildenstern analogs. I know this sounds insane, but I didn't make it up: I found it out from the director's commentary. After I thought about what was said, re-watched the film, and skimmed my copy of ""Hamlet"", I had no choice but to agree, which added dramatically to the deliciously subtle humor of the film for me.

The cast is letter perfect and small details are done extremely well: I was especially amused by Christina Milano's portrayal of ""Bronte"", the weird Ophelia of the film who becomes seemingly more demented (as in ""Hamlet"") as the movie goes on. I especially love her scene where she breaks down into hysterics on recalling a nature documentary in which a water buffalo crosses an alligator infested river. She says that she needs to ""helicopter"" above the pain. Her companion responds ""Can you talk from the helicopter?"" Her answer, of course, is ""Sure, I'm hovering above the pain right now."" Which elicits from her companion the considerate, yet hilarious, line ""Do you want to hover by yourself for a while?"" Nuanced dialogue like this peppers the film, and makes it an absolute treat to watch in comparison to over-promoted Hollywood productions.

The DVD has a lot of extra features including a wonderful commentary track, extensive outtakes, a director's introduction (which I loved), the theatrical trailer, and a wonderful animated short featuring Roy and Gil in the psychiatrist's office. Their description to the psychiatrist of the medications they are currently taking is priceless.

This movie has a lot of subtlety to it, and is viewable on a number of levels. I recommend watching it as a straight comedy first, then watch for increasing nuance with further viewings. It is truly a film like no other, and I recommend it highly. If you can, try to find a copy of the even rarer Roy and Gil movie, ""Cow Monkey"", in which they pursue bigfoot.

""Fishing With Gandhi"" isn't for everyone, but for the people it's intended for it is a wonderful experience.",1199059200,8,2638,4.945823927765237
1657792,5,B00005RRJL,"Very funny pair of brothers, very very funny. The movie holds up even when the Reichmuth Brothers are not on screen, but it really takes off when they are on screen, eating corndogs and talking about Catahoula Leopard Dogs.",1175126400,,223,4.743589743589744

1657794,5,B00005RRJL,"Apparently none of the other reviewers realized this so far, but this is actually a retelling of Hamlet. No kidding! And the most creative warping of a Shakespeare story I've ever seen, by far. I mean, that Romeo and Juliet with De Caprio was just set in modern times. Scotland PA was that as well as being quite a bit weirder. But this, this is Hamlet twisted with something else entirely, and it's sheer genius. I have reviewed a few things, many of them 5 stars, but I only went out of the way to write reviews for the movies I really liked or found something really detestible about, or otherwise was somehow impressed by (or found the other reviews to be flagrantly lacking or downright wrong), so I do not take this 5 star rating lightly and would apply it to a very small percentage if I were to review everything I've ever seen.

Roy and Gil (Reichmuth twins) do such an excellent job at submersing themselves in the world of white trash it seems like actual footage instead of a movie, and the part of Chris Kuldoon (sweet, cool...)was a wonderful addition.

1657800,5,B00005RRJL,"""Fishing with Gandhi"" was part of a series of indie films exclusively released by one of the major chain video stores. Lucky for me I wasn't as jaded about this type of indie series as I am now.  The movie's centerpoint is the relationship and dialogue of twin brothers Roy and Gill.  The brothers are the masterful creation of James and John Reichmuth.  Roy and Gill, at first glance, are the typical lampoons of inbred Northwestern rednecks, but as the movie progresses they transcend that stereotype.  Their dialogue, which was largely improvised during the shooting, sparkles with hilarious discussions of puppy disease, their family history, and their philosophical meanderings about insanity and truck-driving.  Lest you think the director and writers were not being even-handed, other characters such as the hipster (and decidedly non blue-collar) roommates Stephen and Giles are also hilariously deconstructed.  The film even tosses in a hippie for our enjoyment.  Even peripheral characters such as super-extracurricular man and ""hovering-above-the-pain"" spoiled princess-girl are right on target.
It is the development of these characters and the dialogue-driven nature of the plot that make this film so excrutiatingly funny.  Don't expect a lot of physical humor or tired stoner quips- this is a movie that requires your full attention to appreciate.  It's the kind of movie where you notice something new each time you watch it.  It is also the sort of movie that you are going to want to share with each and every one of your friends.  And if you do expose them to it, don't be surprised if you share a private language with your friends based upon quotes from the movie.
The DVD version comes with an animated Roy and Gill short, extensive (and enlightening) outtakes, and a full-length commentary with four of the filmmakers- including the Reichmuth twins IN CHARACTER.  This is great because ""Fishing with Gandhi"" definitely leaves you wanting more of Roy and Gill.",1028419200,7,1982,5.159375
1657801,3,B00005RRJL,"This is a film that almost defies description; and it really has to be seen to be appreciated.  It's a page out of real life, a portrait of Americana which, like life, is best when experienced first hand.  It's ""Fishing With Gandhi,"" a biting bit of satire written by William Birdthistle, James Reichmuth, John Reichmuth and Gabe Weisert, and directed by Gabe Weisert.  It's a film that grabs you by the ears and demands attention; about ten minutes into it, you get the feeling that you're sitting in a bar, eavesdropping on the conversation of the guys at the next table.  And it's the kind of stuff you've heard every day of your life if you've ventured out your own front door for any period of time, especially in certain quarters of society, like maybe a place called the ""Silver Dollar Saloon"" or ""The Roadhouse Bar and Grill.""  Because these are regular folks, engaged in the kind of inane prattle that make up a good part of the conversations you're likely to hear in the above mentioned venues, or if you've ever worked in such places as a warehouse, on the dock at the post office, at a concrete factory or in a quarry.  But you also get a taste of the flip side of that coin-- and which you find is not all that different-- in those involved with the likes of Investment Banking or simply cultivating a garden.
 The story, such as it is, follows Danno (Dan Klein), who is hitchhiking from Seattle (where his mother has just married his uncle) to his home somewhere in California.  When he hits Oregon, he scores a ride with Gil (John Reichmuth) and Roy (James Reichmuth), two good ol' boys with a pickup truck that breaks down every few miles, which is okay, because it gives them time to talk.  Meanwhile, waiting for Danno at home are his roommates, Giles (William Birdthistle) and Stephen (Gabe Weisert), who, thinking Danno is probably on a real downer because of the Seattle thing, plan to cheer him up by throwing a pot luck for him upon his return, complete with streamers, which will give it all a festive look.  Now, if only any of them had some friends to invite.  And, more importantly, if they only knew when, exactly, Danno would be arriving.  It's a complicated time for Giles and Stephen, who so want to do the right thing, while unbeknownst to them Danno is involved with two of the most uncomplicated guys you'll ever run into-- and from whom he'll learn much before he gets home, including what Gil and Roy refer to as the ""Fishing With Gandhi.""
 The portrayals of Gil and Roy are so authentic it's almost frightening; and whether you live in Oregon, or Iowa, or Texas or just about anywhere else, the chances are pretty good that you know these guys, or at least know someone who lives next door to them.  And as they speak their little philosophies about things like diseases you can pick up from dogs, how many different ways you can die in your sleep (152) or what the best wrestling moves are (complete with a demonstration), you slowly begin to realize that if Beavis and Butthead were real and grown up, they would be Gil and Roy.  Think about it.  Ever known anyone who lived for that next bottle of beer and never had a conversation that didn't include something about Steelhead fishing or gutting an animal?  Well, come on over and spend some time on the road with Gil and Roy.  By the way, truck driving IS serious business.  Just ask Roy; he's the one who flunked out of truckers school.
 Switching gears, Weisert cuts to Giles and Stephen, men of a more refined palate, but whom (as we also quickly discern) do not have a clue.  About anything.  How the world works, how to conduct themselves socially, how to throw a pot luck.  So there's two facets of society represented here, either/or to which you will be able to relate, or at least be able to identify.  And the way Weisert puts you in the room-- or in the truck-- with these guys, it's like he picked them out, set the camera up in their proximity and just let it roll.  it's banal, it's boring-- and it's hysterically real.  If you try to analyze it, there's nothing here of real interest, and yet this film is absolutely engrossing; a true character study filled with insights into human nature that are bound to cause some reflection on the part of even the most jaded viewer.  ""Fishing With Gandhi"" is that kind of film.  It takes you down the road and says, ""Here it is, brother,"" for better or worse, take it or leave it.  It's unique; it's an oddity; it's quirky; and it's definitely not for everyone.  But for those who are ready for something completely different and want a challenge and some laughs, this one's worth checking out.  It's all a part of the magic of the movies.",1013644800,4,4687,4.504728132387707

1657803,5,B00005RRJL,"If you're reading this review, at least you've found one of the funnier titles that are available on DVD (I realize how big of a compliment that is).
While there is a plot to the film, that's not as big of an element of interest as is the character development and dialogue. The plot involves two sets of people tied together by the protagonist. Our hero is a guy who seems to be a calming influence in whatever situation he finds himself. For most of the film, he is hitchhiking back to Seattle with some identical twins. This plotline serves up some of the most hilarious moments of the film, including the title line (which you have to wait 'til the end for, but it's well worth it).
Much of the dialogue seems to be improvised, though probably does follow some basic form. There are also amusing moments where it seems that one of the actor's impromptu lines send the other cast members into real-life laughter. What would be an outtake in a Hollywood film remains in this low-budget project, but it's cool when the audience can see into the film a little deeper than just the surface (at least I like the realness of seeing them laugh spontaneously and slightly out of character).
The other subplot involves the hitchhiker's roomates and friends. Most of these folks are highly neurotic and badly in need of the balanced domestic situation normally provided by their absent roomie. There are some great characters here, including the really perky workout guy that's really annoying and you invite to parties because you feel obligated to, and also the pseudo-intellectual, quirky chic who has spent too much time in grad school and not enough time actually living life.
If you're like me, you'll spend a lot of time laughing at this film. Don't expect Hollywood polish by any means, but that's one of the charming things about _Fishing_With_Ghandi_.",1011225600,3,1854,4.760869565217392
7952648,3,B00005RRJL,"As plots go its was fairly non-existent. Some clever scripting at times and some great characters created by the 2 traveling brothers. I would be happy to find out that their lines were improvised during the shoot. The 2 apartment dwelling hipsters waiting for the return of their roommate were painfully droll, however there were a few existential lines thrown out from time to time that sort of made up for the general pall of 20th century angst presented to the viewer. Technical production far outweighed a meaningless story. But still fun. Maybe it makes more of an impact if the viewer is stoned.",1486252800,,602,4.798076923076923
