7373800,1,B013W7LR8G,"This is a silly film by a guy who after coming out decided to adopt the mannerisms of a  subculture of out-men in his milieu and then made a film trying to imbue his  newly found affectations with other than cultural causality. And sadly  he got away with it.  Maybe equally silly films with titles like ""Do I sound working class?"",  ""Do I sound inner city ghetto?"", ""Do I sound Brooklyn?""  will soon come out.  While I don't deny that many gay men sound ""gay"" (read effeminate), perhaps the result of socializing mostly with girls, it is not the case that gay men in general have to sound  ""gay"" (effeminate).  Usually ""gay sounding"" men either hangout with very effeminate men or mostly hang out with women, and enjoy imitating their mannerisms and intonations. And of course that is not wrong in it of itself; in fact, many young straight men in large cosmopolitan areas have also begun to import girly affectations and intonations into their general portage and speech.  What is wrong is trying to make ordinary gay men who sound just like ordinary guys feel that they are somehow not gay because they have not imported the affectations of campy out-gay men into their mannerisms and speech.

Don't waste your time with this stupid film.",1472428800,,1241,4.699074074074074

7373803,2,B013W7LR8G,"Parts of this were so interesting-- particularly the historical information. I hadn't thought about the cartoon villains of my childhood (Jafar, Scar) being effeminate speakers, but I will certainly have to watch them again now!

Unfortunately, the historic and linguistic parts make up a small section of this movie. It is mostly a biography of the narrator's early life, coming-out, and adjustment to gay culture.  At the end he more or less decides that his voice is fine as-is, but otherwise there isn't much growth or plot to his story.

I wanted to love this movie, but it disappointed me.",1464998400,3,595,4.93
7373804,5,B013W7LR8G,"I had heard David Thorpe on This American Life enough that it was interesting to see what he looked like. I was amazed to learn he was from the south--his voice had me convinced he grew up in the shadow of an Ivy League institution and definitely north of the Mason-Dixon Line.

I had hoped that ""Do I Sound Gay"" would answer the question ""why?"". It doesn't accomplish that, but it goes to some interesting places about gay culture, gay people in the media, and the American quest to be someone we aren't. In the end, it's best to be who who are. At the end of the day (has anyone had enough of that phrase?) you want to be in your friends' kitchen with a glass of wine yukking it up. Those sequences looked so very comfortable.

I didn't see nearly enough of Rocket and the other kitty, but I was delighted that their names were disclosed and that their existence was acknowledged by the author.

Thank you kindly, Mr. Thorpe.",1463961600,,927,4.377906976744186
7373805,4,B013W7LR8G,"A straight woman, I enjoyed this documentary. It's failure is that it tries to be two things. One a narrative about the director /star's struggle with his own ""gay voice."" The other part of the documentary is an analysis of what the gay male voice in America is, linguistically. These topics don't mesh superbly well, but I found the former touching and the latterr interesting.

Unlike another reviewer, I wasn't upset in the least at the short clips of gay porn, and they were there to prove a point about the erotic qualities of the hypermasculine voice. (And their pornishness was amusing, as it so often is when one watches porn out of context.)

What was upsetting was the video clip of a gay-voiced teen being beaten in a classroom while no one intervenes. What a world...

(Dan Savage being gay is upsetting in a less serious sense, in that ""what a shame"" sense we straight women know about. ;) )

Spoiler alert: the director learns that to not love his gay voice is wrapped up in his ambiguous feelings about being gay, the last vestige of internalized homophobia he totes around.",1458086400,,1089,4.65625
7373806,5,B013W7LR8G,"This is such an amazing documentary. very eye opening. Great production quality. The main guy is so sweet, charming, and funny.",1457654400,,127,5.095238095238095

7373808,1,B013W7LR8G,I guess I should have read the description a little better.  I was expecting this dvd to actually be ENTERTAINING.  Instead it was a sob story/pity party about a queen who wants to sound butch.  Really???  Not going to happen.  Buyer beware......this video is not at all entertaining.,1456704000,,284,4.833333333333333

7373811,4,B013W7LR8G,"I was hoping this was a simple documentary looking into linguistics, etc., but it actually seemed more like David Thorpe's personal story. I wish it had shown more time with the vocal coach or with other linguistic professionals, those sections of the film were the most interesting; they addressed the issue as almost a simple ""accent"" that has specific identifiers (the sibilant S, the singsong pattern, extended vowel sounds, etc.).

Quite a lot of the film focused on Thorpe's own story, past and present, and I don't think those scenes really contributed that much to the theme of exploring the what/why/who of the gay voice. There is a very interesting section where they review the gay accent in films and TV: you'll see obvious comedic favorites in these clips (Paul Lynde, Liberace, Charles Nelson Reilly), but also others you might have missed, including a slew of animated Disney villains. Celebrities and regular guys are presented as examples where there is crossover: gay men who sound straight, straight men who sound gay.

Bottom line, the ""gay voice"" is really nothing more than an accent, and just like other accents it depends on where you were brought up, who you were around, how they spoke, and so on---and it can be learned/unlearned just like other accents if you desire. I'd love to see this topic explored in more depth, in a pure-documentary style of film.",1453593600,6,1383,4.931330472103005
7373812,5,B013W7LR8G,"An interesting movie based upon an interesting quest, to understand one's self.",1453248000,2,79,5.666666666666667
7373813,4,B013W7LR8G,"In order to get it out of the way I should first begin with a declaration. David Thorpe is a distant relative which is how I got directed to Do I Sound Gay? The film, by the first-time director, premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival as part of its Mavericks program. It was scheduled for the coveted first weekend which is indicative of TIFF's high opinion of the feature. The film was funded via a Kickstarter campaign as recently as this spring.

Following a break-up with his boyfriend, David Thorpe loses some self-confidence, which translates into worrying more about sounding gay. Was this one of the causes of the breakup? We do not know. In the course of some ninety minutes he recruits voice coaches, linguists, class-mates, celebrities, family and even gay passers-by to both explore the topic and perhaps find assurance and solace in the experience of others. The film is half autobiography half documentary. It explores the gay vocal sound in the context of society in general and the entertainment industry in particular.

Incidentally, as far as documentaries go Do I Sound Gay? is more Roger & Me and less The Grace Lee Project. The director is on camera for most of the film as opposed to behind it.

The subject matter is clearly more upsetting to the writer-director than he cares to explicitly admit. This is inferred amidst the abundant comedy, jovial remarks and celebrity interviews. Nevertheless, there are quite a few moments of hilarity and laugh-out-loud scenes peppered throughout the film. One sees Thorpe's cats, Bruno (oh, come on!) and Rocket, Hello Kitty merchandise in his apartment and stereotyped gay humour displayed. Then there are classic Hollywood vignettes depicted as not so subtle gay scenes. Family members and old friends recall a young David and their impressions before we find out that Thorpe had a liberating coming out during his first year of college. There are many funny or heartwarming bits; alas by necessity serious instances are also present as with the teenager who was bullied and beaten up at school for sounding and being gay.

As mentioned the subject matter was prompted following a breakup with a boyfriend, but does the film provide for a seamless or convincing segue from this point unto the theme's exploration? Not really, as the subject takes a valid and independent life of its own. The breakup and the boyfriend may be personally relevant to the film maker, but not so content or audience-wise. How it translates to attention to the gay voice is personal to the man. Being single and alone in his 40s manifests as piling onto an existing feeling of inferiority. With the opening assumption being the notion that a ""gay voice"" is negative and contributes to the existing self-conscious nature of the man, Thorpe begins meeting with and practicing with coaches and recordings to become less gay sounding identified as accentuated s's, higher pitches, elongated enunciations, et cetra. At some point one coach offers that leaders go high with the first syllable of a word before dropping lower. Thorpe is seen exercising his voice throughout the film all the while discussing the same with the aforementioned. Speaking of which, celebrities such as comedienne Margaret Cho, CNN reporter and anchor Don Lemon, columnist Dan Savage and actor-cum-activist George Takei are several of the names on camera. In the subsequent Q&A at the premiere someone wondered if there were gay celebrities who were contacted and did not respond. CNN's Anderson Cooper was brought up as an enquiry before Dan Savage light-heartedly interjected with a ""Tom Cruise never called you back,"" which had the audience laughing. For the record, Thorpe was polite/adamant that he does not remember anyone being non-responsive, but assumes anyone who might not have called him back was probably too busy or likely had not received his message.

So, per Do I Sound Gay?, is there a gay voice? Yes and no. It is not an absolute indicator and exceptions and extremes exist. The film does not deny its existence. However, as Thorpe and the film progress in their exploration they conclude that the voice, sound and enunciation should not be matters for anxiety. With the increased self-confidence comes the message that the sound comes from within. One is who he is and one's body is he as well. Why be uncomfortable with it? The point was emphasized at the panel as well. In fact, Thorpe plainly called the title a political slogan. The gay voice is not a negative! The hunt and the laughter in the film made for an entertaining and simultaneously informative viewing.

Several personal points may be of interest. First, it is good to live in a world where homophobia (this word or the words 'homosexual' and 'heterosexual' are curiously shut out from the film) has been pushed back to some extent and film makers can move on to more nuanced topics and considerations. The world (here anyway) has somewhat moved forward from closeted difficulty. Secondly, and personally, it is hoped that gay voices rise to defend and support other oppressed or suppressed minorities. We are all devalued when we only care inwardly. Gay voices for Palestine, Aboriginals supporting Ukraine, Muslims for LGBT, ALS spouses for cancer patients, et cetra et cetra et cetra are mere examples of how we would build a beautiful world. These may require teaming up with members of the affected communities to give them voices and leverage their intimate knowledge of the subject, but it is even more precious when communities with no personal stake stand up for others.",1450569600,,5593,4.989281886387996

7373815,2,B013W7LR8G,"I'm a very open minder person and I really found this entertaining and funny in the beginning, but as it goes further into it, they show a parade (gay pride, of course) and they show a guy tying up another guy with the leather straps and gag in the mouth and then the guy who did the tying up starts pummeling the guy in the pectorals and they are red from the abuse. I guess that's what he likes. Onward. I let it go. It was over soon enough.

It gets much worse. Suddenly, they are flashing men screwing men but blurring out the parts where they actually meet. Trust me, you get the picture. It happened 3 times and about a 60 second period and I immediately shut it off. No thank you. Not going there.

If you're a gay man, you'll love this. If your straight but open minded and prefer not to see how the other half lives, walk away from this. And save your money if you're not sure still, cause it's on Netflix right now. God help the kids out there who have access to this garbage. It's a shame cause it really did start out to be good.",1449446400,2,1041,4.098039215686274
7373816,4,B013W7LR8G,"While this documentary addresses a phenomenon that's always mystified me (why do gay men project feminine voices if they want to attract men attracted to men, although makes sense as a social cue aka advertising), I really think if he sincerely wanted to change his voice, he went the wrong route. Nothing says gay New Yorker like a speech therapist. Anyone would sound gay saying the things he was saying. Let me help you, military guys get there masculine voices being screamed at that they're a f@$$%! and being forced to scream until thier vocal chords are destroyed. Maybe watch some movies with masculine characters, drink beer or chop wood, find your masculine side. Or just earn to love yourself. The straight man with the girl voice at the beginning of the film had one of the prettiest voices I've ever heard. It was beautiful, he should make audio books. Also another stereotype is that gay men are overly analytical and critical. Maybe our voices reflect our inner selves like eyes are the windows to the soul but our voices are the music. Maybe just chill out. Breathe, watch a sunset, drink a beer.",1448668800,,1112,4.737113402061856

The discussion regarding ""code-switching"" between social groups especially had me pointing at the screen thinking ""Holy crap, that's me!""
