8471777,1,B005GKYNMA,"The reviews here CANNOT be serious. This DVD is a total disaster.

First, the volume hardly exists. You'll have to tune your television up to basically- full blast.
Now, I 'm sure we've all seen this great film before and that is why you're looking to order it.
Perhaps you saw it on TCM where it looked beautiful. That is absolutely now what you get
with this debacle. In all seriousness, I have never seen a DVD of such poor quality in my
entire life. Horrible.  Remember when we were younger and used to love to dupe VHS tapes
from our friends? And they'd end up being 3rd, 4th and even 5th generation copies? Remember
how they looked? Well, that's what this looks life.

I resent, terribly, the remastered/ restored claim. That is simply not true. Just because something
effortlessly slapped onto a DVD does not make it ""remastered.""  I returned it the nest day.

We must wait, it seems, till a reputable company puts this out (along with 'Hollywood without Makeup'
preferably) who knows that they're doing. There  is no menu what so ever, by the way. To me--that spells
bootleg.",1490745600,,1083,4.614583333333333
8471778,5,B005GKYNMA,"Amazing that all the studios wanted Ken Murray to polish their actors' home lives, of course not mentioning secrets that might have upset the prejudiced Public.  (There is a great documentary about the famous Aussie costume designer's gay friends, but this is not that one.)",1488585600,,274,5.088888888888889

8471780,5,B005GKYNMA,"Watched this recently on TCM.  Even if much of the footage was posed for the camera, it still gives a glimpse into the past when actors could actually act and WERE movie stars unlike today's so called actors/movie stars who, for the most part, can't act their way out of a paper bag and/or wouldn't be a so called star if they didn't show bare T&A, use the ""F"" word every other word or hump everything with pants/panties on in their movies.  Today's movies exhibit very little to no story content, just filth.  It is no wonder that the youth of today have severely compromised morals.  Shameful.",1477526400,,595,4.5327102803738315
8471781,5,B005GKYNMA,"I saw this on TCM recently.  Knowing what it is, I would've gladly paid for the DVD if that were my only option.  Sort of depressing how nice the stars were for this amateur cameraman.  I don't care if it was a public relations act -- the celebs of today are mostly revolting off screen.",1477008000,,287,4.181818181818182
