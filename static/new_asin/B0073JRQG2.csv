8509337,4,B0073JRQG2,"As the title states, any film of WWII is good film, simply because it is the most significant historical event of the 20th Century and any recording of this event is a good event. Most of it is Department of Defense Film, stock film, that is free in the Public Domain, with I believe no Intellectual Property Rights claims on it. For myself, an avid historian of this period in time, as well as being a Baby-Boomer, as we are known in society,also having a father and countless other relatives, who fought in this most troubling War, left me with this insatiable appetite to learn as much as I am able in the time we have left on this Earth...with my father gone as well as all other relatives, who contributed in one way or another, it is now up to myself to research and interview as many veterans that are still alive, as the numbers dwindle down to a precious few. As far as this DVD is concerned, there are moments of historical value not to mention the many entities that we can follow in regards to our culture and attitude and how things were. These are specially priced DVD sets and are definitely worth the small price to pay. every foot of film is a tribute to the men and women, who gave so damn much of their lives, and far too many gave their lives, for our gift of Freedom today. Almost any memory or historical record of that war, is worth buying. It is not the best, far from it but certainly not the worst.",1349136000,5,1424,4.297397769516729
