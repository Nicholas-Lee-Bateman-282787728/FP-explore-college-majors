6637711,4,B00NBIGJ9E,"Another Lowell Thomas travelogue, with the spectacular cinematography to which Cinerama lends itself.  Occasionally some rather dated notions about non-Western cultures annoyed me, and the music was sometimes a bit of a distraction.  Some sequences were too long, so I used the fast-forward button on my remote occasionally.

The Blu-Ray transfer was of excellent technical quality.  Use the biggest screen you have to view this one!",1417737600,3,433,5.515151515151516
6637712,4,B00NBIGJ9E,"SEARCH FOR PARADISE is the fourth of the Cinerama travelogue/documentaries and it doesn't quite live up to its predecessors. The photography is stunning as you would expect and the travelogue narration of Lowell Thomas is not as parochial as in SEVEN WONDERS OF THE WORLD, That being said, PARADISE is saddled with a bad case of ""going Hollywood"". The major problem, from my perspective, is the soundtrack. The orchestrations are overly lush considering the visuals and the subject matter. While I love Robert Merrill's voice, especially in opera, here the songs he sings sound like SOUTH PACIFIC which I'm sure is intentional but I found it to be hugely distracting. For that I place the blame on Hollywood composer Dmitri Tiomkin. My other chief complaint is that the pacing is not as good as in past offerings since several scenes, notably the Jeep ride in the beginning, go on far too long. This was designed to show off the Cinerama process but even on a big screen it would grow tiresome. Perhaps this is due to the fact that this time around there is only one director (Otto Frank) and so the segments lack variety. Still in spite of these criticisms, SEARCH FOR PARADISE should be seen.

Released in 1957 it gives us a glimpse back to a very different world which seemed more exotic and mysterious than the internet connected world of today. Destinations in SEARCH FOR PARADISE include Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), the Hunza valley in Pakistan, the Kashmir district of India, a trip down the Indus river and finally, witnessing a ceremony in Katmandu, Nepal. The new Smilebox technology allows the reproduction of the curved screen 3 camera Cinerama technique to be captured faithfully if on a somewhat smaller scale. Doesn't matter. The effect is still magical and on some of today's large flat screen home theater setups, it will look most impressive. SEARCH FOR PARADISE is one of two new releases from Flicker Alley (they sent me an advance copy) along with SEVEN WONDERS OF THE WORLD. That one is the better of the two but I am grateful to all involved for making these movies available. Now if only they could release THE WONDERFUL WORLD OF THE BROTHERS GRIMM and KRAKATOA: EAST OF JAVA in the Smilebox technology, then I would truly have a lot to smile about. Both titles come with Blu-Ray, 2 CDs, and a reproduction of the original Cinerama program.

8677190,5,B00NBIGJ9E,These Cinerama films are much better than I expected.  They're a great time capsule of life in the fifties.  The restoration job is nothing short of phenomenal; the films had deteriorated quite a bit by now.  The only thing missing is captions.  I particularly like the extras that feature interviews with people who were in the film or worked behind the camera.,1486684800,,362,4.790322580645161

8677196,5,B00NBIGJ9E,"This was a pleasant surprise. Prior reading about the CINERAMA films, I had never heard of or seen SEARCH FOR PARADISE. But in those days I was just a kid.

Now with the wonderful restorations of the CINERAMA film series, I am catching up to the 1950s sensibilities!!! How they must have impressed!!!

Not bad when you can turn a trip overseas into a CINERAMA movie! But that's what Lowell Thomas has done with this absolutely spectacular film. Magnificent mountains, rapid river rides and more.

How it must to have been hard to lug that camera around. Couldn't zoom and a fixed lens to boot!! No video assist! All guess work.

A great asset to this film is the score by Dimitri Tiomkin which echoes the scenery that is entrancing you.

The extras are great including the IN THE PICTURE, a short made in 2012 with the best still working CINERAMA camera. This short has a ""Making of"" called THE LAST DAYS OF CINERAMA and well may it be too. Wonderfully presented by David Strohmaier and his team.

It's great to have enthusiasts like this to show our current world what it was once like when you went to the movies to see something you couldn't see at home..... until now, and best viewed in a home cinema with video projection and the biggest screen you get.

This film was viewed on an 8ft wide screen, DTS 5.1 and with a BENQ video projector with 50,000 to 1 contract ratio.... well, what else?!!",1418169600,6,1399,4.5059288537549405
