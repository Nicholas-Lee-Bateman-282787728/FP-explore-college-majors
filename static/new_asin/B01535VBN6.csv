7428582,5,B01535VBN6,"A little strange not to have the old guy, but it actually livens it up a bit to have a change of partners. The plot doesn't seem to be quite as focused so far--I've only watched the first two episodes. No, you can't play it on Region 1 players, and I've heard that recent Region 2 DVDs won't play on region-free players any more. I have two DVD players on my computer, with one set to Region 2, so that's how I watch it.

April 13, 2018: I watched the rest of these a while ago. It's certainly worth buying if you can manage to play it. Her partner in this series is actually more damaged than she is. I'll leave it at that so as not to spoil the experience.",1470700800,11,658,4.022900763358779
7428583,5,B01535VBN6,"New dangers, new partners. . .but no Martin.  :( Happy to buy these discs and check in with this series every couple of years.  Saga is a great protagonist. Her development and arch through the season make for compelling watching.  No Bridge too far, to welcome season 4.",1470355200,5,271,4.604166666666667
7428584,5,B01535VBN6,"I am surprised by the sheer excellence of this season.  While I did need patience with the early episodes, that patience was rewarded. This is, I believe, my favorite of the three seasons because everything comes together.  The acting, as in the two previous seasons, is excellent.  Will definitely watch this again.",1470355200,,316,5.038461538461538
7428585,5,B01535VBN6,"I did not think I would like this season because we opened with knowing Martin was in prison for a very long time. So half of our team was gone. I was mistaken in thinking this was going to be a problem. Another man, a cop from the other side again, is assigned to the case with our heroine. This is in a continuation of the Danish-Swedish cooperative effort which began on the bridge. This new guy has an entirely different set of problems from Martin. The two men couldn't be any more different. This one is also younger, closer to her age.

At first we think he is some kind of swinger. We see him leave his family home to meet up with some woman for a tryst. But what is really going on has nothing to do with infidelity, as we eventually learn.

I enjoyed this season immensely and must confess that i didn't miss Martin. I think perhaps his constant domestic woes reached their inevitable conclusion. I hope there is a season 4 as I would like to follow up with these two.",1467590400,5,978,4.252688172043011
7428586,1,B01535VBN6,"And that's what I hate, not the third season of this series, which I am fairly certain is as excellent as the first two seasons, but that I can now not watch.

After 20+ years of ordering foreign films and television series produced in the UK on DVD and blu-ray with English subtitles, and that ARE NOT AVAILABLE in the US in any form, other than occasional streaming services or BBC America (and in almost all instances, never have become so, even when refashioned into American remakes that more often than not offer little in common beyond outline with the originals).  My ordering has also included British and Commonwealth films and series that also fail to arrive on disc in the US.  And this recent development appears to be entirely due to UK (and Australian) disc manufacturers having added a new codec or other code to prevent these discs from now playing on multi-region and PAL compatible players in the US.

My choice of a series to criticize about this practice is apt, as I already own both Season 1 and 2 of Broen or Bron -- aka the Anglicized Bridge, which also has both Canadian and American remakes that bear little resemblance to the Danish/Swedish original, be it in terms of story or specific quality, along with a new and decidedly derivative British/French collaboration just starting on PBS, which can only be described as an unapologetic rip or example of Tolkien's ""thinning.""  The third season of Broen/Bron, produced by Arrow Films -- a company that now also appears to have the English-language rights for Scandinavia as well as other European films and series -- now apparently will be unviewable for myself and other US followers of the original Scandinavian crime drama.  Now we will be unable to see the latest season in any foreseeable future. Two other Arrow Films -- the Italian TV series Gomorrah and the recent British/French film, The Lobster, both of which, as in the past, were pre-ordered, along with the third season of Broen/Bron, through Amazon.co.uk.  They arrived separately within a single week, all now unplayable, with a return postage for all three that cost me almost $54.00, more than the cost of all three blu-rays combined, including shipping from the UK ?!!

So far, I have identified the following UK DVD and blu-ray producers, along with Arrow Films, that are participating in this new and discriminatory practice (We ARE purportedly living today within a global economy, let alone the original promise of the Internet; i.e. why are these region codes still being used, especially if one is paying to purchase a foreign or otherwise unavailable film or television series?!!)  They include The Ink Factory and Sony Entertainment (no surprise there).  And now Amazon in the US is offering the same DVDs or blu-rays from UK-based marketplace sellers who already know these discs won't play in the US, even on multi-region players, and at prices notably higher than the same in the UK ?!!!  As for Amazon, here in the US or the UK, they are intentionally either being obtuse or nontransparent when it comes to this new practice and the selling of unplayable discs in the US.  ""A pox on all their houses..""

So, if you live in the US, and even if you use a multi-region player that is also PAL compatible (along with your tv), do not buy these UK or Commonwealth-produced discs and blu-rays: they will likely not play and you may well find yourself out a lot of money, as Amazon is also not honoring their A-Z Guarantee Program for these discs.  And, as this practice appears to be becoming widespread, I would advise for present not ordering any video discs from the UK or the Commonwealth nations until this problem has been resolved, even though I am sure that, sooner rather than later, the makers of multi-region players will find and distribute a fix-around.  But the point really should be that this shouldn't be happening at all in today's globalized economy, especially when directed at consumers and viewers within a single and specific English-speaking nation as opposed to every other.  Therefore, and as inequitous trade agreements are so topical today for certain US politicians and a segment of American society, I would hope that US consumers will raise enough of a hue and cry at this corrupt and unethical practice on the part of our greedy 'cousins' to bring this to a halt.  Additionally, if you look at this practice today, it truly represents an exemplar of ""stepping over a dime to save a nickel !""",1466899200,81,4475,4.813559322033898

English subtitles used to annoy me, but I prefer them now to the trash and smut that Hollywood expects us to watch.  Very little swearing, very few, if any, sexy scenes and acting that isn't overdone.  Saga ""makes"" each season.  Serious yet comical at times, Saga seems to be in a world of her own and yet she is focused and makes intelligent conclusions to the crimes in order to solve them.  Great show.

7428599,5,B01535VBN6,"The Bridge is a Swedish/Danish murder mystery and thriller, created and written by Hans Rosenfeldt, and produced by Swedish Sveriges Television and Danish DR Television. In this third season, the story line begins with the mysterious murder of the controversial founder of the first gender-neutral preschool in Denmark. The victim is a Danish citizen living and working in Copenhagen, Denmark, whose body was actually discovered in Malmo, Sweden. The ensuing inquiry into the circumstances surrounding this highly unusual case triggers the pairing of Swedish Detective Saga Noren and Danish Detective Henrik Sabroe. These two detectives join forces to collaborate in a complicated investigation of a perplexing conspiracy, which again requires repeated trips across the iconic Oresund bridge, connecting Malmo, Sweden with Copenhagen, Denmark. The performances of the lead actors, Sofia Helin and Thure Lindhardt, are absolutely outstanding, as are the performances of the members of the talented supporting cast. The Bridge - Season 3 is a decidedly intelligent, suspenseful, and gripping murder mystery and thriller, and I found it to be extremely engaging and entertaining. The Bridge - Season 3 features superb plot and character development, as well as great acting performances, and it definitely merits a five-star rating, along with an enthusiastic recommendation.",1505433600,6,1372,5.730392156862745

7428601,5,B01535VBN6,"I could not wait to see this. Sofia Helin's portrayal of Saga Noren is outstanding. Hands down the best. I found myself saying Poor Saga so much. You just want to give her a hug. Her past really comes back to haunt her. There are twists and turns. I was shocked a number of times.
One wonders can this show do without  Martin? Yes yes it can. The new character of Henrik just pops. And his chemistry with Saga is so different then that of Martin's but SOOOO good. Henrik's own secret was/is so well done. I don't want to spoil anything but I am so happy that this show gets one more season. I can not wait. This is a show that you find yourself watching in one go around. Also your so into this story you almost forget to read the subtitles because its just SO good.

This puts the American and British version to shame.

7428611,5,B01535VBN6,"Well, if you haven't noticed by now in this Swedish/Danish connection there seems to be an eerie, other worldly (both fig & lit) resemblance to ""The Tunnel"" with it's French/UK connection. The connection extends further in that both series have a pair of detectives one of which is female (Saga/Elise). Furthering this resemblance pairing both have some Aspergers type behaviors. Both are accompanied by a slightly polar opposite male detective. Both series take advantage of recent events in solving the current vogue of criminal activities as well as old standards. As an aside I think Saga, ""The Bridge"" seems to more authentically maintain her Aspergers behaviors through out a series, but just a picky point.

Both series do an excellent job of making the viewer feel as if present and a part of the investigative process.",1500249600,,827,5.080882352941177
7428612,5,B01535VBN6,"Seasons 1 and 2 of the thrilling Nordic police series THE BRIDGE were some of the best television of its kind ever made, in my humble opinion. A good part of the show's success was the participation of Kim Bodnia as Martin Rohde, one half of a Swedish/Danish detective duo cobbled together to solve a grisly murder occurring on the Oresund Bridge, which connects Malmo, Sweden and Copenhagen, Denmark (Bodnia was the Dane, and judging by his middle, was prone to indulging in more than the occasional Danish...) The Swedish half of the team (and she's no meatball) was Sofia Helin as Saga Noren. Saga: intense, socially awkward, seemingly insensitive but always bluntly truthful (even when the truth hurts), is the perfect foil to Martin: practical, down-to-earth, low-key with his hang-dog expression and easygoing manner. Adding to the incongruity of their differing personalities is their professional standing as the foremost homicide detectives in their respective cities, where each is used to being top dog. This recipe for conflict as they adjust to working together is part of what make the series so compulsively watchable.

So what is the result when one half of this dream team leaves?

The answer? It's better than ever!

Not to take anything away from Kim Bodnia, whose departure from THE BRIDGE was either the decision of the scriptwriters or Bodnia himself (the truth about this troubled water seems a little sketchy with both parties probably trying to stay on good terms and avoid the blame game. After all, Bodnia could always be written back in at some future date...) THE BRIDGE without Bodnia simply means that Ms Helin's Saga has to step up to the plate.

And boy, does she hit a home run!

After watching Sofia Helin's mesmerizing portrayal I thought there must be some similarity between her and Saga. I watched interviews with Sofia Helin. In real life--that is, away from THE BRIDGE-- Sofia Helin is unrecognizable as Saga. Hers is a stunning transformation from a smiling, beautiful, outgoing, sensitive woman to Saga who only begins to really show her vulnerability by the end of series three.

Incidentally, since I strongly agree it is not the purpose of a review to explain the storyline, that little plot tidbit is all you're going to get...

What IS the purpose of a review is to compel the audience to either experience the artistic event under consideration for themselves, or not.

Season 3 of THE BRIDGE manages to do something exceedingly rare, and that is to recover from the departure of a central character--arguably THE central character--and turn this liability into an asset. The script, the new characters, the dramatic tension, the powerful payoff--all are reasons to watch. But Sofia Helin as Saga is THE reason to return to THE BRIDGE. Her performance should win her every relevant award out there. This is acting at the highest level. What Ms Helin accomplishes with just her EYES is a masterclass in acting.

One of the hardest things an actor has to do is convey to an audience what he or she is thinking. This is most often accomplished with the eyes. But to do what Ms Helin does, and that is to take this challenge to the next level and show the audience what she is trying NOT to think, or trying to understand something so she knows WHAT to think, is astounding to watch. And throughout another ten episodes there is not a false note in her performance. Ever.

All the performances are praiseworthy. And there is one red herring the size of a whale... but again, nothing about the plot, please...

Fortunately when programs like THE BRIDGE showcase the extraordinary talents of a unique artist like Sofia Helin, there is no need to say anything but SEE IT!

And salivate for the saga of Saga's Season 4!",1499817600,2,3760,4.839563862928349

7428620,5,B01535VBN6,"Loved this latest entry in the Scandinavian crime/police/detective procedural, especially because the main character had been introduced so well and was so charismatic in the first series. Skipped over Season two due to reading reviews by many purchasers that it was in various formats not working on Region 1 DVD players (but is now available, and is also wonderful...possibly the best season yet), so did not know how her partner from Season 1 ended up in prison, and this left a mysterious void, but this season's focus on the main character's past family difficulties, and her life incrementally falling apart, was fascinating, and her new partner was also very enigmatic and the pairing of the two ended out being a fabulous jumping off point for a compelling season finale cliff-hanger that will hopefully lead to many more follow-up seasons.

7428627,5,B01535VBN6,"The Tunnel, is a riff from The Bridge in both Scandanavian and English versions. Truth be told I like The Tunnel better. The Bridge was the forerunner, and brought the interacting of two separate police departments working together. In all three versions the separate detectives are wary of one another, each having their own personality and their own method of police work. But when they work together, like a marriage, the work is better.

The Tunnel brings Karl, a Brit played by Stephen Dillane. He is on his third marriage, after cheating on each wife, has 5 children by different women, is looking for fun and love to ease the stress of his job. But in reality his life has been his job until he comes face to face with losing his family. The French side of the connection, Elise, is played by Cl&eacute;mence Po&eacute;sy. She is blunt, an attractive blonde, has no social graces, but is brilliant at her job. They are both involved in looking for a serial killer who has left the top half of a British body connected to the bottom half of a French body, placed smack dab in the middle of The Chunnel, the underwater tunnel that connects France and England. This is the beginning of a long stretch to find the killer known as Truth Terrorist.

We meet many characters, and as the days drag on the media, teens, old military, pensioners, financial people and the police are all a part of the circle of deaths. The writing is terrific, the acting is better, the scenes between France and England gorgeous. The Tunnel all boils down to the two detectives, their relationships with others and between themselves. High tension ensues, trying to outwit the Truth Terrorist, and bring him to justice without too many bodies along the way. Loved the two main characters, and their relationship.

There is great depth in the key characters, the interplay of the two cultures is fascinating, and the writing in consistently intense. The primary character, Saga, played by Sofia Helin, is subtle, deep, personal, engaging, memorable, and generally fabulous both in the writing and the acting. And the same can be said for the new character, Henrik, played by Thure Lindhardt, who replaced the character Martin.  Television doesn't get much better than this. By the way it is subtitled of course, and you'll need a player that works on the European standard. Also know, that the story isn't rapped up until the final episode.",1474070400,14,734,5.066115702479339
