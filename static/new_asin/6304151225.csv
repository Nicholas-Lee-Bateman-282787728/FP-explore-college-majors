805703,5,6304151225,"Nothing will ever compare to this film, it is UNARGUABLY the best martial arts movie ever. In fact, no movie comes even remotely close. Jackie Chan's move to hollywood is unavoidable, and as he is now well over 50 we can  assume his best action days are behind him. Order this movie, it is a CRIME  to call yourself a fan of flim and not own this in your collection.",912556800,,366,4.214285714285714
805704,5,6304151225,"In the case of Drunken Master 2, the answer is always, always, always.  Jackie stars as chinese folk hero Wong Fei-hung, and for this movie Wong  happens to be a believer in Drunken Monkey Boxing as THE style of kung-fu.  Try to see this in a letterboxed format just to marvel at the choreography  that goes into the fight and stunt scenes.  For those of us that saw it on  the big screen and are anxiously waiting its re-release, getting a  subtitled, letterboxed version is the closest thing to heaven.  The comedy  as well as the stunts and fights are some of Chan's best.  If this isn't  one of Chan's three best of all time, I must be drunk.  He surely hasn't  made a finer movie since.

805837,5,6304151225,"There have been so many great Martial Arts films in the last decade, one would think The Legend of Drunken Master would fall into obscurity.  However, watching this film from 1994 again recently, I am still amazed at how well it holds up.

There are a dozen or so films from Hong Kong about the legend of the drunken fist that have made it Stateside in the last 5-10 yrs & some are really good, high budget films.  However, the final 15m or so of this film is so well choreographed, it could hit theatres tomorrow and easily hold its own against a contemporary Martial Arts film.  The Legend of Drunken Master is truly a classic.",1506124800,,629,4.396551724137931

However I do have one major issue with it: It doesn't have the Chinese audio track. You can listen to an English dub, or Spanish, or French, but no Chinese. Whenever I purchase a foreign-language film, I expect the foreign-language track. And what is even more galling, I saw this in the theater many years ago with the original Chinese track and English subtitles. Now I can't replicate that great theater-going experience.
Thumbs down to Miramax. They should know better.",1473811200,10,664,4.683760683760684

806086,5,6304151225,"I loved this movie when I was a young adult, and remembered it as one of Jackie's best. Now I'm not so sure - the beginning seems silly, and the villains even more caricatured than usual. The language settings also don't have any Chinese tracks, so you have to suffer through the English language dubbing.

But the action scenes are stupendous, especially at the end. Well worth the watch.

Sadly, hardly any bonus features, just a rambling 6-minute monologue by Jackie himself, where he comes off as quite egotistical.",1454198400,,519,4.820224719101123

806176,4,6304151225,"If you're a martial arts cinephile, then one of the most rare things in the world is an original, unedited version of DRUNKEN MASTER II. What floats around in abundance are these VHS tapes and DVDs that are re-edited or re-released versions of the 1994 classic. To date, no DVD has been distributed that preserves the original aspect ratio and the uncut version with the original Cantonese audio track. My DVD copy - I curse it even as I watch it - is the 2000 North American release that re-titled the thing as THE LEGEND OF DRUNKEN MASTER. My DVD comes dubbed in English and French, but at least Jackie does his own English dub. Sorry, Jackie, I had to turn on the English caption for the hearing-impaired.

It's maybe the most tongue-in-cheek take on revered Chinese folk hero Wong Fei Hung, and, yeah, I'd seen Jet Li's and Gordon Liu's take on Wong Fei Hung in, respectively, the ONCE UPON A TIME IN CHINA films and in CHALLENGE OF THE MASTERS (1976) and MARTIAL CLUB (1981). Jackie's Wong Fei Hung is still sort of chafing under his stern physician father's (Ti Lung) thumb, but he's still got it in him to rebel and goof off, maybe because his step-mom Ling (Anita Mui) is even more rascally than he is (while hubbie's away, step-mom gambles in mah-jong with her cronies). The plot involves sneery westerners plundering China's historical relics and the faking of ginseng roots and step-mom's antics and vicious class warfare at the old steel mill and a decorated Manchu officer (Lau Kar-Leung) who pops in early to accuse Wong of being a traitor. And some other stuff.

Just goes to show the sheer badasssery of Jackie Chan's filmography, I don't even think DRUNKEN MASTER II ranks in his top five best. There's a crap top of cheesy moments and silly slapstick that'll make you groan. And, by 1994, Jackie was up there in age enough that I would've bought it more if he'd played his movie dad's brother rather than his scamp of a son.

What makes this sequel so memorable are the action scenes. Jackie Chan is again at his jaw-dropping best. I admire this dude so much for the dangerous lengths he went to just to entertain us. It's also super neat that he's applying drunken boxing. It's such a specific and visually distinct technique. There must be five or six showstopping fights, capped off by the virtuoso climactic showdown at the steel mill between Jackie and that impressive kicky master, Low Houi Kang, who I believe was a member of Jackie's elite stunt team, as well as Jackie's personal bodyguard. Almost as good is the restaurant melee as Jackie and Lau Kar-Leung take on the swarming Ax Gang. As usual, stick around for the end credit outtakes that demonstrate how much Jackie suffers for his craft.

The DVD's bonus stuff:

- Behind the Master - an interview with Jackie Chan (in English, 00:06:34 minutes)",1434412800,7,2829,4.661322645290581
806177,5,6304151225,"Frankly, I think this is one of the best of Jackie's movies.  It's also one of the most entertaining - it's funny, doesn't take itself too seriously and it will hold your interest.  I watch most of these martial arts movies once and pass them on.  This is one of the few that I've kept and watched more than once.  Some of the scenes will stick in your mind like no other m/a movie.",1432857600,,382,4.121621621621622

Jackie Chan is his own voice actor in this dub, so there's another plus.

This is not only one of Jackie Chan's best movies, it is one of the best kung-fu movies ever made. The action in this movie is so good you will find yourself saying ""no way"" more than once throughout the film.

In classic Jackie Chan fashion this movie is equal parts comedy as action (especially with the dub). Anita Mui's character of Won Fei Hung's step mother was a great dynamic and contrasting ingredient to both Jackie's comedy and action. The final fight scene pulls out all the stops and will leave you satisfied.",1399075200,,614,4.482142857142857

He has gotten a lot of bad rep from people saying that he is a Bruce lee wannabe  and that he will never be as good. IMO. They are two completely different beasts. And I'm pretty sure that he never gave himself that tittle people just kinda branded him with it. I think this film is so killer second time around. The original is good he was much younger when he made it and it is more traditional martial arts roots based. I think this version is more modern to the American fan base and the struggles that he go's through in this version are a little more relatable. The film is filled with killer martial arts amazing stunts and it's just one of Jackie Chana best IMO. Awesome movie.

806547,3,6304151225,"This movie was released in Hong Kong in 1994 as Drunken Master II. Liu Chia Liang directed the first half of the movie. Jackie Chan directed the last half. The climactic fight between Jackie Chan and Ken Lo took four months to film.
Dimension-Miramax dubbed the film into English, cut out some scenes, and retitled the film ""The Legend of Drunken Master"".
Dialouge about the Eight Drunken Fairies is replaced with nonsense such as ""Peter Piper plays a flute"" and ""snake eyes"".
Jackie Chan's Cantopop song is replaced with cheesy rock music! The US English dub of Drunken Master is still worth a look.
They did a good job restoring a beat up, worn out HK print of the film. They also added bombastic sound effects. In Drunken Master II, Wong Fei Hung(Jackie Chan) has to stop evil gweilos and evil Westernized Chinese men from shipping Chinese artifacts to Europe! The late Anita Mui is superb as Wong Fei Hung's stepmother. Ti Lung(A Better Tomorrow, The New One Armed Swordsman) plays Fei Hung's father. Drunken Master II is fun, funny and it has some nice, zesty kung fu fight scenes.
You do have to suspend disbelief. Chan was a middle aged man playing a teenager in the film. Also, Ti Lung and Chan were almost the same age in 1994. Dimension cut out a tasteless gag with Fei Hung pretending he has mental retardation! Michael Wandmacher's music score for Drunken Master II was good. The music in the Hong Kong version was slightly better. The artwork on the DVD is a little bland. It shows Chan in a black T-shirt punching his fist through a white sheet of paper! Drunken Master II is a must see for any Jackie Chan fan.",1368057600,,1625,4.587628865979381
806548,3,6304151225,"I have the hong kong release. The voice actors got the timing right with the dialogue so they got the comedy right. Fey Hung's mother was halarious because her voice actor got the timing right to fit Anita Hui's mannerisms and vocal nuances. Jackie's performance was made into the right balance of spastic child like comedic delivery and classic choreography. The sound effects for the fights were measured and nuanced to fit the application of the moves so they reeled you in and you jumped when they jumped. Ducked when they ducked.
The closing credits were fun to watch.

This version : The low energy dubbing blew the comedic timing in the dialogue. Lines were muted or completely dropped out. The monotone, flat sound effects robbed the fights of their dramatic flair and intensity. Contact was made with many techniques especially with the fish market fight and when fai hung was fighting while his mom tossed alcohol bottles at him to drink and some sound effects were missing diluting the dramatic impact. Music cues were off or missing completely. The final fight was edited. This is a sub standard release of an otherwise excellent film.",1366329600,,1147,4.8820512820512825

The action is so quick in this flick that your eyes will sweat.  Yep, it's the same old story of a guy who means well, but keeps getting further into trouble and has to fight his way out.

There was a whole scene afterward where Jackie has gone cuckoo from drinking the industrial alcohol.  It was pretty much Jackie clowning around, but, when I finally wanted to buy the movie for my collection, all I could find was the edited, Americanized Legend of Drunken Master.

Movie review: it is amazing and arguably Jackie Chan's best movie of all time. If you don't think so, then it is definitely in his top 3 of all time.

Now for what's important, this DVD. I HIGHLY recommend buying this, the Drunken Master II DVD and NOT the Legend of the Drunken Master. The latter is the American release which they changed the audio significantly. Not just the language track, but sound effects and music as well. In that release, they added their own boring music and dull sound effects. The sound effects are barely there and really make the action seem less impressive. Now this DVD, Drunken Master II, is the real deal and what you should get. It has the original audio of language, sound effects and music. The sound effects really make a difference. Every punch, kick and movement sound crisp and cool. The music is really something and reflects the culture of the film beautifully. Also, the actual Drunken Master theme song is in this cut. Legend of the Drunken Master DOES NOT have the theme music. What's up with that? This version also has the alternate ending to the film, which is hilarious. It involves heavy drinking, which is probably why it got cut from the American version. Finally, this DVD version has rated and unrated cuts of the movie.

806750,5,6304151225,"THE LEGEND OF THE DRUNKEN MASTER

As any one who has read my review of the first film by Jackie Chan called ""Drunken Master"" can tell you I am a huge fan of that film. Which by the way that first film has a lot to do with an earlier film starring Jackie by the same cast and crew called ""Snake in the Eagle's Shadow"", just check it out. So it goes with out saying that I love this one as well. Jackie Chan has and will always be a king of these kinds of films; you know great martial arts action mixed with that comedic style. Like the first film this is excellent in both departments.

Chan reprises his role as real Chinese folk hero Wong Fei Hung as he is on his way home when he mixes up a box he had with one identical. The thing that is in that box is a very valuable piece of Chinese artifacts, in fact he unwittingly gets mixed up with those wanting to steal even more. So as these British criminals try to recover what they lost to him Wong Fei must do battle with them using a martial arts style his father disapproves of. That style of course is Zui Quan (Drunken Fist/Drunken Boxing) and his dad disapproves because he must get drunk to fully utilize his skills here, but he fears his son will not know when to stop drinking.

Jackie Chan is in top form here and looks just as good here as he did in the first film which was something like 16 years prior. So that makes it even more impressive especially after you see the action in this film. Which I must say is top notch and not only amazing but also very funny at times. The film is directed by Lau Kar-Leung [Liu Chia-Liang] who also directed one of my favorite films of all time ""36th Chamber of Shaolin"" as well as its two sequels along with ""My Young Auntie"" among others. You may also know him as martial arts choreographer to films such as ""The One-Armed Swordsmen"" films as well as ""Master of the Flying Guillotine"", ""Seven Swords"" and many others, and has acted in countless films as well. So this film was staked with all kinds of talent like the two mentioned above as well as people like Lung Ti who played Chan's father and Anita Mui who was his step mother.

This film in my opinion like the first film is a classic and they both rank very high amongst every one I know. If I had to choose which I thought I liked more I would not be sure. I may have to go with the first film but only by a little and even then I am not sure. Both films are classics and worth any one's time, I say go pick up both right away.

806753,3,6304151225,"Drunken Master 2 is my favorite Jackie Chan movie, and one of my top ten movies of all time. For a while, I assumed I was going to be stuck with either the edited, dub-only Region 1 release, or the old uncut Thakral DVD, with lesser quality picture, incorrect aspect ratio, and grammatically incorrect English subtitles.

I admit, I ordered this the moment I saw that it was available. Chinese released with the original language with English subtitles? Uncut? Proper ratio? Sounded good to me. Well, it was good, up until the credits.

Let me get to that in a bit, first I'd like to point out that the end scene cut from Miramax's release has been put back in. The picture quality on it isn't as good as the rest of the movie, but oh well, its back, and with proper ratio. It was only when the ending song started playing that something went wrong.

In the original version, the credits song is performed by Chan himself (as he frequently does for his Hong Kong movies), but the moment they cut to the credits, they switched to the Miramax footage, complete with English credits AND SOUNDTRACK.

Yes, in the ""uncut"" version, the credits are taken from the Miramax version, and their rock n' roll instrumental piece plays when Chan's song should have. It's especially jarring, because Chan's song starts playing in the last few seconds of the movie, but then all of a sudden, it changes. Quite disappointing.

Aside from that, there are two English-subtitle tracks. There are the standard dub-titles for Miramax's dub, and the more literal translation for those watching the original language. Unfortunately, it is the same exact subtitle track released by Thakral years ago, still laden with spelling and grammatical errors.

Additionally, in the scene where Chan sings a drunken song in an outdoor restaurant, alternate takes from the Chinese masters were used when Miramax released it. The original footage has NOT been restored. The original audio is cut and slightly repeated at times to make the dialog LOOK like its following perfectly.

So, while this is by far the most complete release yet, there are still annoying imperfections. The edited version is still on this disc with both English dubs, and everything else advertised.

Myself? I am currently working on an editing project where I am combining the uncut soundtrack with the superior footage, and I am re-subtitling the whole movie to my best efforts. That will be my DVD, because it is what this film deserves.",1307059200,8,2479,4.843971631205674
806754,5,6304151225,"This was much better than the original Drunken Master; it also had much better dubbing (Jackie dubbed over himself in this one).

If would definitely pick up this copy over ""The Legend of Drunken Master,"" due to better quality of the dubbing.",1307059200,,313,4.777777777777778
806755,2,6304151225,"In a day when most catalog films can be purchased for $10 or less on BD, this one is only worth half that.  Disappointing:  considering this is one of Chan's funnier films, even if the US cut is more of what penny pinching studio execs think a movie should be rather than a faithful preservation of what was created by the original artists themselves.  But I just wanted to make a quick comment on the Blu-ray itself... well, maybe not so quick.

I own the previous DVD and was eager to upgrade the film to BD, as I absolutely love the format, even though early reviews were less than enthusiastic of the video upgrade and the incredible shortsightedness of the studio still not providing the films original language track, something which is virtually a staple even for most dvds.

On a positive note, Chan does his own dub; anyone who's watched many of Chan's Hong Kong films knows how grating it can be listening to a western/asian voice coming out of his mouth - it just ain't right.  Gratefully that's not the case here, which is about the only positive thing I have to say about the disc.  Though the audio is TrueHD, it's a rather weak performer, as the English dub overshadows musical and effectual ambience, as is so often the case with movies that have been redubbed.  It's like you're listening to two separate tracks:  the original music and effects track, volume reduced, and distant, with the newer English dub layered over it, rather than a properly integrated sound design.

As for the video:  any improvement is mild at best.  35mm should look much crisper than this.  Aside from reduced if not eliminated ringing - which is a staple of the dvd format due to the down-conversion that the HD studio master must undergo for the film to be presented on such a lossy 480i format - I saw none of the usual tell-tell signs that so boldly distinguish HD from SD when viewing BDs on a full 1080p setup at revealing front projection screens sizes.  Colors and dynamic range were muted, and high frequency detail was virtually non-existent.  That said, the video didn't appear excessively DNR scrubbed or tweaked for home video either.  Whether or not the very unimpressive look is innate to the photography or a result of a very poor master (not uncommon for foreign films re-released in the US), only someone with intimate knowledge of the production could say, but again, 35mm should look far better defined.

If Disney released this BD title at budget pricing, I wouldn't be as tempted to complain; I can understand if they can't justify paying for a new all-out effort for a title that won't exactly be a huge seller even if they did; but asking a premium price for what is clearly a quick and cheaply produced regurgitation of their former substandard dvd effort that doesn't live up to even compulsory HD standards or expectations - more like slapping SD quality work on a new HD disc - is an insult to the fans AND the format.  Simply put, this disc does NOT justify it's premium price with a premium, new, or even sincere effort.  Such exploitation of the consumer fanbase only makes us distrustful of studios and apprehensive about gambling our money on other titles where the studio actually seems to care about quality and earning the price of admission.

While an upgrade from dvd in the shallowest sense (interactivity, disc durability, the most minute of audio/video improvements), Disney's BD does not justify its price premium, which only hurts consumer confidence in the BD format as a whole.  BD is capable of SO much more and there is no doubt that this film is capable of a lot better as well.",1304035200,4,3621,4.670866141732284

I like rewatching many of the action sequences here. *Everybody* ought to see the axe gang scene, if they see only one thing. And Anita Mui really is a scene-stealer as Jackie's step-mom. Jackie is believable as mischievous youth Wong Fei Hung, and I also liked him as the more responsible youth Ah Lung, a.k.a. Dragon, in Young Master circa 1980.

I say that because there are some detractors from making this his best movie ever, but if you find yourself liking kung Fu movies in general besides just Jackie Chan movies, this will be your favorite.

This movie is a huge improvement on the original Drunken Master movie. While this is still a dubbed movie it definitely has a more international appeal. Also like the original Jackie pummels his enemies using his drunken boxing technique (which as it implies is a technique improved by vast qualities of alcohol, so it may not be a great movie for children). In this movie Jackie has to battle pilferers of Chinese heritage and his father's disapproval, beside the countless nameless enemies. As i have already said this movie has Jackie's best fight scenes collectively both in quantity, he fights for a large portion of the movie, and quality. However, any Jackie aficionado will feel it lacks his signature death defying stunts, and while it is filled with humor; subjectively it doesn't feel as funny or his character as likable as some of his other movies.

Bottom line is that you will love this movie. It's great. I don't usually watch kung fu movies unless they are Jackie Chan movies and in my opinion it ranks up there in Jackie's best movies.",1284681600,,1367,4.7154811715481175

806823,4,6304151225,"Do I even need to go into detail about how bad of a job they did here? Nearly everyone who's reviewed the movie has thrown a fit over how this isn't THE version of the movie that we want or deserve. And I'm with them on that, but face it- if The Legend of Drunken Master didn't get proper release by this generation, I don't think we'll be getting it for a while. Yes, this is basically the dvd version (which was basically the vhs version) put on the blu-ray format. It isn't very good, and not worth buying if you already have the dvd. Heck, go buy the dvd instead since it's a bit cheaper. But if you like to have all your movies in the current format, AND haven't seen or bought the movie yet, then I'd recommend the blu-ray release. Wait, did I just contradict myself?

If you haven't seen it yet, The Legend of Drunken Master is a sequel to Drunken Master. Wong Fei-Hung, the master of 'drunken boxing' (as they call it in this dub), gets into a bit of a mix-up with another person while on a train, and his father's luggage gets mixed up. Soon after, everyone gets into a mess with a group of suits who are pretty much stealing China's history, and selling all kinds of Chinese antiques to museums, earning more money by making people travel to their country just to see them. Once he discovers this, Wong sets out to put an end to this, but not without getting a little help, and causing a few problems along the way. Not only does his father oppose fighting (especially Wong's fighting style), but he gets involved with the suits as well thanks to Wong.

No, the plot isn't very exciting at all, and honestly, it gets boring at times. Blame it either on the English dub for not being very enthusiastic for about half the voice actors, or blame it on the typical 'we need to save our country'-esque storyline. This movie's all about stunts and fight scenes, of which there's a good amount. Jackie Chan never impressed me much until I saw this movie, and he has nothing but my full respect now. The things he's able to pull of in this movie rarely get reproduced in film or television, or martial arts in the USA even. A lot of the supporting cast that take part in the fight scenes are good too, even a Tae Kwon Do expert (a style that I loathe) managed to make my jaw drop a few times. There's some funny comedic bits scattered about, but the pacing is ruined by the oh-so-boring British Embassy parts, despite being key to the plot. Either way, if you're looking for a good marial arts movie, Jackie Chan will make this entertaining for you, especially since this was when he could really move. More recent martial arts movie fans might also get a kick out of seeing the Axe Gang- who were later resurrected by Stephen Chow for his masterpiece, Kung Fu Hustle.

Now for the bad- the picture and audio quality. Again, this is basically the dvd release put on blu-ray. There's grain, dirt and artifacts on the print, but it's not THAT bad. Some people are making it sound like this was taken from an old theater projector reel and converted to blu-ray. To be honest, there were only a few times when I noticed lines and grain to the point where it disctracted me, and that was for a second. The audio...yes, it's still the English dub, though you also have the option of French or Spanish. I personally thought the Spanish was much better than the English track. Sub-titles are also in English, Spanish, French, Polish and Portuguese. The movie doesn't make much use of the surround sound on any of these, and just makes you wonder why Disney even bothered putting this out without restoring or upgrading anything.

Special features? Well, there's the always enjoyable blooper reel during the end credits, but other than that, it's just a standard interview with Jackie around when the movie was coming out in theaters here. He goes on about how much fun it was- nothing too insightful, and it's short at less than 10 minutes. Nothing about the different fighting styles seen in the movie, nothing about how much the Drunken Master movies helped his career in the US, no look back with some of the stars, nothing.

Again, if you don't have it already and are sticking with blu-ray for your movies, only then can I recommend this. Otherwise, stick with the dvd and keep waiting for a good version to come out.

806824,3,6304151225,"I love Jackie Chan and own most of his original HK movies.  I have so much wanted them to migrate to blu-ray in their original form and from HK Flix we are starting to now get that.  But why o why is it always a compromise with us fans?  If we buy US versions we get bad dubbing and unoriginal soundtracks and horrible criminal MiramAXE edit cuts to Jackie's films.  If we buy HK versions we get no choice of English dubbing and varied quality of transfer from good to down right horrible on some disks.  The Weinstien Bros (Dragon Dynasty) had it right with their remastered DVDs of PS1 and 2, but what about the rest of the catalogue? Is there no sense in the film industry that these films need to be preserved in the best possible way as originally presented?  Unedited, remastered, and transferred in the highest quality to take full advantage of what our blessed blu-ray has to offer?  Is there not demand enough from us fans for that?  We all agree these are FANTASTIC FILMS we want to watch again and again and again.  Why are we fans complaining here and on many other film review comment pages the video quality of this film is no better than the DVD version?  Why is there no choice for English dubbing on the uncut HK version?  Are video editors uncaring, plain stupid, or just out for a quick buck?  Hell even Jackie complains!  For goodness sake we finally have the technology and capability to truly show these films at home as they were seen in the theatre and instead we get half of what we want, and 1/2 of what is capable.  SIGH SIGH SIGH!!!
I remember when George Lucas remastered Star Wars and talked of the state of the quality of the film they found to work with.  How it was falling apart and fading despite its relatively young age.  He and Steven Spielberg said it was lucky they caught it in time and rescued master copies of the original film.  Luckily they had the money to remaster them and clean them up for us.  Will we ever be so lucky with Jackie's films?  I hang my head in dismay.
Dear Dragon Dynasty, Dear Kam & Ronson, Dear MiramAXE! please please please listen to your customers; listen to us fans; Give Us JACKIE AS HE WAS MEANT TO BE!  Take extra care when you transfer to Blu-ray, clean the film at least, and work to preserve the detail...use the more than adequate space on a blu-ray disk to include multiple SPOKEN languages; STOP STOP STOP CENSORING and give us the UNCUT VERSIONS WITH ORIGINAL SOUNDTRACKS!  For Gods sake people this is the 21st century and we can do it.  When you buy a Blu-ray it should much much crisper than the DVD version, it should be uncut, it should have loads of features and choices, it should be the ultimate home theater experience not some half baked expensive edited, unadorned transfer of some off the shelf copy.
I WISH JACKIE WOULD TAKE CONTROL AND USE HIS POWER TO PRESERVE IN PRISTINE FORM HIS FILMS AS THEY WERE MEANT TO BE instead of this hit and miss that has always plagued his wonderful films!",1263340800,9,2982,4.413162705667276

806897,3,6304151225,"In 1978, Jackie Chan's ""Drunken Master"" (or Jui Kuen) was an exciting film that is considered a classic and help popularize the drunken boxing style of martial arts which has been copied on various video games and other films.  Over 16 years later, Chan returned for ""Drunken Master II"" (Jui Kuen II) which was not a direct sequel but followed the character with the same name, Wong Fei Hung.

For those not familiar with the name Wong Fei-hung (or Hong), the real man lived from 1847 through 1924 and was a master of the no-shadow kick, drunken boxing, the lion dance and Hung fist.  The character has been explored in a number of films which include the Jet Li ""Once Upon a Time in China"" films and for Jackie Chan in the ""Drunken Master"" films

The film revolves around a man named Wong Fei Hung who travels with his father (a doctor) and a student named Tsao via train after obtaining more medicine to bring back home.  But because they must pay duty fees for the items they bring with them, Wong would rather not pay for them (despite his father telling him to) and hides his items through one of the non-Chinese travelers luggage, hoping to retrieve it later on the train (the non-Chinese and the rich Chinese are separated in a luxury style train cabin away from the Chinese travelers who happen to be packed in like sardines.

But as Wong Fei Hung goes to retrieve the item, he discovers another man trying to take the item out of the luggage.  We then see that the item the man takes, looks exactly like the item that Wong had.  A fight ensues and the older man who is a Chinese loyalist named General Fu (Liu Chia-liang) manages to easily dodge and defend all of Wong's attacks and even calls Wong a traitor (which he has no idea why he is being called that).

Eventually, after the chaos ensues, Wong is able to retrieve the item but it appears that the old man accidentally took Wong's item (a ginseng root) and Wong took the item that the old man was trying to get, which appears to be an old Chinese ancient artifact and now the foreign traveler who own the luggage along with Chinese military are searching the whole train for it.  Fortunately, a Counter Intelligence Officer (played by Andy Lau) manages to save Wong from being caught.

We learn that the artifact is part of Chinese traditional artifacts being taken by the British Consul and Chinese gangsters out of the country and now they are after Wong and want the artifact back.

Meanwhile, back at home, we get to see how Wong's stepmother (played by Anita Mui) tends to bail her stepsons from trouble but when those looking for the artifact steal from his mother's friend and even hit his mother in the face, Wong must used the forbidden fight of Drunken Boxing and also drinking alcohol which helps boost his attacks.  But when he break his promise to his father, he learns a lesson by being beaten by his father and thrown out to the street when intoxicated, the Chinese gangsters beat him up to send a message that the want the artifact.

Will Wong be able to protect his family, his friends and even his land from the enemies without breaking his father's ultimatum of never to fight or get drunk again?

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""The Legend of the Drunken Master"" is one of those releases that one will either love or really hate.  First, let's discuss the picture quality.  Picture quality is probably the best that this film has ever been seen.  The High Definition 1080p (2:35:1) definitely brings out the film with much clarity but by no means is it perfect.  You will see occasional dirt and scratches and there are some scenes where either there was change in camera lens but sometimes the film is not consistent at times.  With that being said, fans of the film will definitely enjoy learning of how good the picture quality is and because the first version of this film  that I owned was a VHS and then an uncut HK VCD, it's great to see the film with so much detail. But for those expecting the best from Blu-ray, you may not exactly be pleased but it is an upgrade from the original DVD release.

As for the audio quality, this is where things begin to look murky and it all depends on the viewer.  Audio is provided in English 5.1 DTS-HD (48kHZ/24-bit) and French 5.1 Dolby Digital and Spanish 2.0 Dolby Digital.  For the most part, lossless audio definitely shows major improvement during the action sequences and utilizes the surround channels.  Meanwhile, the English voice dubbing can be understood but Jackie Chan's English voice over is sometimes hard to understand.  But the biggest surprise is that there is no Cantonese/Mandarin audio track.  So, for those who prefer to watch Asian films in their natural language will be upset to know that it was not included.

Second, it's important to let people know that this is the edited version of the film done back in 2000.  The music was changed, the special effects were changed and the original ending had a significant scene cut out.

With that being said, for those who don't mind the English dub, were familiar with the 2000 DVD release and don't mind that the film was edited for the US, will definitely find the picture and audio quality to be much, much better than the original DVD release.  The picture quality is shows quite a bit of detail and despite the film being made in 1994, there is no sign of excessive DNR (digital noise reduction), the film looks way better than it ever has.  The audio is also much better than the previous DVD and there is a good use of the surround channels.  But if you want the original Chinese audio, unfortunately, you will not find it on this release.

Subtitles are presented in English SDH, French and Spanish.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""The Legend of Drunken Master"" comes with the following special feature:

  * Behind the Master: An Interview with Jackie Chan - (6:35) Jackie Chan talks about how he always wanted the film to come out in the US and talks about the stunt choreography of the film.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""The Legend of Drunken Master"" is absolutely vintage Jackie Chan at his very best. Jackie Chan is literally amazing to watch as the Smooth, fluid choreography is just outstanding and absolutely wonderful to watch in High Definition.  But those battle sequences are just amazing to watch and the fight scenes, especially earlier in the film with Chinese loyalist General Fu (Liu Chia-liang) was just incredible.

Also, impressive was to see the latest Anita Mui (who was the equivalent to music artist Madonna in Hong Kong) and both she and Jackie Chan had awesome chemistry onscreen, even in this film despite Chan being much older than Anita, but everything seems to work quite well.  As for Andy Lau's appearance, it was quite a short role.  And for Shaw Brothers fans, you can catch the veteran Ti Lung playing Wong Kei-ying.

Again, I want to make it clear that this film has its best looking transfer to date on Blu-ray.  Picture quality is very good but not great. But what it all comes down to is the viewer and what they want are expecting from this film.

For those wanting the 2000 English dubbed dialogue, you're going to get an awesome lossless track on Blu-ray as the film's lossless audio is utilizing the front, center and surround channels quite well during the action scenes.

But for those who have been waiting for the uncut release, let alone a release that would include the Cantonese or Mandarin audio, you're not going to get it on this Blu-ray release.  And this is a major blow for those who have been hoping that with a Blu-ray release, they would be getting the version they have waited so long for.  Even watching the final scene, a viewer is left wondering why it ends quite suddenly with no appearance from Jackie Chan but the truth is that Dimension cut that scene out (the original ending with Jackie Chan is a bit shocking but I'm not going to spoil it for you) because it was deemed in appropriate.

So, needless to say...it's going to be a love or hate release among fans.  As a fan of the film, one can either wait and hope that an import uncut release of the film makes it to Blu-ray.  Or perhaps maybe purchasing this latest release with the better picture quality, better lossless audio but for the most part only in English, French and Spanish (no Chinese audio dialogue) along with the revisions made back in 2000.

Personally, I want an uncut version with its original Chinese language (ala lossless audio) included and unfortunately, I didn't get it with this release.  Otherwise, for those who don't mind the revisions or the English dub, this Blu-ray release of ""The Legend of the Drunken Master"" is the definitive version to own for now.",1252972800,74,8681,4.60064935064935

806900,5,6304151225,"I know it's sacrilege to suggest that a cut-down, dubbed DVD is superior in any way to the original.  But in this case it does have its advantages.  This film (originally titled Drunken Master 2) is JC's best Kung Fu choreography you'll find.  This version is shorter than the Hong Kong version, has only dubbing, and replaces the original score.  But being as this is such a fantastic fighting film, the watered-down format makes it more palatable to the casual viewer.  You'll have no subtitles to read (and at least Jackie dubs his own voice), all the action is preserved (you only lose some bits of the story), and you get the cleanest picture available.  For any die-hard fans I, of course, recommend getting the uncut original.  Now, onto the movie itself.

Jackie Chan has a pretty broad spectrum to his work. Some films are all about the big stunts, some are about the action sequences, some are funny. This film is all about the fight sequences.

Hands down this is Jackie's best kung fu choreography. It was done by Ming-Sing Wong (aka Sam Wong), who also choreographed Jackie's other fighting masterpiece ""Who Am I?"". While WAI does boast some impressive fights with some huge stunts, DM2 is pure fighting. The Drunken Boxing style really allows Jackie to show his skill and creativity inside of the kung fu arena. This film really lets you see just how good Jackie is. Here, he shows he can hold his own against his contemporaries like Jet and Donnie (back in the day that is, at least).

The story is a little silly: things get set in motion because of some missing ginseng getting mixed up with a royal seal and some British imperialists. Same kind of thing as ""Once Upon a Time in China"" (since Jackie and Jet are playing the same character of Wong Fei Hong, it's not surprising). Only here, it's a bit more comedic than the Tsui Hark fare. But it doesn't matter. The interplay between Jackie and the late, great Anita Mui as his mother is priceless. The comedic element to this film really does add some depth, so you're not just sitting by watching the clock until someone starts punching someone else in the face.

You really could spend a semester studying why this movie is simply one of the greatest action films of all time. Even those who don't want to read subtitles and prefer their action with lots of explosions and CG will love this. Look, if you haven't seen it, stop reading and just click the button to add this to your shopping cart, select the fastest shipping you can afford, and just sit back and watch in amazement.",1219968000,,2551,4.596916299559472

I do love this movie and for every Jackie Chan fan, its one of the movies you need to watch. When my VHS version 'died', I got a copy of this version to find... f***in A, they dubbed it, and dubbed it horribly I might add. I really don't understand why you would want to lobotomize a film like this, or any film for that matter with D-list vocal talent... So my rating is for this dvd release of Drunken Master II, a 5 star movie otherwise destroyed by the stupid dubs. And though that won't matter to most of you, for some it will mean enough to keep many from even thinking about purchasing this release, and that is who this review is for.",1215648000,4,814,4.158227848101266

806904,3,6304151225,"I, as so many fellow commentators here, have been an almost life long fan of the marvel that is Jackie Chan, and this particular motion picture, ""The Legend of Drunken Master"" or ""Drunken Master II"" is probably his best work ever. Definitely top three - fourish (it's quite hard to disguingish the best from the second best isn't it?).

The fights and the stunts are, as usual, stunning, defying belief, and completely bonkers. Everybody is in top form, Jackie Chan, Chin Kar Lok, Ken Lo, Ti Lung and very impressively Lau Kar Leung. Visually very pleasing, very well produced and well acted this film is nothing but impressive.

However, this DVD is the absolute opposite of impressive. There is no original language track on the DVD, only English, which is just stupid. These DVDs should be made with Mandarin/Cantonese(/English) language tracks and nothing less. There aren't any extra materials either, which isn't exactly bonus points to the average buyer.

I give it three stars which comes as a compromise of 6 stars for the film and nil for the release. Get a Chinese copy if you can get your hands on one. It will be so much better.",1207699200,3,1141,4.752525252525253
806905,4,6304151225,"I can't say that I'm a connoisseur of Martial Arts films by any means.  I have a few Jet Li movies that I enjoy quite a bit, but other than that I don't have much.  I also can't say I'm a big fan of Jackie Chan's.  The first ""Rush Hour"" was pretty good, though 2 was just okay, but I didn't like ""Shanghai Noon"" despite the fact that I do think Owen Wilson is funny.  Other than that, I don't have much Jackie Chan experience.  Either way, when my girlfriend picked out this movie for purchasing I was skeptical, but because she wanted to see a Martial Arts film I caved, so we watched it.

Wow, what an underestimation I made.  I mean maybe it's because I wasn't expecting much so it greatly exceeded my expectations, but I still found this to be an incredibly fun movie to watch.  I will warn viewers that this movie is dubbed in English and it's originally done in Cantonese.  So, no sub titles, but you have the English over a different language problem where the mouths don't move in sync with the words.  I could easily get over this because the movie was very well done and pretty funny.  Another part that made this a little easier to deal with is, I believe, Chan dubbed his own character, so that was a nice feature.  I'm personally not a Martial Arts purist, so I could let this slide.

Now, I'll probably get thrashed for saying I haven't seen the first Drunken Master yet, frankly I didn't know one existed.  That doesn't change my opinion that the movie was great.  The Martial Arts performed in this film were absolutely top notch!  Even more impressively is Chan does his own stuff, stunts and all.  Apparently I should start looking into other Jackie Chan films to see if the others are on par with this one.

Basically we return to Chan's character of Wong Fei Hung.  He's a mischievous son of a healer and apparently Martial Arts trainer.  Wong Fei Hung learned a style of Martial Arts called Drunken Boxing in the first film from another teacher, but his father doesn't seem to agree with that method of fighting.  So when his father finds out he's been engaging in that kind of fighting he is severely chastised for it.  It doesn't help that his mother is just as mischievous and was the one who encouraged him to do it!  In the midst of all this Wong Fei stumbles upon a British conspiracy which involves taking ancient Chinese artifacts back to England.  Wong Fei, a Royal Guard, and his friends seek to stop this from happening.  The adventure is part comedy and part serious.  Both are mixed excellently in a fairly seamless fashion that doesn't distract the viewer, neither tries to outshine the other style.  A testament to how well written this movie is.

The best fight scenes are the one in the restaurant and the final fight.  Naturally the final fight has to be one of the best or else it doesn't end on a really superb note.  One thing that is added in at the end is some outtake scenes when the credits are rolling.  Here you can see some of the funnier mistakes that were made during filming; some of the more shocking are when Chan was being set on fire for some scenes!

Anyway, I can't help but recommend this movie.  However, the DVD doesn't appear to have that many options available for viewers.  Like you can't watch it with sub titles in its original language.  This might detract from some viewers, especially the purists.  For me it didn't change my views much, again, I'm a little out of my element in this genre.  Regardless, I recommend people see it, it has amazing fight scenes and a very well written story overall.",1207094400,3,3566,4.447530864197531

The Legend of Drunken Master has the best Jackie Chan fighting I have ever seen, but also a good story with a nice plot, good characters and villains, and dubbing that actually isn't too badly done.

The story has a good focus on family, and what Wong Fei Hung (Jackie Chan) must do in order to honor his family and his country by stopping thieves from stealing and exporting Chinese artifacts that represent China's history.  Sounds a bit boring but the story develops nicely in the film.  After the first 5 minutes, you may not care because the beginning of the movie has an incredible fight scene promising just some of the action yet to come.  Some of the action scenes mid-way through the movie are so good, they are better than a lot of final fight scenes in other similar movies.  By the time the final fight scene in this movie is over, you may not even have realized that 15 straight minutes passed by.  It really is that long of a scene and it is very, very entertaining.  Chan does not do many stunts in this movie, but rather displays his true and raw martial arts skills, specifically the uniqe form of Drunken Boxing.

  The TRUE title of this film is Drunken Master 2 (US distributors just love to change the names of chinese kung fu movies). While it is great to be able to see this film in the US, this DVD release is a TRAVESTY. There is no original language track to watch with english subtitles, only a TERRIBLE english dub. The ending has been cut, so that this version of the film ends so abrubtly it will leave you wondering what the heck just happened. A new score has also been added. Miramax is a company that takes great delight in chopping up foreign films for US release because they feel Americans are far too stupid to understand non-American concepts or humor. Harvey Weinstein SUCKS, plain and simple; thank god they got rid of him! However, unless you have access to Hong Kong DVDs (where you may obtain the complete version of Drunken Master 2), you are stuck with this DVD for now. Still, this is a great film, and really showcase Jackie's talents.
  The fight choreography is most impressive, with the emphasis of course on acrobatics and comedy (this is a Jackie movie, after all). The story is particularly good for a kung fu movie, and will hold your interest throughout. I highly recommend this film to any kung fu or Jackie Chan fan.
  As a service to anyone reading this, I will tell you the ending that was cut (and was judged too insensitive for you, a 'dumb American', to handle): *SPOILER ALERT*!!!!

As Wong Fei Hung's parents stand at the podium, the crowd is wondering where Fei Hung is. His parents say he is recovering from his fight. They then go back home. Upon opening the door, we see Fei Hung (Jackie) with a 'retarded' look on his face as he practices kung fu. They even say 'He's retarded!' See, during the end fight he drank so much gasoline it made him retarded. A typically lame Chinese slapstick humor moment, its not intended to be taken seriously. It most certainly is NOT offensive, and Harvey Weinstein should have his head examined. Now you know the real ending!",1141776000,,2143,4.507731958762887

As for the rest of the movie, basically there are a lot of highly choreographed fight scenes for Jackie Chan and the rest of the cast, and if you like that sort of thing there is enough of it here to impress you.

The concept of the movie is that Jackie Chan is a master of drunken boxing.  Watching the film, we see that drunken boxing consists of posing in a humorously drunk way for a few moments and then getting back to the choreographed fight scenes.

The plot of the movie is just as thin as the drunken boxing.  The bad guys are stealing Chinese artifacts and selling them to westerners, thus robbing China of its culture.  Oh, okay.  Whatever.  I wouldn't think that sending a few pots to a museum in Paris is that big a deal.

Not that there's anything wrong with the story.  I just didn't care much for the conflict between father and son, though it is resolved well enough.

To anyone who has said Chan is just a gimmicky martial artists, this movie is a great illustration of how gifted he truly is.  The action isn't as prop driven as most of his other films, which makes it a nice change of pace.  The Drunken Boxing style, while intentionally somewhat goofy, is very fun to watch.  And watching Chan act drunk while battling shows how effortless he can make this all appear.

The story gets the job done.  But the stuntwork and Chan's personable screen presence hold this film together.  My favorite stunt involves hot coals.  Not saying anymore than that, but damn if Chan isn't crazy sometimes.  And God bless him for it.",1121731200,,937,4.550898203592815
807105,2,6304151225,"'Drunken Master 2' aka 'The Legend of Drunken Master' is quite a major disappointment for this fan of the original. The very belated sequel to Jackie Chan's wonderfully entertaining breakthrough film sees him still playing a teenager well into his forties, but jettisons most of what made the original such fun - such as Yuen Wu Ping's imaginative and often hilarious martial arts choreography and even the character of the Drunken Master himself - in favor of the old mixed suitcases plot and tedious generation gap comedy.

It was a troubled production, with Chan falling out with original director and co-star Chia-Liang Liu and finishing the film himself, and the end result looks decidedly undecided: there's very little of the comic drunken boxing (and what there is is terrible) while co-star Andy Lau is given a mysterious build-up in the first reel only to disappear from the rest of the film. The final fight is quite good, but this is well below what Chan is capable of.

As usual with the US releases, this is a Miramaxed version: the cuts are extremely minor (the only noticeable ommision is the offensive final gag), but it has been quite horribly dubbed. Sadly, the Asian DVD releases are all in the wrong ratio - 1.85:1 - while this version is at least presented in 2.35:1.",1119052800,,1289,4.801801801801802
807106,5,6304151225,"I'm sure you're not interested in this movie for the story, so i'll just cut to the chase: Jackie Chan lays out the best martial arts fight scenes ever made!

Chan shows that he is, indeed, the ""Master"" of Drunken Boxing. I'm a big fan of his movies in general, because of the physicality of the fight scenes. They are masterfully choreographed, fast, and brutal. Contact looks real and powerful. The sword vs. spear fight in the beginning, the restaurant brawl (where Jackie takes on a legion of gangsters with a bamboo stick), and the magnificent 20 minute finale make this movie an absolute thrill ride.

While Jackie Chan is unquestionably the star of the show, Anita Mui puts on a hilarious performance and Ken Lo's kicks are surreal (almost makes you wonder who would have REALLY won if it were for real).

For those looking for a martial arts masterpiece...your search has ended. This fight scenes are unrivaled, the comedy is a smash, and (suprisingly) the story has substance.

This version you are about to buy on Amazon is the US version. The dubbing, unlike most dubbed HK movies, is bearable...hardly atrocious at all. If you can't get your hands on an original, uneditted version, this one is perfectly suitable.",1110326400,2,1226,4.796208530805687

807109,5,6304151225,"The legend of the drunken master originally came out in hong kong many years ago.  Jackie Chan has obviously followed in the steps of bruce lee, appearing in films  as an extra or goon as he did in ""enter the dragon"".

However, since jackie chang , like bruce lee wasn't known here in the u.s. it took a while for this martial arts star to be imported to the u.s.. but eventually chang has been

recognized as one of the best martial arts star in the world.

This movie ""legend of the drunken"" is a very funny, and explosive action packed film.  the story revolves, arounds a conspiracy of corruption by members of the british government to smuggle and steal chinese artifacts out of  the country. the members would later sell these goods for a large sum of money.

Chang plays wong fie hung , a doctor/psycisian who uses his style of fighting known as drunken boxing to fight. everyone loves wong, except his father, who sees  him as a disgrace to the family, because of his blantantly drunkeness.

In fact, wong's father and wong scenes together are absolute hilarious. in fact, there are a couple of scenes, where both father and son, both fight with one another. Eventually, through coincedence wong finds out about the  smuggling operation and he and he and his friends plan to put a stop to it.

The action is very intense and almost takes the form of a cartoon with wong drinking and gettting drunk then using the alchohol and mixing it with fire to often burn his enemies.

The last bits near the end feature a great match between wong and the boss of the operation.

The acting is equally as well, obviously it's an ode to the old fashioned ways of the east,

with the strict relations Wong has with his Dad and tradition.

Some of the stunts though are incredibly dangerous and make you wonder, just how they filmed it with no getting killed such as the sequences where Wong fights

a gang of men with axes.

There is a dvd for the movie too, however both the vhs and DVD have an English  dubbed version of the film which can be both funny and mediocre at time with the  usual American jokes thrown in to replace the Asian dialogue.

The Dvd comes loaded with extra features, including  and interview with Jackie Chang, and several

trailers for many of Chang's movies.

I am actually going to watch it again, because it's the type of film where there is so  much action and it goes by so fast it's hard to keep track of what's going on, but

a great action movie and a great comedy there isn't a low spot in this movie.  Off the start there is amazing fight sceens that are keeping your attention, but not without some story line and, Jackie Chans hillarious personality.  But what is truly great about this movie would be that it starts with great action and continuously gets better, when its time for the end fight sceen you can't imagine any better action but youll be amazed again, and what i liked was the little to no use of wires in this movie contrary to many other kung fu movies.  It really adds a reality to the action in a way.
What is also great is the well played characters even with the movie dubed it is still acted well enouph to make it a good movie.  Not to mention the dubing adds to much of the comedy without being too cheesy.

After the first 30 minutes I thought it was good because of the sword fight in the beginning which was awesome. Then about 30 minutes later I got a little disapointed because the fighting wasn't the greatest at that point. Right after an hour of the movie it gets great. Best action ever occurs here. He fights like a hundred men. Kind of what the Lord of the Rings:The Two Towers was like. All the enemies had axes and they were coming through windows and every opening. It was awesome. Jackie and his other friend starting fighting. I'm not going to tell you any more about that.
Then at the 15 scene which is 15 minutes long he fights throughout the whole thing. When he's fighting the one boss guy its unbelievable. The enemy is swinging his foot and its making a whistle sound because he's swinging his foot so fast.
Basically whenever Jackie Chan drinks in the movie he gets very hyper and stuff and starts fighting better then anyone else. This is a great action movie overall.
I give it a 9/10. Loses a point for the dubbing because the talking ain't that great dubbed.

807152,5,6304151225,"Hailed by many as the greatest Kung-Fu film ever to grace the jade screen, this sequal makes its mark twice in Asian cinema history. First, The Legend of Drunken Master (Drunken Master II) is the sequal to the most important Kung-Fu comedy of all time, the original Drunken Master. Secondly, this film sees Jackie Chan returning to the Period Kung-Fu movie, a genre that he has kind of ""ignored"" for a little bit more than a decade. Clearly, this film has found its place in history.
Now I'm sure many of you already know the premise by now, so I won't bother describing it for all of you (if you haven't seen this movie by now, shame on you!) The original title of this movie is Drunken Master II and was made in 1994. Disney then picked up the North American distribution rights (Disney...why Disney?!?) and re-released it here as The Legend of Drunken Master, complete with English dubbing and a new soundtrack, although the usual hack job surprisingly hasn't been done here. Jackie returns to his role as a trouble-making version of Wong Fei-Hung, a role that he excels at with his very expressive face. All of the actors are very good, especially Anita Mui and Ti Lung, who both play the role of Jackie's parents. The story is simple and easy to follow, and all of the fantastic fight scenes are all placed logically within the story itself. The action is second to none here, with Jackie and others using various styles of Kung-Fu. But the real selling point here is the incredible final battle between Jackie and his real-life bodyguard Kenneth Lo. This fight took three months to make, and the result is truly breathtaking.
The DVD is quite good, I suppose, for a Disney-released Martial Arts film. The picture quality is really good compared to some of the overseas releases of the original movie. The soundtrack is totally changed, but its not bad at all, although it and the sound effects lack the ""punch"" of the original. Extras include 12 trailers for various Disney Martial Art re-releases, but for some reason The Legend of Drunken Master trailer isn't one of them. The DVD also includes a short interview with Jackie Chan himself about the movie. Nothing special here.
The Legend of Drunken Master is a masterpiece, no matter how its packaged or titled. If you can get your hands on the original Cantonese version, then don't hesitate to pick it up. But if you're like me and stuck with buying these inferior North American versions, then by all means pick this one up too.",1050624000,5,2489,4.684931506849315

The sad thing is this edition is dubbed in English.  There is no Chinese version.  When I first saw this movie, I watched the laserdisc edition (which is in Chinese, but unfortunately has white subtitles that are often over a white background).  While I'm greatful for the opportunity to finally figure out what they're saying, the acting was definitely better in Chinese.  I'm hoping that one day they'll put out a special edition with both versions, but I'm not gonna hold my breath.  In short, if you ever get the chance to see it in Chinese I say go for it, but for now get this version.  It's still a great movie!

The movie's Martial art fight scenes were great and the story line even better.  Chan plays the mischievous youth, Wong Fei Hung who is a master of Drunken Style. Confusion between two packages leaves Chan with the imperial seal and the British Lords who have stole the seal with Ginseng.  A single imperal guard has been following the seal which leads to an incredible spear and sword scene underneath the stationary train.  The imperal guard will take the package which Chan swing leaving him with Ginseng instead of the Imperial Seal.  The movie colors,  terrain scenery, energy of the masses, colors of the train and country side are amazing.
One of the bosses men recognizes Hung and a fight occurs. It is during this fight Hung drinks wine to increase his strength and demostrates his orthodox fight style effectively defeating the group.  Its impressive how effortlessly Hung tosses around the men.  The fight choregraphy is good, but it gets better as the movie continues.  Eventually the bosses will discover Chan leading to a confrontation, capturing, and beating both Hung and his loyal friend.  Hung challenges British sovereign Lords, who want their stolen emperorial seal back, for which Hung has gained possession.  Hung's father will negoitate their release.  This will lead to tensions between the father ending in Hung banishment from the family.  Hung redeems himself and eventually comes back into good terms with his father.  Prior to return to his family, a worker rebellion involving Hung breaks out in violence against the Bosses, and incredible fight scene transforms Hung into inpentratrable force as he fights an hundreds of men with axes who get knocked out the window by Hung,  Hung defends himself from the second floor and manages to isolate himself from the mobs below by kicking down a stairway lead to the second floor.  Tragically the imperial guard is killed attempting to protect Hung.  The movie sets a precedence which movies like ""Croaching Tiger"" seem to emulate.  Unless you understand Chinese you may find the caption difficult to keep up but its not bad on a large screen.

But it has the best idea, and certainly the bets fights!  Chan is Wong Fei Hung, an real-life Chinese hero who is not only a drunken master, but a doctor.  In this movie, Wong Fei Hung is a young man who is not only reckless, but disobediant.  Despite his father's wishes, he beats the [heck] out of the baddies using drunken boxing.  The more he drinks, the more butt he kicks!  But is he drinking too much?  Buy this DVD and be amazed at the best fights ever to grace....ANYWHERE!!",1033862400,,659,4.300813008130081

Jackie plays Wong Fei Hong and Fei-Hong gets in trouble when evil Chinese (the type wearing suits, those Westernized bastards) steal national treasures for export to the West. Fei-Hong gets involved when he accidentally acquires a jade seal in a wacky suitcase mix-up. When the bad guys try to recover it Jackie Chan-type stunts and fights ensue.
The fight sequence will leave you breathless, The choreography is creative and the stuntwork is full of jaw-dropping, painful moments that look even worse when you see the obligatory Jackie Chan outtakes. For fans of Jackie Chan fighting flicks, this movie is an instant classic.
And the supporting cast , Li Tung , Anita Mui and Andy Tak Wah Lau!!! he's just a cameo tho. Chin Kar-Lok, Lau Kar-Leung, and Jackie's bodyguard/member of his stunt crew Ken Lo.

807284,3,6304151225,"Fans of Jackie Chan and the martial arts genre will relish the many fight scenes as well as the comedic performance of this film.
The story revolves around a son trying to win his father's approval, the smuggling of Chinese antiquities out of China into England, and the legitimization of a form of martial arts known as ""drunken boxing.""  The story is not the frame of the story, but merely a device to hold the action scenes together.  The fight in the steel factory and the fight under the train are tour de force.
Unless you simply want to watch to fast action and masterful fighting, I would not recommend this film.  There is not enough of a plot to really get involved with the film.",1028764800,,690,4.4603174603174605
807285,4,6304151225,"Jackie Chan is the trouble prone son of a local doctor and martial
arts instructor.  In an attempt to help his Dad avoid paying taxes on some
ginseng he is bringing home for one of his patients, Jackie stows the root
in luggage belonging to a local political official.  When he attempts to
retrieve it, he finds someone else digging in the same baggage and a battle
ensues.  Jackie is stymied at every turn, even when he uses his famous
Drunken Boxing, but finally retrieves the precious package and makes it back
to the train as it is leaving the station.
 Unfortunately as all Jackie Chan fans can figure, Jackie got the
wrong box.  It seems the official was smuggling out a famous Chinese
artifact and the man who was going through the luggage was a special
investigator trying to get evidence.  This local official is using the
factory in Jackie's town to hide all the other relics he has stolen and
becomes enraged when he discovers the theft has been committed.  He ships
his men all over town searching and they final track down Jackie and his
spitfire step-mother and try to steal the artifact back.  Jackie is a ball
of fire rolling through the group but is vastly outnumbered. His step-mother
takes matters into her hands and begins throwing bottles of liquor at him
since what could better help a master of Drunken Boxing than getting drunk.
 Jackie ends up beating the gang and disgracing his father in the
process who has always told him not to use this style.  His father knows
that many practitioners of this style end up as drunks in the end and
worries the same will happen to his son.
 Finally Jackie is forced into helping rescue some of his friends who
are trapped in the factory.  The battle that follows is a dazzling display
of Drunken Boxing at it's finest.
 This movie succeeds at all levels.  It doesn't promise any hidden
agenda and fail to deliver.  It promises a martial arts packed movie with
dazzling stunts and comedy to boot...and it works.  Jackie was trained in
the Hong Kong Opera at an early age and his talents are never more on
display.  The opening fight which takes part under a train is something that
must be seen to be believed.  The two combatants use a spear and a sword in
their battle and basically are in a crouch the entire length of the car.
Subsequent scenes incorporating the drunken movies are both hilarious and
awesome in the ease of the choreography.
 Another good point for this movie is the dubbing is better than any
many I have seen.  They even allow Jackie to dub his own voice which is
something that doesn't always happen for English speaking foreign actors.
As usual with a Jackie Chan movie you must also watch the deleted scenes
that are shown during the credits.",1024531200,,2730,4.566735112936345

The only reason I had to give this particular movie a 4 star instead of a 5 is because they cut out the last scene in the movie and like many kungfu movies that has be re-released in the US, it doesn't include the original chinese Audio version. Always English and French. I usually prefer the original everything with subtitles.
Anyway, this movie includes everything from dramatic scenes to mind blowing action scenes and many funny scenes as well. Even the title ""Drunken Master"" sounds funny if you really think about it. One thing I would recommend though is watching the Original Drunken Master movie. Although the original movie was was made like 20 years ago and so its not a very high adrenaline pumping type action movie, it does however show how and why Jackie (Wong Fei-hung) leanred the drunekn boxing martial arts.
I strongly recommend this movie for any Jackie Chan fan. And if you are one of those people who want the original chinese dvd copy, I would recommend you buy it soon. I know of three companies that have made this movie into DVD (that has the original title) and I only know one that still manufactures the DVDs.",1017964800,3,1326,4.59915611814346

The main advantage of the American release is the 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen. In fact, it's the only advantage. Rather than buy this version, I got the Hong Kong version, with the original language track (I hate dubbing), and the original music and sound effects. The H.K. DVD is only 1.78:1 widescreen, but I still feel, overall, that it's heads and shoulders over the US release. I still won't take a star off for all the US version's faults, because the movie itself is what counts, and it's insurmountable.

The more Hung drinks the mor agile and stronger he becomes, and trust me, the 1st time you see Chan chug a bottle of boze during mid fight it'll put a smile on your face for the remainder of the movie.
As with any kung fu movie, the fight sequences are the real stars in this movie. Each fight secne fells fresh and not to mention heart pumping fun. This movies has the best Jackie Chan fights and some of the best fights in an action movie period.

807344,5,6304151225,"This film has several formats.  The VHS version from 1994 is the one you want to see!  It is the perfect movie! It's also Jackie's perfect movie! This is a sequel, with 20 years between but Chan manages to look and act much younger.  It is not difficult to accept him as being ""young Wong Fei - hung"". The only connection between the two films is Jackie and drunken boxing. Ti Lung is his father and Anita Mui is ""Mom"" (actually Fei - Hung's mother is dead).  Anita darn near steals the show!  This is a fantastic film! It is a period film, with unscrupulous people stealing as many Chinese treasures a possible. Chan accidentally gets involved in helping to stop the thefts and ends up taking on some major bad guys including Ken Lo in a steel factory. In my opinion the extended fight sequence is the absolute best, with
""Wheels On Meals"" fight with Benny coming in a close second.
The final fight has Jackie battling a number of people before he squares off with Ken Lo.  (Lo is a major talent in the kickboxing world and stands out as one of the best.) Jackie had some differences of opinion with the director and the final fight is designed by Jackie and it shows! It is powerful yet graceful..furious but with purpose.  It is beyond excellent!
This film has something for everyone.  In addition to Jackie's excellent fighting there are plenty of laughs, and more intricate plot than with many of his movies.  There is a scene with Ti Lung and Chan that is poignant and feels very real. But it is the fight scene in the steel factory that will have you rewinding a dozen times.  I have two MAJOR criticisms of the US release,primarily Disney's decision to throw out the the soundtrack and musical score! The music from the original is perfect and part of the whole feel of the film.  There never was a valid explanation from Disney as to why they dumped the original score. Jackie dubbed his voice for Fei - hung, but the dialogue is not the same! Some might be attributed to the difficulty in translation but in some scenes the dialouge has been radically changed.  Disney also cut out the very end of the movie as they felt it was offensive. But that leads to an abrupt end to the film. I have no problem with cutting that scene though and it does not change the film.
One of my all time favorite movies! This one should not be missed!",1015632000,6,2342,4.420930232558139

You could watch such a film with mute on the entire time and it wouldn't appreciably diminish the experience.  And what is that experience?  The FIGHTING.  Period.  And it doesn't get any better than this film.
There are two major fight scenes in this film that are simply the most remarkable works of martial arts choreography I have ever witnessed.  The timings, the coordination of it all is absolutely perfect.  This roughly 30 combined minutes of film are the only excuse you need to watch this movie.  You'll enjoy the whole thing, of course -- it's a somewhat silly, tongue-in-cheek movie -- but it's all about the fighting, and every fight in this film is amazing.  Then comes the crazy restaurant scene where Jackie and one other take on an armada of axe-wielding psychos.  And just when you start wondering if that can be surpassed, here comes the 20-minute final fight.  It's beyond amazing.  It's godlike.  I am left still wondering how the timings are so absolutely perfect.
If you truly care about the dialogue, go find an original tape to rave about.  (Really, there's barely enough dialogue in this film to matter, dubbed or otherwise.)

The action hardly takes a breath, and you can tell that Chan has to ""tone-down"" when doing American films, because he is down right fast and jerky. This movie proves it! Watch Bruce Lee, then watch Jackie...who's faster?
Chan uses an endless amount of instrument's, whatever he can get his hand's on, in jovial and powerful act's of martial art's rhythm.

It is traditional action with some hardcore hits and thuds, all at the same fast crazy pace.  Lots of Kung-fu stances, kicks, punches, blocks, weird fast twists, and Jackie's own stuff.  Not many stunts like jumping car to car or off a building but there are lots of one on one stunts.  There are lots of body bashing and brutal hits!!!
The wire works are pretty cool in this too (yes, Jackie does use wires sometimes, one is obvious to see on Jackie's back in the last one on one battle scene in the movie).  Wire works are bad in my mind when it is obvious that the body is being swung, but wires work their magic when down fast and well which this movies does.

The Legend of Drunken Master (US title) portrays the well-known hero, Wong Fei-Hong (also portrayed by Jet Li in the ""Once Upon a Time in China"" series, as well as many others) in an incredible period piece where Jackie reputedly had to practice and study intensively to develop his own more exciting and acrobatic form of drunken style Chinese gung-fu.  Each fight scene is extensively choreographed and the storyline is both well acted and amusingly humorous.  Anita Mui plays a comedic aunt role and you'll notice Lui Kang of Mortal Kombat fame having a good dose of screen time, only to have his fight scene minimized.  According to the Jackie Chan crew, he was simply unable to match the rhythmic tempo required in Hong Kong style fight scenes and instead, Jackie opted to highlight the skills of his own personal body guard (with the lightning feet).  The Legend of Drunken Master will appeal to anyone wanting a break from the wire work of the Matrix style fight scenes prevelent today. As w/all Jackie's work, nothing is sped up and no wires are used for those flying jumps.  It's one of the top selling movies in Asia of all time.

807478,5,6304151225,"This film is regarded by afficianados as Jackie Chans best film.  After watching it I understand why.
Like most of Chans films, a mixup sets the stage for many a martial arts battle.  Another underlying Chan theme prevalent in this film is the stealing of China's culture for profit.  Chan's real-life body guard plays the main nemesis whom he takes on in a breath taking fight sequence that reportedly took several months to film. I have seen the subtitled version of this film and it is slightly better than the dubbed.  They changed the politically incorrect ending of the subtitled version, which shows Jackie slobbering in a stupor after drinking way too much alcohol.
Some fight highlights of this film include a spear fight under a train, several drunken fights, a quick battle with a chain weilding iron worker, and a restaurant brawl with hundreds of swarming goons.

Trying to stop British (a throw back to the days of British ownership of Hong Kong?)smugglers and poor factory conditions of his friends, Jackie Chan's recreation of Wong Fei Hung has fast paced, exciting kung fu featuring some of the most ecxiting, intense fighting sequences ever filmed (in the restaurant and steel mill scenes).  Although peppered with the usual out of sync dubbing made famous by these imports, the voice of Hung is the actual voice of Chan!

When The Legend of Drunken Master came out in store shelves on DVD, I went on and bought the movie and when I played it on my DVD player, I was impressed with the fact that they used the actual voice of Jackie Chan and the fact that the movie mixes comedy and martial arts action.

Not only is the voice acting horrible, they changed the ending.  I won't give it away for those who have not seen it yet, but personally I liked the original ending much better.

Dubbing in any movie (except maybe something on the level of Godzilla) is unacceptable. Secondly, Anita Mui, who plays Chan's stepmother, is annoying beyond distraction.  She ruins every scene that she's in with her vaudeville shtick. I love Jackie Chan and he goes to extraordinary personal lengths in this film to deliver an exciting product. However, the great fight scenes aren't enough to overcome the limp humor that plagues this film.

The jokes in Legend of Drunken Master (II) are much cheaper and lamer.  I reccomend that Dimension release the original Drunken Master but this time with a subtitle option!

Having seen the original movie on the big screen (and also being the proud owner of a VHS copy), I was looking forward to this release on DVD.  Unfortunately, I feel this US release destroys what must be one of Jackie Chan's top 5 movies.
The translated dialogue is terrible.  Not just the translations, but the voice actors they recruited sound like Chinese actors speaking bad English.  If this was a real US release of the movie for US consumption, why not make the dialogue intelligible?  As someone who speaks both Cantonese and English, I found the dialogue difficult to follow and just blatantly wrong.  They rob the subtle (and sometimes not so subtle) comedy which runs through the entire movie.  If they couldn't get good script writers to translate it properly, at least they could have used people who spoke with an American accent.  I would almost go as far to be insulted by the chop-soky English used in this release.
The soundtrack is also noticably absent.  By robbing the fight scenes of their original score, they remove the excitement and drama from the entire movie.  You may not always appreciate how much a soundtrack does for a movie, but this US release truly underscores this point.
Believe me, I wanted to like this movie.  I was just so disappointed with what they had done to this movie.
I hope you do not buy this DVD.  You should look for either the Hong Kong release of the VHS, Laserdisc, or DVD.",984441600,91,1614,4.647887323943662
807642,5,6304151225,"Having seen both the orginal Chinese version of the film and the newly dubbed version, I recommend either.  This newly redubbed version of the 1994 film serves Chan well ( a tasteless final shot depicting Chan is a questionable state was thankfully removed from the english version of the film).  This film stands as a testament to what a human being is capable of.  Though The Legend of Drunken Master is not as good a film as many of Chan's earlier ones (Project A, Police Story, Mr. Canton and Lady Rose), it has an energy rarely seen in films.  The fight scenes are non-stop and breathtaking.  For example, Chan and the director Lau Kar Leung fight a gang called the Axe Gang in a restaurant.  After about 20 minutes of non-stop fighting, Chan and Leung dispose of the entire gang, which easily has a hundred members.  Highly recommended!!!",982195200,,844,4.662162162162162

This is actually ""Drunken Master II"", and it is jam-packed with great action and comedy. I don't think you've seen Jackie at his best until you see that last fight scene.
If I remember correctly, this originally came out in 1994, and was a sequel to the 1979 ""Drunken Master"". It features a redone dubbing that is probably better than the original dubbing available. Jackie Chan did his own voice, if I recall. My one complaint is that this version probably will not feature a subtitled edition (with the original Chinese audio), and the company that did release a subtitled version no longer holds the rights to release it.

While Bruce Lee was the best Martial Artist  ever, his movies were average in regards to their fight choreography. No one  could ever touch him in his films. The fight choreography in ""Drunken  Master 2"" was incredible. It was realistic because there were almost  no wire stunts involved and the fight scenes were fantastic. The fight  scene with Jackie and Liu Chia Liang (Lau Kar Leung) in the beginning was  pure poetry in motion. The final fight scene was fifteen minutes of pure  adrenaline pumping action. Unique choreography makes this movie a classic.  Unlike Jet Li's characterization of Wong Fei Hung, Jackie makes Fei Hung  seem more human and vulnerable. Nobody could ever touch Jet Li in the  ""Once Upon a Time in China"" series. Plus some of the moves just  look so ridiculously fake. ""Fist of Legend"" is Jet's best movie  because it isn't as fake and he actually has to fight hard to win. However,  it is still only the second best film ever made. Not to criticize any other  reviewer, but since when does the ability to do 540's and 720's and  Butterfly kicks make a martial art film great? I have been involved in  Martial Arts for over a 20 years and would love for someone to try to fight  me using those kicks.

I understood about 30-40% of it and was really looking forward to  seeing it with English subtitles...I understood more when I saw it in  Japan.

If they had put them in the black border the white  subtitles would have been perfectly legible even though they squeezed two  languages in.

He  spent ten years training in classical Chinese Opera and if you've ever read  his book or know a thing or two about Chinese Opera, then you know that it  was brutal. If you're a Jackie Chan fan, or just a martial arts fan, then I  highly recommend that you pick this movie up.",946944000,8,796,4.549295774647887
807788,5,6304151225,The movie continued the great saga from ther orignal movie. The fighting was beautiful and the plot was as great. I watch the movie ever week and still is impressed.,945216000,2,165,4.533333333333333
807789,5,6304151225,This is easily the best Jackie Chan film ever! The fight scenes are just jaw dropping. Immediately after I first saw this a couple of years ago I rewound the tape and watched it again. A definite must see for fans and  non-fans alike!,942883200,,234,4.318181818181818
807790,5,6304151225,"If your reading this review you're probably aware of who Jackie Chan is. If you never seen Drunken Master 2 I recommend that you make it your mission to see it. What can I say that hasn't already been said? As far as  Kelly Magovern's review goes: Ignore it. It's completely juvenile anyways,  with comments like ""bust a move"" it's no doubt the criticism of a  13 year-old who watches too much MTV. You can't even compare Jet Li to  Jackie Chan. Jackie is so successful because not only is he a great martial  artist, but also a talented actor, writer, director, producer, stunt  choreographer and comedian. You really can't even compare the two. Jet Li  owes whatever success he has in America to Jackie. I have respect for Jet  Li as a fine martial artist, but martial arts alone doesn't make a great  film.",942796800,5,809,4.524137931034483
807791,5,6304151225,"Finally Jackie returned to what made him a star! Don't get me wrong his super-stunts are spectacular but eye-popping kung-fu is far more entertaining. This is the perfect mix of Hong-Kong humor, action and drama,  from Fei-Hung's comic antics to his moving relationship with his father to  the climactic battle with Ken Lo, this movie is a martial arts titan  suitable for the whole family!",941500800,2,390,4.969230769230769
807792,5,6304151225,"This is my favorite movie of all time.  The action and fight choreography to this movie are so fast and powerful, that you'll be either frozen in awe, or jumping in excitement.  This movie has more too: the acting is very  good, the humor is very funny, and the setting is perfect.  I have seen  many martial arts movies of all types, from the Shaw Bros. productions - to  the new Hong Kong films of the present, and I have to say that this is the  greatest Martial Arts Film Ever!  I have seen ""Fist of Legend"",  ""Enter the Dragon"", ""Once Upon a Time in a China"",  ""Iron Monkey"", and countless others, but Drunken Master 2  surpasses them in every aspect, especially the fight choreography.  Every  fight is a sight to behold.  Too many new Martial Arts movies these days  use strings and camera tricks too much, but Jackie kept it realistic, and  what a difference it makes!  When I watched the end fight scene to this  film, I couldn't blink, and my jaw had dropped open in amazement.  The  fight scene in the end is the most earth-shattering, mind-boggling,  jaw-dropping, incredibly amazing fight I have ever seen.  I still get  chills when I see it.  This movie is a blessing.  Thank You, Jackie Chan.",938563200,5,1207,4.502325581395349
807793,3,6304151225,"This movie is completely boring! I was so emotionally univolved with the characters. People told me how great the martial arts was in this film. It ain't all that! Jet Li's ""Fist of Legend"" had way better martial  arts. Jackie Chan never even busts any cool tricks like butterfly twist or  720's or anything. Even Jet Li will at least bust some capoeira. The same  old Jackie Chan fast hands. I'm tired of it! Bust a side swipe or a  double-leg 540 and then we'll see who's talking, Jackie! I'll give him a  few stars for encouragement. --Kelly Magovern",936230400,,553,4.545454545454546
807794,5,6304151225,"I never really knew or heard of Jackie Chan until Rumble in the Bronx finally came out here in the US. Then that was it....I had to go on my journey to see as much of Jackie Chan as I could. I so recently came upon a  bunch of rereleases of his movies here in the states. In that batch of  rereleases I found Drunken Master 2.
This movie is so good, I cant even  stress how good it is. I got a copy of a very poor quality of Drunken  Master 1 and was highly disappointed at the quality it ruined the movie for  me (but still had great fight scenes non the less). Then when I got Jackie  Chan: My Story and saw that he did a brand new Drunken Master made in the  90's I was all over it. I rushed out and bought right away. And so should  you. Ever since I've seen it I have been practicing/ goofing off with  Drunken Boxing. Once you see it you will too, it is such a fascinating  style of martial arts.
Well to wrap it up, the movie has a great story,  excellent stunts, top notch fights, and a finale like no other to boot. Buy  it as soon as you get a chance!",935884800,,1061,3.861111111111111
807875,5,6304151225,"There comes a time in a kung-fu movie actors career when he just can't do any more, not this kung-fu movie actor.  Jackie Chan at the ripe old age of 40 returns to play the character that made him famous almost 20 years  ago.
  Jackie plays Wong-Fei-Hung a old chinese folk heroe who while  travelling back from a Chinese town mistakes his fathers ginseng, for a  priceless Chinese antique.  Jackie becomes tangled in a British plot to  steal and sell Chinese antiques.  The action heats up as we see one of  the finest fight sequence's ever put on celluloid!",926553600,,559,4.555555555555555
807876,5,6304151225,"Drunken Master II reveals human potential to achieve mastery in martial arts through it's perfectly timed and complex, traditional Chinese Kung Fu choreography.  Swift and swirling, Chan's renowned ability takes its place  above any other martial arts oriented movie as the absolute best.  Sure,  wires are used, but the viewer will realize such added extras are there  only to add effect, not effectiveness.  And, as is often the case in Jackie  Chan's pictures, the final confrontation between heroine and villain will  amaze and bewilder in its length and simultaneous grace and power.  Ridiculously repetitive machine gun kicks vs. drunken boxing's everflowing  combination of circular movement and spontaneity.",924480000,,715,5.598130841121495
807877,5,6304151225,I thought this film was incredible.  The feel of the period was captured faithfully.  The cinematography was pretty impressive in parts (especially the opening scenes of the train) and the action was unbelievable.  Each  fight scene is better than the last.  I could go on with the superlatives  but you're better off to buy this film and see for yourself.  If you are  the slightest bit interested in Jackie Chan or martial arts movies you will  not be disappointed.,923961600,,467,4.810126582278481
807938,5,6304151225,"Some martial film critics say that Jet Li's ""Shaolin Temple"" is the best martial art movie ever made. Personaly, I disagree, I love Shaolin Temple. However, it does not posses the complexity that DM2 posses.  Everything in this film is great tha acting, the sets, the story, stunts,  the kung-fu. No wires, thank god, Jackei is one of the only HK actors that  hardly uses wires for assistance. Even Jet li does, ( go and see  Black  Mask), Mr. Chan sticks with the traditional more realistic Hung-gar/Drunkard  Boxing. Yet there is a flaw , He should of shaved is head to look more like  Wong Fei-Hong. Maybe, Dimensions/Miramax are smart enough to release this  film in the theaters, to show the American Audience what is Jackie chne  realy made off.",921974400,,751,4.7153846153846155
807939,5,6304151225,"Drunken Master 2's greatest smarts is to stick closely to the source of all martial-arts movies:  Chinese folklore and literature.  The tone of Chinese literature -- its sense of fun, cultural specificity, kinetic  pacing and narrative economy --serves as the model for Drunken Master 2,  and it fits like a glove, giving the viewer the perfect environment in  which to enjoy Jackie Chan's athleticism and charisma.
And yes, the  choreography.  Combine director Lau Ka-leung's traditional Chinese fighting  techniques and Jackie's knack for speed, and you have the most cinematic  fight sequences ever filmed.  The climactic battle in the steel factory  doesn't contain a single slow-motion shot (the chain-and-shackle of most  Hong Kong-produced fight movies), instead giving us exhilirating,  uninterrupted sequences of sheer energy mixed with occasional touches of  perfectly timed humour that never takes away from the urgency of the  conflicts.
Add that to Anita Mui's hilarious comic relief, sumptuous  sets, and top-notch music, and you have Jackie Chan's best film ever.",918691200,6,1078,5.561728395061729
807940,5,6304151225,Jackie Chan cant do any better then this.  Crazy old school Jackie action returns in this drunken classic.  The sheer speed at which all action is done in this movie is amazing.  Bienge Drinking and martial arts all wraped  up into one movie.  This movie dominates over all other old school martial  arts movies.  Arm the Homeless,916876800,,330,4.684210526315789
807941,5,6304151225,"Clearly both the pinnacle of Hong Kong cinema, Jackie Chan's work, and the best action movie ever filmed. (Its period setting, humor, comedy, and lack of gore make it a good 'date' movie, too.) Like Casablanca, it has a  leading actor who is 20 years too old for his role and the movie's actual  production was a mismash, but it soars. Many other movies have one or two  great action stunts, but this movie is nearly continuous action and  predicaments, graced by Chan's humor. His gentle, Chaplinesque hero becomes  a martial arts master only when drunk.",913939200,,555,4.739583333333333
