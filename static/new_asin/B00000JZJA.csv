1239611,3,B00000JZJA,"This is a movie to get after you've seen Yuen Wo Ping's ""Iron Monkey.""  This is a solid effort, but not as essential as ""Iron Monkey"" or Lin's ""Bride With White Hair."" Ms. Lin is wonderful as usual.  Here she plays a power-mad prince's assassin, whose character grows more sympathetic as the film progresses. Solid action, with a fair amount of wire work (I like that).  The humor's a bit broad, but not as distracting as in other HK films.
Note: I believe the correct name of the film is ""Fire Dragon.""  Trust me, there is no child fighter in this flick, on fire or otherwise (and isn't that a good thing?).",988156800,2,608,4.401785714285714
1239612,4,B00000JZJA,"put down 4 stars but I really wanted to put down 4.5. this is an excellent movies, and while the fighting scenes in this movie aren't as plentiful as most martial arts movies its the acting of of brigitte Lin and the other supporting stars made up for it. the fight scenes i must comment on though. they were extremely superb, clean, crisp, just totally awesome. the choice of screen shots were excellent. this is one of the best movies I have ever seen in my life and would highly recommend it to anyone starting out in the martial arts genre.",984873600,3,544,4.396039603960396
1239613,5,B00000JZJA,"I read several different reviews on the web before purchasing this movie(about six different reviews)and while there were mixed reactions everyone said that the fight scenes were fantastic. And were they ever. This  is definitley one of the four best fight scene movies available today,the  list goes like this:Tai-Chi Master,Fire Dragon,Fist of Legend,and Iron  Monkey(93).While I said choreography wise Tai-Chi Master was Yuen  Woo-Ping's fight scene master-piece , Fire Dragon does rank up in the same  category and should be taken very seriously. I cannot imagine the ammount of  time and effort that probably went into puting together some of these fight  scenes that are so action filled,intricate,and origional that it will blow  you away. This movie is also the newest Yuen-Woo Ping movie I have seen(95)  so all the special effects used have also come a long ways and it  shows,sporting the best special effects he has used in a movie of his. While  the story may have gave some people some issues to talk about ,I found it  very attractive and entertaining through-out. But even if this movie had no  story at all, and all they did was just splice together all the fight  scenes I would still dish out the money for this movie(the fight scenes are  truly that good).This was the first movie in a long time that I saw that  took me about an hour longer to watch than the actual length of the movie  because I had to keep rewinding all the great fight scenes. DON'T PASS THIS  ONE UP,A MUST OWN FOR FIGHT SCENE LOVERS!Bottom line is that Yuen Woo-Ping  has out done himself here and truly proves that he is the master of  choreography.",958176000,14,1643,4.75886524822695

7913900,5,B00000JZJA,"If you like this type of movie (and I love them), don't miss out on ""Fire Dragon"". Especially if you're a Brigitte Lin fan (and I love Brigitte Lin!): I don't care if she's not really a martial artist, Yuen Woo-ping can make anyone look awesome in a fight! And the action is fantastic in this movie. No, it's not continuous fight scenes from beginning to end (THAT WOULD BE LIKE WRITING WITH THE CAPSLOCK ON), but there's plenty of imaginative, mind-boggling battles.

Brigitte Lin plays a fire-using swordswoman (her nickname literally translates as ""Fire Cloud Evil God"") who is an assassin for the power-crazed Sixth Prince. As she says, she was brought up not to distinguish between good and evil people, but only to know her owner. (Reminiscent of ""Unleashed/Danny the Dog"", except Brigitte Lin is prettier than Jet Li!) When she chases ""righteous"" swordsman Ming for a piece of evidence that would incriminate her master, she (along with Ming) ends up undercover among the ""normal folks"". This being a Hong Kong fantasy flick, ""normal"" means a troupe of crazy comedy-relief Chinese circus types. There they also run into a cop (the brother of the circus leader) who works for the prime minister, one of the few honest people in the government. Just as the assassin starts to appreciate life as an ordinary person, her younger ""sister"" (i.e. the Prince's junior assassin) shows up, and everything goes to hell... A good story, well told, and I was genuinely moved by the sentimental romantic elements.

Things I love about this movie:

* The fire powers are beautifully realized. It looks perfectly natural here when someone sets a piece of paper on fire with a flick of the wrist, shoots out fireballs, makes a burning blade, extinguishes fire with a swish of her cape, knocks down trees with a single blow, etc.  Looks way better than cheesy modern CGI would!

* It's cool to see a glimpse of traditional Chinese entertainment with the acrobats and the spinning plates and the drummers and so on.

* Instant costume/hairstyle change: Spiderman would be jealous. Well, the costume change thing has been done before, but it's especially awesome this time because she SETS HER OLD COSTUME ON FIRE (while midair)! And it vanishes in a puff of smoke! Even better, she somehow regenerates it later when she needs to be in her assassin outfit again!

* The part where the circus leader (in a fit of jealousy) tries to threaten Brigitte's character, but then realizes she is outmatched in every way. Brigitte relents and gives her a makeover! A hint: Do NOT take beauty advice from someone you were waving a knife at a minute ago! BAD BAD IDEA!

* The final battle is way, way, way over the top. Fire! Burning oil! More fire! Can we have any more fire? I know, let's have someone throw sticks of dynamite! Fire AND explosions! Did I mention there was a lot of fire?

* Brigitte Lin. Without her acting skills, this might have just been a formulaic sword and sorcery movie with exciting but ultimately meaningless action sequences. Her final duel with her little ""sister"" is especially touching (as well as being fantastically choreographed.) (And the other actors do a great job, too.)

Highly recommended!",1272585600,,3205,4.810909090909091
7913901,5,B00000JZJA,"This has got to be one of the most amazing movie I have ever seen. The Action is none stop, and the plot is pretty good to. With Evil turning good. This Action packed Kung Fu Amazement is Amazing. There are some fire scenes in this movie that must has been very dangerous. I can't imagine doing any of these for a movie.

You can see from the others how amazing it is. I just want to say Get it!",1184457600,,395,3.9375
7913902,5,B00000JZJA,"I have seen many Kung-Fu movies in my time and Fire Dragon ranks #2 on my list of the best fighting kung-fu movie of all time. Woo-ping throws everyhting but the kitchen sink at you in this one.

Brigitte Lin stars as Fire Dragon an unstoppable assassin who uses her hands as flame-throwers and can ignite her sword while weilding it. Her job is to eliminate a master swordsman (Max Mok) who has evidence that will bring down a powerful Fire-master, Prince-Six. This movie strikes a perfect balance between being serious and funny much like Wing Chun. Just when things get too serious, the comic relief is a welcome change, then when the movie starts to drag a bit it gets serious again.

Although the story is good, what seperates this movie from the rest is the superb acting and fighting. Brigitte lin's acting as well as her fighting in this movie is just as convincing as her role in swordsman 2 as invincible asia. Max Mok does a convincing job as a hero and Kwan Ng almost steals the show with her comedic performance.

But what makes this movie shine are the fight scenes. The fighting in this movie has to be seen to be believed. From all the martial-arts movies I have seen, and I have seen many, only one movie has better fight scenes than this. What else would you expect from Woo-ping the great. For example, there is a ferocious fight scene in the forest between Fire Dragon and her best friend Snow, an equally deadly assassin who uses bow and arrows and a grappling chain no less, that features all kinds of destruction including fire-balls, exploding nets and the leveling of trees- great stuff. But the final fight scene, unlike most movies which is a let-down, is absolutely spectacular and the best in the movie. The skill of Prince-Six is frightful as he more than holds his ground against a master swordsman, a baton-wielding, dynamite throwing kung-fu master and Fire Dragon herself-WOW. If I have to rank my top 5 fighting Kung-fu movies of all time, it would be (5)Tai-Chi Master (4)Iron Monkey (3) Swordsman II (2)Fire Dragon (1)Blade of Fury.

In closing, Fire Dragon is a very stylish, hyper-kinetic kung-fu movie, with a good story, great acting and memorable, creative fight scenes that no self-respecting kung-fu fan should be without. Highly recommended.",1139270400,2,2286,4.736180904522613
7913903,5,B00000JZJA,Very good movie!  I bought it after reading some reviews and was real curious about the action.  The fight scenes are quite good (not as many as I'd like) the story was pretty decent too!  I chuckled at a few scenes. Decent humor.  The special effects with the fire were done very well and the fight with snow at the very end was amazing! Not too many people know about this gem!  I'm glad this movie is in my collection!,1072137600,2,421,4.2125
7913904,4,B00000JZJA,"Fire Dragon is the story of  a young man, who stumbles across a dying imperial guard, and is entrusted with a secret letter which implicates Prince Six, a local governor, in a plot to overthrow the prime minister/emperor. (Is there any other kind of evil plot?) Honor bound to carry the message to the imperial court he begins his journey unaware that he  also being stalked by Ah Hsia (Brigitte Lin) , Fire Dragon, a beautiful assassin employed by Prince Six. On the way, the young man takes shelter with a group of circus performers, forcing Fire Dragon to infiltrate the acting group herself. Through friendship with the performers, Fire Dragon begins to question her loyalty to Prince Six.
I really enjoyed Fire Dragon. While it wasn't a particularly deep film, I found the fight scenes to be spectacular, and the acting by Brigitte Lin, Sandra Ng, and Max Mok, to be top notch. The comic relief provided by Ng, and the  circus performers, was great! (I loved the way Ng brow-beats her troupe!) Also,  I found Fire Dragon's duel with her best friend, Snow, moving.
This was a great Kung Fu, film with plenty of action. Excellent.",1037664000,3,1133,4.707070707070707
7913905,5,B00000JZJA,"Get this movie. Plain and simple. From Fire Dragon chopping people and seting them on fire, to a cop using dynamite as num-chuks to the Prince slapping a sword through his own body to hit someone else, this movie has it all! There's a girl shooting arrows out of her clothes, a guy running around on his hands because his legs are paralyzed, and a little bit of a love story too. Prince Six is one of the hardest bad guys I have ever seen. He's worse than Donnie Yen from Dragon Inn!! He's fighting a master swordsman, a dynamite hurling supercop and a flying fighter whose hands are on fire... I give this my highest recomendation!",1037145600,2,632,4.410256410256411
7913906,5,B00000JZJA,"This movie is getting harder to find, so get your copy as soon as possible.  The fire scenes, especially in the beginning, will blow you away.  Brigitte Lin is in top form here and the fights leave you in amazement wondering how they did it.  Brigitte throws fire from her hands and her sword flames up as she unsheathes it.  She strikes a stance with her hand on fire.  Just plain awesome.  Brigitte exudes sex appeal, both in her fight scenes and her more serious role.  If you're a fan of martial arts/sword movies, you MUST own this movie.  ...  Don't let this one escape your collection, you'd be missing out.",1030838400,,614,4.45945945945946
7913907,5,B00000JZJA,"The fighting in this movie is top notch, from begining to end you will be blown away by the fighting and believe it or not the special effects. The way she lights people on fire is done very well for an older movie. Brigitte Lin is my favorite and she is great in this film as always. This is not her best acting work, but I believe it is her best fighting work. If you have never seen her before watch Bride with white Hair the best HK movie ever, if you are a fan like me buy this movie you won't be disapointed.",1010361600,5,514,3.951923076923077
7913908,5,B00000JZJA,"If you liked Swordsman 2, then you'll like this as well I imagine.  This film has great special effects (consider when it was made and where) and outstanding action.  Don't miss this one.",990057600,,187,4.636363636363637
