8121386,3,B000FEC2NO,"For a parent soccer coach who's new to the job, I found this DVD quite useful in teaching some basics. However it could have used a bit more practical info, such as tips on keeping kids' attention (this is my biggest problem) - how to impose some discipline whilst still keeping it ""fun"" - tips on getting kids to talk and work as a team. these seem like important basics that were left out. Another thing that seems amazingly absent on teaching kids to tackle or take away the ball from an opponent. That would have been much more useful than the time spent teaching ""heading"". still I learned some stuff and the instructor is quite good and methodical.",1274227200,,654,4.504201680672269

8121390,5,B000FEC2NO,I started coaching my son's soccer team for the first time this year.  I found this video very helpful for setting up and running my practices.

I took advantage of the ""Parent Soccer Coach"" DVD as a tool for our family's mutual ""Soccer Education"".

This DVD gave us a bunch of great exercises and ideas and inspiration for him. He is six now and is showing amazing ability (if you knew our family's level of athletic talent you'd understand better why I used the word ""amazing."") and I am actually a semi-qualified assistant coach.",1190592000,3,407,4.666666666666667
