5022416,5,B006W95BX4,"This latest Warner Archive collection contains two long unseen, thought lost, Whip Wilson westerns. Worth waiting for, they are all fun to watch. I hope Warners will release more of these collections, especialy those with Rod Cameron and Johnny Mack Brown. Cameron's cinecolor westerns are great.",1332720000,13,296,5.456521739130435
5022417,5,B006W95BX4,"Just when you thought things couldn't get any better, Warner Archives now releases a second volume of Monogram B Westerns, this time three DVD-Rs with six very rare Whip Wilson programmers from the early 1950s, and two more fine Rod Cameron Cinecolor ""super Bs.""  The two Cameron vehicles are: ""Fort Osage"" and ""Wagons West,"" both in decent color and with solid production values, casts and plots. In ""Fort Osage"" the endearing ""heavy"" Morris Ankrum co-stars along with Douglas Kennedy. In ""Wagons West"" look for Noah Beery Jr and Michael Chapin. These are very entertaining oaters, capturing the verve and style of the classic B Western, but with something extra that should please most fans of the genre. Cameron made films for Universal, Republic, Monogram and later Allied Artists (Monogram's successor company), but never receives the due he deserves. In recent years one of his best films,""Panhandle,"" has shown up (in original sepiatone), but we still need releases of his ""Stampede"" and ""Short Grass,"" both excellent and well-produced ""little A"" quality films.

The Whip Wilson features are a special delight. Wilson was not a great actor, but his programmers competed in the early 1950s with other Monogram B-star vehicles, such as the wonderful series with Johnny Mack Brown and the Kirby Grant series (can we please have some more Johnny Mack Brown and perhaps some Kirby Grants? Grant became famous through ""Sky King,"" but he made some fine B Westerns, too). And the Whip Wilson films never fail to entertain. The films included here are: ""Canyon Raiders"" (with Fuzzy Knight and Jim Bannon), ""The Gunman"" (with Fuzzy Knight and Rand Brooks), ""Stage to Blue River"" (with Fuzzy Knight), ""Night Raiders"" (with Fuzzy Knight and Iron Eyes Cody), ""Montana Incident"" (with Rand Brooks), and ""Wyoming Roundup"" (with Tommy Farrell).

Let us hope this series will continue! There are dozens and dozens of fine Johnny Mack Brown features that need to be issued, and much more that Warner may have access to. Along with the superb series of Tim Holt B-Westerns, now three volumes (we still need more, please!), old cowpoke Western fans should be delighted...and just maybe a new generation of viewers will come to enjoy these superb little films that tell us so much about our history, our dreams, and ourselves.",1330214400,26,2312,5.078947368421052
