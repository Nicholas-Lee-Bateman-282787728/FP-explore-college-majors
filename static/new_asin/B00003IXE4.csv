8453371,3,B00003IXE4,"My enjoyment of ""Spell Wars 01"" the much more dramatic continuation of the ""Sorcerer Hunters"" Saga was diminished by the poor audio quality of the dubbed dialogue.  In order to hear the dialogue  in was necessary to increase volume so much that the background music was  as loud as the dialogue, drowning out the conversation. The eyecatch in the  middle of each episode was now much too loud. I've tried this tape in both  my 2head mono VCR and my 4head HiFi VCR with similar results.  Anyone else  have this problem? I wanted to check before trying to get a replacement.  Maybe the subtitled tape this time!",955584000,3,609,4.626168224299065
