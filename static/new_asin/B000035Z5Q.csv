7916982,5,B000035Z5Q,"this is a great box-set, with 3 60-minute-tapes containing the best footage from big city comedy.
It's never been on television here in the Netherlands, but I bought it anyway because I'm a huge John Candy fan.
I wasn't disappointed, it is hilarious; great scenes, great sketches with guest appearances of Joe Flaherty, Billy Crystal, Rita Moreno, Jimmy Walker, Fred Willard, Betty White, Martin Mull, Conrad Bain, Margret Trudeau also starring Tim Kazurinsky, Tino Insana, Don Lamont, Patti Oatman, Audie Neenan.
If you love John Candy, you'll definately love this!
A great collection, every fan should have.
Buy it, you won't be disappointed!",1065571200,,644,5.262135922330097
