7896852,1,6305827591,"I picked up this bargain for 20 cents at a thrift store. And it was OVERpriced at that. Okay, the title fairly much gives the picture away; it's about a hurricane sweeping through the southern states of the USA. Apparently it's a fictional account of an actual hurricane that went though the area creating lots of damage. The stock film used in this (I'm supposing telemovie) is so obviously that that it detracts from an otherwise woeful production. The acting (ahem) is on a par with the stock footage, though, so perhaps it all makes sense.
Being set in the 1970s there are lots of 'era cliches' amok such as the 'swingers' party at the home of an obvious alcoholic.
The airforce is set out to track the storms progression and the people on the land must find refuge as quickly as possible.
Being set and made in the early 70s for television, don't expect too many gory twists at all. It's fairly average fair with it all ending in the best of all possible.... well, you know how that ends.
If you can hire this for free there's no way to stop you. All I can suggest is that you don't buy it.",1525737600,,1095,4.372549019607843

7896856,4,6305827591,"The novel forming the basis for this movie is based upon Hurricane Camille in 1969, and my eldest sister was living in Long Beach, MS at the time. Where I lived at the time, we had hurricane-force winds, with gusts of 90-100 mph. Also, while I have lost count of the exact number of hurricanes, I have been through 8-12, and these include both minor and major ones. Then too, I have studied numerous tropical cyclones (cyclones, hurricanes, and typhoons) from a disaster prevention perspective.

Within this context, the movie missed being great by an obvious misunderstanding of hurricanes, and specific points are as follows: 1. A boat ended up in the eye (center of circulation), and the water was perfectly calm. The reality is that the fierce winds of a hurricane beat down waves outside the eye, but the calm in the eye causes the worst of the waves to be there. 2. The movie showed what appeared to be a fog bank, and this was supposed to be the eye wall. The reality is that the eye wall can be seen only in the clouds, and it is not visible at the ground/sea level. 3. A submarine came under the hurricane, and it surfaced in the eye to rescue the people. The reality is that the average hurricane creates turbulence down to 350 feet, perhaps more, and a submarine coming through it likely would be damaged or destroyed.

Here too, let me point out some good points of the movie, and they were:  1. Alcohol and hurricanes do not mix, and the last thing you want is to be drunk in a hurricane. 2. If you may need to evacuate, do it early, and that way you avoid hazardous conditions or can deal with other exigencies. 3. At that time forecasters could provide accurate projections of hurricanes' paths only out to 12 hours, but today they are accurate out to 36 hours or more. 4. The movie showed heavy rainfall preceding the hurricane, and in particular with Cape Verde class hurricanes (those originating near the Cape Verde Islands), heavy rainfall can precede them by 24-48 hours. Then although it was not reflected in the movie, my family has always stood hurricane watch, and at least one adult is up and fully clothed to deal with any emergencies until after the worst of the hurricane has passed.

Other than the points noted, the movie provided a pretty good representation of a hurricane, the conditions it creates, and it shows how the ignorance, the indifference, or the naivety of people can get them in serious trouble with tropical cyclones. Taking into consideration the deficiencies I noted, it gives a pretty good representation of what a hurricane is like.
