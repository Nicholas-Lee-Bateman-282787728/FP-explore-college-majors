8343554,5,B001UFO924,I watch Good Eats more than I watch Star Trek! WORTH IT! Though I watch Full House more than both of them.,1398902400,,106,3.8636363636363638
8343555,5,B001UFO924,I enjoy all of Alton Browns DVDs! This was a good buy as this included 3 of his popular DVDs.,1377302400,,93,3.7
8343556,4,B001UFO924,This is just a few of his shows put together.  If you own any seasons or intend to then you will have duplicates.  It is a nice assortment but will become a pass-along gift when I get the full seasons.,1365120000,3,201,4.0
8343557,4,B001UFO924,"I like the selection, it includes some commonly used dinner foods. Only three shows per DVD; I wish there were more.",1358208000,3,116,4.571428571428571
8343558,5,B001UFO924,"This is a great video set. I bought it for the bakalava instructions -- and was not disappointed.  Easy to follow instructions with good explanation of why to use some ingredients at a detail you can not get from a recipe.

The best surprise was the disk on broccoli.  In fact, I made the broccoli dish before the bakalava!  Roasted broccoli -- took just a few minutes, simple with on-hand ingredients, healthy as heck, and now I LIKE broccoli. It used to be one of those things I ate because it was ""good for you"" but never went back for seconds...

Alton Brown's GOOD EATS are good.  The recipes he reviews on the DVDs are available via the foodnetwork website for printing.  Perfect.

Strongly recommend!",1271980800,12,707,4.6
