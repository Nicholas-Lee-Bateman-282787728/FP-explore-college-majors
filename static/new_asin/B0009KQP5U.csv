For the down-to-earth person who wants to learn proper strength training, AND for the experienced who can follow this workout with heavier weights and or run all or part of it twice.  One of my favorites that I often return to (I've got a lot of fitness DVDs and videos after 25 years!). An asset to any collection; Althea is a great instructor--she knows what she's doing and she knows how to teach.",1203379200,2,538,4.763440860215054

8062809,4,B0009KQP5U,"+  This is a weight lifting routine that includes a fairly well rounded variety of motions.  I recommend it  for beginners and advanced by adjusting the hand weights that you use (no other equipment required).

+  I like how it is a thorough/total body workout but quick (26 minute workout not including the warm up & cool down stretch).  The DVD is divided into sections that you can choose if you want to target certain areas on a given day.  At the end of each section the instructor demonstrates various stretches.

+  I like how after doing some single repititions, Althea does most of eact motions in a 2 or 4 count version that makes you contract your muscles longer and you feel the burn (builds strength, endurance, stability, and form).

+  I like how this is a no-impact workout, there are no jerky motions or jumping around.

The instructor Althea isn't terribly motivating or charismatic, but has a no-nonsense, down to earth, pleasant attitude which I ended up liking.  She has good form (with one exception - during the million reps of biceps/triceps, she bounces a body slightly as if she's dancing to the music, which may be misinterpred by beginners as swinging her body to do the motion; but otherwise she has good form).

There are 4 ""students"" in her class.  It was nice to see 2 macho muscular guys in the inluded, except they look silly using only 2 pound weights when they could probably be using at least 20 pound weights.

Music is a variety of dance/techno music, energetic & varied enough to be motivating, but low key enough  to be relaxing (not the super-hyped frantic stuff)
