2913471,5,B000U0FZ0K,I thought the moves were very easy to do. I have been struggling with neck and shoulder pain and this has really helped. I liked the audio segment that you can import into your mp3 player. Well worth the money.,1213920000,4,210,4.275
2913472,3,B000U0FZ0K,"I thought this was well put together, but it was overpriced and I would of rather gone to the library to get a Yoga book instead. I paid $28, and it was probably worth 12-15. Some of the poses are ridiculuous as you have to be Gumby to perform them.",1213747200,3,249,4.0

2913475,5,B000U0FZ0K,"I bought this as well as the ""Viniyoga Therapy for the Low Back, Sacrum and Hips"" DVD for my husband who has painful stiffness in his back and shoulders.  He like the way the poses/programs are shown in a non-distracting environment (he's not an incense and tapestries kind of guy) and is gaining more flexibility and relief with each viewing.  He also really likes the feature that allows him to send the sessions to his phone and use them while traveling.  Definitely worth every penny!",1208131200,10,488,4.7176470588235295
2913476,5,B000U0FZ0K,"This DVD focuses on issues of the upper body, specifically the upper back, neck, and shoulders (the other DVD in this series focuses on the lower body).  It differs from other yoga DVDs in that it contains a strong educational component in addition to the practice element.  Also, the practices on the DVD are designed for rehabilitation and strengthening, and thus they are more similar in feel to a physical therapy session than to a yoga class.

The main menu of this DVD consists of four separate segments:  1) Understanding Back Pain, 2) Technique Workshop, 3) Therapeutic Practices, and 4) Special Features.  The Technique Workshop provides the opportunity to study individual postures in greater depth.  The Viniyoga Therapeutic Practices offer three complete practice segments tailored to meet different needs as described below.  (Note: the DVD also provides bonus MP3 audio versions of each practice.)

1. Upper Back and Neck Therapy (22 minutes).  This is the most gentle of the three practices, and it is designed to address misalignment or instability by strengthening and mobilizing the upper back and neck.  In consists mainly of movements which serve to lengthen the upper spine.
2. Neck and Shoulder Therapy (32 minutes).  This practice is more specifically geared to releasing pain or restricted movement in the neck and shoulders via stretching, aligning, and balancing work.  Many of the postures here involve moving one arm as you twist your neck to the opposite side.
3. Strength and Stability (41 minutes).  This longer practice is intend to build sustained, long-term health in the upper back, neck, and shoulders.  It is a bit more intense than the previous two, containing many of the same posture sequences but adding some stronger work as well.

The practices feature a single student working on a mat against a rather sparse white set, with Gary providing instruction via voiceover.  Most people are likely to find the practices rather dry--Gary's voice is a big monotone and repetitive, and there's little ""fun factor"" here.  However, these are therapeutic in nature, and as such, they are quite effective.  I found the twisting motions from the Neck and Shoulder Therapy practice in particular to be extremely beneficial for my nagging neck soreness and frequently tight upper back and shoulders.  This DVD would be useful for virtually anyone who is at risk for upper back issues, from those who work at a desk daily to those with more chronic conditions.  I definitely recommend Viniyoga Therapy for Upper Back, Neck, and Shoulders as an excellent tool for alleviating pain and promoting health in the upper back, neck, and shoulders.",1207872000,180,2667,5.12962962962963

I love the anatomy overview, and the way you can progress at your own pace. I lent my copy of this upper back video to my chiropractor, and he thought it was fantastic and said he plans to buy both lower and upper back to show his other patients.",1196899200,68,420,4.011904761904762

2913480,5,B000U0FZ0K,I bought this dvd for my husband as a Christmas present back in November. He has had chronic neck pain after a neck injury/surgery (plate in the neck!) and has tried just about everything to alleviate his discomfort. THIS WORKS. He has memorized the 22 minute session and does it daily. And he NEVER complains about neck pain anymore! I have had my own personal experiences which I would categorize as miraculous. Just last week I was experiencing the most intense upper back/neck pain I had ever felt in my life. Advil didn't work. I couldn't get in with the chiropractor I like nearby. I decided to try this dvd and guess what - it worked almost immediately! I did it again the following day and my pain/discomfort is completely gone. LOVE THIS DVD and recommend it for everyone who has ever experienced upper back/neck pain!,1468713600,,827,4.671232876712328
2913481,5,B000U0FZ0K,"Both the explanation and the illustration of the upper back exercises are very clear and well defined. Nevertheless, it is a problem to sit or stand or lie down, and at the same time pay attention to the visual aspect of the DVD. After repeating the exercise, I only have to listen, which makes things easier, but still I find it difficult to concentrate, because I have to be alert (with open eyes) to the next demonstration.

2913486,2,B000U0FZ0K,"I luckily got to see this DVD through a check out at my local library. I think it has great info and if you are not new to yoga would be easy for you to complete. The instruction is very dull with no music in the back ground with horrible lighting giving it a 'home made' feel and like other reviewers have said its fast paced with little delay to get into the correct positions. Also it kills my knees to do some of the poses so I became frustrated and just watched. The poses are given in, well, their original language so instead of saying we're doing ""Cat/Cow"" or ""Child's pose"" a very long name is given to where I must look up to see what's going on and kind of threw me off.  If you want a more ""spa feel"" kind of DVD with mostly gentle poses (some challenging ones thrown in) I would highly rec checking out Annie Carpenters Yoga for Backcare which I have found gives me significant relief for my upper back/ neck pain.

2913491,5,B000U0FZ0K,"I had ACDF neck surgery in 2010.  While it alleviated many problems, it created a new problem in that my thoracic back area was then sore thereafter.  In September 2014, after reading many reviews of Gary Kraftsow's DVD Viniyoga Therapy for Upper Back (neck and shoulders), I bought the DVD for about $15.  It is the best $15 I ever spent.  I did the 22 minute exercise about 4 times per week and, within a month, the thoracic back pain was gone and remains gone at this time almost a year later.  The DVD is excellent.  There are also 2 longer exercises on the DVD besides the 22 minute one, and I sometimes do them.  I don't have to do the exercises 4 times a week anymore.  I usually do the 22 minute exercise 2 to 3 times per week.  The DVD has made a big difference to me.",1441411200,2,777,4.1610738255033555

2913500,2,B000U0FZ0K,"Gosh I was so hoping I would get relief from my chronic neck pain w/this dvd (occasionally i have upperback & shoulder pain too). I'm glad it has helped others, but it just made my neck pain worse. I chose viniyoga after my chiropractor mentioned a more theraputic yoga program would benefit me VS the ones I had been doing at home (i'll give links to those too). She didn't recommend this program specifically. I should mention that I am not new to yoga & have great success with other dvd's for true beginners. This program isn't in my opinion. In this dvd, the people doing the postures are very flexible & are able to follow his instructions without any modifications. In fact, he gives no posture modifications AT ALL! He does give a technique review which I liked & a few different variations, but no true modifications IE using props...blocks, towels, strap or bolster. He doesn't  even mention what to do if you feel uncomfortable in the pose, (or your not able to do it) which is a huge issue for me because if I don't feel certain that i'm doing it right, then I don't do it at all. The deep neck twists are not good for those who have severe neck pain either. Better to do some gentle neck stretches which you can find on you tube for free! I've found that I enjoy more of a true yoga experience & this is just a series of poses strung together--more like if you were going to PT. It was well thought out & I appreciated the eductaional element however, after trying it several times i've decided it's just not beneficial to me. I did buy the 2 pack & have yet to try the lower back dvd. I may try that one & update my review if necessary. Here are the practices that I have made great progress with-- http://www.amazon.com/Element-Hatha-Flow-Yoga-Beginners/dp/B005QUQRDS/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1427382723&sr=8-3&keywords=element+yoga+for+beginners & http://www.amazon.com/Element-Yoga-Stress-Relief-Flexibility/dp/B00429C1W0/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1427382905&sr=8-2&keywords=element+yoga+for+stress+relief+%26+flexibility. Both of these programs offer a true yoga experience where you will learn all the benefits of yoga, (not just the physical) but offer tension relief & relaxation as well (which helps reduce pain). Modifications are addressed at almost each pose & they are slower paced yet, afterwards you feel rejuevenated like you have just finished a great workout. Tamal & Ashley are wonderful instructors as they both encourage you to only go as far as your body tells you to, which helps you to feel more connected & balanced. Maybe viniyoga isn't for me but i'm glad others have found some relief. I've dealt with neck pain & migraines for most of my life & know the toll chronic pain can have. Hope this review will help someone! :)",1427328000,,2757,5.059340659340659

2913538,5,B000U0FZ0K,"This DVD is broken up into 3 main sections essentially.  The first section helps you understand what's happening to the musculoskeletal structure when it suffers from various spinal disorders/injuries. You also gain an appreciation for the careful study and detailed understanding Gary Kraftsow has gained to develop this therapy routine. Admittedly, it's a bit dry but for those who want to understand what's going on with their spinal system in that detail, you'll appreciate this section.

The second section, which is broken up into several subsections, is a tutorial on each Viniyoga move.  He also explains what he's trying to accomplish within the spine with each move.

The third section, like the first and second section, has several subsections.  You have your choice of 3 therapy routines.  One specifically for the upper back and neck, which is 22mins long.  The second, is for the Neck and Shoulders, which is 32 mins long.  The last section is for Strength and Stability which is 40 mins long.

My goal is to do this everyday for the next 30 days.  Of course I plan to continue but am giving myself small goals right now.  I think I will also purchase a portable DVD, so during my lunch break at work, I can do one of the therapy routines.  You don't sweat, so I may easily do this in my work clothes.

2913543,1,B000U0FZ0K,"For the past few months I have been experiencing tingling sensations on the side of my neck, upper chest, upper back on the left side of my body when in various positions lying down, sitting or standing and pain when turning my head to the right as far as it will go.  I checked with my primary care physician and he told me the problems were with my C-2, and between my C-6 and C-7 vertebrae and said I would probably need physical therapy to restore full range of motion and stop the tingling and pain.

At amazon.com I searched for DVDs to help relieve neck and back pain that would demonstrate the correct way to do the exercises.  Several yoga DVDs came up. I read the reviews by customers and this was one of the DVDs that was rated highly by customers who stated the exercises were simple (some said too simple and boring) and gave it rave reviews.  As a consequence of the customer reviews and the description of the viniyoga therapy method and one other ""simple"" yoga DVD I ordered both DVDs from amazon.

When this DVD arrived I watched it all the way through and was totally dismayed.  Gary Kraftsow used pictures from an anatomical chart to identify which muscles would be worked using each of his viniyoga exercises but did not address the causes of neck and back pain nor did the DVD give modifications that could be done if you could not do the exercises as they were demonstrated.  He was also insistent that the sequencing of the exercises was very important in getting results in building the particular muscles as well as the importance of a focus on breathing.

I am a senior who is fit but have never practiced any type of yoga before and believed the statements that beginners would be able to do these exercises (the same claim is made for other ""yoga for beginners"" books and DVDs).  I wanted to know how  specifically a particular ""position"" or ""stretch"" was going to help alleviate my tingling, pain and loss of range of motion on one side of my neck and spine.

This DVD uses two excellent students of viniyoga, a senior woman and middle-aged man, both of whom were flexible and could do the positions with Kraftow's being seated on the floor next to them doing minor tweaking of their movements/positions which would be impossible for me to do at home alone.

Additionally, there is no way that I can:  get onto the floor; get off the floor if I did manage to get down; can lie on my stomach turning my head to the side; focus on my breathing while holding the stretch; or would ever consider doing these exercises.

In my opinion this DVD is for very flexible people or people who have done yoga before. I have resold both of the two yoga DVDs I purchased.

A physical therapist recommended a book on amazon.com written by two Ph. D. physical therapists which is exactly what I was looking for: ""Age-defying Fitness"" by Moffat and Lewis.  The book has assessment guides to let you know which exercises would be helpful for you to do as well as pictures of people demonstrating the correct way to do the exercises.  The book shows people using an elastic band exerciser as well as those not using the band for the exercises.  Moffat and Lewis cover posture, strength, flexibility, balance and endurance---things I and others certainly need as we age.

I realize that this review will infuriate yoga practitioners (both students and teachers) and they will vehemently disagree with my review.  This review is my judgment of the practice of specific yoga positions to alleviate neck and upper back pain for seniors who have never practiced yoga. I sincerely hope the review helps other seniors or people in the same quandry as to what exercises will help alleviate pain in their necks and backs.",1371686400,14,3721,4.59214501510574

I also really appreciate the fact that he has real, normal, and fully/normally clothed (!!) models doing his workouts!

1. Intro overview where he explains the anatomy of the body and the reasons for pain and dysfunction.

2. The 3 sets of exercises. The first two are designed to relieve the pain (one is for upper back and neck, the other for shoulders and back; you choose which meets your needs, or you can do both) and the 3rd is to maintain strength and flexibility once the pain has abated.

3. The ability to pull the mp3s off the DVD and put onto a smartphone, tablet, mp3 player, CD, etc. I watched until I was comfortable with the poses and now just listen from my smartphone.

I have had to buy this DVD three times because I lend it out and it 'disappears'. I have chronic issues and when I do these exercises regularly, they go away.

Sure wish they didn't make these on such low quality CD's.  Now I will have bought 3 of these.  If my next one starts to skip too I'm gonna have to freak out.  Have a good day!

I saw all the great reviews here on Amazon about this videos and got excited.  I had 2 fusion surgeries on my neck in '09-'10 and since then have had chronic pain in my upper back, neck, and shoulders specifically.  I was amazed to find a yoga video prescribed exactly for my worst areas of pain (I have hip pain too and their other video for hips/low back/sacrum is great also).  I worry sometimes about the reviews where so many people back up the product with raving reviews.  In the back of my mind I'm always thinking about some corporation having its employees write reviews so a product will sound amazing.  I'm convinced it does happen on a small scale but I feel sure it hasn't happened here or if it did they were right anyway!

It's been the most unique yoga routine that I've seen.  It's not your standard down-dog/sun-series routine.  I feel so good after (and during) the videos as they stretch and release just the right muscles.  If I can make one complaint it's just that between this video and the low-back one there are quite a few of the same poses.  I can see how they work both areas but I like to do both videos back-to-back and it's just a little disappointing when the same poses are coming up.

2913563,5,B000U0FZ0K,"This will be a long review, but the short version is--this DVD is darn near magic. Buy it. Really. Now here's why I recommend it, and have recommended it a dozen times plus bought it and the lower back version for my father.

I have scoliosis with a curvature in two planes and no curve in my neck, which makes for chronic, daily back pain. One of my doctors told me once he never expected me to be pain free with all the twists and turns I've got. Now, don't get me wrong. Scoliosis can't kill you, and it's not nearly as serious as what a lot of my friends are dealing with. But it can just make your life painful and inconvenient, so it's worth working to improve it. About two years ago I started seeing a chronic pain doctor who gave me pain killers and recommended steroid/painkiller shots in my back (facette injections). I've been thinking about the shots, but it makes me uncomfortable (they do them under x-ray to make sure they don't hit an important nerve--eek!), and while the pills work well, I don't want to be on narcotics the rest of my life, and it's a life of slowly increasing doses, plus the very real risk of addition. Not something to screw around with.

About four months ago, with too much time at the desk, it got to the point where I would either have to get the shots or increase my pain medication, and I didn't want to do either. I had been given exercises from a physical therapist, but they were terrible hand-drawn handouts on a sheet of paper, and I was too lazy to do them. So I thought a DVD might help, someone to follow along with, nice music. My goal was to just not have to get the shots or increase the meds.

So, I went looking for a DVD and came across this one. The reviews were amazing, almost unbelievable. I thought the DVD couldn't possibly work that well for everyone. However, I figured even if it helps a little, that's all I need. The DVD arrived and I did the 22-minute practice (there are three--the first two are to get you out of pain, the third is to strengthen your back so you don't go back there).

I felt a little better *immediately.* Better pain relief than with any chiropractic or physical therapy appointment. Only thing it didn't outperform was hydrocodone, and well, that makes sense. I then did it three times a day for two days and noticed an immediate, amazing difference. I no longer had to increase my pain meds, and I even started reducing what I took. After two days. I slacked off a bit, and I still felt better, so it wasn't just a have-to-do-it for the effect--it must actually help healing. Now, I'm trying to get on a regular, non-lazy routine with it and then reduce my medication. I might be able to get off it entirely. The pain is under the pain level, so now I get to figure out where it is. As you may have noticed, this way, way outdid my goal of just not having to take a more aggressive treatment step.

There are also other things I love about the DVD. Gary Kraftsow's voice is very calming and relaxing. The person demonstrating the DVD isn't a size 0 22-year old woman who can put her leg next to her ear. It's a middle-aged guy (not Gary), on a white screen and a yoga mat, and he's a little chubby, a little balding, and not terribly flexible. In other words, a normal person. I found him very likable, and that's not something I ever thought about before. It's relaxing enough to do right before bed, in the morning, etc. I love it. You can even download MP3s from the DVD so you can do the practice via a player/phone if the visuals are inconvenient.

My dad had complained about back pain, so after I felt better after one workout, I sent him the DVD plus the one for lower back. I've seen some folks complain that the two DVDs aren't different enough, but what did they expect? Upper back and lower back are inches away from each other, so they probably have similar exercises. I thought it was nice that the two DVDs were available, because so many folks have trouble primarily with one or the other. I felt good about getting the upper back because that's exactly my problem. Anyway.

Here's another thing I noticed. I woke up one morning very stiff and did the DVD. The DVD did not make me feel better immediately--I was stiff in a slightly different way, but by the end of the day it had gotten better, and I know I was better faster than if I hadn't done the DVD. I mention this in case someone does the DVD, doesn't feel immediately better, and gets frustrated. It might just be one of those days when the body needs more than twenty minutes to get things going in the right way. Don't get discouraged.

I had just hoped for feeling a little better, not magic on a DVD. I give it my highest recommendation. Here's another way to think about it: my co-pay on my pills is $10. The DVD is $17. You can't even go to one chiropractic or physical therapist's appointment for $17 on most health plans. Even if it helps a little, it's worth it. And you can return it if it doesn't work--so no excuses! Get it! Sending you good wishes for good health (of course, wishes aren't enough. Action is sort of required.) ~WT Rose",1329955200,34,5117,4.334029227557411

My upperback/neck and shoulders were tight as a knot, often hurting day after day and giving me a horrible headache.
I felt like 90+ and felt my world was beginning to shrink.

All this changed after I started doing viniyoga. The exercises are easy to follow and practise and I really felt energised from day one! It is impossible how the disentangling of my muscles influenced my whole being. It was wonderful to feel like Me again.

All exercises or asana's are explained in a very clear way. Easy to follow and not too fast. I think it was a wonderful thing you could click into the explanation when the exercise starts. Very easy in case you forgot something halfway.
Gary's voice is very peaceful and clear as are his explanations.

I also liked it a lot that the models were 'ordinary people', not like the supermen and women you often see entangled in weird looking positions! I also like the overall presentation.
In one of the other review's I read a commentary on the presentation. This person thought it was dull and boring. Well I could not agree less. I think it was nice to see ordinary people and I really could connect with them and what I was doing. If I want music I can play my own afterwards!

After just one session of these stretching techniques, I learned simple and effective ways to relieve my pain. I am confident I will continue to improve with routine use of these practice sessions.

I love traditional yoga classes for the spirituality, variation and relaxation elements, however, those exercises can sometimes exacerbate my pain and trigger muscle spasms. This DVD is good for beginners as well as experienced yoga students looking for specific stretches to gently relieve neck and shoulder pain on your own. I like that there are three session lengths with various focuses so you can choose your workout based on your own physical needs/goals and time constraints. While I don't purport this DVD to be a cure-all, I do feel that it is GREATLY beneficial in my quest to conquer this chronic pain.",1312502400,7,942,5.077419354838709

2913573,5,B000U0FZ0K,I have been using this DVD for about a month.  I do ultrasound and had severe pain on the right from my back through shoulder and arm.  I have found much relief if I consistently do at least a 20 minute segment.  I purchased the upper and lower back package together because I have problems in all areas.  I alternate and many of the exercises are similar in both with some more specific to the upper or lower.  What I like is that he prompts every move including breathing and the movement.  The movements are slow so I can keep up with them. One would think that slow doesn't work but I'm starting to feel more flexibility and less pain and I'm seeing more definition in my stomach muscles.  I like variety so having the 2 DVDs with 3 sessions in each is good although many of the movements are similar.  There is also a segment that describes each movement and proper position.  I look forward to doing these and feel that I need to do them or I feel more pain.,1300233600,7,964,4.252747252747253

I tried feldenkrais, massage, bodywork, and a couple of other yoga programs with little success in really addressing the issue.  I was hoping that after a month or so of using this DVD, I would notice a difference.

Within a week of using the 22 minute routine each day, I had no more back pain.  I was finally able to improve my posture, which I had been trying to do for months to improve my horseback riding.  I know it sounds crazy---but the simple exercises on this DVD are so much more powerful than they look!  I only wish I found this DVD sooner!!!!!  Other yoga and exercise DVD's I have bought usually end up collecting dust on the bookshelf after a few uses.  More than a year later, I am constantly going back to this DVD.  If I don't use it for a few weeks, I find myself missing it.

The routine is short, enjoyable, and effective.  I always feel so much more energized and relaxed afterwards.  In addition, you get SO much more with this DVD than any of the other yoga DVD's I have.  There is a fantastic discussion on back pain and yoga, and there are little tutorials on each yoga position.  There are three different routines of varying lengths, so you can have a more or less intense session without compromising on the effectiveness.  There are also the MP3 tracks of the routines.

I recommend this to everyone I know who experiences upper back, neck, or shoulder pain.  Get it.  Do one routine from it every day for a week.  You just may be amazed at how much transformation you can experience in such a short time.",1299888000,8,1618,4.405405405405405

IT WORKS LIKE A MIRACLE!!!

I did the practice twice in the first week and my pain was reduced dramatically. By the second week, my pain was all gone. Yes, I was (am) 100% pain free! Of course, nothing is perfect and there's always a catch. I have to do this every other day to stretch my muscles in order to stay pain free. But hey, a very nice compromise and no more physical therapy for me.

The DVD has 3 practices. So far I've tried the first 2 only. The instructions were very easy to follow (never did yoga before). It also came with a lecture from Gary Kraftsow. I am sure it's very informative...but I fell asleep when I was watching that part.

I have read books by Gary and I know that he is very well respected in his field. I felt confident that these DVDs would be excellent because of that and they did not disappoint. The instruction and the information in the DVDs is excellent and easy to follow. After trying many other instructional DVDs, these by Gary Kraftsow are by far the best DVDs for back and shoulder pain that I have found. My back and shoulders felt better after the first time I used these. As both a student and teacher of yoga,I am truly impressed",1235088000,11,685,4.488

the DVD is broken up to five parts; if you are into instructions and have not done yoga before - you will find these segments very useful.  For those who are yogis then I would suggest jumping right into the last segments that target the upper back, shoulders and neck either for release or for muscle strenghtening.

I first used the 32 minute routine and could tell immediately that it would help.  I have used the therapy at least five times a week for the last three weeks.  It feels as if my posture is improving.  I have much less pain and I have high hopes that continued use of this will make a huge difference in my life.  I am now using the 40 minute session any day that I have the time and either the 22 or 32 minute session if I have less time.  They are all great for posture and mobility.

2913593,5,B000U0FZ0K,"I bought this DVD and its companion for the lower back shortly after having a debilitating back spasm that put me out of commission for several weeks. I went to physiotherapy, and although it did help, I find the exercises excruciatingly boring, which of course means I don't do them as often as I should.

So, what was the result? These DVDs are quite simply a godsend. (I'm only writing a review of this one now because I haven't yet used all three segments of the lower back DVD.) Kraftsow says in his introduction that doing the yoga exercises should be like brushing your teeth, and I find that the program is designed to make it just as easy to keep the stretching going as brushing teeth would be! Knowing that I have a choice between segments of different lengths, and that I can do just 20 minutes in the morning (before I get too hungry!) and still be doing something for my back, makes it so much more realistic to keep up a yoga program.

That, and the fact that the exercises work. I am sometimes so tense that the neck & shoulders movements don't relax me completely, but they do help, and I generally feel the difference the following morning: they can be better described as preventing future, worse pain than easing current pain. I might add that several of the exercises are similar to what I learned in physiotherapy, which gave me some confidence in the system.

I spent more on these DVDs than I usually do on exercise videos, but I also use them several times a week, much more than I use anything else. They offer variety in type of exercise and duration of program, and they're set up so that I can do a light program when I'm suffering from pain and a harder one when I want to build strength. I've also noticed a difference in my core abdominal strength from using the two videos. Finally, I should add that the DVDs also include mp3 files of the practices, in case you just want to work out with the sound and don't need the video any more.",1217030400,25,1967,4.398351648351649

While the instruction and explanation is good, the actual work-out is fairly quickly paced. If you hurry and do the positions without doing them properly for your body, you will end up possibly injuring yourself. Although I am older I have exercised most of my life, yet both of the Kraftstow DVD's were difficult for me.  I was disappointed to pay almost $50 for both of them, which I can only return for a partial refund.

As you are doing the yoga exercises Gary describes the different areas you should be focusing on stretching and does an excellent job of it. It contains very slow and stress free moves. The DVD contains a segment on Understanding Back Pain, an instructional Technique workshop to learn the practices, there are 2 different Practices for the initial stages and a longer Strengthening & Stability practice to use when you are feel better and improve. You don't have to be Gumby to do these poses. There is no need to try and stretch further than your ability, your flexibility increases over time. I suffer from chronic upper back and neck pain from car accident many years ago. It is especially bad between my shoulder blades, traveling up through my neck. It is tissue damage, I have nothing wrong with any bones. I've tried it all Chiropractor, Acupuncture, and went to the gym for a while. I found that the best thing you can do for an injury with chronic pain is to continually stretch and slowly work on re-strengthening the muscles. I went online searching for a Yoga Video as a last resort. I get so much relief from many of these poses, I even have my favorites from the video that I do any time I feel like it. I live with pain every day of my life and can say that this video has helped me out a lot. It is an excellent way to unwind after a long day of sitting in front of a computer at work.
I don't usually write reviews, but I had to on this one.. I definitely would recommend this DVD for someone who is looking for therapeutic viniyoga therapy. The specific poses/stretches target the upper back, shoulders, and neck. I think it is even good for everyday stress relief, which can cause tension in the shoulders and neck.
