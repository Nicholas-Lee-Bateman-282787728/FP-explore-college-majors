8459282,4,B00568KI6C,"Sanjay Dutt's mullet here is one of the greatest mullets that ever existed. Mel Gibson's Lethal Weapon mullet and Jean Claude Van Damme's mullet from Hard Target combine together on top of Mr Dutt's head to create the most awesomely hair rock hair ever in a non hair rock video. He also does some questionable but oh so watchable kung fu. For all the hair power he brings, it's still clear he's mostly in this movie as a favor from movie god Feroz Khan to his daddy Sunil that he worked with on a reg through the 60s and 70s. Sanjay Dutt isn't terrible. He's got that hair and looks like 40 plus year old Robert De Niro despite being in his 20s here cause of extreme drug abuse that would later get him into stuff like gun running and terrorist associations (allegedly just cause you know Indian takes forever to make decisions). The biggest issue is that he's not nearly as likeable as Feroz Khan and there's a lot of Feroz Khan.

Feroz is like action movie, Bollywood Orson Welles. He writes, directs, acts, produces, and incorporates international film techniques from Russia/Soviet, Iranian, American, Japanese, and Bollywood into a giant mess of entertainment. Feroz writes, directs, and plays the co-lead opposite Dutt here. They're relatives to a Romeo and Juliette style couple only it involves cops and robbers here. It's mostly setup for Feroz and Dutt to display how manly and awesome they are. It's also a chance for Feroz to point out that he looks much better than the much younger Dutt. He's getting up there in years and the hair coloring is thick but he looks good for his age and moves about at a good clip. It helps cause there's a lot of shooting, dancing, jumping, running, exploding, etc.

It's a genuinely good movie. I've made a little fun of it but it's solid film. The plot moves well. The pacing is never slack. It's even surprisingly confrontational. There's some on the mouth kissing. Lips engaged. I think I missed something too but I'm pretty sure it's cousins...it's naughty on any standard. Oh and the movie looks great. Feroz might be a one man band but he has an eye for detail.",1466380800,,2113,4.617021276595745
