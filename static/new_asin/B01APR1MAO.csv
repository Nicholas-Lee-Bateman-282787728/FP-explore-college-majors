8748003,4,B01APR1MAO,"This is a mixed bag and let me start off by saying this is a multiple movie pack you will get movies not on most multipacks.  That being said they are a mixed bag alot of the movies do involve the end of the world but maybe half have zombies in them some have no monsters at all.  One with a Rage disease that makes a sort of zombie.  They are low budget but with Echo Bridge you should koow what your getting,  I got it in the 5 dollar bin at KMart so it was 50 cents a movie at that price I would say its not really a great task to live up to expectations there were a few entertaining a few that were good and only one that I would say really wasted my time but if you like multi packs and want something new go for it.",1471564800,5,722,3.76158940397351
