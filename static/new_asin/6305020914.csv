8628745,5,6305020914,"I just purchased this video on DVD and felt that it was extremely informative on how to start your modeling career!  The video covers everything from how to find an Agent, promotion of yourself including look books, composite cards, and go sees, and much more.  It follows models around New York City who talk to you about the rigorous but rewarding process of Editorial, advertising, and catalogue work.  I highly recommend purchasing this if you are interested in modeling.",1283385600,,475,4.987341772151899
