6433167,5,B00KJFZXOO,"Although MLB Productions sits on a treasure trove of material dating back decades, for some reason its commercial releases have rarely tapped into that potential.  Much of its early DVDs were short, glitzy packages that would highlight a handful of ballpayers, or a collection of bloopers.  Nice for fleeting entertainment, but they were thin on substance for the serious, nostalgic baseball fan.  Occasionally, there was a winner, like the 100 year retrospective on the World Series from 2003.  If you were a Yankees fan, MLB had plenty to offer, such as the Yankeeography series.  But for the average Cubs fan, Rangers fan, Blue Jays fan and so on, there was nothing out there to commemorate your experiences over the years.

A number of years ago, MLB began releasing box sets containing a series of games, whether documenting a given World Series, or ""memorable"" games from a given team's history (or at least over the last couple decades of archived video material).  Those were very welcome offerings, but given the limited number of games that could be released in this fashion, this line of releases could only go so far.

Many baseball fans want a package that takes him or her back to a particular special year.  Maybe that year was the first time he or she followed the game, or went to a ballpark.  Perhaps it was the year their favorite team finally became competitive or won a championship for the first time in recent memory.  We all have those special years.  We remember favorite players, certain uniforms and ballparks, the ebb and flow of the pennant race, the dashed hopes or the unexpected victory.  Much of what MLB released missed this key element of the fan experience.

A couple years ago, MLB Productions released&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/This-Week-in-Baseball-Season-One-1977/dp/B00A2YFPXQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">This Week in Baseball: Season One (1977)</a>.  That package contained every episode from TWIB's first year, 1977.  It is a fascinating time capsule that allows fans to take a close, week-by-week look at baseball during the mid-1970s: multipurpose stadiums, astroturf, and unforgettable colorful double-knit uniforms.  (Who doesn't have a soft spot in his or her heart for the Cubs powder-blue pinstriped pajama road jerseys, the gaudy throwback White Sox uniforms, or the Taco Bell Padres duds?)  Much of the footage of games shown in those episodes likely no longer exists anywhere else.

Although the TWIB set received near universal acclaim and high expectations for future sets from the rest of the 1970s and 1980s, inexplicably MLB had no interest in releasing anything other than this premier set.  Into this vacuum steps this collection of episodes from the MLB Network's series, Baseball's Seasons, documenting each season from 1980 to 1989.  Each episode, running an average of 45 minutes, presents a reasonably comprehensive narrative of key moments during the regular season and the postseason.  Some of the episodes even contain footage and talking head interviews from spring training, showing the hopes and expectations of various teams as they prepared for the season.  Some of the more memorable games and events from the regular season are featured, and the episodes provide an informative overview of the respective pennant races.  We get to see clips from the infamous 1983 Pine Tar Game featuring an irate George Brett, the 1984 Ryne Sandberg Game with the Hall Of Famer's two game-tying home runs off another future HOFer, Bruce Sutter, Len Barker's 1981 perfect game, and so on.

This series is also an excellent opportunity to experience the highlights of the ALCS and NLCS throughout the 1980s.  Although the League Championship Series often provides as much, if not more, excitement than the occasionally anticlimactic World Series, for some reason, these series have generally been criminally overlooked by prior MLB releases.  Of course, the World Series highlights are there, too, although these are more fully treated in the massive World Series films boxset released a couple years back.

In short, Baseball's Seasons is a quality documentary series that brings the 1980s back to life for a detailed treatment, both for those who experienced those years, and for younger fans who can't imagine baseball being played on astroturf or a time before there was such a thing as a wild card.

While this series comes highly recommended, it is no substitute for TWIB, which provides a far more in depth and contemporary look at each season during this time period.  That's not to say Baseball's Seasons isn't valuable in its own right.  For those who don't have the time to watch an entire season of TWIB, this series provides an excellent overview of a given season in one sitting.",1408752000,27,4798,5.2164276401564535

8659546,5,B00KJFZXOO,"The speed, intensity and love for winning was never greater in the MLB. Before the Blue Jays and Yankees began renting veterans for World Series rings, baseball was unpredictably insane and wonderful. Enjoy the hopped-up Dykstra, Brett, One-Flap Down Leonard and carpet baseball...an era of quickness and pitching.
