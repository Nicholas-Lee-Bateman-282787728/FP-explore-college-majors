7664668,1,B01BOS09GG,"What were they thinking????This is a horribly confusing flic that's hard to swallow. It was painful to watch the reunion of two likeable actors in such a poorly constructed film. This is a production from Shahrukh's Red Chilies Company so he is most blame-worthy. Writing, direction, even the music fail miserably. And why do Bollywood try so hard to make the actors look white? What did Kajol do to her face? She looks like a Bulgarian. I'm so disappointed. Why would anyone compare this to Romeo and Juliet? This is no love story. The secondary story is also preposterous, with a twist that had the alley cats screeching and the wolves howling. I dare you to watch and disagree.",1457913600,6,680,4.722689075630252
7664669,2,B01BOS09GG,Horrible direction! A very poorly made film. The action is just plain silly and annoying to watch and there is no substance to this film. The only reason the film made $$$ is because of the pairing of Srk/Kajol. I'm shocked Kajol signed a film with a poor script.,1457222400,5,263,4.387755102040816
7664670,5,B01BOS09GG,"This is an Indian Bollywood movie. Kajol and Shah Rukh Khan (SRK) are from competing gang families. They meet and start to like each other. Now you will be reminded of Romeo and Juliet. However, neither dies they just end up moving from Bulgaria to the same city in India. She runs a restaurant and he runs a garage. They don't see each other for 15 years. Both are responsible for a younger sibling. Now it's starting to remind you of Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham  (K3G.) The younger siblings meet and of course are interested in each other. They try all sorts of tricks to convince the older siblings to let them be together. Since it's a Bollywood you can guess how it will end, happily.

The music is good and Gerua has especially pretty scenery.",1457049600,12,746,4.477941176470588
7664671,5,B01BOS09GG,Delightful film with an unexpectedly moving portrayal of sibling relationships as well as romance.,1490572800,,98,6.071428571428571
7664672,5,B01BOS09GG,"First, let me say that I am an American with a deep appreciation and respect for Bollywood films. In fact, Hollywood could learn A LOT from movies like this one considering the garbage, filth and third rate entertainment it has produced in recent years...but I digress.....on to Dilwale...
You will not develop a full appreciation for this movie if you only watch it once. There is so much depth in the story and  performances of the principal characters you need a few viewings to appreciate them and the need for the back and forth in time. Mr. Kahn and Mrs Kajol have an on-screen chemistry that has not been replicated by ANYONE I have every seen in my lifetime. The quality of the storytelling and beauty of the filming was amazing. I cannot say enough about the cinematic genius of the 5-minute date, the heist, the fight on the beach!!(OMG), the garage ""full circle"" and finally the setup for a perfect proposal..it just does not get any better than this. Of course, the music is powerful and extremely effective...Gerua, Janam Janam and Daayre are already on my iPod. In summary, a job very well done. By far, one of the greatest love stories on film.",1490572800,8,1159,4.6536585365853655

7664684,4,B01BOS09GG,"I have to be honest and say that I thought this movie could have been way better - hence my 4 stars instead of 5.
SRK is the King of Bollywood but I felt that he didn't deliver all to well on this one. I still love him though :)",1473897600,,228,3.58
7664685,4,B01BOS09GG,In this movie the hero belongs to the family of dons. Villain was also a don and they were friends.

7664689,4,B01BOS09GG,"I really enjoyed Dilwale.  It had action, romance, intrigue, amazingly beautiful songs and dance sequences, especially Gerua and Janam Janam, featuring SRK & Kajol.  And, obviously, the most exciting part of the film is to finally see Kajol and Shah Rukh Khan together again, since their touching film, My Name is Khan, from 2010.  I like the director, Rohit Shetty, and his eye for action sequences.  The pace of the film is quick and colorful. The 2 young junior actors were sweet, but Kajol stood out in this film, along with her chemistry, with SRK.  This is a new character for Kajol to play, a tough woman, who is determined to prove herself, against an equally tough Shah Rukh Khan.  It is a more mature romance story, which is a nice evolution to see, with this being the famous Jodi's 7th film together.  I hope there will be more films, with these two famous actors, who have made onscreen chemistry legendary.",1470355200,2,920,4.6770186335403725

7664705,5,B01BOS09GG,"So good! Anyone who has seen DDLJ or any of the movies Shahrukh and Kajol have made together will appreciate the chemistry, the humor and little references to the past (Senorita). The film is beautifully made and vibrant and did I mention the music?? Its all fantastic and seeing these 2 together with the newer talent Bollywood has to offer (as well as the seasoned actors who are staples in the film industry) makes this a great watch.",1464134400,,437,4.615384615384615
7664706,5,B01BOS09GG,"Rohit Shettys Dilwale is a complete potboiler replete with romance, comedy, action and drama. The USP of the film, for me personally was seeing Kajol and Shah Rukh Khan reunite onscreen almost 5 years after My Name is Khan.

In a nut shell, Dilwale narrates the star crossed love story of Raj/Kaali and Meera (Shah Rukh and Kajol) and their respective siblings Veer and Ishita (Varun Dhawan and Kriti Sanon) that is narrated alternatively in present day Goa and fifteen years earlier in Bulgaria. The crux of the story is a major misunderstanding that develops due to enmity between two mafia families who are sworn rivals. The principal cast was ably supported by Mukesh Tiwari as Shakti, Pankaj Tripathi as Anwar, Vinod Khanna as Randhir Bakshi, Kabir Bedi as Dev Malik, Nawab Shah as Raghav, and Chetna Pande as Jenny. Varun Sharma, Johnny Lever, Sanjay Mishra and Boman Irani as Siddhu, Mani Bhai, Oscar Bhai and King respectively provide excellent, rib-tickling comic relief.

The picturization of the songs were breath-taking. While Gerua and Janam mesmerized with Shah Rukh and Kajols endearing romance against stunning locales, Manma Emotion Jaage and Tukur enthralled with fun, fervor and  celebration. In stark contrast, Daayre was presented as a simple, emotional, narrative track.

The outdoor locations shot mostly in Goa and Bulgaria added much needed color, vibrance and grandeur to Dilwale. And to live up to his reputation, Rohit Shetty ensures that Dilwale also boasts of well-choreographed, sleek n stylish, adrenaline pumped car chase sequences. Whether it was in a murky, gangsters drug warehouse or in a hip, breezy Goan restaurant, the action shots were deftly portrayed. One aspect that stood out in Dilwale for me was the ties of a family that was shown so beautifully. The strong and unshakable love between brothers, sisters and the familial bond that is unwavering in its support and unconditional love.

Finally what can I saw about Shah Rukh and Kajol that has not been already said. They will always be two of Hindi cinemas brightest talents and when they act together it is nothing short of magic. Seeing them on screen floods me with emotion and all at once I am the 12 year old that fell in love with Kuch Hota Hai even before watching the movie, the 15 year old that gaped at Suraj Hua Madham, the 24 year old who loved Rizwan as much as Mandira in My Name is Khan and the one who has always revered DDLJ throughout. Be it in the Bulgarian flashbacks or current day Goa, both Kajol and Shah Rukhs incredible acting skills lend credibility to each and every moment they are on screen. They have several charming moments onscreen that made me swoon  Meera and Kaalis five minute date, a rain soaked Meera finally professing her love to Kaali, the teeny tiny smirk on Kaalis face when he discovers that Meera has remained unmarried even after fifteen years and of course the final moments of the film. All in all, Dilwale was one fantastic, entertaining, clean movie that can be enjoyed with the whole family!!!",1463875200,,3043,4.876208897485493

7664712,3,B01BOS09GG,"Rohit Shetty has had an  enviable record with movies that very few filmmakers can even hope to match his success. His movies sneer at critical opinion, they are usually laced with colorful sets, comedy and his signature car crashes, however with Dilwale he seems to take his audiences for granted as well. I can't remember the last time that I came out of a movie theater so thoroughly disappointed by a spectacle that had me anticipating it since it was announced.
Dilwale is the story of two children from opposing gangs operating in Bulgaria ( seriously), falling in love. The two are Kajol and SRK. Some confusions arise and they separate.

SRK's and Kajol's chemistry is intact but it obvious that both look bored and can't save the movie even though they are such thorough professionals
Kajol still radiates oomph ( Is that why there are so many side shots of her?
SRK- what is going on with you ? First Happy New Year and now this drivel. He is perhaps the only actor besides Salman, who does not need a script these days. I hope Raees and Fan redeem him in 2016.
Varun Dhawan shines and shines, one can clearly see that he is in for great things and is the only person who is not sleepwalking. Sanjay Mishra is hilarious as Oscar Bhai.
The songs are alright- especially Gerua, Daayre and Janam Janam. However the best number was Tukur Tukur during the final credits - the actors looked energized during the last moments, perhaps they were rejoicing the end of the film themselves.
If one is to gauge the success of a film in a darkened auditorium then it is from the level of engagement of the audience. I noticed a constant shuffling of audiences in their seats and a steady stream of people heading for bathroom breaks.
Dilwale is an example of a movie which might still make a lot of money but proving that big is still no guarantee that a good film will be made and that copious amounts of money won't buy a good film script.

7664719,4,B01BOS09GG,"I liked this movie. I laughed out loud at times, amd I enjoyed the action and twists. Sure, there were a couple of scenes they could've done without,  but I am happy I bought this and I can't wait to watch it again. I COULD NOT take my eyes off of SRK whenever he was on screen. What a great looking man and screen presence - I would seriously give up my life in the US and run off with him, LOL. Kajol is lovely; their chemistry is still great. I will acknowledge that the romantic numbers weren't up to the SRK/Kajol I've gotten used to as they felt a bit too rushed and thrown in, especially Janam Janam. I wouldve happily watched another half an hour of this movie with longer SRK and Kajol music interludes done right. Gerua, for all of the gorgeous filming in Iceland ending up looking way too CGI, and anyone who knows about SRK and Kajol and their romantic interludes should know that you NEVER film them from afar and that their magic over the years is all about the eyes!

That said, I'm pleased with my purchase. The movie was entertaining, over the top, a bit silly, but fun and different. And it has Shah Rukh! And Kajol!",1458345600,20,1134,4.269767441860465
