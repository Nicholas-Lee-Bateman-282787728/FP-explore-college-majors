8745153,4,B019H4KJBY,"Unfortunately, this is only offered on DVDs that won't play on typical DVD players found in the U.S. That's too bad because this is a good movie. Jamie, a teenager who scoffs at the stories of selkies by his grandfather, finds out that he, himself, is a selkie. He is not happy about it, and sets out to find a way to erase the ""curse"" (as he sees it).  This story has several engaging subplots in it, such as 1) the discovery of being a selkie and enlisting the help of his grandfather, Scottish uncle, and a mysterious woman who lives on the beach to assist him in becoming fully human, 2) the boy-girl awkward teenage attraction with a classmate (Jamie discovers he is a selkie when he rescues her from drowning), and 3) the mystery of who is sabotaging Jamie's mother's new job and what is happening to the disappearing tracers put on the dolphins. I don't want to give away too much of the plot for anyone who is fortunate enough to be able to see this movie, but I liked it very much and especially loved the ending with the ultimate decision by Jamie about using the charm to stop being a selkie. The characters (except the school bullies and evil saboteurs) are likable
and believable. It was a treat to be able to see it, and I'd love to own it and share it with others some day.",1487808000,,1288,4.322314049586777
