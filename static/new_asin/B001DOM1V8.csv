8294436,1,B001DOM1V8,"One of the all-time greatest bombs of cinema. This isn't a film to be purchased because you like it but to fill out a collection. I knew it was terrible, but since I collect this kind of 40s-50s nonsense, I had to have it. Nice print, and the cast battles the script valiantly, especially Aumont and O'Keefe. A camp/kitsch masterpiece, but be warned, it's beyond bad. It's from a famous novel, but the premise sinks it from the start. Get this, Atlantis is submerged -- in the Sahara.",1387152000,,484,4.511363636363637
8294437,5,B001DOM1V8,I bought this DVD as it is one of my favorite movies! Favorite because of the title star----MARIA MONTEZ. She is absolutely gorgeous in the film and no one in 1947's Hollywood could have played the role of Queen Antinea of Atlantis as expertly as MONTEZ did in her role. Truly a camp classic!,1383696000,,292,4.425925925925926
8294438,5,B001DOM1V8,"Great little film which goes where typical American films of the era would not venture.

Just a note about the extras - Odeon incorrectly states on their website that this has trailers. Consequently, every online store repeats this misinformation. The only bonus is a photo gallery.
A previous release (purple cover showing another actress from the film) did have trailers.",1360972800,6,373,5.216666666666667
8294439,4,B001DOM1V8,"I had been trying to get a copy of this film for many years.  When I finally found Siren of Atlantis on DVD it was in the PAL format.  Disappointed, I took a chance and ordered it.  I was very happy to find it worked just fine on my laptop.
I had seen Siren of Atlantis when I was a kid in the early 1950's and always remembered thinking it was one of Maria Montez's better performances, although not a great film by any means the role suited her.  I also think even in black & white Montez looked especially attractive; however,judging from the poor DVD cover photo you wouldn't think so.  Siren of Atlantis is also the only time one can see Montez appear in a film with her husband, French actor Jean-Pierre Aumont.  The movie was released in 1949 and in just a couple of years Maria would be dead. My memories of the film were surprisingly accurate and I was so happy to see it and the woman who so fired my young imagination once again.",1351296000,8,940,4.223463687150838

aka La Atlntida

(Adventure, 1 hr 15 min, Black & White)
United Artists - U.S.A.

DIRECTORS:
Arthur Ripley & Gregg C. Tallas

CAST:

Maria Montez (As: Queen Antinea), Jean-Pierre Aumont (As: Andr St. Avit), Dennis O'Keefe (As: Jean Morhange)

COMMENTS:

Based on the novel ""L'Atlantide"" by Pierre Benoit. On May, 1947, Maria and her husband Jean-Pierre signed their first contract as independent actors with the German producer Seymour Nebenzal for acting in a new version of his 1932 film DIE HERRIN VON ATLANTIS. Maria was hired with the fantastic sum of US$100.000, for that time, per 10 weeks of work.

O'Keefe and Aumont are foreign legionnaires in search of a lost archeologist who find a secret passage in the middle of the Sahara desert which leads them to the Lost Continent.

Montez is the queen of Atlantis, a ruthless woman, who has the habit of spending her time playing chess with her prisoners.

The contact with this woman is sinister for her playmates who could not resist her charm and when they were seduced they end up as golden statues decorating the royal palace.

This soldiers discover the lost archeologist as one of the golden statues.

Aumont is the objective soldier who falls hopelessly in love with the Queen and blind by jealousy he kills his partner (O'Keefe). With guilt in his hear, Aumont manages to escape, he comes back to his legion and confesses his crime, but nobody believes him.

Later, trapped by Antinea's spell, he goes back to the Atlantis, but before arriving there, he dies in the middle of the desert in a sand storm.

The distributors rejected this film, considering it to much artistic for being commercial, forcing to Nebenzal to re-edited it.

The scenes of this movie were fantastic, unforgettable and glamorous, as the one where Montez is over a bed with the form of a shell of 10 feet of wide and 7 of high and she was wearing sensual siren dresses. Maria's fans were pleased with the scenes in which she appeared in the company of pet panther.

The critics of that time said, besides of a pretty Montez, the movie had too little to offer.

But time was a friend of this film and nowadays it is considered as a classic and it is used in some universities for their classes.",1344470400,3,2254,4.697201017811705
8294441,5,B001DOM1V8,"Great movie, I first saw it when I was in the 5th grade, and that is a very
long long tme ago. Question, was their a part taken out, I think I remember
their was some sort of beast in the movie? or was it another movie?
I just happen to like Ms Montez and her husband as actors; all I can say, is
seening the movie again was a delite but those bangs has to go!
A very nice experience for an old man, to see something he had seen so very
long time ago and found that I have not lost all my memories on thing gone
past, and to remember other things I did that day, when I saw this movie.",1319414400,,585,3.725806451612903
