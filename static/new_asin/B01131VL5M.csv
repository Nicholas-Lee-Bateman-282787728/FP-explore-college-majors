8723564,5,B01131VL5M,"I've seen parts of this and am waiting for my free copy from the maker, lol.  I just wanted to say not only is this film on Long Island.  There's a lot of heart behind it.  The creator grew up and has lived on Long Island his whole life and is an active part of the community and it's surroundings.  He has honed his skills both with photography and video over many, many, years to bring you this video of what we will just say is his Long Island.  I grew up there as well, we were wrestling partners (119 weight class), I am just so proud of him and his first accomplished video, I just had to say something.  Your not just buying a decent video on Long Island and it's history you are supporting a dream of someone who's dedicated a strong part of his life to bring you this film, with the support of a strong and loving family and strong friend base.  So I hope you enjoy this and we can all look forward to his next film, for I'm sure as a fine wine he will be even better with time.",1440028800,,987,4.005102040816326
