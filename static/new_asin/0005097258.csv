7787805,4,0005097258,"Among the earliest of the Homecoming Friends videos ""Holy Ground"" captures the shared commitment, the bonding of Christian love, and the spontaneous joy of genuine worship experienced at the reunion of respected friends.

Celebrated Southern Gospel pioneers and younger trend setters make up these gatherings of Homecoming friends. Featured artists include: Ann Downing, Janet Paschal, Jessy Dixon, Brock Speer, Doug Oldham, Henry and Hazel Slaughter, Glenn Payne, Ivan Parker, Gordon Jensen, and many others. A number of groups were also featured, these include: The Cathedrals, The Happy Goodmans, The Mullins, Assurance and others.

Among my favorite numbers featured in this program recorded at the Gaither Studios are:

* We Shall See Jesus
* Saved By the Hand
* Redemption Draweth Night
* Bigger Than Any Mountain
* Written in Red
* Sweeter Each Day
* Unworthy
* Room At the Cross For You
* Because He Lives

A unique worship experience.",1312156800,3,943,5.225165562913907
