7843827,5,6303343708,"Long before MTV turned into garbage that it is now, before that other show that cause paranoia and fear starring that sarcastic chick with the glasses (Let's completely forget that show with that sarcastic chick with the glasses), before there was great post-B&B shows like Celebrity Deathmatch, Downtown, The Maxx and The Head, there was ""Beavis and Butt-head."" Back when MTV was good (though never watched it on a daily basis), Beavis and Butt-head was a great quality show to watch and it is very enjoyable to see. What I like about this show, it has more likable male characters (ones who are age 30-59), Some violent scenes and controversial moments until those scum at MTV have to put some censorship afterwards. The eariler episodes from 1993 are alot more funnier and enjoyable than the later episodes (Seasons 4 or 5-7) in my honest opinion. The later episodes were consider hit and miss for me. The sad thing is, The show ended in 1997, but the good thing is, they're returning in October 2011. Beavis and Butt-head is one of my seven favorite animated shows, along with AEon Flux, The Head, The Maxx, Celebrity Deathmatch, Downtown and Liquid Television.

7843828,3,6303343708,"I just got the 3 pack DVD's from TimeLife.com.  I was disapointed not to see the music videos.  The music videos are one of the best parts of the series.  Their comments on the videos is like MST3K.  I feel that I did not get a complete product.  Just like everything on TV, it was not the way the creator intended it. Also, since MTV doesn't play music videos anymore, it is good to see some old vids.",1091059200,,402,4.102564102564102
7843829,5,6303343708,"Home Improvement(A)-Very excellent ep from the b's glory days.  Here, the b's paint Anderson's house and steal his mower.  Hilite when the mower runs out of gas in traffic.
Lawn and Garden(A+)-Perfect ep!  Here, the b's prune Anderson's trees, as well as his house.  Hilite when the b's play insect court with Anderson's chainsaw.
Good Credit(A)-Supreme ep, but doesn't compare to the last one.  Here, the b's buy pets using Anderson's credit card.  Hilite when Butthead announces the sexuality of two dogs.
Washing the Dog(A+)-Probably the best ep on the tape.  Here, the b's take Anderson's filthy dog to the laundromat.  Hilite when the b's go for a spin in a washing machine.
vs the Vending Machine(B)-Good ep, but weak compared to the previous 4.  Here, the b's try to get their stuck snack out of the vending machine.  Hilite when Butthead forgets about Beavis when he tries to get change.
Mr Anderson's Balls(A)-Improvement over the last ep.  Here, the b's steal Anderson's golf balls at the links and sell them for $1.00.  Hilite when golfers' conversation sounds like obvious sexual innuendo.
Pool Toys(A)-Once again, another A worthy ep!  Here, the b's work on Anderson's pool and destroy it in the process.  Hilite when the b's are up to their waists in dried cement.
The Trial(B)-Good ep, but it's extremely weak compared to most of the other eps.  Here, the b's defend themselves against Anderson in court.  Hilite when people keep calling Beavis ""Beatrice"".
All n all, I give this tape an A",1041638400,5,1504,4.8853754940711465
7843830,4,6303343708,"I have all the B and B tapes in the US and even some in the UK. This is the second tape released by MTV and like Work Sucks it is a mixture of old and new Beavis and Butthead.
-Home Improvement(B-), the boys steal Mr. Anderson's lawn mower and cause a traffic jam. Way too short. I think it was less then 4 minutes. Of course a lot was edited though, such as them smelling the paint fummes and starting some fires.
-Lawn and Garden(B+), the boys are doing some prunning and end up prunning some power lines in the process. Very funny early episode. The last shot with Beavis' finger being chopped off is gruesome, yet funny.
-Good credit(C), the boys take Anderson's credit card and buy some exotic animals. Slow episode. Not much really happens and since this is an early episode the voices and animation suck to.
-Washing the dog(B+), Beavis and Butthead want to get in Mr. Anderson's will so they decide to go wash his dog, in a washing machine. Then they decide to give it a try to. This one made me laugh out loud when I saw them in the washing machine, probably the best episode from the early years.
-vs. the vending machine(B+), When Beavis and Butthead's sour cream and salsa Pork rimmes are stuck in a vending machine they take matters into their own hands. This is the first modern episode on this tape, anyone watching will notice what a big difference there is in the voices and animation. Beavis yelling for Butthead at the end is this ep's highlight.
-Mr. Anderson's balls(A-), Beavis and Butthead give Anderson even more trouble when they start stealing his golf balls from him so that they can sell them. Good episode that has some really funny moments. Beavis, ""I have two balls that are identical.""
-Pool toys(A-),the boys fill Mr. Anderson's new pool with cement, hilarious results follow. Best episode on the tape, this one shows you how stupid they really are.
-Trail(B-), Beavis and Butthead go on trail for throwing eggs at Anderson's house. Ok ep with Ok animation. Why Butthead got possesed is never fully explained and is just weird.
Overall this is a good video, definitly not their best but not bad either.",1017705600,2,2135,4.577023498694517
