3425684,5,B001992NXI,"The Dennis the Menace show was one of my favorites growing up! Jay North and the rest of the cast were the perfect combination for the characters portrayed in this hilarious, family friendly, and lesson teaching comedy series.  I truly miss the character of ""Mr. Wilson.""  He and ""Dennis"" made the show!  This series should have been available years ago...the whole series.  You always knew that you were going to escape your troubles in a sea of laughter.",1271203200,6,456,4.8076923076923075
3425685,5,B001992NXI,Cannot even wonder why they won't release this on DVD......Had my grandson watch the bootleg copies I have and he loved it even more then Leave it to Beaver......HURRY UP AND RELEASE THIS ON DVD........PEOPLE WANT IT.......,1266278400,5,223,5.054054054054054
3425686,5,B001992NXI,"What with all the retro redo  butchery coming from CBS/Paramount of old series, I just hope Columbia who owns the rights does this great show I watched in it's original form, back in the day justice. It is a travisty of justice that some shows do not include the original music and laugh track scores. It would not be the same. Spend the money for the rights and do it right even if it costs a bit more on the retail end. The sound along with the visuals are part of the whole entertainment experience. Also some old Kellog's corn flakes endorsed commercials and an interview with Jay north would make it a hot seller to us who remember and maybe to a new generation looking for good old fashioned, clean entertainment. Let's do it for the one and only original Mr. Wilson, Joseph Kearns. ""Dennis!!!!""",1237766400,11,801,4.486301369863014
3425687,5,B001992NXI,"My family loved watching this show. We can't understand why Dennis the Menace, Leave it to Beaver, Jeff's Collie/Lassie & My Three Sons are not relased in full, uncut versions. I enjoy purchasing TV sitcoms for Birthday and Christmas gifts, & would like some of the older, classic shows to choose from. I have been burned by bootleggers so please commercially release these and other old time television shows. The public will buy them. We miss our TV friends and want them to come to DVD so we may watch them whenever we have a few moments off of work and daily presures.",1236729600,74,572,4.563106796116505
3425688,5,B001992NXI,A wonderful tv series from the Golden Days of Television. An era when families sat down after dinner and watched tv together. Years before cable entered our lives. A tv show about a small boy and the many troubles he gets into along the way. Poor Mr. Wilson the next store neighbor who somehow put up with Dennis spite being very nervous around him. Filmed in black and white but that does not take away from any of the shows charm. A delight to watch and remember what it once was like to be a kid.,1231027200,15,499,4.208333333333333
3425689,5,B001992NXI,I watched this devotedly when Nickelodeon was re-running the show many years ago.  Dennis The Menace is one of those cult classics that belongs in any fan's DVD library.  Great escapism of a gentler time period.,1229299200,43,211,4.833333333333333

3425734,1,B001992NXI,"While I liked this show in reruns growing up in the 80s, I can't stand to watch it now that Jay North had talked about how terrible it was for him. To know that you're basically always watching a kid that's minutes away from being beaten by his aunt in the dressing room makes this unbearable for me today. I respect him and do not support this show.",1488412800,,350,4.161764705882353

3425842,5,B001992NXI,"Thank goodness we have a clean restoration. With this you get a few specialties you won't get with a bootleg. Typically I'm ready for interviews that come off as fluff, but this one with Gloria Henry and Jeannie Russell actually explains what happened with Joseph Kearns sadly during the show. The two actresses go into nice depth about what happened backstage, what the other actors were like, and their opinions. It also explains Gloria's absence some point during a season. You also get an audio interview from a radio show with these two actors. There are quite a few commercials and the opening/ending credits finally actually have the sponsor logos in them. At least these logos were in the special features segment. I haven't watched any episodes yet.",1433721600,3,758,4.9296875

I will update this review if I get the rest of the season. Then I can give Dennis the Menace 5 stars.

UPDATE- I just had my ""replacement"" delivered about 10 minutes ago(02-22-2015) Same as before. One(1) disk. Yet in the product details it states  ""Number of discs: 5"" Now I have two packages to send back. I explained all of this to Amazon when I requested an RMA 2 days ago (see original review above)I told them I ordered ""Season 1"" and I only got one (1) disk. Disk #5.

3425945,5,B001992NXI,A true classic comedy from childhood year's.  All Baby Boomers or those born between 1945 & 1960 will enjoy this Season.  Apparently there were only 4 seasons of Dennis the Menace and my obsolute favorites were those with Joseph Kearns playing Mr. Wilson in Seasons 1 & 2.  Those that have enjoyed Ron Howard's earliest years on television should purchase Season 1 of Dennis the Menace.  He was one of Dennis' younger friends in Season 1 and played in a few episodes.  It looked to me he was around the same age as he was in Season 1 of Andy Griffith.  I haven't checked but wouldn't be surprised to find out that Season 1 of Andy Griffith aired in the same year as Season 1 of Dennis the Menace.,1393632000,,696,4.3565891472868215
3425946,5,B001992NXI,Good clean family entertainment . We watch it with our pre-teen daughters as an alternative to modern popular sit-coms. There is no worry about questionable story lines.,1393200000,,169,5.296296296296297
3425947,5,B001992NXI,"As a child I grew up with a then new series of Dennis the Menace which was accompanied by a daily newspaper comic. I never knew the origins of the show until I watched this series on Amazom Prime. I have to say what a gem, and it is safe for anyone to watch. This has rekindled my interest in the show I grew up with now it is even more fun because when I turn it on it attracts the whole family in to watch it together. Hey Hollywood! Take a lesson on history and make  more new shows like this one!",1392681600,,500,3.854368932038835
3425948,4,B001992NXI,"I'm ONLY a 40 year old man so these episodes came out 10 years more or less from when I was born. That being said I really enjoy this show. The only reason I give it 4 stars is that there are a few clunkers when Mister Wilson is Replaced after his death (not noted in the show) by his brother Mr. Wilson during season 3.  The Second Mr. Wilson looks like the Mr. Wilson in the funny pages but he's not as good as Joseph Kearns the original on the television show. At least in season 2 we get a whole season of Mr. Kearns before he ""moves away"" for the second Mr. Wilson (death in reality). The first Mr. Wilson and Jay North (Dennis had real on screen chemistry).

I have a few clues to why I like these black and white shows (Dobie Gillis, Patty Duke, Father Knows Best,Leave it to Beaver (my favorite of the B&W, Bachelor Father etc...)  It's like watching a different culture but it's these United States until everything changed in the Mid=sixties.  People really dressed up to go on dates, visit friends or just go shopping downtown.  I guess that still happens with the women but men have gotten away with really being sloppy over time.  Even though I was a kid in the late 70's through early 90's my town was small like the town in this show and you did know everyone and you were part of the community events. Eventually the town grew and feels more like a regular suburb now..  See I'm getting all sappy because of the frame of mind this show puts me in.

I've reseached about the show and they said the network wanted the show to tone down the mischief over time.  It's too bad because Dennis's best escapades are during the first season but that's not saying the others are bad, it's just that they were more diabolical.  Like a seven year old sneaking out late at night to watch a western movie at the Cinema while his babysitter thinks he's sleeping upstairs in the pilot episode.  Denis didn't do as outrageous of stunts over time which is too bad and another reason I have to take a star off.  Season 2 is solid though.  I watch ""Antenna T.V.""  over the air and I can tell you for sure that they don't play all the episodes so it's very cool to see re-runs that are totally new to me also Netfilx mysteriously only has season one.

I doubt if you came to this web-page that you don't know Dennis the Menace but for those that are ignorant he is a kid that un-intentionally causes mayhem wherever he goes.  He always means well but due to his odd life viewpoint and coincidentally the bad luck of those around him causes humorous follies everywhere he goes.  It's pretty standard sitcom fare; misunderstandings and good intentions with bad outcomes that are usually at the expense of ""Good ol' Mr. Wilson"" his favorite target and best friend from his standpoint.  He does cause issues from the other reoccurring characters in town and his parents but poor Mr. Wilson is his usual unintended target.

What makes this show differ from the norm is that it's mostly about a boy and a retired old man's relationship.  There are other sitcoms that loosely mimic this,""Different Strokes"" comes to mind but it's not as corny.  There are no ""special episodes"" that deal with illness, or political issues which I personally find refreshing.  I know this is a fantasy of how real suburban life of the late 50's early 60's was but it still gives me a good window to the ideas and kitchiness of the time.  I like to feeling of escaping into a time warp.  I highly recommend watching this show around lunch time.  It's under a half an hour without the commercials and it puts all your thoughts on hold as you find out how many different ways the writers can play off the dynamics of a boy, and his small town shenanigans.

If this show was written today it probably wouldn't be nearly as funny because of the diluted writing pool.  Also, since the 70's it seems like hot button topics always have to be shoved into a sitcom.  Remember there where only three networks when this show was on so the writing is pretty solid within the confines of the show.  It can be as cleaver as anything written by Mark Twain when it's at it's best.

Since this is the last full season of Joseph Kearns version of Mr. Wilson you can see this show when it was really hitting on all cylinders.  Of course in addition to Mr. Kearns dying Jay North grows into a 'tween"" and starts to look too old for his hooliganism. He keeps the striped shirt but loses the overalls and gains a collar.  To me that just isn't Dennis anymore and he starts to seem like a parody of his younger self.

My advice. Start with season one and go through the 38 (yes! Back then that was a season) episodes per season one by one during your lunch break if you can.  Something about it is just refreshing and brings you out of all the complications of life for a nice simple laugh.",1391990400,,4835,4.371364653243848

3426164,4,B001992NXI,"(Due to some odd quirk, reviews for Season One and Season Two of Dennis the Menace are being combined. This review is specifically for Season Two)

With a few refinements, the second season of Dennis the Menace (1960-61) provides more of the same kind of grating, and sometimes excruciatingly painful humor, which was present in the debut season.  The adaptation of Hank Ketcham's comic strip, proved to be a moderate ratings success, with Jay North starring as Dennis Mitchell, the boy who usually means well, but somehow manages to irritate and aggravate his parents, and those that care about him the most.

Alice (Gloria Henry) and Henry Mitchell (Herbert Anderson), may not be the ideal parents, but they do make some attempts to keep their son under control, but like the tornado featured in the opening credits, Dennis Mitchell is often like a whirlwind that cannot be contained.  The unfortunate victim of most of Dennis' activities, is of course his neighbor and ""best friend"", George Wilson, who is played marvelously by Joseph Kearns.

The relationship between Dennis and ""good old Mr. Wilson"", is one of the integral elements in the series.  While Dennis is still a source of aggravation, and Wilson does occasionally lose his temper, he seems more ""battle hardened"" and under control.  It may be hard to believe that one could become desensitized to Dennis, but Wilson's consumption of ""nerve medicine"" is way down, and his ability to handle situations with more control, makes him a more sympathetic figure in Season Two.  Based on deriving some amusement from the struggles of others, the humor in ""Dennis"" is something of an acquired taste.  Occasionally things do go too far, and the pain that Wilson and others experience, is a little too real at times.

Now aged nine, Jay North has grown a bit, and is better at handling dialog, although too often he seems to be shouting out his lines.  Thankfully, the use of ""jeepers"", his favorite word, is somewhat reduced.  Familiar themes include stories involving different animals and pets, Dennis' schemes to earn money, and Mr. Wilson's hobbies, including coin collecting and gardening.

Herbert Anderson as Henry Mitchell, and Gloria Henry as Alice Mitchell, are a bit more proactive, but Dennis' activities still manage to catch them by surprise.  Gloria Henry is absent for a number of episodes on maternity leave.  The explanation is that Alice is at her parents' home, because her father is recovering from a broken leg.  Grandmother Mitchell (Kathleen Mulqueen) comes to stay with Henry, and Dennis, resulting in a very different family dynamic.  Gloria Henry is sorely missed, leaving the writers to work around her absence as best they can.  The lack of cohesion in the Mitchell home, seems to result in stories that are even more centered on Dennis and Mr. Wilson.

If you liked Season One, you will probably enjoy Season Two as much or more.  The program becomes a little unbalanced during the period that Gloria Henry's role is reduced, but it gets back on track with some strong episodes, after her return.  In some ways, the program's ""torture humor"" approach is refined, and made slightly more palatable in this season, as Dennis The Menace finished at #11, the highest in its four year run.  While not for everyone, this type of humor has seldom been done much better.",1365120000,2,3347,4.9499105545617175

3426192,4,B001992NXI,"Cartoonist Hank Ketcham's own son Dennis, was the inspiration for Dennis Mitchell, the mischievous son of Henry and Alice Mitchell, the leading characters in the family based comic strip Dennis the Menace.  Debuting in newspapers in 1951, the comic became a success, and eventually came to television in 1958.

While perhaps ambitious, the adaptation from the comics to television was excellent, making Dennis a little older, and fleshing out rather basic themes and concepts, into half hour adventures filled with innocent fun for Dennis, and aggravation and frustration for most of the adults concerned.  Dennis was a character who created chaos, but still remained likeable.  With nearly everything dependent on the casting of Dennis, Jay North proved to be a fortuitous choice.  Like walking a tightrope, this is kind of humor is tricky and hard to do, but North mostly pulls it off.  Dressed in his trademark striped shirt and overalls, he isn't the cutest most lovable kid around, but there's enough sweetness and innocence present, to make the concept work.

While North is definitely the key, the outstanding cast is also integral to the program's success.  Herbert Anderson is absolutely perfect, as the real life personification of Henry Mitchell.  Gloria Henry is very good as Alice Mitchell.  The Mitchell's neighbors the Wilson's, are younger than in the comic strip.  Sylvia Field is endearing as Martha Wilson, but it is the wonderful performance of Joseph Kearns as the long suffering ""good old Mr. Wilson"", which truly makes this program a comedy classic.  A retiree, George Wilson's hobbies of gardening and coin collecting, are frequently incorporated into the stories.  Sadly, Kearns unexpectedly passed away in 1962, during the program's third season, resulting in a significant change in the direction of the series.

The terror of the neighborhood, Dennis' antics are a constant challenge to his parents, and frequently push Mr. Wilson close to the edge of his limits, causing him to exclaim ""Great Scott!"", and resort to gulping ""nerve medicine"", to try and remain calm.  Only occasionally does Dennis become too aggravating, but unless you are a masochist, or don't get tired of hearing the phase ""jeepers"", this may be a program best viewed in small doses.

Dennis' many adventures include the hosting of an ""open house"" at the Mitchell residence, the digging of a hole for a swimming pool in Mr. Wilson's back yard, and numerous stories featuring various animals including bees, mice, starlings, ducks, and even an artistic dog.  Together with his friends Tommy (Billy Booth), Margaret (Jeannie Russell), and Stewart (Ron Howard), Dennis keeps things in the neighborhood lively through the 32 episodes in the first season, which concludes with the George Wilson on his way to the police station, for selling Valentine cards without a license.  It you like your comedy with a playful mean streak, check out Dennis the Menace.",1363478400,,2951,5.189873417721519

The humor is simple and tasteful but still highly laughable -- just what you would expect from quality sit-coms, atleast until you see the riff of today which cannot make a mild smile occur without being an inuendo of something less family friendly.

3426228,5,B001992NXI,"I'm not really into 50's television too terribly much, but Dennis the Menace was aired and replayed for decades after its initial release, and I remember growing up with it replaying in the 70's as a kid, and enjoying it.

After just now revisiting it, over 30 years later, I am amazed how brilliantly nuclear 1950's it is, and how completely unlikeable Dennis is! He is bad by today's standards...dishonest, passive aggressive, mean-spirited, and always ruining people's days.  No wonder Mr. Wilson hates him and acts the way he does!

Sure, despite all that, its funny, if not ridiculous, as he takes advantage of his more humble and gentle friend, to get away with his plots of annoying the crap out of everyone, and sneaking out of the house or causing general mayhem.

This is all rewarded usually, with loving acceptance from his parents, who simply laugh-off his behavior and make little long term efforts to change him.

Mr. Wilson's character and casting is priceless, along with his dog, and the series somehow succeeds despite one of the most annoying, unlikeable central characters in the history of early television.",1357948800,2,1129,4.9523809523809526

3426266,5,B001992NXI,"Elm Street is where Dennis Mitchell lived with his parents and next door neighbour Mr Wilson. Shout Factory has released all four seasons of this series on DVD.It's about a small boy named Dennis who always ends up causing havoc, although,unintentionally, and his harassed neighbour Mr Wilson played by Joseph Kearns. I have never seen the comic strip created by Hank Ketcham that this show is based on and therefore have no idea what Dennis'  character was like. But,I have to say that Jay North was excellent as Dennis. He had to dye his hair blonde and had a piece of his hair at the back stuck in curlers and sprayed so that it would stick up while filming.
There is a great cast of semi-regulars here like Mr Finch who runs the drug store played by Charles Lane,who played Homer Bedlow on ""Petticoat Junction"".He lived to be 102 years old. Wow! Then, there is Willard Waterman who played Mr Quigley the market owner. Mrs Elkins the cat lover played by Irene Tedrow and Mrs Cathcart played by Mary Wickes who was after a man. Any man. Joseph Kearns was perfectly cast as Mr Wilson.
Stories mostly revolved around Dennis and Mr Wilson like when Dennis takes one of Mr Wilson's rare coin collection to but a candy bar from a vending machine,or, the time when Dennis changed the street signs so that Wilson ends up with a big hole in his back yard to have a swimming pool installed by mistake ,or, when Dennis digs up Mr Wilson's plants to put in what he thinks are better looking plants which end up being sweet potatoes instead,or,Dennis entering a soapbox derby only to have Mr Wilson end up in the driving seat. Joseph Kearns would die half-way through the third season and would be replaced by his brother John played by Gale Gordon from ""Our Miss Brooks and ""The Lucy Show"".
The extra's on Season One include sponsor spots and interviews with Gloria Henry who played Dennis' mother and Jeannie Russell who played ""that dumb old Margaret"" on the show who more or less menaced Dennis by wanting to play house with her dolls. Extra's on season Two are sponsor spots. Season Three and Four have no extra's.
This show is consistently good throughout it's four year run and is still great viewing today.",1344384000,2,2204,4.593908629441624

I would highly suggest this collection for anyone who loves family sitcoms like, ""Leave it to Beaver,"" ""The Brady Bunch,"" ""The Donna Reed Show,"" ""The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet,"" ""Father Knows Best,"" ""Punky Brewster,"" ""Family Matters,"" ""Full House,"" or ""Growing Pains.""",1319500800,4,536,5.137931034482759

3426275,5,B001992NXI,"I like the fact that Dennis Mitchell put back the Dahlia bulbs, in Mr. Wilson's garden, but Henry Mitchell was douced by Mr. Wilson, thinking cats were in his garden, that night as Henry Mitchell was heard planting the real sweet potatoes, (that Dennis had taken back and re-planted the expensive Dahlia bulbs,) back in to Mr. Wilson's Garden! That one night, Mr. Wilson heard both Dennis and Henry, in his garden. Dennis escaped, by saying ""meow"", to imitate a cat. Later that evening, as Henry was in Mr. Wilson's garden, Mr. Wilson heard him making noises and had a bucket of water ready if he heard another noise, that he thought may be a cat.
  Afterwards; that same summer, both Dennis Mitchell AND Mr. Wilson won a first place ribbon, Dennis's award was for the Dahlia bulbs, that were in Mr. Wilson's garden, originally and as Dennis first saw them he thought they were extremely poor, weak, almost dried out and dead SWEET POTATOES!
ONE ADDITIONAL FACT: Mr. Wilson's award was more unique the first award, (given to Dennis Mitchell), for his ""CREATIVY"" in gardening. Both of them won an award and were happy as this classic episode concludes!",1318809600,,1151,4.75

3426277,4,B001992NXI,"I grew up watching this wonderful TV series back in the 70's and have long awaited the release of Dennis the Menace on DVD.  These DVD's have enabled me to go back in time for a while to my child hood and relive some great days of great TV. I was surprised at how many of the stories and plot lines I remembered while watching these DVD's.
 SHOUT has released all Season Two episodes and they appear to be unedited. The DVD's come housed in a plastic DVD case and has the cover art as the disc art printed on the DVD label.
SHOUT has made it known that these are made from the syndicated prints and have not been re-mastered. For that I am going to only give it a four star rating. The show is an old show and the prints do show scratches and dust and wear. The sound is very good but not excellent.  In my opinion, this show should have been given the same re-mastered release treatment that Leave it to Beaver got but it didn't. So, hopefully with the announcement of the last season, season 4, around the corner, SHOUT will go back to the original negatives and restore them and re-release this show as a complete series box set.  But with all if that said, SHOUT gives a lot of bang for your buck with this set and it is a must buy.",1318291200,3,1236,4.1375
3426278,5,B001992NXI,Dennis The Menace is a great show for adults and your children too. My kids love this show. They like it when Mr. Wilson gets mad. Joseph Kearns made the show funny. Once he died it was no good anymore. Dennis The Menace was 100 times better than Leave It To Beaver. I enjoy the security and the happiness of Dennis The Menace. It reminds me of how good life was in the 1950's and early 1960's. Every episode is totally entertaining.,1317513600,7,433,4.2926829268292686
3426279,5,B001992NXI,"Who in their right mind would pay $51.99 to watch this online, when you can purchase the DVD for less than half that price.  What a rip off.",1316390400,,140,4.0
3426280,3,B001992NXI,"I grew up watching re-runs of ""Dennis the Menace"" on the local D.C. TV station.  It was one of my favorite shows as a kid and I think I probably saw every episode in syndication before the age of 10.  I was really excited and delighted with the first season on DVD.  Its a real keeper, full of top notching writing and story lines.  This formula, along with the wonderful character actor Joseph Kearns as the grumpy Mr. Wilson, made for a set I didn't want to end.  I was thrilled that in short order Shout Factory! would release season 2.  I preordered it immediately.

Now that its in my hands and in my DVD player what do I think?  The season started out great with the usual tight and crisp writing that made the first season such a pleasure. Somehow the writing made the precocious Dennis Mitchell the perfect comic foil to Mr. Mitchell.  Somewhere about half way through the first 15 episodes or so of this second season, things started to go downhill. I believe it was a change it writers.  Suddenly the tightly scripted plots turned into meandering and at times quite disjointed affairs.  The result is fewer laughs and more yawns.  I'm not sure why this was so.  Were they trying to tone Dennis and Mr. Wilson down?  In doing so, they created more yawns and giggles. Maybe not everyone will agree with this.  To me, the change was quick and painful.  I'm hoping the next season, which I believe was the first for Gale Gordon will fare better with time.

Shout Factory gives a lot of bang for the buck here, tough.  For around 20 bucks for 38 episodes of entertainment, you can't go wrong in the final analysis.  The prints are greatly improved over Season 1.  It is very encouraging that this company hasn't abandoned the format all together.  Releasing ""Dennis the Menace"" on DVD is testament to that.",1316304000,5,1811,4.510769230769231
3426281,3,B001992NXI,I have very fond memories of this series as a kid and purchased this for a long trip to Colorado.  Unfortunately my kids soon lost interest (ages 5 and 9) since Dennis was not so much at the forefront of mischief as I had remembered it.  Perhaps the series becomes more about that as we progress through the years.  It might be good to have a Top 20 of this series and a recommendation for appropriate ages.  Perhaps we will skip a few and see how it is.,1315267200,,454,4.125

I did not like when they changed Mr Wilson in the series though...jsut never the same in movies or series when they change the actors/actresses.. I too wish they would put Lassie out..Jeff and Timmy...Anyway..anyone that likes vintage TV and comedy will love this series..",1312329600,3,635,4.521739130434782
3426296,5,B001992NXI,"Believe it or not, Season Two surpasses Season One, all due to the sparkling performances of Jay North, Herbert Anderson, Gloria Henry, Billy Booth, Sylvia Field, and the inimitable Joseph Kearns.  They are all just so entertaining to watch---all pros at their craft, with special praise for the child actors.  Billy Booth and Jay North are so natural together.  Watch their scenes carefully, study their facial expressions, especially Booth's.  Just terrfific!  And Joe Kearns hit his career pinnacle, of course, after serving in supporting roles in film, TV, and most of all, radio.  His George Wilson may be predictable, but never boring.  Kearns' interactions with Sylvia Field (another charmer) and North are delightful.  The most amazing thing about the season (and all four seasons) is the wealth of character actors in semi-regular and guest appearances.  Mary Wickes shines brightly this season as mancrazy Miss Cathcart...some of her best work.  Irene Tedrow, always reliable, adds grit as Kearns' nemesis Mrs. Elkins.  Paul Barselow, Charles Lane, Jeannie Russell, and the rest make Dennis' neighborhood the place to be for character-actor fans.  Special nod to Spring Byington, playing herself in a guest spot between her runs on DECEMBER BRIDE and LARAMIE.  Innocent fun and hearwarming, especially when crusty Kearns realizes the error of his ways and the ""Mr. Wilson"" theme plays, tugging at your heart as it did fifty years ago.  Looking forward to Season Three already and hoping Four (albeit sans Kearns) will be released to make it all complete.",1312329600,7,1564,5.254032258064516
3426297,5,B001992NXI,"Much has been written here about this series and I agree that Dennis the Menace is a great series that is fun to watch! My favorite characters are Mr. Wilson (The first Mr. Wilson) and Seymour. This series came from a time when funny didn't need nor would be allowed to relay of sexual innuendos which is refreshing to me.

One thing I have noticed on both Season One and Season Two sets is that the volume levels between episodes can vary quite a lot, particularly Season Two. I hope this is something with my DVD player and not the DVD sets... but I'm wondering if anyone else is experiencing the different volume levels between episodes during play back?",1312243200,,657,4.5210084033613445

No other boy than Dennis Mitchell has ever represented my childhood better. His daily life was different every time. Dennis was always looking to do or try something new. He never stuck to the same thing for too long or he would get bored. Huh,...sounds like me when I was young. I have these episodes on DVD and watch them alot because I like to step back in time to my childhood frequently because life back then was simpler in a simpler time (sixties-seventies).

I would like to read a biography of him and his life off the screen. I will definitely consider buying this TV series. As a child actor, Jay North endeared himself big time to me. That is why I will strongly consider buying this TV series of Dennis the Menace. addendum to review: I also liked the way this 5 dvd set was packaged. I think companies like Universal Studios and Disney could learn from this. The packaging was professional and a big plus to this movie.

This is a 5-disc set which includes all 32 eps from S1 in their original unedited format with the original beginning tags, as well as a bunch of extras, such as new interviews (this is 39 minutes in total!), ""Dennis the Menace"" promos and vintage commercials and a bonus ep with Dennis on ""The Donna Reed Show."" The only thing I regret about watching these DVDs is that I completed it so quickly, but these are the types of shows that you can watch over and over again. This is packaged in a clear plastic case and each of the 5 discs includes a color silkscreen picture of Dennis on it, also included is a color insert which details all of the eps (see pics I posted of everything). Each ep is just over 25 minutes in total, inclusive of the opening and closing credits. S2 of ""Dennis the Menace"" will be out in July so longtime fans of the series won't have to wait much longer.

I own most of the seasons of these shows and have watched them many times and marvel at the insight and creativity. Then I watch Dennis The Menace which I will refer to as DTM. DTM is a shallow, predictable, and almost irritating sitcom that barely gets a chuckle out of me. Unlike Leave It To Beaver, there is no ""lesson"" among the natural humor. Unlike Andy Griffith or Gomer Pyle, there are not the stellar acting performances and insightful writing. DTM, like it's comic strip, lacks entertainment value. My kids won't even watch it, and they normally ""burn through"" every oldies DVD season series I purchase before I can watch one disc. I myself have only managed to watch one disc of the season, but I will ""try"" to watch them all.

The extras are WONDERFUL with Jeannie Russell and Gloria Henry.  They both look great and their stories are great!  The radio interview was good, you just wonder why the silenced episodes which were running during the audio of the radio interview, kept going after the radio interview had ended.

It really is an escape to view these episodes,and for a short time forget all of today's problems. I had actually never seen the series,although after all the 5 star reviews,I decided to add this to my library. I couldn't be happier that I did. I look forward to season two.

It was funny. I grew up watching the animated series and thought I might like the live action version since I'm also a fan of classic TV shows. Since DENNIS THE MENACE has kids in it like  LEAVE IT TO BEAVER (My favorite black & white half-hour show), I can tell I'm gonna like this show. For the low price, 32 episodes, and bonus material that Shout Factory has gathered for this collection, how can you possibly pass this up.

It's one of the best 1950's-1960's shows around, and unlike Leave it to Beaver, was not seen on TV for many decades.

But lets get back to what has dropped TV Land down in the ratings and that is the great series that are being released on dvd like this classic. I must say I had the greatest experience years ago in Cherry Hill New Jersey where there was a retro TV Convention and I got to sit and talk with Jay North who was the only dennis The menace in anyone who knows tv Eyes. Jay was great and gave me his address to send the pictures I had with him to have him sign them. When I show people the pictures they only have to look at the eyes of jay to know he is Dennis the menace.

3426422,5,B001992NXI,"Due to the personal problems that Jay North had with the series as well as copyright issues has kept the series from being seen. Just like with the Patty Duke Show, its star had issues as shown by her two autobiographies. I tried contactin Patty by email but never heard back. I remember well the interviews that Jay North gave and in particular with Phil Donohue where he told how much he hated the series and that his TV Parents loved him more than his real Parents. Originally, I believe the new Attenae TV Channel, launching at midnight said they were going to show it but it was not on their released schedule. I will enjoy seeing it again. I can understand how Mr. North feels but I believe he had to sign-off before the DVDs could be made. For some reason a lot of the older shows hold up better than current programs because as Carl Reiner said of the original Dick Van Dyke show the material did not feature current event themed episodes. The exception to this rule was The Cosby Show, that featured episodes about the death of Dr. Martin Luther King and the Black Baseball League. It contrasted how these events affected the Huxtible family. As to the question about some of the classic tv shows like Leave it to Beaver and My Three Sons not being uncut again it might be needing to the actors signing off and rights vs. public domain. Enjoy the shows and be glad they are back in some form.",1293753600,7,1401,4.413127413127413

I have purchased dozens of other television shows from the late 1950s and early 1960s and have really enjoyed watching them all again. However Dennis the Menace is the one television series from this era that really does epitomize my childhood and brings back such wonderful memories for me. I never imagined that I would be watching that lovable rascal Dennis on my television screen again. In conclusion I would just like to extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to all those people concerned in making this great tv series available to all fans of Dennis the Menace. Just as a postscript: When Dennis the Menace was shown in Britain it was called ""Just Dennis.""
At the time there was a funny papers character called Dennis the Menace and so the the tv series Dennis the Menace received the alternate title so as not to confuse it with the funny papers character.",1293321600,52,993,4.584269662921348

3426457,5,B001992NXI,"Just got this set yesterday, I was really looking forward to this when I heard that Shout Factory! was going to start releasing this series on DVD, and could not wait for the set to be released, well finally, here it is (Here's Lucy Season 4 came out the same day for those Lucy fans) so what a day for me, anyways, this is a five star set all the way, right off when I bought it I noticed it's the packaging that I like with the clear plastic case with the spindle inside which holds 4 discs, the 5th is placed on the inside of the back of the case, it seems like a lot of companies are releasing TV sets like this nowaydays, and it's the best, and from the start of the first episode, I knew this was nice, the picture is clear with a few minor rips and tears but it will get better, and they go away, the audio is loud and clear, and it looks like the bonus features are going to be nice as well, and at a great price, I mean, you get 32 episodes, for about $20.00, and it's well worth the money, this will bring back a lot of childhood memories for me as I remember watching this show everyday when Nickelodeon had it on reruns in the 1990's, and was always wondering when and if this series would ever get released on DVD, and here it is, and I am looking forward to the rest of the series being released, Shout Factory! has done it right again, just like they did with ""Leave it to Beaver"", so bottom line, if you were ever a fan of this show, and want to see it again and again like me and many others, buy all means, this set is well worth $20.00!

Ok, so I guess there a problem with the reviews for season 2, so I will just do it on this one, I got this back when it came out which was in July, it's now December, I forgot to do a review for this one because I recently got season 3 and reviewed it, so I thought I'd throw up a review for season 2, so you get all 38 episodes from the second season on a five disc set, and if you bought the first season you know what the packaging is, which I love by the way, so no changes there, the episodes are even better than I remembered them from the early to mid 1990's when I watched them on Nick at Nite and Nickelodeon, really brings me back, because these haven't been aired since like 2003, and I hadn't seen it in years until Shout Factory! started releasing them, and they have done a fantastic job of getting the seasons out, as here it is December 6th, and they just started releasing the series in April, and we already have the first 3 seasons and season 4 is due out in January, and the episodes look really good, no they haven't been remastered or anything, but for something this old, these are most likely the best prints they could get, and like I said, they look fantastic, the audio can be a bit low at times, but not too bad, and it doesn't happen very often, this is another 5 star release from Shout Factory! and as of now if you bought this season 2, season 3 is available, and season 4 will be next month.

YES, The complete series will be here before you know it!",1292284800,7,3040,4.039800995024875
3426458,5,B001992NXI,"I remember discovering ""Dennis the Menace"" on Nickelodeon back in the 80s and loving the show. It was old, black and white and completely unlike the other programming on Nick BUT I loved it. I know for a fact that lots of other people liked it too. When will Sony realize that there is a huge market for the original Jay North series? Not only will baby boomers from it's first-run buy it but also everyone who watched it and grew-up with it on Nick. Unlike lots of other old series this show has a definite multi-generational appeal. Sony you are missing a great opportunity. If you won't release it at least let another company, like Shout Factory, do it.

FOOTNOTE: Since I wrote this review (or should I say pleaded for a release), this series has been announced for release by Shout Factory. I could not be happier! I just hope the episodes are as crisp and clear as they appeared on Nick (the Donna Reed episodes do not look anywhere as crisp on DVD as they did on Nick-At-Nite) and I hope they keep the original Screen Gems ID at the end of each show. I hate the way they cut the original ID's off of classic TV series! It would be like Ted Turner cutting the MGM, RKO and Warner Brothers ID's off of those films and sticking his own ID on them just because he bought the film libraries. I don't mind if they add an extra new ID at the beginning (like Universal & Turner does with its old movies) or at the very end... just keep what is original too!

NEW FOOTNOTE: Pre-ordered this set and have been enjoying it since receiving it. GREAT JOB SHOUT FACTORY! Have watched just about the whole set (ready for season two!) and have loved every episode so far. Just a note on quality: all the shows look as sharp and clear as they did on Nickelodeon back in the day AND Shout Factory retains the complete, original Screen Gems ID at the end just like Nick did. So, if you think they are going to be lacking in quality don't worry about it... these shows are mint. This is the way all classic TV series should be released.",1288137600,9,2024,4.309711286089239

Granted the show went down hill a tad during the last year after Joseph Kearns (original Mr Wilson) died suddenly and Jay North was getting to old for the role.  Hard to believe, but some parents from that era reacted to Dennis the same way parents today have reacted to Bart Simpson and kept the show off limits.  In truth, Dennis was/is a harmless kid both in the comic strip and on TV.  He was toned down a bit for TV as he was not quite as brash as he was in the comic strip.
