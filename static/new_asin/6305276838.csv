If you want to see such historical figures  as Captain Lou Albano, Classie Freddie Blassie, and even Bruno Sammartino,  then this video is for you.  But if you're into seeing great matches, then  leave this one alone and go for later WrestleManias.

Beginning with a ""jobber"" contest consisting of Tito Santana  and ""professional loser"" Playboy Buddy Rose in an Executioner  outfit and ending with a lackluster Tag Team contest as a Main Event, it is  near guaranteed that you will feel unsatisfied once the video is over.  There is not one great match-up in the video, as it is filled with  disgustingly boring matches such as Big John Studd vs. Andre the Giant and  the 30 second snoozefest pitting King Kong Bundy and ""Special  Delivery"" Jones.

1004207,3,6305276838,"To tell you guys the truth, this is definitly not th best WrestleMania they make it look like. Sure it has memerable moments, but it is not that great. Here are the matches.

1. Tito Santana vs. The Executioner 7/10

Decent opener, but I have seen better in this sytle of wrestling. And yes this is the first match in WrestleMania history.

2. King Kong Bundy vs. S.D. Jones 10/10

Excellent match. I know it was REALLY short but I thought it was funny to see S.D. Jones get put away so quick. Watch it if you want to have a quick laugh.

3. Matt Borne vs. Ricky Steamboat 7/10

I actually liked this match, there were a lot of things going on but I did not feel satisfied. Good attempt though.

4. Brutus Beefcake vs. David Sammartino 5/10

Worst match of the night. I mean it was just a plain boring match man. The good thing was to see Bruno Sammartino there though. Bad ending as well.

5. Greg The Hammer Valentine vs. Junkyard Dog 6/10

Slow match. Junkyard Dog was actually winning but I am gald he did not win the title though, he won by Count-Out. It would have been better to see Junkyard Dog get caught in a submission hold, and have The Hammer win.

6. Nikolai Volkoff and The Iron Shiek vs. Mike Rotundo and Barry Windham 8/10

I liked this match. Finally there was a change here where there is an upset and the bad guys win. But I still do not believe that Rotundo and Windham did not win the match though.

7. Big John Studd vs. Andre The Giant (Body Slam Challange) 6/10

I like John Studd and Andre but this match was terrible because it was SO boring. Would have been a 5/10 if it weren't for the memorable Body slam at theend where Andre wins. Big upset that the match was bad.

8. Leilani Kai vs. Wendi Richter 8/10

Why can't all women's matches be more like this one. I liked it because it is very diferent from what we see now. Has a good ending too.

9. Rowdy Roddy Piper and Mr. Wonderful Paul Orndorff vs. Hulk Hogan and Mr. T 9/10

Good and exciting match. The crowd was also really into it as well. The ending is funny when Cowboy Bob Orton hits Orndorff with is cast by accident and that allows Hogan and Mr. T to get the victory.",1108684800,2,2159,4.199029126213592

So I stress to the sellers out there if you have the original coliseum video versions sell those those are the quality tapes the wwe is trying to hide. because thats the old WWF.and in my opinion the way Vince McMhan acts he doesn't really like the old WWF or the real set of poeple that helped make him what he is to day.,1065398400,3,534,4.047169811320755
1004209,4,6305276838,"The first Wrestlemania was a history-making event that was broadcasted live from Madison Square Garden through many closed-circuit theatres.

Muhammad Ali served as guest referee and legends, ""Superfly"" Jimmy Snuka and ""Cowboy"" Bob Orton worked as outside cornermen for their respective teams.
The inaugurial Wrestlemania also saw a ""$15,000 Body Slam Challenge"" between Andre The Giant and Big John Studd. You also got a Women's Title match where Cyndi Lauper was present in the corner of challenger Wendi Richter. Another big highlight had the massive King Kong Bundy squashing Special Delivery Jones in a record-breaking nine seconds.

1004211,5,6305276838,"It was Howard Finkel vs his daughter Maggie Finkel in an anywhere falls hardcore bikini match. The Fink won after a devastating hair pull that knocked his daughter unconscious!

Next up was Hogan vs Doink and Dink in a handicap Casseroul My Florist match. After a double team in which Dink shoved Hogan over a bent over Doink, the match was over. As a pre-match stipulation, Hogan had to give up his role as Mayor of Cleveland over to the Quebecers.

Now came the long awaited match between Owen Hart and Brock Lesnar with Lou Thesz as the special referee. After a devasating F-5, Owen looked to have won it, but then Nelson Mandela shocked everyone by double crossing his former friend, giving Brock the win, despite being in hospital at the time.

The next match was Bret Hart vs Kama from the Nation Of Domination (later known as The Godfather). Before the match Kurt Angle and Gorilla Monsoon beat Bret to a pulp, but he still pulled off the victory after a top rope eye rake that was heard around the world. Kama reportedly needed 67 operations to his eyelash, putting him out of commission for 12 and a half years.

Now came B-2 vs Pedro Morales for the Intercontinental championship in a Heaven in a Cellphone match. The title switched hands when B-2 pressed the hash key, electrocuting Morales, thus making him submit. Afterwards they shook hands and had coffee. Pedro died but was later reincarnated into Steven Richards.

Tag Team action next as The Bushwhackers took on the defending NWA tag team champions The A Team (Charlie Haas and Shelton Benjamin), although it was the vacant WWE Tag Team Championship that was on the line. After Butch had been Chin Locked through 3 announce tables, it looked like it was over. But Luke held his own and finally pinned the referee (which was the stipulation) to become the Tag Team champion, although Butch didn't win. Next night on RAW, he lost the titles to Vince McMahon Sr and Nathan Jones, with some help from a penguin called Aaron.

Now we get to the double main event. First, the WWE championship match between Andre The Giant and Spike Dudley. After going at it for near 30 minutes, Andre finally won, although he had to use a steel folding chair in order to get the three count.

Finally, there was the handicap Buttercups In Space match. Randy Savage, Superstar Billy Graham, The Rock, Mean Mark Callous, Giant Gonzales, Diesel, Yokozuna, HBK, The British Bulldog, Stone Cold, Vader, Ken Shamrock, Mick Foley (all three personas) The Honky Tonk Man, Jake 'The Snake' Roberts, Enrico 'The Condor' Martinez, Billy Gunn, Bobby 'The Brain' Henan, Seargent Slaughter, Brother Love, The Gobbly Gooker, Mean Gean Okerland, Bob Backlund, Andrew 'The Killer Corgette' Barrison, John Cena, Edge and Y2J against Max Mini. Unsuprisingly, Max Mini was the victor.

So there you have it. Buy it, enjoy it, live it. Oh, also did I mention Jerry Lawler and JR vs Mae Young and the Fabulous Moolah with the L.O.D as guest commentators? It was a good ladder match!

1004215,4,6305276838,"I hate to say this, but I watched this only a half-hour ago. The 80's, in my a opinion, spawned the golden age of wrestling. All the matches at this particular event were great. The Andre-Studd match, in particular, was excellent. Matches between 350+-pounders usually suck, but not this time. Unfortunately, everyone knew the late(caution:spoiler ahead) Andre was going to win because the WWF wasn't going to retire somebody like him.
Sadly, the WWF apparently deleted some interviews from this VHS. Also, the Hogan/Tee-Piper/orndorff main event was good, but shoudn't have been a tag-match. I think they should have had Piper take on Hogan for the belt and ditched Orndorf and Tee.

7886747,4,6305276838,"This is where it all began for the biggest wrestling event which is Wrestlemania. This was a SUPER event for its time as several celebrities of the time [Like Mr. T and Cyndi Lauper] were on hand for this show which took place at the historical Madison Square Garden. If you're a newer wrestling fan keep in mind that this was a very different era in wrestling meaning that there is no crazy gimmick matches to be seen here and there is very little weapons use to be seen here. This is the WWF [now known as WWE] at its prime as Hulkamania was going full blast and the WWF was for the first time becoming big business beyond just the wrestling business. Although this event is a little dated by today's standards, It still is a fun event to watch and you do get a glimpse of some future Hall Of Famers in the primes of their careers. Here's my thoughts on the matches:

1. Tito Santana VS. The Executioner
This was an ok opener nothing special. It was nice to see Tito pick up the win here. ***

2. King Kong Bundy VS. S.D. Jones
THIS is the infamous match where S.D. Jones lost in less than 10 seconds!!!! A squash match if there ever was one, this is at least good for a few laughs. **1/2

3. Ricky Steamboat VS. Matt Borne
This was a pretty good match with some good action courtesy of Steamboat. Steamboat was still in the prime of his career here and judging from his good performance in this match, i don't see why Steamboat never became WWF champion at least once during his run with the company. Steamboat wins. ***1/2

4. Brutus Beefcake VS. David Sammartino
Bruno Sammartino manages his son here against Brutus in this average match. A little boring at times it does pick up a little toward the end before the unsatisfying double disqualification ending. **1/2

5. For the WWF Intercontinental Championship
Champion Greg Valentine VS. Junkyard Dog [RIP]
Our first of three title matches for this show turns out to be a pretty decent affair and is one of the best matches i've ever seen that featured the late Junkyard Dog. Junkyard Dog wins by countout. ***

6. For the WWF World Tag Team Championships
Champions Mike Rotundo & Barry Windham VS. The Iron Sheik & Nikolai Volkoff
This was a pretty good match which of course had an all-american tag team [Rotundo & Windham] taking on an anti-american tag team [Sheik & Volkoff]. There was some nice action throughout this match as well as some funny antics from the managers [who were the late Freddie Blassie and the late Capt. Lou Albano] outside of the ring. Sheik & Volkoff won the titles here. On a side note, Mike Rotundo would later become Irwin R. Schyster in the early 90's which is the gimmick he's most remembered for. ***1/2

7. $15,000 Slam Match
Andre The Giant [RIP] VS. Big John Studd [RIP]
For a big man's match, This wasn't half bad and was one of the highlights of the event. While i seriously doubt the money in the bag was real, The story for this match was that Andre couldn't slam Big John Studd and Studd was so confident about it that Studd and his manager the great Bobby Heenan were willing to put $15,000 on the line [wonder how much that would be if it were done today]. Needless to say after a little effort, Andre did indeed slam Studd and he won the match and the money [even throwing some in the crowd before Heenan stole the money back from him]. ***

8. For the WWF Women's Championship
Champion Leilani Kai VS. Wendi Richter
With Cyndi Lauper in her corner, Wendi Richter challenged Leilani Kai for her women's title and this is a pretty damn good women's match. While neither of these women look half as good as the ex-strippers and models that currently fill WWE's joke of a women's division, They sure could wrestle a hell of a lot better than they can and this match proves this claim!! In what is the second best match of this event, These 2 women duke it out in a good match which should be seen by every ''diva'' on the current WWE roster. Also, The legendary Fabolous Moolah appears here as the manager of Leilani Kai. Richter wins the title. ****

9. Hulk Hogan & Mr. T VS. Roddy Piper & Paul Orndorff
Special Guest Referee: Muhammad Ali
In a rare event, Hogan happens to have the match of the night. With the legendary former boxing champion Muhammad Ali serving as special guest referee and Liberace [you read it right] serving as the time keeper, This tag match is fun and even has a sense of humor throughout [which does nothing but good here]. Even Mr. T puts on a halfway decent performance here which was totally not expected given how celebrities often fare poorly in wrestling matches [Look at Snooki's involvement at Wrestlemania 27 this year]. All four men are a delight to watch in this match and when Hogan is in the ring with people who're actually good wrestlers [ala Piper and Orndorff], He often has good matches. Definitely watch this match as it is an example of how Hogan can sometimes deliver good matches. Also, look out for appearances by Jimmy Snuka [Managing Hogan's team] and Cowboy Bob Orton [Managing Piper's team]. **** [Best match of the event]

There is some filler matches on this show but thankfully much of them are not really long at all and for a first Wrestlemania, this isn't bad at all. Keep in mind that this Wrestlemania unlike all of them that would follow, was NOT on pay-per-view but instead was shown on closed-circuit tv. I reccomend this show to fans of 80's WWF, 80's wrestling, Old school wrestling fans, and newer wrestling fans who simply wanna see how Wrestlemania began. NOTE: To date, This show is still only available as an individual title on VHS. To get it on DVD, You have to either buy the very expensive Wrestlemania DVD box set or buy vol. 1 of that very same set. Be warned that the DVD version on this set features some generic alternate music throughout in place of some of the original music [noticably the ending theme which was the Beverly Hills Cop theme]. The VHS leaves nothing out and you should order a copy of the original coliseum video release of this event [leave that crappy EP-recorded 1998 re-release alone]. Definitely check out this essential event",1303171200,,6133,4.512151215121512
7886748,2,6305276838,"I've watched every WrestleMania but couldn't remember this one. I was watching the A-Team recently and really wanted to see how Mr. T faired in the ring, so I pulled out the dvd and watched the event that started it all

Gene Okerlund sings the National Anthem and has a note card. Shouldn't he know it? Not a bad singing job in probably the only time he has sung in the WWF.

Tito Santana VS Executioner: Executioner is undefeated and he stumbles thru his promo. I don't know who he was but he did sound familiar. The only Satana match i've ever seen where Ventura doesnt call Santana a bunch of different Mexican names, maybe that was a later gimmick. Executioner looks terrible in the match and only got in a few moves. A basic squash job with Santana placing Executioner in the move that Executioner said he'd put Santana in. Santana looks very good but this was a basic squash match.

SD Jones VS King Kong Bundy: They said Bundy won in 9 seconds but it was longer then that. Unlike the Santana-Executioner match, this was just put Bundy over as a monster and a very quick squash match.

Matt Borne VS Ricky Steamboat: Borne would go on to later success as the first and the best Doink the Clown. This should break the crappy match streak as Steamboat is always fun to watch. The match had alot of side headlocks to start off, was slow paced but the ending picked up. Anther short, squash match.

Dave Sammartino VS Brutus Beefcake: I didn't know if I could sit through this one. This wasn't as bad as you'd expect but by no means a classic. The ending sucked.

Greg Valentine VS Junkyard Dog for the IC title: I've always enjoyed Valentine's work and he recently said WWE was working on a dvd about him. I don't know how true that is but i'd like to see more of his matches. This was anther short match that was a very good back and fourth encounter. Valentine wins with his own feet on the ropes.

Nikolai Volkoff and Iron Shiek VS Mike Rotundo and Barry Windham: One hour time limit? Can you imagine if it went that long? Sheik and Volkoff wins the tag team titles when Sheik hits Windham from behind with the cane. Unlike Moonson and Ventura, I think this event has been pretty crappy thus far.

Andre the Giant VS John Studd in 15,000 Body Slam Challenge Match: I skipped over this one, I already knew who won it. Not really much to say about this one but nothing worth watching again.

Leilani Kai VS Wendi Richter: Never ever watch women's wrestling.

Mr. T and The Hulkster VS Roddy Pipper and Paul Orndoff: This was a typical Hogan match circa 84-91. He got a good beaten then came back out of nowhere to win it. Mr. T looked good but rarely did anything. Hogan and T win it in the end.

Overall, though it started it all, it was hardly a classic. I'd only say two matches were worth watching (Steamboat/Borne and Valentine/JYD) and the rest sucked.",1284508800,,2863,4.403409090909091

The Women's title match between Wendi Richter with Cyndi Lauper in her corner & Leilani Kai with The Fabulous Moolah in her corner was not great but pretty good. The Andre The Giant-Big John Studd-$15,000 bodyslam match was slow but still fun to watch. The World tag team title match between The US Express(Mike Rotunda & Barry Windham) against the team of Nikolai Volkoff & The Iron Sheik was a hard-hitting/solid bout.

The ""Wrestlemania: The Legacy"" edition of WWF Wrestlemania I is the most accurate and complete edition of the event on the VHS or DVD format. Most editions of the event, including the Coliseum Video edition released in the 1980's and the current DVD release in the WWE Wrestlemania Boxed Set, do not include the original background and entrance music that was present on the original broadcast.

The version in the ""Wrestlemania: The Legacy"" boxed set (and with the grey ""The World Wrestling Federation Presents"" border) has every music cue exactly the way it was presented. The event opens with Phil Collins and Philip Bailey's ""Easy Lover"" as a theme song, Junkyard Dog enters to Queen's ""Another One Bites the Dust"", Wendi Richter and Cyndi Lauper use Lauper's ""Girls Just Wanna Have Fun"", Windham and Rotundo use Bruce Springsteen's ""Born In The USA"", and Hulk Hogan uses Survivor's ""Eye of the Tiger"".

7886753,2,6305276838,"I remember the huge build-up that Wrestlemania got back in '85, and it's clear that in its infancy, Vince McMahon and the WWF weren't really sure what they were going to get.

This video takes you through the event, and it came across like one of the TV shows, where the star goes into the ring and squashes a jobber in a matter of minutes.  Yes, there were some main-event caliber matches in the middle of the card, but a lot of these were really disappointing.

This was also the beginning of the end of the ""realism"" of pro wrestling, and it was when I started to get turned off by a lot of it, i.e., the hype, the subplots, the BS story lines.

The good matches?  Rick Steamboat and Matt Borne was entertaining, but you pretty much knew who was gonna win.  The Steamer put on his usual moves, and the veteran Borne did a good sell job.

Bruno Sammartino, Jr. against Brutus Beefcake was probably the best of all the matches.  The younger Sammartino never did achieve anywhere near the success of his famous father, but then how could anyone match that?  He gives it a good go against Beefcake, and there's the usual running around the ring of the elder Sammartino and Johnny Valiant.

Barry Windham and Mike Rotondo vs. Nikolai Volkoff and the Iron Sheik was a good old Cold War style battle, and this was pretty decent old school wrestling.  The bad guys won, but then again you can't have the goodies win 'em all or it'd be boring.

Now the clunkers:  King Kong Bundy squashes SD Jones (the fall guy all the time) in 9 seconds...a stupid joke if there ever was one.  Boring, nothing funny about it.

Wendi Richter w/Cyndi Lauper vs. Lelani Kai w/Fabulous Moohlah for the Women's title:  two women yanking each other around by the hair, and two prima donnas running around the ring outside.  Boring.

The main event was the biggest clunker of them all--now, Mr. T might have been physically strong, but he is dwarfed in the ring by Hogan, Piper and Orndorff, and it's obvious he is kept out of harm's way throughout the match.  Too much posing, stomping around and goofing off.  And the match ends in a way everyone had to see coming:  Bob Orton, Jr.'s attempt to conk Hogan with his cast backfires and the bad guys lose.

OK, entertaining for those who didn't want to see through all the idiocy, but I guess I just wasn't one of 'em.  Wrestlemania did get better, and McMahon should be applauded for trying different things to make wrestling have the mass appeal it does today.  But, well, this one just didn't do it for me on the whole.",1125100800,,2543,4.454545454545454
