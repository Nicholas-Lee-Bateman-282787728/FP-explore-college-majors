2230291,5,B0007PIDCK,"I received my set today(Sept 13) from Amazon. Originally rescheduled from May, I love the packaging and the colorized versions look good. Some Fox colorized versions have been bad and the original set a couple if years ago had an atrocious colorized Bright Eyes. The recent Australian releasee of this title in PAL is colorized only(no b&w versions)even worse. Many have been issued in  Australia in prices varying from A$8.62 to A$18.99. What is a disappointment is that I was under the impression that The Shirley Temple Storybook series was to start appearing in this new series and although two of the 3 titles have, in Special Features, the line The Shirley Temple Theatre there is no episodes from this series which I saw on Sunday evenings when they were new. What happened to those extras. The Little Miss Broadway trailer is has not titles or cast dialogue but the music track has been included. I asume(it is noted that this the case on the menu)that the footage has been lost but then it could have been ccarefully(the dialogue that is) from the original film tracks. Heidi was originally issued in Septiatone that was popular then and the NTSC laserdisc edition did preserve this version but there is a rare freeze frame at the start of the laserdisc)the scene where Shirley is being taken to see her granddad.

The Animal Crackers song in Curly Top has a noticeable splice that is in all versions I have seen including TV, Video, etc and also and records and cds from the original films of Shirley's films. Zanuck, for some reason, did not like his stars making commercial records and thus some Fox items appear on records as soundtracks in recent years reissues.",1126569600,8,1676,4.775862068965517
2230292,5,B0007PIDCK,"I saw this collection siting up in Walmart, and I couldn't resist. After paying about $10 for all of Shirley's other movies, I just couldn't resist! The whole box has a ""pink"" theme to it, which may turn off potential buyersm especially male ones. There are three discs inside ""Heidi"", ""Curly Top"", and ""Little Miss Broadway"". Each movie has a new cover design, an insert, and a charm. Packaged inside ""Heidi"" a little ziplock baggie holds a bracelet of charms of Wooden Shoes(Heidi) a Tiara(Little Miss Broadway) and a pony(curly top) This isn't very big, and would fit the wrist of probably a four year old, still a cute little bonus. The movies all have the colour and black&white versions. I compared the DVD's to the Videos, and from my opinion, both colour versions are exactly the same. The Black&Wgite versions are the same as the colour ones in terms of quality, only in black and white. No extra's disc-wise are in here, but they do have the theatracal trailers for the three movies, very bad quality, old, aged...They're were no attempts to restore them. The box is labelled ""Volume One"" so I'm hoping that they will eventually release all the movies on DVD's like this. They are avalible individual also. I'm guessing Box Two will have ""Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm"" ""Baby Take a Bow"" and ""Bright Eyes"" seeing as they are all said to be released on the same day as the box. I think they are releasing the movies all over again, only onto DVD. hopefully with a forward from Miss Temple herself.",1125619200,15,1503,4.675471698113207
2230293,5,B0007PIDCK,"here is a set of Shirley's CURLY TOP, HEIDI, and LITTLE MISS BROADWAY and,these have both  the black  and white and  brand new color versions, and, this new color  has really  knocked me out!!

HEIDI has  such  beautiful color, it truly looks like  it was truly  filmed in  color!!!!  The colors are so vibrant, they jump right  off the screen!  Shirley has never looked this beautiful on  film before, its as if this color has made her  features come much more to life!!

The mountain scenes are beautiful, where when we see The grandfather or Shirley outside of the cabin, the trees and the sky  are so beautiful. The tress are beautiful green, and the sky  is beautiful deep blue!!

The clothes that Shirley  wears are beautiful  with  the color and, wait till you see the christmas tree and all its colors!

One of the main  reasons  as to why  HEIDI looks so  good is because it was remastered and its  truly  flawless,its so clear and sharp!!  Again, Shirley has never looked so good ,and her adorable beauty truly  shines strong! The skin tone is done to perfection and, truly  this  great  Shirley  movie has never looked as good as this before!!

CURLY TOP is great too, but not as  good looking  as HEIDI because the print they used is the only  print  that Fox  appears to have so, there is the touch  of grain to the film but the color still shines thru beautifully.

Shirley  looks so adorable in this, and, when she sings ""Animal crackers"" she is soooooo very  adorable and  as you know she  as well as the other little girls wear the jean overalls and the color looks super  ,they are  very blue colored,and look  honest  to goodness like  this movie was filmed in  color!

LITTLE MISS BROADWAY is another winner with the color  again looking  as if it was filmed in  true color!!its so outstanding!

Thank  goodness theres more  of Shirley's films to come in this fantastic awesome color on November 22nd 2005 with BABY  TAKE A BOW, BRIGHT  EYES  and REBECCA OF SUNNYBROOK FARM, I am very excited and anxious for them and in time  all Shirley's Fox films will be  available on  DVD in this great  color!

You  will enjoy  this collection  very  much and, they  will make you fall in  love with little Shirley  all over again!!

ENJOY!",1125619200,13,2250,4.48989898989899

2230317,5,B0007PIDCK,What is there not to LOVE ABOUT Shirley Temple--RIP.  We have most of her childhood movies and this was a great addition.  Shirley was smart and talented as a child actress interesting to read about how good she really was with lines and dance numbers.  There will never be another like her. Then she was smart enough to move on and have a Full and productive life.,1396224000,,365,4.417910447761194

2230320,5,B0007PIDCK,"I realized many months ago that I wanted to watch some of Shirley Temple's movies again-- those times when it is raining and dark and dreary around here.  Since Heidi is on of my favorites, I chose this volume.  What a delight-- and how wonderful that though she is now gone, her films remain, despite their age.",1392940800,,312,4.456140350877193

2230331,5,B0007PIDCK,"Having a bad day? Depressed? Put one of these movies in and you'll feel much better.  Shirley Temple's singing and dancing just makes me feel good and happy. It may be old fashion and simple, but its clean and cute.",1384560000,,215,4.375

2230337,5,B0007PIDCK,"Move over Sesame Street, and other newer dance videos. My toddler granddaughter loves to dance with Shirley in this colorized version of Curly Top. The movie Heidi is a more serious topic with glimpses into prewar Europe. Both show Shirley Temple's personality. These still delight a wide range of age groups.",1372291200,,309,5.078431372549019
2230338,4,B0007PIDCK,"As a TRUE Shirley Temple fan, I had failed to realize how similar ALL of her movies were in storyline, pretty redundant.  But, Shirley's talent and charm shines through the tediously droll storylines and can still captivate even a young modern 4 or 5 year old who is a tap dancing hopeful.  My granddaughter and I sat and got to watch her together and at the end she was asking to see Curly Top over and over again.  Of the 3 movies in this package, Curly Top was her favorite!",1370217600,,477,4.277777777777778

2230342,5,B0007PIDCK,"One of my favorite little actresses.  This collection is such a joy.  When I was a little girl, Shirley Temple dolls were the most desirable.",1367193600,,141,4.6
2230343,5,B0007PIDCK,My Mom grew up with Shirley Temple movies and these movies brought her back so many good memories.  We both enjoyed watching the movies and chose to watch in B&W . . . just the way my Mom would have seen them in the movies.,1367193600,,223,3.9555555555555557
2230344,3,B0007PIDCK,"Heidi is the best of the three in this set but even if you've not watched it for years you can tell that scenes were cut. Toward the end we are watching Heidi and Grandfather in the police station in Frankfort waiting to be rescued by Herr Sesaman. Before he even shows up, we are suddenly transported to the grandfather's cabin in the Alps where a homecoming celebration is going on. Within about two minutes the movie ends. Very abrupt!
  The colorization in Heidi is beautiful but the other two aren't so great.
  Also, these movies may be a bit dated for today's yougsters. My five year old granddaughter liked the opening scene with the pony in Curly Top but about ten minutes into the movie she asked ""can we go play now?"" These films may be more fun for those of us who grew up watching them on TV.",1366934400,6,805,4.346666666666667
2230345,3,B0007PIDCK,"I've ordered movies from this collection before through another store and received charms inside. Each video was wrapped individually within the box. This collection only had the box wrapped. So, do these movies not come with charms?",1364947200,,233,5.324324324324325
2230346,5,B0007PIDCK,Another Great Shirley Temple set.  Shirley Temple is for all ages from 0 and up.  The movie is one taht will keep the younger audience and older audiences watching to the end.  It is like going into the world of a little girl and her adventures.

2230351,5,B0007PIDCK,I would recommend these movies for all ages. Shirley Temple is such a sweetheart in any of these movies that you have to fall in love with her no matter what. It seems like she is so proper no matter what the situation and you have to love that. Great family movies!!!,1361145600,,268,4.173076923076923

2230361,4,B0007PIDCK,"I like the black and white versions better but it's nice to have a choice.  I was a bit worried when I saw the quality of Curly Top but it may have more to do with the film's age and preservation than this boxed set.  Heidi was in excellent condition.  My three year old niece fell in love with this from the opening credits.  ""I want to watch Curly Temple again.""  From the mouths of babes.",1356048000,,391,4.092105263157895
2230362,2,B0007PIDCK,"I thought our little 3 year old ""princess"" would love the music, dancing and singing. But she focused in on the cruel way children were treated in these stories. Even our 6 and 8 year old grandsons were troubled by the harshness of some of the adults. The difficulties faced by children in these old movies may not be suitable for young children, causing worries and distress beyond their years. We threw away our set.",1336867200,3,418,4.586666666666667

2230366,1,B0007PIDCK,"This movie is nothing like the book. We read the book a few months ago for my daughters homeschool. The book was one of the best children stories ever. The movie lost all emotion felt from the book, left many people and things that happened out(The doctor,the grandmother. Clara doesn't even learn to walk on the Alm).Not the same story at all. My daughter was very dissapointed in this movie. If you have kids I reccomend the book but the movie doesn't even come close.",1330041600,,470,4.541176470588235

1937's HEIDI gave Temple the chance to shine in an elaborate screen version of the Johanna Spyri novel.  Little orphan Heidi (Shirley Temple) is taken to live with her gruff, reclusive Grandfather (Jean Hersholt) in the Alps; but just when Grandfather starts to enjoy having the enchanting moppet in his life, she's stolen away - yet again! - to become a companion for lame rich girl Clara (Marcia Mae Jones) in the city of Frankfurt.  Lonely and homesick, Heidi longs for the mountains of home, and it's up to Grandfather to make a daring rescue...

1935's CURLY TOP was a musical adaptation of Jean Webster's novel ""Daddy Long Legs"".  Winsome orphan Elizabeth (Temple) and her older sister Mary (Rochelle Hudson) are sponsored by a mysterious millionaire (John Boles).  Temple sings her signature ""Animal Crackers in My Soup"".

1938's LITTLE MISS BROADWAY features Shirley as spunky orphan Betsy Shea, who saves the day when the theatrical hotel run by her adopted family (Edward Ellis and Phyllis Brooks) is threatened with closure by a witchy landlady (Edna May Oliver).

While each person has his/her own opinion on which movie is the best or which movie is substandard, Shirley Temple fans should rejoice that they now have a chance to own all her movies in a remastered DVD format.

One of my favorite options is the ability to watch a movie of hers in original Black & White, or in a colorized format. In the 80's and 90's, VHS versions were either in color or black & white; and the colorized versions were usually not very clear.

2230417,4,B0007PIDCK,"SPOILER ALERT! THIS REVIEW MAY INCLUDE SPOILERS!

Curly Top  (1935)  They'd have to censor out her face as they did her appearance as a gilded Cupid, to avoid all risk of folks finding her adorable. Thanks a lot, Mrs. Grundy, wherever you may be!  This little star is a god to those who grew up during her three Number-One-Boxoffice years. Six-year-old Shirley is an orphan again in this one and sings the justly famous ""Animal Crackers"" song as well as the cutesey ""When I Grow Up"" (in a year or two or three), and does an inspired tap atop a grand piano. The vignettes of her posing costumed as the subjects of famous paintings, like Blue Boy, were only just okay, while her ""hula"" on the beach was child-like and amateurish. In this kid's portfolio, that's a big compliment.

Heidi  (1937)  Shirley is at her peak. This is before she got fat. She sparkles and dazzles and twinkles and dimples all through it. She was such a little professional and so alert to potential damage to her career, that she fought long and hard with Darryl F. Zanuck about the Netherland's ""Little Wooden Shoes"" number in a Swiss Alps movie. This film is an acting gig for her, not another song-and-dance trip, something she had longed for. Mama Temple worried that Marcia Mae Jones, as the crippled girl ""Klara"" might overshadow Shirley since she'd been in the business ten years and had 20 screen credits, but they worked well together and later were both cast in ""The Little Princess."" Good psychology in the script: Independent and self-sufficient Heidi, in efforts to win over the grouchy old Grandpa, continually asks him for uneeded assistance. No adversity is so terrible that it erases her smile for very many frames. Hard not to get a lump in your throat no matter how many times you've seen it and no matter how many versions there are, when ""Klara"" takes her first steps. Hard not to want a halo over Heidi's curlicued head!

Little Miss Broadway  (1938)  Must have been a real hair-puller whether to let Shirley's hem-lines down to hide her chubby, waffled thighs or keep them way up there to make her look younger. Anyway, that face and that talent mean that the baby-fat on her does not matter much. In her biography, she mentions more than once the studios keeping her skirts short, but writes of dieting only very casually, so I don't think this was a traumatic issue for her. Mrs. Temple was very protective but I have the feeling that she continually pushed and pushed and pushed, in her own sweet way. She probably told studio heads that she'd tolerate no comments on the kid's expanding girth. Everybody's little star, however, is very convincing in this role. And a buncha really talended ""orphans"" had names and lines and sang harmonious backup, but got no role-credits, thanks to Mom's protective instincts against any talented tot challenging darling daughter's box-office monopoly.  Playing Lil' Orphan Shirley once again, she lives in a show-biz boarding hotel whose principle owner  demands its demolition to make way for expensive new apartments. The minority stockholder in the form of the romantic male lead asks for an injunction against this and it's up to Shirley to convince hizzoner to look at the talent residing therein before deciding whether to tear down the venerable Variety Hotel. So a full-fledged Broadway musical transpires right in the courtroom and the sour-faced old judge, tapping his foot and bouncing about on the bench, rules in favor of Shirley and them. Off she goes into the sunset with her wanna-be adoptive parents who rescued her from the orphanage and who vow to get married one of these days. Side-show midget siblings George and Olive Brasno played Variety Hotel residents too and apparently were much smaller than Shirley, even at that age.",1198368000,,3783,4.820987654320987

2230428,5,B0007PIDCK,"I am so glad that they decided to bring Shirley Temple FINALLY to DVD- and this time the quality is amazing on the DVD considering how old the films are. Both versions are available to watch on the DVD- black and white or the new colorized version based on your own liking....

There is a wide range of Shirley from those adorable years when, Shirley was nothing more than a bundle of joy that sung and dance her way into America's heart to those tween years when Fox was trying to show her off as a real actress. Still there is not a BAD movie in this set.

In Curly Top you see all that remarkable charm as she performs that classic ""Animal Crackers In My Soup"" and does that sweet tap dance on the piano at the end to the title song. The movie plays out as Shirley is an orphan at orphanage- beloved by all there... well, when she catches the eye of an investor of the orphanage when he visits. He falls in love with Shirley and decides to adopt her. Only problem- her older sister will not allow the adoption to take place unless he adopts her as well. Well, he makes the decision to adopt them both-only secretly even making up a character ""Hireman Jones""- so that they both can come to expect the pleasures in life. Well, when he starts falling for Mary- Shirley's sister things get complicated. But, finally work their way out so that they can become one big happy family. ""Curly Top"" showcases off some amazing tap numbers and a ton of charm when Shirley was just a youngster starting out.

""Little Miss Broadway"" is full of song and dance- and has my personal favorite tap dance scene at the end to the title number. Filmed during those difficult tween years for Shirley. The movie is set in NYC Shirley is a recently adopted orphan who now, lives at a hotel full of under-appreciated actors. Well, their landlord is not thirlled with the colorful characters working at the hotel from a band, to a magician who has a pet penguin, to a miget dance trio... Well, the land lady who Shirley refers to as ""Ms. Pumpkin"" trys to close down the hotel and throw out all the actors on the street she is one for one HUGE legal battle which ends up with a ton of memorable song and dance numbers. One of Shirleys under=appreciated movies this one NOT to miss!

Heidi based upon the classic book is a movie that any non-Shirley Temple fan will enjoy. The acting is increadiable in this movie and Shirley shows off some real acting strengths the scene in which she is begging the police not to take her grandfather away always makes me want to cry.

This is a PERFECT gift for any little girl in your family. Sit down with your family and enjoy the magic of Shirley Temple.",1135728000,53,2668,4.370967741935484
2230429,4,B0007PIDCK,"I love Shirley Temple movies, and had VHS tapes of a few.  But when the tapes started degrading, I went in search of DVD editions.  I prefer the original black & white, and when Fox released a few DVDs a couple years ago (with both colour and black & white), I bought ""Heidi"".  The black & white quality was awful!  In fact, it looked like they'd just used the badly colourized version and removed the colour.  I was very disappointed.

So when I heard that these movies were being rereleased, I eagerly (but a little warily) ordered them.  The quality on these is amazing!  The black & white versions have been restored very well (which you can clearly see when you compare them with the included old black & white trailers for other Shirley Temple films).  Even the colourized versions are quite acceptable.  Whereas in the olden days (the 1980s) the colourizing process often left inexact coloured halos around people and objects, this new process is very precise.  I noticed individual hairs that were coloured, without any of that nasty halo.  The whites of people's eyes are actually white, too, not flesh-toned.

""Little Miss Broadway"" is one of my favourites, and I was thrilled with the quality of the film.  The older colourized versions were too bright (as if someone had turned up the brightness and contrast on them), almost obscuring facial features in places.  This new release is very much how I imagine the original must have been.  Clear, a little grainy, and perfectly charming.

I don't care much about the trailers, but what I would like to have seen (especially for this set) was the deleted scene from ""Little Miss Broadway"".  I believe it is available on a compilation DVD somewhere, but it would have been nice to see it included in the actual movie it was taken from.

I've already ordered the second 3-disc set for my collection.  These movies are great!",1133654400,28,1881,4.729230769230769
2230430,5,B0007PIDCK,"I wish the people complaining about the trailers would stop being so trivial and take the time to enjoy the films themselves.  Sheesh!  We ought to be grateful that Shirley Temple is now being appreciated by the studio and her films are appearing on DVD in small bunches, and even better, in RESTORED form!  ""Heidi"" which was previously reissued on DVD a couple of years ago, wasn't THAT bad on DVD, but now it's even better and improved, albeit in some scenes it's hard to tell the difference.

I've already commented before about how Shirley is a national treasure and it's a shame that it's taken this long for her films to be taken seriously and be released on DVD.  Hopefully, ALL of her films are eventually going to be restored for DVD.",1128038400,38,743,4.556390977443609
2230431,3,B0007PIDCK,"Why can't Fox release their classic films like Warner Bros do? The trailers for Heidi, Little Miss Broadway, Curly Top and Dimples are included, but are of extremely bad quality. One misses the audio commentaries, behind the scenes and special features. I'm hoping that Volume 2 will be better.

As for the colorizations .. I don't know, some scenes echo back to the tacky, false coloring of the 1980s versions. Heidi looks fantastic though, it seems to have had the most time and attention to detail. And it's great to have a copy of the black and white versions, the films as they were back in the day.",1127433600,10,604,4.592592592592593
2230432,3,B0007PIDCK,"Its great to have these titles on DVD now. All great classic films. The quality of the source material really isn't bad, but Fox never seems to go the extra mile with older classic film titles, giving us the extras that most people really love to have. The trailers are of very poor quality and as far as the colorized version is concerned, its of very average quality, when you compare it to other more recent black and white titles that have been converted to color (like the first season of bewitched, it really looks fantistic). But you can always enjoy the classic black and white version if your not happy with the color. But no matter its great to see Fox release these classics on DVD for young and old alike to enjoy.",1126915200,13,726,4.425373134328358
