Though Season 2 focused very heavily on introducing new inmates, this season did a great job with an in depth storyline, this is quality television, though it is sad it will only reach a limited audience because a lot of people are turned off by subtitles.",1407715200,,273,4.571428571428571
8614508,5,B00FDOZ1N4,"I have enjoyed all three seasons of this series immensely. The settings are exotic and interesting, and the characters are engaging---sympathetic good guys and suitably despicable villains. The storyline, though over the top, is delivered well enough that suspension of belief comes easily.",1395964800,,290,5.767441860465116
