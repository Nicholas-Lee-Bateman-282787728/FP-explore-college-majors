7607879,5,B01APY6PRC,"I first watched this movie as a child in the 1950s.  It is an excellent film that I enjoy watching each time i see it.  Later in my life, as I learned the very little my dad was willing to share about his experiences in the hedgerows of Germany, this movie framed why of the 67 men in my dad's company only nine returned.  Outstanding cast, well shot, a great ""day in the life"" portrayal.",1466985600,4,388,4.1466666666666665

7607882,5,B01APY6PRC,"So I bought this and viewed it a few days ago (April 25, '16). The quality is decent to good but the 'darker' scenes at the beginning are difficult relative to 'details'... sound is very good. Once the 'Sun' comes up, viewing details, so forth, is good to very good. Remmber this is an old print movie.
No special effects, lots of character development. The Italian campaign was a tough and unglamorous (no big build up, no historical 'wows') inch by inch walk up the boot. These soldiers talked about those 'home' things that one might ascribe to 'citizen soldiers' that made up most of our military in WWII. The expressed fears openly and also openly expressed support and camaraderie. One has to view it to see the excellent dialogue and personalities growing in front of you... as mentioned, there is not a lot of action initially. The capriciousness of war is demonstrated early by a wound and the fatalism of the 'grunt' is fleshed out in the aftermath. There are some technical issues like the 'wrong plane' (and I always thought that it might have been a 'friendly fire' incident but ME-109 is mentioned later so...) and the halftrack... but overall this film represents the 95% boredom, 5% sheer terror and resolution of the WWII combat infantryman. Well done for 'then', folks wanting modern day quality of film/viewing may be disappointed. The aficionado of 'good film' will appreciate the content and period. Great movie.",1461801600,6,1433,4.853061224489796
7607883,5,B01APY6PRC,"A Walk in the Sun, 1945 film

This film is adapted from the book by Harry Brown about the experiences of infantrymen. The US Armed Forces provided support for this film. Soldiers are on a landing barge preparing to invade Italy in 1943. The lieutenant looked over the top when a shell burst and wounded him. The sergeant is now in command. The conversations tell about each soldier. They are being sent six miles inland to capture a farmhouse. The men grumble and complain when waiting. The sun comes up and they are still waiting. They move into the trees to hide from enemy airplanes. The smoke and explosions signify the action in the background. An airplane strafes the woods and hits some of the men. The men chatter about things to avoid discussing their condition.

Sergeant Porter has a problem and cant go on. An enemy armored car comes down the road. They will use grenades to attack it when it returns. The bazookas are used for tanks. The grenades break the tread of the armored car and disable it. They continue walking towards that farmhouse. They assemble behind the stone wall. The machine gun in the farmhouse fires a burst. Windy says they should circle around by the wall and blow-up the bridge and ignore the farmhouse [the indirect approach]. They synchronize their attack on the farmhouse. They charge against the machine guns and take the farmhouse. It was so easy.

This bowdlerized version may be as realistic as Hollywood could be for a war movie. Very little happens until there is much action. [A walk in the sun was a phrase for an easy job.] The film follows the book, except the plane that strafes the woods looks like a P-51, not the ME-110 (or P-38?).",1459728000,,1684,4.625418060200669

8748013,4,B01APY6PRC,"My husband really enjoys this vintage movie as his interest is  high in WW I and II events.  DVD when arrived was unusable, no particular reason or fault,  but seller was wonderful in working with us and sending on a replacement  perfect replacement.  It is very gratifying to do business with such help and courtesy.  J. Lockland",1516665600,,330,4.701754385964913
8748014,3,B01APY6PRC,"I finally bought this DVD because I had heard how good it was. I had hoped I would love it but I thought it was just OK. First of all, there seemed to be about 27 main characters so that was a little tough to follow. Maybe if I watch it again, I'll know them all a little better. Secondly, it is definitely very talky which I thought I would love, but not so much. There really is no action until the end. Although, the assault on the farm house that you know is coming up does provide an air of suspense throughout and that whole part of the film is done very well. The dialogue is mostly on the sarcastic side. Maybe that makes this a very realistic war film. Maybe that is how soldiers talk to each other. But for me, I didn't overly enjoy the back and forth, constant ribbing each other. It got a little tiresome. Also, I didn't think the character development was as deep as I had hoped, as deep as it should have been with all the talking. For instance, Lloyd Bridges' character, what do we learn about him? Really, only that he's a farmer. He talks about apples all the time but doesn't even really like them. (Huh?) I liked Dana Andrews' character but again, didn't feel his character was all that developed. I didn't feel I really knew him. The movie does have subtitles which was nice because the sound wasn't great, but they always seemed to be slightly behind the actual spoken dialogue. Overall, as I said, it was just Ok for me. I recently purchased the Errol Flynn WWII collection and I have to say I enjoyed all of those 1940's films more than this one. Maybe I'm weird I don't know...Maybe I'll like it better with a second viewing?",1515715200,,1649,4.305466237942122

8748016,5,B01APY6PRC,"About 25 years ago, I wrote the jacket notes to the Lumivision laserdisc edition of A WALK IN THE SUN, which they'd acquired from a company called Medallion TV Enterprises. The movie, which had lapsed into the public domain early on, was available in dozens of cheap VHS editions at the time, but ours was the only one transferred off of a 35mm print, and it looked and sounded sensational when compared to the competition. Since then, the movie -- easily one of the two finest about American infantrymen in World War II (the other being The Story of G.I. Joe) -- had fallen into neglect again, with the transition from laserdisc to DVD. Sprocket Vault has now made up for that, with a superb transfer from an excellent source and also one bonus extra that's as valuable as the movie itself.

The picture looks and sounds fine -- it's not perfect, and there are places with some wear and other imperfections, but this release is head-and-shoulders above the competition for quality. And then there is the interview, over an hour long and conducted in 2009, when he was only in his early 90s, with actor/director Norman Lloyd (over 100 years old at this writing, in 2017). A familiar face and name from various Hitchcock productions, as well as movies such as DEAD POETS SOCIETY and television series such as ST. ELSEWHERE, Lloyd is a walking, talking piece of film, television, theater, and cultural history, and he ranges freely between this production and other projects, providing perspectives on directors, producers, actors, moguls, and any number of related subjects in what could, in other circumstances, be a great beginning to a graduate-level film history class. This feature justifies the purchase of the DVD, and also makes up for the shortcomings of its accompanying bonus feature, a rather hurried and sometimes awkward audio history of the other actors in the movie, which can be dispensed with in short order.

The disc is a must-own acquisition for fans of the movie, or of war movies in general, as well as movie history buffs.",1493596800,5,2045,4.84

8748020,5,B01APY6PRC,"I saw this film as a kid in the early 80s, and bout the DVD version in the mid 90s. It was a horrible ""fit to screen"" copy that had no restoration in sound, video quality and it was the only version available. I bought this restored version and I am very pleased.  This is as close to a real adaptation of the book, and a great look at how WWII was in both speech, slang and how a Squad really works.  One of my favorite movies of WWII era just after Band of Brothers.",1485043200,,468,3.9157894736842107
