8150722,5,B000JJ4EEA,"Ms. Evangelina Elizondo is wonderful portraying the obnoxious, hateful and prepotent rich woman who is forced to travel to Central America to oversee some business.
During this trip, she encounters the man of her life, only she doesn't know or doesn't want to know the fact, due to her impossibly big ego.
The man (Dagoberto Rodrguez) has tamed worse wildlife than that in the jungle, and makes her wish she had never come down there! So now she know how does it feel!
In this comedy, wa can also see Flor Silvestre with instant coffee as makeup to achieve the south american tanned look, while running in the grass in high heels, something I have seen twice in movies, later in EL LIBRO DE PIEDRA, where we can see Marga Lpez climbing the old church all the way up to the very roof in heels.",1316649600,,792,4.468965517241379
