7921475,4,B00004RSG3,"WWF In Your House, Rage In A Cage, took place on February 18, 1996 from the Louisville Gardens in Louisville, Kentucky.  The card featured five premium matches leading up to Wrestlemania 12 the next month.  Shawn Michaels had just won the Royal Rumble, and he was due to face the champion at the March extravaganza.  However, the King of Harts, Owen, challenged him in the first of two main events.  If Owen won, then he would replace Michaels at Wrestlemania, hopefully against his own brother Bret in a rematch from Wrestlemania 10.  Bret, the current WWF Champion, would face Diesel in a steel cage match.  Diesel cost the Undertaker the title at the Royal Rumble, and the Deadman would be quick (and unique) in his way of returning the favor to Big Daddy Cool.

Here are the results:
