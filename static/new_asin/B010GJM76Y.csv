7310882,5,B010GJM76Y,"(Minor Spoilers) ""...There's something special that goes on between women,"" and it's pretty special, indeed.  Even taking into consideration that Whoopi Goldberg won a Supporting Actress Oscar for ""Ghost"" (mostly for being lovably sassy, I feel), ""Boys on the Side"" contains Goldberg's, Drew Barrymore's, and Mary-Louise Parker's career-best performances, and it's actually Parker (TV's ""Weeds"") who seemingly takes the other seasoned actresses under her wings (boo to the Academy Awards for not nominating her, at least).  ""Robin"" (Parker) is on the rebound from a bad relationship and advertises that she needs a ride cross-country; ""Jane"" (Goldberg) answers the ad; and they meet Jane's friend ""Holly"" (Barrymore) on the way (a young Matthew McConaughey plays Holly's boyfriend as the story progresses).  A road-trip movie?  Well, maybe for the first third of the film, but it's oh so much more:  A meeting of hearts, minds, and souls, extraordinary relationships that transcend gender and sexuality, and, above all, a journey of love and understanding.  Every lifetime should be so lucky!  This one's a keeper and an extra special treat for fans of The Carpenters, Roy Orbison, Bonnie Raitt, and the Indigo Girls.  Directed by Herbert Ross (""Steel Magnolias"").  [Cameos:  Gedde Watanabe of ""Sixteen Candles"" as a moving guy and Niecy Nash of ""Reno 911"" as the concerned lady at the diner.]",1494201600,,1393,5.348623853211009
7310883,5,B010GJM76Y,"Had this for quite some time/surprised I'd never written an Amazon review.  These ""girls"" are in great shape & at the top of their acting abilities.  They all hit the nail on the head in their respectives roles.  Matthew McConaughey are the only one difficult to understand or even like, but he's male.  The music is all done by female singers & they rock hard!  Won't spoil any of the story for you, but gotta definitely say that men come & go...it's your girlfriends who are always there for you...",1490745600,,500,4.511111111111111
