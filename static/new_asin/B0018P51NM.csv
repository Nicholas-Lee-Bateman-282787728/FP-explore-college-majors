8270559,1,B0018P51NM,I hate this movie and I haven't even seen it. Purely based on the reviews found here on amazon I am going to say that this film must be a crime against decency and art itself. If it were not for the symbolism and hidden messages that are embedded in the cinematography this film would have warranted a total of zero stars. The quick edits of wild images that are essentially subliminal without hitting pause are remarkable from what I imagine. If you are into illuminati symbolism and ancient secret coding you will want to watch this very closely and with your finger on the pause button. If you are not into that sort of thing you should probably go to wiki and just start messing around with various searches like the golden dawn.. Kybalion etc. Then watch this movie. I have no plans to watch Broken Not Beaten. I'm too busy trying to figure out if I can detect Kevin Spacey's homosexuality in his House of Cards character. Nate Minier is a genius! Suck it Bonano!,1386460800,,968,4.47457627118644

8270561,1,B0018P51NM,"Further proof that this world is going to hell in a handbasket.  With the advent of digital video, any young punk can make an immoral, distasteful, and not to mention AMATEUR video with his no-good friends.  It used to be that filmmaking was only accessible to those worthy of producing the tried-and-true programming that any good christian could enjoy... like 'The Golden Girls', etc... now stores continue to be bombarded with rubbish such as this.  Consider this tape an assault on morality itself!",1240790400,,502,5.024096385542169
8270562,1,B0018P51NM,"I have to admit I had low expectations when I bought this video. I was surprised that it even worse than I expected. To complicate things, it's only available on VHS. I had to borrow a VCR from my next door neighbor to watch this video. It is clear that the filmmakers that made this had absolutely no idea what they were doing. I left the tape in the VCR when I returned it. Don't waste your time or money on this garbage!",1240704000,,423,4.108433734939759
8270563,1,B0018P51NM,"The movie was great- but the film I got in the case was a dv-r of Milo and Otis with the BNB injet printer label, mustve got mixed up with someones personal items.  Love that movie.  Never did end up seeing what i was supposed to, but i'm sure it's not nearly as good as M&O.",1240704000,,275,3.892857142857143
8270564,1,B0018P51NM,"Was a big fan of Nathan's other stuff... mostly his esoteric GLBT films that used to be popular in the 80s around the LA queer cinema scene.

When I heard about a new project he was working on, I was excited, looking for the same quality stuff he used to do, but for one reason or the other, Nathan sold out and decided to leech off the skateboard culture flux that's been hitting the past 10 years... hence the creation ""Broken not Beaten"".

Seriously, he should go back to what's he's best for... ""Chains of Pain"", ""Johnny Deep"", and the ""How to Love It Without Screaming""... he was great at creating vivid and memorable scenes for the queer cinema, things that I'll never forget... now he's just trying to make a quick buck filming a bunch of amateurs playing around on their skateboards... watch his other (better) stuff for a real taste of what Nathan offers.",1240704000,,864,4.532051282051282
8270565,1,B0018P51NM,"I am a conservative, born again, devoutly religious man, who purchased this film, due to the directors boasting of ""Good, clean, wholesome family values"", and I left my deity fearing, sweet and innocent children at home to watch it, while I went to work in my prudent, humble job.

When I returned, my children were slapping their mother, defacting on the walls, yodeling explatives, and sniffing markers, all of which are prominently featured in this fecal explosion of a film. Mr. Minier, there is a special realm of Hell waiting for sinners like you, and your film is a corruptive, indecent blight on the face of this country.

You should be ashamed.",1240617600,,653,4.821428571428571
8270566,1,B0018P51NM,This is the worst video ever.  Not only did I hate the content but the tape was actually greasy when I received it and I think I got some kind of rash from it.,1240617600,,159,3.676470588235294
