2413763,4,B000BCXZVS,"This is a good workout video.  The steps are a bit hard to follow at first, but after watching it about 3 times, you should get the hang of it.  The workout may seem low impact while you are actually doing the exercise but afterwards, you will feel that you've actually worked out the next day.  The instructors give good directions but sometimes it seems like they forget to tell you which foot you're on or which way you should move.  But again after watching it a couple of times, you'll get the hang of it.",1137456000,4,510,4.28125
2413764,5,B000BCXZVS,"It is usually pretty hard for me to stay motivated with a cardio workout.  However, I can do this DVD all the time. I consider myself an advanced beginner, and this DVD was perfect and I can see myself growing with and putting in more effort to make it even more challenging. It's not too hard but the choreography is intermediate level, so if you're not too coordinated you would have to stick with it a little bit longer to get it.  However, you will work up a sweat even as your fitness level increases.

 I have a dance background and she lost me for a few moves, but it was so fun that I just kept going until I got the hang of it.  None of the movements are really high impact and this is great if your knees sometimes bother you.  There is a lot of hip shaking, and you should feel free to just let loose and enjoy yourself.

The instructors are really upbeat without being too over the top and give great directions.  They do not break the moves up so slowly that your heartrate goes down. The only problem I have is that there are brief stops between the various dance sections that give tips about drinking water, eating right, etc. I continue to march during this section so that my exercise is not interrupted.

It is so much fun. The DVD is broken up into five ten minute sessions: dance jazz, tribal funk, dance party, latin, and dance funky. There is also a warmup and cooldown. Using a feature on the DVD called Choose Your Cardio you can select how many segments you want do- in any order you desire. This keeps you from getting bored! I highly recommend this workout.  :) Enjoy!",1137196800,29,1596,4.3076923076923075
2413765,4,B000BCXZVS,"This is another good workout from the people at Shape.  It's fun and motivating and actually enjoyable (where some aren't).  It starts with a 5 minute warm-up, 55 minutes doing floor work and then a 5 minute cool down (there is also a bonus standing floor workout - about 20 minutes).  The primary workout is dance-based aerobics - ten minutes each of jazz, dance party, Latin, funky and tribal. Then there is a pilates/yoga relaxing toning workout.  Both instructors are the same as the other workout dvd's and they do great cueing again.  With this dvd you can also do the workouts in any order - I find this helps prevent the bordom that comes from repetitive workouts of the same dvd.",1135468800,25,688,4.60655737704918
2413796,1,B000BCXZVS,"I bought this because I already own the bikini body camp DVD and it worked really well.  Granted, it took me a while to get all the moves down in that DVD, but after that I was on my way no problem.  Learning the moves to the cardio workouts is a huge undertaking.  I'm not a dancer, and I don't have a lot of time to do the same five minutes over and over until I get the moves right.  (Another annoying thing is that nowhere on the package does it mention that this is a dance inspired DVD.) The other problem is that, as a pretty fit person, what I have mastered isn't much of a challenge.  I felt like I was just walking around in my living room.  I could get a better (and cheaper) workout dancing to the radio.  Plus, what is up with the boring background?  I know it's not super important, but when I work out I like to escape from the mundane, not be transported from my endlessly more interesting livingroom to the house of some poor person with no decorating sense.  Blah.  The only saving factor is the long and lean workout, though I just ended up stealing a few good moves and adding it to my yoga workout so I don't really watch even that anymore.  I wish I had spent the money on something else.",1232668800,,1210,4.128205128205129
2413797,2,B000BCXZVS,I love the other Shape DVDs I have purchased but was not impressed with this one.  The moves are very 'dancy' and don't provide a really challanging workout.  Tracy was really hard to follow and the routines got old very fast.  They also have a couple of 'extra' people just following along who look kind of silly.,1211068800,,314,4.473684210526316
2413798,1,B000BCXZVS,"I bought this video hoping for a new fun workout, but unless you have a dance background you get lost following the fast paced moves.  The back of the box says 'easy to follow dance-based segments', nothing easy about it.  The instructors do not take their time to show the moves before jumping right into the combination of moves...a lot of foot action.  Don't waste your money on this DVD!  I'm going back to 'CRUNCH'.",1207612800,,420,4.56
2413799,2,B000BCXZVS,"Awful! Like other reviewers, you really need to watch this a few times before attempting to incorporate it into your workout routine. Unfortunately I didn't do that and was really frustrated. I made it through 1 segment before I gave up and tried a different workout video. I hate it when cardio moves are so complex that you can't follow along right away. The whole point is to motivate you to sweat off those calories. I just didn't find it easy to follow or motivating. I love some of the other Shape DVDs and I was really disappointed with this one.",1205366400,,553,4.485148514851486
2413800,2,B000BCXZVS,I love the Shape workouts but this one is a dud.  Really stupid workouts because they are too intricate to follow on the first time around but they don't get your heartrate up.  I was disappointed.,1203120000,,197,4.444444444444445
2413801,2,B000BCXZVS,"I purchased this program after retiring my previous cardio DVDs (""Denise Austin's Bootcamp"" and ""10 Minute Solution's Fat Blasting Dance Mix"", both of which are great workouts, by the way...however, a few months of intense usage is enough!).  I had also previously purchased Shape's ""Shape Your Abs"" workout, which contains a very good 35-min. cardio/toning interval workout.  Based on the fun and effectiveness of THAT DVD, I thought that this had to be good, despite the bad reviews, especially since it included a 17-minute yoga toning workout.  What a mistake!
I have to say that the IDEA was good: that of five 10-minute cardio workouts - with a seperate warmup and cooldown - that can be mixed and matched according to your mood and time.  Unfortunately, the quality of the workouts is what causes this DVD to falter.
All 5 workouts are dance-based, and are led interchangeably by Lisa Wheeler and Michelle Dozois (two of the most talented forces in the fitness industry today; Lisa is a top choreographer of at-home workouts and Michelle has appeared as lead instructor in quite a few titles).
Now, I love dance fitness.  I own many such DVDs.  However, these, though they will achieve their goal of burning calories, are lackluster, more than a little corny...and just not cool to have anyone see you doing! The music is also pretty bad. Many complain about the difficulty of the moves.  I did not find them any more difficult than any other dance-based workout. In my opinion, if any dance fitness DVD is worth doing, it SHOULD be challenging and should take a few tries until you've got it down enough to really let go and have fun with it. That's the challenge!
That being said, I believe that the DVD would have benefited tremendously by varying the type of cardio.  For example: one, maybe two dance-y workouts, one athletic drill, one cardio/sculpt interval, etc.  That way, they would not alienate people who enjoy or desire cardio, but hate to dance. (Or people like me, who enjoy cardio, enjoy dance, but think these dance moves are WHACK! :-) Doing that could have saved this DVD.
And then there is the background...I'm sorry, but I thought having a dull, ugly living room (with easy chairs!) was the most unimaginative thing...I like a LITTLE escapism, please.
The ""Long and Lean"" bonus yoga workout, however, is quite good, though a little lacking in the abs department (despite what is said, you're not going to get lean abs from that one exercise, done so briefly).
Well, again, the ""Shape Your Abs"" DVD is good, as is the ""Shape Bikini Body Camp Transforming"" workout.  So it's looking like one dud out of an otherwise solid series.
There are better cardio workouts out there.
Not recommended...unless you like corny dance moves.",1202428800,,2752,4.848614072494669
2413802,2,B000BCXZVS,"I bought this DVD and was really dissappointed. Unless you have seen the video once or twice through before performing the movements, you're screwed. The instructors leave no time for you to learn and catch up in time. I was extremely frustrated within a short period of time, and their ""get crazy!!"" phrases got very old, very fast. This is my first video purchased with Shape, and it may very well be my last.",1197849600,,411,4.5675675675675675
2413803,4,B000BCXZVS,The cardio workouts are fast paced and high energy and again are not for the average aerboics lover. Like the Shape Abs Fat Burn Workout the moves are very hard to follow and the instructors DO NOT TAKE ANY TIME to go through the moves. I loved the long and lean workout it has a move called the Goddess pose which worked my inner thighs like never before.,1196208000,,356,4.25
2413804,3,B000BCXZVS,"I was really frustrated the first time I tried this DVD, because I had a really hard time with the dance moves.  The back of the case calls it ""easy to follow,"" but it really isn't if you're inexperienced.  I've never been a dancer, and often Michelle Dozois and Lisa Wheeler will just name a dance step and go straigt into it without breaking it down.  Like others mentioned, Michelle does a much better job of explaining moves, though her routines are still fairly ambiguous.  Michelle was also more motivating for me; she seems to be having more fun than Lisa, who is a bit on the businesslike side.  Anyway, by the third or fourth time I did it, I was catching on!  At that point, I started having a lot of fun with the DVD. The moves are challenging but exciting for a novice dancer.  It was definitely an aerobic workout for me; I'm not an athlete but generally do some cardio (a DVD or fast paced walk) 3-4 days a week.  This one is for sure staying in my rotation, but I wouldn't recommend it to someone who doesn't want to learn the dance moves.",1175385600,,1054,4.314720812182741
2413805,2,B000BCXZVS,I am a 20-something woman who was looking for an intense cardio workout for someone who is out of shape but I completed all of the workouts on this DVD without breaking a sweat.  There is no way I  will sashay and kick-ball-change my way to a bikini body.  This video is useless unless you are really a beginner at workouts or you are a bit older.  I'm giving mine to my 60 year old mother.,1173312000,4,390,4.092105263157895
2413816,4,B000BCXZVS,"I purchased this video two weeks ago, came in the mail the begining of this week. I immidiately popped it in and tried it out. At first glance I was like are they crazy I cant do that. It seemed like an advanced dvd not so much for beginners, and trust me Im a beginner. (after giving birth to my twins I had an excess of about 50 lbs more than I had prior to being pregnant and its been a year since and haven't been able to get it off.)

To my suprise though, I thought ok I will try it. As a beginner it was an intense work out, i was sweating, and actually became fatigue quite easily, to be expected when your activity level is normally running around after your 1 yr old twins in their walkers as they are getting into everything.

I followed along, really studied each cardio one at a time.. Mastered the cardio ""Funky"" and then used that as the one I used to stay active and moved on to another to learn. That seemed to be the best way, I did all the work outs at once and I was just really confused.

But I have been using this for a week, 2 times a day and already have lost 6 lbs. Mind you eating habits have changed as well, contributing to the weight loss as well. ( the new slim fast weight control shakes 2 times a day and kelog cerial bars for snacks and lots of water in between.)

I recomend the video to those who really have the patience and don't get discouraged. Looking at it at first doesnt make you really say okay I can do this. But it is fun once you do get it!",1171497600,,1488,3.9832214765100673
2413817,3,B000BCXZVS,"Positives:

1.  Several workout options, able to put together your own routine in whatever order you choose.

2.  Upbeat instructors (w/o being annoying)

3.  Shape meal plan that came with mine has Yummy recipes!

Negatives:

1.  TERRIBLE MUSIC!!  I prefer upbeat tempo; the music on this DVD is barely audible and is....well...weird!  Sounds like something a kid could play on a keyboard.

2.  The routines within each section quickly become boring.  In my opinion each individual set is repeated too often.  =monotonous

3.  Too many steps to play a single workout session.  For example, first you must go to the main menu and choose the warm-up.  Then back to the main menu to select your routines, in the order you wish to do them.  Then back to the main menu to select the cool-down.  You are unable to select the warm up or cool down as a seamless piece of your workout.

4.  The DVD repeats a ""tip"" before/after each workout routine option...and it gets annoying to hear these tips EVERY time you do one of the sections.  It would have been nice instead for them to include such tips elsewhere.",1170720000,,1102,4.649214659685864
2413818,3,B000BCXZVS,"This video has 2 instructors Michelle Dozois and Lisa Wheeler (like most people I liked Michelle Dozois better.) There are 5 10-miniute cardio segments a 5 minute warm-up and a 5 minute cool-down there is also a bonus 18 minute Long and Lean workout which is like a pilates workout.

  Each 10 minute dance segment has a different type of dance. There's Jazz, Party, Funky, Tribal and Latin although they say each dance is different they are all basically the same.

  One 10 minute section is divided into 2 5 minute routines. You'll be lucky if one of these dances can get your heart rate up since most of them are kindof slow and you have to really put in extra energy to even break a sweat.

  Now what is good about this DVD well it's a good concept and once you manage to get and keep your heart rate up it is a good workout. The Long and Lean workout is pretty good too.",1156118400,,877,4.266666666666667
2413819,2,B000BCXZVS,"I really like the instructor Michelle Dozois. She teaches in the 10-minute solution series. That's mainly why I bought this dvd. I was dissapointed with it. The only routine I like is Dance Party. Other than that I think the routines are so-so. Maybe it's just me. I am more athletic and don't really like dance style to get fit. For fun, I think it's great. I don't really recommend this if you are trying to get a good cardio workout.",1152748800,,436,4.395061728395062
2413820,4,B000BCXZVS,"I thought that this video was very good.  Like most workout videos production seemed cheap but the moves and the instruction are very good.  I am not in the best shape ever, but not in horrible shape either and this video definitly got me sweating and breathing hard at times.  I would not recommend this to anyone as a ""dance"" video, it is aerobics based on some very simple dance moves.  If you are looking for more dancing, I would say try Carmen Electra's videos.  I would also say this is definitly for beginner/intermediate levels.  Overall good video, instructors not hard to follow and after two times I had caught all the moves.",1151280000,2,637,4.592920353982301
2413821,5,B000BCXZVS,"If you really want to lose weight and get fit, this is definetly the video for you! During the first 10-minute segment, I was already sweating, and I consider myself to be intermediate. I have done many aerobic/cardio DVDs, but this one is just super fun! Try it!",1148688000,3,263,4.5
2413822,3,B000BCXZVS,"It's hard to rate this product, because the workout is fun, with dance moves that are interesting - lots of hip shaking and attitude.  However, I just couldn't get my heart rate up enough to where I felt like I was getting a good workout.

If you want to get a bikini body, it's going to take more than this video.  There are more effective ways to burn calories and tone your body - even if you just jump on a treadmill on an incline.

If you just want a VERY LIGHT workout so that you can stay active for 50 minutes, than this video will work.",1144972800,,545,4.065420560747664
2413823,1,B000BCXZVS,"This video is, by far, the worst exercise video I have ever owned.  I regularly salsa dance and have taken dance classes since I was young, so the combinations aren't too difficult.  The instructors just aren't very good - especially Lisa  Wheeler!  She goes into a move without prompting the viewer.

Instead of doing this video a few times to learn the steps, I would rather get a good cardio workout.  I don't have time to memorize steps, and this tape isn't worth taking the time to learn.  My advice...don't buy it.",1144627200,2,520,4.586956521739131
2413824,4,B000BCXZVS,"I don't understand the poor reviews. I am not a dancer, but I don't think this video is hard to understand or do. The first time I was a little confused (although I think that's to be expected with any dance routine), but the second time I got the steps down. The workout is not tough, but if you do it all the way through, you are sufficiently tired and sweating by the end. Doing this video alone won't give you a ""bikini body,"" but it's fun for a change of pace to your usual routine.
I love how there are five 10-minute segments, so you can pick and choose according to how long you want to work out. There is a shuffle mode in which the DVD places the segments into a random order which helps lessen boredom. I don't think the women who lead the segments are bad in their cueing, according to other reviews--I didn't have a problem understanding them.
All in all, I think this is a good buy. I have a lot of taebo and yoga videos. Taebo is for my tough workouts, but I like this one for a fun workout.",1142640000,2,1006,4.111675126903553
2413825,4,B000BCXZVS,This is a fun workout that keeps you moving.  It has the ability to change the order of the workout so you have the possibility to never do the same workout.,1142380800,,157,4.064516129032258
2413836,4,B000BCXZVS,"This DVD offers a solid cardio workout, though I understand the frustration of many other viewers.  Michelle Dozois offers user-friendly instruction, where Lisa Wheeler tends to just perform a movement and expect the viewer the catch on.  The routines are learnable, so don't give up!  The pilates segment afterward is a great idea, but Lisa moves from one position to the next so quickly that I don't expect you get much benefit.  I'd award Michelle 5 stars, and and Lisa, 3.",1141689600,10,476,4.839506172839506
2413837,3,B000BCXZVS,"I am an advanced kickboxer who works out at home.  I bought this video because (a) I have already bought every kickboxing video on the market and (b) for some variety.  This is very earnest and sincere and prettily done and the leaders are well known trainers.  If you play it straight through and do all the dance routines, then do the short bonus pilates at the end, you will get a worthwhile one-hour intermediate workout.  If you have never done a dance workout before, DONT do this one first.  Go to Collage Video.com and get some beginning dance videos.  While the choregraphy is simple and easy to pick up, it does use some dance steps (mambos, grapevines, etc.) assuming you know them, and in order to get that heartrate up, they don't spend a lot of time at a slow pace.  So it's a good intermediate level workout.",1141516800,4,823,4.483221476510067
2413838,1,B000BCXZVS,"I used to teach an aerobics and weight training class and I've done many tapes as well.  This one is definitely not on the top of the list.  The format(mix and match segments) is a great idea, but it's too difficult to follow and unless you are familiar with dance steps this will be a tape that gets dumped on the back of the shelf.  Lisa Wheeler is probably a great dancer, but she's not easy to follow and most of the time she goes into a new step without demonstrating what she's going to do first or she goes through it too fast.  There are even parts where she does a new leg move, but the camera is busy filming either other participants or just not focusing on what you need to be watching and you miss the step completely.  The segments by Michelle are a little easier to follow and she explains what she's doing much better.

At the end of the first time through you are frustrated and feel like you just wasted the last hour.  If you are willing to spend a lot of time trying to get the steps down, maybe this video will work for you.  Most people who buy an exercise tape want to be able to jump right in-that won't happen with this tape.  I've tried two Shape videos and haven't had a positive experience with either of them.",1141084800,3,1238,4.189873417721519
2413839,1,B000BCXZVS,"This video does not match the description given.  The workout is broken into 5 segments.  Each segment claims to be a different style of workout, set to tribel, jazz and other types of music, but they are all basically the same. There is only one type of music on the video - synthetic aerobic crap. If you are looking to find an exercise video with decent background music...this is not it.

In addition,the women who lead the video appear stocky and have screechy voices.  The moves are confusing and poorly planned.",1141084800,,518,4.65934065934066
2413840,4,B000BCXZVS,"I got this video 2 weeks ago and have been using it pretty much everyday, and as far as the cardio aspect of it goes it is a good workout. But the dancing takes a little longer to learn then I would have liked. I still am not sure of how to do all of the moves, but I am learning a little more everday. So as long as you want to take sometime to learn the moves before you can actually consider it a workout, then this is a good video once you have it down pat, but otherwise I would go for a video that is a little easier as far as following the moves. Even though it is a bit confusing, the instructors keep your enthusasim up and keep you wanting to learn.",1140998400,,659,3.8529411764705883
2413841,3,B000BCXZVS,This is a confusing video and I'm in my 20's and fit. I really enjoy aerobics but this tape is very difficult to follow. Once I thought I'd have it they'd completely change it up again. Instead of simply building on the steps they keep changing them. It's a great idea but definitely not for me. I do like the bonus pilates part however.,1140912000,,337,4.28125

You have to know a quite a few names of the dance steps, and the minute you get the step down, they move on to a another combination. I had a very hard time following it.

I think this workout would be fine if you really enjoy dance style aerobics, but if you are looking for more straight forward aerobics, this isn't the workout for you. I think Shape had a good idea as far as the format, set, music, and overall production quality, I just wish this would have been a non-dance style aerobics workout.

I have no training in dance and found it a bit hard to follow but it is fun and infectious even as you are trying to figure it out.  My only problem with it is that it takes a lot of room.  My apartment isn't large and it is hard to find the space to do it in.,1138320000,3,312,3.414285714285714
2413845,4,B000BCXZVS,"Instructors Michelle Dozois and Lisa Wheeler lead you through this DVD of dance style aerobics designed to burn fat and lightly tone the lower body. The DVD itself is programmable, so you can do the five different dance routines in any order (jazz, dance party, Latin, funky, and tribal + a seperate warm up and cool down). Do them all if you've got an hour, or just do a 10 or 20 minute mix if you have less time. Either way, this DVD fights boredom to keep you motivated and on track. There is also an 18 min. bonus segment to gently stretch and tone your body with yoga & pilates to help maintain your ""bikini body"".

I found the guidance of both instructors to be fueled by high energy, infectious motivation, and clear demonstrations of the moves. The choreography is a little more complex than some, so it may be more tricky to pick up for beginners (i.e. chanees into a set of cross steps, ball changes followed by quick kicks...). I found Lisa's routines to be more ""dancey"". However, all the routines seem to be more dance aerobic than dance, so don't be intimidated if you've got two left feet.

I did the full DVD (minus the bonus segment), and by the end I had elevated my heart rate into an effective fat burning zone, worked up a sweat, and felt invigorated. I especially enjoyed this workout because it's longer than most, which can be a new challenge for beginners and a fun maintenance program for the more advanced.

This DVD is terrible, the exercise segments are not intense nor are there enough reps in any of them for significant results. The movements are not conventional either, you'll never catch yourself in a situation where you need to do lunges forward and backward while pausing in between to point your knee outward.

I have many fitness DVD's that I love but I am seriously considering dropping this one into the waste basket, like I did with all of the time that I spent doing these work outs.",1390003200,,543,4.530612244897959

8085154,3,B000BCXZVS,"I bought this to help get me back in shape - So I'm somewhat of a beginner level again, but I've run a marathon in the past and I was a college athlete, so I'm no stranger to working hard.  I guess I'm just tired of this chronic dance cardio theory, because these moves are too jarring on my achilles tendonitis without being strenuous enough to make me feel like I'm getting a difficult workout.  In other words - I think this aerobic-based dance cardio stuff just doesn't cut it for a good workout to make you sweat.  She tries to mix up the moves and it's fast-paced, but her attitude is a little annoying.  Amazingly, she doesn't have any dance rhythm even though you can tell she's a seasoned instructor and cues well.  I'm disappointed in this tape, I'm not going to use it very much.",1322438400,2,790,4.346938775510204
8085155,3,B000BCXZVS,"I received this video from a friend who loves it a lot. I flailed around like an idiot and mostly ran in place to keep my heart rate up. And believe it or not, I have a dance backround of 20 years or so of taking classes. There are two different instructors, one is very good and explains things well, the other just kind of does the routine and you have to just mirror her without any guidence. I do like how you can pick your workout order. But this is not my most favorite video ever. It gets used maybe once a month.",1289606400,,520,4.009615384615385
8085156,1,B000BCXZVS,"I've been working out at home w/ tapes/DVDs for almost 30 years, so I think by now I can grasp most choreography and routines relatively easily. Not with this one though. Not intuitive, lots of work to remember the steps with minimal rewards calorie-burning wise. Neither instructor was particularly engaging -- kind of frenetic. Weird, huge set that seemed neither a ""living room"" nor an outside environment. Basically, awkward, overly complicated, and left me feeling like I'd wasted an hour of valuable workout time. I really tried to like it ... it's in the Goodwill bag now.",1270684800,3,579,4.979381443298969
8085157,2,B000BCXZVS,"I picked this up for a couple bucks at TJ Maxx. That is always hit or miss because they either have DVDs that didn't sell well and went to close out, or good DVDs that are just older and not big sellers. I get my Tae Bo DVDs there and love them all, but when I find one it's always a shot in the dark since I can't read the reviews first. This shot, for me, was a miss. But it has its target audience so you may love it...I'll go over the positives and negatives for you to decide.

CALORIES BURNED:
I wear a bodybugg and display device in order to measure my daily caloric burn. I am also able to program it to show me exactly how many calories a specific workout burned, how many calories that workout burned per minute, and how much my calorie burn was raised after the workout (for example, with strength training which doesn't burn as many calories during the workout, but continues to burn them long afterwards.) I mention this only so you'll know what I say is based upon scientific measurement rather than perceived exertion.  This, in comparison to the rest of my fitness DVD library would be ranked as a ""gentle workout"". While it was fast based, its caloric burn was medium low.  While the exact amount of calories burned would vary per person based upon your height, weight, muscle density etc, this will still rank lower than most you'll find but that's not a bad thing if you want a more gentle workout--especially if you are recovering from a day of strength training the day before.

MUSIC:
Typical workout dvd music, lots of instrumental electronica but nicely planned to move to the beat of the dancer and fit with each routine.

WHAT YOU GET:
5 10-minute dance segments plus a warm up and cool-down and an 18 minute ""long and lean"" workout which is essentially yoga and pilates. The full running time is 80 minutes, which is a long workout for the low price.

KNOW GOING IN:
If you are great at choreography I think you'll love this DVD because it combines working out with dance. For me, it was frustrating. Now don't get me wrong, I workout exclusively to fitness DVDs, but usually they don't give you several steps and expect you to learn and memorize them in order, then give you some more then ask you to start from the beginning (with the other routine you just learned by memory) then add on the new steps, then teach you some more, and ask you to do them all in order from memory all together from the beginning...That isn't necessarily a bad thing. Lots of people might be able to pick up and memorize this routine. For people like me, however, I felt like I was in a bad dream where I was unexpectedly thrown on stage to replace a member of ""Dancing With the Stars"" but never allowed to see the routine I was doing beforehand. I tried. I rewound it. I worked hard at it. But choreography memorization just isn't my strong suit and I own it. My preferance is just to workout with good cueing and no step memorization to add on moves in order to create a compilation of a routine.

CUEING: This varied. Some parts were good, but many were confusing. And, with the routine being confusing to me as it was, it just felt frustrating to be honest.

LEVEL: As long as you can pick up the routine, you'll be able to do this regardless of muscle density or experience. So it's more about being good at the choreography than at any certain fitness level.

MUSCLES WORKED: This is geared primarily to your lower body. Although you will be doing arm movements, they are not enough or of the style to tone, nor are the moves geared towards high core toning.

SET: I have other Michelle Dozies DVDs and although basically every workout DVD has a similar kind of set for the most part, for some reason the company she must use for set staging makes me giggle a bit with their set. It always looks like they took a doctor's office and asked them to clear out part of the lobby in order to allow them to film a fitness video. I kid you not. It's amusing and nothing close to a gym...not that it should be a gym.  You'll see things like a bookshelf, a long thin table against the wall beside them with objects de' art like glass vases, ceramic bowls, and other things slightly dangerous for fitness but lovely for an office decoration, bookshelves, paintings on the wall, faux painted concrete floor, etc. I don't know why every video with hers is a different set but also an amusing yet sterile ""docs office"" but probably no one else but me notices anyway. I think they might be going for the look of a living room, but it doesn't make it.

TEAM: You'll get your primary instructor and a fit back up team to follow as well.

EQUIPMENT: None required but you'll likely want a yoga mat if you choose to do the Yoga/Pilates section. You will need a decent amount of space for all the Mambas, cha-chas, grapevines, etc. in the routines that move you in several directions both front and back as well as side-to-side. I have a workout room (it's just a cleared out bedroom  with nothing in it but my tv. some weights, a bosu, and an elliptical)  and I still used the entire room.

CONCLUSION: For those who pick up quickly when someone shows them a dance routine this would be good to mix things up a bit in your workout routine. If you were on the drill team or majored in dance, you'll have fun. I do not fall, unfortunately, into either of those categories so I was rather frustrated. The calorie burn is fairly low but it could work well on days you wish for a more gentle workout. Because there is no strength training and just cardio, it would be good for a recovery day when you have sore muscles from strength training and want something gentle...but only if you are more coordinated than me.",1264377600,5,5707,4.400379506641366
8085158,3,B000BCXZVS,"I think this workout is great for days when I want light cardio (every once in a while).  The workouts are cool because you can can pick the order.  There is a five minute warm up and cool down and then 5 ten minute workouts to pick from.  So you can pick the workouts and the order.  The workouts are fun, and I enjoyed doing them.  I am an intermediate/advanced exerciser and thought this DVD is light cardio.  I wouldn't do this often or depend on it for my workouts because it's too easy.  But for those days when I need a light day, this is good.",1262476800,,551,4.093457943925234
8085159,1,B000BCXZVS,I do not think that this product is any good in getting you toned up for the summer. It has all these dance moves that are really complicated and don't feel like they actually burn any calories. I didn't even sweat trying to do them.,1240185600,,233,4.2
