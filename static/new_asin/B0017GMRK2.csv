Well, I have to disagree with the reviewers quality. The picture quality is not aweful, but certainly not what it should be. The blacks are muddled and the whites are grey. There is no streaking or debris to speak of, however. The problem probably lies with the scan resolutuin or scan process in general. The elements used seem to be fine, just an underfunded transfer would be my guess...

I give five stars because Second Run should be applauded for even releasing this DVD. The film itself is a ten star caliber effort!

If you like Rublev, or just have a love of Eastern European cinema from the 1960's, then this is for you. Beautiful 2.35:1 Black & White, nothing better in the world.",1227484800,11,734,4.71875
8265771,5,B0017GMRK2,"This movie from 1967, set in the 12th century, is very hypnotic due to it's vivid images (mixing wide screen landscapes, extreme close ups and moving camera), different modes of narrative (text tableaus, voice, flashbacks, memories) and eerie middle age-like music (it's actually electronic music with voices created specifically for the movie).

In this movie there are no clear cut good vs evil and no typical villains and heroes (maybe for the exception of Marketa Lazarova herself who has some saint-like innocence). The people are more the products of the harsh social and religious environment of the dark ages. The plot is better experienced than talked about in advance. Haunting, complex and spell-binding, this is a very good movie, much better than the historic epics produced by hollywood every year.

The transfer is excellent (I watched it on a projector) with beautiful black/white (it's hard to think of this movie being made in colour).
This is the kind of movie that can be watched again. There is no commentary which would have been nice, but the booklet is informative. Second Run has made a fantastic job making this 40 year old movie look like new.",1219363200,26,1170,4.994871794871795
8265772,5,B0017GMRK2,"I saw this when it played at American Cinematheque in Hollywood.  Brilliant movie, at times brutally violent, the black and white imagery is amazing.  The 13th century seems like a tough time for human folk.  I can see why it's compared to Tarkovsky ""Andrei Rublev"", but the story is tighter and more localized. Wish it was available on NTSC format. ""The Valley of the Bees"" is also very good.",1215820800,15,393,4.666666666666667
