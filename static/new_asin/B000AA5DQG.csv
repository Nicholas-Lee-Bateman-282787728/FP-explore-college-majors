Timothy Bottoms did an incredible job bringing Coach John Baker back to life, from the days of his athletic victories to the agony of a cancer that had long ago spread.  ""A Shining Season"" also showcased New Mexico's scenic beauty.

It isn't a so called ""feel good"" movie.  It doesn't make me feel good to know the people who contribute their time & talents to help others, as did John Willard Baker, live short lives.

But performances by Bottoms as well as supporting performances by Ed Begley and Rip Torn, among others, make this film a most worthwhile investment of time.",1487548800,,702,4.584
8076802,5,B000AA5DQG,"Yes, Please. We need this film released on DVD. It is a great film about a truly brave and inspiring man. The book is an excellent read. I would highly recommend both, but $159 is highway robbery. Please, release this film on dvd for the masses.",1421366400,2,245,4.3478260869565215
8076803,5,B000AA5DQG,"Timothy Bottoms is one of our most underrated actors. He started out with a bang with Last Picture Show, Johnny Got His Gun, Paper Chase, and in recent years ended up playing George Bush in That's My Bush etc. It's a shame that he can't get the respect and roles his Last Picture show co-star Jeff Bridges gets. A Shining Season is an example of what a fine actor he is. And it is an important, inspirational movie that is excellent viewing for the - hate to talk like this - whole family. Please put it on DVD!",1316908800,7,511,4.224489795918367
8076804,5,B000AA5DQG,"This movie made the sport of track and field interesting, and did a great job of showing what drives runners to run.  It was also a moving tale of a young man at the height of his potential, struck down by cancer.  It is a well done film and a tear-jerker.",1168905600,,256,4.0
8076805,5,B000AA5DQG,"This made for TV movie originally came out in 1978 or 1979.  I was 13 when I read the book in my public library and I was inspired by it.

It deals with the story of an olympic miler (John Baker) who was a true champion not only as an athlate but also as a teacher, coach, and mentor.

The original idea idea for the book came out of a Reader's Digest article written in the mid-1970's called ""John Baker's Last Race"".  The article was very popular and many people asked for reprints of it.

The nice thing about this book and the movie is that they capture the true spirit of generosity and quiet heroism of ""ordinary"" Americans like this man.

In a fitting tribute, the school where Baker taught was re-named in his honor.

Both the book and the movie inspired and motivated me through some tough times.  I hope others will read it or watch the movie.",1150761600,7,853,4.2875
8076806,5,B000AA5DQG,"This movie was made around 1970.  I saw it years ago on network tv & never could forget it.  Years later I wanted to buy it, but I couldn't remember the title, but happened to be channelsurfing one day & realized this was it. It is about John Baker, track star, who no doubt would have gone to the Olympics, but was diagnosed with cancer.  He died at the age of 26.  That is only the surface of the movie.  He was a phys. ed. teacher at an elementary school & worked with the most troubled & difficult children to make them feel self worth & make something of themselves.  He was a teacher in the true sense of the word.  I enjoyed the movie so much, I bought the book of the same name which is excellent also.",1124409600,6,710,4.0647482014388485
