1071417,1,6305772800,"""The Living Sea"", is more a documentary on HOW TO (or NOT) to make a film than it is of the LIVING SEA.  About 10 of the 77 minutes is worthy of the IMAX 70 mm film and chosen title. The remainder of the footage is about Coast Guard rescue drill, Surfers surfing, ROV (remote operated vehicle), Stunning pictures of the ROV's MONITOR depicting a Siphonophore, sailing ships and boats (accelerated), Monterey Bay sea otters, time laps of OceanTide, speed boat driven through islands of Palau, history of one family on Palau, interior and exterior of an aircraft, aerial shots of Monterey Bay, Hawaii, Alaska, Palau, The red waters of red bacteria, the TOTAL BLACK of the toxic anaerobic layer of the ocean, interviews of and commentaries by the producer, director, and other film makers. All this could just as well have been filmed with a HOME Video Camcorder.  However for about 10 minutes I was stunned by the extraordinary footage of Humpback Whales, Cuttlefish, School of Jelly fish, Kelp fields, and reef fish, very fast schools of fish, a few Clams and Corals. The few minutes of narration by Meryl Streep and SIX other nameless people are annoying to say the least.  No MENU selection to turn it/them OFF.  The music by STING was very well chosen, but would fade into the background and is over shadowed by narration.",975628800,31,1324,4.743478260869566
1071418,5,6305772800,"I've only ever seen 3 IMAX films and this is one of them. I was totally blown away by the incredible sound and photography. I had to study every  shot because there is so much in it.
It's not actually a movie like other  IMAX films (such as Across the Sea of Time and T-Rex) but more of a  documentary about how we are all islanders and how we live because the sea  lives. It was surprisingly effective in this sense. My fave part was the  discovery of the new underwater fish and the fish that had, what looked  like, thousands of little lights flashing on and off.
A scene with a boat  fighting waves and crashing back down onto the sea was better than anything  in The Perfect Storm. The sound in this particular scene is  IN-CRED-IBLE.
Whenever you pass by an IMAX check to see whether or not  they are showing this masterpiece. You'll love it.
The DVD is in  DTS/Dolby 5.1 and is in fullscreen",965347200,53,898,4.285714285714286

If you're fortunate enough, watch this on widescreen TV &  crank up the surround sound system & enjoy.  And thank you DVD  producers for making this with DTS.
Most enjoyable moments (no  order):
*  Everything on Palau
*  Migrating jelly fish (also in  Palau)
*  Watching a cuttlefish change color to camouflage itself  while moving
*  Coast guard boat going through horrendous ocean  waves.
Highly recommended!",965174400,13,497,5.0625

This is what you could call versatile entertainment: beautiful images of the life below the surface, completed with a gentle soundtrack. I found Meryl Streep's  narration a little boring, maybe they should have chosen a different voice  for this. The disc quality is superb, although you probably should have a  widescreen television to enjoy the most of it, because the main title is  filmed in Imax. As a result of that, the image has a fish eye effect on a  standard tube. If you have a widescreen tube and are able to blow up the  image to widescreen format, you might enjoy it better. Apart from the  sometimes spectacular main thing there's a lot of extra material on the  disc, which is accessible via a nice designed menu. Be sure to check out  all of the little icons here, there's a lot not to be missed! A lot of  'making of' items can be found here, worth a while.

After that I wish I have a chance to see  this IMAX, but where I live, the IMAX Theatre was built 3 years later. At  first, I didn't care about this DVD when it's on sale, however, I noticed  that it features DTS surround sound.

1071590,5,6305772800,"Last night's bargain-rack movie was ""The Living Sea,"" a film originally created for showing in IMAX theaters. This version was set in ""large format"" suitable for viewing on widescreen television sets. The film production is excellent, as is the sound, but if you ever get the chance view it in an IMAX Theater, of course. The movie is shot at a wide variety of places all over the world using the special and bulky IMAX camera. The photography in this film, especially the underwater photography, is just incredible. The kelp forests and coral reefs, among other things, are indescribably beautiful. You just have to see it. I'm a geology professor and I have watched a lot of underwater films, but I've never seen anything else that would come close to this. If I had a gripe (very minor), I regret that more footage wasn't devoted to the underwater photography and less was devoted to the surface human activities such as surfing and boating, but I can see their reasons for doing it and my complaining isn't very vocal.

One of the cameramen is a specialist in surfing photography, and he's quite exceptionally good. I would be inclined to give him the chance to produce an IMAX surfing film and I'm sure it would be second to none. I just didn't particularly like the mixture of scientific and recreational subjects. And speaking of mixing subjects, the film has a somewhat preachy attitude about saving the sea. Well, I suppose that's necessary too. Actually, there's just too much subject material to cover and the movie seems much too short.

If you watch the film, you will also want to watch ""The Making of The Living Sea,"" the explanation that follows and that is actually longer than the film. Personally, I found it to be just as interesting as the film and it's another chance to see more of that marvelous underwater photography and how they shoot it.

The general message of this film is: ""The sea is important and we have to protect it.""  No duh.  In service of this message, the filmmakers breeze through a number of interesting subjects, each of which would make a captivating film by themselves, that have no relationship to each other beyond their mutual connection to the sea.

Show me a film about the Coast Guard's rescue teams.  Show me a film about the discovery of deep sea creatures such as the massive cyphonophon.  Show me a film about the unique eco-system of the isolated ocean lakes of the Palau Islands and the natives who tend the reefs there.

You expect it to document some battles between a Fringehead fish, or Hammerhead sharks, or anything, but basically all that is astounding about the sea in this movie is the swarm of jellyfish, which adds in another star out of two.

It documents the sea and its creatures, and also how people connect with it, either for pleasure, commerce, or survival. We get to see the Coast Guard boat traveling through 15 foot waves, some outstanding surfing footage, and how the inhabitants of the West Pacific island of Palau interact and respect the water that surrounds them.
One one level one can use this film to learn some facts about the ocean, and on another, one can sit back and enjoy the wonderful cinematography. Fascinating parts include the jellyfish in Palau, the Monterrey Bay Aquarium Research Institute showing us a Siphonophore, which is about half the size of a football field, and visible through their underwater probe, and of course, the whales !
The film is 40 minutes long, and the video contains a 27 minute ""Making of"" documentary, which has interviews with Producer/Director Greg MacGillivray, among others, like photographer Howard Hall describing the difficulty of filming in water.

That 2 minutes you see was 40 hours in the surf of pounding the crap out of everyone, director included. Just a great movie all the way around.",1023926400,8,491,4.23404255319149
1071793,4,6305772800,"The only reason, I didn't give this 5 stars was 40 minutes was not enough.  I was just getting relaxed, enjoying the breath taking cinematography of Nature's incredible glory.  I loved the underwater diving, the contrasts between Hawaii  Oregan and California. I highly recommend getting this wonderful DVD experience.  I would also recommend ""Dolphins - IMAX""  for another 40 minutes of bliss or for a longer, more relaxing natural getaway, either ""California or Hawaiian Dreams: WAVES Virtual Vacations.""",1022284800,,506,5.435897435897436
1071794,5,6305772800,"I've been watching DVD at home for three years and after watching this one immediately concluded that this was the best audio/visual experience I've had so far from any movie of any genre.  In terms of content, sometimes I wish there was a little more science incorporated into this production, but a vital element in science is observation and this movie certainly allows the viewer to do just that.  Overall the sound is big and rich, and the music tracks are a perfect match to this incredibly beautiful visual experience.  If you are an IMAX fan and don't have this one yet, don't wait any longer.",1009670400,13,601,4.650943396226415
1071795,4,6305772800,The living sea is a enjoyable journey to the undersea.  The sound of the waves coming through the surround sound is awesome and the graphics is very good. However I was looking for some closeup shots of the undersea world. The movie was short but to the point.  With a good stereo system and DVD you will enjoy this one.,1008201600,,320,4.316666666666666

The soundtrack from Sting is one of the best anywhere, great for kids and adults, its really exciting, my favorite of the IMAX series.

1071797,5,6305772800,"I first saw The Living Sea at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago in an IMAX Theatre environment, which was pretty incredible given the surround sound of crashing waves.  This DVD is a best buy.  Unlike  movies, which can get predictable after multiple viewings, The Living Sea is an educational and visual wonder you can watch over and over.  The film director was a California surfer as a young boy and he grew up to make an inspiring and beautiful film.",995673600,6,466,4.578313253012048

When I saw the ""Blue Planet"" DVD, I had hoped all IMAX transfers would be as clean and beautiful, but this one wasn't as well done.  The sound is wonderful, however, so if you don't have a larger screen TV but have a great surround system, I'm sure you'll enjoy it.",995241600,5,461,4.609756097560975

1071800,4,6305772800,"One of the biggest reasons that I began purchasing DVD's was to get the IMAX titles.  As always, the beautiful cinematography combined with an outstanding soundtrack and commentary, makes this a gread DVD.  Anyone with a fascination for biology, or science in general, will definitely love this one.

1071801,5,6305772800,"I haven't actually seen the DVD. I saw this in a local cinema numerous times I love this documentry, all be it that it is a bit Over 'American'
But the reason that prompted me to write was the comment earlier about  'only true sting fans will fully appreciate the sound track'
I actually disliked stings music but think the music compliments the movie wonderfully so much so that every time i hear a track used, a shiver goes up my spine and i appreciate once more some of the wonderfull footage.
I don't know if this will work as well on a DVD as an IMax screen but it certainly will be entertaining and informative",986428800,5,616,4.310344827586207
1071802,4,6305772800,"If the ocean and all of its moods fascinate you, then watch this movie.  It really is that simple.  The music of artist such as Sting gains its greatest impact with visuals like these.
Perhaps some of the scenes are not the most exciting and the science may be lacking but, IMAX was not envisioned to take the place of the Discovery Channel or a good book.  The beauty of the IMAX format and those who choose to work with it is the awesome clarity and richness of picture it delivers.  More than any other feature shot for this medium, The Living Sea delivers on both counts.
Maybe this movie is just a well shot travel video with background music by a living music legend but, then again, without an unlimited travel budget and a personal friendship with Sting how could you ever see such a breath taking and consuming experience?  Turn off the phone, set aside an hour, and go on a multi-continent diving experience that statisfies the eye, the ear, and the mind.",977270400,13,965,4.491428571428571
