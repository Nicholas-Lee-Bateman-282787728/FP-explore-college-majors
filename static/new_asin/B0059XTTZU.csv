4623030,5,B0059XTTZU,"One of the most romantic gay films I have ever seen. The reviewer before me must be even more cynical than I am to have totally missed out on the chemistry that these two have. They are not your typical gay characters, in fact it just so happens they are gay. No ""after school special"" or ""Lifetime"" feel here. No tragic illness or event. Just good conversation and attraction.

The end practically left me in tears. The relationship that builds between the two is a joy to watch.

I am not easily entertained and especially critical of film. I usually prefer more cerebral fare like David Lynch or Woody Allen. But once in a great while a film comes along that surprises you and touches your heart (and not by manipulation ala New Years Day, etc.). Sit back and watch these two very different people in a realistic portrayal of discovering each other and themselves.",1330819200,54,867,4.587096774193548
4623031,2,B0059XTTZU,"I went to this movie having read all the blurb. A simple story of two gay guys ""looking for lurve"" in all the wrong places over the course of two days.
Much was made by the director of the fact he'd cast a ""straight"" actor in the part of one of the gay blokes. Big deal! As if gay actors haven't been playing straights in Hollywood for decades!
So what do you get?
For a start it's damn bleak. This is no Woody Allen sunshine-tinted evocation such as we saw in ""Midnight in Paris"". I'm reliably told that it's set in Nottingham, but wherever it is, it's at its most grottiest, where the denizens only emerge blinking into the daylight when one bar closes and the drug deal is done or sex partner for the next hour or so has been found.
And then it's home to the depressing council housing for some not so furtive couplings, to the sounds of the argument happening next door.
I was surprised the two protagonists could even accomplish such acts after the incredible load of drugs they consumed at all stages throughout what purports to be only two days....they simply never stop smoking dope or ingesting some illicit substance for the entire time they spend together. Even a visit to one of their family dinners sees yet more drug taking.
The two leads are played by fashionably bearded young blokes, ......the only one evoking any sympathetic reaction at all being the ""sensitive"" pool life-guard.(Yes, he's the ""straight"" actor!) The other bloke is so vapid and drug-induced ""edgy"" that it's impossible to believe anyone would even choose him as momentary bed-material let alone fall in love with him.
He's got ""driftwood"" tattooed on his damn forehead!

The film itself has shot-on-the-cheap written all over it as well, ...which would not be such an indictment if it actually had something to say.
This fatal flaw is not helped by the heavy accents of all the actors, who constantly mumble, so often facing completely away from camera so lip reading is not even an option. No one can massacre the English language quite so effectively as the English themselves.
The sound quality itself is absolutely appalling, ....it being SO poorly recorded that whole sections of dialogue, which I'm sure were central to the minimalist plot, were totally indecipherable to me, ...or any other of the audience members I quizzed.

The sex, ....ah yes, the ""sex"". I knew we'd have to come round to that!
Well if you were upset by the chaste and very brief male/male kiss in Downton Abbey Series One, then yes, you will be driven into outraged religious fervour here at the shameful homosexual couplings of two men. But if you are of more sensible tone, then you will see little that you don't see in hetero movies, with only the gender of the participants being any different. There is a brief glimpse of some ....er,....""left-overs"" on the stomach of one of the lads, but that's all.
It's a little more realistic than ""Brokeback Mountain"", ...but hardly anything to call down hellfire and damnation about. Some naked flesh, jerking wrists and lots of heavy breathing about sums it up.
In the course of the movie itself nothing all that much happens really, apart from a few long drug-fueled philosophical conversations, in the whole of which I think only one relevant point was made.
And that was just preaching to the converted, as the audience I saw it with were not the ones that point needed to be aimed at!

There is very little plot, no resolution, no happy ending, (well in the narrative sense that is!!!!); ...and no feel-good bits if that was what you were expecting or even hoping for.
Just bleak, bleak, ...and more bleak! With occasional bouts of boredom interspersed.
Even the final kiss on the station as Mr. Shallow departs for good leaves the audience to ponder why a bloke who is probably quite a nice guy is falling for such a flit-about loser.
An ultimate disappointment really, ......if that was the ""Weekend"" then going back to work Monday morning would have to be a refreshing change to look forward to....",1330560000,13,4017,4.719373219373219
4623032,5,B0059XTTZU,"`Weekend' is basically running dialog between two gay men on the cusp of a serious relationship.  They meet at a club, they spend the night together and they wake up to a connection they didn't expect and a weekend that will prove to be their last together that builds in each of them the hope of a different tomorrow.

I want to first address the idea that this is a `Gay Movie'.  I've been one to always search for a universal tone to films because I feel that most films (at least the important ones) can reach a wider audience if one is willing to open their minds to what they are seeing and find their own sense of poignancy inside the film's themes.  For instance, I have refused to consider `Brokeback Mountain' a `Gay Film' because, to me, it is more a film about forbidden love and really just as poignant and universally understood as `Romeo + Juliet'.  For me though, `Weekend' is undoubtedly a `Gay Movie'.  It really strikes a chord within that particular community and becomes a poster child for gay relationships that, while I can see and should see a transference to the straight world and more or less the idea of relationships as a whole, the film's primary focus is the stigmas and the controversial ideals surrounding gay romance.  I actually think that it is important to understand that this movie is about gay romance because it is that aspect of the film and its construction that make it so moving.

It makes you think.

Oh, and I just want to say that Tom Cullen's beautifully pure portrayal of Russell is one of the acting highlights of the year; easily.

The film opens with Russell getting ready for a night out.  He goes to visit his best friend and his wife and their friends and he seems content, yet a little withdrawn and somewhat unhappy.  He leaves and heads over to a gay club where he spies out a few potential dates and winds up fondling Glen and taking him home.  The next morning Glen practically pushes a tape recorder in Russell's face and asks him what he remembers about their night together.  Despite his apparent uncomfortable feelings, Russell seems intrigued by Glen, to the point where he texts him later and they wind up hooking up.  From that point forward they cultivate the beginnings of love by talking and talking and talking some more; sharing secrets and feelings and concerns and ultimately baring their souls in ways that they aren't used to nor have ever been comfortable with.  It is within those conversations that `Weekend' becomes so important.  Whether they are sharing intimate details about their sexual partners (Russell's reading of a journal entry regarding a married man was particularly emotional and unnerving) or confessing personal feelings with regard to their sexuality (the way that Russell openly admits wishing he were straight at times was particularly brave and certainly says a lot about the soul of this film) or just sifting through dialog in a way to make conversation; Glen and Russell are becoming real people in a real world in a real situation.

As `Weekend' draws to a close it begins to wind down in a similar way to its beginning, which is where I wished it would have ended.  With those bookends it would have made a big statement about the slow progression of change, but instead it shook up that moment by adding a predictable twist (that `Notting Hill' moment).  I would have liked the last five minutes to have been bypassed, but I understand why they were there and they really don't take anything away from this tremendous film.

Whether you are straight or gay, `Weekend' will touch you because it is honest.  Honesty is something that is often overlooked in cinema, so when it comes along it is important to grab hold of it and truly appreciate all that it is saying to you.  `Weekend' says so much with seemingly so little.",1326931200,3,3828,4.655274888558693
4623033,4,B0059XTTZU,"A nifty little movie about getting to know the guy you spent the night with.

A fine, naturalistic film with universal insight into relationships.",1326240000,,146,5.083333333333333
4623034,5,B0059XTTZU,"I think the previous two reviews of ""weekend"" were pretty spot-on. I have never previously heard of this film or primary actors. But it and they are fantastic. Imagine a movie with intelligent dialogue & superb writing & acting and you will savor this. Some one mentioned best since ""Brokeback Mountain""--well I would reserve that slot for...probably""A Single Man"" but this would be a close second. It is currently available streaming on Netflix. Enjoy!",1325376000,2,453,5.135135135135135
4623035,5,B0059XTTZU,"Russell is a somewhat shy gay young man who is not ""out"" to most friends or family.  He spends a lot of time with his straight friends there in Nottingham UK, except on the nights that he sneaks away to an out-of-the-way gay bar, looking for the physical connection he thinks he needs, although he really is looking for far more..

It is one such Friday night that he meets Glen, a joyfully ""out"" extrovert who first rebuffs Russell's attempts to get acquainted, but later goes home with him. What follows is an intense weekend that changes both of their lives, with each finding in the other the qualities and emotional support missing in their own lives.  It's a very positive film about finding the ""yin"" to your ""yang,"" of developing self-respect and a commitment to live your life the best way possible, as well as acknowledging the people that help you along that journey.

The film debuted at the SouthBySouthwest Festival in March 2011, and has since received numerous awards and positive feedback at gay and mainstream indie film festivals.  Previous reviews have complained about mumbled dialogue but, although I often have a problem with British accents, I did not experience that with this film. One review raved it was the ""best gay film since 'Brokeback Mountain""; I wouldn't go that far, but it was probably better than most that have followed.  For a low budget indie film, the acting and quality were quite good, although I could have done without the ""artsy"" shooting of characters reflected in windows, mirrors and walls, or of narrow shots between shoulders or heads of other people in the scene.  Overall, I think it handled a valuable subject realistically and tastefully, and give it a full five stars out of five.

As of this writing, ""Weekend"" has finished a run at selected theatres and film festivals, and is available on some cable systems pay-per-view or as streaming video.  I heard rumors of a March 2012 DVD date, but that is not confirmed. Worth waiting for.",1325203200,10,1991,4.798245614035087
4623116,5,B0059XTTZU,"I must say, one of the best films i have seen in a long time, not just a ""gay"" film, a film.. the acting, the music, the cinematography, the color scheme, everything, directing...just an awesome film.  A lot of these raw and very well acted scenes, i have experienced, with the exception of the drugs.  I could wholeheartedly relate to Russ, omg.  The scene on the couch, when they got into a heated debate about being gay, coming out or not, being in love, i have lived a moment like this.  It is true, not all of us gays want to the whole world to know  we are gay....For some its easier than others to expose themselves.

Yes, it moves slowly, but the acting was spot on throughout and I was rather amazed at how quickly I became invested in the story of these two men.  Everything about this story seemed real and genuine, none of it seemed false or contrived.  Event wise, not that much really happens during the course of their weekend, and yet, by the time it's over, they've become different people.

4623201,5,B0059XTTZU,"I LOVE this movie.  I've seen a lot of same sex movies and a lot are poor and focus on men without their shirts on and perfect bodies, this is so much more realist and relatable.  It's not a huge, expensive set such as Brokeback mountain and I found the intimacy and non-Hollywood structure so much better.  It's a long weekend and two youthful ""kids"" (I'm 45) meet and have a romantic weekend.  It's a down to earth, realistic drama/unconventional romance (or maybe conventional and not the Hollywood fakeness).  There's more than just a weekend romance, there's talk about life, coming out story, activism, closetness (word I just created!).  There's a lot of bars, alcohol and some drugs, not in a tragic way just a realistic way for a lot of young same sex men coming out and the difficulties of it.  I know a lot of people that turn to alcohol when first coming out as the historic place to meet friends and partners were bars, now it's a little different as people are coming out much earlier than me when I was 21.  Plus there are apps and the internet dating and other sites that people can meet.  This movie doesn't encompass that, it's more like it was in 2011 and before.

I've seen it twice and I rarely see movies once let alone twice.  It's more Indie and that's my speed.  I loved it (if you can't tell!).",1469577600,,1320,4.431535269709544

4623488,5,B0059XTTZU,This is one of the best gay films I've seen. I think Tom cullen is gorgeous and his character truly makes someone that's a hopeless romantic fall in love with his character. The movie made me think of every day issues such as how society can think of gays and public displays of affection and the idea that straights need to get use to me kissing my partner holding hands or being myself in general in public. I love the movie and a key point I got out of it are ones come and go in my life friends and previous relationships and that they come for a reason. Whether they stay or leave. To glean what I need or want from these relationships to be a better person and be myself more importantly! Glens character cynical yet honest does an excellent job. The writers did an amazing job with Glen sharing his views of life and making me think of my life! Still self reflecting on if I want to be in cement or not. Literally the only thing I didn't think fit or was negative in the movie was the two of them doing coke. I loved the scene and could see drinking or getting high but for some reason to me just didn't make sense. Toms character just seems so eccentric and neat positive and has his life together. Coke must be more available in the UK.  There was a lot of points that hit home in the movie and just made me think and feel positive walking away from the movie. Highly recommend it!,1408665600,,1390,4.186567164179104

And I can only cast a glare of disapproval at Criterion for offering a film this slight when they could have used their resources to give us LA FEMME DU BOULANGER. If they particularly want to appeal to a gay audience, what about THIS SPECIAL FRIENDSHIP or Marcel Carne's slight, but charming LA MERVEILLEUSE VISITE?

4623494,4,B0059XTTZU,"It's surprising how many people have called this the new great gay romance, but in the age of gay hookup websites and apps, this is the ultimate fantasy of that generation, hoping to find a real romance off a late night hookup.  Rare is the guy who sleeps over, so maybe it happens here because of instead of meeting online both the characters of Ruseell and Glenn meet at a bar and are too drunk to have one leave at 3am.

Th kickoff of it being not just another hookup is a scene where Russell asks Glenn to speak about their own hookup in perfect detail into a tape recorder for an art project which is described as a look into the chasm between who we think we are and who we project to the rest of the world.  Glenn's answers to the aggressive questions eventually touch Russell and when he's asked to meet up again, he chooses to give him a chance, all the while knowing he's under the gun to leave for a trip the next day to America for 2 years.

Some of these plot points seem unrealistic to an actual hookup but for what we get when the two start to connect, you just go along with it. To the film's credit, it doesnt get cliche about where there is all headed, and the two men have very good chemistry despite it being combustible at times. If there has to be a gay film in the highbrow Criterion Collection, I guess this fits the bill, but it's not as romantic as advertised, especially since there's a ton of drug use in this. However, in our age of never seeing each other again, or ignoring the guy from the gym after you hookup, this passes for romance so take it for that much and enjoy this sweet film.",1402099200,,1619,4.196141479099678

4623744,5,B0059XTTZU,"anyone starving for a good gay film, i implore you to give this one a chance. i watched this movie again on prime, even though i do own it. so many gay men can relate to the endless drunk gay pick ups in bars. there is always the potential of finding something worthwhile, or more typically the tired one night stands. on character ends up with more than he bargains for when his one night stand wants a little more and forces the other to really open up. the whole movie transpires over one weekend and lives are changed. people are so often closed off and find it difficult to open up about things. both men go through separate journeys to reach the end of the movie and find out something about themselves in the end. can people really fall in love over one weekend? stranger things have happened.

so often people are afraid to speak openly or to reveal anything that is absolutely true about them self. what kind of reaction would you have if a trick all of a sudden started interrogating you the morning after? the concept is interesting and terrifying at the same time. ask yourself how often you are willing to open up to a stranger asking what and why they hooked up in the first place. it is very scary to be approached by someone who can totally disarm you. its almost an attack on your senses, you are scared to answer openly and honestly, but perhaps you should because said person is asking.

this movie is a fantasy. two men fall in love over a weekend. they unabashedly explore and delve into each other, in more ways than one. the sex scenes are nice, nothing smutty, feel real and unforced. i still call this film a fantasy because so many gay men would not let a weekend like this happen. we all have too much baggage and fear to open up like the men in this movie. but its inspiring its a challenge we should all take. to let people in to let them see our true self. to be fearless and honest. to let yourself be loved and to allow yourself to be transparent. it challenges gay men to be open to their feelings, to be allowed to feel true feelings. honesty is such a hardship in our community, take the challenge to be honest with yourself and with others. at the end of the movie both men are changed and heart broken. the romantic thing about and the refreshing aspect of the movie is how in love they are by the end of the movie. i love the heart ache in their faces, the passion of the kiss they share at then end. the movie is a challenge to gay men, watch the movie and take the challenge. opening up with yourself and others may be the best thing you ever do for yourself.

It's not like this is a carbon copy of that, but there are strong similarities, and that's also a lot of what works about this movie. When you strip everything away and just focus on two actors bringing two characters to life, the result can be pretty brilliant when done well.

And the characters of Russell and Glen don't even seem like two guys who'd get along at first glance. Russell is fairly sweet but also very lonely given his current lot in life. Glen seems to be hiding behind his intellectual talk and artistic leanings given his past trauma and relationship regrets. But then things just seem to click between the two and how this story slowly unfolds is a bit of movie magic in itself.

This was a movie done right on a number of levels starting from the writing down to the casting. It's a movie with few frills and just focuses on the story and that helped keeps it rather refreshing compared to a lot of the flashier movies out there. And the ending isn't a fairy tale one either - it's one that remains fairly grounded in reality and yet doesn't leave you feeling like you got cheated out of something.

I really like how it spun the viewer's expectations around by depicting Tom as the shy, sensitive lover to Chris' bold, arrogant personality.  Tom is physically more imposing than Chris. Tom Cullen is so tender, sweet and sensitive in this film.  I felt like I should blush in many of the parts and I did.

4623819,4,B0059XTTZU,"Weekend (2011). Not rated. Running time: One hour, 36 mins.
Directed, written and edited by Andrew Haigh.

Russell (Tom Cullen), a really nice, private gay man who lives in Nottingham, takes a bath, then puts on his black polo short, pants, leather jacket and grey plaid beret. He smokes a little grass before he leaves. He arrives at Jamie's (Jonathan Race) house for a dinner party among friends. They haven't seen him in a while. One of his friends once to see him this Sunday and when Russell is about to confide into him, a bothersome chap, who has been drinking, sits between them. Russell has not told anyone he is gay and does not act like that outside.
 Russell decides to leave the dinner party and goes into town to the gay bar. In the bathroom, he gets lucky and meets Glen (Chris New) at the urinal.
  The next morning, in Russell's bedroom, Glen admits he was just flirting with him. Glen mentions to Russell that his breath is minty while his breath is bad, but says it in a direct way. Now Glen wants Russell to do something. It is strange. He wants Russell to speak into the voice recorder about how they met last night and the juicy details about what happened last night. Glen is too serious about this and Russell really doesn't know what to say. This is only a one-nighter. Glen is being pushy, contradictive and really wants Russell to describe the entire night including his feelings. Glen then goes outside on the balcony and starts yelling at a stranger. Russell really does not like this and asks Glen to stop. Before Glen leaves, they exchange text phone numbers.
  At 10:00am, Russell goes to his job as a lifeguard at the public inside pool. On his LG phone he sends a message, ""I feel like sh__"". After work, Glen is waiting for Russell outside.

4623820,5,B0059XTTZU,"I originally rented this film from Netflix.  I had never heard of it, knew nothing about it and expected even less.  I thought I would watch it for about five minutes and that would be the end of it.  Well, I was drawn into the story in about ten minutes, and was mesmerized for the entire hour and a half.  I truly loved this movie and decided to buy it for many future viewings.

Firstly, the characters were truly likeable (Russell much more than Glen, however), and that invested me in the story and their relationship.  There are so many movies, gay-themed and not, where the characters are such jerks that I couldn't care less what happens to them.  Not so in ""Weekend"".  I was really pulling for these guys and could feel the pain of both of them.  It didn't hurt that Russell has the sweetest smile, and is the kind of guy you just want to hug and make sure he feels secure.

Secondly, the acting was just amazing.  I read that Tom Cullen (Russell) won multiple awards for this role, and I can see why.  It's hard for me to believe that there was an actual script, because the dialogue and acting was just so natural and believable.  I felt as if I was watching real life unfold right before me, rather than a film.  I read an interview with Tom Cullen, and he said that there was a bit of ad libbing here and there, but they mostly followed the script.  You would never know it, and I mean that in the best possible way.

I hardly ever cry at movies-I think ""Forrest Gump"" was the last time!  However, I cried at least five times during this film, because I found the story and characters so moving and real, and because I was so invested in their story.

Some reviewers have faulted the film for being too talky.  I didn't find that at all.  I thought their conversations were real, and let us know where each of them was coming from.  The dialogue wasn't movie-talk--it was as natural as listening to two of your friends.

I would hate for this film to ever get saddled with that deathly label ""gay film"".  Obviously, people who watch this have to at least feel comfortable with gay relationships, but the theme is universal. Who hasn't fallen head over heels with someone they hardly knew?  Love can't be explained-it just is.  And more so for these two, since they grow and learn from each other.  This is a film that can touch everyone.

Overall, a touching, real and lovely film, and one that will stay with you.  I would love a sequel to know what happens next!",1384560000,,2477,4.361050328227571
4623821,5,B0059XTTZU,This film just pains me with truth.  Very well written and performed.  At times it was a bit graphic (kids <18 should have an adult to keep some scenes in their true context vs thinking sex is just sex).  But this film is heartbreaking and everyone can relate to at least some part of it. Definitely recommend watching even though it will leave you sad in the end thinking about how it applies to your own life.,1384128000,,411,4.311688311688312

4623859,4,B0059XTTZU,"OK, I was wanting something.  But after all, this is a Criterion Collection movie.  I found myself waiting for what would happen next~!  In watching the director's comments, I see how he played the audience by dangling the carrot just out of reach until the proper time.  Wonderful film really.  Not for the Archie Bunker set by no means.  But Will and Grace?  See it.  I think you will agree.",1381017600,3,393,4.514285714285714

4623863,5,B0059XTTZU,"It is a beautiful movie that follows the instantaneous impression of emotion and sexuality
with a sense of detached believes. It merges an excellent acting, good scenography and
a perfect music. It holds you in place, awaiting for the inexorable and although is a bittersweet one

A must to see movie.",1380067200,,406,4.884057971014493
4623864,2,B0059XTTZU,"I spent three quarters of this film trying to decipher the dialogue.  The final twenty minutes made sense and were the only affecting moments in a tedious movie.  Furthermore, the sound editing was infuriating.  How can actors compete with background noise?  This love story tries hard for the big finish and delivers.  But what actions preceded it does not.  In conclusion, this film had the feel of a movie made in the seventies.  Call it kitchen sink realism.",1379203200,,462,4.846153846153846
4623955,5,B0059XTTZU,One of the nicest films I've ever seen.  Just loved the way the characters developed a deep emotional relationship in the short period of time by opening up and revealing their vulnerabilities.,1378166400,,193,5.03125
4623956,4,B0059XTTZU,"I'm gay. I loved the film. But I agree with one commentator that there are viewers who will be ""nauseated"" by the events portrayed and who would benefit from a more explicit warning in advance of experiencing this work. I, myself, was somewhat uncomfortable at times -- even though there was nothing in the film that I didn't personally experience when I was younger. I am now 74, and yes, my upbringing did leave me with lingering negative feelings about promiscuity, sex and drugs -- some of which I believe may be valid. I'm still unsure about this stuff. Despite those feelings, I was deeply moved by the story. I will see it again.",1377993600,,636,4.587719298245614
4623957,5,B0059XTTZU,"This was a really good movie with really good actors. The chemistry between the two principal actors was obvious and made the movie even hotter. This is a story that is so true to life with a plot and story line that echos what many gay men go through in meeting a person in the bars except this turned out to be more than a one night stand. It is well played and not campy or weird, it is a story of love that was meant to be but in the end wasn't.",1377648000,,449,3.838709677419355
4623958,5,B0059XTTZU,"AMAZING SAUCE!!!
I really loved watching this! It was really well-acted and you really came to care about the characters and the relationship that they developed. The story was pretty realistic and I just thought it was a really enjoyable watch. So many cute moments and other moments that will really stick in your mind (in a good way, of course!)",1377216000,,348,4.721311475409836
4623959,5,B0059XTTZU,This is one of the all-time best gay movies I've ever seen. Chris New and Tom Cullen do an outstanding job with (apparently straight) Tom Cullen being absolutely remarkable.,1377129600,,173,5.0

4623961,5,B0059XTTZU,"The movie started a little slow, but once the story line became evident, it showed itself to be a great piece.",1376870400,,110,4.285714285714286
4623962,4,B0059XTTZU,I thought the acting was good.  The interaction between the couple was interesting.  Two men relate differently than a man and a woman.  They were honest with each other.  No games played.  I enjoyed the interaction between the two. I had sympathy for each man because I don't feel that the relationship helped either one. I liked it. I would recommend it. I would like to see a sequel two years down the road and see what happened to each one. I will watch it again. I'm new to this genre so I haven't formed opinions yet.,1376524800,5,523,4.350515463917525
4623963,5,B0059XTTZU,"What immediately caught my eye while scanning gay-themed films was the fact that Criterion Collection thought this work important enough to release it under their label....""Criterion"" always produced a top-notch product; both in audible and visual terms. I rely heavily on the ratings I see here---if they're not at least 4-1/2 stars I tend to take a pass on them. There's other criteria I use as well, e.g., if film is something from the UK, Australia or Canada I tend to give it extra weight. If it's a 5 star rating I'm interested but always want to read the person(s) who may have given it a 1 star to review their objections.
As to ""Weekend"" itself; I doubt that I would have given the film a 5 star rating if not for the actor playing Russell (TOM CULLEN). Obviously, he's the center of the film's attention and it's his outlook on life and love, which he tries to convince Glenn (Chris New), should be the focus. Unfortunately, Glenn is out solely for a good time between-the-sheets---plenty justifiable---while the more gentle and sensitive Russell is looking for something more meaningful and possibly longer lasting. There's plenty lines (nose app variety vs rhetorical) and weed consumption to help keep both gents well-horned and drained but my sense is that Russell is engaging in it to ""connect"" with Glenn while Glenn's character is well aware he's about moving-on in life. The question is: Is what Russell offering strong enough to keep Glenn from pursuing his dreams....or have both managed to teach each other a little lesson in regards to affairs of the heart?
The film's Director, Andrew Haigh, seemed to allow the actors time to develop the relationship on their own terms. The story may seem a bit slow at times but for some unknown reason I keep replaying this disc every now and then---probably because the Tom Cullen character is so endearing---you want him to find a mate and be happy. He asks for so little.
If you like Tom Cullen's work, look for him in the upcoming season of ""Downton Abby""; apparently he's set to play the new love-interest of Lady Mary.",1376438400,6,2084,4.775623268698061
4623964,5,B0059XTTZU,I watch this movie monthly; it's one of my favorites. Doesn't have to just be a 'gay' movie. either. I think anyone (at least anyone with an open mind) can enjoy it.,1375660800,,165,4.1875
4624015,5,B0059XTTZU,"Everybody has genre favorites. For romantic movies, for me, the Notebook tops the list. The second is this, the Weekend, and third is Princess Bride. If you are familiar with these movies, then you know how highly I regard Weekend.",1375488000,,231,4.8
4624016,4,B0059XTTZU,"Totally refreshing!  completely avoided  the usual portrayal as either tragic or ridiculous. The characters are both likeable, and believable.  While the primary focus is a passionate week end, there is a depth to these guys, they are 3 dimensional.",1375228800,3,249,5.333333333333333
4624017,5,B0059XTTZU,"Aside from the nearly continuous use of drugs which oddly seemed to have very little impact on the two characters using them, this was a beautifully realistic portrayal of two young men in the early stages of a developing romantic relationship. The writing was excellent and the story unfolded very naturally. Well acted and directed.",1375142400,,334,5.090909090909091

4624020,5,B0059XTTZU,"This film really hits hard. It has an unintentional emotional impact due to the character's and actor's ability to transcend off of the screen. As you watch the beautifully written film, you become captivated in the story. In the romance. While tackling some lesser known issues in the gay community as well as a general community, you fall for the lovers. The subtle chemistry leads to a devastating ending that, while you don't know how you became so entangled, you're glad and unwillingly satisfied. A great film and a real piece of art. Will leave you hauntingly captivated. Breathless.",1374105600,,590,4.96969696969697
4624021,5,B0059XTTZU,Weekend is a lapse of time over about 3 days and 2 men with different views on who they are and what they want from life.

4624022,5,B0059XTTZU,"This is an intimate look at two men as they fall in love on the weekend before one of them leaves Nottingham for Portland, Oregon. Andrew Haigh's movie is sincere and realistic and the performances by Tom Cullen and Chris New are perfect.  For an hour and a half, you are drawn into the budding relationship of these very different men and you are thoroughly convinced.  While it most definitely a story of two men in a particular setting, the story of love and growth is universal.  Beautifully done ... very moving.",1373155200,,517,4.5978260869565215
4624023,5,B0059XTTZU,"Andrew Haigh's breakthrough sophomore feature packs a punch. Featuring two incredible newcomers in the lead roles, ""Weekend"" is quite the wonder. The film shares the aesthetic qualities of a Vampire Weekend album, and one can't help but ponder whether or not the film's director was a bit inspired by the quartet's music. This whole film feels stylistically to represent the feeling of our current time: the fashion, the freshness, the music, and the agenda. This film may seem small, but it's got big ideas.
Set during a three-day period in which Russell and Glen question turning a passionate sexual encounter into a relationship before one of them leaves England for America, the film examines the duo question and challenge each other as they become familiar. These characters feel so real, and the film avoids the normal troupes that films these days jump to to try to understand LGBT relationships. This film is truthful sexually, emotionally, and stylistically. A great start for what will hopefully be an illustrious career for director Haigh.

The DVD is wonderful. Criterion added a few of Haigh's short features and some other great bonuses to create a great director-approved set. Kudos to the director and to Criterion for releasing this gem! Great product.",1372723200,,1270,5.1352657004830915

4624069,5,B0059XTTZU,"Weekend is quite possibly the most authentic movie I've ever seen. It does not feel scripted or remotely theatrical; we are mere observers of 48 hours between two strangers. The dialogue, content, and raw emotion are more real than anything I've seen in other films.

The basic premise is that two young men meet and hook up at a gay bar. They awake the next morning, clearly having had sex, and yet they struggle to build up a conversation. The sex part was easy; the romance is more difficult. As the day progresses, one man texts the other and they meet up again. They develop the kind of infectious relationship of meeting someone once but instantly having a connection, and wanting to revisit that habitually.

Their lives and insecurities are explored more thoroughly as the film progresses, through heart-sinking drama that we don't get in most romantic dramas (if you can even call this a romance). Much of their bickering is how they deal with being gay in a largely heternormative world, but their struggles and frustrations with one another are universal to anyone who's been in a relationship, and ultimately, the heavy silence when a discussion's hit a dead end.

Weekend, one of the best films of 2011, is so special because it is all the more relatable through its specificity. Without defining clear characters, the intimacy and believability of this relationship would not ring true with audiences. I saw it twice in two days and am eager to revisit again soon. The climactic ending, while not exactly happy or sad, makes you want to go back to the beginning and go through this experience again. As one of the men says, in the film's final line, ""Go back to when we first met.""",1369440000,,1695,4.738983050847458

4624072,4,B0059XTTZU,"I started watching ""Weekend"" not expecting much but I decided to watch it because of the great reviews. I thought it would be another gay-themed film with a clich plot and not much to offer. However, what a big surprise it turned out to be. It's a film that's still lingering in my mind even though I watched it a couple of days ago. I do have an issue with the sound, specially at the clubs, but, as a whole, the film was well done for what I assume was a low budget production. I read some reviews complaining because they couldn't understand what the characters were saying. Well, I speak English as a second language, and I didn't even learn it in the UK, and I was able to understand pretty much everything. Sure, a few words escaped me, but to say that people were speaking ""a strange local slang"" shows nothing but ignorance. It's a British film, so, of course, they speak British English.

First, I really loved how intimate and intense the atmosphere was. I felt I was living their experience on the set as the movie progressed and each character got to know each other. Second, I thought they had meaningful and important conversations, very often about what it's like to be gay and relationships, although the film never came across as preachy or pretentious or educational. Tom Cullen's performance is so honest that, for a second, you think he's being himself and not really playing a part. I felt his angst and his story to be very convincing, and I would even dare and say that the film is worth watching just for his performance and the character he portrays. Some of the bad reviews about this film claim that ""Weekend"" is about a couple of losers, and I wonder if movies should only be about ""winners"" or ""heroes"". ""Weekend"" is about real people, and call me a loser then, but I was able to relate to both characters even though I am a professional with a respectable job. However, I did think that all the getting high was rather distracting and it didn't add anything to the plot, that's why I gave the film 4 and not 5 stars.",1365552000,3,2046,4.456

4624163,5,B0059XTTZU,"realist here, which is why i liked the film.  ''weekend'' was well produced and written, it was compelling and melancholic. i liked how russ was developed -- showed a greater diversity of gay men and their views of life/love/maleness etc.  in a way, it was uplifting too because i think both russ and glen acknowledged the experience of how their meeting enabled growth; they engaged and evolved their physical and emotional touch from just chance to a more exact, extremely intimate and trusting experience as a means of producing a solution for isolation and aloneness.

now, the optimist in me hopes that a year later, characters russ and glen come back together because they realized what they have (or could build together) actually mattered most to begin a true ltr.  that type of post-script is what i hope  becomes ''the norm'' more often in gay films as well as in real life. that would counter, what i think has become, a chronic cultural norm of searching for someone better. when one turns 45-50 in this rather isolated community, he understands the futility of that search against his own ''weekend'' memory.",1358726400,,1121,4.878947368421053

4624228,5,B0059XTTZU,"I avoided this film like the plague for the longest time before watching it out of boredom one night. I was honestly surprised by how much it resonated with me. It lacked just about cliche element that I thought it contained prior to watching. I dislike most gay themed films. To me, they are just simply not honest and upfront enough about what they're about. Few films, to me, have really shown how it is to be gay. So often do filmmakers fail to pull it off that it actually sort of makes me sick when I even bother to try and take a chance on a new gay film. It doesn't even matter, most of the time, if the film ends up being any good upon conclusion, as I often feel totally off put by some sort of aspect of it. I honestly don't think that most filmmakers can truly pull off making an effective and resonant film about the gay experience. Some of the best ones I've seen are coming of age pictures (SHOW ME LOVE, YOU ARE NOT ALONE, etc). Aside from those, the occasional genre film, some indie slices of life here and there (SHELTER, MYSTERIOUS SKIN, MY OWN PRIVATE IDAHO), and some good foreign films occasionally do the trick. I'm not going to lie, it is disheartening to me. Why can't people pull it off? What is it about homosexuality that freaks people out so damn much? To me, it all has to do with societal fears. Most filmmakers are afraid to explore what a gay relationship truly is like. Most folks feel a lot more comfortable placing gender barriers around their gay characters and would rather pretend that two gay men or two gay women sleeping together are no different than a man and a woman sleeping together. In truth, and I'm sure I'm gonna get some flack for this, a gay relationship is completely different from a straight relationship. Everything, from body language to physical contact is approached in completely different ways than in straight relationships, and pretending that one person in a two person relationship is the man or the woman in opposition to their partner simply doesn't change the fact that they are still two people with the exact same anatomy as one another. Now, one could go on about bisexuality or what it means to be in a relationship with a transsexual, and that's all well and good. I could talk about the worlds of bisexual men and women until the sun rises (and in fact I have), but when it comes to someone like me who is looking for a gay themed film to speak to me, I'm one to take lots of chances. Like I've said, I've seen a lot of horrendous films. Most of the films I've seen are, one could say, gay versions of films that already exist! BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is GONE WITH THE WIND. Oh my gosh, EDGE OF SEVENTEEN is like a gay John Hughes films! What's all this I'm hearing about a friggin' gay version of ROMEO & JULIET? The point I'm trying to make is that people always have to try and put gay relationships into these straight, ""idealized"" positions, and while there's really nothing wrong with that I think that it takes a lot of way from the organic ingenuity and the beauty of what it means to be gay and to be in love with someone of the same gender. There truly is a lot of beauty in that concept, but because of the way society and the media have progressed, we cannot help but feel that gay people are more effective as punchlines or as an undesirable end, which I find infuriating. Nothing irritates me more when I see a film in which a character shrugs off a gay relationship with any kind of fear or disgust. I don't care if someone doesn't want to see it. Gay people have had plenty of it shoved down their throats for, literally, decades, and I personally find it equally offensive when gay folks flaunt their sexuality out in the open. The way I see it, sexuality, nudity, and sex itself is a beautiful and incredible thing, no matter who does it and how. One of the things that this film WEEKEND realizes right off is that there is a lot of beauty in the idea of being a gay man lying naked in bed drinking a cup of tea and having another man's bare ass resting in between your crotch.

So I have noticed that many people have called this the BEFORE SUNRISE of gay films. Well, they're both about the triumph of young love, they're both about people who have a limited amount of time to spend with one another, and they're both about intelligent people having long conversations about things, but otherwise I feel they are nothing alike. I love both films to death, but really this is a completely different kind of world than the world of Cline and Jesse. No, these two guys have nothing in common with them and little in common even with one another. I'd go so far as to say that the film ONCE is a slightly more truthful comparison, but even that is a stretch to me (mainly due to the fact that, well, this isn't a musical). Here we have a film in which this older twenty something named Russell (Tom Cullen) decides to ditch some sort of friendly function in order to maybe engage in some anonymous sex. He has an encounter with a younger, sassier, friendly little guy named Glen (Chris New) who immediately, within minutes of waking up the next morning, shoves a recorder in her face asking him to share intimate details of the fun they had last night. It is after this brief exchange that they begin to rock one another's worlds, in the verbal sense anyway, though occasionally drifting away into dirty, yet loving, sex with one another. As the film continues on they challenge one another, occasionally driving each other crazy, but never are they fully able to admit, at least not right away, that they are undeniably smitten with one another. One of them (Russell) doesn't like to ""date"". The other (Glen) is still feeling a lot of heartache from a previous failed relationship. Glen, unfortunately for them (and for us), has to leave Europe to go to America for a school project, so they only have the entire weekend to spend together. By the end of that weekend, the two will have grown into different people whose previous fears and instincts will have evolved and they will forever be haunted by one another. These two men are basically going to change each other's lives.

To be honest, this film WEEKEND couldn't have come at a better time for me in my life. I'm going through the process of going through a break-up after a great four year run, and it is really hard for me to do. I totally got where the Glen character was coming from in describing his feelings about the relationship he had. This film gave me a lot of hope for myself to find someone. I've never been the best at maintaining relationships prior to this 4 year relationship that just ended, and that's why I'm pretty scared to even start thinking about something like that again considering how painful it is for me, right now, to just move on. I never thought that I was the kind of guy who could get so attached to someone like that, and that's why it hurts so much for me to force myself to move on after seeing myself in a totally different place than that. I can't help but feel that I am no longer loved, even though I know that isn't the case. Many of the scenes in this film captured the feelings and the fear of loneliness without being alone. The film also captured the feel of a relationship with another man, right down to the smell of the sex, and one of the things that struck me the most about this film was how adult these people were about their circumstances. This isn't the kind of film that is going to take the time to hold the viewer by the hand and thrust them into the very adult world of love and lust and attraction and sexual behavior. This film, unapologetically, thrusts you in, but does it in a way that never feels exploitative or even gratuitous. In fact, there's relatively little nudity in the film at all. The picture, when it comes to sex, never boils down to details, instead opting to take the MY OWN PRIVATE IDAHO route and use simple gestures and feelings associated with sex to develop the relationship.

I keep mentioning the sex because, quite honestly, the sex is one of the most important parts of almost all relationships. Here, the sex between these two functions as a kind of bridge between these guys to try and at least absorb the sensitivity of their passionate emotions. It happens to be most felt during the dialogue scenes, but that doesn't mean that their relationship is primarily physical. In fact, it is anything but. What these men provide in one another is a sense of leveling as well as a sense of emotional security in one another for them to be able to count on. These two men don't fail one another, and while their discussions may get heated, particularly during a particularly drug fueled night, they can never quite bring themselves to allow the other to escape their grasps, even when they feel that they've finally found a reason or two to do so. Because of this, their relationship feels genuinely romantic, as does the film, and the film chooses to use simple, doe-eyed touches to show this rather than resorting to cliches or story constraints to try and develop stakes that don't even need to exist. WEEKEND is a very loving, sweet, cute film, and the best part about it is that it is organically so. It doesn't resort to montages or goofy plot twists and misunderstandings to try and strengthen something that is already so beautiful and so powerful.

If you are looking for a film that is honest about love without being trite or ill-conforming, or if you are simply just looking for a good old fashioned love story and you are open-minded enough to enjoy a love story that you may or may not be able to fully grasp, at least on a physical level, I simply cannot think of that many better recent examples than WEEKEND. Watch it with your girlfriend or your boyfriend. Watch it by yourself if you want to. To me, it doesn't matter if you're gay or straight. This film, despite exploring gay culture on at least a somewhat substantial level, deals with some very universal emotions. Everyone, whether they are gay or straight, has felt like these two men at one time in their lives or another. Everyone experiences a lot of discomforting revelations, truths, and questions about themselves, and the men in this film deal with those same things. The only difference is that they love each other so much that they aren't afraid to share those experiences, questions, and thoughts with one another because they both understand that they are part of a minority that is going to be treated as lesser for a long time still. WEEKEND is a progressive love story that explores the depths of human emotion without forgetting that the love story is, and always will be, one of the most satisfying kinds of stories for always until the end of time.",1353888000,20,10774,4.4786368260427265

I am a college student who is taking a course which has asked me to examine culture/art/interviews about a topic that is controversial to a massive amount of people. I felt that my instructor would think that the topic of homosexuality would be cliche and overdone, but he was actually delighted that I had picked this subject to dive into. I searched around the internet looking for something that would honestly give me a view of the gay community and the feelings portrayed between two people condemned for their love choices. I found this film last night and decided today to sit down and try to watch it.
 All I can say is that I've been blown away in the most subtle way imaginable. I found myself so completely drowned in the emotions of the characters that I didn't look away for a second. I still, to this point in time, cannot place why I was so caught up in the story. They looked into each others' eyes and I felt the passion. It was simply beautiful, elegant, scary, curious, sad, deep, wonderful, and real. I felt like I was an invisible person walking around sharing in these two men's lives. Yet the images were incredible; the camera work, lighting, and sound were pretty much perfect. I eventually checked to make sure it WASN'T a real documentary, and if perhaps these actors had won any outstanding awards for their performances. I could write ten thousand words about this piece of art. It wasn't boring, slow, or unoriginal. I believed, from start to finish, that these men held an attraction for each other that not only grew between the two of them, but it made them ponder life questions and come to terms with who they were. The story was simple enough not to be overdone, but it wasn't slow enough and undeveloped enough to bore you. I can't say much more... I feel speechless.

The subtleties of the strong performances are what made me most feel like I was looking into some kind of mirror. There is a scene where Russell is on the public transit amidst a throng of teenagers where he depicts through body language and mannerisms what I recognize as a distinctly gay form of self-consciousness that many gay people have learned growing up trying our best to modify our behavior. The dalliance itself is very real in it's awkwardness, in the romance of living in a culture where very few promises are made and where experiences slip into memory. As if the very thing that made you feel so alive, that rare connection, feels almost like a dream in a world so evenly paced in quotidian routine.",1347840000,3,1102,4.835978835978836

4624319,5,B0059XTTZU,"`Weekend' is basically running dialog between two gay men on the cusp of a serious relationship.  They meet at a club, they spend the night together and they wake up to a connection they didn't expect and a weekend that will prove to be their last together that builds in each of them the hope of a different tomorrow.

I want to first address the idea that this is a `Gay Movie'.  I've been one to always search for a universal tone to films because I feel that most films (at least the important ones) can reach a wider audience if one is willing to open their minds to what they are seeing and find their own sense of poignancy inside the film's themes.  For instance, I have refused to consider `Brokeback Mountain' a `Gay Film' because, to me, it is more a film about forbidden love and really just as poignant and universally understood as `Romeo + Juliet'.  For me though, `Weekend' is undoubtedly a `Gay Movie'.  It really strikes a chord within that particular community and becomes a poster child for gay relationships that, while I can see and should see a transference to the straight world and more or less the idea of relationships as a whole, the film's primary focus is the stigmas and the controversial ideals surrounding gay romance.  I actually think that it is important to understand that this movie is about gay romance because it is that aspect of the film and its construction that make it so moving.

It makes you think.

Oh, and I just want to say that Tom Cullen's beautifully pure portrayal of Russell is one of the acting highlights of the year; easily.

The film opens with Russell getting ready for a night out.  He goes to visit his best friend and his wife and their friends and he seems content, yet a little withdrawn and somewhat unhappy.  He leaves and heads over to a gay club where he spies out a few potential dates and winds up fondling Glen and taking him home.  The next morning Glen practically pushes a tape recorder in Russell's face and asks him what he remembers about their night together.  Despite his apparent uncomfortable feelings, Russell seems intrigued by Glen, to the point where he texts him later and they wind up hooking up.  From that point forward they cultivate the beginnings of love by talking and talking and talking some more; sharing secrets and feelings and concerns and ultimately baring their souls in ways that they aren't used to nor have ever been comfortable with.  It is within those conversations that `Weekend' becomes so important.  Whether they are sharing intimate details about their sexual partners (Russell's reading of a journal entry regarding a married man was particularly emotional and unnerving) or confessing personal feelings with regard to their sexuality (the way that Russell openly admits wishing he were straight at times was particularly brave and certainly says a lot about the soul of this film) or just sifting through dialog in a way to make conversation; Glen and Russell are becoming real people in a real world in a real situation.

As `Weekend' draws to a close it begins to wind down in a similar way to its beginning, which is where I wished it would have ended.  With those bookends it would have made a big statement about the slow progression of change, but instead it shook up that moment by adding a predictable twist (that `Notting Hill' moment).  I would have liked the last five minutes to have been bypassed, but I understand why they were there and they really don't take anything away from this tremendous film.

Whether you are straight or gay, `Weekend' will touch you because it is honest.  Honesty is something that is often overlooked in cinema, so when it comes along it is important to grab hold of it and truly appreciate all that it is saying to you.  `Weekend' says so much with seemingly so little.",1346284800,5,3828,4.655274888558693
4624320,4,B0059XTTZU,"I have only one problem with this movie, but it's a big one, and it's the only thing that keeps me from giving it five enthusiastic stars. The problem is the drugs. Russ and Glen (and all their friends) use drugs CONSTANTLY, and it seriously undermines the movie's credibility and effectiveness.

It's impossible for me to believe that illegal drug use is so widespread and so rampant in the English working class these people seem to belong to, in a rather provincial city like Nottingham. If it is, then England is a whole lot more different from America than I thought it was. But even if Weekend is accurate in that respect, it undermines the otherwise wonderful story this movie tells, and tells more beautifully and more realistically than any other movie I know of.

To me, it's a shame, because the always-in-your-face drug use leaches focus off the two guys onto a side issue that is not really as important in their relationship as its percentage of screen time would indicate. I don't care about drugs one way or another, but I do care about movies, and the heavy drug use in this movie undermines its power by distracting the viewer's attention away from the characters. Drug use is integral to some movies, but not this one; here it's an unnecessary - and annoying - distraction.",1346025600,9,1292,4.687224669603524
4624321,5,B0059XTTZU,"Wow-- such a raw, beautiful, moving and touching movie. Incredible performances by both lead actors. It felt so real and relatable. Highly recommended.",1345852800,3,151,5.608695652173913
4624322,4,B0059XTTZU,"I believe this is what the film 9 Songs wanted to be. At the end of that movie, I didn't feel anything when the girl left the guy when in Weekend, yes, there was something there when the two guys split up. And it's not because of sexual orientation that one is better connected to the other. Honestly, all I remembered from 9 Songs was that the guy had hardcore sex with the girl. The discussion then would be did the hardcore sex get in the way of the story? Perhaps but that's for another review.

I am not a big fan of gay movies for the most part as I find them either too over the top or too gutless. Weekend would be the exception to a large degree. I feel there are holes in the film which I'll explain later in the review but overall the film works.

Is it possible to meet someone over the course of time of 48 hours and have that person change your life? Sure why not!? Is it possible to fall in love with someone over that same amount of time? Crazier things can happen in life so again, why not?! But for those like me who are a bit skeptical, we pretty much understand the chances of all that happening are quite slim in today's world. The romanticism that's depicted in the movie is pretty much old-fashion and dare I say dead!? But isn't that what we all secretly yearn for anyways? We find that person that comes into our lives even if it's for a slight moment and we open ourselves up and take a chance even if we get hurt in the end. That's the risk that comes with finding love.

I feel the character Tom Cullen plays is better equipped to find his hook-ups at a place that's more like a sex club instead of a gay bar based on his psychology. But that's just my opinion!

I personally didn't find the sex in the movie graphic to be honest and not that I wanted it to be more hardcore but there was something missing there. Like it was too tame perhaps. The story would've been brilliant if the sex scenes were a bit more interesting and then you would've had the intimate moments between the two guys where they discuss their fears and such which was actually played convincingly by the two actors.

There was a scene where I felt Chris New needed to work a bit more on his improvisational skills. The scene that I'm referring to is when his character asks Russell on the second day they meet perhaps they can go out that night. I believe he wanted to show how uncomfortable his character felt about doing that and so as a defense mechanism he puts on the hoodie he was wearing. For some reason I wasn't all that convinced and felt the scene came off a bit too contrived.
But both male lead actors did a good job. I think Tom Cullen has the right idea about where he'd like to go with his career based on the interviews he's given.

Adding the music of John Grant was an exceptional plus! If the song at the end doesn't have you in tears or at least in a pensive mood then I don't know if you have blood in your veins.

I'm not sure if this movie would truly transcend to the straight community. I mean I guess those with an open heart can appreciate it but in the end it's an intimate story about two gay men and I believe that'll be an obstacle to some degree for those who may want to find a complete connection.

The way the movie ended is actually quite powerful and I'm glad it was done in a more open-ended manner. You can't help but wonder what will happen to those guys? How will they both utilize in future days what they've learned about themselves in the last 48 hours? But most importantly, will their paths cross again? So many questions and only time will tell.",1345852800,2,3595,4.2075471698113205

4624324,5,B0059XTTZU,"My partner and I saw this movie in NYC at the IFC Theatre a few months ago, and it really moved us. We're not young, not into drug culture, and weren't seeing it hoping for a glimpse of some eye candy. We had read a review in The New York Times, checked it on Rotten Tomatoes and seen what a high rating both critics AND audiences alike had given it, and that was the draw for us. What a raw and beautiful film...!!

The two lead characters in the movie have very little in common, at least in my estimation, except for the fact that they're both gay, young, attractive, and affected by the slings and arrows of surviving in a predominantly straight world. They're very opposite, and therein lies the attraction. Yes, they use recreational drugs like a lot of gay youth. I think the movie does a good job of exploring the demons that cause them to have the kind of low self-worth that drives many gay people to abuse substances. Yet, there is a beauty in the love that develops very quickly between them--despite their self-destructive tendencies. Much bubbles to the surface in their drug fueled time together that might otherwise lie dormant if substances weren't being used, and the crashing down of walls that is the result.

Seldom have I seen a film of such gritty honesty. It is uncomfortable seeing the story unfold.

Structurally, this movie is so sound.  The characters are fully developed, their character arcs are realized and touching, the dialogue is so real and so haunting, and the actors are just perfect. They have chemistry and even more than that, I completely believed their performances. Holy crap, Chris New, I have a hard time believing he didn't inject a lot of himself into Glen because he just seemed so comfortable in the part. I want to see both Chris and Tom in a lot more, they were both excellent.

The movie is just such a beautiful marriage of excellent writing and acting, it's a rare gem.

I will warn you though that the sound quality on the movie is terrible. It's hard to hear any of the conversations going on around them and you lose a lot if you don't hear all of it. I would recommend watching it with the closed captions on, at least at some point, because that's what I did on my third viewing and I was shocked at just how many little bits of conversation or other people's dialogue that I missed that really enhanced the story for me. I mean, especially in the last scene, I didn't hear anything other than the cat call whistle and it changed the way the last scene felt for me once I realized that Russell was actually responding to more than just a whistle.

4624375,4,B0059XTTZU,"Okay, 4 out of 5 stars only because the film reinforces some gay stereotypes that I wish it didn't.

However, at the same time this is one of the most honest portrayals of gay life that I've ever seen on the screen--first in a theater and now on blu-ray. It's hard to believe that only one of these actors (Chris New) is gay, because they achieve a level of intimacy that is so authentic, you feel you're spending time with people you know.

In an interview included in the Special Features, director Andrew Haigh talks with Tom Cullen (Russell) and Chris New (Glen). The two actors talk about the level of trust that they established with each other and how that added to the film's realism. The much-overused word ""chemistry"" is invoked, and for once it seems appropriate.

As characters, Russell and Glen, two single gay guys who meet in a bar on a Friday night,  are hardly a match made in heaven. Russell is a down-to-earth type who is reasonably content with his life and his job as a lifeguard. He wants to find love and a relationship. Glen is a difficult guy who doesn't seem to be content with anything, and doesn't want the usual things--doesn't even want a boyfriend, let alone a permanent relationship. He is an artist, or, as it is usually put, ""wants to be"" an artist, and his restlessness is taking him to America and a two-year course of study in modern art. Oh, and he's leaving on Sunday.

The plot of the film doesn't provide opportunities for a surprise ending; everything goes more or less as we expect it to. But the performances are so good that the movie is riveting just the same. And deep into the night, when the two men are high and sharing their most private thoughts, we feel privileged to witness them. They are talking about the gay world versus the straight world, and what happiness is, and what their lives should lead them to. They are talking about what we talk about when we talk about love.",1337472000,2,1930,4.502857142857143
4624376,4,B0059XTTZU,"In Weekend, Director Andrew Haigh gracefully yet candidly explores what happens when two people meet for the first time, become sexually intimate within hours, and eventually part ways going opposite destinations.  Set in Nottingham, UK, Russell (Tom Cullen) is a reserved lifeguard that randomly picks up Glen (Chris New), an artist, in a nightclub on a Friday night, leading the audience to believe a one-night stand will be the finale.  But it turns out there is a lot of chemistry and curiosity between the two. Glen learns that Russell struggles with being open about his sexual preference because as Glen tries to publicly display affection, Russell wants to shake hands and keep a safe distance.  Russell has a straight married best friend and is godfather to his pal's children.  Furthermore, Russell depends heavily on drugs and booze to lower his inhibitions and before letting his guard down to have sex.  Russell wants a committed relationship. When Glen asked Russell was he happy, Glen's response was that he was doing just fine.  On the other hand, Glen is adamant about not having a boyfriend but Russell learns from Glen's female roommate that Glen is angry, if not bitter, from a previous relationship.  Russell is matter-of-factly told by Glen that he is leaving the next day headed to America.  Glen explains he is moving to Portland, Oregon, to take an art history course for two years to move ahead in life.  Russell fervently predicts that as Glen gets lonely in Portland, and misses his friends from home, Glen will compromise his gayness for loneliness and blend into the straight life.  Glen states that he admires the gays in America. Glen believes the American gays fight for their equality and freedom and don't seek the approval or permission of those that are straight.  The emotional bond intensifies as both exchange stories about their childhood, as Russell meets Glen's friends, and as Glen reads Russell's laptop journal of sexual encounters. Both characters are fighting inner demons thus searching for peace and resolve.

Weekend is both dark and luminous. It transcends beyond a movie about the gay experience of ""coming out"". Weekend is a movie about the human experience to push out of passivity and into strength.  Actors Tom Cullen and Chris New delivered capturing performances and served as a convincing pair.

Glen is everything Russell is not--brash, outspoken, unashamedly gay.  For that reason, apparently, Russell is drawn to him.  But unfortunately for Russell, the bitter, cynical Glen does not ""do relationships"" or anything else that involves any sort of emotional entanglements.

The two spend the weekend having sex, snorting coke and arguing endlessly.  Not much else happens.  Cullen and New give fine performances, but it is hard to get too enthusiastic about their characters.  The same is true for the film.  At times it is funny, occasionally it is moving, but there just isn't much for the viewer to grab hold of.  It is too distant and aloof.  A drama needs some kind of an emotional center, someone or something the viewer can care about or relate to.  But there is no heart inside all the talk that goes on during this ""Weekend"", or if there is it is as cold and hard as if it were carved from ice.",1331337600,,1082,4.671957671957672
4624384,5,B0059XTTZU,"My partner and I saw this movie in NYC at the IFC Theatre a few months ago, and it really moved us.  We're not young, not into drug culture, and weren't seeing it hoping for a glimpse of some eye candy.  We had read a review in The New York Times, checked it on Rotten Tomatoes and seen what a high rating both critics AND audiences alike had given it, and that was the draw for us.  What a raw and beautiful film...!!

The two lead characters in the movie have very little in common, at least in my estimation, except for the fact that they're both gay, young, attractive, and affected by the slings and arrows of surviving in a predominantly straight world.  They're very opposite, and therein lies the attraction.  Yes, they use recreational drugs like a lot of gay youth.  I think the movie does a good job of exploring the demons that cause them to have the kind of low self-worth that drives many gay people to abuse substances.  Yet, there is a beauty in the love that develops very quickly between them--despite their self-destructive tendencies.  Much bubbles to the surface in their drug fueled time together that might otherwise lie dormant if substances weren't being used, and the crashing down of walls that is the result.

Seldom have I seen a film of such gritty honesty.  It is uncomfortable seeing the story unfold.  But somehow it manages to crawl under the skin with the precision of a microscope of acuity, revealing so much about what drives us gay humans to the extremes that a marginalized existence sometimes does.  I thought it said more about how societal pressures, whether real or imagined, get in the way of gay people being able to just live and love.  A must see!",1331078400,27,1695,4.551155115511551

8463117,5,B0059XTTZU,"The gold standard of quiet, slow-burning, gay love stories.  Exquisitely directed and acted, everyone involved makes magic out of commonplace situations and conversations.  Dramatic, without overreaching into camp, the film can at first seem slow paced until you realize that you really have witnessed two people falling in love in a most natural and unexpected way.",1511395200,3,366,5.517857142857143

I have NEVER seen such a film outside of Brokeback Mountain that had so much substance for a gay themed movie. Deeply true to life, emotional and stirring, this film hit home in my heart.",1498003200,,361,4.553846153846154
