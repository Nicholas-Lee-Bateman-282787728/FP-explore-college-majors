1196531,4,B000007NTY,"This was director Ingmar Bergman's break-through film, the winner of the 1956 Grand Prix at the Cannes Film Festival, the first of his many internationally acclaimed films.  The story is a time honored one, referrencing the same tradition of romantic complications found in Shakespeare's A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM and Rostand's LA RONDE: every one is either in love with or married to the wrong person.
A famous actress with two very different lovers invites both, their wives, and the son of one lover to her mother's country estate in the hope of sorting out the romantic entanglements to her satisfaction--and the result is considerable charm and unexpectedly dry wit.  All the performances are excellent, with Eva Dahlbeck's Desiree a standout, but the real star of this ensemble piece is the unexpectedly witty script.  Never quite veering over into broad farce but never sinking into romantic sentimentality, it is a very precisely written tale, and both cast and director make the most of it.
In the face of Bergman's later work, SMILES OF A SUMMER NIGHT may seem rather slight, and indeed both psychology and cinematography is considerably less complex than one expects.  Even so, it is very much a Bergman film: the visual style is distinct, and the themes of appearances vs. reality, the inability to correctly interpret another's behavior, and the failure to understand one's self are very much in evidence--only here to comic effect.  It is in every way a charming film that Bergman fans will enjoy.
Incidently, SMILES OF A SUMMER NIGHT was successfully translated to the stage as the musical A LITTLE NIGHT MUSIC, the score of which includes the famous ""Send In The Clowns.""  Fans of the original film will be interested to compare the two works.",1040083200,11,1759,5.006849315068493
1196532,5,B000007NTY,"Despite Ingmar Bergman's reputation for darkly serious films, his breakthrough film is a lighthearted comedy about the weird human ways when it comes to love, and relationships. Every scene is delightful, with discourses and puns between men and women talking about love. As well Bergman throws in philosophy even though this film is a comedy.
Fredrik is a lawyer in Sweden at the turn of the century, who lives with a very young wife, and son, as well as a house maid. After Fredrik visits his ex mistress, and has a quarrel with her lover-friend, she invites them, and their family to her mothers estate for a quirky night with quite a few surprises and revelations of everyone's true feelings. As everyone starts to feel helpless with their lovers, the film ends in a great spirit reminiscent of classical comedy.
Anyone who appreciates comedies needs to see this film, as it is a masterpiece of the genre. It won the Cannes Film Festival's Grand Prize for Best Comedy, and appeared on numerous Top Ten lists. Bergman masterfully directs scene after scene of humorous insight into the characters, and general humans, odd dealings in love. The characters range from young flirting girls, to serious virtuous Christians. The acting is wonderful as always, from Bergman's team of actors. I recommend this very much. If only someone would release a good DVD of this classic, we all can enjoy it. 5 stars. Check it out.",1038268800,2,1417,4.859504132231405

1196534,5,B000007NTY,"This 1955 sex farce is a classic that put Swedish director Ingmar Bergman on the map.
  Frequently compared to Shakespeare's ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"", and the inspiration for Stephen Sondheim's musical, ""A Little Night Music"", this film depicts the shifting romantic interests among a group of upper-class Swedes and their servants in the early 20th century.
  A comically nonplussed Gunnar Bjornstrand, whose moustache and beard, quite interestingly, and rather symbolically encase his mouth in the shape of an upside-down heart, leads the cast in the role of Frederick Egerman, a widowered attorney with a very young second wife named Anne( Ulla Jacobson), a tormented son from his first marriage, a theology student who is in his early twenties named Henrik(Bjorn Bjelvenstam), and a former mistress, the actress Desiree Armfeldt(Eva Dahlbeck), whom he and his  young wife are to watch in a play on the evening on which the story begins.
  Anne, who has not consummated her union even after two years of marriage, is upset upon seeing Desiree onstage, as she had earlier heard her husband calling out Desiree's name while he was caressing her earlier that day, and demands to go home early.
  Afterwards, Frederick reunites with his former ladylove backstage, and the soon make a jaunt over to her house, accompanied by her maid(Gull Natorp). Frederick falls into a puddle at the entrance of the house to Desiree's great amusement, and ends up in the nightclothes of Desiree's current love, the married military officer Count Carl Magnus Malcolm(Jarl Kulle) as his clothes are drying. The Count shows up and to Desiree's further amusement, gives a tactful sense of disapproval of Frederick's presence there.
 Another presence there, which baffles Frederick even more is a little fellow who is also named Frederick(Anders Wulff) clad in his own nightgown, who is lovingly tucked in bed by his mother, who refuses to disclose the child's paternity, although it seems more than obvious.
 At Frederick's house, the would-be Lutheran minister Henrik has slipped into a moment of moral turpitude with his father's young maid, Petra(Harriet Andersson), who is approximately Anne's age, and the two young ladies gigglingly share confidences together, although the cook, Beata(Jullen Kindhal) expresses her disapproval of  Petra's vampish behavior. Henrik has alternately read Martin Luther's works to Petra, and condemned her for being a sinful woman.
 Soon after, the despairing Countess Charlotte(Margit Carlquist), the wife of Count Malcolm, visits Anne, and reveals her anguish over the behavior of the man she still loves.
 In the meantime, Desiree visits her mother(Naima Wilstrand) at her estate, and gains permission to host a get-together between herself, and the principals of this story.
 Noteworthy during this occasion  is the promiscuous Petra's attraction to the groomsman, Frid(Ake Fridell), and also Henrik's suicidal despair, which may be reflective of Bergman's own sentiment at the time he wrote this piece as an alternative to his own self-destruction.
 Amid an evening of intrigue, decadence, and humor, we shall learn what Henrik's choice will be as those involved will be rightfully paired off with each other--upside-down hearts being turned right-side up, as an amiable servant reflects on the smiles of a summer night.
 To quote Shakepeare, who may have indirectly inspired this piece, ""All's well that ends well!'",1381708800,2,3439,5.348794063079778
1196535,5,B000007NTY,"Bergman, Ingmar. Smiles of a Summer Night. (1955) The Criterion Collection.
Gunnar Bjornstrand, Eva Dahlbeck, Ulla Jacobsson, Harriet Andersson, etc.

Here's a film that's fifty-eight years old now. It's shot entirely in black and white and has to be watched with subtitles, unless you're fluent in Swedish. To top it off, it's set in turn of the century Sweden, not the turn of this century but a century ago. Yet it brims with life, and is an absolute pleasure to watch.

It was crowned at Cannes in 1956 -Grand Prize for Best Comedy--and its success made Bergman as a director. Everyone in Sweden who was involved in films knew that Bergman was a genius but Sweden was a relatively insular community back then and all of Bergman's films had been too dark to win him an audience outside of his home country. His success at Cannes made Bergman a sellable commodity abroad and he used the leverage of his success to move on to a series of standout dramas. First was The Seventh Seal (1956). That was for most Americans the first movie seen of Bergman. It was after Seal and The Virgin Spring and Wild Strawberries that we noticed Bergman's earlier works.

Smiles of a Summer Night is a comedy. Comedy's not something one routinely associates with Bergman but actually, he's done a couple of good ones across his life as film director -The Devil's Eye in 1960 and his filming of Mozart's The Magic Flute in 1975. There is the often comic first half of Fanny and Alexander (1983). And when he does comedy, he does it as well as he does his more somber stuff. His eye for scenes is exquisite, he works well with actors (one of the best at this), and his comedies are at once playful, thoughtful and somewhere behind the laughter, elegiac and a little bit sad.

This movie is about a group of lovers and would-be lovers, mostly bourgeois, whose affections are ... elsewhere... than with their legitimate mates. Fredrik Egerman is late middle-aged and married to a nineteen-year-old child -they've been married fro two years and Anne's still virgin. Fredrik's son by his first marriage, Henrik, is studying to be a minister but lust for father's new wife is slowly but steadily beating out Martin Luther in his thoughts. Fredrik has a former mistress, an aging but still radiant stage actress named Desiree. Desiree's current is an army officer, Count Carl-Magnus. The Count's wife, Charlotte, is best friends with Anne.  Fredrik, frustrated by his inability to consummate his marriage to his child-bride, goes out one night to see Desiree. He meets her at the theater, gores back to her apartment with her, but falls in a puddle and ends up dressed in a frilly nightshirt and a robe -both garments are the Count's. The Count shows up and the Great Dance begins: Fredrik and Anne and Henrik and Desiree and Carl-Magnus and Charlotte, until all end up with the mates they should have had in the beginning, and with the kinds of love they can tolerate. Around this dance is another, of the maid Petra and her lover, the coachman Frid, which is conducted with no reserve at all and a great deal more apparent pleasure. The contrast between the earthy Petra and Frid and their enervated and confused masters is a motif of the film.

There's a good deal of the feeling though not the storyline of A Midsummer's Night Dream in here and when you watch Woody Allen's homage to Bergman, A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy, you'll recognize affinities.

What are the pleasures of this extraordinary movie? A sophisticated and civilized plot line that doesn't detract at all from the comedy. A steady pacing that allows you to savor each scene as it unfolds and doesn't try to shove it in your face as too many movies, especially comedies, do nowadays. Superb acting by an ensemble that even at that early stage in his career was shaping up as Bergman's film family. Bjornstrand and Dahlbeck especially deserve praise. The filming: in one of the two interviews that are packaged along with the film, a critic comments on the masterful use of light in the film -the dappling in the forest scenes, the flood of white in sky and field -he says that no movie has ever used white so well as this one. The sheer intelligence of the film. The dialogue, for instance, is so good --funny, revealing....

Definitely a thinking-persons' film where the comedy is more properly described as wit... Don't get this one if you aren't able to give it your undivided attention--you have to stick with the story in order to follow along, but it is well worth it if you do....

1196538,4,B000007NTY,"This is a fun, beautifully filmed movie.  It's not a side-splitting comedy--it's an Ignmar Bergman comedy, so you will get a healthy dose of pathos, existential philosophy, and you will even confront death (I think Bergman confronts death in like every single one of his movies. It's probably one of his only constants!)  That said, things resolve happily enough in the end...thus making it a true comedy in the Shakespearean sense.  The humor is subtle, but it's there.  It's really more of an easy-going pastoral than anything else.  It's sort of a Seventh Seal or Wild Strawberries, but with a much lighter touch.

Ultimately it's not my favorite Bergman as I prefer his darker stuff like Persona, Cries and Whispers, and Hour of the Wolf, but it's a fine movie in its own right, if not as intense as some of his others movies.",1347148800,,830,4.729166666666667

Smiles Of A Summer Night is not laugh-out-loud comedy, but rather one that will keep a smile on your face throughout. Bergman might well have been inspired by A Midsummer Night's Dream: ""What fools these mortals be,"" as he recounts the foibles and follies of his characters as they stumble along until they finally end up with the partners they should have started out with.

1196543,5,B000007NTY,"Ingmar Bergman is among my favorite international directors.  I love that the vast majority of his films have been lovingly restored and presented by Criterion films.  Among my favorites of his is Smiles of a Summer Night.  It is a slightly more upbeat and lighthearted film than most Bergman's.  Which is not to say that this is all fun and giggles.  There is a bit of a dark undercurrent, mainly in the interaction of the main characters.  The servants add a bit of quirky romantic comedy on the side as well.

What it boils down to is a convoluted story at first glance, but one told so well and so richly, that the viewer is never confused.  Basically middle aged guy marries young woman but they don't consummate the marriage because she loves her husband's son from his first marriage.  His rival, the Count (a wonderful performance by Jarl Kulle) is having an affair with an actress who previously had an affair with the middle aged guy between his marriages, oh and she incidentally has a young son with the same name as the middle aged guy.  And they seem to still be pining for one another, and the Count finds out, and well... misunderstandings can occur when the middle aged guy (Fredrik) ends up at the actress' house wearing the Count's nightshirt and the Count arrives.

The story moves from the city to the countryside for some wonderful scenes with the slightly crazy mother of Desiree (the actress).  There is a wonderful scene where the elder lady sits in her chair across the table from the other 5 guests, in a very large chair, almost as if she is conducting court.  There is also a scene near the end involving Russian roulette... but without giving anything away, it is still a fun and lighthearted film that never really crosses into the terribly dark realms that Bergman was so known for exploring.

The transfer to Blu-Ray was handled magically with Criterion's well tested methods.  The audio is uncompressed monaural and is fit nicely to the shots (not slightly off time like many restored audio tracks).

There are tons of extras: the usual audio commentary, a brief intro to the film by Bergman, and a nice booklet with an essay included.  It's pretty standard Criterion extras, not one of the more noted collections of extras by them... But the film is wonderful and well restored, so it's worth every penny in my opinion!

Also please note:  If the third party sellers get greedy, then you can always check Criterion's website for films.  I ran across a couple of Criterion films not being offered directly from amazon and the third party sellers were charging at least 3 times what you could buy it for from Criterion.

1196544,5,B000007NTY,"Enchanting comedy of errors from legendary director Ingmar Bergman.  One of Bergman's early films, this will come as a revelation to those familiar only with his stark, often surrealistic later works.

A group of well-to-do Swedes and their servants converge on a country house for a summer weekend of fun and games.  Husbands, wives, sons and lovers pair off in various combinations under the spell of the midnight sun.

Bergman examines sexual mores and the complexity of human relationships with warmth and sympathy.  He skillfully steers these likable, if sometimes pompous characters, through the treacherous waters of romance.  The script is brilliant, always witty, often laugh-out-loud funny.  The film is stunningly designed and beautifully photographed in glorious black-and-white.

The entire cast is superb, with top honors going to the gorgeous Eva Dahlbeck, playing an actress who serves as the catalyst to get things moving.

This one is a must for fans of Bergman, foreign language film enthusiasts, and anyone who enjoys romantic, mature comedy.",1311465600,,1062,5.426829268292683

It's a romp, a meditation on the unpredictability of life and emotions, a tribute both to perseverance and to capriciousness.  The performances are flawless: engaging, complex, simultaneously light and profound.

It will make you wish Bergman had made more comedies: I've never seen another comedy that accomplishes this level of depth and vivacity, with pits of despair danced over, landing in a glorious, life-affirming ending.",1305590400,12,576,5.366666666666666

1196548,5,B000007NTY,"This is one of my favorite films, well presented by Criterion.  It is an early Ingmar Bergman effort, and the characters don't show the depth that his later creations showed.  This may have been intentional, as it is a comedy of manners made for a people (the Swedes) who admire directness and propriety.  The problem the characters have is that the men start the movie with the wrong women.  The women will sort this all out with a variety of bumps and smiles along the way.  The men will end up wiser and the women happier.

It is an amusing movie rather than a side-splitter.  There are some clever lines, especially from Mrs. Armfeldt (wonderful as a wise dowager).  The women are beautiful, with Ulla Jacobsson and Harriet Andersson particularly so.  The contrast between them is fascinating, particularly in their relationship and actions with young Henrik Egerman.  At times wife and maid swap roles, then swap back again.

Swapping happens throughout the film.  Father/husband Fredrik Egerman begins the film as a respected lawyer, very sure of himself, and worldly wise (he thinks).  Testosterone-laden soldier Count Carl Magnus Malcolm begins in love with renown actress Desiree Armfeldt and barely tolerating his wife.  The film and the women send them on a journey, and it is a pleasure to follow them.

1196549,4,B000007NTY,"In the Scandanavian countries, Midsummer Night, when the sun does not set for days, and the world seems lit by a osy or golden glow, is a time of revelry and sexual abandon.  There's a great Stindberg play, MISS JULIE that takes place on a Midsummer night.  A fine movie of the play was made in the 50s, and is well worth seeing.  This original story was filmed roughly at the same time as MISS JULIE, and is written to take place at roughly the same time; that is, the 1880s - 90s, at end of the 19th century.  This film is called one of Bergman's few Romantic Comedies.  It is, if you consider that it takes place a a time when romance as we know it at the  beginning of the 21st Century, was unknown.  Marriages were generally or at least often, maters of financial arrangement between families.  Romance, then, consisted of flights of erotic fancy between ponderous volumes of sexual domesticity; or, to put it more frankly, Romance had more to do with the excitement of adultery than anything else, and was a form of enertainment given to upper-middle class people and to aristocrats.  The European way.

At a time when the world's management definitely belonged solely o ostensibly intelligent men, such men were expected to be deftly manipulated by clever women.  And this film is a celebratin of that fact.

All the actors are good, and some exceptionally so.  The scenario was brilliantly written and filled with a superabundance of sometimes exquisite, but often brual irony.  The direction is beyond criticism, like the cinematography, the sets and the lighting.  SMILES was filmed in silvery, expressive black and white.  There are stylisic elements of Jean Renoir and Josef von Sternberg films, but they are unobtrusive.

Woody Allen is supposed to have said after first viewing of this film, ""It was the most fun I've ever had without sex.""  Understandable.

This movie ought to be reserved for viewing by mature people; by those who have been around the block a few times and/or undergone at least one marriage.  I mean people who know what it means to be tempted to cheat, whether or not they ever submitted to that temptation, for they would best appreciate both the comic and the dramatic nature of the situations.  Experienced men and women are best equipped to appreciate this gladiator's struggle against convention.

Does it strike you too as ironic that at a time when the news is occupied with disputes about the legitimacy or lack thereof, in Gay marriage, that a raffish celebrity is quoted as having said:  ""If they want it, why shouldn't they be allowed to share in our misery?""  Should the sanctity of adultery be kept for sexually orthodox heterosexuals?  Ah, things you can't explain, really.",1229644800,,2723,4.779443254817987
1196550,3,B000007NTY,"An immoral, sexually obsessed troupe: some kind of religious sect of wackos  la Sweden try to find love and live-fulfillment but they look for it in sex -changing and exchanging sex partners in order to find the combination that does the trick, and alas! it fails. A parody of the absurd ""make love, not war"" 60's-old  sentiment.

It could well be read as I did above, however, here's another alternative.

Fathre/son dialogue (The libertine father and the soon to be cleryman son): ""Man loves himself, his self-love, and his love of love itself."" (Father dixit). On sex: ""-Fortunately, women don't take it half as seriously as we do. Otherwise the human race would die out."" (At the rate they are aborting today, for sure). -You joke about everything. -You will too when you see your own foolishness.

Father and son represent opposite world/life views. Clearly Bergman prefers the father figure over the old morals, customs and must-nots of the clery and religious minded, who are depicted as ignorant, frustrated, angry and pitiful creatures.

But then the libertine father meets his ""artistic"" lover. He asks her to please tell him that his 18 year-old wive Anne is either a ""hopeless case or the opposite"", meaning is she ever going to grow up and love him as a man-husband, instead of the father figure she sees in him, a man who rescued her from her innocent family life. The lover wants to know what he'll give her for the info. He offers hre his religious minded son as a sexual pet. She says no. Then pearls are offered, but she has enough. Whith a smile he says she'll be rewarded in heaven. And this time she reacts in anger (like he'd just mentioned a taboo word): ""-I want my reward in this life!"" What rings the bell to me is the violent reaction, which obviosly means something strongly for Bergman.

Why would she react like that? Because she knows there's no heaven for her? or because, literally, she wants her reward now? I'd say the fact of his mentioning heaven must have played some part in the violence of her reaction (as compared to the other 2 offers), or otherwise she would have simply rejected it likewise.

So there are very strong feelings held on religious issues as heaven. We see this ""comic"" confrontation of points of view on these issues and characters vrey clearly. And ""comic"" isn't the most appropriate word to define this film, a sad satire rather. In fact tears and sadness are all about the place.

The 4 main characters are very different. The young wive is a pure heart, sexually and mentally still a child, opposite of her husband's lover, an adult woman expert in knowing what she wants and how to barter to get it. Of course Anne, the wive, so young as she is doesn't even know she ""should"" want the same things the lover does. Alas, innocence. And Bergman assumes that in time she will come to want them indeed, but the husband wants her to find out by herself.

The points of view on these issues: sex, moral values, religion, are the core of the story. It's the two libertine characters who do the judging of the other two sexually deprived ones. When I say judging I mean they consider themselves the wiser ones, they know things the other two don't. The son and the wive, poor things, they don't any better, it seems to say. Is Bergman Freudian? It's pretty clear that the film depicts people who have scruples about sexual relations as considered either social inferiors, or physically undeveloped, or plain fundamentalist wackos. Immoral people seem to be the rightish kind of people for the modern world. Getting to see things as Bergman sees them is a game of engineering perversion played on the mind, devilish and with the European touch of distinction.

Wait, there's more. Bergman isn't just ridiculing Christian moral values, that would be preaching against preaching. He tosses in the hypocrisy of the bourgeoisie as well. Funny how the aristocracy seems to get scot free always in this socialist films when they live as magnificently as the rich depicted here. Hypocrisy we have, yes: ""-You are not ifit to have a child"" says the libertine husband to his lover. And she slaps him indignantly, of course, since she also has her pride. So we find out that the unfaithful husband is not the heroe of the story. Of the two, the real dignified character seems to be the ""artistic"" go-getter lover. She is not a hypocrite about her profession, so that makes her a dignified prostitute.

I personally prefer Buuel's films to Bergman's. Buuel is a brute, an insulting, unsentimental, finger-in-the-eye sort of fellow. He'll make fun of what he despises (the hypocrisy of Catholics) so blatantly that you got to laugh with him. But Bergman is another class. More subtle. He takes the upper hand like the self-righteous leftist media does by showing first the starving black children of Africa, and then rich Wall Street brokers.

But going back to the lover, and as a way to finish, does she really do well? After all she is the loneliest character. And everyone can see she really wants to be in the young wive's shoes. Does Bergman want to make fools of ALL his chatacters? and go out scots free? Impossible. In that case he would make a fool of himself.",1221868800,2,5212,4.695509309967141

It would be a couple of years before The Seventh Seal and Wild Strawberries cemented his reputation as an international film auteur, but looking back on this film, over a half a century later, and half a world away, it only shows how differently tastes in humor can be. Compared to today's better film comedies, this film is both more mature and more puerile in its approach to sex, in that it treats its characters as intellectual beings, yet also shows them as somehow reserved. Granted, the film is set in turn of the 20th Century Sweden, yet there is still an element missing in the film, especially when compared to later films in the Bergman canon. That missing element would most likely be depth.
  Yes, compared to even more `intellectual' Hollywood comedies of recent vintage, like Sideways, Smiles Of A Summer Night is far deeper, but there is truth to the old Woody Allen claim that drama is `sitting at the grown ups table'. In fact, Allen was so smitten with this film that he tried to do his own version of it a quarter century later, in A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy. Of course, his own film was one of Allen's lesser works. Yet, so too is this film one of Bergman's lesser works. Stephen Sondheim also based his musical, A Little Night Music, on this film. The camera work, by Bergman's first collaborating cinematographer, Gunnar Fischer, is stellar, especially in the interior scenes, where the whites radiate like novae in comparison to the pitch hues, but the film is at its weakest in the characterizations. No, unlike most modern fiction in film or prose, it is not a failure for its reliance on the trite, but for its simple lack of detail. The viewer is never drawn into the characterizations nor dilemmas of the main protagonists. This is certainly a flaw that dogs most comedies. Even the comedies of William Shakespeare are notably deficient in this area- most especially his appropriately wretched A Midsummer Night's Dream. Yet, even though this is the only real failure of the film, it is enough to make this a rather tepid viewing experience, especially for the refined Bergmaniac.",1221696000,,2254,4.821705426356589
1196552,4,B000007NTY,"""Smiles of a Summer Night"" was Bergman's last chance.  He'd been making films for a decade, and none of them had been a commercial success.  His backers were fed up.  Unexpectedly, though, ""Smiles"" was both a box office and critical hit, and immediately afterwards Bergman got the go-ahead to make ""The Seventh Seal.""  The rest is history.

""Smiles"" is a very good film, although it has its flaws.  It's a bit too long, for example.  The first half could've been edited more closely.  The musical score, moreover, is syrupy, as only 1950s cinematic scores can be.

On the other hand, the script is good, alternating between genuinely funny lines and darker, more ambivalent ones.  The characters and situation are comic at one level, but this is definitely not your typical bedroom farce.  Throughout the film run themes of loneliness and unfulfilled yearning to love and be loved, fear of aging and losing one's sexual attractiveness, the tension between our interiors and the public masks we don, and the transience of affection--staples of Bergman's films.  As one of the characters says, ""most of us have neither the gift nor the punishment of love""; another laments that ""one can't protect another from any kind of suffering.  That's what makes one so weary.""  And in the monologue about the three smiles of a summer night, the first smile, enjoyed by those who love innocently, is acknowledged to be rare and fleeting.

The acting is superb, with laurels going to Harriet Andersson's Petra, the frankly sensual serving maid to Fredrek Egerman (Gunnar Bjornstrand), and Eva Dahlbeck's Desiree Armfeldt, the worldly actress who engineers the summer weekend of the film's second half.  Jarl Kulle's foppish but dangerous Count Carl Magnus Malcolm is also memorable.  Ake Fridell as Frid, the life-celebrating coachman who woos Petra, is excellent. Although his role is small, it's pivotal.  Bergman gives him the final say, literally and figuratively.

The Criterion edition includes a fascinating dialogue between the film scholar Peter Cowie and Joern Donner, Swedish actor and producer, as well as a short introduction by Bergman himself in which he reveals that he learned that ""Smiles"" had been recognized at Cannes while reading a newspaper in the john.",1218326400,,2262,5.114441416893733
1196553,5,B000007NTY,"***** 1955. Written and directed by Ingmar Bergman. A prize (Best Poetic Humor!) at Cannes and the Bergman phenomenon started at that moment. This film is a romantic comedy opposing women and men or rather life and death. In SMILES OF A SUMMER NIGHT, men are clearly related to death, just observe the lawyer Egerman playing Russian roulette or his son Henrik trying to commit suicide. Women, on the contrary, are described as solar, filled with life, by the Swedish master. Yes! Such serious and dark themes can be found in this pseudo light comedy which is already in your library if you like cinema.

1196554,5,B000007NTY,"This film inaugurated Bergman's remarkably productive period from the mid-50s to the early 70's when he produced an amazing number of outstanding films.  A complex romantic comedy with strong farcial elements, Smiles of A Summer Night is quite different from most of Bergman's great films, though there are humorous elements in Wild Strawberries.  Quite a few have compared Smiles to A Midsummer's Night's Dream, and this is appropriate.  The theme of Smiles, the nature of love, is truly Shakespearean, as is the use of the intersecting plot lines and combination of irony and low comedy.  As is typical for Bergman, the acting is superb, including a couple of actors seen repeatedly in Bergman films, Gunnar Bjornstrand and Harriet Andersson.  As is also typical for Bergman, there are a number of interesting and unusually well acted female roles.

1196556,5,B000007NTY,"Bergman, that great master artist of melancholy, smiles here, and the world smiled with him.  SMILES OF A SUMMER NIGHT was hugely successful in its original release -- the money it made gave Bergman the artistic license to make some of his darker films.  For today's audiences, it's probably more familiar in its musical incarnation as Sondheim's A LITTLE NIGHT MUSIC, and that's a pity. SMILES is one of the screen's greatest comedies, a work to be compared to the classics of Moliere and Mozart, both in structure and in tone.  Marvellous performances from the entire cast, with Eva Dahlbeck a particular delight as Desiree.  The usual wonderful Criterion transfer here.  For sheer romantic pleasure, this one's hard to beat.",1182384000,,727,5.025
1196557,5,B000007NTY,"A romantic comedy by Ingmar Bergman?  Well, yes, sort of, as in The Human Comedy, rife with sharp observations about the living mystery of love, the necessity for the pursuit of the ephemeral while equally acknowledging the absurdity of the whole enterprise.  Acerbic, witty and wise, this beautiful film has all the trappings of French farce with everyone in the beginning either married or otherwise involved with the wrong person and in the end love triumphant and balance restored. Of course, this is Sweden's Bergman telling the tale and that means a dour, skeptical, and near pessimistic view of our follies.  And yet, in the end even the morose Swede has to yield to the ever surprising power of the never-completely-down Midsummer sun and the ever renewing and uplifting joy of human love.

The inspiration for other works, notably Sondheim's ""A Little Night Music"" and Woody Allen's ""A Misummer Night's Sex Comedy"", this is a gem of a film.  As Sondheim's ""Send in the Clowns"" so deftly told of how love can go awry by bad timing, or missed opportunity, and as J.Geils more bluntly put it in ""Love Stinks"", Bergman here examines the yearning for what one wants, while missing what one needs, and the mismatches and misery that can follow from that.  Ah, but there is the Midsummer Night smiling.  Anyone who has ever been in Scandinavia in Midsommer will know how intense and alive with possibility the never dark days can be. Ah yes, and love will out.  Meanwhile, ""the clowns will have coffee in the kitchen"".  Amen.",1179014400,2,1527,4.819923371647509
1196558,5,B000007NTY,"""Smiles of a Summer Night"" is one of the most elegant and charming carnal comedies ever filmed. It is clever, witty, and incredibly sexy. Did I mention that it was written and directed by The Ingmar Bergman whose name would not usually be associated with the comedies?

""Smiles of a Summer Night"" was a great success with both the critics and the audiences and was submitted for the Cannes film festival...without its creator's knowledge. The film was nominated for the Golden Palm and won the Award for Best Poetic Humor. Bergman describes how he found out about his movie's international recognition, ""I was sitting on the toilet reading a morning newspaper. One of the articles was entitled, The Great Victory for a Swedish Cinema at Cannes. I thought, what a wonderful news, what is the movie? And then I read the title, ""Smiles of a Summer Night"" by Ingmar Bergman."" He recalls how poor he was then and he borrowed the money for a ticket to Cannes from Bibi Anderson whom he dated at the time.

I did not laugh a lot but I don't think I was supposed to - ""Smiles... is a different kind of comedy, sensual and subtle, with the characters often weak but not ridiculous. The beauty of it is in the dialogs, ironic looks, the charming struggle of wits, and in the realization that not everyone will be blessed with the true and passionate love but the life goes on, anyway. The actresses (Ulla Jacobsson, Eva Dahlbeck, Harriet Andersson, and Margit Carlqvist) were incredibly sexy, especially Eva Dahlbeck smoking a cigar and Harriett Andersson as a chambermaid talking to her mistress about the virginity - delightful!

There are no words to describe the beauty, splendor, charm, humor, and sensuality of this film. The best I can do - to paraphrase Woody Allen's line -""that was the most fun I've ever had without sex.""",1150329600,6,1822,4.723270440251572
1196559,4,B000007NTY,"The title Smiles of a Summer Night refers to couples eventually finding happiness at the end of this intelligent comedy.  There are several couples involved, but you aren't sure who will end up with who until the end.  Will the man end up with his wife or with somebody else?  And if he doesn't end up with his wife, who will get her?

The female characters are much stronger, much wiser, than the males, with one exception, the chubby male servant.

The other three male characters are the prim lawyer, the lawyer's uptight son who is studying for the clergy, and the tough soldier.  All three are nincompoops.

The female characters are the lawyer's young wife, the accomplished actress, the soldier's wife, and the flirtatious maid, not to mention the actress's elderly and very sharp mother.

You would think that four men and four women would result in four couples, but there are more than four couples.

The lawyer has a potential connection with all four women.  His son connects to both the maid and his stepmother, daddy's young bride.  The soldier is involved with the actress as well as his own wife.  Only the male servant is confined to one woman, the maid, but he's the only guy having a good time.  And there's another potential couple, judging by the hugging, kissing and giggling going on between the young bride and her maid.

I'll open the door slightly to the plot without giving any answers away.  The lawyer has not yet had sex with his young bride, though they have been married a long enough time.  She doesn't seem to want it.  The successful actress used to be the lawyer's mistress, but she dumped him years ago when she gave up on ever getting him to marry her.  She has a son with, coincidentally, the same first name as the lawyer.  But she is currently the mistress of the soldier.  The lawyer is too thick to realize that yes, obviously, the little boy is his son.

The story is entertaining but the artistry in the writing, directing, acting, lighting, is more entertaining.  There's a happy ending, but you knew that already by the title.  It's a silly little comedy done extremely well, a 3 star story done in a 5 star way.",1149724800,,2159,4.579634464751958

I won't even attempt to explain the story, it's too confusing - in a romantic screwball kind of way - but lets just say a rich upper class lawyer has a young wife whom he doesn't love.  He loves an ex-girlfriend but she has a married boyfriend and the married boyfriend's wife is friends with the lawyer's young wife.  Also the lawyer's son is in love with his step-mother but doesn't know it.  Oh, I nearly forgot about the sexy maid and the older jolly butler guy.  It's all very amusing and it just gets better as it goes.  The final act, which takes place with all of the players on a weekend retreat together, is quite comical.  I especially loved the backfiring car!  I rewound that scene at least five times.",1145404800,3,920,4.3023255813953485

A film that deserves all the honors.",1140480000,,359,4.774193548387097
1196562,5,B000007NTY,"Fredrick Egerman (Gunnar Bjornstrand) is a forty-something lawyer of precise calculation, a bit of a dandy among the mercantile.  He has a young wife Anne (the very pretty Ulla Jacobsson) whom he married when she was sixteen, but somehow never got around to unintacting her virgo. He has a sometime mistress Desire Armfeldt (the voluptuous Eva Dahlbeck) from whom he has recently been estranged.  He has a son Henrik (Bjorn Bjelvenstam) full of angst and love's confusion who lusts after the saucy maid Petra (a blonde Harriet Andersson) while he studies theology and his father's wife.

The night for Fredrick and Anne (after a Platonic nap during which Fredrick inadvertently pronounces Desire's name) begins with the theater; and who should be starring in the production but Desire.  Anne suddenly takes ill and they rush home.  Fredrick now steals away to see Desire.  After a pratfall in some water he ends up in some night clothes that belong to Desire's current lover, the militaristic Count Malcolm (Jarl Kulle as a sprung-steel bantam) who, as it happens, arrives upon the scene much to the merriment of Desire and to the embarrassment of Fredrick.

The culmination of love's labors and intrigues takes place at the chateau of Desire's mother, Mrs. Armfeldt (Naima Wifstrand).  The action includes a most amusing duel, some hanky-panky atop a haystack, musical beds, an attempted suicide, some Chateau Mouton-Rothschild (if I caught the label right), the amorous kiss of young lovers, the triumph of the fairer sex, and the very proper lawyer's final humiliation.

If you haven't seen Smiles of a Summer Night you are in for a rare treat: a comedy by Ingmar Bergman.  And it is no ordinary comedy.  Shakespearean and Oscar Wilde-like in its sharp, satirical (and oh so worldly wise) dialogue, this playful romp with the Swedish landed gentry and servants of a hundred years ago is a delight that will satisfy the most sophisticated viewer as well as the most middlebrow.

Owing something to the French farcical tradition (in particular Molire), to light opera (maybe Mozart), and even the Greek theater, Bergman's romantic comedy sparkles with love's intrigues and pratfalls.  According to Pauline Kael, whose review is part of a 24-page booklet that comes with the Criterion Collection DVD, Bergman had just finished directing a stage production of The Merry Widow which accounts in part for the fin-de-sicle setting and the genteel treatment that he finally settled upon for his comedy of manners.  Also I think this examination and satire of the class structure with hilarious asides on the foibles of human nature owes something to Oscar Wilde's The Importance of Being Ernest which was set in approximately the same time period and had a similar cast of characters including a Grand Dame, an ingenue, some rustics, a clergyman, but most directly in the fact that both Wilde and Bergman aim their sardonic wit directly at the burghers and the bourgeois.  Bohemians need not apply.  Indeed the closest thing to a Bohemian in the play is the actress Desire who is the very calculating and dominate personage of the film.

By the way, Bergman's future protege, Bibi Andersson, does appear in this movie, but only for a moment as an actress on stage at the theater.

The final, cynical bemusement comes as one reconsiders who ends up with whom.  Not to spoil the plot, but notice that in every case there is something less than perfect in each romantic partnership, something slightly amiss that may cause problems down the road, something unsettled that suggests that nothing has really changed.  As the French say, the more things change, the more they remain the same.  It is this ironic underpinning to this delightful comedy that lends to it something of the timeless.  Bergman is good at that.",1137888000,5,3808,5.001584786053883
1196563,5,B000007NTY,"Set around the year 1900, the movie takes place from midnight to dawn of a particular summer day. The smiles are three in number and represent three ways of looking at love.

The first involves an older man, Fredrik Egerman, who has married a much younger woman, Anne - still a virgin after two years. Egerman's son, Henrik, runs away with her, leaving the older man alone and depressed (that's the third look, which occurs as the sun is rising). Anne's veil that blows off her head as she's being driven away by her young lover and which is recovered by Egerman speaks volumes.

The second look, which occurs during the darkest period of the night just before dawn, is the most cynical, and involves Count Malcolm and his wife Charlotte. No misty-eyed declarations of never dying love here, but bare honesty - but revealed in the exaggerated form of the great satirists/comedians, almost Bierceian in its savage humor, but at the same time done lightly within a c'est la vie attitude.

Bergman has created a beautiful comedy, set in a time long ago when social positions, especially of the sexes, were clearly defined. Yet the women here have the upper hand and the men, especially Egerman, act the fools. But Egerman is not just a fool, but a suffering human being as well. In that representation lies Bergman's genius - a genius that affects us on very deep levels. A great movie.",1128556800,,1383,4.683127572016461

It's so well played and scripted that you could probably identify with more than one of the wildly varying characters.

1196567,4,B000007NTY,"I concur with all of the above gentlemen's review except I take issue with one important detail: although the plot of this film DOES seem to slightly resemble Woody Allen's ""A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy,"" Allen claims that his film is NOT based on the Bergman film, and that it is an erroneous notion (set forth by a newspaper columnist) that exists to this day.  To quote Allen himself in Eric Lax's fine biography, ""[Smiles of a Summer Night] is one of the very, very few of Bergman's that I wasn't crazy about. . .it's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.  There's no resemblance between the two"" (Woody Allen, Lax, pp. 313-314).

This Bergman film stands on its own merits.  And yes, it IS the basis for the Sondheim musical, ""A Little Night Music,"" although I think this film, with its haunting images of rural summer peccadillos, is the better execution.

Admittedly, Allen invokes Bergman in several of films, figuratively, as in the homage to ""Wild Strawberries"" in the film ""Crimes and Misdemeanors,"" when Judah returns to his family dining room and ""observes"" his family's behavior from over 50 years ago, and literally, in his repeated use of Bergman cinematographer Sven Nyquist.",1092960000,2,1191,4.876237623762377
1196568,5,B000007NTY,"I came to Ingmar Bergman films in the mid-sixties, as a teen, and liked them because they seemed so stark, so unlike the typical Hollywood fluff. They called 'em art films, but I liked Bergman because of the characters and the stories, not to mention the look and feel of his films. It was only when Criterion Collection released SMILES OF A SUMMER NIGHT this year that I finally got to see a film I had heard a lot about but never bothered to seek out. Criterion's other Bergman films were all must-haves so I ordered Smiles right away.  (I have seen Sondheim's A Little Night Music on stage some three times and saw the film, so I suppose this Bergman source film seemed less unknown than his others. And, by the way, after seeing  Smiles, I appreciate even more how nicely Sondheim et al adapted this film.) True to Criterion's high standards and TLC in presenting its films, Smiles looks as good as it must have when it was released almost fifty years ago.  This light comedy involves several pairs of lovers who, for a variety of reasons, might be better off if the deck were shuffled and they ended up in another pairing.  Aging actress, married lover; aging lawyer, too-young virgin wife; tortured soul son of lawyer, saucy maid temptress, and lawyer's too-young virgin wife; wife of military man who knows husband has mistresses, including the aging actress.  Shuffle the deck a few times and a lot can happen in a movie with characters such as these. Sondheim wrote the entire score to A Little Night Music in waltz tempo, which perfectly captures the whirling intricacies of the relationships.  Bergman started it all with a very entertaining and perfectly cast film, full of both comedy and the human dimension of mismatched people who may be investing too much energy in the wrong person. It all sounds confusing, but, trust me, you'll enjoy the heck out of this picture.  If you think Bergman is just The Silence, Cries and Whispers and Winter Light, you're in for a real treat with SMILES OF A SUMMER NIGHT.",1092182400,12,2021,4.660112359550562
1196569,5,B000007NTY,"Ingmar Bergman directed a romantic comedy when he filmed Smiles of a Summer Night that is as playful as Shakespeare's A Midsummer Nights Dream and is set in a small scale backdrop of Renoir's Rules of the Game (1939).  Despite the similarities of other stories Bergman creates a unique comedy that is full of conspiring intrigue as it revolves around a small number of characters at the turn of the century in a small Swedish town.

Fredrik Egerman (Gunnar Bj&ouml;rnstrand), a successful middle-aged lawyer and former widower, has remarried with Anne (Ulla Jacobsson) who is at least twenty years younger than him.  Fredrik's son, Henrik (Bj&ouml;rn Bjelfvenstam), from his previous marriage, is of the same age as Anne and has recently arrived home from completing his theological examinations.  Petra, the family maid, flirts with Henrik as he expresses his liking for the opposite sex.  As a consequence, Henrik is struggling with an overwhelming inner guilt originating from his incapability to live by his lofty values stemming from his Christian faith.  In addition, the prominent actress Desiree Armfeldt (Eva Dahlbeck), a previous lover to Fredrik, is performing at the town theater.  Fredrik makes nightly visit to Desiree which puts him in harms way as Desiree's current lover, Carl Magnus (Jarl Kulle), a military officer known for his success in duels visits at the same time.  However, this is just the beginning for all the predicaments that Fredrik is about to experience.
Smiles of a Summer Night is a well-written comedy with several subplots that drive the main theme, love, forward as it displays Bergman's wide range of story telling.  Bergman displays a simple story which becomes complex as the characters are continually dishonest.  It is the profound level of deceitfulness in the story that produces intrigue and brings about the comedy.  As the final scene fades away in memory, the audience has gone through a first class cinematic experience that will lighten and enlighten those who participated.",1087344000,4,2026,5.184049079754601
1196570,4,B000007NTY,"The first time I saw ""Smiles of a Summer Night"" I thought is was an OK film, nothing more, nothing less. I was use to seeing the powerful, bleak, gritty dramas such as ""Shame"", ""The Seventh Seal"", ""Wild Strawberries"", and ""A Passion of Anna"". ""Smiles"" was entertaining, but not memorable. It just didn't have the lasting power those other films had.
 I have now seen the film again. And while maybe it is true this movie does not have the lasting power Bergman's other films have, that does not mean you shouldn't see it.
 ""Smiles of a Summer Night"" is actually pretty funny, and I don't just mean by Bergman's standards. It succeeds on its own as a comedy-of-manners.
 The only other Bergman comedy I have seen is his vastly underrated ""The Devil's Eye"". Between the two I prefer ""Eye"", but ""Smiles"" still has its own charm.
 Fredrik Egerman (Gunnar Bjornstrand) is married to Anne (Ulla Jacobson) and is having an affair with actress and former fling Desiree Armfeldt (Eva Dahlbeck). Too bad for Fredrik, Anne finds out. But Desiree is also seeing another man, Carl Magnus (Jarl Kulle) who is also married to one of Anne's friends, Charlotte (Margit Carlqvist), who also knows about he husband's ""past time"". Soon all of these people get together to spend a weekend in the country as Desiree throws a party in an attempt to win back Fredrik.
 This all sounds very usually for Bergman, but, as I said he is able to pull it off.
 Many may find the story-line resembles Woody Allen's ""A Midsummer's Night Sex Comedy"", and that's because this is what that movie was based on. Though I prefer Bergman's film to Allen's. Did you ever think Ingmar Bergman would make a better comedy than Woody Allen? I know it sounds odd, but wait until you see this film.
 Bottom-line: One of director Ingmar Bergman's funniest films. Surpringly filled with quirky moments and likeable performances from some Bergman regulars. ""Smiles of a Summer Night"" is worth watching.",1085702400,,1952,4.757396449704142
1196571,4,B000007NTY,"""Smiles of a Summer Night"" is probably one reason why Bergman hasn't made particularly many comedies, even though this is a big award-winner. This film is not at all bad - I would give it 9/10 stars for remaining entertaining throughout, but had the script--or rather, SOME LINES--been adapted or dramatized a bit, this story could easily have been presented as another one of Bergman's ""philosophical dramas;"" Russian roulette, suicide, and adultery (mistresses and wives meeting under social circumstances) are a few of the ingredients for this summer - this might not sound very much like typical 1955 comedy ingredients, but my laughs weren't always silent; at times I felt highly amused, and I can see how he did pull off something new in cinema with this film, but Bergman certainly has more talent in making movies that probably shouldn't be presented in their opening as ""a romantic comedy,"" though there is a nice and warm vibe to this exceptional film. I doubt that it will disappoint any dedicated Bergman fan, or that this edition will disappoint any costumer, as Criterion rarely fail at restoring old pictures.",1080604800,10,1124,5.016042780748663

7905087,2,B000007NTY,"A comedy? Perhaps by the standards of Sweden in 1955, since no one actually commits suicide, they're just miserable and only one actually tries to kill himself (but fails). During most of the film everybody is unhappy, though everybody is fabulously rich (except, of course, for the servants who serve them  and service them). A sommelier serving wine with dinner at home? Certainly not; the sommelier only carries one bottle as he leads a troop of wine carriers, each with a bottle, around one per dinner guest, into the dining room. In other words, these are the trials and tribulations of the almost unimaginably rich in their servant-run castles. If you like to watch such-like at play, agonizing over what dress to wear to the theater or whether to consummate her marriage with her husband or instead with his son, this is for you. But I doubt even you will get many laughs over this alleged comedy.",1504656000,,904,4.75796178343949

7905091,5,B000007NTY,"My father -- a movie addict but very critical -- said Smiles of a Summer Night was the most perfect movie he had ever seen.  I agree, except that I include Wild Strawberries, Seventh Seal, Through a Glass Darkly, The Magician as non pareil, and some of his early films, Summer with Monika, Sawdust and Tinsel, Secrets of Women, Torment (his first).  Bergman was the greatest filmmaker I've ever seen.  Kurosawa and Sajayet Ray (I only saw 2 of his films) were on a par but for different reasons.  I'm watching a documentary about Bergman right now -- on the making of Winter Silence -- and am once again under his spell.  I hope there is an after life as I want to meet him there.",1459728000,,680,4.365079365079365
