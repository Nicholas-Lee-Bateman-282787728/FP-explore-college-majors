7971654,4,B00006LPBG,"Two titles in THE OLDEST PROFESSION 4 Movie Pack are TV movies, so there's not a lot of sexually graphic material here. Although this may disappoint those seeking titillation, for anyone interested in watching well-known actors in some rather obscure but good films, this set's sure to please.

CONTENTS:

HOOKER CULT MURDERS-- A title that's nonexistent at movie databases. ""The Pyx"" gives Karen Black one of her best roles. She plays a heroin-addict prostitute whose death investigation reveals the existence of a violent devil worshipping cult. The story is partially told through flashbacks. Finely-paced.

HUSTLING-- Solid cast in this made-for-TVer about a magazine reporter's involvement with several NYC hookers. Her probes reveal that some prominent citizens are controlling the sex industry. Based on Gail Sheehy's investigations. Look for Burt Young (""Paulie"" in ROCKY) and Howard Hesseman (WKRP in Cincinnati) in minor roles.

LITTLE LADIES OF THE NIGHT--  TV film that received little airtime in 1977 as its subject matter was thought too disturbing. A young runaway ends up an LA streetwalker. An LAPD detective tries to help her break free of a controlling pimp. An outstanding ensemble here.

MIDNIGHT COP-- Another mistitled film. This is actually West German-made ""Killing Blue."" Confusing plot begins with a police commissioner's accidental crippliing of a young girl during a drug sting shootout, which leaves the cop guilt ridden. When another girl dies of an OD, the commissioner tries to get at her dealer by cozying up to a hooker played by Morgan Fairchild. Frank Stallone as the pusher gives a solid performance.

BRENTWOOD's 4-fers are nicely priced movie bundles. Video and sound quality of these digitally unrestored public domain films is generally fine. Discs are dual-side recorded.

7971655,1,B00006LPBG,"This must be the most horrible DVD ever made. The quality sucks, it is worse than a copy made with a camera in a theater. It has nothing to do with the tiles and advertisement. It is as erotic as watch paint dry. If you buy, you will regret as I did. I felt I was cheated. It only got 1 star because the system does not allow zero stars.",1111622400,27,337,3.8285714285714287
