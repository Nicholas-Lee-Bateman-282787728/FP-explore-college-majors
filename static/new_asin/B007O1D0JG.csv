Indeed, that was what I got with ""The Wizard's Destiny"", the very first full-length computer-animated movie released by Wogglebug Productions.  It is a standard fantasy adventure that presented action, magic, and, in my opinion, one of the most impressive animated monsters not to be spewed out by Pixar or Dreamworks.
I was also extremely impressed by the voice actors found to bring these characters to life.  A couple were a little lackluster, and not evoking emotion when it was needed, but as for the main actors--they could perhaps go right to Disney and audition for their next animated feature.
Again, the animation just shows what you can accomplish when you are an aspiring animator, and really do your homework when searching for the right program that will suit your movie.  The magic and action is expressed vividly thanks to the obvious care and pride that the animator wanted for this movie.  It is a treat to watch many of the action scenes, and generally when it comes to watching the main character learn to invoke his magic power.
The dialogue is pretty sharp as well, giving the characters their own personality, and letting the story come alive.
I would say my only problem with this movie was that sometimes, the story dragged.  While the dialogue is still good and the action impressive, you knew you could skip ahead of some things, and you wouldn't have missed anything.  But even so, that does not detract from the amazing first effort of Wogglebug Productions.  Very much like Disney's ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"", this was a very substantial piece of work that paid off in the end, and no doubt will be followed by several more wonderful movies!",1340668800,,1863,4.8734177215189876

The animation was well - done, too - the character's facial expressions and hand gestures vary/change according to the situation, and the Cthulhu was most impressive, too! :)",1333065600,,352,4.693548387096774
