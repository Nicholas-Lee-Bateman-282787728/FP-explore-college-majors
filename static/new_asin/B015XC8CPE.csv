8734895,4,B015XC8CPE,"Ed Wynn was a great comedian, but movies didn't quite capture his style and talent to amuse. (See his TV shows (1949-1951 for a truer Ed Wynn.) Some comedians' styles fit the narrative mode: Chaplin, Dressler, Keaton, Lloyd, Langdon, Laurel & Hardy and Abbott & Costello, Others,equally great, function best in sketch, stand-up or variety acts like Wynn, Fanny Brice, Bobby Clark, Lahr, Bea Lillie, Ritz Brothers and Wiere Brothers. Some, like the Marx Brothers, Olsen & Johnson, Red Skelton and Martin & Lewis could work well either way.
Ed was too old to play the son of a fire chief. And either the scriptwriters were at a loss of writing for Wynn or the studio wanted a shorter picture and chopped The Chief into incomprehension, because, suddenly the story stops--it doesn't end---and the audience is transported into the radio studio where Ed Wynn conducted his phenomenally popular weekly radio shows, and (I guess) we are expected to assume that all had transpired through 7/8's of the movie was simply a visualizartion of a story Ed was relating to his radio audience.",1469491200,,1077,4.923076923076923
8734896,3,B015XC8CPE,"Better than expected radio-era Ed Wynn vehicle. Not a comedy classic, but a big dose of the Ed of the early 30s.. Some very funny scenes with only a couple that fall flat.",1449187200,,171,4.212121212121212
