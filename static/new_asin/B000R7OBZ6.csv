8199430,4,B000R7OBZ6,"This Nature episode shows the wildlife in Africa's Great Rift valley.  The unique area, created by a crack in the earth's surface, is a habitat for wildlife including lions, wildebeest, giraffes, elephants, zebras, and more.  In that part of the world there is also Lake Tanganyika, which is more like an ocean, but it supports fish and other marine life unique to the lake.

It is a video well worth getting, but unfortunately it's not on DVD.",1210809600,,444,4.740259740259741
