Second, it looks like it was shot on a budget of $10 over two days in October. There are very few interior shots of anything, and despite videotaping in a densely populated city, there are amazingly few shots that include people. (Was that because they'd need releases? I have no idea.) There are lots of tilted-high shots of church steeples and frequent shots of wildlife. Would a close-up of a squirrel burying a nut give you an idea of what Boston Common is like?

Third, the DVD feels like it was cranked out of a distant factory. The narrator is a woman with a proper British accent talking about Boston's contributions to ""our"" (US) history. The background music is often inappropriate, as when driving action music accompanies those shots of church steeples. It's as though the producers just didn't care what matched or didn't match.

What saves this from a one-star review is that it has a few interior shots of the New England Aquarium, and it spends a fair amount of time on the Freedom Trail. But there are no traces of Red Sox, Fenway Park, or any other Boston sports. There's no mention of the ubiquitous subway ""The T"". In short, it really doesn't feel much like Boston.

This DVD sure looks like what I would see on one of those gift shop impulse buy racks - something to send to Grandma to show her a little about what you just experienced.

I'm glad I borrowed my library's copy of this DVD, because I would have felt awful about spending money on it.",1304035200,,1558,4.530249110320285
