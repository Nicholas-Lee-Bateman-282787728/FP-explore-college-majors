7559308,4,B018WQBNCC,"An odd combo to say the least. When released on DVD The Dunwich Horror was paired with another Lovecraft adaptation, Die, Monster, Die. This time it's saddled with a turgid, pointless mess called The Murders in the Rue Morgue, which has nothing to do with Poe's original story.

What's sad is that Rue Morgue has fantastic production values (for the period and budget) and a great array of stars. The Dunwich Horror, on the other hand, resembles nothing so much as a cheap Night Gallery episode. That said, it is the better film by miles.

Scream Factory knew fans of Lovecraft craved a Blu-ray of The Dunwich Horror, so I suspect they paired it with what they knew was the weakest American International title in their catalog. Don't let the fact that you're paying for one film deter you, though. The Dunwich Horror still holds up, despite being made the year Americans landed on the Moon. And watch for a certain rising young actress playing the nurse assistant to Dr. Corey. It's none other than Talia Coppola, before she was Talia Shire.",1459555200,3,1042,4.71978021978022

8743279,4,B018WQBNCC,"THE DUNWICH HORROR
one of my favourites Satanic films based on a H.P. Lovecraft novel
Dean stockwell plays Wilbur whateley who happens to be the son or Deciple of Satan
trying to get his hands on the Necronomicon book from the Dunwich Library in Dunwich
Actress Sandra Dee plays the Librarian who becomes his Sacrifice in his Demonic ritual
the very old MGM DVD version only had the original Trailer as an extra
Scream factory have reissued the film with a new 1080P 1:78:1 HD transfer & 2.0 master audio stereo mix
the new transfer does look excellent very nice sharp & clear picture & the sound quality is bigger sound quality improvement
much. much better picture & audio than the old MGM DVD
EXTRAS tragically no new interview Dean stockwell, maybe he Declined an interview
and actress Sandra Dee died back in 2005 anyway
so there's only a new Audio commentary by Film historian Steve Haberman which only some of it is worth listening to
and of course the original trailer is included aswell
Scream factory have also added the 1970 version of MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE with Actor Jason robards
which has been given the same 1:78:1 HD transfer the same 2.0 master audio mix as the Dunwich Horror film
EXTRAS.
the STAGE TRICKS & SCREEN FRIGHTS interview with Director Gordon kessler has been carried over from the old MGM DVD
plus another new audio commentary with Steve haberman & of course the original theatrical trailer
yes this new blu-ray reissue is worth buying for sure it's much better upgrade from the old mgm dvd no Doubt about it
3-4stars for it based on excellent HD transfers of both films & 2 new audio commentary tracks
but no new interview with Dean stockwell for the Dunwich Horror film otherwise i'll probably give this reissue 5 stars
still worth buying & throwing out the old MGM DVD",1490054400,2,1806,4.664576802507837
8743280,3,B018WQBNCC,"Much nostalgia, having grown up with films from this era and then first runs on tele in the 70s, when tv stations were not supplied with video tape versions to air.  Contrary to most, I love The Dunwich Horror, regardless of its budget flaws.
Note: When this film was released to VHS in the 1980s the sequence with Wilbur and Nancy driving into Dunwich (beginning with a high angle shot) and the dialogue:
""I thought you said you didn't know anything about cars?""
""I don't. I must have just hit the right thing.""
was missing.  I could never understand the reason for the omission because it creates a structural hole in the script.  The two are suddenly in Dunwich.  All further release versions including the DVD and this Bluray use this strangely 'damaged' master source.  Lazy.  Why?
Perhaps no one cares but me...",1463184000,4,817,4.678321678321678
8743281,5,B018WQBNCC,"I bought this primarily for the Dunwich Horror, but both movies are good, and I can recommend them both. Horror tells the tale of the Whatelys. a family that believes in the old ones. Wilber attempts to summon them only to be thwarted. The Rue Morgue deals with multiple murders and a terrible secret only slowly revealed. Both are good adaptations of the original stories, and truly enjoyable.",1462060800,,394,4.8088235294117645
8743282,5,B018WQBNCC,"These may not be classics but they are very watchable horror films. Murders in the Rue Morgue is the more interesting of the two. Jason Robards and Michael Dunn star in what is Jason's rare if not only turn in a horror film. Herbert Lom is on hand as the villain but there is more villians than heroes in this adaption of Poe's tale.
Dunwich horror was done as Die Monster Die in 1965 with Karloff. This is not the same retelling and it is a fast paced solid terror film in it's own right. Sandra Dee and Dean Stockwell star in this Lovecraft tale.
The transfers and commentaries on both films is excellent and you will get a great evenings entertainment.",1461024000,4,655,4.377049180327869
8743283,5,B018WQBNCC,"I am a big fan of old classic scifi/horror movies and ""The Dunwich Horror"" brings back fond memories. The acting is good and the surprise ending catches your attention.  Too bad there was no sequel. I had not seen it's companion ""Murders in the Rue Morgue"" in years.  Not as good as DH but still fun to add to my collection",1460937600,,323,4.278688524590164
8743284,3,B018WQBNCC,"The two movies in this review, Murders in the Rue Morgue (1971 version) and The Dunwich Horror are both decent movies but not great. I would rate 'Murders' at 5/10, Dunwich at 6/10 and give the transfer a 5/10. The transfer of 'Murders' is a bit better, in my opinion, than 'Dunwich.'

The first movie, 'Murders in the Rue Morgue' is about an actor, who is seemingly dead, who comes back to life to start killing members of an acting troupe. He had been accidentally badly disfigured during an acting performance and then supposedly committed suicide. Now, for unknown reasons he is apparently taking revenge.

'Murders in the Rue Morgue' has several problems. It comes with a short video of the director, Gordon Hessler. In it he explains away a few of these problems. For starters, he felt his star actor, Jason Robards, wasn't really into the part and that it was a come down from what he was used to. Hessler states that Robards had his choice of parts and could have taken any part in the movie. Robards, apparently made a mistake and felt that he should have taken Herbert Lom's role as the villian, Rene Marot.
Another bigger problem was that Hessler felt that everybody already knew the plot of the original 'Murders in the Rue Morgue' which was made in 1932. If you have seen that movie then you will know that it has a surprise villain that is revealed at the end. Hessler felt that the movie would be ruined for most people since they already knew the ending and that they would not want to see the movie. Therefore he changed the script and created a different murderer. This was probably a mistake. The original was very good but by the 70's there were probably a lot of people who did not know the plot of the original.
Another problem with the movie when it was first released is that it was edited without the knowledge of Hessler and the original vision of the director was changed. The movie you get here is the original version that had been saved and not the one released in the movie theater.

As a side not, Gordon Hessler makes it clear in his interview that he wishes he could have directed higher quality movies like 'Casablanca' during his career.

The second movie, 'The Dunwich Horror' is interesting film based on the Lovecraft story of the same name. This is a better movie than the first one but it too has some problems.

'The Dunwich Horror' is about a young man, Wilbur Whately who is attempting to bring back the 'Old Gods' to Earth. According to Lovecraft lore (I am no expert), the Old Gods left Earth many ages ago. He believe he can bring them back with the help of a very old book called the ""Necronomicon.' It is being held in the library at Miskatonic University and it is kept in the library there under the watchful eye of Henry Armitage. Wilbur has a mysterious brother locked away upstairs in the family mansion. Wilbur manages to persuade Nancy (Sandra Dee) to stay at his house for the weekend. He probably uses hypnosis or a potion or both in order to get her to do this but it is unclear. He plans to use her to help him bring back the 'Old Gods.'

Some SPOILERS AHEAD.

While the movie follows the same basic premise of the Lovecraft story it does alter story somewhat and makes some changes at important intervals. The story by Lovecraft is not long and was not considered long enough for a full length movie. Therefore it had to be padded.

Some of the changes are:
Dean Stockwell playing Wilbur, while not the best looking guy, is clearly not the horrific looking person portrayed by Lovecraft.
Wilbur does not succeed in getting the Necronomicon in the short story and is killed by guard dogs. In the movie Wilbur defeats a security guard (who runs into a spear seemingly on purpose!) to get control of the book.
Obviously since he dies early on, Wilbur is not defeated by Professor Armitage in the story.
Wilbur's mother, Lavinia dies when he is 12 in the story but is in an asylum in the movie.
Sandra Dee's character does not exist in the Lovecraft story and seems to be here for box office appeal.

For whatever reason, Sandra Dee decided to stop acting for awhile before accepting the role as Nancy for a considerable fee plus a percentage. She apparently did not like her image as the wholesome all-american girl she had portrayed up to that point in her career.

Wilbur's half brother who is invisible most of the time is portrayed effectively through use of flashing lights and wind. It's hard to explain, you just sort of have to see it.

There is not a lot of critical 'love' for the film version of 'The Dunwich Horror' but I don't think it is all that bad.

Recommended for fans of AIP and of late 60's early 70's horror movies.",1460592000,5,4695,4.497652582159624
