308479,1,630103581X,"I ordered this movie and it was a horrible bootleg copy. I can believe that amazon allows this to happen. I should have known better because this movie has never been produced in dvd its only been in vhs and whoever owns this movie is making copies from a vhs to dvd and it looks dark and grainy. You can hardly see the faces its terrible. So be careful if you are trying to order this movie and if you do, get ready to watch a really bad bootleg copy.",1226534400,32,452,4.033333333333333
308480,3,630103581X,"beware the quality on this ""official"" release.  It may have produced in a large quantity by somebody calling themselves a factory, but the artwork is a grainy photocopy, and the DVD itself is just a VHS transfer with some sort of contrast filter ran on it.  It is NOT digitially remastered and it is not widescreen.  There are no bonuses or features.  About the only thing that makes it worhtwhile is it takes less space than a VHS, there are chapter breakdowns, and it will not degrade like a VHS will.

BUT, we still need a QUALITY OFFICIAL FACTORY release!",1195603200,24,559,4.55
308481,5,630103581X,"I saw Boulevard Nights in the late 80's, found it at my local movie rental place, rented it again several years later after that and to this day it still has that impact and feeling of what life was growing up in East Los back in the day.

The movie is down to the point, it does not get boring at all and me being a big chicano full of carnalismo vato, has to recommend this movie. Yeah you have the other titles like ""American Me"", ""Bound By Honor"" and ""Mi Vida Loca"", but this one is more like the early times before all that came into effect.

I'm still looking for this movie and at the same time waiting for it to be more readily available on DVD, I'll wait till then, but if you can find it, good luck.

A must see Vato.",1192579200,9,727,4.0

308484,3,630103581X,"I knew that this film was not going to be Oscar caliber, but I was a little disappointed with the broad strokes the director allowed the Mexicans in the film to be painted with.  We see them as outsiders, never  delving into their souls and emotions.  The Cholos are generic and they  sound like ""West Side Story"" rejects.  But the funny thing is  that I liked this film.  In the hands of a competant director, this  material could have been a GREAT film, but as it is, it is just a fair  film.  The score is excellent, and I wish I could find it.

As for the DVD I was a bit hesitant to order after reading reviews about the quality but my copy had pretty good quality for being an older movie that's never been digitally remastered. As for the people complaining, maybe next you should do more research about the product before ordering. The WB Archive Collection website clearly states that their release of Boulevard Nights on DVD was NOT digitally remastered. Thanks again for the quick delivery and great copy of one of my favorite movies growing up. Would definitely order from this company again.",1456444800,3,677,4.697478991596639

The DVD case says that its Digitally Remastered THIS IS NOT TRUE!!! It also says that its in Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound---THIS IS NOT TRUE ITS 2 CHANNEL 2.0.  It also has DTS logos on it LOL ya right---LOL so not true!!! With that being said, I still enjoyed watching this movie very much!!! The picture quality sucks, But its still watchable. The sound is not that bad for being 2.0.--its just not what it says on the case or the DVD itself (the DVD also has the logos on it). The back of the case says running time 1 Hour 2 minutes--but the movie is 1 hour and 40 minutes long. Even with all those faults its still the best version you can get---BECAUSE THIS MOVIE WAS NEVER CONVERTED TO DVD EVER--so the only way to see it on DVD is to transfer it yourself. There is a company called http://www.screenarchives.com/  that specializes in converting old classic movies to Blu ray. Email them and tell them we want My Family  Mi Familia----Blood In Blood Out BOUND BY HONOR-----Mi Vida Loca (My Crazy Life)------American Me----Boulevard Nights ALL CONVERTED TO BLU RAY.

All the cars and businesses on the strip that appear in the movie appear to be the actual city and actual cars and not a studio set or replica vehicles. It is a very good drama/action movie. It delves deep into the Mexican American culture that exists in lower California. Highly recommended. Has cuss words, gangs and violence to name a few Rated R features in this flick.",1325116800,,521,4.494736842105263

The picture quality on the movie sucks as well. There's a lot of dark screens, but don't take my word on it. If you want you can see for yourself.",1315180800,,436,3.9101123595505616

Yes the Official Boulevard Nights (DVD-R) is finally here the original copyright makers of this classic Gangster movie ""Warner Bros"" you will see that there is a bootleg that has been sold worldwide by a fake named ""Theater@home"" that is not the Official DVD but a VHS transfer bootleg the quality is horrable I otta know it was givin to me as a last year Christmas present. The picture is very grainy and blurry and some scenes are very dark then some to bright and theres this annoying line on the bottom of the screen that runs back and forth it's kind of hard to watch the movie with that however this ""Official"" DVD by Warner Bros is excellent quality it has not been remastered or restored but is the ""Original Masters"" meaning it is the very first Boulevard Nights movie to ever be made. Buy this and you won't dissapointed it is a bit pricey but don't you think it's worth the money it's a rare hard to find Original not bootleg DVD that can last a lifetime if you take care of it. If you buy the other one all your going to get is sloppy DVD.

NOTE: SOME SELLERS ARE GOING AROUND TELLING PEOPLE THAT THE DVD FROM ""THEATER@HOME"" IS OFFICIAL BECAUSE IT IS FACTORY PACAGED WITH A SEAL ON IT. THIS IS NOT TRUE SEAL OR NO SEAL THIS DVD FROM WARNER BROS IS THE REAL DVD!

NOTE: I WANTED TO LET YOU ALL KNOW THAT BOULEVARD NIGHTS WILL NEVER BE RELEASED ON DVD THIS MOVIE IS A (DVD-R)ONLY IT IS FROM THE WARNER BROS ""ARCHIVE COLLECTION"" IT IS THERE SERIES OF OLD MOVIES THAT NEVER MADE IT BIG AND WERE NOT IN HIGH DEMAND. WARNER BROS DID NOT FEEL THAT IT WAS WORTH IT TO MAKE BOULEVARD NIGHTS ON A REAL DVD SO THEY RELEASED THE MOVIE TO THERE ARCHIVE COLLECTION. THE ONLY WAY THIS MOVIE WILL EVER BE RELEASED IS THIS (DVD-R)OR BOOTLEGS. YES YOU HERD RIGHT NO REMASTERED,RESTORED,SPECIAL FEATURES DVD WILL EVER BE MADE FOR THIS MOVIE! WHEN A MOVIE HAS BEEN MADE IN THE ARCHIVE COLLECTION IT WILL NEVER BE REMADE AGAIN!

Condition Of The DVD

I was givin this DVD as a Christmas gift last year and when I went to watch it the quality was horrable! First off it's very grainy and some scenes are very dark to where you cant see the peoples faces and some scenes are so bright that you cant stand to stare at the screen to long it's also blurry. When this was first put out on DVD it was said to be ""The Official DVD"" it is not the Official DVD this is infact is a bootleg transferred from VHS copy that someone made that sold worlwide. Don't be fooled into buying this fake DVD even if the seller tells you it's got a seal on it this DVD was never Official the copyright owner maker of this classic is ""Warner Bros"" and they did not make this however the real Official DVD has now been made for the first time through it's original maker ""Warner Bros"" they have it for sale here on amazon for about $39.00 I bought one myself it is not digitally remastered or restored but the Original Masters (meaning it was the very first Boulevard Nights ever made)I am so proud to own that DVD. The quality is fantastic! So do yourself a favor don't waste your time on sloppy bootleg's go and get the real Boulevard Nights DVD. You know $39.00 is not a bad price to pay for An Original Rare DVD that can be kept for a lifetime! I am so upset that someone can get away with scamming people into buying this awful bootleg! Worse then that I don't apreciate that sellers are telling people it's real just cause it has a seal on it AGAIN SEAL OR NO SEAL THIS IS A VHS TRASNFERRED TO DVD BOOTLEG NOT WARNER BROS OFFICIAL DVD!",1261440000,,2145,4.191283292978208
308933,5,630103581X,"I was shopping around for this movie and couldn't find it anywhere. I finally found it being sold by Amazon and although it's a bit expensive, it's the real deal and the quality is great. I would recommend buying it from Amazon instead of the other sellers on the site because I heard the other sellers have low quality movies as if they were copied and not the real movie.",1260921600,,373,4.3428571428571425
308934,5,630103581X,"No, on the contrary... ""Boulevard Nights"" started it all, in my opinion.  Raymond is the ex-gang member trying to live the straight and narrow life, but kid brother Chuco (a young Danny De La Paz, who is immortalized as ""Puppet"" from ""American Me"") is still caught up in ""the life."" His choices make for some even harrowing ones by Raymond, still torn between the two lives. At once triumphant and tragic, with at least a glimmer of hope.",1252972800,,438,4.615384615384615
