3937414,4,B002IVLWIS,"CF Pure Abs & Arms comes with a resistance band, which is used a good bit throughout DVD.  Fred & Elisabeth talk you through each segment. I enjoy this because it helps keep proper form & breath with the movements.  I did my best to breakdown the ab segments, however, I may have missed a couple resets...you will know what I'm talking about if you are familiar with CF. During the abs they mention thoracic breathing, keeping the abdominal wall still - this adds a whole other level to abdominal work. The arm segments are fairly challenging - the arm exercises flow into the next, building the much loved muscle burn feeling! At the beginning of each segment, the usual warm up is done, lifting right arm/left leg.....

Core Fusion Pure abs & arms is seperated into five segments that are 10 minutes each.
The segments:
Upper Body Weights - Fred
Upper Body - Elisabeth
Abdominals - Fred
Abdominal Curl with Leg Variations - Fred
Upper Body, Back & Hip Stretches - Elisabeth

1. Upper Body Weights - You'll need weights & resistance band
Start with weights above head and pull down towards hips,
Hold weights shoulder high,extend arms out bring arms down to outer thighs - working deltoids
Alternating arm raises working Anterior Deltoid
Row weights up to chin, lift up & press overhead
Elbows shoulder high extend arms out to the side & curl working biceps
Bring arms front alternating arms hammer curl
Take weights up, bend elbows back for tricep extensions
Release one weight, hinge forward holding one weight behind back & lift hold
Stretching muscles used with band

2. Upper Body - Resistance band
Place band under feet, bend knees & roll shoulders
Hammer curls - alternating arms, then both arms
Turn palms toward thighs for deltoid row - alternating arms, then both arms
Fold forward at hips - arms extended lift up squeezing shoulder blades - rhomboids
Tricep Series - arms back & lift up, squeeze arms in pulse, bend & stretch arms - OUCH!
Step back, put band under front leg & bend leg slightly. Hold arms out palms down and pulse up. Next, twist to right, hands together in middle, twist to left - working from the hips. Switch legs and repeat.

3. Abdominals - resistance band & mat
C-curve holding resistance band. Keep shoulder blades off mat, let arms go - hold out. Reset.
Pump arms down similar to pilates 100
Twist working obliques - Hold position, small crunches, small curls, hold - reset & lift both arms & hold up if you can =)
Band around feet parallel hip width apart, round down one vertabrae at a time - release all the way back. Slowly roll up. Second set, stop where curl, then release down. Last two reps, stop at waist position. Lift legs up in V, pull hands together and small curls.
On stomach, counter pose to C-curve - hands down at sides, lift breast bone, arms & legs. Elbows up to ears, thumbs up lift chest & thighs. Lastly, bow stretch

4. Abdominal Curl with Leg Variations - Resistance band & yoga block/rolled up towel
With band around ball of left foot, extend left leg up(or bend)& right leg out. C-curve -Hold position (hands around leg) Slowly pull resistance band out to the side & reset. Pull band out again then do small curls.  Hands higher and wider - hold position. Repeat on right.
Yoga block or towel - in between inner thighs, stabalize position of c curve - legs extended.  Challenge by lifting arms up.  Small curls. Hands behind shoulder blades - if you can =)
Get back in position with legs up - twist to left side, hold position. Hands up if possible, reset. Back in position & do small curls. Reset, back into position & raise arms. Repeat on right side.
Towel between ankles then get back into position.  Jack knife - arms lifting while legs going down & back up. Reset, then place hands behind shoulder blades.

The Upper Body, Back & Hip Stretches are exactly that =)There are some excellent hip stretches in this segment. I love any sort of stretching at the end of working out. This segment is much appreciated =)

I like this DVD, however, the arm segments weren't as intense as I was hoping for. There were a couple of times I wish my band was the same length as Fred & Elisabeth's.  The band that came with the DVD seemed too short for me during a couple of the exercises. Overall I recommend this DVD for those really into callanetics. Beginner & Intermediate exercisers would benefit from this as well.  Advanced exercisers may be a little disappointed, as there are more challenging arm/ab workouts available.

*******After a nice amazon customer asked a question about the bonus section (which I didn't even realize was there...oops) My attitude has changed.  There is some nice back work included, which I desparately need.  The bonus consists of:

1. Prone Strengthener & Stretch -really nice back work
2. from Exhale Pilates Plus (10min)- flat back/round back core
3. from Shiva: Creative Core Abs (8 min)- spontaneous core",1259712000,119,4901,4.658169177288529

3937425,4,B002IVLWIS,The band makes it a different type of ab/arm work out.  I liked it - I thought it was challenging for both the arms and abs.  I liked that they did not try to mix in a cardo workout - it is just focusing on sculpting of the arms and abs.  Short and sweet. Definately worth it.,1420761600,3,276,3.807017543859649

3937437,5,B002IVLWIS,"I tried this workout for the first time this morning.  I haven't done any dedicated arm or ab work recently, so it was challenging.  I only got through the first four segments, but I enjoyed them.  I have to work on my form on the ab work still but it will come with time.  The only little annoyance is that sometimes the resistance band feels like it should be longer for one part of standing work where you loop it around your foot and have your arms at shoulder level and do twists.  I had trouble getting my arms to shoulder level, but that could just be a lack of strength issue on my part.  I am pretty sure if I do this dvd a couple times a week I will see results in about a month or so.  In the 44 minutes of the session I did, I burned 255 calories.  I worked up a sweat and my abs were quivering on the ab work.  I do have to work on relaxing my neck though.

I watched the 10 min. Pilates Plus preview - looks amazing, so I went ahead and ordered it.",1407801600,,962,3.9123711340206184
3937438,5,B002IVLWIS,I love this DVD - the work outs are awesome and with being broken down into 10 minute segments they are not overwhelming! I have been consistently doing these exercises for about three weeks and I am seeing great results!,1404086400,,221,4.55
3937439,5,B002IVLWIS,This is THE BEST exercise I have done they really work to tone and lengthen muscles instead of bulking like many exercise do  love it,1398816000,,133,4.32
3937440,5,B002IVLWIS,"I love this series of videos.  Really gets your muscles burning.  The couple who does this remind you of position, breathing and keeping your ""core"" stable.  I'm already seeing (and feeling!) results after a week.",1397779200,,213,5.0285714285714285
3937441,3,B002IVLWIS,"Its ok...that is all...not the best exercise video, but certainly not the worst either.  The band that comes with should've been a little longer as I am pretty tall and it hard to work with.",1392595200,,190,4.428571428571429
3937442,1,B002IVLWIS,I'm choosing this rating because I thought it was a video for beginners.  Definitely Not!!! Intense work out get for people already in shape!,1391817600,3,141,4.875
3937443,5,B002IVLWIS,Love this tape.  The first one had some problems but I got it replaced and it's great.  It comes with the resistance band.  You get a good workout with this tape.  Price was great!,1391472000,,180,4.205882352941177
3937444,4,B002IVLWIS,"This is a great work out that targets abs, shoulders, back, biceps and triceps.  You can choose between the band (which is provided) or free weights.

There are 5, 10 minute work outs. That is what I like best about Core Fusion because I can fit in what I have time for.  I usually combine these work outs with other other Core Fusion DVDs I own.

The bonus features are very good too.  There is a 10 minute hip and back strength that feels wonderful after a long run.  If you have tight hips, you have to try it.",1390867200,,513,4.1313131313131315
3937445,5,B002IVLWIS,Love this core fusion workout. The band is put to good use in the segments although the one that comes with it is  shorter than the ones they are using which is okay for some parts but you may need to improvise on others. Sometimes I will do a rotation for a few weeks with this and the buns and thighs. Great results and the 10 minute segments rock.,1390348800,,350,4.072463768115942

3937448,1,B002IVLWIS,"I wonder if this was a workout video from the 90's or something. It's just bizarre. It's not a workout video at all and could never possibly get anyone tone. Each segment is 70% stretch before then after. Then like one shoulder exercise. You could pick one machine at the gym, do 3 sets and you will have worked more then the entire segment of this video. Just weird. I'm not sure how you would categorize this thing.",1376265600,3,417,4.358974358974359

3937456,5,B002IVLWIS,"Love this DVD -- I purchased it based on the recommendations of others at Amazon, and I'm really happy I did. The husband and wife team are VERY thorough and pleasant, and while I don't mind watching other younger fitness professionals, it's nice to see people who are a little older for a change -- it's inspiring. :) The format is great -- it's broken into 10 minute segments, so you can do a little or a lot, and each segment tells you what you'll need -- exercise band (included with DVD), block or towel, mat, etc. The exercises are adaptable for any fitness level -- they show the advanced move and a more beginner format. Well done!",1358985600,4,639,4.423728813559322
3937457,3,B002IVLWIS,"DVD came with a resistance band, but I've ended up adjusting the exercises so I can use a towel or weights.

3937458,2,B002IVLWIS,"I like the weight part of the DVD for the arms, other than that, I'm not impressed. The resistance band is awkward to use with the ab exercises and it kept moving around. There are much better fitness DVDs you can get.",1355443200,,218,4.214285714285714
3937459,4,B002IVLWIS,"As to the 'burn factor' I think this is a really good workout for 'down days' when I'm taking a break from heavy cardio activities.  However, if you need counting and good transitions this might not be the DVD for you.  I live in a small condo so I can't always be looking at the TV when working out and it's been frustrating not to know when they are transitioning, resting, resetting, etc.  I'm sure I'll get there after many more sessions but I have to admit that lack of guidance is really frustrating!

I didn't know about the bonus section either...can't wait to try it this week!",1330905600,,586,4.398148148148148
3937460,3,B002IVLWIS,"Abs and Arms is a decent product from the Core Fusion line.  This is the first tape I have ordered in the Core Fusion line. However, I have the good fortune of living in an area where I can attend Core Fusion classes, so I have had the experience of attending these particular classes in person.

 I think the tape does a fairly good job of duplicating the actual classes.  The only limitations that I have determined are the following:

  The warmups are not nearly long enough as the classes, or as needed to really get your circulation going for the exercises to follow. However, this can be quickly alleviated by doing the ""high-steps"" roughly 1 minute before pressing Play on the tape, finish up with the warm-up on the tape, and you should be good to go.

Other reviewers have commented on how the cueing to change sides and exercises is a bit off, with which I agree. However, since I have attended some live classes, it is more a nuisance for me than a deal killer.  The thing which is my peeve, is that the Fred and Elizabeth do not count down, or count out the reps for the exercises, which gives it less of a class feel, and makes it hard to follow.

 The production studio is fairly dark, but this does NOT prevent one from being able to see the demonstration of the exercises, as well as the modification demonstration, should one need it.

Another thing to keep in mind when viewing this tape, is that this was one of the first tapes produced by Fred and Elizabeth, so from what I understand, they have improved in both production and exercise count in their subsequent videos.",1327363200,9,1591,4.448275862068965
3937461,4,B002IVLWIS,"I wish it had more fast pace moves; however, quality not quantity it's what it counts. This DVD is good for those days that you don't have that much energy,
or just a quick tune up.(for me, I used for Saturdays, after having a week of intense work out....to relax a little with the benefit of working my muscles
at the same time) I gave this product 4 stars because those guys have a boring voice, overall, the work out is great.",1316649600,3,429,4.2439024390243905
3937462,1,B002IVLWIS,"I bought DVD looking for another to throw into the rotation.  Unfortunately this one didn't make the cut.  I started with the section for the upper body.  Right away I was creeped out by the instructions.  The people in the video are speaking, but not as the do the moves.  The instruction and comments were added after which was not expected.
I could get past the commentary, but the cueing is lacking and there isn't enough explanation.  I won't be doing this DVD again nor will I be buying from this series again either.",1310947200,,523,4.51063829787234
3937463,5,B002IVLWIS,"This DVD comes with a light resistance band.  I have every single Core Fusion DVD, and I love them all, although they are each a little different.  Body Sculpt and Long and Lean are both full body workouts, the latter a little more challenging than the former.  Both Arms and Abs and Thighs and Glutes are self-explanatory.  Pilates Plus focuses on abs/core work.  And the yoga Energy Flow and the Bootcamp DVDs are cardio workouts, the latter more challenging than the former, although both are quite rigorous and will make you sweat buckets.  I have taken both Pilates Mat and Pilates Fusion classes for a few years, and these DVDs are a wonderful complement when I am not in class, and in my opinion, are sometimes even more challenging than what I get in my exercise classes.  I have tried a number of different exercise DVDs over the years, and these are the only ones I have ever stuck with.  They are very enjoyable, challenging (but not so challenging that you give up), invigorating, interesting (they do not get boring because there is so much variety built in), and I have noticed some subtle differences in my body from my work with both the DVDs and my classes.  To really burn fat, though, you have to alter your diet. These DVDs will help with sculpting muscle (like a ballet dancer's body), but not so much with fat loss (at least I have always found that my weight loss occurs with diet and not with exercise, but that's just me.)  In short, money well spent, and I highly recommend the series.",1305936000,8,1511,4.562962962962963
3937464,4,B002IVLWIS,"This is the forth of the Core Fusion dvds I've purchased, and like the others, this one is intense and tough, but the exercises are in short enough units that you don't feel like giving up before the entire 50 minutes is over.

Having said this, I must say that I am actually disappointed in the product itself, because the exercise band that came with it is about 1/3 the size of the ones used by the people in the dvd, and about 1/2 the size of what you really need.  I ended up using free weights for the entire stretch band portion of the arm/shoulder workout, because I couldn't possibly do what was directed using the incredibly short stretch band in the package.  I will have to buy one.  Kind of a bummer.",1305158400,,713,4.298507462686567

Well, I could barely do the moves and was ready for the routines to be finished by the end.  If that's not enough, today my muscles are actually quite sore.  I can honestly say that I believe this will help me gain strength and muscle tone and overall greater flexibility.  I plan to continue using this and their other videos.

3937470,5,B002IVLWIS,"If you're wondering if this would be a good workout video for men to use, the answer is ""Yes"".

My husband had been wanting a weight bench and set to get more muscle tone.  He's tall and lean but not very muscular, and the age of ""50 years old"" is coming up in a few years and he knows it's important to keep his muscles working as he gets older.  For over a year now, he had been doing bicep curls and a couple other moves with a pair of my 8 lb weights (often putting both 8 lb weights in one hand -he has big hands- to increase the weight), as well as the ""plank"" for his abs,  but he wanted something more challenging.  I had the Core Fusion: Body Sculpt and loved it, so I got the Abs & Arms one for him and pestered him about trying it for a few months.  He had back surgery almost 15 years ago, and recently there's been a time or two where his back had seized up on him while doing push-ups, leaving him in pain for a couple days.  I thought the Core Fusion: Abs & Arms would be good for him for this reason.

When I finally got him to use this video, he did the warm up, then into the Upper Body workout with the pair of 8 lb weights.  It didn't take long for him to admit the workout was kicking his butt, and he asked me where the 5 lb weights were.  Few minutes later, he asked me where the 3 lb weights were!  He had to do part of the workout without any weights at all.  Since then, he's been very happy with the workouts, he tells me every morning that muscles were sore that he didn't even know he had.

I'm pleased, as this means I don't have to have a weight set and bench in one of our spare bedrooms.  Plus, if I reach over and grab his arm, it's feeling more solid, the muscles are getting toned.  If he wanted to have big bulky weightlifter muscles, no, these workouts wouldn't do that for him - well, I guess it *could* if he had challenging enough weights, but my husband is looking to have lean muscles.

I love all the Core Fusion workouts.  They always work my muscles, and more often than not they kick my butt.  It's those slow, controlled movements that really put my muscles to the test.  The Abs & Arms DVD was a great purchase.",1292457600,8,2160,4.016393442622951

You'll need a resistance band (which it comes with) , free hand weights (any size you feel comfortable with and a size heavier if you want), and your body!

Might be good to watch it through before attempting some moves, as it is hard to watch and workout from some positions. Love the 10 minute segments, it makes it less of a challenge to fit in with 3 little ones. Highly recommend!",1275436800,2,352,4.555555555555555

I love the fact that the series is broken down into segments.
 You can pick and choose which ones you want to do.
The instructors are easy to listen to and give great fed back
on your body placement and continue to provide you with
encouragement!  The segments are 10 minutes each and there
are 5 of them. This is a tough work out, but so worth it!!

3937478,4,B002IVLWIS,"There are five 10 minute sections.  You can do them separately or play all together for one 50 minute workout.  Every section works the abs in some way.  As you go through the sections there is less and less upper body and more and more abs and lower body.  The final 2 sections are intense abdominal and lower body work.  I felt the burn during and the next day after for the abs, and I saw the most results in my abs.  I'm an intermediate exerciser, but didn't have much of a six pack until now.  I give credit to this DVD for helping that happen.  I'm not totally cut yet, but I can definitely see a difference.  I can't tell if the DVD has significantly helped my arms more than the other DVDs I do for arms, so the jury is still out on that.  However, I felt the burn when doing the arm moves so I'm assuming they helped.

  The only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is because just like all the core exhale fusion videos, I have to keep track of the count.  Normally, I would never play a DVD again, if I have to do that beasue I want to focus on using my muscles.  However, the core fusion results are so effective, the DVD is worth doing to me.  If you don't want to keep track (ususally they do about 20 reps of each exercise), I would suggest switching which side you do first every time you do the DVD.  There is not much warm up or cool down per section like some longer exercise videos, but I find the way they progress through the moves in each 10 minute section to make up for that.",1270771200,13,1499,4.061433447098976
3937479,5,B002IVLWIS,"I have had a lot of trouble finding good pilates type DVDs. I like Ana Caban pilates DVDs but I find that there isn't a lot of arm workout type stuff on it, mostly just core. I came across this DVD when I searched ""arm pilates"". I really like it. There are 5 10 minute workouts. Each workout focuses mostly on one area (ex: the first 10 minutes is basically all arms). I watched the DVD before doing the actual workout and it seemed pretty easy. Woah! It was intense. I wouldn't say it is hard, but if you are able to complete the workout you can really feel the burn! I have done this workout 3 times and I already feel a change in my arms. It is much more enjoyable than doing those exercise machines at the gym. To do the workout you need 2 small weights (I am using two pound weights right now and they are killer!) and an exercise band, that comes with the DVD!! In only 10 minutes I toned my arms better than I could in an hour at the gym!!

As far as the ab workouts those are really good too. They are the same as most of the pilates workouts I do.

One thing I don't like, the guy. He's a little annoying, but if you can get past that this is an excellent DVD!",1267142400,10,1169,3.9914529914529915
3937480,5,B002IVLWIS,This is the best DVD for problem areas. I have worked out to a number of DVD's and this hits the spots. It's amazing to finally find something that really does what it says.,1264982400,2,173,4.117647058823529
3937481,1,B002IVLWIS,"This DVD was not worth the money you pay.  You don't get anything out of the workouts (and I'm not anywhere near being in great physical shape) and they're difficult to follow.  When you do follow along with the moves its hard to tell if the moves were actually a part of the workout itself or if you were still in the warm-up/stretching phase.  If you're looking to feel like you've gotten something out of a workout and want to push yourself, look elsewhere.  I purchased the 30 day shred along with this and it's kicking my butt.",1262563200,7,532,4.3979591836734695
3937482,4,B002IVLWIS,"Overall, I like this DVD. I add the arm segment from Body Sculpt after the two arm segments and my arms are like jelly afterward. However, if I don't add that segment, it is an average arm workout. I was hoping this dvd would make my arms feel like my butt and thighs do after Body Sculpt or Thighs and Glutes, but it falls slightly short. The other Core Fusion workouts are awesome. This one is good. It goes along the same principal as the other DVD's which I like. Controlled movements, breathing and stretching. Non-irritating instructors. I recommend it as an add in to other workouts :)",1261958400,15,592,4.4907407407407405
3937483,5,B002IVLWIS,"I really like this DVD.  I won't go over the details of each workout since Nancy has done such a great job with that, but here are my thoughts on the DVD.

Upper Body Weights:
I really enjoyed this segment. If you have the Body Sculpt DVD and use the upper body weight segment from it, this would be a good option to add some variety.  I love the 10 minute sessions as I tend to neglect my upper body in my workouts, but it is easy to squeeze this in.  If you are looking to make it more difficult, simply add more weight.  Easier? Simply use lighter weights.  You can also do the second segment.  I will also add - I'm in physical therapy currently for my knee so avoid doing standing weights.  I was able to complete the majority of the workout while sitting on the edge of a chair.
UPDATE: Since there have been some comments about the upper body segments being too easy, I thought it would be helpful to include the amount of weight I am using.  I had been lax on my upper body workouts lately so I did this the first two times with 3 lb weights, but now am using 5 lb weights. In the past when I did upper body weights all the time (but not using their DVD), I usually used 10 or 11 lb weights. So, if 5 lbs becomes easy, I will increase the weight to 7 or 8 lbs, etc. The exercises in this routine are traditional exercises just nicely combined into a 10 minute segment.

Upper Body with Resistance Band:
This is the only segment I have not tried as I was afraid it might bother my knee.

Abdominals with Resistance Band:
Abdominal Curl with Leg Variations:
I really enjoyed these and did both of them together.  Although there is a simiilarity between their ab routines, I think these are different enough to make this DVD worth purchasing even if you have the other ones.  I really like the Core Fusion ab routines, and since I also have Pilates Plus and Body Sculpt I like that this will give me additional variety.  I try to use one of their ab routines three times a week. I think if you do the same routine all the time, your body gets used to it. This shakes things up just enough.
UPDATE:  The last time I did these two, I did them together again, but I dropped the resistance band for the leg variations segment.  It worked just fine without it.

Upper Body, Back & Hip Stretches:
Wow - I really liked this stretch routine as I do all of their stretch routines.  I also have hip dysplasia and as a result it can be painful at times.  I really try to work on flexibility for my lower back and hips, and their routines are perfect.  I've used this routine a couple times when my hip was a little sore and it felt much better after.

BONUS segments:
- flat back/rounded back from the Pilates Plus DVD
- 8 minute routine from Shiva Rea's Creative Core DVD (I had fun doing this one after the first Core Fusion ab routine.)
- NEW 5 minute back routine.  This works on both stretches and strength.  It is short, but effective. I also give this routine a top rating.

If you have Pilates Plus and Body Sculpt and enjoy those, I think this would a good addition and provide some additional variety.  If you are new to Core Fusion, the ab routines are quite different than traditional ones with lots of crunch reps. Core Fusion has very long holds, but is very effective.",1260662400,40,3277,4.238325281803543
3937484,5,B002IVLWIS,"Just received this in the mail the other day, I am very happy with my purchase.  I have done several other exercise tapes, and none of them get watched more than 2-3 times...I certainly see myself continuing on with the Core Fusion tapes!  I love that it comes with an exercise band, you wouldn't be able to do the exercises with out one. You will need weights as well.
These exercises are great for people who don't have a lot of time to dedicate to exercise and I can already see a difference in my waist and thighs from the previous DVDs I have done after just 8 days!  I love fast results!

It is very motivating to see results and not feel discouraged from taking on too much.  I intend to buy another video from core fusion in the future.
