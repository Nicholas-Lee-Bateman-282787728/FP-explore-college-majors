6905187,4,B00R8ILDJ4,"They don't come weirder than this (probably). We meet Takefumi who is a mild mannered sales clerk whose wife is on life support and he has a young son. Well he decides to sign a contract with an agency that specialise in humiliation. They hide their front office in a cleverly camouflaged door marked `bondage'. He gets to sign a contract that means he will be `surprised' any time of the day or night that they feel like and he has to sign for a year and can not back down.

Anyway we start to meet the queens of control who all specialise in certain `gifts' to the would be submissive. This includes excessive saliva, the usual whips and a mimic - to say any more might ruin the surprises and I must say there are quite a few. As in all good films things have to get out of hand but director Matsumoto does not do things by half and so be prepared for some totally outlandish plot angles. He also goes the extra mile by putting this film inside another one where we find out why it is called R100. This apparently refers to the fact that you would need to be 100 years old to be able to get all the subtleties of the film.

Not what I was expecting at all, but still a very interesting film, the use of camera angles and SFX works too but this is not for the easily offended. If you like your films to be madder than a box of frogs then look no further.",1422748800,16,1355,4.109433962264151

6905288,4,B00R8ILDJ4,"I'm writing this review because the current set of ratings on Amazon seem overly-negative, rooted in people watching this without knowing what they are getting into. To appreciate this film, you probably need to know the following:

This is a film by Hitoshi Matsumoto, writer / director / star of other sublimely absurd films such as Big Man Japan.  He's primarily a Japanese comedian that specializes in satire and cultural commentary.  This film falls into that category. In general, his films are challenging - but if you get his sense of humor, they're very enjoyable.

Also, this film is a comedy. So, if you're expecting this to be a ""regular"" film about sex, BDSM, fetish, etc - you'll be confused and disappointed. The woman on the cover / poster sets up all the wrong expectations (and that might be another deliberate layer of Matsumoto messing with his audience).

So what IS this film about?  (Without spoilers.) I'll try to explain - but it's not easy, because (like Big Man Japan) the film itself mutates over the running time, and has at least two layers.  In this film, the main plot involves a furniture salesman who is going through a rough patch and gets involved with a strange club that seems sexy on the surface, but isn't really about sex. Yet... it seems to be what he needs.  The meta-story is tied to the title of the film, but I won't ruin what it is.

This film is a wild ride and defies expectations at every turn, intentionally and gleefully.  Some scenes don't even make rational sense, yet are some of the best ones in the film.  The last act of the film breaks down into something else entirely, making you wonder how you got there. (Another Matsumoto film trait.)

Overall I assure you that this is a film of merit, but NOT for casual, mindless viewing.  R100 is for fans of film and filmmaking. I only give it 4 of 5 stars because it is too hard to recommend to a general audience, and could push even a hardcore film nerd to fits.",1444780800,5,1967,4.538243626062323
6905289,2,B00R8ILDJ4,"I watched this for 39 minutes. Then I could not take it anymore. It is about a man whose wife has been in a coma for three years.  He and his perhaps six year old son and his father in law are in a depressed mourning state of empty living. Out of guilt or a need to feel alive he signs a contract with a dominatrix organization .  I am telling this out of order and adding my own psychoanalysis.  In a nutshell, watching people people in frail emotional states being beaten up and humiliated isn't my cup of tea.  In fact, watching people in any state being beaten up and humiliated isn't my cup of tea.  So, I confirmed something about myself. Maybe that is the point of the movie.",1444608000,,682,4.175572519083969

The humor is edgy to say the least and a few things just went over my head altogether. I'm still looking up stuff on the net that I didn't understand. That said, If you can appreciate BSDM humor (that's a contradiction if there ever was one), serious pokes at modern Japanese society and sight gags that can be disturbing for most then this is for you. Cinematography and continuity were very good for this genre. Admittedly, the script/story line is hard to follow at times and needs two viewings at least to get a grip on the story; one to watch the visual and the second to read the subs and watch again.

You keep waiting for the film's S&M females to morph into aliens and a couple sort of did with slightly differently shaped bodies towards the end.
Cheap special effects include a film overlay of a pulsation emanating from the head of our salesman whenever he is being surprised and a case of grenades (why they are in the film was cheap, dumb and pointless) left behind by the females. Used, also with really cheap explosion effects, upon the S&M females as they seek to attack our poor salesman at his home.

6905388,5,B00R8ILDJ4,"Plot? What plot? There really isn't one. Its just a loosely linked separated plot points that usually lead to no where all connected by the thread of S and M. This movie takes many many things things from many other movies. It does offer some critique of Japanese movies in general (which you wouldn't understand if you don't watch Japanese movies). Its sort of a disjointed parody.
If there was a plot, it would be this: Father is mentally unstable. He finds S&M club. Joins it, and they start bleeding into his personal and public life. S*** goes crazy, and he fights a bondage organization, looses, gets pregnant, and ends with a nonsensical 4th wall joke.
It is a nonsensical dark comedy. There is no light or open comedy. The comedy itself is non-traditional.
It also has many fourth wall style jokes. If anything you would feel more connected to the fourth wall characters, since they serve as foil to you. The movie has no purpose. Just be warned. There are many things that lead up to nothing. There is no catharsis. It makes no sense. Its not even an anti-catharsis, because you don't really know if there is one, or isn't one. The movie makes you think its going to go one way, but then it heads in the entirely different direction. The 4th wall jokes only serve to validate the nonsensical plot progression of the movie.
Its not trying to be artsy. That is not the point.  It makes fun of the artsy, the comedy, the drama, the action, the plots of movies.
It has random spots of exceedingly dark comedy. In fact, if you take away all the S&M, you would think its just the delusion of an extremely depressed and mentally unstable man.
It even touches upon the facets of S&M. Why do people do it? Enjoy pain? It was all in the set up of the character. The drama in the movie only serves to provide dark satire of the mental state of a Japanese salary man and their subsequent acquisition of sexual fetishes.
The S&M is the thread. It links everything.

It is the perfect representation of everything wrong and right with modern movies (more Japan, than Hollywood, but in general it applies to everything).

Absolute perfection of nonsense, if I ever saw one.

That being said, it was alright.

Funny thing was, I hardly remembered the title, much less the story, or the meaning of the story, whatever that was.

After reading a few reviews, I did remember several scenes from the movie. If you are looking for a story about the world of dominance and submission, or any kind of message about that world... this is not your movie. Some comedic moments were present, but I wasn't particularly spellbound by the action or story line. I thought watching it again might give me more insight, but my time is worth more than that. I have dogs to walk, and they offer me more enjoyment than this movie could, but I'm almost glad I watched it.

There are precious few movies I could use to compare with this... they also don't come to mind, immediately.  The best part was the performance of the seller.

Should be a CRIME, even if it was done in a way that was painless. I almost puked in a rage at that point. I wanted to punch the writers, director, producer...
It was quirky, smokin' hot babes, even funny at times ( as long as you don't take it seriously) until then. I would have bought it after seeing it here on Amazon Prime for free. Not now. That got serious to me.

8694500,4,B00R8ILDJ4,"R100, in my view, is a film about the natural human instinct to hurt ourselves in superficial ways to distract from the deeper pain that comes with feeling meaningless or incomplete.  We learn that no matter how much logic says that this is a personal journal, hurting ourselves always ends up hurting the people we love and, if left unchecked, will eventually destroy all of our relationships.  This dark subject matter is not approached directly as one going from it the first time might, but with a more mature viewpoint the brings awareness of the absurdity of humanity in general and the nonsensical philosophies that we create for ourselves to feel some power over it.

The movie begins with a more serious style, if not too serious, of a family in distress.  Even if some of the performances could be stronger in expressing the complex grief associated with having a sick daughter and wife, there is enough tangible there to understand what it important to the antagonist and thus what there is to lose.  He conscripts the services of an S&M organization which is set up like some evil multinational anime trope to hurt him into ecstasy.  There is no cheap titillation in this movie, despite this organization being theoretically sexual in nature. If anything, sex is one of the vices of a feeling person that the antagonist is slicing through to gain the purest bliss that comes with erasing everything that makes us hurt.

From here, the movie turns into a 70s art school style film of comical nonsense, except the film could not exist in the 70s because it is a parody of those films.  It also somehow maintains a plot and consistent storyline in all the madness, which is impressive.  Some bits of pure comedy are thrown in to keep it from getting too distressing when bad things happen, which generally works.

I don't know who this film is for.  Probably for 100 year olds only.  If you are that old and looking for a silly reflection of your own many failures to protect the people you cared about from your own brokenness, then this is recommended.",1527379200,,2063,4.7
