8548146,4,B00A83OWVM,"I very much enjoyed Benedict's take on the planet, consciousness the future of human race.  I have taken away from his lecture a new idea about the composition of the human body and the planet.  The lecture is a positive upbeat take on human nature and history which he backs up with historical facts.  For example the world is not a more dangerous place today, actually we are much safer than the human race has ever been.",1387843200,,423,4.467532467532467
8548147,5,B00A83OWVM,"This a true 5 Star rating DVD from Mellen-Thomas Benedict, I didn't think I could learn any more about the Universe & the planet we live on after reading & listening to others & doing the odd metaphysics/healing class. That was until I came across Mellen, he is the the apex of my learning I don't think any one can top Mellen & back it up with facts, data & science. In the Spirit of Gala, Mellen covers a wide range of topics & shows with data & facts the planet we live on is loving everything we do. He also ""keep it super simple"" for those of us still in cosmic kindergarten. I liked it so much I'm gonna buy it again to give away. & check out his light inventions I have one & I promise you will be a better person for it.",1384646400,5,728,3.993150684931507
