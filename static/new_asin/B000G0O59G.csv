8128098,5,B000G0O59G,"My 2 year old LOVES this DVD!!!  I have to order a new one because he will bring it to me and say ""I wanna watch cars"".  So now we have scratches on it and it skips.  My 7 and 9 year old think it is interesting as well. They will sit and watch the whole thing with their brother.  I do agree that the actors are a little cheezy, but as long as the kids like it I am ok with that.",1217894400,,379,3.5301204819277108
