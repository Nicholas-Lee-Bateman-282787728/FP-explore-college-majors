I LIKE THIS SHOW BETTER THAN THE OLD ONES BECAUSE THERES MORE ACTION ON IT AND IT NEVER GETS BORING.",1063497600,3,259,3.690909090909091
1905871,5,B0000AGWOZ,"These episodes are really good. There is no corny stuff like the old toon. Its pretty straight forward. Its more dark and violent than the old toon but it has a funny side to it too which is good. Also in this toon, i like the personality of the turtles.
Leonardo is still the good boy that is always sucking up to master splinter. but his fighting skills are succulent and hellacious.
Michelangelo is the funny one in the group but he gets a little annoying at times.
Donatello is like the 'geek' of the four turtles. He is smart and can fight really good. His fighting skills are also hellacious.
Raphael is my favorite because he is on the egde! hes a big improvement from the old cartoon. He really has an attitude and he is seriously angry. He is a guy you don't want to talk to when hes in a bad mood. Hes also has this violent vibe that comes off of him and he get pretty angry. His fighting skills can not be forgotten and his character is just downright Emaculant!
The turtles are back and I suggest everyone get this Dvd and all of the others as soon as possible. Its fabalous and you won't be disapointed!",1062460800,3,1116,4.268867924528302

7997034,5,B0000AGWOZ,"When I first heard they were gonna make a new Tmnt series, I really didn't feel like I'd enjoy it.  I told myself that if they were gonna produce a compilation of one shot episodes, I wasn't gonna watch.  But when I started watching, I got hooked.  The original series will always have a place in my heart because it was one of my childhood favorites.  But this one!  This series is fantastic.  I love how the plot  continues from episode to episode.  And the Shredder?  I love his new look and how much darker he is in this version of Tmnt.

  So if you buy this dvd, you get the first three episodes from the series.  We see how the turtles and April first meet.  We also get a brief glimpse of Saki aka the Shredder, and we are introduced to the Foot Ninja and the Purple Dragon gang.  Once you watch this one, you'll find yourself wanting to see more.  If you have the funds, buy all twenty-something Dvds at once.  If you can't aford to get them new, buy them used off Amazon.  All of mine worked just fine when I bought them in one go round, and they were all used.  And be on the lookout for future releases from this awesome series.!",1145145600,,1141,4.175115207373272
7997035,5,B0000AGWOZ,"I always liked the turtles but sadly always thought the old TV series was a glorified comercial for toys, not very well written and silly.

Being a fan of action-based cartoons for the 80s like Transformers, G.I. Joe, Voltron when TMNT came out in '87 I was very disapointed considering the comics read well.

Sadly they did not follow the comics, they made many factual changes and ""adapted"" the series for children 5 years and above...wasn't very amusing to me who was a teenager himself at the time.

The new series however is completely different, faithfully follows the comic book and is action based w/ some humor thrown in (instead of being silly humor based w/ little action), this both kids and adults can enjoy.

I reccomend this for 80s cartoon fans who expected that Transformers, G.I. Joe cartoon adaption for TMNT but wound up with a campy silly toon instead. However if you enjoyed all that silly stuff in the originals and never liked the comic book then this maybe a disapointment as it is not the same.",1098576000,,1020,4.681564245810056
7997036,3,B0000AGWOZ,"I always dreamed of the day a cartoon adaptation based upon the original books would come, and now that it has I must say I am not dissapointed. I want to clear up one major misconception that most seem to hold about this series: this is NOT a revamp. This cartoon has nothing to do with the 80s/90s series (outside of a few jokey references and multi-colored bandanas), it goes back to the original source comics for its stories and inspiration (some influence from the 1st live action film is evident also). That said, it seems, from reading the reviews of those who dislike this show are viewing it in a perspective colored by nostalgia for the old cartoon. While all are entitled to their own opinion, you are missing the point if you believe this to be a ""revamp"" or ""remake"" of the old show. It is like being disappointed that the 1992 Batman cartoon was not faithful to the 1968 Filmation produced series. They both share the same original source, but the similarity ends there. They can be forgiven however, b/c most would not except the original show to have ignored the comics as much as it did, hence since this one follows it much more faithfully it looks alien to those only fimilar with the 80s/90s show. However, even if you never read the books, I think, if you can view this with an open mind (and stop comparing it to the old show and griping over no Bebop, Krang, etc.) you may like it.

 Anyhow this DVD contains the 1st 3 episodes (based upon TMNT #2 and has a scene paying homage to the Purple Dragon brawl from the opening of TMNT #1) of the 4kids produced show that takes an opposite approach to the characters of the TMNT comic universe: In the books there existed groupings of characters (a villan, an ally or allies) that were connected in one way or another and appeared in the same stories together with the TMNT with few exceptions. Two villians never even appeared in the same issue if my memory serves correctly, nor did a certain ally help fight a different TMNT villian than they were normally associated with, the groupings were always the same. In this new cartoon we are slowly introduced to a very tight-nit universe where eventually we find nearly everyone connected in some mysterious or shady way and team-ups abound. As such this manages to be both new and unique while being faithful to both the spirit and stories of the 1980s Mirage comics. I loved seeing some of my favorite comics being retold in a new light with twists and surprises and yet still following the stories' outline. The personalities are taken from the books but borrow from the more refined and animated (no pun intended) characterazations of the 1st film. Unlike the Fred Wolf series, these turtles are real ninjas and strike out of, and fade into the shadows. Not fighting in broad daylight like they did constantly in the former. At the core of this series is the values and virtues of the family unit: brotherhood and father-son relationships, just like the original books. A fan like myself couldn't have been more pleased.

 The TMNTs and co. are big, lean and muscluar and actually look they could possibly perform the feats we see on screen, unlike the previous series' inflatable-looking puff-balls. The artwork is very cool, slighty reminiscent of Jim Lawson's work IMO (one of the most enduring of the turtles' artists), but is mostly unique within itself while still borrowing from anime (like the 1st series, or atleast it's 1st season) as has been typical for US cartoons for nearly 20 years. The coloring is the art's best attribute. Beautiful blend of light and dark, with just enough of that omni-present cartoon lighting in the shadows when they want the viewer to see what the characters can't. The bright and vibrant contrasting with the dark brings a new dimension to the turtles not seen before, since the comics were almost always in black and white and the old cartoon was not as creative artistically.

 OK, enough praise. The reason why I can't give this 5 stars is the same reason so many others can't: 3 measley episodes! That's right, even with dual-layer DVD technology available (apparantly not utilized here) that is all we get. Even without dual-layer we still could have gotten 5 or 6 episodes. The price suggests we should IMO. Anyhow on the bright side we do get a few cool extras: a short interview with co-creator Peter Laird (fans will dig this, others should find it interesting as well), a behind the scenes look at the making of this series (mildly interesting) and a look at how one of the fight sequences went from storyboard to finished product (cool for anyone interested in the animation process). The other extras either pretty much amount to commercials for related products or actually are commericals. Lastly, the transfer is quite good. Sound is loud and clear and the picture is sharp and clear. Really looks and sounds ""DVD.""

 Bottom line: At this price, for a stingy 3 episodes, as good as they are, this is not worth it. My advice would be to either find this used at a fair price or just catch them in reruns on Foxbox and Cartoon Network.

7997037,5,B0000AGWOZ,"This dvd is an excellent introduction to the new animated series. The animation is crisp and the storyline is enthralling. These aren't your pizza crazy goofball ninja turtles from the old series, these turtles have distinguished personalities. Leo is the uptight leader, Raph the rebel hothead, Don the nerdy technogeek, and Mikey the comic relief (filling in that niche of humor so prevailent in the old cartoon). In addition to the excellent character development, the new series follows the the original comics much closer, and thus presents a continuing and intriguing plot. This dvd is a must have for any hardcore tmnt fan!",1089849600,,630,5.12621359223301
7997038,2,B0000AGWOZ,"This DVD contains the first three episodes of the revamped Ninja Turtles series, basically forming the ""Mouser"" arc. Here, the Turtles are introduced, along with Splinter, April O'Neil, Baxter Stockman, and the Shredder. While older fans may be puzzled at the loss of characters like Krang, Bebop, and Rocksteady, this new series is much more in tone with the original comic books. The animation is better, the stories have continuity from episode to episode, and the new theme song has a similiar, funky vibe with the old one. While it's not as revolutionary as the Batman animated cartoons, TMNT is great, and puts the fun back in Saturday morning cartoons for older kids.
But unfortunately, Funi is the one with the dvd license. Which means that instead of getting season collections, we're getting small 3-episode discs. Why they couldn't at least give us 4 or 5 episodes a disc is beyond me. Season 1 is 26 episodes, which'll take 8 discs to cover. Do the math, and see if you're willing to ""shell out"" that much for the series. Me, I'll just stick with the re-runs and new episodes on FoxBox.",1074384000,,1098,4.7539267015706805
