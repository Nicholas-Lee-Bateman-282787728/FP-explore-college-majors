8236438,4,B00100JCZ8,"This is a great Fernandel movie. The script is great, the transfer is clean in both video and audio. The only complaint I have is the lack of subtitles - not even French ones are available - this is a problem when watching the movie at night because I have to lower the volume, hence I took one star off. That being said, this movie is a classic - if you are interested in the great Fernandel, this is as good a place to start as any other. It became clear why the script was so good when the credits rolled - this movie is based on a story by James Hadley Chase.",1362182400,,563,3.9911504424778763
