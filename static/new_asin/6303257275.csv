608337,3,6303257275,This is one of those movies that I thought as a kid was great. It had everything from cowboys and indians to earthquakes.  Then after seeing it as an adult.  It's not bad.  But not near as good as I remembered it. Looking back the only movie I remember seeing Ted Cassidy in was Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid.  Where he had about two minutes of screen time.  He has a pretty big role in this.  And  there are a lot of big name actors like Edward G. Robinson in small roles.  And  people like Cassidy and Julie Newmar and Telly Savalas who were big in t.v.,1504915200,,560,4.111111111111111
608338,4,6303257275,"Another Oldie - but a Goodie.  What's not to like when you pair up the two figures on the cover. Old school actors for sure - not like what you find now for maybe up to $10 at the box office (haven't been in years - so don't know for sure what they charge these days).  Action moves right along - just one or two places where you can go get some popcorn and not miss anything.  It gets a little flaky near  the ending  just before the hero gets the girl (you knew that was coming). It suffers minor language problems (bad mouth kind) but other than that its better than what you might find in some of Bronson's ""Death Wish"" series. G. Peck is not quite up to standard fare of most of J.Wayne's westerns (many...) but he does run a close second with many other talented actors who gave a shot a matching C. Eastwood in his ground breaking spaghetti  westerns (as it were).  Another boy gets girl movie - what else is there?.",1503964800,,923,4.1807909604519775
608339,5,6303257275,"A classic western plot, with the pace of a 1960s movie (at times, the pace is very slow!).  The plot is quite extraordinary, getting the outlaw gang, good citizens of the town, and U.S. army troops all involved in the search for the treasure.  Those of us who know the west will enjoy seeing where some of it is filmed.  The river scene is on the Rogue in Oregon!.  Monument Valley shows up.  The climactic scenes are in Canyon de Chelly.  Viewers who know some of these places, especially Canyon de Chelly, will enjoy it the most.",1503532800,,531,4.422680412371134

608627,2,6303257275,"I love westerns, but this one really reeks. To give you an idea of how bad it is, I'll describe the first couple of scenes. The sound track starts with Jose Feliciano singing a really bad song about a turkey buzzard. An old Indian is going through the desert on a horse. The sheriff, Gregory Peck, is tracking him. The Indian takes a couple of potshots on horseback with his rifle at Peck. Misses, of course, and does it where Peck has plenty of cover from huge boulders. Peck sneaks up on him, and shooting from the hip with his .45, fatally wounds him. While the Indian is dying, Peck finds he has a map where a huge gold lode exists in a canyon. Peck claims he isn't interested and burns the map in the fire where he has coffee brewing, although it's so hot you can see them both sweating.

In the next scene, Peck is digging the Indian's grave. In the middle of the desert. Where did he get the shovel? I guess he carries a shovel around  in case he might need one. He's wearing a thick black wool shirt and digging in the hot sun. You don't do that in the middle of the desert, with only one canteen of water. You throw a few rocks over the body and head back to town before you die of thirst. There's no explanation of why the Indian was in the desert and why Peck was following him.

Then Omar Sharif shows up, as a Mexican bandito, with a bunch of bad Indians, one of them a woman who just happens to be Peck's old flame, and a white woman who they've just kidnapped, who is going to be Peck's new flame. They shoot the shovel out of Peck's hand, but don't bother taking the gun out of his holster till much later. Had enough? I sure have.

With a cast full of stars (Telly Savalas, Keenan Wynn, Lee J. Cobb, Raymond Massey, Anthony Quayle, Edward G. Robinson) only Omar Sharif's acting stands out. He carries the movie. Peck is too stiff, dull and straight-laced. The women and Native American characters are stereotypes and one-dimensional. The plot is lame, with a bunch of townspeople, some British adventurers and even the US Cavalry getting into the action, and of course the Apaches. Only the settings, shot in Arizona, Utah and Oregon, make it worth watching. There isn't a single memorable line of dialog. A narrator breaks in from time to time to explain what's going on. And the ending is ridiculous.",1460419200,,2319,4.361111111111111

608748,3,6303257275,"Entertaining.  This is a beer and popcorn movie.  Unintentionally funny.  The list of guys making cameo appearances is impressive, but between the army and the Indians they get killed off real quick and are not needed for the plot.  I wonder if this was some kind of WPA project for out of work stars.
The special effects are really bad and there is no real excuse for this since Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey was released a year earlier so clearly the knowledge was there.  No identifiable Native-Americans were employed to play Native-Americans roles but that might be a good thing since the roles were gross stereotypes with really stupid lines.

The final scenes of earthquake and destruction made me think this should have been named ""Roy Rogers Meets Indiana Jones"".

Since this was made in 1969 a suppose a nude swimming hole scene was a requirement.  Julie Newmar (or her double) looked pretty good even if the red Indian make up washed off to reveal more than just her pale face.  You got Omar Sheriff in the buff as well so I guess that means there was no sexual bias.  A murky underwater fight scene was included that made me think of the underwater bits from ""Creature From the Black Lagoon"".

Summary:  Go ahead and watch it.  The story does keep one entertained as long as there is nothing else pressing.  It's a hoot.  Feel free to laugh at inappropriate moments.",1436745600,,1380,4.644628099173554

608851,4,6303257275,"A wild and crazy western. I saw it back when it was originally released in theaters in 1969. Must be seen in widescreen, as it was intended to be seen. Other than carefully hunting down the correct dvd release in widescreen, you have to wait for its once or twice a year showing on Turner Classic Movies. The Encore Westerns channel shows it all the time but only the opening and end titles are in widescreen, with most of the film in the fake widescreen format the pay movie channels use (thin black bars at top and bottom, better than the full screen version but not actually widescreen).

609108,5,6303257275,"I always liked very much this highly unusual 1969 western with an ensemble cast and recently I was pleased to see that it didn't age AT ALL. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

1. The legend of ""Lost Adams Diggings"".

The scenario for this film was adapted from the novel ""Mackenna's Gold"", written in 1963 by Heck Allen, a writer and scenarist specialised in Far West stories. This book, describing the search for a cursed treasure in the Wild West, was itself inspired by the legend of ""Lost Adams Diggings"", which spread in New Mexico in the beginning of XXth century and caused even a mini-gold fever (no gold was ever found).

According to this legend in 1862 a US cavalry patrol found an exausted and half-mad man, a certain Adams, wandering in the desert. Adams claimed that he was the only survivor of a party of miners who found a huge quantity of gold in a hidden place. However, according to him, the Apaches considered this place as a kind of holy shrine and as result killed all his companions - he survived by sheer luck. Still according to the legend, Adams led a search for this place in the 80s, once the Apache Wars ended, but was unable to find it again...

The author of the book kept Adams in the story, but placed the action in the late 1870s, when the ""Apacheria"" territory was still not settled and therefore it was a very dangeorus place for anybody except Apache warriors... He also made Adams into a supporting character, choosing instead as main heroes a brave sheriff and a dangeorus desperado. Later, for the needs of the scenario, more changes were made.

2. The film

The film begins with sheriff Sam MacKenna (Gregory Peck) travelling through New Mexico desert, near the borders of ""Apacheria"", under the interested eyes of numerous vultures...))) MacKenna is a non-nonsense, down to earth, honest, brave and very noble man, but he is also tough - very VERY TOUGH! He is searching for his old nemesis, an outlaw named Colorado (Omar Shariff, in one of his greatest roles ever), an extremely dangeorus thief and murderer.

The character of Colorado was without the slightest doubt influenced by Tuco from ""The good, the bad and the ugly"", as he is also an extraverted, loud and even cheerful poorly educated guy who has excellent shooting skills and completely lacks scrupules and ethics... The one big difference is that Colorado is kind of handsome and takes as much care of his appearance as the dust of the desert allows it.

Colorado likes to travel lightly, therefore his gang is not very big - but all of those who ride with him are vicious killers. His second in command is Sanchez (Keenan Wynn), a repulsive man who laughs like a mad coyote at every possible occasion, especially when he kills somebody. Three renegade Apaches, expelled from their tribe, are also part of this deadly outfit, including Hachita, a real giant played by Ted Cassidy, an actor mostly remembered for his role of Lurch in ""Addams Family"" series. Last but not least, there is Hesh-Ke.

Hesh-Ke is played by the sculpturally beautiful, gorgeous actress Julie Newmar, who in the 60s was very much known for her role of Catwoman in ""Batman"" TV series. Her character is amongst the most interesting in all history of westerns. Hesh-Ke is not mere squaw, she carries a gun and a knife and she knows how to use them - in fact she particularly likes the knife, even if she doesn't mind strangling or drowning people too... She must have had quite a life, as she is mute, disfigured - and absolutely INSANE! However, even if she has a horrible scar on half of her face, she is still an absolutely drop dead gorgeous beauty - and her long legged, six feet tall perfect figure certainly doesn't hurt either!

It is of course unavoidable that MacKenna and Colorado and his gang will meet  but because of circumstances which I will not describe here, they will not be able to get into it immediately - instead they will have to travel together for quite a long time... Quite obviously it will be a very difficult moment for everybody involved...

More interesting secondary characters will appear, including Adams himself (played by Edward G. Robinson in person) and a damsel in distress (played by Swedish actress Camilla Sparv), but I will say no more here, other than enumerating the actors who play some of them: Telly Savalas, Eli Wallach, Burgess Meredith and Anthony Quayle as well as Hollywood old timers Lee J. Cobb and Raymond Massey.

3. My impressions about the film.

This is an unusual western, with some fantastic or quasi-fantastic elements included, which made me think by moments of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark""... There are also parts of this film which actually seem taken straight from a Jules Verne or Henry Rider Haggard books.

The scenario is excellent and dialogs are very good. The atmosphere of danger grows all the time, the more we approach of the cursed treasure. There are some clever twists. There is an excellent opening song. Characters are less clean and there is more naturalistic violence than in most other American westerns from the 60s as well as some nudity - the influence of the ""spaghetti westerns"" is clearly visible here. This film is also unusually CRUEL - so be warned!

Bottom line, this is an excellent film, a classic and an absolute must for all amateurs of westerns and of good cinema in general. Enjoy!",1403222400,,5383,4.722814498933902

609289,2,6303257275,"MacKenna's Gold has a great pedigree, reuniting the director, star and producer of The Guns of Navarone (as well as composer Dimitri Tiomkin, here serving as co-producer) with an all-star supporting cast in a Western treasure hunt that was never likely to be an all-time classic but at least promised to be a lot of fun. Unfortunately despite a lot of money being spent, the film is almost entirely exposition for much of the first two thirds and wastes most of the great cast - for example, after going through a lengthy introduction and even more lengthy backstory, the Gentlemen from Hadleyburg (Edward G. Robinson, Anthony Quayle, Eli Wallach, Lee J. Cobb and Raymond Massey among them) don't really get to do anything except promptly disappear from the picture and add a few famous names to the marquee. Aside from Omar Sharif's bizarre casting as a French cowboy called Colorado (Columbia never really did know what to do with him after signing him to a long-term contract), the film's production problems show. It was originally supposed to be a Cinerama roadshow release before they hit budget problems and parts of it feel padded out while others look rushed, as if they're papering over scenes that were cut or, more likely, never filmed, while the finale feels like Valley of Gwangi without the dinosaurs. It has its moments and Old Turkey Buzzard is a great title song, but there aren't really enough of them.

Columbia's original DVD was a 2.35:1 decent widescreen transfer with no extras beyond trailers for Lawrence of Arabia and The Guns of Navarone (the widescreen PAL UK DVD at least had the theatrical trailer, though the making of documentary shot by a young George Lucas was nowhere to be found), but their reissue of the film is only a panned-and-scanned fullframe version.",1374883200,5,1795,4.885245901639344

1) Lobby Sony Pictures (www.sonypictures.com) to stop this idiocy (cropping off 43% of the original picture), and release it in the original widescreen format.

2) Since the British have less tolerance for this nonsense, get an all-region DVD player and buy the DVD from Amazon UK in the original 2.35:1 format. While the format conversion (PAL - 675 lines @ 50 Hz to NTSC -  525 lines @ 60 Hz) is less than perfect - sometimes producing a bit of ""shimmer"" in the image, it's not too noticeable at normal viewing distance (~20 ft).

Awful beyond camp. Beyond silly. Worthy of ridicule.
BTW, the opening buzzard story is stolen from Appointment in Samara by John O'hara, who took it from Somerset Maugham.
From Wikipedia:
A merchant in Baghdad sends his servant to the marketplace for provisions. Shortly, the servant comes home white and trembling and tells him that in the marketplace he was jostled by a woman, whom he recognized as Death, and she made a threatening gesture. Borrowing the merchant's horse, he flees at top speed to Samarra, a distance of about 75 miles (125 km), where he believes Death will not find him. The merchant then goes to the marketplace and finds Death, and asks why she made the threatening gesture. She replies, ""That was not a threatening gesture, it was only a start of surprise. I was astonished to see him in Baghdad, for I had an appointment with him tonight in Samarra.",1371081600,,1011,4.75

That being said, this movie is a mess, but an awfully entertaining mess! I understand this was severely cut for time, and it shows. Scenes end abruptly and start up with a lack of coherence. At least 6 MAJOR actors show up partway into the film, only to be slaughtered and forgotten some 20 minutes later. I guess they all got their paychecks for their short time, anyway. There's gorgeous scenic cinematography and awful matte shots side-by-side. Characters act menacing one minute, and goofy the next. The only stable character in the film is MacKenna, himself, remaining stoic throughout the whole adventure as only Gregory Peck can do it! There's a hilarious scene where MacKenna visualizes Colorado (Sharif) in top hat and tails, after it's revealed that the villain wants to take his ""share"" of the loot and hightail it off to ""Gay Paree""! Then there's the constant catfights between Carmilla Sparv and Julie Newmar. The film is full of bizarre moments like this, which make it all the more endearing. It's almost as if legendary director Ed Wood was given a blank paycheck and told to go make a western. I have a feeling that this was a matter of ""too many cooks spoil the brew"" and that the film was taken out of the always excellent Director J.Lee Thompson's hands, and chopped up by some studio hacks.

609464,5,6303257275,"Columbia Pictures calls this a Western Classic, and they are right. This is a uniquely beautiful movie, both in complex plot and in visuals. The camera angles and point of view make the audience a part of the action.

Gregory Peck, Omar Sharif, Telly Savalas, Keenan Wynn, Ted Cassidy, Lee J. Cobb, Raymond Massey, Burgess Meredith, Anthony Quayle, Edward G. Robinson and Eli Wallach, and music by Quincy Jones. It's easy to see why all these big names wanted to be involved. I'm sure that as they read the script, they were totally fascinated.

It starts with the narrator explaining about Canyon Del Oro -- the legendary Canyon of Gold. The Apaches found it, a gift from their gods. They were told that as long as they protected it and did not remove any of it, the gods would keep them strong, stronger than all their enemies. Then for awhile it was called Adams' Gold, because a prospector named Adams (Edward G. Robinson) found the canyon, and the Apaches burned out his eyes so he could never see it again. So, you might ask, who is MacKenna, and how did it get to be known as MacKenna's Gold?

MacKenna (Gregory Peck) was a marshall who had given up prospecting a long time ago. He's out crossing the desert (Arizona) one day when an old Apache starts shooting at him. In self-defense, he shoots the old man. He tries to administer first aid and get him to a doctor, but the old man lives just long enough to tell MacKenna that he believed MacKenna was after ""the gold."" What gold? The old man is carrying a map painted on deer hide showing how to get to Canyon Del Oro. MacKenna says he's been over that country, and there is no canyon and no gold. After the old man dies, MacKenna looks at the map again, and then tosses it into the fire.

But a gang of bandits have been following the old man, knowing he had the map. The leader of the gang is Colorado (Omar Sharif), an outlaw that MacKenna has fought before. As they are searching him for the map, one of the Apaches with Colorado finds the charred remains of the map in the fire. Colorado says MacKenna must remember it, because he has played cards with him, and he always remember the cards that have been played. So if MacKenna has seen the map, he can remember it. So they take MacKenna captive as their Living Map.

That, of course, is just the beginning. The gang grows and shrinks, is being hunted by the U.S. Cavalry, led by a smart, ruthless officer played by Telly Savalas. They have two women with them, one a white captive, and one an Apache maiden who has a grudge against MacKenna. They used to be lovers, then MacKenna arrested her brother, who was hanged for his crimes, and she can't decide whether to kill him or seduce him.

I will go so far as to tell you that they find the Canyon Del Oro. But I'm not going to tell you anything that happens there. The surprises are all worthwhile. Nor will I tell you about how various people were added to the gang and subtracted from the gang. Well, OK; they were subtracted mostly by bullets.

609466,4,6303257275,"While I do not have a 52"" TV which might alter the generalization, even on a relatively big screen TV, this  old fashioned Western would have looked a lot better and be more enjoyable in a movie theater with a Giant Screen. Mighty mountains collapsing, thundering hooves, daredevil riding, lose their oomph when the mountains look like studio props (except when they are stable), and the daredevil riders are clearly on rocking horses in front of a revolving screen (when the faces of the actors need to be shown). Despite this, it is still an entertaining film, wherein one can catch a genuine hero-star, Peck, and a handful of top of the line old-timers (Edward G. Robinson, Lee Cobb, Burgess Meredith, Raymond Massey) and, younger deft performers,, (Eli Wallach and Keenan Wynn) do their stuff in, essentially, cameo appearances. The later star TV NYC cop, Telly Savelas, also shows up, and, perhaps, most amusingly, so does the outstanding (when given a 1/4 of a chance) Italian actor, Eduardo Ciannelli, who appears, naturally, as an Indian (now, Native American) Chief. In keeping with strictly affirmative action principles, which dominate the casting (before legally adopted), there is the Egyptian, Omar Sharif, co-starring as a Mexican bandit. (As an aside, this picture reunites Meredith and Ciannelli, who performed so very well together, in the film version of Maxwell Anderson's, Winterset, a sentimental favorite of mine, and many others, who were around when it was released for distribution.
So, all in all, this is a Western of a style that has pretty much gone out of fashion these days (as have Western's generally). It is not the Big Picture it was intended to be, it would have benefited from editing to reduce the repetition of signature scenes, but, still, taken for what it is, it makes for a modestly entertaining 2+ hours.",1328572800,2,1849,5.003246753246753
609467,3,6303257275,"I dearly love a good Western and seek out old ones on a regular basis, but I can't recommend this one without a hefty dose of reservation, even though it makes me feel like a traitor for saying it.  It does have absolutely splendid cinematography to it's credit, vast Southwest Vistas, including some splendid shots of Monument Valley, a wild river, secret passes through canyon walls - and this was the only thing that made it bearable.  But that's about it, and while very important to me, I don't watch a movie simply for the scenic agenda, and I can overlook a lot of things, but not substance, which this story line could have produced, had enough care been given in it's direction.  As it is, I didn't feel it worthy of it's all-star cast, which included such people as Eli Wallach, Burgess Meredith, Omar Sharif, Lee J. Cobb, Keenan Wynn, Telly Savalas; and certainly not worthy of Gregory Peck, who was at his Zenith at the time; I can't imagine what he, or any of this high octane cast was thinking when they signed on, because without the photography, the script must have sounded weak from the onset.  None of these brilliant actors were able to salvage their roles;  in fact, it almost seemed as though they were embarrassed to be seen there.  Add to this a beautiful blonde kidnap victim whose hair doesn't get dirty until the final moments and a sultry Caucasian actress (Julie Newmar) posing unsuccessfully as a gorgeous Indian outlaw under heavy brown makeup, (which becomes measurably lighter after the underwater scene) and you have a moment or two when you wonder if it's worth sitting still.  But for Gregory Peck, I pressed on.

The story revolves around a legend of a remote and mysterious canyon guarded by Spirits and containing veins of gold plainly visible along its walls; a canyon the Indians hold sacred.  The legend has changed it's name three times, with the last being named for McKenna, the part played by Gregory Peck.  The concept was very good, and it would have been a classic film had it been better executed, with more attention to the details that separate the good from the ho hum, because almost all of us love the inherent aura of a legend.  Possibly the best part of the whole thing was during the first five minutes, with Gregory Peck as a U.S. Marshal shooting the old grandfather Indian in a case of mistaken identity.  The old man, the last of his kind, believed he was protecting the sacred ""Canyon of Gold"" from unworthy and unbelieving people whom he knew were coming only to pillage it's wealth.  He was in possession of a map painted on a scrap of buckskin, detailing the whereabouts of the lode.  Peck burns this as he has had his fill of pursuing the yellow mirage himself, and no longer believes in the legends, but he knows the old Indian is correct about the plunder, and he is soon and reluctantly swept along with a motley collection of characters all of whom want a piece of the action.  The map has been burned, but Peck is the man who carries it in his head, and he becomes the single most important member of the expedition for that reason; and any reason that keeps you alive while under the heavy hand of Mexican outlaw Colorado (Omar Sharif) is not to be questioned.  Gold does strange things to people and almost immediately upon the first whiff of it, no matter how outrageous the rumor, and this part of the tale does manage to be effective in a mild way.  Telly Salvalas as the rogue Cavalry officer turning desperado right before their eyes, adds a twist, but it's not enough either, because now the viewer knows what the story could have been but will not be.

But I did watch the entire movie, and maybe the scenery was worth the whole thing after all.  Where else could you spend some time in that magnificent land of harsh, mind-bending beauty, rubbing shoulders with the spirits without having to bother about taking enough water with you?",1325721600,2,3916,4.592539454806313

The gold seeker gang Colorado hijacked Mackenna to the site and the trip attracted a large group of people from all walks of life.  When they found out the Adams blinded by Apaches was among them, they were excited and encouraged to hear the story, and united to claim their share of gold.  However, each had a different fate on the way in the attack and ambush.

The two women swim compared the nude and clothed, Indian and white, savage and civilized, evil and pure in the struggle resulting in MacKenna's intervention, the symbol of law.

The small group finally made to the site on the particular day with the tower shadow pointing to the narrow entrance after many mutual exterminations.  It was fun to see the frozen montage of the gold seekers dipping into the gold river bed in silent awe and excitement in a rapid sequence.  As it is the treasure of the Great Spirit, the Shaking Rock heralded a terrifying earthquake and everyone ran for his/her life.

The Old Turkey Buzzard sings again to repeat the same story on the economic meltdown with the same profile of people in gold fever and greed.  How many people sink into the quick sand and under as Marshal MacKenna was shanghaied and the band of Colorado outlaws were in control?  Who and where is the American Spirit to safeguard and protect the public gold?  Is it true that Old Turkey Buzzard hunts for food - the man dies for wealth of gold?

Summary
Gregory Peck plays a sheriff that stumbles upon a map to a lost city of gold. Omar Sharif is the bandit who forces Peck to lead him there, after Peck burns the map after committing it to memory. The hunt is on as more and more people are drawn into the quest. With Indians and danger at every turn, will Peck and Sharif find the treasure? Will they survive? Do we even care?
Mackenna's Gold (1969) was pushed out by Lee J. Thompson as a chance to do for the western what he did for war films with The Guns of Navarone (1961), make the ultimate super-western. He hired a huge cast of stars including Gregory Peck, Omar Sharif, Edward G. Robinson, and Eli Wallach. Columbia Pictures pored 14 million dollars into the production and the film was made.
Violence
Men are shot with arrows, killed with hatchets and shot with rifles and blood is visible many times. The film has a high body count even before the action packed finale. Peck and Sharif have a brutal fight on top of a cliff. A woman falls to her death (shot with a dummy, so the scene is very fake). Torture is implied at several points. We see a man who was blinded by Indian's eyes (fairly scary for little ones) and watch an arrow go through a horses neck (fairly realistic with plenty of blood). Keep in mind, however, that this is sixties blood and will probably not bother teens or adults.
Sexual Content
THERE IS NUDITY IN THIS MOVIE! After the group finds a water hole, an Indian girl and Omar Sharif go swimming naked. The woman is seen completely from behind and from the waist up from the front. Sharif is also highly visible during this scene.
Language
Scattered h-words and d-words that can be counted on one hand.

Viewed in a modern context, the film is fairly lack-luster. The plot is decent, but rather implausible and poorly developed. The special effects are occasionally good (as in the fight on the cliff between Peck and Sharif), but mostly poorly done, even for the time. The acting is good, but the characters are not well defined. Clint Eastwood wisely turned this film down, and maybe you should as well.",1252713600,3,2107,4.5013054830287205
609606,3,6303257275,"Three stars for the film, NO stars for Sony.
Columbia Pictures released many of its classic films on DVD in double-sided, widescreen & pan-and-scan format. However, after Sony bought out the Columbia film library, it then proceeded to reissue them in SINGLE-SIDE, PAN and SCAN ONLY format WITHOUT CHANGING THE UPC CODE OR FRONT COVER ARTWORK. Mackenna's Gold is only one example of this.

So because online DVD sellers cannot separate the two versions by UPC code (and some list the wrong aspect ratio or none at all), people who buy these titles for the widescreen content are cheated. The only way to tell the difference is looking at the back cover AFTER receiving the DVD (and sometimes that's wrong too) or by playing it. This is deceptive practice at its worst.

609607,3,6303257275,"The main factor that one should remark around this movie resides in the best intentions to work out as a deserved homage to Erik von Stroheim's Greed (1924).

The ambition for gold as symbol of power and emblematic icon, permeates a good part of myths, tales and transcendental works (Wagner's masterpiece, for instance) when we have Alberich stating that he would change the possession of gold instead love.

But the best intentions (at least in this case) really fell down when an uninspired script and a very weak direction, twisted the story into simple fragments. The anecdote of the bad guy and the good guy who knows where the gold is supported by common places and untied episodes that seemed to serve as a huge introduction for the final sequence of the holy earthquake, as a clear warning the gold is part of the earth and so no man deserves to acquire it.

And so, we will watch an actor of the stature of Gregory Peck visibly disgusted with a script that simply doesn't resist the implicit transcendence of the portrait.

609608,3,6303257275,"Mackenna's Gold is a western that has a lot going for it, but it's a movie that never really figures out how to put it all together.  Out on the trail, Mackenna, a marshal in the town of Hadleyburg, is ambushed by an old Apache man and has to kill him.  But before the old man dies, he tells Mackenna of the location of the ""canyon del oro,"" the canyon of gold.  The marshal's wary, but before he can get away he's captured by a bandit named Colorado and his gang who've been tracking the Apache.  Using Mackenna as their guide, the gang heads for the mythical gold canyon, on the way encountering cavalry, an Apache war party, and a do-good posse out of Hadleyburg.  Even at 128 minutes, all these storylines don't blend well together.  It's like the producers and directors just threw it all together and hoped it would work.  There is enough to recommend, great cast if somewhat mishandled and great locations, but don't go in thinking this is a great western.

  Leading a huge cast, Gregory Peck is Mackenna, the straight-laced marshal roped into helping a bandit find the gold canyon.  Peck is good, if somewhat out of place because he's so serious throughout.  Omar Sharif is the high point of the movie as Colorado, a mysterious but cutthroat bandit, who's still likable, completely driven by the thought of millions in gold. An underused Telly Savalas plays Sgt. Tibbs, a cavalryman who'll turn on anyone.  Colorado's gang includes Keenan Wynn, Ted Cassidy, Rudy Diaz, Robert Phillips, and Dick Peabody.  Julie Newmar and Camilla Sparv are there for eye-candy, with Newmar doing a memorable nude swimming scene.  The posse out of Hadleyburg is a crazy list of great actors including Eli Wallach, Lee J. Cobb, Burgess Meredith, Anthony Quayle, Raymond Massey, and Edward G. Robinson among others.  But don't blink, these cameos are quick which is a shame as characters are wiped out left and right.

  The DVD is a bit of a disappointment with the standard presentation of the movie, and not that great of a pan-n-scan movie with some fairly obvious scratches.  The special features are a let down as well with some talent files in menu-form for cast and crew, a theatrical poster (not a trailer, just a small picture of a poster), and trailers for The Guns of Navarone and Lawrence of Arabia, but not Mackenna's Gold.

Marshal Mackenna (Gregory Peck) wasted three years chasing that wild goose... He immediately knew the place and identified it as 'Shaking Rock' but insisted to the old Apache dying chief who was keeping the map that there is no gold around there: ""The only dust I found was prairie dust!""

Before the chief dies, Mackenna destroys the map, confident it is a myth...

When the ludicrous Mexican bandit Colorado (Omar Sharif) appears on the scene with his gang, and discovers the useless burned map, he took Mackenna--his living map--to his hideout in a little box canyon and forced him to lead him to the legendary canyon...

Colorado's gang includes Hesh-Ke (Julie Newmar), an attractively jealous Apache woman who was once involved with Mackenna, Hachita (Ted Cassidy), a strong and deadly Apache warrior, and a captive girl called Inga (Camilla Sparv), daughter of a murdered judge who put a price on Colorado's head...

Okay, let me list a smattering: Outstanding cast, including Gregory Peck, Omar Sharif, Ted Cassidy, Julie Newmar, Telly Savalas, Carmilla Sparv and many more, albeit mostly cameos; one of the greatest Western scores of all time, which ranks up there with ""How the West Was Won,"" ""Rio Lobo,"" ""Duel at Diablo,"" ""Bandelero!"" ""Bonanza,"" ""The Magnificent Seven"" and ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" (to name a handful); an incredible theme song, ""Old Turkey Buzzard,"" sung by Jose Feliciano and written by Quincy Jones; and magnificent locations (Utah, Arizona, Rogue River Oregon) & cinematography.

Plus, although the story has an undeniable comic booky vibe to it (which explains why Mr. Garfield refers to it as a ""B"" movie), it is played out in a completely serious manner and successfully holds your attention while, once again, creating much anticipation regarding the legendary canyon.

Gregory Peck, who plays Marshal MacKenna, and Carmilla Sparv are definitely the ""good guys"" in this picture. The film was made at a time (1969) when characters in Westerns tended to be unlikable and amoral (e.g. ""The Wild Bunch,"" ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" and ""Macho Calahan""), so it's just nice to have some quality people to root for, if you know what I mean.

Omar Sharif plays the head Mexican bandit ""Colorado"" excellently. It's sort of an atypical role for him, but he performs so fabulously that it seems he was born to play the part. Ted Cassidy, well-known as ""Lurch"" on TV's ""The Addam's Family,"" plays the intimidating, laconic Indian warrior Hachita. He superbly fits the character (regardless of whether or not he has Indian blood running through his veins). Julie Newmar, although obviously not of Native American heritage, is great as a crazy -- and I mean CRAZY -- squaw. Red-blooded males will be interested to know that she has a nude swimming scene, while fans of ""Brokeback Mountain"" will likely appreciate Omar Sharif during the same sequence (lol).

Quincy Jones' opening score and the theme song ""Old Turkey Buzzard"" are so emotionally powerful (especially combined with the magnificent Southwest photography) that sometimes I'll just play the beginning of the film for my enjoyment, which runs a full 6-8 minutes or so (!). I've heard some complain that ""Old Turkey Buzzard"" is corny, but nothing could be further from the truth. I'll be perfectly honest with you, although open-minded, I've never been much into County/Western music, but ""Old Turkey Buzzard"" is just simply a POWERFUL composition, regardless of the musical genre. It potently comments on man's temporal nature and the insane & contagious condition of gold fever, i.e. greed, which is what the film is about.

While ""MacKenna's Gold"" certainly lacks the gritty realism of, say, the contemporaneous ""The Wild Bunch,"" it is indeed a SERIOUS film despite some undeniable cartooney aspects. One could also probably nitpick about the not-quite-successful F/X miniature sequences, but that's not important; what IS important is the film's entertainment value. At the end of the day ""MacKenna's Gold"" successfully ENTERTAINS. In that sense it's definitely a 4 or 5 Star picture.",1145232000,18,4114,5.120715350223547
609724,4,6303257275,"McKenna's Gold is a very entertaining and fun movie... if you don't take it too seriously. During the opening credits, Jose Feliciano sings a corny song about a turkey buzzard for what seems like almost 10 minutes. Pure late 60's.
But, the story does keep your interest, the action is abundant, and the acting is pretty good. Gregory Peck is good as always. And Omar Sharif plays a terrific bad guy. A very colorful performance by him.
One of the best parts of this movie is the outdoor scenery and cinematography. The majestic desert scenery looks incredibly awesome on a digital TV.
There are a couple of scenes where the props are obviously fake. In fact, it's some of the worst special effects I've ever seen. But, don't let that ruin it for you. This really is a pretty good movie if you can look past a few flaws. You keep watching it because you want to know how it ends (I won't give it away).

The real gold is Julie ""Cat Woman"" Newmar who plays a scarred, but dangerously sexy squaw named Hesh-Ke. The real mystery is not the ""Canon del Oro"" but rather Gregory Peck's (Mackenna) rejection of Hesh-Ke's sexual advances! What's the film about? The film begins with an old coot narrating to the theme song, ""Old Turkey Buzzard"". Sound promising so far? Sheriff Mackenna is casually riding his horse in the middle of the desert when an old Indian with a rifle attempts to kill him but ends up dead himself. On his person is an old Indian map, supposedly leading the way to the legendary ""canyon of gold"". Mackenna, having been blessed with a photographic memory, stores away the data and burns the map but unwittingly gets bushwhacked by his arch nemesis Colorado (Omar Shariff) a crazed bandito. Colorado and his sidekicks would be happy to finish the old Indian's job, but are willing to prolong this eventuality by using Mackenna as a human treasure map. Of course, gold is a word that echoes invitingly throughout the land, attracting all sorts of out of work character actors willing to drop by the set for a piece of the action.

I've always had a ""thing"" for the Arizona and southern Utah canyon lands.

Except for the opening credits and end titles, there is no widescreen version on this disc.  In fact, contrary to the advertising it's a one-sided disc.  I consider this product misrepresentation and a big disappointment.  With virtually the entire film presented in close-ups, every flawed and cheesy process shot appears as if under a microscope.  You can see every bad matte painting, every poorly blended green screen (or did they use a blue screen?), every transition from full-sized live to miniature.  Worst of all, most of the great southwestern scenery is somewhere offscreen beyond the edges of my television.

609733,1,6303257275,"I'd heard so much about this movie over the years, that when I finally got the chance to watch it recently I was really looking forward to it. Moreover, THE GUNS OF NAVARONE was one of my favorites and MACKENNA'S GOLD reunited the star (Peck), the director (Thompson), the screenwriter (Foreman), and the composer (Tomkin) of that film. Perhaps these factors created too high of expectations, but my God... what a weird, crappy movie!!!

Jose Feliciano's psychedelic-folk tune about a vulture [what???], which plays during the opening credits [and alas intermittently throught the rest of the film] was an omen for things to come. By the way, no wonder this guy is best known for his version of Feliz Navidad. Anyhow, Gregory Peck's Marshall Mackenna is tracking his nemesis Colorado (Sharif) when a dying Indian tells him about the location of a famed horde of gold. This revelation sets the stage of an unintentionally campy adventure about greed, revenge, race, and vultures [well not really, but Jose Feliciano seemed to think so].

There are so many great actors in this film, but many [cough.. Omar Sharif.. cough] turn in performances that make Adam West & William Shatner seem like nuanced thespians. On top of that you have some horrible performances by a couple of actors in key Indian parts. Few things in westerns irritate me more than non-Indian actors playing Indian roles as if they are Lurch from the Adams Family in Indian garb! Oh wait, one of these guys actually was Lurch on the Adams Family!!! Only Eli Wallach [this guy rocks in westerns!] and Telly Savalas breath any life, albeit briefly, into the big-budget buffoonery. The finale is so awful. THE GUNS of NAVARONE had great special effects, but the much touted-effects of this film that was made 8 years later are comical. Wow, MGM purchased a Canyon and destroyed it for the film. If the cinematography doesn't capture this well on film its all for naught!!!

Gregory Peck in the lead role makes this incredibly long nonsense somewhat watchable, but 1969 was not a good year for Gregory Peck westerns - a year in which he also made Stalking Moon [another potboiler with Anglos giving crappy performances as Indians, but no vulture songs]. 1958, however, was a much better year for Gregory Peck westerns as both the BIG COUNTRY [what a great theme] and the underated BRAVADOS were released during that time. I guess in this instance the idealization of the 1950s does hold up.",1101859200,5,2452,4.861244019138756
609799,5,6303257275,"This movie floored me the first time I saw it...it seems to take every cliched and hackneyed story line from numerous tall tales told around campfires in the southwest over the last century and weave them into an amazing pell-mell chase filled with the most gorgeous desert scenery.  The scene where Edward G. Robinson tells the story about the Lost Adams Mine around the campfire with Omar Sharif, Gregory Peck, Keenan Wynn, Raymond Massey, Burgess Meredith, Julie Newmar, and Anthony Quayle in attendance is as good as any I've ever seen in a western.  As good as Johnny Guitar, corny in its own way..(the theme song is ""Old Turkey Buzzard"" sung by Jose Feliciano.)  Just as good the second time around.",1100131200,2,705,4.809917355371901
609800,3,6303257275,"Lord help us if, in the vastness of space, aliens pick up a digital broadcast of this film and respond in either of two ways: A) They hate it for its wretched excess and Hollywoodization of a potentially good Western and seek to destroy Earth for its abominations, or

B) They love it for its wretched excess and Hollywoodization of a potentially great Western and seek to enslave Earth to produce more cheesy Oaters of its ilk.

Mackenna's Gold is an extremely good novel by Will Henry, but as a movie, it's as if some foreigners with only a vague idea about Westerns filmed it. It begins promising, despite the Disneyesque Quincy Jones turkey-vulture song, but swiftly descends to cheese as Gregory Peck (who oughta know better!) quick-draws on an Indian a hundred yards away and FANS his six-gun. He promptly hits the chief (oh,please!),mortally wounding him, for which the chief gratefully gives him a map to unimaginable wealth, and hijinks ensue. Another gawdawful scene has poor Keenan Wynn (who must be wishing by this time he was far away in Spain, making an Italian piece of crap instead) spontaneously erupting into some kind of fandango-speaking in tongues-South Pacific ""dance"" while the distinguished guest star cast watches in stupefication. This, I am guessing, HAD to be a dare proposed to Mr. Wynn to liven up the screen for the dozing audience, and by gosh, he did it! And yet more to consider to the theory that the heat of those Arizona deserts had driven the director off his rocker is the ""gettin' nekkid"" waterhole scene displaying more of Omar Sharif than Julie Newmar! Our misguided editor continually shows us (kids, avert your pea-pickin' eyes!) a fully-focused and buck naked (but legs demurely crossed-LIKE ANY ROUGHASRAWHIDE KILLER WESTERN OUTLAW I'M SURE DOES!!)Omar, while the nubile Miss Newmar is only questionably visible. Can there be any real justice in the world when the Powers-That-Be make decisions like that?

Now, before I am lynched by lovers of this flick, let me say a few good words over it. Peck, Miss Sparv, and Ted Cassidy are well cast. They fit the characters in the novel quite well. And the movie is, overall, a hoot. Well, that didn't take long. Now back to the bad and ugly parts. Eli Wallach or Telly Savalas should have had Sharif's role. Either of them can be far more menacing. And what is the point of all those ""gentlemen of Hadleyburg""? They had a purpose in the book even though they were fewer in number and less distracting to the plot. Only one of them mattered-a Tom Horn character. If the movie had retained him it could have made a real interesting star-in-cameo role-perhaps for James Garner (who come to think of it-if the movie were truer to the book-would have made a perfect Mackenna). Yes, as is, Mackenna's Gold is sort of fun to watch and I own a tape of it, but if you ever read Will Henry's book, you'll see the Hollywood hacks really made a mess of it.

609801,5,6303257275,"And it's a good one.  The movie doesn't stick strictly by any version of the legend.  It varies from the McKenna account as much as it strays from all the others.  Still, Edward G. Robinson plays a great Adams.  For me the most memorable scene has most of the characters sitting around a camp fire.  One of them recognizes Adams as 'The Adams', and they all persuade him to tell the story of how he came to find the gold, how the massacre happened, and how it was lost.  A great scene, even if it weren't about the Lost Adams Diggings legend.  Adams sat around a lot of camp fires in the 1870s and told that story, probably about the way Edward G. Robinson tells it in the movie.
The final episode is pure fabrication, but spectacular enough to make up for it.  This one's a winner and you don't need to care or know about the Adams legend of lost gold to appreciate it.
The McKenna version of the legend actually centers on Jacob Snively, the German or Duchman in Adams' tale.  Snively fought at San Jacinto, served as Paymaster General for the Republic of Texas, raided commerce on the Santa Fe Trail as a 'land privateer' for the Republic and drifted west in 1849.  The German found his talent by striking gold and starting several gold rushes in Arizona and New Mexico.  (Snively was killed by Apaches in 1871)  J. Frank Dobie's book combines several conflicting accounts given by Adams.  John Brewer's story, (another survivor) varies considerably from the other accounts.",1064966400,16,1477,4.570342205323194

This movie is why I bought a big screen (55inch) tv. You just can't appreciate this kind of cinematic splendor on a 27 inch screen. The opening sequence is terrific. The gunfight between Gregory Peck and the old indian chief is awsome in surround sound making the richoteing bullets bouncing off the canyon walls puts you right in the middle of the action. Omar Sharif pulls it off rather well as a mexican bandit. Gregory Peck...well shucks he's good here to as the marshal shanghaid to lead a band of misfits and cutthroats to an unbelievable valley of gold.
If there's anything for me to critize I guess it would be some of the hokey special effects. I still laugh every time I see the obvious models used in the near death scene on the creaky bridge.

A movie with a GREAT cast(i.e. Gregory Peck, Omar Sharif, Telly Savalas, Julie Newmar, Burgess Meredith, and Edward G Robinson), a huge budget for the time, and a poor script at best.

appropriate context because it's very special for any Russian male in
my generation (I am 33).
The only Westerns we were allowed to see
were produced by East German studio DEFA with only one star - the
Yugoslav hunk Goiko Mititch. And mostly only one plot - the greedy
prospectors come to take the Indian land and the feathered patriots
put on the warpaint, flex their muscles - they all were very athletic,
unlike the whites who were depicted as the degenerates in every sense
- and gallop to sweep the terrain clean of that capitalist scum.
But
we were grateful even for that substitute, tired of seeing the other
Red Against White flicks - the films about the Russian Civil War
heroes killing the White Guards by hundreds for the sake of Mother
Russia's communist future.
And then ""Zoloto Makkeni"" was
imported. Why? The message was clear - ""Look at these gold-crazed
American bastards! Preachers, journalists, merchants,
bandidos,soldiers, adventurers - all of them are ready to sell their
Momma's for a speck of golden dust! And this time they testify
themselves, not our East German friends."" -
But who cared about
all that? The authentic American Western! With the real Indians
instead of East German Olympic Team painted in gouache! The film's
mildly idiotic background commentaries did not make us flinch - they
fit into the didactic tradition we were used to.
And the opening
song! It was translated in Russian and sung in the film by the
Russia's much-adored sweet-voiced drunk Valeri Obodzinskij. In the
restaurants, at a campfires, in a streets the young males were singing
- Vnov, vnov zoloto manit nas! - The gold lures us again and again! -

I was 8-9 year old at that time. Seen the film weekly. The boys in
the playground asked in a whisper: - Do they show something there?
You know...- And I told them: - Oh yeah! The Indian girl...--
They really do!  Wow!- Well, speaking about childhood traumas...Once I
took my mother along and seeing the bathing scene she suspected what
was coming and obscured my view with her hand....But seriously, the
remastering crew did a superb job.  The sights, the sounds - perfect!
These were the times they were still happy to shoot in mostly natural-
maybe slightly enhanced - colors, without these annoying tints and
shades of today, when they seem to dip the freshly shot rolls of films
in a can of blue paint.
I do not know how I would see the film today
without that cinematic abstinence/communist background. Who can tell?

But I am so fond of it that even being between the jobs - a period
where every dollar counts - I HAD to buy the disc. And I do not
regret..",963792000,103,2686,4.648421052631579
609808,4,6303257275,"Mackenna's Gold seemingly has it all; an outstanding cast, magnificent scenery, breath-taking action and a haunting soundtrack.  Unfortunately, the plot is so convoluted it makes a pretzel look like a straight  line.
Gregory Peck and Omar Shariff are the headliners, as their personal  battle provides the major subplot to the search for a valley of gold called  ""The Lost Adams.""  They are almost too ably assisted by a stellar  supporting cast including Telly Savalas, Richard Kiel and Julie  Newmar.
The basic plot is typical of many westerns; disparate characters  setting aside their differences to search for riches.  However, there are  so many characters, so many sub-plots and so many twists, turns, and  double-crosses that a moment's inattention can cause the viewer to lose  track of what is happening.  This can be a very enjoyable film to watch,  but it does require some effort on the part of the audience.
The movie is  very violent and contains a good deal of adult content.  Parents are  cautioned to take a good look before letting younger children  watch.

There are some single double-sided flip discs out there which are very rare that have the fullscreen on one side and widescreen on the other.  After I bought the four movie collection with Mackenna's Gold on it, about a week later I happened to stumble upon one of those rare double-sided flip discs with both versions!

For me, one of the best things about this movie is the opening theme song,  ""Old Turkey Buzzard""  by Jose Feliciano.  It is a FANTASTIC western theme song and highly addictive!  At least to me.  I hope I've helped anyone who might be searching as I was for the WIDESCREEN version.",1512086400,,1381,4.438247011952191
