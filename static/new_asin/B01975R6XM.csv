7564822,1,B01975R6XM,"This has got to be the absolute worst movie I have ever seen in my life.  We watched the whole thing in hopes that it would somehow get better, but it just continued to get worse.

7564824,2,B01975R6XM,"""shock cinema"" about two girls with eating disorders, one has an obsession for the other and is very needy  , neither of them is pretty but one is a model . lots of really disgusting eating and filthy place . really boring at times .",1458259200,2,233,4.177777777777778
7564825,2,B01975R6XM,"Jennifer (Mary Loveless) and Jill (Bethany Orr) are the odd couple. Jennifer is a model and Jill is 130 pound bulimic. Jill's mother suffers from substance abuse and Jill is clearly not wrapped too tight. Jennifer has gotten out of an abusive relationship and mistreats Jill. Jennifer pushes Jill until we reach the picture on the DVD cover.

We get a lot of close ups of the girls eating and smacking their lips, talking while eating, and spitting out their food. They rented the apartment with the chains in the wall, something that must be an option in LA.

I imagine this is supposed to me a story of two abused people who come to live together and make matters worse. I got bored watching them eat scene after scene after scene. More drama than thriller. It was like watching ""Knock Knock"" without the guy plus food.

7564826,5,B01975R6XM,"This is a movie that simply needs to be seen.  I will do my best to avoid all spoilers with this review, and keep it as general as possible.  It plays by its own rules, is impossible to gauge from scene to scene, and manages to be utterly revolting without relying on gore.  There IS some gore, but its not the focal point.  This is a nightmare unfolding before the viewer's horrified eyes, and exists so far away from the realm of ""shock cinema"".  There is real heart behind this one, and while I would love to get into the deeper meanings in this review, I will refrain so the viewer can take away what they will from it.  It really is for people who are ok with uncomfortable scenes, though.  Too often, great works of art are discredited because of grotesque scenes, and this one will probably be no different.  So I feel a real need to warn everyone to stay away if you are opposed to being confronted with horrific imagery.  For the others; See this movie.  Do NOT rent it, but buy it.  You will want to re-watch it, I promise. Intense, brutal, sad, humorous, and ultimately the most important film I have seen in a very long time!",1457654400,6,1137,4.316037735849057

7564833,2,B01975R6XM,"This potentially interesting parable on the horrors of eating disorders and mental illness gets derailed by a heavy-handed, self-indulgent director intent on beating the audience over the head with countless and endless, slow motion close-ups of overstuffed mouths chewing food, followed by rivers of vomit. The characters are meant to be miserable, unlikable and unbearable, but it just contributes to the chore it quickly becomes to slog through the film to the bitter end--a chore that takes nearly 2 torturous hours. I would have given Excess Flesh one star were it not for the cinematography, which deserves it own nod. With all this said, the director is not irredeemable by any measure, but my unsolicited advice to him would be, operate under the assumption that less is always more, and understand that a little well-crafted subtlety goes a long way.",1468627200,6,859,5.142857142857143

Unemployed and depressed Jill is consumed with jealousy towards her cruel roommate Jennifer who is perfectly thin and works as a successful model. Jill eventually simply snaps and chains Jennifer to a wall to punish her. When I heard about this film, the short X is for XXL from the ABC's of Death came to mind. It was an amazing and powerful depiction of an eating disorder through a horror lens. I expected this film to be in the same genre and it was in a different way than I expected. Some moments were incredibly uncomfortable to watch. Any time either girl ate food, some sort of strong emotion accompanied it: lust, rage, jealousy, or self-loathing. A lengthy bit of the film featured Jill eating cups of macaroni and cheese, mostly chewing and spitting it out, sometimes swallowing and hitting herself hard in the face. When the film becomes completely dreamlike, it loses me and becomes to cartoonish. Because of a review I read, I expected absolutely stomach turning scenes involving food and I was let down. The ending was unexpected as the two women are revealed to be one. It's an uncomfortable depiction of the feelings involved in an eating disorder but externalized. I'm glad I watched it, but I wouldn't watch it again.",1461715200,,1251,4.738532110091743
7564843,5,B01975R6XM,"This movie is amazing and the two leads are fantastic in their roles, especially Bethany Orr who I was just blown away with. I can see why this movie would get 1 or 2 star reviews because it is not for everyone and some people just won't get it or think it is boring. But they are missing the incredible tension and mindfuck of what is actually happening and if you watch this thinking it's going to be a typical horror movie you may be disappointed. It is psychological more than anything and could be almost as much a drama movie as it is horror but that doesn't mean it's not terrifying. The score is great too and very effectively used. If you're looking for jump scares look elsewhere. This is a disturbing movie done perfectly in my opinion and it has a deeper meaning to it that will make you think and stick with you. 5 stars.",1461369600,2,834,4.284810126582278
7564844,5,B01975R6XM,"At first viewing, Excess Flesh is a story about an obsessed woman who imprisons her sexy roommate in a twisted attempt to bring them together -- a story of self-loathing, jealousy, love-hate, rage -- and, finally, about revenge and making right all things evil ... or is it?

Ultimately, Excess Flesh is a scathing commentary on hyper-consumerism, where more is more and where more is never enough.  Excess Flesh is the state of the world through the lens of its empathic interpreter, Director, Patrick Kennelly.  This is a world of consumerism,  a world where ones identity is determined by what they wear, how they look, who they know and how they measure up to the cruel and impossible standards -- or abandon all hope. Excess Flesh is both a seminal work and a masterwork  a view of a dysmorphic world through the piercing minds eye of the films creator.

This is not torture horror. This is a cunning complex film and the film reveals more and more the more you watch it.  More is more.

The acting in Excess Flesh is cult status. Bethany Orrs performance places her firmly in the ranks of Isabelle Adjani in Zulawskis classic Possession.  Orrs performance is not to be missed  nor is it to be misunderstood. Take time to indulge in this actors revelations of character, nuance and the human condition.  It is a visceral, infinite, and a deeply instinctive interpretation of ones loss of ones soul to the societal mediation of ones self.

Excess Flesh was a risk to make.  Films like Excess Flesh are a risk for investors.  Excess Flesh is a smartly produced hybrid genre film and the filmmakers deserve praise. Congrats to Exec Producer Dennis Garcia and Walking to the Moon Productions, for taking a chance on a film that needed to be made and for recognizing the talents of the filmmakers. Youre a hero to indie filmmakers everywhere   Make more, please.

Excess Flesh is not for the weak of mind, heart, or soul. Take a look. Take your time and let happen.  I recommend that you watch it more than once. Do it in excess.",1459814400,5,2029,4.651685393258427

7564846,4,B01975R6XM,Wow Bethany Orr did a fantastic job in her role. It gradually picked up the pace. Her madness kept getting worse and worse. I just felt the movie got a little too psychedelic for my taste. What I am getting at are the dream sequences. They where just plain weird. The movie kept my interest and it was definitely on the knarly scale. I think some viewers are just going to be shaking their heads thinking what is this with some of the odd off the wall scenes. Two thumbs up to Bethany Orr!,1459209600,6,489,4.212765957446808

8744237,5,B01975R6XM,"I don't get the criticism of this movie, after all it's pretty obvious what the film is. Close up shots of Bethany Orr (Jill) eating and regurgitating food until you want to be sick, for starters, developing into a really gross-out entertainment, harder to watch than many a gruesome gore-fest. Not for the faint hearted of course (that should go without saying), but for lovers of the unusual and disgusting, this is a gem. Great acting from Bethany Orr, well complemented by Mary Loveless (Jennifer), unforgettable, full marks.",1488931200,3,529,5.0227272727272725

The dream scenes were distracting, and honestly I feel like there could have been more gore or violence.
