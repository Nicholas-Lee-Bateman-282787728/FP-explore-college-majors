7864004,4,6304186827,I like this Video because it both eps are mostly on the kids. Jonny Quest fans deffently want this video. Besides The Alchemist it also has the Ep Assault On Questworld,1106179200,2,168,4.451612903225806
7864005,4,6304186827,I love the show Jonny Quest I wish they were a little more realistc on the danger their in as the kids hardly EVER get hurt and I think they would.. a lot more. BUt as for this video in patecular it was very well done I don't much care for the first ep in there but the second one is very good. I don't want to say to much as I don't want to give it away.,1105315200,,355,3.5641025641025643
7864006,5,6304186827,"This is the best cartoon of all time. Being a major fan since I was two years old (that was back when the lesser known 1980's Jonny Quest came out) it was an excellent change to have a reaccuring female characture in the show (besides Jezebel Jade). Personally they should bring back this show. It shows excellent team work and it does discuss some everyday themes hidden in a realm of action and adventure. An amazing combination. Plus this video actually shows the Quest team in shorts (minus Dr. Benton C. Quest, he's in kakie cargo pants) All in all, this is an excellent show...",1013126400,2,583,4.561904761904762
