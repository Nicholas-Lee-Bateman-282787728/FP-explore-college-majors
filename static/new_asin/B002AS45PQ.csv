8360174,4,B002AS45PQ,"This is the second recording on DVD of 'Ermione', which I consider to be Rossini's greatest tragedy, a regrettably neglected masterpiece. I personally rate it above any opera dealing with the Trojan War and its aftermath, including 'Elektra' and 'Les troyens' (though I'm fond of 'King Priam'). Rossini's memorable score is injected with explosive drama from start to finish: setting the scene with the curtain down, the Overture (the composer's most dramatic) is punctuated with the Trojans' offstage lamentations which are repeated when the curtain rises to unfold personal (maternal, sexual, and friendly) tragedies; the various internal and external character conflicts are brilliantly contrasted, even though a single melody may be used to reflect two or more different conflicts (eg the Act 1 finale); Rossini excels himself in one number after another (the entire opera, especially the spine-chilling 15-minute finale, shows him at the height of his musical and theatrical powers). I first discovered the work when Glyndebourne revived its Graham Vick production in 1996, starring the formidable Anna Caterina Antonacci in the title role (fortunately, a 1995 performance was recorded on video). For some strange reason, this Pesaro production features a mezzo Ermione: while she hardly rivals Antonacci, and despite intermittent moments of strain, Sonia Ganassi (fresh from an Eboli which she sang at the ROH nearly two months before this recording was made) performs with total dedication. No less committed is Gregory Kunde, though his Pirro sounds too heroic (ie heldentenor-ish) for a bel-canto role. The best soloists are Marianna Pizzolato (a superb Andromaca) and Antonino Siragusa (in addition to exemplary phrasing, his suave timbre makes him a much more romantic Oreste than Glyndebourne's Bruce Ford): I'm surprised that those two are not better known. The minimalist staging (complemented by first-class acting, including the boy playing the silent Astyanax) isn't dissimilar to that of the Glyndebourne production, though the setting is more modern (the 20th, rather than the 19th, century). Roberto Abbado conducts a version which includes some vocal ornamentations and orchestral choices that (to my ears) sound different from the two editions I know (the Glyndebourne DVD and the Scimone CD). Excellent orchestra (Orchestra of Teatro Comunale di Bologna) and chorus (Prague Chamber Choir). There are no extras, apart from subtitles (Italian, English, German, French, and Spanish), which is disappointing for for a 2-DVD set that lasts less than 145 minutes, the whole show (minus the opening and ending credits) being 132 minutes long: at least, the 30-minute RAI documentary on the making of the production - available on YouTube - should have been included. Rating: 4 1/2 stars.",1294358400,5,2803,5.4907407407407405
8360175,5,B002AS45PQ,"This is an awesome DVD.  I was at 3 of these performances last summer and couldn't wait for the DVD to appear. The DVD is a great souvenir of one of the most fantastic, exciting opera performances imaginable.  The last scene of the opera, alone, is worth the entire price of the DVD.

Ganassi is unbelievable and the rest of the cast (Siragusa, Kunde, Pizzolato,) are up to her high level of achievement.

A must have!",1251849600,8,418,4.4605263157894735
