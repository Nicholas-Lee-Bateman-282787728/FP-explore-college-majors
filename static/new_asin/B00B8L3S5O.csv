5563065,1,B00B8L3S5O,"Maybe we should let trained professionals make workout videos -- not out-of-shape reality wannabes. And who the hell works out with foot long false eye lashes? She can barely open her eyes.

The only video that may be more ridiculous than this, would be if Apollo released an educational video.",1359849600,35,294,4.88
5563066,1,B00B8L3S5O,"Phaedra looks like a ""BEFORE"" not an ""AFTER""... Seeing people who are obese do workout videos is confusing. Why would anyone want to look like her? 95% of women are in better shape than her. I guess she's marketing to the 5% of women that are in worse shape than her.

Do yourself a favor: don't waste your money on this nonsense. You can do better by using your ""on demand"" workouts that your cable company offers for free. At least you would have a trained professional taking you through a workout -- not a failing obese lawyer and some jailbird with a 40 IQ.",1359849600,13,562,4.352380952380952

I wish they wouldn't do that and let real consumers judge. I could be wrong but those comments seem to be hurtful comments aimed at Phaedra. I wanted to know how good or bad the video was not drama, like the show. I am a somewhat beginner and not so picky about mistakes or someone not in tip top shape.

I really like it because it's very real, it's not all fake and robotic like so many workout videos. The pace is perfect and it doesn't feel overwhelming. Each exercise is very easy to understand, Apollo demonstrates each exercise before starting it which makes it even easier to understand and get a burn. I definitely suggest this if you are looking to tone your lower body and have a fun workout at the same time!",1383868800,,528,4.510416666666667
5563095,3,B00B8L3S5O,I love RHOA phaedra and Apollo. But come on I'm a graphic designer and I can honestly say her body was photoshopped to the extreme specially on cover 2.. I mean a little retouching is always done but this one was is very obvious specially after you see the video. I did barrow the DVDs and did not think they were challenging enough for someone that works out everyday good for beginners.,1383004800,2,388,4.402777777777778

5563100,3,B00B8L3S5O,but I haven't gotten around to actually doing the workout.  I looked at it for a moment but it wasn't something that kept my attention long enough to inspire me to get up and work out.,1376956800,,184,4.111111111111111
5563101,1,B00B8L3S5O,"I really wanted to like this but this workout dvd set seems like something they threw together. Slow pace, I like Apollo's personality but Phaedra just grated my nerves with the silliness especially during the so called non existent warm up..I was actually embarrassed for her.. I didn't think Phaedra was in shape..I just can't get into a workout when one of the instructors is as heavy as me..Now I'll give her the benefit because she had a baby & I hope that this weight is because of that.. i'm no too sure what a a donkey booty is but if hers is an example, I would rather not..

Here is what I didn't like about this set, the warm ups were silly & ridiculous.
none of the moves in these workouts was anything I hadn't seen before & there was a lot of repetition. It just didn't do anything for me & I am sending back for refund the day I received it..

I am so disappointed in this set & would NOT recommend this.

Before the haters start leaving me comments..I do not watch reality TV & have never ever seen the show..I know Phaedra and Kendra have some kind of fighting going on I'm not sure what about. I am neutral to both of these lovely ladies. I also bought Kendras Booty boot camp and being NEUTRAL, I can honestly say that I liked Kendra's program much better although that wasn't perfect either..so there I've said it and I hate to leave negative reviews but this is so so sad of a workout..",1376438400,10,1407,4.2819548872180455
5563102,5,B00B8L3S5O,"This workout DVD is amazing, I never review any products I purchase on Amazon (oops) but I had to for this one. I have had both volumes for roughly 1 month. I am 20 YO, 5'7"" and 150 lbs. I have always been petite but I do lack in the booty area. I started out doing the first DVD and worked my way to the 2nd. Idk about everyone else, but I was completely out of shape so it seemed like an extreme workout to me. I did the first DVD 3x/wk and did both rounds - very tiring. Eventually I tried the 2nd volume and I find I enjoy it a lot better. The exercises are more interesting and incorporate more arm exercises so it's like a full body workout. I find it easier because it's more fun to do. I have actually stopped doing the first volume, I will probably give it away. Only because I enjoy the second volume so much. I used to do the 2nd volume 3x/wk as well, but I have since broken it down to the warm up+1 round every day of the week (a 30 min workout). I have DEFINITELY noticed a difference in the tightness and roundness of my booty and a lot of other people do as well. I especially notice it in dresses and skirts. I've also noticed that some cellulite I've had is disappearing. I will definitely continue to do this routine on a regular basis. Anyway, I am more confident about my body than I have ever been in my entire life. I hope this is helpful to all of you. Good luck!",1374624000,6,1387,4.028985507246377

I worked muscles I didn't even know I had!!!  It was great!!!!  And they were real.  And what I mean by that is they made a few mistakes, they weren't perfect.  Apollo even admitted that he is not as limber as he would like to be.  GREAT!!!  And they even put a white girl in there so I don't feel so bad when I can't move just right.  I just don't have rhythm, which she did, just not THE rhythm!  And on that note I'm gonna shut up before I say something I shouldn't.

5563117,4,B00B8L3S5O,"If you are looking for a fun workout, this is the DVD for you. Phaedra is funny, outspoken and energetic just like she is on Real Housewives of Atlanta (Apollo is also easy on the eyes!) The couple uses common household items like cans and milk jugs for strength training and the serene California background makes the video perfect for an early morning workout. On the other hand, this workout is for beginners.  This dynamic duo only completes about 4 sets of 8 repititions, the movements are simple, and Apollo doesn't do a very good job of educating you about the moves and how they work your muscles. If you are an excercise novice or you just want to add something funny, mild and different to your workout regime, this is the workout video for you!

5563141,4,B00B8L3S5O,This video is more than what I expected. I like the work out. I have not made it all the way through the video but its great for someone who is just starting to work out again. It takes u slowly through the steps.,1366156800,2,213,3.8636363636363638
5563142,5,B00B8L3S5O,I had to check this out after hearing so much about the workout dilemma but Phaedra didn't disappoint. I have used it for just a few weeks and I have seen results. The best thing about this DVD is that I made it through the entire workout without quitting! Great for a women who is looking to supplement her cardio sessions and build muscles in the lower body.,1366156800,2,360,4.3088235294117645

5563145,5,B00B8L3S5O,I thought that is was a great work out. I liked that is was entertaining as well as providing a good work out. You will absolutely feel the burn with this video. I began to feel it in the warm up session alone. Great video!!,1366156800,,224,4.0
5563146,5,B00B8L3S5O,"After searching for comparative reviews for the two Atlanta Housewives workout videos; I chose Phaedra and Apollo for the challenge that reviewers found lacking in the other wife's video. Man! That lady on You Tube who performed both of the exercise videos made by Phaedra and Kenya was not lying! Watching both their tapes make it feel like you can go all the way through, drink some water and walk away. NOT with this couple's Phine Body!

Phaedra does a wonderful warm up on both videos that get you sweating seriously; and then comes Apollo! OUCH! Dude is not playing y'all. It looks like it's going to be light on the first video, (you know better by the second one), especially because, like the YouTube Tester said, he does fewer reps than most trainers for each exercise; but like she also breathlessly said at her review time, thank goodness for that.  I too would not have been able to do more reps than offered and in fact eased off of the depth of a deep knee lunges & the height of the raise of a knee to the elbow for stomach crunches. I eagerly accepted his invitation to do the girls version of the plank kicks while lying on the floor. I can plank, but not kick my legs up and back and then to the side while planking. You feel your ENTIRE body when he is done with you. If you want our 1st lady Michelle Obama's shoulders & arms, you will get them here.

The 2nd video of this set is even more challenging. If you want to break a serious cardiovascular sweat immediately in warm up and throughout your workout, AND sculpt your body; buy this set and you will not be disappointed. They are not playing with you. (Apollo did back off a time or two between sets and marched in place to let Phaedra catch her breath.) The other wife's video seems more isometric sculpting with little cardio and the reviewers all said that their hair and makeup stayed perfect. No sweat. You choose. This ones for me.

I have to make a note of appreciation here for this couple too because they took into consideration that everyone is not able to run out and buy workout props. Without a word about it, they incorporated milk gallon jugs in place of bell weights, canned goods in place of free weights, and a chair when weights and props were needed. Of course if you have free weights and bells and something in place for balance and leg stretches on the chair, use them. But it's wonderful that they silently said to the world that you can work out with items right in your kitchen. Loved that about them!

If you search You Tube, the one that I rested on does not show the videos as she is performing them, but you can hear them and know that she is in fact using them if you know Phaedra, Apollo and Kenya's voices. So no faking there. I am grateful that she did the working reviews that lead me to Phine Body by Phaedra & Apollo Donkey Booty Extreme 2 DVD Set. By summer, my 58 year old body will be phine!",1366070400,14,2909,4.3400735294117645
5563147,1,B00B8L3S5O,"Apollo is ok...but his wife is a fat thighed chubette.  Who the heck would want to look like Phaedra with that body?  Are you kidding me?
My friend loaned me this video, and I spent most of the time laughing at Phaedra's jiggly fat.  No thanks.
Oh, and I looked it up.  She is not a best seller here 3 times either.  Nor did she beat Jillian Michaels.  Why would I ever take lessons from someone who lies like that?
You can do better in the video department.",1365984000,,458,4.1477272727272725

And not to mention, Phadrea's body doesn't look this defined and sculpted on the reality show nor in person. I don't think it's right to total photoshop your entire body. Not cool!

On a personal note, even though I wasn't blessed with Phaedra's genes in the booty area, I'd still rather do a workout video from someone whose booty is REAL, not silicone.  Also, if Kenya is such a top notch producer, why does her video look so cheap?  I bought both but was very disappointed and returned Kenya's video.  This is the one you want.  Great job, Phaedra and Apollo!  For a white girl, my booty is looking good! :)~",1365897600,3,554,4.525252525252525

As an attorney, I really appreciate working out with an intelligent, witty, & humorous woman. I have no interest in watching some shallow, empty-headed barbie. Phaedra is smart, funny and down-to-earth. As a woman of color, I really appreciate finding videos, classes, etc... taught by other women of color and positive representations of our bodies. Phaedra is all of that and has a real woman's body. She is fierce and beautiful! Who wouldn't want to look like her in their business suits? She has an amazing little waist with a lovely curvaceous backside. Felicidades Ms. Phaedra!!! Wishing you the greatest success!",1365897600,,711,5.033898305084746

Performing the exercises, hard work, no pain, no gain. No disrespect Phaedra, Apollo was the eye candy to help get through those hard exercises. Waiting to see the result.. Thanks Phaedra",1365897600,3,356,4.852459016393443

Video where the person actually LOOKs good!",1365638400,8,371,4.314285714285714

5563159,5,B00B8L3S5O,"Ok so maybe Phaedra is not an expert but Apollo is. Together they are a dynamic duo because you get the fun and the serious all in one. Let's face it, I hate working out like the next person. There are so many ""work out videos"" to choose from that you really have to go with what motivates you 1st. After you find what motivates you as long as you are moving you are loosing... What good is a work out video, no matter how elite the instructors are, if it is a snooze fest. More than likely it won't leave the self in that case. I personally enjoy jogging out doors, it is very theraputic and refreshing but on days where that is not possible, I am just Phine moving in my living room with Phae and Apollo. They are pratically household names and they really do motivate you to get up and move and for me that is half the battle.",1365552000,,829,4.0920245398773005

At first I was skeptical but honestly after doing the work out I could NOT WALK for a few days...the workout Tore me up! The leg workout is amazing. I felt the burn in parts of my body that I've never felt the burn before! Definitely 5 stars for this husband and wife team! I would highly recommend.

I don't want all the yapping, I want prefoessional instruction on proper form and technique, which this video did not have.  I was kinda lost trying to figure a few things out, I don't like doing an exercise and realize that because my bones are cracking that in reality my position was wrong... that is for the instructor to inform and explain on the video... that way I do all the positions right and to not make a giant blind leap and hurt myself in the process of a good hand full of the positions.

5563195,4,B00B8L3S5O,I enjoyed this workout. I am using P90X however so I will not use it regularly so I am letting my coworker borrow my set. It is slow paced and you will start to feel the burn and that feels like results! My co-worker had the Booty Boot Camp video and she is returning it. I worked out with her on that one and we were disappointed. Between Kenya and Apollo/Phaedra.....I would say Apollo and Phaedra's video is much better. I reveiwed the Booty Boot Camp video too if you are indicisive on which one to purchase. To each is their own....with that being said I want sweat and feel the burn when I workout. This video set gave that to me when I tried it. Comments were made that were somewhat offensive as far as Phaedra being more curvier but I happen to think it is refreshing seeing that in a workout video. It would be even better if they make more series and she can show results of a weight loss. Trying Kenya's video with my coworker was disappointing but that is not the only reason  wouldn't purchase it....it is her comments about someone's weight. She never who she may have offended with that comment...no one has the perfect body....not even her. IJS,1364169600,64,1161,4.4

5563202,5,B00B8L3S5O,I wanted an alternate workout to my normal routine and really found these DVD's to be an excellent way to maintain my physical fitness since leaving the military. I found the exercises targeted the lower body and core which are the two areas I want to maintain most. Great job Phaedra & Apollo.,1363478400,11,294,4.566037735849057

I haven't really done real exercise in almost 6 months since I count on my high metabolism and small frame but with summer coming I was interested in getting a nice shape.(Translated: I wanted me a mini donkey booty.) My first workout was Vol 1 of Phine Body. When I tell you I was moving, I was getting it. When I finished with the workout, I was lightlTy glistening but otherwise, I felt like I had a good workout. The next day though, my legs definitely felt a change! It wasn't a bad burn, but it was the burning of achievement. I felt good about my exercise, so I'll be doing the vol 1 every other day for the next couple of weeks and then I'll start rotating it out with vol 2. T",1363478400,6,766,4.0130718954248366

After a week, I couldn't believe it but I was really seeing results. So I rushed to get the second volume ...Vol. II to me is easier than Vol I. Either way I love the videos and my boyfriend even could tell I was doing something different.

Outta shape ppl cant workout or make a fitness dvd... I thought that was the purpose of a workout tape... To get in shape right??? Rightttttttttt... Smh. Lol,1362355200,6,335,4.25

BABIES DONT ALWAYS GIVE YOU THE BEST BODIES BUT I THINK YOURS IS GREAT. I happy I was born in Georgia and men appreciate us. Toya wright, Phaedra Parks, and Kandi aren't a size two and look at the husbands and fiancee. They look good are okay. Cynthia, Nene, Porsha, and Kenya are kinda small. There men are old, not cute, or like Kenya... MANLESS! So I don't think your body determine that much... Apollo is fine.. He aint complaining. Im thick like them and got a husband so why bash someone... What works for you doesnt work for everyone. I could have sworn a stallion and donkeys ass look the same. Smh. I don't want a manly body like Kenya. Hips and curves for me!!! Trust me the camera adds more than 10 lbs to you. I have seen a lot of celebrities and reality ppl to know this. They look like they weigh. 160 but in reality the weigh 120. Look at goo, mary mary sister and stylist on tv. Then look at her twitter pics. Shes smaller then what tv makes her appear. So im sure phaedra isn't that big..",1362355200,20,1149,4.18018018018018

5563219,5,B00B8L3S5O,"I'm a big fan of Phaedra and Apollo and they surely delivered on these 2 dvds. They made the work out fun, yet intense that anybody can follow along with them. You will be feeling the burn and working up a sweat. I was feeling the burn from the work the next day, that's how good this work out is for the body. I also like how couples can work out to this dvd while bonding and supporting eachother. You will be doing alot of squats, leg lifts, lunges and weight lifting with household items. I already lost inches of my legs and hip area. My goal is to firm up my legs and booty and I will not stop until I acheive those result.

Volume 2 is a little more intense then Volume 1, which means a little more burn and sweating, which is good for my heart. This work out dvd is fun, full of energy and gets my heart rates up. Phaedra and Apollo delivered such a great work out dvd with effected exercises that anybody can do. I love how they substituted cans and water jugs for dumbells, showing people that any items in your hold will do and you can still get a great work out. On this dvd the lunges are deeper and squats more intense. I'm having fun with both dvd and losing weight, while acheiving a nice round donkey booty.

No, this isn't hard core, there are enough of those types of dvd's on the market already which I own (like P90 x) but truthfully this is a date night DVD that is fun for couples to enjoy some active time together. I think it's creative, and what I am especially fond of is this couples ""togetherness"" throughout this family project.
