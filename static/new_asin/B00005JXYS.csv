1612211,3,B00005JXYS,"I believe this was originally a tv movie aired on WTBS but it is well acted and staged. Harry Hamlin takes on the role of a fire chief in a small but growing Southern California town. A massive housing development has disturbed the territory of a lethal new hybrid of Rattle Snakes with dire consequences for the new residents. Hamlin takes charge of the campaign to save the town. It seems in films it always falls to the fire department to handle animal attacks. I suppose that's why they call it Fire & Rescue. It has a suspenseful ending that makes this a notch above most films of this type. It borrows much of its premise from 'JAWS' but I suppose there are only so many different ways an outbreak of animal hostility can be displayed. The science is fuzzy in the film, as outrageous circumstances are needed to keep up the action.",1000339200,8,837,4.477124183006536

7942623,4,B00005JXYS,"Give it a go, Silent Preditors is not a bad movie.
When this movie was shot over here in Australia I was in it, I played Lance Parker a young boy who trips into a pit of snakes.
I am sick of hearing all the time that it is a bad movie, I would like to see any of you reviews get off your fat slobby butts and make a better one!
Give it a go, that's all I ask.

7942624,3,B00005JXYS,"The snakes in SILENT PREDATORS are some nasty critters, to say the least.  We first meet them twenty years earlier, when a truck carrying this genetically bred rattlesnake wrecks, and the snake kills its two passengers.  Fast forward 20 years and we meet Harry Hamlin as the new fire chief in a small town.  Jack Scalia and Shannon Sturges portray the greedy land developer and his assistant who refuse to stop their bombing in spite of unleashing thousands of this newly bred snake.  Suffice to say, the snakes do get loose, Scalia usurps Hamlin's power by bringing up a shady past, and veteranarian and Oscar-nominee Patty McCormack spouts out the balance of nature speech.  A tense ending in a deserted mine shaft has sufficient chills and overall the cast and crew perform yeomanly.  An above average TV movie.",1077580800,8,814,4.86231884057971
7942625,5,B00005JXYS,"I first saw this movie on Fox a few years ago. It was great! It is probably one of the most suspenceful movies you'll ever see. When a truck carrying a deadly snake crashes,the snake is set free on a small town. It begins to breed with the common rattle snakes in the area resulting in thousands of poisonous snakes! Can the local authorities and nature specialists stop the snakes before it's too late?I give it an A+!",1058400000,3,419,4.384615384615385
