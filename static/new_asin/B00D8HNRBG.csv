5777287,4,B00D8HNRBG,"The National Film Preservation Foundation includes 12 'saved' silent movies on this one disk. They range from 42 seconds to 60 minutes in length. As opposed to the ""tie the woman to the railroad tracks"" one might conjure from the days of the silents, the sophistication some of these movies show is amazing. Sure there are the ""stares into the camera,"" but the stories woven in films some shot in two days illustrate the early abilities of directors to compose their messages in a short yet comprehensible product. I preferred Treasures 5:the West from 1898 to 1935 that covered 40 early films my preference might be due more to the number rather than the quality.",1386288000,7,664,4.782608695652174

5777290,5,B00D8HNRBG,Storing Nitrate film elements long term has been the cause of numerous large fires. All of the major studios have been hit with at least one where the culprit is this dangerous film stock. As a result thousands of feet of priceless footage has gone up in smoke in mere minutes. A studio fire around 1967 destroyed most of the then-known prints and negatives of Theda Bara's work. We now must rely on publicity materials and film stills that have survived. I am an historian and preservationist myself. I'm very proud of all the work that is being put into these important finds. I personally have not worked with Nitrate stock preservation. Those that do themselves are true pioneers bravely doing very dangerous work.,1383264000,17,718,4.798387096774194
5777291,5,B00D8HNRBG,"LOST & FOUND: AMERICAN TREASURES FROM THE NEW ZEALAND FILM ARCHIVE represents the sixth installment in an ongoing series from the National Film Preservation Foundation. Previous entries include TREASURES FROM AMERICAN FILM ARCHIVES 1&2, SOCIAL ISSUES IN AMERICAN FILM, AMERICAN AVANT-GARDE FILM, and THE WEST. This set centers around the recent discovery of a wealth of American material stored away in the New Zealand Archive (hence the obvious title). As film researchers continue combing the world's archives, more and more silent film footage is being discovered. In some cases it's a complete film like METROPOLIS in Argentina or the Gloria Swanson-Rudolph Valentino feature BEYOND THE ROCKS in The Netherlands. Other discoveries are made by accident like the Mary Pickford short recently discovered in a barn in New Hampshire. However these discoveries occur, the fact remains that over 80% of silent films have been lost or gone missing so that every new find becomes a cause for rejoicing. Also a cause for rejoicing is the new technology now available that enables these films to be restored as close as possible to how they originally were. Silent movies really were a separate art form from sound pictures and they need to have the opportunity to be viewed the way audiences first saw them.

Included in this set are UPSTREAM, a minor comic feature from John Ford set in a theatrical boarding house, WON IN A CUPBOARD an early Keystone comedy directed by and starring Mabel Normand, and about half of a 1924 feature THE WHITE SHADOW on which Alfred Hitchcock was assistant director. Also included are an Edison Company serial, an early cartoon from Paul Terry of TERRYTOONS fame, a fascinating documentary on the making of Stetson hats, a comedy featuring comic strip character Andy Gump, and some actualities of then current events. There's even a Technicolor short (THE LOVE CHARM), and a hand colored clip of real Virginia mountaineers The quality of most of this material is outstanding. Not surprisingly the two features are in the worst shape with THE WHITE SHADOW missing 3 reels. The Mabel Normand short has occasional nitrate damage but otherwise is crystal clear. UPSTREAM is of interest because it's a rare opportunity to see John Ford work as a contract director at Fox. The print is scratchy but quite watchable. THE WHITE SHADOW is more problematic because of all the missing footage. If Hitchcock's name weren't on it, it probably wouldn't be here. The hand colored look at Virginia mountain people was intruiging. To think that someone would have gone to the trouble to do that is surprising. All in all another worthwhile addition to the ongoing series. I can't wait to see what the next installment will contain.",1380153600,24,2741,5.050772626931567
5777292,5,B00D8HNRBG,"The National Film Preservation Foundation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to saving America's film heritage, has made available on DVD 13 titles believed to have been lost. Held in the New Zealand Film Archive, these films weren't seen in the U. S. for nearly a century, and include works by important filmmakers like John Ford, Alfred Hitchcock and Mabel Normand. This compilation gives us a valuable sampling of various types of films from 1914-1929: Short subjects, animated cartoons, previews, dramas, comedies, serials, and travelogues. These particular titles have some notable significance be they technically innovative or containing artistic, historic, and cultural interest. All are off tinted, nitrate source prints, some of which were rescued just in time as they contain portions that have begun to decompose. Other than that, the images are sharp with excellent contrast.

Here's the line-up:

LYMAN H. HOWES FAMOUS RIDE ON A RUNAWAY TRAIN (1921), a great short film shot in subjective camera from the front of a speeding train engine.

THE HAPPY-GO-LUCKIES (1923), a frenetically paced cartoon by pioneer animator Paul Terry.

STRONG BOY Preview (1929), a trailer for the lost film directed by John Ford and starring Victor McLaglen.

UPSTREAM (1927), a full length feature directed by John Ford set in a boarding house for actors starring Nancy Nash and Grant Withers. The film offers another side to Ford's work we don't see as much of.

BIRTH OF A HAT: THE ART AND MYSTERY OF MAKING FUR FELT HATS (1920), an educational short depicting the manufacturing process of a wardrobe staple from the era.

THE LOVE CHARM (1928), a one-reel South Seas drama directed by Howard Mitchell shot in two-color Technicolor, and starring Ann Christy.

WON IN A CUPBOARD (1914), a one-reel Keystone comedy directed by and starring Mabel Normand.

THE ACTIVE LIFE OF DOLLY OF THE DAILIES: EPISODE 5, THE CHINESE FAN (1914), this was a 12 chapter serial from the Edison Company directed by Walter Edwin starring Mary Fuller.

STORIES FROM AMERICAN NEWSREELS: CO-OPERATIVE WEEKLY REVIEW (1918), a World War I homefront news report, and SELZNICK NEWS (1921), which was partially compiled from a travelogue of the period.

ANDY'S STUMP SPEECH (1924), a two-reel comedy directed by Norman Taurog about an unlikely presidential candidate played by Joe Murphy.

VIRGINIAN TYPES: BLUE RIDGE MOUNTAINEERS (1926), a travelogue in hand-stenciled Pathecolor.

THE WHITE SHADOW (1924), an incomplete print of Alfred Hitchcock's earliest film in existence for which he was the assistant director/editor/art director, starring Betty Compson in a dual role and Clive Brook. Three out of six reels survive.

The music scores were composed by Michael Mortilla and Donald Sosin, and the DVD includes interactive screens about the films as well as an illustrated catalog with film notes and credits. Proceeds from sales will go toward supporting film preservation. This eye-opening, 3 1/2 hour compilation of never before available rarities is sure to captivate any lover of early cinema, and it gets my highest recommendation.",1379980800,33,3110,5.320408163265306

8590589,5,B00D8HNRBG,"I've been a journalist all my life, covering a wide range of subjects. But from my undergraduate days in the early 1970s until today, I've had a special interest in film studies. And, given my era of studying film as an undergraduate, Hitchcock was all the rage. This was the era when film studies was highly influenced by the milestone:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hitchcock-Revised-Edition/dp/0671604295/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hitchcock (Revised Edition)</a>&nbsp;Hitchcock (1899-1980) will still alive; he was still releasing movies; and I can remember, as a student, being in awe of his career as one of our greatest (as the French would say) ""auteurs.""

Whether you're that deeply engaged with Hitchcock's work -- a life-spanning fascination -- or you're simply a fan of his classics -- the fact is that the early years of Hitchcock's career were ""taught as lost"" back in the early 1970s. Everybody started watching his body of work with ""The Lodger"" and the silent era was pretty much a big question mark. Now, we're all able to enjoy some of the early works. I have to admit, knowing his later work, I'm a fan of the 1925 ""Pleasure Garden."" Sure, it's a silent with lots of flaws, but you can see so many of Hitchcock's later themes and cinematic stylings in that movie. I even like ""The Ring,"" despite the poor quality of most prints of that silent boxing drama. Again, we see Hitchcock's artistry at work even in a fairly hackneyed tale that was an early precursor to ""Rocky.""

Well, this is all a lead up to saying: As far as I can see, this collection is the only place to see the surviving remnants of Hitchcock's earlier silent, ""The White Shadow."" I bought this collection a few years ago and watched a couple of the selections. I enjoyed them -- but I somehow failed to notice the Hitchcock fragment in the collection. Only more recently, reading about efforts to recapture the early body of Hitchcock's work did I realize that the surviving reels of White Shadow are in this set!

No one even knew that the film existed until the 2011 announcement that half the film had been found in New Zealand. The print of this fragment was shown in a couple of major U.S. cities. The sound track is original and, if you're a fan of silent film, you know that it's a pleasure to find an original sound track of this quality. (Lots of silents are released on DVD with fairly random clips of music attached.)

In looking back onto the Amazon page, I see reviews praising this set. But I wanted to stress the Hitchcock ""find"" on this DVD. Perhaps this is too obscure for most movie fans -- but, if you've had a long-time fascination with his work, then I urge you to pick up a copy of this set.",1472860800,4,2746,4.786919831223629

8590596,5,B00D8HNRBG,I was drawn to purchasing this set of newly discovered missing silent films for two titles included: John Ford's UPSTREAM and the surviving portion of THE WHITE SHADOW which is the earliest material we have of Alfred Hitchcock. I'd seen a YouTube screening of the Hitchcock work and was impressed with how well done the special effects of actress Betty Compson playing twin sisters was. Both UPSTREAM and THE WHITE SHADOW are very nicely scored. And there are other gems included on the disc. One that is quite delightful is the 1921 RIDE ON A RUNAWAY TRAIN that was shown in smaller theatres with a prerecorded sound effects record. This film was very popular with audiences of the day providing the kind of thrills that THIS WAS CINERAMA did with its roller-coaster ride years later. THE LOVE CHARM shows off early Technicolor. The detailed notes about each film are excellent. It's very exciting that film long though lost is being discovered and that it is being offered in such fine form as the LOST & FOUND AMERICAN TREASURES series.,1388793600,7,1039,4.810055865921788
