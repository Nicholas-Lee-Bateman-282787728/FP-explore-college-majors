2839109,4,B000QPECNK,"No matter what you may think of this film, it delivers the goods.  Director Joaquin Romero Merchant almost does a tribute to Sam Peckinpah's 'THE WILD BUNCH' but in a very different way.  'CUT THROATS NINE'-1973 is a totally isolated foray of an army officer and his beautiful daughter who are escorting a chain gang of brutal criminals over the Rocky mountains in dead winter to a fort to stand trial for their crimes. The film intensifies when the prisoners realize the chains that are binding them are made of pure gold,  Every calamity befalls these two characters with fantastic twists and turns within the screenplay by Joaquin Romero Hernandez and Santiago Moncada.  By the time you reach its blood soaked finale, the term 'survival of the fittest' is an understatement.  With the bleakest cinematography by Luis Cuadrado making you actually shiver with cold along with the actors and intense POV film making by Director Merchant, the film emerges as a Western Horror film of the first order never letting up.  Not recommended for all viewers, its a gritty experience and every lover of intense film making should see it.  Eurovista releases it in a nice 1.85 transfer and includes an American and German trailer, publicity gallery and talent bios. You have been warned now click the add to cart button and have your senses tested by an excellent balls to the wall European Movie experience.",1302480000,,1398,4.898305084745763
2839110,2,B000QPECNK,"Well, maybe this is the most violent Eurowestern ever made, but that's relative. All the violence is very much IMPLICIT rather than explicit and it all looks a bit tame to modern eyes. During the 'rape' scene, for example, it's all about focussing on the faces rather than the event, which means that 'Chato's Land', as a very basic comparison off the top of my head, is far more raw, brutal, violent, believable and enjoyable.

And obviously there's more to a film than simple violence. This movie is just downright grim, from the characters to the stark landscape.

With no redeeming qualities, this film is extremely disappointing. Unless you really have to watch every Eurowestern ever made, avoid this one and look for something a bit more special and not as overrated.",1200787200,3,774,4.856060606060606

8196717,5,B000QPECNK,"Even back when moste of these movies were only available on boot leg, Cut-Throats Nine has such a big reputation among the Euro-Westerns of the 60s and 70s. First off, this Spanish western has always been infamous as one of the most violent of these pictures, even going against the sequences Ruggerio Deodatto directed for Corbucci's Italian westerns. Also, it recently became the main inspiration for Quentin Tarantino's Hateful Eight, utilizing Cut-Throats Nine's story line of the prisoner transport at a stand still as well as Nine's later flashbacks that reveal the hidden motivations behind key players. This direct relation is muddied a little by Tarantino's bizarre choice of cross-breeding Nine's story with the 1956 Marilyn Monroe picture Bus Stop, even if Bus Stop was originally Shot in CinemaScope. Historical significance aside, this is an excellent picture and definitely a must see for fans of the European Exploitation scene, alive and well in the depths of Amazon Prime",1456099200,,988,5.2594936708860756

8196719,4,B000QPECNK,I loved Cut Throats Nine!  I bought this blind because it sounded interesting and I was shocked at how violent and gory it was.  So much fun!  There's a thread of horror running through the entire film and the gore effects only added to it.  I don't remember Joshua as well but I remember enjoying it too.  This is a fantastic double bill DVD and I highly recommend it.  Cut Throats Nine is the highlight.  My only quibble was seeing the horses plunge off the road while still attached to a rampaging stagecoach.  I don't like seeing animals being frightened or hurt that way for a film.,1396396800,3,587,4.420560747663552
8196720,5,B000QPECNK,"First off, I'm reviewing the possibly now out-of-print Limited Edition version of the 1972 Spanish ""spaghetti"" western CUT-THROATS NINE released by Eurovista Entertainment. I have NOT yet viewed the easily obtainable CODE RED DVD version. I was a bit skeptical about the quality of this release but was stunned by its quality. The film is presented in widescreen 1.85:1 and was obviously taken from a high quality uncut print. There were several explicit scenes which I had not seen in older VHS versions. The picture quality is excellent but most impressive is the sound. Often critized for its poor dubbing, this DVD with excellent sound quality makes me wonder what all the fuss was about. The dubbing is quite good for a film of this budget and as a Spanish production. Overall, I was MORE than satisfied with all the technical aspects of this DVD release.

For too many years CUT-THROATS NINE(with solid direction from Joaquin Luis Romero Marchent)has been casually scorned as a crappy Spanish spaghetti western with gratuitous gore and nothing else. This is a SHOCKING mischaracterization of this film! YES it is a genre film with lots of gore. However, the story is quite original, the film is technically well-made(with considerations made for the low budget, etc.), features quite alot of style(such as the freeze-frame/flashbacks to an important event in a character's life just before their death-a device used brilliantly to answer the question of which of the prisoners killed the captain's wife and his daughter's mother) and due to its winter setting(think THE GREAT SILENCE, a film which is held in high esteem, is one of my favorite films, but is for all intensive purposes NOT that much superior to CUT-THROATS NINE in any technical sense, although they are very different films despite their similarities) is one of(if not the) bleakest, most desperate, nihilistic, and just mean-spirited westerns ever made. Even without the extreme gore(which at times approaches Lucio Fulci film levels...seriously), this is a solid film, albeit certainly NOT for fans of traditional westerns. There are NO heroes in this baby and no one escapes the winter hell they've been cast into. One of the most fascinating angles of the film is the subplot of using expendable, undesirabele, cast-away, criminals as cover for capitalist interests(in this respect the film is not apolitical but arguably anti-capitalist, anti-military, and anarchistic in tone).

Rather than give a detailed description of the plot and spoil the fun, I'll conclude by saying that this is a film which is MUST-SEE material for genre-film fans(spaghetti western, Euro-exploitation films, historians of on screen extreme violence graphically depicted, etc.). But furthermore, like the brilliant GREAT SILENCE, this is a truly well-made and worthwhile film! If you are comparing it to THE SEARCHERS or even THE WILD BUNCH you probably will be disappointed. CUT-THROATS NINE was a low-budget film meant to make money in the grindhouse theaters of American cities. But let us not forget that many of those grindhouse films(which were initially mocked, ignored, scorned, etc., by critics and the press) are now considered legitimate classics...CUT-THROATS NINE may never achieve THAT status but as far as CULT CLASSICS are concerned this disturbing 1972 film's got it all!

NOTE: For those of you who are simply curious as to the gore goods delivered in this film we have: up-close throat slitting, TWO different burning scenes(one man while still alive) in which melted/semi-skeletal faces are graphically shone, feet cut off with machete(up close), man stabbed in stomach with machete, then hung on meathook(viscera protruding), bullet to the eye(including smashed bits of eyeball, etc., a VERY well done effect), a woman point blank shot in the head(brain, skull fragments protrude), woman stabbed in abdomen releasing viscera and very realistic blood, rape, torture, delerium tremens, etc. There's more, but you'll have to watch the film!

But REMEMBER, while yes this film is extremely gory for its time(and even holds up quite well today if you have any perspective and are not obsessed with modern CGI gore fx that look SO fake it's laughable and belong in video games not movies), it is NOT the gore which makes the film. It is the atmosphere of utter desolation, deperation, degeneration into barbarity, and the nihilism of the brilliant ending which makes CUT-THROATS NINE a film deserving of FAR more artistic respect than it has received.",1345766400,2,4521,5.223140495867769
8196721,4,B000QPECNK,"I got this DVD cause I have heard a lot about Cut Throats Nine, mainly that it is one of the bleakest and goriest westerns of the era (which is saying a lot considering this was released the same time the Italians were really pushing the envelope in terms of violence with their westerns). And it is true, I was expecting scenes of people getting riddled with bullets or scalped by Native Americans but instead I got these long Fulciesque, lingering shots of the aftermath of mutilation and murder... it is really nauseating. The story is also very bleak and there is a constant feeling of hopelessness from the beginning to the end of the film. At the same time, I think the film is very well acted and the story is quite compelling, even throwing in a predictable but nice little twist. Another thing I liked a lot about the movie is the locations, it's mainly shot outdoors in some truly beautiful snow covered mountain ranges. All in all, though quite unpleasant, I do think Cut Throats Nine is a well made and intriguing movie.

The other movie that came with the DVD is Joshua, one I had never heard of. It's sort of a blaxploitation western starring none other than Fred Williamson who starred in many other blaxploitation flicks, including the totally cool Black Caesar. Here he is a man of few words, out for revenge against the people that murdered his mother. The plot is totally cliche but it works and even though Fred isn't as cool as he is in some of his other efforts, he still lends a lot to the movie just by sitting there on his horse and looking like a hard ass. It's not a memorable movie but it still manages to be an entertaining one. One question that kept coming up in my head is, ""did blue jeans exists back in the old west?"" cause almost everyone in this movie is wearing blue jeans.

The DVD from Code Red is nice, I like these double bill DVDs that they are releasing. There are not really any special features but there is the ""42nd Street Experience"" that plays both movies in a row with trailers before and in between. I recommend, if you are patient enough to sit through 2 movies, to try the 42nd experience cause it's how these films might have been viewed back in the day.

I guess of the 2, I thought Cut Throats Nine was the best but Joshua was definitely a more enjoyable watch. If you are into old grind house/exploitation/western movies I think this is well worth picking up. It's 2 movies for the price of one, neither are amazing but neither are bad either and I promised you will be entertained!",1327363200,5,2539,4.43254817987152
8196722,2,B000QPECNK,"An interesting story not very well executed. Kind of fun as an experiment in making a Gory Western and definitely with a dark view of humanity.

The story is set in Idaho but filmed in Spain. I grew up in the area where the movie is supposed to take place and the exteriors filmed in the Pyrenees mountains look surprisingly like they were filmed in the Central Idaho mountains.",1324684800,,378,4.478260869565218
