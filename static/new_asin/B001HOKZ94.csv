8309273,3,B001HOKZ94,"Gasolin were/ are the most popular rock group in Denmark ever. They had an enormous impact on the country and it is said that one Dane in 4 or so has an album. This DVD is a documentary that recounts their journey from the 60's until thier dissolution. It mainly consists of a series of long in-depth interviews with the band members and there is unfortunately very little musical parts which is unfortunate. Gasolin' made a unique blend of hard rock, pub rock and sometimes folk that was quite unique and very suited to the Danish. This is not very well reflected in the documentary: here there is a very long discussion about their simple beginnings and then about their stardom and the trip to the USA which bankrupted them. Unfortunately their often very original music is not discussed and their recordings should have been dealt with more; indeed thier recorded output was excellent and very varied. They shortly  mention Roy Thomas Baker who had an important role in producing them. While it is obvious that there were great tensions in the bad that led to its dissolution, and to the eventual scandinavian superstardom of its singer Kim Larsen. For anybody with an interest in the band it is a very interesting even if pretty flawed attempt since instead of providing a clear storyline of the band it simply focuses on the rather loose ramblings of its members.",1273363200,2,1369,4.7521008403361344
