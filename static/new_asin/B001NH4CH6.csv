8327032,1,B001NH4CH6,"I love musicals but I was deeply disappointed this series. The authors almost completely ignored Frank Sinatra at all. In the 50s he was the singer number one and he was one of  ten highest-grossing actors. He had a lead role in 9 musicals. He received Golden Globe for 'Pal Joey'. His 7 songs have been nominated for Oscar and three of them got it. There were no word about 'Young at Heart', 'The Tender Trap', 'High Society', 'The Joker Is Wild', pair of frames from 'Pal Joey' and 'Can-Can'. There were no word about his second lead role in 'Guys and Dolls'. It seems the authors were so ignorant that they didn't know about Frank Sinatra's work or they loathed him so much that they decided to remove him completely from the musical history of Hollywood. The authors are taking the time to say about Elvis's bad movies and mediocre movie 'Let's Make Love' with Marilyn Monroe. They have devoted an enormous amount of time to Gene Kelly but almost nothing about Sinatra for the 6 series, since the 40s until the 60s. It's shame.",1344038400,3,1031,4.543010752688172
