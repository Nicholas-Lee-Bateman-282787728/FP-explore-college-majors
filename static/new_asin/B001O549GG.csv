3728978,5,B001O549GG,"Four films, each a little over an hour long, provide fascinating glimpses of pre-war Japan.  Maybe the best way to describe their charms is to provide some details about two of them.

In THE MASSEURS AND A WOMAN, two blind men who make tenuous livings as migratory masseurs, moving from seaside resorts to mountain spas each summer, are walking along the road, counting and taking pride in the number of sighted people they overtake - seventeen so far.  One alerts the other that he senses eight and a half children are approaching.  Eight and a half?  Yes, one of the children is carrying another piggyback.  Later on the journey, a wagon passes them, and the same masseur somehow detects from her scent that one of the passengers is an exciting woman from Tokyo, who, as the film progresses, carries on a flirtation with him and also with a potential rival, a young man on vacation with his orphaned pre-teen nephew, who with his baseball cap and intolerance of adults could have stepped out of a fifties Ozu movie.  The woman turns out to be on the run, and perhaps both suitors will be disappointed.

ORNAMENTAL HAIRPIN, also set in an inn, relates the blossoming romance between a young soldier (Ozu's favorite actor, Chishu Ryu) and a geisha who wants to leave her profession and marry.  The soldier, in the inn's public baths, cuts his foot on a hairpin left behind by the geisha, and she returns to the inn,  apologizes, helps him recover as he takes more challenging walks each day, and falls in love with him.  Meanwhile, we meet many of the inn's guests and discover  their eccentricities in casual scenes.  For instance, they decide to form a discussion group (led by a crusty old professor who somehow maintains his dignity even while waking the others with his snoring each night), and the first topic is to complain about the inn's food - every day breakfast is the same: miso soup, egg, sea weed, and pickles; dinner is invariably sashimi, grilled fish, soup, and boiled greens.  Finally, recovered, the soldier returns to Tokyo, and the closing scenes, in which the geisha realizes her dreams of marriage will end in disappointment, are somehow heartbreaking and unsentimental at once.",1245715200,28,2202,4.791005291005291
3728979,5,B001O549GG,"Criterion's bare-bones Eclipse line continues its winning streak with another excellent package of films, this time from Japanese director Hiroshi Shimizu.  A contemporary of Ozu's, and with a similarly long-lasting career, Shimizu's relatively unknown in the West, but these pictures serve as a sterling introduction to his work.  The ""travels"" in the package title are literal as well as figurative -- not only do these movies cover a lot of ground, with fascinating shots of various Japan locales in the 1920s-40s, Shimizu is fond of rapid horizontal tracking shots and dissolves that give his work a dynamic feeling.  These films are nicely acted, filled with gentle humor and touching humanity, and provide a fascinating exploration of a society in transition between traditional ways and the modernism of the twentieth century.  According to the liner notes, Shimizu liked to work from actor improvisation, rather than fully written scripts, and that impulse pays off with work that feels as fresh as if it were done yesterday.  Here's one trip any lover of Japanese cinema will find richly enjoyable.",1238976000,35,1107,5.267045454545454

8329662,5,B001O549GG,"what an adventure, being introduced to the works of yet another superlative japanese screen artist!  after watching 'mr. thank you' two days ago i am still haunted by it's many images and sensations:  the smell and feel of the dusty country air, the sun on the trees, the faces of the diverse passengers aboard a simple country bus.  we join in the ride as it climbs through mountains and valleys, pausing to take on new people, making it's leisurely run to the sea.  our driver, 'mr. thank you' (played, by the handsome and stalwart ken uehara) navigates his vehicle through terrain alternately harrowing and boring, calling out 'arigato!' to everyone he passes.  folks get on or off while some stay aboard for the full length of the ride.  taken from a novel by yasunari kawabata, it's tone is gentle, perceptive and generous.  the same can be said for 'the masseurs and a woman,' which i viewed tonight.  it's imbued with the same sense of quiet discovery that enlivened 'mr. thank you,'  an invitation to enter a private and very special world.  we visit an isolated mountain spa, watch the visitors traverse the roads, eavesdrop on their conversations, speculate on their motives.  most are city dwellers, ordinary folk escaping Tokyo for a brief vacation.  the most remarkable character is the blind man employed by the local hotel to ease (or exacerbate!) the aches and pains of the guests.  he is the hero and focal point of the story and we grow to actually SENSE what he is discovering about the people he encounters.  along with the resplendent views of humanity Hiroshi Shimizu offers us,  we are granted access to a gentle way of life which will soon be unalterably changed.  no doubt these roads will soon be paved over, opened to traffic, exposed, lost forever...  yet they survive in these warm-hearted films.  'Arigato!' to Criterion for once again giving us a unique glimpse into a vanished world.",1430611200,,1915,4.822085889570552
8329663,3,B001O549GG,"MR. THANK YOU

Rating = ****

A film you don't want to end! Film = four stars; restoration = 2-1/2 stars. A charming, engaging, and ultimately mesmerizing gem from director's Hiroshi Shimizu's canon. The title is the name given by the locals to a uniformed (right down to the traditional white gloves), exceeding polite, and exceptionally considerate driver of a small bus that connects country folks with the outside world. ""Thank you"" (arigato) is a salutation the driver never fails to use when walkers and trudgers allow his bus to pass on narrow dirt roads. They typically respond with ""Arigato-san"" (Mr. Thank You). It's only a dozen or two miles that are traveled, but a lot can (and does) happen during this particular trip. A time capsule of rural Japan in the midst of the Great Depression (circa 1936) and the director's conception of its inhabitants. The driver is quite sharp looking in his uniform, has the eye of all the women (both off and on the bus), and is a humanitarian and psychologist as well as a competent wheels man.  Comedy (there are some hilarious one-liners not lost in the subtitles), poignancy, sadness, optimism/hopefulness, and a myriad of other emotional facets are provided by a group of talented (and engaging) character actors.  It's remarkable how quickly the viewer is empathetically pulled into the characters' slices of lives without fully realizing it. The hallmark of a great story teller! Interestingly, no one seems to pay for a bus ride. Sound is subpar and artificial even by contemporary standards--the film seems to have been shot silently and later end-to-end dubbed (not unusual during the very early talkie days (circa 1930), but since abandoned in most of the West). The picture is relentlessly fuzzy which may be the result of having to use inferior film stock and/or a primitive printing process. But Shimizu rises above the marginal quality of the cinematic tools at his disposal to get his stories across! As for the restoration, it seems to have removed wear and tear as well as reel change-over artifacts, but should have worked A LOT HARDER at clarifying the image digitally. Shimizu-san arigato gozaimashita!

JAPANESE GIRLS AT THE HARBOR

Rating = ***

A ""three hanky"" rough cut movie. Film = three stars; restoration =  star. An excellent, historic film with intertitles instead of subtitles (since it's silent). Restoration is in evidence, but cutting artifacts (between shots) remain in this version (was the original source material a rough-cut version?).  These artifacts occur between EVERY scene and are MAJOR distractions.  Directing/editing is often startling and usually first rate. Acting is hammy and more appropriate for live theater than a movie theater.  It circles back to what was considered normal when photoplays first emerged in the first decade of the 20th century. Makeup (ranging from over-the-top to essentially none) does not help matters. Indoor sets are minimalistic if not down right primitive.  A major plot point (involving firing a gun in a church) remains unclear as to just what happened.  A fundamental directing flaw/oversight. The piano score (for this version) is distinctive and highly imaginative.  Rather unusual for a silent film not accompanied by an orchestra, they are written to integrate with rather than distract from what's on the screen. There is no happy ending in evidence for any character--tragedy city big time!

ORNAMENTAL HAIRPIN

Rating = ***

Warm, engaging, funny, and often hilarious!  Film = three stars; restoration = two stars.  Yet another (restored) film by director Hiroshi Shimizu that leaves the viewer wishing that things could have gone on a bit longer.  The measure of not only a great director, but also a master showman!  The extremes to which a group (including the ""victim"" of the hatpin ""attack""--he stepped on it in a shallow pool) at a summer spa (all guests seem to be there because of discounted rates) will go to in order to see what the owner of the pin looks like are something to behold.  And what the victim does to court the hairpin owner (even resorting to crutches to generate symphony) is fall-down funny.  A typical Shimizu slice of life movie with many possible outcomes all left, as usual, to the viewer's imagination/contemplation.  Cinematography is OK except for out-of-focus and over-exposed outdoor scenes that start the film off (given the jerky camera movements, it looks like tracking was not used, and the scenes were simply shot from a car trunk or the back of a truck).  End-to-end dubbing is primitive with effects sounds especially artificial.  Why the juvenile actors are dubbed as always SHOUTING their lines remains a distracting/grating mystery.  Continuity suffers when characters say something has taken place, but subsequent scenes show otherwise.  Score is written and performed at the level of, say, a grade school band--it's simply terrible and an embarrassing distraction.  Acting is fine as are the subtitles.  Restoration remains a work in progress as far as cleaning up over exposures, visible deterioration, and especially the audio.  Sound artifacts are ever present.  A fine film that rises above the primitive techniques employed in its manufacture and the marginal restoration presented on this disc.  WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD.

THE MASSEURS AND A WOMAN

Rating: **

A small movie that progressively diminishes in the eyes of the viewer. Film = two stars; restoration = four stars.  All directors have bad hair days including Hiroshi Shimizu.  Filled with the germ of many possible situations to explore cinematically, the film  repeatedly fails to pursue much of anything.  The director does not establish and build a lot in the way of rapport between the characters and the audience.  Since the viewer is unable to identify with the characters, who cares about the characters' real and imaged (and truncated) predicaments?  Massages as depicted here are a joke!  All are amateurish and never touch the skin of a recipient (fabric finger-tip wrinkle removal?)!  Camera work and sound are fine, and the restoration is suburb.

8329664,4,B001O549GG,"Its lovely to come across such a little known director to find his works are little jewels.  Shimizu has been largely forgotten, but his contemporaries saw him as one of Japan's top film makers.  You can see why here - these films are in many ways quite slight, but Shimizu directs them with a lovely light touch, with tiny touches which show the confident hand of a master film maker.  They are very entertaining, they have hardly dated, but its still a fascinating look at a long gone world.",1367798400,,493,4.51685393258427
8329665,4,B001O549GG,"from my own viewpoint Shimizu, offered here by the Eclipse series gives us a necessary link needing major mention. from Naruse to Ozu we are all the better beneficiaries of the missing link we need to see in entirety.

we also get to understand their culture perhaps before they got eaten up with occupation of building a world war machine. this was a country collective of warm Sunday afternoons and vacationing at regional summer resorts. none it is that much different from our own selves at the same moment in time doing just that.

some of the best cinematic celluloids in any flavor or language coming off any island before the occupation of WW II bent the radius shooting out unto the stars of endless constellations. wonderfully simple stories that trend toward the best in us even if we don't understand these particular moment. poignant and delightful in spades.",1367625600,,872,4.845637583892618

8329667,4,B001O549GG,"JAPANESE GIRLS AT THE HARBOR: 2 schoolgirls fall for the same ne'er-do-well. 1 attacks his trampy girlfriend & flees Yokohama, becoming a geisha, the other ends up marrying him years later. Conflict ensues when the geisha returns home. Director Hiroshi Shimizu shows a 1933 Japan rife w/ Western influence: the girls are Catholics, the male lead is named ""Henry"". He shoots on location a lot & has a neat sylistic gimmick: diagonal tracking shots that move from room to room. At key points he also rapidly cuts closer & closer to his subject, like the shots of the eye-pecked farmer in THE BIRDS. Melodramatic subject matter is touching & underplayed. 7/10

MR THANK YOU: Hiroshi Shimizu takes his camera out on the road for a bus trip from the rural mountains to a valley train station in this 1936 charmer. A Japanese STAGECOACH 3 years before the fact. Vivid character portraits of the Depression-era: a kindly bus driver, a desperate mother taking her daughter off to be sold into prostitution, an arrogant salesman, a flirtatious city girl who smokes and drinks. Winsome movie w/ many touching moments. 7/10",1316908800,3,1112,4.914893617021277
8329668,5,B001O549GG,"Never having seen a film by Hiroshi Shimizu before, I was totally unprepared for these four gems.

Shimizu was a prolific director whose work (a great deal of which seems to have been lost) spanned the silent and sound ages of film, so it is not possible to say whether these are his best or most representative works. The four films here include one silent production and three pre-war sound films. Interestingly, the most recent of them (1941), ""Ornamental Hairpin"", has survived least well. That's not to say this DVD edition is bad quality - only a few scenes are seriously degraded, and the the film's intrinsic interest overwhelms any such concern. The three earlier films are wonderfully preserved.

All share a similar theme: a character's desire for escape from a social predicament. Shimizu's method is completely fresh: he deftly combines humour with pathos, cinematic artistry with subtle characterisation. The stories flow with no sense whatsoever of premeditated staging. Shimizu was famous for working outside a script and improvising scenes. This leads to some genuine surprises. In ""Mr Thank You"", for instance, Shimizu and crew came across a group of Korean labourers walking a rural backroad between assignments, and incorporated them into the story. This is consistent with the director's abiding interest in non-mainstream and working class characters, particularly women of the ""water trade"" (mizu shobai).

""Mr Thank You"" possibly best illustrates Shimizu's strengths as a film-maker. He takes a very simple situation - a bus journey through rural Izu (beautifully shot) - and makes it a vehicle for a penetrating study of character and social conditions. The overt lightness of the subject-matter is the enabling means for Shimizu to lead the viewer, almost unawares, into deep sympathy with the bus's disparate group of passengers. It is the nearest thing to a perfect film: wonderful to look at; constantly surprising; and, at the end, leaving the viewer wondering how he came to be so deeply affected.

""Japanese Girls At the Harbour"" - the silent offering - is fascinating for several reasons. It includes mixed-race Japanese characters, which is quite unusual. It contains some stunningly beautiful images of Yokohama, just a decade after the Great Kanto Earthquake. And it conveys a strong impression of the social tensions building in Japanese society during the Taisho Era.

""The Masseurs and a Woman"" has similarities to ""Ornamental Hairpin"". Both are set in a mountain hot-spring resort, both use blind masseur characters as a vehicle for social satire, both feature a woman trying to escape from a courtesan relationship, and both play with, but discard, conventions of romance. The former film is the slighter of the two, but perhaps they are best viewed as bookends to the several years separating their production, during which Japan went from war against China to the cusp of war against the Western Allies. Politics and social commentary seem far removed from the settings of these films - the characters are overtly in retreat from the world of action - and yet, as with ""Mr Thank You"", Shimizu draws themes of unexpected depth and seriousness out of apparently trivial or commonplace situations. His satirical touch is superb and left me gasping at times at its daring.

Highly recommended.",1293408000,9,3332,5.184014869888476
8329669,5,B001O549GG,"I can only echo the previous reviewers in praising this collection from pre-War Japan. For such short films with such simple plots, they all possess a remarkable richness of detail & a wide range of idiosyncratic characters, each with his or her own story. And there's a real freshness to them, with surprising humor interwoven through the quiet drama, that makes them feel quite contemporary. Sometimes the prospect of watching acclaimed older films can make the viewer fear obligatory drudgery -- nothing of the sort here, though! We're introduced to the characters & get caught up in their lives almost immediately.

While the theme of travel certainly runs through all four films, so does that of a woman's plight in the (then) modern world. Director Hiroshi Shimizu is quite sympathetic to his female leads, a quality that many Japanese films from the 1930s seem to share. These woman appear in both traditional & Western clothing, visual shorthand for the two worlds they're struggling to negotiate. This is especially notable in my favorite of the four, ""Mr. Thank You.""

A cheerful young bus driver, nicknamed ""Mr. Thank You"" for his habit of calling out ""Arigato!"" to travelers getting out of his way, has the usual group of assorted passengers for the day's journey. These include a spunky young woman, very Westernized & not unlike her independent sisters in 1930's Hollywood films; a shy village girl being taken to the city by her mother, obviously to go into prostitution to support her family; and a rather pompous, lecherous middle-aged man who can't stop leering at & propositioning the dispirited village girl.

During the journey, we watch these characters interact, along with several other passengers. The Westernized young woman constantly mocks the lecherous man for his blatant leering, even as she chats jokingly with the good-hearted bus driver, clearly trying to convince him to help the village girl. But as straightforward as that sounds, it's told with a compassionate eye for sorrow, tenderness, and even a moment of lovely transcendence.

I'll say no more, except that all four films share these thoroughly humane qualities. They may be more than 70 years old now, but there's nothing out-of-date about them. Thanks to Criterion for making them available in such a reasonably-priced package -- most highly recommended!",1270771200,17,2350,5.143979057591623
