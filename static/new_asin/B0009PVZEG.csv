2313037,3,B0009PVZEG,"This DVD is a nice overview of editing history but the time spent with the talking heads (especially the ""I love editing/editors"" segments) could have been put to better use showing more sequences of editing choices and how the final selection was made to what effect.  When one watches a program/film on editing, isn't the point to LEARN more than to be entertained? I wanted a film that explained the language of editing, the aesthetic/artistic process, the technical process and the end result on film viewer/reader so that my literature class could learn more about the unique elements of film as an artform in our examination of interpreting theme from narrative forms (including narrative film). Years ago, I could just copy segments from my VHS tapes to show my students exactly what I wanted so we didn't use two full class meetings with filler and still need to view something else to discuss lighting, sound and mise-en-scene!",1146009600,15,936,4.961783439490445

I am now ordering the DVD since it supposedly has some extra material not covered in the broadcast version, and since it has already proven to be a good review for watching multiple times.

2313041,2,B0009PVZEG,"I'm a filmmaker, university film instructor, and author/writer of film topics. I was excited to hear about this DVD because, to quote it's own blurb ""this fascinating program lets you in on the secrets..."" of film editing I had presumed. I expected an educational presentation that would dissect the cuts and the tricks, and show the development of a scene from the multiple takes and camera angles, and how an editor selects, massages, and makes it come together visually and aurally. There is a little of that... maybe 10%. The rest of it is talking heads about the ""secrets"" and the pontificating by directors and editors about how amazing they both are. Good Grief! Save me the self-aggrandizement. I think you've heard the adage: ""Don't tell me, show me."" There is far too much talking head about what is done, but there are no examples of scenes ""in process"" but only the final cut. The examples are only referential. Very disappointing. And Tarantino's gushing and hugging his editor has nothing to do with how editing works. This is a blatant ACE promotional piece masking as a documentary. Especially disappointing was the Sharon Stone crotch shots from Basic Instinct that destroys the DVD for high schools and makes it inappropriate for most other audiences. Even the director admits that the inclusion of these shots was NOT at the editor's discretion, but was his intent all along, no doubt to get at the audience's ""basic instincts."" The shots have everything to do with the story... but little to do with a secret of editing... more to do with the secrets and tricks of marketing.

2313042,5,B0009PVZEG,"Like ""Visions of Light"" before it, which celebrated cinematography, ""The Cutting Edge"" reveals the art of editing movies. And it truly is an art. For cinephiles and filmmakers, who know that what we see is what the editor wants us to see, this isn't news. For clueless moviegoers, however, ""The Cutting Edge"" may clarify misconceptions. David Lean didn't cut from that match to an Arabian desert. Stanley Kubrick didn't cut from a thrown bone to a spaceship. Their editors did.

For Lean and Kubrick, auteurs involved in all aspects of their films, that stretches the point. But there's no doubt that an editor's sense of narrative, performance and pacing can make or break a scene, sometimes an entire film. As the top tier editors and directors interviewed here admit, a good actor or director is only as good as the film's editor. The clips from films, showing how scenes are shaped, are craft lessons easy and entertaining to absorb. Actress Kathy Bates narrates.

This documentary is available singly or among the forgettable extras in the 2005 two-disc edition of the Peter Yates police procedural ""Bullitt."" That film is famous for its car chase over the hills of San Francisco. ""The Cutting Edge"" features the editing of that chase, as well as exciting sequences from other films, and alone is worth the price of the re-issue. It certainly is as interesting as anything in ""Bullitt,"" which doesn't bear close scrutiny these many years later.",1126656000,5,1449,4.958847736625515

2313058,5,B0009PVZEG,"If you love film making or want to know how a movie is put together, this is one of the best documentaries to watch(alongside Pervert's Guide to Cinema and Side by Side).  After watching this you can get a fresh perspective on the editing process and how it affects the output of the film.

The movie covers a history of film editing, starting with the early silent films.  It is explained how initially films were very simple, consisting of ONE sequence, typically lasting ten minutes or less and having NO cuts.  Throughout the movie you get to hear from editors and directors and their take on the editing process.  Scorsese for example comments several times and appears to have a decent knowledge of film history, understanding how each evolution in the editing process brought a newer and newer experience a film.

Different editing ideas or philosophies or given as the movie traces the history of editing and cinema itself.  Starting with the silent era, the movie covers the first films that contained 'montage editing' which merged different shots together to create a ""third"" meaning to the scene(the meaning of the first shot, combined with the meaning of the second).  Then the era of sound came in, allowing the audience to hear the actors voice and also allowed the use of music which is effectively used to set the mood.

You then see how editing evolved through the 50s, 60s and 70s.  Its shown how the 50s some scenes almost lasted in real time, where you would see a character park their car, get out, get into an elevator, go up, get out and then go into another character's apartment.  As the editing process evolved, and the audience's attention span shortened, it no longer became necessary to have such long takes; you could simply do a 'jump cut' to get
from one place to the next; you no longer had to show it.

One director more or less said people and kids specifically can process information and images faster, so it was no longer necessary to take so much time to tell the story, you can tell it quicker, shorter and almost show less and the audience would still understand what was going on.  In my opinion, that approach gives movies a more music video type of style, where you feel more like images or being thrown at you, rather than focusing on the characters interactions; again this is my take, and its merely a different approach to editing.

Tarantino and Spielberg give their takes on the editing process, both explaining how the frame is the essential element of film, much like the writer's word or the musician's note.  Each says each frame is important and knowing how to use them is essential.  Spielberg explained, ""that shark only looked real in 36 frames; not 38.  It makes the difference between the shark looking scary and it looking like a piece of turd.""

This is essential viewing if you like documentaries about film.  You get to understand the concept that what makes film unique is the editing, that's what separates it from TV, for example.  If you are really serious about editing, watch this movie to check out editor Walter Murch's editing room that he used for Cold Mountain.  You get to see the computer setup he uses to edit the movie and how he watches the output on a projector screen on the wall.  The movie shows how stands up while using the computer, watches the output on the projector and then makes the cuts when he feels its right.  Again, great stuff if your into film.",1389571200,,3444,4.646864686468647

2313105,5,B0009PVZEG,"I highly recommend this DVD to all amateur film makers, movie buffs who want to learn about the magic of film editing, and film students.

I first started filming home movies using Super 8 film some thirty years ago! I remember loving editing my movies. At first, I used to cut portions of the film that were out of focus or were too jerky. Then I learnt to cut and mix film together, creating a more dramatic movie. Sometimes I would cut scenes from Hollywood movies into my home made movies. As I became older and more proficient in movie editing, I started adding sound and music. It was fun, and all techniques I used were self-learnt.

I have gone a long ways since those days of cutting film. I now shoot my home made movies in digital format and use my computer to edit and create my movies. Obviously, I now have more powerful editing tools, and the process has become so much easier.

Why do I relate the above story about myself? I really relate to this DVD and how film editing has evolved throughout the years. This DVD is a great history of film editors and their methods, and if like me you once worked with film, you will relate to and truly enjoy this DVD.

Film making was born the same year the Wright Brothers took to the sky. No one thought film making would survive. Scenes were shot until either the film maker got bored shooting the scene or the film ran out. For example, film makers would shoot a train passing by, or people walking or playing. Remember that in the beginning film was black and white and silent. Why would people watch a film when they can see the same events for real; in color and with all the natural sounds? Edison thought film making will be just an amusement, with a very limited life, and nothing more. However, his associate thought otherwise. He was the first to actually edit film, and thus produce a story. For example, the film would show firemen running out of their fire department, and then cut to a lady in distress in a burning house. The film would then cut again to the firemen racing to their cars, and then once again to the poor lady in distress. This would go on until the firemen finally reach the burning house and save the lady. Through editing, it was now possible to tell a story. Overnight, film making was viewed in a different light.

At first, all film editors were women. Editing, or cutting, was viewed as knitting. The Film house would decide on the editing of the movie, not the editors, producers, or directors. When sound was introduced to films, men, viewed as more technical, started taking jobs as editors.

Close-ups at first were shunned. Who would want to see a close-up of the actor's face? People paid money to see the whole actor from head to toe, not just his face. It took pioneering editors to introduce close-ups in movies. Close-ups enabled actors to show emotions. This was an instant hit in movies, and many editors followed suit.

At first, all editors worked in the background, never credited with their work and remaining unknown to the public. Yet it is the editors who make a movie into a movie. A movie can fail to relate the emotions of a character if the editing is lousy. For example, in Bonnie and Clyde, the scene where Clyde tells Bonnie that he is a bank robber is edited in a way to show the emotions and eroticism of the characters. The camera shows a close-up of the gun, then a close-up of the face of Bonnie looking down at the gun, then up at Clyde, then a close-up of Clyde. Imagine that same scene if it were one camera shooting the whole scene in one shot, with no close-ups, and in one angle. It would be hard for the characters in such a shot to show us their emotions. Editing therefore makes a big difference in bringing characters to life. It is no wonder that editing is viewed as the soul of the movie!

Film editing also allowed fascist states to use film for propaganda purposes. One such film was filmed for Hitler, using smart editing techniques to show Hitler as a god. Editing allowed the film to shift from Hitler giving a speech, to German parachutists jumping from a plane, to peasants supporting Hitler, and back to Hitler giving his speech. This editing technique gave strong emotions to viewers of the film. The US also used film to encourage its nation to war in its documentary, `Why we go to war'.

Film editors had specific rules to work with when editing and those rules were never to be broken. For example, a shot would show an actor driving to his house, then getting out of his car, walking towards his front door, where he meets his wife on the porch. All those shots are filmed from head to toe so to speak. Then the actor will speak with his wife, and only then we would see a close up of the actors face, then a close up of the actor's wife, then a wide shot of both of them talking together. No editors deviated from this system...but not for long. Again, pioneering editors decided to tell a story in a different way, and broke all accepted and traditional editing methods. Slow motion was introduced in films like the `Terminator' with Arnold Schwarzenegger. Freezing a frame for a second or two was also a technique used in film to emphasize a moment, like in the movie `Out of sight' with George Clooney and Jennifer Lopez. Such freezing frames heightened the sexual moment between two characters. Editing techniques were also used to make a scene erotic but not sexual, or sexy but not erotic. For example, is it sexier to see a full frontal nude scene of an actor or an implied nude scene? I would choose the latter.

Editors then started experimenting with chase scenes, a pretty difficult technique to master. `Bullitt's' dynamic editing, for example, with its action-packed chase sequence, earned a 1968 Best Film Editing Oscar. Similarly, `Matrix' with Keanu Reeves used dynamic editing in its chase sequence. These were methods unknown to earlier editors. Zach Staenberg, Academy Award-winning editor of the Matrix trilogy, says, ""What makes a movie a movie is the editing."" Tarantino only begins to make a movie when he enters the editor's room: A movie in not yet a movie before the editing process.

As technology progressed, newer editing techniques were used. For example, flashbacks, parallel action, juxtaposition of images etc... The use of a green background screen allowed film editors flexibility unseen in earlier movies. `Star Wars', for example, uses a green screen to add actors to animated backgrounds. Computer generated animation also allowed film editors to take a movie to new heights unseen before.

It took a while for editors to become appreciated, and when they did, the Oscars finally rewarded them with their little statues.

This is really a great DVD that will trace the history of film editing. There are interviews with such notables as Spielberg and Tarantino among a few. I really enjoyed watching it, and I'm sure you will too.",1187049600,,6922,4.604217356042174

Quentin Tarantino speaks to the importance of a single frame and his reasons for deciding to work with a female film editor, and Steven Spielberg talks about the objectivity of the film editor.  But you have to wish that this documentary could have let these points be made by the film editors themselves since one of the premises here is that film editors are often forgotten when people think about how a film is made.

The history lesson begins with not only the creation of movie editing when Edwin Porter, one of Thomas Edison's employees, first cut scenes together to create a story in 1903, first in ""The Life of an American Fireman"" and then the more famous ""Great Train Robbery.""  A theoretical distinction between the polar approaches of D.W. Griffith's seamless editing, as in ""The Birth of a Nation,"" versus the more manipulative approach of Russian documentary filmmaker Dziga Vertov and his team in ""Man with a Movie Camera"" and later Sergei Eisenstein in ""Battleship Potemkin.""  The history of film editing seems to come down to certain individuals who were in the right place at the right time, but there is also the interesting observation that originally women were film editors because the task was seen as being akin to knitting, and it was not until sound was introduced and the process became so ""technical"" than men started doing the job instead.  Ultimately the goal in this documentary is not just to be informative but to persuade viewers that after the director and the stars the film editor is the most important person involved in the production of a film and in creating ""the final script.""

Sections are devoted to the general idea of cutting action, suspense, or sex, as well as cutting for the studios or to make the actor a star.  At one point ""The Rules"" are established, and then the documentary looks at how successful film editors have broken all of those rules.  Specific examples of editing that look at the specific choices that were made are fairly rare in this documentary.  There is a brief example from ""Home for the Holiday"" where we actually get to see some of the choices for cutting a scene where a turkey falls on Cynthia Stevenson, but usually all you get is the editor describing after the fact what they did, as with Walter Murch and the hotel sequence at the start of ""Apocalypse Now.""  There are a couple of choice examples of how sound comes into play with Pietro Scalla in ""Black Hawk Down"" and Tina Hirsch in ""Dante's Peak,"" that helps to expand our notion of film editing.  Then you have the extreme case of Alan Heim convincing director Bob Fosse to cut 20 minutes following the climactic courtroom scene in ""Lenny"" to get to Bruce's death.  The problem is every time you get one of these specific examples you want more and the documentary is more likely to get back to a general topic (I was waiting for a section on the concept of American montage exemplified by the baptism scene in ""The Godfather,"" but that never came).  Still, you do get a decent introduction to the topic.",1185840000,5,3917,4.937595129375952
2313108,5,B0009PVZEG,"As a Media teacher, this DVD is an excellent resource for my students - it outlines the history of narrative through montage, from its earliest days, through 'important' developments of such directors as Griffiths and Eisenstein. It also explores the function of a variety of styles and techniques that have become conventions in specific genres. Perhaps most valuably it has some of the 'greats' of directing and editing discussing the editing process. While it is Amero-centric in terms of its subject matter, it is entirely appropriate for my students.",1178668800,,555,5.247191011235955
2313109,4,B0009PVZEG,"There is much you can say about this except Awesome! It is great to see some of the behind the scenes that is needed to understand what an editor does. I have to admit, I didn't have any idea as to what the editors job was and now I do. Wonderful story told the way it should. There are some foul mouth parts but the message that it gives is worth it.

I was hungry for more, so far there is not another documentary on the subject.",1168819200,,277,4.673469387755102
2313112,3,B0009PVZEG,"Although I had hoped, judging from the title, that this movie would delve into the craft of editing, which it really doesn't, it does offer an interesting historic overview of the increasingly important role of the editor. The interviewed editors and directors are all leading Hollywood folks, and it's Hollywood's history all the way. One could spend lots of time reviewing the many clips from major films that are used as illustrations and learn a lot from them.

  What I liked least, is the high percentage of violent and fast-cut film clips used. Towards the end, several editors speak about how today's youger generations can follow ad absorb the sensory overload, and ""that's what they want."" Well, that's Hollywood for you.",1162598400,5,731,5.024793388429752

8065366,5,B0009PVZEG,"I am not a film student, so the apparent flaws in this show weren't evident to me. Most complaints I see online about this are detailed complaints from film students or people in the industry. I found it an interesting and helpful introduction to the importance of film editing. I had no idea so much creative power lay in the hands of the editors.  Even if this is sensationalized and simplified to the bottom line to attract laymen, it is entertaining and educational. Those who mock it are nit-picking.  For the most part, the general public will skip something about editing, as it won't attract them in the first place, so just the existence of this show is helpful in raising awareness of the intricacies that go into making a major motion picture.  Knowing nothing about how movies are made, I still found this worth my time.  Technicians, students and nit-pickers can tear it up, but it's better than having nothing at all available.  If it's that bad from an educational stand-point, I invite the industry to release it's own version to clarify.",1439596800,,1054,4.737704918032787

We are introduced to methods and philosophies used down through the ages and the metamorphosis from celluloid to digital recordings.

As informative as this documentary is it suffers from sound-bite-itus instead of concentrating on one person or thought, we are leaped back and forth trough a collage of people, techniques, and time. This method of presentation can become quite boring after a time.  Still the documentary (that only shows highlights and nothing practical) is worth viewing.",1421452800,,637,5.287128712871287
