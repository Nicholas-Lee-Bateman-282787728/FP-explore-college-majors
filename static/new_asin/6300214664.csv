It's pretty scary, the werewolf does look a little unreal but hey, the movie is like 15 years old.  There are alot move vampire movies and book than there are about  werewolves. Its good, its scary, watch it.",951436800,,324,4.17741935483871

251138,5,6300214664,"I find no entertainment value in werewolf movies. I'm moreover a ""vampire"" enthusiast. But this is one movie that I can truly make an exception for. The very first time I saw it was when I was a child and had no idea at the time I was seeing my first Corey Haim role until it later dawned on me while watching The Lost Boys. Silver Bullet is slightly slow with little humor in it to lighten up the atmosphere but it's just inexplicably one of those films that sticks with you.

Great cast, great and suspenseful plotline.",1521244800,,521,4.316326530612245

The special features are also a real treat. Directors commentary, isolated score, composer interview, and more make this a great package. I also love the new artwork. I miss the old movie poster, but the slipsheet is reversible and one of the old posters is on one of the sides.

this is the first time ever this film has been reissued on blu-ray & with new extras by Australian Distributor Umbrella
Silver bullet has only been available on dvd by paramount which had no extras anyway not even the original trailer actually
well Umbrella is the only Distributor in the world that's now reissued the film on blu-ray & with new extras
the HD picture quality in 2:35:1 ratio does look amazing much more sharper and clearer than the old paramount dvd
about 8-9/10 for picture quality
plus the sound quality is also upgraded with new 2.0 master audio mix, the old Paramount dvd just had the old Mono sound mix, 6-7/10
EXTRAS, new extras which is a first time for this film
new interview with Everett McGill, new interviews with the SFX artists on the film
new interview with Producer Martha De Laurantis who was one of the producers on the film
new audio commentary with Director Daniel Attias, plus the original trailer in new HD quality, plus TV spots, radio spots stills Gallery
this new reissue is the blu-ray to get No Doubt about it so time to scrap the old dvd copy 5 stars for sure
by the way being a AUS release maybe locked to region B but it isn't it's ABC coded",1515283200,5,1217,4.51131221719457
251263,5,6300214664,"When this movie was being filmed down in Wilmington North Carolina I had the opportunity to be an extra in a movie so I'm one of the small kids in the movie so I don't know if I'll be able to recognize myself it's been a long time but I am in the movie and no I don't have a screen credit name because I was just an extra kid they wanted to use in the movie.

If I'm not mistaken this movie was so long ago I believe I'm one of the kids that got killed I can't recall it's been so long.",1515110400,,486,3.673076923076923

251265,5,6300214664,"I remember this movie fondly and am happy to see it FINALLY get a proper bluray release. The book the cycle of the werewolf was more fleshed out in this telling of the story. The characters have more depth especially the interaction of the siblings who try to solve the mystery of what is going on with their town and to find out who is the killer. This movie while not 'gory' or even up to par for some die in the wool werewolf fans I have to say that the practical effects hold up well. The method of less is more is more in use here. The infamous ""kite scene"" at the gazebo is still in my view just as heart wrenching and terrifying. You do not SEE the aftermath of what happened but your mind fills in the blanks. Sometimes just sometimes we are far more capable in scaring the crap out of ourselves. Perhaps I am fan gushing at this point but I do not care. I am just happy to see this finally get a re-release in a new format.",1513987200,2,932,4.070652173913044

251323,4,6300214664,"The packaging was okay, but could be better and the movie as a whole was very fun and entertaining, although not perfect. For instance, there were a few very silly scenes in the movie, like when the town's people band together to hunt for the killer in the woods. It played out like a comedy so much, it made me crack up so hard. Especially when a few of the town's folk get attacked by the werewolf under a fog bank. It is so hilarious that you just got to see it to get a laugh. And you will literally DIE LAUGHING when you see the werewolf beat a man with his own baseball bat. Yes, it is that ridiculously funny. At times the movie can be very serious, but then at other times plays out like a comedy which can be very conflicting. And the werewolf's design isn't very scary. In some scenes he looks like a cross between a black bear and a dog with pointy ears. But I could look over that and still enjoyed the movie. I especially enjoyed the acting performances of Gary Busey, Corey Haim, Megan Follows, Terry O'Quinn, Everett McGill and a few others. Their acting was really well done, fun and entertaining to watch. I remember watching this as a young teenager and I loved the chemistry between Corey Haim, Gary Busey and Megan Follows. They will convince you that they are an imperfect family with a few issues, but truly love each other. This movie really has a big heart to it. I bought this DVD on Amazon a few months ago, because when I started to recall how much fun I had watching this as a teenager I had to buy it. Now that I watch it with adult eyes, I truly fell that this movie had better potential of being a solid Stephen King classic. I still think it's a classic, but it could have been done better. I mean it's great to have comic relief in horror movies, but sometimes this movie is just over the top comedy. This movie can't seem to make up it's mind at being a horror film or a Saturday Night Live show. I just fell this movie would have been better if done in a more serious tone with a little less humor. And of course, it would help to have a more convincing and scarier werewolf. But like I said at the beginning of my review that this movie as a whole is still very fun and entertaining. And I can't forget to mention that I love the music scores in this movie, especially Jay Chattaway's joyride theme song at the end credits. Never paid mind to it as a teenager, but now I adore it and listen to it on youtube. Even though this movie isn't perfect, I still love it enough to give it about 4 out of 5 stars. I'f you like imperfect  chessy movies with a big heart, than you will love this one.",1510099200,,2625,4.177514792899408

It's surprisingly well acted by Corey Haim and Megan Follows for as young as they were and Gary Busey does a good job as the slightly alcoholic, troubled Uncle Red (how can anyone not like Gary Busey's acting).  Haim plays Marty an eleven year old going through life in a wheel chair.  Megan Follows plays Jane, Marty's older sister who feels he's spoiled because of his handicap and is a little jealous of the attention he gets.  Marty's out playing one night when he encounters something that scares the hell out of him.  He eventually confides in his sister and both of them go to Uncle Red for help.  Uncle Red has a hard time believing their story but none the less helps them out, every kid should be lucky enough to have an Uncle Red to go to!!!  This wasn't a gazillion dollar budget movie with tons of special effects but the story was fairly good and it was acted well by the principals (the movie is thirty plus years old), good enough to kill some time with.",1487808000,,1079,4.333333333333333

252220,4,6300214664,"I watched this mainly because I'm both a Stephen King and Gary Busey fan.  As I had never heard of this movie, I was surprised to learn how long ago it was made (1985).  A werewolf, two kids whom nobody believes and a drunken-but-well-meaning uncle are all part of the typical King story line.

""Silver Bullet"" refers to the (very) high-speed motorized ""wheelchair"" --- really more of road-going ""mobility trike"" --- that the Gary Busey character builds for his disabled nephew; that contraption is the coolest prop in the movie!",1485475200,4,529,4.855555555555555

252224,3,6300214664,It's a pretty good movie for what it is. It is dated and looks a little cheesy compared to current horror movies. I find it entertaining. It's worth watching if you're just looking to fill some time. It's the only movie that I can stand Gary Busey in. He does a pretty good job in it.

I read the novella that this movie was based on and loved it.  In film, it does nothing to inspire fear or unease, which King himself accomplishes in spades with the novella.  Interesting characters are made dull and fearsome beasts are made poodle-like.  And it's dated now.  It just simply has not aged well if it was even entertaining at release.",1484092800,,488,4.426966292134831

Corey Haim is also great in his first big lead role and Megan Follows is very good as well as Haim's sister. You care about these characters and they have a terrific chemistry which is always the key. The special effects are great and the werewolf attacks are intense.

I was actually rooting for him instead of the main protagonist a whiny pre teen confined to a wheel chair while his equally annoying older sister.

I'm a sucker for old transformation tricks as opposed to the now computer effects. especially towards the end the villain's transformation
probably one of Gary Busey's better performances though it seems like playing a character that shares some similarities to himself would seem like a walk in the park. overall I would give this movie a four out of five stars",1469232000,6,688,4.677685950413223

253790,4,6300214664,"For me this is one of the must-have films for any werewolf movie collectors. I don't even mind that the costume used to show the full werewolf is an obvious on piece suit more reminiscent of a school mascot than a monster. For me it was this story itself that brought this film to life. Most of the special effects done in the film are of standard quality for 80s films. So since I have watched this movie so many times, much more than any other Stephen King movie, including Christine and Carrie it must be my favorite movie adaptation of a Stephen King story.

Silver Bullet has a classic character that relates to anyone who ever played way past sun down as a kid then realized your error as you rushed home to the visions of every nightmare or scary story read or heard floods you right up until your feet hit that threshold and your hand is on the door knob finding your way safe in the warmth comfort of home. There are stereotypical players here that make you long for the horror which is purposely drawn out for a steady build. The film offers images and concepts of moral corruption by long believed trust-worthy members of the community while teasing with quick and brutal deaths  of characters that traditionally should be safe from such a tragic ending but in the realm of Stephen King become fair game.

Most of the special effects as far as the werewolf transformation are traditional make-up tricks common in horror before this wretched CGI crap began to take over, and the story is a true tale David Slaying Goliath as only the master of horror could tell it, with sweet sounds echoing through calm streets, disarming all who venture into his realm. Where the dark terror that lurks just beyond the orderly construct of a Rockwellian life wait to feed. I would give it a full five stars but for the costume suit used for the werewolf way to visible in the final scene.",1431216000,,1884,4.502923976608187

253979,4,6300214664,"Silver Bullet has managed to hold up well over the years.  Gary Busey is brilliant in his role as Uncle Red to wheelchair bound Marty Coslaw (Corey Haim).

Stephen King's novella Cycle of the Werewolf takes to the big screen with King's own screenplay.  While not his best work, Busey turns weird into even weirder.  Imagine, giving your nephew a wheelchair that can run neck and neck with cars.  Then imagine making it Silver Bullet.  Odd.

Even though the movie is hokie at best, it's one of those that is with watching when it's on.  Busey ""plays"" a great alcoholic.",1419120000,,569,4.62

It took me back to a time when there was no Internet at movie studios were sold on the idea that the best way to get a big turnout is to just cook these big cinematic casseroles filed with something for everybody. This is at once a true 70s gore-fest and a family movie with a very Disney core. It plays to the disabled, it plays to small town America, it plays to people who want to see Gary Busy build a totally unsafe motorcycle wheelchair for his beloved 11-year-old paraplegic nephew and then send him out riding down the road at highway speeds.

Fun Werewolf movie based on a Stephen King novel. Captures the essence of growing up in small town America. Good to great acting all around, especially Gary Busey as the free spirited uncle, that likes to have a swig or two.

Some good to great scenes here too! Especially the Priest's dream sequence where his congregation turns into Werewolves, a real ""Howling"" moment! Eerie! Got to love the Werewolf hunt too! Great choice on the Great Danes! If your going to use a hunting dog to hunt Werewolves, I'll take a Dane any day! The film also imaginatively puts fireworks to a new task, much to the Werewolf's chagrin!

My only complaint is the weak make up of the werewolf it's self (docked 1/2 Star) at the end of the movie. It looked more like something five year olds would take to bed with them, than the big bad wolf. Little Red Riding Hood need fear not, but everything up to this point was excellent.

Expecting a seriously scary story, there was humor very smartly incorporated into the plot, which made Silver Bullet in the same class of story as The Green Mile, or Shawshank Redemption. The incorrigible uncle was a great character. The siblings and the development of their relationship was completely believeable. The gruesome effects were reminders that this story is still a nightmare and the humor was a perfect gift of sanity in an otherwise very weird tale. Great acting, great music, great photography.

254594,4,6300214664,"This is most certainly not the definitive werewolf movie.  It doesn't even rate second tier status.  I'd say it was just a notch above functional.  It's not scary.  The wolf in question, more often than not, looks like a bear.  The acting is pitched a bit high, unnaturally high.  The dialog, courtesy of Stephen King, never seems genuine.  The people who populate this unreasonable locale are more than a little simplistic.  At times this place and these angry people feel so artificial you wonder if this wasn't meant to be a parody.  As for the story, there are plot devices aplenty that make no sense.  Instead of the obligatory bar brawl there's a bar ""yell"" (designed solely to introduce the town bully).  The local yokels form a bumbling/stumbling slapstick mob that takes to the woods........when all of the murders clearly took place IN THE TOWN!  (The werewolf even has the fortitude to climb a trellis to kill the second victim in her bedroom.)  And, for the umpteenth time, King takes another feeble potshot against Christianity and Christians (a main staple throughout his work).  We get it, you despise religion and take every opportunity to rail against what you perceive is the hypocrisy behind it or the people who are sometimes linked with it.  Snooze.  That rant is getting old, find something else to pick on.  Singing the same song gives you a reputation, it doesn't make you an expert.

The weird part of all this is that I actually like this stupid movie.  I can't recall the number of times I've watched it (and will continue to watch it).  I have yet to figure that out, especially considering I am not a fan of Stephen King's work.

254618,3,6300214664,"I was very impressed by the book ""The cycle of werewolf"" by Stephen King and therefore I expected a lot of its cinema adaptation - but sadly, I was mostly disappointed. This review contains some very limited SPOILERS.

""The cycle of werewolf"" describes a small town in Maine haunted at every full moon by a ferocious werewolf and the film begins mostly faithfully to the book. However, very fast the director decided to change things, in my modest opinion without any real reason. Like in the book, the main hero, 11-years old Marty Coslaw, has lost the use of his legs and is bound to a wheelchair, but unlike in the book here he receives a big sister, who becomes the narrator of the story.

There is also less victims than in the book and the human identity of the werewolf is revealed too early in the film. In the book, which covers one year, it occurs on 31 October - here, not only the story is shortened, but the solution to the main mystery also comes much faster. The special effects are not really very good and the incredible strength and great speed of the werewolf, which were so chillingly described in the book, are here missing in action. Finally, in the book the werewolf sometimes played a little with his victims, displaying occasionally some sadistic, depraved sense of humor, which made it even scarier - here this element is absent.

Actors however are very good. Young Corey Haim did a darn good job as Marty and Megan Follows is excellent as his big sister Jane. But the real star is of course Gary Busey as Marty's heavy drinking and not very recommendable uncle. Everett McGill, who did such a great job in ""Quest for fire"", ""Dune"" and ""Twin Peaks"", is also excellent as a young local pastor, who desperately strives to keep his faith and sanity when his flock is being slowly devoured by a Beast from Hell...

All in all, it is a honest little horror, not too gory and not too scary - but absolutely nowhere near the quality of the original book. The real adaptaion of ""Cycle of Werewolf"" remains to be turned.

He shoots the werewolf in the eye and tells his sister Jane that if she sees anyone in the town with a patch over his eye they'll have their guy. The werewolf wages a personal vendetta against Marty.

THAT is how unmemorable this movie actually was for me.  Silver Bullet was, to sum it up briefly, a rather typical, run of the mill werewolf movie and little else.  It was enjoyable enough, however, that I got through it without hating it, in spite of the fact that I had picked out the correct suspect right from the beginning.  The best aspect of the movie was the performance of Gary Busey as the uncle, who managed to bring a little life to this otherwise mundane ""horror"" flick.  Uncle Red (Busey), however, ""miraculously"" recovers from his extreme alcoholism as the movie progressives.  There is no explanation for this; he just turns out to be the one, really good guy with any intelligence in the entire movie; the one adult who first comes to believe his nephew.  Silver Bullet is, like so many movies of this type, full of massive numbers of logical errors and dead giveaways when it comes to the who-dunnit, who-is-it part.

Wheelchair-bound Marty believes that the recent murders that are taking over his small, sleepy town are the work of a werewolf, and along with the help of his sister and alcoholic uncle, he sets off to stop the beast with a silver bullet! Like THE MONSTER SQUAD and WATCHERS, SILVER BULLET is clearly targeted towards a younger audience, but that doesn't make it any less enjoyable for adults. Director Daniel Attias gives us plenty of terrifying monster action and bloody violence to keep us entertained, even if the story falls back on a routine ""whodunit."" The fast pace and warm characters still keep us glued to the screen as we help to unravel the mystery ourselves. SILVER BULLET's stand-out moment shows an entire congregation of churchgoers transform into a pack of wild beasts right before the preacher's very eyes! Borrowing largely from the work of Rick Baker in THE HOWLING and AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON, world-renown make-up artist Carlo Rambaldi does an excellent job with the creature effects, and also includes several stunning transformation sequences. Look for Gary Buesy as Uncle Red and Everett McGill as the eccentric Reverend Lowe!

We finally get into the movie. You can tell that it's a Stephen King movie because of the excessive potty mouth presentations. This can be overlooked if they would hurry up and get into the biting parts and so they do. As far as the movies concerned this is the standard formula ""anyone can be the biter until they turn up as the bitee and that we know they're not the biter but there are a fewer potential bitees left.

This movie does try to get down on the kids level. And it uses all the standard gimmicks such as the kids can tell that that's really a werewolf but the parents don't believe them. Then it becomes a little more tongue-in-cheek. They even toss in a little slapstick.

The question is will the culprit(s) getaway or face ""the silver bullet?""

One of the advantages of being based on a Stephen King novella ""Cycle of the Werewolf"" is that Stephen King always keeps the spooky doings close to the realm of possibility. He also has a fascination with cars.

This story begins with a full moon (which is said to affect people's behavior). A man sings an advertising jingle, later there is a howl. The small town has a celebration. One boy plays a prank on a girl. She overhears a delicate conversation between a man and a woman. Her brother uses a wheelchair. Later that woman swallows red pills. A furry creature breaks into her room and she screams! Her mother grabs a handy pistol and climbs the stairs. Too late! Marty plays poker with his Uncle Red. [A useful skill?] A man's TV viewing is disturbed; he takes his rifle and goes outside to his shed. He is the third victim. There is a sale on shotguns. Marty flies a kite. So does his friend Brady. After dark the people find another body. The men form a militia to search for the killer. [They have the right to keep and bear arms.]

The Reverend tries to stop them from their ""private justice"". [Did he tip his mitt?] Are those men making too much noise while hunting? Should they keep their safeties on? [This is too comic for a horror story.] A baseball bat is not a good weapon against a werewolf. That night the Reverend has a nightmare! [Funny? Does it remind you of an Abbott & Costello movie?] Marty gets a special vehicle from his uncle Red. ""Be careful."" Late at night Marty climbs out of his window to ride his new tricycle and set off fireworks. He is watched. A small rocket stops the attack of the werewolf. Marty tells Janey about it. Janey visits people to ask for returnable glass bottles and cans (and also check for a wound). [The brand names show product placement.] She finds a baseball bat! Who can she confide in? Uncle Red listens, but he is doubtful. [When did these attacks begin?]

A four-door Chevrolet follows Marty as he drives home. He takes a short cut but runs out of gas. The driver walks toward him, but departs when a witness appears. [Logical reaction?] Marty tells Red, who tells the Sheriff. A crazy story? The Sheriff investigates at night, alone. A bad career move? What creates a werewolf? Can they make a silver bullet? The next full moon arrives. [Note the dirt roads.] Uncle Red guards Janey and Marty while their parents leave. Then the lights go out. ""He's here!"" Marty is lucky in knowing how to use a revolver correctly. They are saved! [There is no final scene to wrap up the loose ends.] Did the Gun Control Fanatics ban this movie from TV?

I once read a book that said the legends from the Hollywood films from the 1930s were invented for those movies. It was wolfsbane that kept away vampires, not garlic. The idea of a silver bullet was another Hollywood myth. Most people's knowledge comes from the movies and television, not history books. One article said the legends of werewolves were created after outbreaks of rabies (whose victims attacked other people). Werewolf and vampire movies became popular during the Great Depression, a distraction and entertainment for people damaged by economic forces beyond their control. Unless they gathered together to attack the castle of the Baron (the economic royalist). This may explain the renewed interest in horror movies since 2008 (the Great Recession). The triumph over the monsters in these movies represent hope to the viewers. ""Jaws"" followed the Ford Recession of 1974 and this film followed the Reagan Recession of 1982.",1342310400,,3355,4.68135593220339

Part of the attraction in this story lies in its strong casting. Corey Haim plays young Marty Coslaw who has been unable to walk since infancy. He is a likable character and had me rooting for him throughout the movie. Corey's older sister, Jane is credibly portrayed by Megan Follows (one of my favorite actors since I watched her performance in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Anne-of-Green-Gables-The-Collection/dp/B000XSKDH4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Anne of Green Gables: The Collection</a>&nbsp;series).

Life in Corey's little town somewhere in Maine is quite idyllic until strange deaths occur. A decapitated man found on the railroad tracks is attributed to an accident, and many other gruesome deaths follow, until even the townspeople begin to wonder what is going on. Unfortunately, Corey finds himself in the wrong place at the wrong time one night, and the scene is set for a confrontation between Corey and the otherworldly creature responsible for these murders, i.e. a werewolf.

The actor playing the villain does a great job in convincing viewers of his wicked, bestial nature even when in adult form. Terry O'Quinn from the series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Millennium-The-Complete-DVD-Collection/dp/B001CY5N00/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Millennium: The Complete DVD Collection</a>&nbsp;plays the small-town sheriff who tries in vain to find the murderer until it is too late. Then there's Gary Busey! He plays Corey's goofball Uncle Red who builds a special motorized scooter/wheelchair that enables Corey to move fast from one place to another, and it's aptly called The Silver Bullet:) This movie is great fun for the whole family (though because of its content, it is suited more for ages 10 and up).",1338595200,2,2072,5.8316831683168315

He lives in the small town of Tarker's Mills, Maine.  Strange things are going on as people just keep getting killed in horrible and gruesome ways.  The town is worried and everyone is on guard wondering who or what is the murder.  The rumor mill speculates that a werewolf is in town.

Marty has a cool uncle who just loves him. Uncle Red (Gary Busey) builds Marty a combination motorcycle wheelchair for his birthday.  Its nickname is ""Silver Bullet"".  Marty can now easily get around but it leads him into trouble with the killer as he is in the wrong place at the wrong time.

Stephen King is the master at writing funny and scary stories.  In this movie Marty is the hero and with the help of Uncle Red they just may have an answer for the killer who is roaming the town.  Jane Coslaw (Megan Follows) is Marty's older sister and she plays a major role in the movie as someone who helps Marty discover the true identity of the werewolf.

Anyway Corey and his sister find out that a local towns person is non other then a Werewolf who is stalking certain sinners in their town. Naturally of course no one believes them until one night uncle Red stays overnight to calm their fears, and comes face to face with the beast. ""Great movie, a fun movie as well,"" all the actors did an excellent job in this, a very creepy movie with down home charm as well.

254971,3,6300214664,"I had seen this film a long time ago, but I forgot most of it over the years. I caught this film on an HD channel recently and I have to give it a mild thumbs up. The film is pretty good as werewolf movies go, but I wish they had a bigger budget and used a better sound track. The 80's synthesizer track used here does little to add mood and dates the film. The werewolf make-up is hit or miss here as sometimes with the use of shadows the werewolf looks pretty darn good and other times he looks a little like Smokey the Bear.

The acting is above average for this type of film and Gary Busey is always welcome in these crazy little films. I also liked that this werewolf picked his victims for reasons sometimes and they were not just all random. One of the biggest flaws is it is a little too easy to figure out who the werewolf is and that is one major setback. Even my wife who had never seen this film and isn't a really big horror fans said ""that guy looks like a werewolf""! Regardless, as werewolf films go, this one is certainly one of the better ones and with a few tweaks here and there this one could have been really good. It's a fun Halloween movie and should be part of your Lycanthropy movie collection.",1273449600,,1219,4.121848739495798

254973,5,6300214664,"I'm not really a big Stephen King fan. But, this story is a gem. A werewolf tale done from a very different perspective. Corey Haim is the main character in the film and plays the part of Marty, a young boy confined to a wheelchair to get around. Megan Follows is his sister and best friend and Gary Busey is his Mom's brother, a well-soaked Uncle, called Red. To me, the relationship between Marty and his sister and Marty and his Uncle Red are the main attractions in this movie. The special effects aren't really all that great, the screen-play is mediocre, overall and the supporting cast do a pretty good job in their flat, one-dimensional roles.

 But, Uncle Red loves his nephew and likes to spend time with him. He's drunk on a regular basis, which leads you to think that, maybe somehow, he's partly to blame for Marty's condition. It's never even suggested, but the pain he shows at times over Marty's disability seems telling. He also likes doing things to make Marty happy, like building him a souped-up, decked-out three wheel motorized wheel chair, with way too much power for an eleven year old kid. You can sense his fear for Marty's safety when he gives it to him. But, his desire to make his nephew happy overwhelms his sense of responsibility. There are many other scenes that are really wonderful to watch Busey playing Uncle Red and his role is a true highlight of this film.

Megan Follows as Marty's sister, Jane is also wonderful to watch. It's one of the heart warming aspects of this movie. As she's frustrated at being cast, by her parents, as Marty's gofer and getter, so to speak, and also being constantly berated for not keeping  her brother on a tight enough leash, there's also the love she feels for her brother and the fact that she believes in him. This is a very important aspect of the film. Marty believes he has seen a werewolf, which is, of course, an unbelieveable thing and he desperately needs someone to believe him and believe in him. His sister is there for him and gives him the faith that he needs.

This movie is judged best, in my opinion, on it's characterizations and the relationships between the characters. In the end, though, those are the most importasnt aspects of any film. It's simple, but loads of fun!

My wife and I both really liked to see Corey in the movies back when he was popular and I was very saddened to hear about his untimely passing, last month. He did such a wonderful job playing the sweet, good natured, innocent kid and he was such a welcome addition to any movie.

254975,5,6300214664,"Of one the most intense creatures in the horror world has to be the werewolf. What could be worse then having a huge, fast, blood thirsty man beast hunting you down? On top of there size and other beastly features they can sniff you out no matter where you try to hide. That's certainly enough reason to fear the wolfman also making him a must during Sid's personal horror film festival (this being the 10th on the season). Now there's a lot out there in the wolf department but when given the option to see a young Corey Haim team up with Gary Busey there really was no other choice as far as we're concerned.

Silver Bullet takes place in the small town of Tarker's Mill that seems to have nothing interesting going on. Marty Coslaw (Corey Haim) is a young handicapped kid who lives at home with his parents and sister and is viewed as helpless. We'd have to suspect his experience from playing a paraplegic here helped him very much today when he pretends to be a crippled war vet begging for change outside a local diner. Anyway, a lot of extreme murders begin to take place putting the towns folk in fear. As they hunt for the killer it is soon discovered by Marty that a werewolf is doing the murders. So naturally his first option is to enlist the help of his drunk uncle Red (Busey). With a team compiled of a handicapped kid, his sister, and wasted uncle Busey how can you go wrong?

Despite the jokes Silver Bullet was a killer flick packed with some great wolf action and laughs. Unlike most, this one doesn't waste anytime with the wolf as we see a decapitation within the first 3 mins! That right there is something revered by Sid in any film. Not only was the werewolf kick a** but Gary Busey is so entertaining to watch. Especially when he builds his nephew a motorcycle wheel chair to tear around town in. Sure came in handy when he had to run from the werewolf. This one is a great choice for any fan of the genre especially if you want to see a still somewhat sane Busey on screen. Even have to give it to Haim to was really good too. Unfortunately seems he shot all his talent away early on leaving him too bad to even get cast in a horrible B. Due to the great enjoyment this one get's close with the Drive-In Totals:

2 Decapitations

1 preacher moonlighting as a werewolf

Corey Haim is very sincere and gives a great performance as Marty, the wheelchair-ridden, yet exuberant main character.  Megan Follows gives a strong, believable job as Jane, Marty's stressed and responsiblity-pounded sister.  Gary Busey, once againm, is extremely likeable as the kids' hard-drinking uncle who spoils Marty.  Everett McGill is great as the town reverand, who is the werewolf.  He does a good job making you think that he actually believes that he is saving people's souls from hell and doesn't want to be a werewolf.  The werewolf effects are a little cheezy, but this is countered by keeping the werewolf in the shadows.  The music comes on as a little sappy at a few points, but all around it is effective.  With good suspense and good pacing, Silver Bullet is a win.",1254009600,2,856,4.848275862068966

King wrote the screenplay, and fleshed out his tale by taking the time to develop the characters. I would say that Mr. King added some much needed warmth to the overall story. He also put in some interesting stuff like Corey Haims' suped-up wheelchair, the colorful townfolk, etc. to enhance the proceedings. I was impressed by Gary Busey (Predator 2) as Uncle Red. He brought a sincerity to the role. He was a caring person without being goopy about it! Everett McGill (The People Under The Stairs) was spot f-ing on as Reverend Lowe!

255015,5,6300214664,"It was probably just the result of an excellent marketing campaign, but Stephen King is known around the world as THE Master of Horror. I've read a lot of Stephen King novels and seen even more movies based on them, and I have always felt that King achieves mixed results in his work. Some of it is excellent, and some of it leaves you feeling as though he lost interest in the story and just stopped writing. Hardly the work of a ""master"". However, the one thing that King does consistently succeed at is his portrayal of childhood. King has a talent for describing the childhood that you wish that you had. The best example of this is ""The Body"" (a novella contained in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Apt-Pupil-A-Novella-in-Different-Seasons/dp/0451197127/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Apt Pupil : A Novella in Different Seasons</a>), which was turned into the movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stand-By-Me-Special-Edition/dp/B00003CXIP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stand By Me (Special Edition)</a>. A lesser known, but still equally excellent example is ""Silver Bullet"".

""Silver Bullet"", loosely based on King's ""Cycle of the Werewolf"" and scripted by King, is the story of Marty Coslaw (played by Corey Haim when he was still young and cute), a young, wheelchair-bound, boy who becomes convinced that a werewolf is murdering people in his small town in Maine. Ultimately, he convinces his sister (played by Megan Follows of ""Anne of Green Gables"" fame) and uncle (Gary Busey) that what he believes is true and together they must defeat the werewolf before it gets them.

Although ""Silver Bullet"" is an excellent horror movie that is still very watchable, even more than 20 years after it was made, it is as a film about people that this film excels. King insights into the relationship between brothers and sisters and into how things can change as people transition from childhood to adulthood are deeper than many that I have seen in award winning dramas.

This is an intelligent movie that speaks, without condescension, to the child in all of us. I would recommend this film to all children, but since many people out there are, like me, no longer children, I recommend this film to all adults too, as a way of revisiting the childhood memories you wish you had.",1200096000,2,2358,5.419618528610354
255076,3,6300214664,"As strange as it sounds, at times the acting in Silver Bullet sort of plays out and has the feel of a Lifetime movie (minus the sleaze) with the corny dialogue and B-movie feel, except that this movie is a horror movie about a werewolf who is ravaging a small town. The leading sleuth is a young boy in a wheelchair (a very young Corey Haim) who thinks that things are quite amiss in the town, and, when his friend dies, he decides to take some action. Despite the amateurish aspects of the film, it was a campy, good time watching it. It was quite reminiscent of seeing some of the 50s B-movie horror flicks with monsters, UFOs, werewolves, and things that go bump in the night.

Certainly this is not a great movie by any means, but anyone who is a horror movie junkie should check it out. It does have some mystery in its first half, where many of the townsfolk are in terror at the shock of the brutal murders of many of the people in town. Marty (Haim), who feels clued into what is going on,  tries to convince his sister and Uncle Red (played by none other than Gary Busey) that the murderer is in fact not a man, but a werewolf. At first they are reluctant to believe him, but eventually he shows them proof that this may be the case, and that, in fact, it may be one of the members of the community who is a werewolf.

While some parts (like the one where we actually get to see the confrontation with the werewolf) might have you unintentionally laughing, this is still a pretty fun movie just for its story line and plot. It is pretty cheesy and campy at times, but given that this is based on a Stephen King novel, maybe that is fitting. I believe this is a better than average film for the horror buffs, but if you are a werewolf film connoisseur, expecting more suspense and horror, I think it would be better to go with either ""An American Werewolf in London"" or one of the old Lon Chaney Jr. classic films, ""The Wolf Man.""

Still, that being said, it is definitely worth a viewing.

255077,3,6300214664,"It had been a long time since I had watched this film. I remember liking it then as a kid, but I had my doubts that I would have the same feelings about it now. In short, I was pretty right about that assumption. This movie wasn't a good as I thought it once was. Though its not a bad film, I just really couldn't get into it. The film is about a paralyzed boy that discovers that the town's reverend is actually a werewolf and that he has been responsible for a number of gruesome murders recently. With the help of his sister and his Uncle Red, they set out to kill the beast before it gets them! The basic story was decent, but there was just too many little unrealistic things that just take away from the film. Things like, oh, say a kid being able to shoot a firework DIRECTLY into a eye of a werewolf, perhaps? And then at the end of the film, being able to do the exact same thing with a gun, and make another direct hit in the other eye?? Are you kidding me? Ah, I know what you're saying..its just a movie, right? But things like this just get to me. Another thing that pissed me off was that the film didn't bother showing the dead body of the boy Brady, the main character's friend in the film. Here's the movie's chance to really do something and shock the audience by showing a dead kid, but they take the high road and don't show anything except a bloody kite..wow..scary. I can't stand when movies hold back punches, either by not having kids die in a film or not showing a kid's death. I guess I'm just a sick kinda of a guy, but I want a horror film thats not afraid to do stuff like that. Another thing I thought was dumb was that the werewolf actually used a baseball bat to kill two of its victims, which look totally ridiculous. The special effects in this film were hit and miss, in my opinion. Some of the death scenes, especially the first of the railroad worker, were pretty good. Other scenes, like the group of rednecks out in the fog getting taken out one by one by the werewolf, just looked silly. The transformation sequences were alright, but when the actual werewolf is show, it looks more like a bear than anything. Anyway, despite some of these flaws, this is still an ok little werewolf movie, but its nothing special.

255117,4,6300214664,"Silver Bullet is my favorite of Steven King's horror adaptations (yes, I do like this better than The Shining) . King even penned the screenplay himself (from his short story 'The Cycle of the Werewolf'), but since he was also responsible for the awful Maximum Overdrive, that's no solid proof of quality. But it a damn cool movie.

What makes it so different and unique is that it's horror movie told from a child's perspective (though I admit that the retrospective narration seems out of place) and has a brother/sister dynamic that's quite cute and makes you really care for the characters.

Corey Haim plays Marty Coslaw, a young boy who is confined to a wheelchair for reasons unknown. His older sister Jane is forced to take care of him and throws tantrums whenever the mum and dad take Marty's side (which is always). But the chair doesn't stop Marty from being mischievous. Especially when his manic, reckless Uncle Red (a fat Gary Busey-absolutely brilliant, as always) builds him a motorized wheelchair/bike called the Silver Bullet.

There is killer in their small town who strikes every month when the moon is full. The townsfolk gradually become more and more weary as autumn rolls on and Marty takes a personal offence when his best friend is murdered, his best girl is run out of town and a fireworks display is cancelled. Then he witnesses what the killer really is. But who is going to believe a kid's story of a werewolf? Despite the red-herrings, it's easy to figure out who it is before the main revelation. But it's still a fun mystery.

Filmed with the little-used JDC-Scope process, Silver Bullet has brilliant cinematography by Armando Nannuzzi and a wonderful score by Jay Chattaway. There's not much horror to it, but I don't think it was ever the intention to dwell on the violence. Even though I would call this film suitable for kids (despite the 18/R-rating) it's still way better than the PG-13 junk we get these days.

The film is also notable for Everett McGill (so evil as the baddie in Under Siege 2), an under-rated and under-used actor in a typically eccentric role as a charismatic Reverend. Doesn't he look like a cross between Christopher Reeve and David Hasselhoff?

A perfect Halloween movie or any night with the curtains drawn and lights off.

255119,5,6300214664,"In Stephen King's thrilling adaptation of his novelette ""Cycle of the Werewolf"", the peaceful town of Tarker's Mills is suddenly terrorized by a maniacal killer.

Corey Haim stars as Marty Coslaw, a wheelchair-bound eleven-year-old.  Megan Follows stars as Jane Coslaw, Marty's fifteen-year-old sister, who serves as the narrator of the movie.  Although Jane and Marty have their occasional brother-sister battles, they do genuinely care about each other, and this bond is shown throughout the movie.  Gary Busey stars as Uncle Red, Jane and Marty's alcoholic but caring uncle. Finally, Everett McGill stars as Reverend Lowe, pastor of the local church.

Tarker's Mills is a peaceful town until a string of brutal and unsolved murders begin to take place.  At first, the townsfolk think a madman is on the loose.  Sheriff Joe Haller (Terry O'Quinn) is facing the wrath of the townspeople for his lack of urgency in solving the murders.  Unfortunately, Marty's best friend Brady Kincaid (Joe Wright) is one of the victims.  After Brady's murder, the townspeople decide they have had enough of the sheriff's lack of success in finding the killer, so they try their own brand of vigilante justice.  Unfortunately, this ends in disaster.

After Brady's funeral, Marty begins to have suspicions about the killer.  He raises the possibility of a werewolf as being responsible to uncle Red, who justs laughs it off as totally crazy.  However, Marty is undeterred in his belief.  After the rash of murders, the town's carnival is cancelled.  Uncle Red gives Marty some fireworks as a gift, but tells him he must use them near his house.  Of course, an eleven-year-old boy with a new souped-up wheelchair isn't likely to follow directions from adults, so he heads off to a remote bridge to enjoy his fireworks.  Upon reaching the bridge, he hears rustles and movement in the surrounding woods.  In an instant, Marty comes face-to-face with a huge werewolf; just as he suspected.  He uses his last rocket to shoot at the werewolf, and it hits the wolf directly in the eye.  Marty manages to high-tail it out of there before the werewolf can regroup.

Upon reaching home, he tells his story to Jane, who is somewhat skeptical, but this time she believes her brother.  She is assigned to pick up cans and bottles for a church fund-raiser, and while she's out, she decides to look for someone who has a hurt eye.  You'll never guess who she discovers wearing an eyepatch.  Will the werewolf succeed in catching Marty, or will he and Jane outsmart the wolf?

This is a very good movie.  Stephen King wrote an excellent screenplay, and veteran director Dino De Laurentis does a fine job in bringing King's story to life.  Corey Haim and Megan Follows do fine jobs as Marty and Jane, but Gary Busey's performance as Uncle Red is the highlight of the movie.

I give this film my highest recommendation.  The acting is good, and the story is well-developed.  Horror fans (namely Stephen King fans) will surely enjoy this great werewolf film.  Watch out for the full moon.",1158019200,28,3053,4.892787524366471

255121,4,6300214664,"Tarver's Mills is a quiet little town like most other quiet little towns. Then, one night, the homicides begin. The hometown police are perplexed and the citizens grow ever more frightened. Young, crippled Marty Coslaw (Corey Haim) and his resentful sister Jane (Megan Follows) come to suspect that a werewolf is loose in their midst, committing these acts of murder. They enlist the aid of their drunken, initially skeptic Uncle Red (Gary Busey) and soon, all three find themselves in the deadliest of peril as they attempt to thwart the ravening creature of the night.

This movie is based on Stephen King's novella ""Cycle of the Werewolf"" and Stephen himself writes the screenplay. Silver Bullet is a very nice, little spookfilm and should be watched on a dark, rainy evening. Characterization is what drives this unassuming horror picture. The performance of the cast raises Silver Bullet above the other, more derivative lycanthropic shockers. Sadly, Corey Haim is an example of an actor who peaked way too early. It's indicative of his gone-to-seed movie career that his best films are Silver Bullet and The Lost Boys, both pictures taking place before Haim was seventeen. As the focus of Silver Bullet, Haim is sincere and real in his depiction of wheelchaired Marty Coslaw. Megan Follows is simply perfect as Jane, Marty's put-upon sister. Haim and Follows embody the typical quarrelsome sibling relationship of most families (Marty plays pranks on Jane; Jane calls Marty ""Booger""). But when the chips are down, they stick together. Throw their Uncle Red into that family dynamic, also. Uncle Red as winningly played by Gary Busey is the go-to adult, who is often inebriated but has enough childlike sensibilities in him to relate well to the Coslaw kids. Everett McGill, however, is exceedingly creepy as the town reverend.

The movie is simple, straightforward and doesn't try to fool anyone. The storytelling is really well done; the film takes great pains to fill in character backgrounds and then scarily ups the ante during the tension-filled scenes.  The special effects are modest but effective. The werewolf isn't cheesy-looking at all; it is, instead, suitably fearsome and gory. The werewolf transformation at the end is pretty cool, even now. The narrative voice-over (an older Jane) adds emotional gravitas to the little film. So, c'mon, give this one a try. Just make sure you turn out the lights.",1151712000,6,2419,5.103535353535354

255123,5,6300214664,"I first saw Silver Bullet in the cinema in 1986 when it was released. It was kinda dumped into cinemas without much marketing and was four years behind the big grossing werewolf films of the 1980s - The Howling and An American Werewolf In London. The result was that it did not perform at the Box Office. That is a shame because it is a little gem of a film, and is a better film than An American Werewolf in London. In fact it is up there with The Howling as the best werewolf film of the 1980s.

What makes Silver Bullet so good? It is based on Stephen King's short story The Cycle Of The Werewolf. King himself wrote the screenplay. The cast are very good in their roles and bring the tale to life with a result that you care for, and can identify with the characters as the tale unfolds. Corey Haim gives probably his best performance as the young crippled lad, Marty who has to face life (and a werewolf) in a wheel chair. Megan Follows turns in a great performance as his resentful sister Jane who is also the films narrator. Gary Busey is very good as Marty's sympathetic but alcoholic uncle. Sterling support from other actors such as Quest For Fire's Everett McGill who is superb as the town's creepy minister and Terry O'Quinlan who plays the town sheriff.

This film version of a Stephen King book succeeds so well because it brings King's book to life on the screen in a way that so many other film adaptations of King books fail badly to do. It combines the horror with the realistic depiction of everyday life. Friendship, loyalty, drunkeness, pettiness, and bigotry all feature among the townsfolk. The support crippled Marty gets from family and friends contrasts with the attitude of his girlfriend's slob of a father who thinks that cripples sponge off the welfare and should be put down....

This film succeeds where so many fail and that is to place Stephen King's warts and all depiction of humanity up there on the screen.

The horror is well catered for, scenes with the werewolf are scary and gory. The beast itself is a huge monstrousity, well brought to life by SFX whizz Carlo Rambaldi who created ET.

I do have a criticism of the dvd though and that is the mono sound. I am disappointed that if they could not put the film into 5.1, then the distributor could at least have given it a surround sound soundtrack.

I do though recommend the film to anyone who likes the genre, plus any fan of Stephen King's books who would like to see a decent adaptation up there on the screen.",1143590400,5,2506,4.460698689956332

Cast:  Gary Busey, Corey Haim, Everett McGill, Megan Follows, Robin Groves, Leon Russom, Terry O'Quinn, Bill Smitrovich.

Running Time:  95 minutes

Rated R for violence, some gore, and language.

The town of Larker's Mill is threatening with a lot of strange missing person cases. As the town celebrates it founding day, one of the townspeople is killed. Sheriff Joe Haller (Terry O'Quinn) is under pressure from the town to solve it, and he sets out to investigate. An eccentric builder, Uncle Red (Gary Busey) arrives in town to visit his nephew, Marty, (Corey Haim) a crippled teenager who is confined to a wheelchair. A third animal attack reels the town, forcing Haller to put in a curfew. That still doesn't stop the killer, only this time it is Marty's best friend, Brady (Joe Wright). His father (Kent Broadhurst) organizes a town search party to go into the woods to find the killer, but they mostly end up being killed. Only a few survive, which cancels the rest of the town's celebrations for Independence Day. Uncle Red announces that he has to go back, leaving Marty by himself. That night, he sneaks out and shoots off some fireworks and finds out that the killer is a werewolf. Wounding the werewolf, he asks his sister Jane (Megan Follows) to go around town looking for people with an eye-patch. Only one person has one, Reverend Lowe (Everett McGill). Convinced that he is right, Jane agrees to help him solve the mystery in the town and find the real killer werewolf.

Watchable, but fairly simple horror fare adapted from the Stephen King novella that uses standardized werewolf myths, kind of like King's use of vampires in ""Salem's Lot""; the werewolf morphs during full moons, for example, and can be killed by a silver bullet (hence the title). The identity of the werewolf is concealed throughout the movie, although it isn't difficult to work out and like in a plethora of horror flicks, the authorities just don't believe in werewolf-type things and the pesky kids are left to work out who it is and put an end to their evil deeds (ho hum).  The horror scenes are quite graphic and bloody, given the rating and that it's probably aimed at the teen market; there is enough there to at least bate the breath of the seasoned fan of the genre; however, the rest of the movie has the feel of a soap opera or HBO family flick, which makes the gore seem a little out of place. Gary Busey is likeable as the cheerful and bustling uncle, who drinks more than he should, while Corey Haim and Megan Follows do the all-American kid thing quite well (sorry Megan, I know you're Canadian) with their pleasant mix of cheesy smiles, fatalistic curiosity and a little brother-sister tension thrown into the mix. Haim's character is wheelchair-bound, and although the psychological ramifications of this aren't well explored, at least Busey builds him nice motorized hot-rod type.  Not the best werewolf movie ever made, but certainly not the worst either.",1141171200,,2990,4.799610894941634

255179,4,6300214664,"Let me be perfectly honest and admit that this is one of my all-time favorite throwbacks to the 1980s. Stephen King adapted his own novella, Cycle of the Werewolf, into what is essentially a very entertaining and character driven horror film. King has always had a knack for creating characters we care about, and ""Silver Bullet"" is certainly no exception to that time honored fact.

I don't understand why some people went into this looking for a gorefest. That's not what this movie is about. Contrary to some rather erroneous reviews, the special effects we do have in this film are very well executed and don't overwhelm or diminish the story in any way. The one thing people should remember with any horror film is that gore, in itself, is not intrinsically frightening. The key to pulling it off successfully is to present it in a way that goes hand in hand with the story you're trying to tell. Having gore in a movie simply because there's a werewolf is silly if you don't care about what's going on. But, that's just my opinion.

Gary Busey, as many here have already reported, is very entertaining as Uncle Red. It was refreshing to see him playing a nice guy for a change, and his interaction with the kids as they try to convince him of what's going on was teriffic.

This was simply a great movie. And you don't have to be a Stephen King fan to enjoy it either. It's one of those films that will please just about anybody.",1128038400,5,1435,4.5115384615384615

Well, I always thought it was boring, but I kept watching it so I wouldn't feel bad that I spent 15 dollars on it. Well, I've finally come to terms with myself, and I'm going to get rid of it. Stephen King is a phenomenal writer, he's written some of the scariest stuff to ever hit the printing press. But this garbage, it just sucks. The werewolf transformations suck (just more proof that just because a movie is more recent, doesn't mean its more realistic); absolutely nothing compared to The Howling or AWiL. The dumb narration doesn't work, it makes it feel more like a drama than a horror (narration only works when the narrator has a dark, brooding voice, such as the voice of Vincent Price or the guy who narrated Black Sunday in the beginning), and it is simply not scary. Thats its biggest flaw, of course, it being a horror movie. I never care about great performances (unless the acting is just obviously terrible, and you can tell there is a camera being shoved in their face; i.e. Sorority House Massacre 2), but a movie has to at least be creepy. This trash can't even manage to do that. I'm not so sure it even takes itself seriously with all of the dumb dialogue (Ya gonna make lemonade in ya pants or what?). This movie fails as a teen drama, a comedy, and most importantly, a horror film. You want a great and scary werewolf film, of course The Howling, AWiL, and Lon Chaney's The Wolfman should be at the top of your list, but also check out the little known gem Bad Moon and an older but still really good film, Curse of the Werewolf, starring Oliver Reed.",1125100800,2,1730,4.409375

Now to the plot holes of this movie. First, how does this kid sneak away from home to the abandoned bridge on an unreasonably loud power wheel chair? Since when could werewolfs use base ball bats? How are we supposed to emphazie with a character who forgets his dead best friend so quickly? (He's only sad for one scene) How can a drunk, a cripple and a bookworm explain a dead naked priest with two missing eyes in their house? Even if their parents who are coming back the next day will understand, Busey will fry.

There are some genuinely suspenseful scenes in the film and it's great one to watch late at night or on Halloween.  I would also recommend reading the Stephen King novel (Cycle of the Werewolf) upon which the film is based.  In my opinion it is one of his finest works.,1118880000,,565,4.252336448598131

His sister knows that he is a royal pain in the backside but she also knows his character and believes him. She discovers the identity of the lycanthropist. Unfortunately, the wolf also learns theirs. The stage is set for a confrontation.

One of the things I like about this movie is that it depicts young people able to act well and make good decisions in spite of the attitude of the adults.

255211,4,6300214664,"Based on a novella written by author Stephen King titled Cycle of the Werewolf, Silver Bullet (1985) falls into the area of being very good, while not on the same level of other movies based on King stories like The Shining (1980) or Christine (1983), but certainly not dwelling in the depths of cruddiness like Maximum Overdrive (1986), which, by the way was the only film King ever directed, which says a lot based on how many of his stories have been adapted to the big and little screens.  I remember when Maximum Overdrive came out, and King made such a big deal about his directing it, saying something along the lines of if you want something done right, you have to do it yourself...boy did that film flop.  Anyway, thankfully Silver Bullet wasn't directed by King, but was put into the more capable hands of a man named Dan Attias, who later went on to work almost exclusively directing television episodes for such shows like SledgeHammer, Jake and the Fatman, Melrose Place, Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman and so on...the film lists a pretty impressive cast with Gary Busey (prior to his 1988 near-fatal motorcycle accident where he suffered massive head injuries), Corey Haim before he became really annoying (that period began shortly after the film The Lost Boys (1987) and has yet to end), perennial screen meany Everett McGill, and a young Megan Follows, who I most remember as Anne from the Anne of Green Gables series.  Also appearing in minor roles are Terry O'Quinn, probably most memorable as the psychotic killer step dad from the Stepfather films, and veteran actor Lawrence Tierney, who many would remember best as the gruff, curmudgeonly old man Joe Cabot from Quentin Tarantino's breakout film Reservoir Dogs (1992).

As the film begins, we're presented with an older female narrative voice speaking of past events, specifically a particularly horrific series of events over the period of a summer long since past.  As the voice speaks, we are transported back to the unspecified time, and witness a fairly brutal decapitation of a lone rail yard worker, which, apparently was just the precursor to horror yet to come.  Soon afterwards we meet Marty Coslow (I thought it was Coleslaw, until I saw the credits), played by Haim.  A prior, unmentioned accident has caused the loss of use of Marty's legs, confining him to a wheelchair, but he seems to have adapted well, especially with the diesel powered wheelchair his Uncle Red (Busey) built for him.  Marty has a older sister named Jane (Follows), who is also the narrator at the beginning of the film, and they seem to have a very normal pre-teen sibling relationship where Marty plays pranks on Jane, and Jane gets frustrated with him because she believes their parents let him get away with much due to his condition.  Despite Marty's condition, the relationship mirrors most any sibling relation consisting of varying degrees of love and hate.  We also meet Uncle Red, a boozy, affable fellow who shares a special relationship with his nephew Marty, and also with Jane to some degree, based on the obvious indications that, while he is an adult, he still maintains a childlike quality of an adult who never grew up.  He's the uncle you wish you had, the one to get you into R-rated movies, cover for you if you skipped school, buy you fireworks, etc.

Anyway, as the summer wears on, so do the murders.  The nature of the killings is obviously well beyond anything local law enforcement is accustom to (think Sheriff Taylor and Deputy Barney Fife in Mayberry, only without the humor), and the townspeople begin to get very agitated at the inability of the sheriff to find the killer.  Based on the viciousness of the murders and the title of the film, we know it's probably a werewolf, but within the context of the film and the story, something like that is just too fantastic...that is, until Marty has a run in with the supernatural creature.  Barely escaping, whom can he tell?  His sister?  He does, to which she doesn't initially completely believe him, until she comes across proof herself.  Really, the only one they can turn to is Uncle Red, who thinks they're crazy, but is willing to go along if only to help placate his upset nephew and niece, and also, maybe because he still retains a bit of the ability to see the world through the eyes of a child, all the wondrous and horrific elements adults may not notice, as they're too consumed with the reality of life.  So a member of the town is a werewolf?  Possibly...you will probably figure it out well before the identity is revealed, and there is a certain amount of predictability inherent in the story, but neither of these elements seem to spoil the film any.  The effects within the film may not win anyone any awards, but they are adequate and even pretty good at some points, but since the story doesn't solely rely on this aspect, I had very little problems with it.  It's the characters in the story that enthralled me, and their very realistic and seemingly sincere relationships that sells this movie more than anything else for me.  I truly liked them, and found them wholly interesting, thus I was concerned and even scared for them, when danger presented itself.  I enjoyed all the characters here, but I thought Busey was particularly good, playing a role that probably fit his personality very well.  The movie has a lot of heart, while avoiding the mushiness that so often accompanies it.  Kind of strange to talk of such these with regards to a horror movie, but there you go.

If you're a fan of special features, you'll be disappointed because there is really any, except maybe if you count English subtitles.  The wide screen anamorphic print looks good, although the audio seemed a bit soft at times.

255212,4,6300214664,"While this movie has few of the bone chilling moments of ""An American Werewolf in London"" or ""The Howling,"" it still has moments where it is fascinating and at least a couple of places where the tension rises. Helping along the way are Gary Busey as Marty Coslaw's (Corey Haim) Uncle Red, Megan Follows as Marty's sister Jane, and Everett McGill as creepy Reverend Lowe.

 There are murders happening in and around town, and Marty is convinced it is the work of a werewolf, with whom he has a close encounter; a really close encounter. At first no one believes Marty, as you would expect, but then Jane is convinced. Finally Uncle Red is sort of convinced. The tension builds until the night that Jane and Marty's parents are away from home and Uncle Red stays with Marty, Jane, and a single silver bullet.

 While there are other werewolf movies with a higher scare factor, this one remains one of my favorites. I will watch this movie sooner than many others just because it is familiar and the characters are generally likable. It is like a cartoon in many ways, but these same qualities make it an easy to watch movie. There are a few intense moments to spike up the movie, including the encounter between Marty and the werewolf on an isolated walking bridge at night in the country, another encounter between a group of citizens out to hunt the murderer, and encounters between the werewolf in his human form and Jane and Marty.

Every month, when the moon is at its fullest, the usually quiet town of Tarker's Mills is visited by what the townspeople think is a homicidal maniac. Mutilated corpses begin to turn up and a curfew is administered upon the residents of Tarker's Mills. One crippled boy nevertheless decides to ignore the curfew - which led to the cancellation of the Fourth of July Fireworks - and meets the mysterious murderer face-to-face one night. So begins a quest to discover the true idenity of this monster.
Daniel Attias has produced one of the creepiest Stephen King films ever with 'Silver Bullet'. The screenplay (written by King) is an adaptation of his novella, 'Cycle of the Werewolf', about a lycanthrope who hunts down the townspeople of Tarker Mills. The film is well paced and has a 'whodunnit' feel, as well as plenty of extremely scary moments that will ensure you do not head for the 'eject' button, feeling you have wasted your hard earned dollars.
Moreover, there is a great cast here, headed by veteran actor Gary 'Point Break' Busey, Corey 'The Lost Boys' Haim, and Terry 'The Stepfather' O'Quinn.
I first watched this film when it came out for rental in the mid-eighties and it scared the bejezus out of me. So, take the nightmare ride of your life through the fog shrouded woods of Tarker's Mills, but beware the moon.

anything especially the scenes in which Brady and Tammy get ""torn to pieces"" by the Werewolf. This movie is an adaptation from the Stephen King's ""Cycle of the Werewolf""..But
certain hallmarks of King such as the origin of the evil and it's reason for killing etc..are missing ,neverthless it is a treat .

I saw this as a kid first and never thought I'd sleep again.  Usually Stephen King's work is turned into drivel, but with this one, everyone involved succeeded on every level.  Probably because SK actually wrote the screenplay, so it was adapted by him.  Whatever the cause, it rocks.  I've seen a TON of horror pics in my life, and few of them hold up past the age of 10 in terms of terror.  But not this one...I recently got the DVD and watched it alone (bad idea) thinking I had imbellished the fear over the years, but no...this still scares me senseless.  And the special effects on the warewolf are unbelievably good, not just for ""way back then"", but for now too.

255261,1,6300214664,"Maybe this will appeal to 12 year olds and under, but it's a terrible, trashy, boring piece of horror movie making.  Stephen King's usual ham-handed, broad-brush, uninspired, I'm-so-bored, I'm-so-clever no-surprises writing and plotting, the kind of thing he probably prides himself on knocking off in a day or two--and it really shows.  On paper, King's chatty style can mask the lack of plot or invention--the screen removes the style and the Emperor's new clothes are revealed.  A werewolf is terrorizing a small town, but only little wheelchair-bound Martin knows that it's really the town's minister who has become a werewolf (nobody, including King, knows how--or why he chooses this particular time to begin werewolfing on the side).  The bad guys are really bad, really gross, they get killed immediately, and there is a Halloween night showdown that has almost no suspense or thrills.  Spunky little Martin demands that his alcoholic uncle get a silver bullet made for him so they can kill the creature.  Gary Busey manages not to look embarrassed throughout, a tribute to his acting skills, but ""Abbot and Costello Meet the Wolfman"" has about twenty times the entertainment value.",1027987200,5,1190,5.171875

255283,4,6300214664,"You don't normally expect to find well-crafted characters in horror movies, which is why SILVER BULLET can catch a first-time viewer by surprise. There are suspenseful scenes aplenty, but it really is the characters and their relationships that make this movie stand out. Corey Haim is Marty, eleven years old and reliant on a motorized wheelchair to get around. Megan Follows is his fifteen year old sister Jane, jealous of the special attention her brother gets because of his disability. Their parents are Bob and Nan, and Nan's brother is played by Gary Busey. Uncle Red is the sort of relative that families are not proud of and would probably rather not associate with at all; it's unfortunate for Nan then that Red loves his nephew Marty so much.
Marty is just getting old enough to realise that Red isn't exactly an exemplary human being. Early in the film a friend of Marty's scares Jane with a snake, causing her to fall flat in a puddle of muddy water and ruin the outfit she's been showing off. It's the sort of prank that a brother would pull on a sister and then immediately regret it, and Marty's face shows the regret not only at that moment, but later at night when he gives Jane money to help make up for it even though it wasn't his fault. At that point she apologises for verbally wounding Marty in retaliation by telling him that Uncle Red, his idol, is a useless drunk.
Because Marty gets preferential treatment from everyone, Jane always feels like she gets no attention, and that carries over to some of the reviews on this site that mention she's a minor character. The importance of her character (especially as the emotional center of the film) is too easily overlooked. When Marty confesses his nighttime encounter with a werewolf to her, she believes him enough to help look for evidence the next day, and her experience leaves her utterly convinced that Marty's story is the truth. At that point the familial relationship between brother and sister (and eventually Uncle Red) begins to strengthen until it reaches its peak at the film's very end with a heartfelt and touching (and not at all saccharine) piece of narration. The movie is narrated by Tovah Feldshuh as a grown-up Jane, and it takes place in the summer of 1976 (just ignore those anachronistic Diet Coke cans in the garage). It's a combination of the beautifully-done narration, the unusually romantic score and the genuinely good acting and interaction between the leads (Haim, Everett McGill as the town's concerned Reverend Lowe, and especially Follows and Busey) that gives the movie an almost lyrical sweetness that not only is unexpected from a low-budget horror movie but also quite simply *works*.
This DVD edition is quite nice in the area of picture quality. Anamorphic widescreen at about 2.35:1, good contrast and sharpness, nothing distracting like severe edge enhancement or anything. A very pleasing image. Sound is good too... but the disc falls flat in the area of extras. Basically, there aren't ANY. One wishes they could have included the commentary that comes with the R2 edition (I believe).

255287,4,6300214664,"Words can't describe the joy I received when I discovered the movie Silver Bullet was going to be released on DVD. Originally released in 1985, Silver Bullet is based on a novelette created by horror writer Steven King in which a young boy (Cory Haim) discovers the grizzly murders happening in his sleepy little town are actually the result of a werewolf. A sharp contrast to the majority of horror movies being released at the time, Silver Bullet was not filled with sex crazed teenagers being killed off one by one. If you can imagine the concept, this horror movie actually tries to highlight the love of family and unbreakable spirit of youth. This is most definitely shown in the relationship between the character Marty and his sister and uncle. That said, this movie is not lacking in the scare department either. There are several sequences in this movie to make even the most jaded of horror fans jump in anticipation. And the best part of this film is: it's always fun to watch! How many movies can guarantee that? So as a movie, Silver Bullet will bring constant entertainment. Unfortunately as a DVD release, the entertainment quotient is only marginal. Silver Bullet was actually released on DVD in 2001 for countries belonging to Region 2 (U.K.) and with a few items that are not released on the U.S./Canadian release. Those features being: the original movie trailer and director commentary by Daniel Attias. Though those great features are not on this release, we are benefitted with Dolby Sterio, Widescreen/Letterbox, Chapter Selection, Close Captioning and subtitles in English and French. So although I'm overjoyed that I get to see this great movie in DVD quality and sound, I'm also from the camp that expects movies that are released on DVD to supply the viewing audience with special features that are not normally included on a general video release. ie. original trailer, actor/director commentary, cast bios, behind the scenes/making of featurette, deleted scenes, interviews, etc. It's because of this that I hesitantly give the DVD release only 4 stars instead of 5.",1017187200,4,2096,4.991428571428571

255337,4,6300214664,"This film by Stephen King is very effective as for fear and suspense. The trick of the film, that I cannot reveal, is that the werewolf is THE person no one would suspect. The great merit of the film is that the werewolf is killed by a young handicapped boy and by his sister, with the help of their uncle and a silver bullet, of course. This executioning team is not a surprise in Stephen King's world of suspense. There is somewhere in his world the belief that only people who believe in dreams and nightmares, i.e. children, can confront and destroy evil in this world. The theme of the handicapped person at the center of the tale is common in King's books and many have to be quoted :  The Talisman ,  The Stand , for example. We could do the same thing with girls :  Carrie ,  The Firestarter , for two. The only shortcoming of the film is that we do not feel the twelve month cycle of the original novella that was written for a special calendar. But I guess this is not very important here. We can also regret the systematic compliance of King with the tradition when he deals with monsters like vampires or werewolves, and lately extraterrestrials. They are monsters, and nothing else, that have to be destroyed. There is never any kind of second vision, regeneration, epiphany.

Stephen King adapted his novella Cycle of the Werewolf to be even bloodier and more terrifying on screen.  Changing such things as the body count to the lunar cycle restraints for the Werewolf's savage killings King made an extremely entertaining Werewolf film possible.  The film is a bit dated in the special effects department, but for some reason that only adds to the appeal.  Knowing that at the time it was filmed the effects were top notch and the story keeping to key elements of the novella.  Such as who the Werewolf is and that the protagonist, Marty is still a parapalegic.  Great performances by Gary Busey as ""cool"" Uncle Red and Everett McGill (later to be seen in Wes Craven's The People Under the Stairs).  The atmosphere and small town element are two of King's endearing qualities as a writer, he really can write about a tightly knit community.  Some really graphic death scenes and a sometime silly looking/sometime frightening Werewolf make this a perrenial favorite of any Horror film buff!  I recommend buying and reading Cycle of the Werewolf and then buying Silver Bullet.  For Horror fans, for Stephen King fans, and for movie fans in general this a great way to kill a rainy afternoon or a dark October night.

7805990,4,6300214664,"Loosely based (as most low budget 80's movie versions of Stephen King books were) on the Junior/YP novellete Cycle of the Werewolf, which basically was a kids/teen audience short story padded out with illustration pages.  This early 80's (set in the late 70's) movie is a rarity, where the main character has a physical disability (he's paralyzed from the waist down and confined to a wheel chair).  So that's refreshing in itself and worth the rental/purchase price alone.  The movie does have a very 80's look to it, the wheelchairs aren't the type used anymore, and The Silver Bullet (the awesome invention the boy's uncle makes for him) is actually pretty common if not a little obsolete in these days of golf cart type mobility vehicles for the disabled. The dialogue was politically correct for its time with Marty referred to by even his own family who love and are overprotective of him as a cripple, but may be offensive to oversensitive viewers today.  But saying that for a horror film, there's no nudity, no sex scenes, not much blood and gore, and the werewolf in the days before CGI, well looks pretty fake.  So the oversensitive viewer should actually like this one.

The movie is also further dated by the fact that kids are allowed to journey outside for hours on their own (even Marty) and no parents freak out. This is the era I was a little kid in it and it was awesome.  Today parents freak out when their in mid conversation with a kid and it moves out of eyesight into the next aisle of a department store. But the 80's feel to it adds something to the enjoyment factor.  Basically the plot has a number of residents being killed off by an attacker in a small town.  Marty (Corey Haim) believes it to be a werewolf but his family doesn't believe him, even his uncle Red (Gary Busey) who often while drunk, treats him more like a regular kid than his parents do.  Marty's older sister Jane (Megan Follows - the title character actress from Anne of Green Gables/Avonlea) also lives with the frustration that Marty can do no wrong in her mother's eyes, and any interactions with him are her fault.  Marty is getting annoyed with the werewolf after it's actions cost him a best friend, as well as the only girl interested in him to leave town.  He wants it dead but is going to need the help of his fed up with him sister, as well as his drunk uncle to end it's rein of terror.

It's low budget, the father of a victim wears the same suit he wore to work when he found out for the rest of the film no matter what the circumstance for example.  Sort of like kids putting on a school play, here's your costume and you wear if the whole time.  So it sort of oozes a fair bit of cheesiness but it all adds to the fun.",1525737600,,2732,4.403578528827038
7805991,3,6300214664,"RELEASED IN 1985 and directed by Daniel Attias, ""Silver Bullet"" chronicles events in a small town in Eastern America when a ferocious werewolf starts picking people off one-by-one. Corey Haim and Megan Follows play the adolescent brother/sister protagonists, the boy being a paraplegic. Gary Busey appears as the amiable alcoholic uncle while Robin Groves plays the mother. Everett McGill is on hand as a prominent minister while Terry O'Quinn appears as the sheriff.

Stephen King wrote both the novella and the screenplay and so the movie has the comic book vibe of movies based on Kings works. The townspeople are unsurprisingly cartoonish, but the main family is well done, i.e. realistic. In any case, Silver Bullet seems quaint compared to the three werewolf flicks of 1981: The Howling, An American Werewolf in London and Wolfen (of course the latter wasn't strictly a werewolf flick, if at all). Nevertheless, I appreciate the old fashioned take on the subject and the warmth of the family members. The werewolf is Grade B when fully revealed, but certainly formidable.

The film conveys cinematic stereotypes, like the goodhearted drunk (or prostitute) and the corrupt civic leader, who puts on a fake smile for the community while being a savage beast within. Although theres some truth to these depictions, most of the time a drunkard is an alcoholic because his/her heart is desperately flawed. And the bulk of respected community leaders aren't evil incarnate. Yet I like the way the movie shows how everything is not necessarily as it appears.

THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour, 35 minutes and was shot in North Carolina (Burgaw, Leland, Wilmington, Castle Hayne and Carolina Beach).

GRADE: B-/C+",1525737600,,1700,5.126353790613718

7805993,5,6300214664,"Finally that this classic 80's horror flick has arrived on 1080p blue ray! Picture quality is an upgrade over it's standard dvd version and it is a good transfer and crisp. Now the movie and without spoilers,this is one of those movie that you would want to watch on those rainy days or late night creature feature flicks. Lots of scary scenes on this one and the actors are great starring Gary Busey and with the late Corey Haim in it along with Canadian actress Megan Follows. A good werewolf movie except the creature looks a bit more like a grizzly bear than a werewolf but then again still terrifying at best. Special effects are old school on this one during the werewolf transformation scene but this is the 80's so you'll have to be a little forgiving if you're a younger viewer. Too bad that this Blu ray did not come with a digital download cause I would have loved to have this on my mobile device to go! This film is a classic and a must have and surely in the league of those Hammer british films.",1524700800,,1010,4.349206349206349
7805994,4,6300214664,"I don't have any issues with this product, as even though the movie is a bit cheezy, it is still fun. It's nice to have on blu-ray, and the audio and picture are decent enough.

But, the one I got (blu-ray), which I can't imagine would be a one off, the audio is very, very slightly off. So slight it is barely noticeable, but once you notice it.....it does drive you a little crazy. Especially with the dialogue.

Curious if anyone else noticed this, or if I really did get the only one that does that?",1524441600,,503,4.229166666666667

It absolutely DOES work on an American A/1-coded Blu-ray player. Loads of extras,
and the picture is BEAUTIFUL!",1522713600,,193,4.878787878787879
7805998,2,6300214664,I read the book. Outstanding novella. Why do Hollywood directors feel they can improve upon best-selling novel ? The movie was cheesy and unentertaining,1522627200,,152,5.375
