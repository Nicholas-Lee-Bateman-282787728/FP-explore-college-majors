905544,5,6304619413,"This is my 13 year-old son's first year as a running back.  I wanted something to fire him up and to give him a positive role model in this world of ""selfish, greedy athletes"".  This was the ticket. He watches it every week before the games.  His second and third efforts on the football field have become second nature because of Walter's never-quit attitude.  This was more inspirational than I ever expected. I feel it is a must-have for every football lover's video collection.  God bless Walter!",974505600,5,500,4.7011494252873565

As soon as it finished I rewound it and watched it all over again. This is the best video  biography's ever, a must for every Bears/Payton/football fan.",940464000,7,267,4.448979591836735

7875368,4,6304619413,"Pretty representative of Walter's career.  He directed this himself, so it is exactly what he wanted the public to see",1323216000,,118,4.9
7875369,4,6304619413,"As former Bears Coach Mike Ditka said

once, the best Football player he ever

saw and I second that! How many of us

remember all the charitible causes Walt

did? Not to mention the records: First

alltime in NFL rushing and career total

yards when he retired. He also threw 8

TDs, 7 right handed, noe left handed.

He averaged 44.+ yds., per quick kick

during his career, had an INT as reserve

Safety once and even played QB for one

full quarter when the Bears ran out of

bodies back in 1984. Simply Put, Pure

Payton. They'll never be another better,

so get this while you can!",1150329600,,587,4.314814814814815
7875370,5,6304619413,"I have literally watched this video 35 times and I can never seem to get enough. Every time I watch it I come away with more insight about Walter himself. Growing up in Chicago I came to know and appreciate Walter on a local level, but since his death I have come to appreciate him more and more. This is a must see video if you need inspiration or an uplift.",1043452800,5,359,4.070422535211268
7875371,4,6304619413,"Untill now i've only seen him in the music videoclip ""Superbowl Shuffle"" and his first and only Superbowl appearance. Man, i've been rewinding the video a lot times to view it once again. It gets me pumped up everytime viewing it. He's a bull with a grace of an antelope. Now i understand why he's such a legend. Powerhouse stuff!",1021593600,3,330,4.516666666666667
7875372,3,6304619413,"Not quite as personal or probing as the ESPN Sports Century biographical piece was, but this video is still enjoyable to watch, with a lot of great plays, and some insight into Sweetness' life.",1006992000,,193,4.705882352941177
7875373,5,6304619413,"Should be mandatory viewing for anyone who is experiencing a down
time in life.  A real picker-upper.  Recommend reading ""Never Die
Easy"" - The man, in life and in death, left a legacy which proves you can attain your hopes and desires if you are willing to POSITIVELY direct your energies in that direction.  Videos and books regarding the Great Payton must be included with all the masters of ""positive thinking"" and ""goal setting""!",999907200,3,434,4.837837837837838
7875374,5,6304619413,"The title says it all.
I watch this video once a week at least. I can't get enough. There is so much footage of ""Sweetness"" running, blocking, and throwing. Payton personally supervised this project, so it is essentially his autobiography on video. You also hear from Ditka, McMahon, Singletary, and others.",999216000,2,307,5.03921568627451
7875375,4,6304619413,"In it you'll not only find Walter greatest runs, dives and jumps, you will also find a piece of legend, a charismatic human which range of influence ran far off football. This video is great because it's such a strong advocate for a sport sometimes underevaluated. Along with the incredible runs, stiff arms or Td's only Payton could make, you'll find a unique positive and winning attitude for every young player to watch. But 50 mins, that's short !!",987984000,5,452,4.734177215189874
