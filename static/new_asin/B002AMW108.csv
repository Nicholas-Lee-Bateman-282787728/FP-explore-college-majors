3890470,3,B002AMW108,"I've watched most of the episodes of ""Flapjack"" ever since Summer 2008, a while after it premiered, and I don't really like it. Some of the characters are disturbing to me, such as Peppermint Larry, who's somewhat mentally unstable, but friendly, and has a fake wife that he made out of candy, Dr. Barber, who, in a later episode, creates fish-headed monsters that give people bad haircuts and try to take over the world, and some of the one-episode characters, like, in the episode where Flapjack thinks that babies come from seaweed, thanks to a lie that Bubbie, a whale that's his adoptive mom, tells him, and he mistakes a duck for a baby and adopts it, near the end of it, the duck escapes with its family and flies away, and Flapjack is upset that no one will play with him, so a small baby-like man, who acts and looks like a baby, walks up to him and says that he will play with him, Flapjack tells him to grow up, and the baby-like man reveals that he is thirty-eight years old and then his body changes to a wrinkled-up, disturbing-looking, small body, to the demented, disturbing mechanical genie and giant baby in the ""Mechanical Genie Island"" episode, to the disturbing Lord Hotcakes pancake factory ruler and the decomposing-yet-animated pancake creature on the episode that features them. Also, in almost every episode, the end of it leaves Flapjack and K'nuckles in situations that they could never get out of, leading to many, many plot holes. The reason why I'm giving it a three out of five stars is that, some of the earlier episodes are pretty good, such as the ones where the aircraft-making scientist/inventor and the underwater-craft making scientist/inventor are in them, the ""Snarked!"" episode, and the ""That's A Wrap!"" episode. Basically, the ""Flapjack"" cartoon is barely an okay cartoon, but I don't think that, when compared to cartoons like ""Dexter's Laboratory"", ""Ed Edd N Eddy"", ""Chowder"", ""DragonBall Z"", ""Voltron(Lion Voltron)"", ""Thundercats"", and ""Pokemon"", it's a good cartoon at all.",1247702400,2,2020,4.909356725146199
3890471,5,B002AMW108,"Out of several cartoon shows that appear on Cartoon Network, The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack stands out. It is very unique and entertaining, just like Chowder.

The main characters of the show is a young adventure seeking and candy loving boy named Flapjack, and his maple syrup drinking pirate buddy Captain K'nuckles. Also we have the always protective and loving whale, Bubbie, who raised Flapjack since he was an infant.

The series follows the trio as they partake on adventures on Stormalong Harbor and beyond. Always seeking a way to get to Candied Island, or at least getting some free candy from Peppermint Larry.

The show has a great deal of entertainment value, but some may disagree with me. But all of us are entitled to our own opinion. Personally, I really like the show and its unique characters. The animation is different, plus like Chowder, it utilizes stop-motion animation!

Below is a list of episodes and special features that are included on The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack, Volume One.

1. Several Leagues Under The Sea/Cammie Island
2. Several Leagues Above The Sea/That's A Wrap
3. Lookin' For Love In All The Wrong Barrels/Beard Buddies
4. Skooled/Snarked
5. Capatain and ToeNeil (never seen it before, possibly wrong one listed or it may be a brand new never before seen episode)

Special Features
- Adventures in Voice Acting Featurette
- Adventures in Animation Featurette
- Misadventures in Song Featurette
- Meet Thurop! Featurette

My advice, if your a fan of the series or if you actually like it, buy it. It's a good series with some interesting characters and unique animation. Pre-order your copy and enjoy!",1244332800,27,1662,5.0218181818181815

3890506,3,B002AMW108,"Flapjack ran from 2008-2010 on Cartoon Network and was a delightful show. It was absurd, disturbing, gross, but almost always funny. They show reminded me a bit of cartoons from the early 90s - Ren and Stimpy, Rockos Modern Life, etc.

This DVD, like some reviewers has said, is a rather pathetic release. It has a the first five episodes (broken into two, 10 minute segments) and a few behind the scenes extras.

There was a volume 2, but sadly no season set was ever released. However, a re-issue of Volume 1 was released in October 204, hopefully signifying that CN has some renewed interest in future sets.

Flapjack needs a proper dvd release (and if there is a cartoon god, a blu ray release!). This program helped a lot of the future CN showrunners - Pendleton Ward, storyboard artist (created Adventure Time), J.G. Quintel, storboard artist and writer (created regular show), and Alex Hirsch - storybaord artist and writer (created Gravity Falls). Some of the biggest cartoons airing right now owe a lot of their success to this series. It is an absolute crime to not have any more episodes on DVD.

Please Cartoon Network, do us all a solid and bring this show back.",1429488000,9,1175,4.689320388349515

3890524,5,B002AMW108,"Although it was canceled , it was a really good cartoon , FOR ADULTS. Silly writers what were you thinking? Back a few years ago kids could have adults as friends , my sis and I would often spend hours at the neighbors house and listen to him tell us stories of depression and war. Now a days that pour guy would be considered a bad guy by the public at large. As for Knuckles, he's just nuts and so is Flapjack. Bubby is the only sane one in the whole bunch! The folks in down town Storm A long are quite salty , I guess all that fish and seawater has made them that way. There is Peppermint Larry and Candy wife(whats eating her),the Dock Hag(someone from N.O.W.) and my favorite Dr. Barber(hair cut anyone) ?
I guess the rest of the seasons will come when we all get Candy Island, until then we will all have to stay safe at the dock, which is NO place for an Adventurer!",1415059200,,874,4.116959064327485

It's a silly but sometimes dark cartoon that has legitimate characters.

It is a fantastic cartoon, with an incredible art style. Doctor Barber, Lady Nicklebottom (m'lady), Punsy McHale, and of course World Famous Comedian...Lolly Poopdeck, to name a few characters. ""Candy island, makes me smilin', dance and chew bubblegum doo doo, well I brush my teeth on a jelly bean reef, grab a peppermint leaf, sip the licorice dew!"" is a requested bed time song from my kids.

However, this is an incredibly weak offering, and I just cannot bring myself to give it the 5 stars the show deserves because this DVD product is horrible.  And I just recently found out the show was pulled...how disappointing, especially after only two seasons. On top of that, I moved and changed cable providers, so lost all those episodes I had on the DVR. So I look to Amazon to see if there is a DVD collection, but find this. Pathetic.  Seriously? 4-5 episodes?? Not even worthy of the expired candy barrel. Whoever marketed this DVD is in need of some serious ""surrrrgery,"" because this DVD set requires a serious dose of maple syrup, and in its current state should be fed to Eight-Armed Willy or sent west to the edge of the world. I don't even care about special features (although I would welcome them), I just want both complete seasons, on maybe TWO DVDs (which I would buy immediately!), not this 4-5 episodes-a-pop foolishness.

Actually, 10.

You got five 22 minute episodes, but in them, about two 10 minute episodes.

So your paying for 10 adventures. When your done adventuring, theres a nice little piece of extras- wait, EXTRAS?!

While not meaty, it is a surprising and welcoming addition to this volume one set. any fan of the show will get a kick out of the creator's tale of what sorta inspired him to make this show. Then, watching him sing with his angelic voice as Flapjack makes it all the more welcoming.

The other stuff, and terrific box-art both front and back, makes this a set to own for any fan of the show.

I will agree with others, a season one set, or even a half-season set, would be all the more swell, but hey, this volume 1 could be a lot worse.

3890607,5,B002AMW108,"In a world overwhelmed by insipid and ridiculously simple cartoons, the great adventurer Flapjack comes from his humble beginnings from the harbor town of Stormalong to save us from corporate mediocrity.  Flapjack doesn't delude itself, even in its third season, the way many current nautical series have.  It remains true to how it started, even with it's quick rise in popularity.

The premise of Flapjack is very simple-- young boy who follows around a maple-syrup drunkard (with a good heart) in order to attain the only two important goals in the world: becoming an adventurer and finding Candied Island.  Even though the life of an adventurer is wrought with danger, they are protected by a very warm and lovable whale which doubles as their sea vessel.  They encounter a vast array of characters, from the candy-tender Peppermint Larry and his slightly controlling but silent Candy wife, to the sinister but absolutely likable Doctor Barber, to all the highly detailed inhabitants of Stormalong.

In a nutshell--buy this DVD.  Watch this show.  It'll make your life happier and give you a reason to smile.  My girlfriend and I know this from experience!",1265500800,,1160,5.063157894736842
3890608,4,B002AMW108,"Are you lookin' for adventure filled with action, thrills, and candy beyond your wildest fantasies ?  Then look no further than ""The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack"" where we join the so-called adventures of a young and enthusiastic boy named Flapjack along with his pal Captain K'nuckles and his whale Bubbie.

There are 10 misadventures in Volume 1 such as:

""Several Leagues Under the Sea"" - Flapjack's bragging has suddenly pits Bubbie against a mechanical whale.

""The Sweet Life"" - Flapjack learns to be a more proper gentleman, but becomes a problem for K'nuckles.

""Several Leagues Above the Sea"" - An inventor attempts to grant Bubbie's wish to explore the skies.

""Cammie Island"" - Flapjack and K'nuckles get stranded on a seemingly deserted island where they befriend a lonely giant.

Along with these episodes there's a treasure trove of bonus features which are ""Adventures in Voice Acting"" (a behind-the-scenes recording session), ""Adventures in Animation"" (a bit of a Making-of feature), ""Misadventures in Song"" (the music of ""Flapjack"") and ""Meet Thurop"" (an interview with creator AND voice of Flapjack Thurop Van Orman).

Whether he's searching for the fabled Candy Island or finding some fun at Stormalong Harbor, it seems that every day is an adventure for Flapjack.

3890610,1,B002AMW108,"I know some people don't like these ""reviews"" where the person isn't actually reviewing the product, but this needs to be said. This release is weak, and it's what Warner Bros. seems to do best. This is my favorite new cartoon, and the episodes featured here are good. I don't own this release, but I don't have to to tell you it's a waste. This show deserves a season set, but instead we get this feeble, single disc release. There are a lot of good Cartoon Network shows that have not been released properly. Where is Dexter's Lab, Courage the Cowardly Dog, or Cow and Chicken? The only one that was given a good treatment was Powerpuff Girls. That came out as a complete series set, only after several single disc volumes and a first season set. Warner Bros. is the owner of a lot of good properties, which is lucky for them. It's unlucky for us, though, because they cannot seem to grasp the concept of giving the fans what they want. If Warner Bros. wants to be uptight about this kind of thing, I have a suggestion: Give Amazon permission to do the manufactured-on-demand DVD's, like what they've done with Rugrats and Doug. I'm sick of waiting for Warner Bros. to do the job right. It's tempting when a release like this Flapjack DVD comes out to just buy it. But instead, I know better. I'll wait for the season set, all the while knowing it probably will never come. Maybe there isn't enough demand for WB to put the time and effort into producing season sets. Fine. I understand they have a business to run. But there ARE people who would like to own such a set. So WB should let Amazon take over where they're too scared to. That way, the fans will get what they want, and Amazon and WB will make a profit. Everyone wins. But as long as WB keeps up this nonsense of single disc releases, the only one winning is them.",1259452800,293,1828,4.379411764705883

3890612,5,B002AMW108,"Ever since Flapjack aired on Cartoon Network, I have been an avid watcher.
It is one of the most creative, fun, and continuously interesting cartoons I have seen in a very long time (since Rocko's Modern Life and others from the 90s good cartoon era).

The style and artistic flair that inhabits Flapjack is absolutely great as well. It is visually pleasing and personally I think the color scheme, textured backgrounds, setting composition, character design and execution fits the nautical/pirat-y/adventure theme and haphazard adventures perfectly.

Although this is a nautical themed show, it is NOT like Spongebob. Both shows are clever, fun, and creative, but plot lines, characters, and the overall feel of the show is totally different.

All in all, I highly recommend buying this. Cartoon Network is terrible about marketing and products, so there is no guarantee that when this is gone it will come back and I'm not sure if these will be made into full seasons on dvd, but this is a good price for a volume of great works.",1255996800,2,1031,4.913793103448276

It's irreverent, it's got gross-out humor, it's got adult humor - if you're worried about your kid's delicate sensibilities try Sponge Bob.

3890616,5,B002AMW108,"The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack is simply an exceptional cartoon in today's world that is full of poor quality crap that is made for children. I've said it once, and I'll say it again, a good cartoon is one with both underlying complex themes that adults will understand and appreciate AND good quality humor and appeal for children. Flapjack is a prime example of this. In fact it fits into this model so well that this cartoon reminds me of several cartoons from the 1990's golden era such as AAAHH!!! Real Monsters, Rocko's Modern Life, and Ren and Stimpy to name a few.

The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack revolves around a young and impressionable boy named Flapjack who follows his idol, Captain K'nuckles in search of great adventures and the renounced Candied Island. Flapjack and K'nuckles themselves are hilarious and often find themselves in situations raging from the bizarre to the surreal to the uncomfortable and everything in between. Not only that, but the supporting characters are very interesting and provide excellent support throughout the episodes. Characters like the Dock Hag, Peppermint Larry, and Lady Nicklebottoms bring in extra humor and freshness to every episode.

For adults, topics such as poverty, friendship, love, self identity, and addiction (to name just a few) are underlying and hidden throughout The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack. Most kids will not recognize these topics, but will still be highly entertained by the enjoyable and sometimes simple plot that is at the surface. This though, is what makes this cartoon exceptional. Older audiences can appreciate the deeper meaning in the show's context while the younger audience can enjoy the simpler aspect of the show.

For someone that grew up during the golden era of cartoons in the 1990's, I can say that The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack is an awesome cartoon that has already demonstrated a great deal and still has tons of potential. I highly recommend it for kids, teens, and even adults. I will most certainly get this volume of episodes and all future volumes. I give The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack five stars!",1252713600,3,2149,5.134285714285714
3890617,5,B002AMW108,"Flapjack reminds me of early Ren and Stimpy or Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures.  I'm not sure if the average kid would get the humor.  The animation and plot can get a little weird, but as an adult cartoon lover, I think it's brilliant.  Probably the best cartoon out there right now.",1252713600,,285,4.4423076923076925
3890618,5,B002AMW108,"This is by far the only show on Cartoon Network right now that is worth something. Cartoon Network has really gone down the drain latley, and its nice that This show can actually entertain and Make you laugh. Its just nice Sillyness. FlapJack and Knuckles are a odd pair, but It adds to the Funnyness, I will definently be buying this, and I hope Volume 2 Comes out Sooner than Later.",1251849600,7,384,4.422535211267606
3890619,5,B002AMW108,"My boyfriend and I watch the Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack every chance I get.  We are 28 and 27 years old.  Flapjack is hilarious and always puts us in a great mood.  It's good, clean, silly fun...for the young AND the old!  The puns are chuckle-worthy and the storylines, as crazy as they may be, leave you wanting more.  If I were to compare Flapjack to any other cartoon, I would have to say it reminds me of the ever legendary Ren & Stimpy and/or Spongebob Squarepants.  Whether you're in the mood for a haircut or surgery, or in desperate need for a maple syrup fix, Flapjack is the show to watch.  I have been waiting for this DVD to come out for what seems like FOREVER.  I plan on buying it as soon as it's released.  May the spine-tickling entertainment of Flapjack live on for eternities to come!

P.S.  Remember...Everything's comatose roses.  ...  Hahahahahahaa",1248825600,20,880,4.6
