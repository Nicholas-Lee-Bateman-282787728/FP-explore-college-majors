He convinces himself that a group called the NHK (Nihon Hikkikomori Kyoukai) is out to get him and turn the entire country into NEETs. One day a pretty high school girl named Misaki visits him and offers to give him counseling to cure his hikkikomori condition. The 2 become closer and begin to rely on each other. As their relationship strengthens Satou is able to venture out and do things on his own. Lot's of drama and comedy ensue.

This anime is completely different from anything I've ever seen. It dark and methodical vibe are complemented by the main characters hilarious paranoia and perverted imagination. The production is top notch. Animation and music are all very good. It also stars 2 of my favorite voice actors, Chris Patton and Luci Christian. Given Satou's perverted imagination, this anime isn't for young viewers. But if you're older and want to laugh a lot and want to see a interesting romantic comedy then this anime will probably make you very happy.",1354924800,,1154,4.712871287128713

The characters are now dealing with real conflicts between other characters and their own personal agendas and the story leaves off on an interesting cliff hanger. With new goals put into place and the characters left in limbo, the next volume becomes required viewing for anyone who has made this far into the series.",1218672000,,450,4.433734939759036
