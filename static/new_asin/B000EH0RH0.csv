8109601,5,B000EH0RH0,"loved the quiet, relaxed approach..... Mine respond very well to this. It was nice to get the confirmation of what I have been doing with mine who were very much untamed upon arrival.",1492387200,,183,4.575757575757576
8109602,5,B000EH0RH0,"Love Bobra and this CD!  Bobra was our original llama whisperer in the late 90's.  She taught us how to teach our llamas to pack and even cross water at one of her ""how to pack"" workshops in Boulder.  Her approach is very gentle and simple.  You will be out with your llamas in no time if you follow her CD.  Miss you Bobra!",1484524800,,324,4.0
8109603,5,B000EH0RH0,The video was very helpful I would recommend it to anyone who is beginning to work with llamas.,1440806400,,95,4.333333333333333
8109604,5,B000EH0RH0,This book was recommended to me by the adoption site I am working with.  Having never kept Llamas and wanting to adopt for the first time I found this book to be exceptional.  It gave an incite to Llama's I had not seen before.  I highly recommend it to everyone to read.  I have read two times and plan on going over it again.  Thank you for sharing so much information with us.,1391644800,,379,4.136986301369863
8109605,4,B000EH0RH0,"This is a great introduction to working with llamas.  It is a bit dated as far as the videography goes, but the information is well worth it.  We hope to put much of this to practice in the near future.",1383264000,,202,4.025
8109606,4,B000EH0RH0,"I learned several useful llama handling points from this video. A couple of things that it did not have which I could really use is introducing the animal to shearing and introducing the animal to toe trimming. Both of these llama maintenance activities have to be performed regularly and untrained llamas find them very stressful. While this video introduces the beginning of desensitizing the llamas to being touched on the neck and even brushed, moving into the very intensive handling of shearing (especially in scary places like the belly and the tops of the legs), and picking up and holding a foot for toe trimming needs some additional steps to keep the llama from freaking out.

This video teaches haltering, leading, leading over obstacles, loading into a vehicle, and brushing. It seems to have been filmed in 1986. It would be interesting to know if there have been changes in handling techniques in the last 25+ years.",1370736000,,931,4.929936305732484
8109607,4,B000EH0RH0,Very well worth the $ if you have or intend to have came lids.  This video shows you how to handle and bond with llamas.  With it you get a feel for what they like and dislike and for what will work with them.  Every first time llama or alpaca owner should watch this video.  I just wish it had been longer and covered more.,1370563200,,324,3.9384615384615387
8109608,5,B000EH0RH0,"I have had a wild llama for three years that was a fight to get a hold of to do yearly shearing. She will now willingly walk on a lead with me, stand tied, and pick up her front feet. Previous years my husband and I would drag her to a post, she would lay down, and I would hand shear her. I am so glad I found this video because now we can be a team and work together to make things easier! I really think this is a good buy for new and old llama owners, it is so detailed and shows exactly how to catch and handle several ages of llamas. She does not even work with her own animals... These are llamas that have never seen her before. Its well worth the money!",1204675200,2,662,3.8394160583941606
