We both agreed the movie had a profound effect on us, but couldn't remember why. I stumbled across it on Amazon and ordered it immediately. It was a fairly unknown movie even when it was released in the 60's, so I was not expecting it to have been ""digitally remastered."" It was also coming from an import company, so I didn't expect too much by way of quality. I really just wanted to know the story, again. I was not disappointed. The movie was straight off an old VHS tape recorded to disc. I loved every minute of it. I am so glad I bought this movie; it was like discovering an old childhood toy - worn and a little frayed, but loved just the same.",1297814400,12,762,4.155405405405405
3545271,1,B001E1B6DO,Excited to see that this has been released in the US..  but disappointed by the quality. Looks like a VHS transfer.  Do yourself a favor and buy a Multi-system DVd player and order the PAL version.,1240444800,6,197,4.444444444444445

8296040,5,B001E1B6DO,I saw this when it came out in 1976 (?) and loved it.  Though slow-moving it still is a great movie!,1471305600,3,100,3.761904761904762
8296041,3,B001E1B6DO,A good friendship knows no boundaries story although I found it to be very predictable except for the ending. Well worth watching it is very family-friendly and will evoke lots of questions.,1436054400,,190,4.96875

8296043,5,B001E1B6DO,"I like the overlaying theme of ""No greater love hath man than he who layeth down his life for his friends.""  This is the type of love story, in my opinion, that more children should be a part of, and more people ought to find inspiration by the way Tsepo  (Muntu Ndebele) in real life was inspired by the part that he played.  In his adult life as a result of Apartheid, he and Norman Knox were separated and unable to continue their friendship, but the seeds of this film, nevertheless tied them together still.  The friendship of the real stars Ndebele and Knox helped these two child actors face the realities of life by means of reflections of this film.  I wonder, how many of us have a story to tell that encourages us in times that challenge us and our relationships?  That's the behind the scenes moral of this story that is not told in the film, but the film is presented in such a way that what transpired behind the scenes and after its production does not need to be told except in the lives that it reached.  Excellent film!",1409011200,3,1037,4.341968911917099

8296046,5,B001E1B6DO,I remember seeing this movie as a child.  I recently remembered the name of it and found it. I had to see it again.  It touched my heart then and again now.  A must see.,1402790400,,169,3.7714285714285714
8296047,5,B001E1B6DO,"See above. I chose this movie because I had seen it over 30 years ago. I tried to order it under the name it had on HBO and you said there was one copy left and was over one hundred dollars. Don't know why. Through Netflix, I knew it was under a different name, so I bought it.",1394755200,5,277,3.793103448275862
8296048,5,B001E1B6DO,"We watched this movie over and over as kids in Botswana. The story captures a purity of life that we had as children in Botswana... it has a feel good magical therapeutic effect that has endured over decades. It was obscured from the world stage as a movie because it emerged during the darkest years of Apartheid in South Africa even as it dared, in a way unlike any movie I know made at that time in South Africa, to address the racial divisions of both Apartheid South Africa, colonial Africa, and even touches on contradictions often found within religion between the message of God and deep rooted racist traditions. Must see movie. A movie that should be on your shelf next to the Sound of Music and passed on from generation to generation. Great for children, and adults of all ages.",1386374400,7,790,4.570422535211268
