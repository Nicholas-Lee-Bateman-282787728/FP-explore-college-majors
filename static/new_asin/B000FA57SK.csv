2556679,5,B000FA57SK,"I thought it was a great movie...  it was kind of hurried, but overall was very interesting.  I give it a thumbs up.",1198886400,,116,4.0
2556680,4,B000FA57SK,"I bought this DVD because of seeing the trailer on another Lance Henricksen film (Survival Quest).  I was quite impressed by the cinema-
tography and many of the performances, particularly Adam Taylor Gordon
and Lance Henricksen.  It seemed hokey at first, which this genre often
is, and despite the impossibility of the story, I found it to be of much
better quality than the material seemed to deserve.  By the end, I decided
I really liked it despite its flaws.  Then later, I watched it again to
try to better understand the plot and concept.  As it attempts to portray
a biblical allegory literally, it is, in my opinion, attempting an impossible task, and it is only minimally successful.  As one who is
not at all religious, I am amazed at how much I enjoyed the film.  I
recommend this for fans of thrillers and horror pictures for its suspense
and scenery, and the restraint the director used when compared to the
excesses in many of these type movies today.  I think almost anyone who
watches this will give it at least 3 stars, when they consider it was
shot in 19 days on a shoestring budget.  A pleasant surprise.",1197072000,,1126,4.59
2556681,3,B000FA57SK,"This movie was for the most part disappointing, but there were several aspects of the production that deserve praise. During the commentary, the director repeatedly points out that this movie was filmed on a low budget and in nineteen days. Considering those limitations, the movie turned out quite well. The acting was anywhere from acceptable to quite good (the guy who played the old man was especially good) and the musical score was very nicely done. The production values were also quite good. What was truly substandard was the story. There were awkward Biblical references. There was melodrama. There was heavy-handed use of symbols. There were also short cuts taken in the plot that were a little hard to ignore. I'm sure that if there had been more time to film this movie, much of the story would have been revised, but a weak story is kind of hard to overlook and so I feel generous in awarding three stars to this movie!",1182470400,,933,4.730061349693251
2556682,4,B000FA57SK,"I just watched this movie & liked it. Is like thriller/horror category more like it. Is about good & evil, Had lots suspense  & creepy parts. Got me in edge my seat most the times, Most I watched this flick because, I am fan of "" LANCE HENRIKESN"" since back in 80s. his real good actor. His rugged face and his deep amazing voice, really got me into this thriller/horror, till end.. Anyway might not to buy, but definitely check it out as rental and gives the shot on this thriller ride with Great cast & acting , check it out!!!  ""BIG B""",1166313600,5,538,4.213592233009709
2556683,3,B000FA57SK,"One has to give the filmmakers an ""A"" for effort in trying to come up with something a little original; too bad, that most of what transpires is muddled and far from credible.  Adam Taylor Gordon is very good in his role of a thirteen year old boy plagued with horrifying nightmares that result in his sometimes cutting himself.  After spending some time under a psychiatrist's care, he is released to his recovering alcoholic father (Brian Wimmer, more effective than usual) and they head home to his estranged mother's house.  An ""accident"" leads them into the home of mysterious farmer Lance Henriksen, giving one of his better recent performances.  It soon becomes apparent that kindly Lance has something evil up his sleeve, and that the boy and his father are part of it.  Sean Young pops up as the relgiously oriented schoolmarm, offering no evidence of what was once considered a star in the making.  The movie has some creepily effective moments and director (actor Don Michael Paul) makes good use of lighting and visuals for atmosphere, but by the end of the movie, it's all so contrived, you wonder what the movie's point was.  Could have been so much better.",1154390400,11,1171,4.796019900497512
2556684,3,B000FA57SK,"This isn't really a bad movie, all things considered.  The actors involved turn in decent performances, and Lance Henriksen plays his particular role extremely well. The first 2/3 of the movie work really well at building a tense, sinister atmosphere.  The real problem here lies in the details. There are a lot of little moments in the movie that demonstrate a lack of care on the behalf of the director. There is a scene where the old man says he listens to Mozart, and then promptly puts on a record that sounds absolutely nothing like Mozart.  There's a game of chess that the old man ponders over for a couple of days, and then the boy beats him in one move. And then there's the slide show/presentation that a girl does in their Bible study class that is pretty silly.  One problem that I had with the movie is that it kind of aims itself at a Christian market , but anyone with knowledge of the Bible would know how ridiculous the plot is.  The Garden of Eden, for example, is supposed to be guarded so that humans can't enter it, and it definitely isn't anywhere near Oklahoma.  And since the devil already got a human to eat from the Tree of Knowledge in the book of Genesis, it doesn't make much sense that his doing it again would achieve much. Also, I'm pretty sure the four horsemen aren't supposed to signal the beginning of the apocalypse by riding out of some guy's barn. Overall I can't help but think that this plot might have been hatched while someone was watching Dogma.",1153526400,12,1491,4.463235294117647
2556685,5,B000FA57SK,"Finally, those of us who care about Lance Henriksen's work can see him in a starring role. The film is a powerful religious allegory with deep implications for what it means to be human. If you like Lance, you really need to see this one. If you like good moral fables, you really need to see this one. Oh, what the heck...you really need to see this one.",1152835200,3,355,4.235294117647059

8119606,3,B000FA57SK,It is hard to follow some of this but the actors redeem that with their performances.  That is all I can say.,1404172800,,109,3.9545454545454546

Worth the purchase. I would recommend it, it is worth the money.",1370476800,,118,4.619047619047619
8119608,4,B000FA57SK,A real thriller. When I purchased this I wasn't sure what to expect. It is not the kind of movie I usually watch. I purchased it because it was one of Lance Henriksen's movies. I'd say anyone who likes a good thriller would enjoy this.,1355702400,,235,4.2444444444444445
8119609,5,B000FA57SK,"This movie isn't a ""thriller"" in the sense of blood and guts or keeping you on the edge of your seat in suspense.  Any one who was ever heard or read the bible and the battles of Good and evil will know how the movie will end...but that's not the point of the movie in my humble opinion.  It's my belief that the point of the movie is to show how man can easily become apathetic to those forces that move in his life and how love can move even the least of these to great acts of strengths when you are faced with that ultimate decision we all make every day of our lives--will you choose good over evil? This ultimate choice forces the secondary choice--will you act of your decision?

For me the movie was inspiraional in that no matter how difficult our lives may be, in the end and by our own free will, good will triumph over evil everytime; it all depends on our primary then secondary choice.  :)",1301443200,,903,4.202312138728324
8119610,3,B000FA57SK,"Unlike most horror movies that deal with ghosts or blood and gore, this movie is propelled by its great plot, which is biblically based, and pulls the watcher into a battle between good and evil, where they sit at the edge of their chair and pray for the best.",1285977600,,260,4.326530612244898
8119611,1,B000FA57SK,"The Garden has a great cast but it failed to deliver. The script is bad. The plot is hokey. The acting is goofy. It's way too slow. There is no action. And there isn't a single scary moment in the movie. This movie tries too hard to be like The Sixth Sense. And I didn't even enjoy The Sixth Sense. Only this movie is a laughable mess. The direction is so poor. The only redeeming factor is the cinematography. At its best it plays out like an extra long episode of Supernatural or Millennium.

A mentally disturbed son and his father have a car accident near Lance Henriksen's house. They instantaneously develop a bond with each other. The father starts working for Lance. And Lance is the new mentor for the child.
Throughout the movie the mentally disturbed child has visions that are supposed to frighten the viewer. Everything goes downhill when the child gets bullied. And then the fight between good and evil takes over. Lance turns out to be evil. And everything thereafter is unbelievable and silly.

The movie has a lot of Christian values that are imposed onto the viewer. And that takes away from the scariness of the movie. I do not recommend this movie.

Grade: D-",1279929600,3,1179,4.578199052132701
8119612,4,B000FA57SK,"THE GARDEN is an allegory w/ religious imagery. Lance Henriksen (Aliens, Near Dark, Pumpkinhead, Face The Evil, etc.) plays an old farmer named Ben Zachery. 13yo Sam (Adam Taylor Gordon) and his dad (Brian Wimmer) are stranded at Ben's farm after a terrible accident. Ben has an ancient tree in his garden that has some particularly important fruit growing on it. He spends much of his time tempting Sam's recovering alcoholic dad into drinking and chasing hot women, while secretly tormenting Sam and committing various eeevil acts. Sam soon discovers Ben's true identity and the reality behind his lies. Can he convince his dad that Ben isn't the nice guy he appears to be, or will Ben triumph in his bid to reverse biblical prophesy? THE GARDEN is a freaky thriller w/ well-handled, mystical aspects. Henriksen is exceptional in his demonic role, and the kid is believable and never becomes annoying! Watch for Sean Young (Bladerunner, Headspace) as Sam's teacher Ms. Chapman, and Claudia Christian (""Babylon 5"", The Hidden) as Sam's psychologist. Their roles are bigger that you might think!
