8530602,4,B008UQURYU,"Pray for Japan is a 2012 documentary about the country's massive tsunami in 2011.  Produced and directed by Stu Levy, it follows a handful of stories fragmented and revisited for the film's 90+ minutes.

And it's beautifully balanced.  The cinematography is soft, gorgeous, and expertly shot.  The people interviewed were chosen well and paired seamlessly alongside each other as the doc moved along.  The victims, the volunteers, the family members, and the teachers rebuilding their schools, their students...  I was instantly committed to each of their stories and remained that way until the credits.  This catastrophe was remarkable, so the devastating accounts of lost loved ones and deleted property was expected.  But there were also bits of humor scattered about here and there and I found myself smiling often.  I think that's notable and it tied in well.  These are resilient people and they are moving forward.  Cool stuff.

I think it's also worth mentioning that I watched this with my wife.  She'd moved to the States from Japan only weeks after the storm and has stayed concerned for her country's recovery and well being since.  We'd pause the movie every so often to discuss something said or seen and this was often initiated by her marveling at something I couldn't get a solid grasp on.  She'd explain, tell a story or recall some personal experience, and we'd continue watching.  This, to me, adds remarkable value to the film.  It's a legitimate effort with no agenda save hope, and that's huge.

The only criticism I have with the film is a personal problem and likely won't effect a majority of its potential customers, but I feel obligated to explain my four-star rating.  There were, and I'm ashamed to admit this, a few times during Pray for Japan when I drifted off a bit.  The film style is a delicate one and moves in relaxing waves.  The lull was a little too comfortable in spots and I'd check out for a minute or two.  And I don't want you to think me shallow, here - I don't NEED crazy peaks in my docs - but there you go.  That's why I gave the film four stars.

But it's absolutely worth your time, your money, and I thank you for your time.

8530603,5,B008UQURYU,"Pray for Japan.  I saw the film at a recent Film Festival at Paramount Studios in Los Angeles. A film maker happened to be in Japan for the Earthquake/Tsunami.  After volunteering for a few weeks, he decided to make a film.  Many people and companies donated their time and money to produce the film.  Composers,  performers, and 8 Editors donated their time.  It is in mixed Japanese and English - with appropriate subtitles in the opposite language.  The flood footage from Japan TV was excellent, and more varied than we saw stateside.  US Media got distracted by the Nuclear problems and completely missed the volunteer stories.  Rolling dissolves between Before and After were excellent.  - BUT- you need to open a new box of tissues before watching this one.  As an example - they kept coming back to a 19 year old student/ceremonial drummer who lost much of his family in the flooding.  At one point, he said: ""My 5 year old brother, my 8 year old sister, my grandfather, and my grandmother were fortunate in that they got to share a single common grave."" ""My brother won't feel lonely anymore."" The filmmaker said that the credits are longer than Pirates of the Caribbean - he didn't want to leave anyone out.  This film tells the story of the volunteers that helped out.  Some of the best were from Pakistan.  200,000+ people died in the event.  Rescue helicopters were unable to land for 3 days due to the mud and damage - and during these days - no food - no water. This film is a Must-See - it is NOT fishing for donations.  It was in theatres earlier this year - with donations from AMC and Warner Brothers who donated the digital distribution.  Remember - that is a new box of tissues EACH.  In my top 10.
