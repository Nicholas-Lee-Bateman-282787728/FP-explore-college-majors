5683305,3,B00BZYIAFW,"It is an interesting presentation, but like any other list it is subject to personal opinion as to the content and ranking.",1394928000,,123,4.636363636363637
5683306,4,B00BZYIAFW,Helpful introduction to the topic. Well-suited to those who want to know a little something about American architecture. Good visuals.,1394409600,,134,5.75
5683307,4,B00BZYIAFW,"OK, I'm sure everyone has their opinion on what is and what isn't an important building, but this historical take on the history of buildings in the US is pretty good. It is a little old, so you can have a chuckle at the 80's hair, but the background on why we have skyscrapers is worth watching on that premise alone. I believe it's a UK production, so they are a little rough in their interview process, but that also means that they dig deeper than a traditional 'fluff' piece.

Turn off the reality TV sludge and watch this instead. You might learn something.",1392854400,4,563,4.413461538461538
5683308,4,B00BZYIAFW,I found this to be an interesting look a numerous landscape changing buildings.  Even if you don't like historical architecture this show still holds interest from a skyline point of view.,1391472000,,188,5.064516129032258
5683309,4,B00BZYIAFW,"I chose this documentary because it looked interesting, and it was!  The history behind some of America's architectural greats and their impact on building trends was amazing.  I learned a lot.",1391299200,,193,5.193548387096774
5683310,5,B00BZYIAFW,"As an Architectural student living in chicago I found this little jewel of a documentary to be very nice put and informative, not to a ""in depht"" nature but to a very nice flow of basic and most relevant information. It is nice to see names i'm already familiar with and learn a bit more about them. Robert venturi and Frank gehry's interview were a nice surprise. If you're into architecture or like history buildings watch it, and if not, still watch it!",1388880000,2,456,4.506024096385542
5683311,4,B00BZYIAFW,"While not the most in-depth, or the best documentary, I found it was delightfully worth watching. I felt that the buildings they picked were very intelligently done, and they had very concise and helpful narrative.",1388707200,5,214,5.142857142857143
5683312,5,B00BZYIAFW,I was delighted to see the buildings that were chosen as they really reflect the changes in public architecture as new methods of construction became possible.,1388448000,,159,5.153846153846154
5683313,3,B00BZYIAFW,"6 minutes a building is probably too little. Want to see more of the place, get a chance to digest the info. Was like seeing Paris and nearby cities in 3 days.",1372118400,,159,4.0
5683314,5,B00BZYIAFW,"This 2013 production from Chicago's Public Television station WTTW may have played on TV but somehow I missed it. It's about architecture - and those interested the subject will want to see it - but it's not tekkie or boring, thanks to the host. Every day we go by buildings that are really descendants of new designs that took place during the 20th Century - or even earlier. In about 55 minutes the show covers 11 buildings around the country from the Virginia State Capitol (from which many other state capitol buildings derive) to Henry Ford's Highland Park, MI automobile plant (the first industrial plant building to have large windows) to - what I found most fascinating - the first enclosed shopping mall (Southdale Center in Edina, MN).  There are buildings by Louis Sullivan and Frank Lloyd Wright as well as Frank Gehry and my ""homeboy"" Robert Venturi. It's fascinating.

The DVD version adds another 33 minutes of videos touching on each of the 11 buildings on the broadcast version.)

You'll look at modern buildings a lot different after watching this show. I know I've started to do that already.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

5683319,5,B00BZYIAFW,Excellent overview of the important buildings in the US. A great primer for kids who might be interested in learning why architecture is important and interesting.,1420588800,,163,5.3076923076923075
5683320,5,B00BZYIAFW,"Fascinating.  Each example was introduced and then the architecture that was subsequently impacted was shown.  I always wondered why our government buildings seemed to be consistently of Greek influence.  In addition (and one of those things that you don't think about), the origin of the shopping mall was a revelation - not just in structure, but in concept and idealistic purpose!  I have recommended this program to others.",1419811200,2,427,5.235294117647059

5683326,4,B00BZYIAFW,Definitely worth watching for some insight into some interesting buildings and stories behind them.,1412553600,,99,6.142857142857143
5683327,3,B00BZYIAFW,"Did not go into depth about some of the buildigs. Also did not agree with their choices. For example, when The Cooper Union was opened in 1859 in New York, Mr Cooper left room for an elevator, which was not invented as of that time. Also, not knowing the future design of such a contraption, left a cylindrical shaft to allow for any shape.

Such is the choice for buildings",1412121600,,374,4.3428571428571425

5683330,4,B00BZYIAFW,"While you can argue with the selection a bit (Kimball Museum?), this was a concise, accessible, and we'll done introduction to American architecture.

8576000,2,B00BZYIAFW,"This show could have been shortened by half and still said as much. Too much fluff. I constantly felt like I was being talked down to, as if I were a third grader. I did learn that Frank Lloyd Wright was an insufferable piece of bleep. That was interesting. Otherwise, just skip it.",1433376000,,282,4.339622641509434

8576003,4,B00BZYIAFW,"Nicely done though slightly inaccurate in regards to Southdale and the Seagrams building.  They both heavily borrowed from buildings built 5-7 years before them.  Namely Northgate shopping center outside Seattle and the Equitable building in Portland.  Many of the things they credit to Southdale were actually innovated at Northgate.  Same for Seagrams, though Mies did initiate the ideas he wasn't the first to build them, though the plaza was definitely an innovation to the ideal.  Other than that very well done.  Especially enjoyed Venturi's section.",1429747200,3,556,5.482352941176471
