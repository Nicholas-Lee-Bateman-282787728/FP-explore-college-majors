8636653,5,B00HW3EUW2,"The horrific tragedy of 911 will never be forgotten.  But the story of the long tedious fight to design and build the new Freedom Tower complex is a complicated lesson.  Every person involved tries to do the right thing and comes to loggerheads at every turn.  Private citizens who lost first responders have a different view of what the complex should look like and reflect, while politicians and investors have their own ideas.  This documentary balances all the characters against each other in a thought-provoking manner.

Mayor Bloomberg, Governor Pataki and real estate mogul Larry Silverstein represent some of the public figures embattled in conflicts both personal and public, while a handful of private citizens stand boldly up to them with their own viewpoints - some of which seem to be such common sense that you might wonder what incentives are driving the others.

Pataki, Bloomberg and other public officials are stuck between doing what is politically correct and what is morally right.  Real estate developer Larry Silverstein comes across as a cold, money oriented scrooge.  These are not done by editing, but by representing the real words and conversations the director has with each.  You may find yourself wondering if the private citizens have a chance to do what they feel is right and the outcome is more than surprising.

The ongoing development of over a decade of design changes and grand-standing is stunning and the emotional impact on all is just short of overwhelming.  Director Richard Hankin does a great job moving the story along while showcasing the highlights.  This film reveals human nature at its most basic with a lot of emotional healing serving as the backbone.

The extras are excellent, including a time-lapse sequence of the construction of the plaza.  It's worth the disc alone.  DVD supplied for review.",1400803200,3,1853,5.069306930693069
