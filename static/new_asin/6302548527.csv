7827354,5,6302548527,"Five stars for A Day at the Races and At the Circus. A Night at the Opera is the reason we have A Day at the Races, and I am grateful for that. On its own, I would say A Night at the Opera is the worst of their 13 films, though it is said to be their best, by who I don't know!  Give me Monkey Business or Animal Crackers or Duck Soup! Those are Marks brothers movies! Here the talent is tepid and mostly wasted. The script takes the wrong turn after the happy dancing scene on the cruise ship and pretty much sinks the story with a series of incongruous,  flat scenes one after another. The Opera House finale definitely is well done but ultimately the ending is inconclusive and unsatisfying as a succes for a future for all but Alan Jones and his co-star Opera singer.",1493424000,,771,4.133333333333334
