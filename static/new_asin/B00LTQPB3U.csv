6506157,5,B00LTQPB3U,"Excellent cast, excellent acting and even better writing. Razor-sharp dialogue and complex constant plot twists make this for a very rewarding series of an extremely underrated and underseen show. A very adult show for the CW and it's light years away quality-wise from any other show on the network right now. Brilliant and will only increase in popularity over the years, as well, as this will look fresh for still a decade or so, since every episode is so visually stunning and beautifully shot.

Though the action and the missions are awesome, the relationships and morals of the show are amazingly strong. The character development plays a huge role, both for Nikita, Alex, and supporting characters. The plot line never gets stale, there is always a new motivation for Nikita or an unexpected turn of events. The way the fourth season finishes up is a killer--while I hate to see the show go, CW ended it right. Nikita is a show that is real; from it's treatment of issues like drug addiction and human trafficking, to the evolving relationships, to the strength of a heroine who has complex emotions and is still a total BAMF. I love Nikita and recommend it highly. This show hits deep, and it changed me forever. It's a sublime journey.",1414368000,22,1244,4.786046511627907
6506158,5,B00LTQPB3U,"Am really burning through the series fast. Great show which keeps me guessing what's next. I would have liked to see six and even seven seasons. Story picks up nicely after every episode. Maggie Kicks and then some. Good stories, great acting and really i love watching scenes where i know that particular location , whether it be Mississauga, or Toronto. Spotted City Hall, The Maryilyn Monroe Buildings . Nice to see all of these as it makes me feel i have some connection with DIVISION. Do you Copy????",1512864000,,505,4.685393258426966

6506160,1,B00LTQPB3U,"I would give this product (and especially Maggie Q) a 5-star rating except for a screw-up by the manufacturer?  packer?  shipper?  Here's the story: It's WAY too late to return this purchase ... but I want potential customers to BEWARE and to avoid my mistake of trusting that the disks in this set are all there.  The problem: I just finished Season 1-Disk 3 ... and when I looked for Disk 4, I found a second Disk 3.  To be clear: My Season 1 set has TWO Disk 3s ... but NO Disk 4.  I'm so bummed that I haven't even taken the time to check out the other seasons' disks to see if there are other screw-ups!  If anyone reading this review happens to be in a position of fixing this kind of boo-boo, I beg you to let me know how to make this mistake go away!  Otherwise, future buyers should flip through the entire set of disks immediately upon delivery to avoid my fate!",1512086400,8,872,4.179640718562874
6506161,4,B00LTQPB3U,"I like the plots and I like the action. There is an evil guy named Percy who really can portray evil.  The bad part about the show is that they are trying to show that the assassins have a human side to them and they show their life story with their suffering in their past and their present.  Ok fine, they are human.  What gets nauseating is when Nikita starts talking in her low voice and talking about feelings and family it makes me want to mute it.  It is too much.  On more than one episode I had to suffer through it and almost turned the show off.  It was so annoying.  I got the series for what I thought was a low price.  Had I paid a higher price my review would have been even lower as I would have felt ripped off. UPDATE: I upgraded from 3 stars to 4 as I went further into the series the episodes got better and Nikita not so emotional.  If she was not so emotional I would give it 5 stars.  The show finale was the best finale I ever saw.",1505347200,,955,3.9528795811518322

6506164,5,B00LTQPB3U,"I like Maggie Q on Designated Survivor so I decided to buy all the episodes from her earlier show.  I watched season 1 of Nikita when it originally aired, and remembered liking it but stopped watching after season 1 (I don't remember why).  I've been watching the blu ray since I bought it, and I'm very impressed with the show.  Maggie Q is even better than she is on Designated Survivor since she is the star of this show and is given much more to do.  All the other characters are great and I love the story lines.  I would definitely recommend the complete series of Nikita to anyone who likes Maggie Q, Designated Survivor, and/or the Jack Bauer 24 series  I'm currently halfway through season 3 and I'm not looking forward to the show ending soon. I bought the blu ray complete series for approximately $ 30, and I'm very happy I did!",1498521600,3,840,4.422077922077922
6506165,4,B00LTQPB3U,"I love the show, my complain is the language option. The description said double in spanish, french and japanese. That's not accurate. Only season 1 is double in spanish. Season 3 and 4 in french. Only Japanese language audio in all seasons, but it has spanish and french subtitles in all seasons. For that reason I took one star. I was looking foward to watch it on spanish. Other than that, you will enjoy the show.",1496534400,,417,4.5

6506167,5,B00LTQPB3U,"One of the best series I've watched in a long time if you like action, intrigue, and story plots. Characters are well written and you will want to watch a few times. This series has a lot of action there are love interests but they are secret assassins so it's a little out of the ordinary(to put it lightly). You will not be disappointed.",1494115200,,339,4.3125

6506174,5,B00LTQPB3U,"I loved this series since the first episode, Maggie Q performance in the lead role is just awesome, he displays such strength, intelligence and courage.  I loved the chemistry between Nikita and Michael.  I have seen many series and I have the tendency to compare them to Nikita, I love her, without this being the purpose of the series, she is an inspiration.",1479859200,,360,4.698412698412699

As the other reviewers have said, the action and suspense are great, but not only that, the show is so intriguing. It's character driven and emotional.

6506184,5,B00LTQPB3U,"What an awesome show this is. If you have Netflix watch it now, you will thank me for it. Outstanding acting, great scripting, stunning beauty and stunning evil. Why this wasn't better marketed is beyond me because it would be still running today. This is what people want to watch, not the garbage that mostly runs on all the networks. One can only hope that somebody will pick this up again but I don't hold my breathe.",1463616000,,421,4.48051948051948

6506193,5,B00LTQPB3U,Nikita in itself very much met my expectations as a series & the fact that I was finally able to complete the series by watching the final episodes has made me feel awesome.

I have witnessed other adults and older teens get thoroughly addicted to this show, even ones who rarely watch TV.  The stories are always intelligent and unique, and the acting is superb.

6506202,4,B00LTQPB3U,This is the sort of show that is perfect to watch on a rainy Saturday. Perfectly proportioned super spies well versed in martial arts and how to wear a slinky red dress. The bad guys are evil geniuses and the tech guys can hack into ANYWHERE within minutes. Check the realism at the door and just enjoy the ride.,1435968000,8,312,4.305084745762712
6506203,5,B00LTQPB3U,"Wonderful series! One of the best developed shows. Should never have been cancelled! As others have said, it was placed on the wrong network. I never buy TV series.

6506205,5,B00LTQPB3U,"I have no clue why this is getting a North American Box Set this Late into the End of the Series
I Love Nikita it's one of those Network Shows that did everything right
Nikita's downfall is simple the CW/WB whatever there name is now didn't understand the Property they bought and to add insult to injury They did NOT Promote it or even try to use it as there Exclusive to create a fan base
Very strange and very stupid
Season One was very good and more or less a Massive Epilog to set up Everything after Season One
Season Two & Three were simply amazing
Season Three was so deep and complex you have to watch it through a second time to fully understand what was going on (Then the light bulb in your head will pop)
If it wasn't for Nikita you would've Never got NBC's The Blacklist among other action hybrid dramas
Looking back at the tv series They did everything right Between Smart writing, Character Development, a Great Strong Cast, The production values are still to this day awesome (I have no clue what kind of Budget they had But, it's like Big Budget Action Film Quality
It's a real Shame that the network was to stupid to see Nikita as there Launching Pad to be a Legit Network for Adults (Not just teenage girls and comic book fan boys) It only lasted 4 Season
The 4th and Final Season was meant to be 6 Episodes each being 2hrs. like movies to Finish up the Series The fans didn't get that Big Surprise
It's a Truly underrated piece of tv That more people should find and fall in love with
Trust me if you don't dig the first two seasons of Nikita Then you have no taste in Entertainment why do you even have a bloody tv for that matter???
On to this Box Set This is yet another WB Massive money grab (Much like The Mentalist Complete Box Set)
Don't waste your money on this box set (You get No New Exclusives for the box set) If it had the Director's Cut of Season 4 That would make it worth wild a little but, this is Nothing more then a Shake down
You can get Nikita Season 1-4 on Blu Ray for around $15.00 or less a pop these Series is on sale through Amazon or WB.com all the time
Save your money and just build the Set piece by piece you'll save a lot of money in the long run............
The Series as a whole is a Must See go out of your way and discover it you'll be so glad you did  9.5/10
If you have to get Nikita in the BR Box Set get the Region Free Import it's Cheaper",1430956800,14,2399,4.115138592750533
6506206,5,B00LTQPB3U,"I didn't become aware of this series until I discovered it on Netflix.  Maggie Q had intrigued me on ""The Stalker,"" I did a little research and learned she had starred in this series.  It ran on the CW Network (CBS-Warner Bros.).  In any event, I began watching and was immediately hooked.  The series is brilliantly plotted and conceived, the action is nonstop, the acting, writing and production values are first-rate.  It was produced by Warner Brothers Television.  All of the actors are wonderful here, the backstory is cleverly introduced and developed, there are twists and turns and surprises galore.  Yes, the facting that everyone is conveniently able to eavesdrop on everyone else is a bit far-fetched, and some of the elaborate deceptions strain credulity to the limits, but the series has such a powerful heartbeat, and the cast works splendidly together with such intensity, that you can easily overlook that.  Each episode is a nice little gem.  This is vastly superior to the typical fare on the major networks, and merited that kind of exposure when it first ran.  Nikita, Alex, Michael, Seymour Birkhoff, and even such evildoers as Percy and Amanda -- I take my hat off to you. Mission brilliantly and memorably accomplished.",1430611200,11,1243,4.990291262135922

I started watching this series on Netflix and I'm here to tell you they've sold me on buying this series on bluray.  Haven't purchased it yet, but I noticed a few weeks ago the price was only$50 and I should've jumped on it but it's back up now so I'm gonna wait awhile.  Anyway the first few episodes in the series I didn't quite understand at first but stuck with it for another few episodes and everything started to come together and I realized I was hooked on this show!  Some nights I'd watch an episode till I could hardly hold my eyes open but the show was just so interesting that when the credits would roll nothing could stop me from starting the next episode to find out what was gonna happen next, great drama and suspense and I've never been a fan of either till I seen this show.

I will admit that Shane West's Michael took about 4 episodes to get used to. After that, this show is pure gold....every episode....all the way to the closing moments of the last episode!

You will really enjoy this show if you like action and or Nikita from earlier versions. This show is well written and the action is fantastiic. The actors are all well cast and really do a great job involving you into a complicated plot and opening it up from a point of view that sells the fact that the story actually started a while back, Maggie Q is perfect as Nikita she has big shoes to fill from previous incarnations of the character. She definitely makes the character her own and adds nice touches along the way.
