5007938,5,B006NOC1EK,"It's good to see him in another series, we used to watch ""Ballykissangel"", this of course a total departure from that! But so far we like the series, also got the original pilot DVD!",1403740800,,182,4.382352941176471
5007939,5,B006NOC1EK,"As I post this review (in June 2014) there are already three lengthy reviews of this DVD (from 2013), though this release - from BBC Home Video - is due to be released on June 17, 2014. (I received an advance screener from the distributor.). This is because Amazon has a policy of combining all formats (streaming and physical product) together. So you should always note the date of the review.

Since there are two fairly in-depth reviews here, including one by my fellow Amazon Top 50 reviewer K. Harris, I won't go into much detail - though, honestly, I always feel that long reviews of mystery series give away too much info. Mysteries are called that because the less you know the better.  But I'll let you make that judgment call.

This volume contains three crime cases which are solved by DCI Alan Banks and his partner Annie (along with his small team of two more detectives. Each case is covered in two 44 minute episodes. Note that even though the BBC name is on the package, the series was produced by the independent commercial ITV network, which is why there was plenty of room for commercials when it aired in the UK,

The series also aired in the US on some local PBS stations (more like a syndicated series) and I can't be certain if there was an edited version that was shown. (This happens with a lot of British shows that air on PBS in the US.). But I will warn you that this is probably the grittiest and most graphically violent show I've seen in a long time. Yes, the cases are fascinating and will keep you guessing (in most cases) but squeamish viewers may want to know this. Also know that the third story has nuditity and the S-word is used. (Just alerting parents here, though there is enough graphic violence that the language is comparitively mild next to that.)

The murders -each based on a novel by Peter Robinson - are central to each story. Banks (actor Stephen Tomlinson) is a serious man who lives alone and almost no time is spent on the personal lives (or background) of the recurring characters. But that's fine too. The three cases in Season One date back to 2011 and there is a Season 2 - released in the UK. So hopefully that will be released later this year.

If you like British crime dramas, I can recommend DCI Banks; just be aware that the show is more violent than many others.

The set includes two DVDS. There are 4 episodes (2 cases, with 2 episodes each) on the first disc and the remaining case on the second disc. There are no bonus features.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

5007940,4,B006NOC1EK,"I found ""DCI Banks"" to be dark, disturbing, and intense.  I bought DCI Banks rather impulsively not knowing anything about it.  I was yearning for a British crime drama to feed my appetite for them.  I have not read the Peter Robinson books this series is based upon (and perhaps that's a good thing because I had no expectations for it to live up to) and therefore I can't speak to how closely the award-winning books have been adapted. The (British) rating on the cover states: Suitable for persons of 15 years and over. Not to be supplied to any person below that age. Contains strong sex references, threat, and bloody injury.  For American television: [I'm GUESSING,] TV-14 or MA?  Unlike many American crime dramas, there is no gun-play BUT murder has many means!  I'm not sure if it's because I'm overly sensitive, but I think this program is not for the squeamish or faint of heart!  I'll try and sum up...there are less violent portrayals and autopsy gore than seems ""normal"" these days but there are many eerie and disturbing and DARK themes.

Each two-part episode was suspenseful and filled with twists and turns.  I was definitely kept guessing because the audience is kept in the dark about all the details up front and only let in bit by bit.  I LOVE this! So at the beginning, I was thinking, ""ah-ha! I know what happened!"" but then something new was revealed to make me re-think my conclusions.  For this reason, I am deliberately vague in my descriptions about the cases in this series.  There are four: Aftermath (the pilot,) Playing With Fire, Friend of the Devil, and Cold is the Grave.  As I've come to expect from the British in this genre, the acting is top-notch.  Stephen Tompkinson seems perfectly cast as Banks.  The supporting cast is brilliant as well.  I'm convinced that no one does this kind of drama better--for me--I love how the British weave these stories.  DCI Banks does not disappoint in acting, character portrayals, and plot.  It is engaging and intense.  I found it easier taking a break between episodes.  I was glad that each was a two-parter.  I also had to close my eyes a few times during each episode.  I've gotten used to that in the programs of today, which has an emphasis on graphic details.  (I'm a dinosaur, I suppose.)

***NO SPOILERS***

In the pilot, Aftermath, we are introduced to acting DCI Alan Banks of the Yorkshire Major Crimes Unit.  Banks is temporarily serving as DCI if and until someone else fills the position.  If not, then he will.  The episode opens with the ominous information that five teenage girls have gone missing over a period of some months; the community is afraid and blaming the police for not yet finding the girls and apprehending the perpetrator.  Not only is DCI Banks feeling the public's pressure, he is on the receiving end of even more by his boss, Superintendent Gerry Rydell.  If Banks wishes to obtain the position of DCI permanently it is hinted that he MUST solve the case of the missing girls!  Not a good situation for Banks at all.  But, there's more.  During a domestic disturbance call, a suspect, (the husband in said disturbance,) is beaten into a coma, perhaps by one of the two Police Constables called to the scene.  Rydell brings in DS Annie Cabot to investigate the actions of the PC; was the force to subdue the suspect, which resulted in coma, warranted?  Rydell is ""politically"" motivated to keep the public off his back, and it seemed to me, even if it means throwing the PC (and Banks) under the bus to get it done.  DS Cabbot is very young to be a DS and boasts that she deliberately chose to investigate her fellow officers to achieve that rank.  She's extremely ambitious and appears capable and willing to climb over anyone that gets in her way.  This includes not only the PC being investigated but yes, you've got it, Banks!  Cabot is perfectly suited to do Rydell's politically motivated, save-his-behind, dirty work. Cabot interferes, undermines, and uses all her ""wiles"" to get her job done.  DCI Banks is up to his neck with the missing girls' case and now with Cabot.  I found myself wondering why in the world anyone would want to do what Banks does.  I watch a lot of British crime dramas and almost every single one has a Superintendent someone-or-other just like Rydell.  Wow! Isn't the job hard enough without piling on grief from above?

In episode two, Playing With Fire: We see that after a month's ordered leave upon solving the missing girls' case, Banks is now DCI and has added DS Cabbot to his team. (Trust me, if you are anything like me, you'll be asking him: WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?) The crime scene is two burned out boats, inside one is a body and the other, derelict and abandoned has sunk to the bottom of the canal.  We know that it is arson with the intention of murder and so does Banks.  When another body floats to the surface of the canal, who the intended victim was meant to be becomes the focus of the investigation.  It only gets more complicated from there with many reasons it could have been either victim, or both, and for several different reasons!

In episode three, Friend of the Devil, Banks finds himself with two cases on his hands at the same time.  While he takes on the murder of a young woman in the center of the city, he assigns DS Cabbot as the Officer in Charge of the murder of another woman outside of town. The victim in Cabbot's case is known to Banks and inexplicably his case and Cabbot's connect.  The drama is both eerie and cold.  This one definitely made me shiver.

Episode four, Cold in the Grave is by far the toughest on Banks and therefore it was the toughest on me.  I always get involved in the main character's ""life"" and root for them in some way.  Unfortunately, it involves the daughter of Superintendent Rydell (making it SO stressful for Banks, to say the least.)  In this episode, we see a different side to Rydell and meet his beautiful wife and daughter.  It seems that Rydell has a heart after all and even, dare I say it, trusts DCI Banks to handle his ""family matter.""  I felt more than a little uneasy during several scenes of this one. Whew!

Throughout the four episodes I found myself simultaneously liking Banks and muttering advice to him about what I thought were foolish choices he continually made.  I thought a man of his age (late 40's early 50's maybe? I'm horrible at guessing age) and rank should know better!  All in all, I liked him.  That's how I prefer it.  He seemed to be the ""still waters run deep"" sort with occasional emotional outbursts!  He could go off at any minute. He is sufficiently intimidating when needed in the face of some particularly rough characters.  There were times when I rather thought that hasty retreat was the better option!  However, he stood firm, clenching his jaw with resolve.  In one episode he is threatened by a shotgun poking him in the nose!  He ultimately is a caring and dedicated man...a worthy ""good guy.""  I thought he was the kind of guy I'd want on my side.  As I kept asking myself, considering all the grief he goes through; WHY, WHY, WHY would he want his job? Banks answered me; for justice.

I'm taking a break so I can recover! Caroline Catz joins the team, and as a fan of hers (I loved her in Murder in Suburbia and Doc Martin); I'm looking forward to seeing her again in something new.  I see that this series is coming soon in the US/Canada format but if you can't wait....Amazon sells multi-regional DVD players for as low as $40!

5007941,5,B006NOC1EK,"Happen to run across this on PBS over the weekend and gosh what a great series.  I was glued to my TV all afternoon.  I watched three of the four episodes and will be buying this and season two as soon as they are available for US viewing.  The stories were interesting, acting was fantastic, great chemistry, cast was very believable. Just great acting and great murder mysteries.  I can hardly wait!!!",1384128000,21,403,4.555555555555555

5007943,5,B006NOC1EK,"This is a terrific show - currently on PBS in the US.  I am curious though about Aftermath.  They showed it on PBS and tell me that is only 1 1/2 hours and there is no part two - which they did say originally there was a Part 2.  So I would like to know how long Aftermath actually is.  After watching what they showed, it definitely seemed like it ended in the middle.  Anyone know?",1359849600,4,383,3.986842105263158
5007944,5,B006NOC1EK,"DCI Banks is a must-see British TV series for fans of police detective shows. The characters are well-written, well-acted, too. I enjoyed the backstories of the police as well as was intrigued by the crimes they were investigating. And sometimes, their crime investigations crossed over into their personal lives, which was extra interesting. I enjoyed the growth of the characters on the show, even the ones who were the criminals because even the human side was shown of some of the criminals--they had lives, loves, families, even hopes and dreams. I wish the end of the series hadn't happened on a sad note, but that's the British for you. I'm quite impressed by the format of the series, as well--each book was contained within 2 episodes, and yet there were story arcs throughout the series of the police detectives' personal and professional lives. I would probably watch the series again...it was that good.",1529452800,,915,4.9869281045751634
5007945,3,B006NOC1EK,"SPOILER ALERT.  I love this series, but where is season 6? But killing off Annie is a cheap shot and poor writing.  It says that the writers couldn't figure out anything more creative with the character. Obviously they wanted Alan to be single and they wanted to milk a dramatic moment, just as they decide to get together and she says she loves him.  I KNEW WHAT WAS COMING!

 If they wanted her out of the series, there were so many other ways of doing it. And it really ruined this season for me.",1529452800,,499,4.26595744680851

5007951,5,B006NOC1EK,"""DCI Banks"" is a well-done BBC police procedural, featuring DCI Alan Banks as the head of an investigative team in Yorkshire.  Banks as played here by Stephen Tompkinson is a good cop, blessed with a dogged persistence in his work, but sometimes all too human in his reactions to criminals and victims.  His counterpart in the series is Andrea Lowe as DS Anne Cabbot, good-looking and very ambitious, whose intriguing relationship with Banks is part of the interest of the series.  Season One presents four two-part murder mysteries, chock-full of suspects and clues.  The series is terrific for binge-watching and viewers may be challenged to solve the cases ahead of the detectives.  Highly recommended and highly addictive.",1529107200,,726,5.170940170940171
5007952,2,B006NOC1EK,"(2.5 stars)  Yes, the casting is horrendous (esp. the star -- Banks).  Seems like they didn't read the books at all.  Winsome Jackson is 6 Feet Tall!!  That right there changes the dynamics.  The short woman cast as Winsome has none of the presence that the part calls for.  Even so, I found I did enjoy the first two episodes so I revised my rating up 1.5 stars.  I'll give it another chance, but I do wish they would do a better job in casting.  Start with reading the books!  The Bosch series suffers from this as well. Actually, the Bosch character is  even more miscast than the Banks character.",1529107200,,600,4.372727272727273

5007954,3,B006NOC1EK,Good crime drama with some familiar faces from Dr Who and Father Brown. The rubber faced over acting by Stephne Thompkinson was seriously off putting though and I found myslef looking away when he was onscreen. It is not a series I would want to rewatch.,1529020800,,254,4.543478260869565
5007955,2,B006NOC1EK,"All of the characters ring somewhat true except for the one created to provide the fireworks.  Annie isn't as insightful or talented as she is arrogant and insubordinate. Her professional misconduct (with a suspect) showed a shocking lack of judgment as did the gentle indulgence of it. Madness.  Banks seemed to be that rare and admirable being, a leader so secure he wasn't afraid to add an ambitious, aggressive female to his team but during the several episodes I watched there was  nothing Annie contributed that justified the  negative impact she could have on a functioning team. Maybe she'd eventually grow on me and, like Banks, I'd find her amusing or maybe something profound would be revealed about her which explained her pushy I-know-bestness but I'm not sure I'll stick around to find out.",1529020800,3,804,4.977611940298507

5007958,5,B006NOC1EK,"Great show So refreshing to see a crime/drama series without the typical car chase,shoot out, explosions etc. that is so relevant in Hollywood t.v. and movies The characters the writing is some of the best that I've seen in years As I was watching season 3 - episode 5 (Bad Boy) it really stuck out the vast difference in the U.S. & U.K. Here in the states guns are so much a part of our society and culture and yet in the U.K. a single gun warrants an entire Police raid of a home Not bad This series along with Wallander and Jo (Swedish and French) must be added to your watchlist",1528934400,,582,4.205357142857143

5007967,2,B006NOC1EK,"what a bungling show. Starts with a vixen blond with an attitude whom Banks is immediately smitten with and apparently she with him tho she is young enough to be daughter material. The attempt at sexual tension is painful to watch. Add another woman at work and poor Banks is constantly fending himself from the henpecking women. He succumbs constantly, because...well they're women? In anything else they'd be fired for their behavior. His Annie relationship at work, his complete lack of self control, the silliness of the police, especially during surveillance when apparently no one can see them across the street or behind their car, even when the police are out in the open and have a huge camera pointed at them, their hands always on their earpieces and pulling out directly behind the surveiled's car. Oh, throw in a daughter for fun, grown up but still a baby who acts like it. Banks must have found his feminine side - he has no shame in constant crying. His wimpishness and his constant bizarre facial expression, his complete incompetence (seriously, the viewer knows the kidnapper will have the woman delivering ransom change cars and phones)..it's so bad you almost want to watch to see how much worse it can be.",1528675200,,1227,4.847619047619047
5007968,3,B006NOC1EK,"We really enjoyed DCI Banks until series 4.  There was apparently a shakeup in the writing department or possibly the producers because the quality dropped off sharply.  Plot-lines were dropped with no explanation, characters disappeared with no explanation, other characters did things that were completely imbecilic and out of character (with no explanation), often there were too many coincidences and too little logic in the investigations, and on and on.  Honestly, by the time episodes 5 & 6 (called ""Ghosts"") were over, it was all so garbled that I stopped caring who was guilty.  I'm betting this was another good thing ruined by executive decisions, as so many shows are.",1528675200,,680,5.154545454545454

I was very skeptical at the begging, I did not know what to make out of Alan, but after season one I was hooked. All of the characters in the series have a certain charisma, how can you not love Alan's dad for example. I was driven by the idea that some day this guy with sad puppy eyes was finally going to find some balance and reach happiness besides his beloved Annie. Alan is a lonely hero just like many others, with the strengths and weakness of any human being...I only which they would have made a couple more seasons, five (5) seasons were not enough, I certainty want more ...."" is about bloody time """,1528675200,,679,4.190839694656488

It's the same formula as all the BBC DCI series, with a tired old male DCI with a ruined marriage and no life outside of work, and the up and coming (in this case female) DS who is aggressive and determined to advance. The DCI commits felonies with impunity in the pursuit of justice (breaking and entering, physical assault of a suspect, etc), while the female DCS jumps into bed with the expert witness, thus placing any conviction at risk. Of course, nothing ever happens to the characters as a result of their criminal activity or severe lapses in judgement  it is all just water under the bridge in the life of a DCI/DS.

She would have been brought up on so many charges by the fourth episode and Bank's credibility, hell, career done for as the commanding officer.

DCI Banks is an idiot (really), doesn't use available technology if it might interfere with his ""intuition"" and has an unerring knack for ruining people's lives following his instincts by way of public accusations (even trials!) that subsequently reveal his lack of ability as a senior police officer. There is NO CHEMISTRY between DCI Banks and DS Cabot. The character of DI Morton is gratuitously unpleasant, but really none of the main characters are likable. DI Morton is the most nuanced and complicated, but that is erratically portrayed -- no continuity. DS Cabot is a blonde brat. The series shows no depth or complexity related to balancing her ambition and her baby, but there's just a faint whiff of tension inre the family/career tightrope in DI Morton's life and she has a husband and 4 kids!

5007986,2,B006NOC1EK,"OK, I've only watched one show (two episodes) but I don't see any reason to go any further. Two stars: it's in color and has pretty girls.
Another emotionally distraught British detective where the actor does more emoting than detecting. I'm told this is common with cops working serial killer cases but come on-, give me a break.
Another cliched side plot is the cop who's being thrown under the bus by careerist, bureaucratic higher ups. Does anybody EVER back up the cops in these shows? How many times have we seen this story before? Why would anybody want to be a British cop?
The ending comes about because,,,,,well,,,,,,the writers wrote it that way. Why be plausible when 'ya can jerk another tear or two out of it?
I may give this show another shot but there has to be more in it than the first story. I'll admit that serial killer cases are notoriously bad for detective aficionados. They invite more emotion than intellect. Perhaps ,with a different crime type, this show can improve.",1527984000,,995,4.691428571428571
5007987,5,B006NOC1EK,By far and away the best BBC detective film I have seen in awhile. The script for almost all the seasons is excellent as are the plots. The various directors did a great job. Characters are very good to excellent. I highly recommend this series for those who enjoy modern detective movies.,1527897600,,289,4.576923076923077
5007988,1,B006NOC1EK,"I started the third season with my wife, the first two are good. We're very big fans of British crime/drama unfortunately the two lead female characters Andrea Lowe portrayed as DS Cabbot and Caroline Catz portrayed as DI Hellen Morton have lost us. One, we don't think their acting is up to par with the many individuals in other shows as well as DCI Banks. It becomes the same old trope of aggressive women who want the fast track to promotion without paying their dues. Lorraine Burroughs who portrayed DS Winsome Jackman was excellent and played the part of consummate professional. Unfortunately beginning with Season 3 she disappeared which was a big disappointment. Stephen Tompkinson who plays DCI Banks is very, very good but not enough to keep uss beyond Season 3.

The plots are very good, the drama is also good but as I said above the two characters caused my wife and I to look at each other and ask, ""Do we wish to continue with this tired old premise with below par actors?"" Collective answer - NO!",1527897600,2,1014,4.633333333333334
5007989,3,B006NOC1EK,"I love British mysteries--Vera is my absolute favorite, along with Shetland. Longtime fan of Morse, Lewis, and Endeavour. DCI Banks is a real letdown after those series.
Since when is a working team happy that the boss is having an affair with one of the team members? I know it goes on all the time, but in DCI Banks, the team seems to be okay with it, even teasing the participants. I'm in the middle of season 3, and I keep saying if this situation doesn't get resolved in the next episode, I'll quit watching. I quit the Longmire series (books and TV) because of the acceptance of the affair between Longmire and his deputy. As if that's an acceptable thing in the workplace. It just makes me uncomfortable to watch it play out.
Anyway, the sloppiness of the series annoyed me too. What's with Cabot meeting key witnesses in bars and hotel rooms? I get that her character is supposed to be ambitious and bends the rules, but really?
Okay, I'm gonna give it one more chance to see how they handle the post-kiss relationship in the next episode. If they show the team all happy with the affair, I'm removing it from my watchlist.",1527897600,2,1131,4.495145631067961
5007990,5,B006NOC1EK,"Such a real detective series that you learn the officers lives, struggles, & the bonding they went through in solving homicides. I watched the entirety of the seasons available, which was thru Season Five, I think. You never like to see main characters, whom you've grown attached to, get taken out. It's a tragic thing but that's in the last one I viewed. Terrible let down. Overall, DCI Banks was a great series and has the edge to continue on, but highly unlikely. Acting wasn't so good and DCI Banks' character seemed to be off the wall with his temper, most times, as if he'd have a stroke. Overkill in his character representation. His dark haired CI agent was probably the most believable character in this entire series with her ""stick to the rules"" methods, calm and cold at times manner. This actress is very good. Highly recommend this series.",1527897600,,854,4.7

5008002,2,B006NOC1EK,"It could have been good if not for the poor acting, unrealistic dialogue, and completely inadequate character development. This show tries to be a dark and cerebral cop drama like so many others made by the Brits (Southcliffe, Happy Valley, The Fall, Endeavor, etc.) but instead is just shallow, juvenile, and pointless. If you're into smart, atmospheric dramas, then keep looking because ""DCI Banks"" definitely isn't one of them.",1527465600,2,430,5.246376811594203

5008012,2,B006NOC1EK,They try to make this detective look like a tough guy but he comes off as a clown and does things that no cop would or could do and not be fired immediately in a realistic setting. Think if Dirty Harry was a dork that everybody loathed. This is a seriously unappealing character. As well I think they are going for some kind of shock value with the blood and guts but it seems forced and unnecessary.,1527033600,3,400,4.207792207792208

When we finished, we bought the TV series. I suspect we would have enjoyed the TV series more if we had watched it before reading the books. The series is very loosely based on the book characters and generally follows some of the story lines of the books, but in general, the TV series fails to do the books justice.

5008038,5,B006NOC1EK,"For ,those of us who are Peter Robinson fans of his books festuring DCI Alan Banks, we were overjoyed to see him come to life in the ITV series. DCI Banks is the head of detectives in the Yorkshire area, and all if the cases take place in these surroundings. We see the city, the country and everything in between.

Alan Banks look like a morose character with not much personality. Stephen Tompkinsin plays Banks. Ah, no, not true., he gas a rich life sometimes. Once married, he has a grown daughter, and in some episodes she is very much present. He lives in a lovely house, and his lives arecwine and music. You may find him at night in his study with wine listening to his favorite music. His other life is his job, and he is good at it. You may be surprise to hear he with his team solves every case.

Andrea Lowe, the beautiful blonde, impetuous at times, plays DS Annie Cabot. She flits in and out if Banks life as his sometime lover. An excellent detective, but makes hasty decisions. DI Morton, played by Carolyn Catz, a lovely brunette, wears a severe haircut. Does not allow emotion into much of her life. She is often brusque with people, needs to learn social skills, and I wonder if she In on the Autism spectrum. She is brilliant and most often correct. I like her best. The Team investigates their crimes, digs up all of the facts and solves every crime. A lot of murder and mayhem, abound.

5008084,5,B006NOC1EK,"I can't say enough about this show.  I love DCI Banks and believe he is the epitome of a policeman.  He can be tough when he needs to be, but has a heart of gold.  I spent many years in law enforcement and have worked with a lot of hardnosed, yet kindly officers.  If you watch season one, you will be hooked.  DCI Banks was clearly born for that job.",1425168000,14,351,3.9571428571428573
5008085,5,B006NOC1EK,My husband and I really enjoyed DCI Banks and his team of crime solvers-he is quite a character and unlikable as a person but good as a detective-the stories are tense and twisted and have  good endings---Dante,1424476800,,210,4.675675675675675

5008096,3,B006NOC1EK,"The plot of DCI Banks would have worked better had they chosen another actor.  The actor trying to be a policeman was much better in Ballykissangel as a priest.  For some reason this actor just doesn't fit the part, altho he is good as an actor, just needs to choose better material.",1414972800,3,283,4.423076923076923

5008108,4,B006NOC1EK,DCI Banks is that chief inspector whose investigations both past and present all seem to run together at times like tendrils of smoke from a fire until he can trace them to their origin and make an arrest.  A boat fire to cover up an art theft turns into a double murder when a second burned body is found floating in the river.  That leads to an even more heinous crime.  Then his own medical examiner is falsifying her findings to cover her own crimes.  And on it goes.  The acting is excellent and the scenes of the English countryside are stunning.,1408320000,3,552,4.372549019607843

5008111,4,B006NOC1EK,"By and large, this season of adaptations from the Alan Banks novels of Peter Robinson is well done. There are three two-part stories in all, each one dark and brooding in its way, although according to my wife, who has read the books, there are some significant alterations in at least one of them. The Annie Cabbot character comes off, to me at least, as rather annoying in the first episode, and less so in the other two. Banks himself, meanwhile, shows poor judgment at times, but that does make him human, although a human who stares a lot. The landscapes, photography and acting are all first-rate, but I found the scripts a bit flawed here and there. That might be due to fitting a possibly intricate story into a couple of hours, or just poor writing -- I can't tell which. There are some loose threads here and an inexplicable now and then. As one mild example, in one episode a battered body is found in a club restroom, but loud music and dancing continue as a police underling phones in to Banks to report the incident. When the others arrive, the dancing is still going on, and there appears to have been no attempt to sequester the crowd or otherwise secure the scene. Little things like that keep one wondering on the side, but on the whole, this is an engaging trio of English mysteries that is anything but quaint.",1407801600,,1330,4.5
5008112,5,B006NOC1EK,"I LOVE it!!  I am in the process of reading the ""Inspector Banks"" series by Peter Robinson.  I have purchased season one and I find, as far as film can be faithful to novel, they have done a great job!  This is a truly interesting series.  It's not so bloody and gory, as most of Americans seem to need from ""cop shows"", but more cerebral.  The acting/actors, scenery, etc., are all incredibly good and the shows hold my interest from start to finish.  Anyone who enjoys British detective novels and shows will enjoy this series as well.  I hope more become available soon.",1407283200,4,573,4.504854368932039

8501435,3,B006NOC1EK,"This series is watchable, but cant hold a candle to other British, female led crime dramas. The lead character is underdeveloped and a bit hysterical, really. Hes wound tight and can get quite emotional, but because we know next to nothing about him, there is no context.

The show is watchable, but don't expect much character development.",1529971200,,340,4.964912280701754

8501438,5,B006NOC1EK,"I'm a fan of British mystery shows-no one can do a better job.  This show doesn't disappoint; the cast is very good, the stories are very well written, and British female cop characters are more believable than Americans, it is probably the fact that they don't look like they stop at a beauty salon before going to work and they don't wear designer clothes either.  The addition of Caroline Catz was a brilliant decision, I'm a fan of this actress and her character is the most likable of the show.  I think that the show has run its course, however, a spin-off would be a logical move.  I would love to see DCI Morton running a murder squad.",1529712000,,643,4.423728813559322
