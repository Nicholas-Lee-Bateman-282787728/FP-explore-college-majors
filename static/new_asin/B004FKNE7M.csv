8427884,4,B004FKNE7M,"Certainly Cecil B. DeMille certainly knows how to put on a big production when it comes to the movies.  Along with his writers (Harold Lamb, Waldemar Young and Dudley Nichols) DeMilles story appears to be a composite of the Crusades of the 12th century, mostly resembling the Third Crusades.

The film opens with the Saracens (Muslims) taking control of Jerusalem from the Christians.  Some were expelled, some were jailed and some were, in the most provocative scene, sold.  You just know DeMille couldn't pass up an opportunity to feature a handful of young, pretty and scantily clad white women in his film.  Here they are sold to a variety of Arabs for their harem.  So I was expecting a couple of hours of Muslim bashing.  Au contraire.  In fact, the eventual leader of the Muslims, Saladin, the Sultan of Islam (Ian Keith) is probably the most honorable leader in the film.

Most of the characters in the film seem to be historically accurate if not their deeds.  An old dude known as The Hermit (C. Aubrey Smith) travels throughout Europe in an effort to gather support to raise an army to return the Holy City and Christs tomb to the Christians.  Hes successful, beginning with Frances King Phillip II (C. Henry Gordon).  He needs to bring the new King Richard the Lionheart (Henry Wilcoxon) into the fold and the other leaders will follow.  Phillip has another plan in place to marry off his sister, Alice, to Richard.  In essence this had already been put in place by Richards late father.  Richard is a bit of a scoundrel and isn't keen on the idea.  Hes not really keen on the idea of a Crusade either as his faith is shaky.  Still, as a way to avoid or at least postpone marriage, Richard agrees to gather his army and march toward Jerusalem.

Along the way, they stop at a minor country called Navarre (a northern region of Spain).  There, King Sancho (George Barbier) refuses to give the army of the Crusades food and provisions with but a promise of compensation.  But he will if Richard will take his daughter, Berengaria (Loretta Young), off his hands and marry her.  Reluctantly Richard agrees, but sends his sword as a stand in at the wedding.  According to tradition, this is legal.  Although Berengaria has seen Richard from afar and isn't thrilled with his harsh behavior, Richard has never seen the lovely lass.  As hes leaving for the Holy City, he finally meets her and insists she come along.

The ship carrying the women contains only one princess suite and Princess Alice (Katherine DeMille, the adopted daughter of Cecil) is already there.  Shes unceremoniously thrown out when Berengaria shows up.  She is now Queen of England.  Phillip and Alice are pissed as you can imagine.  When the crusading armies show up outside the walls of the port city of Acre, they are met with resistance from Saladins united armies.  The Christians must pass Acre to get on the road to Jerusalem.  Here a great battle takes place and it is one of DeMilles best.  A combination of live action, miniatures and probably the lives of a few horses are put to the test.

In what is a silly scene, Berengaria, despondent because Richard continues to fight for what appears to be a lost cause, finds herself with an arrow in her shoulder.  Saladins forces take her prisoner and he promises to take her into his harem.  The pair actually do a bit of ancient flirting, but Berengaria really loves Richard, all of which leads to the ultimate compromise.  Berengaria stays with the Sultan and he will let Christians back into Jerusalem as long as they don't have weapons.  But Richard is banned from entering the city.  The Christians are deliriously happy but the Royal couple are distraught as you might expect.  But Saladin, gentleman that he is, returns Berengaria to Richard because their love is deep.  The Crusaders will return to their homes and those that are left will live to fight another day.

I found this film to be a lot of fun.  The stunts and fight scenes are very well staged.  The picture is big, bigger than it might have been, but this is DeMille.  I even thought the acting was very good.  Wilcoxon and Keith in particular.  Worth a look.",1486512000,,4162,4.662998624484182
8427885,5,B004FKNE7M,Big Budget spectacle.  Takes historical license but who cares its a movie.  You will see Henry Wilcoxon as a young man and a hero king.  He was much more than his last movie role of the Minister in Caddy Shack,1482710400,,209,4.175

8427887,5,B004FKNE7M,"Wonderful Cecil B. DeMille epic movie portraying the interactions of Richard the Lionheart, his new bride Berengaria and the Saracen leader Saladin, with the fate of the Holy City of Jerusalem hanging in the balance!",1471996800,,216,5.2
8427888,5,B004FKNE7M,"Although far removed from historical accuracy I have to give this movie 5 stars for its entertainment value.  Sometimes its amazing how good the cinematography & sets are on these older films.  This would have been a very good ""Crusades"" movie had they not chosen historical figures to base a great Medieval storyline around. But that's a quirk of mine I figure if you make a movie involving real historical characters it should be historically accurate, more often than not the true story is the more thrilling anyway!!!  Filled with every thing your looking for in a epic sword swinging action adventure don't let the fact that it is a older B/W movie scare you off.  It's definitely worth adding to your movie collection.  This movie also has a lot to offer for those interested in film history.",1456531200,4,798,4.753623188405797

8427891,4,B004FKNE7M,"I've seen this one a couple of times, and it's traditional Cecil B. DeMille extravagance.  If the sheer number of extras had any bearing on film quality, this'd be one of the all-time best movies ever made.  I should admit that I ""abbreviate"" the movie rather severely, hence my review title.
The story's not too complex.  Fairly spoiled Prince Richard of England would rather fight than get married, so he picks up his sword and beats a hasty retreat from his French cousin, his betrothed.  On his way to Jerusalem, the food runs out, so he bargains for beef with the king of a small European country - Richard will marry his daughter Berengeria (Loretta Young) in exchange for all the beef the king has.
The exchange is made.  Richard finally sees her and selfishly insists that she accompany the army to Jerusalem, despite the danger.  Once they arrive, he knocks heads with everybody from the Christian kings he's supposed to be fighting beside to the Saracen he's supposed to be fighting with.  The Saracen, meanwhile, is also smitten with Berengeria's beauty.
The naive Berengeria is persuaded to attempt suicide by the traitorous Duke of something.  The Saracen rescues her and whisks her away.  Richard finally cuts his way through to her and makes a deal with the Saracen.  At her insistence, the deal is for Jerusalem, not for Berengeria.  Finally, Richard has to make a sacrifice.  Finally, he grows up.  And, finally, the movie ends - happily.",1308096000,2,1455,4.818548387096774
