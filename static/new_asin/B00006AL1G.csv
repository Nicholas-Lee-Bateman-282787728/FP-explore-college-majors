(For those who don't know hip-hop consist of rap, DJ, breaking, and graffiti.) It's starts from Grand Wizard Theodore and Grandmaster DDT through to DJ Premier and Q-Bert.

1737724,4,B00006AL1G,"I would have liked to see this be more up to date, and a bit more comprehensive.  The DVD case lists DJ Krush (whom I am a fan of) as one of the DJ's featured, but it only very quickly just shows him and mentions his name which I thought was a bit cheap.  The piece on DJ Shadow was interesting. I like the different aspects the movie covers: technical, social, history, as well as a taste of some of the personalities.

1737728,5,B00006AL1G,"The guy who gave three stars has some good points. He's quite justified in his three star review. However, the way I see it, this is one of a few films (battle sounds is the only one I can think of right off the bat) that really attempts to explore the art of scratching and deliver it to a wide audience.

It's true that many DJ's were left out of Scratch, but I think the overall goal was achieved. First of all, the film is extremely well made. It is artful, has an excellent soundtrack, has a good flow to it and has some excellent interviews. There were many DJ's that weren't included partially because it is a 92 minute film that can't possibly encompass all of the influential scratch DJ's.

I respect this film immensely due to the fact that it's really opening people's eyes to what the art of scratching is all about. I mean Eddie Def is right when he talks about Burger King DJ's etc. That image of DJing as the kind of position that's easily filled by any dumbass with turntables and the ""Fresh"" sample is ridiculous. I'll admit, this film introduced me to scratching. I've been scratching for two years now and it has become my obsession. I thank this film for introducing me to the artform. Of course I can't review this film from the point of view of a veteran scratch DJ, but I can review it as a scratch DJ.

If you want to learn more about scratching, or if you already scratch, then I highly suggest this film or Battle Sounds. If for no other reason, some of the interviews (especially some that were left out of the final cut) are worth buying this movie for.",1112832000,3,1581,4.33445945945946
1737729,5,B00006AL1G,"Saw it in the theater and it damn near killed me it was so good.

Even if you're not into hiphop, this is a fun, informative, and very direct peek into the world of DJ's through the eyes of it's originators and innovators. Some amazing interview clips, especially Mix Master Mike, QBert, and DJ Shadow. Shadow's section in particular gives some well articulated notions about the nature of using other people's records (often obscure) within a DJ's set. If you don't think ""turntablism"" is a valid musical expression, you will after this movie.

The only complaints I have about this movie is its lack of female DJ's (the movie has one, and she learned from her boyfriend and works with him) even though there are thousands, and the lack of representation of DJ culture beyond hiphop (the use of DJs with Portishead and other downtempo groups). They do have a quick segment on Japanese DJ Krush who creates beautiful grooves using slow hiphop rhythms with traditional Japanese music. I would have liked to have seen more Ninja Tune artists, but that's just personal bias.

All in all, this is an amazing history of the scratch through the voices of those who lived and are living it. It's amazing that almost all of these people, like myself, had a life-changing moment when they first heard the scratching in Herbie Hancock's ""Rocket"" on the same tv performance.",1110240000,4,1363,4.791489361702127
1737730,4,B00006AL1G,"I am not a hater as the one reviewer so eloquently put it! but i think what the one reviewer who gave it only 3 stars.. feels that the early Black pioneers of that era were left out, which if not for them, this scratch DVD would not exist. but you know that's how it goes..the same happened to techno and house music, but overall the DVD is entertaining.",1106524800,2,354,4.144927536231884
1737731,4,B00006AL1G,"Picked this up for AU$10 (about US$7.80) in the bargain bin at ""Crazy Clarks"" and for that it's good value. I have to agree with other reviewers here who state that some of the more important influences were skimmed over. For example, no mention of Grandmaster Flash's ""Wheels Of Steel"" - both the man and the track being very influential and pioneering. Nowhere near enough of Kool Herc either. Also, what's with the spelling errors on screen - ""DXT""?? It is ""DST"" as in Delancey Street, there are quite a few of these careless errors which challenge the DVDs credibility somewhat.

It does seem overly biased towards the current/recent scene but perhaps that footage is just more accessible to the producer.

Not bad for 10 bucks, but I suspect that price is indicative of the fact it's not the best DVD of it's kind.",1104192000,,819,4.680555555555555
1737732,5,B00006AL1G,"I first saw this in the theater with virtually no prior knowledge about it's contents. Needless to say, I was thoroughly impressed. This DVD is a must have for anyone with even a passing interest in DJ culture. A history lesson awaits. This is an excellent product, outlining the evolution of the DJ- from the birth of the break (Kool Herc) to the modern madness of the turntablist. This is an excellent, well-constructed and very entertaining film. Even if you are not into Hip-Hop, chances are you will enjoy this documentary. If you are, I'm sure you have already seen this, if not,  BUY IT NOW! This is in my top three all-time documentaries, with 'Dogtown' and 'Freshest Kids'. This is essential viewing for all hipsters.",1063584000,12,726,4.761904761904762

1737734,4,B00006AL1G,"Very informative and interesting video with a great soundtrack. My only complaint is that I bought it for Dj Krush, seeing as how his name was on the front cover, only to find that he was in the video for about 15 seconds. No interview with him, either. I was dissapointed in the 'false advertising', but the movie was entertaining anyway.",1052352000,,339,4.573770491803279

1737765,4,B00006AL1G,"Well made... Very well made. This package is so well put together its almost too exhaustive (as if!). The main feature is superb, candidly portraying turntablists in a human light, letting them describe their obsessions with the beats and breaks in their own time. Oh the beats! As the quirky visual editing keeps pleasing the viewer so to does the soundtrack constantly throughout both dvds.
The other stuff includes wicked ""tutorials"", extra raw interviews, some of the finest looking menu's I've seen fow a while and even a sticker!
I wholeheartedly recommend esp if (like me) you loved other contemporary documentaries ie Beyond the Mat (wrestling) and Dogtown and Z-boys (skating).",1043625600,,686,5.1891891891891895
1737766,5,B00006AL1G,I've watched this documentary dozens of times.  A must for every turntablist.  Even watched it with the director's commentary.  I hope Doug Pray eventually rereleases this DVD with more footage about areas he missed like the International scene and gets more interviews with DJs like A-Trak and the Scratch Perverts.,1038787200,2,316,5.28
1737767,5,B00006AL1G,"Doug Pray has done an excellent job capturing the essence of the scratch dj movement.  Starting with the birth of the scratch and showing many of the influential figures in the development of the culture, this documentary is entertaing, as well as informative.  I can recommend this for anyone who has even the slightest interest in the genre - they will gain much insight into the oft-misunderstood hip hop/ scratch dj culture.  For a dj who is already involved and knowlegeable in the culture (such as myself), this film should provide as an entertaing photo album of sorts, not to mention.. the best tool to help your family, friends, or significant other understand what the heck you've been doing all these years! (it worked for me)  With the slight exception of a few key figures overlooked (djs- jazzy jeff, cash money, aladdin) this is quite possibly the finest hip-hop documentary ever!! also recommended - keepin' time by B+",1038182400,,934,4.8924050632911396
1737768,5,B00006AL1G,"To be honest this dvd is the most valuable one out of the whole bunch.  You won't regret it.  As far as the negative review,  don't buy into it.  I've followed most of the dj's over the year and I'm very satisfied with the way that the movie was put together.  One thing is evident...they could have gotten deeper in the whole dj culture; However, I give it 10 out of 10 because it is definitely solid.

Peace,

1737769,4,B00006AL1G,"I heard a lot of people who are actually into the culture (like me) are disappointed by the film.  Yes it omits alot of the really great DJs of the past and present, but what did you expect from a movie geared to the uninitiated?  On the commentary track, the director and producer both say ""if you want more of the history you should definitely check out WILD STYLE and...John Carluccio's BATTLESOUNDS.""  What their really saying is, ""look if you're a part of this movement, we're sorry this movie is for old people who don't get it, go back to the movies that truly represent your culture.""
I hold nothing against Doug Pray for making this movie, I think that for an outsider, he got as close as anyone could without getting the old, mostly white people completely lost.  If that had happened, the film would have never been released--period.
I was really happy to see MOST of the legends on real film (and not shotty video like all my other DJ tapes) but yes, it is still inferior to Battlesounds.
Maybe when that DVD is released (I heard it should happen soon) we can direct all who enjoyed this movie to the authentic piece.

but then i got to disc 2! theres a whole nother part with lessons on how to scratch from dj qbert and dj z-trip. also theres part of the WAVE TWISTERS movie and other dj footage. if theSCRATCH movie doesnt make you want to go out and buy turntables (and it will!) the 2nd disc of the dvd will!",1033516800,,615,4.133333333333334
1737772,4,B00006AL1G,"Very well made and entertaining documentary that fails only in it's representation of the true pioneers of the craft. Far too much time is spent on Bay Area DJ's (QBert, Shadow, etc.), and while those cats certainly deserved their propers, there is absolutely no mention of Philly legends like Cash Money, Jazzy Jeff or Spinbad. These guys were absolutely pivitol in elevating the art of scratching to new hights (I'd even go so far as to say it's tantamount to ommiting Louis Armstrong from a history of Jazz). My only other criticism is that I sometimes felt the filmmakers were a bit too ambitious with their subject matter. There are far too many angles to cover (the scratch dj, the beat digger, the producer, etc.) to cover each one succinctly within it's 90 or so minutes. I've heard that there were interviews with Cash Money and perhaps others that were left on the cutting room floor. Hopefully they show up on the DVD.",1031788800,2,929,4.705521472392638
1737773,4,B00006AL1G,"SCRATCH premiered here in Vancouver last Thursday, and I got a chance to go and view it with some friends. It is a feature-length documentary film that explores the world of the hip-hop DJ. SCRATCH showcased excellent and hidden-from-mainstream talent, had a smattering of humourous quips (mostly by Jurassic 5's Cut Chemist), alot of amazing scratch footage, and overall the documentary was quite good.
SCRATCH gave an insight into the turntablist scene that we don't get to see much in these modern days - you see someone scratching in a Gap commercial or an ad for Fanta, but you never really learn much about it. SCRATCH is a good example of a proficient and poignant view into where scratch DJing started, where it's been over the last 5 years, and a bit of insight as to where different artists see it going in the future.
The documentary was quite lighthearted - started chronologically with the advent of the first scratch - something GrandWizard Theodore came up while whiffing the record back and forth during one of his mother's lectures. From there it took you on a journey of interviews and quips from DJs discussing the full gambit of flora and fauna relating to the world of turntablism - where their inspiration comes from, attempts at annotating the art, different styles from beat juggling to faderless scratching, how and why the DJ got started, what the role of a DJ is in music today, and whether or not the turntable is actually considered an instrument. Fascinating for a newcomer to the genre of scratching and turntablism, and at the same time invigorating and refreshing for the veteran - scratch DJs worldwide will become inspired by this documentary to elevate and innovate their styles and game.
It was great to see some DJs from around the world, but I think that it was focused a little too much on the american male DJ cross section. Although I understand in a documentary you can only have so many objects of information, but there could have been a greater global influence with interviews from some of the worldwide players like Dexta from Australia, DJ Shine from Denmark, A-Trak or Jr Flo from Canada, Woody, Plus One from the UK, the list goes on. The other thing that was lacking was the focus of females in the scratching scene - although DJ Faust's girlfriend Shortee was featured, there are some extremely talented female DJs out and about that put a lot of the guys in the scene to shame.
There were a couple of other things that were obviously lacking in this documentary, namely DJ Jazzy Jeff, who invented the transform and chirp scratch, and DJ D-Styles who ranks above most of the people in this documentary. I would have also liked to see some examples of where scratching is going, and where the new branches are taking the art form, but then again you only have 90 minutes. It's too bad that they had to put in 'filler' with interviewing Q-Bert's marketing manager Yoga Frog, who simply praised Q the whole time, and Tony Prince, the hardly sober man allegedly behind the DMC Championships.
In conclusion, SCRATCH was a relatively well informed look into turntablism - the artform and the culture. Although it could have been better, I was impressed with the DJs that they did use, the message they conveyed, and most importantly the footage that they showcased. This is a ""must see"" for those of you who don't know much about scratching or turntablism, and a ""maybe see"" for those of you that do.",1029110400,4,3448,4.729235880398671
