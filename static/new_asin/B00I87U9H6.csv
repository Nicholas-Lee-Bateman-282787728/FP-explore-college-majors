6253566,3,B00I87U9H6,"We're supposed to ignore the elephant in the room? The wedding episode ""Dangerous Engagement"" was left out completely. I was very young when these episodes first came out and am trying to catch up but if you're interested in the entire series, evidently these are still not the disks to watch (although all seem to be there except that one from what I can tell). I'm giving three stars because it's very disappointing that still all the episodes don't seem to be here (especially since the excluded one was one of the best I've seen so far).",1395792000,21,541,4.587628865979381

this series is excellent and its ratings are being ruined by people who don't do their research.

6253735,4,B00I87U9H6,"The good news is that selected episodes of ITHOTN are FINALLY out on DVD. The bad news is that I was utterly disappointed when I moved in 2012 & lost all of my DVR recordings of the series. Since I switched cable carriers I had to start all over. No biggie...the series just gets better with time!
The disgusting part came when I found that after 20 years, the portrayal of a loving interracial relationship in a major prime-time series was more hated (by the people in charge of broadcasting) than it was when it was originally aired. The episodes were actually edited to remove the love scenes with Gillespie & Delong. As appalling as this sounds, I have DVR recordings from 2012 that have had the romantic content completely edited out. Then as the show's episodes were repeated into 2013 & 2014, they just conveniently did not air any of the episodes with romantic scenes of Bill & Harriet.
I don't want to sound like a conspiracy theorist, but the first thing i did when I got my copy of Season 6 was to check 'A Correct Settling' to see if the romantic content was intact & thankfully it was. I don't think the 'hater' executives realized that us In The Heat Of The Night zealots know our favorite episodes by heart.
So perhaps public editorials will embarrass them enough to publish 'Dangerous Engagement'. I think every fan that purchased Season 7 ought to receive a free copy of 'Dangerous Engagement' from the 'haters' that omitted it from the boxed set!",1401580800,16,1464,4.591603053435114
6253736,1,B00I87U9H6,"Gyped  by MGM. This is a great series but 5 episodes were left out from Season 7 including the funniest episode of the entire program ""Maybelle Returns"".  Very disappointing.",1401494400,2,174,4.9655172413793105

6253749,5,B00I87U9H6,"Based in the deep southern town of Sparta Mississippi, this series exemplifies how blacks and whites live and function together, it has a very diverse set of characters, and after several episodes, you almost feel like you know each of them.

6253753,5,B00I87U9H6,"First off, anything Carroll O'Connor is in, I know I will enjoy.  Secondly, the fine ensemble cast, heartwarming stories, and
great production values all come together to make this one of the best dramas on television.  With some comedic subplots thrown in here and there, to keep it from being too heavy, it is just the right blend of easy watching.  Very enjoyable fare.",1398556800,2,372,4.78125
6253754,2,B00I87U9H6,"I have purchased all the season's individually. I am extremely upset that  on this particular season the 5 episodes left out where by far the 5 best! And to add insult to injury, they left out the one where Bill & Harriet got married! Seriously!!! What are they thinking? Anyone that watched this show from the beginning waited to finally see them married. I wonder if & when the box set is ever released if it will be complete or not.",1398470400,2,435,4.37037037037037
6253755,4,B00I87U9H6,"Let me get this out of the way first.  Was there NO OTHER PHOTO available to put on the cover?  Mr. O'Connor looks like he has indigestion, or that he really doesn't want anyone to buy this package.  I doubt he would be happy with the photo chosen.  More problems noted later...

I am a big Carroll O'Connor fan and have been enjoying this, his second successful TV series, on DVD.  Season 7 brings about some big changes:  the Virgil Tibbs (Howard Rollins) character makes only a few appearances, and Althea and Willson Sweet are gone completely (the latter's absence is completely unexplained).  Also, due to corrupt city council manipulation, Bill Gillespie is out as police chief and Hampton Forbes (Carl Weathers) is in.  Gilliespie remains in the mix as the replacement for Newman County Sheriff McCloud, who had a heart attack.  He gets involved with Sparta Police cases much more than McCloud ever did.

Carrying over are old friends Bubba, Parker, and Lonnie Jamison, with bigger parts for lovely Crystal Fox and handsome Mark Johnson (Luann and Everett).  Dee and Peake are back too.  And of course the excellent Denise Nicholas returns as councilmember and O'Connor's love interest, Harriet DeLong.

Now we get to the problems.  The worst is that not all episodes are here.  Most of the episodes are self-contained so this is not disastrous as it would be for other shows.  But the series built up the slow burning, challenged-by-many romance between the Chief and Ms. DeLong only to OMIT THEIR WEDDING EPISODE!!!  In the last, 2-part episode featuring a psycho cult leader played by Peter Fonda, Bill and Harriet are suddenly leaving on their honeymoon!  I feel like I wasn't invited!

There are also huge disparities in picture quality, from scene to scene and shots between scenes, and as usual no special features.  Even though O'Connors Carroll and Hugh are gone, as is Mr. Rollins, even a brief mini-feature with surviving cast members would have been appreciated.  Especially since--despite half the town killing the other half with regularity--this show had a warm, relaxed feel to it.  I would have liked to have heard from Alan Autry, David Ward, and Ms. Nicholas among others.

If I could I'd give this three and a half stars, five for the show and two for the subpar presentation.",1397347200,11,2303,4.876288659793815
