4259916,5,B00443QKUI,Tis is a great dvd of the Blue Horizons show at SeaWorld Orlando and the discontinued Dolphin Discovery show at SeaWorld San Diego. It doesnt compare to actually seeing the shows but its great to watch. One of the bonus features shows how the dolphins are trained which is great for novice animal trainers.,1308182400,,306,4.685185185185185
4259917,4,B00443QKUI,"Have been waiting for the Sea World online store to open but could not beat the price and free shipping on this item. Saw the Whales and dolphins show in Sea World Orlando in 2009 and it was SO much better than the Shamu show, we should have bought this DVD while we were there but chickened out. Glad to finally add it to our collection.",1301788800,,338,4.136363636363637

8415756,5,B00443QKUI,"I recently took my 4 year old son to Sea World and he loved the Blue Horizons dolphin show. He could not get enough of it. He wanted to have and see all things dolphin and since we live out of state I decided to buy him the DVD to see if he would like it. We got home yesterday and he has already watched the show 5 times. He loves it. He fell asleep cuddling his dolphin plushies crying because I had to shut off the show so he could go to bed.

The video quality of the show is pretty good and the sound quality is great. I would highly recommend it!",1376006400,,552,3.8421052631578947
