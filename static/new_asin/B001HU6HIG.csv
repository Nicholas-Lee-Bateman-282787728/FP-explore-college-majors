He turns his nose up at the last 8 episodes as an inferior tack-on effort. He remembers his dad dropping him off at a movie theatre in Moscow where he would watch the first 10.

Our 7-year-old loves them all, and has since she was 3. One of her first Russian phrases was ""Nu Zeis, Pogodi!, usually accompanied with crazy laughing and chases.

My favorite part of these cartoon is a) the wolf's pink shirt and b) the fantastic music. There are many Russian hits from the ear, and I think Italian music, which was also popluar at the time. Sometimes they sneak in some American jazz like ""Everything Goes"". Remember, these cartoons were made in the Soviet Union!

Anyhow, we love these cartoons - which is good because my kid wants to watch them all the time. She's only recently discovered Tom & Jerry and Looney Tunes, which are also well-loved. I should mention that some of the wolf behavior is not very PC - he drinks, is usually smoking, and in general would prefer it if that sweet little bunny was actually a warm dinner.

NOTE: This version of the cartoon has the sound timing off by just a titch. For example, the wolf kicks the trash can, and after a very slight (but noticable) delay, you hear it. Our first CD I'll Get You! / Nu Pogodi! (green cover) cracked, and we got this edition because it was the only one available at the time. Get the other version instead, its soundtrack is exactly in time, and I think the menu is a little easier to operate for non-Russian speakers.",1416355200,,1618,4.40133779264214
