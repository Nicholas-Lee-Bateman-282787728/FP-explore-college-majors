2533416,5,B000ESST6U,"David McVicar's spirited, audacious 2005 Glyndebourne staging of Handel's preeminent opera seria comes to life in a surprisingly robust 2006 DVD package that spreads the marathon, four-hour work over three discs. Not nearly as outrageous as David Alden or Peter Sellars, McVicar exhibits a more manageable theatrical flair with an idiosyncratic blend of historical periods and dramatic styles from slapstick to melodrama. Bolstered by Robert Jones' impressive sets, it's a lavish production that places the classic story of Julius Caesar and Cleopatra within the context of the 18th century British imperialism encroaching upon Egypt. Above all else is G.F. Handel's wondrous music, including some of his best arias, impeccably played by the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment led by estimable Baroque specialist William Christie.

A splendid cast has been assembled starting with British mezzo-soprano Sarah Connolly who transforms herself most convincingly into a stalwart male for the title role. Performing in an especially low Baroque pitch, Connolly sings superbly while perfectly evoking the swagger of a warrior. With her stunning coloratura, she hits the expected high points without disappointment - Act I's ""Va tacito e nascosto""; Act II's casually lyrical ""Se in fiorito ameno prato"" competing with a virtuoso violin solo by Nadja Zwiener; and Act III's ""Aure, deh, per pieta"" when Caesar returns to Egypt after his escape from Tolomeo. As Cleopatra, 25-year old Australian-American soprano Danielle de Niese is a ravishing presence along the lines of Angelina Jolie. Physically ideal in a variety of eye-catching costumes, she handles the character's diverse sequence of arias with aplomb - Act II's ""V'adoro, pupille"" in the guise of a goddess prepared to entertain Caesar; the moving ""Se piet di me non senti"" later in Act II; and of course, Act III's ""Pianger la sorte mia"" as she laments her defeat by Tolomeo.

In another cross-dressing turn, German mezzo-soprano Angelika Kirchschlager makes Sesto's desires for revenge of his father's death most palpable, especially on the aria ""Svegliatevi nel core""; and Irish mezzo-soprano Patricia Bardon is moving as Sesto's grief-stricken mother Cornelia, Pompey's widow. Their characters' much-anticipated duet, ""Madre!...son nata a lagrimar"", closes Act I in beautifully rendered style. Though clearly overshadowed, the men perform exceptionally - Moroccan countertenor Rachid Ben Abdeslam as Cleopatra's servant Nireno (especially on his comic song-and-dance, ""Chi perde un momento"", complete with a Supremes-like back-up group); French countertenor Christophe Dumaux as Cleopatra's treacherous brother Tolomeo; and British baritone Christopher Maltman as Tolomeo's general, Achilla, who bravely switches sides only to meet a ghastly fate. Helping considerably in defining the various characters are Brigitte Reiffenstuel's often clever costumes, as well as the animated choreography, partially inspired by Bollywood musicals, by ""movement director"" Andrew George.

Commensurate with the stellar production, Opus Arte has provided a strong set of extras in the DVD package. On the first disc, there is a helpful synopsis that uses snapshots of the performance to explain the complex storyline. Of more interest is a half-hour featurette called ""Danielle de Niese and the Glyndebourne Experience"", which spotlights the gorgeous soprano in an informal portrait similar to MTV's ""Cribs"" series. A naturally telegenic personality, she gives a tour of her rented cottage, drives to the venue, strolls with Glyndebourne executive chairman Gus Christie and shows how she prepares for the role. On the third disc is the more substantive, one-hour documentary, ""Entertainment Is Not a Dirty Word"", directed by Ferenc van Damme, in which McVicar, Christie, Connolly, de Niese, Kirchschlager and George lend behind-the-scenes insight on the production and discuss at length the freedom allowed by this newest interpretation. There are also slideshows of the rehearsals and the final production on the third disc.",1167350400,27,4067,5.696869851729819
2533417,5,B000ESST6U,"As an opera fan, in the last 30 years I have seen hundreds of productions, of all kinds of operas, all over the world; however I can attest that this 2005 Handel's Giulio Cesare by the Glyndebourne Opera, is one of the best ever.  It is quite common to find lots of ghastly Eurotrash productions of Handel's operas, in spite, sometimes, of the great singers involved.  These ""contemporary"" approaches, using cheap jokes and absurd sceneries and costumes, are commonly found in most European theaters that are trying to ""rescue"" Handel's extensive theatrical work. For instance, David Alden's approach to Rinaldo (Munich) and Ariodante (ENO) are a sort of insult, rather than a rescue, to the greatness of Handel's music and to talented singers like David Daniels, Deborah York and Ann Murray.  It requires a real genius to stage, in a dignified and actual way, one of these operas regarded by some people as museum pieces.  Contrary to Mr. Alden, I think that David McVicar, director of this Giulio Cesare, is 100% worth of Handel's genius.  He is not alone though, in fact he is well backed by a crew of terrific singers (specially Sarah Connolly and the beautiful and amazing Danielle De Niese), by a precise orchestra (The age of enlightenment conducted by William Christie), the magical sets and dazzling costumes of Robert Jones and Brigitte Reiffenstuel and the movements on stage by Andrew George.  All these elements are perfectly balanced to make more enjoyable (almost divine) the already fantastic music of this opera.  In other productions like Alden's Rinaldo and Ariodante you have to shut your eyes to enjoy the music without the nasty burlesque interference of the stage director, by the contrary, in this Giulio Cesare you forget, at times, that the stage production was adapted to the music and no the other way around.  I highly recommend this set of 3 DVDs packed in a luxurious  case.  The extras are great too, specially the review of the plot.  When I got them I tried a ""quick"" check in my home theater, I got immediately hooked to it and, without even noticing, I went through the almost 4 hours of opera.  It is noteworthy the believable acting of the singers, which is not common in traditionally rigid baroque operas, this conveys a dynamic rhythm to the whole plot.  I never ever before, in a Handel's opera, cared too much about the plot or root at all for the characters.  In this production thogh, I really got involved with the tragedy of Cornelia and Sestus, the sometimes hilarious and sometimes passional (but always enchanting) Cleopatra and the evil maneuverings of Ptolomeo and Achilla. Quite a great, delightful and integral experience indeed.",1164153600,16,2683,4.907079646017699
2533418,5,B000ESST6U,"We bought this after reading a rave review in Opera News.  We totally agree.  It's an exciting production with marvelous singing.  I'd say it was one of the two the best opera DVD I've ever seen - but then, I'm partial to Handel.  (And if you like this one, try the Glyndebourne DVD of Handel's ""Theodora"".  It's heartbreakingly beautiful.)",1162512000,6,340,4.694915254237288
2533419,5,B000ESST6U,"All the other reviewers have raved about almost everything about this production (and with good reason).  But no one has mentioned the wonderful camerawork; so I thought I would.  Just as bad camerawork and editing can spoil an otherwise first rate production (cf Lucie de Lammermoor), the excellent visuals of this DVD add yet another layer to enhance this superb production.  There is no credit given, so I presume that it was under the control of David McVicar who conceived and directed the stage production.  This production cannot be recommended highly enough.",1162166400,7,566,5.119565217391305
2533420,4,B000ESST6U,"The performers and orchestra are superb in this production of Giulio Cesare. Sarah Connolly is the best female Caesar since Janet Baker, Danielle De Niese sings utterly beautifully as Cleopatra, and has matured into a major talent. Angelika Kirchschlager shines as Sesto, and the other roles are delivered with an almost unfaltering quality (Patricia Bardon is especially good as the tormented Cornelia). William Christie leads the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment to its usual superlative standard.

What a pity, then, that the direction undermines the performances. Handel should be performed either in a contemporary 18th Century or a modern (21st Century) setting. Here, it has been moved to the 1880's, the conquerors are the Imperial British, and the stage is peopled by characters more evocative of the Zulu War than Rome in Egypt.

Some of the performers are required to dance - particularly Danielle De Niese, and the fact that she does this so very well is to her immense credit. There is nothing wrong with this per se, just not in Handel. It seems that few lines can be delivered without an attendant gyration of some kind. Too many arms are waved, legs kicked, bottoms (no matter how attractive) waggled - just too many jigs jigged. Cleopatra's final aria (again, wonderfully delivered) is presented as a kind of Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy turn by a World War Two concert party.

I should point out that I am clearly in a minority on this matter. The audience loved every minute of it and it has had rave reviews. Perhaps I and a few others have just had a bit too much of daring innovation in modern opera productions as a whole. The mould has not so much been broken as atomised, and one sometimes longs for a good old-fashioned performance of Giulio Cesare with its quaint mix of 18th Century dress and Roman armour, delivered in the high, straight, grand style. I enjoyed the finale the most - and this was because, if you squinted a bit, you might have been mistaken that you were looking at such a production - mainly due to the fact that Caesar is at last dressed in roughly 18th Century costume. But there was still that Rorke's Drift garrison milling around at the back - as they took their bows I found myself waiting for Michael Caine...",1156550400,18,2263,4.738578680203045
2533421,5,B000ESST6U,"Having been to the production at Glyndebourne in 2005, and the revival this year I am pleased to say this is a terrific and true reproduction. Sound is wonderful in both stereo and DTS, with very effective sound staging and balance between singers and orchestra. Visually it's wonderful too, though some of the closer shots are a bit shocking if you are used to viewing from afar; it would be good if OPUS could use the DVD features that enable the viewer to choose their own preferred camera angle.  As for the Opera production and cast, then as near to perfect as I've ever experienced anywhere (including the Met, Covent Garden, Glyndebourne or Sydney) of Handel or indeed anything sub-Wagnerian. The Age of Enlightenment create a beautiful complement to first rate singing (none were bettered by this years cast - Daniels included) and the McVicar production a brilliant bridge of entertainment and emotion. Laughed and cried at almost every scene.",1155427200,11,952,4.95
2533422,5,B000ESST6U,"Great recording of this work.

Forget Sills recording! This was made before people really understood Handel and Opera Seria.

Good new vision of the work. Would have been a little nicer with more countertenors, but heck! It does have the scrumptuous Danielle de Niese.

If you're a de Niese fan, surely they must be growing? - then check out the Les Arts Florissants / William Christie DVD recording of Jean-Philippe Rameau's ""Les Indes Galantes"".",1154649600,6,447,5.013513513513513
2533423,5,B000ESST6U,"Musically, this recording of ""Giulio Cesare"" is surely the best on either CD or DVD.  Until now, my two favorites have been the New York City Opera-Beverly Sills-Norman Treigle production from 1966-67 (which I saw in person) and Rene Jacobs' 1992 recording on Harmonia Mundi.  No longer, however, does one have to sacrifice drama for completeness and original pitch.  Conductor William Christie, the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, and a superb Glyndebourne cast prove that historically informed performance can be even more exciting and absorbing than the shortened, transposed versions from the early days of the Baroque revival.  Sarah Connolly (as Caesar), Danielle de Niese (as Cleopatra), and the other singers and instrumentalists equal or exceed their predecessors in all respects.  (The horns in the opening and closing choruses will just blow you away--pun intended.)

The production portrays Caesar as a 19th century British imperialist, but the conceit is worn lightly and is generally successful.  (I can't explain the anachronistic dirigibles, destroyers, and ocean liner that appear in the harbor of Alexandria at various points.)  In the documentary that accompanies the performance, director David McVicar acknowledges that some of Cleopatra's stage action is inspired by Bollywood films, but even these scenes do not seem inappropriate.  Remember that other serious Baroque and classical operas, such as Serse and Don Giovanni, contain humorous elements.

The two protagonists could not be bettered, either vocally or dramatically.  Sarah Connolly dominates the stage, moves with a masculine swagger, and makes a most effective Caesar.  And it's no wonder that the older man falls for the beautiful, funny, flirtatious, and phenomenally talented 26-year old Danielle de Niese.  Patricia Bardon (as Cornelia, widow of Pompey) and Angelika Kirschlager (as Sesto, Pompey's son) carry the tragic element as they work to avenge the murdered king.

This DVD of ""Giulio Cesare"" joins the Handel honor roll, which includes Christie's ""Hercules,"" Christophe Rousset's ""Serse,"" and Trevor Pinnock's ""Tamerlano.""",1148688000,54,2126,5.623824451410658
2533424,5,B000ESST6U,"First performed 20 February 1724 and frequently revived thereafter during Handel's lifetime, Giulio Cesare, like all of his operas, fell into obscurity for 2 centuries. Supposedly, they were uninteresting to a modern audience and unperformable by modern performers. Recent scholarship proved the absurdity of this mistaken viewpoint. Handel's operas are joining his oratorios in the repertory with Cesare probably most performed along with Serse.

Cleopatra made a star of Beverly Sills. I think it may do the same for the uncommonly beautiful Danielle de Niese whose stunning appearance and rich soprano fill the Glyndebourne stage with that ineffable quality called 'starpower'. Glyndebourne and Opus Arte must agree because they showcase Ms. de Niece in a 30 minute documentary on disc 1 called 'Danielle de Niece and the Glyndebourne experience'! In it, appealing to the under 30 audience is explicitly discussed. Every aspect of this staging of Cesare is created with that mission in mind. Another documentary film included in the set is 'Entertainment is not a dirty word'. If you can deal with all this, you will enjoy this 3 disc DVD immensely. I found this performance funny, entertaining, inventive, a little glitzy (in a good way) and well sung. On the negative side, I found it slightly weaker dramatically but with some absorbing tragic singing from Angelika Kirschlager as Sesto and Patricia Bardon as Sesto's mother Cornelia. Sarah Connolly makes a fine Cesare. Christopher Maltman is a standout Achilla. The cast is quite good and they appear to be enjoying themselves. In a 4 hour opera that is probably helpful.

William Christie is a superb conductor of Baroque opera. He has been joining his talents to productions that emphasize a more modern sensibilty. Some purists wonder where the real heart of Baroque opera is when singers cavort onstage in slinky Flapper dresses and designer sunglasses. I can live with it if the music is well performed: as it is here by the superb Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment. But even open-minded laissez-faire opera fans (like me) would like to see a real Baroque opera performed as written one day. This is a vastly entertaining production. The costumes are beautiful. The stagecraft and sets are brilliantly conceived. There is a wonderful wave machine with 19th Century ships-of-war at the rear of a Baroque-style stage. A harvest moon with stars glimmers in the sky. It is quite lovely. And the music by Handel is pretty good, too.

This 3 DVD set is NTSC all regions shot in 16/9 true anamorphic widescreen in high definition. It looks beautiful. Sound is recorded in LPCM stereo and 5.1 DTS Digital Surround Sound. Both are crystal clear with DTS providing terrific immediacy and presence to the sound. You feel like you're there. Subtitles are in English, French, German, Spanish and Italian. Menus are in English. There are numerous extras: including the films mentioned, an illustrated plot synopsis, a cast gallery, production and rehearsal photos. The 48 page enclosed booklet is glossy, beautiful and informative. Total running time of the DVDs is 305 minutes. Another superb Opus Arte release.

This is a wonderfully entertaining modern production with a great Baroque opera at its heart. If you can deal with the anachronisms and glitz, you will love it. If you're a purist, be forewarned. Strongly recommended.

2533425,5,B000ESST6U,"This is the fourth ""Cesare"" I watched.  It is the most complete of all performances on DVD - the music lasts nearly 4 hours, an hour more than the Baker recording. Sound and picture are excellent, sounds like a good cd.

William Christie conducts the wonderful score with expertise and flexibility. No need to praise the orchestra - they are among the best.

We are in an age of countertenors, but the role of Cesare is given to an alt - Sarah Conolly. Her very good singing does not erase memories of Janet Baker, but her acting is more persuasive. All the singers are experts, and Cleopatra (Danielle de Niese) outshines them all. She leads a production of not only high artistic value, but also a great entertainment.

For this the credit must also go to he stage director McVicar and the choreographer. All in all, a first rate evening at the opera.",1146441600,49,853,4.555555555555555
2533430,5,B000ESST6U,"British mezzo Sarah Connolly gives a tour de force in the role of Caesare in this 2005 Glyndebourne production, directed by David McVicar and featuring William Christie conducting the Orchestra of the Age of the Enlightenment. McVicar's production follows the more recent trend of using modern theatrical devices to stage the work instead of the historically accurate (and sometimes frankly dull) dramatic conventions of 18th century opera seria. His approach is creating and engaging while not overwhelming the music or the drama and remaining true to the characters that are so wonderfully developed through Handel's lush score.

The star of this production is Sarah Connolly. The honeyed hue of her voice is perfectly suited to the role of Cesare, and she sings the role in a way that can only be described as absolutely alluring and utterly beautiful. She conveys, both through her voice and stage presence, a full and richly textured portrayal of her character. I can't imagine how anyone could watch this performance and not be convinced she is the foremost Cesare of our time.

The present fetish for countertenors has lead to many companies shying away from casting a woman as Cesare, and audiences are missing out because of this fad. Why cast an aging, technically inconsistent countertenor, (e.g., David Daniels, Andreas Scholl) as your Giulio Cesare when you could have someone like Sarah Connolly, or even countertenor Christophe Dumaux (more on him later), either of whom have both the voice and stage presence necessary to carry off the role. Having seen both David Daniels and Andreas Scholl in the role in past years, I have to say that Sarah Connolly's Cesare was utterly more convincing as Cesare and much more virile than either Daniels or Scholl, who come across as vocally weak and dramatically impotent, which is hardly convincing for Cesare, who is apparently strong enough to be dictator of Rome. In my mind, only Connolly's performance conveys this strength, which is essential to understanding Cesare's character in the opera.

That having been said, the other real news in this production is the outstanding performance of Christophe Dumaux as Tolomeo--a role in which he is now quite comfortable, having given  over 100 performances in the role at major houses worldwide. Unlike Daniels and Scholl, Dumaux has a strong, powerful voice that seems fully capable and secure throughout his range, both in the highest notes and the lowest. Even at the top of his register, there is a certain resonance to his voice that gives it a strong, natural sounding quality that in no way seems forced or artificial. And there is seamless integration between his lower chest voice and the upper head voice. The solid timbre of his voice comes across as almost Podle-like, but with a much more masculine quality to the voice and a more confined range. His performance as Tolomeo was captivating, and it has evolved considerably since the recording of this DVD given the number of times he has performed the role. Tolomeo is a role that can be played from a variety of angles with equal success, but the characterization he uses in this performance, as an immature, childish, sexually-frustrated tyrant, is both engaging and entertaining. While his voice lacks the beauty of Connolly's, Dumuax will undoubted make a fantastic Cesare when he decides to move on to that role.

The murdered Pompey's wife, Cornelia, and son, Sesto, are sung by Irish mezzo-soprano Patricia Bardon and Austrian mezzo-soprano Angelika Kirchschlager, respectively. Both deliver stunning and moving renditions of their arias and the pair of them lend real dramatic credibility to this production. While Danielle di Niese's flippant, dancing Cleopatra seems cartoonish compared with the rest of the portrayals in this production, the absurdity of her rendition is reigned in by the many poignant moments brought about by Bardon and Kirchschlager as they plot against Tolomeo to avenge the killing of Pompey. Christopher Maltman brings a certain Mozartian flare to his coy portrayal of Achilla, Tolomeo's general. Another young countertenor, Rachid Ben Abdeslam, also gives a solid performance in the role of Nireno.

William Christie leads the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment a perfectly executed, and at times creative, interpretation of Handel's score. Christie's tempos are flawless throughout, and although some might be a bit unsettled by his choice of tempo in places (e.g., a very slow and deliberate ""Va tacito e nacasto""), but these departures from the more conventional tempos are all well reasoned and result in an interpretation of his frequently heard score that is both thoughtful and a delight to the ear.

McVicar's choice to set the production in British colonial Egypt is a clever twist, adding an additional layer of meaning and interpretation to this opera seria.

Audio quality on this DVD is excellent with 5.1 surround sound available. Video quality is good for a DVD, but I do wish they would reissue this performance on Blu-ray as well.

I have no idea if this is true or not, but I've heard multiple rumors that his performance is soon be released on CD and as MP3. If this audio release does actually transpire, this 2005 Giulio Cesare from Glyndebourne will be the definitive recording of reference of the opera.",1352332800,5,5333,5.106651376146789

2533432,3,B000ESST6U,"I appreciate one has to be Scroogelike to carp at this spirited production, magnificently conducted by William Christie and beautifully sung by so many talented and sparkling singers. But the very excellence of the musical performance--historically correct, idiomatic, deeply versed in the style of the period and the special pathos and nobility of Handel's genius--is a standing critique of Mr. McVicar's trashy and ignorant direction, with its gross and vulgar sensationalism.
I remember Christie's beautiful semi-staged production of Charpentier's Acteon, which dramatized the sexiness of Diana's nymphs bathing in their pool by having them each stick a naked foot out from beneath her gorgeous Fortuny gown into the imaginary water. You didn't have to have the special fetish of a Pushkin to feel the frisson. So why we have to have the pawing, the sexual mounting, the playing with perversity, and the wallowing in blood is beyond me.
I do understand the impulse to choreograph so much of the action of this opera. The music invites it; the stage tradition calls for it. So why did the director and choreographer make no effort to study the performance tradition--we know a lot about the choreography of Baroque opera-ballets by now--and try at least to incorporate its spirit into their routine?
Danielle de Niese presents a special problem, of course. She is so talented, not just as a singer but also as a dancer and a comedienne--and she is so filled with irrepressible animal magnetism--that it is hard to resist every conceivable excess if you are directing her, especially since it is probably hard to make her keep her clothes on. But one should let Handel be ones guide. He understood desire, but his grave nobility gilded everything in decorum.
Yes, I heard the roar from the Glyndebourne audience, and I believe in the market. If you can make Handel sell, more power to you. But Christie made Charpentier sell with just a naked foot--and in Brooklyn. Do we really have to wallow to make this magnificent music-drama live in the 21st century?
For myself, I would rather just have a CD of this performance.",1332201600,15,2120,5.008498583569405

Reviewers concerned with the anomaly at the end must be purists who don't understand England in the war or simply can't enjoy enhuberance. The dance and movement elements throughout are brilliant.

2533435,5,B000ESST6U,"I checked this DVD out from the library a couple times, and loved it so much I just had to buy it on Amazon. While I'm familar with many of Handel's oratorios, this is the first of his operas I've heard. Thankfully, the music is every bit as beautiful and inventive as Handel's oratorios. While virtually lacking in choruses, Giulio Cesare makes up for it by a broader range of arias for most characters. Cleopatra and Caesar, for example, thus come alive as complex characters to a much further extent than (say) those in Saul. One vivdly feels their emotional highs and lows as they progress through the story.

The orchestra deliver a vibrant period-instrument style performance throughout, and all the singers are excellent as well. The production is set in relatively modern times (the Romans resembling British redcoats), and yet the iconic looks associated with Caesar and Cleopatra are fused seamlessly and powerfully into the 20th Century setting. I also found the oft-mentioned ""dance routines"" highly effective. They keep things entertaining to look at during the arias, and help accentuate the dance rhythms so common in Baroque music. Watching the DVD, it's obvious how much fun both the audiences and performers were having with this production, and that spirit translates well to the home release.

Overall, to anyone who likes Handel's oratorios, I highly recommend both ""Giulio Caesar"" in general, and this performance in particular. This was my first foray into Handel's operas, but it definitely won't be the last.",1286323200,2,1533,5.103585657370518
2533436,5,B000ESST6U,"This production of Handel's 'Giulio Cesare' was a box-office and critical triumph at the Glyndebourne Festival, as it well deserved to be. I'll get to the music later, but first let me rave about the theatrical staging It's 305 minutes of spellbinding Entertainment! It has everything: pathos and passion, wit, visual splendor, a seductive Cleopatra voluptuous enough to be plausible as the most beautiful woman in history, Vegas-worthy strutting and dancing, well choreographed swordplay, outrageous gender-nuanced camp humor, a beefcake acrobat, an onstage fiddler, and marvelous acting by all the principals. This is not the stand-and-belt stereotypical opera of the Age of Divasaurs and Pachytenors. This is Baroque opera in full crowd-rousing mode, as Handel's original 1724 production must have been, since that production was also a box-office success, revived in 1725, 1730, and 1732, and also staged in Paris, Hamburg, and Brunswick. If all of Handel's operas had been as well-attended as 'Giulio Cesare', odds are that he could have remained true to his First Love - Italian Opera - and not have been forced to compose music for pious pastiches by Charles Jennons in the barbarous English tongue.

The love affair of Caesar and Cleopatra has been transported from imperial Roman times to a setting in the British Raj, circa 1910, with the Roman legions in redcoat regimentals and the subservient locals in costumes that blend Egypt and Punjab. It's a concept that works well for me, apt historically and dramatically, considering that Handel wrote for an audience of rising Brrrritish world-conquerers. One would not have seen togas on a baroque opera stage in 1724, I hope everyone realizes. This is a modernizing production -- ""Eurotrash"" for some hide-bound conservatives-- that truly expands and enhances the 'content' of the libretto and the music.

Caesar, sung by soprano Sarah Connolly, is a foppish, starchy gentleman/officer -- a character straight from the pages of a Harry Flashman novel. He's a bit of a poof, yet calmly secure in his Sahib mastery and brave as a schoolboy on the fields of Eton. Connolly manages to look quite masculine in an epicene upper-class fashion, and she sings gloriously. The role of Caesar has the widest diversity of musical affects, from military bravura to love-torn rapture to birdsong glee. Connolly renders them all, eventually with apomb enough to make even a 'soprano' Caesar quite a dominant, heroic presence.

Ptolmey is sung by countertenor Christophe Dumaux; he's an odious, corrupt, cruel slimebag, this descendent of Alexander's general, and Dumaux makes him effectively creepy. His right-had villain, Achilla, is sung by baritone Christopher Maltman, the only non-trebel voice in the cast. Maltman is a skillful foil, musically, to all those high voices, and he acts his tough-guy role convincingly.

Cornelia, the widow of murdered Pompey the Great, is sung by alto Patricia Bardon, while her impetuous son Sextus is sung superbly and acted powerfully by soprano Angelika Kirschschlager. Their troubles at the hands of Ptolmey and Achilla form a sub plot almost as compelling as the 'hooking up' of Caesar and Cleopatra, and their duet in the first act is one of the pinnacles of Handel's composition. It's also a sterling example of stage director David McVicar's witty attention to detail; mother and son sing their poignant duet in the posture of a Michelangelo Pieta. They're so good vocally, especially Kirschschlager, that they'd steal the show if the other principals weren't equally good. Kirschschlager has the finest voice per se, the finest physical instrument, of the cast.

But the show-stealer, as the recorded enthusiasm of the audience proves, is Danielle de Niese in the role of Cleopatra. De Niese is gorgeous, as beautiful of face and form as the actress Halle Berry, whom she resembles. She also vivacious, sexy, agile; she dances and prances as well as any hoofer in a Broadway musical, and she can convey anguish, despair, or anger just as well as allure. It's an odd phenomenon, which you can see in the reviews of d Niese's Handel showcase CD, that her rapid success and/or her physical charms seem to provoke some people into ridiculous diatribes -- one-star reviews --about her vocal technique. ""She's no Beverly Sills"" they howl. Well, thank goodness! Sills completely lacked the historically-informed vocal technique to sing Handel. De Niese does not have a voice per se of the quality of Kirschschlager's, but then neither does Sarah Connolly, Both of them amply compensate by their control of their voices, that is, by their polished baroque technique. De Niese has three major virtues: She has excellent tuning, something that Kathleen Battle, for instance, never learned. She makes expressive use of her control of dynamics, something Cecilia Bartoli or Renee Fleming often fail to do. And she deeply understands baroque ornamentation, her graces, trills, and cadences are always 'integrated' into her phrasings, making musical sense of a sort that Joan Sutherland or even the sublime Janet Baker never approached. To denigrate her singing as 'technically undeveloped' is bizarre. One make think she was running for Congress against a darling of the Tea Party blatherskates.

Music? Oh yeah, this IS an opera, not just a stage spectacular. 'Giulio Cesare' is a ravishing score, still composed in the style of Handel's Roman cantatas, calling for flamboyant vocal virtuosity. I can hardly imagine a more perfect cast for it than Connolly, Kirschschlager, Bardon, and d Niese. The orchestral writing is equally flamboyant, with colorful obbligatos for flutes and natural horns. Conductor Bill Christie brings out the elegance and complexity of the score without any twitch of academicism. In fact, he lets the music and the instruments be playful. He doesn't need to be cautious; the musicians of the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment handle their 'period instruments' as skillfully as any opera orchestra of 20th C instruments in the world. And if you still cling to the troglodytic notion that Baroque instruments lack the richness or power of modern, just listen closely. You'll be disabused.

Fortunately, the sound recording is equal to the quality of the musical performance. Voices and orchestra are well in balance, equally 'present'. The camera work is also first rate, a good mix of long shots and close-ups, with good editing, nothing distracting or overdone, totally supportive of the singing and acting. This is a magnificent DVD, one of the most excellent filmings of an opera I've ever watched and heard.",1284854400,7,6620,5.222013170272813
2533437,5,B000ESST6U,"Giulio Cesare is surely one of the most beautiful operas ever composed.  Why it isn't performed as regularly as Turandot, Traviata and Carmen et.al. can be best explained by the iron cultural grip of a traditional operatic vision that sees Art and Entertainment as mutually exclusive.  (Try a quick scan of Youtube videos of earlier productions' arias. They're almost always static: a (sometimes mountainous) singer, planted centerstage, stands and gives a costume recital.)  The astounding success of Glyndebourne's fluid and kinetic production may prove the beginning of the end of that archaic concept's domination.

Handel's soaring melodies and inviting rhythms are the perfect vehicle for David McVicar's lively staging and keen sense of visual humor.  And the multi-talented (and visually jaw-dropping) Danielle De Niese is the pluperfect soprano (and dancer, actress, comedienne) to animate this lushly visual and musical performance.  It's not that all the other singers aren't aren't also stunning in their own roles (yes, all of them) but the seductive Cleopatra is the opera's dramatic and musical center, even if Caesar got the title.

The accusation of ""Bollywood"" staging carries deservedly negative freight.  Incongruous & frivolous intrusions of pop-culture song & dance routines have ruined many serious and historical Indian movies.  But McVicar (in his on-disk interview) intends to own the term rather than deny it.  Dancing, motion, and comedy fit seamlessly into Giulio Cesare with no sense of intrusion--unless you're permanently locked into the Art vs. Entertainment dichotomy.  If you browse viewer responses online (Netflix, Youtube, etc.) you'll find that while people overwhelmingly loved the Glyndebourne production.  Those that didn't often wrote reviews (nearly always targeting McVicar and De Niese in particular) that read like hate mail (Amazon reviewers seem more civilized).  Gives you an idea of how much they feel is at stake. Perhaps the exclusivity of refined connoisseurship will be lost if aficianados of Broadway are admitted into the operatic citadel.

William Christie's musical direction blends wonderfully with the stage action, and the period instruments--particularly the horns and theorbo--sound better than anything I heard in other productions with modern instruments on Youtube.  Opus Arte's DVD is worth mentioning, too.  DTS sound, fine resolution and smooth editing pull you onto the stage and into the music as if you were there.  The Wagnerian length of this masterpiece (3 full DVDs) rather than being tiresome, is one of its greatest assets.  This is the only opera DVD I own (I usually rent) and despite being a hardcore cheapskate I'm thinking of rebuying it on Blu-Ray.",1281484800,2,2733,5.497607655502392
2533438,5,B000ESST6U,"I won't add much to the accolades that are already available, but I will say that David McVicar's production repays close attention: not only is it entertaining and fun (always, I think, tastefully so), but it's clear from the performance that his rehearsal process allowed these fine singers to inhabit their roles better than many opera productions I've seen. After almost 4 hours, I found myself wanting to spend more time with these characters, to learn more about them. I rarely have that feeling after watching a Baroque opera.",1258156800,,533,5.0
2533439,5,B000ESST6U,"This is one of the most sensational opera productions available on DVD. The entire cast is very engaging in terms of their singing and acting. Sarah Connolly sings and acts admirably as Cesare, even though the real Cesare probably didn't have a contralto voice. The attractive soprano, Angelika Kirchschlager, is very convincing in her male role as Pompey's son, Sesto, who wants to revenge his father's brutal murder. Patricia Bardon, as Sesto's distraught mother, Cornella, sings several very sensitive songs. The altos or countertenors are also very convincing and add humor to their roles.

Danielle di Niese, as Cleopatra, is absolutely sensational. Clearly, she has the most outstanding arias to perform, including two Handel classics of intense sorrow, ""Se pieta di me non senti"" and ""Piangero la sorte mia."" She also sings a lively and happy aria upon learning that Cesare is still alive, ""Da tempeste il legno infranto"" which calls for a demanding series of trills and runs. De Niese doesn't miss a beat as she high steps about in a tantalizing manner. Note how she cleverly uses her hands and arms to accent the notes and trills. Clearly, she has the complete package and would have made Cleopatra both proud and envious--including an outstanding voice, charming and expressive acting ability, along with beautiful looks. Note to the Metropolitan Opera: If you want to begin attracting a larger and younger audience, sign this dynamic soprano for several productions each season and turn her loose.

Incidentally, don't miss the insightful interviews on disk three with three of the leading singers, the stage director, and conductor. The stage director provides a rather convincing argument as to why Handel would probably have approved of this production, including the choreography and the Bollywood gestures. This extra is listed under the unexpected title, ""Entertainment is not a dirty word."" We learn that the stage director and conductor were just as critical in producing this remarkable production as were the singers.

And now for a few thoughts regarding history, fact, fiction, and humor. Our knowledge of Cesare and Cleopatra comes primarily from the Greek historian Plutarch. Cleopatra's family, the Ptolemy's came from Greece and the siblings plotted against each other to see who would rule Egypt. This production integrates some facts along with a strong measure of fiction and humor. For example, Plutarch tells us that Cesare was, in fact, repulsed by the sight of the decapitated remains of his rival for power, Pompey. However, he doesn't comment on whether Cesare liked to stroll about making bird-like whistles. Even though Plutarch wasn't present, he asserts that Cleopatra was unrolled in a carpet in front of Cesare. However, it's highly unlikely that the real Cleopatra had the voice to sing a ravishing aria titled ""V'adoro, pupille"" to charm Cesare. It's also unlikely that the real Cleopatra paraded about in cabaret attire and deposited her umbrella in an urn containing Pompey's ashes. However, these moments of humor add a delightful touch to a plot that tends to be rather somber.

Finally, are there any shortcomings to this production? Very few from my point of view and they are not particularly significant in light of such an outstanding performance. In terms of set and costume design, it does seem rather odd to see warships and blimps instead Egyptian feluccas (sailboats) and Roman ships in the background. And it's rather difficult to visualize Cesare and his troops dressed in British uniforms. I confess that I fail to see the logic of transposing ancient and exotic Egypt to the period of British occupation of Egypt in the late 19th century. But unless you're a strict traditionalist, these whims shouldn't be terribly disconcerting.",1253750400,2,3792,5.1911764705882355
2533440,5,B000ESST6U,"This is a very long opera at 227 minutes but very worth the viewing effort.  The cast is brilliant, particularly the lovely Danielle De Niese, and the production directed by David Mcvicar is quite unique.  There is clever comedy, dance and drama to the excellent music on original instruments from the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment conducted by William Christie.
The BD set includes two extra documentaries which add another 78 minutes, one featuring Danielle De Niese and the other detailing the enthusiasm of the cast and director for this Handel masterpiece. These are worthwhile viewing, preferrably before commencing the opera itself.
The costuming is generally modern and somewhat quirky but the artistry is so good it is not a distraction. However some aspects such as props of pistol and rifles and background pictures of warships and blimps did seem unecessarily gimmicky.
Overall it is Handel at his best, interpreted by an inspired cast of superb singers and actors with excellent audio and video quality. This set is a must for serious opera lovers.",1252886400,,1069,5.102857142857143

Now this production is different and really outstanding. Although again the story is complicated and Kindergarten-style there is big action on stage with fighting scenes, erotic sparkling and even a quite intense half-rape scene between a bass and an alto voice (!). The singers are outstanding, Haendel for sure listened from cloud 13 and made it rain over Glyndebourne (tears). The really strange thing: after having seen the whole thing a few times its not just one singer that stands over the whole production, everyone gave his best. And the MUSIC!",1234656000,3,749,5.25
2533445,5,B000ESST6U,"This is an extraordinarily compelling production--staggeringly beautiful, meticulously stylized, and prodigiously creative.

Baroque opera is exquisitely aestheticized and extravagantly theatrical. Its road to emotional truth is thickly coded. Abstraction and excess are its very media. The staging has to take the same road. Out go naturalistic movement and direct expression. In come hyperbolic gestures and hallucinating visuals. This is the road taken here, and it matches the epoch to a tee. It captures the visual language of the Baroque without overt references to the era.

Sarah Connolly is stunning as Caesar. The charisma is palpable, the masculine charge undeniable, the grasp of power arresting. `Va tacito' offers the kind of glimpse into the choreography of power that Leni Reifenstahl would stage. Several of the other performers are equally superb in their roles, but Connolly I watched almost in disbelief--so persuasive is she.

And yet Handel is not only spectacular; he is also poignant and reflective. Giulio Cesare is a precious work of art. Although the music is exuberantly ornamented, the emotional impact is ultimately simple and direct. The meditative, soaring moments are where the director blinks at times. He piles dancing, light show, and elaborate costumes on music that needs no help from Hollywood. `V'adoro pupille' is one such instance. It is an aria that stops time--a fragile, liquid moment. As luminous as it looks in this production, I wish that McVicar had resisted the bourgeois impulse to manage it, to improve on it, to produce something out of it. I wish he had let it be. While entertainment is not a dirty word, as McVicar points out, it is not nearly as pleasurable as great art.

As a whole, this production is nonetheless remarkably effective. It tempts you to wallow in the pleasures of power--and it prompts you to catch yourself doing it.",1232064000,3,1892,5.213815789473684

2533447,2,B000ESST6U,"Giulio Cesare is not these days all that much of a rarity.  So let's start by passing over in silence those noble early productions with bass and baritone Caesars who, however talented, were pitch inappropriate, and rarely capable of the florid work.  The Caesar question then reduces to mezzo or countertenor.  I greatly prefer the latter and since there are today many countertenors who perform the role, I am always saddened when conductors cast women.  Even among female Caesars, Connolly is not really first-rate.  If you require a woman, Janet Baker's magisterial performance is still available. The real problem with any production, however, is rarely the Caesar.  The opera, after all, belongs to Cleopatra, and this is where the Glyndebourne production sinks to the bottom of the heap.  Daniele de Niese is extraordinarily attractive, and her passage work is adequate.  But Cleopatra is not primarily a sex kitten; if she were we would have not respect for Caesar's infatuation.  She is a woman of real depth, and here the test is her seduction scene with its ravishing (and fantastically difficult) ""V'adora pupille.""  De Niese here embarrasses.  She cannot begin to negotiate the leaps in the vocal line, and as a result loses any hint of legato, let alone sensuality.  I still await the perfect performance of this aria, while maintaining an idiosyncratic fondness for Valerie Masterson, Baker's Cleopatra, whose G&S origins may have helped her to be alluring even while singing softly.  In any case De Niese's version is one of the worse, and she wisely does not include it on her recent Handel disk.  Do not get me wrong.  I adore Christie, and he works his orchestral magic here as fully as elsewhere.  But we all know that the Brits love their Glyndebourne.  Beware then: this is a dreary performance, the kind that makes people hate Handel.  Those who need a performance in modern sound should go to the Minkowski cds or one of the (less luminously recorded) DVDs.  The rest of us will have to cobble together our perfect performance from bits and pieces of the many great recordings that already exist.",1213401600,23,2120,4.937853107344632

The period has been shifted forward to the late end of the 18th, beginning of the 19th century--sort of Lord Nelson in Egypt. A DVD of a live production with satisfying camera work for those who love opera in the theatre first  (unlike the Sellars Cesare, with its close-in camera and crotch  shots with no sense of the stage as stage). Use of choreographed movement during ritornellos is clever, satisfying, and musical (though not 'historical'). Musically wonderful, forward-moving, as we've come to expect of Christie. Overall MUCH better singing than in the Sellars film or the Opera Australia (Francisco Negrin) production on DVD. Perhaps in Connolly as close to a satisfying woman singing the role of Cesare as we will get. Still some sillinesses, but apparently successful silliness judging by the audience chuckles. The singing in the other Negrin production (conducted by Mortensen) is also to treasure, if you prefer this opera in fatigues and more emphasis on cruelty.",1212278400,,1090,5.1525423728813555

2533452,5,B000ESST6U,"This production of Giulio Cesare, staged for Glyndebourne, is hard to fault. McVicar did a fantastic job of generating action, movement, political commentary and humour without distracting from the singing. The sets and costumes are equally up to the task. Moreover, everything that happens on stage makes sense - it is never there 'just for pretty' or because the director got nervous about ""too many notes""...

The singers are excellent, with Sarah Connolly the standout. To my mind she is a great Giulio Cesare: not only was her singing perfect in sound nad style, but she was so persuasive as an older man of authority that at no point was it necessary to suspend disbelief!  If I had to choose one moement from this DVD - the one that has stayed with me the most - it would be the magnificent performance of 'Va tacito e nascosto'.

I found the very beautiful Danielle de Niese much more convincing in Cleopatra's extroverted arias than in the more introspective ones: there was no sign of pianissimo or piano! ""Piangero"" was just too loud (and the audience evidently agreed with me, judging from the tepid applause that greets this famous aria). But I was impressed that De Niese could manage so much dancing while singing her last aria!

""Cara speme"" was the high point of Kirschlager's role - you feel that time stops while she sings this aria.  Achille (Maltman) and Cornelia (Bardon) were also excellent - Bardon got more impressive as the opera went on. Countertenor Dumaux in the role of Tolomeo almost stole the show, and certainly stole all his scenes.

William Christie - well, he and the orchestra are just magnificent. The young woman violinist who appeared on the stage (as a young man) for a solo during an Act II scene represented the admirable musicianship, good humour and sense of theater of this orchestra in the best possible way.

The entire cast sings and acts with excellence, but I feel compelled to praise the brilliant and beautiful young American soprano Danielle de Niese, whose gorgeously costumed Cleopatra--an impudent sexy adolescent Queen of Egypt, married by Egyptian custom to her brother Ptolemy and locked with him in a violent struggle for sole possession of the throne--develops into a woman maturely in love with the Roman conqueror Julius Caesar. Sarah Connolly is totally convincing in the trouser role of Caesar (written by Handel for a castrato), and sings with true bel canto viruosity. In the orchestra pit, The Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment provides an exemplary accompaniment. The setting and costumes for the story have been updated to the 19th century: Roman soldiers are dressed as British redcoats, guns are fired, modern battleships float on the waters of the backdrop. This also is convincing; colonialism and imperialism remain much the same from the time of the Roman conquests to the time of the Suez Canal and beyond. Despite these anachronisms, Baroque music performance style is observed and the repeated sections of da capo arias are expertly embellished.

Yes, it makes an excellent audio recording to enjoy over and over, but you will also find yourself watching it over and over too, because it is such a good show.

Connolly pulls off Cesare as well or better than any man ever did.  Her coloratura is very pleasing and the voice well-balanced.  The Cleopatra sings beautifully, is gorgeous to look at, and is quite a dancer as well.  The Tolomeo is also quite light on his feet - he even does a complete flip during one scene.  It's like he's a singer-slash-gymnast.  He has a noticeable break to the voice but seems to use it almost as an advantage rather than a negative.

The singer of Sesto seems a wee bit uncomfortable with this music occasionally.  She has a fairly noticeable break to the voice on the fast bits, but her 'Cara Speme' is to die for - the audience seemed to appreciate it too.  Also the Achilla was occasionally a bit blustery and off the mark on the coloratura, but not entirely sloppy.  For the most part, he was quite acceptable.  The direction was fantastic.  I finally found an opera dvd where it appears that the director actually knew more about the opera than I did!  How refreshing.  For instance, he has the singers do some simple little dance-steps during 'Va tacito...' where it really emphasizes how Cesare and Tolomeo are squaring off for a big conflict.  And yet no singer seemed to be doing anything they were not comfortable with.

It is set in colonial Egypt under English rule, around the turn of the twentieth century.  In my mind, this setting is a great historical witticism.  Great choice.

There is plenty of humor in the direction, but rarely poor taste.  Finally, they are figuring out how to present Handel operas with both taste and entertainment-value!

8113921,5,B000ESST6U,"Viewing this version of Guilio Cesare had me watch it four times over the month since I got it.  I was impressed with every single aspect.
But I have to mention that my husband (and a classically-trained musician!) was bored to death. I explained that Handel just kept writing and writing and the people onstage had to do something during that time.

I have never seen a more exquisite rendition.  Not only the lead roles, all of which were absolutely fabulous, but certainly they were outstanding.  The one who played Cleopatra -  Danielle de  Niese - go online and look her up as well as the ones who played Cesare and Tolomeo.  As Sarah Connelly pointed out, it took her twenty-five years to become respected as a top singer ""overnight.""

I loved, loved, loved the choreography.  And each person in every single role looked to me as though you could not have chosen better.

This is a keeper.  But you have to love opera in the first place and realize how much bad staging is going on today, to hope to ""modernize"" and therefore appeal to a younger generation. I doubt whether that will do it.  What does do it is excellent acting, not just standing on a stage and singing.  This is just wonderful, but that is only my opinion.

8113925,5,B000ESST6U,"The Met's production of the past season was wonderful featuring Natalie Dessay as Cleopatra, giving a comical touch to the whole piece. Glyndebourne's on this DVD is different and far superior in many ways. Sarah Connolly's voice is divine and her performance of masculinity is uncanny. Christophe Dumaux as Ptolemy, superb in singing and acting, makes you imagine how Molire would have been performed during the 17th century. The encounter of Cesare and Ptolemy in Act I wonderfully recreates what would have been the style of acting, singing, and staging at the time. Part of the success of the Met's production comes from the fact that it modeled itself after this Glyndebourne production--even using some of the best singers (in the roles of Ptolemy, Cornelia, and Nirenus) and the same set designer (in fact, mostly the same design) and the same costume designer (although costume is based on different ideas in the Met's version). In both productions , the stylized staging--including dances and acrobatics--is something worth seeing.  This DVD version is designed in such a way that the entirety of the scene as well as details can be enjoyed. Review by Sumie Jones",1372464000,,1172,5.072538860103627

8113928,5,B000ESST6U,"This production of Handel's Giulio Cesare was recorded at Glyndebourne in 2005 and delivers a sparkling production by David McVicar and `authentic' styled performances from the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment under the knowledgeable and expert guidance of William Christie who allows himself some latitude to match the production. The cast are suitably inspired to give a memorable performance of tremendous character which resulted in rave press notices. This recorded performance fully justifies those notices to my mind.

The production is typical of David McVicar in so far as it is lively and challenging. As such it demands a flexible approach from the viewer in terms of authenticity but probably no more than Handel himself requires in terms of his portrayal of the personal relationships and historical considerations. It is probably best to approach this as an extravagant and fun entertainment based very loosely on historical considerations but translated into some fictitious modern world of no identifiable period. On those terms it is very successful. To enlarge on this:

In this production we witness a very free-wheeling Cleopatra portrayed with verve by Danielle de Niese. Apart from lively singing and acting she also delivers comes some highly entertaining and equally free-wheeling dance choreography. An equally spoiled, very dangerous and thoroughly `camp' Nireno, is played with enormous relish by Rachid Abdeslam. A straightforward example of total power is delivered by Sarah Connolly with a virtuoso vocal display coupled with a commanding stage presence that carries all before. There is a strong physical dimension to the production which can be summarised with Christopher Maltman's backward somersault which may be stretching authenticity a little far in terms of Achilla's real character. Needless to say there is the same licence taken with the stage backdrops which are inconsistent with any fixed historical period to say the least.

No more examples need be made about the type of production. To criticise it for historical inaccuracy is surely to miss the point though. In this case the point is to deliver an entertainment and certainly this is entertaining as the Glyndebourne audience clearly shows. As a matter of assurance though, free-wheeling though the production most obviously is, there is nevertheless no trace of bad taste or the type of issue that is often referred to as Eurotrash.

Musically the whole cast including the orchestra deliver faultlessly and to a uniformly high standard. The same can be said of their acting. The booklet is detailed and the disc comes with a range of extra features including an illustrated synopsis which is probably vital. There are also various image galleries and an extended 50 minute documentary which explores the notion of entertainment in the light of this opera and production.

The actual recording is excellent with crisp and detailed imaging of good colour rendition. The sound is clear and well-balanced and is presented in PCM 5.0 and stereo options. The playing length has required the use of two discs but still provides good value.

This has been a very entertaining and successful production at Glyndebourne and has received a great deal of press praise. The audience was equally enthusiastic and obviously felt truly entertained. The discs capture all of this to perfection so, as long as any purchaser is flexible enough to appreciate David McVicar's production on its own idiosyncratic terms, it is very likely that they will thoroughly enjoy the experience.

I would therefore suggest that this is a performance with both high musical and entertainment values but also one that will require some flexibility on the part of viewers. Purists may not find it to their personal taste, but there will be plenty of others who will enjoy this enormously

Thank you so much. I would never have purchased this DVD without your review, which is beyond fabulous. I had been longing to SEE this opera. (previous upload of this U.S. review)",1352592000,,4156,5.292867981790592
