8153971,3,B000K2N9DI,"Les Beasley, of the Florida Boys, joins Bill Gaither in this look back to the 60s and the TV program called the Gospel Singing Jubilee. The program features a Who's Who in Gospel Music, performing familiar and well-loved songs from another era, many of which have become classic Southern Gospel.

Artists featured include: The Florida Boys, The Blackwood Brothers, The Goodman Family, The Speer Family, The Rambos, The Downings, The Dixie Echoes, The Statesmen Quartet, and many more. Among my favorite numbers are: The King is Coming, Just Because He Lives, The Old Rugged Cross Made the Difference, The Lighthouse, and Sheltered in the Arms of God.

The video was produced in 1994 from earlier tapes produced earlier, some going back nearly 40 years. New technology would add to the quality of the taping and the sound.  This is number 6 in Volume one of the Hall of Honor Series produced by the Gaithers.  For many the nostalgic moments will make this tape special and unique. For me, personally, I enjoy the higher quality of more recent productions.",1329091200,,1054,4.904494382022472
8153972,5,B000K2N9DI,"Bill and Gloria Gaither started something wonderful with their Homecoming series.  I have many and have attended a concert.  When I found this VHS tape (DVD is so much better) I wondered why it wasn't out on DVD.  Getting to see so many oldtimers from almost 40 years ago was outstanding.  Many of them are gone now, but their music and faces from so many years ago is a great treat.  Bring on the DVD version.",1301961600,2,410,4.342105263157895
