You can buy the Wu-Tang DVD set and get this along with 4 other movies for about $15.00

You do the math..",1153699200,,159,3.9375
8271196,5,B00005KH42,"This is a great movie and the extra features are nothing short of incredible. Interviews with all the stars of the film(including Bruce Li!),and ALOT of clips. A very insightful interview with the Wu Tang Clan,and a really great music video. Look for their other newer titles like Shaolin Drunkard, Incredible Kung Fu Master,Kung Fu of 8 Drunkards and Snake Shadow Lama Fist. They are in 5.1 sound and have the same level of features.",1018137600,,434,4.8
8271197,5,B00005KH42,"I've been looking for this flick for over 10 years. People thought I was lying about it ever existing! Now the Wu has come through(peace out to the gods!!) with this all star jam! The Hidden Chambers series is the BEST DVD series out there! Too many extras to list. The extras are longer than the movie! It's got Silver Fox doing Mantis Claw style. It's directed by the Liu bros.,who did all the Master Killer films. I remember this was in the movies,but never on t.v.,so I was wondering what happened to it. The quality is good,but not excellent. It says that this film was lost and the Wu re-assembled it from different elements and such. But the whole DVD package is phat. It has interviews with Bruce Li(doing a non-Bruce Lee role and he's good!),Judy Lee,Carter Wong and Chan Hi Min,plus tons of extra clips on them,plus a private tour of the 36th chambers studios by Papa Wu!!That alone is worth the price of the tape! It's got the masters chamber,where they have real Shaolin monks giving knowledge! Get this DVD and all the Hidden Chambers. Check my other reviews!",997315200,3,1072,4.588541666666667
