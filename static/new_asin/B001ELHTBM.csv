8298693,5,B001ELHTBM,"It's so beautiful to watch, not just the scenery, the birds and animals but the LOVE and CARE that have touched our hearts and souls. Our family, especially our 2 kids love this DVD so much that we watched together again and again the whole weekend. We love the swans the most. Our 6 years-old daughter said that it's so touching to see the Father Swan who sacrified his wings/ feathers to make the bed for their wife and baby swans! The music is so lovely and wonderful to the ears as well.

This DVD is a living proof that someting ordinary like the wild life can be something extraordinary. The animals have much more love and intelligence than we think. They are truely NOBLE than many of us, the so called ""human beings"". If we have this much noble quality in us, there won't be any broken homes nor wars.",1282262400,,810,4.364238410596027
