6251014,5,B00I4F0HTW,"Before I get into the review itself, I must ask, what is so Limited about this? It's the only version I've seen that can be bought, and all it is is a couple of DVDs. Not really a complaint, but I don't know how this is a Limited Edition.

Anyways, on with the review.

Story: In the interest of keeping spoilers to a minimum, I will give almost no details of the actual story, its craziness must be experienced, not told about. The series follows high school student turned zombie Ayumu in a quest of ridiculous proportions. After being killed by a serial killer running rampant in the city, he is brought back to life by the loli-necromancer Eucliwood Hellscythe , nicknamed Eu. He decides then to find the one who killed him, but being a lone zombie he cannot do much beyond wandering around his town. He only does so at night because any exposure to sunlight will dry him up, literally. One night he meets the tsundere magical girl named Haruna. Then... Things take a turn for the wierder... In a good way. Lets just say it involves pink sparkles, blood, and chainsaws. The story here is equal parts hilarious and enthralling.

Sound: The series has a pretty decent soundtrack, nothing really memorable, but it always fits what is happening onscreen. The opening and ending sequences are however, much more memorable. With an opening that would make you think you were watching a ""serious"" anime, and an ending sequence which showcases its craziness.  As far a sub versus dub, it really is up to personal preference. The dub for the most part is quite good, however Austin Tindle as Ayumu can sometimes come off as bored when he's not supposed to be. But, when he puts energy into his lines, he does a great performance. The rest of the voice cast does a great job, and no complaints with the Japaneese version.

Visuals: It looks nice and smooth throughout the series, without any visual hiccups to speak of. There was no visible CG used, so that's a huge plus from me. The fights in this series are over the top, and can actually keep you on the edge of your seat when it wants to. Also fanservice. So, the animation overall is great.

Overall: This series is great, with an awesome sense of humor and a surprisingly good plot. This a great series that I highly recommend to people looking for something different. Now we wait for season 2 to get a release... Oh boy...",1356566400,,2375,4.5503512880562065
6251015,4,B00I4F0HTW,"Ayumu is a high school student, a zombie, and a chain saw wielding magical girl. Oh yeah, he's also a guy. He was resurrected by a necromancer after being murdered by a serial killer. Now he lives with 3 girls. The mute Necromancer who saved him, a Magical Girl, and a Vampire Ninja chick. His life is pretty crazy. Now he kills demons, goes to school, and hunts for the person that murdered him.

This anime is one of the most off-the-wall shows I've seen since Excel Saga. The story is way crazy. The production quality is great. The voice actors, animation, and soundtrack are all very well done. The characters are really cool, funny and very memorable. Is This A Zombie ? also covers a wide range of genres. It has action, comedy, drama, harem, and romance. There is a lot of fanservice and some moderately strong language, so it's not for younger viewers. I'd say 14 and up. I really enjoyed it quite a lot. I would give it 5 stars, but I don't think I can b/c it's so crazy and not serious at all. I do think that fans of shows like Rosario Vampire, Heaven's Lost Property, or Saber Marionette J will get a kick out of it.",1355529600,26,1129,4.3254716981132075
6251016,5,B00I4F0HTW,"Truthfully I love this anime I've seen seasons 1 & 2 but when I heard Funimation is doing the english voice over's I was kinda happy about it but then I watched it and omg it was really really bad it doesn't fit the character's at all I mean if your going to do a english voice over pick better actors for he part or don't touch the series at all i mean come on I guess this is why they don't do voice acting for Shakugan no Shana anymore I mean it's a Japanese anime for a reason key word Japanese I mean other anime voice over companies do a better job at voice over's just no Funimatio.
But you should buy this movie if you want it :) it's really good it has drama action comedy  everything you want just if you do don't watch it dubbed it's just bad the Japanese voices are way better yes you have to read subtitles but it's worth it. :D

Remember this is just my opinion if you like it dubbed all the power to you I just don't like it :D",1355356800,2,942,3.926701570680628
6251017,4,B00I4F0HTW,"The anime is great, no doubt about it. I saw the entire series with subtitles before. The dub is pretty good. Austin Tindle does a terrific job voicing Ayumu in his various emotional states. My main complaint is the box set. What exactly is ""limited edition"" about this? We have a box, check. We have two DVD cases, check. We have two DVDs, check. We have a sticker, check. That's it. Say what? Yes, that's it. No liner notes, no pamphlets, nothing, nada, zip. If this was a regular edition, I'd give it 5 stars. But if you're going to call it limited edition, please add something besides a box.",1355184000,3,596,4.427272727272728
6251018,5,B00I4F0HTW,"This anime is an awkward mix of action, comedy and harem. The comedic moments are hilarious, the action is intense, and the anime overall is excellent. Despite this, the anime retains a dark view on eternal and mortal life. This makes it a very funny comedy with deep undertones and great animations.

6251019,4,B00I4F0HTW,"Short version: This harem anime series is similar to other anime shows such as Rosario + Vampire, Demon King Daimao, and Nyan Koi. If you liked those series, you'll probably enjoy this one.

---------

Ayumu Aikawa was just an ordinary high school student, until one day he was murdered by a serial killer roaming his city. Fortunately for him, a necromancer named Eucliwood Hellscythe (commonly referred to as ""Yuu"" or ""Eu"") resurrects him as a zombie, which in this series means he can't die, has no more biological restrictions on using his punches (meaning he can punch much harder than regular people), and shrivels in direct sunlight. As he searches for the serial killer, he meets up with several more characters, a magical girl named Haruna (whose powers he accidentally steals, later causing him to be a magical girl as well, complete with a pink chainsaw), a vampire ninja named Seraphim, and later another vampire ninja named Tomonori/Maelstrom. He is forced to divide his time between taking care of the women and his mission, as well as attending his school and keeping his human classmates, such as his friend Orito, in the dark about the supernatural elements in his life.

Basically this is a harem anime series, where one guy lives with several women, with a lot of ecchi (hints of sexuality such as big busty boobs in revealing clothing) elements. The plot is paper thin for most of the episodes, but I found the interactions among the characters to be pretty amusing and entertaining, whether it's Ayumu getting embarassed at school, getting beat up by one of the girls for peeking at them (or them getting embarrassed because they saw him in a dream, and beating him up), or just spending some quality time at home with his friends decorating for the holidays, shopping, or just eating at the dinner table.

For all the comedy in it, there are some more serious dramatic moments, such as the face-off with the serial killer about halfway through the series, and the fight at the end with the big bad boss who's causing all the trouble in town. There is a lot of bloodshed and violence, but most of it is played for comedy, and Ayumu does get injured quite a bit, including getting sawed in half (and later blown up by a bomb), but again, because of his zombie status he simply reattaches himself later (or in the case of the bomb, his friends gather his pieces for him). Other than the megalo (demons), nobody really ever dies in this series, and most of them just walk it off.",1338336000,11,2497,4.69406392694064
6251020,5,B00I4F0HTW,My favorite anime by far. I would give anything for a third season. We logged into Amazon 10 minutes into the first episode of season one to buy season two.,1476230400,,156,4.233333333333333

6251023,5,B00I4F0HTW,Great series to add to the collection. Good action and comedy.,1471564800,,62,4.7272727272727275
6251024,4,B00I4F0HTW,"This blu-ray/DVD set contains the first 12-episode season of Is This a Zombie?, a comedy adventure series with a little harem action because, well, it's anime. The main character has been killed before the series even begins and exists as a zombie who is averse to sunlight but has amazing regenerative ability. When he encounters a ""magical garment girl"", he accidentally steals her powers and gains the ability to become a chainsaw-wielding magical garment zombie boy dressed in a frilly pink outfit. This is how the series starts, and things get crazier from there.

I was very pleasantly surprised by this series. The madcap fan-service heavy antics in the few few episodes made me wonder what I'd gotten myself into at first, but by the halfway mark of the season I was fully invested in the characters and their story. A major reason for this is the excellent English dub. The characters all have unique voices and the westernization of the dialogue made things easy to follow for fledgling otakus like myself. The animation is above average, with a few powerfully dramatic scenes given extra gravitas via the artwork. Yes, I said powerfully dramatic scenes. As funny as the series is, there is a dramatic undercurrent that runs throughout and is especially strong halfway through the first season, making me realize how much I really cared about the characters in the series.

But sadly, like several other anime series I've seen, Is This a Zombie? doesn't know when to say when. After a dramatically weighty midsection, the show just keeps introducing characters, most of whom come and go without contributing to the progression of the story, and things start to get a bit tiresome. The season's big finale then happens in the 11th episode, leaving the 12th episode to stand alone as a lighthearted parody of Japan's pop idol scene, which felt oddly tacked on after the denouement of the prior episode.

Still, Is This a Zombie? is worth watching as a fun yet emotionally engaging series with a little blood and a little skin scattered throughout the jokes.",1467849600,,2065,4.911174785100287

Only negative i have is that the box art features one of main heroines as apose to the male lead which kinda makes me hesitate on whether or not to display it since seems people create a judgemt before watching it.
The product itself is great, a very minimalistic packaging around the product. The 4 discs were nicely organized witg blu rays and dvd separated.

6251062,5,B00I4F0HTW,"Funny Funny Funny!! XD heres my review on this series!

Characters and Plot: (minor spoilers only) This series follows Ayumu Aikawa, a boy who recently died but came back to life as a zombie. Unlike The Walking Dead series, zombies in this series don't eat brains or go around biteing people turning them into zombies. Ayumu alonge with his Resurrection-er Eucliwood Hellscythe, Ayumu has crazy wild adventures as he survives high school, and with the magic in this series he is in for one hell of time of pain and humiliation, but mostly Humiliation!

Pros: The story is really well written, the jokes are plenty, there is some dirty pervertedness in the series but its all for laughs and like 99% of animes the guy is beaten up over a misunderstanding but its too funny to be mad at the girls for doing it because Ayumu deserves it even if he doesnt, get my drift? ;)

Pros 2: The reason this is the Limited Edition is because the DVD's come in a super stylish pink  and hard cardboard box which looks very nice and cool!

Cons: if you are NOT a fan of perverted jokes then I would say NOT watch this series because its filled with them.

Over all: its super funny! Buy this series!!",1413244800,2,1185,4.462962962962963

She and he live together and a magical garment girl shows up named Haruna who  accidentally cuts him in half when they first meet.

But unlike the normal brain eaters he actually acts like he normally does, except for the fact he can not stay out in direct sunlight for too long, do more than the normal human can do, and turn into a magical garment girl (this is after said girl tried to kill him again with a magic chainsaw that Ash of the Evil Dead would have respected).  Now with a bevy of cute supernatural roomates (the Necromancer, busty Vampire ninja, and the garment girl), he tries to bring his killer to justice, protect the city as a magic garment zombie, and also show that being dead can be fun.

I am not surprised that they brought out a bluray/dvd combo.  The series is a lot of fun, some fan service but not too over the top, and a bit of violence (mostly to Ayumu).  OVerall it was a good series and I am currently watching the second season.  If you enjoyed it the first time or enjoying the manga you should pick this up.",1391644800,3,1206,4.240174672489083
6251076,5,B00I4F0HTW,"A zombie high school student reanimated by a necromancer after being murdered by a serial killer sets out to bring his killer to justice, but when he unintentionally steals the magical powers of a chainsaw wielding monster slaying girl his unlife becomes much more complicated.

The animation, characters, humor, story and English dub are amazing! A unique take on the zombie mythos and an absolutely hilarious anime!

Be warned that the series is not suitable for children due to all the fan service and if you're unfamiliar with the term then let me explain. Fan service means there are a lot of large jiggling breasts, revealing clothing, panty exposing character animations, poses and camera angles as well as brief nudity and strongly suggestive themes.",1387152000,15,758,5.104838709677419

I'm not going to give anything away as far as the plot, but these people have almost an unnatural obsession with white panties.  This is not your typical kids movie so keep it away from them if you get this!  But, otherwise you would have a good time laughing for almost 2 1/2 hours.",1384387200,,372,4.0

All in all very entertaining Series, fully intend to buy season 2 and hope for a season 3
One of those animes that even though it follows the harem setup, the guy has 0 control at all times, and even has a few heartfelt moments
Well voiced, good stories, OVA episode is hilarious, and never takes itself seriously which is a great thing",1380499200,,522,4.282828282828283

A simple way to sum up this series is:
This is a gem that was, overlooked in my books, kept me hooked for all 10 episodes, has a good english cast and isn't saturated with fanservice.

I was simply surprised at how enjoyable it was and don't regret a single minute spent watching it. Must watch, Buy if you REALLY want DVD's for some reason.",1369180800,,485,4.204301075268817

Well my wife being the loving and generous person that she is bought it for me as a surprise. This series was hilarious! Our main character is a zombie that lives with his necromancer. Through a series of events he ends up living with several girls in his house that all have strong personalities. I don't want to spoil anything, but the situations become complicated and twisted. The jokes are funny and there really are no dull moments. I am glad my wife bought this for me and I only hope they come out with more seasons.",1366329600,,640,4.297520661157025

6251096,5,B00I4F0HTW,"I pre-ordered this series on a whim.  Didn't know much about it, but once in awhile I like to blind buy an anime set and take a chance.  This happened to be one of those times when my gut feeling was right.  I'll tell you what, I don't like panty shots in my anime, because I'd rather see my girlfriend in real life in her underwear than see that stuff in my anime (from my experience, anime that needs that type of humour lacks story depth).  However, this series was so flipping awesome, I was not bothered by the panty scenes.  What made this series so flipping awesome for me?  The writing, the story, the dialogue, the voice acting, and then everything else LOL.

I like to go to imgur and just check out the random photos.  Because almost every meme is so cleverly done or has a witty comment, it just causes me to bust out laughing or grin, no matter how bad my day may have been or how hard I try and keep my face stoic and stern, that website cracks me up.  This Zombie anime is just like that, except in anime form.  Just when you think you won't have a smile for the day or laugh, you pop this series in and WHAM a random comment or banter between some of the characters and you can't help but crack that rock hard expression on your face into a human smile once again.  I would re-buy this series if they release it in blu-ray.  Regardless, this is a series I will re-watch again and again.",1359763200,3,1402,4.171003717472119

there is just so much to love about this anime, and it has something for every kind of anime fan; such as fan service, comedy, romance, necro, loli, action, and many more things (those are my favorites)

6251098,4,B00I4F0HTW,I was skeptical about buying this series because of the reviews I read. I'm becoming a huge anime fan and slowly getting into the less mainstream anime. This series looked unique and interesting but the fact that it was supposed to be a comedic concerned me. After watching I was thoroughly impressed with the series as a whole. I found it to be not so funny. I don't know if my foreign sense of humor is lacking or I took it more serious than I should have. Either way I loved this series. As for package the outer case is nice and sturdy with some pretty good artwork. Two clear cases are inside. Other than that not much to it.,1358640000,,630,4.258333333333334

I am really hoping they bring the bluray set over here in the usa, this deff looks alot better in 1080p then 480p.

If your looking for a good comedy, i deff recommend this one. Its got comedy, romance and a really great story line.",1358380800,,396,4.012658227848101
