Thank you Marty Balin for our best night together, my boyfriend and I enjoyed your concert and especially meeting you in person.",1418256000,2,250,4.297872340425532
8633178,5,B00HK1PDP4,"This is an excellent DVD showing what Marty is up to recently. The live performances are well produced, Marty's voice sounds as good as ever. If you were disappointed with the Boston Esplanade DVD (I was) you will not be with this one. Not only do you get to see and hear Marty perform you get insightful interviews and a look at his artwork. He performs most of hits from Starship, a few of classic Airplane tunes, as well as many new unreleased tunes. I really enjoyed his new songs Wave and Crazy Over You, amongst others. The solo performance of Comin' Back To Me is stellar as well as the jazzy, soulful take on Runaway.  There is a full set list on Marty's website. The band is tight and knows its place allowing Marty to take the spotlight. The performance is filmed in a small intimate setting, the best way to see and hear a legendary artist such as Marty. If you are a fan of Marty Balin you owe it to yourself to own this one. Don't miss out!",1394496000,2,953,4.265193370165746
