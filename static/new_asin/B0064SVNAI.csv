4953080,5,B0064SVNAI,This movie was GREAT!!!!! I am going to re-watch it to see what I may have missed. It had PLENTY of CREEPY factor and left you going Holy Crow while the last 60 seconds of the movies had you laughing like a mad person! WATCH IT!!!!!,1330646400,,232,4.065217391304348
4953081,5,B0064SVNAI,This was pretty good! I was worried Dennis Quaid's name was only on the movie when in reality he would play a dead guy or just walk through a scene. He made the movie however. It was entertaining and fun in a scary way.,1330560000,,219,4.0
4953082,4,B0064SVNAI,"So it may not be the greatest movie in the world, but Dennis Quaid's performance is a must-see!  For one thing, the idea of him playing a villain is strangely entertaining to begin with, but he does it in a way that's off the charts humorous and interesting.  Right from the crazy first to the crazy last scene, I thoroughly enjoyed that part of the movie!",1330560000,,356,4.378787878787879
4953083,3,B0064SVNAI,"Oscar nominee Dennis Quaid seems to be having a jolly good time playing the demented mortician terrorizing four teenagers in this psychological thriller.
Quaid's rock band DQ and the Sharks also provides some music including the acerbic LOVE SUCKS.
Aimee Teegarden, Tony Oller and Stephen Lansford play the main teens and TV veteran Brett Cullen round out the cast.
The problem with BENEATH THE DARKNESS is its premise is given away at the beginning and there's no doubt where the movie is heading and it takes a little too long getting there.  Quaid is fun to watch and the movie manages to hold your interest.  At least it's not a reboot or remake.  Rent---don't buy!",1330473600,,669,4.8
4953084,5,B0064SVNAI,"What's so surprising about this movie is that it is really good!
The acting is amazing.  A total surprise.
Constant action and both scary and funny.

4953085,5,B0064SVNAI,I think the acting was really good.  I'm impressed with how well the young actors conveyed the intensity of the story. Aimee is just gorgeous and how can you not love her?  She won me over in this movie. Dennis was excellent as a crazy villain in an un-characteristic role for the all-American actor. I understand how this scary story could really happen in a small town.,1329868800,5,371,4.522388059701493
4953086,4,B0064SVNAI,"A groups of bored teens decide to spy on the creepy funeral director because they think his home is haunted. Sounds like the beginning to a bad idea, huh? It gets worse when the kids see something and decide they need to know what it is, deciding it would be worth it to snoop around the next time said home owner is away.

There is something about Dennis Quaid that makes him really creepy now. Its not simply acting - although it is really good - but maybe age or possibly years of acting that shines through in films like these. From the start he is out there being disturbing, too, and i liked that. This movie is powered by him, after all, and his character has to be believably disturbed and it is.

While there are a few places in the beginning that are slow, and the ending of this film - No Spoilers - isn't the best thing in the world, I still liked it. The plot is not one that is complex at all and, as with a lot of horror movies, it can be figured out rather quickly. That said, the chase, the uncovering, the mistakes - those things make up a movie to me. And those kids earn a nice little ""why the hell are you doing that"" badge. The acting is good enough and I kept wondering exactly what Dennis Quaid would end up doing next. there are also a few points that I did not expect - the stairs thing for one - that made me enjoy this more.

This is NOT going to overwhelm you as a film, and it shouldn't see that way. Simply watching the previews should tell you that you can figure it out fast. This is more like a character study off its medication, and I enjoy that. Quaid more than made up for any shortcomings for me.

4953087,3,B0064SVNAI,"""Help me prove he killed Danny."" After thinking they saw a ghost a group of friends start to snoop around the home of local mortician Ely (Quaid). When they get caught something happens that changes their lives forever. Now with only their word it is up to them to convince the cops that the well liked Ely is actually a murderer. I had pretty high expectations for this movie. I really liked ""Mr. Brooks"" and I like Dennis Quaid and seeing him play a psycho I thought would be cool. Once again though like most movies the idea is better then the real thing. While Quaid was creepy the movie itself was very very slow moving and it took over 30 minutes for the movie to really begin. This is another movie where the ending is neat and worth it, but getting to the end is a struggle. This movie doesn't compare at all to ""Mr. Brooks"", but I would like to see Quaid in a better movie playing a character like this one. Overall, very slow and disappointing movie that had a lot of potential. I say C.",1327449600,13,997,4.28042328042328
4953108,3,B0064SVNAI,"Beneath the Darkness is all about Dennis Quaid's unusual character.  Everything else about the film is just about forgettable with lackluster atmosphere and bad writing.  But Dennis Quaid, and his reason for wanting to bury people, his reaction to curious teens entering his home late at night and why he keeps his deceased wife in bed is reason enough to watch this.  It's a passable movie overall.

At first the movie's about Dennis getting revenge on a man who slept with his wife by forcing him into a casket alive underground with nothing but a flashlight to provide light, then the movie shifts in a very different direction with a group of curious teens wanting to discover the mysteries of a strange blue light coming from inside Dennis' living room and what the teens perceive as ghosts dancing slowly.  This part had decent atmosphere because it made the movie look like it was headed in a paranormal direction.

Unfortunately no, it's not going that way at all.  The kids get this idea to sneak into the house and find out what's going on with the dancing ""ghosts"".  They get a surprise when Dennis Quaid greets them upstairs thanks to one of the clumsy teens making racket on his way through the window.  How clumsy!

Well this next part is a slight spoiler so you might not want to read any further if you're planning on watching Beneath the Darkness.  He kills one of the teens by throwing him down the stairs and stepping on his head.  From here all kinds of strange plot points develop.  Why for example would the kids want to go BACK to the house after their friend was just killed?  Why would the teens think that Dennis was wrong for killing their friend?  I understand they were upset over their friends death, but Dennis for the most part did nothing wrong.  It was dark, someone broke into his house, Dennis retaliated/defended himself, and the person who broke into the house died.  Of course Dennis *knew* who it was and killed him anyway but the point still stands that he was mostly innocent.

Anyway all these mysterious questions will be resolved by the conclusion.  I won't spoil anymore.  Let's just say Dennis Quaid is terrific in his role here.  He's obviously messed up in the head because of the things he *thinks* he sees and hears pertaining to his deceased wife, but otherwise Beneath the Darkness is average.  Aimee Teegarden (the female teen of the group) is probably going to be the only other character besides Dennis to make an impression on the viewers because everyone else is forgettable.  So I recommend this movie despite the many moments of average and/or questionable storytelling, the unusual direction the story takes later on and the bad characters other than Aimee and Dennis.",1433462400,,2729,4.723044397463002

All the acting was good.  Dennis Quade is always splendid.  This was a different kind of film venture for him, but he definitely increased the movie's watchability.  Don't take this movie too seriously and you'll find yourself enjoying it.",1420934400,,532,4.536842105263158
4953113,4,B0064SVNAI,"I thought this was a decent horror thriller made very interesting by the excellent Dennis Quaid. Don't know if you've noticed, but horror movies are for the most part a backwater of the industry. It's a great place for directors and actors to get a little exposure, and quite a few of our A-listers have started there. Every once in a while you'll get a vehicle that really gets some Hollywood money and stars--13 ghosts, Flatliners, Poltergeist, series like Saw and Scream...but for the most part horror is indie horror.
For a while back there in the 80s, Dennis Quaid was sort of an A lister, and then, for reasons I don't understand, America fell very much out of love with him. That's a shame but also a blessing, because in the world of horror and sci-fi, out of range of most people's radar, he's doing some of his best work. Here he portrays a man who's juuuuuuuuuuuust teetering on the edge. And he makes e-cigarettes look genuinely scary.
I thought the acting from the rest of the cast was pretty good, but where this movie really falls down is plotting. It hinges too much on the main characters and the police making dumb, dumb choices. That's okay for your tongue-in-cheek slasher movie, but if you want it to be taken as seriously as the tone of this movie suggests, you really have to think it out a little better.",1417392000,,1328,4.5375

4953130,3,B0064SVNAI,"Beneath the Darkness (2012) has far more pretense than suspense, as very early on it is revealed that former football hero Ely Vaughn (Dennis Quaid,&nbsp;,), now a mortician in a small town in Texas, is also a psychotic killer.

A group of high school friends, led by Travis (Tony Oller) and Abby (Aimee Teegarden,&nbsp;) find Vaughns behavior strange, and while the teens are investigating the morticians home, one of them dies in a tragic accident.  Determined to bring Vaughn to justice, Abby and Travis, eventually discover the morticians dark secret.

With Denis Quaid overplaying his role, Beneath the Darkness does have a few mildly entertaining moments, but its juvenile sensibilities make for a film that is difficult to take seriously, although fans of Ms. Teegarden, will doubtless find her performance here enjoyable.",1400544000,,829,5.265151515151516

When it is clear, well, he is a really weird character, obviously very disturbed but the only ones wise to him are the kids in the movie and only after they catch him in the act.  The guy is a real piece of work, hometown hero and respected businessman.  The kids in the story add suspense. This is not a great movie, the story is just a bit fuzzy at times, it has potential but a little something missing.  Worth it for Dennis Quaid's roll, he is just crazy odd.  That is why the 3 stars, weirdly good movie. Did I say weird?  I mean I enjoyed it, the movie is just a bit, yeah, weird.",1392940800,,728,4.084507042253521

4953137,3,B0064SVNAI,"It is great to finally see Dennis Quaid play a character with personality again! Lately, it seems like he plays the same scarred, emotionless character, over and over again. It's hard to remember that it's his charisma that made him a star and you can really see it in Beneath The Darkness. Dennis Quaid plays Vaughn Ely, a mortician who is bat shit crazy. To the town, Ely is this great guy who gives back to the community, but only one person can see him for what he really is. Travis (Tony Oller) is a local teenager who works odd jobs for Ely and has always had suspicions about the man, but never did anything about it. One night, the subject comes up while with his friends and they decide to bust into Ely's home to find out what he's really hiding. The story starts out very slowly and I wasn't expecting it to get any better, but it really does. I already mentioned how good Quaid is, but the star of this film is Tony Oller. I've heard him sing, but I've never seen him act, and to say I was impressed is an understatement. Between Quaid's outlandish behavior and Oller's teenage angst, I didn't need much of a story to follow in order to be entertained. Beneath The Darkness is strange and not everyone is going to like it, but it's one of these films that you keep watching, because you want to know what's going to happen. What happens is that it actually turns into a pretty entertaining and respectable film, that features a star in the making.",1381017600,,1459,4.387453874538745

4953142,2,B0064SVNAI,"Ah, American gothic -- small towns with ugly secrets, and ""ordinary"" people who have gruesome habits where no one is looking.

Nowhere is this genre wasted more than in ""Beneath the Darkness."" This resolutely dull American gothic has an intriguing premise, but induces more snores than scares. This is the kind of movie that should be overflowing with dark, quirky humor -- but instead we get a slow, vague ""thriller"" with no twists or unexpected events. Everything interesting is revealed in the first half hour.

Ely (Dennis Quaid) is a well-loved football-star-turned-mortician in a small Texas town, but ever since his wife Rosemary died, he has become a weird recluse. Little do the townspeople realize that he's all too happy to kidnap people he dislikes at gunpoint and bury them alive in coffins. That's not a spoiler -- he does that in the opening scene, in explicit detail.

But one night a bunch of teens, including the troubled Travis (Tony Oller) and pretty Abby (Aimee Teegarden), break into his house -- and after they find a woman's corpse in Ely's bed, he kills one of them. But the police refuse to believe anything bad about Ely, so the teens must find another way of exposing Ely's murderous streak. The problem is, it might just get them killed...

""Beneath the Darkness"" sounds kind of like a dark comedy, probably with lots of death and over-the-top absurdities. Maybe some ""Tucker and Dale Vs. Evil"" splattergore. If it had turned out that way, it might have been a fun movie. Instead, director Martin Guigui plays the entire thing painfully straight -- the only dark humor is from Quaid's hamtastic villain performance.

So instead of fleshing out the thin plot with something amusing, Guigui grinds slowly through a painfully tedious plot. He just throws in some cliched subplots, most of which feel like they were transplanted from another movie -- there's a subplot about Travis seeing a dark specter over his dying sister's bedside, which is never explained and has NOTHING to do with the main story.

Quaid clearly knew this movie was a stinker, because he gives a hamtasmagorical performance here -- he's all grinning, cackling, mocking cheese, and his final moments in the movie derail what COULD have been a creepy ending. Then again, Ely is not as creepy as Guigui clearly thinks he is, since his ""dark secret"" is cribbed from superior thrillers.

There is one good quality to the movie, though -- the younger actors are actually pretty decent. Oller, Teegarden, Stephen Lunsford and Devon Werkheiser all give the best performances they can, and their characters do occasionally rise above the usual high school stereotypes like ""dumb jock"" or ""best friend.""

""Beneath the Darkness"" isn't horrifying, just horribly tedious. Dennis Quaid's hamfest of a performance provides some unintentional comedy, but just about everything else is just dull, slow and lackluster.",1367625600,,2899,5.025

One part teen horror, one part necrophilic shocker... It would seem that BENEATH THE DARKNESS has much to offer the Horror audience, but this tame and tired thriller fails to spark even the least amount of interest. Dennis Quaid plays a rather weak villain. He is neither creepy nor intimidating, and often looks silly while attempting to be either. No one in the angst-ridden cast of annoying teen stereotypes even remotely comes forward as the film's hero, and they instead form a group of anti-heroes that break into the poor man's house without reason and get what they have coming to them. With no compelling characters, a questionable plot, minimal shocks, and only a handful of bloodless murders, BENEATH THE DARKNESS becomes a tedious viewing experience. It cribs nearly its entire structure from D.J. Caruso's DISTURBIA, but doesn't think to steal either its humor or suspense. Like Quaid's few hapless victims, this film is better left buried BENEATH THE DARKNESS.

4953145,5,B0064SVNAI,"That's how this excellent little mystery-horror film from 2011 struck me, and I mean that in a good way.

PLOT: Dennis Quaid plays a creepy mortician in a central Texas town. A group of teens decide to trespass his abode for thrills and everything goes awry.

Quaid and cutie Aimee Teegarden head the cast, but it's Tony Oller who shines here as the troubled protagonist. He's very reminiscent of Robby Benson.

Like I said, the story is akin to a Scooby-Doo yarn, but realistic and without the dog. Although Quaid is over-the-top and somewhat campy as the villain the rest of the cast play it straight. I was surprised by the dramatic score and a few really touching scenes.

Some complain that the subplot of a dead sister and a ghost sighting goes nowhere, but it's there for a reason, just think about it.

Although there's some realistic cussing there's zero raunch.

BOTTOM LINE: I was pleasantly surpised by this great little film. It's classy, sometimes moving, mysterious and thrilling at the same time. What more could you ask for in a movie of this ilk?

Shot in Bastrop & Smithville, Texas, the film runs 96 minutes.

Average movie with good ending. The acting is OK but we are not scared at any moment (like the Vanishing for example) and we know how everything will end. Well, we think we know until the very end!

Which he has rarely ever done (if ever!), but he was a major leading man back in the day , so he was usually cast as the hero. This was only at the theatres for month in a limited release. But that's still better than most 58 year old actors get. The film looks great on blu ray and there is a documentary on the making of this movie. This is a average thriller or horror flick take your pick. It's ok and cast does a good job with a average script too. In fact we do have one supernatural scene in this movie where a kid sees death take his sister away.

4953165,2,B0064SVNAI,"Always have been a fan of Dennis Quaid - Dreamscapes, InnerSpace, Enemy Mine, etc. - so I was really looking forward to seeing what he has been up to recently. Unfortunately, he put himself into one of these ""teen horror"" movies which doesn't bode well. He does give a good performance, and through the movie I was actually rooting for him to be the ""winner"" at the end, just because these teen movies are becoming more and more horrible in way of the acting of the kids in the movies.

Dennis Quaid's acting was pretty good... the rest of the actors seemed to have phoned it in. Recommendation? Wait until it hits the .99 cent queue, or better yet, wait until it goes to the Prime queue. Just don't sign up for Prime to just watch this... it's not worth it.",1334534400,,758,4.375886524822695

4953167,3,B0064SVNAI,"Dennis Quaid makes this movie -- and I think it's actually worth renting it to see his performance.  But, be warned this is a VERY SLOW movie and the scenes with the teenagers at the high school are boring.  Did you ever watch the old Friday the 13th: The Series show on TV?  If so, there's an episode with a funeral home director that's one of the creepiest of that series.  This movie is a little bit like that. As other reviewers have stated, it's also a little bit like ""Disturbia"".  But if you are watching it late at night when you are tired, you will probably fall asleep in parts.  I actually watched the movie in two sittings because I got so bored and tired that I had to go to bed...but I watched the rest of it the next morning.  So, I guess you can say this movie is good enough that I wanted to keep watching to see the end but that it was not good enough to keep me interested and awake the first time I tried to watch it.

If you are a fan of Dennis Quaid, then you will like this no matter what. But if you want to watch a really good, scary movie, then maybe you can do better.",1332806400,,1095,4.013824884792626
4953178,3,B0064SVNAI,"In my mind, scripts and dialogue, for both theatrical and TV, overall, have gotten better over the years. Looking at ""Justified"", ""The Closer"", ""Deadwood"" et al, it's an easy point to make. But when you see this stinker you can't help but wonder who was at the helm. How can they have taken a decent plot line and screwed it up so entirely with clumsy points and rotten dialogue.

Here's the scoop. Some teens in a Texas town think something is wrong at the house of the local mortician (Dennis Quaid). Is the house haunted? Is something else afoot? One night they break into the house to check things out. They see something they shouldn't and Quaid kills one of the group. He tells the authorities the kid fell and no one will believe the rest of them because they're kids who were committing a crime. Now it's up to the survivors to set things straight.

The producers must have put all their money on Quaid because pretty much everything else is doo-doo. It's a cross somewhere between ""Halloween"" and ""Psycho"", but neither is done justice. The night scenes (and there are many) are so dark the screen goes almost entirely black. And I have decent gear to view with. The characters are little more than cardboard. Brett Cullen is Okay as the sheriff but there isn't enough there to save it. The dialogue is just awful and some of the plot points are so clumsy it's nearly unbelievable. It's a shame because the story outline is decent to the point that it could have been worked into a truly frightening film.

So Quaid collects a paycheck. The kids do what they can with the sub-prime script and all potential gets flushed down the toilet. They should use this in a class for would-be film makers as a project on how it could be made better. If anyone fails there is no hope for them.",1331769600,2,1789,4.498461538461538

Problems:
Over the top bad creepy guy was so laughable and not believable that the rest of the movie lost it's credulity connection with this audience. He kills a neighbor for sleeping with his wife and police are no where to be seen on such an obviously solvable case. He throws one of our teens down some stairs and stomps on his head. A teen witness tells police and they don't look for forensic evidence on the dead teen or stairs. The clueless beyond dumb actions of the teens, parents of the teens and the police and the viewer is left with, ""Who cares.""
Besides bland and not realistic acting the whole story lacked flow, emotion and, most importantly, an ending. Mortician ends up in padded cell. So what else is new.",1331769600,4,872,4.662337662337662
4953180,3,B0064SVNAI,"By Jim Clark, publisher Lee County Courier, Tupelo, MS

Dennis Quaid used to be a bankable star. He was especially good in The Rookie, in Wyatt Earp as Doc Holliday, The Day After Tomorrow and as Jerry Lee Lewis in Great Balls of Fire.
His fall to playing a creepy funeral director in Beneath The Darkness just goes to show what multiple marriages and rehab problems can do to you.
But I've not given up on Dennis. In the 2010 pix The Special Relationship where he took on Bill Clinton, he was nominated for many awards including Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor.
Beneath the Darkness isn't terrible. I'm just afraid the producers played it too straight to attract their primary audience, teenagers.  There is little campy humor, There is no nudity, just a little bad language and some violence.
Four teenage friends, Travis (Tony Oller), Abby (Aimee Teeagarden of Friday Night Lights), Brian (Stephen Lunsford) and Danny (Devon Werkheiser) think there are ghosts at the local funeral home in their small Texas town.
They enter at night and discover the ghost they think they see Ely (Quaid) dancing with is actually his dead wife, Rosemary, who he's preserved.
They get caught and Ely fearlessly kills one of them. The other three go immediately to the police. The police investigate, find nothing and end up apologizing to Ely, a pillar of the community.
The three remaining teenagers are determined to expose Ely for what he is -- but underestimate this madman.",1331596800,2,1479,4.865079365079365
4953181,2,B0064SVNAI,"My biggest disappointment is that the by-line reveals too much about the film. I will assume you have read it. The opening scene of Quaid burying alive his wife's lover was decent. It moves to a classroom scene where the discussion is about both Poe and Macbeth...nice tie-in.

Travis (Tony Oller) plays the moody teen lead who laments over his dead sister, and sometimes sees ghosts which he confides in cheerleader Abby (Aimee Teegarden). One night some of the teens, thinking Quaid isn't home, enter his mortician residence ghost hunting, only to find he is at home and has an unhealthy relationship with his dead, embalmed, not exactly buried wife.

The movie starts out like it is going to be a barn burner, then it slows and dies.

4953182,3,B0064SVNAI,"I would have given this movie 5 stars if Quaids character would have survived. None of the introduced characters that were ""victimized"" were deserving of any sympathy. Stick your nose in someone elses business and you deserve to get it bitten off so to speak.
Quaid is doing quite well as an actor as he ages. I have always been a fan of both him and his currently troubled brother. Dennis has provided me with a lot of entertainment over the years and I owe him at least a hearty thank you......so if you are reading this Mr. Quaid, I appreciate everything you have provided me with in the form of entertainment.",1331337600,2,613,4.482142857142857
4953183,4,B0064SVNAI,"With the casting and the creepy story, this film stands out as being better than the average horror or thriller flick.  A mortician is obsessed with his late wife, and a group of teens stumble onto his dark secrets.  I will not give away any more.",1331251200,2,247,4.3478260869565215
4953184,3,B0064SVNAI,"This movie starts out chillingly enough. It starts as all good scary movies should - with a man walking on a desolate road, unaware of the dark figure closing in on him from behind.

There are also other good things about this movie. The teenagers who are the main characters in the film are intelligent, interacting friends with vocabularies that extend beyond the usual frat house expletives. These teens are individuals that the viewer can get involved with. There are also some good atmospherics, as the teens attempt to enter the funeral director's house to get answers to the strange goings on they think they've glimpsed there.

Unfortunately, this movie gets buried (yes, an intentional pun) by various lapses in logic and continuity. The adults are all too obtuse in their disbelief of the teens' claims. Then the movie threatens to veer off into being a mocking imitation of ""Psycho.""

The main person responsible for that threat is Dennis Quaid himself. He starts off playing his role in a fairly straight-forward manner. But then he jags into a completely campy attitude. He doesn't fit in with the earnest, realistic tone established by the teens. It's almost as if he walked onto the set without any real sense of what the overall mood of the film was intended to be. Dare I say it? As the mortician, Dennis Quaid needed more re-hearse-al.",1331164800,2,1353,4.848484848484849
4953185,3,B0064SVNAI,"I suppose if you are of Aimee Teegarden's generation, this might be more up your alley.  It may seem harsh I gave it three stars.  I can't put this at four or five, there are too many others of this genre that far surpass it.

The first thing I didn't like about the film was how they spent so much time concentrating on building the character of Travis, with the background story of his sister dying in their youth.  There was never a way to tie this in with the Character of Ely (Quaid)losing his wife (although Ely does mention the connection) and towards the latter part of the film, even particularly with the ""revelation"" Travis has in the hospital remembering his sister's death, it has really no significance.  If this was important, then why not tie it in more with the first man (jogger with dog) who is brought into the plot in a big way, only to be nothing more than an afterthought in the film?  The cops act serious and look tough, but are presented as ridiculous clowns so as to allow the teens to appear cunning and resourceful.  The very psyche of Ely never really can be taken seriously, and even when everyone is bungling in and around his home and finding nothing (in order to provide him with more time) it ultimately is too light in any one area.  The sum does not equal the parts here.  Quaid, as always, helps a poor script with his very screen presence, and Teegarden can at least for now, always fill the role of the tough but troubled teenage girl.  Overall, worth a redbox rental if you have nothing else to watch...but bring coffee along with the popcorn.  It's pacing is slow when it should be fast, and fast (like every scene inside the house) when it should be much more thorough in creating tense, frightening moments or areas of discovery...which ultimately become all too predictable.",1331164800,,1819,4.515243902439025
4953186,3,B0064SVNAI,"Well, I've just finished watching it, and let me start by saying, that this movie is not a Horror, it is more of a Thriller, and i'm more of Thrillers fan anyways, so that is a good thing.

Unfortunately, not all Thrillers are good, and this movie, is not that good to be honest.
the Plot in short, involves a group of teens in a small town in Texas, who become interested in a widowed and mysterious local mortician "" played by Quaid "", they start to nose around his house and discover a deadly secret that might cause them their lives.
Does not sound original, does it ? think Fright night ! or Disturbia !
Not only is the plot not original, but the acting is nothing special from the actors supporting Quaid. Quaid himself is very good, though he does seem uncomfortable playing a mysterious evil guy. but those new comer actors did not impress at all. I know, I know..who cares about acting in this, its not like its an Oscar nominated film !!  true, but other elements of the movie did not stand out too. as I mentioned earlier, nothing original about the plot, the fact is its very similar to the two movies i mentioned earlier.

the Film is rated R, yet it lacked any gory scenes or even sex scenes for that matter, it did seem like a PG 13 film to me. Not that im a big fan of Nudity or Sex scenes but come on, spice it up a little !

One of the main reasons I watched this, obviously, was Quaid, I like the guy, and i enjoy watching his films, but i'm really not sure why he agreed to star in this on a budget average thriller ?!?!

I say 2.5 stars, just about your average thriller film, still watchable

8492890,3,B0064SVNAI,"Beneath the Darkness is a low budget film, not sure it if was originally made for TV (there were no extras on the region 4 DVD) but it shares a lot of the look and type of storyline you find on Lifetime movies and ones of that quality. It just lacks the hot but mentally unbalanced female character. It's a teen character movie (although the actors look way older than high school kids), where after deciding to break into his house, they have a run in with their small Texas town mortician (Dennis Quaid) which results in the death of one of them.  The police and the town are on his side and don't want to listen to their ""nonsense"" that Quaid murdered one of them.  So they're determined to get evidence to support their version of events.  Even though that is obviously going to put them at severe risk of death.

Like most budget movies, it relies on one big name (Dennis Quaid) who is no longer swimming in script opportunities, to get the investors and then the viewers who remember him from some great films in the past.  The rest of the cast are actors you likely haven't seen before if they've been in anything.  None of these actors do a bad job, I'd be happy to see them in other films. it's just it's a pretty average script they have to act from. Quaid does a fairly good job as the mortician and carries the film to it's watchable level of enjoyment. It's worth  checking out if you can get the DVD fairly cheap or even if it appears on TV one day.  It'll pass an hour and a half of your time quite well, as long as you're prepared to suspend belief on character behaviour for 90 minutes.",1521417600,,1603,4.28476821192053
