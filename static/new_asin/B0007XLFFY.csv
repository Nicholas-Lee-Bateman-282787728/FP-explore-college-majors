8053590,5,B0007XLFFY,Interesting to see how it's done. I loved it.  The show is great and has wonderful behind the scene folks.,1374710400,,106,4.3
8053591,5,B0007XLFFY,"A fantastic and eye-opening look at the post production process, and how work for the post production starts during pre-production with the script supervisor.  People all know that editors exist and a basic idea of what they do, but this makes it much more clear and understandable.  It also is the first thing I've seen that really explains and explores the role of the script supervisor in a clear and understandable way.

A phenomenally useful video for film and media students.",1268006400,3,481,4.91358024691358
8053592,2,B0007XLFFY,"I picked up a copy of this DVD (matching the cover art pictured) elsewhere for much less than the $79.00 Amazon is asking.  I've had it in my Wishlist for a long time but couldn't find a justification for the price for a single-disk DVD.  It also appears to be the same item as B000JSI7WG (""24"" Behind the Scenes - The Editing Process, $17.99), which is the item that came up when I entered the UPC number into Delicious Library.  This item appears to be an earlier release at educational-materials pricing and the other is a re-release at general market price.

Two stars, as it appears to be overpriced.  I feel sad for those trying to sell it used at nearly the same price.",1173139200,6,676,4.419354838709677
8053593,5,B0007XLFFY,"I saw Journey's Below the Line recently, being a fan of the 24 series, and I was really impressed with all that goes in to making this show happen. So many behind-the-scenes shows spend far too much time focused on talking heads, but Journey's is tight, concise and absolutely packed with useful, practical and fascinating information. Plus it was great to see the connection between the show's staff and stars and how each plays a role in making each production come together. I also noted that Journey's is distributed by First Light Video, so I visited their website: [...] and was absolutely blown away at their selection of instructional programming for the media arts. If you're a student (or teacher) of film and television studies this is simply a must see series and an invaluable resource.",1116892800,9,799,4.882352941176471
