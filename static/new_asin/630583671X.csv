BUT there's more than enough beauty, whimsy, and laughter here to make this worth your time and money.

If you remember the old ""International Festival of Animation"" series on PBS (hosted by Jean Marsh and in our neck of the woods it came on right after Monty Python), you'll know what to expect.  Quirky, artsy, cute, surreal, funny - each one is different and they're all interesting.  some of the art is minimal (but the writing often makes up for that) while some is quite elaborate.  There's quite a mix of styles and moods.

Beautiful stuff.  I might also reccommend Norman MacLaren and the National Film Board of Canada for similar stuff

FYI - I purchased this DVD expecting it to contain what were originally 2 VHS tapes (Be Careful.../Classic Collection).  What I received was a 2 DVD set containing all 5 of the old VHS tapes (Nudity Required/Laugh at Your Own Risk/For Children Only) so it was an even better deal than I'd expected.",1329782400,,1060,4.706521739130435

I noticed a review for one of the other collections gripes about this work not coming close enough to shows like ""The Simpsons"".  This disc is not recommended for an audience expecting American TV animation.  It is, however, potentially very interesting viewing for students of international animation and fillm.",1156032000,13,375,5.543859649122807
