8641753,4,B00IF7O164,"(Soilers!)  There were some really well written storylines in this season of Ocean Girl.  I especially found the concept of the Ocean Boy Kal very interesting and the actor Jeremy Angerson's portrayal of him was very believable and realistic.  The only thing I did not like was how Neri treated him.  I realize that Kal was kind of like a newborn baby, needing to be taught the ways of life and right from wrong, but I feel that Neri went about it in the wrong way.  After Kal expressed the desire to be like a servant and wanting to do things for her, she started taking advantage of that and bossing him around.  Also, she was often running off and leaving him by himself for long periods of time, which is not exactly the kind of thing you should be doing to someone who is fresh and new to the world.  And spending more time with Jason and keeping secrets from Kal was not the best way to positively influence him and it only lead to Kal becoming distant and angry.  If she and the boys Jason and Brett had just let Kal in on things and been more open with him instead of keeping him in the dark, things might have went more smoothly for them.  Instead, due to their treatment of Kal, it turned him against them and caused more trouble for them.  As for plotline, this season's main plot centered around a device called the Synchronium, sent to Earth by Neri's people, to help heal the oceans.  It was broken up into 9 pieces and scattered about the Earth (actually, it was only scattered about Australia).  And in each episode, the kids all have to go on a adventure to find a piece.  Meanwhile, their enemy, Dr. Helengren of UBRI becomes aware of the device as well.  However, that's where some of the weak plot holes come in.  The way he found out about the pieces of the Synchronium was through his assistant, Kellar, who came up with a random idea to use a computer program to search world recordings of space junk and UFO sightings to see if they could find any patterns, and supposedly, these patterns lead them to the conclusion that some of this space junk that fell to Earth must be something important.  This whole theory really doesn't make much sense, due to the simple fact that there must be HUNDREDS if not THOUSANDS of reports on space junk and UFO sightings, not only just in Australia, but the whole world, so to think that detecting a pattern was going to help them find out about the Ocean Girl, when they didn't have much to go off of or even know what they were looking for, and when in reality, most of that space junk and UFO Sightings would have absolutely nothing to do with Neri, was kind of a joke.  Also, they did not even know there was a Synchronium until AFTER they started finding the pieces and discovered from Kal what they were and what their purpose was.  So how did they even know what to be looking for in the first place?  Each time the computer system found a piece that they decided was important, they would drop everything they were doing and set out to find that piece.  But what if when they got there, it proved to be nothing but just random junk?  They would have wasted all that time going after that one piece of junk instead of the real deal.  I felt like the writer was forcing the audience to believe that the enemy was coming to these ""Lucky Guesses"" or conclusions out of nowhere, without really having much evidence that would have even faintly pointed to such conclusions.  This is not being Scientific, as the show was trying to emphasize, but just simply making ""Lucky Guesses"" for the sake of explaining how the enemy knew what they were supposed to be looking for and for the story being able to move on to the ending.  I think they should have made it to where UBRI somehow found out about the Synchronium BEFORE Kal told them, so that there would be a more logical reason for them to be looking through hundreds of random space junk reports and they would know what to actually look for.  It just seems hard to find something important when you have nothing to go off of.  Anyway, the only other thing I found disappointing was that there was this beautiful and sweet character named SallyAnne and she had a crush on Jason, but Jason was oblivious to her and kept avoiding her to go help Neri.  I truly believe SallyAnne would have devoted her life to Jason, to his dreams, to his desires, just to be his woman and would have done anything for him, but he kept ignoring her.  Throughout the whole series, Neri has never really expressed any romantic feelings (except for the silly One Second Kiss she gives him at the end of every season), and she has made it clear several times that she is there on Earth to protect the ocean and maintain her Father's mission.  Not for romance.  And she never shows much interest in romance or having a relationship.  And Jason acts more like her brother.  This being said, I think it would have been better if Jason had gotten with SallyAnne, who you could very clearly tell was in love with him and would have done anything for him.  As it was, SallyAnne was the last person to ever find out about Neri and she didn't even find out until like the last two episodes.  And at the very end, the last we see of her is on the island, where she and the other kids are rejoicing because the Synchronium has healed the oceans.  I don't have any objections to a human getting with an alien, but I feel like it would have made a cute and pleasant twist to the story to put SallyAnne with Jason and bring her with him into Season 4 as his girlfriend, and just let the story end with Neri not getting with anyone, or maybe hooking her up with Kal.  You just really have to watch this show for yourself, from beginning to end, to see why I think Neri does not fit with Jason.  Beyond their Brother/Sister chemistry, there really isn't anything there.",1450396800,,5843,4.3768518518518515
8641754,3,B00IF7O164,"In my opinion, this was the weakest season of the entire series.  It almost felt as though the writers were running out of storylines, so they just opted to go for the whole 'aliens-built-the-pyramids' backstory as a way out.  There were several weak plot holes, and having two ""CIA Agents"" chasing after Neri the whole time just felt like an overused theme.  And the last minute kisses Neri and Jason shared at the ending of every season felt forced and unnecessary.  Especially since there was never really any romance between the two throughout the whole show, it just felt kind of weird and out of place to see them making out at the end of each season.  At the most, Jason only showed concern for Neri and her wellbeing throughout the show, acting more like her brother than anything else.  He never really was a romantic type of character, nor did he really display any romantic feelings for Neri.  So to see them suddenly start kissing at the end of season 4 just made it feel like the writer was trying to force the idea on you at the last minute, ""Hey, we didn't have any real romance in the show, but look, they're kissing, so they MUST be e a couple"".  Personally, I thought Jason looked better with the pretty SallyAnne from Season 3.  They had more onscreen chemistry as far as girlfriend/boyfriend goes. The only thing I ever got from watching Jason's interaction with Neri was that he thought of her as like his sister, whom he came to visit on the island often, to check in on and help out.  Nothing more.  Other than that and the fact that this season felt a little rushed in parts, I guess it was an okay ending.  Also, as I understand it, the actress who played Neri, Marzena Godecki was getting tired of playing that part and wanted to move on, and since the basic story was told already, there wasn't much else to do except quickly end the show.  But for the sake of having the complete show, it is worth buying.",1450396800,,1933,4.441926345609065

8641756,5,B00IF7O164,Hello. This is a very good TV series for youth.,1410652800,2,47,3.8
8641757,5,B00IF7O164,"The producers went all out on this one with a lot of computer generated FX and some really nice set work. Over the course of this final season you'll, finally, see Neri & Mera's homeworld. Apparently the Ocean People,( unlike previous seasons they never seem to wear shoes) traveled to Earth centuries before and built at least one pyramid in Egypt as well as a Stargate looking travel system in Australia and are still remembered in local legends.

 The plotting by an enemy to take the power that is rightfully Neri's is explained in stages- the man was responsible for Neri's shipwreck and, seemingly, the death of her mother. We finally learn that Neri's mother was the Queen of her people as Neri one day will also be. In the end it's the kids, again, who save everything from their enemies.

Lot's of plot weaknesses and ""why was this detail changed /introduced?"" bits but the producers/ writers did tie all the little bits & pieces of 4 season's worth of story elements and come to a pretty good conclusion.

Very impressive teen TV that holds up well in spite of it's (1997 production) age - well worth owning.",1361750400,7,1118,4.6313131313131315
