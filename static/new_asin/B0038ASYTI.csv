4084162,5,B0038ASYTI,"After working with preschoolers for 20+ years, one can imagine the disappointing programming for children that I've seen steadily declining over the years in terms of educational content, violence and inappropriate messages. Sadly, the most obvious place I've seen evidence of this has been in young children's behavior and outlook on life in general at a time when they are most vulnerable to what they are exposed to.  Storyland Yoga is a brilliant light shining for our future!  The DVD indeed teaches yoga in a gentle, entertaining and interesting way by the gentle, entertaining and interesting Ahmed Fahmy. But the story goes beyond a lesson about yoga; it is a much needed message to children about the beauty of the world they live in and how important it is to care for it.  It is amazing how Ahmed imparts these messages with an aura of peacefulness and excitement at the same time!  I was mesmerized as I watched Ahmed weave his magic with children and felt joyful about the possibilities for our children and our future.  I know what will catch and hold children's attention, and there is no doubt that any child would be as mesmerized and entertained as I was.  Storyland Yoga DVD will most definately be included in our children center's curriculum which is designed to prepare young children for their world.  I hope parents everywhere will do the same!",1271030400,3,1368,4.84549356223176
4084163,5,B0038ASYTI,"Have you ever seen kids completely mesmerized by a DVD that wasn't a cartoon or movie? Me neither until we played Playful Planet's Storyland Yoga DVD for our kids. My son Marcel (5 yrs) and my daughter Valentina (2 1/2 yrs) were stopped in their tracks and began imagination play with Ahmed once I started the DVD. Seriously! Ahmed takes them on nature adventures finding condor eggs, pretending to be snakes, and ride bicycles, using imagination and yoga movements like you've never seen before. Ahmed is a genius yoga instructor and you'll be pleasantly surprised how much your kids will love doing yoga while viewing Playful Planet's Storyland Yoga DVD. We bought a couple more to gift away. You can't beat the price.",1270252800,4,720,4.861788617886178
4084164,5,B0038ASYTI,"As an introduction to yoga, this DVD is perfect.  My five year old follows the movements easily because they are presented in a fun, interactive way.  The earth conscious stories are wonderful, and keep us engaged throughout.",1270252800,2,225,5.054054054054054
4084165,5,B0038ASYTI,"I purchased this DVD with the intention of practicing yoga with my 5 year old in the mornings.  Not only did my daughter love imitating the ""animal poses"", she asked me questions about our environment and how we can help ""save the planet""!

As we completed the DVD, my daughter really enjoyed the experience and even I got a great stretch doing it with her!

I recommend this DVD for all kids. It's a great time to have time together and not only was it good for our bodies, it was informative and interesting as well.  We loved it!",1269129600,5,532,4.343434343434343
4084166,5,B0038ASYTI,"When my 4-year old twin boys ask for this video instead of a cartoon, I have to go online and give a review. Fantastic video, holds their attention, can be done all at once or in sections. Easy poses for the kids and a storyline to keep them interested. The beach setting is awesome. The instructor is calming and fun at the same time.",1485043200,,335,4.25

4084168,5,B0038ASYTI,I use this in our Karate School. I teach martial arts to kids under 8 and we learn Tai Chi and Yoga moves as well. The kids love all the movements that were taught in this video. Lots of fun to watch with the students too and have them move along with the show.  Good stuff!,1483488000,,274,3.892857142857143

4084173,4,B0038ASYTI,"This is a great introduction to/practice of yoga poses for young children. My three-year-old daughter loves the story and the ways in which it is performed, demanding to do this yoga pretty much every day. The only downside in my experience is that the poses switch very rapidly at times and there is no instruction (not even recommendations on the part of the instructor) as to how to do the poses correctly or well. Still, very happy with the purchase.",1477094400,,454,4.6875
4084174,5,B0038ASYTI,"Love it. My 2.5 year old very intuitively tried all the poses and stayed engaged throughout both episodes. I just added movements for my own practice. Brilliant. We watched the whole hour twice in a row... Both episodes have great messages to preserve, be kind, and help others. And no, it's not ""real"" yoga as so many reviewers state but it's the best intro to it I can imagine. We did a more intentional and calming practice without a story as well.",1476230400,,451,4.512195121951219
4084175,5,B0038ASYTI,Love it. My 4 and 6 year old boys love this yoga video.,1473206400,,55,3.3076923076923075

4084177,5,B0038ASYTI,My kids love this video. It doesn't hold their attention long (ages 3 and 5) but they can go right back to it when they are ready. They ask for it often.,1470787200,,153,3.8125
4084178,1,B0038ASYTI,"Very little yoga, no instruction, lots of boring storytelling.  My child kept saying ""they're not doing anything!""",1470700800,,114,5.705882352941177
4084179,5,B0038ASYTI,"My girls are having a blast with this DVD. They are 3.5 and 5 and think the names of the poses (mermaid, sailboat, swordfish etc) and the story are so much fun! They are super engaged in every pose, giggling and enjoying it thoroughly. A total hit. I could have done without some of the crunch (electric car preaching and the like - fine I guess just not really what I was looking for in my yoga DVD). But really cute and the beach scenery is a bonus. I'll also note that some of the names aren't the real names of the poses, so if that's important to you, this may not be the introductory kids DVD you're looking for.",1470009600,2,618,4.158333333333333

4084183,5,B0038ASYTI,I am FAR from a yoga person but my daughter wanted to do yoga.  She is 4 and just loves this DVD.  She begs to do it.  I'm not sure how much of a workout it is but she really gets into it.  The instructor tells stories and the kids have to act out the story.  It is great for kids.,1466208000,,281,3.540983606557377
4084184,5,B0038ASYTI,My kids really like this Yoga show. They ask to do yoga often and I'm glad we found this story time yoga movie for them to do it with.,1465344000,,134,3.6551724137931036

4084192,5,B0038ASYTI,This is my preschool daughter's favorite yoga video. We have tried some others but she always asks for this one. We do it together and it is fun. I love the environmental lessons from the stories too.,1456876800,,200,4.4324324324324325

4084199,1,B0038ASYTI,"The pauses between exercises are too long. My 7 year old grandson who loves PBS yoga for children, could not stay focused on Storyland Yoga as it does a poor job of keeping the children engaged.  I tried doing it with him and found it very boring.  I am going to see if I can purchase the PBS children's yoga dvd instead.",1445904000,,321,4.161290322580645
4084200,2,B0038ASYTI,"Not very good. I'm spoiled by Yoga Kids 2. Stories were hard to follow, more focused on the guy's ego, not much instruction or time given to yoga poses/children's activity.",1444694400,,172,4.766666666666667

4084205,5,B0038ASYTI,"We are not avid regular yoga people but appreciate the potential of it as a stress relieving and centering strategy for our kids. My boys (later 2 and 4 when I bought the video) enjoy the stories, the instructor's tone, and the exercises. I recommend it!",1435881600,,254,4.543478260869565
4084206,2,B0038ASYTI,"While good intentioned, the production quality is just not there. Super close ups, choppy transitions, not very clear or easy to follow. Not a fan, sorry!",1435536000,,154,4.961538461538462

4084212,3,B0038ASYTI,"I don't know how I feel about this. The story is fine, but the weird close ups of the instructor's face to emphasize certain parts of the narration really weirds me out. However, my three and a half year old gets a kick out of it, doesn't seem put off by the weirdness, and actually follows right along.  Bottom line: I don't love it, but my little one thinks it's cool and it mostly holds his attention.",1430179200,,404,4.246753246753247

4084214,5,B0038ASYTI,Condor yoga is very fun and keeps the daycare kids moving .  Unfortunately the same can not be said about whale yoga.  Worth the money because condor yoga is just that good.,1429488000,,173,4.375

4084218,3,B0038ASYTI,The first section does not show enough of the yoga poses and is slow.  My daughter loved the second portion and immediately jumped in to do the work out.,1425859200,,153,4.275862068965517
4084219,5,B0038ASYTI,My daughter enjoyed doing this yoga.  Wish there was more available.  Very cute stories to go along with movements and poses.,1425859200,,125,4.904761904761905

4084222,2,B0038ASYTI,Exercise were hard for my kids to follow because the guy does not tell the audience what to do he just does it. If you are not paying close attention to his movement you get behind.,1424304000,,181,4.055555555555555

4084225,4,B0038ASYTI,"My son really enjoyed it. It's not so much focused on the yoga poses, but yoga-type movement and a good introduction to really basic poses. Each pose correlates to things like being a wolf, bear, crocodile, frog, etc. The lead is an extreme California yoga type, but there's nothing wrong with that. It's all full of very positive, very environmentally friendly messages.",1419724800,,371,5.0

4084227,5,B0038ASYTI,"My daughter LOVES this dvd and I was pleasantly surprised at the clever usage of ""real"" yoga poses in the story.  Provides a nice mellow workout for adults, too, which is nice when there is only time for ONE yoga routine and it's the children's one.",1419033600,,249,4.413043478260869
4084228,5,B0038ASYTI,Very cute. Great for 4-6year olds who are wanting to do a bit of Yoga.,1418947200,,70,3.7333333333333334

He still asks to do yoga every day!",1418169600,,345,4.580645161290323
4084231,1,B0038ASYTI,"I had high hopes for this, but I am glad I rented it before my purchase went through.  There is no instruction, and my five-year-old didn't like the disjointedness of the stories.  I had to repeatedly stop and explain the moves to her.  Not worth the month in my opinion.",1416614400,,271,4.38
4084232,2,B0038ASYTI,"I bought this and A Child's Way to Yoga the same day. My kids love A Child's Way and we stream it regularly for Yoga. My kids are toddlers though, so maybe that makes a difference. I think A Child's Way would be fun for older kids too, but I read a reviewer who sounded completely insulted by the immaturity of a yoga workout designed for young children (go figure); apparently her children were insulted by the childlike nature of the video too (shrug).

Anyway, we tried this video on the same day and it was a total fail. We tried it again and it was another fail. The teacher in the video seems to be doing more entertaining and storytelling than actual yoga. It doesn't seem to cover a lot of ground for the length of the video and my children were bored by it. It takes a very creative approach at associating stories with poses, which I have to give them credit for. However, it just wasn't that great because my kids didn't like it. It didn't have cute music or anything like the other workout video I mentioned (though the music on the other one is totally amateur, it's still fun for kids and the lyrics are instructional for where the child is supposed to be at in their pose; which is cool.)

I recommend trying the other video I mentioned, if you're looking for a yoga workout to stream for your kids. You may like this one though, who knows. Everyone is different.",1416009600,3,1378,4.357976653696498
4084233,1,B0038ASYTI,"Aweful. Does not lead smoothly from one move to another, there is no instruction for the kids, it is just a video of a guy telling a story to kids while they all do yoga sort of.",1414281600,,178,3.8378378378378377
4084234,1,B0038ASYTI,Too slow. My two 4 year old's and my 3 year old immediately lost interest in this extremely slow moving story line with very poor direction on the yoga positions. Recommend trying a different video.,1413504000,,198,4.685714285714286
4084235,4,B0038ASYTI,"Pretty good video.  My 6 year old LOVES it and will ask to watch the video and practice on her own.  As an adult, I find the instructor to be irritating.  But, this video wasn't made for me, it's for my daughter and she doesn't mind!! The duration is perfect.",1412640000,,259,4.14

4084238,5,B0038ASYTI,Love love love. Great video. And right on my smart tv. Awesome and convenient. My kids pull out their mats and off they go to imagination land.,1408665600,,143,4.333333333333333
4084239,2,B0038ASYTI,I tried it with my newly turned three year old.  She was not interested.  I will put it away and try again in a few months.  I like the energy of the teacher but I felt like there could have been more flow from story to story and from each exercise to exercise.  It felt a little too cut up for me.  But I feel like I want to like this DVD.  So we are not giving up on this one yet!,1407888000,,382,3.597560975609756

4084241,2,B0038ASYTI,"After doing Cosmic Kids yoga videos with my daughter, it was difficult to appreciate this video. The graphics are all over the place and the story is not very exciting. It did get my daughter doing basic yoga moves but I had to make it more interesting for her to get into it.",1406764800,,276,4.226415094339623
4084242,5,B0038ASYTI,Not only is this perfect for my high-energy 4 year old but it is for me too. Love this one and would absolutely buy more (hint hint) if Storyland did a sequel.,1404259200,,159,4.0
4084243,3,B0038ASYTI,"It was difficult to follow the moves.  Nothing is said about ""correct"" poses, which is fine, it's kids, but it's hardly said when a pose changes either.  So if you are on the in downward dog, you don't realize they changed to something else.  The stories were good, but i wish the poses could flow a little better without so many gaps between them of just sitting or standing there waiting for the next pose.  VERY good idea to put the movements to a story though.  I give them props for that.  Just hard to keep up with the poses, and/or really know what pose he's going for sometimes.",1403654400,,586,4.330275229357798
4084244,4,B0038ASYTI,"We were looking for an indoor activity option for rainy days and winter months.  My 3 year old was a little more into it than my 5 year old, but they both like it.  The story wraps yoga poses into animal themes that the kids can relate to and then brings it all together at the end.  It's a good introduction.",1403568000,,309,4.032786885245901
4084245,5,B0038ASYTI,"The kids love this and have continued to ask to watch this over several years.  One of them was slightly scared of the bear in the story when really little but is fine now.  Ages are pretty spot on.  I do yoga and they can do some of the adjust moves with me.  A great way to introduce kids to yoga, stretching, being active and using some imagination.",1400803200,,352,4.132352941176471
4084246,5,B0038ASYTI,"I wanted a way to get my kids to exercise when cooped up in bad weather.  We bought it 2 years ago when my daughter was 3 and my son 5 and they still enjoy it even now.  A great way to mix exercise and imagination... and also a decent exercise for parents and grandparents to do as well.

My 4 and 5 year old daughters love it so much they ask me every day if they can do Yoga (mission accomplished for this Mommy).  The DVD goes through a story and incorporates movements in with the story.  Now, not all of it is necessarily Yoga, but it still keeps them moving and flowing into Yoga positions.  My oldest daughter is hyper at times, and this works to help teach her how to calm herself down.",1390003200,,526,4.077669902912621

He is still a bit young, but I like that he sees us doing something healthy and he is also getting exposure to this healthy thing to do.

4084258,4,B0038ASYTI,"I rented this via Amazon Prime for my 3-year-old son, hoping for a good way to get him moving while we were cooped up inside due to cold weather. The first time I put it on, he preferred to just watch the first adventure and wouldn't do the poses, but he was fascinated all the same. The next day he specifically asked me to put on the yoga video, and did the poses through most of the second adventure even though it was his first time seeing that one.

The instructor, Ahmed, is engaging and likable, and it's clever the way he renames traditional yoga poses to make them fit into the story. I was afraid that it was going to be too preachy, when I read other reviews saying that it talks a lot about saving the earth/whales/etc., but it was just a lot of fun and not too heavy-handed. My son loved the way Ahmed brought so many animals into it and encouraged the kids to use their imaginations.

My only criticism is that it is sometimes difficult to know what to do next when you're already in a pose, because Ahmed often just shows what to do instead of specifically describing how to do it, so until you're familiar with the story and what comes next, it can be a little disjointed. Otherwise, it's a great yoga intro for kids!",1389571200,,1233,4.28755364806867

We have a yoga series that we really enjoy that is stories through yoga and I was looking for something similar because we have done all of those episodes many times. The description seemed to match what I was looking for and bought it for my classroom. After about 10 minutes, we stopped watching it and that will most likely be the last time it was one. There was little activity for that time and mostly the instructor talking. What we really enjoy about the other video is that it is constantly moving and the kids are engaged from start to finish, this was not true in this video. My students were not engaged and easily distracted while waiting for something to do. It did't fit my needs but may work for some kids who are older. I am looking for something that keeps them moving and interested rather than sitting watching the instructor talk.",1387756800,,898,4.4817073170731705
4084262,5,B0038ASYTI,We received this for a gift for my 3 year old daughter. We've rented a kids yoga dvd from the library before and she loved it but I thought it was a little too advanced for her. This DVD is GREAT! Ahmed is a fantastic story teller and holds my daughter's attention. While I don't feel the dvd is as yoga based as the previous one I've seen for kids this is a great dvd.  Story telling through movement which I think is just as great for kids and their imagination and well being!  There are 2 stories both approximately 20 min and my daughter loves them both. While the stories are a little silly to adults they are perfect for the little ones. Mine followed the stories and really enjoyed them. She's asked for the dvd multiple times and we've only had it a few days. I wish he spent a little more time setting up the moves for the kids but I think the more we watch it she will catch on to everything. *There is a section in the extras that goes over basic yoga moves however it doesn't say outloud what the moves are when showing them. It's just written on the screen but it's a pretty good tutorial.,1387324800,,1103,4.173708920187793
4084263,3,B0038ASYTI,"My 4 year old daughter enjoys this, but she doesn't follow the moves so easily.  I think Mr. Fahmy tells a fun story - he's really animated and excited - but I really wish he described the poses and accentuated what he's doing when he's getting into a pose.  This is less about yoga and more about doing movement through a story.  The first story (about condors) is better than the second one.  My daughter only wanted to replay the first story.  I kind of wish I had rented this one first to see what it was about.  Still, it's not a bad purchase.",1386460800,,548,4.221153846153846

She wasn't able to stay attentive throughout the entire DVD, but she participated the best she could in many of the activities and stretches and enjoyed the story during the other parts. I love that this is a fun, imaginative, healthy activity for children to do and something the parents can do with them if they want. I am all about keeping my family healthy and active, so I thought it was super cute and fun! I do think if my daughter was a little older, I would probably give 5 stars, but I love this is something that I will be able to keep and do with her for a long time to come.",1378771200,,694,4.110294117647059

He said a few times, ""oh you gotta be kidding me!"" usually around the host bubble that pops up above the full screen and the animation, which is not very impressive or necessary.  The bummer about this DVD is that the concept is awesome...telling a story through yoga moves so the kids don't even know they are doing them really, and the time flies by.  I just wish the quality of the production was a lot better.  I could see this not being an issue for a really young kid, but a kid with any sophistication will find it lacking.",1362268800,,687,4.181818181818182

4084323,3,B0038ASYTI,"My six-year old daughter was interested in trying yoga, so we tried out this video.  Maybe it's geared for a much younger audience because she was simply bored by it.  The instructor is personable and animated, but it just doesn't have enough activity and the main yoga seems to come at the very end.  I think it is more towards the age three audience (not for five and above).  It needs to be more challenging to be something an older child would want to do more than one time.",1357257600,,478,4.337078651685394

I bought this for my 2 and a half year old daughter, because she always wants to do my yoga dvds with me.  Since her attention span seems to be very short for it (a few minutes, then she's off doing something else), I thought having a story to listen to during the yoga would help.  I think it does, as long as I'm there guiding her through the moves and encouraging her.  I think when she's a little bit older, she'll enjoy it more.

I did a ton of research into kids yoga DVD's. There were mixed reviews on almost all of them so I settled on this one. It was wierd. The instructor tells various animal videos while trying to incorporate poses into the story telling. The graphics are cheesy. The children in the video aren't really learning the poses or what the poses are even doing for them. My son was watching the story part and wasn't even doing the poses. He even said ""this isn't real yoga mommy"". He lost interest after about 15 minutes. I definitely would NOT recommend this. I returned it and now I'm on another search for a different one.",1348531200,11,762,4.2620689655172415
4084329,5,B0038ASYTI,"I found this DVD to be an excellent introduction to yoga for my very active, busy, 3 yr old boy because it immediately engaged his imagination. Then he was hooked on yoga as fun and playful. My wiggle worm won't sit still and focus if an activity isn't interesting or engaging. This DVD does the trick. He will ask for it, concentrate through an entire story, then ask for another. The first time we watched it he just sat, entranced by the imaginative storytelling and was only mildly aware of or interested in participating in the yoga movements. The second time I suggested we watch it he got very excited at the idea and participated more. After that he started asking for it and pretending to do yoga moves randomly throughout the day, as well as parroting some of the story and incorporating it into his free-time creative play. Parent participation is very helpful if not required at the beginning to help the child see and emulate the yoga moves, but after just a few viewings my boy is actively participating and doing almost all the moves on his own. My goal is to keep it fun and interesting so we aren't real concerned with the technical aspect of the moves.",1341273600,,1170,4.549763033175355

I put in the DVD and while in the kitchen, she was laughing up a storm and so engaged! Now, albeit she does love animals and has a grand imagination which may have contributed to her loving this, but regardless, I am so happy she genuinely enjoyed it with no ""coaxing"" from me. Since she has never done any exercise to a video before and never heard of Yoga, when the DVD started, she did need me to explain that she is supposed to do what the kids are doing. So, I am not sure if they did not explain this in the video or not (I will need to watch it with greater detail), but if they did, I still had to explain to her that she needed to duplicate the movements. I am hoping this will still engage her a couple of years from now. Please make more??",1339718400,2,865,3.9485714285714284

4084332,4,B0038ASYTI,"My son is 3, and for the most part he enjoys this DVD.  I find the buildup to sun salutation in the ""Condor Eggs"" segment quite clever, but my son is afraid of the bear, which disrupts the routine.  I wish there were more instruction on the poses and longer holds for each pose, but as an intro to yoga, this dvd has done the trick.",1331856000,,332,4.015151515151516
4084333,3,B0038ASYTI,"While it kept my son engaged since it was SO short, there HAS to be something better out there! This is SO choppy as far as moving from one pose to the next. It pauses between poses, where the yogi has a close-up while talking to the camera then cuts to an animated clip, so you are left to sit up and get out of the position. There is no instruction as to how to do the positions either. I tried this with my son and it left my body feeling many kinks from it not being smooth or even, as far as both sides of the body.",1330041600,12,520,3.824074074074074
4084334,5,B0038ASYTI,"All that really mattered to me was that my six year old daughter was engaged in this video. She absolutely loved the storytelling part along with watching the kids on screen trying out all the poses and interacting with the story. She loves this!!! In the end of all things that truly mattered, this was it! Coming in as her parent, I can be happy knowing she is doing something productive with what screen time I allow her, while learning something (added bonus!)...this in turn gives me free moment to do things on my ever growing list of things to get done (cause we all have them!), knowing she is safe watching and doing something safe and engaging. Some advice if you care to hear it, don't be discouraged by how ""weird"" (as mentioned in some reviews) The Yogi is engaging and the kids really just are attracted to that style that he carries. As adults, we may have lost that ability to play, let loose and be weird. It's refreshing to see my girl enthralled and playing and yes...I can play with that too!

She loves it and can get into it even though some of the moves are more advanced, she still gets down and tries.  i would definaly recommend to others who want something for their kids to do that is somewhat healthy.  It definatly is a work out.",1324339200,,342,4.2153846153846155

4084341,4,B0038ASYTI,"I love the idea of Yoga for children especially when it is delivered in a positive and enlightening manner.  I love how they are not only learning the basic Yogic moves but they are also learning how to create a positive influence on our planet and our environment.

I am quite impressed that a portion of all sales will go towards helping save the whales and the kids vs. global warming foundations!  I believe these are great values to encompass and pass along to our next generation.

My kids had loads of fun imitating the animals, and listening to the stories that were being shared.  One of the was Condor Trek which runs about 23 minutes and Save The Whale which is about 18 minutes in length.  Each one of the stories shares an interesting topic that teaches children the importance of the planet!

My kids enjoyed themselves and will play it before bed, especially my 6 y/o son who is big on exercising and building his muscles, but we don't call him Odin McBamBam for nothing...LOL  He liked how he was able to strengthen muscles that he doesn't normally work!!

This DVD is recommended for children 3 thru 8 but I think adults who don't practise yoga would also find benefit from participating.  The moves are easy to do and will give you the basics of a great stretching workout!

4084342,5,B0038ASYTI,"Storyland Yoga is an award-winning children's yoga DVD that uses storytelling to teach yoga poses. There are two stories on the DVD through which children learn about helping endangered species and green living while practicing yoga.

My daughter loves this DVD! She asks me to play it for her just about every day and will mimic the yoga poses to the best of her two year old ability. She especially enjoys doing it with me. We giggled and played together and had a blast the first time we tried it out! My husband has even done some of it with her. It's definitely a fun family activity and is a great alternative to active play when the weather forces you to be inside, or any time really. She also enjoys the cute stories and I appreciate the positive earth-friendly messages they convey.

4084343,5,B0038ASYTI,Got this from the public library for my 6 year old. It actually worked. He did the yoga postures and the stories held his attention. I've tried to get him to do it as I'm a yoga instructor myself but have not had much success. Teaching kids is a challenge and this video somehow struck a chord with him. He has been doing it everyday for the past few days. The novelty will probably wear off soon but it's still great that it gotten him interested and hopefully planted the seed to make it a more regular part of his life as he grows up.,1317168000,2,537,4.123809523809523
4084344,5,B0038ASYTI,My 5 year old son loves this video!  We have some other yoga videos for kids which he will do sometimes at my suggestion but he asks for this regularly.  Great for when things are getting too crazy at our house.,1315526400,,211,4.121951219512195
4084345,5,B0038ASYTI,"I bought this as a fun way for our son to get some exercise on cold and windy days in Alaska.  This was a great video that didn't ""hype"" him up, but gave him a good work out.  He seemed to concentrate very well with the instructor and they kept his interest.",1312588800,,258,3.9423076923076925
4084346,3,B0038ASYTI,"I recently purchased the Storyland Yoga DVD for my children- ages 4 and 2. We live in AbuDhabi, so I need something to keep them active while inside. It is far too hot in the summer here! From my perspective, there is not enough instruction for the poses. The storytelling is disjointed, sometimes cutting away to Ahmed- the instructor, and sometimes Ahmed is portraying more than one character in the story. However, my kids do enjoy it and they get a bit of exercise out of it. So, it gets three stars instead of 2. During the course of each story, the kids and Ahmed meet a variety of animals and do various poses to imitate the animals. At the conclusion they put all these poses together to do a sun salutation. In the condor story there is a wizard in the end and at the end of the whale story there is a mermaid. I wish I'd known that before purchasing.",1307836800,3,860,4.314814814814815
4084347,5,B0038ASYTI,"My 3-year-old does this DVD with me and she really likes it. Although her attention span wanes somewhere around the middle of the story, it's still good for her to be exposed to the poses because I want to share my love of yoga with her for the future. She already knows several poses like 'tree', 'snake', and 'dog' and is very proud of her ability to do them! I think that a class is the best for learning because anything on TV will lead to a somewhat passive experience because they don't have the direct motivation to follow along as they would in a class with other kids and a teacher encouraging involvement versus just my gentle coaxing, but this is definitely the next best thing.

The DVD comes in a cardboard sleeve, so you might consider putting it in a ziplock bag to protect it from scratching.

Ahmed does a fantastic job narrating two wonderful stories - 1)Condor Trek (23:10 min) and 2) Save the Whale (18:30). Condor Trek tells the story of condor eggs that need to brought back to their mommy. The kids are imaginatively lead to the river in a kayak and meet up with a crocodile and a snake where they do 'plank' and 'cobra' poses to disguise themselves in order to pass by undetected. They see a bear, mountain lion, and wolves and learn 'bear', 'cat', and 'downward-facing dog' poses. They end by doing a sun saluation that reintroduces all the poses they learned before and take a solar-powered spaceship ride to the top of sun mountain where they lay in 'corpse' or 'relaxation' pose (savatsana) and allow the mommy condor to take the eggs back. There is more to this program, but this is the gist of it.

I haven't gone through the second program in depth yet to detail it, but they learn different poses like 'boat' and 'warrior' on their imaginary surfboard. These programs keep kids (maybe 4-6 and up years of age) engaged through Ahmed's enthusiasm for his animal stories and love of yoga, children, and the planet. Highly recommended for parents wanting to introduce a lifelong love of yoga to their children!",1306368000,2,2038,4.593406593406593
4084348,5,B0038ASYTI,"This is a wonderful DVD, I wish it was part of a series. Through this video my 2-year old and 3-year old are learning about yoga and how to move their bodies, while also gaining awareness of the world around them and nature through the storyline. The first time they saw it they simply watched and absorbed it, now they clamor for me to put on the DVD, roll out their kiddie yoga mats, and try all the moves. My 2-year often does yoga moves on her own now as well, exclaiming ""yoga!"" as she stands in tree pose and breathes deeply :) My kids are on the younger side for the video but love it. And it's fun for me join them as well! Definitely recommend it, wish I could find more DVDs like this.",1301961600,,695,4.117647058823529
4084349,2,B0038ASYTI,"The DVD goes through a stereotypical ""hippy-ish"" story telling about animals with random pictures inserted at random times...there are no yoga poses. My son, 6, had no interest in the story and wanted to actually do the yoga, but there was none so he got sick of the meaningless story right away, as did I. Maybe, MAYBE, younger children might find the story endearing but don't expect this to be a kids ""workout"" video because it is not!",1300147200,11,438,4.628205128205129
4084350,5,B0038ASYTI,"I wasn't sure what to expect with this Storyland Yoga DVD. A lot of yoga videos I've seen have either been really boring, too hard, or waaayy too out there to even take it seriously. With it being a kids Yoga DVD I was even more curious.
We picked the ""Save the Whale"" workout video. There are several kids on the video sitting on the beach with their adult instructor, Ahmed Fahmy. They start out pretending to take a car ride to the beach with their electric cars. Ahmed Fahmy was very easy to listen to and the whole workout was easy and fun enough to keep Lee interested through out. You could also tell she was getting a great workout. I even got into it with her.
Instead of using yoga terms Ahmed Fahmy used visual words like, surfing and swimming to help the child know what move to do next. There are also cartoon visuals to see the whale, mermaid and the beach allowing the child's imagination to soar even more.
I LOVE this video. I love that it teaches to be kind to our planet, it teaches my kids healthy living and as a bonus the DVD comes in a cardboard case making it environment friendly. This video is not only for your child but you can enjoy it too.

4084351,5,B0038ASYTI,"I bought this for my 2 1/2 year old for Christmas since she was always trying to do yoga with us.  She loves it.  She follows along and does the moves and at times even wants to do both of the stories.  Don't watch this without your little one, because it is seriously cheesy, but whatever Ahmed is doing really works to entertain and involve children.  I've also used this in a preschool class with children with developmental disabilities and motor impairments and they were just as enthusiastic.  They needed more hands on assistance to do the movements but it was great for motor planning and stretching.  It is even a good stretch for me when I join.",1298073600,,655,4.508474576271187
4084352,5,B0038ASYTI,"My boys are not entirely familiar with yoga, so I was curious to see what they would think of the DVD.  Yoga instructor Fahmy does a great job of engaging the children in the story.  My two boys were immediately focused on the Condor exercise.  They listened intently as Fahmy described how a Condor moves and my six year old understood that he too was supposed to assume the different positions.  My three year old didn't quite understand, but with his older brother performing the moves he too joined.  Fahmy does a beautiful job of storytelling and the delight on the children's faces as he reveals different aspects of the story is adorable.  My three year old loved performing the bicycle move.  I loved the fact that my children were listening to a beautiful story about nature and at the same time exercising.  The yoga moves were seamlessly intertwined into the story, and did not have the traditional feel of yoga at all.  These yoga moves truly are kid friendly.",1297555200,3,972,4.670588235294118

4084354,3,B0038ASYTI,"I bought this DVD for my 4 year old daughter who often tries to do yoga along with me.  I thought it might be fun for her to have her own yoga dvd that is geared towards kids.  While this does have a storyline to help keep the kids interested, it really doesn't focus enough on the yoga.  The instructor tells a strange and disjointed story about saving animals while trying to integrate some actions and poses.  He occasionally takes about 1 second to actually describe the pose, but usually just jumps from pose to pose without much description of what he is doing, and there is rarely even a good camera angle to see what to do.  My daughter followed along with the story but mostly just danced around the living room because she couldn't tell what anyone was doing and by the time she got something going, they were on to a new one!  In the second story, I showed her each pose and described what to do so she could at least try to keep up.  While she generally seemed satisfied, I thought the whole thing was really weird and didn't seem like something she is going to want to do often.  I am surprised by all of the really positive reviews for this DVD.  I might have even given it fewer stars if my daughter hadn't at least enjoyed jumping around and dancing during the story.",1297036800,159,1283,4.3125

4084356,5,B0038ASYTI,"I have a hard time with all the TV kids watch these days, and how parents rely on TV for entertainment for their kids.  My daughter is 20 months old and is a busy bee.  During Football games we do Push-ups with Bucky, and I started to teach her various poses of Yoga to work on balance and such.  I'm not a huge yoga person, just because I am more the running type, but I wanted something that my daughter could instead of camping out in front of the TV learn that physical activity is important.  Although this Yoga DVD says 3 on up, I find that she is catching on very quickly.  We have family time all doing bits of Yoga and I love the story line so we can relate back to the poses of things and animals.  I expected a bit more flow from pose to pose, but after watching it I think they are right on track with the younger kids.  I think we will grow with this DVD and when we get old enough, we will go to our gym that just started offering family yoga to learn the rest. I highly recommend Storyland Yoga, it is getting my daughter started on the right foot with physical activity in her life!",1294963200,5,1098,4.055555555555555

I was a little skeptical at first that my 3 year old's attention would hold out through the entire yoga session--each of the two sessions is about 20 minutes.  I did the yoga alongside him, and, though the story was interesting and cute, he left off following the instructor about 2/3 of the way through.  HOWEVER, about 15 minutes after Save the Whale (the first session) ended  my son asked to watch it again.  So we did it again...and again.  Each time he watched he did more and more of the yoga moves that Ahmed taught. Since then my son requests his yoga DVD everyday!  He now does all of the yoga positions, and has become so good at listening to the instructor and is very proud of himself for it. I love it!  Storyland Yoga is something I can feel totally good about him watching!  What is even better is that I love doing it alongside him! It is wonderful!
