8611819,5,B00F32AVMM,"This a great collection of 12 epic stories on film, some of which are wonderful treasures that you might have missed. Robert Downey is terrific in Restoration which I had never heard of. The Robinson Crusoe film is so way not a remake of the Disney version. Tom & Viv was gripping and disturbing, and I loved Ann Hathaway, James McAvoy and Maggie Smith in Becoming Jane. This collection is really feeding my soul.",1385769600,,413,4.594594594594595
