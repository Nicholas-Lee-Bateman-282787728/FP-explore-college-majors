8227370,5,B000X9LTLW,"If you know who Scott Shaw is, along with his style of film-making (Zen Film-making, which I highly recommend reading up on), then you should dive deep into this one. Zen Film-making is possibly the laziest way of approaching a film with the most pretentious tone added to it, and instead of watching one of Scott Shaw's more feature-length films, I super suggest attempting to digest this one, being at only 39 minutes, including credits time.

Robert Z'Dar is given no script and no direction as he's forced to drive a car in the desert for over 20 minutes. He's pitted against himself, contemplating whether or not he should have agreed on doing this film, via facing off against another Robert Z'Dar, this time in a trench coat. Out of Z'Dar movies I've seen him in, this is by far his hammiest role yet, with nonsensical cuts, terrible music if any, and the thinnest plot stretched all the way out into nothing. This movie is seriously labelled as a ""psychological thriller"". We laughed so hard throughout this feature and it was short enough to keep our attention. Big plus- this is the most quotable movie I've ever experienced considering there are only like 5 lines that Z'Dar kept mumbling to himself the entire time.

If you rent or buy this movie, I suggest grabbing a group of friends and a fridge full of beer and liquor. This movie will make a great movie night and will surely top a lot of other b-movies you may have on your shelf already.",1506470400,,1456,4.596153846153846
8227371,1,B000X9LTLW,"Well well well, where do I start? Is it possible this is the absolute worst movie ever made in the history of film-making? If you have a crush on Robert Z'Dar's giant face, than I suggest you pick it up, cause that's all you look at throughout the damned movie. Do you like the inside of a car? Have you ever driven somewhere and thought damn this is boring? Have you ever wanted to watch someone else driving in a car for a long time? If you said yes to any of these, than pick up this over priced, piece of crap immediately. If 2 people buy this DVD, I think the full movie's budget has been paid for. This movie is supposedly a 'psychological thriller' about a man who made the 'biggest score of his life' and you hear that quote too many times. Robert Z'dar supposedly runs into many detours, roadblocks, people tailgating and random people on the side the street, and yet all you ever see, is Robert Z'Dar talk about it. I think there is a total of 10 camera angles in this whole movie. His face takes up 90% of the screen for the first 75% of the movie. Here's the cast of the movie: Robert Z'Dar - Himself and himself, Gas station attendant, horse, and a cameo by the boom microphone. There is a very high likelihood that this movie was shot using a camcorder. You can often see how shaky the camera man is as he is seated next to Z'dar while he drives on a straight road constantly. The microphone also makes a guest appearance many times during the driving scene. I've met Robert Z'dar and he said he was paid $500 for this film, honestly... I think he was over-paid. We should mail him and the director of this movie a plaque for making the worst movie we've ever seen. I've never experienced a 40 minute film feel like 3 hours before. I must give a warning to anyone daring to watch this, don't watch if you're suicidal... as you will ultimately, kill yourself. Even a jolly fellow like myself, contemplated hanging myself from the rafters of a building after perhaps 15 minutes of watching. Robert Z'dar's face haunted me in my dreams for a good few weeks at least... Its larger than tires on my car. Just look at the front cover. There is a total of 3 different scenes in this movie... Driving on a road not doing any turns but he sure talks about it a lot, him getting gas, and him walking around a farm opening fire on nothing. Don't be fooled by the cover, Robert Z'dar kills nothing although he mysteriously dies at the end for no apparent reason. I know I spoiled the end, but trust me you don't want to waste $25 on this movie unless you want play a prank on a friend that you've tied to a chair... Tell him ""hey I got this great movie, but its like two hours long! Its an action packed psychological thriller!"". If you enjoyed Samurai Cop, don't buy this... I was fooled by that movie.",1266019200,11,2805,4.29433962264151
