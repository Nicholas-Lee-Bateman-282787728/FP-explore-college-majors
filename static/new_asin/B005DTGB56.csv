4661840,5,B005DTGB56,I grew up with this series and to see it this clear bring some good memories back. This was a blast!,1385942400,3,100,3.8095238095238093
4661841,2,B005DTGB56,"A lackluster space filler in between the 1st and the 3rd Robotech Wars.  Unlike the others which had full stories with many characters and real dimension to them, this one is just all about Dana and how she always is so gung ho for battle and her motley crew of followers.  No real drama and frankly, Dana is just not that likeable.",1385596800,,332,4.338709677419355
4661842,5,B005DTGB56,"Classic anime, originally titled 'Super Dimension Calvary Southern Cross', second installment of Robotech series used by Harmony Gold. Must have for anime fans, gotta know where you came from to know where your going.",1384128000,4,217,5.411764705882353

4661848,3,B005DTGB56,"I've been a fan of Robotech since the Macross saga debuted on Cartoon Network's ""Toonami"" block back in the 90's, and while Macross was excellent and introduced the viewer to the exciting world of Robotech there were so many possibilities for the ""Robotech Masters"", however those expectations feel flat after three episodes. Macross left off with Rick and Lisa standing in-front of the now-destroyed SDF1 (with MinMay singing in the backround) leads the viewer into thinking what's next.. what will happened to both Lisa and Rick. The first episode ""Dana's Story"" is a rehash of the important events of the Macross saga which leads into the new fight between the new generation of defenders of earth. This is my own opinion, but this season just felt rushed with no obviously story plot. The Mecca that is introduced seem to be bloated pieces of technology not as agile or cool like the Veratechs in the previous saga, Dana herself seems to be a wimpy school-girl who is loud and has an annoying voice, and not even a mention of Rick or Lisa.. (although you can gather that they poured the resources in creating the SDF3.. but it really isn't clear)

At the end of ""The Robotech Masters"" everything comes to together, quickly to end the season. Granted if you are a fan of the show I would recommend this since it's the natural progression into the History of Robotech, but don't expect much in terms of enjoyment.",1330992000,3,1415,4.752032520325203
4661849,5,B005DTGB56,"Just like I remember it. Everytime I watch it, I remember my childhood. The story is great. It, of course, sets it up for the third series.",1430265600,,139,4.185185185185185
4661850,5,B005DTGB56,Perfect exactly what I ordered,1426032000,,30,5.2
4661851,3,B005DTGB56,Not the best of the 3 Sagas. The last 10 chapters are good but the rest really bored.,1411430400,,85,3.7777777777777777

4661854,5,B005DTGB56,"I had first been exposed to the Robotech Saga back in the eighties, and followed it though later on I became a fan of the Macross series. I wasn't that big a fan of the SDF-1 series, the first series in Robotech, but when I saw the Master's Saga I liked the series more. I've been trying to find the Macross series, Super Dimensional Southern Cavalry, but even on Amazon it's sold out. I settled for the Master's Saga and it hasn't been a disappointment.",1402876800,3,454,4.352941176470588
4661855,5,B005DTGB56,Big Robotech fan since I first saw it on Channel 11 here in Washington State. This second series of the Robotech was kinda mystery to me how man kind couldn't knock on the door and ask you new here in the area? But wouldn't that kind on show then! Delivery was on time. Willing to business again with them.,1398643200,,306,4.203389830508475
4661856,4,B005DTGB56,"I watched the original airing and I have watched the previous video releases. I think the minor sound effects changes are worth it because they don't take away from the story in any way, it just sounds better to me. I own all three wars and they are awsome, without all the repetitiveness of some of the movies that just reshow old fotage you've already seen in the series. The second war is alitte slow and focuses on a small group of people and doesn't give you much in the overall story of roboculture, but it is still a big part of the series, at the amazon price it's soo worth it!",1397347200,,586,4.241071428571429
4661857,4,B005DTGB56,"Great cartoon! Highly recommend this series! Thanks again! The Robotech series is a great series as a whole; however the Masters Saga lacks the punch that the Macros Saga and the New Generation had. It is a little slow in the beginning, but it picks up in the middle. B-",1394236800,5,270,4.42
4661858,4,B005DTGB56,Some things are still enjoyed and don't need to be a kid to let your imagination roam.  Robotech was alot of fun for me as a child and was the first anime type cartoons I liked!,1386288000,5,177,3.9166666666666665
