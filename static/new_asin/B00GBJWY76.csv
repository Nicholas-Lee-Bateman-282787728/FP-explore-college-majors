6070030,3,B00GBJWY76,"I was under the impression that these were super zombies or something, but I didn't get that feeling watching this film.  Though they did bradish weapons and move quicker than most zombies, I felt that the level of gore that something of this magnitude could generate was certainly lacking in this film.  Promising start, yet it just falls flat towards the end.  What a cop out of an ending also, but it's in stride with the direction the film was taking anyway.  However, if you are a fan of zombie films, add this one to your collection.  It's unique in a dumb kind of way.  The interview with the director is very interesting.",1070409600,,629,4.522123893805309
6070031,4,B00GBJWY76,"I don't think this was intended to be another Zombie film.  Lenzi wanted to get a little more creative with the whole zombie aspect, and this is what we got.  This could have been a great classic.  I mean, the idea is pretty cool.  A super-human, radioactive, gun welding, bloodthirsty army of men that have a fuzzy growth on their faces.  If you don't find that entertaining, you will at least find it humorous.  That's the way I look at this one.  I mostly watch it for laughs.  I guess I'm just trying to say that Lenzi could have had a good thing going with this one, but he didn't quite hit the target.  I think the only way folks can appreciate this is for laughs.  Zombie fans will be disappointed from the strange make up and the overall energy of the ""monsters,"" and gore fiends probably won't be too impressed, seeing as how the special effects are pretty bad compared to those of Fulci or Romero.  I'd hate to say this, but if you like bad movies because they are so bad, you should definately check this out.  That is the best way I can describe this movie to those who haven't seen it.",1063843200,,1098,4.302439024390244
6070032,3,B00GBJWY76,"I first heard about Nightmare City in Rue Morgue magazine, and was intrigued by the descriptions so I bought it. While not one of the best zombie movies, NC is quite entertaining and a break from the usual ""stagger around aimlessly for brains"" zombie protocol. These zombies run, shoot guns, and know kung-fu! They also seem to have covered their faces in week-old quiche, but that's not the point. As always, the dialogue is laughable and the dubbing is even worse, but fans of these movies know that already. Horror fans are also notoriously schizo about their movie collections, so Nightmare City has a good chance of being added to many.",1060560000,,641,4.783783783783784
6070033,5,B00GBJWY76,"How many zombie movies do you see where zombies use machine guns and signal each other to advance? Not many, except this classic from the italian horror genre. Not at all scary, but very enjoyable. More like a city of lunatics really. But like i said before, five stars for originality. Not bad at all, just not a real gore fest zombie tale, so zombie fans be warned. However if you want a good laugh and interesting story check it out!  the VHS version is titled ""City of the walking dead"" but i haven't seen it so I don't know if it's an edited version.  Stick with the DVD",1047945600,,575,4.26605504587156
6070034,3,B00GBJWY76,"This movie is absolutely hilarious. For one, the make-up on the zombies is SO poor. They don't put make-up around the eyes, and so the zombies end up just looking like guys wearing hamburger meat masks. Secondly, the zombies run around and use weapons! Sorry, but these types of zombies only work well when done comedically (i.e. Return of the Living Dead). The throat slashings also look incredibly fake. Nonetheless, this film is great fun in all its cheesiness. It has plenty of gore, even if it doesn't near Fulci quality. The only gore that really impressed me was an awesome scene where a girl gets her breast cut open by a zombie, who then scoops out the contents and eats! The classic Lenzi breast torture (see Cannibal Ferox) is in full swing here! If you want a good gory laugh, check this out. If you wanna see Lenzi at his best though, go for Cannibal Ferox.",1046217600,,870,4.547770700636943
6070035,5,B00GBJWY76,"Dawn of the Dead is my first favorite in case you're wondering (which you probably aren't).  This film is my second favorite for one reason.  It's fun.  Very fun in fact.  It's also mindless.  Lenzi knew when he started the project that it was a mess.  But he turned it into an enjoyable mess at that.  This is miles above that inane drivel he made known as Cannibal Ferox.  As for the DVD, the transfer is practically flawless, the menu is fun to watch in itself, and the extras of a trailer, bio, and interview with Lenzi himself are all quite entertaining.  Kudos to Anchor Bay for this release, I've been waiting some time for it.",1045267200,2,634,4.396551724137931
6070036,4,B00GBJWY76,"Lenzi has created an exploitation film to remember. Random violence permeates this zombie epic.  Simple plot, but much action for your little peepers to indulge. My main disappointments with this movie were: there were no intestines unravelled (one scene came close, but they cut out to the next scene before we could see the visceral victuals), the ending was one of those ""OH,IT WAS ALL A DREAM"" sort of cop-outs, and the neck slashing scenes were rather weak and unconvincing--a simple line of red just doesn't get me off anymore.  The boobage was fair and supple. As a late adolescent man, I can still appreciate it.  The zombies talked, but it didn't make the movie goofy like RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD.  This movie is best watched with a person who doesn't like zombie films--such as my girlfriend.  True zombie fans, pay up and enjoy, those who like movies like RESIDENT EVIL, eat it and go somewhere else.",1041897600,,913,4.753164556962025
6070037,4,B00GBJWY76,"Ah, yes, Nightmare city.  If you're reading this review, you have most likely been exposed to the whole Italian horror genre.  Therefore, I'm sure you know what to expect of this film.  There are practically no ways to defend this film in any sense, but I thought it was quite fun.  Anyway, most film snobs will never understand why we like these movies, and it's impossible to explain why we do.  It's like that Apple Jacks commercial:  ""Then why do you like them?""  ""Well, we just do"". I think it's a worthy addition to that Italian horror dvd collection you must have going.  The featurette with Lenzi is interesting.  He really goes all out on explaining the ""message"" behind this movie.  Message?  I don't think we watch mutated undead zombie-like things hack people into hamburger for any kind of reason or message other than amusement.  Oh, well, I guess it could be me that's missing the point.",1037836800,2,902,4.67515923566879

Despite any faults this movie may have in other people's minds I love this movie and find so much to enjoy.  The BD release is the best the film has ever looked, but there can be many improvements in the PQ quality.

6070040,4,B00GBJWY76,"Incubo Sulla Citta Contaminata is a 1980 Italian/Spanish pseudo zombie flick directed by Umberto Lenzi.
Nightmare City is also known as City of the Walking Dead.  The plot is sparse, it deals with a military plane landing at an airport and unloading a cargo of deformed people suffering from radiation sickness.  The movie never states where these crazed beings came from or how they came to be in this condition.  They simply start killing everyone and drinking their blood.  A local reporter (Hugo Stiglitz) witnesses the attack and tries desperately to warn people about what's happening.  He's stopped by an stupid general (Mel Ferrer) who believes they can contain the problem quickly and quietly.  The news blackout he imposes only serves to aid the marauding ghouls in their quest to kill everyone they can and drink them dry.  The story features several couples trying to survive the attack.

Director Umberto Lenzi did not consider this a `zombie' movie.  He was more interested in promoting it as an anti-nuclear and anti-military film.

The lack of a story actually helps this movie, making it an aimless series of carnage.  By today's standards the makeup is too mask-like and cumbersome to be mistaken for burned flesh.  The bloodshed is unconvincing.  The level of acting is cringe worthy.  It's clumsy and seemingly without a message/point, no matter how hard Lenzi tried to inject some significance into this festival of slaughter.  In its day it might have seemed lurid but by today's standards it's just another run-of-the-mill horror flick featuring multipurpose zombie-like creatures running amuck.
I give it a lot of points for sheer gall and audacity.  It's a keeper!",1423699200,,1689,5.087272727272727
6070041,1,B00GBJWY76,"What a rip off. I won't give any spoilers but lets just say the plot is 'cyclical"".  I saw this as a kid in the 1980s  at a rundown theatre on NYC's 42nd street under a different title & with hilariously badly dubbed dialogue. The print was badly scratched & missing a reel which actually made this turd better, especially when it was screened with an audience made up primarily of crackheads, perverts, winos, hookers and kids ditching school for the day like me. It was shown on a triple bill with ""Driller Killer"" and a kung fu flick. Under those circumstances--& perhaps at a drive in--the movie is tolerable but I dare you to stay awake while watching it at home.",1422316800,,668,4.467213114754099

6070043,5,B00GBJWY76,"One of my favorite bad movies, this has everything: bad acting, ridiculous story, and nudity.  I get so sick of reading that ""28 Days Later"" invented fast zombies; this film did it twenty years earlier!  Not only fast, but zombies capable of flying planes, shooting machine guns and so much more.  Expect the worst and enjoy.",1416614400,,325,4.767857142857143
6070044,4,B00GBJWY76,"FILM:

Umberto Lenzi's stab at linking DAWN OF THE DEAD, THE CHINA SYNDROME, and THE CRAZIES together into a cohesive film about running murderous radiation victims taking over a city is unsuccessful in almost every area aside from creating some laughable entertainment.  The acting, dubbing, writing, editing, character logic, and special effects are almost universally without merit.  Actors often just stand there and do nothing as some horrible zombie lurches at them brandishing some kind of weapon, and react even less realistically once unceremoniously killed.  Actually come to think about it, some type of kill / gore special effects wizardry is a large part of what makes films in this genre work, and here they didn't even try.

There are moments that shine through and transcend the low budget and poor efforts on behalf of the crew.  For one thing the film does succeed in the atmosphere department, creating a feeling of increasing dread and isolation aided immensely by Stelvio Cipriani's musical score and some nice little touches by Lenzi here and there.  Some of these atmospheric touches make of course more sense than others, such as the subplot involving Major Rabal's stay-at-home artist housewife encountering self-propelled lawnmowers and self-stabbing sculptures.

BLU-RAY:

This is about as good as this film can ever expect to look and sound.  I'm a little confused as to why one would want this though as the increased resolution quality of course exposes a lot of inconsistency in the filmstock and that a lot of the night scenes were significantly ""pushed"" and grainy.  Oddly for this very ""B"" film the disc presents this film as more of a classic foreign film, plastering Lenzi's name all over the box and making Italian language with English subtitles the default, even though a lot of the actors (including Mexican lead Hugo Stiglitz) were obviously speaking English the whole time.  Nicely the disc also includes the English language track with all the same dubbing voices you've come to love, as well as a possibly overlong video interview with Lenzi which was also on the R2 Italian Disc from 2000.  Unfortunately it is missing the commentary that that disc had, which featured a lot of Lenzi's bizarre speech patterns and limited grasp of the English language and was about half the word ""eeehhhhhh..."".  The Blue Underground DVD had a much better-shot and better-edited interview with Lenzi which was much more entertaining and informative at 1/4 the running time.",1401926400,2,2502,5.115479115479116

6070046,4,B00GBJWY76,This is one that I will always love. It's got it all. And it keeps you interested the entire time. However this is not a zombie movie. Although it was marketed ad one in the U.S. City of the walking dead. It's more along the lines of 28 Days later. Radioactive mutant supermen!

6070047,5,B00GBJWY76,"No, not a good movie. Not at all. Yet, I enjoy watching it every once in a while. It's a classic ""guilty pleasure.""

Suffice it to say that I was more interested in the film! This is an eerie tale that has all the strange effects of that cheap Italian genre: diabolical and weird zombie make-up, excess gore, naked women, humans vs zombies, etc. I couldn't get enough of this and the ending even had a few surprises. I want to find this again to rent it! It is fun for all.",1390780800,,483,4.148936170212766
6070049,5,B00GBJWY76,"My copy of Nightmare City (Blu Ray) arrived today
and I'm actually very surprised by the HQ of this BR out of the box
Die hard Horror fans of Scream Factory and there second folder cover will understand this
It comes with this ""Old School"" BR Cover then when you pull it out you get the Classic NC Cover

I have never heard of RaroVideo but, I'm very impressed with the over all look of the BR
The price is a tad high for a BR but, I Love this film

What you get with the BR:
**New HD Transfer
***DTS-HD 2.0 & Audio Linear PCM 2.0 Audio***
**An Interview with Director Umbero Lenzi almost 50min long (Very Cool)
*Original English Trailer 3:45min.
Original Italian trailer 3:45
***A Fully Illustrated booklet on the genesis and production of the film by Chris Alexander (Fangoria Magazine)
**Digitally restored New and Improved English subtitle translation

The Film is hands down on of the most unique Zombie Films ever  (Even though in a previous interview with Umberto Lenzi he states its a Italian Vampire Film)
Whatever you wanna see it as it's just a fun cleaver Horror Film
With fast running Zombies  way before Return of the Living Dead & 28 Days Later
One of the coolest Scenes shoot at a amusement park with tension and drama
Even the ending is so Not Hollywood is screams Italian Horror which is a great thing
The less you know about it the better

If you are a fan of Italian splatter check it out on dvd then decide if you wanna see it in HD
It's a under appreciated horror film I'm still shocked it somehow got a BR version
It's on par with Romero & Fulci Zombie Films 9.5/10

Update 1-5-2014:  After watching the BR I wanted to just throw-out my over all thoughts on the purchase
I pre-ordered it 3months ago payed a kind of high price but, it was worth it
The HD Transfer is very nice (you will never see this film look this crisp and clean) the studio who did this did a Great Job! Twilight Time could learn a thing or two about the right way to Transfer Film to HD from this small Indie Company
The Audio is 8/10  (It's better to watch the film with the original Italian Language track with English subtitles IMO
The Umbero Lenzi Interview is interesting it was conducted in 2000 (Never seen it so it was cool) Keep in mind the audio is crumby (turn it up and listen good his English isn't his first language
The booklet inside the case is very cool
My only major c/o is lack of any Major Special Features (It would've been cool to get a Audio Commentary by anybody!!!
Quentin Tarantino loves this film it would've been a Huge financial draw if they got him to do a commentary track
If he really loves this film I think he would've if he wasn't busy with a film
I'm really not sure how this got a BR release still (I'm happy to have it though)
Cause it has a cult following but, it's not massive like other underground horror films
That might just be why the price tag is so high for it
If you are a Huge fan of Umbero Lenzi  you'll want to add this to your collection.
I could without a doubt see this being out of print in a less then a year then selling on Amazon and eBay for a insane asking price!
If you do enjoy Nightmare City I Highly recommended Lenzi's rarely seen 1991 Black Demons  it's also very under-rated and rarely even viewed until the start of the dvd crazy of the early 2000's

UPDATE 8-22-2015  2 moths ago I discovered that the great UK Distributor Arrow Video was putting out a Strong Collector Edition of
Nightmare City but, you can not order in through Amazon.uk.co  (which is odd I've bought a great number of Import BR's from there UK Site)
but, you can get the BR direct from ArrowVideo.com
after looking at all the great extras I had to bite! After the street date was bumped-up a week (not sure why?) It was released my copy arrived within 6 days royal air male
This is without a doubt the version to add to any collection
The Arrow Video is (Region Free) A,B,C
here's the run-down of all the exclusive extras that make this a real must own for hardcore horror fans

The Arrow Video version is hands down the Ultimate/Collectors Edition of City of the Walking Dead aka Nightmare City to own
It's also less then $20.00 US

with the upcoming Re-Make of Nightmare City (2016) I can bank this film will gain more respect and love after that train wreck comes out
Even though  Tom Savini is directing it something about it don't add up (you can see two work-up Posters for the remake on IMDB one looks kind of cool but, to much like a Transformers Poster the Other is a Complete rip-off from Romero's The Crazies

6070050,4,B00GBJWY76,"I Saw this as a kid and it really scared me back then. WHen I bought this on dvd, I couldn't remember much other than the fact that it was really gory. This time around after seeing it i found it to be an enetertaining hoot. This film has people who have been exposed to some kind of radiation that turns them into blood sucking, fast, weapon wielding maniacs. They are not zombies, the are not decaying living dead. This film is by Lenzi, and I really enjoyed this absolutlely CHEEEZY film. for some reason when hugo stiglits wife goes in the dark hospital room to get blood (I forget) and the lights have been cut off and the old lady pops up I was kinda creeped out. Just imagine being in that situtation with those crazies on the loose. id probably find a closet, lock it and sit in there as quiet as I can. These guys are sadistic, fast, they communicate and if your caught by a group of them you're in for a nasty death. Most of the audience these days my age (26) will probably think this is absolute trash. I find it a guilty pleasure however and recommend it to horror fans.",1383955200,3,1083,4.236714975845411
6070051,4,B00GBJWY76,"This movie is one you either love or hate and I love it but I can't really tell you why. It's a zombie movie so the story line is pretty much pointless, it's the same with every one, dead people kill living people, the end. I think this was probably one of the first zombie movies to have fast moving zombies and intelligent ones at that. So that I'm sure for some people is a turn off, it usually is for me. Typically I hate ""sprinter"" zombie movies but there's just something about this one. My guess is it's just so damn bad that it's good. The dubbing isn't the greatest but it's nothing like 'Hell of the Living Dead' and the acting is brutal, as it always is in most of these early zombie movies. I'd rented this on VHS ages ago and was pretty damn excited to see it was on DVD since I could only remember bits and pieces from it. If you're a true zombie fan you'll like this one.",1372032000,,886,4.097701149425287
6070052,3,B00GBJWY76,"Sure, it's cheap and aweful in it's own way, but it's much much better and unintentionally fun than most zombie flicks churned out by no names, these days. So if you've seen most of the classics and want more zombie action, this is not such a bad choice, just don't expect a classic, or anything close to subpar with what you've seen before.",1370649600,,341,4.428571428571429
6070053,3,B00GBJWY76,"Nightmare City(1980) is a ""fun"" science fiction horror film from director Umberto Lenzi. It's just as action packed and fast paced as any Hollywood blockbuster. The Italian title means ""The Incubation of a Contaminated City"". The film is packed with blood and guts...and topless women! A radiation leak turns human beings into zombies that can run, stab people, shoot guns, fly planes, and drink blood. Mexican actor Hugo Stiglitz plays the film's hero. The director wanted Franco Nero to play the same role. The film has a funky disco-synth music score. Nightmare City has plenty of gross out moments. A man's arm gets blown off by a machine gun! A female dancer's head gets cut open with an axe! A pretty, nubile Italian woman's eye gets pulled out by zombies! Lenzi may have been trying to compete with a similar scene from Zombi 2(1979). There's zombies in this film, but Nightmare City(1980) is closer in spirit to George Romero's The Crazies(1974). Nightmare City is a grindhouse film that delivers what you expect. It also has a ""clever ending"". Nightmare City is a real guilty pleasure.",1366416000,2,1094,4.918918918918919
6070054,4,B00GBJWY76,"HAHA! Umberto Lenzi's ""Nightmare City"" (1980) is unlike any zombie film you've ever seen.
It's full of blood, guts, gore, gratuitous nudity, hilarious acting, terrible dubbing, and a trite storyline. All of these aspects are typical of the late 70's/early 80's, cheesy, Italian Zombie flicks.
But Lenzi's zombies are not your typical slow moving, stammering, slumbering, stuttering, stupid zomibes. Lenzi's zombies are rabid, fast paced, knife toting, axe wielding, gun blasting, smart sprinting, ass kicking zombies who engage in an all out, free for all, battle royal against the human race. Zombies that are hungry for the kill, rather than brains.

As always, Blue Underground does a magnificent job of widescreen transfer, with crystal clear pitcure, and terrific sound.
So, if you're fan of the late 70's/early 80's cheesy, Italian, zombie flicks, grab yourself a couple of bags of chips, pop open a cold brew, press play, sit back ,and get ready to enjoy the silliness, and sleazyness, that is ""Nightmare City""!",1359072000,,1018,5.283950617283951
6070055,5,B00GBJWY76,"This was a different kind of ""Zombie"" movie.  A lot of Zombie movies today are the fast moving kind, so I think today's Zombie films should pay respect to this movie. To keep it short, these are not the dead coming out of the ground and slowly moving to seek victims for flesh. These are people exposed to radiation and somehow turn into crazy, knife wielding living dead. This movie could have used more atmosphere and some better acting, but it is what it is. Its still better than anything from Bruno Mattai(sp)",1353888000,,514,4.526881720430108
6070056,3,B00GBJWY76,"OK so im not going to dwell on aspects of this movie that haven't been touched by other reviewers. In essence this is the cheesiest zombie movie you will ever see. The concept is pretty original and interesting a plane lands with infected people that have been turned them into zombies. What is cool about these zombies is that they don't bite or rip your flesh off. Instead, check this out, THEY KICK YOU ASS. That's right they use anything in hand to inflict physical harm on humans. One even uses martial arts to surmount his prey. Now why they do this, isn't ever really revealed in this movie. But it becomes fun after awhile. The makeup effect are decent not the best but it survives as a horror movie. I would buy this movie just because its genere but Id enjoy because of its retro and cheesey unique approach to the zombie culture.",1318204800,,840,4.461038961038961
6070057,5,B00GBJWY76,"All of the product details and customer reviews seems to be just off of the mark. This is not just another zombie film, because there are no zombies/undead but rather a population of contaminated humans who spread the illness. There is clearly a differing level of contamination in the humans, for some bear hideous deformations and others seemingly have nothing wrong with them at all. The sick all move and act with normal human qualities, and we see these monsters with everything from sticks to semi-automatic weapons. Take the time and watch the Umberto Lenzi commentary in the extras portion of the menu to further understand the ingenuity of this film.",1258588800,,659,4.945945945945946

You just have to love the wax molding and red corn syrup special effects they used back in the day(excessively,I might add in this one).If you like gore in abundance with your violence,gratuitous nudity and laughable english dubbing then you will have fun with this one. Over the top cheeziness,perhaps overkill but in such a great way that any gorehound that can also appreciate sleaze will need to have in their collection. Perhaps the epitome of the aforementioned traits that make a grade A primo schlock horror. Picture quality is good too in the transfer to DVD.",1229731200,,705,4.8264462809917354
6070059,3,B00GBJWY76,"This is a movie you either like or hate.  It's a bloodbath of radioactively infected people who attack and slaughter people for their blood.  One thing that is very different here and not explained really is that there is a infection spreading from the zombies and not everyone they kill rises from the dead.  Most victims just seem to get murdered and then stay dead.  So it seems that the infected rot away and attack while the people they kill stay dead.  but the infected can't be killed by any thing but fire or a bullet to the head.  This is NOT the worst zombie movie ever made , they spent some money on this one.  There are zombie movies out there that they filmed with a hand camera using vhs tape!
anyways I thought this movie was a good gore fest from the wonderful early 80's a time of a explosion of europeon and american horror as a powerful force.  Italian horror is almost extinct these days.  Anyways if you like zombie movies you can do alot worse than this one. This one is directed by the good italian director umberto lenzi and that's another plus for this flick.",1221609600,,1085,4.385
6070060,1,B00GBJWY76,"A radioactive spill contaminates people at some nuclear plant, somehow they all get on board some plane which lands in the city which then gets invaded by them. The rest of the story follows a reporter who's trying to escape from the city with his wife. There's almost no character development so you never really connect with these characters.

There's an interview with the director Umberto Lenzi, he comes across as conceited with a touch of inferiority complex. He gets all defensive and talks about how great his special effects are and how ""Americans"" are jealous of his creativity. He also complains about problems with his producer and then specifically mentions she was a woman, I don't know why he would do that other than for sexist reasons.

Nightmare City is just one of those movies that uses lots of gore to try to scare people, but imo its too fake looking to have that effect. If you want to watch zombie movies with better stories I suggest Night of the Living Dead and The Last Man On Earth.",1214611200,,1010,4.636871508379889

6070062,4,B00GBJWY76,"Incubo sulla citt contaminata (a.k.a. Nightmare City - 1980) is the latest film I've seen in my attempt to review every zombie/vampire/undead movie.  Nightmare City is one of the better and more enjoyable of the ""bad"" Zombie flicks.  The basic story is that a reporter and his nurse wife trying to survive a Zombie attack in their city.  Meanwhile, a bunch of generals stand around a room full of blippy computers and other military guys fly around in a helicopter while people are getting killed all over the city.  At this time I am not very familiar with Umberto Lenzi compared to the other Giallo directors (Fulci, Argento, etc.), but after seeing this movie I'm curious to look into his other work.

What strain of zombie are these that attack the Nightmare City?  These are radioactive zombies that range from having a few scabs to having full facial masks that make them look like an army of Toxic Avengers.  They're fast moving zombies; but, of course, they suddenly become the slow and lumbering zombies when they're after the protagonists. These zombies are also weapon wielding, organized, and well planned murderers.  They really like to drink the blood, and only a head shot will kill them.  They can solve problems, but (fortunately) can't talk.  I give them a high zombie score of 8/10.

There is a fare share of the required zombie film gratuitous sexism and nudity.  It starts with a 20-something women getting groped by a creepy guy three times her age.  For some reason, several minutes of the movie is taken up by watching a television production of girls dancing in leotards to dentist office ""muzak"".  It leads to a good (but somewhat illogical) zombie attack, though.  A good way for zombies to kill women seems to involve ripping their shirts open (more on this below).  A gratuitous sexism and nudity score of 7/10.

The gore involves the flow of `red red krovvy'.  There isn't much in the way of guts, but the bright red paint is plentiful.  To make up for the lack of innards, the violence is quite graphic.  It might verge on comical to a more seasoned zombie film fanatic, but I could imagine a more sensitive viewer reacting to the violence in Nightmare City.  I'll admit that there were a few moments where I cringed, and there were also a few moments where I yelled at the TV, ""Awesome!!!"", but I won't spoil those who readers who haven't seen the film.  I'll just say one word: Decapitation.  Being generous (and comparing to other Italian zombie movies from the same era), this movie rates a decent gore/violence score of 8/10.

The movie was a bit slow in the beginning, and had it's slow moments through out; but overall it kept my interest the entire time.  It will definitely be one of those films that will be better viewed with friends who enjoy cheering and jeering at old horror films.  On the boredom scale (0 being insomnia curing, 10 being '78 Dawn of the Dead) Nightmare City gets a 7/10.  That being said, I do think the movie would have been much better if it had ended three minutes before it did.  Instead of going with a depressing ""Night of the Living Dead"" type of ending, they decided to have a total cop-out ending.

The dialogue gets a 5/10 for being pretty standard zombie flick dialog.  +1 for a terrible overdub into English and +1 for the required synthesizer soundtrack (yes, in a zombie film those are plusses).  Overall, especially in comparison to other Gaillo zombie films of the time, Nightmare City gets a solid 8/10 in my Zombie movie scale.

FOR FUN: While watching the movie, I came up with the ""Nightmare City Drinking Game"" (rules and language cleaned up for amazon editors, but feel free to modify).  As mentioned, the zombies in this film have a penchant for ripping open women's clothing whilst in the act of attacking them.  That is only part of the story.  The zombies seem to have three main methods for killing their victims: stabbing people in the neck, biting people in the neck, and (for some reason) stabbing women in the breasts.  So, here's the drinking game.  Every time a person gets stabbed or bitten in the neck, take a swig.  Every time a women gets stabbed in the ""chest"", take a shot.  Every time the reporter's wife starts philosophizing or criticizing modern society, take two shots.  Every time there's an ""awesome"" moment (you'll know them when you see them) take a shot and a swig.  Have fun!",1199836800,,4389,4.662760416666667

On the negative side, the acting is very bad. On the positive side, the concept of fast zombies who also can communicate with each other and have weapons was original and unique in the early 1980's. For this reason, I rate this movie with 4 stars. I took away one star for the awful acting.

6070065,4,B00GBJWY76,"From the scattered and mottled composition of Nightmare City, I have gleaned the following intriguing facts:

(A) Radioactive Zombies are not like ordinary zombies; Radioactive Zombies are capable of piloting planes and wielding weapons of virtually any description.

(B) Radioactive Zombies do not look like ordinary zombies; Radioactive Zombies wear normal clothes, suits and ties, and look like someone dumped large buckets of pigeon excrement all over their heads and faces.

(C) Radioactive Zombies disregard the consumption of human flesh in favor of non-polite exsanguination.

(D) Radioactive Zombies have absolutely no regard for the institution of physical fitness and will brazenly slaughter aerobics instructors in the middle of a television broadcast.

Nightmare City occurs in the wake of some undisclosed radioactive spill, the result of which is a horde of blood-crazed maniacs. The city authorities are waiting for the return of the renowned professor sent to investigate the spill; however, when the professor does return he does so in an unmarked plane with no apparent flight plan. The professor himself leads the initial disgorge of zombies from the plane, attacking the military and airport personnel. AHHHHHH! The zombies prey upon the hapless and stupid humans, stabbing their victims and tearing open their throats to release geysers of spurting blood.

Unfortunately for Nightmare City, the protagonist is a sanctimonious reporter. The reporter flees from the airport massacre to interrupt an apparently very popular aerobics show to report the horrific events via a ""special news flash"" on Channel 5. The news flash is canceled, however, when the watchful military intervenes. The reporter disgustedly resigns his post. Meanwhile, the blood-crazed radioactive zombies have invaded the station and have begun to violently exsanguinate the aerobics instructors. Is nothing sacred?

Even worse than the forced cancellation of everybody's favorite aerobics show, the zombies are spreading their radioactive contagion to their victims. Sweet Jesus, the unthinkable carnage. The reporter manages to reach the local hospital, where he collects his wife and sets out with the intension of raiding for fuel and provisions and ostensibly fleeing Nightmare City; in the process of doing so, however, the reporter and his wife decide to pause for roughly ten minutes while they smugly wax philosophical and self-righteously condemn the race of man for his cruel disregard and technological trespasses. This gives the zombies just enough time to catch up, and the reporter and his wife subsequently lose access to the provisions as well as their vehicle.

At the end of the day, Nightmare City is stupid, disoriented, and lavishly violent, and since those are three qualities that I myself greatly appreciate, I have thenceforth bestowed upon the tangled mess called Nightmare City a rating of 4 stars.",1186876800,20,2916,5.507829977628635

6070069,2,B00GBJWY76,"'Nightmare City' aka 'City of the Walking Dead' aka 'Invasion of the Atomic Zombies' (by far the best title) is pretty much the most reviled film of the European zombie cycle of the early 80's.  I don't think this is entirely fair.  Personally, I think this movie is better than Mattei's 'Hell of the Living Dead'.  But, that ain't much of a prize, and this film is pretty damn lousy.  But, it's still worth seeing if you're a zombie fan.  So, as I always say, if you've even heard of this movie, you'll probably think seeing it is worth your time.

In some ways this film is slightly better than average.  The scenes not involving the zombies are relatively competent, perhaps slightly better than what you'd usually get in this sorta film.  None of the characters are remotely interesting, but the acting is not atrocious, if not good either, and the dialogue is rarely laughable. (Except for Anna's ridiculous, luddite social commentary.  And that's funny due to the content, rather than the delivery.)  The problem with this film is the zombies themselves.  Now,  I'm not a total zombie purist, but I can't call this a real zombie film.  I don't care that they run,  and I don't care that they aren't dead (or maybe they are. I forget.  Don't care either  way.)  The problem is that they always use weapons and tools.  Now, it's one thing to use these items sporadically, but they do it all the damn time.  For the most part, these supposed zombies just run up and stab people.  Not very zombie like.  Furthermore, they just aren't animalistic enough.  The fast zombies in '28 Days Later' and the new 'Dawn of the Dead' were at least wild and out of control.  These ones just seem like murderous people with gunk on their heads.  What it all comes down to is that these zombies are just lame.  They look terrible, with just some ridiculous lumpy crusty crud on their heads, at best, or just some black goo. Lame behavior and lame appearence= LAME.  I think if they'da made this with regular zombies it could've been a middle of the road zombie pic, and if they had some decent gore.  The gore in this is terrible, other than a few amusing exploding heads.  It's not especially gory for this sort of film either, though again, this isn't much of a loss considering the quality of it.

There's not too much else to say, it's just a lotta angry zombies running around cutting people up.  Reasonably amusing, but not much more than that.  The only really great moment is when a pack of zombies bursts in on an operation, and one surgeons flings a scalpel across the room and into one of the zombies necks.  That was pretty sweet.

Yeah, that's it.  Amusing, but just barely.

6070070,3,B00GBJWY76,"cause i actually kinda liked this movie.  It reminded me of Argento's Demons.  Fast moving, unforgiving monsters that run you down and tear you apart.  Scarier than slow zombies who bump into things.  Not to say this is a great horror movie or a classic by any means, it reeks of cheese and deserves its criticisms(fx, plotholes, acting).  But seriously, does every zombie film have to adhere strictly to the rules laid down by Lugosi's White Zombie or Romero's NotLD?  Do all horror films have to follow by-the-numbers guidelines?  Isn't the horror genre about pushing limits, causing controversy, and upsetting the status quo?

Admittedly, this movie is completely ridiculous in its depiction of zombies, but that's what i found entertaining about it.  A bunch of 'zombies' running around killing people(and tearing off the tops of women) makes for a good night of popcorn viewing imo.  Lots of fast paced action not found in other zombie/italian flicks.  If you want the other 'offensive' zombie film that doesn't adhere to the strict zombie code of conduct, go see the reviews for Burial Ground: Night of Terror(another entertainingly sleazy zombie flick that's even better than Nightmare City).",1126742400,,1199,5.128865979381444
6070071,2,B00GBJWY76,"Okay, that's a bit harsh, this film is actually growing on me. My feelings at this point are a bit torn. I found the first half of the movie to be rather monotonous; the second half really picked up. Perhaps it was more the final 3rd of the movie. Anyway, this is a hard film to describe without oversimplifying, because for much of it there was just a lot of killing and nothing much else, but I'll take a shot at a synopsis anyway.

""Nightmare City"" is the story of a violent zombie attack on a metropolitan area as a result of a planeload of radiated passengers overpowering the population. Actually, I use the word ""zombie"" rather loosely here. These aren't really zombies. Truly, the Romero zombies aren't really zombies either, but that's another argument altogether. Taking George Romero's creations as the standard for movie zombies, or even the simple understanding that zombies are the walking dead, you couldn't classify the creatures in ""Nightmare City"" as being anything remotely close to zombies. The creatures in ""Nightmare City"" are more akin to what we saw in the recent film ""28 Days Later."" These are living humans who are infected with some sort of nuclear radiation sickness that makes them incredibly violent and powerful, with a desperation to fill their bellies with human blood. They also look like they've got taco meat on their face. From the moment they spill out of their plane and attack the city, the creatures embark on a weapon wielding killing spree that runs for most of the movie, with little scenes stuck in here and there to introduce characters that really aren't very important at all. Unless you're a complete gorehound, it can be really tedious to get through. However, the film does pick up in the latter half, when the attention begins to focus on a reporter character and his wife as they attempt to escape the madness. This last portion of the film does become moderately enjoyable, and the twist ending, while some who can't tolerate the cliche of it may complain, is really a welcome element. It adds a much needed kick to a generally lackluster film.

""Nightmare City"" comes off as a rather amateurish film from Italian director Umberto Lenzi. The character development is virtually nonexistent, and the make-up is just plain awful. There's very little positive I CAN say about the film, except that it has its moments that do catch your eye, and the final act is really not too bad. It also must be given credit for the original spin it puts on the zombie genre. Still, I can't recommend the film to anyone except the most hardcore gore-lover and zombie film enthusiast. For those who ARE interested, however, the DVD includes an informative interview with the director, a theatrical trailer that would never have been shown in an American theater, and a bio of Umberto Lenzi. I suppose ""Nightmare City"" is a must watch for anyone wanting to explore Italian zombie horror, but do so at your own risk.",1120435200,11,2950,4.771037181996086
6070072,1,B00GBJWY76,"Director Umberto Lenzi may be of a similiar lineage as other Italian exploitation/horror movie directors, but he is in no way in the same class as some of his brethern. Mario Bava, Dario Argento and Lucio Fulci are generally considered to be the best of the best, but on a level or three below them are Jess Franco, Joe D'Amato and Umberto Lenzi.

I own many of all of these directors movies, some are ecxellent (Zombi, Suspiria, Black Sunday), some are ok (Death of the Twitch Nerve, City of the Living Dead, Inferno) and some are complete crap. We must file Lenzi's ""Nightmare City"" under the latter category. I really didn't realize that you could actually pack a steaming pile of feces in a DVD case but ""Nightmare City"" proves that it can be done.

I am not even going to go into a plot synopsis, or character descriptions as there really is no reason to when a stinker like this is being reviewed. The acting is atrocious, the dubbing horrific (in a bad way), the make-up/special FX amateurish, the sound is awful, the story is ridiculous, and the ending is a total cop-out.

This movie is about an hour and a half of wasted time you will not be able to get back. Waste not your time or your money on this movie. Instead get a six-pack of Labbats and watch a Fulci movie, you'll have more fun and have a better value for your time and hard earned cash.",1112659200,8,1358,4.402390438247012
6070073,4,B00GBJWY76,"First off, let me say that this is as solid of an 80's Italian Horror flick as you can find.  I will skip the synopsis as i'm sure that is already the easiest info to find on this page.  Basically, this is not your typical 'zombie' flick.  It actually at times feels more like an action/horror flick than a 'zombie' one.  Initially, these are victims of a radioactive spill who go on a killing/cannibalistic rampage, rather than people who have died and come back to life to feast on the living.  Yes they do eat people and Yes those people come back to life to kill more.  These 'zombies' do run and carry on enough intelligence to use knives, guns, etc...to kill their victims.

This edition of the DVD is the uncut version, so there are great gore scenes.  I wouldn't say the gore is gratuitous when compared to other movies in this sub-genre, but it is a healthy amount.  Sticklers to this genre, in other words, people who need thier zombies to be traditionally slow-moving and non-thinking, will not enjoy this movie.  But if you have an open mind and are equally interested in a good mix of horror, action, and cheesy B-movie material, then this is a good buy for you.

I give it 4 stars because its a solid movie...it's not exactly BURIAL GROUND, but it carries it's own value.  Surprisingly, the plot and story development is good material for a movie in this sub-genre.  The ending is great, unexpected, and totally different from anything I have seen in movies like this, while at the same time being cliched in other films.

The reason this movie doesn't get the whole 5 from me, is that I feel it would have been alot better off as a more traditional Zombie flick.  Not to be a stickler, I don't mind if the zombies can run and use weapons but these zombies were using weapons as if nothing was wrong with them.  It's like they just have some kind of green algae on their face, and all of a sudden, they went psycho.  They could have looked a little more 'zombied' up.  I mean, I know that Umberto Lenzi didn't want to do stereotypical zombie makeup, but at least make them look more like that dead one on the military base with the worm coming out of it's eye.  To sum it up:  If you have about 20 bucks to spare and are in need of an interesting, reliable pick for when you have a few friends over to drink and poke fun at some good 80's Italian Zombie B-Movie CHEESE, then this movie is a necessity.  I would, however, view some Romero, Fulci, Bava among others first to fully appreciate this one.",1104278400,3,2513,4.384449244060475

6070075,1,B00GBJWY76,"Nightmare City (aka City of the Walking Dead) is probably one of the worst zombie films EVER made.  It induces unintentional laughter at times and provides much entertainment for the viewer trying to pick apart all the plot holes.  The story begins with a mysterious C-130 with no identifying insignia (why the aircraft has none is never explained) that lands uninvited at an unnamed city airport.  Soldiers and police surround the plane only to be attacked and dispatched rapidly by an army of living dead pouring off the transport aircraft.  (At this point, one must give the film credit for making the zombies VERY fast and very intelligent.  In fact, the zombies act smarter than the Civil Defense people in the city.)  Departing from many zombie films, the zombies in Nightmare City survive by constant drinking of blood usually provided from a slashed throat.  The film goes back to more traditional zombie film rules when it is learned that the only thing that can kill a zombie is a gunshot to the head.  (In one of the film's many plot holes, a general is shown issuing orders for police and soldiers to shoot attacking zombies in the head but inexplicably hardly anyone does this.)  The film then follows a reporter who desperately tries to rescue his wife from a hospital in danger of falling to the living dead.  Then the pair try to flee the city.
For gore fans, there's precious little in this film.  Most throats ""slashed"" open by the zombies hardly bleed at all.  Anyone wanting a good storyline will be disappointed.  About the only ones who won't be disappointed with this film will be diehard zombie enthusiasts.  Still, it's not as bad as the awful Zombie 4: The Afterdeath.",1085443200,2,1694,4.756849315068493

What bothered me most besides the very cheap special effects (not including the eye gouge or the head shots), were probably the zombies themselves. These zombies are not really zombies, think of them as cannibals who only die when hit in the brain, that's basically what they are. Most of them don't look like zombies, and alot look too human to be zombies, which is why this movie was not fun to watch, they moved way too fast, and were way too smart to be zombies. They also felt pain and fear, which isn't realistic because zombies shouldn't feel pain considering their nerves are dead, they broke almost ever rule there is and that's the reason why I didn't really enjoy this. Some scenes were ok and some were just stupid, like zombies that aren't close to explosions being thrown away by the little blasts. There are alot of cliches in this, and if you seen Cannibal Ferox you know what will happen when the woman starts to lose it in front of the reporter. The ending was cool but you expected the reporter to actually do something, I'm not going to say what but watch it and you'll see that it was a dissapointment.

 After viewing it for a while it had dawned on me, that some of the scenes and elements of this movie were almost exactly like the more recent Brad Pitt movie ""World War Z"" which was based on a sci fi novel.

 A couple of scenes had struck out for me, the scene where the zombie people come out of the cargo Air Force plane which had been way too similar to a scene in WWZ, the pandemic of the zombies and the fact that unlike other movies like ""Night of the Living dead"" these zombies were fast moving and aggressive.  Some other scenes seemed to be strong indicators to me that the movie makers, or maybe the author got some ideas from this older film because I felt while watching that I had seen it already.

 Over all the movie is phony, campy, and classless with a lot of fake gore so it isn't for very young kids obviously but I felt it was suitable enough for maybe ages 12 and up because compared to today's Hollywood technology old films like this one make for a long laugh fest 101.

I never would have imagined this film would see the light of day on BR until I happened to come across it on Amazon.. Being a big fan of the Italian Zombie gore genre, though technically not really a Zombie film, Nightmare City has always been a guilty pleasure of mine in all its cheesy glory.",1442361600,,357,4.264705882352941
8622043,5,B00GBJWY76,"One of the best ""zombie"" movies ever: a breathtaking adventure toward Hell...!!! I saw Quentin Tarantino mentioning about this movie on a YouTube video: saying that absolutely was a genius idea to see, for the first time, a kind of zombies (they are instead very strong mutants) being able to move very fast!
This made them deadly dangerous and almost unstoppable since they can use all kind of weapons, and it is more difficult to kill them with a bullet to the head.
Nightmare City has been an event movie in Europe that became soon a worldwide horror cult loaded with terrifying thrills, gruesome special effects, and capped with an astonishing surprise ending.
If you are a horror movie lover you can't miss it: it's a must have in your movie collection!!!",1440028800,5,760,4.765151515151516
8622044,4,B00GBJWY76,"This is one of a long string of popular Italian zombie films of the 80's. This one is a little different, though. Instead of slow moving, rip 'em apart with your hands and teeth walking dead, you have very quick ones ones that aren't beneath picking up a gun and using it. The film opens with our hero (Hugo Stiglitz), a television reporter, covering a story at a local airport. An unidentified plane lands and, while police surround it, the door opens and a horde of well armed zombies dash out. Arms are ripped out of sockets, throats are slashed, flesh is eaten, and bodies are riddled with bullets. Hugo decides to warn the populace, but to no avail, as he has the plug pulled on him by government officials. Meanwhile, the zombies attack a televised dance show (a girl's breast is cut off), a hospital (robbing a blood bank, attacking bed-ridden patients, and stopping an operation in progress to chow down on a patient's open incision), and at the end, an amusement park (scenes of zombies being shot in the head in slow motion). It all turns out to be a dream, however, when Hugo awakens and remembers he has to cover a story at the local airport. Holy deja vu Batman! It's a fun movie in a twisted sort of way. It started the ""fast-moving zombie"" craze and is nuttier than most, as well as being extremely gory. Directed by Umberto Lenzi (ALMOST HUMAN - 1974) and also known as CITY OF THE WALKING DEAD. Also starring Mel Ferrer, Laura Trotter and Francisco Rabal. The DVD, offered by Raro Video, is the preferred way of seeing it because it is the completely unedited version in both Italian (with English subtitles) and English dubbed. I saw this film about a dozen times in the early-80's at midnight showings and never grew tired of it. I also seem to spot something new on every viewing. This is one of those films that has wonderful replay value, not because it is a good film (it isn't), but because it is just bats**t crazy. Not Rated.",1437782400,,1951,4.5141242937853105
