8060261,5,B0009GU9OW,"Stanton Moore as a way of presenting material that is clear and concise. The examples he shows are solid and clearly demonstrate the concepts he is teaching. There is a lot of material here, however and the possibilities will take a long time to explore thoroughly. Overall a really great video.",1392163200,,295,4.803921568627451
