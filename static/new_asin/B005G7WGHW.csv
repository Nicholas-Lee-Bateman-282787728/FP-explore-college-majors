8471314,1,B005G7WGHW,This movie wasn't worth the time or money.  A very low budge film that I think should have never been produced.,1379808000,,111,4.285714285714286
8471315,1,B005G7WGHW,This was garbage. I found this movie for five dollars at walmart and even that was too much. The timelines were way off...this whole movie just made no sense. Oh the girl on the cover isn't even a character. It was just all bad. I feel like I just watched a movie with a bunch of kids trying to promote their music.,1367712000,,315,4.096774193548387
8471316,1,B005G7WGHW,If it was possible to give this a minus rating of stars that is exactly what this movie would get.  This is the worse movie I've watched in over one year.  I would not recommend this to anyone.,1326931200,,193,4.052631578947368
8471317,1,B005G7WGHW,"SAVE YOUR MONEY! UTTER FOOLISHNESS!!! The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because it did take effort to atleast produce and put this movie out and I won't ever knock a person who at least tried. The story line had potential but was not presented well. So A for effort (one star). HOWEVER.. the movie was extremely low budget and it this was an incomplete thought. The acting wasn't polished and it sounded like a script being read in some parts (although, I've seen much worse. The movie skipped ahead too much and left out too much with one couple that you are left wondering.. How on earth did we get to this part of the movie!?!?!. Every other scene it said ""one week later"" like it was leading up to something... NOT!!!! I take that back.. it lead up to  TO BE CONTINUED. WHAT?!?! SERIOUSLY?!?! to be continued?? You didn't finish the first thought and you mean to tell me there's a second in the works. This movie felt like it was really a singing audition for 3 men trying to break into the music industry. Not impressed at all and it's VERY hard for me not to like a movie no matter what calibur it is..independent, low budget, big screen, broadway.. etc.  Take some more classes, study more film production,polish up your work then come back and try again. I won't totally give up on you but your better bring it in this industry!! GLAD I rented it first.",1322784000,3,1364,4.387351778656127
