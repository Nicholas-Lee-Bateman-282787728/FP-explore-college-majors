8746430,5,B01A2MU5N2,"A superb avant- garde, jungian treatment of Beethovens singular opera! The singing and orchestral performances are stellar as one would expect with the assembled world class talent. For me, it is the existential staging of this opera that reigns supreme here. Kaufmanns singing and acting is magnificent. A veritable masterpiece musically, aesthetically and intellectually!",1525996800,,373,5.925925925925926
8746431,5,B01A2MU5N2,"I was completely shattered by this production of Fidelio when I first saw the broadcast from the Salzburg Festival. It is NOT a traditional production. You are not left full of hope for freedom and the brotherhood of man from Beethoven's majestic final chorus (think 9th symphony). Quite the opposite! And that I think is Claus Guth's (director) point. Human society is still imprisoned from within by the weaknesses and vulnerabilities of our psyche. Still imprisoned, enslaved. The final ""Heil sei dem Tag!"" is sung by a retreating chorus. Almost every positive assertion made by Beethoven is countered with modern reality by Guth. As anti-Beethoven this is tremendous theater. Incredible portrayal of the self-defeating Florestan by Jonas Kaufmann. Can't imagine any other tenor as this Florestan. As he usually does, Kaufmann lives the role 100%. Vocally he has mastered the music and his famous ""Gott! Welch Dunkel hier!"" is here the cry of one shackled by fear. Shackles that neither political decree, human love (Leonore) nor Beethoven's exultant music can unlock. The rest of the cast were excellent. Pieczonka's Leonore fit well with this tortured Florestan. No consumating passionate embrace after ""O namenlose Freude!"" for this faithful courageous wife. The signing double expressed Leonore's inner feelings so she could maintain her disguise. I won't reveal the ending but you will either have a cathartic experience or ? Well, there were both bravos and boos at the opening. You will not  be bored.",1503532800,,1511,5.243801652892562

8746433,4,B01A2MU5N2,"Fidelio is one of my favorite operas. I've always felt that Beethoven built a work more akin to a symphony than an opera in the usual italian style, so it doesn't work as well when approached as you would a normal opera. For it to work, it must be approached as a symphonic work, namely, as another symphony by the great composer, with the voices treated just like other instruments, building musical lines interweaved with one another.

There are several aspects to this performance of Fidelio that I feel are necessary to talk about:

First of all, the musical aspect. I have to say this is one of the best performances I've seen or heard of Fidelio. It is incredibly dramatic, with great forward propulsion by the conductor Franz Welser-Most, which always keeps the performance going forward, building the dramatic tension required for this work. Only in the prisoner chorus do I feel he leaves some subtleties behind, compared with some of the best conductors. At last we have a nicely paced and dramatic Fidelio (the Levine and Haitink recordings are awfully slow and anti-dramatic, with the Harnoncourt one being the best of the previous bunch). I should also note that the conductor uses the tradition started by Gustav Mahler of playing the Leonor III overture before Don Fernando's arrival, which I've always found to be an excellent choice, since it's the best and most exciting of the Leonore/Fidelio overtures, and here it's wonderfully and excitingly played by Welser-Most and the Vienna Philharmonic.

All the main singers are excellent, one of the best all-around casts that I've heard. I won't name each one because all of them are great. Perhaps Tomasz Konieczy is a bit light for Pizarro, I usually prefer a darker, more menacing voice, but it is I think what the stage director wanted.

The second aspect and the most controversial is the stage production. I don't understand people who buy operas in what are clearly modern productions (as opposed to traditional stagings) only to say that they are garbage because they hate modern productions. I don't mind the modern stagings, in fact, I think they can be rather interesting and sometimes even beautiful to watch. Unluckily, that's not always the case. In this particular case, we're presented with a Florestan whose prison seems to be his own mind, he could have autism, deafness, or just be a prisoner by his own choice. The idea is sometimes interesting, but sometimes it just falls flat, as it clearly contradicts the music and the text in some parts. Still, there are some nice touches with Pizarro and his doppelg&auml;nger shadow and the different character shadows reflecting on the wall. So, in all, I'd give three or four stars to the production, albeit it can sometimes distract you from the beautiful music.

The last aspect is the technical one. The image resolution and color are wonderful. The sound is something of a mixed bag. The instruments and voices do not have the weight and presence they should, as they have in, for example, the Opus Arte productions. I have a good stereo system. In the stereo PCM sound, the balance between singers and orchestra is not very good, with the instruments sounding too weak compared to the voices. And, as I said, a good balance between singers and orchestra is absolutely necessary, since I feel Beethoven thought of the as equals in their respective roles. Also, the voices have a strange glare, as if the sound was compressed. However, the DTS Master sound has a much better balance between voices and orchestra, even when downgraded to stereo by my blu-ray player, which allowed me to enjoy the performance as much as I did, even if the sound doesn't quite match the best blu-ray opera recordings. For some strange reason, I find all of the Sony opera dvd's and blu-ray's lacking in the sound quality department.

All in all, I rate this performance as 5 stars for the musical performance, 3.5 stars for the production.",1489449600,,3951,4.863298662704309

8746435,1,B01A2MU5N2,"Do not care for the production at all.  Singing is very good, especially Kaufman but I could not understand the need for sign language. The sets do ot match the action.  I  favor a more traditional approach.",1484611200,2,207,4.54054054054054
8746436,2,B01A2MU5N2,"The up dating of the time period was not as disturbing as the awful scenery which failed to show the darkness and injustice of tyrants. The elimination of the spoken dialogue using some sort of hand sign language further weakens the plot and defies Beethoven's intentions...as we know he re-worked the piece numerous times.  The singing is quite up to today's best standards and the conducting and orchestra are excellent.  Jonas Hoffmann's wheeling around the stage during the finale looks improvised and self conscious.  I would not want to see this video again, although the music is well done, Over-all, I wish these hind of productions would try to be more sensitive. Fidelio deserves better than this production failure, which concludes with a look-alike Leonore standing downstage and signing for the deaf  during the final chorus.  Beethoven must have been a truly great composer to ""survive"" this production.",1479772800,4,917,5.168918918918919
8746437,5,B01A2MU5N2,"I have always felt that an opera rises or falls according to the quality of the singing.  So, by that standard this gets five stars.  However, the staging gets no stars (zero) from me.  I understand the impulse to do something new, and I am certain that those involved  were trying to offer a fresh interpretation based on new insight.  For me, however, it just did not work.  For example, consider the ending when Florestan and the other political prisoners are released and reunited with their families.  To my ear, Beethoven composed what is perhaps the most uplifting, joyfully exuberant  music in all of opera.  Somehow, the sight of Florestan covering his ears at the sound of his rescue music and then falling to the stage, presumably dead, seems to fly in the face of the glorious joy expressed in the music.  The singing is superb, but I do not think that this should be one's first or only version of this opera.  Fortunately, there are several first-rate versions available on DVD,  including  ones conducted by Bernstein, Levine, Bohm, and Harnoncourt.  My advice would be to try one of these before buying this new version.",1476057600,10,1136,4.758974358974359
8746438,5,B01A2MU5N2,"Beyond Awesome. The cast and orchestra let us know that we will hear perfection. Now for the production. It is ultra modern. Almost futuristic. And ""IT WORKS"" !!! I frequently feel that most European modern productions are ""EuroTrash"". ""NOT THIS ONE"" !!! The set is reminiscent of the (near the end of the movie) bedroom scene in the film 2001 a Space Odyssey. The white stark wood paneled walls with a huge black monolith. Sometimes the monolith revolves allowing other cast members to emerge, sometimes stationary. Using light on the white walls the singers are shadowed sometimes very large, sometimes small, depending on the lyrics to expand their portrayed feelings. There is a signer that also expresses the emotions as they are sung thus eliminating the spoken word so that all the music moves along seamlessly. I have vinyl recordings of this opera but nothing impressed me as this did. I feel that it is my being able to not just hear but to see the perfect marriage of this complete new production with the magnificent performers and the stark set decoration that has impressed me so. Again ""IT WORKS"" !!!",1470182400,12,1115,4.842931937172775
