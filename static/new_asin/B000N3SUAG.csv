8174492,5,B000N3SUAG,"Wow!  This is a hard-rocking, head-banging show that will make you smile even as you find yourself with the songs stuck in your head days later.  Doro's charisma and pure metal spirit haven't changed at all over the years, and her voice - while she leaves out most of the spine-shivery high notes she used to scream - is still powerful, raw, and gorgeous.

There are two shows in this collection.  The first one, the Warrior Soul tour documentary, has good performances of several songs from that album, interspersed with behind-the-scenes footage.  Pros are the appearance of great anthems like You're My Family; cons are the odd filming cuts between venues (every shot switches between clips of the same song being performed at different concerts, using one sound synced to the video) and the way that, between every song, it goes into the story of the tour instead of continuing with the rockin' awesomeness.

The second show is Doro's 20th anniversary concert in Dusseldorf.  The first disc has an abbreviated version of that, with little video comments between the songs (friends and musicians talking about their esteem and admiration for Doro, etc).  The whole show is on the second disc, and does a better job of replicating the passion and excitement of the concert.

DVD-wise, the disc is in PAL format, so make sure you can play it.  I'm playing it with Windows Media Player on a 2007 computer, so your computer should be able to run it (and there's a 5.1 sound feature if you have the option of plugging into higher quality speakers).  It's not HD, but neither is it fuzzy or anything.  It's much higher quality than watching the videos on YouTube!  Good sound, nice pyrotechnics and lights on the anniversary tour, all well done and driven by Doro and her excellent backing band.

Remembering off the top of my head, the Warrior Soul tour includes, in addition to the documentary bits, You're My Family, Strangers Yesterday, My Majesty, Above The Ashes, Fur Immer, True As Steel, Haunted Heart, and All We Are.

The anniversary concert is really great.  Again listing them from memory (which ain't infallible), songs that are on here are I Rule The Ruins, Always Live To Win, Metal Racer, Hellbound, Burning the Witches, Metal Tango, Hellraiser, Fight, Earthshaker Rock, True As Steel, White Wedding, Egypt - The Chains Are On, Born to Be Wild, Evil, Love Me Forever, Love Me in Black, Brutal and Effective, Fur Immer, Tausen Mal Gelebt, Burn It Up (with football cheerleaders!), Fall For Me Again, You're Got Another Thing Coming, Out Of Control, A Whiter Shade of Pale, Unholy Love, Alles Ist Gut, Bad Blood, All Night, Can't Stop Thinking About You, and All We Are.

Given Doro's long and productive career, everyone is going to have a feeling of, ""Wait, why isn't _______ in there?""  (Save My Soul, World Gone Wild, Thunderspell?)  What there is, however, is excellent.  Doro gives a fantastic performance whose energy and joy will have you banging your head along with the crowd.  Stay hard!",1265760000,2,3009,4.837890625
8174493,5,B000N3SUAG,"If you know of Doros music you will enjoy this alot. If you have not been turned on to her yet,do yourself a favor and pick up this dvd. All the current metal bands featuring female singers have Ms. Pesch to thank for blazing the trail!",1230940800,,236,4.1521739130434785
8174494,4,B000N3SUAG,"I ordered this not realizing that it was PAL, not NTSC.  Had to order a universal player to view the video.  Once that was done, the album was good.  It is interesting to see a femal metal rocker.  Bought her first self-titled album because of the album art.  But have since become a true fan.  Wish she would tour in the United States.  If you like Scorpions, you will like Doro Pesch.",1212192000,3,386,4.277777777777778
8174495,5,B000N3SUAG,"Great 2-DVD set. The concert did not dissapoint! Seeing the ""True as Steel"" line-up reunited for a few songs was the highlight of the show, in my opinion. Well worth the price!",1192579200,,176,4.53125

8174497,4,B000N3SUAG,"I'm glad to have puchased this DVD for one main reason -- concert footage from 2006 for their latest album, ""Warrior Soul.""

This DVD contains 3 major items on 2 discs. The first item on disc 1 is 90 minutes of concert footage from their European tour for the ""Warrior Soul"" album. It's really cool to see them play songs from the newest album, in addition to their popular classics, with a couple other tunes thrown in. The songs are played in their entirety, but video footage from other shows are mixed into most songs. The timing is perfect, but it can be annoying because they overdo it. It's OK, though. I think it would have been better to show them play an enire song at one venue, then show them play the next song at another venue, rather than mixing it all together. Similarly, they add slow motion to a few videos for effect, but at the wrong time (like the guitarist is wailing away at a solo, but it shows him in slow motion). Because of the edited video clips thown in and the video effects not really put in the right spots, I think the video production company must not have much experience in producing music videos. Even so, I really enjoyed seeing the band play the new songs on video finally and they are all great songs. Another great feature is the band members telling the viewer between songs about the tour as they go from city to city. Doro does most of the discussions, which in her case are in German, but there are English subtitles for all but one of her segments. The other guys (except for Oli) speak in English because they are American. Related to that, there is a lot of behind-the-scences footage. Awesome.

The second item on disc 1 is 91 minutes of edited footage from a special concert from 2003 in celebration of Doro's 20th anniversary of being in the music business. It's too bad it took them 4 years to put out this footage because it feels a bit dated since they don't play any new songs. It's great to have now, nonetheless. This section of the DVD is great because of 2 things -- the guest musicians and a few songs that didn't appear on the ""Fr Immer"" cave concert DVD. There were several exciting things to see here, including appearances from Udo Dirkschneider (lead singer from Accept) and two guys from Motorhead. Udo helped out on ""East Meets West,"" adding his classic Accept screeching growls to the songs. Have you ever bought a music CD for just 1 song? Well, you should buy this DVD just to see Lemmy Kilmister and Mikkey Dee from Motorhead and Doro and her band play Motorhead's ""Love Me Forever."" It's such an awesome song. Motorhead is an acquired taste, but Lemmy and Doro do a great duet here. Awesome. Another great feature worth having is the reunion song with Doro and the original guys from Warlock. They play ""Fight for Rock,"" which I think might have been one of their first hits and music videos to appear in the U.S. (though it's from their 3rd album). Cool. Another great song to see in this concert is Doro's version of Dio's ""Egypt - The Chains Are On."" They do a great job, and I like this version better than the original. There are other guest musicians, but the ones I mentioned were the best. The rest of this section of the DVD contains brief congratulations between songs to Doro from various rock stars in metal we all know and her boxer buddy Regina Halmich. The only thing I didn't like about his section of the DVD was that they cut-away to the next thing when the band was halfway through ""Unholy Love;"" so we only see them play half of that song. The rest of the songs are shown all the way through.

Disc 2 contains the entire 2003 anniversary concert. Get some popcorn and something to drink, get comfortable, and set aside some time because the concert is 3 hours long.

This is a great DVD, but I gave it 4 stars because I was a little turned off by the video editing for the ""Warrior Soul"" concert footage. I think I'm a little too much of a perfectionist, though. You might not care about those things which I considered problems, in which case this is a 5 star DVD.

It is interesting to compare ""the cave concert"" from the ""Fr Immer"" DVD to the anniversary concert on this DVD because they occured in the same tour/year. I liked the cave concert better -- the atmosphere was just cool. However -- and this is important -- the audio mixing for the concerts on this DVD are much better because the vocals and music are at the same levels and you can hear the background vocals. On the ""Fr Immer"" DVD, Doro's vocals were much louder than the music and you couldn't (or barely) hear the background vocals, which I think were important on several songs.

I highly recommend this DVD, and I'd like to show it to my friends who don't know about this band. The packaging is great, with lots of photos in the liner notes booklet, and the 2 DVDs are in separate holders, unlike the ""Fr Immer"" DVDs, which were stacked on top of each other, causing the screen printing on the lower DVD to scratch the play side of other.

Man, I really want to give this DVD 5 stars.",1181174400,22,5049,4.405144694533762
