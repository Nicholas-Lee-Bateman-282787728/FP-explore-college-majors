8709909,4,B00VEUX2LE,"This film wasn't easy to watch, and it commenced haunting me as soon as I had finished.

It is in many ways a self-consciously arty film, from the 50s jazz score to the black and white cinematography, to the performances.  Based on a true situation (Dylan Thomas's reading tour in the US in the 1950s instigated by the academic John Malcolm Brinnin), the filmmaker has created settings and dialogue to enhance the situation of an alcoholic, brilliant Welsh poet pinballing between New York taprooms and the stuffiest Ivy League reading rooms.  Brinnin as played by a nearly unrecognizable Elijah Wood is frightfully uptight.  He has chosen to attach to the most volatile possible character to launch his academic fortune - a venture almost guaranteed to fail.  This movie has a sense of doom hanging over it from start to finish.  Even when Brinnin brings Thomas to his childhood vacation home in Connecticut to dry out and recharge in the 4 days between New York and a critical appearance at Yale, the mood is gloomy and menacing rather than serene.  In fact, I actually had to fast-forward during a wild evening with neighbors who were determined to one-up each other with horror stories.  (Side note:  the movie was actually filmed in Swansea, Wales, in 18 days.)

It's no spoiler that Thomas's tour of the States could actually be viewed as successful, no thanks to Brinnin's efforts to contain his appetites.  This is a depressing story and no punches are pulled.  I don't need to watch it ever again, but like I said, it is haunting me.  It really is a very well-made movie.",1438560000,8,1580,4.764705882352941
8709910,5,B00VEUX2LE,"Perfect, old-school filmmaking. A beautifully acted, directed, produced, scored and written piece of cinema. I simply cannot fault it. The strongest film I've seen in a long time. Whether or not you're familiar with Dylan Thomas, the film is still highly recommended. Support passionate, independent cinema and see this film as soon as you can. It truly deserves all the success under the sun.",1435795200,4,393,5.15625

8709912,1,B00VEUX2LE,"It is simply impossible to say enough bad things about this horrendously incompetent, low-budget, unwatchable piece of garbage. The lead actor - Celyn Jones - is fine, but the writing, videography, other acting, directing, editing, conceptualization, music and dialogue are all so awful it has to be seen (for 5 minutes, anyway) to be believed. Incredible that this film was funded and distributed anywhere (when I saw it, as part of a national film festival program!) but at a bar mitzvah reception. An insult to Dylan Thomas, to John Malcolm Brinnin, to film students, and to grantmaking institutions everywhere. One hopes the director, Andy Goddard, will have facial surgery and change his name as soon as possible. Z for effort.",1434240000,2,732,5.108333333333333
