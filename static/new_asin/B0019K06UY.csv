8274185,5,B0019K06UY,"The title of this DVD translates as ""An Evening With Carla Fracci"". It was an Italian TV broadcast from 1973 and is a delightful, rare gem. It shows Carla dancing in classical ballet pieces: Sleeping Beauty--finale, Romeo and Juliet balcony scene--Cranko version, and segments of a traditional private ballet class at La Scala--some barre and center. It also includes some other genres: A modern camera montage with Carla superimposed while dancing, a jazz medley with two other dancers, and a fantastic cancan version with members of La Scala Ballet. There is even an opera piece with Giuseppe di Stefano singing to her. Carla also does some speaking in Italian, of course. It is marvelous to hear her speak in her native tongue. Don't worry, there are subtitles(in English, Spanish, French, and Japanese). Carla was in her prime when this was done. The picture and sound are great, so if you enjoy Carla and obscure ballet videos, you will love this!",1217894400,14,952,4.95625
