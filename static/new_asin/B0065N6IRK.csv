I laughed at some things but I would say its very mediocre, it has it moments but has some problems.",1325462400,3,676,4.2890625
4960829,5,B0065N6IRK,"What's Your Number? is usually compared to Bridesmaids, well it shouldn't. Sure, they star hilarious female actress (Anna Faris & Kristen Wiig), but they shouldn't be compared to each other. What's Your Number? is cheesy and fun, while Bridesmaids is funny, but also has a ""serious"" tone to it. What's Your Number? is flat-out funny, right-in-your-face predictable, but that's what I expected it to be. I really enjoyed this one and preordered my copy! It's an excellent movie and I could watch it over and over!",1324080000,44,512,4.965116279069767
4960830,1,B0065N6IRK,"""What's Your Number?"" is an R-rated romantic comedy that stars Anna Faris, who is known for being quirky characters, most notably for her role in the movie ""House Bunny"". Her counterpart in the movie is Chris Evans from ""Captain America"". The premise centers around Ally Darling (Faris), who, after being fired from her job, stumbles across an article in a Marie Claire magazine that says the average amount of sexual partners you should have in your lifetime is around 10. Ally's number is considerably higher than that. So, she assumes she has already met the person she was supposed to marry and starts on a quest to find out which one of the men she had been with and should have stuck with.

As far as romantic comedies go, it's not a bad premise, but the problem is, ""What's Your Number?"" tries way too hard to be funny and poignant and fails at both. I won't deny that some of the humor in the movie made me laugh. For the most part though, the comedic attempts were way over the top and seemed to fall flat like a lump of coal.

For instance, as she waits for one of her men to cross the restaurant, we get a slow motion moment where he greets everybody in the place like he's a rock star or Mr. Popularity and Ally's hair catches on fire from a barbecue pit behind her. There are numerous moments like this. She falls over a fence and says a bad word and of course there are children nearby who begin to chant the dirty word over and over.

One message the movie has that resonated with me was its message about love and how you can tell for yourself what love is. Unfortunately, it was the only thing in the movie that grabbed me. It was too long, clich&eacute; and poorly written from beginning to end.

Many of the scenes in the movie also seemed to be staged just to highlight a different spot in the city of Boston. I'm pretty sure that the city of Boston paid a pretty penny for this movie and because of that had a lot of say in what, where and when scenes would be shot, all the way up to the final shot of the film. Of course the break-in strip basketball scene at Boston's Bank North Garden basketball court was solid proof of that.

""What's Your Number?"" is not a very good movie. It's desperate flailing for laughs and moments is evidence enough they knew they had a lot of work to do in order to overcome a lackluster script.",1324080000,6,2347,4.312925170068027
4960831,3,B0065N6IRK,"I liked both of the characters, i really didn't see 20 guys such a bad thing since i know plenty of women who say they've slept with very few guys and i know for a fact that they've slept with more. I think it's more of quality not quantity that should matter the most any ways.

It's basically a story I've seen before where the girl is looking for Mr. Right and she doesn't see him right in front of her. Chris Evans is hot, especially coming out of his apartment in only a small towel ;)

The movie wasn't the best romantic comedy I've seen, but it wasn't the worst. It was funny at times and sweet the next, and it was slow in certain parts, but other than that i thought it was worth seeing, i wouldn't mind watching it again.",1323475200,15,731,4.104895104895105

4960833,3,B0065N6IRK,Just ok.  Was looking for something fun and romantic-comedy like.  This seemed promising but really I didn't much care for either of the leads and the story plot was only so-so.,1519776000,,177,4.67741935483871

4960836,4,B0065N6IRK,"First an observation: even though this movie is set in Boston, no one has a Boston accent. What's Your Number is a pretty good comedy that gets a bit crude at times, which, to my way of thinking, helps give it a sense of realism.  I would rate this movie 4 stars or higher but I felt that the ending got a bit silly, including a stolen car and bicycle.  Also, the happy couple was never really in doubt.  That doesn't bother me too much because I think it was cute how the two finally come together at the end.  I just wish they kept it more real instead of grand larceny.",1519344000,,572,4.080357142857143

4960839,5,B0065N6IRK,INCREDIBLY FUNNY.  Anna was funnier than ever and sexier too.  It's about a lady reading the number of sex partners the average lady has and hers is double.  So it's all about her dealing with that and her super slutty neighbor guy.  And her sisters wedding and crazed mom.  You'll laugh from the start until the sweet end.  A GREAT MOVIE.,1515196800,,339,4.475409836065574
4960840,5,B0065N6IRK,"What's Your Number? is a fun film where Anna Farris' character Ally reads an article in a magazine that says the average woman will have ten lovers in a lifetime.  She laughs while reading thinking it ridiculously small, the other people in the train carriage laugh too thinking it's ridiculously high.  She survey's her friends in a drunken party game, only to find that they are like the woman on the train.  She'd slept with 19 men, and just woken up next to her twentieth.  She doesn't want to build to this tally, so decides to find the perfect guy amongst the twenty she's already slept with.  She engages the services of her rude neighbour (Chris Evans), to track down and give her info on each of the guys (she's made a list) in exchange for him being able to use her apartment to hide out in until women he's slept with leave his apartment.  The outcome of the film is predictable, but it's still a really fun journey there. If you don't like crude humour, and nudity, this isn't the film for you, but if that isn't the case, you'll love this film.",1514592000,,1057,4.422680412371134

BOTH Anna Faris (OMG I LOVE her no, who knew?) and Chris Evans are so adorable and funny as hell in this cute film. Its a typical rom-com, but it doesn't take itself seriously at all and its just delightful, trust me.

4960850,5,B0065N6IRK,"This comedy is funnier than the IMDB rating would suggest. It does have crude humor in it though. I thought it was funny because it was oddball humor and there were running gags. The comedy had maybe a predictable ending but the way that it was carried out was sweet and funny. I liked the acting and casting. It's hilarious that so many super heroes are in this. The style of humor is very similar to the type of jokes that Anna Faris and Chris Pratt seem to give off from their interviews. So, if you like that kind of humor, you will probably think this is funny. I am shocked by how many stars are in this movie. I never heard of this before but it is definitely an interesting light hearted romantic comedy.",1505001600,,712,4.281481481481482

I really love romantic comedies, the cheesier the better, and I really enjoy Anna Farris and Chris Evans as actors already anyways, but even if you don't agree with me....well then you wouldn't be watching this movie anyways. Instead, the people who ARE into these types of things will find a lot to like. It's funny, slightly raunchy, and the main couple has a sweet chemistry that is hard to fake.  No one is gonna go into this thing thinking it's gonna be the funniest thing they have ever seen, but if you wanna be entertained for about 2 hours with a nice cheesy feel good rom-com, and you've already watched all the other ones fifty times, I am sure this will be one to add to your list.",1435017600,,718,4.318518518518519

4960997,4,B0065N6IRK,"This was one of the many comedies which you see a trailer of and forget it came out, later on cable tv-totally underestimated. I thought it was fresh,different and pretty funny! Also, Anna and Chris had good chemistry. This is a different role for Chris Evans rather than his Captain America. In this one, he keeps up with the times and in Captain America, not so much. Also, he is the type of jerky character in the beginning and who knew he could sing and be funny too? Anna Faris was pretty good too. I liked her better in this than the House Bunny. She's a little off-beat, borderline crazy, but very passionate in this one. Basically, if she didn't try to find Mr. Wrong, who she thought was Mr. Right, she would've never found him-ironic! Maybe everything happens for a reason? Whether believing it does or not, great movie and goes to show you that you
shouldn't try to fix something that never really worked in the first place. Or, base a present relationship based on a mistakes made in the past, of a previous relationship. One of the best I've seen in a while!",1434067200,,1071,4.469387755102041

4961000,5,B0065N6IRK,I have to start by saying this is a typical romantic comedy and has little redeeming value other than it makes me laugh and I love the love story between Ally and Collin.  This is not a movie that was ever destined to win awards but I love it anyway.  I found it funny to see Ally's exes and her interaction with Collin.  I liked how their relationship started as friendship and grew naturally from their with both being themselves with no expectations of more. Plus Chris Evans is just nice to look at (a bonus to being a good actor) and this movie takes full advantage of that.,1433376000,2,579,4.293577981651376

4961008,4,B0065N6IRK,"Funnier than I expected.  This is a fairly standard rom- com- with some seriously funny moments.  Anna Faris does her thing and is cute.  There needed to be a bit more of the ""falling in love"" between the 2 characters. It was believable- but could have used more chemistry. It's a good rainy day time waster.",1431907200,,308,4.464285714285714

4961010,4,B0065N6IRK,"There's always a fine line between comically clumsy and unbelievably irritating, but Anna Faris does a good job of creating a likable lead. She's a little bit dense and a little bit silly, but you just can't help but root for her as she stumbles along and tries to figure out what it is she really wants. It doesn't help that she has a domineering mother who just doesn't *get* her ugly duckling daughter.

Chris and Anna have a fun chemistry between them. He doesn't really do anything groundbreaking in this role, but he looks like he's having a good time, and hey, that counts for a lot in these genre films. And yes, for all the Chris Evans fansthere is plenty of fan service to go around.

This movie is smart enough to keep the story simple. It doesn't get tangled in any statements about its characters respective socioeconomic statuses (very wealthy + ???), and it doesn't explore the double-standard that has Anna's character feeling like a slut for sleeping with 20 guys when Chris's lover count creeps into the 300s.

Forget all that. Just sit back and enjoy.",1431475200,,1070,4.621052631578947

4961066,5,B0065N6IRK,"I don't usually enjoy romantic comedies, but this one was actually really good. It probably helped a lot that you have these two extremely beautiful and talented stars headlining the movie, but the script itself was decent. Anna Farris and Chris Evans had great comedic chemistry here, and the supporting actors were great too. The premise of the story is: Farris realizes she has slept with a lot of men, and she doesn't want to increase that number so she does some (non-sexual) favors for her neighbor (Evans) in return for his help finding the men she has slept with. Farris is convinced that one of these men could be the one, and she wants to be rekindle a romance with one of them to keep her number down. Evans' father is a detective, and therefore has experience finding people who are difficult to track down. Needless to say, Farris and Evans falls in love along the way, but not before giving us some laughs.",1417392000,,920,4.581818181818182

4961074,4,B0065N6IRK,"Without Chris Evans, I wouldn't have watched the film and he's the reason it gets 4 stars instead of 3. The movie is fairly cliche--it's a rom com, after all, and hits every major plot point you would expect--including embarrassing scenes involving microphones. However, Evans is delightful in the film and has great chemistry with Anna Faris. The movie did have some funny moments--my favorites were the ones involving Chris Pratt. However, if you are a Chris Evans fan and would like to see him looking good and in a role that highlights his comedic timing, you should check this out. Just don't expect cinematic greatness.",1415836800,,625,4.90566037735849

4961091,5,B0065N6IRK,"I was really not expecting much from this movie -- I thought it sounded mediocre at best, and I only rented it because I wanted to see Chris Evans in a not-so-serious role. I'm happy to say I was completely wrong. This movie was hilarious and adorable, and not just because of the eye candy (not that I mind the eye candy at all!). I really enjoyed watching Ally transition from an insecure, panicked singleton to a woman who knows what she wants and believes she deserves to get it, even if the other people in her life disagree. Evans and Faris had crackling chemistry and terrific comic timing. I generally prefer couples who start out as friends, and this was no exception. Yeah, the ending is fairly predictable, but it's a rom-com, and sometimes that's why I watch rom-coms: because I want a happy ending.

The characters were pretty well fleshed out, and Ally's relationships with her family members don't take a back seat to her romantic life, which is rare in this genre. Best of all, while the movie starts off with Ally feeling guilty about the number of sex partners she's had, it ends with her learning to be OK with her past (even the icky parts) and optimistic about her future.

And really, the jokes are hilarious. Not a movie I'd show my mother, but also not nearly as raunchy as ""Bridesmaids"" -- this movie hit the sweet spot between too dirty and not quite dirty enough. I hope Evans does more movies in this genre, because he's a natural, and I would love to see Anna Faris as a leading lady again -- she more than proved here that she can pull it off. I rented this, but I'll be buying it promptly and strongly suspect it will join my regular rom-com rotation!

(Why five stars? It's not ""Citizen Kane"" or anything, but I'm rating based on my personal enjoyment of the film, not its objective quality. It's entertaining, and that's really all I ask.)",1410912000,,1872,4.5

With that said, Ann Faris is great and the movie has some funny points.  The lead male (I don't remember his name) is very flat as an actor and displays little to no acting talent.

If you're a fan of original, good romantic comedies, this is not a good movie. Anna Faris is great as usual and Chris Evans is both charming and, as I mentioned, naked. Other than that... meh. It's fine for a casual watch though and it's DEFINITELY worth it if you're thinking about watching it for Chris Evans.",1400284800,,421,4.48051948051948

4961136,5,B0065N6IRK,"... Which is not what I would expect to do for a rom com.

Chris Evans and Anna Faris are adorable together. The movie has all the elements of its genre - implausible situation, funny dialogue with some great visuals as well, mostly light-hearted story-telling, and a happy ending. There's even the time-honored parallel romance of a secondary couple. The activities by which the protagonist couple bonded were a little off the beaten track, which I really enjoyed. Best of all, the script and the performances showed, with a light and deft touch, the moments that, bit by bit, built a truly believable and meaningful relationship between the two protagonists.

Here, then, is why I enjoyed a second viewing and, though I originally only rented it, am now quite tempted to shell out the extra money to purchase. This movie works perfectly as a feel-good rom-com, but it is not fluff. Abusive family dynamics, performative femininity, double standards, the uneasy truce between friendship and flat out internecine warfare among girls and women when they form groups, predatory men and date rape - these are all touched on in Allie's odyssey, offered for thought if one wishes, but never pushed to the fore so stridently that a viewer can't skim over it if they prefer. There are no windy speeches, and yet, small comments, the wedding toasts, and final professions are deep enough to form a lump in the throat. I think Chris Evans is underrated as an actor, perhaps because he is so attractive. Anna Faris was brilliant, and the supporting cast made every moment of the movie believable and fun. Special kudos to Ari Graynor who was a great younger sister to Anna's Allie. These two actresses' sister chemistry really sparked.",1400025600,5,1725,4.904109589041096

4961143,5,B0065N6IRK,"In my opinion, there aren't enough sweet falling in love type movies these days. Most romances have a higher focus on the physical aspects of a relationship then they used to and come off a little trashy. This one does that also, so I wasn't expecting to like it. It's basically about a girl who reads an article saying that the higher number of sexual partners you have, the less likely you are to settle down and get married. Her number of partners is on up there, so she convinces her neighbor to help her track down her old boyfriends, in hopes that one of them has changed and will now be perfect for her. I won't give a way what happens. I will say that it ended well, and I found it a bit trashy but sweet at the end. All around it's a pretty feel good movie that's great for a rainy day. Plus, you get to see Chris Evans in very little clothing a lot. That alone makes it worth watching for the eye candy. I would recommend this. I don't think it's going to beat out a lot of romances that are out there, but it's worth watching if your a chick flick kind of person.",1397347200,,1074,4.119047619047619

Even though it's still predictable, it wasn't nauseating like the other 2011 rom coms 'No Strings Attached' or 'Friends with Benefits'.  Most rom coms are s***ty these days and any other actors in their place might've turned this into a bad movie but I think this is when typical formulaic storylines happen to decent actors.",1393804800,,489,4.867469879518072

The trailers made it look like one of the year's worst films, and I was prepared to add it to my list of The Worst Films of 2011.  The truth is that I was pleasantly surprised by the movie and am happy to report that I smiled more often than I scowled, chuckled more often than I groaned, and actually felt satisfied when it all ended.  After all of the nasty, so-called artsy fare I've sat through lately, a movie like What's Your Number was refreshing, if only because it was so upbeat and cheerful.

4961223,4,B0065N6IRK,"I went through a few of the reviews here trying to find something about the extended edition blu-ray but they are mostly about the movie itself (I was surprised to see so many hateful reviews too since the romantic comedy genre usually has a loyal following and no one else cares much for it, or at least I thought so) I assume if you just want to watch the movie, you can read the other reviews, but if you already watched it and are thinking about buying the Blu-ray extended edition then this review is for you ;)

I'm not a fan of romantic comedies but I gave this one a shot when it was playing on cable the other night, mainly because I really like Anna Farris, and Chris Evans is not hard to look at (and I was also surprised to see him in this kind of film... Captain America and all). As it turns out I really liked it. Its humor is right up my alley and I really had to laugh in my couch's pillows to not wake everyone up at my house when I was watching it (yes, some parts were THAT funny to me)

I went ahead and bought the blu-ray because I knew I could watch this movie over and over, but especially I wanted to see the extended edition because there were some spots here and there where editing definitely left a void in the plot (in my opinion) so I was very interested to see more flash-backs and more comedy.

I was dissapointed on this extra material for the most part. With the exception of a couple of good flash backs, one ""Deep-down-Collin-is-a-sweet-guy"" scene, the explanation of how Ally's bridesmaid dress goes from a one-shoulder fru-fru to strapless at the end of the movie, and a few other fillers that I really liked; the included extra footage in some scenes of the extended version makes Ally go from cute-clompsy girl to plain idiot (I don't think anyone would want to relate to a girl like that).

The gag reel was extremely short for a comedy, I was expecting waaaaaay more laughs and mess-ups, but it was cute to see people from the cast and crew answering the ""what's your number?"" question.

4961230,4,B0065N6IRK,"In What's Your Number?, the very funny Anna Faris plays Ally, a woman who comes across a magazine article saying that those who have had more than 20 lovers have a significantly lower chance of ever marrying. Ally is precariously close to this number and sets off on a quest to see if any of her past boyfriends have evolved into someone worthy marrying. Her neighbor, Colin (played by the gorgeous Chris Evans), helps her seek out her exes, and along the way becomes a closer friend to Ally.

Anna Faris is hilarious and I particularly enjoyed her antics throughout this movie. Her past boyfriends are also incredibly funny to watch (including a particularly creepy puppeteer played by Andy Samberg). I thought the chemistry between Ally and Colin was sizzling. As with most romantic comedies, it was clear how they movie was going to end within the first ten minutes of watching. However, I enjoyed it all the same!",1351209600,,917,4.767295597484277
4961231,3,B0065N6IRK,"In spite of its mixed messages about female sexuality, What's Your Number is surprisingly funny and even touching. Anna Faris plays Ally who hopes to find a date to her sister Daisy's (Ari Graynor) wedding. After reading that most women who have twenty or more sexual partners never settle down, she is determined that her next lay be ""the one."" To prevent raising the number of men she's slept with, Ally enlists the help of her philandering neighbor Colin (Chris Evans) to track down her exes hoping they improved over time.

One of the film's problems is its unintentional similarities to the superior Bridesmaids. The heroine has mixed feelings about a wedding, meets a man who encourages her to follow her artistic sensibilities, and struggles with unemployment. (""Struggles"" is an overstatement; considering their financial situations, these characters have remarkable apartments.) Even the opening scene contains a gag that is nearly identical to one in Bridesmaids.

Still, the movie is more irreverent and amusing than most romantic comedies. Farris is hilarious as Ally, a young woman who makes many mistakes but never runs out of optimism. Evans is fairly appealing as Colin, the obligatory rogue with a heart of gold. Since he admits that he can hardly spend time with a woman without trying to sleep with her, she doesn't consider him an option. Instead, she rendezvous with an assortment of ex-boyfriends and flings, played by a pleasing array of actors. A large part of the movie's appeal consists of her awkward interactions with men played by familiar faces such as Joel McHale, Chris Pratt, Zachary Quinto, Martin Freeman, and Anthony Mackie.

The film also focuses on Ally's relationship with her family. She feels out of place with her more conventional sister and perfectly coiffed mother, in spite of their close relationships. All this, of course, channels towards her inevitable lesson about love and being herself. Many women will identify with her grapples with relationship advice, the media, and questions about a ""normal"" modern woman's sexual appetites. The movie touches on the thin line between giving someone a chance and trying to force a relationship.

Unfortunately, the movie undermines some of its more progressive themes. It certainly includes sexist stereotypes, not to mention weightism. Ally is meant to be a disaster, but she often looks perfect and is shot sexually. (To be fair, Colin is naked throughout most of the movie.) When it comes down to it, though Ally doesn't fit into the film world, she is still a man's ideal woman. She isn't high maintenance, enjoys watching and playing sports (in one scene, she engages in a sexy one-on-one basketball game--in her underwear), and is up for almost anything.

There are definitely moments where the film crosses the line into poor taste. The whole thing is difficult to take seriously. The ""comedic"" music makes the movie feel as though it should have a laugh track. But What's Your Number ultimately conveys the ""life is messy: embrace it"" message with (mostly) good-natured humor.",1348876800,2,3076,5.1195219123505975

Watching him standing in the hallway of the apartment building and eating an apple with one hand and a towel covering a specific area with the other. He then dabs his mouth with the towel and if it weren't for a strategically placed object there would be nothing left to the imagination. Mine kicked in vividly.  Also, watching makes me want to play strip Horse. The way he eats a sandwich is also worth seeing. He is holy crap hot, and droolingly delicious to watch. He also is funny and has a fantastic smile and is comfortable with himself. He is a great actor too. I do go on, but it is nice that us ladies get some amazing male scenery to look at.

4961240,4,B0065N6IRK,"Perky Anna Faris has some serious comedic chops.  Whether it's physical, slapstick comedy or witty dialogue or even obscenity-laced party girl rogue, Faris makes all of it look easy (and easy on the eye).  And the rom-com WHAT'S YOUR NUMBER? is the perfect vehicle for Faris's many talents, as she plays slightly wild child Ally Darling, an unlucky-at-love free spirit who--with her baby sister's approaching nuptials--starts to feel that biological clock ticking, and decides it's time to get serious about finding Mr. Right; yet at the same time, concerned that her 20 prior bedroom partners might make her appear unseemly to a ""decent"" man, decides she'll look up the 20 former boyfriends to see if she's already met Mr. Right, and fall in love with him all over again.  For assistance, she enlists the aid of her neighbor Colin (a mega-buffed Chris Evans), an unemployed womanizer who always makes himself at home in Ally's apartment while he waits for the latest one-night-stand lady to awaken and leave his apartment.  Colin and Ally are platonic pals (or are they?) who enjoy hanging out together--from playing strip horse at Boston Garden to skinny dipping in Boston Harbor--yet every viewer happily watching these two knows exactly where this platonic friendship is going.

Faris and Evans have tremendous chemistry and the same level of (almost furious) energy.  They look like they had grand fun making WHAT'S YOUR NUMBER?, and it shows, and definitely pays off.  The supporting cast is solid, including the beautiful Ari Graynor as Ally's sister Daisy, a stoic Blythe Danner as Ally and Daisy's doting mother, Ed Begley Jr. as Ally and Daisy's free-spirited father, and a host of actors comprising the former beaus.  (By far the biggest hoot from moi came during the rendezvous with the former beau practicing gynecology.)  Charming, engaging, and clever, yet predictable as ever, WHAT'S YOUR NUMBER? is a fabulously fun adult romp.  No doubt Faris would be deliciously glorious to party with!

In fairness Anna Faris' Ally is a different character type than Kristen Wiig's Annie.  Whereas Ally is bubbly Annie was more neurotic.  There is also undeniable chemistry between Faris and Chris Evans.  My wife said Faris was married to Evans in real life but she wasn't sure.

I'm sorry, was I reviewing a movie? I got a little lost there.

A lot of the reviews I read were criticizing What's Your Number for being predictable, which confused me. It's a romantic comedy. Were you expecting Shakespeare? When I settle down for a rom com, I'm not looking to be shocked by the plot. I'm looking to laugh, root for the main characters, want the main characters to get together, drool over the male lead (and drool I definitely did, have you noticed?) as well as identify with the female one. I was able to do all of that, therefore I walked out of the movie theater content and pleased. I have recommended this movie to others and was very, very happy with it, going by that criteria. When I watch a rom com, I'm not looking to have my life changed, I just want to forget about everything for an hour and whatever minutes.

On that note, Chris Evans and Anna Faris were adorable together and did help me forget life for awhile. Faris was, for me, super relatable and flawless. The two had excellent chemistry and carried what could have been a better script. I have bought this movie and plan on squirreling it away for rainy days when I just want to curl up in bed and eat chocolate and appreciate the male form in all its wonder.

About 20 minutes or less into the movie, you can see the ending coming. That aside, it's a decent plot that could have been a good movie. I even think the acting is pretty good. My biggest issue with the movie that rather than making some of the situations cute, it goes for crass and explicit talk and references to sexual situations. I suppose for some people it's no big deal, but for me it made the movie a bit uncomfortable to watch.

The movie follows a girl who just lost her job and has just read an article about how women who have had more than 20 lovers have a hard time marrying. This leads to her contracting her womanizing neighbor to help her track down ex-boyfriends to see if they might have changed and might be the one for her to marry. This does lead to some comical situations, but it kind of peters out while other plot lines such as her sister's wedding and the back and forth between her and her neighbor take over. The ending is nice but quite predictable.

4961282,3,B0065N6IRK,"WHAT'S YOU NUMBER? is a flimsy bit of fluff based on the novel '20 Times A Lady' by Karen Bosnak and transformed for the screen by Gabrielle Allan and Jennifer Crittenden. It is a very light comedy that has some observations about today's dating/quasi-relationship scene, but those impressions are a bit too true to be funny, so it is best to just concentrate on the film as a diversion of the kick back, put feet up, and giggle along with it genre.

Ally Darling (!) (Anna Faris) has a history of having many ex-boy connections  who turned out to be losers. Reading an article that offers number amounts for judging sexual encounters (Ally has exceeded the norm) she freaks and believes that she can't find THE good guy. Deciding to reevaluate her ex-encounters searching for Mr Right, she decides to look up all of her exs to see if any of them have changed for the better. Finding this task daunting she turns to her apartment neighbor Colin Shea (Chris Evans), a would-be musician who sleeps with women every night and sneaks out the morning after to avoid relating to them, to act as her detective.  The rest is a contrived series of ups and downs of the manhunt that has few qualified candidates. And the end is predictable.

For once Anna Faris has snagged a role that shows her talent (and fingernails-on-the-blackboard voice) and she looks terrific.  But the biggest treat in the film is Chris Evans appearing in the buff often enough to keep the movie on: not only does he enjoy his Adonis body but he seems happy allowing it to buff up an otherwise routine comedy part.  There is another attraction in the wings - Oliver Jackson-Cohen - who seems to have a future in film.  Tuck in the always reliable Blythe Danner and Ed Begley, Jr and this is a cast worth an evening's outing.  But the treat on top of the confection is the eye candy generously shared by Chris Evans.

I am so glad I did.  From the start of the movie, I was laughing nonstop.  The comedy featured in this movie (which leans toward raunchy) isn't my usual style of comedy but for some reason, it really worked.  What I do like about this movie is that neither of the leads are ""perfect"".  There are so many rom-coms out there that make everything seem perfect, etc but this movie doesn't try to do that.

4961284,2,B0065N6IRK,"I floated between giving this 1 or 2 stars. I think at least .5 of a star came from Chris Evans, who is just delicious at all times. Honestly though, I really didn't like this movie. Anna can either be cute or really awkward and abrasive, and she fell into the latter alot of this movie. If the movie would have pushed the comedy harder (or maybe they thought they did :/), it would have turned out better, because Anna does better when she's being goofier. When you have a premise such as how many people you've had sex with, you kind of just have to go for it, and this movie kind of made it uncomfortable to watch when it didn't have to be.
Some of the meant to be comedic moments (i.e. the wannabe senator asking her to be the straight wife to him as a gay husband, and Jole Hale smelling his fingers *gag*) were just downright sad. The only thing likeable was Chris and his arc, which they managed to do pretty well. The time was also way too long; the version I watched clocked in at 1:45, way too long for a movie like this.
If you like romcoms and/or raunchy gal humor..don't even bother trying this to see if you like it unless you just want to stare at Chris. My library copy didn't work, so I spent $.74 at Redbox, and that was a bit too much for this, lol.

Honestly, I didn't even watch the last twenty minutes as the script was just so laughable (not in the good way) that I went and boiled my own head instead.

Here, Faris plays Ally Darling, a recently unemployed woman who comes to the realization she's slept with a lot more men than other women have. Hoping to put a cap on that number, Ally revisits her old boyfriends to see if any of them have grown into permanent relationship material.

However, I'm a firm believer that the brilliant comedic stylings of Anna Faris can make just about ANY movie watchable, and in this case, despite a so-so storyline, her impeccable track record continues.

In a nutshell, Faris plays a woman who, after reading a magazine article which suggests the number of men she has slept with makes her statistically less likely to ever settle down and find ""the one,"" decides to revisit her old lovers in the hopes of snaring one of them back in for good. True, it is kind of a hokey premise, but not as ""been there, done that"" as some other plot devices I can think of. Chris Evans is very likeable (not to mention awfully yummy) as her neighbor who is in on her plans and helps her along, though eventually discovers he might just have some romantic feelings for her himself. Is it predictable? Very much so. Do romantic comedy cliches abound? Of course. But the two leads do have great chemistry, and with the plethora of wacky characters encountered along the way there are plenty of clever one-liners and naughty catchphrases you'll probably find yourself repeating in conversation the next day. So while ""What's Your Number?"" didn't break any new ground, I don't think it necessarily strived to, either.

Unfunny hijinks ensue.

The quality of the acting is terrible. The story is terrible and doesn't hang together at all. The movie runs like a series of SNL vignettes, of which there are about 20 mini stories. And like SNL, they aren't funny and they run on too long.

The cultural references are incredibly trendy now, but this throwaway movie is going to be incredibly dated 3 years from now when the next-best-thing has replaced Google, Facebook, and Twitter. If you are reading this review in any year after 2012, be aware this movie will look ridiculous.

In the last few years it means the raunchiest forms of sexual humor the writers can drum up - as in junior high locker room level and worse. The main character, as portrayed as raised by upper society Bostonians, was a completely unbelievable back story given the character's portrayal as essentially a very crude minded slut - but of course one with a good heart (presumably that makes any character palatable for us to identify with).

Anna Faris has definite potential as a comedic actress, but even if she was cast into higher quality material than this film, I'll always be tainted by the characterization she portrayed here (ugh). It was her career choice, of course.

What's Your Number? has moments of depth and meaning where the characters are introspective and very Sparks-esque. And then there are moments filled with crude, laugh-out-loud, bust a gut incidents and reactions. Anna Faris, as usual (see The House Bunny) nails each moment with the best comedic timing out there.
The supporting cast includes Blythe Danner, Ed Begley Jr, Joel McHale (from The Soup)

Also, for anyone contemplating whether or not to purchase this movie to see Chris Evans, there are countless times where he appears barely clothed. Additionally, he's surprising good in romantic comedies-- so if you only saw him in Fantastic Four or Captain America, have no fear -- he's a perfect match for Anna Faris.

If you enjoy the occasional romantic comedy, this is better than most out there. For comparison, it blew Something Borrowed, Valentine's Day, Bride Wars, and most recent rom-coms out of the water. It was somewhat comparable to Going the Distance (with Drew Barrymore) in terms of being well-written and having depth yet being really funny and having a great supporting cast.

One last note: even though it's a rom-com, and wouldn't typically be considered a demo-disc for a blu-ray/ hi-def presentation, there are scenes that are spot-on for blu-ray/hi-def viewing. (Beach scenes and outdoor scenes are incredibly crisp and detailed.)
