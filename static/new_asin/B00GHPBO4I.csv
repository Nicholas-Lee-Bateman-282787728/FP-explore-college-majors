6076448,5,B00GHPBO4I,"Good story line, and fun characters! There's nothing like the good 1930's mystery movies! Worth watching and worth watching again!",1505001600,8,130,5.55
6076449,2,B00GHPBO4I,"I always ask: Is the dialogue well written, and was it worth my time. The writing improved greatly with the words: ""The End"" and I'm grateful that even though it seemed like an eternity, it wasn't.

6076450,5,B00GHPBO4I,"Gotta love these old black & white murder mysteries. This one has exceptional plot, pacing, the unexpected, with a bit of humor & romance thrown in. It had its moments of humor such has ""the body's gone & so is the rug."" And it was great to see Reginald Owen, aka ""Scrooge,"" at a younger time. This story was better than today's murder mysteries with blood & gore--just a clean murder mystery with the happily solved & ever afters in the end.",1503705600,13,442,4.402439024390244
6076451,4,B00GHPBO4I,"A neat little murder mystery. Certainly not Hitchcock but well directed, good plot, good script and good acting. Of course when you watch these one-hour depression era movies you have to know what your getting yourself in for but if you like good 'ol murder mysteries with the good guy wins and gets the girl, this is one of the better ones I've seen.",1503360000,17,351,4.5

8623327,3,B00GHPBO4I,"Clever little thirties mystery. I found it enjoyable and interesting as a hour's entertainment. Re the comment on the quality of the video: My copy was clear and easy on the eyes; a fine job of digital remastering. The sound, however, was very noisy and unpleasant to listen to. One wonders why some filtering wasn't used to clean up the audio.",1531008000,,344,4.655737704918033
8623328,3,B00GHPBO4I,"Alistair Sim is good in his first role (if the the DVD cover is correct) as is Basil Sydney ( the lead character in the film).  The other actors/actresses are not so good.  The plot is too complex for 64 minutes, the screen play is predictable.  The film print is 83 years old and looks like it.",1527984000,,295,4.140350877192983
8623329,2,B00GHPBO4I,"Another irritating reporter above the law mystery. Same stupid premise; cops are bumbling fools and only the street-savvy reporter can solve the quandary by withholding evidence and other acts of self serving mischief. Hollywood buckmasters, lacking originality, copy everything the others produce. So now we're stuck with about a dozen of these. The reporter characters are never likeable, male or female. I often find myself wishing they would be the next victim. I wanted this one to get it early on.

2 of the murders in this mystery were committed with a small caliber pistol fired blindly into the room. The first was only the gun peeking around the edge of the door. It looked a sock puppet snake with  a pistol for a head. The second was through a mail slot. Some right fancy shootin', there pard.  Must be the bullets; heart-seeking or something.

Fans of Murder She Wrote or the portryal of Miss Marple, where she's more like a busy-body snoop. [Margaret Rutherford?] would probably be okay with this.",1527552000,,1011,4.894736842105263
8623330,4,B00GHPBO4I,"Lots of murders for a short movie. Of course there is not the blood and gore like today's films, but who needs that. The two leads are just great. Good interaction and a nice romance too. As the corpses pile up, it becomes apparent that a money must be the motive. How does the murderer come and go so quickly and who will benefit in the end. The Brits can do murder so well and with charm. Sit back and enjoy a cup of tea as the story unfolds.",1526083200,,444,4.0
8623331,4,B00GHPBO4I,"Very weak story and poor transfer to DVD.  Weak storyline, as well.",1524700800,,67,4.583333333333333
8623332,5,B00GHPBO4I,I loved this movie. It was really fun watching it. A very nice murder mystery.,1523318400,,78,4.266666666666667

8623334,4,B00GHPBO4I,"I like old movies & whodunits, so, this fits the bill nicely for me.  Also, I find audio in the movies to be lots better & clearer than movies made today.  Curious, indeed!",1517011200,3,172,4.181818181818182
8623335,4,B00GHPBO4I,"This was a good, short little British ""whodunit.""  The Brits always seemed to know how to do a mystery with a bit of dry humor.  And, of course, this era film always adds a touch of love at first sight romance.  Light and enjoyable mystery.",1516579200,4,240,4.288888888888889
8623336,4,B00GHPBO4I,"Nice black and white murder mystery with enjoyable characters, particularly the male and female leads. Good pacing with a fairly tidy ending that wraps up in its hour long duration.",1514937600,4,181,5.066666666666666
