8266389,2,B0017LFKTW,"As the title suggests, From The Ground Up explores the way in which coffee makes the journey from bean on the tree to cup in your hand. This promising topic is unfortunately mishandled by Su Friedrich who manages to craft a documentary which although visually interesting at times, fails to cogently convey a narrative that informs remotely as well as it might. Moreover, the perplexing choice to use one very annoying song played over and over again (mostly in endlessly repeated truncated segments) as the background theme music for the visuals rendered this film unwatchable after a while. Overall, From The Ground Up represents a disappointing exercise in documentary film-making which is probably best avoided.",1251331200,,715,5.226086956521739
8266390,1,B0017LFKTW,"This is amateur hour the whole way. One has no idea where the filming takes place until close to the end. The processes of cultivation and brewing are not explained. The ""film maker"" is stuck on one song repeated endlessly throughout. It's a complete mess. It looks as if it was a middle school project done by someone who never picked up a camera in her life. There is nothing educational or interesting about this DVD. Don't waste your money.",1237248000,,444,4.5625
