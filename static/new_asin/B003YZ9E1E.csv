7626596,5,B003YZ9E1E,"It is an old one but excellent if you are a WWII buff like myself.  I loved it.  It was not only a good drama, it was also rather humorous too.  It is about 2 women: one American and one British: who lived in France prior to the start of the war.  They wound up stumbling upon the need for people to smuggle downed British and American air plane pilots out of occupied France.  Since the two women were best friends, they went into the endeavor together and, at first, were rather clumbsy about it.  In the end, they wound up saving nearly 260 pilots and bearly escaped execution themselves.  I think you will enjoy it if you don't mind watchin old black and whites..",1389571200,4,667,4.288
7626597,5,B003YZ9E1E,"I had never heard of this movie before and thought I would give it a go just for the  truly bizarre pairing of Constance Bennett and Gracie Fields as co-stars and  I am so glad I did as this is a great movie.
True ,its very much a ""B"" movie in terms of production  - lots of back projection and sparse sets - but the story of 2 women helping to smuggle soldiers out of occupied France is entertaining and well acted and makes up for the cheap production values.
The 2 stars play really well together and are really well cast as a couple of friends.
Give this a go you will be pleasantly surprised.",1376611200,,597,4.129310344827586
7626598,4,B003YZ9E1E,"A good movie, but read book after viewing.  After seeing movie you will feel good, after reading the excellent book you will have several emotions, sad, and glad for the two women in the story.  Constance Bennett, the director, was the wife of my boss (an AF General), when I a new 2nd Lt in AF in 1962 and was a great lady and a lot of fun.  She told me one time that the studio made her change story line to be acceptable to public at time.",1310774400,3,442,4.0
7626599,3,B003YZ9E1E,"The actors speak in kind of a phony high toned British sound when they are supposed to be French and American, which is kind of disappointing. The costuming is good. The story is okay, but I can't really like the main character; she's kind of a jerk.",1252022400,,250,4.340425531914893
7626600,4,B003YZ9E1E,"I bought this tape because I met Gracie Fields in the 1950's and she was incredibly sweet. I told her that my mother thought she was dead and cried every time she was on TV, and would she call my mom and let her know she is alive. She called my mom and even invited my mom to visit her on Capri which she did 3 times. So I loved every minute of this movie. And it has a lot of originality too.",1248825600,5,393,3.746987951807229
7626601,3,B003YZ9E1E,"I received a certain lightness of faint pleasure while viewing this film.  I couldn't get into the spirit of the story of these two women, however, because, despite the fact that they were charming actresses and engaging in their personas, I kept seeing Nazi monsters lurking in the woods or behind the doors, ready to pounce on them and do their evil.  Yes, this created the feeling of suspense and apprehension so needed in this kind of film but I unfortunately grew up when these ogres were real, lurching across the oceans in our direction and so became the subjects of nightmares for us youngsters.  At best, I could only smile speculatively at the goings-on in this film.  It was all too easy, sort of like the bother of having to remove a spot from one's skirt before appearing at dinner.  Constance was a knockout and Grace was superb at underacting.",1430611200,,858,4.655629139072848
7626602,5,B003YZ9E1E,"Surprised as to how good a movie this is. I wasn't familiar with the actors. Great choice for those interested in WWII, especially those interested in the French Resistance.",1427328000,,173,5.0

7626607,5,B003YZ9E1E,Truly enjoyable movie about Paris underground resistance during the Nazi invasion. A real edge-of-the-seat portrayal of women working to help end the war. Buy this!,1417392000,,164,5.6
7626608,4,B003YZ9E1E,"Love these old WWII underground -  type movies - this was a swell one!  And as petty as this sounds :  what happened  to those little Poodles?  I hate when that happens; characters or animals disappear w/out any explanation.  Did Nazis eat them or line them up against wall blindfolded, kneel down & shoot them?  (Don't mean to be disrespectful - I know what unsung heroes those brave people were.)",1406851200,3,398,4.6
7626609,5,B003YZ9E1E,"A wonderful nostalgic, WW II film, that was pretty true to the book, from which this story was derived.  Wonderful performances, from Constance Bennett, and Gracie Fields..  Also a very strong supporting  cast.  The plot was fast moving, and exciting, but only giving a small impression, of what it was like, to be under Nazi occupation, and its  impact on the citizens, of France.  The movie underscores, the involvement  and the danger, of so many, in the rescue of hundreds of ""downed"" air force personal, under the nose of the Germans, in order to fight another day.",1400630400,5,570,4.814432989690721
7626610,3,B003YZ9E1E,"This film is unjustly neglected, though it's readily available on DVD. Other comments here give a good plot summary, so I'll just comment on the film's strength's and weaknesses. The main weakness is that for what is basically a spy film, the suspense isn't very suspenseful -- it kept occurring to me how much better Hitchcock would have done it. But on the positive side the film is otherwise well directed, with very good acting (especially by Gracie Fields) vividly realizes the atmosphere of both Paris and the French countryside, and is beautifully photographed by Lee Garmes, one of the best Hollywood cinematographers. The ending turns surprisingly moving, and the score is one of the better ones of its time. I'd call it a film of broad interest which everyone will be glad to have seen once, especially if you appreciate good cinematography.  The DVD transfer is ok.",1391040000,7,876,4.918918918918919

8749827,4,B003YZ9E1E,"I've watched this a few times, and each time I enjoyed it more than the last time. The dramatization was clever and funny.  In spite of the seriousness of the topic, these people were great, and showed courage and tenacity.",1498608000,,223,4.575
8749828,4,B003YZ9E1E,This was such a cute movie. The characters in were so funny. The plot line was perfect and you never expect the ending. The layout they use is perfect for the era it's focused in and the actors were perfect in there roles.,1473033600,,222,4.186046511627907

8749831,3,B003YZ9E1E,This movie is based on actual events and is interesting for that reason but the script is showing its age. A modern version of this story would beich more interesting.,1449014400,,167,4.6
8749832,5,B003YZ9E1E,Bennett and Fields are absolutely superb! A very involving film that makes you care about the characters and the story line. Fields last film and one of her best. Very well-done character studies with an involving plot.,1444348800,2,219,4.945945945945946
8749833,1,B003YZ9E1E,"The book, written in 1943 by one of the women who lived it, was excellent.  The movie diverged greatly from the book and was somewhat silly in parts.  The movie was not worth watching.  Read the book for the real history.",1439251200,,221,4.341463414634147
8749834,4,B003YZ9E1E,"The term wasn't in use at the time, but this is a 1945 ""Chick Flick,"" and a very good one, too. Constance Bennett, looking for all the world like an earlier incarnation of Reese Witherspoon, offers the viewer a time-stamped definition of ""spunk,"" while Gracie Fields brings to the role of Bennett's heroic co-conspirator all the bravura one could expect from a veteran Music Hall comedienne and singer. The cinematographers did a remarkable job of recreating the look and feel of war-time Paris and the Occupied Zone of France with file film, process shots and studio mockups. Equally remarkable is the fact that all the occupying Germans, down to the lowliest private, speak English! It's clever and funny, but some of the bold strokes, such as the years of imprisonment the leads suffer, seem a bit too ripe for modern tastes. But, what the hey! Let yourself go.",1438992000,2,864,4.844594594594595
8749835,4,B003YZ9E1E,"PLOT: The invasion of France has and English woman and an American Woman..... helping downed pilots~ very good

Nazi Germany has just ""invaded France"" and gal pals Gracie Fields and Constance Bennett~ flee Paris. The inn they stop at has an English Flyer in hiding. They hide him the trunk of the car and end up with German officers changing their flat tire and escort them home. They end up smuggling him out of Paris and become part of the 'Underground' with helping ""downed"" pilots escape the Germans. This was released as the ""Madame Pimpernel"" and Bennett even produced it. Gracie Fields is excellent as the ""antique shop"" owner with plenty of spunk. This is a very LOW budget and it shows but a fun watch. Bennett is lovely as always. I give it 4 STARS~",1438473600,,759,4.580882352941177
