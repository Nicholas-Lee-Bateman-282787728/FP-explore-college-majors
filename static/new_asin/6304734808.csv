931316,3,6304734808,"This film was primarily financed/made as a adult film starring a once Hollywood darling
Looking back at it now the film is super ahead of it's time on a pop culture level
Pre-leaked celebrity sex tapes, celebs posting on twitter, and icloud leaks
But, the film is also a super depressing piece of film
Dana Plato was at a super low point in her life far from healthy and clean
and the director/producers of this pretty much exploited her
super talented actress that was done in by her personal demons
If you ever heard Plato's last interview the day before she died on the Howard Stern show it'll make you cringe and a bit sad
Her death at 34 years old is very sad and the aftermath would effect her only son

If you wanna see a once Hollywood darling in a cheap adult film here it is
Both cuts the rated R and Unrated cut are a horrible cheap indie film with nudity and sex thrown in to sell the film
Even if you consider this film a cheap adult film it's poorly made and has super low production values
It is what it is in pop culture",1452729600,11,1036,4.206030150753769

931323,3,6304734808,"This review is for the R rated version on VHS:
The films plays well, and for not having an 'unrated' label it's fairly generous with the skin. There are only a couple of good barefoot shots. The story line (yes there actually is one!) holds together pretty well, and the nudity is not the cheesy gratuitous kind; it all fits well into the story line. It would have got another star in the rating if they'd left a little less to the viewer's imagination, but hey... it was made in a more censor-strict era, after all.",1281744000,3,516,4.385416666666667
931419,5,6304734808,"There are two versions of this movie available on DVD: there is the 88-minute unrated version; and there is the 75-minute ""R"" rated version. When buying this movie on DVD, be sure to ask the seller which version it is. Otherwise, you may end up with the edited version, which omits most of the nude scenes. The 88-minute unrated version features nudity, and lots of it; some of which is very explicit. In fact, the movie received an X rating. One of the other reviewers had said that the unrated version was not available on DVD. This is not true, as I own the unrated edition on DVD. Another reviewer said the unrated version was not available in the United States, which is inaccurate. I bought the unrated version in the states right before it went out of print. The movie is still available from a small number of third party sellers on amazon, but they often make no distinction regarding which version they are selling. So be sure to ask the seller if it is the unrated version, unless for some reason you want the edited ""R"" rated version.
 As far as my rating of this movie is concerned, I had trouble deciding, so I just gave it 5 stars. It is really a matter of your own personal views. If you are watching this movie for its great storyline and good acting, you may be disappointed. Not that the acting itself was bad, but the point is that most people buy this movie for the nudity and not for its great storyline. So it all boils down to this: If you enjoy seeing nudity, you will probably enjoy seeing this movie, as it features lots of steamy scenes. Just be sure to get the unrated version.",1232755200,17,1606,4.389261744966443
931420,2,6304734808,"I bought the unrated dvd because I'm a Dana Plato fan.  When I started the movie, I was stunned by the opening scene.  It was for some actress named Pandora Peaks.  I was like, what is this?  There were two other women too who where gyrating and wiggling and acting disgusting.  I'm not going to go into detail what they were doing.

Dana Plato was desperate when she decided to make this movie.  First, she really doesn't look that great naked compared to the busty women that also appeared in the movie.

The movie opens with her arriving at an airport.  She appears to be loaded.  She must have taken something just before they said ""action"".  She arrives at a house of the man she will be shooting pictures with.  He has a terrible body and he should keep his clothes on.

Landon Hall comes in and her eyes meet Dana's.  I'm sure Landon was thinking, I can sure do a lot better than this girl.  In the pool scene, Dana is pasty white and very scrawny with a pasty butt.  Also she had a weird smile on her face in the pool and her eyes were sunken in I'm sure from the drugs.  You could tell she had really lived a hard life.  She looked much older than her actual age.

She looked good in the shower scene.  However, what was kind of gross like her Playboy pictures, she is very bushy, you know where.  That really grosses me out.  Other than this and the closeups of her face, she looks good.

In one scene, she is calling her girlfriend who doesn't answer.  Her girlfriend is cheating on her with another woman.  Her girlfriend is very young and beautiful.  Her girlfriend's lover asks, who was that on the phone?  The girlfriend should have responded, ""Oh, just some girl who can't seem to move beyond Different Strokes.""

One very confusing scene for me was when Dana and Landon were in bed together.  Dana goes down under the covers so we can only see Landon who is moaning.  I have no idea what was going on here.  I'm assuming that Landon had a bad stomach ache from eating at the mexican restaurant.  If I were Dana, I would not want to be under the covers in case Landon has bad gas.

Also, her hair and outfits were terrible.  I'm a Dana Plato fan and can't understand why she styled her hair in such an unflattering way.  Also some of the outfits were ridiculous.  Look at the image on the cover of the box to see the dumpy outfit she is wearing.

She definitely had acting ability.  If she had lived, she could comment on TrueTV about dumb criminals. Didn't anyone ever try anti-depressants on her?  It makes me sad to think of someone being in such pain.  Illegal drugs/alcohol don't work.  I wish I could have hugged her.",1196294400,5,2639,4.336755646817249
931421,5,6304734808,"Do not discount this movie, nor write it off before actually seeing it. This is really a lesbian love story tenderly told. First of all, in order to get the most enjoyment from this movie you need to buy UNRATED. I followed the advice of other reviewers and bought this through the U.K web site, even though the movie was sent to me through an American company. Weird how it works that way. But I didn't want to risk getting a butchered version, so I bought U.K. I was charged 15 pounds (or is that Euros?), which translates into 28 American dollars. It is worth every cent I paid. I absolutely ADORE this movie. Jack (Bentley Mitchum) is a photographer involved in a steamy relationship with Jill (Landon Hall), but he seems to treat her ""like a piece of meat"". The other Jill (Dana Plato) is an art director who arrives from New York to work with Jack on a fashion catalog featuring beautiful models. Jack starts pressuring his girlfriend into going along with a menage a trois with the other Jill. But she keeps telling him ""no"". What he doesn't realize is that his girlfriend is fantasizing about Jill as much as Jill is fantasizing about her. While at a restaurant the two Jills perform a tango dance that is really adorable. Dana, it would seem, had quite a talent for dancing the lead in the tango. Their dance is one of the gems in this movie. But Jack is turned on by their dancing, and once again, pressures his girlfriend into going along with his plan. She gets upset and storms out of the restaurant. Jill follows her all the way home. What evolves between the two of them is very tender and affectionate. There is nothing dirty going on between them. It is love and tenderness that you see. Dana, apparently, was very comfortable playing the woman experienced in lesbian affairs. It shows on screen. But I was also impressed with Landon Hall. She plays her role effectively. When Jack finds out his girlfriend is ""going AC/DC on him"" he is predictably upset and not a little jealous. This story is told realistically. There are even some comedic scenes in this movie. It is tender, realistic, and at times, humorous. And yet...when you see Dana in this movie you can't help but feel a tremendous amount of compassion and sadness for her. One scene in particular makes me cry every time I see it. If you saw the E True Hollywood Story about her that aired in 1999 you know she was shocked when they decided to rate this movie ""X"". She really did not deserve the way some people treated her. And towards the end of the movie you notice the scars on her left wrist. So sad that her life had to end the way it did.",1108684800,13,2624,4.446058091286307
931422,4,6304734808,"After reading the above review I decided to look over at the Amazon.uk site and found the ""unrated"" version of this movie. Plenty of steamy scenes and, though I never saw the VHS version, I don't think much was cut. I would have liked to have seen alot more raunch, down & dirty with Dana Plato but it wasn't like I came away disappointed. One just need be careful to buy ""unrated"" and since the US has many hang-ups in that area, one might need to buy certain titles from Amazon outside the US.",1070755200,26,495,4.276595744680851
931423,1,6304734808,"I had seen this Film previously, and enjoyed it. So When I bought it, I expected to see the film again. I did not. There are entire scenes missing. And I am bitterly dissapointed. If I had bought this in the UK, I would be protected by the trade descriptions act. As I bought it from the US site, I think I have been done out of my hard earned cash. Suffice to say, don't buy this film.... cause you want get what you paid for.",1037664000,16,427,3.9767441860465116
931424,5,6304734808,This movie was spectacular because aside from being the best actress ever she is also the hottest woman ever. I recomend this for any Dana Plato fan.,991872000,8,149,4.555555555555555
931425,1,6304734808,"I have seen this film on Tv in England and it was nearly uncut, with all the very hot scenes between Plato and Hall intact. Yet on the DVD version, strangely most of the scenes were cut! as if anyone would wish to buy the  film for the storyline!, Anyway, I was disappointed with the rating, and  hope the studio would reissue the film unrated, and with some extras as  well, as we come to expect from any DVD release.",946425600,53,418,4.2

At any  rate, I taped it on Cinemax and that most likely is the VHS  version.
Landon Hall (she has a web page with pictures by the way (write  to me at the above email address and I'll send it to you gratis), is a real  favorite of mine.  She is the type of woman I call astonishingly beautiful.  A pretty good actress too.",936576000,10,498,4.020408163265306

7877832,1,6304734808,"I'm a history teacher for 10th grade students.  We're talking about past television series as it related to US History.  For about 2 weeks, we focused on the 1980s.  I wanted to show them an episode of Different Strokes trying to look for the episode with Nancy Reagan, but trying to at least show 1 episode from the series and include in my lesson.  I was excited that this was on Amazon.  But, within 3-5 minutes of it starting, I heard the students started laughing.  I looked up, and this is not the right Different Strokes.  It has Dana Plato, but no Gary Coleman or Todd Bridges or Conrad Bain.  In fact this isn't appropriate at all and has no age-restricted warnings.",1523491200,,675,4.475409836065574

7877834,1,6304734808,"Basically, this is a film that bashes heterosexual men, and is very hypocritical. Jack is demonized for wanting to have sex with his girlfriend yet JIll Martin (Dana Plato) is celebrated for wanting to have sex with Jack's girlfriend. Dana PLato's character is just as guilty, if not more, of everything the film accuses Jack of. There is too much nudity and not enough story. The film is more akin to a bad adult movie than a movie with a good storyline; unless you just want to see nude, lesbian scenes skip this one.",1510704000,2,519,4.531914893617022

7877836,3,6304734808,"I only watched this because I saw Dana Platos name, I never knew she made a movie as an adult, I thought her acting days were over after the sitcom. So it turns out to be soft porn and all I could think of was how sad this was what her son will have to remember his mother in her only (I'm guessing) adult acting job. As for the movie, well, it's most likely what one would expect, B-Rated, mediocre actors and a slow dull storyline without anything meaningful substance.",1509321600,,471,4.2444444444444445
