8503733,4,B006SFLYAQ,"About a week or so ago, I purchased this double-feature movie packet of ""Police Academy"" and ""Police Academy 2"" off the bargain rack at the nearby Wal-Mart store. It's a nicely done set. The two movies are recorded on two separate DVDs and nicely packaged. Both worked flawlessly. I reviewed both movies separately and here I'll sum up and review the package.

The premise for both movies is the same, as are the actors. The mayor of a large city felt that entry into the city's police system was too restricted and she eliminated almost all qualifications for those wanting to enter into the city's Police Academy. Naturally, the flood gates were open to a host of ""non-traditional"" entrants. The first movie follows their progress through the Police Academy up almost to the time of graduation and includes a first emergency assignment during a city riot that couldn't have gone much more wrong.

In the followup movie, the same rag-tag crew has graduated and are now added to the city's police force. The lucky city. Well, do you think that things are going to go well? Think again. This same rag-tag force is now out helping to solve crimes and stop crimes as they are taking place. It's a modern-day version of the Keystone Kops, and it's funny.

You'll probably enjoy these movies if you like gut-level, very physical, slapstick-like comedy. The acting is highly exaggerated and rather poor, but a lot of the movies are directed toward highly visual comedy, not cerebral comedy. The movies are funny. You'll get a lot of laughs. Watch them when you feel the need for a few gut-level laughs. These are not serious stories. Don't take them seriously or you'll be disappointed. I thought the First was the best and rated it as four stars, whereas the Second was not quite as good and I gave it three stars.
