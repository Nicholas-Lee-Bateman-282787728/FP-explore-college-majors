1804640,5,B00007AJEM,"The object is to move, and this DVD definitely delivers. Rania gets the body moving and the choreography is easy to follow. She has at least seven routines through the workout and, with repetition, you learn each move before she switches to the next one. By the time you're through, one move flows to the next. Keep up with her and you'll burn calories. It's also nice that she includes not just one, main routine but another 'bonus' routine as well.",1242086400,,450,4.567901234567901
1804641,3,B00007AJEM,the instructor keeps staring at me -- still the work out was fun and my kids had fun dancing around the room too,1233792000,,112,3.9130434782608696
1804642,4,B00007AJEM,"L. Hawkins ""Laura Wilde"" wrote a great review 1/2005.
I disliked Rania's previous 4 disk set because the music was faked & boring, she moved slow & stiffly, she would repeat the same move so many times, you'd only learn about 4-6 moves in 30 min & the background dancers looked bored. The good thing about it was she would teach you 1/2 several times & normal speed several times.
This is her best other then her ""personal trainer"" (since then it's ok if dance stiffly since it's like a gym workout) As L. Hawkins said, it's fast paced, you get your heart rate up, the dancers are more fluid, though occasionally I saw a bored expression towards the end & the moves stringed together felt pretty good. She gives good instructions, telling you the move, how to do it & dancer's 8 count to stay on beat.
She moves stiffly still, but it's so fast, you barely notice other then making sure you're keeping up.
The warm up even includes several types of figure 8s, the routine has hip drops & w/leg lift, hip drops 3x, hip bumps w/step back, hip twists & shimmies, a slow turn, hip back, vertical figure 8s & couple more moves.
The cool down is nice & slow with sitting fwd bend & more.
The bonus 9 min workout is more gym drill style which is more her style that will really tone you fast.

1804643,4,B00007AJEM,"Other people have already gone bit by bit in explaining what is in the dvd, so I'm basically going to reiterate it's def. a workout movie with bellydance-esque flavor. You do learn some cute moves if you are a bellydance novice, but do not depend on it for learning. You do get a satisfactory workout from it if you're not used to the moves, though. I personally have found I was more toned.",1186185600,,391,4.36986301369863
1804644,5,B00007AJEM,"Great!!!!

You do have to know basics in belly dancing. I love this DVD, and have seen the results fast.

Depending, on my schedule I try to use it at least 4 times a week in combination with a sculpting DVD.",1184889600,,208,4.048780487804878
1804645,5,B00007AJEM,"This is the best of the Rania workouts.  The music was a great step up from the poorly polytonic music in the other series.  I recently purchased the initial box set and found it was too slow for me.  Because there is no instructional directions in this video for the movements, I suggest anyone who feels the movements are too hard, try checking out Rania's box series.  Ever step that is performed in ""Too Hip"" is taught in the either Pure Sweat, Cardio Shimmy, Hip Hop Drop, or Bellydance Boogie at a slower in depth pace.",1172880000,,525,4.4375
1804646,5,B00007AJEM,I just got this DVD yesterday and could not wait to try it. I enjoyed it so much. It is not for beginners it is an intermediate workout like it says on the cover. You will get a great workout by the time it is over you will be sweating bullets I guarantee that. I workout 6 days a week and this one really got me sweating. Today I feel kind of sore but the good way. Highly recommended.,1167264000,,386,3.8987341772151898
1804647,5,B00007AJEM,"And you'll need plenty of dance room.  This one assumes you already have experience with the moves since Rania doesn't take the time to demonstrate.  She just jumps right in.

I love the warm up on this one and will do it in place of some of the others.  There is an extra workout and a couple of performances.  The 'choose your screen' feature is kind of annoying but that is a very minor complaint.

Overall I think this is a good one for someone who's already familiar with the moves and isn't as much of a beginner as I am.",1165622400,,527,4.1683168316831685
1804648,5,B00007AJEM,"I think I was smiling the entire time through this DVD--I had a GREAT workout and I had fun doing it! Granted, I have been a fan of Rania for awhile now. If you've never done bellydance before, this isn't the one to start with, as there is little in the way of instruction in this DVD. ""My Personal Trainer"" is a much better one to start with. This is geared toward the bellydancer with some experience under her belt who wants a great cardio workout. However, if you've had a bit of instruction before, you should be able to keep up, as she does lots of repetitions before moving on to the next combo. There are a total of 7 combos, which all get strung together into a 35-minute workout that keeps your heart rate up, targets major muscle groups (except maybe the arms), and is FUN!!!",1155340800,,786,4.3175675675675675
1804649,4,B00007AJEM,"Your inner goddess may feel a little shy at the start of this specific routine. Not only are the moves quite sexy, they can at times make you feel like you are ""strutting your stuff,"" which may or may not appeal to you depending on whether you enjoy people watching you dance or you like to dance for your own pleasure. The sensuality seems a little more overt and this routine has some sultry moves.

At first the routine relies on traditional favorites, figure eights and snake arms. Then as you feel your arms toning up, you enter fun spins/turns and get to practice the camel. This is an intermediate workout for sure because no steps are explained and the dancers are expected to know how to move on cue at a rapid pace. The cueing on this DVD is perhaps the best I've ever seen and the moves are repeated enough, that by the end you are actually dancing along providing a great confidence boost!

The Bonus dance sections show what can be accomplished over time, although I was more impressed with the compact dancer exercise routine to firm the lower body. If you are feeling a little shy, this will wake up your inner dancer and since you are constantly moving you will be having fun and burning calories too. I actually liked the music on this routine and felt it kept me moving and interested in learning new steps and routines that are way more fun to do than other tummy toning exercises like sit ups that become boring and repetitive. Bellydancing is always entertaining to watch, even when you are learning the routine.

1804650,3,B00007AJEM,"I am relatively fit but just had a baby and needed a fun workout that would help for the postpregnancy belly fat.  It may strengthen the abs but probably won't do much to burn fat.  The workout length is 30 minutes (5 minute warm up and cool down and about 20 minutes for the workout).  Part of the 20 minutes, not surprising, is pretty low key while she teaches basic moves, so youaren't likely to get your heart rate up until the end of the 20 minutes when she starts combining moves into a dance.

The instruction is quite good, Rania's give very good visual anaologies to help you know if you are doing the body mechanics properly.  For a novice bellydancer, it is going to take a while to learn these moves and combine them to keep up with the dance.  I think with regular practice I'll get the hang of it.

Rania doesn't patronize the view too much with comments like ""You can do it"".  I only recall one.

Being a TaeBo fan, I would have liked some intense drills of basic isolating moves.  Rania is basicly teaching moves and combining them into a dance towards the end, so if that is what you are looking for, this should be okay.

If you are looking for a powerful fatburning workout this isn't it.  If you are looking for exercise drills to improve your muscle isolations for aspiring bellydancers this probably isn't it either.  It is a moderate to easy workout but will require a lot of practice to master the moves to keep up with the combined moves.  Once you accomplish this it might become more of a moderate workout.

One caution for those with knee problems, this ""workout"" requires is a bit of deep knee bending and lunges, a nightmare for anyone with chondromalasia patella.  I am going to adapt my moves to work about this part.

I would have preferred music that is a little more authentic to the art of belly dancing.  The music wasn't too bad though I think R&B is an odd choice.",1146700800,,1903,4.388571428571429
1804651,3,B00007AJEM,"The blurb on the front of the DVD says ""easy-to-follow."" Only if you are an experienced. If you are familar with basic bellydance moves and/or Rania's previous workouts you will do fine. However, this DVD is not for those new to bellydancing. There is no breakdown of the moves and all the moves are very fast. I also found the choreography awkward at times. However, this is finally a workout by Rania that actually got my heart rate up. It's a vast improvement over her previous ones that were just too slow paced.",1136505600,,516,4.559139784946237
1804652,5,B00007AJEM,"I'm hooked!  I first heard of Rania through the flexibility training 'extra' on another DVD.  Checked out a couple of her programs through Netflix and loved them.  I have Hip-Hop Hip-Drop, Personal Trainer, and Too Hip.  I alternate the cardios and add a 'focus' or two as time allows.  Rania is personable, the music and extra dancers are great, and the work-outs are fantastic.  After a few times, when I had a handle on the routines, I realized, yeah, okay, the cues might be off a bit, but I haven't come across an exercise video that didn't have goofs like that.

If you're not familiar with bellydance moves, I suggest Personal Trainer because of the 'video' library of the moves.  Just going through each move in the library can give you a workout!  Someone said Too Hip was more advanced and I agree with that.  Get a couple of her other videos first.

I look forward to doing Rania's workouts so much that it's been over two months since I've done any other videos.",1135900800,,974,4.540229885057471
1804653,5,B00007AJEM,I love this DVD.  It made me sweat and gave me a great workout.  I also had lots of fun.  My only advice if you are a beginner I would get thur all of Rania's workout tapes first as this is very intermediate.  If you are not familar with the moves from previous video''s then you would be lost.  This is fast.,1134000000,,309,3.9193548387096775
1804654,5,B00007AJEM,"This was the first of Rania's DVDs I've tried and thanks to all who have reviewed her other workouts, I've picked the best.  Not only did I get a great cardio workout, I feel as though I've learned a dance.  Rania builds each move giving you plenty of time to get it down right, before moving on to another and with the repetition of the previous moves, you get the hang of it quick enough.  Of course you need to be familiar with bellydance moves already, but you don't need to be an expert.  She does cue you when to change and what's coming up.  All in all, its one of my favorites. The music on this workout is much better than that on the trailers of Rania's other workouts, they definitely have a canned cheezy sound.  This produce is great if you're looking for a good bellydance workout, as opposed to just instruction or drills, Also try Ultimate Bellydance with Jehan.  Neena and Veena's fat burning workout is great too.  But Rania's 'Too Hip' will remains my favorite.",1129161600,,980,4.435754189944134
1804655,4,B00007AJEM,"If you're not familiar with the Bellydancer Rania and her Bellydance Fitness for Weight Loss series, she is an AFAA certified Fitness Instructor and internationally renowned bellydancer. Her four part workout series fuses bellydance moves with a variety of different Western musical rhythms in her belief that bellydance can be done to any kind of music. With soundtracks not always coming off as authentic sounding as one may like; you'll have to use your imagination a bit when you hear the `Disneyesque' and sometimes cartoonish sounding strains of Hip Hop, Salsa, and R & B. The Bellydance Fitness for Weight Loss series are a set of fun workouts and a great way to interject life into a dull and stale workout routine.

Before beginning each workout it's important to keep in mind what these are -- workouts. Although you will learn some bellydance, as all of the routines are nearly completely comprised of bellydance moves, don't expect to buy this DVD and have it be your one-stop shopping for instruction and workout. They haven't made anything like that yet. The pacing required for instruction is way too slow to get your heart rate up for a cardiovascular or fat burning workout. Rania does a very good job of  creating routines with moves using similar muscle groups, starting with a slower tempo to teach the move and then returning quickly to full tempo, layering all the movements together to create an interesting routine. Lots of repetition will give you plenty of great bellydance practice.

Each one of the four follows a similar format and vary only in specific content and theme. Bellydance Boogie is supposed to fuse the sounds of Hip Hop and R&B with bellydance but once again you have to use your imagination here. It's the slowest of the four workouts but not the easiest. The smoother and more undulating bellydance moves featured here will work your muscles in surprising ways considering its slower pace -- further proof that a faster, higher impact workout isn't always a better one. The Bonus section of this disc includes Rania's sword dance and Rania's improvisation dance from ""Bellydance Divas"" and The 10 minute long Dancer's Legs & Buns workout from ""Bellydance Fitness for Weight Loss: Daily Quickies...5 Ten Minute Workouts.""

The workouts are set in a studio and Rania is backed up by a small group of dancers in matching workout attire w/ hip scarves -- similar in look and feel of the Crunch workout series but without all those annoying logos. The back up dancer's bodies are all variations on different female body types with some being curvy and some skinny, and at least one should look how your body could look if it were in a little better, but not rock hard, shape.

Each of the four workouts has a warm up of roughly  5 minutes. 20 minutes is spent on each disc devoted to instruction and routines. All four finish with a cool down and stretch segment of approximately 5 minutes in length. My biggest complaint is that I wish workouts were longer in length. 30 minutes just isn't enough for me to keep the fat molecules at bay. I would rather the workout be an hour in length and I could always quit part way through on days I have only 30-40 minutes to workout. Also, studies show that the body does not even begin to burn fat until after 20-30 minutes of sustained cardiovascular activity.

Not a lot of explanation is given to the individual bellydance moves but nearly everything is done in half-time to start before moving up to full tempo. Rania's voiceover often gives pointers as to how the moves are done but one would need to either be a little bit familiar with bellydance, or have a dance friendly set of coordination skills. Nearly anyone could eventually pick up most of the bellydance being done on these DVDs with enough patience and practice. Even without doing the moves perfectly you'll still have fun and get a good workout. Only the beginner absolutely new to all forms of dance would be truly lost. Some of the names Rania gives to certain Bellydance moves are different than I've heard them called before but this is common in the dance world where dancers come up with a move and patent the only part people can't `steal' -- the name. Don't let this bother you; it happens in Bellydance, Hip Hop, Salsa, et all. The move is probably the same thing you learned in class just with a different name.

Probably the biggest complaints about Rania's DVDs are concerning her stiffness, often vacant look, and inability to sustain a heartfelt smile. The look and smile I just consider window dressing for a video; I'm certainly more concerned with her ability to dance and teach. As far as her stiffness goes, it does have one advantage here -- a slightly stiff body is actually easier for a beginner to follow because lots of extra movement is distracting to the beginner who is merely trying to get the essence of a move down pat. While it may irritate an intermediate to professional dancer to watch, the beginner will benefit, and although Rania is certainly not the most fluid of dancers, the routines in the bonus section will attest that some, but not all, of her stiffness comes from making the workout moves look simpler. This is, of course, a fitness video for beginners.

In all, each of the four workouts are fun and you'll learn a little bit of dance. I just wish they all were longer.",1109462400,,5364,4.716115261472786

There is absolutely no bellydance instruction on ""Too Hip."" This workout was designed for someone who already knows bellydance and wants to be lead through a great workout; it's difficulty would be considered at the Intermediate level. In the pre-workout warmup alone, Rania uses both horizontal and vertical figure 8s as well as camels. If you don't know how to do these then choose one of her other four ""BFF&WL"" workouts instead. If you know what these bellydance moves are and can perform them well, then this is the workout for you. There's lots and lots of hip work featured here and you'll feel the workout primarily in your hips, buns, and thighs. Your abs, waist, and calves will get auxiliary work as well. Because Rania doesn't take any time at all to explain the moves, not even at half time pace, this workout has a much higher intensity level than the other four. You may have no complaints that the entire workout from warmup to cool down is only 35 minutes in length because you hit the ground running . . . or hip dropping, so to speak.

They haven't made anything like that yet. The pacing required for instruction is way too slow to get your heart rate up for a cardiovascular or fat burning workout. Rania does a very good job of creating routines with moves using similar muscle groups, this time using moves that require good hip work, and building a routine one fun section at a time. In this workout, all moves are done at full speed, no half time learning paces here, and constant repetition will give your muscles a good workout as you get plenty of great bellydance practice. I found each of the mini-sections to be quite fun as Rania exhibits some of her most enjoyable workout choreography to date.

Rania knows how to structure a good workout so just like in her others, ""Too Hip"" gives you a great warmup and stretch, followed by an intense workout, and finishing with a cool down and deeper stretch. Unlike her previous four ""BFF&WL"" videos, famous as much for their fun workouts as they were infamous for their terrible soundtrack, Rania got rid of the `Disney-esque"" synthesized music in favor of the arabic techno song ""Sitt Akull"" from the album ""Alwan Min Alsharq"" by Studio Ayoub Music. The steady, techno beat helps you reach and keep a target heart rate suitable for burning calories and fat. She has four backup dancers, two of whom you'll recognize from her other videos, and they've definitely been practicing. Louchia -- the dancer with the never-ending smile from ""Bellydance Divas"" is on Rania's right and on her left is a new face named Samira -- Arabic for `doesn't smile much.' Almost all of them look like they're having a good time and are all fluid and graceful. Yeah, Rania is still a bit stiff and her look a bit vapid but we can all get over that because the workout is so amazing and so much fun.

Immediately following the workout cool down is a drum solo by Rania which is my least favorite performance of her I've seen to date -- forgivable because she made me so exhausted from a killer workout. There is also a second bonus performance by Rania. Did I mention the workout was great? The sound was laid incorrectly here so you'll notice Rania emphasizing beats of the music that happened two beats ago. It's a shame. Just skip this one. The bonus workout is not one from the ""Bellydance Quickies"" Video, hooray! It's entirely new but Rania's cueing voice over as well as the music don't always fit what she's doing so I recommend after watching it the first time, just trying the bonus workout with the volume off.

However....she does not break down the moves at all - there is zero instruction, unless it's hidden away somewhere that I missed.  So - if you are really good at picking stuff up quickly visually as a bellydancer, this will be no problem for you.  If you need some break down of moves in order to get coordinated, like me, then you'll have to pause and figure stuff out for a while, or use easier moves in the meantime, before you build up to doing everything they are doing.  If you have never bellydanced, or even if you are still at the beginner level, I think you may want to hold off, or expect to really work up to this one.  You need to be instructed solidly in technique not only before being able to pick up on these moves correctly, but also safely - you could very easily get injured if you don't know how to maintain good form throughout and execute the moves properly.

No technique is taught or demonstrated, the girls on the video are not bellydancers.  The music is not middel eastern but jazz/r&b.  The intro on the sleeve is horrible....sexy moves to spring on your lover...gag. Real bellydancing is an art form not a strip tease! I have seen this woman in a bahngra video which I liked, but that may be because I don't know much about bahngra.",1275609600,,506,4.43010752688172
