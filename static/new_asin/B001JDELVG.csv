It's also motivating to me to see the instructors in such good shape--when I feel like stopping, I remind myself that it takes hard work to look like them and it keeps me going!",1477872000,,290,4.388888888888889
8312779,5,B001JDELVG,"I bought this DVD a few years ago and I sadly misplaced it. I have recently found it and begun following it in preparation for getting back on the board this summer, I forgot how much of a great workout this is. Cheesy music and phrases aside, this workout provided some genuine burn and is one of few options that provides some great core workouts. There are a few exercises as well which help for balance! Altogether pretty great for getting board strength back on form. But not challenging enough to keep up once you're in shape again!",1459555200,,538,4.5

8312781,5,B001JDELVG,"So the surfer girl theme is a little cheesy in this DVD set but not too bad. The workout DVDs are a lot of fun and your not wishing it would be over while your doing it. I know some workout DVDs are just incredibly hard or they are too easy, this set however is just right. The exercises are very different from anything I've ever done before which makes sense since I am not a surfer.

All in all this is a great DVD set to get for those days you just can't make it too the gym and for those lazy days you don't have the energy to throw in your Insanity or PX90 dvd but still want to work out.",1397001600,,594,3.8292682926829267
8312782,5,B001JDELVG,"I very much liked these workouts. The set was fun & airy, the music great and the moves actually quite unique..there were some tried and true old fashioned exercises because they work but there were many new and different moves I liked also. I get bored with the same old stuff and this was a refreshing change. It made me feel like I was at the beach workout out with some girlfriends!  I found the instructor was a little flat although the cueing was right on. I felt she might have seemed a little more excited to lead an exercise video but maybe she's just so laid back that it only seemed that way to me, anyway it doesn't take away from the workout itself.. I would definitely buy again and recommend this to anyone...",1377820800,,724,4.362962962962963
8312783,5,B001JDELVG,"I love these DVD's, I used to workout with the shred it workoouts from the On Demand section on my cable network but they stopped doing different workouts.  I like that all 3 discs have different short & longer workouts to use.  When my knee hurts I can do just upper body work by doing a shred workout.  The moves are easy & funm, the music isn't ovebearing & Amber isn't annoying to me, like other dvd's i have used.  Thanks for making a really good set, it works for me. :-)",1348531200,3,477,4.1521739130434785
8312784,5,B001JDELVG,"I looked past these workouts for a long while when I came across them them thinking- Oh God, Bikini talk and ready for the beach, yada yada....but, I got all 3 of them recently and they are actually fun, with  basic choreography so you can just jump right into them and I enjoyed these. I can feel them working my core too. These are designed by Michael Carson- whose workouts always focus on Core work, and Amber- the lead model/instructor was actually really good! She is mellow, yet is right on cue with everything. There is a lot of variety with these 3 DVDs-the first one has 2 workouts that use stability ball, the 2nd one has 3 toning workouts that use weights/stabilty ball and the 3rd one has a cardio routine and 5-5 min target toners using weights. Of course, I use heavier weights than the girls use with for the toning segments-it looks like they use 3lbs tops. Overall- these are fun, lighter workouts for summer and you feel like you are at the beach or getting ready to go there. The routines are good. I like these and will use them often.",1341446400,5,1056,4.415384615384616
