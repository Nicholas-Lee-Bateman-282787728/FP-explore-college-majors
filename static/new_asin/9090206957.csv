8196107,4,9090206957,"Interesting, albeit very short (13 min), canal boat trip through Amsterdam.  After a short introduction, the video is just sightseeing and music.  No running commentary of sights, etc.  Additionally, there is a chapter on the DVD, which shows photos and a short description of major buildings in the city.  The whole DVD is only about 20 min long (it is double-sided, with NTSC on one side and PAL version on the other).",1450569600,,420,4.791666666666667
