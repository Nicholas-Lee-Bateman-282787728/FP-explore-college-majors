8035814,1,B00030EQCK,"Having seen several claymation specials when they originally aired on TV, I ordered this to show to my grandchildren.
My first viewing was a shock, as the first eight and a half minutes are ""commercials"" for other products, several of which are not family friendly and definitely not suitable for our grandchildren.
Much of the rest of the material was disappointing, and we won't watch it again, much less show it to anyone, so I have taken it out of circulation by throwing it in the trash.",1200182400,,492,4.666666666666667
8035815,5,B00030EQCK,"Of all the claymation videos I've seen, this is the best. All the shorts are interesting and there is a wide variety. My all time favorite, though, is A Christmas Gift. For laughs, I enjoy the Great Cognito and the two ""movie critics"" never fail to get me laughing.",1199145600,5,265,4.428571428571429
