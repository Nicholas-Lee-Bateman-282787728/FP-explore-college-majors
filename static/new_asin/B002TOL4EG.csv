3985580,5,B002TOL4EG,"A lighter version of the fabulous Grand Hotel it places the marvelous Ginger Rogers in the Garbo role as a great movie star with no social life. With Walter Pidgeon as the baron, a gorgeous young Lana Turner as the stenographer and Van Johnson as a soldier with a medical issue who pursues and wins Turner back from Edward Arnold, this is feel good fluff that  I loved. To me it was enough just to look at Ginger and Lana as two beautiful women.",1388275200,,445,4.2976190476190474

3985586,4,B002TOL4EG,"Shoppers trying to order ""Weekend at the Waldorf"" can find it at the Warner Brother's store under their Archive Collection. There a newly made copy will set you back $19.95 and shipping - far less than the prices listed here used. Amazon does list some of these Warners Archive Collection films - I recently purchased one - just not all. I have no idea when the situation will be cleared up so Amazon shoppers can order any of the films from the Archives, or if Amazon is actually serious in listing these films.

The film itself is a mild remake of MGM's 1932 Oscar winning super cast production ""Grand Hotel"". New York City's Waldorf Astoria during 1945 stands in for the orginal setting, a luxury hotel in Berlin.(Imagine what a wild film it would have been if the film had been updated to 1945 Berlin!) Ginger Rogers as lonely actress subs for Garbo's ballerina Grusinskaya, while Walter Pidgeon plays a famous foreign correspondent as the love interest, previously handled by John Barrymore as the Baron. Joan Crawford's sensational Flaemmchen, with eyes that could look through a soul, and the most smashing legs ever seen in a thirties film, transforms in 1945 into sweater girl Lana Turner, with the impossibly promiscious name of 'Bunny'. (Really - just how dense did MGM think the audiences of the day were? Good grief - it's Lana Turner!) Lionel Barrymore's dying Kringelein, in keeping with wartime propaganda needs, reappears as a young serviceman, in this case heart throb Van Johnson, who faces a life or death operation and is spending his last week living it up. The role of the manipulative and cowardly bully General Director Preysing, so well played by Wallace Beery, is turned over to the solid Edward Arnold playing a shady war profiteer. To add a little extra - missing from the original - there is music and a new subplot involving the Waldorf Astoria's real life house band - Xavier Cugat and his orchestra.

Acting as partial narrator MGM inserted Robert Benchley, a highly popular presence in his day, but remarkably wearying now. His flippant tone - he is supposed to be a columnist - is in striking contrast with his counterpart in ""Grand Hotel"", a cynical and weary disfigured war veteran, Lewis Stone. (Who appeared for the seventh and last time in a Garbo feature.) One character no one forgot from the original was Adolphus, the Baron's dachshund, whose devotion and love for his owner were magically conveyed in Barrymore's unforgettable performance: If a pet has received a more devoted expression of pure love on screen, I've yet to see it. The 1945 remake combines dog and Jean Hersholt's desk clerk waiting to hear news of his pregnant wife's imminent delivery with a pregnant Scottie - shades of Fala - belonging to Benchley's character. Thankfully MGM drew the line on using Lassie.

It's pointless to compare this film with the original - the first is a stunner of a movie, and a must see. This wartime version is set on a much lower key - Garbo's intensity is far beyond the dramatic talents of Ginger, while Pidgeon's trademark low key persona, which works so well when played against the likes of Greer Garson, is a far cry from the ultra-stylish melodrama of Barrymore. However, it would be a mistake to underestimate what is here: Lana Turner and Van Johnson were as good as MGM could offer, and MGM had an extraordinary body of stars to chose from. Watching the film is not an unpleasant experience, and if the film packs little of the wallop of its far more illustrious predecesor, the story remains solid, the cast chosen from the top current stars on the MGM lot, and the production values far exceeded the norma; standards of cost-cutting wartime Hollywood.

In the end ""Weekend at the Waldorf"" might best be described as not so much a failure as an indication of how far MGM had fallen by 1945 from the glory heights of Irving Thalberg. The great melodrama of 1932 had been transformed and softened into a high class soap opera.

""Weekend at the Waldorf"" does treat the concerns of the day - loss and fear of death, fear of commitment - any film of the era could not ignore what was everywhere in the air! (Though the Fox musicals did their best!) The stars in the film do reflect their time in many ways. The tragedy of the ""Grand Hotel"" has been softened - no one dies as before. Indeed, there any fews scenes more heart-breaking then the ending of ""Grand Hotel"": The previously suicidal Garbo's exiting the hotel in a flurry of trailing staff, she bursting out in smiles and delight, overflowing in a euphoria of joy in her new love for the Baron, kept unaware of the news of his death.

There were very few films of the time devoid of propaganda facing up to the fears. It would take another year, and a far more serious film to begin to confront the feelings and griefs that were only half spoken.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Best-Years-of-Our-Lives/dp/0792846133/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Best Years of Our Lives</a>&nbsp;For almost the entire war these feelings were never given public voicing, but were expressed out of the public eye - with the great state funeral for FDR acting as one gigantic exception and a catharsis for the nation.",1250812800,11,5254,4.838709677419355

8380454,5,B002TOL4EG,"Imagine Irving Thalberg's ""Grand Hotel"" merging duking it out with  L.B. Mayer's ""Andy Hardy"" and you've got ""Weekend at the Waldorf"". No surprise, Mayer's Hardy family wins hands down. i.e., Harmless, enjoyable fun. Nothing in depth. Spectacular Waldorf Astoria settings, ""Star"" performances: Pidgeon urbane sophistication at it's best, Ginger Rogers glitz hairdos & wardrobe, Lana Turner eye candy, civilized chit chat, pleasant company, Latin music, exotic (Manhattan) nightlife under the stars....etc. A nice way to wile away the hrs with nothing stronger than a hot cup of decaf tea.

Possible ""Spoilers"".
Minor glitches, mercifully brief. A lunatic maid who's ""very life"" depends on her indulgent (balmy?) employer doing her a BIG favor ! and two irritant brides (not cute) each sillier than the other throwing histrionics for no valid reason.
#1 Bride (entitlement revolting) doesn't confirm her Waldorf reservations so has a public snit until she gets her way.
# 2 Waldorf bride (""impulsive"" & delusional)  demands to cancel her wedding within hours of the ceremony because she conjectures out of thin air that her future husband is in love with a famous movie star. Needless to say, Star Rogers expediently lies to the bride (in the strictest confidence) that she's already married in order to save the day. The resulting payback from the idiot bride who doesn't hesitate to betray Roger's confidence viewers can guess.
Why reasonable, seemingly sane people marry flakes excepted, the only real mystery in this film is why the Van Johnson character ""Jimmy"" presented to viewers as handsome, intelligent & charming is alone and completely friendless in the world.",1507507200,,1671,5.321969696969697
