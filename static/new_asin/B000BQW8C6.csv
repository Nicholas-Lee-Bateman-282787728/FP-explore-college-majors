8091136,3,B000BQW8C6,"This is an average surf movie.

The strength of this movie is that it has some relatively unknown surfers riding longboards and shortboards in some exotic locations. Bruce Irons is probably the best know surfer in it.

The music is just okay.

The movie is pretty short at around 35 minutes.

If you like shortboarding, then get a different movie like Melali sessions or One California Day.
If you want a story, watch Single Fin Yellow instead.",1311811200,,444,4.7272727272727275
