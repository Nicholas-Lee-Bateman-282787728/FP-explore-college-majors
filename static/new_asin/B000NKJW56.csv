8179075,5,B000NKJW56,Great DVD. Received quickly & exactly as described.,1474588800,,51,5.5
8179076,3,B000NKJW56,"I was disappointed. I thought I was getting the 1st 5 seasons in their entirety. I was so excited. Found out after I got it that it was just clips :(  SNL went downhill after the original cast left. I wanted those seasons. Oh well, will have to look elsewhere.",1363996800,,260,4.2
8179077,5,B000NKJW56,"A small ""collection"", but darn FUNNY! Of course. Its the Not Ready For Prime Time Players the original cast, and some of their skits from the first season. Good for more than a giggle, over and over.",1298419200,,199,4.405405405405405

But, I was expecting to see total actual sketches from those shows--not 15 second blurbs or pieces of sketches. That is really the what I was expecting and wanted to see.  I think the title of the CD is somewhat misleading but, oh well . . . . I wouldn't pay full-price to get a new copy, but a used CD is probably worth your viewing time.",1216512000,7,782,5.911504424778761
