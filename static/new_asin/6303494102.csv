7848972,5,6303494102,"""Hawk of the Wilderness"" comes from the late 1930's when Republic filmed nearly everything fresh, with their directors William Witney and John English. The star, Herman Brix/Bruce Bennett, had played Tarzan three years earlier, was muscular and physically up to the task, and yet projected a quiet assurance when delivering his lines. He also figured into three other recommended Republic serials:  ""The Lone Ranger (1938)"" as one of the candidates although not the eventual Lone Ranger, ""Fighting Devil Dogs (1938)"", and ""Daredevils of the Red Circle (1939)"".  Noble Johnson as Mokuyi make a rare appearance as a good guy. Republic was building their library at this point, filming new, and stands above and beyond much of  Universal product built on a platform of grainy old speeded up stock footage.",1457827200,,802,5.2015503875969
7848973,5,6303494102,This serial is the best serial I watched on television in the 1950's.  I never missed an episode.  Too bad they haven't transferred it to a DVD.  Herman Brix/Bruce Bennett was a fine actor and not bad to look at either.,1436572800,,219,4.2926829268292686
7848974,4,6303494102,"This is one I missed as a kid, I saw a different wildeness in my mind when reading other reviews, something more sub tropical than great north woods. ""Hawk"" is another version of the Tarzan, Bomba, Jungle Girl, etc myth, with shades of Jules Vern's mysterious version of an Iceland type island made verdent by hot springs. I had to get used to the northern California landscape and see this ""island"" as a very big place. The opening chapter is classic in both senses of the word. like Moses, like Superman. It was very well done. The acting is first rate, not ""saturday""
kid stuff, and the human motivations are believable and honest. We lost Bruce Bennett this year, an inspiration and national treasure who lived the entire century. The story and characters both ""develop"", unusual in a serial, and are not ""predictable"" After adjusting to the big pine woods, I was really into this serial. Unfortunately, typical of the times, was the ""comic"" ""superstitious"" ""freightened"" black family servant, also used in ""Daredevils of the Red Circle"" Director Witney acknowledged it in his bio, but pointed out what was even worse, the virtual unemployment of black actors in Hollywood.",1198108800,,1177,4.919597989949748

Total Time: 217 mins on VHS ~ Republic Video ~ (7/18/1995)",1169942400,2,7479,5.221848739495798
7848976,5,6303494102,"I enjoyed the well put together story based on the William L Chester book, the good direction and beautiful locations. Much of the background is of Mammoth Lakes in High Sierra of Central California.

 Brix, who changed his stage name to Bruce Bennett in 1939, said he was completely exhausted at the end of the filming of HAWK having worked virtually nonstop for 3 days and nights to finish the 12 chapter serial.

 I enjoyed the performance of Noble Johnson as Mokuyi, Monte Blue as Yellow Weasle while recognizing Iron Eyes Cody, Lane Chandler and George Montgomery in bit roles. Mr. Mapes was noticed in some of the stunts. Harley Wood was credited as Jill Martin here.

 One must realize that the performances were pretty good considering the financial and time constraints imposed by the producers. Directors Witney and English could really orchestrate action and usually get it right in one take. Even Tuffy, the australian shephard-collie mix who played Tawnee was great.

 Some would rate this serial as one of the top 10. Because of Brix, the rest of cast, and the Mammoth Lakes location, and of course, the direction of Witney and English, I would agree..There is a kind of dignity found here in this 1938 production.

 Trivia:

 Noble Johnson (Mokuyi) was a man of color who founded the first black owned film production company and was a friend of Lon Chaney.

 Monte Blue (Yellow Weasle) was a silent film star and later had a role in Key Largo with Humphrey Bogart and Claire Trevor

 Mala was really part eskimo and well suited as Kias, the lame in Hawk of the Wilderness

 Brix/Bennett is alive and well going on 99 living in the Los Angeles area. He later became a successful realtor to the rich and famous in L. A. area before retiring in 1990",1091059200,7,1762,4.684039087947883
7848977,5,6303494102,"Hawk is not generally recognized as one of the great serials, but IMHO it's in the top ten. This is one serial with a story, not just ""We're trying to collect all ten of the Scorpion's feet, or whatever."" Strong direction and tight performances even from actors not generally admired, i.e., Mala, add up to a consistently entertaining twelve episodes of pure fun.",987638400,7,363,4.777777777777778
