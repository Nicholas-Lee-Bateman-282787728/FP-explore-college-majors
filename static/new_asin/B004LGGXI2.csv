4401351,4,B004LGGXI2,"This is a good description of the real life of pirates, focusing almost exclusively on the Golden Age of Piracy (late 1500s-mid-1700s).  It has some fine reconstructions and reenactments as well as original artifacts, discusses most of the major pirates of the Caribbean and North America, and debunks many of the myths about pirates.  I had hoped to use it for a middle school history club, but it's too long (2 hours) and has a few words Mom and Dad wouldn't want repeated.  Also, for some reason, the quality of the color and photography was uneven.  Overall, however, a good introduction.",1390521600,8,592,4.8316831683168315
4401352,3,B004LGGXI2,Not what I was expecting. Programs are too slow and they should have more information. Price was ok. They could have done better.,1366156800,4,129,4.6521739130434785
4401353,5,B004LGGXI2,"Pirates Edward Fly, Louis Guittar, Edward Low, John Quelch, Charles Vane, and Rachel Ward were all hanged. Mary Read was sent to prison.
Pirare Stede Bonnet wept when he faced the hangman. He never believed piracy on the high seas carried such a penalty,
Likewise the notorious Captain William Kidd. He believed his crimes would be forgiven and he would be sent back home to his wife and two children.
Movies, amusement park attractions, and souvenir shops honor the memory of Blackbeard (Edward Teach). Insanity was reason enough to hang him, but a young naval lieutenant got to him first, shot him, then had him beheaded.

A thousand demons wept and wailed
at the sight of his head on the bowsprit
a more fearsome pirate never sailed
even the Devil knew it.",1357776000,5,759,4.75
4401354,4,B004LGGXI2,"The disc does try to give as accurate a historical portrayal of piracy on the high seas as can be placed together in our seperated times.

Understanding the old pirates is very difficult, as they lived a rather nomadic lifestyle, typically left few possessions and had little need of literacy.

It's accurate and understandable as it portrays pirate ships not as massive galleons, or men of war, but as lighter, faster more nimble craft brimmed full of armed men, or women.

Some of the best sections dealt with who exactly pirates were, what brough men (and women) to this harsh life. For me it was particularly interesting to discover the quirk of law Ann Bonnie used to escape the gallows.

There's a fun bonus section at the end of the DVD featuring much of Discovery's ""Mythbusters"" where they tackled pirate legends, all I can say on the eyepatch was I'd never have thought of that!

For a couple of dollars, I've no regrets on the purchase - worth that to see the mythbusters people lose a canonball just outside of LA.",1330214400,10,1026,4.6464088397790055
4401355,5,B004LGGXI2,"Very well done, as expected, coming from the Discovery Channel.  Interesting facts about the many pirates and privateers, and the geographical areas they sailed.  I learned a lot and will be watching this again to pick up bits and pieces I missed the first time around.  Included is a Mythbusters pirate special that was very informative as well, dispelling popular myth surrounding the scourge of the seas.",1305763200,15,407,5.044776119402985

8434347,5,B004LGGXI2,Eversince the second grade I've always enjoyed becoming lost in history and the Golden Age of Piracy is just one of the many chapters in that history. This is a very well made and informative documentary and I can even remember watching it as part of a class project we had back in my middle school years. At the time we had been reading Treasure Island and this was a perfect backdrop for it. It's worth a watch and I'm so happy to finally have my own copy:-),1483315200,,460,4.238636363636363
