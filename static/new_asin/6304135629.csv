7862386,3,6304135629,"When it was over, my husband and I turned to each other and said ""What was that all about?"" What was the director trying to say?  In my book, if the director cannot get that across to the viewer, the film is a loss.  But here, in spite of that, there is something.  Something about the loneliness in all of us, whether we are connected to others or not.  The architect clearly was not connected; he said he was divorced, but do we know that to be true?  The woman was married, we even see her wedding picture, and at one point a vague movement behind her, as if someone is entering.  She quickly hangs up the phone.  Was she so lonely in her marriage, or just dissatisfied sexually?  Do these two people sign up for phone sex for the hell of it, or are they seeking some human connection they do not have in their lives?  One of the very basic rules for this kind of thing is that they can never meet, or disclose their identities.  So what is it they want?  These are the questions that Mr. Van Gogh leaves hanging.  As the film progresses, I got the feeling that there was some sort of power struggle emerging.

The film is strange and intense, erotic, and on some level, rather sinister.",1365638400,,1190,4.258928571428571

7862388,5,6304135629,"1-900, originally called ""06"", by the so tragically murdered Dutch director Theo van Gogh is a very provocative movie about loneliness, communication, relationships and phantasies, set in a, on first sight, rather unique situation for a movie. Like the director himself there was a lot of controversy around the movie. When one looked at the poster one would think to be in for a very erotic and sexually explicit movie.

Well, anyone going into the cinema with that expectation, would have been quite disappointed, for what you get is a very harsh emotional and psychological drama around two people making contact over a sexline to fulfill their need for socio-sexual release, hoping to feel a bit less lonely that way. The contact slowly devolves into a regular power struggle between two people, dare I say the two sexes, that can only end up leaving them where they started, alone and with an unfulfilled longing to have their barriers broken down and at the same time being mortally afraid of the vulnarability this would result in.

The drama is very intense and rarely erotic, because you sense much more the sadness of these two people and the way they really try to be close, through sex as the supposedly ultimate way of achieving intimacy with another person, and yet end up more isolated then ever.

It's a fearless and provocative movie, which is typical for this director, and actually cost him his very life in the end.",1168041600,2,1435,4.82520325203252

7862390,3,6304135629,"There are always people who are lonely and/or are seeking happiness for the moment.  This story depicts this through the use of the brilliant invention by Bell, the telephone.  As the story is set in motion there is a man, Thomas, who answers a phone sex ad and presents himself as someone who enjoys art, which results in him matching interests and age that another caller, Sarah, wishes for.  In reality, Thomas is an equal with Sarah in his sense of art, but nothing else.  Lies begin during their first session where they shyly introduce each other over the phone; however, as they talk their shyness disappears.  They talk about many issues in their lives which leads the story into humor, tragedy, lies, and truths.  However, Thomas has needs that remain unfulfilled when he is seeking contact with her because she remains distant and refuses to share her phone number with him.  1-900 is an intriguing film that provides some interesting dialogues that leads to stimulating perspectives in the development of a phone-relationship.",1049587200,2,1037,4.959537572254336
7862391,2,6304135629,"Even if taken as some sort of social litmus test for wackos, 1-900 can only be described as disturbing and only mildly thought provoking. The male (Thomas) characer is immediately defined by what he is not:truthful, caring, confident, and well grounded. The female (Sarah) charcter takes much longer to fully ""flesh-out"". Whereas Thomas is dull, combative, and frought with insecurities Sarah seems assertive, focused, and well connected to the outside world. As the movie lumbers on we find out that although Thomas is incredibly flawed as a human being, Sarah also has serious issues. Their collective shortcomings might make them human, but in the end we find out that Thomas is a sadistic wreck of a man living in lies and Sarah is living a life that borders on compulsive sexual addiction that leaves her unfulfilled in every possible way. In the context of a character study of severely flawed human beings, the film works. Unfortunately it's being pawned off as a love story...this it is not. Save your money.",1029542400,4,1016,4.982352941176471
7862392,4,6304135629,"A surprising and eye-opening tale about lonely people in the Netherlands. Two strangers meet on a phone sex line in modern day Netherlands. Their lives are such that they go out and meet people and may even have significant others in their lives, but they still feel empty and lonely and feel a need to reach out for something more. Significantly they do not at first acknowledge their emptiness and loneliness. They simply call this phone sex line to feel some connection to someone, even if it is only nervous and surface chat about sex. The film is stunning because it employs very little scenery and only two characters. You never see anyone else and all of their interactions take place over the phone. After talking once (the woman calls the man because she does not want to divulge her phone number, her real name or the city in which she lives) they agree to have a regular time for talking. Their relationship develops over the phone and it becomes clear from their interactions that they care about each other, as strange as it seems, on a deeper level... as more than just phone sex partners or as a voice on the end of the line. This development is well handled and very convincing. Eventually when they reach a level of real human intimacy, the woman still will not tell the man her identity. When she phones him at the appointed time one day someone else answers (or what sounds like someone else). She is startled and the person who answers announces that he is the man's father and is going through his things because the man had died earlier in the week. The woman is visibly devastated by this sudden news, and she becomes quite unnerved and asks a lot of questions. The father says that he does not feel like discussing the details of his son's suicide but would call her back if she permitted him to. She provides all her contact information, and then he tells her that it was all a joke and that it is really him, not the father, and that he was still alive. You can see that she is so relieved and so glad that he is really alive, but at the same time she is furious that he took advantage of her and lied to her that way. She tells him they will never speak again, and the next week when their appointed phone date arrives, the film shows both of them silently sitting by the telephones but doing nothing. It was a rather heartbreaking work which really felt unsettling because it was so true to life and so... close to home. Even when you have people around who love you and are close to you, you can still feel so lonely and crave attention from some other person or medium, and this film illustrated that delicate frustration so well.",982972800,10,2660,4.441717791411043
