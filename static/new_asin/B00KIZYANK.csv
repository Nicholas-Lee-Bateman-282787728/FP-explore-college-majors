8659436,1,B00KIZYANK,"Never could watch it. I received TWO of them and both would not play, said 'disc error' when I put them in the DVD player. According to the package it would only play in a player and that's what we have.",1456704000,2,203,3.975609756097561
8659437,5,B00KIZYANK,"This little gem is just so old, so corny, so trite that I had to love it.  I saw it many years ago and have remembered many of the lines.  Was glad to see and get the dvd.  Really is a treat to watch. I saw a complaint about WC not being in it enough.  So what!!!  Everyone in the cast added their talent to the roles and made it what it is.",1452816000,,341,3.6164383561643834

8659440,5,B00KIZYANK,This is a quality copy of one of my favorite movies from a bygone era.  I wish everyone held the world views of Mrs. Wiggs and most of the cast in the movie - the world would be a better place.,1419811200,,193,3.707317073170732
8659441,4,B00KIZYANK,"I just received and watched this today.  I also have a previous version put out by PRS in August of 2010.  That version contains Mrs. Wiggs, Earthworm Tractors, The Golf Specialist and The Fatal Glass of Beer.  This version is head and shoulders above the one put out by PRS.  Granted, it's still an on demand dvd copy of a VHS, but a much better copy.  Don't hesitate if you love the film.  If you have the other copy, buy this one and throw that one out.",1413417600,2,456,4.183908045977011
