5657058,2,B00BN3DUO6,"Janet (Erin McGrane) is recovering from AA. She has three daughters. Alice (Emily Boresow) is the quiet introvert. Sally (Sally Spurgeon) wants to be called Sarah because it sounds more professional. Jennifer (Meg Saricks) has trouble with geometry and aspires to be a porn star or something. On their way to the airport to pick up dad, a returning soldier, they get side tracked by a tornado. They break into a farm cellar, and then become prisoners.

The interesting aspect of the film is the family of captors. The mom (Joicie Appell) was perhaps the most interesting character in the film. Had the film concentrated on this family instead, they could have made a camp classic. As it was, I was bored to tears. The action builds up too slow until about 50 minutes into the film when things pick up. Unfortunately the film stays with the boring formula.

Doesn't make a decent rental.

5657060,5,B00BN3DUO6,"I saw this at a film screening in Kansas City and I loved it.  Tense, suspenseful, eerie, and downright creepy.  All around, a great horror story, a methodical slow burn up until the chaotic ending.  Artistically shot, fantastically written, all around a breath of fresh air for the horror genre.",1362960000,12,296,4.88
5657061,5,B00BN3DUO6,"Got to see this in an Independent Film Festival.  It was really cool!  Such a good idea- a monster that is ""activated"" by tornados like a werewolf is by the moon.  Small Kansas town that is a tight knit community turns into a nightmare for some girls and their mom who are just traveling through and get stuck in the storm.  Being from a small town in the midwest myself makes this movie seem even creepier!  I just love how original it is.  Can't wait to see it again, so I'm sure I will buy this DVD as soon as it is out!",1362182400,16,523,4.029126213592233
5657063,4,B00BN3DUO6,"I had an epiphany while watching this wonderful, straightforward yet subtle movie that is just what its title says it is: horror movies are going through a change, in general becoming more complex, more Lynchian, Cronenbergian, especially in the last six years (blame Obama, that wicked, wicked man (just kidding BHO! Love your!)). And don't get me wrong, I'm loving it, but there's something refreshing about a movie which simply drops four very charismatic heroines into a scary basement full of backwoodsy folk who are affected by stormy weather in such a way that they all need to be muzzled. Lots of screams, lots of chomping, a lot of gore offscreen, which is, of course, scarier when done right. And director Patrick Rea does it right.",1409270400,,742,4.896825396825397
5657064,1,B00BN3DUO6,"Hmm, I think a better title would have been Yawn maker. A mother and her 3 kids take refuge in a cellar during a tornado. Unbeknownst to them the cellar is home to a family of freakish monsters. There is some originality to this film but the acting is pretty poor and the effects are minimal and not too convincing. Plus, the movie just seems to end without any real closure. Overall, a rather underwhelming effort.
The film ends on such an abrupt note, it might as well have To Be continued plastered on the screen.

Don't waste your time or money.",1407888000,2,549,4.382352941176471
5657065,2,B00BN3DUO6,"The title of this movie isn't a fit for this film. I wasn't biting my nails, I was yawning. Let's just get right to it:

I know there's a few voices out there who are cheering for horror films with little to no blood or gore, as if the new fad going around is great story telling over gore and blood, and that's fine...IF there is a good story telling. Nailbiter should have had blood and gore, because the story SUCKS.

The acting is god awful and absolutely cringe worthy at times. I won't post spoilers, but wouldn't you be upset if someone you loved died?

I was suckered into this movie because it sounded original in the description. Oh, the potential for a cult classic was there, but the lousy acting and unanswered questions just ruined this for me. I will compliment the setting of this film and how they ended up there, (that is original) but then it just falls apart mid way through. Pity.",1399420800,2,901,4.383233532934132
5657066,3,B00BN3DUO6,"I thought this was going to be stronger than it was, given the many reviews that maintained it as a 3 star movie, as compared to other streaming horror titles. I guess I am maintaining that by giving it a 3 but I don't think its fair to go down as there wasn't anything so wrong with it as to discard it. My 2 or under ratings are 'don't watch' warnings. This is definitely NOT a primetime viewing experience. Maybe a rainy Sat. afternoon if you have nothing to watch and are sick and in bed kinda movie. The family consists of 3 sisters and their mother, enroute to pick up their father from the airport who is returning from military service. They hole up in the wrong house when a tornado emerges. The synopsis says 'they are not alone' or some such thing but don't take that to mean a force of any kind or anything supernatural. Its more of a mutant creature feature. There was nothing spooky, creepy, menacing, etc. here for me. The atmosphere didn't work. The antagonists came off comedic to me.  The ending suggests a part 2. If so, count me out.",1396656000,4,1053,4.345177664974619
5657067,1,B00BN3DUO6,"Why?

[1] The 3rd degree burn victim on the movie's ad does not resemble the cheap, amateurish monsters in the movie AT ALL. Trust this. The actual monsters look like a huge fail in a juvenile's wolfman mask workshop.
[2] Demonizing burn victims is a repugnant way to sell movies...
[3] The title 'Nailbiter' has nothing to do with the movie's theme or plot...it is not at all intense, but, rather, a very boring and predictable---subpar 'horror' flick...yet again.
[4] The movie's premise is very inane and weak. Without going into much detail, the existence of the monsters is not thoroughly explained.
[5] Many, many questions about various characters go unanswered. If this is what the film makers deem to be the 'nailbiting' part, they are sadly mistaken. I can't stand the original movie. I am not going to invest my time and money in a 'Nailbiter Part 2'.",1387670400,,862,4.785234899328859

It could have been a good movie based on the story line, but the poor acting, somewhat mediocre filmography, and cheesy special effects made this a really bad flick.
One thing it had going for it. It did keep me interested enough in sticking around to try and see how much dumber it could get. I gave it 2 stars for that.
All the way to the end when their ""dad"" finally flew into the airport. How many soldiers have any of us seen get off the plane in half a uniform? Dude was in his camo britches and boots, and a t shirt. I was like holy cow, they didn't even try to make this at least kind of realistic.",1386288000,2,719,3.8322147651006713

The characters were likable (even the stereotypical 'goth-girl', the eldest daughter), and they interacted in believable ways. I love that whole 'sinister old town with a secret' premise.
While not earth-shatteringly new in any way, this was executed very well. Recommended watch for anyone who likes their horror film with some sub-human beasties in it.",1374192000,2,456,5.260273972602739

Don't let the five star reviews fool you like they did us; All elements of this movie are a disappointment. With it's poorly developed (and terribly acted) characters, uninspired plot, and utter lack of scares, Nailbiter gives low-budget horror movies a bad name.

Highly disappointed in this film- would not recommend renting or purchasing it. For a bigger scare, go read ""Goosebumps"".",1373760000,,439,5.169014084507042

5657100,2,B00BN3DUO6,**spoilers** I'm normally not so brutal when reviewing horror flicks but I feel kinda suckered in by all the flattering reviews. Lets start with the title Nailbiter.

5657113,4,B00BN3DUO6,"An interesting premise and a brooding atmosphere are the strengths of NAILBITER, a low budget indie horror flick.
Set in the plains of Kansas during a devastating tornado, NAILBITER focuses on a young mother and her three daughters traveling to pick up their father returning from overseas deployment.  The family is caught in the tornado in little bitty Wellville and seek shelter in the storm cellar of a nearby house....not the best decision as they find themselves prisoners of something horrifying.
Since the effects aren't quite convincing, the director wisely ""suggests"" their appearance so we never really see the creatures so that is somewhat a letdown.  Performances are efficient if average and the ending rather anti-climactic.  Still there is an inventiveness that makes NAILBITER a notch above the usual fare.",1370563200,,823,5.315384615384615
5657114,5,B00BN3DUO6,"I had the pleasure of catching NAILBITER at the Texas Frightmare Weekend last year (in 2012), and I absolutely loved it. At the time, I didn't realize they had a distributor already, so imagine my joy when I realized it was Lionsgate. The company has a true hit on their hands with this one. This is a top-notch horror flick that will have you squirming in your seat and begging for more!

This film is amazing, from start to finish. It is visually excellent, the writing is sharp, and the suspense is so tight that you could play it like a guitar. In short, this is an amazing jaunt into horror that fans of the genre will love.

NAILBITER has some astounding visual effects for being a lower-budget film. The CG used for the twister meshes perfectly with the physical environment, creating a believable and heart-pounding setting. The creature effects are nice, too; they are original and terrifying, two attributes that create a truly compelling monster.

But the true winner here is the story. Director Patrick Rea creates a new Midwestern mythology for a creature straight out of our nightmares. Granted, the explanation behind what is really going on is vague, however I find this actually works for the film. It helps to create the tension onscreen, and it also leaves the viewer with an immense sense of unease as the credits roll.

NAILBITER is epic in scope and I love how the movie ends, with leaving potential for a sequel. I would love to revisit this world again and maybe have the father visit Wellsville on a quest for revenge. I highly recommend this one and suggest you check it out soon. This film should appeal to horror fans in general, especially those of you who prefer creature-features. Give this a look for sure.",1370390400,,1738,4.688524590163935
5657115,2,B00BN3DUO6,"Apparently the plot, suspense, and scares were blown away with the storm.  Maybe the low budget prevented them from doing more with the potential premise, but unfortunately, the movie poster is scarier than the whole movie. This should have been done with the intensity of Texas Chainsaw, and instead was the horror equivalent of a Disney cartoon. It might scare your 8 year old, perhaps you should let them see if they are entertained by it. Actually, they might tell you it was lame too.",1370217600,3,489,4.752941176470588

5657118,2,B00BN3DUO6,"Promising but ultimately pretty lousy horror movie about a mother and her three daughters who take refuge in a cellar during a hurricane and then find themselves trapped and under attack by a monster or monsters.  The problems with this one are numerous--the film rarely builds any tension; what the monsters are is never set up or explained; everything you want to see pretty much happens off-screen, probably due to budget issues.  Until very late in the film anyone who is killed is attacked off-screen.  At one point one of the daughters manages to kill a monster but the monster is completely off-screen the entire time and even after it's dead we still don't get to see it.  Towards the end of the movie we do get to see the monsters a little but since no explanation is given regarding their nature or origin it basically feels like you're watching a really bad werewolf movie by people who don't know anything about werewolves.  Nailbiter had a lot of potential but the execution is bad on pretty much every level from the overwrought performances to the flat direction to the barely even there special effects.  Definitely not recommended unless you are really desperate for a horror movie and absolutely nothing else is available.",1370131200,2,1240,4.8254716981132075

This movie was a pleasant surprise.  The story is about a woman and her three daughters on the way to pick up the husband/father from the airport.  Trapped in a storm they take refuge in a cellar and encounter some...interesting ""people.""

One of the most impressive things about the movie was the writer/director's ability to avoid overdone cliches and tropes.  The women are resilient and intelligent as well as interesting.

The acting and special effects may not have been Oscar worthy, but they were good.  I didn't find myself distracted by either which is a sign of an enjoyable and carefully made movie.

This is a movie that I would recommend to anyone who enjoys horror movies and doesn't need an extravagant and overwrought Hollywood heavy weight.  I'm looking forward to seeing more from the maker's of this film.",1369958400,3,990,4.909638554216867

Not only with the Tornado element but the element of what the town has become and the people in it due to storms made this film so interesting. Plus the film being distributed by Lionsgate even gives the film even more credibility.

5657122,4,B00BN3DUO6,"Disclaimer upfront - I worked on this movie, make an appearance and even get some mentions on the commentary tracks.

If you're looking for 'horror film' that has lots of blood and gore flying around, gratuitous female nudity, flimsy & poorly written characters who are pretty much just there to be killed for entertainment, all held together by a ramshackle by-the-numbers story -- then this movie AIN'T FOR YOU.

If, on the other hand, you're looking for a horror film that has some craft put towards its storytelling - characters that aren't one-dimensional and simply there to be killed; some actual suspense and tension, practical monster effects and CGI that's used in service to the story - then you may want to give this a chance.

It is a horror film, but in the old-school sense of the term - it also stands as a pretty good drama with some elements of horror and the fantastic that supplants the drama. Fans of horror remakes, reboots, requels or of gorehound backyard cinema trash aren't gonna find a lot that they'll like here... actual craft and care taken may indeed come off as 'old-fashioned', but it's a film that'll stand up for years to come. And yes; there *may* be 'more to come' regarding the Nailbiter Saga - that depends on YOU.

If you like this, check out Patrick Rea's short films (SeNoReality Pictures) and his first feature, THE EMPTY ACRE; and writer Kendall Sinn's SHADOW FALLS & SHADOW FALLS MEMORIAL.",1369958400,3,1434,4.746987951807229

The key actors -- a mother and her three daughters -- give reasonably strong performances, with only momentary lapses into overacting. Production values aren't bad, given that the movie was clearly filmed on the cheap. Some of the scenes are framed in interesting ways.

The story involves a small town in Kansas populated by people who turn into monsters in bad weather. Tornadoes really get them going. The older folk have more self-control but the youngsters run around in the rain and kill regular people after taking on a monstrous form. Yes, it's silly, but this is a horror movie so what of it?

True to form in horror movies, the characters (who break into a cellar while seeking shelter from a tornado and then find themselves locked in) do every stupid thing they can imagine until they finally do something smart. The script is nothing special while the key teenager seems surprisingly undisturbed as her family members fall prey to the monsters. Well, teenage girls are pretty self-absorbed so I guess I can buy that.

Nailbiter isn't an ""edge of my seat"" movie by any means. I wasn't biting my nails. On the other hand, the friend with whom I watched it in the dark (and who motivates me to watch horror movies I would normally bypass, which includes most of them) jumped a few times, although she's easily frightened. I wouldn't watch it again but I didn't feel like turning it off before the end. I would give Nailbiter 3 1/2 stars if I could.",1414540800,,1529,4.719101123595506
8571320,3,B00BN3DUO6,"this film is recommended to film students only.  A good script, a good cast. the ULTIMATE ending was good. the only thing missing was TENSION. A good companion piece to watch this with is The Descent. Almost the same setup, a group of women, with this one it's a mom and three daughters, trapped and looking for a way out. The tension in The Descent is palpable and keeps you on the edge of your seat. With Nailbiter there is no tension. The average girl would be hysterical and in a panic, with this group.....nothing. It's watchable because the story is good and short, but you never get the sense that the girls believe they are in danger.  They are acting as they are told too....but not pushed too the extreme, which is where they should be. Even tighter editing would have enhanced the tension, but it's not there.",1411948800,2,820,4.496644295302014
