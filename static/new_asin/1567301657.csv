7796790,5,1567301657,"Absolutely beautiful.  My second favorite film of all time.  A little bittersweet at the end.  The film has a lot of symbolism in it.  The colors and filming around Nice, France are beautiful.  Remember, if we don't stop and love others and help others and make a difference, then in the end, all we are left with is a stone in our heart.  One could also say, that if we really don't have a family (a loving one) we can create a family in the friends and people close to us all around us.",1210291200,2,488,4.138297872340425
7796791,5,1567301657,"This film was moving.
It touches on all on those special places in our heart that ALL of us have, with the unique element of something that is almost indescribable; the ""free spirit"".
It has many admirable aspects, and I would recommend this movie to anyone - especially to anyone who 'appreciates' a really good movie.",1034467200,7,319,4.714285714285714
7796792,5,1567301657,"I experienced Mondo as an incredibly beautiful and moving portrait, not only of a (child) character, but also symbolically of the ""True Self"" in each of us.  There is a delicate balance between how the vagaries of life and society impact personal connection and how human uniqueness and fundamental goodness transcend loss. There is above all poetry, playfulness, deepness and humanness in abundunce. Unforgettable.",993600000,11,415,5.484375
7796793,5,1567301657,"This film is an amazing metaphor for the idea of the ""restless and  free"" gypsy, and is a wonderful counterbalance to the notion of  settlement proposed for sinti and roma populations in the EU.  This is not  about a run away child a la Salaam Bombay, but a mythical spirit who  touches the lives of outcast people in a society riven with prejudice  against the gypsies.  watch it for its incredible cinematography, brilliant  performances, and spectacular moral.",968457600,12,463,4.922077922077922
7796794,1,1567301657,"The plot is very weak: good guys against bad guys. But what I am really mad at is the ""message"" stuff.
 I would not normally care about the message that much. But look what is happening: The movie is about a homeless kid. His life is just wonderful. The moment he gets hungry, a  kind old lady gives him bread. The moment he gets sick, another kind old  lady takes care of him. Everybody is so nice and kind, and his life is so  wonderful, until the police arrive. He is taken away and put into school.  What a crime.
 The thing would be laughable, if I did not know that  seeing this movie (and it is beautifully shot) would make some real kids  run away from home in search of such life. And then they would experience  real homelessness. It is not so pretty for homeless kids in Hollywood. They  often go hungry. They get beaten by older kids and other homeless people.  They often get hooked on drugs, or sniff glue. They are often raped. Many  go into prostitution real early. They get veneric diseases. They get  killed. I am sure it is not that different in France. And deceiving real  kids with these beautiful lies about beautiful homelessness is just a  terribly irresponsible act. The producer must be a terribly irresponsible  person.
 It is all the more surprising, since I love Tony Gatlif's  previous movie ""Lacho Drom"". This one does not come anywhere near  it.
 I can name three movies about homeless kids right off the bat:  ""Salaam, Bombay"", ""Pixote"" and ""Shoeshine"".  All three are honest: they show homeless life just as it is.
  ""Gabbeh"" is a fantasy, but ""Mondo"" is a lie. There is a  major difference. ""Mondo"" is similar to Bertolucci's recent movie  ""Stealing Beauty"". How many girls will go into sex looking for  such light beautiful relationship, only to end up in empty spiritless  screwing. Again, because the producer chose to be irresponsible and to tell  lies.
 I wish I could send an e-mail to Tony Gatlif. I feel really bad  about one thing: by paying for the ticket, I supported the movie. And that  means I support the lie the movie stands for. And when some kids do run  away from home, I am partly responsible for this.",964569600,24,2157,4.51948051948052
