8758266,2,B01EB2Z5V6,"I'd like to make 3 points about this DVD,

1. It is by far not the best Shchedrin's work. It is especially sad, because he claims that Nikolai Leskov is one of his favorite writers, but IMO he was not able to give this Leskov's funny and tragic story the adequate operatic interpretation. I realize that other viewers/listeners may disagree.
2. Andrei Popov is wonderful as a title character, but all others (except,maybe, Kristina Alieva) act and sing as amateurs.
3. The sound balance is terrible - the orchestra is always much louder than the singers. Normally the DVD of such sound quality would not be issued by any reputable label, but it seems that the ""Mariinsky"" label does not care about such things.

Overall - if you are interested in Shchedrin and/or Leskov - you may want this DVD for information purposes. Otherwise - don't bother.",1471651200,7,846,4.7482993197278915
