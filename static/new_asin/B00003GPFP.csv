An interesting sidebar:  Leonard Nimoy made his first screen appearance (uncredited) in this movie.",1030492800,6,289,5.0
1329646,1,B00003GPFP,"I thought this was the wonderful old movie about the cat and a baseball team.  I was so excited to see it, and VERY upset that it's not the correct Rhubarb.  Would the powers that be PLEASE put the old Rhubarb on video, as it's a classic!!!  Plus where the phrase ""Having a Rhubarb"" in baseball comes from.",1030147200,5,306,4.241379310344827

7918724,1,B00003GPFP,I got a British movie about a bunch of golfers.  I guess I should have read all the reviews instead of the first one!  DO NOT order this movie if you are wanting the 50's classic about a cat and a baseball team.,1107648000,8,211,3.883720930232558
7918725,1,B00003GPFP,"I can't vouch for this site, but I believe copies of the Ray Milland film are available at [...] -perhaps the info will help, if not, at least you can keep on the search:-)",1073779200,7,172,4.088235294117647
7918726,1,B00003GPFP,"Add me to the list of those looking for the 1951 Ray Milland film about the cat who inherits a baseball team.  FYI, AMC lists it in its library but does not have it scheduled for airing at the present (11/2003).  They responded to my request to buy a copy with a thank you for interest, but licensing restrictions prevent them from being able to do so.  Who knows who hold the licensing rights?  Anyone reading this know?  Maybe the Rhubarb crowd can convince them that it would be worthwhile to print it and sell it.  Can Amazon use its muscle to help its customers with this?  I have been advised by AMC that Paramount hold the rights to the film and they would control its release on video.  I am exploring that lead.",1068163200,6,720,4.32089552238806

I totally agree with the viewer from Bothell, WA about starting a movement to get the movie about Rhubarb the cat on video.  It is a great movie for all ages. I too saw it when I was a little girl.....so funny and cute!  I can not believe that the makers of videos (and money) would leave that one out! It was also a popular book. Let me say it....WE WANT RHUBARB (the cat)!!! WE WANT RHUBARB (the cat)!!! WE WANT RHUBARB (the cat)!!! WE WANT RHUBARB (the cat)!!! WE WANT RHUBARB (the cat)!!! WE WANT RHUBARB (the cat)!!
