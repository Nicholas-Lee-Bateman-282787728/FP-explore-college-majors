The reason I liked this DVD is because it is quick if you want a nice pick me up. It involves a lot of leg action. It doesn't just have to be done in the evening. I don't find that the pace is too slow, and it is a nice one if you are looking to squeeze in a quick workout (about 20 minutes) It does have a leg workout afterwards I believe, but I haven't done that, I am all for the walking. If you are a Sansone fan and are familiar with her series this one is somewhat like the power mile, she is by herself it is the same background, but involves more leg action without the weights. I recommend this one!",1135468800,24,727,3.9523809523809526

8124790,5,B0002OMKLG,"I've used workout dvds before, but this one is the first one I've stuck to, and used on a regular basis! It's a simple workout, easy for anyone to do, and feels really good when you're done! Leslie is upbeat, funny, and helps to motivate you. All of the movements in the dvd are easy to follow, and Leslie always says you can go back to just walking if you need to. I really like this. So many workout dvds are so high energy and it's hard to follow them, but I like that with this one, I know I can just go back to walking and not feel bad about it.

Overall, I think it's a really good low-impact workout, and it's fun to do any time! I normally do it in the morning.",1461024000,3,669,3.9555555555555557
