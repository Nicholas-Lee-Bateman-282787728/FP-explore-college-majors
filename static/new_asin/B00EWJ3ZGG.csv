5948960,2,B00EWJ3ZGG,"Ok first of all, I'm a big fan or Arjona since 1992... I was very excited when I knew he was going to release his first ever filmed Live concert, specially on blu ray. Well, the music is great but is just the annoying crazy fast shifting cameras that ruin the disc.. I mean, why not just stick to the artist and maybe switch between cameras from time to time, but no, the camera shifting just goes nuts every 2 seconds, even to the point that I got a headache, really. Like other reviewer said, we paid to see the artist not the crowd..

I rate this 2 stars just for the music, the video post-production is terrible",1392595200,2,615,4.211864406779661
5948961,5,B00EWJ3ZGG,I bought it for my wife.  She's a super Arjona fan.  Great material for collection. You will really enjoy it.,1388448000,,109,4.4
5948962,5,B00EWJ3ZGG,"Good music show, if you like ricardo arjona style. I will buy again the next blu ray for sure.....hope it is a live one too",1387497600,,123,3.96
5948963,1,B00EWJ3ZGG,"Dont buy this. Too much post-production. We pay to see the artist, not the audience.
This a commercial video, not a concert.
Too much lipsinging, no worth the money",1386028800,5,164,4.689655172413793
5948964,5,B00EWJ3ZGG,Great concert by Guatemalan songwriter Ricardo Arjona.  BD quality and sound are really great. True to his worlwide tour Metamorfosis.,1385337600,,134,5.7
5948965,3,B00EWJ3ZGG,"To be clear, this concert has great sound, so it is a joy to sit down and listen to. Five stars.
Sadly, this Blu Ray concert is nowhere near to being perfect.
Like I said, the sound quality is extremely good, but it is a little too good for a live performance. A lot of post-production work has been done, stealing that quality that live performances have. Now this isn't necessarily a bad thing, but more of a preference of mine.
Now, the real reason I give this three stars is because of the editing. The video quality is great as well, but I don't know who had the horrible idea to intertwine different video segments every 1-2 seconds. Every couple of seconds you are seeing a different shot. Arjona singing for 2 seconds - shot of the audience singing along - Arjona again - drummer - audience - Arjona - audience - Arjona - audience - audience - etc...
This is too distracting. It just doesn't stop.
To make things worse, the shots don't even match up with the others. You might see a shot of Arjona sitting down on a chair with the backrest up front, then cut to the audience, then Arjona is suddenly with the chair in a correct position, and then standing up (all in a matter of seconds.) Sometimes some of the shots show him not singing at all when he is supposed to!
If the CD/DVD sound quality is as good, you are better off buying that and just listening to it instead of watching it.",1383696000,9,1396,4.311787072243346
5948966,5,B00EWJ3ZGG,"I bought both the DVD and Bluray. The quality is great. An amazing addition to my collection. If you are Ricardo Arjona fan, you need this. It is a must have.",1383350400,,158,4.129032258064516

8610072,5,B00EWJ3ZGG,Bought this as a gift for a wonderful young woman from Mexico.  I don't understand Spanish but enjoyed watching this video.  Arjona tells a beautiful story with each song and seeing how the crowds react to the music was delightful.,1500595200,,231,4.75

8610077,5,B00EWJ3ZGG,"Arjona as usual doesn't disappoint. To clarify what another reviewer stated; Arjona never ever lycsync. The audio is perfect to enjoy at 100% and the swiching between cameras represents shots from different concerts. If you are a real Arjona fan you will rate this concert 5 stars and won't rely in the blu-ray quality, which I personally believe is nothing but perfection...",1418169600,,375,5.064516129032258
8610078,2,B00EWJ3ZGG,"First of all im a huge arjona fan for about 20 years now and I actually went to this concert tour. The sound quality is great, however the editing is horrible, as others have said, the shot changes literally every 2 seconds, arjona, drummer, audience, arjona, keyboard.... It can make you have seizures!!, at least it gave me a headache. Its a shame it could have been a great video.",1415404800,,383,4.485714285714286
