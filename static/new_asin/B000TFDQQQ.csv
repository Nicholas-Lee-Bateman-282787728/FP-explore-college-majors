8208867,5,B000TFDQQQ,"Let me start by saying I have watched a lot of basketball training videos. The better basketball series, etc.
This is the best, hands down. No BS. No time wasted. Straight to the moves, and all the ones you need to know, and want to know. If you master the skills shown in this video you will be an animal in the post. One of my favorite basketball training videos, and in my opinion the best of the all american series.",1420675200,,420,4.197530864197531
8208868,3,B000TFDQQQ,"Be prepared for some stuttering on the dvd as it seems that the frame rate is off. However this is a decent dvd for beginners who are new to the game.

However for their sake I wish he would of gone into hand, hip and foot position before recieving the ball and how to fight for it down low especially if a defender is denying you or has a good X step. On that note defense is completley ignored. Search around there are better dvds out there.

Also be prepared...what he calls ""drills"" are really just post moves. The only true drill is at the start, the Miken drill which he just calls ""a nice warm up drill"".

There are some positives though. He has some great explanations of the moves at the high post and at the 13 foot.

This is the first review Ive written for Amazon but this is more just a devils advocate piece against the glowing reviews Ive seen on here.",1201132800,3,867,4.204819277108434
8208869,5,B000TFDQQQ,"This has been one of the best Post play video i have seen. Straight to the point. NO time wasted here. What I really love is how he just shows you move after move without BSing on to fill up time. You can order better basketball's post play and listen to them ramble for 2 hours without getting to the point, or if you just want to learn the moves that will score you points watch this. Not too much focus on defense as one reviewer pointed out, but thats not why I ordered this DVD.",1199232000,,483,4.041666666666667
8208870,5,B000TFDQQQ,Coach Godwin did it again!  He's provided a flawless and professional DVD that touches on all fundamentals of basketball play! I endorse this DVD as a must have!  It is a necessary tool if you are trying to improve your game -- your kids will love it too!!,1187481600,,256,4.3125
8208871,5,B000TFDQQQ,I bought this DVD for my kid after watching The Fundamentals of Scoring and it was very helpful.  It showed my 14 year old the fundamental post moves that I have been talking about for years.  We now have plan for the off season. Great Video!!!,1184112000,,244,4.282608695652174
