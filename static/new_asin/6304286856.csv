839714,4,6304286856,"Videotapes first became popular in 1980, and Fitzwilly, one of my favorite films, had been made 13 years before. So naturally the arbitrary powers that be kept the video version off the shelves for over 20 years!

But finally this lost Dick Van Dyke treasure is available on tape, and we can only hope that its DVD version will not be another pan-and-scan nightmare like Chitty Chitty Bang Bang was. Remember that both Chitty and Fitzwilly were shot in Panavison, meaning that only a widescreen format can do them justice on DVD.

Yes, Van Dyke's Mary Poppins and Bye Bye Birdie are available in beautiful widescreen, but they really dropped the ball with Chitty. I was astounded when the DVD of it was finally released, and noticed that they had taken a film about a flying car yet - and reduced half the picture down to dismal pan-and-scan, which also reduced by 50% the feeling the viewer gets of flying.

I can now happily note, however, that the studio finally woke up and later released a widescreen version of Chitty, after their dismal standard frame dud bit the dust. The makers of Willy Wonka also released a far superior version of their film in widescreen - after likewise goofing up by first putting out a similarly lousy pan-and-scan bomb. But sadly, such repenting studios later showing they have ""seen the light"" about widescreen are very rare.

Tech specs aside, as to the plot of Fitzwilly itself, the Robin Hood bunch does keep some money to maintain their households but funnels the rest of it through the old lady's hands into the hands of the poor. In the end, some rich businesses got stung a bit (but they were insured) and the lives of hundreds of poor folks were enriched. The only one who would gripe about something like that happening would be some other selfish rich businessman.

Dick Van Dyke has for decades been one of the Top 5 comedians of all time, and Fitzwilly is one of his Top 5 movies. Need one say more? Only this - oh great creators of Fitzwilly, please release this movie soon on DVD and make it in WIDESCREEN !!!",1082937600,10,2058,4.5967302452316074
839715,4,6304286856,"Dick Van Dyke plays the title character of this 1967 comedy, a butler whose full name is Claude Fitzwilliam.  He is in service to Miss Victoria Woodworth (Edith Evans), who comes from old money, which has now run out.  Even worse, Miss Vicki is committed to a lot of philantrophic endeavors.  However, Fitzwilly and the rest of the staff are dedicated to making sure she does not find out and towards that end they come up with creative (okay, criminal) ways of making money.  Now, servants taking care of their mistress is an effrontery to Marxist thought if you are talking Karl, but if your leanings are more towards Groucho then you can appreciate the humor.
There is also a romantic subplot between Fitzwilly and Juliet Nowell (Barbara Feldon, in a credible first screen appearance for the co-star of television's ""Get Smart"").  But the part of this film that I remember most fondly is the ""Dictionary for Dopes"" that Miss Vicki is working on.  Her idea is that people who do not know how to spell need a dictionary that makes it easier for them to find the correct spelling, working from all the possible phonetic spellings of a problematic word.  The idea always appealed to me since my spelling is so atrocious that even spellcheckers are thwarted by my creativity, but there is also a nice little twist regarding Miss Vicki's dictionary as well.  The project is what requires the hiring of Juliet, who cannot be entrusted to know what the rest of the staff is up to with their fun little capers.
This is an enjoyable film, mainly on the strength of Van Dyke's charming performance, which overcomes the dubious morality of the shenanigans that are going on.  You will recognize a host of well-known character actors such as John McGiver, Cecil Kellaway, Norman Fell, Laurence Naismith and John Fielder.  The score and song ""Make Me Rainbows"" are the work of young composer John Williams, who, for the last time, was credited as ""Johnny Williams.""  Speaking of variations on a name, this film was known as ""Fitzwilly Strikes Back"" in the United Kingdom and was also released as ""A Garden of Cucumbers.""",1068940800,19,2109,4.766483516483516
839716,5,6304286856,"Dick Van Dyke and Barbara Feldon are absolutely charming in this lighthearted comedy fluff. Van Dyke plays the title character Fitzwilly (short for the more proper Fitzwilliam) who is the butler and head of the household staff for an eccentric but lovable philanthropist whom he addresses as Miss Vickie; Feldon plays Juliet a Columbia University graduate that Miss Vickie hires as a secretary for the purpose of assisting her in writing a ""dictionary for illiterates"" - listening to Miss Vickie's explanation will provide you with some genuine laughter. Miss Vickie is quite a charitable person, making sizable donations to nearly anyone who will call on her at home and ask her. Fitzwilly has kept his employer out of financial straits by resorting to pulling off some rather clever criminal thefts at nearly every upscale department store in New York City. He accomplishes these feats of derring-do with the assistance of the rest of the household staff who are expert con men and pickpockets. When Juliet joins the staff her nosy nature and honest desire to protect her new employer puts the whole scheme in jeopardy; when they're found out it's up to Fitzwilly to run interference on Juliet so the staff can keep Miss Vickie ""cash rich"" and keep themselves out of jail!
As I said this movie is a piece of fluff that has tremendous appeal if you are partial to either of the two stars or the kinds of comedy capers that the late sixties made so great back then. Not only are Van Dyke and Feldon fun to watch but the rest of the cast is rounded out with many familiar faces such as John McGiver as the footman and expert pickpocket (and former minister!) Albert; Norman Fell is quite funny as the neurotic head of finances at Gimbels; Cecil Kellaway appears briefly as the affable elderly gentleman who operates the ""thrift store"" the con men (and women!) use as a front; John Fielder is a gullible piano store salesman, a pigeon waiting to be plucked by Van Dyke; the household staff is cast with many faces you will recognize - most noticeably a very young Sam Waterston making his film debut. All of the capers that they pull off are great and will give you a smile each time they con someone. They range from the very elaborate to the very simplistic; early in the film one of the women reports that she was able to return a tie for a full refund at seventeen different stores with the same receipt - a new record Fitzwilly proclaims! But the showstopper involves a very daring and intricately planned Christmas Eve robbery at Gimbels department store that has to be seen to believed. One of the steps involves having one of the con men walk up behind unsuspecting ladies and pinching their rears. The women react, as one would expect them to, by turning and slapping the man nearest them! Great Fun! Another big plus is that Alan & Marilyn Bergman provide the perfect song ""Make Me Rainbows"" for the film.
For years I had been forced to get by with only a poor videotape copy of a cable TV presentation of 'Fitzwilly' filled with countless commercial interruptions. Then I happily discovered that it had finally been released on cassette and available at Amazon. This is the first movie my parents took me to see and all I could remember for years afterwards was Juliet finding the basement filled with the gang's ill-gotten booty and the great comedic finale at Gimbels. Now that I have a legitimate videotape of 'Fitzwilly' it has become my favorite film to watch on Christmas Eve...next to 'It's A Wonderful Life' that is.",1041638400,52,3533,4.7
839717,5,6304286856,"A nice little film about a holiday heist that will warm the cockles of your pocketbook.
Dick is a old fashioned butler with a a new angle on the Robin Hood game: Rob from the Very Rich and keep as much as you can.
Worth watching once a year, if only to get the saccarine of the other holiday fare out of your mouth.",1009324800,5,315,3.9375
839718,5,6304286856,"This is an excellent Christmas film for the nostalgic, as it does date back to the late sixties.  There is charm and the Van Dyke mystic, plus a wonderful performance from (agent 99) Barbara Feldon.  The plot is simple, the Butler (of course had to do it) must bring in money to keep the woman he works for (a mother figure to him) from knowing she was broke.  He does this thru inventive criminal activity (stealing like only the rich can do).  He must keep an outsider (the new secretary played by Barbara Feldon) from finding out and in the process falls in love, as does she, and so she doesn't run to the police when she finds out.  I simply love the main caper, pulled at Gimbles department store pre-christmas.  It is charming.  Perhaps this was Gimbles answer to Macy's Miracle on 34th Street.  It brings back my happy memories of Family Christmas time in the late sixties. A wonderful film!",1003708800,15,899,4.506172839506172
839719,1,6304286856,"For some reason I am having a hard time reviewing  this movie. I wonder if it's due to the fact that I  found it dull and sluggish. Oh sure, the story is  touching and all, but this one just didn't do it for me.  Which is quite surprising since I think Dick Van  Dyke is a wonderful actor. Van Dyke plays Claude  Fitzwilliam, better known as Fitzwilly. Fitzwilly is a  butler with a giant heart. Employed by Victoria  Woodworth (played by Edith Evans), a kind elderly  lady who has managed to trick herself and the  outside world into believing that she is worth a  fortune. Trick herself? Now that's something I gotta  learn to do; then maybe I won't feel so bad next  time I spend a ton on clothes! Anyhow, Fitzwilly  and fellow servants, being the committed employees  they are, must engage in all sorts of criminal  behavior in order to keep up this charade. Can you  believe Mrs. Vicki is even giving money she doesn't  have to charity? When Mrs. Vicki hires a secretary,  Juliet Nowell (played by Barbara Feldon), Fitzwilly  must try and keep their criminal activity hidden. So  a romance ensues, as he attempts to distract Juliet  (and I would guess the writers' attempt at making  the story line a bit more interesting as well). One  good thing about this movie is that I watched it after  a bad day and found myself smiling.... I kept  hearing the song ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" in my  head, so I suppose the movie had nothing to do  with it.",969926400,2,1451,4.4559386973180075

839902,4,6304286856,"Wonderful family film, if in the anti-hero mode. Van Dyke's performance is somewhat stilted, but Feldon gives a spot-on counterpoint that somehow allows us to overlook this. Edith Evans steals every scene in which she appears, and I'd watch just about anything just to see her. The supporting cast is also interesting, with an appearance by a very young Sam Waterston.",1506988800,,368,5.049180327868853

839909,5,6304286856,"This has been a favorite movie of mine since childhood. I was a Navy brat and often I would be sent, with my brothers and sisters, to the base movie theater just to get me out of my parents' hair. The movie one Saturday was ""Fitzwilly."" I had no idea what it was about, only that it starred Dick Van Dyke and Barbara Feldon, who I knew from their TV shows. The movie captured my heart from the opening scenes. As movies at the base theater were only a dime in those days, I dug into my piggy bank and went back to see it several more times. (I used to do that sort of thing as a kid.)

I rediscovered the movie in adulthood and have added it to my holiday movie lineup. It's still so much fun to watch, as Van Dyke leads his happy-and-willing staff of butlers, footmen, housekeepers and cooks through various capers as con men and thieves.",1482019200,2,839,4.179012345679013

If you tend toward being jaded you'll hate it. You'll rip it to shreds as it may well deserve.

840133,4,6304286856,"This is an absolutely delightful film. Don't be scared off by the ""DVD-R media"" thing. The picture quality is good and the DVD comes in a real case with real artwork and a professional, though rather generic looking label. What it DOESN'T have is an on-screen DVD menu, subtitles (much needed), specific chapter stops at key scenes, or special features of any kind. Instead, the chapter stops are set every 5 minutes. For what's missing in usual DVD perks I would think the price would be lower, but you will be delighted that this otherwise out of print film is finally being made available and should get it while you can. You should not let the DVD-R media thing scare you away from buying this movie. If you loved this movie as a kid (like me) it holds up very well all of these decades later. The film is in beautiful widescreen with vibrant colors and I didn't notice any scratches or splices in the presentation. The sound is mono. But be forewarned: DVDR discs are fragile and not as durable as regular DVD discs. They seem to attract scratches and fingerprints from out of nowhere. The disc should be in its case at all times when it is not in the DVD player.

The humor required for this type of film is not pulled off by Dick Van Dyke.  In 1967 Dick was hot off of his roll as Rob Petrie in The Dick Van Dyke Show, and he is too ""Rob Petrie"" here for this roll.
Barbera Feldon is just embarking on her roll as ""99"" in Get Smart and falling for criminal Dick Van Dyke because is is only robbing the insurance companies is not convincing.

I didn't like this film when I saw it as a kid in the theaters, I thought maybe I was too young to understand the humor, but I still don't like it now.",1406419200,,620,3.9919354838709675

840576,3,6304286856,"Fitzwilly is a sprightly 1967 comedy that sees Dick Van Dyke's butler and the assorted household staff running a neat line in grand larceny to keep Edith Evans in the style she is accustomed to and ignorant of the real impoverished state of her finances after years of giving away money she doesn't have to good causes. It's not exactly Robin Hood, what with its robbing from the rich to give to the former rich, but since she's giving to the poor and it's all so good natured that's not really a problem. Naturally a fly turns up in the ointment when Evans hires Barbara Feldon as her new secretary for the dictionary for people who can't spell that she's writing: she just can't figure out why someone as smart as Van Dyke would want to be a butler...

It's more of a pleasant little movie than a laugh out loud comedy, the scams not always entirely convincing and the final heist at Gimbels on Christmas Eve having to be taken with the same pinch of salt as the film's rather flexible morality. Mary Poppins fans will be pleased/horrified (delete as applicable) to note that Van Dyke's cockaknee aksunt makes a return appearance in one scene, with the master linguist adding a bad French one to his repertoire along the way while Barbara Feldon sports a wardrobe, hairstyle and glasses that must have been the inspiration for Velma in Scooby Doo a couple of years later. There are plenty of familiar faces in the supporting cast, from John McGiver and a young Sam Waterston among the staff, John Fiedler and Norman Fell among the marks and Cecil Kellaway and an unbilled Laurence Naismith in throwaway roles that don't make even the slightest demand on their talents but doubtless helped them live in the style they were accustomed to. There's also a jaunty score from John Williams in the days when he was still Johnny Williams to move things nimbly along.

MGM's NTSC manufactured on demand DVD-R offers an inconsistent but mostly more than acceptable 2.35:1 widescreen transfer but not extras - there's not even a menu, with the film simply playing on a loop.",1353196800,4,2065,4.670329670329671

To keep her spirits going, Barbara Feldon is hired as a secretary but Miss Feldon becomes suspicious of Fitzwilly and some of the antics she spies the other servants doing. Fitzwilly decides to keep her off guard by making a play for her but falls for her in the end all the while he and the crew do one last big heist during the Christmas season. Things go wrong and, when it all seems bleak, a twist at the end makes everything right!  I've waited a long time for this film to come out on DVD, and it's better than I remember it.

Hot Toasty Rag, October 17, 2017

In this silly sixties flick, Dick Van Dyke is the butler to the wealthy Edith Evansonly shes not very wealthy. The truth is, shes practically broke. But, to keep his beloved mistress living in luxury, Dick and the rest of the household staff, including John McGiver and Sam Waterston, pull cons and robberies. When a new secretary, Barbara Feldon, is hired, will she ruin all their schemes?

Without Dick van Dyke, the film would be pretty flat. Hes easy to root for, even though hes a criminal, and his usual enthusiastic energy gives the film just enough pizazz to keep audiences interested. Barbara Feldon is pretty annoying, so I couldn't understand why the other characters liked her so much. Still, the script is pretty clever, and John Williamss music is cute and fitting, so if you like Dick van Dyke movies, check out this well-intentioned heist film on a rainy afternoon or during Christmastime, since one of their jobs takes place during the holiday.",1508198400,,1015,4.861271676300578
