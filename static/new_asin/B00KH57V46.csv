6426415,3,B00KH57V46,"This was suggested to me as a cute fun show. It involves a school club girl band and their daily real life distractions. I think they sat around drinking tea and eating snacks more than playing music. At times, months skip by presumably because there was nothing significant going on. This show might have more appeal to me if they focused a little more on music and less about them goofing around. Not ecchi, so safe for many viewers with a couple of minor sexual humor type jokes earning it a ""TV 14 D"" rating.",1424476800,,512,4.4
6426416,5,B00KH57V46,I had K-On! Season 1 from Bandai and bought this because the back of the DVD showed scenes I haven't seen before which made me think this season had bonus scenes. It did not. The back was false advertisement. I really enjoy K-On! though and I had K-On!! Season 2 from Sentai so if anything I supported K-On series a bit I hope.,1422576000,,327,4.2063492063492065
6426417,4,B00KH57V46,"Another reviewer wrote an excellent review, so I'll just add my observations.
- I wish there were a Blu-ray release.
- That said, the video quality is excellent for a DVD release. (Perhaps it's because this animation didn't need a high bit rate; you don't see a lot of action sequences in this one. :-) The colors are bright and I didn't really notice any digital-compression artifacts.
- In episode 1, they replaced the (short) instrumental version of Tsubasa wo Kudasai with Love Me Tender. It served the scene just as well, but I wish they kept the original Japanese soundtrack.

Highly recommended if this is your cup of, ahem, *tea*. (Set in a high school, girls playing in a band, having delicious desserts, etc.)",1421712000,2,719,4.752
6426418,4,B00KH57V46,"My daughter's love anime. This is a really cute show. It is about friendship and loyalty and acceptance. 4 girls join the Light Music Club and form a band. They become very good friends and are always willing to help each other out. They don't exclude their other friends or family. I love their example for the girls who watch this. My only complaint about this one is the translation. My daughter knows some Japanese and she said the translation is off on some of the words and the caption reads swear words instead of the actual word. An example is the word ""annoying"" is written as another ""a"" word. I keep my young son occupied with something else so he won't be reading the captions.",1420070400,2,689,4.476190476190476
6426419,4,B00KH57V46,"K-On! is a light-hearted comedy about the members of an all-girls high school's Light Music Club. Together, the 4 members of this club (along with their friends, club adviser and, later, a 5th member) drink tea, have snacks, do & say cute things cutely, and every now & then play music. If you like:

-music
-high school-themed anime
-cute girls
-cat ears or
-cute high school girls wearing cat ears

Then this is an anime you might wanna' check out.

One thing to note, in case you were unaware, is that this release from Sentai is the 2nd release of K-On! season 1 as a complete DVD collection--the first being from Bandai back in 2012&nbsp;]. Here are the 3 main differences between the 2 sets:

1) Number of discs...
Bandai's set is 4 discs and Sentai's is 3. They're both in standard size DVD cases so there's no need to worry about shelf space. And I'm not picky (or knowledgeable) when it comes to difference in quality, compression, image loss, and whatever else, but considering Sentai squeezed on 3 discs what Bandai put on 4 [which is 14 episodes, by the way], you might be concerned about this. Well, I didn't notice anything bad. To be fair, it also went from 4 discs to 3 because there are less special features but I'll get to that later.

2) Dub/Sub...
Both have original Japanese audio with English subtitles and English audio. Sentai did not redo the English dub (same studio and voices for season 2 and the movie as well, which Sentai also has licenses for) but they did do some touch-ups on the subtitles. The translation is still the same--I want to make that clear--and even if the differences aren't major enough to be deal breakers, they are still different and I wanted to note some of them.

-The opening and closing credits were translated from Japanese to English with Bandai but are kept with Sentai. What Sentai does is they add their credits at the end of every episode (the standard black with white text scrolling upward)

-The themes for the opening and closing credits are presented with English subtitles and Romaji for every episode with Bandai but Sentai alternates between English subtitles and Romaji

-When long lines are displayed, there are differences in things like: displaying it on 2 lines, the use of ""..."" (ellipses) or dashes, how much text is squeezed on one line, the timing, how to handle simultaneous speakers (Bandai would keep both characters' lines yellow but differentiate them with a leading dash whereas Sentai would put one in yellow and the other white)

-Finally, a difference in some capitalization, placement, and maybe a word or two difference

As you can see, nothing major is different. Heck, I had to watch an episode from both releases simultaneously to find these differences. I was just that curious...

3) Special features...
This is where the release from Bandai and Sentai differ greatly. Bandai had special features for interviews with the English voice actresses and 2 clips featuring K-On! songs in English. And I don't mean they had English subtitles. I mean they were sung in English! Sadly, neither were for the entire song, but heck, awesome! (The 2 songs were ""Fluff Fluff Time"" [Fuwa Fuwa Time] and ""My Love is a Stapler"" [Watashi no Koi wa Hotch Kiss (something like that...)]). The special features in the Sentai release are textless opening & ending and clips for other titles available from Sentai.

Apparently, there are these 3-minute clips called ""Ura-On!"" that exist on the Japanese releases (I think...they gotta' be somewhere!) but they aren't in either release. From my understanding, they're just a few side/bonus/mini episodes that aren't crucial to the series, but any more K-On! is always a good thing. And since Sentai has the licenses for all the K-On! anime (seasons 1 & 2 and the movie) and this didn't include it, I don't see it being released in North America at all. But heck, there's still the High School and College manga volumes that have yet to be animated. If they ever do get animated, well, who knows...

If you don't have K-On! on DVD or blu-ray yet, it's up to you to use this information to decide which one you want. If you have Bandai's season 1 already...well...still...it's up to you to use this information to decide if you want to add this beside it. As for me, I like the extra features from Bandai so I won't be replacing that anytime soon. But to keep uniformity in my collection and support the anime industry, I happily put this in my collection along with my other K-On! DVDs.",1410912000,23,4505,4.730867346938775

8658601,5,B00KH57V46,"One of the best (if not the best) shows I have ever seen. If you can't speak Japanese then I recommend subtitles because nothing can compare to the original Japanese voice actors. They are the greatest reason why the characters (and the show) are so excellent. However, if you can speak Japanese then you will notice that some of the translations sometimes inaccurate, and in some rare cases, miss the mark completely. But then again, I do not love this show because of the subtitles. Even through less than ideal subtitles, the characters really shine, you do not  even need to understand what they are saying for you to appreciate such exquisite voice acting. I highly recommend both seasons of this show and the movie as well.",1468281600,,729,4.74015748031496

After hearing about the light music club Yui believes she has finally found the after school club for her. What follows is a delightful and hilarious slice of life that following the daily lives of the light music club members as they attend high school and engage in club activities.

The animation is gorgeous, the characters are adorable, the story is compelling and the English dub is fantastic making this series a must own for any music loving anime fans and one of my favorite animes!",1437609600,2,641,4.573913043478261
