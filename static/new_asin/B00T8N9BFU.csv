7003010,5,B00T8N9BFU,Instant underground classic. If Harmony Korine went and worked at Toe Tag pictures you'd get a flick this this. I was nauseated and captivated for the entire running time.  Transgressive movies are back!!,1431820800,,204,5.181818181818182
7003011,3,B00T8N9BFU,"Crazy Murder will be a film that is as controversial, disturbing and may even be banned in some places as time goes on. It offers a putrid slice of American life, one hidden in the seedy underbelly of our culture and on our dark, shadowy streets. The story, however loose it is, follows the further degradation of a truly sick individual as he battles his demons along a path of feces and death.

Watch at your own risk, not just for more sensitive fans but that caution should bold well for all horror and indie film fans. This is a one-of-a-kind experience. There isn't enough cleaner or drugs on this planet to scrub away what I have seen here, and I am not sure that that is a bad thing. It is like most art films, a piece that forces you to explore emotion and taste through experience.",1429142400,4,791,4.344594594594595

7003014,1,B00T8N9BFU,"When the beginning credits roll over a view of excrement stained white sweat pants, and lingers on this image, I had to wonder. I hope the girl in the first scene was calling her agent-- to fire him. Stopped the film less than 3 minutes in, and I want those 3 minutes back!",1451174400,2,273,4.169811320754717
7003015,3,B00T8N9BFU,"Quite possibly the most disturbing, disgusting and revolting film in cinematic history. Like John Waters once said, ""Like a septic tank explosion, it has to be seen to be believed."" Let's just say it makes PINK FLAMINGOS look like a Doris Day comedy.....and leave it at that.",1448409600,,275,4.872340425531915
7003016,5,B00T8N9BFU,Straight insanity! Lead actor was phenomenal. I see this film as more a piece of art than a movie.,1448323200,,98,4.2105263157894735

7003018,1,B00T8N9BFU,"If you're into scatology, this is the movie for you. Because, when he's not killing people (with surprisingly decent CGI gore effects), and occasionally mutilating his own genitals, the main character is excreting, playing with his excrement, or eating it. That's basically it, poop and death done ad nauseum, with some unconvincing homeless/mental-emotional issues rants thrown in to pad the time. And, writing of padding, there's the painfully long sequence with a woman serving as the barker for the NY Comedy Club, endlessly and flatly intoning the likes of ""Want to see a comedy show? Tickets here. Really good comedy show, starting soon. Want some tickets?"" Obviously intended as socially relevent transgressive cinema, this, er, turd is, rather, simply that.",1446940800,3,765,5.383333333333334

7003022,1,B00T8N9BFU,"So gross but not in a good way. I really don't know how anyone could like this film, just disgusting!!!",1445904000,,103,4.2
7003023,3,B00T8N9BFU,This was about one of the grossest movies I've seen in my entire life. Murder scenes were good. i guess people with strong stomachs will like this,1445558400,,146,4.444444444444445
7003024,3,B00T8N9BFU,"I've never seen so much blood and feces in one movie. This literally left a bad taste in my mouth. More than likely won't eat until I can remove this gentleman's unique brand of hygiene and discerning palette from memory. All in all, it's an interesting character. Growing up in NYC, there's no shortage of madmen. I've seen some things...but I've never seen anything quite like this.

If you've ever encountered an insane, homeless person that you want to observe, but all of your good senses tell you to cross the street and don't make any eye contact..this film begs to answer the question. ""What is this crazy mf'ers daily life like?"" Some questions should go unanswered though.

Overall, enjoyable if you have a stomach of steel and a penchant for gore. I would have given it 4 stars if he would have ""encountered"" a few of those hipster types sullying my beloved Brooklyn.",1445385600,,878,4.694805194805195
7003025,2,B00T8N9BFU,They picked the perfect actor to play the main character. This movie shows how many people out there really do have mental illness & how bad it can be. But if you have a weak stomach DO NOT watch this because the entire way thru you will be watching the most disgusting & vile movie i think was ever made. There was some gore but unfortunately the filth outweighed the gore. Plus how did this guy get away with all the crimes he did & why didn't the police cars that were around him in the scenes pick him up & take him to a mental institution or something?All those cars driving by & people walking by him plus im sure there were some witnesses to at least the daytime murders omg. Its like he just got away with everything all the way thru. Not very realistic.,1444521600,,762,4.190476190476191
7003026,5,B00T8N9BFU,"I live for B horror movies, and I've seen most disgusting things there are in film. This is not a B horror film!!! It's actually well acted and produced. However, this is the most disgusting film I've ever seen!!! There are several scenes where the protagonist takes dumps, and usually eats it. The murder scenes are good, but it's the crap eating that puts it over the top!!! I've never reacted to a movie like I have to this one!! I'm speechless!!!! A MUST SEE!!!!!!",1444262400,,468,4.517647058823529
7003027,1,B00T8N9BFU,"Batshit crazy dude walks around NYC with a blood-spattered face, and defecated-all-over pants, which no one minds or even barely appears to notice. They result from randomly killing people, or, in one case, defecating on someone in public at one of Manhattan's busiest squares (right south of Times Square), in the middle of the day, surrounded by at least 50 people. They have better things to do than intervene, and the police is probably busy with traffic tickets, or a new ueber-libertarian mayor has taken over. As an example for his cunning approach, in the middle of the night on a bench right outside Central Park (as far as I can tell), he sits down next to a 20ish woman and tells her that he killed his father...which leads to an instant cleverly defensive reaction by the woman: she stays, but turns away, even when he appears to begin to masturbate right next to her (in fact, he just grabs his giant knife which seems stored there). It's awful, but was fun zooming through in 15 minutes for its sheer involuntary insanity. (skimming the other reviews, do yourself a favor and disregard the obviously production team written ones declaring this turd ""important"", ""art"", ""an instant classic"", or ""comparable to Salo"" (don't make Pasolini turn in his grave))",1444176000,,1269,4.852534562211981
7003028,5,B00T8N9BFU,"This is a profoundly disgusting and disturbing film. Ken Kenny, who plays the murderer, is a truly gifted artist. I know that this film could be laughed at, but as a mental health professional, I think it comes closest of any film of showing the hellish life of the untreated psychotic person.",1444003200,5,293,4.653846153846154
7003029,3,B00T8N9BFU,"This film was in a word ""Insane"".... But I couldn't stop watching.

The film takes place on the streets of NYC where a  homeless psycho is running around killing anyone that gets in his way. Mostly other homeless and street people. You will really need to have a strong stomach to watch some of the scenes.

He constantly has poop smeared all over his face and in his mouth (Gag)plus he drools ,spits and vomits quite a bit. There really isn't much dialogue but it really isn't needed. It's basically a visual experience in bad taste and gore!

There are a lot of kills,some very well done and quite graphic. The third act is where the brunt of the gore occurs. It's not something I could watch again. But I'm not disappointed I watched it the first time. The actor (Kevin Kenny) who played the protagonist was really good and if there's an award for best portrayal of an insane person,he has it in the bag.",1442361600,2,907,4.445783132530121
7003030,5,B00T8N9BFU,Very hard and Sick Movie. Its one Man Show. Perfect playing.,1438041600,2,60,4.545454545454546
7003031,4,B00T8N9BFU,"Vile, disturbing, gross, and seriously hard to stomach.  However, if you are interested in watching movies that appear on the most disturbing or banned list, this movie certainly won't disappoint.  I winced through most of the movie or had to watch behind a notebook, but the scenes are definitely etched in my brain and will be hard to forget.  This is right up there with Salo and A Serbian Film.

I've lived a pretty sheltered life and found it unrealistic that people could witness these things and just walk on by and accept it, but reading the other reviews, sounds like that was the whole idea.",1437436800,,601,4.6415094339622645
8700960,1,B00T8N9BFU,"A mentally ill man covered with blood, vomit, feces, and garbage walks around the city with his pants at his ankles, a load in his draws, eating garbage, and stabbing people in the neck with a knife. That's it. Acting was great, I will give you that, but the entertainment value is what I question. Is this for people who thought ""Pink Flamingos"" would be good if they left out all the drama and went right to the feces eating part? Kudos Kevin Kenny, unless the just found you in the street.

Certainly there is a statement here about caring for the mentally ill and not letting homicidal maniacs loose on the street, but I think the standard boring documentary would work better, because half way through I was hoping for a gang of hooligans to beat the crap out of the homeless guy. In fact I may go out a kick a few around myself.

Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity. Just disgusting filth.

8700965,4,B00T8N9BFU,"Incredible performance by Kevin Kenny. When I looked him up on the IMDb after viewing this, I was half surprised he's a legit actor and not some lunatic the filmmakers picked up off the street. I'd give it five stars but that was way more poop than I ever needed to see. I used to work for a port-a-john company, driving a truck around and sucking the waste out of the johns, and this movie made me feel queasy. Poo aside, the convincing portrayal of insanity and mental anguish left me feeling emotionally drained by the end. Truly impressive, and I'm sure I'll view it again, but not anytime soon.",1465516800,,599,4.454545454545454

If you don't want details, please stop reading this review. All it is really is a man that's psycho living in the streets killing innocent people for no reason. he uses bad language against people and just swears at nobody. If that isn't enough to not make want to see the movie, he also eats his own poop as well as rubs his face in it. Sorry dear readers, but that is the truth. There is no ending. This movie should be banned in my opinion!!",1463270400,,600,4.050420168067227
