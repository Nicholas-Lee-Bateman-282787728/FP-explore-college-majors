1662979,5,B00005U13S,"The Vampire Bat from Little known Majestic Pictures does a great job of capturing the look and feel of classic Universal Horrors of the 1930's.  First it had a great cast featuring Lionel Atwill, Fay Wray, Melvyn Douglas, and Dwight Frye.  Frye plays Herman, a simple-minded fellow who may even be crazier that the Renfield role he played in Dracula just two years earlier.  Atwill, of course, was no stranger to Universal Horrors, having co-starred in The Son of Frankenstein, Ghost of Frankenstein, and Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man, to name just a few.  Also in the cast is Lionel Belmore as the Burgomeister.  Belmore played the exact role in the Original 1931 Frankenstein.  This may almost be the same village as in Frankenstein as well.

Several residents of Klineschloss have been killed.  Drained of their blood with two puncture wounds in their necks.  They immediately attribute the killings to a vampire.  The police inspecter Karl Brettschneider (Douglas) doesn't believe in vampires though.  And soon he sets his eyes on Herman Gleib as a suspect due to his affinity for bats.  Frye gives one of his great performances in this film...creeping and skulking about, eyes wide in a maniacal grin.  He really makes the movie for me.

Atwill is the town doctor, Dr. Otto von Niemann and he is assisted by Ruth Bertin (played by a dark haired Fay Wray) who is also in love with Karl.  When Herman is killed, and the murders continue, karl now has to set his sights on a new suspect...a very surprising suspect.

In some ways the Vampire Bat is a bit of a combination of Dracula with Frye and the apparent attacks, and Frankenstein, as Von Niemann is seeking to create his own form of life.  The fog shrouded, misty little German hamlet is straight out of Universal's horrors and the atmostphere is superb.  The only thing that really didn't work for me was the sappy love plot between Wray and Douglas.  Thankfully that was kept to a minimum.

All in all, Vampire Bat was a wonderful horror, well in the tradition of Universals classics.",1119830400,19,2046,4.7585227272727275

The Vampire Bat from Little known Majestic Pictures does a great job of capturing the look and feel of classic Universal Horrors of the 1930's.

German people in a German village in Germany (or Austria maybe) are turning up dead in their beds, with two puncture marks on their neck. The local big wigs are beginning to think that a vampire is stalking the town, but the local policeman thinks that's a load of superstitious crap. His case is not help by all the actual vampire bats in the area, and someone spotting a guy clambering about the roofs. Suspicion falls upon village idiot Hermann, who wanders about town at night, fondles bats, and generally doesn't do himself any favours.

Thrown into the mix are the local doctor and his servant Emil, who start off by dismissing the vampire theory and then believing it, plus his lovely assistant (who's girlfriend with the cop) and her Aunt, who is a hypochondriac to say the least. The cop's main problem, besides the murders, is that the locals are gearing up to lynching Hermann, so he better move fast.

Is there a vampire on the loose? Is the simple, bat-loving village idiot (every town should have one!) to blame? Or maybe the suave mad scientist (every town should have one!) has created artificial life in his lab and the thing feeds on human blood? I'd never dream of pointing out the true reason for the mayhem.

The movie comes across like a combination Dracula and Frankenstein, except we never see the monster. Heavy low-key lighting lends eerie effect, but movie has its creepiest moments with the hunched-over Herman (Frye) whose demented IQ appears capable of darn near anything. Watching him creep around the edges, mumbling some infernal thought makes the usually villainous Atwill seem positively benign. In fact, Atwill hardly changes expression the whole time making us wonder just what his deadpan scientist is really up to.

However, the filming is on a very primitive scale. Sets and costumes have the proper Gothic mood but the production is obviously a cheapie made in a hurry to capitalize on other films featuring Lionel Atwill and Fay Wray which were decidedly more polished.

Melvyn Douglas, looking very youthful, is studying the case and can't figure out who the real culprit is. By this time, the audience can guess that it's ""the one you'd least suspect.""

Low-budget horror film has its creepy moments...And most of them belong to Dwight Frye as the town idiot who specializes in cuddling bats--much to the horror of the village inhabitants.

It takes a while to get going, this one, but picks up roughly around the halfway mark. It's easy to spot who's really doing the murders, but that doesn't detract from enjoying the film. There's plenty of humour in here too, from the Aunt to Hermann himself, and mostly everything is wrapped up neatly at the end, although unless I missed it the presence of the bats isn't explained. As with most of these old films, this one is quite short and you shouldn't begrudge it too much, even if you don't like it.

Nonetheless, the very last scene still has me wondering and chuckling-- Epsom salts! Really!
This is a great classic film with some comedy mixed in with all this blood sucking.  Frankly its a damn good movie that has atmosphere to spare and a cast that won't quit,  Great viewing fun: this is the kind of film I watched as a kid late at night at sleepovers.  Summing up: Watchable as a primitive horror film from Majestic Studio with a reasonably good cast. Has the necessary ingredients for classic horror films of this era.

This is not a bad film. In fact, it's a good little film. If this sounds interesting to you, you can check out (a fairly poor quality) copy of the movie before you buy it.

If you enjoy these kinds of movies, I suggest you check out ""Svengooli"" (previously called Son of Svengooli) Svengooli is a hosted horror movie show. The show's title is taken from the name of the character host. The show is a long-running local program in the Chicago area and in recent years expanded nationally, airing Saturday nights on Me-TV. To make it even better: ""Svengooli"" (Rich Koz) is truly a nice & decent person in real life.

SPOILER ALERT
People are dying in the German town of Kleinschloss. They are found dead in bed and drained of blood. Burgermeister Gustave Schoen [Lionel Belmore] thinks that vampires are at large, but Detective Karl Brettschneider [Melvyn Douglas] thinks otherwise. When several people report being attacked by a giant bat, suspicion falls on Herman Gleib [Dwight Frye], the village idiot, who is known for befriending bats. When another person dies, Dr Otto von Niemann [Lionel Atwill] is called in to examine her body. He concurs with the vampirism theory. When yet another person is found dead, the word goes out that Herman must be captured.

In the meantime, von Niemann's maid Georgiana [Stella Adams] finds the crucifix of one of the victims in the bedroom of von Niemann's assistant, Emil Borst [Robert Frazer], and remembers that there were muddy footprints in Emil's bedroom the morning after a victim was murdered. At the same time, however, Herman is tracked to a cave but, when the townspeople attempt to take him, he panics and falls off a ledge. He is killed, and the townspeople finish the job by driving a stake through his heart.

Not knowing about Herman's death, von Niemann has hypnotized Emil to attack Georgiana in the same manner as the other victims. Emil brings her body to von Niemann's lab where she is hooked up to a machine which sucks the blood from two wounds made in her neck by a metal wraparound collar. A bit later, Karl and his girlfriend Ruth Bertin [Fay Wray] (who is also von Niemann's lab assistant) find Georgiana dead in her bedroom. Karl remembers that Herman was seen in the garden earlier that day, and the circumstantial case against him seems to tighten.

However, when the Burgermeister reports Herman's death, Karl realizes that the timing is wrong and that Herman was innocent. He swears to search for clues, but Dr von Niemann advises him to first get a good night's sleep and gives him some sleeping pills to help. Later that night, Emil climbs over the roof to Karl's bedroom. Meanwhile, Ruth overhears von Niemann sending a mental suggestion to Emil, and she suspects the truth. Von Niemann confirms her suspicion, explaining that he has created a life form (looks like a sponge in a jar) that demands blood for its continued growth. Von Niemann takes Ruth to the laboratory where they find Karl waiting for him. ""I didn't take your sleeping pills, Doctor,"" explains Karl. When von Niemann attempts to place the blame on Emil, Emil shoots him and then turns the gun on himself.",1443744000,,6793,4.751273344651953

The picture quality of the Spanish version is remarkably good, perhaps even better than the English version. The bits of background music in the Spanish version also enhances its interest level.

1663003,5,B00005U13S,"Say what you will about the other stars in this movie, but it's Maude Eburne as Gussie Schnappmann, a hypochondriac, who handily steals every scene she's in (and she should have been in a lot more).  The story is fairly basic, a mystery of sorts; although it's rather obvious at the outset who is doing what and why.  That's what comes of hiring a character actor who specializes in villains (Lionel Atwill as Dr. Otto von Niemann).  The hero of the piece is a sarcastic, sanctimonious inspector (Melvyn Douglas as Karl Breettschneider).  He spends most of the movie scorning those who dare to suggest there's a vampire on the loose killing the townsfolk for their blood.  Naturally, they have a suspect, a bat loving loony played by an expert in playing loonies, Dwight Frye as poor Herman Gleib.  They literally hound the poor sap to his death and come no closer to solving the mystery.  They also demonstrate a severe lack of remorse for his death (at least they buried him, or said they would).  Fay Wray plays along as Ruth Bertin, the mandatory damsel in distress (albeit late in the feature).  It's all rather fun.  Pity the quality of the transfer is so abysmal.  The night scenes and the all important cave sequence are all too dark.  The film is also littered with too much debris, marring the images.  Still, it is highly enjoyable and I'd rather have it in poor condition than not have it at all.",1428105600,,1408,4.606425702811245

1663006,4,B00005U13S,"Last night we watched 'The Vampire Bat' on Amazon Prime.  It's a  64 minute 1933 film featuring Fay Wray, Lionel Atwill and Dwight Frye.  This was another of those wonderful 1930s horror films I enjoy so much...there is so much magic in these old B/W films I can't get enough of them.  The story was a mystery with an interesting twist on what was happening.  Is it a vampire committing the murders or a man ? All we know is there are strange marks on the victim's necks and all their blood has been drained out. We have to wait to find out why and how ?  Vampire or man either way the viewer will not be disappointed by the weird finale. IMO, It's not as good as two other horror films with Lionel Atwill and Fay Wray from the same time period 'Doctor X' and 'Mystery of the Wax Museum', still it's fun and well worth watching for sure.  About my only complaint is Amazon had a pretty mediocre copy, lots of scratches in the print and the sound quality was hardly understandable at times.

Herman is a suspect as he plays with bats which are ""soft like a cat."" The film builds character and contains enough humor to make it an enjoyable watch. Interesting is that auntie is prescribed salicylic acid  (aspirin) for her heart.

1663009,4,B00005U13S,"No movie fan worth his/her salt will want to miss this 1933 outing for one of the most stylish actors ever to grace the Screen and  two of the Stars who made the films what they were in the thirties and forties. Of course, I speak of  Melvyn Douglas, who moved easily in the range between high drama and highly sophisticated comedy while pairing with many of the most desirable leading ladies of his era. The others, of course, are Fay Wray and Lionel Atwill, who were primarily part of the backbone of the B film produced by the Industry to make the second of the Double Feature with Newsreel, short subjects and coming attractions, de rigueur, for the screens of neighborhood theaters during the Great Depression and through the next two decades until television changed the nature of the entertainment world.
This is a standard horror film of the era, marked only by the patented performance of Atwill (see him later vis-a-vis Lee Tracy in a similar film), and the eye-candy looks of Fay Wray who does no screaming. As is true of this type of vehicle, there is no wasted time, the story is told, the scenery is limited, the words sparing. Yet, despite its familiarity and its being still in the era when film was learning to talk, most of the actors are adept with their lines, with Douglas performing as to the media born, Atwill doing his superior physician well, as always, and Fay Wray, looking very appealing. Mention should also be made of the actress playing the aunt of Fay Wray,  Maude Eburne (18751960). She remained a character actress for many years until here retirement, often  playing the fey character she here endows with qualities  not customary in B  pictures.
As to the pure entertainment side, in compressed and simplified form, it contains all the psychological and moral issues that far bigger and enormously more expensive films are still founded upon. As far as I am concerned it is about as good an hour's entertainment as one is likely to get from megabucks today (or in 1933).",1383264000,,2007,4.6875

1663033,3,B00005U13S,"When DRACULA hit movie screens in 1931 horror films became all the rage--and one of the most popular was the 1932 Technicolor film DR. X, starring Lionel Atwill, Fay Wray, and Lee Tracy.  The follow up was the 1933 Technicolor MYSTERY OF THE WAX MUSEUM, again starring Lionel Atwill and Fay Wray, this time supported by Glenda Farrell and Frank McHugh.  When post-production issues delayed the release of WAX MUSEUM, ""poverty row"" studio Majestic Pictures had a brain storm and hired Lionel Atwill and Fay Wray to star in the very low budget THE VAMPIRE BAT, which it managed to issue between DR. X and WAX MUSEUM and thereby steal some box office thunder.

In this story, the tiny village of Kleinschloss seems beset by a vampire that takes the form of a bat and drains his victims of blood.  Dr. Otto von Niemann (Atwill), young Karl Brettschneider (Melvyn Douglas, still a newcomer in 1933), and his lady love Ruth (Fay Wray) think the idea of vampires silly, but the villagers soon fasten suspicion on Herman Gleib (played by none other than Dwight Frye, who performed so memorably in such Universal horror films as DRACULA and FRANKENSTEIN.)  But although the hysterical villagers hunt down and kill Gleib, the deaths continue--and if he wasn't the vampire, then who among them is?

THE VAMPIRE BAT is never going to make a critic's top ten list of 1930s horror films, amd the story and script are somewhat weak, but in spite of an ultra-low budget the film looks surprisingly good.  Majestic Pictures accomplished this by packing the cast with well known names, but more importantly by renting sets on the Universal lot and filming at night to work around other film shoots in the day.  Given that most of the film is set at night, it works extremely well.

Sad to say, THE VAMPIRE BAT has fallen into public domain, and as a result DVD releases are many and of very mixed quality.  Even so, if you're a fan of 1930s horror, this is a seldom-seen little movie that is worth going out of your way to find.  Recommended for the fun of it.

The main story is that people are dying in the town of Klineschloss and it looks like a vampire is doing the killing. Brgermeister Gustave Schoen and the rest of the town council think it is a vampire, but the chief of police thinks that is nonsense. It is only at the end of the movie that it is the town doctor that is doing the killing. The movie does not explain he is doing the killing or how he is doing the killing. Also the script is poorly written and basically there is really no story at all. One foot note to add is Lionel Belmore who played Brgermeister Gustave Schoen in this movie also played The Burgomaster in the Frankenstein movie. The Vampire Bat gets a D- from me.

1663036,2,B00005U13S,"Films about vampires have been around since the silent days, fueled by the popularity of Bram Stoker's 1897 novel which itself had been inspired by a flash of vampire stories in the mid 19th century, the undercurrent of which was that European immigrants with different customs were  a  threat to England's way of life. The most famous film treatment from the silent era was German director Murnau's ""Nosferatu"" (1922) which remains, to this day, a terrifying film. Bela Lugosi's 1931 ""Dracula"" was a critical and box office success, placing #6 in the box office for 1931.

Horror films in general were hot in the early 30s. Frankenstein was #1 at the box office in 1931, and Frederic March won the Oscar for ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"" which came in at #8 in 1932. Other popular horror films were ""Doctor X"" (1932), ""The Mummy"" (1932), ""Murders in the Rue Morgue"" (1932), and ""Mystery of the Wax Museum"" (1933).

""The Vampire Bat"" was produced mainly to take advantage of this trend. It borrowed sets from ""Frankenstein"" and ""The Old Dark Horse"" and recycled Fay Wray and Lionel Atwill who had just appeared in ""Doctor X"" and were scheduled to star in ""Mystery of the Wax Museum"".

Lionel Atwill (1885-1946) was the king of the B horror films and best remembered as Inspector Krogh, the man with the wooden arm, who hunts down the monster in ""Son of Frankenstein"" (1939) while managing to get in a game of darts with Basil Rathbone.  Atwill appeared in 5 of the 8 Universal Frankenstein films, and also had time for ""Mark of the Vampire"" (1935) and ""House of Dracula"" (1945) as well as several Sherlock Holmes films, the best of which was  ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" (1939). Atwill plays a physician treating villagers for a suspected case of vampirism. Unfortunately this is one of Atwill's weakest performances ever.

Fay Wray (1907-2004), of course, is everyone's favorite damsel in peril as the movie actress s who is kidnapped by ""King Kong"" (1933). In a career that lasted nearly  60 years she appeared in more than 60 films, including ""Viva Villa"" (1934) and ""The Countess of Monte Cristo"" (1934), but nothing every equaled the power and appeal of the big gorilla. Wray plays an assistant to Atwell and love interest for Melvyn Douglas. Wray does a good job and manages to get through the entire script without a scream.

Melyvn Douglas (1901-1981) appears as a police chief. Douglas won the Oscar twice (""Hud"" and ""Being There"") and was nominated a third time (""I Never Sang for my Father"") but lost to George C. Scott for ""Patton"". He also won a Tony for ""The Best Man"" (1960) and an Emmy for ""Do Not Go Gently Into That Good Night"" (1967), making him 1 of only 5 performers to win the so-called ""triple crown"" of acting. This was Douglas' seventh film and he does a terrific job.

Dwight Frye (1899-1943) has the distinction of appearing in the classic 1931 version (as Renfield) as well as this film. He was also the hunchback from ""Frankenstein"" (1931) and appeared in more than 50 films with titles like ""Bride of Frankenstein"" (1935), ""The Crime of Dr. Crespi"" (1935), ""The Shadow"" (1937), etc. He plays a bat loving lunatic, and does it exceedingly well.
Don't expect a traditional vampire film. ""The Vampire Bat"" is more on a level with ""Cat People"" than it is with ""Dracula"".

Director Frank Strayer (1891-1964) made several early horror films including ""The Monster Walks"" (1932), ""The Ghost Walks"" (1934) and ""Condemned to Live"" (1935). In 1938 he got his break and made ""Blondie"" and stayed with the series through 1942.

Majestic Pictures was a small production company that put out a few dozen films between 1931 and 1935. They had no special focus, making westerns, crime films, and horror movies with equal zeal. Head honcho Larry Darmour (1895-1942) later merged his company into Republic and later Columbia where he specialized in westerns and the Ellery Queen series.

As a poverty row production the film has pretty good values, especially for the early 30s. In addition it has the benefit of good performances from Douglas and Frye. But real fans of the vampire films will find it disappointing, and fans of horror films in general will find it lacking the gusto of most horror films. While the film has some atmosphere, it falls short of the kinds of atmospheric effects from films like ""The Mummy"" and ""Cat People"".  In short, there are so many excellent vampire and horror films from the 30s, why would you spend your time on this one.",1302048000,,4471,4.765847347994826

Many versions are extremely scratchy & soft focus, or else actually missing bits of footage here & there. The Alpha print is the most complete out there and is of very good quality. The few other prints that may be of a slightly sharper picture (and I mean SLIGHLY), such as the recent copy included on the new, much-tauted  TRAILERS FROM HELL DVD, have many of the ""wipe"" transitions between scenes omitted for some reason...scenes just jump from one into the next in abrupt jump cuts. There are also patches of extremely dirty footage (I don't mean pornographic!) that makes some scenes unwatchable for 20-30 seconds at a time. There are also several scenes where footage is missing (such as the scene near the beginning of Karl, Ruth, & Aunt Gussie in the lab leading to Lionel Atwill tending to Martha, the old apple woman).

The Alpha print is extremely clean, generally free of pops, dirt, & scratches, and has all footage intact. It is very slightly softer than the TRAILERS FROM HELL print & a few others, but all those seems to be either filled with scratchy areas and/or missing footage. So, in this collector's opinion, if you are looking for the best overall print of this film, go with the Alpha.",1288310400,19,1802,4.558641975308642

The film begins at night, bats fly about in the dark sky. The night watchman walks along the street. What is on the roof? How to explain the deaths of people found drained of blood? An old history book tells of vampires. Is it only a peasant legend? The people are terrorized by fear. But not Herman! He likes bats, they are warm and fuzzy. Martha is treated by Dr. Niemann. ""That's odd."" Is Herman in league with the devil? ""Just a case of nerves."" Poor Martha! The same wounds like the others. Aunt Gussie worries about her heart. Can they believe the legends of vampires? The people will search for Herman and bring him to justice. But Herman escapes forever from their prejudice and grasp.

There we learn the secret. Who is Emil? Georgiana will no longer make good coffee. Where is Herman? He has an alibi! Is there a human madman around? Why would anyone want to sacrifice humans for their blood? What kind of experiment? Niemann's niece learns of his secret but is captured. The prosecutor has a surprise for Niemann! He didn't take those pills. For some unexplained reason Emil turns on his master and the struggle for the pistol provides justice for both men. The last scene provides a laugh to counteract the preceding horrors.

The story seems to lack some transition scenes, and is pretty good until the last ten minutes. It is set in 19th century Germany. With a better writer and story it could have served as an allegory for the actual horrors of 1930s Germany. This made the legends of vampires seem like a child's fairy tale. Imagine evils caused by the leaders of society! It does show how people were fooled by legends when they lacked knowledge of the truth.",1257552000,,1706,4.586885245901639

1663043,2,B00005U13S,"The Vampire Bat (Frank R. Strayer, 1933)

Fay Wray's name will be writ large in history as long as films exist for her part in 1933's King Kong; the same cannot be said of the other ten films in which she appeared in 1933, of which the lame, talky, and entirely unsuspenseful The Vampire Bat is one.

The story takes place in a small German village where people are dying with all the requisite symptoms of vampiric infestation; the town's burgermeister (Lionel Belmore) is convinced there's a vampire at work. The skeptical chief of police (Melvyn Douglas) dismisses this as frippery and sets out to look for a more mundane sort of murderer, at least when he's not off playing in the bushes with his lady love (Fay Wray), the assistant to the town's most prominent doctor (Lionel Atwill). Both the burgermeister and the police chief, through separate means, come to suspect the same person: Herman (Dwight Frye), a somewhat slow chap who has a penchant for the theft of apples and an appreciation for beauty in the female form that is not always appropriately masked.

Strayer and screenwriter Edward T. Lowe don't seem to have been able to decide if they wanted to make a horror picture or a comedic mystery here, and the film doesn't transfer nearly as well between states as does, say, The Old Dark House (on whose set much of this picture was filmed; those who have seen Whale's film will certainly recognize the doctor's house). It's certainly worth watching for Melvyn Douglas, who would soon go on to become one of film's most loved stars during the late thirties and the forties, and some of the jokes are on target. The mystery portion of the film, however, is trite and predictable, and the horror never really gets off the ground at all. But hey, at least it's got a cute dog. **",1209427200,2,1791,4.6257861635220126
1663044,3,B00005U13S,"I got this to watch with my son, who is at the age when he is becoming enamoured of monsters and creepy stories, in addition to sci-fi.  We both enjoyed it for the atmosphere - in a superstitious ""Bavaria"", yet with normal british dress clothes and accents.  There are a seies of mysterious deaths, marked by two puncture wounds on the necks of victims.  The villagers focus their fear and wrath on a retarded man (Dwight Frye), who seems to appear around the victims prior to their deaths and who openly loves bats as ""warm like cats.""  Needless to say, the plot takes unexpected turns and is impossible to predict!  The young Faye Wray is also a treat, just before she became a b-movie star in King Kong.  There are pretty good characters, including her intrepid cop boyfriend, who erfuses to believe the vampire theory though begins to doubt his doubt.  Then, there is the throbbing dirt-like thing - what happened to it?

Great viewing fun:  this is the kind of film I watched as a kid late at night at sleepovers.  Now I share it with my son, who avidly watches them with me.  It doesn't get better than that!",1193443200,4,1114,4.492537313432836
1663045,3,B00005U13S,"This movie begins much like other vampire movies from the 1930's.  There are the stocks in trade of similar movies:  much of the film takes place in a European village, Klineschloss, superstitious villagers run about muttering ""vampire,"" much of the film takes place at night, a whacky character that looks like he could be Dracula's sidekick slinks about, and there are men of science preaching rationality.  The only unusual feature is a more detailed than usual love story.

The most important attribute of any vampire movie is bodies without blood.  You may check that item off on your list.  We have bodies without blood; spooky!  There must be a vampire running about, right?  We see spooky bats in the trees.  Oh my, there is a vampire somewhere!

Then there is Herman Gleib, played by Dwight Frye, whose version of Renfield in 1931's ""Dracula"" remains one of the best.  Herman's character in this movie is much like Renfield, and is yet another indication of a vampire lurking about.

The most un-vampire-like part of this movie is the relationship between Karl Brettschneider (Melvyn Douglas, ""The Old Dark House,"" which provided the interiors for this film, ""Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House,"" ""Hud"" and ""Hotel"") and Ruth Bertin (Fay Wray, who also participated in another movie the same year that some movie fans may know about, ""King Kong"").  The relationship between these two gets the second most amount of screen time after the bodies and the vampire chasing.  I found the romance a little distracting and wondered whether Ruth was going to be one of the vampire's victims; you will have to watch to learn whether she was or not.

I thought the vampire was going to be Dr. Otto von Niemann (Lionel Atwill, ""Captain Blood,"" ""The Gorilla,"" and ""Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman""), or he was in league with the vampire.  Dr. von Niemann has many of the mannerisms of a vampire, but once again, you will have to discover whether he is the vampire for yourself.

I am somewhat conflicted as to how to recommend this movie.  This movie has lots of atmosphere, but little in the way of scare factor, and I thought the ending lacked teeth.  If you are an ardent vampire movie fan, then you should probably have this movie for its intriguing take on vampire legends.  If you are looking for a vampire movie in the tradition of ""Dracula"" or the Hammer films of the 50's and 60's, you should probably pass on this one.  The bottom line:  there are a few good reasons to have this movie in your collection, but almost as many reasons to not have this movie in your collection.

Good luck!",1183593600,2,2593,4.738839285714286
1663046,1,B00005U13S,"The Vampire Bat is a really lame horror flick.  How lame?  Consider its plot and ask yourself just how many times have you seen the same basic scenario.

The Vampire Bat is set in the village of Klineschloss where villagers are found dead, drained of their blood with two small holes in their necks. Naturally, everyone suspects that a vampire is at work. Of course superstitious villagers start running around with torches.

Dwight Frye has a significant role in this flick as the red herring.  This may very well be Frye's best performance of all time.  However, that is more than counterbalanced by the strikingly poor performances of horror regulars Lionel Atwill & Fay Wray not to mention Melvyn Douglas.

The Vampire Bat is a pretty lame flick that is a waste of your time and money.",1176163200,4,789,4.7153284671532845
1663047,4,B00005U13S,"The Vampire Bat (1933) is on one level a cheap way to pass the time. On another level, it's a classic in its own right, showcasing one of Dwight Frye's more intriguingly maniacal characters and a story that surpasses many for its time.

Set in a small village called Kleinschloss in Bavaria, the plot revolves around numerous murders that have been occurring. The unfortunate twist to these murders? Each victim is found blood-drained with the cliche bite marks on their neck. The superstitious town is petrified and insists that it is vampirism spreading this horror about. But investigator Karl Brettschneider (Melvyn Douglas) is skeptical. He would rather pursue the matter from a more scientific standpoint. Dr. Otto von Niemann (Lionel Atwill) is the town doctor, and is torn between the two sides, not sure what should be done. And then, of course, we have Herman Gleib (Dwight Frye). The unfortunate man who everyone's pointing their finger at. You see, the mentally handicapped Gleib has a fascination with bats. Couple that with his eccentric and at times creepy personality and the poor guy never had a chance. The townsfolk focus their fear on him -- eventually chasing down Herman, leading to his death. They drive a stake through his heart just to be sure. But wouldn't you know it, the killing continues. Faced with a mystery that threatens to go on and on if the true source of this depravity is not uncovered, the story then kicks into the next gear, ultimately winding down to its ending.

I bought The Vampire Bat DVD for really one reason: Dwight Frye. Most recognized for his portayal of Renfield in 1931's Dracula, he's been known by horror fans for his ability to bring insanity to the screen (even though in all actuality he was much more versatile in his acting ability). I was indeed impressed with his part in The Vampire Bat. Sure, his role could've been given a tiny bit more screen time, but for what it's worth, I'm left satisfied. Yet the real kicker was the surprise hit with the film in general. It's nowhere near a masterpiece, but it's definitely more than the average B flick to pop out of the 30s. I think anyone who enjoys that era of horror will certainly enjoy this.

The DVD, however, isn't anything to really write home about. The DVD edition I own (Studio: CiniVu, Production Company: Majestic Pictures Inc., DVD cover: orange movie title with Atwill's hypnotic face in gray) doesn't have very nice picture or sound, but one can only assume that because of the film's age just about every transfer will be this way. The menu is no more than the scene selection page and a ""Play Feature"" button. So I'd say when it comes to choosing which edition, just go for the cheapest. I've yet to hear of any DVD with extra features or a spectacular transfer. So, in other words, my four stars are for the film itself!",1151884800,21,2849,4.705410821643286
