6397968,5,B00K0TWVFI,"Well done, eye opening, thought provoking documentary about transgender people and the struggles they face. For viewers that aren't familiar with the concept of gender identity this does a good job explaining it, with stories from trans men and trans women of all ages and from different backgrounds.

6397989,5,B00K0TWVFI,"This was my favorite documentary so far on this issue. People who are ""normal"" do not even begin to understand what this is like or why it is important. A trans person knows that who they are is unacceptable - moreover, there is no place or concept of them in most peoples ideas of the world and how it works. Therefore, from an early age ""you do not exist"" is pounded into them. They even think that about themselves. Most people can just wake up and be open and go out into the world and feel cared for and loved for who they are. They are comfortable, they belong, They EXIST. Not trans people. Every day is a nightmare of fighting an inner self that can get you ostracized, isolated, maybe even killed. There seems to be no hope for life. That's why there is such a high suicide rate. MUCH higher than any other group. Every day is a war zone and you are behind enemy lines trying to dress up like the other side while they scrutinize you and interact with you. Your inner gender translator is working over time while beads of sweat roll down your face so you don't get the ""look"" and that distancing, that ostracism for some slip of the tongue or manner that will attract the hate and the violence... going through all that for basically fake acceptance of some faade eventually wears thin and you lose hope at the hollowness of it. All you want to do then is just be in the world, to live the life of who you are. For these people, coming out is like being born again. I loved the little girl in this -- at the end where she says ""I love you"" and runs off -- I was crying. It's a must-see documentary. EVERYONE just wants love and acceptance for who they really are. Being trans does not mean you are weak or a freak. Everyone is different in many ways -- our brains work VERY differently -- we all see the world differently -- this is just one of the ways, a big one affecting everything.",1469750400,13,1895,4.237569060773481
6397990,5,B00K0TWVFI,"This was a really great film; it sheds light into a community that is often ignored or discriminated against by mainstream America. I'd highly recommend it to everyone, even outside of LGBT community. It showcases the true human aspect rather than looking in from an outside perspective.",1469145600,,287,5.127659574468085

6397992,5,B00K0TWVFI,Hands down one of the best documentaries I've seen. Very well edited and produced.  The individuals tell their own stories; there's almost no voice-over.  Plus I thought the selection of stories was the best I've seen.  These are all  interesting and highly endearing people- and the little girl is just adorable. I think this doc will help move many people into a place of better understanding.  I'm sending it to my mom!,1468800000,,422,4.805555555555555

6397994,5,B00K0TWVFI,"This is an amazing video. The issues facing the Transgender community need to be understood so acceptance and understanding may happen.

Dr. Christine McGinn featured in the story is an exceptional and very caring person, doctor & surgeon. I choose her as my surgeon for her skill & reputation before watching this film. Having watched it post-op I am even more impressed as to the wonderful person Dr. McGinn is. I was laying in that bed! It made me cry tears of joy, being able to see the care & professionalism of not only Dr. McGinn but of the medical & nursing staff at Lower Bucks County Hospital (Pa.)

6397996,2,B00K0TWVFI,"The documentary itself was not well executed.  The director skips around a great deal from story to story, and while this typically adds suspense and intrigue, here it only takes away from each individual story.

6398014,1,B00K0TWVFI,"Just what this country of, spoiled, reality-detached, leftist social justice warriors need; a documentary that validates mental illness in the guise of ""a misunderstood and mistreated minority"" . If you gobble up this drivel, being born with a penis and thinking you are a woman doesn't make you psychologically troubled, it means everybody else is troubled for not agreeing with you. Fighting for the (suddenly very important in the scheme of world events) cause of using THE OTHER public bathroom instead of the one designated for your gender makes you a hero and those who would say ""use the one your DNA says you should use "" are now deemed intolerant and backward? These poor people need therapy and a dose of reality, not some insane surgeon carving them up.",1461974400,2,764,4.884615384615385

I'm a high school teacher with a handful of students (and former students) who identify as trans, gay, lesbian, or gender queer.  I want to learn how to support them and this movie is a way for people to introduce themselves into the T of LGBTQ in an easy to understand way.  Just listening to the parents who have been touched by this is heartbreaking.  I simply cannot imagine not loving my child anymore because she came out as any of the LGBTQ letters.
I promise Pam would be welcome in my family.",1461715200,2,741,4.37956204379562
6398016,5,B00K0TWVFI,"One of the best documentaries I've ever watched.  For anyone with a loved one or someone they care about who is transgender, this film will educate you and inform you in ways you probably didn't even know you needed.  It also happens to be deeply moving.  Nothing is sugar-coated here, but I also did not walk away with a feeling of despondency.  Rather, ""Trans"" was infused with hope.  Christine McGinn, the extraordinary surgeon who was born Christopher, the little girl Dannan, so adorable and heartwrenching in her child's honesty, Chloe -- all had different journeys, and their bravery in the face of what is still such an unaccepting world is humbling.  I only hope that fifty years from now -- because it will probably take that long -- worrying about whether someone is gender conforming seems as weird as wondering if it's okay to have a woman President.  We have come so far as a society, but we still have so far to go.  This film reminds you that transgender people are just people.  Period.",1461024000,7,1003,4.685714285714286
6398017,5,B00K0TWVFI,"I just watched the documentary: Trans, on Amazon Prime. I have to say I loved it. The only part I was so emotional about was that poor young lady, who felt there wasn't any way out, and nobody (like her parents) supported her. Even the step father would beat her, as he sad: He was acting out, and being difficult I was so emotional at the parents for not learning early enough.

I know I don't like depressing news, but this has got to stop. All it takes is for people to understand: This isn't about God making any mistakes, its about genetics. Genetics is the reason for Downs Syndrome, Canavan disease, Color blindness, and Haemochromatosis, just to name a few.

All of the religious individuals won't understand, due to being unable, or unwilling, to comprehend this or any part of biology, or even the variation of organisms.

It is far easier to hate, and even kill us, than to learn to understand us. Everyone says that God is an all loving, and unconditional loving God  as long as your heterosexual, and not a freak.

I used to have several individuals take me shopping, or to do all kinds of errands, but since coming out, all of that STOPPED!

However, that is okay. I get around just fine, and I love being alone. At least I don't have to live a lie any more!",1460419200,2,1272,4.414529914529915

6398022,5,B00K0TWVFI,A wonderful and open look at some of the many challenges and joys of being a trans person and how sometimes (and sadly only sometimes) family and friends adapt and embrace and support us. The film also shows how the suffering of those who are unable to get the help and support they need can lead to thoughts of suicide.

6398057,5,B00K0TWVFI,"Rarely do I sit thru the credits of a movie.  But I was just dumbfounded at the end of this movie.  About an hour after watching it, I reflected on a little boy who lived down the street from me when I was growing up.  As a girl, I was always obsessed with my looks.  Growing up, I befriended this little boy down street who was much younger than I.  He was adorable, and altho' were at least 5 years apart in age, we just hit off as friends.  Very shortly, I realized why I liked him.  He was very ""pretty"".  He was prettier than I was, so I ""adopted"" him as my little brother.  I always used to tell people ""this is my little brother"", and he'd tell people, I was his ""big sister"".  We were always happy to see each other and became good friends.
This went on for about 2 years and then suddenly, he disappeared.  Years later, I was out somewhere, and I heard someone calling me.
The person was shouting out my name repeatedly from a distance.  I turned around and waited for the woman to come up to me.  It was my ""little brother"".  By this time, we were both adults.  I almost didn't recognize him.  I remember thinking, ""OMG!  he turned queer!""  Back in those days, guys like him were called transvestites.
After watching this movie, it hit me --- he was a girl.  He was a girl, trapped in a boy's body.
Honestly, I had no clue people were really BORN this way.  This movie really woke me up.",1440028800,3,1397,4.1610486891385765

I wish it would have included ""everyday"" people who live ""normal"" lives and have no desire to fully transition surgically to the opposite gender, but enjoy dressing and living in the opposite mode.

Women, of course, have been allowed to openly cross-dress for a few decades, now, but men are still persecuted openly for even wearing nail polish. I think the more documentaries as this, as well as the general exposure of the ""trans"" world via reality shows, sit-coms, movies, and other TV and theatrical media, the more the general public will become aware, come to an understanding, and learn to accept--not just tolerate.

If I was a therapist running group therapy sessions....or a recovering alcoholic or......If I was a person taking care of my mentally demented father or husband, if I would feel offended?  Oh well,nothing is really off the table for poking fun at it!  The acting is well done, the scenes shift quickly....will I watch more of it when it returns?  Probably.  Hmmmm.....why is that? Because it does have that soap opera addiction feeling to it!  Five stars? No, I think that I would at best say 4.  I am not sure that I ever laughed out loud, I have a dear friend who is transgender, the road to completion for her has not been easy, and still is painful with those who reject her now at work.

6398122,3,B00K0TWVFI,"While I feel this documentary is a good introduction for people who are just learning about transgender people and the issues transgender people face, there are still some problematic elements. I was hoping for a documentary that didn't have so much focus on surgery and violence that transgender people face without discussing the other intersecting oppressions that transgender people face on a daily basis that contribute to this violence such as discrimination in housing, employment, and healthcare access. Additionally, not all trans people ""knew from an early age"" about their trans identity. Some do, some don't and having more of a variety of stories would have been beneficial for this documentary. There is no representation of people of color in the documentary, another opportunity that the filmmakers missed. Finally, I think its problematic when transgender people are discussed as a ""before and after"" meaning the way trans people are often discussed are as though they are two different people from before beginning to transition which is simply not the case.",1424390400,26,1076,5.3352941176470585

There is a lot to learn from Trans; I can say that I personally have a better understanding in regard to the trans population, and will embrace them (along with every human being) fully in the future. Thank you to everyone who took part in this project, it is invaluable.  :)",1413158400,,441,5.027397260273973

6398161,4,B00K0TWVFI,"Very interesting!! Although the subject matter may not be for everyone out there, I encourage anyone interested in this subject to view this movie.

6398166,4,B00K0TWVFI,interesting subject matter that people are just people and some people are not comfortable in their own bodies and skins even as far back as kindergarten. Could God be trying to teach all of us not to judge and just be kind to all even if we have lack of understanding or find fault with the world that was created by God and his power. Does not God hold all of us and the creation in his care and hands? people should see this video and know the truth of the matter that God made the entire creation a diverse place to allow us all to learn and to know what we do not know and never imagined to exist or to be the way it is.,1408752000,,625,3.9291338582677167

6398168,5,B00K0TWVFI,So very insightful and awesome details.  So sad that the one young girl had to go to such an extreme as a way out.  Would love to hear updates about those documented in the movie.,1407715200,,179,4.085714285714285

6398170,4,B00K0TWVFI,"A fascinating documentary featuring transgender adults and children who were born inside the wrong bodies and took the courageous step of surgery to start a new life as their true self.  This interesting and emotional story is centered around Dr Christine McGinn, herself a transgender and now dedicated to her patients as a top transgender surgeon. This is a well put together movie that is both compassionate and educational.",1406764800,,427,5.188405797101449

6398173,5,B00K0TWVFI,"A very educating and moving documentary about our transgender community.  It effectively demonstrates that being transgender is a state of self identification, awareness and being, and not sexual orientation or preference.  Whether you are transgender yourself,  a parent, sibling, spouse, partner or friend of a trans person, or an individual such as myself who was fortunate enough to be born confident & secure in my identity, this film is a must see.  Education and awareness are the first vital steps to understanding and acceptance of anyone or anything perceived as ""different"" by society.  The makers of Trans have done an excellent job shedding light on the plight of those individuals who need their fellow human beings compassion and support, and not their censure, cruelty and hate.",1406419200,4,794,5.26984126984127

6398175,4,B00K0TWVFI,"Without being aware of it, many people have friends, family, coworkers, who are trans. I was married for 10 years when my spouse came out. Although divorced at her choice, I still support her and care about her. As in my case, you may not know your neighbor or friend is dealing with these issues. So watch this documentary now. Educate yourself as to what it means, the pain suffered by those you care about, the fear they must overcome in order to live honestly. Too many of us condemn without knowledge or understanding. This film answers questions you have not yet asked, shows how parents struggle to accept their children and how many cut them out of their lives, along with the joy found by those who do succeed in self actualization and the fear and obstacles that result in suicide.

As a documentary it is well balanced with interviews, people's stories, and factual information, with even the negative aspects presented in a manner that is not self pitying.",1405382400,19,968,4.694117647058824

6398177,5,B00K0TWVFI,"This should be shown in schools and it may just save a life or two.  Being a teen is hard enough, I can't imagine what a Transgender teen must feel like.  This film was fantastic.  It approached the subject with honesty and integrity.  I applaud all the people in this film and the courageous steps they took to try to live a meaningful life.  My heart broke for the family that lost their child and also for Pam who lost her family due to not understanding what she was going through inside.  Maybe after watching this film they will reach out and try to build a relationship with her.",1404259200,,586,4.330275229357798

6398179,5,B00K0TWVFI,"I've watched this twice now, and I think it is the best thing I've seen on the experience of being transgender. For one thing, it attempts to cover the entire scope of the experience -- trans children and adolescents, MtF, FtM, transitioning later in life, surgery, and the tragedies of suicide and the violence that has all-to-often been directed at this community. I think Dr. McGinn's story is really quite fascinating, and I am glad that her partner and she participated in this documentary. I would recommend this to anyone who is curious about what transgender truly means.",1403740800,7,579,4.918367346938775

The movie is well made, succinct, upbeat and informative. If you are transgender or share your life with a transgender person...this documentary is a must see!",1521936000,,387,4.953846153846154
8654992,5,B00K0TWVFI,"this was next in the queue after season 4 of Transparent, so I watched it and was blown away. Hard to believe it was filmed in 2012, as it's timely, sensitive, and most of all, honest. A great resource for cis people who want to understand what our trans brothers and sisters go through, and how we can support them in living authenticly.",1521417600,,338,4.380952380952381

8654994,5,B00K0TWVFI,"A well done and quite poignant film. Trans folks have a rough go of it. 41% of Trans-identified people attempt or successfully commit suicide in the USA. Children are identifying as Trans a lot more these days. That is shown in this film, with a wonderful 8-year-old girl who was born a boy. Acceptance of Trans. people is difficult for many people. Many folks have not known a Trans. person or think they have not met a Trans. person. They might be surprised at whom they have actually met. This film and Amazon's original 'dramedy,' Transparent need to be seen. Not only by LGBTQ folks but by ALL humans.",1506038400,,606,4.568807339449541
