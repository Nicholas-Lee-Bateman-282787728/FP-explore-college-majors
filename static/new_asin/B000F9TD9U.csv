8119420,5,B000F9TD9U,I bought this for my daughter after taking her to see them live for her first concert. we went both nights and it was great. She loves this book and MCR.,1392163200,,153,3.967741935483871
8119421,5,B000F9TD9U,"I bought this DVD as I am a massive fan of My Chemical Romance. Like some of the other reviews here I was initially dissappointed that there was not alot of footage of the actual band. But what it lacks in that respect it makes up for with a deep insight into the band from their inception to the megastars they have become. Through this I found out things about the band which magazines and other interviews with the band themselves had never touched on before, making this an unexpected treat. If you want to oogle at the band and hear things you have already been told, don't bother, but if you want to know that bit more then this is definately for you. I really liked it.",1289174400,3,676,4.2890625
8119422,1,B000F9TD9U,"All these random ""Unauthorized"" biographies are NOT WORTH IT!!!! No MCR songs, no real interviews, nothing good

YOU CAN FIND THINGS THAT MAKE YOU GO MMM IN ITS ENTIRETY ON YOUTUBE

They only interview people from Eyeball, so it's basically an hour long rant about Bullets and hor Gerard had a toothache

NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!!!",1231027200,3,328,4.821428571428571
8119423,2,B000F9TD9U,"Bought this video for my daughter.  She said it was okay, but she would have liked to see more of the band in the video.  This was why I got it for her.",1200614400,,152,3.5757575757575757
8119424,1,B000F9TD9U,"I expected interviews with the band and concert footage, kind of like Pink Floyd's ""Classic Albums: Making Of Dark Side Of The Moon"" DVD. Instead, this just has interviews with critics, fans, and people who call themselves ""experts"" on MCR. If something says ""Unauthorized"" then do not buy it.

Hopefully, THE BLACK PARADE album will be better.",1161734400,17,344,5.035087719298246
8119425,1,B000F9TD9U,"The ""film makers"" of this piece of garbage misrepresented themselves as a film crew for the BBC. Everyone interviewed in it were lied to and edited in a way that would make situations appear different than they were. Eyeball Records did not knowingly agree to be involved in this dvd. This is typical British tabloid junk. Save your money.",1152835200,37,339,4.762711864406779
8119426,1,B000F9TD9U,I love MCR as well and I am just dying for something new from them and purchased this item. I thought it would have other interviews that did not make it on Life On the Murder Scene but all it had were interviews by people from Eyeball and radio disc jockeys. Yes the same pictures of the band were shown over and over while these people discussed there over exaggerated experiences with the band.,1152230400,42,397,4.378378378378378
8119427,1,B000F9TD9U,"This is completely UNAUTHORIZED by the band, meaning there are no interviews with the band, and no music by the band on the DVD.  Features the same 5 band photos over and over, no live clips, and interviews are okay, none with the band.  If you really want a biography on MCR, get ""Life on the Murder Scene"".  A little more expensive, but has 2 DVD's and a live CD, tons of music by MCR, and interviews with MCR.  This DVD has audio a couple of recordings of the video interviews on ""Life on the Murder Scene"".  Trivia was okay.  I would not have bought if I would have known how bad it was.",1152057600,42,591,4.140350877192983
8119428,4,B000F9TD9U,"i love mcr. they're my favorite band. but what i can't understand is why people who obviously don't like them are looking at their merchendise in the first place...i just don't get it.

if you don't like mcr, just stop wasting time and writing reviews about it.",1150502400,16,261,4.553191489361702
8119429,1,B000F9TD9U,"Yeah, Sure!  This DVD should be called,""My Chemical Romance: Things That Make You Go YYuck!""",1149120000,10,92,5.133333333333334
