4294217,3,B0049TC8C6,"The series was good but not one I would add to my collection which now contains such great series as Cowboy Bebop, Elfen Lied, Twelve Kingdoms, Full Metal Alchemist, etc.

It started off great and the style and action sequences are on par with many great series out there. But there were just way too many filler episodes and inaccurate historical details.

I was disappointed that not more detail was given about some of the more interesting characters like the amazing swordswoman and Mugen's love interest. The ending also left much to be desired. It seemed rush and alot of characters were introduced in a short amount of time... All in all, I would recommend watching it if you can borrow it from someone but it's not a series to watch again and again.",1167523200,4,757,4.641791044776119
4294218,5,B0049TC8C6,I LOVE THIS SHOW. BUY IT WITHOUT HESITATION. THE ANIMATION AND MUSIC ARE TOP NOTCH. THE DIALOGUE AND ACTION SCENES ARE THE BEST. ALL BEAUTIFULLY AND MASTERFULLY PRESENTED IN WIDE SCREEN 16:9 AND DOLBY DIGITAL 5.1 SURROUND SOUND.,1162684800,2,228,5.026315789473684
4294219,5,B0049TC8C6,"Mugen is a cocky, rebellious, bandy-legged fighter who incorporates break-dancing techniques into his unorthodox fighting style. Jin is more your typically calm and stoic samurai (or ronin, to be more precise), steeped in martial tradition, who finds satisfaction in the perfect execution of his warrior craft. Mugen and Jin aren't friends - in fact, they are contentious and want to test their skills against each other - yet they find themselves joining forces, thanks to Fuu, an insistent and kinda quirky waitress who inveigles the two into helping her search for the Samurai Who Smells Like Sunflowers. For 26 episodes, the discordant trio undergo many adventures, some serious, some hilarious, some just plain out weird. The only constants are the bickerings amongst the three, the scrounging for food, and the intrusion of modern day sensibilities. Oh, and the rampant butt kicking as done by Mugen and Jin.

On the heels of his popular Cowboy Bebop anime series, Shinichiro Watanabe decided to put a new spin on the samurai anime with his irreverent, hip Samurai Shamploo. Shamploo means ""stir fry"" or a mix, and this is certainly what this series is about, as it fuses the traditional samurai credo and decorum with the unexpected modern day incursions of hip hop attitudes, beatboxing, street tagging, and baseball. The episodes are supported by cool Japanese hip hop music soundtracks and blazing hip hop scratches for scene segues. Watanabe also makes beautiful use of visual metaphors, thereby adding more depth to the shenanigans. The ripping animation and dynamically constructed fight scenes are guaranteed not to disappoint.

Kudos, too, to the voice actors, especially Steven Jay Blum (aka Daniel Andrews, who also voiced Cowboy Bebop's Spike) as the bestial Mugen. Kirk Thornton as Jin and Kari Wahlgren as Fuu are both excellent. The voice actor for the sometimes series narrator Policeman Sakami Manzou (""the Saw"") is also very good.

These episodes are definitely rated PG-13. This anime series doesn't hesitate to throw in scenes of drug use and graphic violence. Some episodes even contain mild sexual scenes.

My favorite episodes are ""The Art of Altercation"" (for the spoken word samurai and his beatbox backup), the atmospheric ""Cosmic Collisions"" (where the trio fight the undead), the hilarious ""Baseball Blues"" (where the American pitcher couldn't find the strike zone with the dog at bat, and he ends up inadvertently hitting the mutt - not to worry, no animated dogs were hurt in the making of this anime), and the concluding 3-episode arc ""Evanescent Encounter"" (where Mugen and Jin are challenged to their very limits, resolve their rivalry, and Fuu at last catches up to the Sunflower Samurai).

Here are the 26 episodes (alliterative American titles first, with the original Japanese titles in parenthesis):

""Tempestuous Temperaments"" (""Storm and Stress"") Episode 1

4294220,4,B0049TC8C6,"As a huge fan of Cowboy Bebop, I was excited when this series came out.  However, I did not expect there to be so many parallels between the two!  Mr. Watanabe seems to like having 2 male characters who reluctantly interact with / protect a strong-spirited female character.  Nonetheless, the stories are interesting and funny, and the animation is phenomenal.  I give it four stars because the music could have been better, and they were just capitalizing on the plot of Bebop by moving it back in time; seems intellectually lazy to me.",1154822400,2,537,4.741935483870968
4294221,3,B0049TC8C6,"Rating is actually a 3.5, but not enough for me to round it up.

I bought the 3 disc box set instead of this 7 disc boxset. The main difference is that I didn't buy it from Amazon, so I paid about $100 less. :P While it is an interesting anime, it isn't worth Amazon's listed price for the whole series. Especially since there are so many other places to buy a legit version for a lot less.

I actually bought it on a whim, simply because it had Samurai in the name. I figured that if it was about samurai that I'd have to love it. Well, it took me a little bit to get used to the original twists that make this anime what it is. Drama, action, a pinch of ""sci fi"" in a filler episode, a pinch of romance, and a whole lot of comedy (even if some of it is cliche).

I won't spoil any of the episodes or the ending (which was a bit of a disappointment to me), but Mugen, Jin, and Foo are remarkably well designed characters. As much as the guys may hate each other and try to kill each other, they make an amazing team. They go through quite a bit on their journey together. Maybe a bit too much because there are some really far out there episodes that seemed like nothing more than fillers, which such a short anime shouldn't really have. That aside, I came to feel like I knew them (even little Momo to an extent!), which doesn't happen to me all the time.

The best, and worst, thing about this anime series in my opinion is the fresh hip hop theme and the extremes the show would take. Maybe I'm just a samurai anime snob and perfer the more ""serious"" and less ""modernized"" animes like Peacemaker, Saiyuki, Samurai Deeper Kyo, and Rorouni Kenshin. Either way, Samurai Champloo is definately something you have to experience for yourself. No matter how many reviews you read, it won't be anywhere near like actually watching the anime.

Unless you absolutely hate everything about Samurai Champloo, watch it until the very end. At the very least, you will get to see some great fight scenes (that one friend of mine said reminded him of a wilder, more primal Jackie Chan style, but still realistic moves) and an anime like no other!

Side note as a parent: this anime does have a few episodes that contain slightly sexual content and drug referrences. Just because it is an animated show doesn't mean it's aimed at children. As always, monitor what your children watch, and be ready to answer any questions they may have (like why the monks' burning plants might cause people to act that way).",1154649600,7,2495,4.366379310344827
4294222,5,B0049TC8C6,I love watching Samurai Champloo it's a beautifully done anime. The artwork is in it's own leage. The story (although a little weird) is great. The fighting what can I say is fantastic. This series is just dripped with style the whole series oozes of cool. Jin gives Mugen a run for his money when it comes to fighting cause. Mugen just don't thing straight he's a hot head. He doesn't even know how to read. Jin is more wise and intelligent.,1150416000,,442,4.402439024390244
4294223,5,B0049TC8C6,"I'm sure that this anime show is topnotch. I'm sure it kicks ass. However, why in god's name are they selling it for almost $150? Because you are willing to pay for it. Do the sell Harvey Birdman or Venture Bros for this much? No, because nobody is stupid enough to pay for it. While it is a good show, I would reccomend refraining from buying it until they cut the price down (simmilar to Neon Genesis, cowoby Bebop, Trigun, and every other 7 year old, 24 episode anime they want to sell to you for $100).

With all due respects, the Simpsons is also animated abroad. Their boxsets contain just as many episodes as these animes. Yet they can sell their stuff for $70 cheaper. Save your money and just tape, dvd tape, or tivo this stuff if you want it so much. Most of these anime series are lacking in extras, or the extras are in Japanese.",1148860800,15,841,4.289308176100629
4294224,5,B0049TC8C6,"I was skeptical about this series when a friend handed it off to me. I thought, ""Oh goody, another wandering samurai series. That's never been done before."" I was dead wrong. Because while the genre is packed, this is something totally different. It wanders between being very historically accurate, relying on folktales and legends, and being just totally off the wall.

The main characters are not heroes at all in a traditional sense, but they're almost more endearing for it. You grow to like them because as terribly flawed as they are, they're true to themselves and their own sense of what is right in the world.

All in all, this series made me laugh, gave me the creeps, made me cry, and really inspired my own creative endeavors. By far one of the best shows I've ever seen.",1147996800,6,784,4.633093525179856
4294225,5,B0049TC8C6,"I LOVE THIS SERIES. You want action? Got it! You want laugh-out-loud comedy? Got it! You want some saucy mild adult situations? Got it! You want insane storylines? Got it! You want some bad-azz fighting scenes? Got it! You want a killer soundtrack? GOT IT!

I love the fact that they use a hiphop soundtrack during the show.

Mugen and Jin easily became two of my favorite anime characters of all time; they don't get along at all. in fact, they can't wait to get the chance to kill each other (coming dangerously close MANY times). The only thing keeping this whacky team together is helping Foo find her 'Samurai who smells of sunflowers'.

I'm waiting for this boxed set to come out so I can finally stop watching bootlegged versions. The only other anime (besides Cowboy Bebop) that made me laugh this much is 'Golden Boy'.

As many reviewers' here have mentioned the hip hop music that runs all through it and just let me say I'm not a fan either , happens to work really well . The animation is brilliant , vivid  bold colours when necessary and beautiful shades of pastels when called for when experiencing a sunset for example . The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because there was no supernatural element except for that one episode near the end . I'm a huge fan of 'Ninja Scroll' the movie and the series . I especially liked the warriors he battled in that where a lot of them had incorporated black magic to enhance their abilities.
Anyway, enough of ' Ninja Scroll ' . The story here was brilliant ,loved it . I liked the characters as well . The two male leads were polar opposites but seemed to balance each other out and the female lead Fuu , what a cute , strong , likeable girl . I was quite surprised to find out how old she was when that was revealed part way through . You have to love a quest type film though and when they come to the end and eventually find the Samurai who smells of sunflowers there a few surprises in store and by this time you are wondering whether she will stay with Mugen , the criminal with exceptional skills  or Jin , the master swordsman dealing with a shameful past .

4294317,4,B0049TC8C6,"I originally saw this series on Adult Swim. I like the series a lot. It goes back to a feudal Japan. There are some historical explanations about the time period that help the viewer to understand why things are the way they are. The rivalry between the main characters is fairly humorous as well. The story seems a bit slow due to the trials and tribulations the group goes through trying to survive on their journey. It's not like every episode actually progresses the main story. Some of the events are there for humor while others seem to be there to give a feel for the time period. While they do not move the main story forward, the episodes are entertaining enough not to make them a hinderance to the series.",1472515200,,716,4.473282442748092

In 26 episodes this series manages to hit every note. Amazing character development, beautiful artwork, and many great lessons about the journey in life we take and the people on those paths. The music compliments the incredible visuals. Artists like nujabes, fat Jon, and tshuchi flow perfectly as if the music itself is a character in the show. Do yourself a favor and watch this amazing anime. It is truly underated gem.

This show, unlike others where 20 minutes of talking is done and 5 minutes or less of fighting is done, actually includes action. It is also funny as well (and who does not love comedy?).

 The characters are easily likable, even though I feel their back-stories' could have had a bit more focus. But all three of them have distinct personalities and I thoroughly enjoyed them all.

Awesome fight scenes, particularly with Mugen. Beautiful art in my opinion, really vibrant colors. Some parts are literally laugh out loud funny.

I can honestly say that once you get past the initial wierdness of it all (for me that was maybe 2 or 3 minutes in) the show really does start to stand on its own. It has three very compelling characters on a journey looking for the ""Samurai that smells of sunflowers"" This Show has got a little bit of everything in it Drama, romance, action, and definitely a heavy dose of comedy.

4294459,5,B0049TC8C6,"A note: This release is technically an ""upscale"" of the original master, which was done in standard definition. Due to the nature of the original compositing and mastering process, it's unlikely that this series will ever be in native HD. Essentially, the parts that made the master were digitized into SD originally, so the original master copy is only SD. So, unlike many films, there isn't an analog (or high-res digital) master copy they can go back to and simply rescan at higher resolution. (It's theoretically possible to redo it in HD if they rescanned the original art, redid the effects in HD, and then composited it all again onto an HD master... but that's a ton of work, basically producing the show over again. It was done for Cowboy Bebop though, but this series is not nearly as likely to get such treatment, since it's expensive to do.)

Awesome series, and this upscale transfer is likely as good as it's going to get. A great quality upscale though, as good as I've ever seen anyway. This Blu Ray version is still better than the DVD, even if you have a player that will upscale DVDs (since this is an upscale of the original master and not of DVD compressed video). Audio quality is great too, no complaints there. A great deal at the price it is, for one of the most original and great anime series made thus far.",1412380800,21,1334,4.558333333333334

4294468,5,B0049TC8C6,"Samurai chopping and one hell of an awesome adventure if you watch this show! Please enjoy my review for Samurai Champloo

Plot and Characters: (minor spoilers only) Our story begins in the early 1800's in Japan. A girl named Fuu who works in a tea shop. One day a samurai named Mugen (pronounced Moo-gen) wants some food but is broke. Mugen tell's Fuu he will get rid of the trouble makers in the shop in exchange for food. She says she can handle it and he just lays back. After some trouble she calls out to him and agrees. With in seconds he takes out the trouble makers. The lead trouble maker is the magistrate's son who says very power samurai will come and rescue him. Walks in is Jin (Pronounced Jean like the pants/trousers) who sees Mugen waiting for the power samurai to come. Mugen being head strong and wanting to fight, starts fighting with Jin, soon after the tea shop gets set on fire and some how Mugen and Jin get arrested and sentenced to die. Fuu comes into their cell and tells them she will free them both if they help her. As they agree shes gets them out. With some trouble and more fighting they all escape the town. Fuu tells them not to forget their promise and she tells them they must help her find a samurai who smells like sunflowers. From there the awesome adventure begins!

Pros: The voice acting is amazing. The story is 1st rate. When people get cut or stabbed there is some blood. Some swearing in this show but not too much. With every episode it feels like a whole different adventure except for the episode that have a part 1 or 2 with them.  The sword fights are super amazing, it feels like an art style it self just watching how Mugen and Jin fight. This is 100% UNCUT and UNCENSORED so you won't miss any of the action or anything they show you!

Physicall Discs: The standard dvds come with 7 disks with all 26 episodes. Or if you try the blu ray the come with 3 disks with all 26 episodes.

Music: the music in here is really. It is heavly hip hop influenced. Sometimes in the story you can see other characters rapping and dancing like hip hop stars.

Cons: Credits only show the japanese voice actors and never shows the english voice actors that if you watch the credits at all. The extras on the dvd's are pretty much crap. They show some trailers of other shows or just Samurai Champloo it self. Other than art drawings from the creator and textless songs there are no extras at all.

DVD  Verses  Blu Ray: Now personally I Bought both DVD and Blu Ray but at different times. I'll explain each down below

Blue Ray version I first got the Blu Ray over 2 years ago. When I got it, I unwrapped it. The discs looked like mini records. When I went to play the first disk it worked fine for the first two episodes but then it started glitching and freezing then crashing. I took it out and the back had nothing wrong so I used a different blu ray dvd player and the same thing happened. So after many different blu ray dvd players and systems that could play blu rays it still wouldn't play. I have read on amazon here that the Blu Ray version of this series works very very poorly if at all. Also from what I read that the blu ray version isn't as clear as HD could be, I've read the drawing lines blur together and some colours can be off. So my personal reconmendation is get the regular NON blu ray version

DVD version: I got the regular dvd version for christmas. I was aware of what happened with the blu ray so I tried it again and it worked wonderfuly! Everything was perfect. There are 7 discs in all with just 3 to 4 episodes per disc. The dvd case it self is physically bigger than the blu ray version but I think it is worth it. Buy regular standard version.

Over all: This is one hell of an amazing, greatly written story that deserve's an award! Buy this series!!!",1407888000,3,3827,4.285318559556787
4294469,5,B0049TC8C6,by far one of the best animes ive seen! used to watch it back in middle school and this is a perfect purchase for anyone feeling nostalgic and cravin a unique show. well worth the buy :],1407801600,,186,4.054054054054054
4294470,5,B0049TC8C6,"I've loved Samurai Champloo ever since I saw it on the Adult Swim block of Cartoon network several years back. I had a chance to get the complete series at Best Buy once but couldn't afford it at the time then it sold out quickly. I finally got it here on Amazon and watched the entire 26 episode series in 1 day in 1 sitting.
The main characters make for quite the unusual team. Mugen is a great swordsman but a crude, undisciplined wild child from a Japanese penal colony. Jin is a more traditionally trained, more prim & proper samurai who became a ronin (samurai w/o a master) and a wanderer after being forced to kill his master in a duel. They both want to fight each other to the death when they first meet but are captured and sentenced to death for various crimes until Fuu, a waitress who was being bullied by a group of thugs until she was saved by Mugen & Jin, saves them from execution on the condition they help her find her estranged father (the samurai who smells of sunflowers). They travel feudal Japan together while fighting off various enemies and getting on each other's nerves but eventually come away as close friends after surviving numerous trials & tribulations. My only complaint is that series is kind of Mugen-centric and Jin kind of gets the short end of face time in various episodes. But I highly recommend this series to any fan of dramatic anime.",1407456000,,1381,4.484126984126984

This is like Cowboy Bebop (same director) in the sense of abstract storytelling to give you a feel for the characters by watching individual skits of their lives or important interactions. A very creative way of storytelling, and a very effective way to fall in love with the characters and the plot and show in general.

The Blu-ray has beautiful sound. There is no digital banding, and the animation quality wasn't really affected at all (read other commenters' opinions on art details).

Skimpy for the caliber of this anime, but oh so worth it. No inserts or anything, just a simple BD case with the discs. Worth it al the way.",1392768000,2,816,4.856115107913669

4294517,5,B0049TC8C6,"I remember seeing this air when I was a kid and I didn't pay no mind to it cause at the time I was only watching  cartoons on the original cartoon network, at the time the only anime I ever watched was DB and DBZ and I didn't discover Naruto and broader anime until I was a teen, but that's another story...

As of last month I was recommended by my cousin to check this series out as he and I are anime fans and he highly recommended it.  So I looked at the name and I'm thinking wow this came on when I was a kid, and now that I've watched the series I can't believe I never watched it until this year.

You have Ryuugen, a off the wall samurai swordsman who can't take s*** from nobody.  He will take any challenge he can find and won't quit until he wins.  You have Jin, a old school Samurai who is quiet and reserved; but when it is a duel he will slice you up in a second.  Then you have Fuu the girl who has both Jin and Ryuugen around her finger taking them on a quest to find a samurai that smells of sunflowers.
From the first episode I didn't know what to expect, after the second episode I was hooked.  The whole concept of the adventure was to search for the sunflower samurai, yet you find yourself wanting to know the history of the trio and why they are the way they are in the present.  I couldn't help but fall in love with each of their convictions and how they held their prides up high.  I was laughing, then I almost cried at the end.  I was on the edge of my seat at the sword fighting, and the love scenes were priceless for Ryuugen.
The main thing about Samurai Champloo is not the storyline of the anime, but the journey.  And I believe that is what really kept me in love with this show, the whole idea of an adventure with people you just met.  Trying to accomplish your goals all the while ending up in new places and meeting new people.  The adventure is what I would love to do myself if possible, and also it shows you to follow your dreams and aspirations.  It will make you have a ""feel good"" warmth inside of you during the journey of the trio.
I loved this anime and it is now in my collection of anime to watch later on when I haven't seen it in a long while.
The ending to the series was OK.  I wish it ended the way I wanted to but in all it ended just fine and to the point with a point of surprise.",1384905600,,2339,3.97644539614561
4294518,5,B0049TC8C6,"I really enjoy the edginess of the story and animation the most. It's obviously for older audiences, so there isn't anything flowery or cute going on. However, that doesn't mean there isn't any humor or anything like that. I love the series, the story line is great, the characters are just awesome, and it's all beautifully done. I don't really like going on too much about the story, since I find that leads to spoilers, but in a nutshell: two very different samurai agree to (at least try not to) kill each other in an epic fight until they help a young woman locate some one for her. What ensues is a variety of plots, twists, crazy adventures, plenty of action, and most definitely humor.",1384819200,,693,4.552

I would have liked to seen an OVA though were Mugen and glasses get back together for a short trip or something taking place a few years later, that would be cool. Doubtful it will happen though. If you liked Coboy bebop it has a lot of the same voice actors, so think of cowboy bebop only they are traveling through japan not space and its samurai not cowboys, plus there is some hiphop yeah!",1377907200,,583,4.261261261261262

The two samurai, Mugen and Jin, are total opposites-and have sworn to kill each other-until Fuu convinces them to put their differences aside during the quest. But as they travel, the danger, and sometime hilarity, ensue.

The art in this anime is really beautiful. The stories combine action, drama, and humor effectively. The characters are flawed but likable. Fuu, who seems very ditzy, is actually pretty smart, and she refuses to give up. Mugen, who acts brash and likes to kill his opponent first and ask questions later, is actually very noble. Jin, who acts very detached, is actually quite caring of his companions.

4294545,4,B0049TC8C6,"Cowboy Bebop is my favours anime series so I did not hesitate to check out Samurai Champloo, which is also directed by Shinichiro Watanabe. The basic structure and archetypes are similar to Cowboy - a mismatched group of characters from a different time on a journey together while dealing with their individual pasts - but the style is fresh and different. Also like Cowboy, the music plays a central role in the show and adds to the flavour immensely.

The story doesn't necessarily have the dramatic weight that Cowboy did, but it's still a lot of fun, particularly how it touches on Japanese history and cultural artifacts. The action is thrilling, and you become invested in the characters, happy to journey along with them. I recommend Samurai Champloo to anyone who likes Cowboy Bebop or anime in general.",1369699200,,812,4.884057971014493

The animation itself is wonderful.  Some of the scenery is so beautiful I wish I could frame it and hang it on the wall.  The characters are fascinating and complex, and the same could be said of the storyline itself.  Episodes range all the way from grim and violent, to hilariously funny.  There is a disclaimer at the beginning warning that the series is not intended to be historically accurate, and indeed, much of what is so clever about it is the way the creators have mixed modern culture with that of old Japan.
I thoroughly enjoyed journeying with Mugan, Jin, and Fuu in search of the ""Samurai who smells of sunflowers"". I highly recommend it.",1342310400,,913,4.4431137724550895

I'm a low level anime fan; I love it, but I definitely can't keep up with all the anime, and all the Hollywood live action, along with the independent films out there. Note to self: find review services that I can agree with and that cover all three areas *sigh*

I caught this while I was in college, and I was up nights, watching Cartoon Network. I was hooked...HOOKED! I'm really not into Dragonball Z, or Naruto...I saw older classics like Ninja Scroll, and Ghost in the Shell...Perfect Blue. This is some really awesome work. Great artwork, well told story, great soundtrack, it's fun, creative. If you even like anime just a little bit, please check this out!

4294593,5,B0049TC8C6,"I feel like this show is one of the most underrated animes out there, and I'm not sure why.  It has a great balance of story, character development, blood/violence, and a bit of humor thrown in here and there.  This isn't a review of the show though, so I'll get to talking about the box set.

Since you can watch almost any anime online for free this is a pretty stupid purchase if you've never seen the show before.  However, if you're a fan of the series and want to have a physical copy of it, then obviously this would be a good purchase for you (because some of us out there still prefer to be able to hold something in our hands and not just stream/download it).  There's not much else to say than that.  It's got all 26 episodes, and that's pretty much all that most people are looking for in this purchase (at least that's all I was looking for).

I only have two complaints:
1. it's a 7-disc set, which is kind of weird, and the packaging isn't all that spectacular (I bought this alongside the Trigun box set, and that one blew this one away for presentation)
2. there was a bit of cosmetic damage to the cardboard sleeve that surrounds the plastic case on mine.  Not enough to raise a stink over, but when something is packaged as simply as this one it'd be nice if they could at least handle it properly.  This obviously isn't the product's fault though.",1341360000,,1367,4.30859375

Very funny series and the animation is great.  Characters have depth and their own storylines.  Even the minor characters in each episode are interesting.  Subs work.  I don't remember anything standing out as poorly written.  Episodes looked as good as the dvd set, but takes up the space of one blu-ray case as opposed to the seven dvd cases.  It's anime, so the visual quality shouldn't really be that different.
Not for little kids... too much violence and some sexual references.  Don't remember there being any swearing, but it was so well written, it would have been at a minimum.",1341273600,,641,4.87037037037037
4294595,5,B0049TC8C6,"I'm not much of a hip-hop fan (I'm a hater, just hatin'), so I avoided watching Samurai Champloo despite the many recommendations for it that came my way.  The few clips I had seen of the series had annoying (for me) background music and weird art, so that was that...or so I thought.  Destiny arrived in the form of a bout of severe bronchitis that left me stranded in bed with nothing to do for a week and a half.  Since I had exhausted all other options for entertainment by that point, I reluctantly decided to go for it with Samurai Champloo, which had to beat staring at the ceiling, right?

Other fans of the series won't be all that surprised to hear that I was hooked from the very first episode I saw, notwithstanding the fact that the opening song made my eardrums bleed and still does.  I really (really) do not like hip-hop, but I LOVED the way that it is incorporated into this series.  Samurai Champloo would not be what it is without its musical and hip-hop influences, so I decided to suspend my judgments and go where it took me, which is a classic chanbara jidaigeki with all of the usual suspects - Fuu, the naive and feisty waitress with just enough street smarts to keep her alive (but not out of trouble); Jin, the ultimate traditional swordsman and warrior; Mugen, the wild-haired ronin from Ryukyu, with his exceptional natural talents and battle instincts; and the colorful side characters who float in and out of the episodes.  At the time that Samurai Champloo was made, hip-hop was a battle cry for a new Japan, while nothing is more traditionally appealing than the jidaigeki (which in itself is a vehicle to criticize government abuses and corruption).  To put the two together and tell these stories is truly inspired.

""Tabi ni deru"" or going on a journey is a classic Japanese cultural element that is central to why Samurai Champloo is structured the way that it is.  The belief that you grow exponentially as a human being through travel is so fundamental to the way that Japanese experience life that many televisions specials are based upon sending a celebrity on a ""Journey Of Discovery.""  I have actually seen a special in which a boy-band member travels to the absolute sticks in the Chinese countryside to learn how to make fried rice.  This kid is from a famous studio that takes young people from their families and raises them to be stars, usually from a ridiculously early age.  I am sure that having money, fame, and fortune is nice work if you can get it, but seeing him bloom like a flower under the caring eyes of his host family, who were as far from the glitz and glamour of his life and career as you could possibly get, was kind of...special (sorry).  I found it touching to see how he experienced the poverty and emptiness of the countryside contrasted with the warmth and kindness of the Chinese family who took him in and not only taught him about making fried rice, but a lot more about the richness and value of human connections.  Yes, he grew exponentially.  Meanwhile, I, as a member of the audience, honked in a tissue whispering ""it's...beautiful..."", and I also gained some excellent tips on making fried rice!  Win-win, my friends - food for the body and food for the soul.  That's why we have these episodes in Samurai Champloo that seem to be connected by nothing, but there is a major life lesson in every single one.  Oh, it's not heavy-handed by any means - blink, and you'll miss it.  These human elements, done with a lot of delicacy, are what make Samurai Champloo so amazing.

The music...is...incredible.  I'm ranting, but traditional singing (Ryukyu-style - somewhat like sean nos) and shamisen have its moments here, along with Nujabes and Minmi's ""Shiki no Uta"" (lyrics that brought images of Japan to life behind my eyelids, so beautiful).  The ending credits of the episodes are full of hints about Fuu, sepia-toned and nostalgic, which kept me guessing on her bizarre quest, which at first struck me in the same way as it strikes Mugen and Jin, Fuu's unwilling companions.  She's searching for the Samurai that Smells of Sunflowers - whaaaat??  I've got sunflowers in my garden, and they don't smell like anything - which is kind of the point.  Please just watch it if you've come this far - I'd have to write a book to explain the story without spouting spoilers left and right.  You'll get what Fuu is looking for.  And what Jin is looking for.  And what Mugen, who is determinedly not looking for anything, finds, despite himself.

There is so much going on in this series that I often return to watch it just one more time and go away thinking on what I saw.  Don't let the sword fights and non-stop action fool you.  Samurai Champloo is a brave piece of social commentary on persistent and deep-rooted beliefs that are part of traditional Japanese society and are often widely and uncritically accepted by people who ought to know better.  Like what?  Well, the status of women is a very big one, and so is xenophobia (Mugen is from Ryukyu, and I cannot tell you how many times that I have had people tell me in all seriousness that people from Ryukyu are not really Japanese, with the implication that they are ever so slightly inferior), and let's not forget the episode with the eating contest, and the ""why"" behind the story of the Samurai Who Smells of Sunflowers - you don't have to agree or disagree, by the way, it's just put out there for you to see and think about.

I enjoyed all of the episodes, but the ones that especially stood out for me were the two Misguided Miscreants ones, which tell of Mugen's past; the two Elegy of Entrapment ones in which our friends meet Sara, the blind shamisen player; and the last three, called Evanescent Encounter, which end the series.  Just wow.

I'm sorry I wrote a book instead of a review, and thank you for reading it!  I hope you will give Samurai Champloo a shot, and enjoy it as much as I did.",1341273600,31,5937,4.571293673276676

Although its older brother, Cowboy Bebop, is well-renowned, and certainly more revolutionary having come out five years earlier, I believe SC is far better. It has more action more consistently for you shoot-em-up types, a more compelling plot, a more likeable female lead (though not by much),  and a finale that is a little more touchy-feely for all you Philistines. It is a massively well-rounded, beautifully sculpted work that, if you like fighting, swords, 1750s-Japan, food, or just need something to kill many hours with, pick up Samurai Champloo.

As they travel across the country, they are encountering different people and finding new ways to get themselves into trouble!  Each episode has a different tone, you never know what you're going to get.  Reverently irreverent, brilliant character designs, beautiful backgrounds and settings, cool music, humor, and plenty of fighting.  And the guys in this story don't fight to defend their honor, for land, or for revenge.  They're fighting for a meal or because someone looked at them funny or they just walked into it.

they are all 100% correct!!!

no nudity, some cursing and there is a really brutal fight on every DVD with the epic battles at the very end.

The Initial D series is the best to me but the animation is nowhere near as good as samurai champloo. the only resean i like Initial D better is because its more modern as in so swords or ninja or monks, but the movies are very simialr in other very cool ways

Smaurai Champloo is also very real. no lazers or spritual powers. its characters are very ""West Friendly"" as in the music and non traditional style of one of the Ronin.

Granted the overall series was entertaining, BUT... I found the plot line meandered; too many times an episode wrapped up making no sense, e.g., Episode # 22 Cosmic Collisions; Episode #12 The Disorder Diaries was nothing more than a rehash of the first eleven episodes; Episode #23 Baseball Blues was just plain dumb. When I finished seeing all twenty-six episodes I felt cheated, somehow. I couldn't believe forty-five people gave this anime hogpodge a 5 Star rating.

Cowboy Bebop is arguably the best anime ever made, but Samurai Champloo is just as good as its sci-fi predecessor, if not better. The plot is very in-depth, drawing you into the characters. The artwork is nothing short of extraordinary. The soundtrack is a mix of traditional Japanese music, hip-hop, and jazz. What more could you ask for? At a price range under $50 why don't you stop procrastinating and just buy it already? A must-have for any fan of anime, art, music, and great storytelling.

4294623,5,B0049TC8C6,"When I first saw episodes of Samurai Champloo years ago on Adult Swim I immediately fell in love with it. I already respected the director of the series who created similar works such as Cowbow Bepop and I believe some Gundam series, I knew I had to check his latest work.

This review is mostly to examine the blu-ray edition of this series and not the series itself. To sum up the series briefly though, it really is epic! If you are already familar with the director's other works and love his edgy, upbeat style then you'll love Samurai Champloo without a doubt.

The blu-ray quality is sharp and clear. It has been a while since I last popped in SC on my blu-ray player but from what I remember it only included marginal bonus content. Other then having all the episodes collected into two discs, I can't say this is really any different from its standard DVD counterpart except for the higher resolution.

At the price it is right now you'd be a idiot not to jump in on this. I purchased the whole set for $40 back then and even then I felt it was worth every penny.

Do pick up SC on Blu-ray or else you'd be missing one of the best animes in this decade.",1322870400,3,1162,4.292237442922374

4294627,5,B0049TC8C6,"Previewing this anime before and now finally finishing the series here on Blu-ray, this series is simply phenomenal.  This amalgamation of cultures, sub-cultures, and history whipped up into one sure-fire series makes this a standard bearer for those interested in Japanese culture and animation.  Though the producers, writers, and animators, like DJs, mixed up this anime based on samurai history, Tokugawa Shogunate Japan, hip-hop music, and anachronistic symbols and styles, what you end up getting is one of the most authentic series ever.

Two samurai, Jin and Mugen, and a happenstance girl named Fuu accidentally meet and end up going on a perilous, but at times, very humorous journey to look for the elusive ""samurai who smells like sunflowers.""  The action pays tribute to old samurai films of old, but with the blinding speed and liberality of anime, the ferocity of the action gets better when Jin and Mugen have to fight off their hordes of opponents or their individual ones.  The three make a very unlikely trio of heroes, as one is boastful, loud, and gregarious in his fighting style (Mugen), the other a calm, cool, one-hit combo that takes all enemies down Jin.  Fuu plays comic foil as she gets herself into trouble every episode or has to hold the line from the two samurai from killing each other.  You really get to adapt and follow the characters well.  The episodes pit them together against common enemies, or sometimes they will take sidetracks to see where the characters themselves come from.  Its good pacing.

Finally, the mixture of hip-hop is that flashy jacket that makes this anime the star of the show.  Fat Jon, Nujabes (rest in peace), and Force of Nature collaborate to make old-skool beats that are seamless with the action and non-action scenes.  There's no disconnect with the Edo-era Japan when the hip-hop is added in.  Its like a character within itself, and its done in a way that is believable and fits each scene.  The mood of the scene corresponds well with the music.  You have smooth slow-down scenes with slow, jazzy beats, or fast, groovy styles mixed in with the rapid-fire samurai slashing.

The soundtrack is worth getting on its own for enjoyable listening.

One of the best anime series I have seen...hands down.

This is anime that deserves several viewings.  Especially fans of Japanese culture, this is a flagship anime for years to come to those who are newcomers to the genre of samurai anime.",1321228800,2,2457,4.905569007263923

4294630,5,B0049TC8C6,"We all know there are dozens of tangent-filed genres underneath the very basic ""Anime"" genre - and for the samurai class of series and/or movies, Samurai Champloo is easily in the top 10, possibly top 5.  We have the ""from the hip,"" obstinate and ornery Mugen, along with straight and narrow, clean cut and level headed Jin who are now traveling with Fu (the waitress who somehow bails THEM out of trouble) and now they're going to help her find the samurai who smells of sunflowers.  From episode to episode, the hijinks ensue, the music is great, the artwork is nearly perfect and the dub is very well done.  The rest of it is all about traveling along, finding trouble (looking for it most of the time for Mugen) and then getting back out of trouble with their swords and unprecedented fighting abilities.  Not to mention they ""owe"" each other a battle when it's all over.

I know the review couldn't be more vague but the reality is, it's because I don't want to give away anything they do - each story carries itself, and each is incredible.  I never once found myself bored - if anything I could have watched 50 more seasons as long as the studio, writers, etc could keep up the tempo.  If you haven't seen it, GET IT!

Though the show is set in feudal Japan, everything is done with a fresh, 'hip hop' style.  Animation is pretty nice, some scenes are drawn better than others.  The backgrounds tend to look very nice.  To me the blu-ray transfer is rather nice.

Both the American and Japanese voice acting is very good.  This is one of those rare anime series where I can listen to either.  As far as the story goes, it's one with laughter, sadness, and lots of action.  If you're a fan of 'hip' anime such as Cowboy Bebop, then you will probably enjoy this one.  It has a similar vibe, despite being set in feudal Japan instead of the future in space.  The ending of the series was kind of a let down, but the journey was the main reason I watched and continue to re-watch.

4294643,5,B0049TC8C6,"Mugen is a cocky, rebellious, bandy-legged fighter who incorporates break-dancing techniques into his unorthodox fighting style. Jin is more your typically calm and stoic samurai (or ronin, to be more precise), steeped in martial tradition, who finds satisfaction in the perfect execution of his warrior craft. Mugen and Jin aren't friends - in fact, they are contentious and want to test their skills against each other - yet they find themselves joining forces, thanks to Fuu, an insistent and kinda quirky waitress who inveigles the two into helping her search for the Samurai Who Smells Like Sunflowers. For 26 episodes, the discordant trio undergo many adventures, some serious, some hilarious, some just plain out weird. The only constants are the bickerings amongst the three, the scrounging for food, and the intrusion of modern day sensibilities. Oh, and the rampant butt kicking as done by Mugen and Jin.

On the heels of his popular Cowboy Bebop anime series, Shinichiro Watanabe decided to put a new spin on the samurai anime with his irreverent, hip Samurai Shamploo. Shamploo means ""stir fry"" or a mix, and this is certainly what this series is about, as it fuses the traditional samurai credo and decorum with the unexpected modern day incursions of hip hop attitudes, beatboxing, street tagging, and baseball. The episodes are supported by cool Japanese hip hop music soundtracks and blazing hip hop scratches for scene segues. Watanabe also makes beautiful use of visual metaphors, thereby adding more depth to the shenanigans. The ripping animation and dynamically constructed fight scenes are guaranteed not to disappoint.

Kudos, too, to the voice actors, especially Steven Jay Blum (aka Daniel Andrews, who also voiced Cowboy Bebop's Spike) as the bestial Mugen. Kirk Thornton as Jin and Kari Wahlgren as Fuu are both excellent. The voice actor for the sometimes series narrator Policeman Sakami Manzou (""the Saw"") is also very good.

These episodes are definitely rated PG-13. This anime series doesn't hesitate to throw in scenes of drug use and graphic violence. Some episodes even contain mild sexual scenes.

My favorite episodes are ""The Art of Altercation"" (for the spoken word samurai and his beatbox backup), the atmospheric ""Cosmic Collisions"" (where the trio fight the undead), the hilarious ""Baseball Blues"" (where the American pitcher couldn't find the strike zone with the dog at bat, and he ends up inadvertently hitting the mutt - not to worry, no animated dogs were hurt in the making of this anime), and the concluding 3-episode arc ""Evanescent Encounter"" (where Mugen and Jin are challenged to their very limits, resolve their rivalry, and Fuu at last catches up to the Sunflower Samurai).

Here are the 26 episodes (alliterative American titles first, with the original Japanese titles in parenthesis):

- ""Tempestuous Temperaments"" (""Storm and Stress"") Episode 1
- ""Redeye Reprisal"" (""Veritable Pandemonium"") Episode 2

If you have Netflix instant stream (at this time), watch it on there, then watch it on Blu-ray.  I don't think netflix gives the best HD, so it makes the Blu-ray version of Samurai Champloo look way, WAY better.  Same thing with FMA: Brotherhood.  Blu-ray is just better.  I don't think they could improve the picture any better, so if you complain about this beauty, then you have awesome eyes.  There are parts where it looks as if it could be better (no examples, watched like a month ago), but this is with pretty much all restored Blu-rays (based off my library of less than 30 films),  Please buy this if you're a fan at all, I watched them once...  I plan on watching again.

Simple case, simple Blu-rays, AWESOME show!  I'm glad it ended the way it did.. it left me heart broken to see the characters part ways, but hey.. it tugged at my heart-strings and NO anime has ever done that.  Original FMA almost did that, but not the way this series did, and Samurai Champloo is only 26 episodes.

Buy this set, tell your DVD using friends to get with the program.  This IS the set.",1315353600,,1097,4.376237623762377
4294646,5,B0049TC8C6,I watched all episodes back to back with this show. I honestly thought it looked sort of dumb but I'm willing to watch the first few episodes of anything. This caught me in the first episode. Nothing is over the top with it (compared to most other animes). Lots of fighting and lots of comedy. It has a decent ending too which a lot of animes seem to miss. Overall one of my favorite.,1314921600,3,384,4.202702702702703
4294647,5,B0049TC8C6,"Samurai Champloo is complete in so many ways. The soundtrack is exquisite, the characters get a hold of you quickly, and don't let go, and there's a great blend of humor, action, and style. Only a few episodes really feel like they stray from the main story, but they hold their own unique appeal, and it quickly gets right back on track. Animation is great. English dubbing is on par with the original vocals. If you're looking to beef up your anime collection, this is a solid buy.",1314748800,,483,4.5

I got attached to them as the story proceeded. Even though there
were things that kept us hanging or questioning, which movies/shows
tend to do that a lot, made me yearn for a movie to tie up the
loose ends. The rebellious Mugen, laid back Jin and ditzy Fuu, they make
a great team that would compliment the story. I love this series, even though
I don't expect the same reaction for every one else but I all I do know is that I would
ENCOURAGE them to try SC out.",1314230400,,593,4.076923076923077

I would say get the blu-rays instead of dvds because the blu-rays don't scratch as easily and are practically indestructable!

This collection is available at an EXCELLENT price offered on Amazon (a fabulous collection of classic must-own series for less than $30! - current cost is even less!), I have researched, and couldn't find a competitor price to beat the cost of the collection from Amazon. Delivery was prompt, efficient, and sooner than expected. The series is wonderful and speaks for itself, so I will not review the series, but the product.

The collection is encased in a protective sleeve, which protects the DVD case from damage. The DVDs are superbly packaged in this collection. Like a book, the discs are mounted in a hard plastic flip-book type case, protecting each disc, and making the the desired disc simple to locate. I recently purchased a collection of discs, and the packaging was terrible, each disc was stacked on top of each other and difficult to locate and causing potential damage to the discs. I had to create a work-around to protect the discs in the inferior style packaging.

I highly recommend this collection. The packaging is the thoughtfully and very well designed. The price on Amazon can't be beat, and the story is among the best anime series ever.",1312588800,,1284,4.8054298642533935

Samurai Champloo is fresh, but still keeps its Japan traditions, and it's one of the many classic animes! If you're a huge fan of samurais', hot guys (since I am a girl haha), humor, adventure, fighting, and a great story line, you got to check this out! Especially the voice actors in this series, they are AMAZING! :D This came to my house in perfect condition and works great! :D Definitely recommend it to any anime fan!

Side note: I watched the Japanese dialog, but from what I've heard the English dub is done very well. I also don't know about the blu-ray up-scaling they're talking about being that I didn't actually buy this version.",1311120000,,558,4.514851485148514
4294661,5,B0049TC8C6,"I'm gonna cut straight into it.

Imagine Feudal Japan with it's samurai heritage dying out where the last warriors of this era are fighting to earn a living or a meaning of existence. Two of these guys, who are complete opposites (one wild and blood thirsty; the other quiet, calm, and deep reflecting) meet up with a spunky teenage girl who is in search of the Samurai that smells of Sunflowers. She helps them out of an execution and they have little choice but to go with her to find this man, or at least she manages to outwit them into it! Then cover that up with hip hop style music and some serious to incredibly funny to wild to fast action. It does have some mild adult situations too, but nothing too graphic as it's just a part of real life of those times.

The creators managed to actually mesh all of this together into one great anime. Hidden government agendas, mysterious characters, completely unrelated side plots that actually contribute towards an engaging storyline and an ending that will leave your jaw hanging.

If you've seen Cowboy Bebop, then this should be next in line for your viewing pleasure. This will not disappoint. Look for it in Blu-Ray too.",1310947200,,1178,4.6

The last Blu-ray release of this series was poorly upscaled, but it appears Funimation has fixed the problem and re-upscaled the video for this set.  Since the show was animated in standard definition it will never look spectacular, but this new upscale is probably the best we will see.  Unlike the last set, the film grain remains intact with very few visual flaws from the upscale.  If you already have the DVDs there is no real need to upgrade, but if you are on the fence about buying either the DVD or the Blu-ray, get this Blu-ray release.",1310083200,96,640,4.539130434782609

Three main characters travel across Japan but of course get distracted with a complex web of enemies and grudges. This is were the bloody hacking and slicing fly off their swords. In addition to action, the characters' intolerance for each other and individual vices supply the series' crude comedy. Overall, this series is a lot of fun and will keep your sword drawn the entire time.",1306108800,5,599,5.0606060606060606

4294666,5,B0049TC8C6,"So the argument has been ""Dvd or Blu-ray"", upscale, and animation looking bad. Well i can say personally that i watch the series on blu-ray on a 50+ inch LCD Tv with and HDMI cable of course. And had Zero problems, looked great, the action and humor is there as always. Also as a side note if you enjoy the music from the show go and check out the artist Nujabes who has since passed away but left behind a great catalog of music.

I can only speak for myself in saying that if you think this release isn't good have no fear, but i will say that there is a re-release coming that is much cheaper. I also believe that it is the same as this release in terms of content like extras.

Only negative is the fact that the show ends, but when a show is smart enough to end it makes it that much greater, and compared to other shows that never end like Naruto, Bleach, or Gintama. This show accomplished its goal that it sets itself in the first episode.

Side Note: If you own this release or purchase it somewhere else, interesting thing you can do is flip the artwork cover sheet inside out to have different artwork which i like because of the interesting clothing and face the main characters make. I don't think they meant for this to be done but either way it is nice.",1303776000,,1268,4.209876543209877
4294667,5,B0049TC8C6,"If there ever was an anime series that will leave you saying ""that was outstanding,"" this is it.

There are so many components to this story that make it so.

The artwork is gorgeous; the backdrops themselves seem to be characters in the story.

The music, which is a mash-up of house, hip-hop, blues and jazz, adds so much depth to each episode that you may feel compelled to buy one of the series' four soundtracks just as I did.

And then, there's the story itself: two rogue warriors - one who can barely control his emotions [Mugen] and another who is nearly emotionless -- the cipher (seemingly) without a soul [Jin] -- attempt to help a befuddled teenage girl [Fu] in her quest to find the ""samurai who smells like sunflowers.""

Yes, similar stories have been told in many different formats for generations, but this version seems so fresh. During the 26 episode arc, you will find yourself caring about the main characters and trying to understand why it's so important for each of them to complete this ill-defined (and potentially hopeless) journey to find the samurai.

At the end of the series, you will already miss these wonderful characters. (Years after viewing the entire series, there are still episodes I will watch from time-to-time for that very reason.)

I'd hardly call myself knowledgeable about the genre, but my interest started stirring not too long ago.  So, after reading the recommended shows, I decided to give the Samurai Champloo a shot.  If you're a new comer to anime, I think this show is a great place to start.  The melding of different genre's like samurai lore as well as hip-hop provide a unique world and enviroment, and allow for some great fight/action sequences.  But what really surprised me was the character development and growth.  Each character seems pretty cliche when they start, the undisciplined talent, the disciplined emotionless warrior, and the girl who needs help.  However, as the show progresses, you grow to understand the characters, why they are they way they are, and see them grow into something different and unique.  Couple this with some great twists, some imaginative stories, and huge entertainment, and you get an unforgettable series.  Thanks to this show I'm going to start looking into some other anime, and see what else I can find.

The skin, hair, edges, motion, and lighting when you watch the final product doesn't change that much when you watch cartoons on HD. The colors may come up alive or bright on HD.

The dvd set has 7 discs, each with their own extra slim dvd case.  The show as seen on dvd was every bit as beautiful as I remember, and I'm not sorry I didn't spring for a possibly inferior blue-ray format.

The special features were almost missing from the release, and mostly art galleries with a very inconvenient interface (for me).  It's worth mentioning though that on the inside of each of the 7 dvd slim cases, there's an essay written by different people involved with the creation of the show, which might be interesting, but I haven't taken the time to read yet.

Champloo draws a lot on the musical aspect of the underground hip hop scene and break style dancing, just as Bebop was influenced by the jazzy blues. It brings a lot of humor into play, slapstick and tasteful, so there is plenty to offer up a laugh or two the whole series long. I also have to gush about the characters in this series, cause there is just too much good stuff going on with them not to mention it. The dynamics between Jin, Mugen and Fuu offer up some quality entertainment and touching human relationships. I love them to death.

Also, just throwing out there, Samurai Champloo is one of the few Anime series out there in which an actual GOOD English dub was made. Champloo is enjoyable to watch whether you're in the mood to listen to the talented English voice cast or flip on the subtitles and enjoy the native Japanese speakers, and that is a huge selling point in my opinion.",1280188800,,1127,4.514705882352941

I have enjoyed a majority of the ones I've seen (especially the Studio Ghibli line), but most of them haven't blown me away. I'm one of those blasphemous fiends who finds great enjoyment in anime that *real* fans of anime don't like very much. You know, stuff like ""Vexille"" (2007), ""Appleseed"" (2004), and ""Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children"" (2005) - movies that everyone likes to rip apart even though they're far more entertaining than most of the artsy fartsy stuff that finds its way onto everyones top lists. I've also disliked and even hated a number of highly acclaimed titles. You know, stuff like ""Akira"" (1987), ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"" (1995), ""Grave of the Fireflies"" (1998), and ""Princess Mononoke"" (1997) - titles that get endless reverence for reasons that I simply do not understand. For myself personally, anime is like a mine field because I really have no idea whether or not I'm gonna hit a pretentous, irritating mess.

This past weekend I had no Asian dvds to watch, which is a rarity. So I did some online research and came across a series by the name of ""Samurai Champloo"" (2004). Like every other anime series, it got really high ratings and everyone went on and on about how awesome it was - yada yada yada. I rolled my eyes. Then I noticed that it was created by the same team that brought us ""Cowboy Bebop"" (1998), an anime that I recently finished and enjoyed very much. On that fact alone I decided to take a chance. I purchased the Complete DVD collection at a local store, and ended up finishing the entire series (a 10 hour project) in one day.

Fuu, a waitress who works in a teahouse, rescues two master swordsmen, Mugen and Jin, from their execution to help her find the ""samurai who smells of sunflowers."" Along the way they meet a lot of people and get involved in various conflicts. This is one of the few anime that I've seen that exhibits superior quality in every single aspect of film-making. The animation itself is stunning, with incredibly beautiful environments on constant display, and the Japanese voiceacting is top notch. The two biggest positives, however, are the character development and the swordfights.

With regards to the former, I must give some serious props to the scriptwriter, who crafts some fantastic characters here with very distinct, engaging histories. These are expertly developed characters who come to life. As much as I enjoyed ""Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex GIG 1 & 2"" (2002, 2004), I always felt that the characters were too dry and textbook. Not so in ""Samurai Champloo"", which introduces its characters in a very warm, endearing manner while using a hefty amount of witty comedy that bonds them with the viewer as well as each other. It was also an excellent decision to have a very slow, methodical bonding process that basically takes the entire runtime before culminating in a family-esquire relationship. This makes perfect sense given their cynical histories, and comes off as entirely convincing. By the end the viewer will have no choice but to be emotionally invested in their lives, which maximizes the impact of the final 6 or 7 episodes when they confront some formidable opponents.

That brings us to the swordfighting scenes, which are without question the greatest I've ever seen in an animated film or show. The quality of the action choreography is high throughout, but the last 6 or 7 episodes will completely blow you away. We're talking multiple showdowns with bad guys who are so intimidating that one questions the well-being of the protagonists, who are considerably talented in their own right. What results is what I call ""superlative awesomeness"" that will have the viewer on the edge of their seat for virtually every single second. If you thought the swordfights in ""Ninja Scroll"" (1993) were good, you've GOT to see this! A truly magnificent, exhilarating experience.

I still have much to see in the realm of anime, but it's gonna be tough to top ""Samurai Champloo."" I'm completely and whole-heartedly in love with this the same way I'm in love with ""My Sassy Girl"" (2001, South Korea) as a romantic comedy or ""Kairo"" (2001, Japan) as a horror movie. A must see by any common definition of the term.

There are few episodes I would watch more than the one time, but the comedy is great! There was a couple of times I had to re-watch the scene for an extra chuckle.  The only character I found interesting at all was Mugen.  The other 2 almost seemed thrown in so Mugen wasn't by himself.  In short I guess this series falls short of the mark from Cowboy Bebop, but is worth the buy especially with Amazons price point.",1277251200,,573,4.317757009345795
4294697,5,B0049TC8C6,"Samurai Champloo is the best anime I have ever seen. Minimal filler--maximum action, humor, hip-hop, and plain awesomeness. If you like anime you will love this, If you're not into anime you will still like this. The hip-hop soundtrack makes it stand out along with its seamless dubbing. The show is fast paced, full of action.

The main difference between Samurai Champloo and many mainstream anime is that there is no manga base (however there is a manga adaptation). Many anime are based on manga, which means what we are getting is a translation of an adaption of the original comic. This makes anime seem ""dumbed down"" and much less desirable than the original thing. Samurai Champloo is not an adaptation of a manga, it is an original anime, which seperates it from animes like Bleach and DBZ.

BOTTOM LINE: It's good, watch it.

**If you aren't convinced, you can watch any of the episodes free on funimation.com",1275264000,,919,4.80379746835443
4294698,5,B0049TC8C6,"This is a very entertaining anime series. Laugh out loud comedy mixed with intense and well choreographed battle scenes all to a mix of hip hop music. This series is a perfect ""gateway"" into Japanese animation, great for die-hard fans who want to introduce anime to friends and family members. Most of my friends who aren't fans have issues with hard to follow plots, melodramatic characters, and the ""cartoon-y"" animation style where ""only their mouths are moving!"". Well this plot is simple and easy-to-follow (granted one episode gets pretty freaky, you'll know which one I'm talking about :D), the characters are believable (the Eng Dub voice actors are phenomenal), and the animation style is very attractive and fluid, especially during the fight scenes.

It's also a bit more adult than your typical anime series. Expect swearing, smoking, and suggestive material. Older teens and up will very much appreciate the reprieve from middle schoolers blushing and tripping over themselves when they are near a member of the opposite sex. I actually found that the more ""grown-up"" content was a bit of a surprise to people watching anime for the first time. Since it is animated, many people may have the misconception that because it is a ""cartoon"" it is only intended for children. This is a good example of how anime isn't just for kids.

As far as the length is concerned it's just long enough to start getting a little emotionally invested but not a total marathon like InuYasha or Rurouni Kenshin. I personally prefer a longer series, but this is probably the perfect length for most people who don't have months and months to invest in one story.

Overall it is a very unique and high quality series. I would recommend it to anyone looking for something different than the ""cookie cutter"" anime genres out there today.",1274227200,,1825,4.9188311688311686

What makes this blend great is that it doesn't beat you over the head with the hip-hop, the music goes with the story and the scenes. The story follows a wild, untamed vagrant named Mugen, a traditional, self-controlled samurai named Jin, and a waitress name Fuu as they try to find a samurai that smells of sunflowers. Their journey takes them to various places where they meet a variety of people and have many action-packed adventures. This is a story where the main focus is the journey, not the destination. While in most episodes they are trying to get money or Mugen and Jin are dealing with past sins the final three episodes show how the journey changed them and how each of them benefited from each other and the conclusion is very satisfying. Overall this is a great series for those who loved Cowboy Bebop as it is also directed by Shinichiro Watanabe and has his style of combining opposites into something beautiful.

Music is intact, Nujabes whom isn't with us anymore did a great deal of the soundtrack. Layered with hip hop ambient texture, wandering samurai vibe, and a touch classical with a major hint of modernism, is clever. The show produced in 2004 released dually in both Japan and the United States. Geneon released these separate singles, which I didn't get to complete because Geneon and the anime industry collapsed. 2010 finally brings these three discs, sheathed inside 3 plastic bays, housed within a cardboard box.

Screen size for optimum viewing is 32 inch LCD. Anything larger one could start to have issues with blurring, anti aliasing, and screen artifacts. Not sure about the DVD release, but upscale for High Definition is nice, and I hope Funimation figures out how to properly address the blu ray technology encoding process. Problem with blu ray titles with older works is scaling, and the process of which they were made with.

Otherwise if your a fan of Cowboy Bebop, episodic framework, and crazy hip hop house ambient music, this set is a must.

4294729,5,B0049TC8C6,"It has been several years (five to be exact) since I watched ""Samurai Champloo,"" and while I always knew it as good I somehow forgot that it is in fact one of the greatest anime series ever produced.

""Champloo"" is an Okinawan word (more properly pronounced champuru) meaning ""mix"" or ""blend,"" and is most often applied to traditional food dishes such as ""Goya Champloo"" or ""Stir-fried Champloo."" It's basically a mixed stir-fry with a seemly infinite number of potential ingredient, and a very fitting description of Watanabe Shinichiro's ""Samurai Champloo.""

An eclectic blend of ancient and modern, hip-hop and koto, and pretty much everything else thrown into the mix, this is a Japan where a wild swordfighter uses capoeira moves to slice and dice with a fury, an enormous man known as the Oni smashes skulls with his massive club, and two twin brothers compete in a match to graffiti Himeji castle.  Watanabe is a heck of a chef, and manages to balance all these seemingly dissonant elements into a tasty dish that might even top his previous concoction&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cowboy-Bebop/dp/B00102FF7U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cowboy Bebop</a>.

The story features a bookish but deadly ronin (Jin), a wild sword-swinging roustabout (Mugen) and a kooky but determined waitress (Fuu).  The trio is pushed into an unhappy alliance, several times attempting to split up, yet always finding their destinies inexorably intertwined. Fuu leads them on a quest for the ""Samurai who smells of Sunflowers,"" providing the McGuffin that keeps the story moving.  Each episode changes in tone and character, moving effortlessly between comedy and drama, tragedy and action.

Each ingredient supports the flavor of the other perfectly, creating a variety of story possibilities that couldn't be found by following just one personality.  Categorize ""Samurai Champloo"" as ""hip-hop samurai"" is too much of an easy dismissal; the series goes much deeper than that.  Along with hip-hop music and culture, the series features Japanese history like the hidden Christian sects, and samurai movie mythology such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Miyomoto-Musashi/dp/B0001UZZT0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Miyomoto Musashi</a>&nbsp;and the female ninjas&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/kunoichi/dp/B000M53GK4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">kunoichi</a>.  Every episode is a surprise, and every episode had be glued to the screen in anticipation of what would come next.

Watanabe's trademark style is on fine display, with some of the most fluid animation you will ever see and a quick and flowing story punctuated with quiet moments of reflection. The story builds at a good pace, allowing all the characters to develop in time.  With twenty-six episodes, there is plenty of time to build characterization and identity, and while Jin, Mugen and Fuu appear at first to be mere stereotypical genre characters, they deepen with each telling.

This boxset is a pretty sweet package for this amazing series.  Produced by Geneon and released by Funimation, it has all twenty-six episodes on seven disks, each with its own slim case.  There are four episodes per disk, meaning that no quality has been lost by squishing too many episodes on a single disk to save space.  Inside each case is an essay or comments by one of the people who worked on the series, giving insight into how it was created and what goes into such a collaboration.

The only possibly thing I would have wished for this box set is that Funimation had double-packed the DVDs into the slim cases, as they have with most of their other series.  With as many DVDs as I own, space can be a premium at my house and so the smaller the packaging the better.",1264982400,10,3834,5.569707401032702

Even though stories about samurai don't necessarily interest me, Mr Watanabe's involvement (and amazon.com's blu ray sale) made me pick this up on blu ray and I'm glad I did.

There are some elements from Cowboy Bebop that can be seen in this which I enjoyed, down to the occasional John Woo reference (watch for birds), and the characters are interesting enough in the beginning to hold your interest until the story kicks into higher and higher gear as the show goes on.  We have Mugen the maniac: born on an island where prisoners were exiled and looked to be basically raised by wolves.  Fiercely independent and feral yet with glimmers of gold in his heart.  There's Jin: quiet and dignified, very refined.  Also fiercely independent, yet disciplined, graceful and does not waste a movement.  Driving the story is Fuu, a ditzy 15 year old tea house waitress who saves their lives and extorts a promise from the two guys to travel with her and act as her bodyguards as she hunts for the samurai who smells of sunflowers.

Their adventures on the way are by turns hilarious and terrifying and watching the characters grow, both personally and in their relationships with each other is a joy to watch.  The story builds to a mighty climax that is worthy of Mr Watanabe's followup to Cowboy Bebop.  This is a three disc set, and by the time the third disc was in my player, I couldn't stop until it was finished.

The artwork is nothing short of gorgeous.  These characters move among a world that look like paintings that could be displayed in the finest art galleries.  I wasn't sure about a hip hop soundtrack, but it really worked in this show and I need to see if I can buy it.  My particular favorite is the opening theme song which I can't get out of my head (and that's a GOOD thing).  The 5.1 soundtrack sounds wonderful and the picture was crisp and clear, just as you'd expect from a blu ray release (if only Cowboy Bebop would be released on blu ray!).

I haven't watched the dubbed version, but the voice actors' performances on the original Japanese soundtrack are terrific.  I was pleasantly surprised to hear Koichi Yamadera (Cowboy Bebop's Spike) in one episode as well as Unsh Ishizuka (Cowboy Bebop's Jet), who appeared as a character in a couple of episodes as well as doing some voiceover narration in several more.  I felt like I had moved to a new neighborhood and was treated to visits from some old friends.

Even if you've never seen Cowboy Bebop, this show is very worth seeing, especially if you're fond of samurai swordplay.  You'll see that aplenty in Samurai Champloo.  That said, like Bebop, this is not a show for kids - I'd say it was rated PG-13 at the very least.  With swordplay, you have blood and these folks aren't shy about having characters bleed on screen.  I've seen more explicit results of violence in other shows and movies, but this one has enough violence that some parents might want to consider waiting until children are older before showing it to them.  There is also some language that might be inappropriate to the little ears in the family, as well as some brief nudity and mature dialog.

As far as I'm concerned, this has everything, great characters and relationships, easy on the eyes and ears and a story that builds and develops to a very satisfying conclusion.

4294736,4,B0049TC8C6,"This is not so much a review, just making others aware that even though most Blu Ray Discs have a specific zone and still play on any zone player, this disc will NOT play on anything but a zone A Blu Ray player.

*UPDATE*

I had an import PS3 on order from Hong Kong which has now arrived and plays zone A BD so I can give a few more words regarding the actual BD itself rather than the zone issue.

As has already been mentioned, it's an upscale. My previous viewing experience had been my Champloo DVDs via my PC so when it was on fullscreen the quality was never as good as a TV. This version is much better via the PC monitor (mostly due to the resolution).

I think the quality complaints here and on other sites, aside from the artifacting, are caused by what looks like filters and effects used in the original. I kept seeing what looked like sun glare whenever the sun/sky was in shot but then noticed that it appeared at other times when the sun/sky wasn't on screen. It was appearing when any light source or suggested light source was on screen and emanated from that source. My thoughts were it was a bad transfer but when compared with the DVD it was the same so I'm putting it down to some lighting filter/effect.

For perfectionists, the only 'error' I've yet to see is a quite noticeable red dot that appears on the cowardly samurai's chin during the hot spring scene on Redeye Reprisal (Ep. 2) at 32:38. An annoyance similar to the error at the end of the first episode of the UK Gundam Wing box-set released by Bees.

Some time was spent debating whether this would be a worthwhile purchase as I own the DVDs already. Never-the-less, I pre-ordered but only afterward read about the upscaling and the problems it could pose. After that I cancelled the order then went back a week later and saved it in my basket umm-ing and ahh-ing on what to do. I decided to wait and read the reviews post-release which were no different than expected, so I bit the bullet and took the plunge and I'm glad I did.

In my opinion it's definitely worth buying even if you already own the DVDs, especially at the price it's going for now ($44.99). As TeamReveal stated, this is probably the best we will ever get.",1261526400,2,2211,4.364963503649635
4294737,3,B0049TC8C6,"In 2004, Shinichiro Watanabe known for his directorial work on the anime ""Cowboy Bebop"" and ""Macross Plus"" returned with his latest anime ""Samurai Champloo"".  The 26-episode anime series was no doubt highly anticipated due to Watanabe's work with ""Cowboy Bebop"" and featured anime production by Studio Manglobe (""Sengoku BASARA"", ""Ergo Proxy"").  The series spawned a manga series right after and also a Sony PlayStation 2 video game.

The anime series would receive rave reviews for its stylish presentation but also how it would be a samurai action series with slapstick comedy.  Also, featuring a hip-hop soundtrack courtesy of Watanabe's friend DJ Tsutchie and the Japanese hip hop duo Forces of Nature, Fat Jon, Nujabes and other talented artists who would contribute to the series and have involvement in the various album soundtracks.

In terms of its stylish presentation, it helps when the series has talents such as veteran Kazuto Nakazawa (who worked on ""Kill Bill Vol. 1"" and anime series such as ""El Hazard"", ""Blood+"", ""Fatal Fury"", ""Starship Girl Yamamoto Yohko"") working on character designs and Mahiro Maeda (""Blue Submarine No. 6"", ""Final Fantasy: Unlimited"", ""Gunbuster"", ""Gunsmith Cats"", ""Last Exile"") working on the weapons (mechanical design) for the series.

In America, the series would debut a year later on the Cartoon Network's ""Adult Swim"" featuring a censored (due to profanity) version and also eliminating any blood or nudity.  The anime series was released in the US by Geneon and on December 2009, the complete series is being re-released on Blu-ray courtesy of FUNimation Entertainment.

In the first episode of ""Samurai Champloo"", Mugen goes into a tea house where a group of samurai thugs and a politician's son try to intimidate patrons including waitress Fuu.  Mugen offers to take on the men if she will feed him 50 dumplings.  At first, Fuu resists but when she starts getting hassled by the men, she agrees to Mugen's demands.  Mugen, meanwhile takes on the samurai thugs and easily defeats them.

Meanwhile, Jin is a ronin samurai had taken on the local magistrates men who were about to slay an innocent man who didn't have enough money to pay them.  Jin then enters the tea house to get something to eat/drink but sees a fight between Mugen and the thugs.  Mugen thinks Jin is part of the group of thugs and attacks him but Jin is able to counter him.

Both Mugen and Jin start fighting to the death but with the tea house in shambles after the fight and burning down, the two are caught after they faint from smoke inhalation and now face execution for the murder of the magistrate's son.  Meanwhile, Fuu who no longer has her job because the place had burned down now wants to focus on finding this samurai who smells like sunflowers and feels that she needs some help.  She decides that Mugen and Jin would be the perfect choice but to get them to join her, she must rescue them.

And because she is able to rescue them, the two must join her but also promise that they can not duel one another until they help her find the samurai who smells like sunflowers.  ""Samurai Champloo"" features a storyline which features the three as they travel from village to village, getting into trouble and also helping those in need.

""Samurai Champloo"" is a series that focuses on three individuals who join together in order to find the sunflower samurai.  Their adventures take place during the Edo Period.  The main characters are:

Mugen: The wild hair, foul-mouthed wandering samurai who sports a metal-soled geta (traditional Japanese wooden sandals) and a samurai sword and wanders from village to village.  Wants to fight the best and so far, his biggest challenge has been Jin but knows he can't fight him until they finish their quest.

Jin: The quiet, mild-mannered ronin  who wears eyeglasses and fights via the traditional kenjutsu style of the samurai.  Slow to anger but easily gets aggravated by Mugen.

Fuu: The 15-year-old girl who recruits both Mugen and Jin to find a samurai who smells like sunflowers.  She is accompanied by her pet flying squirrel named Momo.

Each of the three individuals tend to get themselves in trouble but in each episode which features an adventure as they go from village to village to find this sunflower-smelling samurai and try to make it to Nagasaki in order to find the sunflower samurai

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Samurai Champloo"" is featured in 1080p High Definition 169.  Before I go into discussion about picture quality, I just want to emphasize that this is an upconvert of a 2004 anime TV series.  Television series in Japan are not exactly the best in quality compared to a Japanese OVA and a film.  With that being said, ""Samurai Champloo"" was produced by Manglobe who had a lot of time to work on this stylishly cool looking anime series.  When this anime series first came out, you can't help but think how awesome the look of the series was courtesy of veterans Kazuto Nakazawa and Mahiro Maeda.  The series looks absolutely fresh and cool!

Here we are five years later and the Blu-ray release is out and there are positives and negatives.  The positive is that the series looks beautiful especially when you see the oranges and reds, lush green plants looking quite vibrant.  Painted backgrounds and homes look very detailed and beautiful.

The negative in terms of picture quality is that this series has its share of compression artifacts and also it has some coloration problems that is quite evident from episode-to-episode.  For example, you can see someone's clothing that is purple or blue but then see this glob of dark green showing up and I know for HD videophiles, this is unacceptable.

As for anime fans, many see this as a problem that will happen with an older anime TV series that was meant for DVD and problems that are more evident when upconverted to Blu-ray.  Granted, those who will see the artifacting are those who watch these anime series with a larger screen.

With that being said, the series does has its share of moments where PQ is just really, nice and colorful but in terms of this coloration problem, it was evident on the ""Tsubasa"" Blu-ray release from FUNimation but this time around, it's much more noticeable.

As for audio, ""Samurai Champloo"" is a series that is presented in Dolby TrueHD 5.1 English and Japanese.  The fact that we get the lossless Japanese audio track is actually pretty big considering the recent prior FUNimation Entertainment Blu-ray anime TV series have only featured a 2.0 track.

For both lossless audio soundtrack, the series is front and center channel driven.  Dialogue is clear and the music comes out of the front and surround channels with nice bass.  There is some surround channel usage with crowd ambiance and special effects that fill up each channel at times but it is important to note that this is a samurai action series and is mostly swordplay.  Also, there is action at the end of nearly each episode, the series is primarily front and center channel driven, especially when you reach the final episodes.

Optional subtitles are available in English.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Samurai Champloo"" was an anime series that really came with a lot of hype because of Shinichiro Watanabe's involvement.  Questions many people had was how can he follow up from ""Cowboy Bebop"".  Will it be a smart anime?  Will it be a stylish anime?  And similar to CB, would ""Samurai Champloo"" feature an awesome musical soundtrack?

When I first saw the anime series, I was very impressed with the animation and character designs.  First, for a samurai anime series, you get all the action but also this combination with slapstick comedy which was pretty awesome!  But also, this gorgeous, fresh looking anime series that was really different from any samurai-related anime that came before it (and there have been many).

The character designs were pretty cool but it's the characters that are different than previous series.  For example, Mugen...sports a wild hair cut and steel-soled geta.  Definitely not your typical looking samurai!  And where ""Cowboy Bebop"" went a more jazz route, ""Samurai Champloo"" goes for a more Japanese hip-hop route.

But the series also had a touch of historical information such as the Shimabara Rebellion, Van Gogh's appreciation for Ukiyo-e paintings and fictionalized versions of Mariya Enshirou and Miyamoto Musashi.

But of course, the series doesn't take itself too seriously as a period-driven samurai series such as a ""Hakkenden"" or even ""Rurouni Kenshin"" as the group encounters bandits that beat box and blue-eyed Europeans who can pretend they are Japanese. Sure, the series is a bit farfetched if one is expecting a serious storyline but that's what makes this series a bit unique from it's look, music and its overall presentation.  The series although is action and comedy driven, definitely gets serious as the series approaches its final three episodes.

As for the Blu-ray release, its unfortunate that the series is not one of FUNimation Entertainments better looking anime series on Blu-ray but considering that this is a TV series and it's an older 2004 anime series, it all comes down to if the PQ is good enough for the viewer, their setup (especially how large their monitor/screen is) and if you want to watch the series with a lossless soundtrack.

But overall, ""Samurai Champloo - The Complete Series"" was a fun and entertaining series which I really enjoyed even before it came out on Blu-ray.  It was a unique style of anime series (and sure enough, the hip hop and samurai style was revisted with ""Afro Samurai"" a few years later) at the time and although not as deep as ""Hakkenden"", nor does it feature a large cast such as a ""Samurai 7"" but it manages to captivate you with its quirkiness, action, its hip style and bass-driven hip hop music in the background.

Overall, for those with their original DVD's, you're probably good with those and may want to upgrade to Blu-ray for the lossless audio.  But If you are a fan of Shinichiro Watanabe's work or if you are looking for an entertaining anime series to have on Blu-ray, ""Samurai Champloo - The Complete Series"" is worth having in your collection.",1261440000,12,13907,4.789983164983165
4294738,2,B0049TC8C6,"Samurai Champloo was not animated in HD so this set is an upscale.  However, it appears that a filter was used to scrub the grain from the video.  For example, in one scene on the DVD you can see the individual roof tiles on some buildings.  In the same scene on the Blu-Ray disk, the roof is just a blurry mess.

I recommend getting the DVD set over the Blu-Rays.  I suppose if you hate grain that was added to the video on purpose by the animators and can stand the drop in detail, you should get this set.  Since this is a true case where the DVD has more detail than the Blu-Ray set, I would go for the DVD and just use an upscale player.",1260921600,43,642,4.015748031496063
4294739,5,B0049TC8C6,"This show has been reviewed in detailed lots of times so if you want a review of the content then you should look at the various reviews for the dvd version as the content of the 26 episodes is in fact the same. I'll concentrate on the blu-ray vs. dvd debate that is brewing up.

Now, I've been told that this show will never actually be in true hd because of the various CG(computer graphic) elements that were done in SD. In order for us to see this show in true hd they would have to go back and redo all of the CG elements that were originally done in SD. A lot of earlier shows have this problem, such as Cowboy Bebop which when this comes out in blu-ray will probably be an upscale as well. Thus, this is probably the best we will ever get. Older animation that was hand drawn was done completely on film which in fact has an infinite resolution. Computer graphics are limited to the actual resolution at which they were created at, but they can be upscaled such as in this tv show. Since this was a tv show that aired on SD originally, the computer graphics were done in SD, hence the need to redo the CG for a true HD resolution.

I've seen pictures from an upscaled DVD and from this Blu-ray and overall the Blu-ray looks better in my opinion. If you look carefully at still shots you will notice that the dnr filter used removes some of the detail in the picture. So looking closely, the DVD has just a tad more detail in certain parts. You have to remember though, that the animation style does not have a ton of detail to begin with so you will have to look really hard to see the difference in detail. The ONLY time I could really tell that the DVD had more detail was on scenes were there were large pieces of wood paneling. On the DVD you see that there is more detail on the wood where the blu-ray version slightly blurs this out because of the dnr filter used. Again, in the still shots I saw, I could only tell on the wood paneling of certain scenes. On the characters, backgrounds, etc. I could tell no difference in detail.

A lot of people REALLY miss the benefit of blu-ray in these instances though. DVD's are much more compressed than Blu-ray's in both picture and sound. That is one of the reasons why the DVD version has colors that are not as vibrant and a picture that has a lot more noise and macroblocking. So while the DVD has just a smidge more detail in certain parts, this is negated by the fact that the DVD version is highly compressed, introducing artifacts into the picture and in the process giving you a picture that is not as good as it could be.

Overall, in my opinion, this makes the much higher bitrate sound and picture in blu-ray the winner. We can complain that the show isn't in true HD, but we have to remember that unless they redo the CG parts, it probably never will be in true HD. People can cling to their DVD's and say they are the best, but they will miss the fact that the higher bitrate of blu-ray in both picture and sound give a better overall experience.

The difference between the DVD and Blu-ray isn't night and day but it is definitely noticeable. If you have neither, then the blu-ray version is the one to pick up, but if you have the DVD set already then this isn't worth picking up unless Samurai Champloo is one of your all-time great favorites, or you just have money to burn.",1260921600,272,3348,4.266141732283464
4294740,5,B0049TC8C6,"If you don't have the DVD Boxset of Samurai Champloo, this is a must have. The picture is great considering it's just upscaled.

The audio is perfect. Sound great on surround sound. It contains a lot of the same feature the DVD Boxset have.

If you have don't have a Bluray player, definitely get the dvd because the quality difference is not at all very increased from the bluray since it's upscaled.",1260835200,8,401,4.555555555555555
4294741,2,B0049TC8C6,"This just arrived for me at my door not too long ago.  Being that Samurai Champloo is one of my favorite animes, I was excited to pop this in my PS3.  I knew beforehand that this would be an upscale, but if the upscale were anything at least like Full Metal Panic: TSR, then I would be satisfied.  Unfortunately, this was not the case.

Just looking at the picture was a disappointment to me.  I own the DVDs as well, so I took one out as a reference and compared the two.  The difference between the Blu-ray and upscaled DVD were almost negligible.  There wasn't that much of a difference.  The blu-ray version had a *smidge* more clarity, but nevertheless almost looked identical to the DVD version.

If you own the DVDs already, then don't waste your time.  If you don't own this series yet, then this is a great purchase.

I am giving this two stars as I would not have purchased this knowing what I know now.",1260835200,48,913,4.34319526627219

Samurai Champloo left me and my friends wishing there was more just because thats how sick it is! Hardly any of it was predictable! Don't believe me? Youtube the first episode. There's plenty of action, cursing, blood and gore so this is deffinately ""a guy's must see""! And amazon has this set the cheapest in price too!",1260576000,2,493,4.550561797752809

The series looks weird/dumb,Mugen is an disrace to samurai every where,I didn't get the ending,and Fuu is annoying. Overall try other great titles not the corny ones",1259625600,3,272,4.6875
4294754,5,B0049TC8C6,"Samurai Champloo is a wonderful series, certainly the best anime I have ever had the pleasure of watching and is, indeed, one of the best series I've watched in any animated or filmed medium. As a person who isn't a regular anime viewer, I find this show to be very accessible and enjoyable even to people who aren't familiar with the medium.

The animation is smooth, clean, and fluid, more so than one often finds in anime, and the action is fast-paced and well-choreographed, always interesting to watch and never interrupted by lengthy dialogue. It's easy to tell that the artists worked very hard to create visually interesting and pleasing characters and settings. The animation in every single scene is infused with a sense of care and precision that is never lazy or sloppy. The level of detail ranges scene-to-scene from strikingly intricate to beautifully minimalistic, and yet the two styles blend together so well that neither ever seems out of place. Overall, the visuals are very artistic and colorful, be they contemporary graffiti art murals or traditional Japanese landscapes.

The hip hop themes and other anachronisms seem completely compatible with the old-world samurai setting, as well. The tone of the series, overall, is edgy and contemporary, and no fuss is made about what is and isn't accurate to history, so meeting characters with bleached blond hair, wearing Ray Bans, and beat boxing doesn't come across as all that outlandish.

The music is profoundly eclectic and always enjoyable. There's hip hop, of course, opening and closing nearly every episode as well as underscoring quite a few scenes, but mixed in is also a fine selection of more traditional tunes including hauntingly subdued Japanese folk songs.

And, for the pleasure of the scholars and poets in the audience, the series is packed with metaphors, symbols, motifs, and other references that add a deliciously deeper level of meaning to the goings-on in the characters' lives. Watching the series once will satisfy anyone interested in the plot, but watching it over again in order to excavate and research the references would be well worth the effort. (An excellent and highly-recommended companion to the anime is the Samurai Champloo Roman Album, full of cultural and historical notes as well as information about what inspired the series.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Roman-Album-Samurai-Champloo/dp/1593076428/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Roman Album: Samurai Champloo</a>)

As for this boxed set itself, it's a very nice collection, compact, clean, and handsome-looking on a shelf. Each of the seven discs is labeled and numbered according to its order in the series, and each disc comes in its own ultra-thin case. Each case, furthermore, sports its own unique collage of Samurai Champloo art on the front cover and the disc's episode listings and screen grabs on the back cover. Plus, printed on the reverse side of each case's cover are interviews with many of the show's creators which offer perspectives on different elements of the series' creation, including script writing, music recording, character design, and series direction. All of this is packaged neatly inside a glossy black cardboard box bearing the title of the series and an image of each of the three main characters.

The series has been dubbed in English and will play automatically on this setting, but I recommend going into the setup menu and enabling the original Japanese voices with English subtitles. The series is so steeped in rich Japanese culture and the Japanese actors are so superb that watching the episodes in English seems silly. In fact, the English dubs may even dull the clarity of an otherwise finely-crafted piece of art.

(Note that this collection provides audio in both Japanese and English, but subtitles only in English.)",1251849600,4,3868,5.300163132137031
4294755,5,B0049TC8C6,"WOW... I don't think I can say enough good things about this series.
If you are a fan of anime, then just get this... you won't be disappointed.
My favorite episode, hands down, is#23 Baseball Blues on Volume 6",1249084800,,210,4.410256410256411
4294756,5,B0049TC8C6,"It's hard to take ""Samurai Champloo"" too seriously. The series features a breakdancing samurai, hip-hop music, beatboxing and rapping.

But ""Samurai Champloo"" is a masterpiece in light comedy, action and even a compelling story involving a daughter of a samurai who smells of sunflowers.

As the two samurai heroes say in episode two, there's something silly about a samurai who smells of sunflowers. However, this series truly shows off some of the best battles ever seen in an anime, embellished with the gorgeous environment of ancient Japan. There's a wide variety of stories, from a complex episode about a dying mother, an episode about the origins of Japanese manga and even an episode about a traveling geisha.

There's just one catch--the series is chock full of hip-hop references. Episode 8 alone is a goofy comedy tidbit about a samurai traveling the world with a beatboxing companion. Episode 16 features three samurai travelers rapping rumors they've heard on the road. Episode 18 gives us a closer look at the dangerous life of taggers in ancient Japan.

Okay, maybe this isn't the most realistic period piece series ever made. However, this series has so much fun with blending hip-hop, Christian missionaries and samurai fighting together that one can't resist loving this series.

It's no surprise that this is one of the most accessible action anime series around. Director Shinichiro Watanabe, responsible for the excellent series ""Cowboy Bebop,"" has a flair for creating some of the slickest battle sequences ever made. His storylines might be more simplistic than, say, ""Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex."" However, this is exactly why American audiences enjoy his anime series the most. They are simple stories of men who fight for something they care for.

There's no better time to buy the box set of ""Samurai Champloo."" The box set is $30 cheaper than the Geneon set, so anime fans have to get this collection. Hands down, this is one of my absolute favorites.",1248134400,8,1992,5.057926829268292
4294757,5,B0049TC8C6,"Mugen is a cocky, rebellious, bandy-legged fighter who incorporates break-dancing techniques into his unorthodox fighting style. Jin is more your typically calm and stoic samurai (or ronin, to be more precise), steeped in martial tradition, who finds satisfaction in the perfect execution of his warrior craft. Mugen and Jin aren't friends - in fact, they are contentious and want to test their skills against each other - yet they find themselves joining forces, thanks to Fuu, an insistent and kinda quirky waitress who inveigles the two into helping her search for the Samurai Who Smells Like Sunflowers. For 26 episodes, the discordant trio undergo many adventures, some serious, some hilarious, some just plain out weird. The only constants are the bickerings amongst the three, the scrounging for food, and the intrusion of modern day sensibilities. Oh, and the rampant butt kicking as done by Mugen and Jin.

On the heels of his popular Cowboy Bebop anime series, Shinichiro Watanabe decided to put a new spin on the samurai anime with his irreverent, hip Samurai Shamploo. Shamploo means ""stir fry"" or a mix, and this is certainly what this series is about, as it fuses the traditional samurai credo and decorum with the unexpected modern day incursions of hip hop attitudes, beatboxing, street tagging, and baseball. The episodes are supported by cool Japanese hip hop music soundtracks and blazing hip hop scratches for scene segues. Watanabe also makes beautiful use of visual metaphors, thereby adding more depth to the shenanigans. The ripping animation and dynamically constructed fight scenes are guaranteed not to disappoint.

Kudos, too, to the voice actors, especially Steven Jay Blum (aka Daniel Andrews, who also voiced Cowboy Bebop's Spike) as the bestial Mugen. Kirk Thornton as Jin and Kari Wahlgren as Fuu are both excellent. The voice actor for the sometimes series narrator Policeman Sakami Manzou (""the Saw"") is also very good.

These episodes are definitely rated PG-13. This anime series doesn't hesitate to throw in scenes of drug use and graphic violence. Some episodes even contain mild sexual scenes.

My favorite episodes are ""The Art of Altercation"" (for the spoken word samurai and his beatbox backup), the atmospheric ""Cosmic Collisions"" (where the trio fight the undead), the hilarious ""Baseball Blues"" (where the American pitcher couldn't find the strike zone with the dog at bat, and he ends up inadvertently hitting the mutt - not to worry, no animated dogs were hurt in the making of this anime), and the concluding 3-episode arc ""Evanescent Encounter"" (where Mugen and Jin are challenged to their very limits, resolve their rivalry, and Fuu at last catches up to the Sunflower Samurai).

Here are the 26 episodes (alliterative American titles first, with the original Japanese titles in parenthesis):

26 Episodes

All the special features should be included for this release from the original Geneon release.

This show is among one of the most popular Anime series to hit Adult Swim. I right away like the series because of its style, language, and comedic lines. I also like it because of the visuals and the depth of color and detail that was put in. The storyline is mainly told in series of episodes, but not continuously like other animes. Some episodes go off tagent from the main storyline which just brings more development to the main characters or not at all. I don't want to go too much into detail in the storyline.

Since this is a 7 disc version, I would expect it to be exactly like the original Geneon release with all the features intact.

If that's the case, then picture quality is top notch with excellent English Dub and excellent 5.1 sound for both languages. Although there is 5.1 sound, it doesn't fully utilize the LFE or the rear channels for that matter. The surround sound mix is a little above average, but the quality of the sound remains top notch with high trebles and good dynamic range. As for the picture quality, the blacks are very deep with vivid colors and virtually no pixalation during action sequences or artifacts.

If you like Anime with hop hop sytle applied or simply because you want to watch lots of bloody sword fights, then this is the anime for you.",1246147200,5,1607,4.581881533101045

It is a mix of samurai philosophy and hip hop culture, its something not many people can pull off, however this anime exceeds all expectations for me. It was created by the legendary Shinichiro Watanabe (Cowboy Bebop, Macross Plus) so theres no need to worry, its a great series from beginning to end.

I'm not sure what the box set looks like, but at this price, there is no complaining here, I'm gonna buy it regardless.",1245542400,4,487,4.597701149425287

I really have little respect for shows that file under the anime category (Still love Gundam Wing and other Toonami shows, Pokemon, etc.), I just find the stories to be ridiculous (Not that Champloo isn't, but it works) and the animation is flat, stiff and sometimes just lazy. This show comes from director Shinichiro Watanabe (Cowboy Bebop), so animation is fluid and vivid (just wait till you see the fights!). Accompany that with beautiful background art, a great cast, and addictive music... you got yourself the greatest anime series of all time.

While this isn't a review on the actual product, at its price it has to be better than collecting all the volumes or any other boxed set. And I'll bet anything the quality is better than any bootleg/import you can find out there.",1245283200,,914,4.670807453416149
4294761,5,B0049TC8C6,"Lethal Weapon. Rush Hour. Beverly Hills Cop. Movies such as these have all proven just how much of a good time it can be to watch opposite personalities that are somehow bound at the hip being forced to walk the same road and reach the same destination. That's Samurai Champloo.  Mugen and Jin are master swordsman who are equally matched and mutually repellent of each other. What binds them at the hip is a young girl named Fuu who has obligated both men to helping her find a mysterious samurai who smells of sunflowers.

It sounds like a flowery, poetic ambition. Hardly. For twenty-six episodes, this trio find themselves in pretty much every possible adventure that the writers could think of. Some of these adventures elicit slapstick and sometimes crude comedy, bringing out the playful side of an otherwise amoral Mugen. Other adventures are just straight out brutal and bloody battles which usually evoke the spiritual longing of the introspective Jin. Fuu, on the other hand, remains endearing and chattering no matter the adventure. It's really hard not to like all three of the characters from the onset of their journey. It's impossible not to care about their well being as reach they reach journey's end.

As strong and enduring as these men are, they are brought to their physical limits as each new foe that confronts them is stronger then the last. The writers do not stoop to zen cliches of outsmarting or transcending the stronger adversaries. Nope. Jin and Mugen will have to win these battles through sheer force. The good news is that while slicing and dicing their enemies, they'll start cutting through the personal layers of each other. Well, sort of. Neither character is so overly complicated as to warrant any cliche epiphanies.

I suppose that is what makes Champloo so refreshing. It's an animation with heart. But it's not presented as a contrived westernized version of a zen riddle or anything like that. In the end, it's simplistic theme is both universal and elegant: friendship.",1244678400,5,2016,4.920588235294118

It follows the adventures of Mugen and Jin as they help Fuu try to find a Samurai who smells like sunflowers.  The series can be a bit violent at times and Mugen is a bit of a potty mouth, but it's not too terrible.

Young Fuu is on a mission to find a samarai who smells of sunflowers, but she could use a little help. Enter Mugen and Jin, both complete opposites in fighting style and morals, but working together keeps their bellies full. Not to mention they each have their own hidden agendas.

Samarai Champloo is a little bit of everything- funny, dramatic, fighting skill, moral code, friendship, all with a little silliness thrown in, but that's anime for ya. The music is a bit of pop culture thrown in which gives an edge to it as well. I've had friends who don't watch anime enjoy this series easily. It's just pure fun!",1240272000,5,746,4.525925925925926

4294798,5,B0049TC8C6,"I've had a love/hate relationship with anime. Too often, a great series turns into a bombastic mess, where the characters get too obsessed with big guns, explosions and gore, gore, gore. However, this series was funny and exciting.
Samurai Champloo is a mix of tough samurai fighting, romance and comedy. Shinichiro Watanabe said the series was originally intended to be a comedy, but then someone told him that the company wanted to add 13 more episodes. As a result, this series became an action comedy.
And boy, this anime has laughs everywhere. Some episodes have beatboxers and some focus on graffiti tagging. The most hilarious episodes, however, are episodes 23 and 24, which center on samurai baseball and samurai horror.
At the same time, the anime has surprisingly historical Japanese episodes. One episode centers on a samurai from the Ainu, a minority group that was nearly eliminated in the 16th and 17th centuries. Another episode focuses on the Christian movement in the southern islands of Japan. However, the last three episodes are astonishingly amazing.
Sometimes I can't believe a series has this many good episodes, but it does. Even the episode which summarizes the episodes in the past is very funny. The dubs are decent too, except I wish that the voice actors wouldn't say yakyuuza instead of yakuza.
An anime shouldn't be this good, but this one IS that good. I can only give my highest rating to this series.",1190505600,3,1435,4.95850622406639

A perfect blend of action, dialogue and hip-hop influence has created something truly unique and exciting. It's one of the few series of any kind that kept getting better as it went on and the finale was nothing short of brilliant. Loose ends tied up, no questions remain. Well...maybe one. Aside from the afromentioned, the artwork and design are amazing and the soundtrack fits perfectly to the scenes in which they are used. This one has high replay value even if it's shorter (26 episodes) than most animes. I won't get into the storyline, all I'll say is you need to buy this dvd set or steal it from someone you know who has it. It's worth it.",1188691200,,833,4.56
4294802,5,B0049TC8C6,"Samurai Champloo happens to be my favorite anime series.

The overall plot is a bit vague, and often gets lost in the mix, taking a back seat to various minor sub-plots and the action of the moment. That said, the 3 primary characters are a lot of fun, particularly together. Jin and Mugen, opposites in the extreme, complement one another brilliantly, and the ever changing relationship between them, as well as each of their relationships with Fuu, is what this series is really all about.

Combine that with the offbeat hiphop samurai vibe the series has in general, as well as the great action sequences and random funny moments throughout, and you have a truly unique, very entertaining series.

I'm not sure I'd recommend this series for children, but its not overly grotesque or offensive either.

Incedentally, avoid the bootleg version of this series. You are likely to find it available far cheaper, but many people have ended up buying badly flawed DVDs when taking that route.",1187913600,2,988,4.8982035928143715

As one would think, this would have the makings of all types of trouble in the future.  You're right, as they get into some high comedy, action-packed scenarios that they somehow find their way out of all the time.  Do yourself a favor, if you're reading this, and pick up this series.

4294808,5,B0049TC8C6,"First off, my drug of choice is cinema and I began watching anime because of the recent films that have made use of concepts from the genre. The first anime I ever watched was Ghost in the Shell, which for anyone who has seen the Matrix, there are a few striking similarities. From Ghost in the Shell, I watched Blood, Vampire Hunter D, Ghost in the Shell 2, Appleseed, Akira, and then I just happened to come along Samurai Champloo. Now anime purists will gasp but I had never heard of Watanabe and I bought the series on sheer impulse because I absolutely adore Asian action films (especially samurai ones). Hence, I began my journey into Samurai Champloo.

The first night I began watching the series, I promptly lost five hours of my life becoming engrossed in the characters. As other reviewers have mentioned, the story is really all about the characters and their interactions with one another. Odd stories (baseball games, graffiti wars, living dead, eating contests, secret police, kidnappings, bounty hunters, drugs, Dutch rulers, femme fatales, cults, evil monks, and more)  are masterfully stitched together to create a world where the traits of the characters can become amplified and investigated. I love ever single character that this series had to offer. No lie: every single one of them. Some anime has left me feeling empty because secondary characters seemed boring or even the main character was lacking a certain ""realness"". Not this series. Watanabe and the other geniuses he works with created deep characters that you root for and cry for. Just like any good film, the audience needs to care about the characters for the story to be good and Watanabe hit this nail on the head. You'll find yourself constantly laughing or on the edge of your seat because these characters will remind you of a good friend or someone you would like to have as a friend.

I finished the whole series in two days because I couldn't get enough of it. It has been 5 months since I watched it and I am seriously going through withdrawals. I've watched other anime series and films to see if they quench my thirst, but nothing like this series. Based on this work, I made another impulse buy and bought the Cowboy Bebop series. I'm about to make anime purists gasp again but this series is better than Cowboy Bebop. Many people seem to be calling this Watanabe's ""anime leftovers"" from Cowboy Bebop but they must be crazy. Watanabe took his almost perfect genre-bending Bebop series, amplified everything that was great about it, cut out all the rough parts, and created this masterpiece.

You are doing yourself a great injustice if you don't buy this set. If you don't want to lay down the hefty sum for this version, I own the ""bootleg"" version of it too and that is just fine (only costs about $25-$30). I have about 750 movies in my collection (I told you cinema was my drug) and NOTHING compares to the level of fun and enjoyment I got out of this series. I feel like writing Watanabe a letter and asking him to write Samurai Champloo 2 just so I can watch these characters and their stories some more. If you like action movies, drama, period pieces, artsy films, comedies, anime, rap being blended into a storyline, fantastic fight scenes, amazing animation, or just something entertaining to put on the tube for an hour or two, Samurai Champloo is the right choice. This series really is a beautiful piece of artwork that you owe to yourself to check out.  ~Mr. B",1171324800,30,3473,4.696223316912972
