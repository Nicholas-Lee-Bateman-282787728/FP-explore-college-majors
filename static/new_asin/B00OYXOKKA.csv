8685590,5,B00OYXOKKA,"I just received my copy of Two on Tap: Level One, and was so surprised how entertaining it was to watch, especially for a beginner tap dvd.  I really like how Melissa and Ron conduct themselves during the entire instructional portion of the dvd.  They keep the learning process lively and captivating, motivating you every step of the way.  I can't wait for Level Two to be released, and to see them perform live in my area.  Keep up the fantastic work guys!",1421884800,5,458,4.481927710843373
8685591,5,B00OYXOKKA,"I purchased the ""Two on Tap"" DVD in Sept. 2014, wondering if I could actually learn to tap dance at 63 years old.  I watched the entire DVD when it arrived and was a bit overwhelmed because I could not imagine that I'd be able to achieve my goal, actually tapping WITH the performers.  Melissa and Ron break the ""Tea for Two"" dance into small sections, slowly and professionally working with the viewer.  Their encouragement is so sincere, it was like they were in my home, personally instructing me, patiently taking me along the way.  One of the best features of the DVD is being able to review steps I may have needed more time in learning...which helped me tremendously.  I loved the way Melissa and Ron projected their own enjoyment of tap dancing while they performed the steps and continued to invite me to join them.  Before long, I was learning the routine.  Their enthusiasm was contagious, becoming my own motivation.  Not only was I exercising, taking part in a fun activity, but I was improving my sense of balance and movement. If you're interested in an enjoyable ""at home"" way to exercise, improve your posture, balance and physical agility, I highly recommend the ""Two on Tap"" DVD.",1415404800,22,1198,4.698564593301436
