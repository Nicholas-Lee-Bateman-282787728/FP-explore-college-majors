8203801,3,B000S1KUNI,"First off, I did not buy this off amazon. I bought it at the dvd/music ect store F.Y.E.  All my friends who like anime were reccomending it to me, so i thought i would give it a try. I bought vol. 1 and i was not very into it at all. It was a real suprise to me, though, sice i laugh so easily, i did not laugh one bit watching this. Sorry! Anyways, If you REALLY want a funny anime, i would suggest something like Lucky Star or Azumanga Daioh. Because School Rumble really isn't that great of an anime. The opening theme gets very annoying after a while, just thought i would point that part out. Since there are so many other reviews, you probably know what it is about already. Yah, I'm done now. Please go out and buy azumanga daioh or lucky star vol. 1, they are much better. Seriously! Thanks!",1272240000,,799,4.15483870967742
8203802,2,B000S1KUNI,"If you are a big fan on cutesy Japanese Anime, then you will definitely love School Rumble for a kick off. However, i say that, after having watched the Japanese version. I didn't think they could ruin another anime with english dubs, oh how very wrong was i. This is just one of the classic examples where dubbed versions, just suck. The American humor does not meet the same requirements as that of the Japanese, so your better off sticking with subtitles.",1217980800,2,458,4.597560975609756
8203803,3,B000S1KUNI,"Note:
This review is for the dvd and the contents within the dvd, I am not reviewing school rumble as an anime series.

Intro:
School Rumble is an anime series about high school life.  The series has many characters and that is one of the unique features of this anime.  There is a lot of parody of other animes within the series so those who watch anime frequently will notice this while watching the series whereas as casual viewers will have no clue.  Unto the review!

Pro:
This is the first dvd which introduces the main cast of characters and the plot of the series.  Here is the list of main characters: Harima, Tenma, Eri, Mikoto, Akira, Hanai, Yakumo, Karasuma.  Each character has a unique feature and that is the main selling point of this anime series.  Magnets included with the DVD and with every DVD released so far!

Con:
The dvd focuses on Tenma and Harima, whereas the other characters are not emphasized.  The 5 episodes are mostly focused on Tenma and Harima, whether they can confess their feelings to the person they like, pretty much this is repeated throughout the dvd (other volumes have other stories to go along with this; reason why I deducted stars for dvd 1).  Only those who know about anime or read the School Rumble manga (or regular manga readers) will understand the inside jokes displayed as casual or non anime fans will have no clue to what the jokes mean.

Conclusion:
If you are a fan of school life (particularly high school life) or have read the School Rumble manga then this volume is an absolute purchase for you.  Casual viewers and first time viewers will not understand the jokes going on but I will go on say to recommend it as it helps you to understand the Japanese culture and the anime series gets much better.  Recommended age is 13+ or high school (it makes sense since that's where the series is taking place)

P.S. I am a huge fan of school rumble and this review was done fairly for both fan of the series and non-anime viewers.",1196294400,,1986,4.523809523809524
8203804,5,B000S1KUNI,"I'm not a big fan of romantic comedies, because they are all the same, you know two beautiful girls fighting for the love of that lucky guy, however SCHOOL RUMBLE dares to be different.  This is a romantic comedy but its humor can be compare to my all time favorite NINJA NONSENSE, no it doesn't have innuendo but it delivers lots of healthy doses of humor.

Kenji Harima the bad-ass loner who is in love of Tenma Tsukamoto the innocent cute girl of the class, but she is in love of the weirdo of the class and the weirdo is in love of ... who knows.

School Rumble is a fun ride of pure nonsense, there isn't an omega plot, no character development, no mecha, No magic, Nada,  Just lots of that fine and clever humor from Japan.

Cons:
- O.O?

Pros:
- Music.
- animation.
- Fan service.
- Both English and Japanese versions are top-notch.
- surprisingly funny comedy.
- Five episodes.

If you're into Ninja Nonsense, Azumanga Daioh or Cromartie High School then by all means buy it.",1188777600,9,983,4.397790055248619
