5325369,5,B009GGWWCS,I like Mr. Ross's style. He takes each movement and explains the action. It is very easy to follow for beginners.,1359590400,17,113,4.428571428571429
5325370,2,B009GGWWCS,"very disappointed with this. It is unlike his AM tai chi. The program needs to be prompted to continue and there is no continous flow with instructions. The only good part is that he gives a good explanation of the foot work, that can be applied to all Tai chi elements. The intro should include all of his verbage instead of making the movement sections so tedious.  Samuel Barnes DVD is much better.",1357084800,24,401,4.493150684931507

5325402,3,B009GGWWCS,It's ok.,1488153600,,8,3.5
5325403,5,B009GGWWCS,"I think this intro into Tai Chi by D-D Ross is the best I have tried thus far. He breaks the routine into small easy to follow pieces and also explains some Tai Chi fundamentals. Some people may find this video moves along too slowly for these two reasons. For those who just want to know the moves of Tai Chi, this DVD video may not be for you. If you want to know how to properly perform Tai Chi, then this is an excellent intro. He also shows the routines in the mirror image forma i.e. he moves his left foot while telling you to move your right foot. He explains this in the video. I happen to find this method preferable and works best for me but I realize that some people find this method confusing. The moves are shown front on with no shots from varying angles presented, but realistically I didn't see any reason for any in this video. I will probably make my next Tai Chi instructional DVD one of Mr. Ross's once I have effectively learned all the moves of this one.",1485302400,3,978,4.207446808510638
5325404,5,B009GGWWCS,"I am new to practicing Tai Chi and I really do like this DVD. I am really, really uncoordinated, so his breakdown of each movement is extremely helpful. He breaks down the hand movements, then the foot movements and then each hand/foot movement together. I can understand why those more experienced with Tai Chi my find it slow, but for a novice like myself, it's the perfect pace.",1484352000,4,381,4.617647058823529

5325408,2,B009GGWWCS,"Not the greatest.  Problem is it doesn't flow smoothly from one posture to another, you have to keep starting it after doing one.  Then at end it doesn't put it together so you can repeat the whole routine. Over and over and that is what you need to get the routine down right.  takes too much time to go thru it so slowly and then have to start it again and again.  Blah!",1446681600,8,372,4.054794520547945

5325421,5,B009GGWWCS,"This is a great intro for someone who's totally new to tai chi.  I have taken a few classes & feel good doing tai chi so wanted to develop a flow practice.  This instruction is a good pace for learning as an absolute beginner.  It describes the movements very well & gets your mind in a good place too.  The only thing I wish it had was a long instructed flow maybe going through each flow 2 or 3 times as he instructs for a longer total flow.

The sections are grouped with each one describing 1 of the total 9 individual flows in 3-4 minutes each.  You have to use your remote to move through each section which moves your mind away from the flow some, but is good for finding the specific flow you want to remember.",1445472000,,718,4.129496402877698
5325422,5,B009GGWWCS,"David-Dorian Ross is the only person I have heard of with a hyphenated first name.

He is a good T'ai Chi instructor and this is a good video to put on your TV screen and follow along. That's what this video is intended to do. It is not a talking head video, it is a demonstration of how to do some T'ai Chi movements.

We are retired and we find that T'ai Chi and Qigong are beneficial to flexibility, balance, and being present in the body.

5325445,5,B009GGWWCS,"I do not find DVDs especially helpful for guidance with physical activities.  After studying Tai Chi in a class environment for 2 years - it was difficult to find classes when I moved to a new state.  I purchased numerous Tai Chi DVDS in an attempt to maintain my level of skill.  This DVD is the first to fit the bill.  The routines are comprehensive enough to get a good workout without being too complicated or time consuming.

This DVD was so perfect for my needs, I bought another of David Dorian Ross' discs and have not been disappointed.  Highly recommend this DVD when actual classes are not an option.",1421539200,10,611,4.509090909090909

5325449,2,B009GGWWCS,Decent instructions but after each step or flow is taught you have to go back to the menu and start the next one.  I found it very frustrating.,1407888000,6,143,4.107142857142857

5325452,1,B009GGWWCS,"I'm not too crazy about this Dvd. I'm an exercise instructor for disabled people and have been dancing for 6 decades and teaching for over 4 . I also have Cerebral Palsy. For some reason,  I really can't get into the way he present or teaches. There is something about it that just makes me want to tune out? I would not recommend this product at all.",1406160000,,351,4.2388059701492535
5325453,4,B009GGWWCS,I saw David on our local PBS station and fell in love with how he broke down the moves. Tried it once before and just couldn't get it. This works for my brain and body. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating is because I haven't gone through it all yet.,1400112000,,263,3.8
5325454,3,B009GGWWCS,Good intro to Tai Chi. My biggest criticism is that there is no easy way to do the whole process together. Each flow is broken into sections and never put into practice as a whole. He does do the flows together at the end of the last segment but you have to either watch the entire segment each time or try to fast forward to get to it.,1396396800,5,336,3.9558823529411766
5325465,3,B009GGWWCS,David Ross seems like a great guy but Tai Chi isn't for me.  I say try it and if you don't like it pass it along like I did.,1395705600,,124,3.2758620689655173
5325466,3,B009GGWWCS,At one time I had a beginning T'ai Chi by David-Dorian Ross that went through all the steps rather than focusing on a couple principles at a time.  I haven't really watched it all the way through enough to give a good rating on content yet.  It may be just what I need for the class I'm taking so this rating would not be fair.  It arrived the day before I left on vacation.,1395187200,,374,4.027027027027027
5325467,4,B009GGWWCS,"The instructions on the basics of the moves are great. Very easy to follow. Would have liked to have a triple run through at the end of each movement instruction, building the entire series of movements together. I seem to learn faster doing as I watch David demonstrate and a three-pete would help solidify it in my mind and body. My balance is horrible after knee replacement and this seems to be helping.",1395014400,,407,4.589041095890411

5325469,1,B009GGWWCS,"I didn't care for this one as much as an earlier David-Dorian Ross DVD.

exercises for me.",1392940800,4,149,4.555555555555555

5325471,5,B009GGWWCS,"This is the second DVD I have purchased for beginner Tai Chi.  The first video that I purchased several years ago had a wonderful warm-up section but when he got into putting the different movements together it was very difficult to follow -- so the only part of the DVD that I used was the warm-up
My brother had seen David-Dorian Ross on public tv fundraisers and like his instruction, so he purchased this DVD and recommended it to me.  He was very impresses how he demonstrated each movement and then put it together with the next.
This is an excellent DVD for those wishing to start Tai Chi.  I am now about three quarters of the way through and practice my Tai Chi daily.",1391904000,7,677,4.4
5325472,2,B009GGWWCS,This was very complicated and hard to follow. I have another Tai Chi dvd with much more clear and easy instructions.,1391731200,,116,4.571428571428571
5325473,5,B009GGWWCS,Bought this DVD for my mom.  We watched it with her and she seemed to like it.  But now I'm going to have to buy another one for myself.  I'm looking forward to repulsing the monkey.,1390435200,2,182,4.0

5325485,5,B009GGWWCS,"David-Dorian Ross clearly loves his Tai Chi and does an excellent job explaining movements even to a true ""beginner.""  I love the way he teaches with such grace in movement rather than just a slouchy everyday movement I've seen in other DVD's.  There's only nine movements which is great for an older person.  After all, some of us have a difficult time learning new/difficult things.  But the way he explains it, it's easy to just rewind until you get it.  Highly recommend it and just stick to it.",1389052800,,499,4.625
5325486,4,B009GGWWCS,tai chi is good for your health and this video has a mirror image which is easier to follow.  His instructions are very clear.,1386892800,,126,4.25

5325489,5,B009GGWWCS,"I tried many other Tai Chi  videos as a beginner. I was totally confused because the instructor seems to assume humans will get it right away. I became discouraged.

This video was presented in a step by step , slower fashion so as a beginner I could get it and replay it often with out feeling incompetent.

The steps are presented in small pieces which makes it good for beginners but probably boring for advanced learners.",1382832000,10,425,4.565789473684211

5325492,5,B009GGWWCS,"David-Dorian is an Excellent instructor on top of being  a US & World Medalist Tai Chi Master!
I learned the first five Tai Chi forms or elements in three days. It's so easy to follow David's instructions!
He summarizes all the forms often. I spent 20-30 minutes in the morning and again in the evening. In three days I can do the five forms without watching the DVD. Four forms more to go. I am  sure you will enjoy David's easy going instructions. He also explains the oriental concepts of each form. All the best!",1378598400,18,516,4.421052631578948

David gives brief explanations on the origin of Tai Chi and also practices ""mirror-think"" during the session; meaning He will reverse His own thoughts to match left/right instructions.

5325501,5,B009GGWWCS,"I love this cd.  I can work at my own pace and get each part of the movement down, restudy transition movements and go back as often as I need as it changes my usual muscle-memory actions.  David-Dorian is very clear and takes each movement separately and each part of the movement separately.  I have tried Tai Chi before and become frustrated and quit.  This time I can go as slow as I need and feel satisfaction in completing the movement correctly.",1374019200,14,452,4.475609756097561

5325503,5,B009GGWWCS,"I have tried several Tai Chi DVD's through the years: David Carradine's had lot of women performing with him and they all were doing their own thing, enough for me to throw it out right away.  Then an excellent one by a doctor American/Oriental, but couldn't understand his accent and difficult to go back to the same area to see the move again.  Then, I tried Ross, which I wasn't sure if I would like it because I only watched his program at the tail end.  WOW, This is definitely an instructional TAI ChI video that you can follow.  The Video is exceptional because:  It details every move and also let you see it all the parts together. Second, and most importantly, It divides each part or move so that you can easily go back to exactly that part.  All these years I have been stucked in the HANDS.  He explained it so easily.  I must say that I have always excelled in sports and as a senior I started learning the piano with no problem in hand coordination.  To sum it all, I needed a good method and a good teacher and Mr. Ross is all of that.  Once, I master these 9 flows I'll be ready for Dr. Oz's teacher, Romain, who adds the breathing.",1371340800,,1149,4.253456221198157
