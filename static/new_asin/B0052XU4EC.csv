8454756,5,B0052XU4EC,"One of the things that I have always admired about the Competing Values framework is its scalability.  It's applicable not only to cultures, company's and departments, but also to people.  In Innovation You, Dr. DeGraff explores the use of the Competing Values Framework on an individual level.
