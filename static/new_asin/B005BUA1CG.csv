4647471,4,B005BUA1CG,"The only reason I won't give 5 stars is because I already have the other two releases from Rhino; all I really needed was the last DVD with the remaining episodes/seasons. Sigh...guess I'll just have to buy the new complete box set. I used to love this series as a kid.

ETA: Received my set 10/13 and only had time to watch a few episodes. Definitely disappointed by the quality as compared to the Rhino sets. I'm still happy to have the whole series though.

My four star rating still stands...and this time based on product quality. Although my I stand behind my 4 star from before...everytime I see this set, I'm slightly bitter I had to buy the whole she-bang just to get the ""last"" season's worth of shows.",1313625600,7,712,4.469230769230769

I am so buying this for my future daughter, and, alright, totally for myself!!!  Jem is Completely Outrageous!  For anyone who hasn't seen Jem, you should defiantely watch an episode and you will be hooked...its about your average girl next door who goes secretly transforms into Jem who is WOW and gorgeous and can sing with her Holograms...love story too because both her girl next door self and her outrageous self is in love with the same guy and he is as well not knowing they are the same girl!  Great music!  I give this 10 out of 10 stars!  I can't wait to watch!!!!!",1313452800,25,702,4.346153846153846

I grew up watching this when I was a kid and even though it was for girls....I still watched it anyway. It was GREAT, probably one of the best theme songs for a cartoon ever!!! 30 yrs. old and still can't wait to see Jem!!! She's truly outrageous!!!",1313366400,27,357,4.264705882352941
4647474,5,B005BUA1CG,"Finally a chance to watch Jem and the Holograms! Anyone who likes to remember their childhood should definately pick up this collection. I put it in the same category as the Original Strawberry Shortcake, He-Man, and Thundercats. The fashion was great, their make-up was so crazy back then but it worked. I still hum the songs and know all the words to most if not all of them. I;m glad they are adding Season 3, that is still a blur but I'm excited to watch and find out just what happens with the Holograms and the Stingers. I bet Rio will be upset no matter what!",1312848000,6,566,4.349056603773585

Now I have a 5 year old daughter is is so into it.  She sings it CONSTANTLY.  Even my 7 year old son loves watching it.  I was waiting to get the first half of Season 3 for Christmas but now that they are releasing the entire series I will be getting that again.  Who cares if I have it twice, I LOVE Jem.  I remember all the songs and just love it, now I don't have to worry about missing it when it comes on the HUB.",1312502400,4,548,3.7130434782608694
4647476,5,B005BUA1CG,"DAMN, everyone beat me to punch. I wanted to the be first person to review this new re-release of Jem and the Holograms.

Anyways, this is a great series and it is such a throw back that it reminds me of Madonna and Culture Club. The 80's had some really great music and Britta's voice (Jem's singing voice) is amazing. The show centers around, Erica Benton, who has just lost her father. He owns a record label, but upon his death, Raymond (I guess co-CEO) assumes control of the company and intends on making 'The Misfits' singing group a rock sensation. Erica receives a gift in the very first episode in the form of red-glittered-ear rings. She soon discovers the power of the ear rings that her father left her. Adventure soon starts and so does addictive pop music. Each episode features three new songs from either Jem, the Misfits, etc.

For some reason, i only found season one to be enjoyable. The other seasons seem to be going out in left field with ideas that just seem so random and just don't jive with me. Initially this was released back in 2006 i believe, but the final box set was never released due to music rights (That's what i heard on the internet blogs), but who knows if that is true. Now it seems another company has brought JEM and will be releasing the series in its entire glory. Despite the fact that the other seasons aren't as exciting as the first, this is still a great series and brings back many fond and warm memories.",1311897600,4,1456,4.449438202247191
4647477,5,B005BUA1CG,"I grew up watching Jem and the Holograms, so much. That I even named my niece Jerrica. I kept watching the show, due to the drama,fashion, and especially the music. I still remember singing ""Like A Dream"" ""Time Is Running Out"" & ""I Got My Eye On You"" Just a few to name. I also love some of the Misfit songs too. I never got around to remembering The Stingers. I guess that's when it got off the air. 3 years ago I had just stumbled on another 80's cartoon that came out on DVD. It reminded me of Jem. So I looked it up here and found them. Unfortunately, the season 3 part 2 wasn't available. But, I still bought the DVD's. I watched them everytime I had a chance, even sang along. But like all DVD's. They got scratched and had to be discarded. When i bought it, it was about $30. Now, it had doubled. So thankfully, I'm happy that they decided to bring back the whole series in one package. It saves me money from buying it individually. Maybe, i will finally see the origins of how the Stingers came along. If you want to skip an episode and get to the ones you miss. Buy this DVD when it comes out. Price may be around the $60 range. but believe me. A piece of my childhood is worth it.",1311811200,10,1191,4.094017094017094

4647494,3,B005BUA1CG,"Despite being an adult when this series originally came out, I have long been a fan of Jem & The Holograms.  I bought the original releases and, like most fans, was rather upset that they did not put out all of the series.

So, when I got the chance to get not only the episodes missing from the original release but the entire series in one package, I jumped at it.

And must admit to some disappointment of what I got.

Though I do like the new 'commercial break' stills they added, the excessive previews of the next episode were a bit off-putting.

I'm sure only a fan who has watched the show enough to almost know the dialog by heart (like me) would notice, but there are bits and pieces missing.  Lines of dialog are the most noticeable but the coloring seems off in several places, too.  Some of the missing lines helped shape characters and situations--such as when Jerrica tells Eric she needs money for Starlight House and he tells her Starlight Music is not a charity and in the same scene, where she first meets the Misfits they cut out her telling them to get their motorcycles out of her father's office.  As soon as they come in, they go straight to the song.  They also cut out two groups in the Battle of the Bands where Jem first shows up--they didn't sing but were mentioned at the end just before Eric announces the Misfits.

This is a problem usually encountered with VHS which is then corrected in the DVD release, such as the original GI Joe mini-series where the flashback of Duke's growing up was missing from the VHS but put back in the DVD.  It may be nit-picking but it's hard to enjoy something when you *know* bits are missing, even if they're considered inconsequential to others.

While I had planned to give my originals to someone once I had the complete series, I'll now be holding on to them and keeping the complete set for those episodes not originally released.  Though I doubt they'll get watched as much as the originals.",1447200000,,1963,4.464985994397759

4647496,3,B005BUA1CG,"So, I LOVE Jem and the holograms. My review has nothing to do with the content of the show, but Shout! Factory's Dvd's.

I purchased this for 20 dollars from Wal-mart(sorry Amazon). As other previously have said, the quality of the pictures are great - Shout did the best they can with the resources that they had available.

BUT

There are none of the PSA's, none of the ""Lin-Z Pierce"" ""encore"" videos, no interviews or Christy Marx with commentaries, and some of the episodes are out of order (Season 3 mostly.) This might not bother some, but this bothers me very much. (nitpicky, but hey. we've all got our ""thing"".) Consider this before you pay for it!",1446595200,,657,4.598290598290598

However, it is only the first season that is ""edited"". After the first season all the shows are the full shows. I didn't see a problem with sound or visual in any of my dvds, and I went through them all to make sure they all work. They seem perfect to me. And for those looking for the added bonus of the Jem Bible, remember you have to actually go to the dvd drive on your computer, open the Jem dvd and you will find the files in there.

The series was a joint collaboration by Hasbro, Marvel Productions and Sunbow Productions, the same team responsible for G.I. Joe and Transformers.

4647662,5,B005BUA1CG,"This show really brings back memories for me. I loved watching it as a child and always liked Jem's songs, they always made me feel good and inspired me to sing myself.

I thought the series really inspired all young people, not just girls. Being a music lover myself, I was inspired by her. My personal favorite episodes are:

Season 1:
Battle of the Bands

Season 2:
Talent Search 1 & 2.

I would recommend this series to any person who grew up in the 80's and to anyone else as well. To put it simply, the headline says it all. But, I'm only one voice, you should  buy it and decide for yourself.

In any case, personally, I think Jem ROCKS!",1370736000,4,644,4.237704918032787

4647666,4,B005BUA1CG,"Jem finally gets its second American DVD release and this time with all 65 episodes! But, why is the show different visually, aurally and in total content from what was previously available? It all comes down to the fact the two companies used different masters for their release.

Jem was broadcast and released in many markets and formats thereby creating variations of the show. The first handful of episodes of Jem is where the editing process is most evident. The five beginning episodes as they are known now actually began as shorter separate segments, before then being edited together and also ordered extended. Shout Factory used 1"" analog tape masters. Tape was what was the broadcast product was recorded on. The disadvantage though is that analog tape along with being rather susceptible to degrading over time even when stored correctly is a copy itself (albeit complete). This is why the different picture quality, which except in certain cases is tolerable if not decent, as well as some audio issues is present in the Shout Factory release. However, Shout still has a certain professional quality threshold to maintain and an apposite master of the extended first episode wasn't to be found. Correspondingly their tape masters, while being possibly the closest one can get to the experience of Jem in the 80s decades later, also do not benefit from all of the corrections that were made to the show at various points. An example is instances of Jem's outfit being wrong in Starbright Part 1 (which incidentally the Starbright episodes have a lot of retakes).

However, this is not to say that the previous Rhino release has 100% of the best cuts of everything either. Not to mention in the demanding process of re-mastering their 35mm film material Rhino also ended up making some mistakes (Pizzazz's hair color). What this more technical side of things amount to basically is complication for fans. The question of superiority of one release over the other is not easily answered because the knife cuts both ways. This is clear in the episode Music Is Magic. It looks much better from Rhino than Shout's where the dark tint appears (and quite harshly at points) but, Shout's version has a correction thereby fixing a scene where one character's mouth is moving when another is suppose to be speaking. Offhand I can think of three other instances of wrong footage Rhino used that Shout has corrected takes for also.

Still the Shout Factory version of similar previously released episodes did not overwhelm me in terms of content except rarely (Jem Jam Part 1 and 2). The most memorable episodes from when I was a kid are the extended versions and Starbright. There was some obvious visual damage to the source material at the end of a short scene in Kimber's Rebellion. The World Hunger Shindig looks a lot better in Rhino despite having different footage in several places. Also Alone Again, a strong message episode which has only grown in importance over the years, suffers perhaps the worst in places most sadly with unsatisfactory picture quality in the opening and even dropping out at one point during the beautiful first song. Obviously I don't think comparing legitimate Jem products to form an opinion is missing the point of this release at all.

Perhaps the most important thing to keep in mind is that Jem and the Holograms is an old canceled cartoon series with a doll line that was never even sold on VHS in its entirety. That Shout Factory managed to finally release all the episodes of Jem and the Holograms in 2011 (with PSAs, they're there honest!) seems pretty amazing in the first place. Though, Shout Factory entraps a fan like me by putting the great extras disc only in the box set. If you are a serious fan or even want to just relive some childhood memories the extra disc is a must have for the TV commercials and behind the scenes goodies! Otherwise I would have only purchased the separate releases of Season 2 and 3 to complete what Rhino put out.",1363910400,7,3995,4.810771470160116

4647692,5,B005BUA1CG,"So this comes in beautiful eye catching, sparkly packaging. (in true 1980's fashion!) I loved Jem as a kid, and I was so afraid that the appeal would have worn off as an adult...luckily it didn't. The music is still catchy and fun and I'm incredibly surprised in this pop machine of a disneyized era we live in, that they haven't remade this show with a disney teen (think selena gomez, demi lovato etc) My point is, this show works almost as well now as it did then, if they were to syndicate Jem now, I wouldn't be at all surprised to see little girls of today fall in love with it! Sure a little bit of the technology would be foreign to them (what the heck is an LP mom? Why is that phone so big and what's that weird curly thing on it?) but nevertheless I'd love to see this back on the air. As it stands, this box set is fabulous, and would be great for anyone who wants to relive their Jem years, or maybe introduce it to their daughter, and or sons, it's the 2000's right! I especially love that you can opt to watch just the ""music videos"" on the dvd's, thus being able to enjoy the music only if you don't have time for a full episode but really want a Jem fix. All in all, this is truly ""totally outrageous"" , and like soooooo worth your time and dough! Like totally!",1348790400,4,1278,4.136546184738956

The storyline is great and the animation isn't bad either. I love having all of the episodes together. This set comes with every episode and even bonus features.

4647696,5,B005BUA1CG,"After catching this unbelievable hit show from the 1980's, I just had to go back to it, having collected all the toys and tapes and stuff (you remember the free music casettes that came with the dolls...right?). Jem & the Holograms by Toei tells the magical story of young Jerrica Benton, who becomes the owner of 'Starlight Music'. The company comes down to her with an added bonus - Synergy, who is able to provide sets, costumes...anything girls need for their shows as 'Jem & the Holograms' using holographic technology. The Misfits are there to challenge Jem - New Wave? Post Punk? Hell, I'm not sure, but they sing as well.
PACKAGING 7/10
It's a glittery job which kinda emulates the original look of the brand...although the artwork for the toys was amazing, it could have come with postcards or something. The DVD cases (of which there are 3 packed with disks) have that silky 'My Little Pony' feel, dripping with shades of pink. How about a 'Misfits' edition..?
ANIMATION 9/10
High standard, is this anime? Jem moves like a dream. The holographic wonder system has to be every pop star's dream, the colourful characters are designed for gals...you might find yourself skipping some ep's to look for your favourite song by Jem or the Misfits. Nothing has been left out - THOSE incredible earrings, hundreds of animated - somewhat cheesy - song videos, lots of locations, hairstyles and costumes etc...all the things I remember from the original run. The story's always great too.
MUSIC 8/10
From the classic intro to the end, the music is funky and helps the viewer come away from the show wanting more. The songs are great too, sung in cute voices, although I believe they're not by the original voice actors. This show's all about the music, don't confuse Jem with Jem Griffiths!",1341792000,3,1789,4.792880258899676

Well packaged and the disc is setup so you can watch all episodes that are on one disc continuously.  Have a great time with this nostalgic childhood guilty pleasure!",1341619200,,405,4.569444444444445
4647698,4,B005BUA1CG,"This is a wonderfully assembled box set featuring my favorite cartoon series from when I was a kid. It brings back all the memories and then some--I am amazed at a cartoon that can make you truly invested in the characters, even the villains, who were given three dimensional backgrounds. Of course, it is an 80s cartoon, and writing quality varies from episode to episode, but I am having a tremendously fun ride down memory lane watching these. And the music is amazing, truly outrageous even. Half the songs could probably be easily remixed into pop hits today and no one would notice, likely.

The DVD set is well packaged in a nice boxset with sturdy cases and lovely sparkly artwork. Each DVD features all the episodes from the series and a ""video jukebox"" of all the music videos in order as they appeared on the episodes. The episodes are as originally aired, and one should note that the first several episodes (the introductory multi-part story) are as they FIRST aired on the Super Saturday/Sunday series, when the episodes needed to be shorter. Later the production team expanded these episodes with some re-edited and added scenes so they filled a half hour (including commercials), but Shout Factory was not able to get the expanded episodes, only the shorter, very original ones. But it is important to note that Shout Factory did not edit or abridge anything, unlike the claims of other reviewers; the first several episodes were originally shorter to begin with.

The video quality is not high, but that's what happen when you're working with transferring from old videotape--I'm sure Shout Factory did the best they could with what they had. The colors and titles are correct, however, albeit there are some episodes which seem to go a bit bluish/purplish (likely a flaw in the original tapes themselves). They look pretty much as they did, I imagine, as aired in the 1980s, it just looks worse on our 21st century hi def televisions, unfortunately. Those who insist on absolutely hi def quality will be disappointed, but I can't see how they could have done any better with the resources at their disposal.

Sound is solid, though there are some chokes and echoes on rare occasion. The earliest episodes seem to have some varying volume issues (dialogue gets quiet, background music gets loud, commercial bumpers are really loud) which may be more or less apparent depending on your sound system.

The set also comes with a bonus disc with an interview with several of the cast and crew. They also have fan interviews, the doll commercials, and, my personal favorite, select story boards from a few scenes and music videos. The bonus disc is also a DVD-ROM containing the writer's bible, identity kit from Hasbro, and doll catalog. This is a lovely wealth of information, but I wish there had been even more. In particular, some episode commentary from the writers would have been nice, and I wish they had interviewed more cast of the members and singers who are still with us. I understand there are issues with both budgeting and availability of the persons in question, but given this is largely unlikely to come around again, it would have been nice to see. An image gallery would also be nice, especially given how colorful the designs for the show were.

Nonetheless there is loads of content and a lovingly assembled collection altogether. If you loved this show when you were younger or want to collect all that defines the 80s, this is definitely worth it.",1341446400,3,3485,4.830820770519263

JEM is just about everything I remember the 80s to be ; loud, flashy, and colorful. The storylines can get quite intense, especially for 80s cartoons. But it's a lot of fun. Cheesy 80s fun, which is right up my alley. The story has been recounted a million times in other reviews, so I won't talk about that here. I'll just stick to the dvd quality. The picture is especially good for an 80s cartoon, though a bit fuzzy at times. The masters used for the episodes are the broadcast masters. The colours may be a bit more muted than some people have seen, but the brighter, sharper versions were unfinished masters used by the previous company, Rhino. These are by far the better copies as they are what was shown on tv. The audio is pretty good for the age of the show, though a few episodes have a strange echo on the opening credits and the ""be right back"" interstitals.

I read the reviews that others posted, and I agree with the 2-3 star ratings that this DVD was given. Don't misunderstand - there is nothing wrong with the Jem series. Its great that all of the episodes are available, especially the second half of season 3. But obviously a lot was lost in translation. The translation (in terms of sound and visuals -  not language) is poor at times. Sometimes the sound is unreliable. In other words, the music playing during the dialogue almost drowns out the character voices. The first video that Jem did is shortened (why?) and there are VCR lines running through some of the episodes. I am not a fan of Rhino, but even I see the extreme quality difference between their work and Shouts work. Shout's colors are washed out and not very clear and crisp. And on some episodes the opening Jem song (Glamor and Glitter, Fashion and Fame) does not have Jem and the Holograms singing - sometimes it's just the music! Even an old cartoon like Jem can be restored better than this, especially with the digital enhancements available today. It has the feel of being put quickly together to make a quick buck. Again, my complaints are not against the show itself but in the work that was done with it. The cartoon is great but the work done with this series is NOT.",1333065600,6,1390,4.387596899224806

After ordering this, I saved it for Christmas last year. But then I started reading reviews online of people being extremely disappointed by the video quality. I got pretty worried. But when I finally opened my set on Christmas day, and spent a large part of the day watching all my favorite Stingers episodes, I was totally relieved.

As someone who had previously been watching episodes taped from TV on VHS tapes, these DVDs were a godsend. They look the same as when they originally aired. I don't see any issue with quality and I don't really see the need for remastering. The visuals and sound are beautiful.

The DVDs also include a lot of great extras. The cast interviews were especially interesting; it was really surprising to find out how many other cartoons the cast had worked on (Eric Raymond was the original Buster Bunny?!), but it was also very sad to hear how many of the voice actors (Kimber/Aja, Raya) have passed away... There are some commercials for the dolls, which really bring back memories! The ""Jem Bible"" is pretty disappointing. It seems to be an early version and it's very short.

4647711,5,B005BUA1CG,"There is no way to speak ill of Jem and the Holograms. It was a sensation, a religion, pop culture icon. The series set does not disappoint. It isn't remastered, so don't expect it to look or sound like anything other than what it was in the 80s. A complete blast from the past. Jem came out the year I was born, 1984. It had it's original run and then came back for another round, which is when I was able to watch in the late 80s. Jem is a separate entity from Barbies - sure, the concept was there to let girls know a woman can do it all. However, Barbie was still what a perfect woman was expected to be. Jem showed girls that we can really do anything. With glamour, fashion, fame, music, love, friendship - it surpassed everything of its time.

Each disk has a Jem and the Holograms jukebox. Sing along to all of your favorite songs! You'd also be surprised to know that as soon as you hit play on the first episode, it's like being a little kid again. It says something about the Jem generation, how powerful and influential it was, when you have to stand up and sing and dance along to the opening. You'll remember every word of every song. I have always loved Jem since the first time I laid eyes on the series at a young 3years old. My mother wrote down the lyrics to every song and my father played them on the guitar so I can sing to it. Because of Jem, I had a love for music and a need to be a rockstar like her!

The characters of Jem are so relatable. All walks of life are part of the series. There's excitement, there's sadness, the tears that fell from eyes are very real. Rewatching the entire series in just a few days had the same effect on me today as they did over 20 years ago. And to have a 65 episode cartoon series have such a deep impact on a little girl into adulthood proves how relevant this series was and still is.

No amount of money can be too much, in my opinion. Though the pricetag is indeed excellent for the product you get. It's like pulling memories out of your head and watching them unfold on TV. The special features are beautiful. The heart that the cast, creators, and writers all have for the series make you realize that the love you have for the series means just as much to them. It's sad the contract ended after 65 episodes, I was so sad all over again when I watched the final episode yesterday.

If you want the TRUE, complete, original episodes, but the older DVDs which are sold on Amazon as Seasons 1 & 2 and Season 3 Part one.  True, you won't have all of season 3, but at least you'll get the others as you once watched them when you were a kid!

But then I watched the first episode and SO much was left out! It seems as though these DVDs try to shorten each episode and leave out the proper plot. I can't tell you how disappointed I was to see that. :( Each scene is shortened and doesn't seem to connect. Watch the first episode on YouTube and compare it to the one on the DVD and you will see what I mean.

Even little details like the Rockin' Roadster being GREEN in this series when Synergy presents it to them instead of yellow and pink, like we all know it is.

The biggest disappointment is that the SONGS are SHORTENED! I think a lot of us love Jem for the songs, and this DVD set just cuts them short!!!!!!!! Horrible!!!

If you don't care that the episodes and songs are shortened, then you may like this series.. but for TRUE JEM FANS - You will be VERY disappointed.

4647721,5,B005BUA1CG,"I'm a 34 year old man and I still to this day LOVE the Jem cartoon series. It isn't just a cartoon for girls about glamour and fashion. There's also alot of action and adventure to keep guys interested. Plus, its one of the few shows that cover a behind the scenes look at the music business. You get a glimpse into what it would be like to not only be a rock star but also the financial responsibilities of how it all happens. Its basically a cartoon soap opera that was intended for children because it was to promote a toy doll line but it really does a great job of also appealing to adults. There's a love triangle, multiple personalities, car chases, kidnappings, and even serious storylines about teen runaways and teen drug abuse, but they are also told in a careful way that will teach young kids how to handle those tough situations and eventually do the right thing. Even the issue of ""death"" is dealt with as the Jem series begins because the main character Jem/Jerrica is dealing with the loss of her father at a young adult age presumably in her early 20s. There aren't too many cartoon series made for kids these days that teach moral lessons with every episode so Jem is a golden opportunity for you parents out there to have a SAFE program to show your children and not only keep them entertained but also learn a few life lessons as well and to grow up being a good responsible person. And when they do show these moral dilemmas, its not done in a cheesy way or ""in your face"". Anyways, this is a really fun show with great songs that any generation can enjoy. I will add one small note to collectors, don't get rid of your first dvd collection from the 2004 Rhino release. The first five episodes here do not have the extended song mixes nor the extra scenes (e.g. Jerrica talking to the security guard at Starlight Music and running to the elevator in the first episode prior to seeing Eric's new trampy secretary is not on this set). However I did see that they do include the ""slap"" Eric gives Jerrica at the very end of episode 5. Its still a beautiful set. I love the box and the artwork on all 3 seasons. Fantastic set for any collector. Plus, the bonus disc with interviews of fans, cast members and writers is worth a look.",1324944000,7,2250,4.372315035799523

The show is actually pretty complex and smart, with a few silly episodes here and there though. I love that Jem and the Holograms work hard for success, while the Misfits are pretty entertaining as well. Jem and the Holograms are fun and great role models for little girls. Although Rio seems to pretty much cheat on Jerrica with Jem (who is the same person), ha. I wish that storyline got a little more fleshed out though.

I hope the show becomes revived at some point for a new generation. They could even take the GLEE route and sell longer versions of the songs on iTunes.

4647727,3,B005BUA1CG,"I am thankful that this set was brought out on DVD and I am thankful to be able to watch it. I agree with others that the sound is average to very poor in some circumstances. There are many episodes where the opening title intro is either hard to hear, has an echo sound or is out of sync with the action depicted on screen. Of course, technology was not as advanced as today and I'm sure the creators did not produce the show with the thought of having the episodes sold on digital media someday.

A major part of the show I did not remember was the plot lines and the character development. There needs to be more than one antagonist besides The Misfits/Eric Raymond. It is the same plot over and over. The Misfits/Eric Raymond just happen to be in Japan at the same time as Jem and the Holograms or The Misfits just happen to own the ski report just down the hill from the ski resort Jem is staying at or The Misfits just happen to have Jem's photo shoot schedule. Granted, the plots were not supposed to be sophisticated in design, but the episodes got repetitive very quickly.

A good show and a historic part of 80's TV, but this does not stand out from a plot and quality standpoint as compared to other cartoons of the 80's.",1323216000,4,1232,4.283261802575107

One thing I loved about this release is that unlike Rhino they didn't mix the two versions of the theme song with the episodes. Instead, they kept the theme's to the way they were released originally. Although I have noticed that a couple of episodes are missing the singing on the theme song and just have the muxic.

4647734,5,B005BUA1CG,"I have been a fan of Jem since 1986 at the age of 13.  By the time I was out of 7th grade, I had almost all the episodes recorded on VHS.  I memorized stories, characters and even songs.  I have kept these video tapes for 25 years and have been showing them to my own children, who get great enjoyment out of them.  I received the new DVDs in perfect condition, wrapped and sealed.  The discs were also perfect and played easily.  The picture and sound quality are wonderful and I'm happy that I have each and every episode in the series!

The only unfortunate realization is that this re-release of the series no longer includes the original interviews with the actors, as the first two releases did.  I've seen pirated versions on YouTube, but I was really looking forward to watching the interviews myself.  However, they aren't there.  There are some interviews, but none of them are truly in depth.  The juke box feature at the end of each disc only contains a few of the songs, not every one.  But, my solace is that every song is within the episodes, so it's all good.

The absolute best part is that I have it hidden in my closet and plan to give it to my daughter for her birthday--on New Year's Day!!  :)  She loves this series and I'm very happy that it was re-released as a single box set for yet another generation of children to enjoy.

4647735,5,B005BUA1CG,"Jem and the Holograms was one of my favorite shows as a kid, I was so happy to be able to buy the whole collection.  I'm not sure why there would be complaints about the color, not only does the DVD color surpass the faded out version being shown on cable, but it also matches what I remember from childhood.  Believe me, when I saw them on cable I knew the color was off.  The color complaint was posted before the DVD set was even shipping so take it with a grain of salt.

Season One of Jem was its most complex; lots of two part episodes and intricate stories that carried throughout the year.  It was also the most over the top season.  I found myself wondering how the Misfits had time for their own careers if they wasted so much energy tormenting Jem.  Their actions in this season were truly criminal.  Their manager, Eric Raymond, taught me (as a child) the meaning of the word smarmy with his open shirt, medallion and menacing personality.  In the bonus DVD they explain that Jem was sandwiched between 2 boys' shows so they added lots of action to keep the boys from changing the channel so their sisters had a chance to watch.

This was also the season that really dealt with the Jerrica/Rio/Jem triangle.  Rio was attracted to Jem and seemed to know he had to hide it (not so in other seasons) and Jerrica, who knew what her guy was up to, was rightly put out that he was basically cheating.  Rio this season was very angry, pretty much one rant away from being and After School Special, but his anger issues were never explored.  The guy was a crappy boyfriend, I see as an adult, funny how I didn't see it as a kid.  Emotionally cheating, yelling, not a good guy.

The Holograms have little to say or do.  Shaina rarely says a word, Aja only has a few more.  Kimber only opens her mouth to say ""outrageous"" and she says EVERY episode.  It gets annoying.

If you want to get nitpicky, this season had a lot of animation errors where the wrong outfit would appear for a second.  They also never explain how Emmett Bention, recording mogul, didn't know his daughter could sing that way.  Jem is just a hologram, it's Jerrica doing the singing.  No wonder Starlight Music was always in dire financial straights.

Season Two is the one I remember the most, but it was clear the network stuck their noses in.  There were very few two parters, and most episodes were stand-alones, so that anyone could pick up the show and get into it.  Yes it would allow for a wider audience, but it hurt the overall story telling.  The bonus DVD also says that the writers were told to reuse songs this year, which is why they don't fit as nicely into what's going on as they did in season one.  The main title song was changed for almost all the episodes, which is a shame when you hear how much work went into matching the original song to the cartoons' actions in the opening sequence.

The Misfits are tamed down a lot, I guess with Jem on its own now, they no longer wanted to attract the boys, or else the network realized the ""bad"" girls were really too bad for little kids.  Eric loses his medallion, gains a tie and collar button.  He is less menacing and employs a tech guy to harass Jem/Jerrica instead of thugs.  He is often the butt of the Misfits' pranks, taking more of the fear element away from him.

Also toned down this season is the love triangle.  Rio is barely in the show and Jerrica's jealousy isn't really dealt with.  Interesting is that Rio, who tried to hide his attraction to Jem before, is fine with snuggling with and kissing her in front of Jerrica's friends and her SISTER.  I know the Holograms know the truth, but why would Rio do that in front of them and isn't he wondering why Kimber hasn't decked him?

The Holograms step out of the shadows more this year.  Aja doesn't have much to do and newbie Raya really is just along for the ride, but Shaina and Kimber have more stories.  The New Orleans one about Shaina was always a favorite of mine.  Kimber on the other hand...she makes you long for the days when all she said was ""outrageous"".  They chose to show she was Jerrica's slightly younger sister by having her cry, shout and storm around like a hormonal teenager.  Then backed it up by creating Jerrica's third personality, one I call Jerk-ica, who is a 50 year old stereotypical parent (do as I say, I know best, you're too young) who looks like a 20-something.  I actually hated Jerrica in those scenes, even though Kimber was being a brat.

However, Kimber also embarked on a story I still love.  She had a love triangle with actor/singer Sean and stunt man Jeff.  I remember being on the edge of my seat wondering who she would pick.  I also remember loving her wedding gown, and when I saw it again as an adult I still loved it.  I didn't realize how short this story was, I remembered it lasting for more than one episode, but the choice and the wedding are all in one 30 minute story.

The most powerful story this season was that of the Benton sister's mother, Jaqui Benton, life and death.  It was a very sad, moving story to tell in a children's cartoon.  It's probably also why I always think the plane I'm on is going to crash.  I suspect Jaqui's singing voice is provided by the woman who does Jem's speaking voice, as she is a singer.  Listen closely and see what you think.

The flubs this season:  Kimber tells Sean he's holding up her sister's movie career.  Jem isn't Kimber's sister, Jerrica is.  It's Jem in the movie with Sean, he should have been questioning that.  Also, when Kimber and Stormer sing together, you can't tell their voices apart (I think they used the same vocalist) and the singing voices really don't fit with their speaking voices, which is disappointing since Jem and Pizazz really match theirs.

Season Three, the final year.  With sales of Jem dolls not able to beat Barbie, this season came to a screeching halt halfway through.  It got more of an ending than most non-cartoon shows do, but a lot was left hanging.  But let's start at the beginning...

This season they introduced new musical group The Stingers.  Watching their theme song be performed, I laughed at how ridiculous it was.  From the lyrics to the little finger points Riot was doing, it was just bad.  I remember thinking Riot was great as a kid, but as an adult I find him unpalatably arrogant.  And, children watching these for the first time who don't know what 80s hair bands wore, are going to wonder why Riot is battling Rio for Jem and not the other way around.

It is clear from the new tags for commercial breaks that this season was supposed to be about Rio/Jem/Riot.  The writers finally figured out that even little girls didn't want to think about their guy leaving them for a more glamorous woman while her friends and sister stood around saying nothing.  Yes, Jerrica's jealousy did crop up again this year, but Riot spent a lot of time chasing Jem and it was refreshing.

Also fun was seeing Pizazz really fall for someone and make an idiot of herself trying to get his love.  But that was really all the Misfits had to do this season, most of the non-Jem parts went to the Stingers, who we never had time to really get to know.  Why were Minx and Rapture so mean?  And why did Minx's accent vary from British, to Slavic to What-in-the-hell?

I no sooner got into the season and it was over.  The end comes rather abruptly in the episode A Father Should Be.  Banee's quest to find her father (a story I was stunned only spanned 3 episodes, I remember it being a huge story in the series) comes to a happy close with her finding him.  At her going away party, the Stingers are there because Riot's connections helped find him and the Misfits inexplicably show up to ask for a truce.  Of course Jem says yes.  All three bands break into a farewell song and the last image is of Jem at the door of Starlight house waving good-bye to Banee and her fans.

Even as a kid I knew that was the end without being told it was cancelled.  But you never see Rio learn the truth or find out what happens with Riot's pursuit of Jem.

Bonus materials:

The commercials aren't really much to watch.  There's a reason fast forward was invented.

The fan interviews I expected to be with famous people who were inspired by Jem, or regular people showing massive doll collections, but they are just a bunch of unknowns not saying much of anything.

The cast/crew interviews are a bit more interesting, but I was hoping for some big insight of where season 3 would have gone and it's not there.  It's funny how the actress who did the speaking voice of Jem/Jerrica starts out sounding not much like her, occasionally lapses into a British accent, but by the end is in full Jem mode.  Talk about show boating.

I can't get the special features for the computer to play on mine, so I can't comment on them.

All in all, this set is well worth buying if you loved Jem as a kid.",1321747200,4,8921,4.395235186316432

Big hair and all that sort of thing?  Have to watch the extras maybe to find out.  Anyway, not really sure why people seem to bewail about the quality, I am sure it wasn't so great back on an 80's tv anyway, I might have even watched it on a little black and white tv for all I know,  but we all loved and adored it then and it has not lost it's charm.

  My biggest disappointment here was the sound quality. Initial marketing for this release stated it would have both a 5.1 or the optional 2.0 sound. Sadly the final product only has a 2.0. (The above fore mentioned Rhino set had 5.1). Alot of echoing throughout and just didn't sound good.
  The picture quality was OK, but again substandard to its predecessor. I agree with the review before, it reminds me of a cable network broadcast. Alot of faded colors here and there.
  If you are looking to complete the series on DVD, I would strongly urge you to wait and just purchase the third season when it comes out individually.",1320883200,6,841,4.5364238410596025
4647742,5,B005BUA1CG,"This a great set to buy, own, and watch! I just bought the series for my fiancee' who used to watch it as a kid for her birthday, but we already cut into it started watching them at 2 in the morning! The box outer box design is great, the 3 inner-hard plastic boxes are sturdy and graphic! Each CD is also colorfully graphic and the graphics of the cartoons themselves look great!
This collection has clear sound and is an overall buyer! I'm not at all any kind of marketer for or against this series,simply one highly satisfied customer. I highly recommend it for those who love and appreciate the best of best cartoons available that are worth watching and collecting. This cartoon has a really intriguing plot and is really enjoyable for any audience. This whole review is coming from a 100% heterosexual man who loves to watch and collect only truly great and worthwhile entertainment.
The price I payed at Amazon is the best I found anywhere where this set is sold ($57.99, no tax, no shipping,and delivered right to your home!).No boot leg, no imperfections, no hassles, speedy delivery; just like an avid collector like myself and my fiancee' always hope for.

4647743,4,B005BUA1CG,"I was always a fan of Jem and the Holograms. I missed the opportunity to buy the series on DVD the first time it was released. I'm glad it was released again and with some interesting extras. I think the series itself is one of the most well written, acted,and  animated series ever made,especially in America. Christy Marx and Roger Slifer deserve high praise for their great, creative work on the show along with the animation teams and all the other people working behind the scenes. The voice actors were very convincing in their roles. The best episodes in my opinion are the introductory episodes,followed by ""The Jazz Player"", ""Out of the Past"",""Homeland Heartland"", ""Danse Time"",""The Talent Search"" ,""Riot's Hope"", and ""Video Wars"". The most interesting characters in the show in my opinion are Stormer,Aja,Danse,Riot, Shana, and Raya. Stormer, is the most talented member of the Misfits and is with them mostly due to a lack of confidence in herself. Stormer often helps the Holograms and Starlight girls when Eric Raymond and the Misfits have done something obviously evil. Aja, is the tough,tomboy of the Holograms which certainly plays against stereotypical depictions of Asian female characters but she never really gets enough screen time. Danse(a Slavic-American dancer) actually gets to be the main character in two of the best episodes of the series which deal with disabilities,lost parents,and immigration in a sensitive, intelligent manner. Shana and Raya are interesting characters as well but like Aja get put on the back burner frequently which makes it hard for them to move beyond being considered ""token characters"". Although both characters do work against stereotypes of African-American and Mexican women by not being loud or overtly sexual. Riot is a cool character too, he pushes gender boundaries with his flamboyant style, and becomes who he is because of his abusive army officer father. Few cartoons ever dared to move in this direction. Jem/Jerrica herself is interesting in that she is often very conflicted about her secret identity. What I found odd was that as Jem she romances Rio,she's never strictly business with him, so she shouldn't have been surprised that he fell in love with her as Jem. As for the extras on the DVD they are pretty good except the Jem fans extra, it was a complete waste of time except for the male Jem fan. The female fans they interviewed had absolutely nothing deep or insightful to say about the series which was so interesting. They should have left these people out, it comes across as filler on an otherwise fantastic dvd collection. I think what goes unsaid here is that Jem fans are from all walks of life(rich,poor,female, male,Black,Hispanic,European,queer, straight, people with disabilities, people who lost a parent,etc,)The interviews with the shows creator and production team are the best of the extras. I recommend this set to fans and even casual viewers-a great show for all ages and most people.",1320710400,4,2983,5.087755102040816

4647749,5,B005BUA1CG,"The great Marvel/Sunbow cartoon shows of the '80s have had a rough time on DVD. The Rhino DVDs (save for a couple of single-disc releases of The Transformers and The Inhumanoids) were rife with incorrect footage and digitally altered footage, as well as a bit of censorship in one episode of G.I. Joe. And Jem and G.I. Joe didn't even rate full releases before Rhino lost the home video rights. Shout! factory then promised to fix things, but The Transformers still has many, many errors, and G.I. Joe was unchanged from the partial Rhino release (and there were even more things wrong with the episodes new to DVD).

Now, we have Jem. As with the recent reruns on The Hub, Shout! Factory has completely discarded the Rhino DVD masters and gone back to the old 1"" broadcast masters. This works even better for Jem, because in addition to re-take issues, the Rhino Jem DVDs had horrific color timing, with Pizzazz's hair being a dull pea green instead of the loud neon green seen originally, and on the doll itself. However, three episodes (""The Beginning"", and the first two episodes of Starbright) use versions of the episodes from earlier airings, so there are some extended scenes missing. Most likely, it's because the masters for the final versions of those episodes have the much-reviled ""Jem Girls"" opening instead of the original version of the theme song. Additionally, the opening and end credits for one episode, ""Alone Again"", look terrible, and there is dropout of the picture in one shot during the first song. These issues could have been quickly fixed, and are easily the biggest negative features of the whole set.

The sound is a stereoized version of the original mono, which has none of the issues the 5.1 track on the Rhino releases had, such as out-of-sync audio on some songs, and faulty audio at the start of Starbright Part 3. However, as aired on The Hub, certain episodes in the ""Season One"" portion of this set have instrumental openings and/or end credits, and this has been fixed on this set, but rather oddly, as the lyrics are hard to hear, with an echo chamber-like sound to them. Not a deal-breaker to be certain, but still a bit odd.

The special features are, to use the obvious pun, outrageous! The making-of documentaries feature a very good assortment of people who worked on the show, and hearty acknowledgments to everyone not present (including, sadly, the cast members who are deceased). There's a good number of commercials, which oddly do not feature the faces of the girls in them blurred out, as was the case with the Transformers and G.I. Joe sets. But the true treasure trove is in the DVD ROM material, which includes the bible, catalogs, and even storyboards. The only possible failing of the special features is that the fan documentary features only one male fan.

So, should you buy this set? YES! While the Rhino set had some nice episode commentaries which are sadly not included here, everything else is an upgrade. (Besides, if you're only looking to buy episodes not on the Rhino sets, you'll need two of the three season sets anyways.)",1319155200,31,3095,4.779439252336449

I have been wanting to see the episodes with the Stingers (my favorites being Riot's Hope and A Father Should Be) and the episode where Jerrica and the others learn about her father's work through his journal. I have checked on the quality and I agree with a previous poster about it. Some of the quality has been lost a little bit, but as long as I can finally see those episodes, I'm a happy camper.

If you have never seen Jem and The Holograms before, it is a girl show about a group of friends who sing, design clothes, and just have fun together.  Now since there has to be an enemy, there are The Misfits and The Stingers who are always trying to steal from Jem and her friends.  Oh and did I mention that Jem has a dual personality where she turns from Jerrica to Jem through using the power of Synergy!  Yes she touches her magical earrings and voilah she is a pop star!

My party was canceled but my dad came through and bought me Jem and her rocker stage (at least I think it was her stage!

4647758,4,B005BUA1CG,"GRATEFUL PRAISE for BRIAN WARD and Shout Factory!!

I URGE EVERYONE with questions, concerns, and complaints about as well as praise for the Jem complete series set to visit the ""Truly Outrageous World of Jem"" KJEM online radio show website at [...]

Show hosts Craig and Amy welcomed Shout Factory producer Brian Ward for a lengthy and GRATEFUL interview about the creation of the Jem set a couple of nights ago. You can listen to Part 1 of this great interview by selecting it from the past shows list. All your questions will be answered by listening to this show. I'm sure Part 2 will be posted soon. As an original fan of Jem since '87, I teared up just listening to Brian's stories of the Jem project and the pride he took in producing it.

I received my dvd set the day of release from Amazon. I love the packaging (especially the iconic cover image) and the special features. The set is well-organized and colorfully worthy of the world of Jem. I am particularly pleased with the video jukebox as it plays the videos seamlessly with quick fade ins and outs rather than the glitchy way the Rhino set played them via search for chapters. AND the special feature documentaries are fantastic tributes to Jem.

As an owner of the Rhino sets, I admit I was surprised and a little disappointed at the obvious difference in quality of the Shout set. It's NOT bad but is different as it came from video masters rather than film as Brian explained. The colors sometimes appear either overexposed or faded and the image is often slightly blurred.
Eagerly searching for answers regarding the quality, I discovered a thread about the Jem set on Shout Factory's message board ([...]) and read every posting last night. While finding answers, I was so impressed at how much care Brian took in responding to all the fans as he worked on the Jem project for months. I was not pleased with some of the rude comments fans made. Upon listening to the KJEM show after reading all these posts, I understood that Brian and Shout did the best they could with the material they had. I am truly grateful. The set is complete and was obviously done with a lot of care by a producer and company eager to please fans.

What Shout brought us is far superior in packaging and presentation than any of the bootlegs available of the episodes missing from the Rhino sets. Everyone should be very grateful.

K. from Alabama

p.s.  regarding the two Jem theme songs: As a viewer of JEM during its original broadcast, I can confirm that the ""Jem Girl"" theme began with the premiere of the ""Talent Search"" episode when Jem went weekdays in the fall of '87 and remainedfor all episodes (including seasons 1 and 2  through the end of the show's initial run. The ""Jem Girl"" theme was simultaneously being used for the doll commercials until their demise as well.  When JEM returned to TV on the USA nextwork, all the episodes but a couple kept the ""Jem Girl"" theme.",1318464000,20,2932,4.57824427480916
4647759,5,B005BUA1CG,"Immediately I received my set, I started watching the featurettes and extras. I love all the brand new material SHOUT produced! Especially the interviews with people involved with the production from whom I hadn't heard before like Barry Harmon. And the fan testimonials were great--I love that we saw a wide range of people, and how clearly their love for the material and the property comes through.

I'm continually amazed at how well the show stands up--not just the writing (with folks like Christy Marx, Marv Wolfman, Buzz Dicon, Greg Weisman, Mary Skrenes, etc. that really wasn't a surprise), but also the animation and effects. Every once in a while I'd break out my favourite episodes to show friends, and I always worry that I was perhaps blinded by my childhood love and nostalgia. But nope--it's just good solid action/adventure series with strong relationships among the characters, and huge fun to watch no matter in which decade you were born :)

I have to give a HUGE shout out to the art directors and illustrators as well. I love the packaging design by Karrie Stouffer, and Eamon O'Donoghue's illustrations just blew me away. From the sparkly set sleeve to the rendering of Synergy on the insert cards, I am so impressed with the attention to detail. I especially love the DVD labels as records, and the palm tree vector art!

The extra that meant the most to me as a fangirl, however, was the inclusion of the Hasbro toy licensing kit on the DVD_ROM. I was lucky enough to get a copy of the JEM series bible years ago, but I'd never been able to see the gorgeous character artwork by Sharon Knettell in such detail before. It's so amazing for fans to have access to that material so the entire JEM community can appreciate it for the first time, rather than just a tiny handful of collectors!

HUGE props to Shout! Factory, and thanks to all the fans who opened up their JEM collections to share such great extras with other fans!",1318291200,6,1951,4.679300291545189
4647760,4,B005BUA1CG,"Like others who've reviewed this wonderful 1980's cartoon, and perhaps as one of the few Black men who admits to love this series, I'm truly grateful to Shout! Factory for releasing this series in its entirety. I applaud the cast and crew for making Jem and the Holograms withstand time with its messages that speak (without overkill) about the beauty of the human spirit. I especially appreciate the special features included in this release.

There are some critiques I make about the release:
1. Video Quality: The Rhino release preserved the original broadcast quality of the series. However, the Shout! release seems to be darker and of lower quality. I don't know if this is perhaps the Masters degenerated during the change in license from Rhino to Shout! Factory. Nevertheless, I wish more of the episodes were restored to their original quality.
2. When I watched the first episode of the series, I noticed that the first act was edited. Again, I wonder if this has anything to do with the change in the distribution license. I didn't check the other episodes on the Shout! Factory release, but I hope they haven't been cut.

Apart from the above critiques, I'm ecstatic to see the release of the complete Jem and the Holograms Series. As the cartoon currently airs on the HUB network with increasing popularity, I hope more of today's children (regardless of gender) will takes the lessons of the show and apply them to their lives. Many 1980's animated series had this in common and I believe it helped many of us 80's kids becomes the great adults of today.",1318204800,9,1569,4.785977859778598

4647768,5,B005BUA1CG,"What makes this cartoon so different from the many others is the intricacy of the series, the show uses the characters as the central driving point in contrast to the majority of other cartoons that simply use them as a vehicle for mindless action. The reason for this is most likely the fact that the show was aimed at girls and as such random action isn't appealing however, characters, relationships, and inner conflicts are. Jem features episodes that are both fun and exciting, examples of such are ""The Battle of the Bands"", ""One Jem to Many"", and ""The Fan"". Jem also has episodes that make the show transcend your everyday cartoon such as ""Scandal"", ""Father's Day"", ""Riot's Hope"", ""A Father Should Be"", and of course the powerful ""Out of the Past"" the maturity of which would never be understood by a child or even some adults. The more emotional episodes feature complex themes such as the death of a parent, personal secrets, conflict among friends, and family strife. It's the mix of fun and depth that really make this such a wonderful show to watch, especially as an adult when you can really appreciate it's complexity.

Jem features three music videos spaced evenly throughout each episode breaking up the action nicely, the 80s style mix is the best soundtrack to a television show I've ever heard. The show has a talented voice over cast featuring Britta Phillips (singing voice of Jem), Samantha Newark (Voice of Jem/Jerrica), and Charlie Adler (Eric Raymond) as well as others. Episodes usually involve the rival band the Misfits and their attempts to thwart Jem's plans out of jealously. They are assisted by Eric Raymond whose goal is to regain control of Jerrica's business which he lost early in the series. Eric Raymond is noteworthy as a main antagonist as he uses manipulation, money, and thugs instead of ""magical powers"" like many other cartoon villains, this brings a sense of reality that you don't often see in a cartoon. Near the end of the series Eric Raymond becomes so ruthless in his ways that it reaches a point of utter cruelty such that you forget you are watching a show made for children. Jerrica Benton(Jem) runs a foster home for girls that is funded entirely by her music company and it's primary act Jem and the Holograms, this noble undertaking gives real consequence to the struggles that occur. The threat of potentially losing her business is a constant fear as it would destroy her charity work. Jerrica also deals with an emotionally draining love triangle due to her dual identity as Jem that involves her boyfriend Rio. This becomes even more complex as the show progresses with the introduction of a new group known as ""The Stingers"". Jem's inner emotional turmoil is explored throughout the series providing another interesting thread to the story that you might not pick up on until a second viewing.

While Jem has a few bad episodes, usually featuring forced or unoriginal stories, most are lighthearted and fun. If you have a cynical attitude such that you can't stomach positives messages, often find older shows ""cheesy"", or if you prefer to nitpick 1980s children's cartoons for plot holes (ex. why aren't the villains in jail for assault) then you won't likely enjoy this show. Jem has wonderful characters, great music, and an interesting premise. A great deal of effort was put into character development allowing the viewer to get absorbed into the series following the struggles of the characters until the very end. You might find yourself enjoying a lighthearted episode only to be saddened by an unexpectedly emotional one that follows. Jem isn't political, sexual, violent, or negative yet still manages to be quite entertaining. One difference you might notice is the almost total lack of sarcasm, after watching this show you'll start to observe that in modern shows, even during tense situations, characters are constantly making sarcastic comments. This is a crutch that writers these days use to keep people watching whereas the writers of Jem expect you to appreciate the story as a whole, not just bits and pieces of dialogue.

Jem is a very unique show, with music videos, great stories, and lovable characters, these factors drive the show instead of shock value often found in modern television shows. The writers of the show push Jem beyond your normal children's cartoon making it quite emotionally and thematically complex.

---A short review about the box set itself---

Video - The video quality is good for the source these DVDs came from. Most episodes have good color, reasonable detail, and low amounts of noise. There are a few exceptions in which certain episodes feature a purple hue. The hue problem gets progressively worse on episodes near the end of season two but clears up for the three final and important episodes of the series at the end of the season. Glitches with the video do occur but they are very rare.

Audio - The audio is presented in 2.0 Dolby Digital. Most of the time the audio is fine with crisp highs and decent bass, however, there are some glitches present. Several of the music videos and opening sequences have an echo to them that is quite annoying, an example of this is the music video for ""Beat This"" which is unfortunately ruined by this flaw. The echo is also present throughout two whole episodes and can be quite annoying. The glitches do detract from the set as a whole and it's unfortunate they are present.

Extras - The set comes with a large number of extras on a separate disc, the quantity and quality of the extras provided are the best part of this set. The following extra features are included.

1. 48 minute feature on the creation of the shows which has interviews with most of people involved.
2. 24 minute feature with interviews from the voice over cast.
3. 27 minute feature interviewing Jem fans who discuss their interest for the show.
4. 11 commercials for the toy line, the quality was pretty good for VHS tapes which were submitted by fans.
5. A set of animated storyboards including a unused opening sequence.
6. DVD-ROM: The writers bible in PDF format (as images however), catalogs, and other print material (high resolution images)
7. All 9 Superstar clips (Public Service Announcements) are present and located at the end of the original episodes to which they were attached when first aired.

Packaging - The box itself is sturdy and does not feel cheap, inside are three individual DVD cases which are also high quality. The set features wonderful artwork on the main case and all individual cases.

In conclusion, excusing the somewhat dated looking video quality and rare audio glitches. I'm giving the show 5 stars because of the quality of the characters and writing(see main review). This is the first time the series is available as a complete set and the company involved in the production is fan oriented, giving the fans exactly what they wanted. This is a must have set for any fan of the show or even someone who wants to try a TV show that is very different from many others.",1313712000,149,7044,4.8285004142502075

8464314,5,B005BUA1CG,"Hey guys, as a heads up, please note there are 3 DIFFERENT versions of this set. To make sure u get the right one you want, here is a breakdown, ( & always contact seller).

VERSION 1:
This is the first one released in 2011. It's an 11-DISC set, loaded with special features, cast interviews, etc, that the normal individual seasons DO NOT come with on their own. In this set, all 3 individual seasons (with special features) come boxed together, & the Jem box set cover art has a nice metallic/""hologram"" finish.

VERSION 2:
Is everything same as above, but the box cover DOES NOT have the metallic/""hologram"" finish. (Released in 2015, same company as above).

VERSION 3:
Is an 8-DISC set (also released in 2015, same company), & appears to be a cheaper version, usually going for $20-$35, unlike the above ones that go from $40-$100. This 8-disc version comes in a opaque white/clear hard plastic shell case, same artwork front & back as above (non-metallic), and NO special features. Just a ""bare bones"" collection. If u don't care about special features, box art, & just want the entire series on DVD at a good price, this would be your best option.

All 3 sets are the same quality, by the same company. Either way, this is a great set to have for old & new fans alike. Hope this helps when purchasing!",1487116800,,1308,4.553191489361702
