5099397,5,B007MDB6Y2,"Speechless.  Phenomenal.  The 2 leads have that undefinable chemistry that can not be manufactured & is REALLY rare in TV-land.  I have always loved both Kerry Washington & Tony Goldwyn separately, but together - WOWWWW!!!  I can't wait to see what happens next, & not just with those 2.  I would love a blu-ray release though.  Blu is the future.  Die-hard, discriminating fans of these shows will buy blu.",1335657600,49,407,4.811594202898551
5099398,5,B007MDB6Y2,"Once is not enough.  Having a clever, intelligent, mystery is always a delight, but owning a copy of the DVD that allows you to to watch Olivia Pope and her team in action is like cheering for poetry in motion as the game of words is played. This show is off the hook, this DVD will be my summer gift to family, friends and my acquaintances. Smart, intelligent, witty, sexy, fast-paced and oh-thank-heaven, jaw dropping and not a gun in sight. Watch this supense building, twisted plot that keeps you pointing the finger, or second-guessing.  Now where can I get a copy of the show's poster?",1335571200,16,591,4.566037735849057
5099399,5,B007MDB6Y2,"Im not a private practice person, and I like most of the episodes on Greys anatomy. But this is the best series that Shonda Rhimes has ever made. It leaves you panting and wanting for more. What you think will happen, will most likely happen, but then it gets jucier and better and what soon what you think will happen will suddenly be something you never saw coming at all. This is one of the first t.v. series that I have actually wanted to buy that I have watched all the way without stopping. The only t.v. show series that i have watched all the way without stopping was friends. And that came to an end sadly. I know all good t.v. series come to an end. And this one will too. But in the mean time if you want something so good, something worth actually turning you t.v. on. It this series right here. Olivia Pope is not just a lawyer that gets people out of trouble, she is a gladiator, she is a woman who wears the white hat and she makes sure that justice is served. I can't wait to see what happens next.",1335484800,11,1014,4.152284263959391
5099400,4,B007MDB6Y2,"So far the first two episodes make me a fan! The show is edgy and every week possible client scandals are dismantled by a full service law\crisis communications firm. The stories and problem solving skills are interesting, so if you like intrigue, mystery and to see legal skills at their best this maybe the show for you.",1334188800,3,322,4.666666666666667
5099401,5,B007MDB6Y2,"Despite the excellent writing, I didn't watch Gray's Anatomy or Private Practice because I'm not a fan of hospital soap operas.  However, I was hooked after the Scandal pilot, ""Sweet Baby"".  The rapid fire dialogue and over-the-top story-line grabbed me and everyone I know who watched it.  Scandal has become the topic of conversations at social gatherings and that says a lot for the show.

Kerry Washington and the rest of the ""Gladiators in Suits"" make a enjoyable ensemble.

Even though I have a TiVo Season Pass, I might just purchase the season.

Good job!",1334188800,9,563,4.873684210526315
5099402,5,B007MDB6Y2,"Wonderful script...wonderful acting by strong talent from the Hollywood circuit.  The story takes place in 21st century, pre-Bush Presidency - But definitely the Clinton era.  There were many references to Monica Lewinsky that will delight you and send you wondering what happens in Oval Office that the public can't see.  I wholeheartly recommend this everyone looking for quality TV stories these days.  You will pleased and refreshingly surprised.",1333843200,11,450,5.573529411764706

I bought the entire season so I will watch the rest hoping it gets better and will update my review then.

Update after watching the entire season - I struggled to watch the remaining episodes and if anything it got worse. How this show gets the review it does is baffling. Over the top acting and poor writing.",1492646400,,520,4.360824742268041

Though I love her in all the parts but the love scenes, when she is making love to Fitz or Jake I really have to fast forward.  The plot, though completely unbelievable, is totally mesmerizing and addictive -- call it a guilty pleasure!  The president's wife is a fresh breath of air throughout all the seasons.  Crosses and double and triple crosses abound here and some are confusing.  Call this series a political fantasy. The love scenes (try as the actors must) are rather a wet blanket -- no pun intended. Because it is a multiple love story with no real chemistry between any of the pairs it received one less star from me.  Can't the director find any chemistry between anyone?

The plotting, the spinning, and hiding in plain sight.  All the conspiracies we thought plus more happen here.

5099504,2,B007MDB6Y2,"If it's free, it's a great way to waste an evening. Sadly, the two leading characters are the least inspired and believable characters in the show--with many of the supporting cast members doing a much better job.

Kudos to ABC for intentionally including African-Americans in lead roles, but Kerry Washington as Olivia Pope (and her hideously collagen over-stuffed lips) is almost cartoonish in the two basic states she presents: either misty-eyed on the verge of tears or shouting about things that really shouldn't be quite so alarming.  Except for her fashion show strut, and the ability to make her over-processed hair bounce with every step, I have no idea why she is in the role. She could be the poster child for the current crop of narcissistic, selfish, and demanding hipster and thug-wannabe  types.

Season Three and Four have become gratuitous in their use of contrived sex scenes--the show qualifies in every regard as soft-core porn, and I suspect the writers have simply ran out of ideas and surrendered their craft to the masturbatory fantasies of post-pubescent teenage boys. It really has become crude and contrived.",1442188800,,1135,5.086021505376344

5099512,2,B007MDB6Y2,"Just about every character on here delivers his/her lines in the same way: frenzied. It's basically a handful of the same character, only with different hair. Additionally, every character seems to have the emotional maturity of a teenager not yet used to dealing with hormones; everything is an emergency, everything must be sputtered off with breathless urgency and finished up with pouty lips and half-closed eyes. In short, the acting stinks, and the cast is entirely unbelievable. There is NO WAY someone with judgement as bad as Olivia Pope's, or a team as chaotic and noncohesive as hers, would EVER be able to pull off complicated missions to ""fix"" government scandals, but we're supposed to just accept that her gut is ""never"" wrong, despite scenario after scenario that proves the contrary. Disappointingly, there is ZERO believable chemistry between her and that dirtbag president, but we're supposed to pretend there is when suffering through the ""passionate"", ""up-against-the-wall"" fondlings. Snooze. Really, it's not clear why he doesn't love his wife who, while admittedly ruthless and conniving, is at least honest about who she is and her chosen role. He can't even be civil to her, even when she's trying to her damndest to be cheerful and do her duty with a man who in no way deserves her. She's tough and stoic, and he's a self-indulgent child. But he's one of the protagonists?

Thing is, and why I'll give it two stars instead of none, is that for now I'll continue to watch it. It's like a tawdry, empty-headed, escapist little romp, and sometimes, when I've had a hard day and I need to turn off my brain, this kind of thing is relaxing. Why not? Even utter crap has its time and place.",1440028800,,1710,4.8561643835616435

5099525,2,B007MDB6Y2,"I watched several episodes of this in 2012 and didn't finish and didn't go back and get the second season.

I got it again today because of the recent  Emmy nomination.

Now I see why I didn't follow through before: Two things stand out (or three): 'Olivia' is fine up to a point; but she (and her director) insist on having her curl her lip when she's being emphatic like a rabid dog. It doesn't work. It's not necessary and lowers her emotional I.Q. -- it's a loss - than - top model for young women.  She could bemore mature, as a woman who presents herself also as so sure of herself and who inspires her team to such a degree as she seems to do.
 -- The writing is a bit hackneyed and flat; the characters present themselves as stock characters to some degree, rather than as distinct individuals. (I have just finished binge - watching Breaking Bad, which has such good writing (layered -- camp and original and amusing and nuanced) and good actors who couldn't be anyone else (in Scandal each actor could be replaced by a slew of any other actors) and whom you had a deep connection with.

-- As a child psychotherapist -- and as an empathetic viewer -- it is unforgivable to use an obviously pained, crying  one year-old. One - year olds cannot be actors so if you as director want to show a small child fearful and sad you have to trigger those emotions in a real child. The child is traumatized; this experience will stay with her all her life, and turn her development in a skewed direction. Again, it is unforgivable for any film company, and for every actor and crewmember to participate in the misuse of a baby like this. Parents should not lend their  children to what amounts to torture in exchange for money and they should not be tempted by unscrupulous film directors just to get an emotional response from the audience. Parents have no right to do so.

The child is the only one there who is not acting.
Audiences should not overlook the traumatization of young children in dramas. They should contact the filmmakers and tell them they refuse to pay money to films in which the filmmakers betray their trust. These films should be boycotted. (In fact, the director of this first season,; the one who encourages 'Olivia' to curl her lip like an angry animal, as well as being willing to hurt a child, must have a vision of human beings that is cold and careless.)
(Just thinking about the effect on the audience, how can I continue to watch this evolving story with enjoyment and trust in it if I think another small child is going to be hurt before our eyes?)",1437091200,,2579,4.45859872611465

Confusing and hard to watch.  Who needs it?  Just give us the story and let us enjoy it.  No need to cause unnecessary distractions.,1419379200,,406,4.555555555555555

5099637,5,B007MDB6Y2,"Soap operas and TV programs that generally fall in that genre are not my bailiwick; so I never considered watching this series. However, a friend for whom I have respect mentioned that her adult children persuaded her to watch the program and she found it quite interesting. I decided to order Season 1 and thought I would probably look at the first episode and that would be it. Surprisingly, I found the program riveting. The acting was good and the plots were not predictably run-of-the-mill. Perhaps, part of my favorable reaction is due to my opinion that politicians and the Beltway are filled with deception. In any case, I am now viewing Season 2 and will probably look at the other seasons until I catch up.",1417737600,,716,4.690476190476191

5099696,3,B007MDB6Y2,"After burning through several great series - Homeland, Breaking Bad, Madmen, House of Cards, etc... I was led to Scandal.  I was warned that the drop-off is noticeable, however, I wasn't expecting it to be as slippery of a slope as this has proved to be.  The actual story line is interesting (Season 1) - however, the cast of characters are not only flat and disappointing, they keep having to say things like ""knight in shining armor"" and ""this is what I do"" in order to remind the audience that they are doing something extra-special.  Could you imagine Jack Bauer or Frank Underwood stating ""This is what I do"" in order to magnify the importance of what they are trying to attempt.  Instead, you see a bunch of fast talking quips that are meant to be punches and maybe good sound bites fall meaninglessly to the floor as the supporting cast smile awkwardly as either in admiration or because they decided not to re-do the scene and figured we would just be impressed with the quip.

The group of specialist / lawyers etc... that work for Olivia Post do not seem intelligent or even capable in their own right, let alone in a collection.  And Olivia herself often seems dumbfounded in expression and response - talking much about her instinct as being right because she feels it in her gut.  The acting withstanding, the story-line in the first season is above average.

 I would characterize this as better than the movie on the plane, but not worth watching at home.",1409616000,,1471,4.626923076923077

I am very busy running my own company, writing and producing so I really don't have time to watch television. This was the wrong thing for me to do. I stayed at the television for two weeks watching episodes back after back. The acting, writing and directing of this series is unbelievable. Kerry Washington is fantastic in the lead role. There is no one who could play the main character the way she does. The writing is excellent. I couldn't leave my seat and would run between episodes to take care of other business. Somehow Ms. Olivia Pope won over my heart too and I am now a huge undercover fan of the show.  I look forward to seeing the predicaments that her clients find themselves in and what she will do to get them out including the President. I believe there is an Olivia Pope somewhere in government.

5099778,5,B007MDB6Y2,"""Grey's Anatomy"" creator Shonda Rhimes has come up with another winner with her new series, ""Scandal."" Few TV programs can beat  ""Grey's Anatomy"" in terms of substance, quality and acting, but ""Scandal"" ain't too shabby. It debuted on ABC on April 5, 2012.

The storyline revolves around a former White House communications director, Olivia Pope, (Kerry Washington),  who now runs her own crisis management firm, Olivia Pope & Associates - a business with a particular twist. Her clients are those well known figures, usually political, who get themselves into deep doo-doo. Think Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky, John Edwards and Reille Hunter, Richard Nixon and Watergate, etc. The catch here is that Olivia and her team of ""gladiators in suits,"" have to believe in their clients' innocence before they take the case. Olivia is regarded as the best ""fixer"" in Washington.

Ms. Pope's team are all self proclaimed ""weirdos,"" - you have to watch the show to see how weird. One has to be out of the main stream to be hired by Olivia. The cast of her co-workers/employees are: Harrison Wright, (Columbus Short ). Harrison worked for a firm whose CEO was prosecuted for insider trading. Harrison  was sentenced to a relatively long prison sentence because of his association with the firm. Olivia defended him pro bono because he was innocent of all charges, thus terminating the jail time. This earned her Harrison's eternal loyalty.

Abby Whelan, (Darby Stanchfield), works as an investigator in Olivia's firm. Abby was married to the son of a former Virginia governor.  She left him when he beat her in a drunken rage. Olivia got a tire iron and broke Charles's kneecap. She also helped Abby get the best divorce attorney in the state to help her get out of her marriage. Abby is also extremely loyal to Olivia.

Quinn Perkins, (Katie Lowes), a new employee, is definitely not who she claims to be. Some of the episodes deal with Quinn's identity and the serious problems she has with the law.

My favorite character, Huck, (Guillermo Diaz), is totally ""strange.""  Another extremely loyal team member, he works as a tech guy in Olivia's firm. He is willing to do anything she asks of him. Olivia found the homeless Huck while she was working on a presidential campaign for the same candidate who is now president. She is VERY involved with our head of state. Anyway, she took a shining to Huck and brought him coffee every day. Prior to knowing Olivia, and after serving in the Marines, Huck was blackmailed into joining a top secret C.I.A. program called B613, where he was trained to torture and murder American ""traitors"".

Non-Pope employees but reoccurring characters include: Cyrus Rutherford Beene, (Jeff Perry), White House Chief of staff; Fitzgerald Thomas Grant III ""Fitz,"" (Tony Goldwyn), as of the President of the United States; First Lady Melody ""Mellie"" Grant, (Bellamy Young), David Rosen, (Joshua Maline),  Assistant US Attorney; Sally Langston, extremely conservative Vice President of the US.

Season one focuses on the lives of the team members, the relationship between Olivia and the president (her former employer).

The downside of ""Scandal"" is that the episodes and dialogue seem to run on cocaine. Everyone talks fast and the pace is beyond fast. It is really necessary to pay attention because you can miss something important if you blink your eyes twice in a row. Eventually, one gets used to the pace

Kerry Washington's character, Olivia Pope, is partially based on former George H.W. Bush administration press aide Judy Smith, who serves as a co-executive producer.

5099791,2,B007MDB6Y2,"I'm sorry I bought this series based on rave reviews by other viewers. Where is the appeal? The characters talk fast. OK. But the plot lines are stale, the characters shallow, the situations trite, the dialog (when I can understand it) stilted. Blurry shots with lots of reflection look arty but don't add to the atmosphere. Ditto the annoying ""snapshots"" of DC locales. Everything happens too easily, too cleanly. Everything falls patly into place, like a well-oiled lock.

Where's the scandal? That POTUS lusts after an African American woman? Oh, please. Even the idea of a sassy, dressed-to-the-nines, superhip alpha heroine isn't new. ""Modesty Blaise"" came out in 1966.

My major regret is that I watched several episodes, hoping to find what other viewers see, so now I can't legitimately ask for my money back.",1395792000,8,817,5.044444444444444

5099813,2,B007MDB6Y2,"This is just one more of those extended television series with an overly complicated main plot, too many characters, story-arcs & sub-plots, and absurdly long inter-season breaks that cause you to completely forget what is going on. So basically, you are lost without a constant review unless you have eidetic memory.  And this is why most series of this sort end up being cancelled abruptly and prematurely due to declining interest and ratings. this series is basically a nighttime soap opera with too much time between episodes - which is why daytime soaps require daily episodes with inter-seasonal reruns in order to maintain audience level continuity.  Soap operas always fail on extended seasonal scheduling with too long of breaks between episodes.

Additionally, and as far as this Amazon Prime offering is concerned:
For a short while, the first two seasons of this series were available for free viewing to Amazon Prime customers, which hooked a lot of people including me) into purchasing season 3.  But the mid-season break was so long that I have now forgotten the story line and need a review.  But now, Amazon Prime no longer offers the previous seasons for free, so I would have to purchase them for review.  This is just another example of the hyper-inflationary scam that is called Amazon Prime.
To summarize, I am  disappointed in this series and thoroughly disappointed in the Amazon Prime video scam.",1393545600,,1422,5.025531914893617

5099828,5,B007MDB6Y2,"I usually do not watch TV because the shows are boring, and the news is so negative or extremely slanted to the  right and left. I prefer to read, and if I watch TV at all it is CSPAN, PBS, Discovery, or science related.

 I kept hearing about Scandal so I decided to see what the controversy is all about and purchased Season 1 and 2.  I had no problems with the downloads.

I like Scandal because it is scandalous!  It stirs up feelings that raises questions or discussions whether conservative or liberal.  Either group will have something to like or not like about the show.  It covers ethics, morality, patriotism, abortion, adoption,
adultery, sex, gender issues, interracial relationships, racism, religion,  traditional family values, same sex marriages, murder, suicide, prescription medications,  protocol, diplomacy, and politics.

The plots (although some are ridiculous) are filled with intrigue, mystery and thrillers.  Sometimes the plots are a little slow and I suspect the show will last approximately four seasons unless the writers come up with more material.  What else can they explore?  The thing about Scandal is that you never know what is going to happen next. Just when you think you have figured
a plot out, another twist has been thrown into it like the end of season 3.  How are the writers going to come out of that one?

Scandal is not for everybody especially for those of you who have a problem with interracial and same sex relationships  or those who are offended by the portrayal of conservatives and extreme liberals.

 Scandal is just a TV show for entertainment only and its is not a political statement.  However, it does make interesting
water cooler discussions the next morning at work.  It does cross the line.  See it for yourself.",1391817600,,1776,4.889261744966443

I found myself very reluctant to watch with the rest of america because I felt the fans of the show were making just too much of a big deal out it for me. Well, I was wrong! Once I caught a glimpse of the first episode I raced on Amazon and purchased the whole season! This show is outstanding! I love it!",1391644800,,417,4.036144578313253

I found this show in its second season, and I went absolutely 'nuts'.  Where was I all that time.  The actors are excellent.  Olivia and Fitz (Kerry, and Tony) are - over the top.  The rest of the cast is equally great.  The writers of this show are unlike any I have seen, You can't dislike the characters, they are so fit for the roles they are in.  They are good - and more - well rounded.  The actors who play Fitz's security guards, I am taken with them, especially Tom.  I was initially drawn in by the fast talking Olivia - it's like she goes on and on; as do the rest of her gladiators.  The bad guys are -- what can I say BAD - but they are good. I could go on and on, but I will stop here. But watch out - IT IS ADDICTIVE.",1390262400,,859,3.913294797687861

5099864,1,B007MDB6Y2,"I really tried to like this mess, but couldn't make it through the first season. Kerry Washington has two or three facial expressions she uses for all situations. The woman simply cannot act and she certainly doesn't live up to the other characters' descriptions of her. You'd think she was Wonder Woman the way they talk about her. Then she comes onscreen, says some clich dialogue, gives a  facial expression, the music gets louder and then - nothing. Don't waste your time. I think the only people watching this are black women.",1388880000,14,531,4.771739130434782

I also love the gladiators from Olivia Pope's team, they all came from different backgrounds and walks of life, but together they are a force to be reckon with. When Season One ended, all I had to say was ""Thank You Lord"" that we had Season Two in our possession.

Best T.V. show on the networks, I just hope and pray that the team who produced 'Scandal' never let us down and stop making jaw dropping and superior movies. My life without 'Scandal' would be boring!

Fast-paced narrative and it sure feels good to see a corrupt person or criminal get exposed, or to be tempted by a physical love which is more powerful than the integrity of the nation.",1387324800,,505,4.516483516483516

5099892,5,B007MDB6Y2,"It's Scandal! Loved this disc set and additional footage. I swore off this show when I first heard and read the hype about it from friends. I really could not believe this show was as good as it was being talked about and I watched it on a day I had nothing else to do but waste time, and was hooked from the first episode. Great season one!",1385510400,,341,4.029411764705882

5099894,3,B007MDB6Y2,"This series is one for the women. It reminded me of ""Damages"" and others have compared it with ""Revenge"". This is not for the guys.",1385424000,,131,4.28
5099895,5,B007MDB6Y2,"Best. Show. Ever. I happen to see Scandal and decided to give it a try, not expecting to get swept up in Olivia Pope's world. I did and watched the first season within a week. I would try to stop and get pulled back in wondering what was going to happen next. The show is one of the best shows that I've ever seen, and I've watched some shows. I am still waiting every week until Thursday night, just to see what Olivia Pope and Company are up to.

If you haven't seen this show, then surely seeing all the 5 star reviews will get you to tune in. It will be worth it and you won't regret it!!",1385078400,,592,3.9747899159663866
