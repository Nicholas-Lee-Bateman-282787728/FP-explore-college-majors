8020070,2,B00021TDQE,"I really like Geoff Muldaur, even own his signature model Martin. But to say it is teaching anything is kind of misleading. He plays, he sings, he shows you a few things. You get tabs. Woohoo.",1406678400,,192,4.361111111111111
8020071,5,B00021TDQE,"Another home-run DVD lesson from Homespun!  Geoff Muldaur, with a somewhat reserved and humble personality, and perhaps one of the most under-rated voices known today, is an excellent teacher of his own blend of blues and Gospel.  His guitar playing is understated and beautiful, and we are privileged to have him share his secrets.  His voice is simply amazing...I have never heard someone hum a portion of a song like him.  His opening song alone is worth the cost of the DVD.  He provides many lessons for the intermediate guitar player (or someone who is an advanced beginner looking to stretch and grow) who will not be disappointed, especially as more information on developing your own style is imparted.  From the opening moments of Geoff's first song, you will be hooked.  This is a DVD that I use the pause button often, as I want to catch every nuance, but it is also one that I put in to the DVD, after my playing is done, and just enjoy.  His voice has that special ""Bing Crosby"" smoothness to it.  A very talented singer and guitarist coupled with Homespun's professional camera work and editing has produced another in a long string of excellent guitar lessons.  This is a ""must"" for every student of acoustic blues and/or Gospel.  Just beautiful...",1197158400,5,1264,4.752293577981652
