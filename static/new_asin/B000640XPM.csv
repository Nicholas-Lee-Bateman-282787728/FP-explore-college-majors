2168064,3,B000640XPM,"If you ignor that this film is part of the downhill slide Buster Keaton's professional life is experiencing at the hands of MGM, this is a rather enjoyable example of a pre-code farce, particularly the last half of the film that is set at the hotel. The first half is rather slow and clumsy, and has a rather unbelievable premise - a wealthy young woman, Angelica, is only attracted to womanizing cads, and furthermore only wants to marry such a man. Normally, this would just be her problem, but her younger sister wants to marry, and due to custom cannot until the older sister does so. The younger sister's fiancee enlists Buster's character, Reggy, to play the part of international playboy and hopefully future husband for Angelica  since Reggy is quite attracted to the older sister, but is completely inexperienced with women.

The second half of the film is the amusing part. It's set at a hotel where Buster is supposed to have a prearranged rendezvous with a woman and be discovered by Angelica, thus sealing his reputation as a cad and stealing her heart. Unfortunately, Buster takes the wrong woman to the hotel - and she's a woman who happens to have an insanely jealous husband. The woman Buster is supposed to meet, Charlotte Greenwood, is the funniest part of this film. She literally steals the ""training session"" scene she has with Buster. Cliff Edwards has some funny lines too as the hotel bell boy who keeps walking in on Keaton who is always in the embrace of a different woman each time.

It's just so sad to see MGM casting Buster once again as a clueless bumbling fool and doing their best to make it look ridiculous that Buster could ever be considered a ladie's man. Keaton does the best he can with the material he is given, but it makes you wonder what could have been if anyone had listened to his ideas about making comedies in the sound era.

As for film quality, I have never seen a copy of this film that was not unacceptably fuzzy. The only one I'd recommend is the copy that comes with ""Industrial Strength Keaton"". That copy has been restored and it shows. Plus it has a commentary track and there is a featurette included about Keaton's mansion, the Italian villa, which is the setting for the first half of the film.",1189296000,2,2255,4.601990049751244
2168065,4,B000640XPM,"Parlour, Bedroom and Bath is certainly no great Keaton moment on film. The main interest here is that miserly MGM trying to save money took up Keaton's offer to use his house in Beverly Hills as the house in the movie. And you get to look up real close, you see the garden furniture and beautiful steps leading to the pool, which have now been separated into two different housing lots I believe.  The internal shots were not filmed in The Italian Villa, but rather back at the studio.

I always get the opinion that MGM saw Keaton as romantic light comedy player, sort of Cary Grant perhaps.  Keaton on the otherhand though I am sure not unaware of his attractiveness to the opposite sex, would rather have just been allowed to be the comic genius is certainly was.

The premise is that Keaton who is tacking up advertising outside the Italian Villa is run over by Reginald Denny, who is a guest staying at the house.  Keaton is taken back to the house to recover.  Denny wanting to marry the younger of two sisters who refuses to marry him until her eldest and so far spinster sister marries first, decides to tell everyone that Keaton is in fact a great lover.  On hearing this the eldest sister suddenly becomes interested and decides that she is to marry Keaton.  Keaton's character is certainly no great lover and finally the elder sister finds that out herself, and the marriage is off.  Denny can't have that and decides that he is going to teach Reggie to be the great lover, enter Charlotte Greenwood. This leads to some funny and some not so funny moments.  I do like the chase scene towards the end of the movie and the bit where Keaton and Greenwood are standing behind a pole.

Keaton borrows from One Week with one of the scenes when he and Joan Peters are in a car (I did read that he got to play around with the car for a couple of weeks before the movie-it is such a great looking car too).

If you like farce you will like this, I've watched it perhaps three times and I always enjoy it, just that you know Keaton was capable of so much better.",1168300800,2,2063,4.371727748691099
2168066,1,B000640XPM,Yeah the reviews below are right... poor keaton.. This was really really really sad to watch. If you are a fan of Buster you will know that this wasn't his doing and full responsibilty for this incredibly crappy movie is MGM. If you ever get your hands on it just burn it and run away.,1126828800,,285,4.2
2168067,5,B000640XPM,"I don't know why the other reviewers knocked the movie so much.  True it's not ""the general"" or ""steamboat bill"" but it is a funny and enjoyable comedy of manners typical of the era.  double-jointed charlotte greenwood is a real hoot trying to teach shy buster how to be a passionate lover.",1108512000,6,290,4.5576923076923075
2168068,1,B000640XPM,"For any Buster Keaton fan, this is painful to watch. You feel sorry for him, and wonder how anyone connected with it thought it was funny at all. Keaton has little to do in this. Extremely unfunny attempt at farce. I'm glad I saw it on Turner Classic Movies, for free. They should burn it.",1104710400,2,289,4.2727272727272725
2168069,1,B000640XPM,"Poor Keaton. This third talkie is not a Keaton film. Is another thing, is a insipid MGM comedy.",1099008000,3,95,4.333333333333333

2168071,5,B000640XPM,"This old film takes a while to get off the ground but once it does, it really flies!

I never knew who Charlotte Greenwood was and now I'll always remember her. She is so very funny, how could I have missed this genius? I read a short bio in IMDB which said that Ethel Merman had to share a stage with her, resulting in Greenwood's part being cut to almost nothing. It must have been distressing to share the stage with the hilarious talent of Charlotte Greenwood. Well, now we can always witness her antics on film - this film!

So good. So very funny. Stay past the somewhat boring introductory parts where the premise of the plot is explained through dialogue. Then the going gets good and it is just wonderful.",1462924800,,714,4.401515151515151
2168072,4,B000640XPM,"A few of the other actors here are standouts, but Mr. Keaton alone was enough to keep me engaged throughout the film.  There is good humor throughout the film, and some truly laugh-out-loud parts.  Can a few people slipping on water in a hotel lobby actually stay funny for nearly 5 minutes?... the answer is YES!  The tall female actor does an especially fine job during the final chase sequence, but of course your eyes stay on the magnificent Buster Keaton.",1462320000,,460,4.654320987654321
2168073,4,B000640XPM,Very Funny !  Nice to go back to some real good fun movies!!!  Today's so called comedy movies r a bit raunchy and bad bathroom humor ?!,1458086400,,136,4.0
2168074,4,B000640XPM,"Got onto this from a You Tube selection of a 1926 song Why Do Tall Girls Like Short Men which cut back and forth between scenes from this movie with Keaton and Charlote Greenwood and a dance scene from Agatha with Vanessa Redgrave and Dustin Hoffman.
The movie is not Keaton's best, but it moves along reasonably well and picks up with chases near the end.  Greenwood rivals Keaton in taking pratfalls and winding up in the most uncomfortable positions.",1452211200,,453,4.6625
2168075,3,B000640XPM,This film is worth seeing  for  Charlotte Greenwood's brilliant performance..She was always  a treasure to watch on film especially in Oklahoma. This is  one of her best.,1395878400,,170,5.185185185185185
2168076,4,B000640XPM,"That's what Buster had from Eddie Sedgwick, and it shows in his 5th collaborative film at MGM. The film is remarkably good, it just needed to be ""tightened up"" a bit and it would have been really good. Keaton's acting is the great, underplayed, ""slow-burn"" that fans of his silent works are familiar with, plus great physical humor. It's just that the film is very uneven. The scene in the Hotel Lobby is OK, but Keaton's scene with Charlotte Greenwood (who would also play Aunt Eller in ""Oklahoma"") is marvelous and shows what Keaton could have accomplished if he was allowed to learn the Sound Film the same way he learned the Silent (think of his progression from ""The High Sign to ""The Playhouse"").
The problem was that ""good enough was good enough"" at MGM in respect to Comedies. Keaton, of course, did not believe that; a comedic film was just as much a ""film"" as dramatic one and just as much a piece of Art. To look at the MGM talkies always makes me think what could have happened if Keaton was given free reign; to learn, explore and create.",1320364800,,1051,4.507853403141361
2168077,5,B000640XPM,"The critical cliche (supported by Keaton's own comments) is that his talkies at MGM were all bombs, unworthy of his silent masterpieces.  Well, this isn't ""The General"" or ""Sherlock, Jr.,"" but it is very, very funny, and certainly comparable to, say, ""Battling Butler,"" one of his okay silents.  I wonder how many Keaton fans were leery of seeing this one, based on the misleading critical appraisal, as I have been for years.  I laughed as much at Keaton in this one as at WC Fields in anything, for example.  Yes, he was the finest silent film comic and director.  Yes, his talkies were not as good as many of his silent films.  But that hardly means they're not worth watching.  This is the best of Keaton's talkies I've seen, much better than his talkie debut, ""Free and Easy,"" and on a par with or better than ""Speak Easily,"" which is pretty darn funny in spots.  The pace picks up marvelously when the scene changes to the Seaside Hotel after a fairly dull first half.  Great lanky comedienne teamed with him, too - they fit well behind that telephone pole.  Try this one - it's not at all what you've been led to believe it is!",1278028800,,1134,4.487804878048781
2168078,3,B000640XPM,"Deprived of creative freedom, Buster Keaton had no say in the dialogue-heavy scripts MGM foisted upon him. ""Parlor, Bedroom and Bath"" (1931) was adapted from a stage farce - the type of frenetic humor he strongly disliked. Nevertheless, Keaton and director Edward Sedgwick transform the play into an uneven yet occasionally hilarious film. This early talkie finds the Great Stone Face mistaken for a notorious lover and forced to continue the charade. In a classic sequence, Charlotte Greenwood teaches Buster the art of ""physical love"" with impeccable timing. The movie also includes several imaginative routines that showcase Keaton's mastery of sound when MGM gave him a chance. Regrettably, those opportunities became fewer and farther between.",1277510400,2,748,5.51304347826087
2168079,5,B000640XPM,"This film raises slapstick to the level of art.  Buster Keaton's elastic physicality is matched by that of Charlotte Greenwood.  In one scene, Mr. Keaton raises Ms. Greenwood above his head, while kissing her.  Later, Ms. Greenwood does the splits while ""unconscious.""  Few stars would dare to attempt such things today.

This is one of Buster's first, rare talking films, and his voice is surprisingly deep and resonate.  His mild-mannered shy guy routine (and his determination to break out of his shell) gives him appeal.  The script has some snappy lines worth keeping up with.

What can I say?  This movie made me and my friends laugh out loud.",1250726400,4,649,4.8807339449541285

8038556,5,B000640XPM,"Typical Buster Keaton humor! Very acrobatic stuff. The script is quite funny with some real zingers thrown in. First rate cast of supporting actors too.  If you like 30's comedies you're bound to enjoy ""Parlor, Bedroom and Bath""!",1474848000,,229,5.026315789473684
