5188596,5,B008XAT0LE,"I wanted Wholly Moses and this pack was actually cheaper than buying that individually.  Vice Versa is an ok movie.  A Fine Mess is pretty funny and The Freshman is pretty good also.

Sit back, laugh, and enjoy 4 funny movies.",1356393600,9,226,4.463414634146342
5188597,5,B008XAT0LE,Very Happy! Thanx! A+++,1436054400,,23,5.0
5188598,5,B008XAT0LE,Great price for all of these great films.,1434412800,,41,4.25
5188599,5,B008XAT0LE,"I mostly purchased this set for ""Wholly Moses""...but I fell in love with ""The Freshman"" & ""A Fine Mess"" all over again.  Vice Versa brought back memories of my awkward 80's obsession with all things Judge Reinholdt. Definitely worth the money.",1432339200,,243,4.926829268292683
5188600,5,B008XAT0LE,Funny movie.,1426464000,,12,5.5
5188601,5,B008XAT0LE,"I was really glad to find this as it included A Fine Mess. A lesser known movie, but really funny, from the earlier days of Ted Danson and Howie Mandel.",1426204800,,152,4.1
5188602,4,B008XAT0LE,Great deal,1424563200,,10,4.5
5188603,5,B008XAT0LE,I was looking for The Freshman and it was cheaper buying these four movies then buying just The Freshman.  The Freshman is funny & so is Wholly Moses.  I can't speak for the other two movies as I didn't watch them.,1420070400,,214,4.195121951219512
5188604,5,B008XAT0LE,Nice combo for the price.  I bought it for The Freshman and Vice Versa (haven't watched the other two yet) and the price for the bundle was about the same as for just one of the DVD's when purchased individually.,1419379200,,212,4.3
5188605,5,B008XAT0LE,fast shipping. Love theese ol movies. great price. I recommend this seller.,1418601600,,75,5.333333333333333

5188609,4,B008XAT0LE,"The Freshman is easily worth 4 stars (maybe 4.5 or 5?), but the other 3 are pretty stupid (well, younger viewers might not have such mature taste as I do, and might like them (and not understand The Freshman)).",1395619200,,210,4.410256410256411
5188610,5,B008XAT0LE,"The Freshman and Wholly Moses I remember being very funny, the freshman more so than Moses, and the remaining two flicks, ugh, the only reason I purchased all of these movies is that it was cheaper as a package than separately.  This is my recollection, I will update this review after I receive the purchases and watch them again.",1391904000,3,331,4.610169491525424
5188611,5,B008XAT0LE,the rest of the movies are good too. The reason I purchased this set is that all the films are presented in their original aspect ratios. The single dvd of Wholly Moses is in the awful 1.33 ratio and looks very grainy. The 2.35 while not perfect is still a vast improvement. So enjoy watching this set.,1390867200,5,302,4.315789473684211
5188612,4,B008XAT0LE,"Marlon Brando did a good job of parodying his own role in ""The Godfather."" It's delightfully funny,  worth watching more than once, and well worth the money -- less than the cost of one ticket to the movies!",1390780800,,207,4.447368421052632
5188613,3,B008XAT0LE,"The freshman was too boring so I quit watching while the fine mess was a great movie while Wholly Moses and Vice Versa were Okay but I would not give a recomendation to a friend because I could not defend them. They are good or bad depending on tastes. I liked Vice Versa.
None were really bad.",1388707200,,294,4.175438596491228
5188614,5,B008XAT0LE,"awesome!! Great movies , 4 movies for the price of one !!!  Fun to reminisce and see the actors when they were younger :)",1384300800,,121,4.041666666666667
5188615,4,B008XAT0LE,"Bought this for Wholly Moses but like Vice Versa, too. Had never seen the other 2 features and am okay if I don't watch them again but hey, it took up an afternoon when I was bored and it was okay. Four for the price of 1 is a good deal.",1379980800,4,237,3.6666666666666665
