8006430,1,B00014NF2K,actually this is very much a DVD meant to encourage folks to 'climb aboard' and take the actual trip........not meant for entertainment...more for people who are thinking of the actual journey to show them what to expect.,1207526400,,221,5.0
8006431,4,B00014NF2K,"Great price for a really great mix of exotica and luxuries.  Good blend of temples and palaces combined with train footage.  Another must have for train buffs, even better that competing India train videos.  The Jain temples shown in there are other worldly.  Also, the odd and not-quite-together train stations and the sort of ad-hoc facts of life on the ground in India.",1125273600,4,372,4.857142857142857
