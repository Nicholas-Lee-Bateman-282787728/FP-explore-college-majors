8535245,5,B0093KZDJQ,"As a combat veteran, and Navy veteran, the ""official Navy film"" format is familiar.
For those raised on video games, it seems dry.  Some might forget video games aren't real.  This war was.
The camera operator is often trying to get the ""shot"" without getting shot.  The narrator is expected to be presenting in a ""boardroom"" format.
These elements might put-off younger viewers.  Put another way, it's not a Michael Bay feature film.

Good combat footage.  Has a ""positive spin"" (since it's a government film).
This is also likely to put off younger viewers who are used to the ""rage and rant"" style of Twitch.

Military historians will see the film gives good detail to weapons and application.
Wargamers for this period (post WWII to Vietnam era) will get insight as well.
Political Science students will see how tangled things got.
Veterans of the war, and any who have served, will appreciate the respectful tone regarding service to the nation.

Snowflakes will hate it... but they hate everything... so that's actually a plus isn't it?  Saves them time... looking for a reason to rage.  :-)",1501977600,4,1097,4.881081081081081

It is like watching a Power Point Presentation being given by the driest narrator ever. I could have simply read the Wikipedia article on the Korean War and been more entertained. This is one of the worst historical films ever. Burn it. Just burn it.",1480636800,3,342,4.444444444444445
8535249,2,B0093KZDJQ,"This is the closes thing to listening to someone read an encyclopedia, with a slide show, that I have experienced.  Terms are introduced without explanation (e.g. ""RAK""), and facts and figures are rattled off so quickly that only someone already well-versed in the war can keep up with it.  If you want an encyclopedia about the Korean War, but don't have the space, buy this.  Otherwise, get something else.",1472342400,3,408,4.884057971014493

8535252,5,B0093KZDJQ,"Korea:The Forgotten War is perhaps an excellent accounting provided on 3 DVD's. There are Historians who provide very detailed information that place the conflict in a more appropiate light. The use of the word appropiate is that this offer presented by the timeless media group is very nearly balanced and thorough. The film establishes how the sides came to be which is very interesting. It is equally perhaps a failure that as it was pointed out The United States sensing another War would be imminent if Simon Rhee(First President of South Korea) was provided with the weapons that he requested. Provided the ROK with small arms and some artillery. It was thought that the North and the South were about equal in there standing numbers which The United States were satisfied that they weren't going anywhere. It is the North where the problem came from as what the United States did for the South was not what Russia did for North Korea. The North had a terribly disparate relationship with the South and it is this disparate relationship that is thought to have been the trigger to the conflict. The Russian contribution to this disparity was its equal in the numbers of Communist Chinese who were on foot. Russia provided T-34 Tanks,artillery,and a host of other as it were materials of war that very nearly were enough to conquer a complete victory. This telling of the conflict is aided by capable and professional persons that provide more than merely detail, they provide the actual story as these persons one and all were our most honored guests from the Ranks of The Korea War Veterans. There is no shortage of bravery,of valor and no shortage of the many problems faced by men who fought in this conflict. There stories are a great assistance in understanding why I used a quote from one such an accounting as my title for this review. It seems that there is more to this accounting then merely this particular motion picture. This particular accounting that this motion picture provides does not have the capacity to truly witness this story and yet these men shared seemingly no reservation as to there experience. The defensive perimeter established at Pusan Harbor was so nearly the end as there was about 40 miles remaining between complete victory for the North and pushing United States and United Nation forces into the water. Our Generals would not let that happen,our leadership is simply excellent. The Pusan Perimeter was being reinforced in significant numbers of men and machines with finally front line elements of US Marine Corp arriving. It must not be overlooked that even with real strength on the ground The North was a very determined enemy,however the complexion of this event was changing. There is an entire section entitled ""The Breakout"" whereby The North had extended there lines and though not seen had suffered much damage at the hands of The Air Forces utilized in destroying the enemies ability to be supplied. There was stated more than once during the conflict that if it had not been for the Air Force our forces would not of survived. This opinion is stated more than once and those respective opinions eclipsed the entire conflict 1950-1953. The strength now on the ground at Pusan was known as the Anvil with The Inchon invasion being referred to as the Hammer. There is U.S. Government Film Footage,there are many upon many stories that do not stop with either Disc One,Disc two,or Disc three. There is told of the anniliation of Task Force ""Faith"" as they were attempting to withdraw from Chosin Resevoir. Task Force ""Faith"" consisted of some 1,000 men. This is a well presented 3 DVD set on Korea:The Forgotten War. I do not believe you can lose interest and with what we are privleged to be part of when viewing this Motion Picture. It is worthy of its viewing and of a review. Do not forget these were the lives of our armed forces. This conflict has the capacity to be more than merely what was once referred to as a ""Police Action"".There was significant involvement of both Russian and Communist Chinese in both Men and Material. This involvement was the actual underwriting to this very conflict with North Koreas leadership sounding much the same as the South Koreas leadership. These respective divisions of the North and The South were seemingly not what either the North or The South had planned. The leadership of both were itching to make the two Koreas one. The  involvement of the United Nations forces and the involvement of the United States was at least initially something of an act of ""good faith"".The level of American Forces present at the outset was like the estimate as to the standing numbers,they were neglible. Truly if you want a real opinion, the North was where the attack came from and it was with whom to this very day these true divisions exist. This particular accounting is a very useful and telling story of just how detailed this particular telling of this story really is. It is involved and worth every minute. It was for me and it is what I will provide the reader with,that is a recommended consideration. Listen to the Veterans tell the story,listen to military and as well the historians fill in the critical data. It will most certainly keep your attention.",1377993600,3,5252,4.8097345132743365
