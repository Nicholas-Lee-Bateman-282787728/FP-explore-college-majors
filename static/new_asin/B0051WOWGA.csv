8453329,3,B0051WOWGA,"These three German wartime films, produced under the Goebbels administration, give an insight into the production standards of the Nazi film industry.  Of the three, ""Der Grosse Koenig (The Great King)"" is the best, with very high production standards, and good acting.  The battle scenes are impressive, showing how war was fought in the 18th century in Europe. (It was a slaughterhouse)  ""Bismark"" is less interesting because it is rather dull, and the acting stiff and uninspired.  ""The Verlassung"" (The Release) about the firing of Bismark by Wilhelm II., is a bit more emotional but still rather bombastic.  All three films are very nationalistic, as one might expect.  Obviously,history films brought out the worst in the producers, as far as drama goes--yet are interesting in giving an insight into the approach of the Nazi producers to historical dramas.  While Goebbels did produce light entertainment films, such as ""The Great Waltz,"" the propagandistc element was never far from films under his direction.  For a long time in West Germany films made under the Nazis were banned from public showing.  Now, however, most of the films have been permitted to be released as historical documents--even the anti-semitic ones, such as ""Ohm Kruger.""  Films on this disc, however, don't fall into that category, as far as I can see.",1444176000,,1335,5.138888888888889
