2511656,4,B000EA3MH4,"Louise Archambault's first true feature film Familia is a quirky family drama that makes an attempt at exposing real feelings in the bounds of a film about family and friendships.

Sylvie Moreau plays Michele a down on her luck single mother trying to raise her teenage daughter (Mylne St-Sauveur) while supporting a gambling addiction. Due to an abusive relationship she heads out on the road and winds up living in the home of achildhood friend , Janine (Macha Grenon) also a mother with a teen daughter. Janine appears to live the perfect existence with an absent husband but there are cracks under the surface here also.

The film explores the relationships between mothers and daughters over three generations. While the actaul events that drive the plot seem somewhat contrived at times, Archambault's intentions are good and this is a well made independent film that is worth a view.

Released as part of the Film Movement series the main feature is paired with the short Recycle about a homeless poet in Los Angeles.",1254873600,3,1024,4.941860465116279
2511657,4,B000EA3MH4,"Familia is a film for everyone, but especially for and about women. Unlike the standard Hollywood ""chick flick"", Familia explores a serious question in a tragicomic manner. This first effort of Quebecois director Louise Archambault won recognition at the prestigious Toronto International Film Festival.

Archambault's twist on the heredity versus environment question is posed in terms of whether daughters are fated to display the same negative characteristics as their mothers. This serious premise is treated in a frequently hilarious manner as the film explores the relationships among three generations of women from two very different backgrounds.

On one side we have Michle, her mother and her daughter Margurite. Michle is a gambling addict who is constantly in a state of denial about the chaos of her bohemian life. Jobless and homeless because of her gambling, she is eternally upbeat as she lies her way out of one crisis and into the next. Her redeeming quality is that she truly loves her daughter, even though she is far too unstable to be a role model. On the other side is Janine, her mother and her daughter Gaby. Janine is an uptight suburban mother who keeps too tight a rein on her already well-behaved daughter. When the two families come together, they have a lot to learn from one another.",1221868800,,1315,5.027522935779817

8107850,5,B000EA3MH4,"A character study with complicated relationships all around. Gambling addict, Michele takes her teen daughter and leaves a man who cares for her to mooch off a friend, who has her own issues. This is an excellent movie with powerful acting, emotional conflicts, and a focus on the lives of women. This movie is in French with English subtitles, and I would recommend it highly. Engaging from first frame to last.",1474070400,,412,4.816901408450704

8107856,4,B000EA3MH4,"This is a very well written and well acted film about mothers trying to keep their families together despite all the pressures that come to bear on relationships between adults and kids. As a parent of an adolescent girl, I found the performances and questions around the young teens particularly interesting. The central question is whether you can do anything ""right"" when you're raising a family or whether it is better to be true to whom you are, which a result of genetics and environment is clearly. The two women find themselves in untenable situations that are probably no fault of their own, but must climb out of such dilemmas in less than graceful ways. The other reviews emphasize this as a ""chick flick"" but I'm one single dad who really enjoyed it. The gender issue in film that seems to make something a ""chick flick"" seems to be that women are helped by other women (mothers, sisters, friends) when they hit bottom, men are presented as negligent, absent, distant, avoidant, violent, or simply interested in using women for sex. This kind of portrayal is guaranteed to win awards from the film community, but I didn't find it particularly untrue or offensive. The central truth about women providing the strength in families holds up and the husband figure is clearly weak, but he also loves his kids. In the end, this is all we can expect from parents.",1356134400,,1369,4.756302521008403
8107857,4,B000EA3MH4,"Excellent story, wonderful acting!

The plot is very well written and developed,
the relationships between women of different generations, and even men and women are presented in an exquisite way!

For me, a little bonus was the very cute way the Canadians speak French, very enjoyable nasal pronunciation :P",1328659200,,308,5.26530612244898
8107858,3,B000EA3MH4,"I have seen this twice.  It is an enjoyable story about women, who happen to have children.  I wouldn't say it is specifically about mothers and daughters....as there are themes of addiction, cheating, and adolescence going on too.

A good chick flick for sure.",1326153600,,261,4.886363636363637
