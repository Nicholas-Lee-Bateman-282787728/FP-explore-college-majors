3755585,5,B001PPLJJK,"I bought this DVD for my 2 1/2 year old cousin who adores Elmo and it was a great buy. The songs are very catchy and i cant help it but to sing along. We play it in the car, at home and every where we can. The video is very informative about ""going green"" but i think an older child would appreciate the message better. In addition to all of this, Elmo looks so adorable green!",1266969600,,377,3.909090909090909
3755586,5,B001PPLJJK,"My daughter loves this video.  She is 2 3/4 now and still watched it regularly.
The songs are catchy and I have them stuck in my head after we watch it.
It teaches a valuable lesson and is really cute too.
It keeps her attention and that is the most important!",1260230400,,260,4.098039215686274
3755587,5,B001PPLJJK,"My 20mo. old child loves this movie! I find myself singing along too! :)
Elmo and the other cuties aim to please as usual. They are teaching the children about what ""the world"" is and how its up to all of us to take care of it. Also, it helps to clarify the ""being green"" slogan.
You can only imagine what a child would think of ""being green"", take it a step further and there you go. (don't want to ruin the surprise for you, you'll have to watch it yourself)

Catchy songs and fun stuff, I definately recommend it.",1253404800,,516,4.16
3755588,5,B001PPLJJK,"I bought this for my 15 month old who loves Elmo. I am a teacher and think it is so educational and entertaining. It is a very cool tool to help children understand the importance of going green. But it's not the best choice for a baby. There is a lot of information that would hold the attention of a 4 year old, but not a toddler. The concepts and language are a little more mature on this one than ""Bedtime with Elmo"" and ""Elmo Loves You"" which my little one adores. I will put it away for a while and gladly bring it out when my son is older.",1249430400,,546,3.9727272727272727
3755589,5,B001PPLJJK,kids love this dvd!  What a great way to teach ur kids about being green!,1249257600,,73,3.8666666666666667
3755590,5,B001PPLJJK,"What more could you want than Elmo and Paul Rudd in the same DVD, with a great message about saving our planet? The bonus is that you get some great music from AudraRox (a rockin' band from Brooklyn - led by the amazing Audra Tsanos  - that plays music for kids) and Toxic Muffin (a band of punky Brooklyn kids who make music for everyone). Audra's song ""Best Friends"" is awesome, and the Muffins', ""Turn It Off"" rocks out. I saw the Toxic Muffin song on Jon Stewart and loved it ... hope we get to see more of these great Brooklyn bands on Sesame Street.",1241654400,3,555,4.235849056603773
3755627,4,B001PPLJJK,This is pretty cute.  It isn't quite as cloying as some of the Elmo specials.  Paul Rudd is fun as Mr. Earth.,1387238400,,109,3.909090909090909
3755628,5,B001PPLJJK,"Anytime Elmo teaches, little ones learn better.  Even parents who carefully monitor their kids' television time will enjoy this video.",1357084800,,134,5.7
3755629,5,B001PPLJJK,"This is one of my favorite kid movies.

First of all, who doesn't love Paul Rudd?  As ""Mr. Earth"" he appeals to little ones and their parents.

This movie shows little kids different ways people are ""being green"" and taking care of our Earth all over the world.  I even learned a few things myself.  And then there's Elmo and all your favorite Sesame Street characters for entertainment.  There are lots of songs that my kids loved to dance to, especially ""Paper Makin.'""  A great video on an important subject!",1355184000,,511,4.611111111111111
3755630,5,B001PPLJJK,And when we received it there were actually two movies - one on each side of the disk - BONUS!,1355011200,,94,3.75
3755631,5,B001PPLJJK,"I got this DVD for my 2 year old son, he loves it. I really don't mind watching it with him, I catch myself singing the songs. My son really loves it, especially the songs he dances to them (it's cute).The DVD really focus's on Elmo and Abby, you see some of Cookie Monster, Telly Monster and Rosita.",1335398400,,300,4.189655172413793
3755632,4,B001PPLJJK,"My two-year-old loves this video, and I actually don't mind having to watch it over and over again. Paul Rudd is entertaining, and the show does a great job explaining what ""being green"" means and what they can do to help the Earth. Great message for Earth day and every day!",1326758400,,275,4.411764705882353
3755633,5,B001PPLJJK,"I really like that it speaks to the kids about being green always, and doesn't hit on just Earth Day.  The issues Elmo and Abby cover are recycling and reusing discarded items.  They even learn what the earth is.  A satilite view zooms in to a city view.  What a great way to take a hard to understand concept and lay it out simply. Through out the movie there are three monsters answering phones.  They are accepting pledges for kids, pledges to do their part.  I love the message that everyone can get involved, and that it really is easy to make a difference.",1302739200,,562,4.355769230769231
3755634,5,B001PPLJJK,This one is something new we wanted to try.  She loves the song at the end and will sing along.,1292198400,,95,3.75
3755635,5,B001PPLJJK,"Considering our 4-year-old's favorite color by FAR is green, he was already intrigued at a video in which Elmo actually turns green. But luckily for us, he liked the rest of it too--including the highly funny turn by Paul Rudd as Mr. Earth, a treat for grown-ups as well as kids. He provides some of those jokes for adults that Sesame Street so often tosses in, bless them--""These things tend to go comically awry,"" he warns when Elmo prepares to make a magical wish to ""be more green.""

Plus, now, thanks to this video, we have more success in reminding our son to turn off the water or lights when he's done. (As for recycling, he was already a big fan, but that's because of the trucks.)",1270598400,,690,4.433070866141732
3755636,5,B001PPLJJK,"Whether you are 2 or 20, this DVD is great entertainment! Paul Rudd is fabulous. He is funny and his original songs are catchy. It's not just Elmo and the Sesame Street gang. There are excerpts of places all over our beautiful planet that teaches children of all ages the importance of taking care of our Earth because ""Earth Rocks""! As a teacher and a mom, I highly recommend to all.",1267920000,,384,4.422535211267606
8334119,5,B001PPLJJK,"Great for Earth Day!  I have a now two year old (who loves Elmo), and a four year old (who is normally relatively disinterested), both of them however think GREEN Elmo is amazing.  Why is he GREEN Mama?  It definitely opened up the question about why things like recycling are important and how we can all be green.",1521504000,,315,4.396551724137931
8334120,5,B001PPLJJK,"Bought for my daughters 2nd Birthday and she absolutely loves them! Keeps her from bothering me while I cook because she can play with the magnets on the fridge, and they are extremely well made and adorable.",1469923200,,208,4.648648648648648
8334121,1,B001PPLJJK,Do not bother. My kids love Elmo. This one wasn't hitting it,1464825600,,60,4.083333333333333
8334122,1,B001PPLJJK,Not good boring,1463356800,,15,4.333333333333333
8334123,2,B001PPLJJK,"My two-year-old daughter loves Sesame Street and Elmo so we were excited about adding another Elmo program to our growing collection. This one was a bit disappointing, though. It's hard for her to understand and doesn't really incorporate early literacy concepts that Sesame Street always weaves into their shows. It focuses on a telethon during which Cookie Monster, Tele, and Rosita take calls of people pledging ways to help the Earth. Unfortunately, they show things like making paper from jeans,  purses from plastic bags, and knickknacks from glass bottles - interesting but not really things in which most children can participate directly. I would have rather the focus been on picking up trash or turning off lights or other things my child would be excited to do. The Paul Rudd character of the telethon host in an Earth suit was a little strange and he didn't seem to be enjoying his hosting duties. Elmo only turns green because of another of Abby's failed spells. Unfortunately neither my daughter or I enjoyed this program as much as the other Sesame Street programs we love.",1451606400,,1089,4.950819672131147

8334125,2,B001PPLJJK,My son who's an Elmo fan didn't spend much time on this one. The guy bouncing around in the earth suit turned him off.,1428019200,,118,3.9583333333333335

8334127,4,B001PPLJJK,"While as an adult I do not notice a difference in this v.s other Sesame Dvd's, for some reason this just isn't one of my toddlers favorite ones to watch.  The format seems to be more of a long story v.s 2-3 short stories that connect to each other.  Hoping she'll like it more as she gets older.",1405641600,,295,4.068965517241379
