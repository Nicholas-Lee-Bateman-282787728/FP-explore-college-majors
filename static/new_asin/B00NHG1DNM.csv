6656828,4,B00NHG1DNM,"Interesting video about a topic few people know anything about. This story covers how essential sand is to modern life. Not just sand but the right kind of sand. Yes, the shape of the sand makes a difference in what can be used for. Desert sand is mostly not usable in construction since the grains become rounded and are not as adherant as ocean sand which has jagged edges and bonds in concrete much better.

In kind of an un-intended byproduct of doing this story, this video also helps disprove the concept of rising ocean levels in some areas. Most of the sinking of islands or near ocean lands is due to off shore harvesting of sand which causes sinking of nearby lands. This is shot in video and explained in detail in this video. The oceans are not rising, lands are sinking where companies are harvesting/selling off-shore sand.",1461974400,3,837,4.617449664429531

6656834,2,B00NHG1DNM,"Interesting premise regarding sand as a world resource.  Unfortunetly this is less a documentary and more an opinion piece.  It presents in sh

6656836,2,B00NHG1DNM,"The case it makes for the commoditization of sand -- and its impact on the removal of sand resources from natural systems -- is solid, but it veers into beach renourishment as an unnecessary (and poorly portrayed) tangent, and it never makes a case for what could be done to prevent the loss of sand to industrialization and construction. Better writing and editing could have made this a far more effective piece.",1456617600,2,414,4.763888888888889

6656838,4,B00NHG1DNM,"This was a fascinating and eye-opening documentary that I have been recommending. It was well produced and engaging without dragging the subject out. The only real complaint that I have is that it doesn't dig very deeply into the alternatives to sand, which there naturally are. It leaves you with the feeling that the only solution is to halt construction world wide, which is absurd. However, the problem of beach subsidence is very real and not something that we can afford to ignore.",1455580800,2,487,4.879518072289157

6656841,5,B00NHG1DNM,"This may not be the full documentary - it's still eye opening.  This information is not new to me.  However, I felt so moved by this film I cried.  The blatant disregard we have for our natural resources escapees me.  The fact that we already build homes out of reclaimed plastic, Styrofoam.  This film is well done.  My next visit home - I will gather family around and watch this documentary.  You can do the same.  Olympia WA",1450051200,,428,4.397435897435898
