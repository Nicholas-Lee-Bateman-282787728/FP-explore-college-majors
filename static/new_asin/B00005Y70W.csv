1675032,5,B00005Y70W,"VCI has done a phenomenal job in restoring this l940 classic Republic serial and bringing it to today's movie buffs. The razor-sharp images and the stunning camerawork are rendered anew to be savored by all movie buffs--not just those addicts--like myself--of those old-time Saturday afternoon chapter plays. William Witney and John English move this non-stop actioner at jet-set speed. Beautiful location photography and amazing action sequences will even have those not usually fans of Bijou fare cheering for more. This is a definite must for the library of all movie serial fans--and even those who want to see how a l940 movie really looked before being sliced, diced and butchered for television. Artisan is bringing out these much demanded favorites from the past. Let us all praise Artisan for their efforts and hope that more of those classic thrillers will soon be on their way--especially Republic's fabulous ""G-Men Vs. the Black Dragon,"" ""Spy Smasher"" and ""Daredevils of the Red Circle.""",1078963200,31,999,5.25

7956595,5,B00005Y70W,"This is one of the best serials I have seen.  The picture looks great.  The plot is solid.  And it's rare to see a Hollywood action movie set in Canada.  If You like old movie serials, I highly recommend this classic.",1465948800,,217,4.219512195121951

7956597,5,B00005Y70W,"The serial, ""King of the Royal Mounted"" is in 12-chapters, based on the newspaper comic strip attributed to Zane Grey.  It was directed by William Witney and John English, and released by Republic in 1940.

Near Caribou, Canada is the only place in the world where Compound X can be found, used in treatment of Infantile Paralysis.  But in an unnamed country which is trying to run the British blockade of the North Sea, a scientist discovers that Compound X has strong magnetic properties, useful for guiding torpedoes.  An agent, John Kettler (Robert Strange) is smuggled into Canada by submarine to coordinate activities already in place to obtain more of the substance.  At the Compound X mine, co-owner Kenneth Crandall (Bryant Washburn) is caught by his partner, Tom Merritt (Stanley Andrews) discussing the smuggling operation with Wade Garson (Harry Cording) but Garson kills Merritt and escapes.  Merritt's daughter Linda (Lita Conway) sees Garson escaping, and identifies him from police records.  It's up to Sergeant Dave King (Allan Lane) and Linda's brother, Corporal Tom Merritt Jr. (Robert Kellard) to get their man, and break up the ring of foreign agents.

This is a pre-war propaganda serial, none too subtle, but it was made when Republic had all their resources in place.  Several familiar actors from ""B"" movies and serials appear, including Budd Buster, Herbert Rawlinson, John Dilson, Lucien Prival and, in a minor Mountie role, Richard Simmons--no, not ""Sweatin' to the Oldies,"" but the Richard Simmons who became ""Sergeant Preston of the Yukon"" on television.  Despite some less than believable cliffhanger resolutions and remarkable escapes by the bad guys, the plot holds up fairly well, and the production looks splendid.  Most of the photography was done outdoors, with California's Big Bear Lake emulating Canada, and there are only a few woeful rear-screen perils.  The fight scenes are well-choreographed, and Cy Feuer's musical score is nothing short of inspired.  Helping matters a lot is the print used by VCI, fine grain with a sharp image, excellent gray scale and, perhaps most remarkable, clean sound.  A few speed gremlins show up, especially in Chapter Eleven, and the second reel of Chapter Six starts with an echoy, slightly distorted quality, but the rest is of good fidelity, without any of the racket that often afflicts transfers of Republic's serials.  All of the titles are from the chapters to which they are attached, with the correct MPPDA numbers, and the small lettering is crisp and clear.

""Bonus Features"" include a Photo Gallery with what appears to be newspaper ads for each of the 12 chapters, 13 still pictures mostly from the serial, and three lobby cards.  There are ""Bios"" of Allan Lane and directors Witney and English, plus trailers for ""Zorro Rides Again,"" ""SOS Coast Guard"" and ""Adventures of Red Ryder"" though this last one contains a few defects, including lack of sound for the last few seconds.  But this hardly detracts from the fine presentation of the serial.

Watched with a day or so between chapters, the plot, and even the cliffhanger resolutions seem to make sense.  While the asking price of VCI's DVD, # 8312 may seem a little high for a single disc with a limited number of ""extras,"" the picture and sound quality are outstanding, one of the best transfers ever of a Republic serial.",1369440000,,3366,5.041516245487364

I just bought nearly all the Allan Rocky Lane western DVD's. It is really  great movies and the action is very absorbing!",1239148800,,267,4.34
7956599,4,B00005Y70W,"Actually this is to second the review by Don Carroll of Atlanta who points out the role background music plays in Republic serials and westerns. I am hearing ""Painted Stallion"" this very moment. After seeing the two King serials, I had a mad desire to know where they were filmed. One version said Lake Arrowhead( California) and another said Bear Lake, California. Help is appreciated. Having received the highest musical aptitude score ever in my home county, I withstood the slings and arrows of peers and adults defending what I knew was the high creative quality and originality. This time I am including my email and invite all Republic music lovers to do likewise. Maybe there are more CDs possible to go with those already produced by James King, may he be blessed.

7956601,5,B00005Y70W,"It always puzzles and even amazes me when reviewers comment concerning the great Republic serials. Yes, the photography, sound and special effects were all superior to any other studio. But,what about the fabulous music that all of the staff composers and arrangers were able to create during the period of the thirties and forties??  Some of the most stirring, energetic and even beautiful music ever written for the screen was turned out by Mort Glickman, William Lava, Cy Feuer,Karl Hajos and Alberto Colombo. My personal two favorites were Mort Glickman and William Lava. When I listen to the soundtrack of ""King of the Royal Mounted,"" I get so swept away by the music, I almost am distracted from the screen action and drama...almost!  This is truly one of Republic's best serials ever.  It contains all the best elements of the top serials at Republic, and VCI's restoration is uncanny.  Don't miss it.",1108339200,15,908,4.953947368421052

7956603,5,B00005Y70W,"This serial on DVD, is not only as sharp as a Kinzu knife, but the contrast is perfect!
The plot line is good, but let's face it-we're after the Republic fight scenes and this one is chock full of them!
This serial was produced during the period of the top Republic stunt men, who choreographed all their fights.
Allan Lane stars, who later became Red Ryder: after Bill Elliott hung up his shootin' irons!
One defect on my copy, was the BIO feature that wouldn't play.
By clicking the MENU twice, I received results! Go figure.
If you like the genre, you'll want this one!",1081036800,15,572,4.457142857142857
