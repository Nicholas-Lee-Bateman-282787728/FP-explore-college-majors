8205739,5,B000SL1O8S,I bought this because my fiance and I are planning on moving to italy within the next year and want to practice italian more. The only thing that you need to remember is that it is not in the same zone or whatever as the US so it won't work on any standard US dvd player. But i just use the VLC player program on my laptop and then connect it to my tv and it works perfectly.,1381104000,,375,3.8205128205128207
