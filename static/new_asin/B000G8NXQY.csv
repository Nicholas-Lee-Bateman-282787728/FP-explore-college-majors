8129391,5,B000G8NXQY,Love this movie! I own a couple of bob and tom comedy tour dvds and this one is my favorite! Absolutely hilarious!,1493251200,,114,4.2272727272727275
8129392,4,B000G8NXQY,"I bought this after seeing a snippet of Mike Armstron somewhere, and it turns out to be one of my favorites among dozens of other stand-up comedian collections. Armstrong is still my favorite, but each of these comedians has his moments. This is well worth the cost for a light-hearted night of comic entertainment.",1419120000,,315,4.851851851851852
8129393,5,B000G8NXQY,"Bob and Tom are hilarious on the radio, so it is no suprise that they have a genious group of commics lined up in this dvd.  I laughed from the time it started untill the end.  You won't be dissappointed at all.",1364601600,,211,4.0
8129394,5,B000G8NXQY,"If you have asthma or a weak bladder, this DVD is not for you.  You will laugh so hard that you will either die from lack of oxygen, or ruin your couch.  For the healthy people - this DVD is GREAT!  I bought one about two months ago and we've watched it 6 times already and we just keep laughing like it's the first time we've seen it.  I only wish I could find more Mike Armstrong on DVD.",1194480000,6,389,3.8860759493670884
