1884594,1,B00009L544,"What can I say? this movie [was bad]. The acting(yeah, right),the script(or lack of),and everything about this ""movie"" is by far the worst thing my eyes have ever viewed. Don't get me wrong, I like real bad movies , but I can put my mind at ease now that I know rock bottem has been reached. No more layers to chip away. To even call this low budget is a reach. It looks like a bunch of teens got drunk, found dads camcorder, and decided to wing a movie. Its about a teen girl going out for trick or treat with her friend and ooh my! zombies attack. Where did they come from or what caused them? Can someone tell me why I even watched this enough to question this? If you want bad zombie movies go see zombie lake,burialground,hot wax zombies on wheels,black demons,zombie5 or children of the living dead. Some better ones are junk, 28days later, d.o.t.d., biozombie and versus. indie movies are maplewoods,meat market,ice from the sun,flesh for the beast and savage harvest. At least these movies have people who have or try to show some tallent.",1074297600,3,1047,4.515789473684211
1884595,5,B00009L544,"Filthy McNasty alone is worth twice the price, but you prob already have that as a bonus on the Dead & Rotting special edition if you are a Debbie Rochon fan **drool**.
Mulva is annoying at times, especially in the beginning, but is just as twisted as you would expect from Seaver & LBP. Filthy McNasty is one of (if not THE) best independent films I've seen. Pure sickness at it's sickest :). Both films are loaded with 80's pop culture references, love the John Stamos bashing.
If none of this has made you buy, let me add: eye socket sex, auto-erotic coprophilia, cranial phallus impalement, and that's just in Filthy.",1066176000,3,621,4.603603603603603
1884608,5,B00009L544,"This film was really good. Some people on here take life and film making to damn serious! The character Mr BoneJack is amazing and cracked me up. I saw this film and filth mc nasty and then the next day I wanted to watch it again.
I think me and my mate Mark are going to be quoting bits for some time to come. We are both currently making films at the moment and I can say this has inspired both of us even more.
Mulva is very irritating but once the film gets going a bit then you get used to it. It's better than the character having no personality what so ever!
So my call to all these people putting one star down and moaning like idiots is YOU do something better and put your money where your mouth is!
Keep up the good work Chris and I look forward to seeing other films in the future. I think me mate has A quest for the egg salad on its way as recently he won it on ebay!",1085529600,3,881,3.9
1884609,4,B00009L544,"Well...the main star is utterly annoying and you want to kill her the whole time...
but such parts as takatura *joe anime* and randal *rob ezelius* make the movie worth it
the movie was filled with bad acting but thats obviously what its supposed to be!
if you give it a chance and watch it...lets say...5 times...i think youll start finding the charm..and even if you cant stand the movie...just watch for takatura cuz hes great...
ive been forced to watch it over and over and over...and you know what i think i actually like it now :) :)
i never got around to seeing filthy mcnasty tho...sorry fellas.",1084233600,2,604,4.5504587155963305
1884610,1,B00009L544,"I literally ejected this DVD from my computer, tossed it into the trash can...removed the info sleeve and kept the plastic encasing.  Here's my take on this double feature:

""A totally low budget, lame brain of a flick destined for oblivion.""  The most intelligible line in the entire movie is: ""Make like a tree and jump off a ^%$& cliff.""  Say what?  Don't EVEN consider a 5-cent rental.  I wasted 30-35 minutes of my life on this abomination.",1083715200,4,445,4.641025641025641
1884611,1,B00009L544,"I really wanted to like this movie, and maybe that was my biggest downfall.  The cover makes the movie look like it has some good potential to be a campy classic...  No such luck.  The main character, Mulva, is painful to look at, and her voice is so terrible I had to keep adjusting the volume. The one saving grace of the film was a short Benny Hill segment that was very well done, and actually got a chuckle out of me.
The second movie on this DVD, Filthy McNasty, was actualy better then Mulva, but still lacked the charm I would have liked.  The upside was that no character was SO annoying as to make me want to turn it off.  The demon Phil had phenominal makeup for such a low budget film.
All in all, I can't reccomend this film, which is too bad...  I wanted to.",1083110400,2,772,4.147651006711409
1884612,5,B00009L544,This movie was awesome. It made me laugh so hard I nearly crapped myself.,1080777600,,73,4.285714285714286
1884613,5,B00009L544,"Mulva, performed by the ever talented Missy Donatutti, is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time.  This low budget film not only combines; candy, Dr. Egon Spengler, Zomibes, and Bill Cosby, it's loaded with wigs, laughs and a side chocolate syrup.
Mulva that was the best Halloween ever!!
You're my hero!!
Must have

1884615,1,B00009L544,"If you want to see comedy and zombies in the same movie, stick with Troma, not this knock-off waste that isn't worth the time or money.  I'm a fan of low-budget cinema, but this is crap on any budget.
STAY AWAY!",1076371200,2,211,4.146341463414634
1884616,3,B00009L544,"It seems like everyone who reviewed this DVD before me either loved it or hated it.  I fall somewhere in between the two extremes.  The worst thing about it is the misleading cover.  The attractive model pictured on the cover is not Mulva, and she does not appear in either one of the two movies.  Mulva is actually a short, bespectacled, homely girl with chocolate smeared all over her mouth.
When I first started watching the movie I turned it off within minutes.  I couldn't handle the ultra-cheap, shot-on-a-home-video camera look of it all. (I was later shocked to find out it was shot digitally.) A couple days later, some friends and I watched the whole movie.  I remember commenting several times that it was the worst movie I had ever seen.  Other than a few cheap laughs, it seemed that Mulva had nothing to offer.
Within a few days my friends and I were imitating the characters' voices, mainly Mulva and Mr. Bonejack.  To date I have watched the movie five times and enjoy it more with each viewing.  Those who are expecting good splatter FX should skip it, though.  It was shot for $2000 so the makeup is pretty bad.  The appeal of the movie lies in its energy, mainly in the ridiculously overwritten dialogue and the exaggerated acting (or nonacting) of the people involved.  It's obvious watching it that everyone had a good time making the film.
Filthy McNasty was marginally better made, so I actually liked it less.  It had funny moments, but wasn't as overwhelmingly cheesy as Mulva.  A word of advice: a few drinks will make these movies a lot more tolerable.  I recommend this DVD to anyone who can appreciate campy humor and really, really low production values.",1074643200,3,1684,4.661016949152542
1884617,1,B00009L544,"This movie is a total waste of time and money, its badly edited, barely any gore, and the lead character is just down right irritating and never gets killed. The humor is crap and any connection to troma should be ignored as it seems just a ripoff scheme. Other crap films are much better, funny and drip with gore such as Zombie Doom (aka Violent S**T III).",1074556800,2,358,4.358208955223881

7991527,2,B00009L544,"In one word: Weird. That is what this movie is...just pain weird. The main character/heroine, Mulva, is a geekly asexual girl who wants to enjoy Halloween with her friend Cassie. But, zombies start eating people. I will say that the scariest part of the movie was when Mulva mixed cherry-flavored cereal with chocolate mints, tons of sugar sugar, soda and chocolate syrup. Truly disgusting. The film has poor acting, bad special effects and poor editing; you can hear the director saying ""go"". There are plenty of movie references and a lot of weird characters that have no reason for being. The movie is NOT THAT bad. It has pretty decent makeup effects for the zombies and people's guts. At least a million times better than&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zombie-Nation/dp/B000J10EQK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zombie Nation</a>! This movie is definately better than zombie planet. So, watch it for what it is. A low-budget film made by film geeks. The film is not for minors as pletty of expletives, sexual references and gore are present.

I would not buy this film though. This is what you would get when there is nothing else available. A rental.",1197504000,,1196,5.361702127659575
7991528,4,B00009L544,"Poor Mulva has lived in fear of All Hallow's Eve ever since she was a little girl. Years ago, bad boy McLargehuge and his sidekick Takateru terrorized Mulva, and stole all of her Halloween candy. But this year, Mulva is out reclaim her long lost Halloween rite, and rake in the candy. Nothing can stand in her way....except for those annoying zombies!

Join Mulva, Cassie, Mr. Bonejack, McLargehuge, Takateru, and Teenape himself as they battle to save Tromaville from the breakdancing horde of flesh-eating zombies!

7991529,1,B00009L544,"These two movies are terrible.  Horrible acting, horrible script, absolutely dumb.  BUT, Mulva is so terrible, it's fun to watch so it's a must for a bad movie night.  From the screechingly irritating ""star"" (who makes me long for Jar Jar Binks) to the laughably inappropriate ska music (did the director have friends in a ska band?) it's a riot.  On the other hand, ""Filthy McNasty"" isn't so enjoyable.  Possibly a so-bad-it's-good, but marginal at that.  I won't even bother with the plot as by writing this review I've put more thought into these movies than the people associated with them ever did.

BTW, these look like home movies, and you can literally make a better one by getting a bunch of friends together, a camcorder, and spending $20.  This isn't an exxageration.  This should be an inspiration for future film makers.  If garbage like this can make it into the mainstream, so can your movies!",1127952000,5,908,4.762820512820513
7991530,1,B00009L544,"I can't believe something this crappy could be bought and distributed. I was expecting low budget but not no-budget. The movies are literally a bunch of idiots playing ""make-believe"" with whatever is laying on the floor to kill time EXACTLY the same way pre-schoolers play doctor with their imagination when it's playtime. Seriously, I felt like I stumbled upon somebody's embarassing home videos. It's like they bought a new cheap camcorder and tested it out by filming people acting goofy and annoying. Just point the camera, press record, get people to act stupid for a poorly-written story with pathetic hack lines muttered, and presto, a so-called movie for sale on amazon and in Best Buy is made. Is it really that easy to sell worthless movies through big retailers? People should be careful when they call something the ""worst movie ever"" because they obvioulsy have not seen this garbage. I'm telling you, these are the worst movies ever and you will regret losing a single cent or second to actually watch them. Never in my life have I felt like writing a very serious cautionary review. Were these people even trying to make a movie? Literally, anyone could do this, there was not a shred of skill used in any moment. Probably a blind guy with down syndrome could do a better job.",1127001600,14,1291,4.79372197309417

7991532,1,B00009L544,"They got me with the cool title and great cover art.

This is just a painfully bad thing.  I can't bring myself to call it a movie.

I've seen lots of good student films done by college students and many done by high school students.  This thing looks like it was done by middle school students.

There ARE some good low budget horror movies out there.  This ain't one of them.  I can honestly recommend SHATTER DEAD and DEAD LIFE, both of which show what can be done on a shoestring budget.",1115164800,6,491,4.271739130434782
7991533,1,B00009L544,"First off don't be fooled by the chick with the big gun on the cover! She is just a cover model and has nothing to do with either movie. There are no cool weapons like the one on the cover, either! With that said, This movie is so god awfully stupid! And it's not funny at all! And if you think it is or you even laugh on accident. (I'll let you decide what's the matter with you.)This movie is pathetic in every sence of the word. I was misslead by the cover. When I got it and god help me watched it. I wanted to throw the dvd aginst the wall. And then sit in a dark room and ponder what I could have possibly been thinking. Don't buy this dvd. Only gave this movie one star, because it wouldn't let me post my review without doing so. This is a fair warning!",1097971200,4,761,3.948051948051948
7991534,3,B00009L544,"First and foremost, for those who are expecting anything ...[pause], well just don't.

There are two types of people who get into the business of making movies, those who do it to get rich and famous and those who do it because they want to no matter what, for the fun of making movies. Doing it for the ""Art"" by the way, is not only pretentious, but also stupid since art is a subjective term that anyone can apply to anything, I mean look at the Dadaists.

Anyway, the point is the best films are those made by people without dollar signs gleaming in their eyes, those who take risks, self produce, and make films with or without large audiences, because they love making films. Seaver defines this category. Influenced by those who started out just like him, Peter Jackson, Sam Raimi, Lloyd Kaufman, Tobe Hooper, Chris is making pictures to entertain, to experiment, and to give back to the community he's gotten so much enjoyment from. He's not claiming the kind of quality that most expect from films, but he is giving them the type of quality that people tend to overlook, honesty and effort.  For all those who would dismiss this double feature as crap or a waste of time or money, have probably never even tried to make a film themselves.

As for the films on this disc, well they are great when you watch them with no expectations, a little research and knowledge of how they were made, and the ability to not take all film-making so seriously. Here's some free research: Mulva, made for a budget of about $2,000 and stars a fan of LBP previous productions. It was Seaver's first film shot on Digital Video, the previous films were shot on VHS I think, and has cameo appearances by Troma regulars, Trent Haaga, Debbie Rochon, and Lloyd Kaufman himself. Though the picture quality of the DV on this DVD is about medium, it's still a fun and entertaining watch, if you let it. Filthy McNasty, with a larger role for Debbie Rochon, is a little bit more scatological and the picture quality is still medium, but the heart is still there. Both films have commentary, though a lot of it is more fun than informative, but they do help to let the casual viewer in on some of the in-jokes and references.

The bottom line is that Chris and his crew are doing what so many would like to do, but don't have the guts to do, they are making films on their own terms and distributing them.",1093219200,6,2384,4.483870967741935
7991535,1,B00009L544,"Any good reviews for this garbage is most likely written by the same morons who made this dumb flick. Two minutes into the DVD you know you've been ripped off, five minutes into the show you'll be back online trying to get your money back! What a rip-off. I'm a huge fan of bad ""B"" flicks. This isn't even a movie, just some stupid zeros with too much money and not enough sense to make a bad ""F"" movie. You just want to take the entire production company on a fishing trip and let them join the world's largest fish collection. Hey, they'll never be missed!
