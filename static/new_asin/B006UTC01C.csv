8504782,4,B006UTC01C,We first heard of Joris in 1989 when we recorded Feng onto a DVD. We have only watched a couple so far.  The book about them is in German with no translation we thought it would be in English as all the titles have subtitles.  He is a wonderful observer of life even tho the subjects are harrowing.,1400630400,,298,4.120689655172414
8504783,4,B006UTC01C,"The DVDs are in excellenth shape and rather good remastered, considering the ancient of the material.
Also the accompanying pocket book is great to get a background understanding of JI his time and inspirations.

What wasn't clear for me is that this was a set in German Langauge. that means the the pocket book also is in German. This was not clear to me but I probably overlooked it and it cost one star in the rating.",1362528000,2,420,4.454545454545454
8504784,5,B006UTC01C,"This 5 DVD set from Germany of the films of Dutch filmmaker Joris Ivens (1898-1989) marks a rare opportunity to visit the adventurous work of a master documentary maker. Although the accompanying book is in German only, the films themselves offer subtitles in either English or German. Some of the key films, particularly from the 1930s and 40s, were actually made or produced in the US or Australia (Spanish Earth, Electricity on the Land, The 400 Million, Indonesia Calling). The Spanish Earth, shot on the battlefields of the Spanish Civil War in 1936 at obvious great risk, features narration written and read by Ernest Hemingway. Apparently, Hemingway served as an assistant and go-fer to Ivens during the shooting, since Ivens was operating the camera by himself. (A version with the same narration, read this time by Orson Welles, is also included.)

One thing is particularly clear: this boxed set is a labor of love. The cinematography comes across in vivid form. Great care has clearly been taken in restoring and renewing both sound and image. Navigation is clear and intuitive.

The first film, from 1912, The Wigwam, was shot by the 14 year old Joris, using family members as cast. By 1929, some films later, we see the mature Ivens, with his lyrical essay, Rain, a visual poem set on Amsterdam's streets. Also included is a version of Rain with a score by the great German composer, Hanns Eisler, written in 1940 as part of a project funded by the Rockefeller Foundation. Ivens' love of water comes up again and again, whether the water is the Seine (1957) or much farther afield. Another passion is the world of work from the point of view of those who actually operate the machinery or plow the fields. Few have filmed the angles and power of machines, whether they be in a light bulb factory in 1931, in a field in southern Ohio in 1940, or on a barge floating through Paris, with more tangible, yet also abstract, beauty.

Ivens was a committed leftist and he filmed in the Soviet Union in the early 1930s, in China in 1939 and in the 1960s, 70s, and 80s; and on the front in Viet-Nam in his 1968 documentary, The 17th Parallel - a view of that war from the perspective of Ho Chi Minh's forces. There are many striking images here that it is likely you have never seen before. He was there filming, often nearly by himself, in the very midst of the sharpest violence of the 20th Century.

Joris Ivens is one of a handful of great documentary filmmakers of the 20th Century, a true pioneer. In the course of his career he won a Golden Palm at Cannes, and a top award at the Venice Film Festival. In the Netherlands today he is revered. Now, we have at last a chance to experience seven decades of his work, thanks to this impeccable set.",1355184000,2,2754,4.60285132382892
