2643784,5,B000HWY64M,This video is well done.  Class moves at a good pace.  I've been tapping for 5 months and found the combinations to be very challenging at full speed but doable at a slower tempo.  If you can keep-up you get an excellent aerobic workout.,1215475200,9,237,4.340909090909091
2643785,5,B000HWY64M,"This a great follow up to the tap notes series.  There is a great class warm up, then the break down of the routine, which finishes practicing the whole thing at different tempos.  It really helps you get the feel for how the steps go together in a dance.  ANd the menu chapters are excellent, so it you can't do the video all at once you can go straight to where you left off.",1191628800,17,377,4.0675675675675675
2643786,5,B000HWY64M,"I liked McKay's approach to teaching. It was very informative & easy to follow, even for people who have had previous training. I am an adult & have taken tap for 3 years now. As an accomplished jazz dancer & former latin ballroom champion I learned & was challenged from McKay's class. It did exactly what I had hoped it would. Because it was a different style than what I am accustomed to he got me moving in various directions with my tap steps as well as using my arms & body more freely. I will definetly purchase more from his collection.",1172102400,22,544,4.3431372549019605
2643787,5,B000HWY64M,"This tap video is the best I've seen! It is extremely easy to follow whether you are a beginner or have had some tap instruction before. The instructor, Louis McKay, did an excellent job explaining each step, and moves you forward at a good pace until you are doing an entire dance at three different speeds. It was so much fun I didn't even notice I was exercising! I would highly recommend it for anyone, at any age.",1160784000,26,418,4.371794871794871
8141612,5,B000HWY64M,"A lot of the reviews below are being unreasonable. It's dumb to do things the wrong way and then wonder why they don't work. This is NOT the tap routine to watch out of no place and then expect to get all the steps right off the bat. No tap routine is like that. Louis McKay is very clear about this.

You are first supposed to practice Tap Notes 1 and 2 and get the techniques and the basics steps fluent. Then, you can learn a tap routine (any, not just this one) much more easily. If he tried to break down this whole routine at a baby's pace, it would take two hours and no one would want that. He is a GREAT and smart teacher, and he organizes it perfectly. This is a fun and exciting routine that anyone WILL pick up as long as they go in order and follow instructions the right wayfirst the techniques covered in Louis McKay's fantastic Tap Notes series, and then this DVD.",1476316800,,880,4.146198830409356
8141613,5,B000HWY64M,I only wish there were more dvd's like this one! Excellent work out from a tremendous instructor!,1432944000,,97,4.764705882352941
8141614,3,B000HWY64M,"He needs to slow down with some of the steps, I am a beginner too fast for me, do like the steps he shows.
 ELI Newsom teaches much slower than this one. (my speed)",1421539200,,164,3.823529411764706
8141615,2,B000HWY64M,"I having taking tap for just over a year. I have the ability to put together steps to form a routine even though I still consider myself a beginner. I ordered the Bonnie Franklin DVD and it was clear and concise. She takes you through individual steps at a beginners pace then puts together a routine. Each step is totally explained and you have the ability to practice the step.  I also ordered Tap Dance Made Easy - Level 1 and the instructor used the same approach as Bonnie. Individual steps at a pace that made them fun and easy to follow.  In my opinion, this is a far cry from a beginners Instruction. You have about 15 seconds to learn a step at which time the instructor dances that step at medium speed then fast. From there he goes right into another step at the same pace. Although the menu shows individual steps, he goes from one step to another which does not give you the ability to replay that particular segment. Yes I know you can run it back, but in my opinion that defeats the purpose. In any event I consider this instruction DVD to be somewhere between intermediate and advanced.",1404432000,,1102,4.397058823529412
8141616,4,B000HWY64M,Enjoy very much the approach towards learning tap techniques. This class approach gives a more intimate feeling of learning along with others,1393545600,,141,5.454545454545454
8141617,3,B000HWY64M,Moves too fast for a first time tapper but I found a way to keep at it.  Thank goodness for menu and replay :),1385251200,,110,3.5833333333333335
8141618,5,B000HWY64M,"I took up tap dancing for the first time at the local senior center a few years ago and really enjoy it.  I hesitated to buy this DVD because I thought it would be too easy.  I was wrong.  Even though the steps are basic, they are used in interesting combinations.  The routine is fun to learn and has quite a LOT of steps and combinations to remember, but  the menu is so well organized, you can easily search for whatever part of the routine you wish to practice.  There is a warm-up at the beginning in which  the steps used in the dance routine are introduced.  Louis McKay is a great instructor and I hope he makes another DVD soon.  I would recommend ""The Class"" to the  Advanced Beginner.",1372636800,3,695,4.276923076923077
8141619,2,B000HWY64M,I was not as happy as I thought I would be. It is poor quality and the sound is bad. I expected something different I guess.,1350604800,,124,3.8076923076923075
8141620,3,B000HWY64M,"Learning the dance was frustrating for me.  Some places were ridiculously slow, in one case for a step that was already in the dance elsewhere.  When broken down too far, the sounds were lost, which are important for me in tapping. Other places never quite seemed to be broken down enough.  Some steps never made sense to me (the rhythm in the shuffle flaps at the end).

It took me a good 2-3 weeks to learn the dance.  But now that I know it, it is what I most want, a complete routine to do for exercise, and I do get winded.  I think it only takes me about 1-2 minutes to do the whole thing now.  3 times through isn't even 10 minutes of a workout and starts to get boring.

Here's what I'd like:  more basic steps and/or repeat sections so the dance can be learned more easily and be longer.  Then give me 3 or 4 complete routines so that when I've learned them, I can just do the dances for my workout.

The premise worked though, I love to tap, and can't imagine any other cardio that could keep me interested.  Need to find some more dances though and hope I can make a recording of them all strung together for my workout.",1328486400,5,1131,4.161290322580645
8141621,5,B000HWY64M,"I bought this DVD becaue, at age 57, my life was becoming a litany of things I could no longer do.  I took tap and ballet when I was a girl, and one day I asked myself, ""can I still tap?""  So, to find out, I bought this wonderful video.  The Class is easy to follow, and fun.  Louis McKay breaks the moves down and makes them look easy.  I find the indexed chapters convenient.  It is possible to review a section several times before moving on to the next one.  I can now follow almost the entire video, tapping and smiling with McKay and his class.  I recommend this video highly for anyone who wants to get back tapping.  I suppose a person who has never tapped could follow it also, but might need to repeat the sections several times to learn the moves.  To Louis McKay, I say thanks.  This video has improved my life.  I have burned lots of calories, my coordination has improved, and my self esteem is higher than ever. So, to answer my original question ...",1282694400,10,965,4.241758241758242
