8449178,5,B004Z132TQ,"Beautiful and intimate interview with one of the last of the troubadors of the folk movement, though as an artist and musical mother to Janis Joplin, Janis Ian, Bob Dylan and Grace Slick, Ms Gordon defied categorization. Odetta speaks warmly and clearly in a comforting voice about her life and music and unselfishly shows Dr Barnwell her guitar playing and warm up techniques, always a teacher and, as she once stated in one of the many concerts of hers that I was so lucky to attend, ""...putting something back into the pot you draw from so that others may share and pass it on."" A belief and conviction that I wished to have heard and seen in an interview with Aretha Franklin when she was innocently asked how she works on a song and, obviously offended, told the interviewer, ""You really expect me to share my creative secrets? I don't do that sort of thing.""
Odetta Gordon, who has cited Leadbelly, Marian Anderson, Bessie Smith, Alberta Hunter and Ms Josphine Baker as her main influences, has sadly gone unrecognized as a formidable talent as a performer and teacher. When you watch how she interacts with and shares with Dr Barnwell, who graciously and intelligently guides and supports Odetta through this 75 minute tape, you will be left with a burning question as to why Ms Gordon never achieved the recognition by the music industry she deserved, not even a Grammy Liftetime Achievement Award. But you will also know that it didn't really matter to her because Odetta's musical birth and regeneration and mission was simply to reach out and share and embrace the thousands who attended her concerts and bought her records. You couldn't have asked for any better award than that.
Thank you, Dr Barnwell, for inviting us all into that intimate space you shared with Odetta. You made us proud.",1421280000,2,1803,4.782051282051282
8449179,4,B004Z132TQ,"Odetta has 6 fantastic full-song performances on this DVD recorded in 1999. But it's also a biographic interview of Odetta by one of the singers from Sweet Honey In The Rock. It's an interesting conversation to hear once or twice, particularly if you are also interested in Odetta's playing and singing techniques. The unfortunate part is that you have to jump around to see only the performances. They do at least have a menu set up so you can jump right to each performance, except from there the movie continues in linear fashion. And it does drag a bit on repeated viewings. But - it seems this may be the only DVD out there where you can purchase full song performances by Odetta - or one of the very few. And they are very powerful. And it is nice to be able to learn all this extra information about Odetta, straight from her own mouth. Here's hoping that more Odetta performances will be unearthed and released on future DVDs.",1333843200,5,934,4.5325443786982245
