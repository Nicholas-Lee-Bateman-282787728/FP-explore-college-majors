7514781,1,B017RR78TY,"Once again, Lionsgate demonstrates their ""cheapness"" and their lack of respect for customers by not releasing on Blu Ray...  Why bother remastering if you're going to release only on an older, NON-HD format that is going the way of the do-do bird?",1447632000,7,247,4.880952380952381
7514782,5,B017RR78TY,"Of course I can't review this particular set of DVDs -- since they don't come out until Jan 19th, 2016 -- but I can say that the Deluxe Remastered DVD series has been excellent (my wife loves them, I'm not a huge ""Little House on the Prairie"" fan). I'm posting because, although I understand the Blu Ray buyer's anger, it's a joke to review non-existent Blu Ray versions just to skew the DVD reviews. And I've read that the Blu Ray versions probably will be coming out -- eventually -- anyhow. So give it a rest folks. Or write to Lions Gate and leave Amazon out of it.",1447286400,8,569,4.277777777777778
7514783,5,B017RR78TY,"A great dvd release with subts so only season 9 and the three post tv movies are left to be released in these deluxe editions.
 I really can't understand those who give this 1 star just cause it's not blu ray.
 WE LOVE DVD ........NOT BLU RAY.
 U are the minority who buy blu ray that's why lionsgate stoped the blu releases for this series....they were not selling enough.
 only dvd sell enough.........didn't u knew that  ?
 DVD WON THE WAR.......BLU RAY SHOULD BE CANSELLED SO WE GET OUR PEACE BACK FROM THOSE KIND OF BLU RAY REVIEWS.

 ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.

 U WANT LHOTP ON BLU RAY  ?  SPOILED PEOPLE.......

  UPDATE

  two post tv movies will be included in the set..",1447286400,9,671,4.404958677685951
7514784,5,B017RR78TY,"ORIGINAL REVIEW BEFORE BLU-RAY ANNOUNCEMENT:
They better put out the remaining seasons on Blu-Ray.  We (my family) already owned the old DVD editions and only buying the new ones for re-mastered, uncut, and hi-definition. I will not be buying the standard DVDs, only the poor souls that missed the now clearance special original DVDs will drop a cent on these (sub)standard DVDs. If they don't release the final seasons in Blu-Ray, it would be one of the biggest scams out there in the home entertainment world. Terrible. They better change their minds.

REVISED REVIEW:
Lionsgate did right to the consumers. They gave them what they wanted - physical HD Blu-ray discs. I thank them for this and change my review.

Again, I had the old DVDs, I wouldn't buy the new ones for a little ""standard def"" remastering (and a little extra unedited content fro the original runs), and it would be painful to see an incomplete collection on my shelf. Blu-ray makes it worth it to buy them again.

And again, streaming isn't for everyone. If you stream it, (1) some day the provider could shut it down (Netflix did this to a few shows recently, to much outrage... how quickly people forget), or (2) you are in an area with LIMITED bandwidth, slow data streams or harsh data caps. Streaming is NOT for everybody, and people who have it should try living in an area that does not and see if they feel the same way.  They will shut the F*** up about it. Remember trying to view anything in dial-up? Even a low res picture was a painful wait. A physical Blu-ray disc is an HD copy that you own, it can never be legally taken from you, and as long as you take care of the disc and have a player, it's yours for life.

Again, thanks for giving the consumers what they want, even if it costs a little more to do so. The people who really want it will pay. I wish all companies did.

PS - For those who are wondering, these are pressed discs. Rumor was burned MOD BD-Rs, not the case with mine.",1447200000,10,1974,4.43646408839779
7514785,4,B017RR78TY,"I have got them all on DVD...I will pick his one up when it hits Walmart for $15.00.
I hope season 9 will be out soon also.... Then I will have it all.

P/S....They are not making the $$ on he B/R's..So going he DVD way...That is all  I can come up with...
This is one big reason I do not buy TV series on Blu-Ray..

I adore the show and grew up on it. This is the weakest season, but still has a few great episodes. I don't recommend buying the next season after this one (or the first movie where Albert dies).. They're not true to the original series, not the same feel. Best seasons are by far seasons 1-4, though 5-7 are also enjoyable, just more geared towards adults (so for those who are buying for kids, get 1-4... Then wait) :) a must own for die hard fans.",1462233600,,617,4.15

7515208,5,B017RR78TY,"First of all, a big thanks to Lionsgate for deciding to continue with the remaining seasons of LHOTP on blu ray.

I pre ordered this back in January, and I received a dispatched email on the 23 March. I received it today which I find incredible fast, considering I got it shipped from the US to UK.

For any potential UK customers purchasing this from Amazon.com, please be aware that these are Region A blu ray disks and will only play on a Region A or multi region blu ray player. They will not play on a UK bought Region B blu ray player.

I managed to watch the first couple of episodes off of this and find the picture quality to be superb and I see no difference in the picture quality from the earlier seasons. The same applies too for the sound, admittedly I don't have a multi speaker surround system, but I do have a good quality soundbar.

It is clear to see that Lionsgate have cut the costs for this season as there are no interactive menus or ability to bookmark parts of episodes (like you were able to on the earlier releases). But too be honest, if this is the only way in which Lionsgate could make this release financially viable, then I'm fine with that. I buy these to watch the episodes and I'm not bothered too much on the menu system.

All in all pleased with this and looking forward to completing my blu ray set next month with the release of season 9.",1459209600,5,1378,4.264367816091954
7515209,5,B017RR78TY,This is enjoyable family entertainment,1459123200,,38,6.8
7515210,1,B017RR78TY,"I'd been collecting the Little House series on DVD (the old un-remastered version) by purchasing them used at a local store, until I got to season 6 and found that it wasn't available there. I went to purchase it online and discovered the blu-ray version. Got that and I was very pleased. The show looked great and the episodes were uncut. Got season 7 of the remastered DVD version because I didn't know what the heck was going on with the release of that on blu ray at the time. Then decided to wait for season 8 on blu ray when I found out it was a confirmed release. Pre-ordered it and, well, turns out the season 8 blu ray discs don't even work on my blu ray player. It'll display the anti-piracy warning and then loads and displays the background for the disc menu screen, the house. But there is no disc menu and I can't do anything/watch anything. Hitting the disc menu button stops the disc. I put the discs into my PS3 and they actually play on that- but for some reason, the intro looks crappy and un-enhanced unlike on my season 6 blu rays, and some of the show looks like crap too/when it's not showing characters close up. Seems like they did a lazier job enhancing/remastering this season? This season also didn't come with the protective cardboard slipcover- not a huge deal but just another thing that makes it seem like they stopped caring. And I have no idea why the discs won't play on my blu ray player since I have zero problems with any other blu ray discs. I'd really like to be able to watch it on my blu ray player on my living room so I'm about to return this and try ordering the remastered DVD I guess. If that has the same problem then I don't know what to do at this point except hunt down a copy of the old, un-remastered DVD version (which is what the first 5 seasons of my collection are!) You know what, it's just not that big of a deal to me anymore as long as I can watch the show. I'm annoyed with the whole situation.",1459123200,2,1956,4.246648793565684
7515211,5,B017RR78TY,"I wanted to say thank you so very much  LIONSGATE for being so very generous releasing Little House on the Prairie Season 7, 8 and 9 next month In April. It so very nice to have this wonderful TV Show on Blu-Ray Disc. In the episodes original unedited NBC full length presentation. I remember when I bought the original Little Houses on the Prairie  in the DVD Box sets. I was so happy to get them and have them to my DVD collection. But I remember after I had got them. My friend told me sadly it wasn't the full version of  Little House on the Prairie. They were all edited episodes. Me and my friend felt so cheated. Specially on the price we paid for each box set. We always wondered will they some day give the fans what they so wanted. The full unedited season episodes of Little House on the Prairie. And a decade later LIONSGATE did. They have did a wonderful job of restoring this classic family tv show from the 70's and 80's. And also give the fans in this Blu-ray box set two of the Little House TV movies restored and unedited  Look Back to Yesterday and The Last Farewell. I can't wait to order the last Season of Little House on the Prairie Season 9.

It's liveable with but I hope they Re do that scene in future please
Checked again and it starts going before the singing the reverend  shouts that we didn't do it vain and the townspeople a foot behind him shout and scream and cheer you'd think they were in the next town and that's how it stays though you can hear them walking with clunky footwear as they sing but the singing is way in background in my dvd the picture is not as good but that last scene the sound is clear and loud
Firstly thanks to amazon I got this leaving USA Tuesday morning arrived in UK in evening and to me today that's fantastic

7515248,1,B017RR78TY,"Because Lionsgate was presumptuous in believing that those of whom wanted a COMPLETE set on Bluray should settle for less than 30 MBps video and something other than DTS-HD Master bit, I'm going to be equally presumptuous in my rating.

Am I going to purchase this?  Only after someone else pulls the trigger at a (significantly) higher price point of nearly double, at $30.  Sorry, but, a Lionsgate guinea pig I will be, no longer.

Furthermore, this may be pompous in statement, however; I -expect- Lionsgate to recall the Season 7 Bluray they released and replace it with an equal (to the previous seasons) quality release.  Entitlement?  Absolutely NOT.  Lionsgate, question.  Which would hurt the bottom line more?  Re-releasing Season 7, issuing a voluntary recall and ensuring Season  8 and 9 offer the same quality (specifications) as previous released, or a class action lawsuit for something that I find to be a bait and switch scam?  I'm considering, you bet, I'm considering it.

Tired of the games.  From being excited to see the remastered (non-syndicated) versions being released in Bluray Season 1, then 2, then 3, then at this point fully and safely assuming that 4 would be in an equally superior Bluray, it was, then Season 5, then 6 and then.... oh oh, almost had it!.. but wait, ""we see the error of our treacherous and greedy ways, we'll release it on Bluray on order"", EXCELLENT.. oh, oh you almost had it (again)... inferior quality, for more money!..  So tell me Lionsgate (and for anyone believing they do NOT read our comments here at perhaps one of the largest if not THE largest online retailer is more ignorant than Lionsgate), you ready to make right?

Another aspect one MUST consider (the dirty truth of it).  Perhaps the royalties on the last three seasons are more, to the actors/actresses.  Perhaps it scaled with their salary?  I can't help but to believe -that- might be a determining factor here.  But, it still doesnt absolve Lionsgate of their ignorance.  If what I suggest is indeed the case, then fine, charge $30 for a Bluray season, but, make darn sure its the quality the first 6 seasons were!",1455408000,8,2139,4.808219178082192
7515249,5,B017RR78TY,"I have spent some of my youthful years looking at this show ever since it's debut in 1974 when I was 8. I did not get the other DVD sets previous to these ""Lionsgate"" releases. I have read that those were not the ""full broadcast length"", so I withheld my purchases until a better version could come forth in the future. Well, here we are. I would also like to say if a company like Lionsgate says they are going to release a show in it's entirety on a format for our High Definition TVs, of which we all own now in the digital age, they should follow through and get the rest of the series on the format. Don't do seasons 1-7 and then stop. Hello? There are 9 total. Finish it off and let the customers have a choice of getting the Blu-rays at least. Alas, I spent my money and got seasons 1-6 on Blu-ray. Then, to my astonishment, many fans were dismayed, including me, that Season 7 forward would not be released on Blu-ray. Well, fans of the series got the attention of Lionsgate and it
seemed they changed course and released 7 on that format. I did buy it at a higher price than the other 6 seasons. Near $30 for Season 7.
At least I have it on the format complimenting the other 6. I am a fan of Blu-ray and have built quite a library of my favorite movies and TV shows.
Well, with Season 8 looking like it's iffy on Blu-ray as of this writing, I leave a glimmer of hope that it does in the future. If that happens, I will get it on that format.
In the meantime, yes, I did purchase this set on DVD at my local retailer, on sale, for $12.99. I could not pass it up, since I do not have the season and it also included two of the movies I had not seen in at least 30 years since their release in the early '80s.
I played the entire season on a 55"" Vizio Ultra 4K. While it's not Blu-ray quality, it is decent and probably better than the other DVD sets that have come before years ago.
The entire set is 6 Discs, with the last one having two ""Little House"" movies.
The menus are decent for this set with a book opening up, listing this as ""Season 8, Disc 1"" etc. Selected ""scenes"" from the episodes are then shown as ""old moving pictures"" and the menu moves up, down, and across. You can select from EPISODES and SET UP for languages and subtitles fairly easily at bottom on each Disc.

Mr. Carter has a full wagon of Dynamite and the town ""rigs"" nearly all the main buildings for detonation before ""the land baron"" comes back with the U.S. Calvary. (The Very Last Episode of Little House On The Prairie, Season 9).

While I love having the Season 8 in it's entirety and fully restored and remastered here on DVD, the HD version is truly the way to go for all.
If some of you are not into buying the Blu-ray format and just want the series, I might suggest you look around your local retailers first. You may get a good deal like me.",1454630400,4,7393,4.267665952890792
7515250,1,B017RR78TY,"Was this just a strategy to make the star rating go up? Where did the Blu-ray go?! It's bad enough I had to wait till March 22 to watch it after finishing season 7 so long ago, now it's up in the air again?! What could be so hard, there are no extras or anything new at all going into this. The HD masters have been lying around for several years now. . . .

EDIT - Feb. 2016:
Forget it, I'm done. I just bought the DVD today, a six disc set at the ridiculously low price of $15. I'm disappointed to say it but I'm not counting on or waiting for the blu-rays any longer. In closing, I'll list the four times lionsgate shot themselves in the foot:

1: Stupidly low prices for multidisc Blu-ray sets. It's almost like they were trying to lose money with this one.

2: Canceling season 7 on blu ray and losing out on the sales from angry fans, instead of just raising the price.

3: Including 2 of the 3 Little House movies for free with season 8, instead of selling a separate movies collection after season 9, (if they even release that).

4: Announcing season 8 and then canceling it.

Where is the business sense? I'd settle for common sense.",1454025600,5,1143,4.19634703196347

7515252,4,B017RR78TY,"I don't really have much to say about this one.  I just love the show.  The one thing I do like is the packaging.  Since they've updated it, there's much less of it than the original releases.  The quality of the video is good and I'm very happy with it.",1453420800,,254,4.02
7515253,3,B017RR78TY,"Amazon needs to give us some more detail on these MOD releases.  While the Season 7 Blu-ray wasn't bad picture-wise, there was a huge drop in quality from the 5.1 lossless to the 2.0 soundtrack.  My wife said she noticed a 'slight dip' in Audio, but when I compared it to Season 2, I was dumbfounded by the loss of the immersive soundtrack that accompanied the amazing PQ.  Even amateur video recorders can make a 5.1 soundtrack, so I was surprised when Amazon didn't.

This being a 6-disc release, where the others were 5-disc, I was hoping the change would be the need for more space to include a 5.1 soundtrack.  Looking at other reviews, it seems the extra disc will include 2 of the 3 TV movies.  While that's a step in the right direction, I really think for the price they're asking, they could do better on the soundtrack and chapter stops (skip the intro theme and start at the beginning of the show, not a few minutes into it).  Static menu wasn't a show-stopper for me on Season 7, nor the loss of the UV code.  I just want to watch a show with the best PQ and AQ available.  They need to improve over Season 7.",1453075200,2,1122,4.304761904761905
7515254,4,B017RR78TY,"UPDATED April 22, 2016:
Like S7, the S8 blu is exclusive to Amazon. But it is overall better than S7. Lionsgate obviously did make at least some attempt to fix some of the glaring issues that were on S7 so they weren't on S8.

As compared to S7:

1) Subtitles are now in sync
2) French/Spanish audio tracks are now better in sync. I'm not sure they're perfect, but they're a lot closer.
3) There are now chapter stops after the opening theme like S1-6 had.
4) All the episodes are actually uncut. With S7, there was one episode (the divorce one) that was not.
5) There's the 2 movie special features whereas S7 gave us nothing. Since we didn't have any word from Lionsgate, we were all just hoping that the blu would contain the 2 movies like the DVD had. It's nice to know that hope was not in vain.
6) The video bitrates are overall higher. Whereas S7 seemed to top out at them targeting 35GB/disc, with S8 they've targeted more about 40-45GB/disc, netting higher bitrates.  14 of the episodes have an overall bitrate of about 25mbps, but 8 eps and the 2 movies are about 31mbps. All together averaged out this season has higher bitrates than S5, 6, or 7 had.  Not that this necessarily translates into a better picture - see below.
7) The video quality is overall better than S7. This wasn't a blu problem but a source problem with S7 where several episodes exhibited a more faded look (was same on DVD/streaming). With S8, while there's still sometimes a trace of that, it's much better.

With all that said, the quality of the video, while being overall better than S7 since it doesn't have the faded-look problem that some of S7 had, is still a small step down from S1-6.  It generally has more grain (or compression artifacts, I'm not honestly sure which it is...).  I've compared with the Digital HD streaming and the streaming, while not having nearly as high bitrates, appears to not have the same degree of this and honestly to my eyes overall looks slightly better, which is something I never thought regarding S1-6.  However, it still looks pretty good on Blu and better than the DVD counterpart (and certainly lightyears better than the old DVD).

The audio is still 448k DD just like S7 - and just like S7, the audio is mastered too high producing occasionally annoying clipping effects. I really do wish they would have fixed that but like S7, it's workable. Overall it sounds fine and isn't worth getting too worked up over.  (And just as an aside but they fixed this for S9 so only S7&8 have this issue).

Regarding the special features, I am grateful they are putting the movies as special features rather than trying to make us pay for them separately (as was the case with the old DVD's). That's not to say it's not weird because it is both because all of the movies take place timeline-wise after season 9, and also because they put ""The Last Farewell"" on S8 and ""Bless All The Dear Children"" on S9 and any fan of the show knows that ""Last Farewell"" is the real end to the show.  Whatever you do, don't watch Last Farewell, or any of the movies actually, until AFTER you watch S9, and then the order to watch is ""Look Back to Yesterday"", ""Bless All The Dear Children, and finally ""The Last Farewell"".

Speaking of ""Last Farewell"", there is a problem at the end of it where the audio on the hymn when the townspeople are marching and singing together at the end is VERY low, which is disappointing given that it's basically the closing triumphant scene of the entire show and it loses some of its punch because of this. The Spanish and French audio tracks do NOT have this problem (and both contain the song sung in English) so one could alternatively switch over to them when it starts and stay until the end of the show since there's no more dialogue.  I have no idea how/why that got messed up during the remaster process (it was fine on the old DVD).

All in all, this release delivers all the episodes uncut in HD quality and while flawed, is at least a step up from the S7 blu.",1452816000,11,4004,4.45827633378933

I gave away my old dvd set when season 1 was released because I was under the assumption the entire series would come out on bluray.

7515290,4,B017RR78TY,"UPDATED January 15, 2016:

The season 8 Blu Ray was just announced, which is a good thing for many of us who were long time Blu Ray LHOP buyers and were let down by Lionsgate when they decided to no longer release seasons in this format.  After much outcry from the public, Lionsgate relented and threw us a bone. Still, many of us were still a bit cynical and doubted the last 2 seasons would see the light of day on Blu Ray.  Lionsgate jumping in to announce the release of season 8 on Blu Ray, so soon after releasing season 7 on this format, should do much to assuage buyer remorse and encourage people to indeed get the rest of this series in this format and, for those who have been holding back from the start, to go ahead and buy the series.

Meanwhile, season 7 was released on Blu Ray and while we got a bit slapped on the face, at least we got it.  The video quality is down from 30 mbps to 18-20 mpbs but this changes on the last three discs.  Overall, we can handle it.  Audio has gone down from DTS-HD to Dolby 2.0.  No slipcase, no decent menu with scene selection, bookmarks or anything too flashy and no HD Digital Streaming.  Season 8 will probably be on these lines, but by now we're more accustomed and the star rating should go up.",1449619200,12,1252,4.205020920502092

Just like many others viewers of L.H., I was disappointed that Lionsgate did not plan to release the last 3 seasons on Blu-ray. However, I want to state this; I would rather have this show in its UNEDITED form on DVD than not have it at all. Yes, there are some differences in the Blu-ray and DVD qualities, especially the bigger screen you have. As for me, I would rather get to watch scenes from this show that I have not seen since the original broadcasts in the 70's and 80's. If Lionsgate had released L.H. ONLY in DVD form, but with all scenes intact, I would have bought every set. Compared to the former Imavision releases on DVD, there is no comparison. When I watch the recent released DVDs, I feel like I am watching a new show, because so many scenes were restored and added back in! Tvshowsondvd.com just released the new about Season 8 a few days ago, and this set will include the movie The Last Farewell and one other movie.
