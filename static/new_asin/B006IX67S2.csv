8498988,5,B006IX67S2,"This K-Drama surprised me. It is actually a very sad story with no happy ending as one would expect at the beginning of the story. But sad as it is, the ending is satisfying.

While watching this K-Drama, at each episode, it made me keep thinking ""Who are the monsters?"" And the answer, to me, is: the humans. They belittle and use other creatures that are different, they betray them, deceive them; call them monsters and kill them... according to their convenience and their evil souls

And the ending of this drama made complete sense. How great the Gumiho was; how ""human"". She turned out to be better than any human, exception made, maybe, for the only human who truly loved her in spite of her being different and protected her to the end and to whom she was not even given the chance to properly thank him.",1493856000,,813,4.486486486486487
