I saw it on my shelf the other day and wondered whether I should see it again when I'm more ""up.""  Think not, it might take me down again.  The man (the 5th monkey) did not seem as empathetic with the other four or particularly interested in what would happen to them.  The sex scenes with the snake were ancillary, dragged out and unappealing.  I'm sorry to write this because before I saw it I was looking forward to it and I like Ben Kingsley in other movies.  Maybe it's one of those that is worth looking at just for the experience, and you might like it as much as the person who urged me to watch.",1362787200,,734,4.313868613138686
