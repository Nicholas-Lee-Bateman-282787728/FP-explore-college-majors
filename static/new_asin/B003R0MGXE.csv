4174586,2,B003R0MGXE,"This movie is so bad that it is enjoyable.  I think it is making fun of itself.  And some of the dialogue was great.  I got a kick out of the middle aged actors playing in a traditional college road trip horror flick.  I wish it had taken itself a little more seriously in the action parts.  It was both really bad, and I liked it.",1410652800,5,331,3.9545454545454546

4174614,1,B003R0MGXE,I thought there was something wrong with my tv. The sound kept going up and down and when something is going to happen it's so loud is ridiculous. Also the acting sucked.,1474761600,,170,4.34375

4174636,3,B003R0MGXE,Well I give this film one thing. At least we didn't have the college age doooch bags and bimbos.. instead fat middle age men and their aging wives..and the twist was OK.,1473638400,,169,4.3125

8402938,3,B003R0MGXE,"This movie was okay, it was a bit choppy and looked like it was shot with a cheap camera but all in all it kelp me guessing and entertained. I didn't think the husband had something to do with it till his wife died, the drive home. and the meat incident. * I only wish I knew how he got the jump on the C.I.A lady and the lady at the end.",1508889600,,338,3.7083333333333335
8402939,5,B003R0MGXE,"Stopped dead was a darker movie than I expected but very much enjoyable. The characters on a vacation to a psychological hell were deep and fully developed. I got the very real sense that the director spent a lot of time drawing out these characters on paper, figuring out their complications and backgrounds and weaknesses. I think it pays off well.  The plot itself had a way of taunting and teasing to an end that should have been obvious to me, but I was kept guessing.  Acting was excellent. Overall a very satisfying movie.",1498694400,,529,4.617021276595745
