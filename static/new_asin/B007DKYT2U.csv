8570401,4,B007DKYT2U,"This is a highly controversial view of the history of the so called forgotten genocide of Armenians in Anatolia, and Turkey generally, during those years, particularly 1915 to 1920. It is hard to find a middle ground in this issue since so many perished on both sides, Armenian Christian and Turkish Muslim. Probably most documentaries take the view that the Turkish Administration of 1909 used the events of WW1 as an excuse to unleash an unheralded program of extermination on the non Turkish citizens of the crumbling Ottoman empire. They used such methods as rounding up and deporting all Armenians Eastwards towards arid deserts on death marches, enslaving young girls and battles followed by mass exterminations. This has been accurately documented extensively by European diplomats, protestant missionaries and German military observing, and overwhelmed, by the scale of the tragedy.  In many cases the archives of these witness testimonies has only recently been open to view by the general public. It sounds like and in fact was a model for the German Holocaust of the 1940s, Hitler openly stated his admiration of their methods and goals, noting that the Pasha administration got away with it, so why not an extermination of the Jews?
  When we come to this documentary, if its research is trustworthy, we have to reckon with the fact that in some way, the Armenian provoked and instigated this terrible act of genocide by their own deliberate acts of terrorism and systematic slaughter of muslims in towns around Eastern Anatolia, especially around Lake Van and up into the Caucasus. They were in some ways encouraged to do this by Western and Russian support, but then left to their own fate as their dreams of a separate Armenian State failed, crumbled and disappeared. The modern state of Turkey slowly emerged from the wreckage of the Ottoman Empire after WW1. The Armenian uprising could not have been more poorly timed or more doomed to failure given the size out power of Turkey at that time. The Armenian revolutionaries were not fighting a conventional territorial war of attrition, like the Western Front, but a vicious war of extermination where the main victims were  muslim civilians, they estimate about 600,000. If this is the case, we are dealing with two genocides with both sides blaming the other for provoking or instigating it. Did the Turks, enraged by losses of huge chunks of their territory in North Africa, and Eastern Europe plus the Caucasus, blame and scapegoat the Armenians for all of it, the Armenians subsequently fighting a hopeless war of defence and reprisal? Or did the Armenian revolutionaries utilise European revolutionary philosophies and rely on unprovoked violence to bully and break away from a lazy and inept Ottoman Empire?
 I hope that some day this discussion will result in a spirit of reconciliation between these peoples. Obviously, the Armenians are the big losers out of these events, but they have crimes that they need to address and acknowledge, as much as the Turks. Those who live by the sword, will die by the sword!",1511740800,,3086,5.031311154598826
