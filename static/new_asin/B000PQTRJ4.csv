These videos are so well-done that they are awe-inspiring to all ages, building faith simultaneously with  scientific knowledge.  My youngest son is now 22 and I just discovered he has put the Moody set on his Wish-list. Now THAT says something about the videos' impact. They are timeless and truly a treasure!",1294963200,5,369,4.919354838709677

These videos have a great way of presenting the amazing wonders of nature and God's handywork all around us. I am very glad I purchased the entire set!!!",1268006400,3,288,4.5576923076923075
