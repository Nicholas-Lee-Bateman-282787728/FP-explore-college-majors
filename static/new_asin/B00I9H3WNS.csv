6254380,4,B00I9H3WNS,"This set of three DVD's from GO Entertainment, AISN # B00I9H3WNS, contains Buster Crabbe's 1940 serial ""Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe,"" and the following 13 episodes of the 1954-55 Flash Gordon television program starring Steve Holland, numbered in the order in which they were transmitted over the DuMont network:

 1.  Flash Gordon and the Planet of Death
 5.  Akim the Terrible
 6.  The Claim Jumpers
 8.  The Breath of Death
10.  The Return of the Androids
17.  The Lure of Light
19.  Flash Gordon and the Race against Time
21.  The Brain Machine
22.  Struggle to the End
24.  Saboteurs from Space
25.  The Forbidden Experiment
36.  Deadline at Noon
39.  The Subworld Revenge

The discs come in a ""spindle-pack"" of the standard 14mm width; at first I thought there was only one disc in it.

Those unfamiliar with the Steve Holland program should be warned that like other 1950's television space operas it was cheaply made, with production values far below those of Buster Crabbe's serials.  Those who wasted their youth watching Tom Corbett, Space Cadet or Rocky Jones, Space Ranger should understand; these were fine before NASA started live television coverage of their space missions.  It was initially produced in Germany, where aside from the principal characters most of the actors spoke little if any English, and while the episodes made later in France have less of this problem, the low budget remains evident.  Note also that the transmission order is not the same as the order in which the episodes were produced.  The plots have some interesting ideas, if logic and scientific facts were not a priority, and the acting of the principal characters isn't bad.  The action has been shifted forward in time to the 31st century, with Flash (Steve Holland), Dale Arden (Irene Champlin) and Dr. Zarkov (Joe Nash) employed by the Galaxy Bureau of Investigation, fighting an amazing array of cheaply-costumed evil life-forms.  Less than half of the original 39 episodes are known to exist, and many of these only in secondary copies with defects such as the image being a little blurry and too large for the screen.  Most of the prints have had the cast lists removed, as well as the credits for ""special guest"" actors right before the episode itself, causing a glitch at the start of the narrated introduction.  The DVD transfer quality is adequate, the sound reasonably clear, with most of the problems due to the source material.

The familiar 1940 serial looks a lot better than the TV episodes, both as a production and in image quality, but there are some minor video artifacts that aren't in other editions.  Far worse transfers are out there, but those primarily interested in the serial would do better with the Image/Madacy set, ASIN: B00A04YHI2 which includes Buster Crabbe's other two Flash Gordon serials.

While all the material here is available in other editions, GO Entertainment's set contains generally good transfers, and is a low-cost way to get both the 1940 serial and a large sample of the 1950's television program.",1442448000,21,3053,4.939096267190569

8640118,1,B00I9H3WNS,"There's a reason why this is $3.  The Flash Gordon serial is JUST Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe and nothing else.  It's okay, but I wish I had looked closer in what was being offered.  I was under the impression all the serials and the TV series was here.  That's not the case.  The TV show, though, is almost unwatchable.  Both sound and visuals are garbled and it actually hurts to watch.  But at least it was cheap, I guess.",1519862400,3,432,4.325
