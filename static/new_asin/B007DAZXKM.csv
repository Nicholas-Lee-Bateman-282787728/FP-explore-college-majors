5079087,5,B007DAZXKM,"Good DVD to follow. Anne talks slowly and her DVD is easy to follow. I have lost 99 lbs. over the last 12 yrs. 81 of those lbs. over the last 2 years. I have all her DVD's and enjoy everyone. I have bad knees and I know my limits.
Thanks Anne,
Joyce M.",1427328000,6,252,3.685185185185185
5079088,3,B007DAZXKM,"I have mixed feelings about this DVD.  Anne's exercises are very sensible and strengthening, and I can see that they will accomplish the purpose for which I bought the DVD.  Her DVDs are not strenuous, but they do what they're designed to do, and the music is not too loud, for which I'm grateful. As far as the film production is concerned, not so much.  The sound quality goes from loud to soft and back again, and there are some places where the film does not flow from one scene to the other seamlessly.  If that doesn't bug you too much, then I would recommend this item.",1426464000,7,576,4.355140186915888
5079089,5,B007DAZXKM,I think Ms Burnell is one of the best instructors. I have all her discs except the new one that remains unavailable.,1424995200,,116,4.318181818181818
5079090,5,B007DAZXKM,My 73 yr old buddy and I have gone thru this several times - great for us elders!,1424044800,,81,3.5555555555555554
5079091,5,B007DAZXKM,Excellant workout for seniors.  I feel it is very beneficial.,1421712000,,61,5.1
5079092,5,B007DAZXKM,"I am just starting to use this program,  So far, it is great.  I would highly recommend it to Seniors that can't do regular exercises.",1380499200,5,134,4.32
5079093,5,B007DAZXKM,Balance and posture are most important for us as we get older.  I love Anne Pringle Burnell's approach to this much needed exercise.,1377561600,7,132,4.739130434782608
5079094,5,B007DAZXKM,Excellent presenter-effective moves-just the right sequences and repetitions. She is not patronizing and her voice is soothing. She does not treat her participants like kindergartners.,1376092800,8,184,6.4
5079095,4,B007DAZXKM,I have purchased all of Anne Burnell's Senior DVD's. All are excellent. This is a bit faster than the others. You would have to build up your strength by using her other DVD's prior to this intermediate exercises.,1458345600,,213,4.631578947368421
5079096,2,B007DAZXKM,I dislike the tape because Ann Pringle has a dull voice that doesn't get one motivated.,1455753600,,87,4.5
5079097,4,B007DAZXKM,"i like anything that anne burnell does with the exercise discs.  i'm recovering from double knee replacement so this is good; but one must be careful.  It's good for the posture and balance.  she has other discs that are very good, too.",1455580800,4,236,4.571428571428571
5079098,4,B007DAZXKM,The DVD is adequate.  Ann's other ones are better.  It does provide a change because the exercises are somewhat different.  For people who do not have her other ones I would recommend one of them.,1455580800,2,196,4.542857142857143
5079099,5,B007DAZXKM,It seems very good,1454889600,,18,3.75
5079100,5,B007DAZXKM,"Whatever Ann Pringle Burnell does for seniors is always helpful and effective.  The CD does not seem to be as polished as the other CD's in the presentation and content. But still, it is quite useful and I shall use it as part of the repetoire of a group of CD's that I use and alternate for my physical well being",1445472000,2,314,4.147540983606557
5079101,1,B007DAZXKM,This DVD is of poor quality and needs to be updated. The other DVD's by Anne are well thought out and good for seniors or anyone who is convalescing.,1442793600,,149,4.172413793103448
5079102,5,B007DAZXKM,"I just purchased this one, and the toning ball video.  Great!  Thanks Anne!",1438992000,,75,4.6923076923076925

8514921,5,B007DAZXKM,Very nice!,1496534400,,10,4.5
8514922,4,B007DAZXKM,"I must agree with some of the other reviews, this is not one of her most polished DVDs.  However, as I already have her other DVDs, I am able to follow her instructions and enjoy doing so.  IF she ever ""cleans-up"" this DVD, I would most certainly like to have/get one.",1495411200,,268,4.235294117647059
8514923,5,B007DAZXKM,"I love this DVD.  Though the sound quality is NOT THE BEST, I did not buy it for sound quality.  I bought it for the exercises and I believed they have helped my balance and posture.  So, if the sound quality can be overlooked I would recommend the DVD for the selection of exercises",1495324800,,283,4.203703703703703
8514924,5,B007DAZXKM,"All of her videos are excellent for people who are out of shape and unable to do vigorous exercises. You can also adapt them to your ability level.  Highly recommend every one of them. This one is great for anyone who has balance problems, whether due to age or disability or inner ear issues.",1490486400,,293,4.425925925925926
8514925,4,B007DAZXKM,Great exercise for my seniors at the assisted living facility that I work at.,1486771200,,77,4.571428571428571
8514926,4,B007DAZXKM,good for those who need this type of help,1476921600,,41,3.6666666666666665
8514927,5,B007DAZXKM,"Love these exercise videos, they move at a perfect pace for us ""older folk"" and are relaxing and invigorating at the same time....",1471737600,,130,4.695652173913044
8514928,2,B007DAZXKM,"The exercise program is good, but the video and sound quality is poor.  The volume needs to be adjusted several times throughout the video.  When the view changes, the movement timing is off.  I have several other of these videos and the quality is excellent.",1467763200,,259,4.711111111111111
8514929,5,B007DAZXKM,Great,1459123200,,5,5.0
8514930,1,B007DAZXKM,"I am very disappointed in this. I have exercised to her other dvds and liked them, so I ordered a few to use at my church. This was the first to arrive. There seem to be three cameras and whenever the shots were used from the front camera, everything is fine. But whoever edited in the other camera angles did the worst job ever. The voice gets very low, and the exercises are out of sync. So you have your exercise rhythm wrong every time it switches back and forth. And the one camera angle is totally out of focus. Personally, I would never have let this one on the market with this poor of quality. I can't even use it with the older women. I will be returning it. Hope the other dvds are better.",1458691200,,700,4.154411764705882
