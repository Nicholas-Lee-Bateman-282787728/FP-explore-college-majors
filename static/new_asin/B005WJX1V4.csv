8487937,5,B005WJX1V4,"We showed this movie to our AWANA students when we kicked off a canned good drive we are doing for the Salvation Army. This movie really helped them understand what we are trying to accomplish. It is not the best quality, but the message comes through very clearly. This movie did a great job teaching on the history of William Booth and the Salvation Army.",1349222400,2,357,4.507692307692308

I also appreciate the worksheets, leaders guide and addtional information that is included which made my teaching session so much easier.  I also purchased 2 other DVDs from Torchlighters which I intend to use in future classes.  Thanks so much.",1342051200,,434,5.084507042253521
