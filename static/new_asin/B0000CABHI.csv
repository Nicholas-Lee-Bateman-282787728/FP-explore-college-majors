I admit normally this would be frustrating and a problem, however when you start to get it it is so rewarding. This show is so good it creates a desire to have a deeper understanding of the world and does not feel like a chore at all. And trust me, I hate learning new things.
When you can explain the difference between Keiki and Renrin, and why they are names what they are, you are winning!",1357862400,,541,4.161904761904762
7998414,4,B0000CABHI,"The first story arc of The Twelve Kingdoms comes to an end as Youko tries to sort out her destiny. Does she return to Japan and leave the land of Kei, the land she was destined to rule, to suffer? Or does she stay in this world and give up all chance to see her family and restart her life? The first episode tells the story of the origin of the King of En and how his Kirin, who were both lost as Taika, came to return to the Twelve Kingdoms. Then it's on to the final confrontation with King Kou, and the decision that Sujimoto must make between her delusional fantasies of being the chosen one or to accept her real life. The last episode on the disk is simply a recap of all the previous episodes.

This volume was a little weaker than the others simply because of the recap episode. I did enjoy the fact that Sujimoto made the best decision that she could. These characters EVOLVE. They are not static. They become better people. They have regrets. They have conflict, and they don't always make the best decisions. The cast are living breathing souls, no matter the exotic plot. I'm excited to see where this series goes in the next story arc.

I would also recommend Escaflowne, an anime similar in plot but inferior to this series.",1119052800,,1239,4.359307359307359
7998415,4,B0000CABHI,"The first arc is wrapped up in this volume. Yoko confronts Sugimoto for the last time. At the end of this DVD, one girl gains a kingdom in ruins, and the other the ruins of a self-delusion. Both do a lot of growing up (about time!), and both become more likeable characters in the process--particularly Sugimoto. Sugimoto ends the arc on a tantalizing cliff-hanger which provides a nice entry into the second arc.
One thing: ep. 11-12 don't really involve Yoko. These two eps. tell the story of how a quick-witted 16th century Japanese pirate ""King"" was chosen to be the Emperor of En. Very good couple of episodes actually.
BTW, fans of Rakushun (that adorable rat-boy) can look forward to some sweet moments strewn throughtout these eps., in which he lends Yoko his political support, as well as his particular blend of practical wisdom.",1080172800,,839,4.793103448275862
7998416,4,B0000CABHI,"Dont get me wrong, I love the show, however, this volume, while being good, is not quite as good as the first two volumes.  One episode is the reasoning behind my giving this volume four stars.  One episode of the disc serves not only as a filler, which is common for many anime dvds, but as a series recap.  Not even 20 episodes into the series and already a series recap.  My personal opinion is that a series recap should not be done unless a minimum of 50 episodes have been produced beforehand.  Not only did I find it quite annoying that such an episode had already made it's way into the series, but also found this episode to be incredibly boring.  The episode at times seemed rushed, while at others dragged on and on in a seemingly never ending borefest for the ages.  For a recap episode and thats saying allot considering recaps are meant to fill an individual in on the prior occurances of the series.",1077062400,,914,4.404761904761905
7998417,5,B0000CABHI,"With the third volume of the Twelve Kingdoms, the first arc comes to a close.  I was very excited to get this volume after seeing the events of disc 2. With this volume Youko decides to face her destiny but she is now blocked by Sugimoto and King Kou.  The outcome of this confrontation  will decide these three individuals fate.  What I really like about this series is how well they reveal to the viewer the motivations of the characters all while keeping the story interesting. This series has instantly become a favorite of mind and I recommend this series to all anime fans.",1076112000,,579,4.538461538461538
7998418,5,B0000CABHI,"Twelve Kingdoms represents a singularly brilliant accomplishment in the world of anime. Incredibly addictive and wonderfully crafted, this is unequivocally the best anime series I've seen.

I can make this assertion with conviction, as I've watched all 45 episodes of the Japanese language version of 12K. (And I couldn't wait to purchase the English language releases!) The story of the Twelve Kingdoms evolves beautifully, maturing into a surpassing fantasy epic that stands head and shoulders above the overwhelming majority of anime series. Similarly, Youko, the show's protagonist, ultimately develops into one of the greatest and most compelling heroines in anime history.
Twelve Kingdoms, Grave Of The Fireflies and the Ruruoni Kenshin/Samurai X Trust and Betrayal OVAs are now the touchstones by which I judge other anime works. Stick with this fascinating saga to its conclusion and you'll be immensely rewarded!",1073088000,3,921,5.578571428571428
7998419,4,B0000CABHI,"This set of episodes complete a story arc - the accession of Youko Nakajima to the throne of Kei.  There are quite a few roadblocks in her path, the worst of which is her own reluctance to believe in her own capabilities.  As I mentioned in my review of the first episodes, Youko's insecurities and need for approval are her own worst enemy, and very nearly ruined the story for me.
But she has grown considerably.  So much so that Yuka Sugimoto, her close friend when she was in Japan and her enemy in the lands of the 12 Kingdoms, suddenly sees why it is Youko and not Yuka that should be the queen of Kei.  That, and the very good advice provided by Rakashun, her rat man companion, finally lead Youko to set about claiming her throne from the imposter who currently holds it - and freeing Keiki, her Taiho as well.
And so, with the aid of Shouryuu, the King of En, the final stanzas of this phase come to an end.  But have no fear, this is only the first chapter in a story which currently stretches over 45 episodes in Japan.  After a rocky start, and the daunting complexities of a world that was created with the same level of complexity as Tolkein's, the series has finally reached a level of maturity that makes it worth watching.
I'm not sure why the series has been rated 13 and up.  There is a minimum of violence, and no profanity to speak of in the episodes so far.  In many ways it deals with issues of self-definition and the nature of responsibility that are important at any age.  And as is the case with Rakashun, cultural diversity and prejudice are also explored.  Which, to me, makes this an excellent family film.
In any case, I urge the potential watcher to avoid judging the series based on the initial episodes.  As this DVD proves, Twelve Kingdoms has quite a bit to offer.",1072396800,6,1800,4.375375375375375
