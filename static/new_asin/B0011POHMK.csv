8242113,4,B0011POHMK,"I recently purchased this set from Amazon but found that there was no disc inside the cover for ""Invisible-The Chronicles of Benjamin"" - which, unfortunatetly for me, was the ongoing movie from ""Mandroid"" - which I thought was well made.  The set was sealed when it arrived and the other discs play OK. To their credit - Amazon agreed to refund the costs involved but I have written to the distributor to let them know of my disappointment. Hopefully, this situation can be corrected.",1388880000,,484,4.761904761904762
8242114,2,B0011POHMK,"Although I like the movies in this collection as well as many other Full Moon features, the product arrived in poor condition. The only DVD the was not scratched was ""Robot Wars"". Thankfully, that's the movie I really wanted. The DVD ""Invisible"" was missing altogether, yet it was replaced by a second copy of ""Mandroid"". The other copy of ""Mandroid"" is so badly scratched, it is not viewable. ""Dark Angel"" was scratched, but after some cleaning, it was viewable. The final DVD ""Lurking Fear"" is also scratched, but I hope it will be salvageable with some cleaning. I like Full Moon's movies, but this product arrived in inexcusably poor condition. I'd give it a D-.",1317168000,,666,4.8
8242115,4,B0011POHMK,"I love Full Moon movies, so when I saw that they were coming out with Full Moon Classics vol. 2 I was excited. Although the movies aren't quite as good as the ones in the first volume it's still a good set.

Lurking Fear (1994) starring Jeffery Combs, Ashley Laurence, and Blake Bailey is a fun action-filled horror movie. This is definitely the best movie in the set. This movie takes place in a town that's overran by evil beings, only the doctor (Combs), a distraught sister (Laurence), and a pregnant woman remain. Then a man (Bailey), looking for his family fortune, shows up with criminals on his tail. This movie is actually really good, it's full of gore and it has Jeffery Combs!

Robot Wars (1993) starring Don Michael Paul and Barbara Crampton is a amusing sci-fi action movie, the character are all really funny and likable. The movie takes place in the year 2041 where an archeologist (Crampton) uncovers an evil plot and with the help of a robot pilot (Paul) and his funny sidekick they try to save mankind.

Dark Angel: The Ascent (1994) starring Angela Featherstone and Daniel Markel is a gory horror movie about a demon that escapes hell. She becomes a vigilante and kills wrong doers. She meets a doctor and falls in love with him. This movie is pretty good, I liked the two detectives but it does seem to take itself more seriously than the rest.

Mandroid (1993) starring Brian Cousins, Jane Caldwell, and Michael Della Femina is an action adventure movie with a ""mandroid."" A Romanian scientist and his daughter are working to develop something called Super-con. Their partner, Drago, decides to steal it and is harmed in the process. Mandroid is a pretty good movie, I enjoyed it.

Invisible: The Chronicles of Benjamin Knight (1994) starring Brian Cousins and Michael Della Femina is the sequel to Mandroid. Basically, the characters that survived the last on are in this one as well. It's the worst movie in the set, in my opinion. The villains are too out there, especially the mental patients, and the script is pretty bad.

Overall, a good set. Not nearly as good as Vol. 1 but for Full Moon fans it still is a lot of fun to watch. As for extras each movie contains a behind the scene videozone and like Full Moon Classics Vol. 1 it is region free.",1217894400,15,2275,4.618811881188119
8242116,4,B0011POHMK,"My favorite movie in this set was Dark Angel. It's a very original concept and it was very enjoyable. That movie alone is worth the price of buying this set.

Lurking Fear was my second favorite movie in this set.",1215993600,3,213,4.325
