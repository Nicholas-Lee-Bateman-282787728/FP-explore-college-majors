The only problem that I had was in turning on the correct close captioning. Once I figured that out, it was easy to watch (4 times already).",1479081600,,269,4.4

8402094,5,B003Q3F0WQ,I do not usually like watching foreign films with English subtitles but I found this film to be very funny. Some may find the humour to be silly but it amused me. I enjoyed this film and the second followup so much that I bought the dvds!,1458172800,,238,4.085106382978723
8402095,5,B003Q3F0WQ,"This is a sequel that is actually funnier than the original. Both of them should be bought at once. The second film is a continuation of the first, with the same characters in it. There are some new characters in it. The whole movie is just plain fun. It's in subtitles, but it's a shame that this movie isn't more widely available in North America. We had no problem playing the Blu-Ray on our machine here. Blu-Ray is more universal.",1429315200,,435,4.45
8402096,5,B003Q3F0WQ,"This is a sequal and it is just as fun as the first!  I don't speak German, but I was able to play this on my computer just fine when I was asked to input the Region Code.  The subtitles are easy to read and follow along with the movie.  All of the Dwarves are great - really funny comedians, plus NINA HAGEN (the Mother of Punk Rock) is excellent as is Nina's daughter Cosma Shiva Hagen as Snow White (she is a beauty).  I wish this movie had been dubbed in English - Nina and Cosma speak English for sure; but it is worth watching with subtitles if one needs to.  I LOVE THIS MOVE!!!  I also ordered the first movie, 7 Zwerge - Men Alone in the Woods (2004).",1396569600,,660,4.0
8402097,5,B003Q3F0WQ,"I was happy to see that the blu-ray came on time and in great condition! It played well, so far I have no complaints I'm satisfied with what I bought.",1325289600,,150,4.033333333333333
8402098,5,B003Q3F0WQ,Just watched this on Netflix. This was one of the funniest things I have ever seen!  If you love spoofs you will love this!,1282348800,3,123,4.125
