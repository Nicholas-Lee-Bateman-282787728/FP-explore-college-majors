1810469,5,B00007G78A,"A great DVD collection for western fans. My particular favorite is The Daughters Of Joshua Cabe. Originally a television film it stars Sandra Dee, Karen Valentine, Lesley Ann Warren, and Buddy Ebsen. Really a good comedy western. So happy it is available. The seven other films range from comedy to spaghetti westerns and your enjoyment will center on the actors and action you prefer. Again I am thrilled this rare Sandra Dee television film has finally been released on DVD. The picture looks better than it did on television when I first saw it in 1972.",1362441600,41,556,4.802083333333333

""Young Pioneers,"" from producer Ed Friendly (he's best known for creating ""Rowan & Martin's Laugh In""),
served as a pilot to the 1978 TV series of the same name.

""Joshua Cabe"" is an Aaron Spelling/Leonard Goldberg production. Spelling also produced ""Wild Women.""

From executive producer David L. Wolper, ""I Will Fight No More"" tells the story of Nez Perc&eacute; Indian Chief Joseph and his tribe's nearly four month retreating skirmish against ten units of the U.S. Army. Rather than be confined to a reservation far from their Wallowa Valley homes, they led Gen. Oliver Howard's men on a 1700 mile chase, and gave up only when starvation, sickness and exhaustion overcame them.

1810710,5,B00007G78A,great variety,1406505600,,13,6.0
1810711,2,B00007G78A,Undeniably good value for money but the degree of compression used to get all eight  films on two DVDs means that quality suffers. I have only watched two so far. The first was distinctly fuzzy compared to normal DVD quality and that is on an upscaling player using an 1080p connection. The second was also fuzzy (as they all will be I am sure) but the sound was also out of synch with the picture.,1406505600,25,398,4.306666666666667
1810712,5,B00007G78A,A good set of films with an excellant price.,1406419200,,44,4.0

1810715,5,B00007G78A,"What can I say, anything Sam Elliott is in is going to be good.  One of the best western actors ever. Love his voice",1405468800,,116,3.8333333333333335
1810716,4,B00007G78A,"I gave this movie 4 stars because most of them were good, but not my favorite Sam Elliott. I am collecting  his movies",1402358400,,118,4.130434782608695
1810717,4,B00007G78A,"This is a really good collection of some kind of 'off-beat' westerns. I enjoyed them & found them a nice change of pace from your typical western - particularly ""Daughters of Joshua Cabe"" (Lesley Anne Warren is yummy!)",1401667200,,218,4.7631578947368425
1810718,5,B00007G78A,Multiple movies on one DVD is a fine way to increase your library.  These movies are good.  I will watch them many times.,1400889600,,121,4.217391304347826
1810719,5,B00007G78A,Sam Elliot is one of my favorite actors but all the movies are good classic westerns to watch when TV has so few worth watching,1398988800,,127,4.12

1810731,1,B00007G78A,Was not what expected.  Poor westerns and lacked the good acting I thought would be shown.  Thought Sam Elliott was in each movie.  Only one Elliott movie is included.  Generally disappointed.,1398470400,,192,5.096774193548387
1810732,5,B00007G78A,I found the pack to be most enjoyable.any one who enjoy westerns will be pleased with this pack. Try it I think you will like it,1397779200,,128,3.9615384615384617

1810734,1,B00007G78A,"These movies appear to be foreign made and pitiful at that.  It is very misleading with the cover.
I would not recommend.",1395878400,,121,4.5
1810735,1,B00007G78A,Grade C movies.  You can get better movies surfing free channels.  I thought this was a great deal but the movies are . . . cornball.,1395792000,,133,4.076923076923077

1810739,4,B00007G78A,This was a 50/50 set. half were really good other half were just ok. BUT if you are a Western fan you will LIKE this set. Its full of shot em up bang bang and horses and guns and wild west. Great for the Saturday when its rainy and you don't wanna go out. Just sit back and gear up for some good old fashion killin!,1391212800,,315,3.787878787878788
