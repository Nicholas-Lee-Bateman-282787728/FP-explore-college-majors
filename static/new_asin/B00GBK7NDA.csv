8622032,5,B00GBK7NDA,"Picture quality is quite good considering show was intended for small tv screens from the 80's and is now being viewed on a 55"" screen.  Very happy for English subtitles.  I'm just so grateful to have found the DVD set in the first place, so I'm doubly grateful for the quality of the set.  Highly recommend.  Thank you seller for making set available!!",1489708800,,353,4.555555555555555
