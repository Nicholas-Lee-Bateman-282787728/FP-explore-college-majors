1246653,1,B00001U0GS,"I'd like to review the content of the movie itself, but I have to start with one thing I can't get past at all, which is Zohra Lampert's Jessica.  It is one of the most off-putting performances I've ever seen, and it makes it almost impossible to concentrate on the plot.  She smiles at inappropriate moments, overacts when it isn't called for, and is understated when a little hysteria might be justified.  The rest of the time her face is completely blank, which is probably the scariest thing to be seen in the whole movie.  I'm not sure if these were purposeful acting choices to convey the mental instability her character has, but regardless I don't care to watch them.  I would also add that when she screams (which is often), it is surely one of the most grating things  a person can hear.

In all fairness the other actors don't do much better, but they also don't get the lion's share of screen time.  The plot itself is really nothing special (insanity and the supernatural; potentially unreliable narrators), nor does it make any logical sense within the subgenre it employs (SPOILER: A woman who drowned years ago survived as a vampire?  How?).  The only way any of this mess ties together is if we accept that none of it really happened, and if that's the case what do I need to watch it for?

I don't know: Is there something I'm missing?  There must be some reason why this film is so hyped in the horror community, but I'm sure not finding it within the movie.",1484179200,,1477,4.49063670411985

1246664,4,B00001U0GS,"Released in 1971, Lets Scare Jessica to Death chronicles events after the title character (Zohra Lampert) gets out of a mental institution and moves into an old house on coastal Connecticut with her husband (Barton Heyman) and a friend (Kevin O'Connor). There they discover a hippie-like squatter named Emily (Mariclare Costello) whom they eventually invite to stay because they all get along.  Jessica starts to hear voices as they catch wind of rumors of a drowning victim from 90 years earlier whos now a ghost or maybe even a vampire. Are the increasingly crazy happenings real or all in Jessicas mind?

This is a realistic mystery/horror movie in the mold of 1967s The Shuttered Room and 1962s Carnival of Souls. I mean realistic in the sense that the tone is believable. Its a low-key, haunting slow-burner, so if you want over-the-top, cartoony horror, look elsewhere.

Zohra Lampert is effective as the mentally unstable protagonist. The way the movie constantly looks into her thought-life and the uncertainties thereof is reminiscent of 1968s Rachel, Rachel. The theme is the hypnotic power of a woman, in this case a potentially evil woman. Reflect on Jessicas situation at the end. If she dares to speak out, who would believe her story?

The drowning victim from the 19th century was named Abigail. I bet this was where King Diamond got the name for his notable 1987 horror-metal concept album.

The movie runs 98 minutes and was in Connecticut, USA (Essex, Chester, East Haddam & Old Saybrook).

Upon entering the house, they encounter a young woman by the name of Emily(Mariclare Costello). Suddenly, Jessica begins to witness strange occurrences. Could these things be a figment of her imagination? Or is something truly sinister reaching from beyond the grave to claim her? And more importantly, will anyone believe her?-summary

Even though for the most part concerning the horror genre I mainly prefer slashers. I do have a very soft spot for the more cryptic narratives that are drenched in ambiance. The 1971 cult classic Let's Scare Jessica To Death is such a film. This well crafted gem directed by John Hancock promises so much and delivers in so many areas. This is easily amongst my favorite horror films ever, and for me, it gets better on repeated watches.

Let's Scare Jessica To Death is a supernatural horror film with psychological elements. It appears to explore one woman's descent into either madness, or quite possibly, portray her desperate battle against a supernatural force. The ambiguous storyline intends to keep the viewer in the dark, by providing small pieces to the puzzle, which by the end, causes the viewer to draw up their own conclusions.

Let's Scare Jessica To Death is impressive in its presentation. The film proves no matter how small the budget may be, if one has the imagination, then they can go a long way. I would like to start with the number one feature that grabbed my attention, and that would be the characters. The cast is amongst the films strong points for sure. When putting together a story with a creepy tone, there's an over-zealousness to create the creepy characters fitting for that particular setting. Many horror films have tried and failed in this department. A majority of the time, the characters would either feel incredibly cheesy, or just too unbelievable to be taken seriously. This is just not the case here with this film.

The entire cast is very well used, and almost everyone gives off a feel as if something just isn't right with them. This includes the main characters as well as the townsfolk. The people are especially strange with their rather dismissive behaviour. They make it no secret that the out of towners are not welcomed into their community, through their physical as well as spoken actions. The characters definitely work into the films mysterious atmosphere, creating an uneasy feeling for the viewer. This also plays into the films high suspense factor.

The film is heavily character driven, and I found the main character Jessica easy to feel for, yet strange and creepy in her on way. Her character drives the film, and she's put in positions where she must question her own sanity. The inner dialogue which is provided by her, is also coupled with ominous ""voices"" appearing to play tricks with her mind. The character named Emily, also plays a role in this. After a while, the mystery surrounding the aforementioned character begins to come clear, and the viewer soon understands that she poses a significant threat to Jessica.

The creepy and mysterious moments would have never worked as well, if not for the outstanding music score by Orville Stoeber. The BGM appears to fit properly with everything that takes place, and it heavily works into the creepy moments. The set pieces at times also plays a role in establishing a restless feeling.

If there was a ever a film that I would dare say is not for everyone, then it would definitely be this one. This film was meant for a specific audience. The storyline is incredibly vague and many things are not very clear. There are small pieces of background given but nothing is truly explained, instead, it's merely brushed upon. This style of non linear storytelling will not be too entertaining for those who need a straight-forward explanation for everything. If you're the type who needs answers for everything, as well as a fast paced narrative. Then more than likely this movie is not for you.

The film is not heavy on gore at all, and there isn't the slightest bit of nudity. The dialogue also isn't littered with profanity. I don't believe there was a single foul word tossed out there once. The acting was also very strong, with many of the characters turning in good performances. Many times their facial expressions told everything long before the dialogue came into the picture.

I have to come clean and admit that at one point, I didn't think too highly of Let's Scare Jessica To Death. I found that the mystery was too strong, and way too much was left up to ones own interpretation. In truth, I just didn't completely get it; but I now see what the film is about thanks to multiple and open minded re-watches. Now, I enjoy the fact that things aren't very clear. Therefore, I can understand anyone who comes away not caring for it. I think this film will only appeal to those type of viewers whom like to think about what they just saw. If this sounds like your cup of blood then it just might be. The film has an 88 minute run time.

Pros: Creepy, very well directed and acted, strong characters, atmospheric, music

Cons: Somewhat questionable, will have some saying ""huh?""",1412294400,2,5411,4.820043103448276

It really is tough trying to nail down what makes ""Let's Scare Jessica to Death"" work.....but there's just something so unsettling and creepy about the entire film, it just draws you in and you can't turn it off.

The basic storyline is that a Jessica and her husband, Duncan, have left New York City for a small farm in Connecticut. Jessica has recently been released from a mental instution after some sort of breakdown. Along for the ride is a family friend, Woody, who plans on helping Jessica and Duncan around the apple orchard. When the trio arrive at the fog enshrouded, gothic farmhouse they find a drifter named Emily already living there. The foursome begin settling into the house, and odd things begin happening. Jessica begins to see and hear things, but is it all in her mind? They soon learn the farmhouse has a tragic past, with a young woman drowning on her wedding day, and tales of ghosts and vampires stalking the grounds.

As I stated above, I remember watching and being terrified by this movie as a little kid. Watching now in my 40's, and I have to say that it's still an effectively creepy film. Don't go into ""Let's Scare Jessica to Death"" looking for jump scares, thrills or chases by homicidal maniacs. Where ""Let's Scare Jessica..."" is in it's atmosphere. Imagine someone putting a nightmare on film. You are never on solid ground during the film, from the opening credits, you don't know what is real, what is only in Jessica's mind, and throbbing below it all is a tension that something is just not right.

1246689,5,B00001U0GS,"I first saw this movie in the early 70's when I was in high school.  Our local movie theater would have an occasional special Friday Night Frights night with one horror film after another screened into the wee hours to the delight of a large audience of pimply-faced teenagers.  My girlfriends and I  would come armed with pillows and slippers and comfy sweaters and eventually fall asleep in the old movie house chairs while watching one movie after another. I managed to stay awake for all of this one and its quiet creepiness stayed with me.  After watching Christopher Lee vamp and Peter Cushing sew up a Frankenstein's monster or two (not that I don't love all of the old Hammer gems!), this quiet movie disturbed me and I thought about it for many years.  When I finally bought the DVD, I found it still retained that sense of fear, disquiet, and creepiness that I remembered.  Perhaps it was because I was 15 when I first watched it, and that merely gore and lots of CGI just don't do it for me, but this quiet, creepy, low-budget movie still retains the low-key horror that I find more frightening than screaming and shouting horror.  During the 60's and 70's, people were ""getting back to the land', forming communes, and accepting strangers that they met along the way as friends.  This movie took elements of the lives of young people during this time and spun it into a disturbing ghost story. It sets the scene slowly and beautifully - the friends are driving a hearse, and they stop along the way to take rubbings of old graves.  Rarely does a modern movie build up the dread so delicately.  Plus, it takes me back to that long-demolished movie theater where I spent good times getting frightened with my friends!

1246693,4,B00001U0GS,"Like many of the other reviewers, I saw this as a young teen and it scared me so badly that I did not sleep all night. I saw it again recently and was amazed and pleased at how well the film has held up--a lot of films from this era seem too dated to be watchable. Be prepared for the fact that the film unfolds at a stately pace; if you are used to slasher films or things with a lot of explosions and car chases, this will be interminable to you and you should probably skip it. If you appreciate a film that lets the creepy build up slowly then this is your vampire film. Jessica of the title is a young wife who has been in some kind of mental hospital for several months prior.  We aren't told much about the reasons for this except that it happened after her father died. Grief? Exhaustion? We don't really know. What we do see is that she and her husband and their hippy friend who drives a funky old hearse have left New York City and are moving to an old farm the couple have bought. Things don't turn out quite the way they'd hoped, of course. The town is full of old men who don't care for hippies and make that quite clear. The farmhouse proves to contain a squatter in the form of a shapely redhead. The couple are pressed for cash and sell some stuff from the attic to get it. Jessica begins to hear and see things. Is she suffering another breakdown, or worse? You decide.
What I found especially interesting about this film is that it takes the old Henry James story, ""The Turn of the Screw,"" and turns it around. In that story, we tend to believe that the governess must be seeing what she claims to see because she is someone of impeccable moral standing.  In this film, we know that Jessica won't be believed, and she isn't. I also found it intriguing to compare the attitudes of the 70's--both of the young people and of the old people in the film--to attitudes of today. Some things have changed and some really haven't.
The film is quite low on gore for a vampire film, but do be aware that there is one brief, disturbing scene of animal cruelty. Overall, an interesting film to watch on its own merits and to contrast with vampire films being made today.",1329004800,,2177,4.256038647342995

1246697,4,B00001U0GS,"Let's Scare Jessica to Death (John D. Hancock, 1971)

I'd been hearing about this movie (which I had incorrectly assumed for many years was a TV movie) for close on forty years before I finally got round to watching it. Perhaps because of my incorrect assumption that it was a TV movie, I was expecting it to be some sort of cheesefest. I was quite happy to be wrong.

Based (loosely!) on Sheridan LeFanu's classic story ""Carmilla"", Let's Scare Jessica to Death is the story of a woman, Jessica (Splendor in the Grass' Zohra Lampert), who has recently been released from a mental institution and, as we open, is in the process of being relocated to the country by her husband Duncan (The Exorcist's Barton Heyman) and their friend Woody (Bogie's Kevin O'Connor). When they get to the house (which they were able to buy on the cheap, as always in horror films), they startle Emily (Ordinary People's Mariclaire Costello), an itinerant type who's been squatting there; she and Woody hit it off pretty quick. While the whole purpose of getting out of the city was to give Jessica a tranquil place to recover her senses, that's not what happens here; she immediately starts hearing voices, and soon becomes convinced that something is after her. The attitudes of the locals don't help matters much; the only person in town willing to talk to them is another newbie, an antiques dealer who moved up not long ago from New York City himself (The Devil's Advocate's Alan Manson). Jessica needs to figure out whether there really is something after her or if it's all in her head. Because if it's the former, it may already be too late...

This is a slow, methodical, surprisingly creepy little thriller; for some odd reason, it reminded me of The Postman Always Rings Twice, but I've been racking my brain ever since I saw it and I can't for the life of me figure out why. All the acting is flat-out solid, and if the name of John D. Hancock doesn't ring any bells for you, this was his first feature; his second, Bang the Drum Slowly, propelled him to seventies superstardom (he'd already been Oscar-nominated for his first film, a short, made the year before Jessica). He had some fun directing in the TV world for a while, then went back to features in 1987 with Weeds, a fantastic, underrated Nick Nolte flick. (His most recent movie to date, Suspended Animation, released in 2001, was a return to the thriller genre). The movie's got great bones, and as long as you're willing to let it take its time getting where it's going, it will reward you many times over for the time you put into it. A forgotten gem. *** ",1291161600,5,2610,4.606451612903226

The premise of the story is that Jessica, newly released from a mental institution after a nervous breakdown, is going to the country with her husband for recuperation and recovery.  Several unusual things begin to transpire, and the story progresses from that of a fragile woman turning her life around, to someone whose world unravels into horror.  Or is it actually a descent into madness?
Many elements of this movie really add to the effect.  These include Jessica's interest in old gravestone rubbings; the discovery of a young red-headed woman occupying the house; to the men of the town who all appear to have bloody wounds and who are unwelcome to visitors.
The By the end, neither she, nor we, really know which has happened.  Did Jessica go mad?  Was the town damned?  This unnerving ending, I feel, is what really makes this film so effective.",1290643200,2,1018,4.622222222222222

Unlike some of the few who saw this for what it is, I don't think the actors can be blamed - NO ONE could have made the script work. They also get no help from the lousy directing and terrible score.

There are a few moments of good atmosphere thanks mostly to the photography, but it is not enough.

1246704,5,B00001U0GS,"Being over 35 years old and having almost no recognition among horror fans around my age group, ""Let's Scare Jessica To Death"" is the definition of a classic sleeper movie. However, don't let the fact that this movie is buried under generations of more popular and well-known movies stop you from checking it out. ""Let's Scare Jessica To Death"" is criminally underrated, and will grab your interest with its amazing location, haunting atmosphere, enticing characters and ever-thickening plot.

Taking place in the beautiful Connecticut countryside, Jessica and friends take some free time after Jessica has been released from a mental hospital. Coming across a mysterious, albeit quite attractive lady, they all share the house on the lakeside before the ever chilling and eerie series of events sets in. Being a psychological horror film that pre-dates ""The Shining"", ""Let's Scare Jessica To Death"" is original in every sense of the word, and a film far beyond its time, having been made in 1971. The dark and mysterious atmosphere is captivating and at times, almost quite surreal, which makes for a fantastic tone to the movie. The setting of the house and the lake, and all the surrounding scenery adds to the optical beauty, making for some great landscapes for such chilling, psychological events to take place.

Overall, this is a great and extremely underrated psychological horror movie that's almost perfect. The only thing I wish would have been changed is the ending; it feels as though the ending was almost rushed and never given a proper conclusion. The other thing that bugs me is not about the movie itself, but about the DVD. The only thing the disc contains is the movie, the scene selection, and the language selection. It's really a loss that there's no special features included on this disc, because I love looking at the special features after a movie. Also, it's a loss because ""Let's Scare Jessica To Death"" is a movie where the bonus material may have been really interesting, especially regarding the nature of the film, how unknown the actors are and how the movie seemed to disappear under years of other horror films.

Be that as it may, ""Let's Scare Jessica To Death"" is an awesome horror movie that should be viewed by anybody interested in surreal, atmospheric horror or psychological horror films. Enjoy this classic in time for Halloween, too! Thanks for the time, and peace.",1256256000,6,2411,4.977667493796526
1246705,5,B00001U0GS,"There's something effective about lower-budget 70s films with their down-to-earth production values. They're modern enough to be edgy, yet we know there won't be any CGI or fancy effects to spoil their groundedness, so (hopefully) we're drawn in to character and story. The overall effect is a ""real feel"" that modern films (e.g. Blair Witch, Cloverfield) contrive, but fail, to achieve. This film is a good example of what I mean - it offers us scant but intriguing characterization (we know just enough to deduce that Jessica, the central character, is recovering from some form of mental breakdown) and relies heavily upon mood, atmosphere, music, and story-questions to hook us in for the duration. There are no special effects to speak of, either (excepting some simple make up and stage blood). What we do get is a slowly unraveling ghost/suspense yarn that tantalizes, unnerves and spooks its viewers without resorting to gimmickry.

Other reviewers have described the plot in great detail. It boils down to this: a man and a wife (with a friend in tow) have chucked city life for a place in the country. As soon as they arrive (after a ferryman takes them across a river to the town where their enchanting (enchantED?) abode is found), they discover a woman, a drifter type, has been living there, assuming it was abandoned. They invite her to stay, soon take a shining to her, then extend the invitation indefinitely. We sense this is a mistake and, before long, the presence of this woman sets up a ""love quadrangle."" All the while, many sinister happenings are observed by Jessica, and she is tormented with the possibility that she's getting sick again, imagining them all.

Herein lies the real power of the story. This is a paranoia tale, much like Polanski's Rosemary's Baby or The Tenant are paranoia tales. And what pulls us viewers along is the need to discover whether her fears are justified. The filmmakers skillfully present the plot points in a way that leaves doubt as to whether the central character's POV is reliable. But she's sympathetic to us and we worry for her just the same.

If you can handle a slower pace, this one rewards you as it builds the tension steadily to its finale.

DVD notes: The picture is crisp and colorful, drawn from a very good print, and the monaural soundtrack is good, too. Commentary or production notes would have been helpful, but alas, this is one of those bare bones offerings that we're grateful to have at all, and with such a quality transfer.

I'm guessing that the appeal is largely tied up in people's memories of being a kid, stumbling across the movie on late night TV, and getting scared, er, to death. Modern horror has since far eclipsed the scares in this movie, but the ""gestalt"" of it will stick with you much longer than much of anything else you can find these days... It is very atmospheric and, being *very* much a product of its time (the fashions, the hairstyles, the mores), it really does come from a different world.

I could not help but think, though, that it was going for the same territory that ""Rosemary's Baby"" went for: Young couple starts a new life in a home with a history... They come across strange locals... The 'action' (such as it is) unfolds very deliberately... Strange doings begin to occur... Or do they?... Viewers are meant to continually question the main character's perception of reality, as well as their own assumptions...

I didn't particuliar care for the music, as it wasn't eerie enough to support a film regarding supernatural events.
The old bald headed guy who plays Jessica's husband wasn't easy on the eyes, and the bucktooth brother or friend in the movie was just pitiful looking.
However, I did LOVE the story line. Just wish they'd put enough effort into the film to make it a #1 top notch movie, because I belive the whole story in itself was pretty good.
The silliness of it all is due to being able to predict a lot of what will happen right from the beginning of the movie.
I prefer flicks of horror to be much more twisted, suspenseful and unpredictable.
I did enjoy seeing a movie from another time period however--the 1970's, as back then most films on hauntings and such relied more on creating a pychological thriller type vs. gore, gut, and blood.
It was ""interesting"". --Bought it by accident actually because infact, I got it mixed up w/another 70's horror which I LOVED titled, ""Don't Be Afraid of The Dark.""  So I'm thrilled to order this right after this post :o)  !!!

1246713,4,B00001U0GS,"How, as a horror afficiando, I managed to make it to 2008 without having seen this movie even once, as a teenager or a 20-something, on a Saturday afternoon ""Creature Feature"" is beyond me...but I watched it for the first time last Saturday afternoon at age 50 - and was just a bit torn between the few quiet scares, the few substantial plot holes, and the huge feeling of nostalgia for this type of atmospheric movie you rarely see anymore.

I had read that this movie was loosely based upon J. Sheridan LeFanu's exquisite vampire novella ""Carmilla"" - and I'd have to agree that it was VERY loosely based upon it, but in a couple of particulars that many of our companion reviewers here DO seem confused about, so perhaps a mention of these items is worthwhile:  Carmilla WAS able to appear in daylight as well as nighttime, and while it was briefly suggested in LeFanu's book that Carmilla had been another vampire's victim and thus became a vampire herself (her creator had possibly even been a member of her vast noble family), it was also said that suicides generally became vampires.  Thus, Emily could appear in the daytime, and while it was never outright claimed in the movie, my feeling was that she was a suicide on her wedding day (""never even got to wear her wedding dress"") which could explain her vampirism.

I'm still not entirely convinced Emily was a vampire, however...my theory is that the character of Jessica more resembles the character of Eleanor Vance in ""The Haunting of Hill House"", in which case, Jessica may very well have imagined the whole set of incidents and even been responsible for them herself.  THIS is a great and subtle point in this movie, and one that keeps you asking yourself afterwards, what the hell really DID go on with Jessica and Emily?

While I do love these moody, misty, dark lake on the edge of abandoned house type movies, I have to agree that some of the plot points were offputting:  why would a back-to-nature hippie like the couple's live-in buddy seem so fascinated by continually spraying chemicals on the apple trees - just to give that guy something to do in this movie?  He didn't seem to have much of a part otherwise, except to be a potential ""partner"" for Emily, who was clearly not attracted to him.  What purpose did the ""girl in white"" serve - she was clearly alive, altho ostensibly a victim of Emily's as well as the townsmen, and if she was trying to demonstrate to Jessica that all was not well in the sinister little town or in the big black lake, I'd say there were other more significant examples of this, without her doomed interference.  She and the hippie buddy seemed like Star Trek ""Red Shirts"" to me - just there as fodder,to be either killed by Emily or by Jessica, and the ""shock"" sequences of both their murdered bodies did little for me (I was a little more shocked at a town full of middle-aged or old men living with ONE young, attractive girl amongst them. What was that all about?).  As for the hearse and the grave rubbings, I have to believe this was part of the married couple's lifestyle BEFORE Jessica was institutionalized, and thus not an immediate contributing factor to Jessica's further illness - altho in the long run, perhaps this strange attraction to these implements of death contributed to her initial breakdown, who knows?  I think the movie was simply suggesting, this is the type of thing hippies do - drive around in ex-hearses just to shock the ""plain folks"", and while away the hours in abandoned cemeteries, doing grave rubbings to hang on their walls next to their American flags and Peter Max posters.

Things I DID admire:  almost every interaction between Jessica and Emily, including the interlude in the attic, the wicked-scary little tussle at the lake, and the assumption of Emily JUST OUTSIDE Jessica's locked bedroom door, murmuring that she'd never go away...NEVER.  I loved the grave rubbings whispering as they lightly blew against the walls, and all the moments of frightened, dark internal thought Jessica had, while grinning her strained, hard grin externally at everyone - ""See?  I really AM ok!""

Overall, a great little semi-cheesy movie for me, one I will watch again.  Get yourself past the few weary plot holes, and decide for yourself - did the creature Emily wind Jessica up into madness again, or did Jessica ""suggest"" the whole great bad thing to herself, and act upon it?",1216598400,2,4412,4.707792207792208
1246714,4,B00001U0GS,"""Let's Scare Jessica to Death"" (1971) is another of the obscure films I saw at base/post theaters during my military days. It was certainly better than average and many of the images (especially those of the pesticide sprayer) have stayed with me through the years.

The film is more psychological thriller than actual horror. While it does have some macabre elements, most seem inserted for no real purpose; the title character likes to ride in the back of an old hearse with a coffin size contrabass case, she spending a lot of time in cemeteries, and she decorates her bedroom with tombstone rubbing's (just a typical Manhattan chick I guess). The film should appeal to anyone who enjoyed ""Carnival of Souls"" (1962), ""Repulsion"" (1965), and ""Heart of Midnight"" (1988).

Like the other three films, ""Let's scare Jessica to Death"" is a somewhat ambiguous story. But unlike some current viewers, back in 1971 no one considered this a vampire film or something with any supernatural elements.  It was promoted as straight psychological suspense.  The ambiguity was between whether a specific sequence was Jessica's imagination or a part of a conspiracy by her husband to drive her completely insane. The conspiracy idea derives from the title and from some of the obviously staged scares.

Working against the conspiracy/imagination idea are film conventions, which would normally require any scene in which Jessica is not present to be a truthful depiction of events (not her hallucination nor something staged for her benefit by the other characters).  But occasionally directors and editors don't play by the rules.  They already have the advantage of including only material they want a viewer to know, and they can include it in ways that should lead to a particular interpretation.  In this case they cheat and the ambiguity is deliberate, an easy (insert lazy here) way to give some depth to an otherwise shallow storyline.

Directed by John D. Hancock, the title role is played by the ethnic-looking Zohra Lampert. The film is book-ended by the title character's voice-over narration; showing that at least physically she was none the worse for the events. But in her commentary Jessica discloses an uncertainty as to whether any of the events actually took place, or at least that looking back they do not seem real to her.

Jessica is recovering from a nervous breakdown and her classical musician husband Duncan (Barton Heyman who would work with Director Hancock again in ""Bang the Drum Slowly"") is moving her out of NYC to a Connecticut apple farm. The couple is accompanied by Woody (Kevin O'Connor), a friend from the city. Because the film often feels like ""Alice's Restaurant"" (1969) I've always assumed the name was Hancock's tribute to Woody Guthrie.

Things quickly go off-kilter as the trio finds that the local villagers are strangely hostile and that a young  redhead (Emily played by Mariclare Costello) is living in their farmhouse. We learn that Jessica's husband invested virtually their last penny in the farm. None of the characters are much in the photogenic department but Emily has no problem getting the two males interested. They become so pre-occupied with her that only Jessica sees another young woman (a pre ""Rockford Files"" Gretchen Corbett) wondering around the farm or notices that all the men of the village have strange scars on their necks and faces. Or is all this just Jessica's imagination? No one is telling.

Although the establishment shots feature a New England countryside in full fall color and the production design is quilting bee country; the camera work, score, and editing manage to transform this niceness into something atmospherically creepy.  This is the film's real strength as the casting, scripting, and acting for the camera direction are nothing to write home about.

The 16X9 DVD comes from a nice print and has no audio problems. It also has no special features so don't expect any story clarifications from the cast or crew.

The primary elements of the movie were mood and atmosphere, which this film had plenty of. There were no special effects to speak of, no great make up, almost no gore and little violence.  None of the usually employed horror move tools were present except for the selection of moody on-site shooting locations in Connecticut, the almost constant sound of gentle wind and the sound of Jessica's thoughts at suspenseful moments and very appropriate music and sound effects.

I still don't know what to make of this film but find myself drawn to it time and again when in the proper mood.

It has a creepy atmosphere and a story that keeps viewers guessing until the end. It kind of reminds of The Changeling (but darker) and The Haunting (but newer), and I actually like this a little more then the two I just mentioned, but that's just me.
The main character Jessica is just out of a mental institution after a nervous breakdown and is a little wierd and always smiling, which I think adds a very cool vibe to it. She decides to get away for a while and stays in a small Connecticut town where things take a very strange and interesting turn. She meets a wierd girl named Emily (the walking dead?) and the townspeople seem to to be hypnotized by her. What is after Jessica, what does it want, and why is it dead? You'll have to watch to find out.
I thought the acting was the one of the main high point's of the movie, the actors are very comfortable and relaxed around the camera, and it doesn't feel like their trying too hard or being overly dramatic (I hate when they do that). They actors and actresses really carry the film.
The music is very cool also, I really like the soundtrack. It's a very creepy, dark, depressing soundtrack that I think fits the film really well.

Overall, Let's Scare Jessica to Death is really scary movie that I recommend to any old-school horror fan.",1189814400,2,1587,4.510416666666667
1246723,4,B00001U0GS,"Yeah, let's scare Jessica to death! Let's do, & say we didn't!

Man oh Man, and you thought summering in the Hamptons was tough! It's not even a feeble patch on the fear & loathing that besets poor addled Jessica as she tries to settle down and get some much needed R&R at her hubby's new digs up in the Connecticut woods.

WHO CAN TURN THE WORLD ON WITH HER SMILE? It doesn't help that she has just been released from the ""Institution"", where she had been recuperating after her last nervous breakdown. So see, Jessica is what you call ""nervous"". She's fragile. She's not a happy camper. She's looking to relax, calm down, take it easy, and above all not to tell anyone about the strange, spectral figure she saw hunched by a tombstone in the graveyard on the way up to her new house.

IT'S YOU GIRL, AND YOU SHOULD KNOW IT. But the touching thing about Jessica (Zohra Lampert, ugly enough to scare the siding off of a double-wide trailer) is how hard she tries to 'keep it real' even while on the verge of whoopsing her cookies over the stuff she's seeing. Oh, and the voice-overs, I gotta tell you about the voice-overs; you see, Jessica, nutty person trying to fake normalcy, talks to herself. In her head. Just like I do.

[JSG VOICEOVER: ""oh my god, did I just write ""Just like I do"" in my review? Did they see that? They'll think I'm weird. Looney. Ready for the rubber factory. Gotta watch myself.""]

Anyway, Jessica tries hard to cover up just make the proceedings all the more precious (""keep calm---they didn't see it---don't tell anyone. They won't believe you."") and then she slathers the whole weirdness package with this---this SMILE. It's a vintage Crazy-Person-Smile (tm), which sorta buckles around on her jaw, and makes her skin do this little twitching numbers. Lampert shoulda won an Oscar for it.

Things I learned while watching ""Let's Scare Jessica to Death"":

1)If you've just been released from a mental institution and you're feeling fragile, it's best to get your R&R at a remote, secluded, creepy crawly lookin' Victorian mansion with a notoriously bloodthirsty history. Add points if the grounds are tenanted by a) wandering hippies & b) the itinerant spectre or two.

2) Irony helps the insane get better! No seriously, it's true! For that reason, it's great when the family car is a hearse.

3) Pay no attention to the ancient, doddering townies, all of whom have been bandaged extensively, as if suffering nasty, but entirely random, wounds. It's probably the water. Or the fact that they've been voting GOP for one hundred years. Whatever.

4) When you arrive at your new house and discover---at the top of the stairs and in the dead of night---a wild-eyed, incoherent hippy chick, it's a great idea to make her a family intimate, confide secrets in her, and invite her to stay.

5)It's the 1970's, right? ""Jaws"", which gave everybody anywhere near a beach the crawls, is coming up, as a means of documenting the meteoric rise in great white sharks going ballistic and opening up a can of chomp-chomp-chomper on bathing beauties.

So with that in mind, whenever the fragile female lead (the ghoulish Zohra Lampert, easily the scariest looking she-creature I've seen in a fear flick since Shelly Duvall scared all the ghosts away in ""The Shining"") claims something ""like a shark"" is scudding around the freshwater lake, it's a great idea to swim out to your collarbone and say ""see, Jessica, there's nothing here. Absolutely nothing!"".

LOVE IS ALL AROUND, NO NEED TO WASTE IT. LSJTD was made in 1971, and it has a lot in common with its contemporary fear flicks, particularly ""Burnt Offerings"", ""the Little Girl who lives down the lane"", and, to an extent, the terrifyingly superior ""Haunting of Julia"" (for my money the scariest film ever made).

Indeed, the first reel suggested the flick was headed down the same road: creepy New England countryside shrouded in mist, the black, inky waters of the Lake where some unspeakable tragedy had occurred, the suggestion of ancient, incestuous evil slumbering beneath the peaked antique gables of the old house.

""LSJTD"" shares the same cinematic DNA: these movies all feature women pushed a little too close to the edge, women struggling to maintain their sanity in loveless marriages, poison relationships, or in the wake of family tragedy.

Then there's the seedy, nihilistic 1970's audience, where at any moment with a little shift of the lens or a hitch in the shutter the entire production is on the verge of sliding into pornoland.

YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE IT AFTER ALL! But when I thought ""LSJTD"" was about to zag left, the flick zigged right, taking another road far more travelled. As a result the end---given all the delicious, emotionally ugly, positively baroque developments leading up to it---left me underwhelmed. But maybe not you, baby, maybe not you!

But for all of that, if it's seedy 70's ambience, unfiltered creepiness, and things that go bump in the night you're after---

[JSG VOICEOVER: ""I wonder if I should tell them about the big shark thing lurking over their shoulder---nah, they'll think I'm crazy, BIIIIIG mistake""]

---well,  then, you're in the right hands. Dead, cold, clammy hands, but the right ones, nonetheless.

1246725,4,B00001U0GS,"Most people who don't like psychological horror and more quiet horror fare will likely steer clear of this slow-paced '70s creeper. Before watching this movie I'd only seen the video cover in the rental store and expected it to be some kind of slasher flick like ""Last House on the Left"" or ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre""; now I see that it is closer to moody/slow/creepy films like ""The Sentinel"", ""The Stepford Wives"", ""Rosemary's Baby"" and ""Burnt Offerings"".

It's not a great scary film, by no means, but it has some sort of atmosphere that eludes description, and pulls me in. Maybe it's the odd yet effectively creepy photography, and the eerie background music, plus the period look and feel of 1971. Zohra Lampert as Jessica is appropriately brittle and awkward as befits someone who just got out of a mental hospital, and she now thinks that either she's going bonkers again or she is in real danger from something evil. I have to confess that it's actually amusing to observe Jessica as she begins to become unhinged. I don't know why. At any given moment she may freak out and just start grunting/shrieking/bellowing and flailing her long arms like a wounded stick insect.

So be warned; the pace here is glacial. If you enjoy weird and cheesy horror movies from this era (with unimaginative and blunt titles), you might like this quite a bit. ""Let's Scare Jessica to Death"" teeters smack between solid horror entertainment and silly schlock. I can't help like it, hence the generous four star grade. Maybe it's that spooky farmhouse that wins me over.",1184371200,,1562,4.824626865671642
1246726,5,B00001U0GS,"It's not often, anymore, that I get to see a truly excellent horror movie for the first time, so ""Let's Scare Jessica to Death"" was quite a pleasant surprise.  It's got a dumb title, but everything else about the film is quite good.  It won't be to everyone's taste, since it's not a commercial, mainstream horror film nor is it a gruesome underground gore film.  ""Let's Scare Jessica to Death"" is just a dreamy, slow-moving horror film where the supernatural creeps into a seemingly ordinary situation and gradually makes itself known.  Lotsa of people will think it's boring, no doubt, but these people just have no taste for what I think is the truest, best distillation of horror in film.  I like the sense of otherworldliness that you get in some of your more low-key horror, and ""Let's Scare Jessica to Death"" has about as much of this as any film I've seen.  If that's what you're looking for, it doesn't get much better than this.

The film opens with Jessica on a boat, alone in the midst of foggy lake.  She wonders what has happened, and what is real just as the narrative moves back to the beginning, with Jessica, her husband Duncan and their friend Woody moving to a small, unassuming rural town in New England.  Jessica has, apparently, just finished a stay in a mental institution, and this move represents a new beginning for her and Duncan, as they plan to begin a new low-key life on an apple ranch.  Not all is well with Jessica, however, and she sees strange things, things that, perhaps, the others can't see.  Furthermore, they arrive at their new rural home to find a mysterious, pretty redheaded girl by the name of Emily who has been squatting in their home.  She seems pleasant enough, though, so they let Emily stick around for a while, and they even grow somewhat attached to her.  (Perhaps too attached, in Duncan's case.)  Everything seems more or less fine, but strange occurrences and odd behavior by the local townspeople begin to add up, and Jessica gradually comes to believe that more is going on here than meets the eye or, perhaps even worse, that she's lost her mind.

""Jessica""s critics generally accuse it of being dull, and though I don't agree, I can see where they're coming from.  Virtually nothing happens for the films first half, and it doesn't really kick into top-gear until the climax late in the film.  Still, it has a certain air to it from the very first frame that I just love.  The film isn't about major action or great scenes, it's about the slow buildup of seemingly minor scenes and details which combine to generate a palpable sense of the unnatural.  This all begins with the pitch perfect score, mostly slow, mournful piano and guitar with some occasional ominous synth that build a proper feeling of sorrow and foreboding.  And then we get the seemingly trivial details:  They drive a hearse (cheaper than a station wagon, apparently);  The town is populated entirely by old men, hostile old men with strange marks and wounds; Jessica makes grave rubbings, and keeps them in her bedroom where they shudder and seem to whisper at night; Emily herself is just a bit odd, with her long red hair and impish smile.  Who is she where did she come from?  While exploring their new home, Jessica finds a painting in the attic which looks strangely like Emily.  Coincidence?  (A great scene by the way, with Jessica being unknowingly trailed by a vague, half-seen black force.  What is it, if anything?  We never know.)

Eventually, the film becomes more forthright.  Turns out Jessica and Duncan bought the the old Bishop place, a long empty home with a tragic history with superstitious connotations in the community.  Even worse, Jessica's visions become more common and intense, as she again sees a mysterious white gowned woman roaming the area and believes that she is attacked by a pale figure beneath the surface of the nearby lake.  Tension rises:  Duncan wants to send Jessica back to New York and his attraction to Emily becomes more and more overt, and now Jessica has to fight to save her mind, her marriage and her life.

""Jessica"" really benefits from being a cheap film from 1971:  They don't ruin the eeriness with phony CGI or unnecessary cheap scares, nor is the pacing forced in anyway.  It builds as is necessary.  Equally significant, we get to have mature, adult characters rather than a pack of tiresome teenagers, well-played by a generally unknown cast.  (Some have complained about the acting.  Anyone who does so clearly hasn't watched much low-budget horror, cause this is way above average in that respect.)  Zohra Lampert is particularly good in the lead, as is Mariclare Costello, though her effectiveness is more her basic look than the real acting.  For a film of limited means, the technical aspects are solid, with some generally nice photography, though the occasional zooms are a bit dated.

Normally I'm not too hesitant to give away late film details in horror movies since they're generally so formulaic, but I'm going to avoid doing this here, because ""Jessica"" follows no specific horror movie formula.  Sure, it is, at heart, a mystery-horror movie, where the supernatural occurrences function as clue towards the central secret, but even within this form it doesn't follow the traditional routes and clichs.  I doubt anyone will be too shocked by the end, but it's not nearly as inevitable as the ending of your typical horror movie.  The film does become a bit more conventional at the end, dispensing with the subtle, atmospheric horror and working the standard run-and-chase angle, but I think they do this fairly well, and it is ultimately necessary.  Even though the climax rarely lives up to the buildup in this kind of movie, to exclude it is a cheat, because half of the interest in the mysterious occurrences lies in finding out what they ultimately mean.  You gotta lay your cards down sooner or later.  This isn't to say you need to explain absolutely everything, and the film doesn't, but I've never bought the ludicrous ""incoherence is a virtue"" principle that so many lazy critics invoke and almost as many obliging filmmakers cater to.

Anyway, I hate to invoke the old clich, but they really don't make `em like this anymore.  Too bad, but at least we've got plenty of classics to fall back on, like this one.

1246730,5,B00001U0GS,"""Let's Scare Jessica to Death"" is a bona fide cult horror gem -- not a lot of people have seen it, it's smarter than your average death'n'gore movie, and it leaves you wondering just what the heck is going on here.

In particular, it makes you wonder if the ""Jessica"" of the title is raving mad, or if a vampire really is making the rounds. The movie is blessed with wonderfully eerie music and camerawork, but it's the blurred line between madness and the supernatural that makes it stand out like a dark gem.

Jessica (Zohra Lampert) has just been released from a mental hospital, and she and her husband Duncan (Barton Heyman) want to make a fresh start on a rural farm, with pal Woody (Kevin O'Connor) helping out. But when they arrive at their new home, they find a nomadic hippie girl living in the attic. At Jessica's insistence, Emily (Mariclare Costello) agrees to stay with them awhile.

But strange things are happening -- the townspeople are very hostile towards the newcomers, and Emily is being trailed by a mysterious girl in a white gown. What's worse, all the men -- including Woody and Duncan -- seem to be somehow under Emily's spell. Is Jessica going insane again -- or is there a vampire controlling this island?

One of the best things a horror movie can do is leave you wondering. ""Let's Scare Jessica to Death"" does just that. By the finale, it leaves us wondering if this is a terrifying reality, or the paranoid delusions of a woman who feels threatened by an attractive newcomer, and just made up this whole thing about her being an evil seductive vampire.

A clever plot alone isn't enough to guarantee success, though. The whole movie feels vaguely spooky and dreamlike, with a camera that seems to capture all the mundane things like antique-shopping and farm kitchens. That makes the all the eerie stuff -- vanishing corpses, swimming specters -- seem even creepier. The climactic creep-out comes when the vintage-dressed vampire rises out of the water.

Lampert does an amazing job as a woman terrified that her mental illness is coming back, but at the same time knowing that what she sees is real -- and that no one will believe her. Costello is creepy in a low-key, uncliched manner (when was a vampire last seen in flannel?), and Heyman and O'Connor are good in their supporting roles.

""Let's Scare Jessica To Death"" is an eerie, atmospheric movie with excellent acting, that opts for the shivers instead of blood. Not to be watched after dark.",1166140800,9,2481,4.702764976958525
1246731,2,B00001U0GS,"THE FIRST HALF

  If they had made movies back then, in 1871, it would move as slowly as this.

  Perhaps that date suits the film to perfection.

The days of utter simplicity, with nearly nothing happening.

Where maybe days are filled with yourself.

Not distractions.

  After half an hour, all I could think was, if this was on TV, not only would everybody switch off, the sh** (show) would be axed.

  It may even beat so many foregin movies as THE SLOWEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME.

But slow really means empty.

THE OTHER HALF (OF ME)

  Yet I have since come to learn, by others' reviews, this is a movie which YOU must make, by the mood, or the feeling of dread others speak of. Or else you are left with the feeling of dead.

  I failed to do that, and without that, the film fails miserably I reckon. Perhaps because I am dead.

  So, therefore, I envy those creative creatures of subtle senses. Or whether it was because they were so simple, or easily pleased, which means more modest, more modern.

  So, as in real life, it's only the FEELING which makes anything real.

MY FIRST (OR WORST?) HALF

  The other part of me thought that, the film being a feature length, they think they can just not try for half an hour, an hour. Such is the problem with many filmakers, even today. When, being a torture, err feature, they should try much harder!!

  Therefore the atmosphere spoken of in these reviews can only be like saying there is smoke without fire. Virtually nothing happens, and what does makes little sense, as any unconcious creation.

MY BETTER HALF OF THE SCHIZOPHRENIC

  But the acting of the lead lady is expressive and genuine, and not being stereotype; is pleasingly real. Weird as suits the role. As are the others natural, with no Hollywood posing. How often have I heard that story - good acting, bad film? Oh I'm sorry, I did it again.

  The only thing exciting is the title.

THE WHOLE

  My conclusion is: I DON'T KNOW WHICH IS MY BETTER HALF, AND WHICH IS MY WORST HALF . . . ?

  So, all things being unequal, I choose both. I stand and fall by both my views. (I guess that's why God gave us 2 eyes.)

  I was going to give it only one star* at first, but now I give it merely two**, knowing I'm still mean.

 I see this movie as perhaps the greatest measure of one's temperament.

  If you feel better than me, are supernaturally sensitive, or have the patience of a saint to me, add one, two, or three more stars respectively.

  I intend to watch it again, and then maybe I can give a before and after shot.

1246737,3,B00001U0GS,"This famous low-budget atmospheric film gained a huge reputation well after its initial release by being shown repeatedly on television, where its unusual delberate pace and its unusual central performance by Zohra Lampert made it something of a cult favorite. It's much better than it's silly title (which suggests an heiress being scared out of her fortune) would suggest, and owes much to the more intelligent supernatural movies of the 60s, particularly THE HAUNTING (in its use of the central disturbed character's vocieovers), THE INNOCENTS, ROSEMARY'S BABY, and NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. The plot of course centers upon Jessica, recently released from a mental hospital, moves to a large rural Connecticut farmhouse with her husband and their best friend to start up an apple orchard business; at the house, they discover a pretty young redheaded drifter squatting there whom they ask to stay with them (this being the early 70s, after all). But Jessica is not yet ready to leave, apparently; she hears voices and sees apparitions--that seem to be connected to the legend of a dead bride-to-be who lived in the house 90 years ago.

Certainly the film is worth seeing for its mood and for Zohra Lampert, who gives a striking performance as the unbalanced Jessica (she goes way beyond hysteria to seem genuinely disturbed--the strange noises that come from her when she asks her husband, ""Leave me alone!"" in bed is very unsettling and real). But the direction of the film, innovative though it may be, often works against the script: there are too many long distance shots of Jessica running when we should be closer to her, identifying with her fear, and the use of odd angles becomes annoying and self-conscious after a while. While the script's central ambiguity is quite impressive, more backstory for Jessica's original insanity, her husband's plans to renovate the orchard, and for the legend of Abigail Bishop (the dead bride) should have been provided. But it is a film that was worth being reissued on DVD--and for horror fans it's a must-see.",1162771200,2,2058,5.017543859649122
1246738,5,B00001U0GS,"Let's Scare Jessica To Death is finally out on DVD, and not a moment too soon. There just aren't enough ""American Gothic"" horror movies that exploit the lonely desolation of  the rural landscape, but this is one of the best. Part ghost story, part psychological horror film, and with a little vampirism thrown in for good measure, LSJTD is both affective and affecting.

Recovering from some sort of nervous breakdown, the frail Jessica moves with her husband, and a friend to a sprawling rural farmhouse to start a new life. It turns out they couldn't have picked a worse place to recover; this particular farmhouse has a tragic history, and is presently inhabited by an enigmatic stranger who may be a part of it's dark past, and even darker future.

As Jessica, Zora Lampert  gives an astonishing portrayal of a woman who's grip on sanity, and sense of self preservation quickly erode in the face of seemingly supernatural occurrences. Though you may doubt Jessica's stability, the connection to her character is so intimate, that it offers no relief to judge her delusional. Her reality is your reality, and whether or not she's sane is almost beside the point.

Heavy on atmosphere, and low on blood and budget, LSJTD is great little early 70's chiller, with a well deserved cult following. If you've never seen it before (or even if you have) your in for a treat.",1162684800,6,1369,4.783898305084746
1246739,5,B00001U0GS,"I'm surprised and perplexed by the mediocre reviews this movie seems to be getting here on Amazon. It is indeed unfortunate that the disc contains no extras.  This is one of the one-in-twenty movies where I really would be interested in hearing anecdotes and recollections from the director and cast.  Why?  Because this movie is ominously weird and creepy and altogether classic.  It is very creatively done, it is truly an artistic accomplishment with a cast which was extremely talented. I bet the making of this movie was in itself a strange experience. I think the explanation, and irony, for the hum-drum reviews is that the people who would most appreciate this don't watch a whole lot of horror movies, and if they do, they probably don't have the time to write reviews here on Amazon.  This is not a teenager gore-fest.  Instead, this is a contemplative, ambience-rich psychedelic dream where the 60's spirit remains alive and well in the context of pure horror.  Movies that might compare in both quality and vibe: ""Rosemary's Baby"" (Polanski); ""The Haunting"" (the original); ""The Legend of Hell House"" (with Roddy McDowell); ""Burnt Offerings"" (with Karen Black); and especially ""Images"" (by Robert Altman).  If you know or liked any of those movies you will certainly enjoy this one as well.

A few points of clarification:  First, this is not ""psychological horror.""  It is clearly ""supernatural horror.""  Jessica has been released from a mental institution and so she questions her observations and sanity, but objective indicators all corroborate her conclusions. (She is, in the end, the most sane person in the movie.)  And we see for ourselves the source of the inexplicable events, and it quite simply ""is not of this world.""  I like psychological horror but I've always highly preferred macabre supernatural origins and explanations. The scientifically/rationally inexplicable is simply more interesting, and scary, to me. This movie gives you both psychological drama and evil supernatural phenomena.

I'm amazed no one has really emphasized the soundtrack.  The aural accompaniment here is truly a major accomplishment.  It is not really music, but more ambient sounds that emphasize events.  Coupled with Jessica's weird narrations (we can hear her thoughts and we can hear her being beckoned by a spirit force in voice-overs) it is just a surrealistcally bizarre festival of creepy atmosphere.  The warm mood lighting, the natural rural settings, the sense of isolation, and the attractive two female leads all combine to make a very satisfying viewing and listening experience. Let me further emphasize: this movie is genuinely scary.  If it's blood and guts you're looking for you may be disappointed.  If you prefer a two hour voyage into the occult possibilities of evil, you will be creeped out.

1246742,5,B00001U0GS,"First things first, loved ""Cookieman"" review.  For the most part, my sentiments exactly.  I just want to add a few things of my own, primarily that as I good as I think this film is, I'm disinclined to label it a ""horror"" film because whether or not the goings on are all the machinations of a sick mind or well executed set pieces meant to bring about a nervous breakdown, there's ultimately nothing either supernatural or horror driven about it.  The film's category is ultimately not an issue, I know, but it brings me to my next point.  As a psychological ""thriller"" I think this film is tops, primarily in its ability to get under the viewer's skin, inducing a sense of panic that few films, in my experience, have ever been able to engender.  At times, the viewer is made to feel exposed and vulnerable; hushed and whispering voices, clever camera angles, isolated location, local folklore, foggy incandescence, deliberate pacing, effective use of music and eccentric town's men.  Heck, John D. Hancock manages to make a double bass case an ominous and prominent character.  Regarding Zohra Lampert's performance, I wholly disagree with aforementioned reviewer, as I felt she captured the character's plight very convincingly, never coming across as hammy, melodramatic or victim but rather frail, cautious and increasingly fearful and who can blame her?  Encroaching madness is hardly something to celebrate.  I felt that everyone's performance was very good, especially Mariclare Costello as the increasingly disturbing and seemingly Machiavellian Emily.  This was a very low budget affair that doesn't remotely bear that dubious stamp.  It's an intimate, creepy, unsettling little film that though ends on an inconclusive note (to the frustration of those who must have finality and tidy endings), manages to convey the terror of madness and poses the question:  Just how firm (or tenuous) is our grip on reality?  Can this, in fact, happen to me?",1161561600,5,1956,5.094043887147335
1246743,1,B00001U0GS,"'Let's Scare Jessica To Death' is one of those tricky '70s horror flicks that many of us 30 & 40-year olds recall seing bits & pieces of, could never quite recall the name, and remember as being very scary. I'm one of those viewers, and decided to give it another watching, now that I can appreciate film better than when I was a kid. Sadly, 'Jessica' is a horror film better left to the hazy corners of the memory.

The story has Jessica, recently released from a sanitarium (why she was there we never know), moving from New York to the Connecticut countryside with her husband Duncan. Their friend Woody also tags along to help out. Duncan decided to spend every penny the couple had on the old Bishop farm, a place with a checkered past: the story goes that Abigail Bishop, set to be married at 18, drowned in the cove behind the farm and ""never got to wear her wedding dress"", which seems to be a big point for some unknown reason. Legend has it that she's a vampire that roams the countryside in search of victims to feed her need. Don't ask me how drowning begets vampirism, but that's the story and they're sticking to it.

I won't get into the story details since they've been explained previously more than well enough, and not much of anything happens anyway. Hancock makes the mistake of opening the film with the ending, so we already know that Jessica doesn't get scared to death. Nice move, and it certainly turns out to be an ill omen in this case. The film is supposed to present a surreal, ambiguous atmosphere, and tries to keep you unsure of what is real and what may be going on inside Jessica's head. It fails to generate any atmosphere because the scenes that are supposed to come off as dreamlike are too in-your-face; they aren't shot with enough flair to come off as nightmarish. It also fails to create tension because it's just so darned boring and dull; too much of nothing goes on for far too long to make anything even remotely creepy.

I'd say the only place the film succeeds is in allowing you the freedom to decide what is really happening, and this stems from a decided lack of exposition throughout. I decided that Jessica was released from the sanitarium too soon and created the entire story in her decaying mind. She slipped into madness and killed Duncan and Woody, and what unfolds in the film is the dreamscape she saw it from.

The print quality is very good, but the acting is strictly mediocre. Zohra Lampert (Jessica) is horrendous, like the worst you'd see at community theater. Her voice, mannish and hoarse, is like nails on a chalkboard. Barton Heyman (Duncan) and Kevin O'Connor (Woody) come off like the typical Z-grade horror actors. Mariclare Costello (Emily) is more than nice to look at, but does nothing to convey to charm of a supposed vampire other than staring at everyone with her baby blues and everyone just falling for her for no apparent reason. The DVD comes with no extras whatsoever.

Don't be fooled by the exasperating reviews that claim this film is filled with subtle horror, atmosphere, and ""just gets under your skin"". It's as dull and lifeless as bad horror comes.",1161475200,6,3140,4.590017825311943
1246744,1,B00001U0GS,"I just finished watching this movie and I have to say it was the biggest disappointment. I won't even go so far as to say it had potential. Fortunately for me, I rented the DVD, so I don't feel as bad as I would have had I bought it.

There are enough reviews of this movie that I won't have to go into its plot. Let's just get down to business; shall we:

First off, the quality of the film is decent for a 1971 flick. I noticed no noticeable grain or other digital artifacts. However, I did feel the colors could have been sharper and more vibrant. Some parts of the film took on a soft look.

Secondly, the DVD contains zero extras. I mean zero! There are no commentaries nor are there any trailers. Paramount just ran it through their machine and up-converted it to the standard DVD resolution. A typical move by the big Hollywood studios whenever they think their older or more obscure titles won't bring in the big bucks.

Thirdly, Let's Scare Jessica to Death is one of those films that leaves the ending open to YOUR interpretation, as not enough facts are revealed for you to solve the big mystery. For example, most of the town members sport a scar somewhere on their bodies. The director makes sure, you, the viewer is aware of this. However, he offers no explanation as to why this is done. One assumes these townfolk are the product of some evil experiment performed by some local biotech company run by a madman. Again, one of many interpretations one can come up with. Let's face it, when a director makes a movie to show how clever he is, you'd better steer clear of it.

Bottom line, whatever you do, don't buy this waste of celluloid on DVD.

How this film ended up on some peoples lists of best horror films I will never know. I guess it's all in the eye of the beholder.",1160870400,4,1790,4.344311377245509

This movie has excellent dialogue/haunting soundtrack/creepy location and a good plot (though it was more complicated than necessary). Jessica's part was convincingly portrayed by Ms Lampert. Duncan and Emily were also very very good actors. The ending was overstaged but the first half of the film was flawless. This earned a permanent place in my DVD collection ... being a spartan I keep only the best :),1160352000,4,522,5.0813953488372094
1246746,4,B00001U0GS,"Not knowing anything about this film prior to watching it, I found it a rather pleasant surprise. Although the title suggests this is a ""scary"" movie, it doesn't provide any clues as to what happens over the course of the film. The plot unfolds very nicely to reveal several nice developments and to give away some of these would ruin much of the pleasure of watching it. To give some indication of what this film is about, however, Jessica (Zohra Lampert) is a young woman who has just been released from a six-month stay in a psychiatric hospital. She thinks she sees and hears some unusual things but does not tell her husband or friend for fear of being sent back to the sanitarium. There isn't any profanity, gore or nudity in this film and it almost seems as though it could have been made for television. It is not dissimilar to reading a book in that it does not offer much in the way of immediate gratification, so I can understand why some people would find it boring. I enjoyed this aspect of it, though, relishing each little revelation and the mounting suspense. If you enjoy films, such as ""Les Levres rouge"" or ""Carnival of Souls,"" you will likely enjoy this. This is a low budget production, although that is not detrimental because it does not rely on special effects in order to relate the story. The acting is a couple notches above most other films in the horror genre, and the writing and direction are solid. The picture and sound quality are very good as well. This DVD made for a great addition to my library and I am glad I bought it.",1160352000,10,1559,4.473684210526316
1246747,4,B00001U0GS,"I picked this up because I really like low budget horror films, especially ones that used to play on late night TV.  I think this is one of those rare films that stands the test of time.  There is enough going on that it kept me wondering what was going to happen next, and it didn't rely on sharp sounds or buckets of blood to induce horror.  Instead, it used good story writing, competent actors, and good direction to induce a feeling of general unease.  There are many types of horror films and this one clearly falls into the psychological category, where we are taken down a path of insanity with the main character.  We don't know why Jessica was in an institution, however, it's not important to the plot that we know.  We see and hear what Jessica is thinking and we know she doubts her own sanity from the very beginning.  As things progress, it all goes south for Jessica and I began to actually feel sorry for her.  Not many movies can make me feel anything for the characters, but this did, and that is worth four stars.",1160179200,12,1033,4.371727748691099
1246748,1,B00001U0GS,"I gave this film an honest chance and watched it all the way through. I found it to move at a painfully boring pace, be poorly acted, completely without substance or identifiable storyline, not at all frightening (even for the early 70s)... basically, just crap. There was nothing about the movie that is at all scary, aside from the main character, who is inadvertently frightening to watch (especially when she is yelling, oh jesus, she sounds like a man being tortured). There is a whole lot of waiting. Waiting for something to happen.. and nothing ever does. It is not known if Jessica is, in fact, crazy, although it appears that she is, at least to a degree. There is talk of vampires, but you see only one or two neck-biting incidents (one of which may have been imagined).

It's just difficult to stay interested in this movie, even if you're into old horror films. It's worth watching if you're into SUSPENSE films from the early 70s, but probably not otherwise.",1159747200,9,972,4.684210526315789
1246749,2,B00001U0GS,"Filmed in 1971, LET'S SCARE JESSICA TO DEATH is one of those films that over the years many have called an unknown classic, comparable to the original THE HAUNTING.  I'm not in agreement with this assessment.

First of all, the movie seems to deliberately confuse us and is so ambiguous in many of its plot elements.

We don't know why Jessica was in an institution and so when she starts hearing voices and seeing things, we're not sure whether she's looney or not.  And the vampire insinuation is also ambiguous and unfounded.  True, director John Hancock has filmed the movie with an eerie subtext and there are some nice shots, but ultimately without a true resolution or any real meat to the script, the viewer is left with an abstract experience.  I am not one who minds a little afterthought but in looking back on JESSICA, there doesn't seem to be any thing to look back on.  Zohra Lampert does a nice job as Jessica; she was a good actress who never seemed to get the ""big"" break; the rest of the cast is ineffectual as they aren't given much to do.  Who is Emily--really?  And why do the townsfolk act like they do?  Your guess is as good as mine, but I found this much less impressive than THE HAUNTING, and one of this films I feel is vastly overrated.",1159574400,2,1264,4.432900432900433

It's not a blood bath but what it is is scary! It uses old school techniques to scare you such as its creepy score and eerie atmosphere. Also, the characters all seem to have their own craziness about them. It gives you the feeling that none of it is really happening and allows you to use your imagination. This movie reminds me of another great movie of the same era. Endless Night starring Hayley Mills came out one year later and has the same characteristics with its eerie score and the way it makes you think. It is amazing, with such a low budget, unknown actors, and no special effects to spruce it up, how this movie could actually frighten you.",1159228800,6,792,4.394557823129252
1246751,4,B00001U0GS,"This one places very highly on my short list of the very best horror films of the seventies.  Like many others who've shared their memories of Jessica here, I was first introduced to her at the local theater in my small hometown of Rock Hill, South Carolina.  And what a theater it was!  I saw Blacula there; Count Yorga, Vampire; Those films' sequels, The Return of Count Yorga and Scream, Blacula, Scream!; The Abominable Dr. Phibes (ditto); Sugar Hill (and her Zombie Hit Men!); Trog; and Night of Dark Shadows.  GP-rated horror films of the seventies were fierce, and the MPAA was far more lenient content-wise than they are with todays' PG-13 rated fare.  They were also scarier, and Let's Scare Jessica to Death was (and is) one of the scariest.

Of all these movie memories, I remember Jessica most fondly.  I've tried to intellectualize this attraction over the years, telling myself perhaps it was the film's lack of a camp aesthetic, so prevalent in many other horror films released at the time.  Or maybe it was the sturdy bridge it seemed to form between the new ""modern""  approach so in vogue at the time, which eschewed a gothic sensibility in favor of ""harder"" films like Last House on the Left (also filmed in Connecticut)and the more genteel horrors of Hammer.  It was a bridge I willingly crossed.  More than anything else, however, I've come to believe my love for Let's Scare Jessica to Death is rooted in the character of Jessica herself.  For the first time in horror cinema, I saw a real human being, a damaged soul laid bare.  Jessica's vulnerability, her desperation for others to believe that she's recovered and is now well, her fear of death (after reading an epitaph she's copied from a tombstone with wax paper, her husband Duncan tells her, ""...You're getting better already."") render Jessica very susceptible to the seductive charms of the vampiric Emily.  Although not explicitly stated in the film, it's strongly inferred that Jessica attempted suicide prior to being sent away.  Thus, Jessica's seduction by Emily  can be read as an attempt by death to reclaim what it had nearly collected earlier.  Emily's command for Jessica to ""Stay"", as she rises from her watery grave to embrace her (in the film's scariest scene), is terrifying because we know that, repulsed by Emily's affection though she may be, Jessica feels the sweet allure of the siren's call.  She's flirted with death before.  Further, the mole that Jessica and Duncan find is a clever symbol for Jessica herself--a delicate creature found rooting around in a graveyard, dwelling below the surface, digging, prying into places it doesn't belong.  It's fate isn't surprising.

Poetic, symbolic, subtle and ultimately chilling, Let's Scare Jessica to Death was inspired by Romero's Night of the Living Dead and Herk Harvey's Carnival of Souls, yet for me remains more potent than those two classics , containing imagery as frightening as any I've seen in any other horror film.  Anchoring the imagery is Zohra Lampert's incredible performance as Jessica, one of the strongest in the history of horror cinema, perhaps even eclipsing the descents into madness displayed by Catherine Deneuve in Polanski's Repulsion and Daria Nicolodi in Mario and Lamberto Bava's Shock (Beyond the Door II).  When you add in the mesmerizing effect of the score (and the creepy song which Emily sings at the dinner table on Jessica's first night in their new home--a song I'm almost ashamed to admit I hum to myself with some frequency), Jessica's soliloquies (""It's blood, Jessica...Blood!""), and a deceptively peaceful, sun-dappled, autumnal mis en scene, you have a horror film quite unlike any other.

  Paramount's DVD release offers a nice transfer but nothing more.  If they were aware of the power of this subtle gem, they'd have bestowed it with supplemental material such as a trailer and commentary.  Regardless, this is a required viewing for horror film fans.",1159142400,6,3951,4.9817073170731705

She's just been through a terrifying, deadly nightmare, that may or may not have been completely real. She's wondering if vampires or ghosts exist, or if it was all in her own head. What was it about this small town in Connecticut? Were it's inhabitants really vampiric minions, or just mean, nasty hicks? Was the house haunted? And what about Emily (Mariclare Costello)? Was she the evil center of things, or simply an odd vagrant w/ her own little quirks? Either way, it all adds up to murder and insanity. Jessica must escape, but will probably end up where she started, in an institution. I love this movie! It's got that eerie feeling like THE HAUNTING (the original, not that awful remake) has! We never quite know for sure how much is really happening or how much is created in Jessica's mind. However, Jess' mental instability also makes her the perfect victim doesn't it?

1246766,5,B00001U0GS,"Creepy haunting and prophetic, these are the words best used to describe this 1971 pro-to horror movie. The soundtrack is the best place to begin as it exemplifies what would by the mid nineteen eighties have become the all too familiar and cliched horror synthesizer score. This film uses its score very well indeed, and you'll probably feel like pinching yourself to remained you of the fact that this movie was made in 1971, a good three years before Texas Chainsaw Massacre, which the film reminds one of due to the agricultural setting. Let's Scare Jessica to Death is a completely different psychological take on Hitchcock's masterful Psycho made just ten years prior, and deals with relapsed female madness. The conclusion of the film reminded me very much of David Cronenberg's 1975 Shivers, with it's gathering of onlookers.

There is even a fair amount of unpleasant blood letting for those who need it, myself included.

All in all you will not be disappointed by this creepy gem, now all I ask is can we have Blood and Lace also from 1971 and only PG.

Dvd picture quality is mostly great through-out, hard to believe you are watching a thirty five year old movie.

No extras at all but the cover art work is very pleasing.

1246767,4,B00001U0GS,"According to a great many of the reviews I've read a whole lot of people who saw Let's Scare Jessica to Death (1971) caught it off the television rather than in the theaters.  Personally, last night was my first time watching the film, and after doing so I can't help feel I missed out on something in terms of not seeing this movie at a more impressionable age as I believe it would have truly scared the hell out of me...that's not to say I didn't find it frightening at my present age, but I have reached a point in my life where certain daily mundane activities (like paying bills) scare me more than cinematic ones...co-written and directed by John D. Hancock (Bang the Drum Slowly, California Dreaming), the film features Zohra Lampert (Splendor in the Grass), Barton Heyman (Dead Man Walking), Kevin O'Connor (The Brink's Job), Alan Manson (Bang the Drum Slowly), and Mariclare Costello (Ordinary People).

After a bit of clever misdirection, which I won't go into as not to spoil the fun, we meet a trio of hippies types traveling from New York to an farm on a cove in Connecticut.  There's Duncan (Heyman), a balding man with enormous mutton chop sideburns, his girlfriend/common law wife Jessica (Lampert), and their friend Woody (O'Connor).  Apparently, not too long ago, while living in New York, Jessica suffered some sort of mental breakdown and went away for a period of time, and after being released Duncan blew his savings on an apple farm in Connecticut to not only get `back to the Earth', but also to allow for him to provide a healthier atmosphere for Jessica's recovery (Woody's just along for the ride).  Upon arriving at the house, the trio discovers someone's already in residence in the form of a spooky, redheaded hippie chick/drifter named Emily (Costello) whom they quickly befriend and invite to stay (Woody's taken a shine to Emily, but Emily seems to have a thing for Duncan).  Anyway, various strange events, many of them witnessed mainly by Jessica, occur causing a strain on Jessica's fragile psyche and her relationship with Duncan, making the others wonder if Jessica's having some sort of relapse, none of which is helped by a strange, mute girl in white lurking about the orchard, creepy Emily's head games, and the fact that the townspeople, who are all old men for some reason or another, are just really weird (and they hate hippies to boot, but this wasn't an uncommon sentiment within the conservative population at the time).  Things take a turn for the worse (as they're apt to do) and Jessica takes the express train to Nuttyville, leaving the rest of us wondering if the oddness permeating the story is a part of some concerted, indeterminate effort to drive Jessica looney tunes, or if it's all a product of her fractured mind...

There are three things potential viewers should be aware of prior to going into this film...

1. The feature is soaked with a rich, spooky, atmospheric quality, driven by a number of aspects, which causes the entire story to appear slightly askew.

2. The story moves along at a very deliberate pace (i.e. it's slow).

3. The story is entirely ambiguous, open to a whole lot of interpretation, which will certainly appeal to those who don't enjoy every aspect of a plot spoon fed to them, but will certainly annoy and frustrate those who prefer their celluloid experiences to be more straightforward.

As far as the last point I consider myself to be somewhere in the middle as I believe I can appreciate a certain amount of vagueness within a film dependant on the material, but I absolutely despise vagarious elements either due to the filmmakers trying to be overly cerebral or due to a sloppy and/or weak production.  One element I really liked was the intimate nature of the story as there really weren't a lot of characters running around, most likely a result of the low budget, independent nature of the film.  I had some difficulty relating to the character of Jessica mainly because she was a bit on the nutty side, and details of her previous breakdown were never disclosed, so I had little idea where she was coming from...I'm not a violent person, but there were times when I just wanted to whack her upside the head given her gradual growing histrionics.  Since it's never really made clear, to me at least, whether her issues were the result of external or internal stimuli (or a combination of both), it was difficult to determine if she was a victim of her own mind, or if there was truly outside forces at work she may have been more sensitive to over the others.  One thing's for sure, the character of Emily gave me a bad case of the heebee jeebees.  She seemed a harmless hippie at first, but her later actions, along with her unsettling eyes, seemed to indicate something different.  As far as the two men, they were pretty much along for the ride, drawn in by irresistible forces difficult to explain.  All in all I thought this a very entertaining, hard to pin down, but worthwhile film if you're interested in ookie, offbeat, somewhat supernatural thrillers slathered in cryptic sauce.

The picture, presented in widescreen (1.85:1), enhanced for 16X9 TVs, looks clean and comes across well, and the Dolby Digital mono audio comes across solid with no complaints.  There aren't any extra features, but the disc does include English subtitles.  I suppose an audio commentary by someone involved in the film would have been a nice touch, but, in a way, I'm sort of glad there isn't one as I think it's better to not have someone explaining (exposing) various details of the story, but rather leave the viewer to work out their own conclusions.

Cookieman108

If you enjoyed this feature, I'd recommend checking out a couple of other films titled Carnival of Souls (1962) and The Haunting (1963), as while the material is certainly different in the three, they all possess a spooky, ethereal quality that tends to get under the skin, especially when viewed at night with the lights out, preferably during a thunderstorm.",1157500800,122,6023,4.774783445620789
1246768,4,B00001U0GS,"Young filmmakers, take note: Here's what you can do with a solid idea, a great cast of unknown stage and TV actors, a lot of imagination...and five cents!

In addition to the best title ever, this clever little gem from 1971 has Zohra Lampert, the wonderful Broadway vet and Emmy-winner (for TV's KOJAK) as Jessica. And she's the whole show. I won't give away the punchline, but Lampert plays a very nervous young woman, recently released from a mental institution, whose husband takes her to a remote lakeside house to recuperate. That's the setup, and from then on, everything is from her point of view. Remember that.

It's almost as if you're not watching a movie, but your inside the head of someone who isn't sure of what is real and what isn't. Early '70's horror doesn't get any better than this. An added touch for me is that this was filmed in my home state, and I often visit many of the filming locations, including driving by the ""old Bishop place"", as it is on a main route going to the shoreline in Connecticut.

But I remember it very well.  A young woman, Jessica (Zohra Lampert) is taken to a creepy country house after she has a nervous breakdown for a ""rest"". It's not long before she notices the locals are cold and peculiar. Then she starts seeing the ghost of a another young woman in an old fashioned dress. Her friends think she's going nuts again but then other strange things are happening and Jessica soon has reasons to believe the ""ghost"" is a vampire and that things (and some people) are not at all what they seem. Lampert is good as Jessica and was often seen on 1970's TV. Other familiar faces from TV in the 70's appear here like Gretchen Corbett and Mariclare Costello. I enjoyed it and look forward to the DVD. It's spooky and offbeat enough to recommend to those who go for low budget creepy films.",1149206400,10,967,4.3076923076923075

It's been SO LONG that I've waited for this flick to come out on DVD...

Sure, it's obscure, but so is Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Things, and that one's been out for about six or seven years!!

Jessica was one of the first films I had seen that genuinely creeped me out....

I'll never forget....I was fourteen....it was a Saturday afternoon in early 1982, and the local independant station aired it...

I had been looking forward to it, because at that time I was eager to check out all the weird movies that had been airing (such as the abovementioned Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Things, and They Saved Hitler's Brain).

It was a fine spring Saturday afternoon, but man, oh, man...when that vampire woman came out of the lake, telpathically whispering to Jessica to ""...Stay.....stay...""....wow. Creepy.

That vampire woman was played by Mariclare Costello, a gorgeous actress who also for a time played a teacher on The Waltons.

All this time, the only copy I've ever had was a recording I made off of Cinemax in 1993, and I've since dubbed that fuzzy copy to DVD because I thought this film would never be released in that format, but am I ever glad that it's about to!!

I won't give any real spoilers, but if you're one who loves psychological horror (as opposed to all the glitzy CG FX, etc, ad infinitum), then this very obscure, mostly unknown flick from the early 70's is for you!!!",1148774400,15,1424,4.686746987951807

1246786,4,B00001U0GS,"This sure is creepy, and although it's eventual ""reveal"" is a bit silly, the atmosphere and handling of the main characters is expertly done.

The main strength of the film is the central performance of Zohra Lampert as Jessica, a complex character around who the main events all seem to revolve. Jessica is recovering from a nervous breakdown, and is spending some time with her husband and another male friend in a large remote farmhouse in an isolated countryside location. The trio aren't expecting much company but they find their temporary home already inhabited by a sitting tenant who is an attractive young woman that they end up inviting to stay. The young woman is more attractive and self confident than the nervy Jessica, which sets the scene for a certain amount of painful tension to arise within the group. Unfortunately this is just the tip of a more sinister iceberg, because Jessica soon starts to think that something supernatural is going on, and that they may all be in some kind of danger. The trouble is that because of her past, she wonders whether anyone will believe her.

I mentioned Zohra Lampert's performance already and it's clear that she really makes the film work by being so believeable as Jessica. Nervous, hesitant, eager to please and desperate for her husbands approval, the character is fully realised and its easy to sypathise with her as things start to take a turn for the weird. When Jessica starts to question her own sanity after many efforts to get other people to believe her, you'll be genuinely rooting for her.

Because the character study of Jessica is so good, you may be forgiven for forgetting that this is supposed to be a supernatural drama, and indeed, the spooky elements of the story are not presented on screen as impressively, in fact they come over as a bit too far-fetched. That's not meant to include one superlative sequence in which Jessica is surprised and terrified by a figure emerging from a lake - a scene that stuck in my mind ever since I first watched the movie.

This film really needs to be rediscovered on DVD, so if you have only previously seen it on TV, the release of the recent budget DVD edition is well worth buying.",1147219200,4,2202,4.711688311688311

It's creepy because its all played in a SLOW oddball way one little clue or unexplained breeze away from waht.  Is the heroine (beautifully played by Zohra Lampert) just still nuts or paranoid.  Is it a story about potential infidelity, insecurity and fear in the at the end of the free-love, commune era?  Then it could just be a an old farmhouse with a free-spirited and hungry vampire?  What?  I know.  Somehow it works and is a pretty effect little nerve-racker.",1145750400,,581,4.637254901960785
1246788,5,B00001U0GS,"I first saw this movie at the theater, with my Mom, when it was first released (must have been 1970 or earlier).  I remember that, at one point, I said I couldn't watch, it was too scary, and started to get up from my seat.  She grabbed me and said, ""We paid to see this movie, now we're going to watch it.""

I didn't sleep for the next couple of nights either, even with the light on.

On the other hand, at roughly the same time, I sat through Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead"" and walked out of the theater shaking like a leaf. I could barely light my cigarette.

Maybe I'm getting jaded.  Maybe it was seeing Zohra Lampert (where is she now??) in a commercial for Spic & Span or whatever it was, but time, age, and familiarity do soften the edges a bit.  Still, for a first-timer: watch it in the daytime and with a friend.",1141948800,8,821,4.1257861635220126

Movies don't ""feel"" like this anymore. The fact that the actors look real makes it more ""believable"" I guess. They are not the pumped up, siliconed superstars of the moment. The creepiness of the story is enhanced by the soundtrack, it is there for the mood not for the cash value of selling the soundtrack seperately. Something that I feel ruins some of the current films.

The fact that I grew up near where it was filmed also makes it a bit nostalgic for me. I was a little too young to see it when it came out but have heard about it from time to time in my life. I am so glad I finally found a copy!",1132099200,5,749,4.026845637583893

I especially like the angle of Jessica talking to herself at times. It really adds to the atmosphere of the film.

Lacking the blood and guts of other vampire movies, this one relies on a strong story and stellar acting by Zorah Lambert.

Unraveling the mystery of the house on the island unravels Jessica. She fights throughout only to lose in the end. I think that was the most disturbing part of the movie... the good guy/girl didn't win.

All in all, definitely worth a watch. A keeper for me. Very original plot and great acting.

I would say this movie brings about a new category in horror. Somewhere between a 'B' movie and a classic.",1125705600,4,860,4.35

""Let's Scare Jessica to Death"" is definitely a standout of 70's horror.  It has style to spare and director John Hancock manages to create some genuinely creepy moments.  The concept is intriguing, the dialogue is often profound, and the themes of paranoia and general isanity are exploited to great effect.

However, the actors are just not up to the task.  In particular, the difficult lead role, Jessica, is usually overdone and under-directed.  There is also a major problem (for me) involving a certain photograph and the film's protagonists' unforgivable imperceptivity.

For years afterwards, I could vividly remember the wind blowing those grave rubbings Jessica had pinned to her bedroom wall as well as the ""woman in white"" coming out of the lake.  It's a ""quiet"" movie - not much of a sound track.  More sound design, like Tobe Hooper's ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" which so many people have compared it to.  The water, the wind, the creak of the rocking chair on the front porch (brrrrr!!), the ""voices"" Jessica thinks she hears during the seance - all very subtle and therefore all the more chilling.  This ""little movie"" is definitely an overlooked classic - actually, ""Fangoria"" magazine just did a 3 or 4 page tribute to it in its most recent issue.  I hope they put it out on DVD with lots of commentary and behind-the-scenes (if available) and if they DO a remake, which I've heard rumors about, they keep the quality high as was done for the remakes of ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and ""Dawn of the Dead"".

And yes, I saw this movie again recently and it was not as scary as originally imagined. This is not to say the 1971 dream-like thriller ""Let's Scare Jessica To Death"" is a mediocre horror film. In fact, this film may have been more influential than most realize.
Horror master Stephen King has gone on record as stating this is one of his favorite horror films from this period. It must be noted the film's story is very similar to King's own novel ""Salem's Lot,"" released seveal years later. ""Let's Scare Jessica To Death"" also bears an uncanny resemblance to the 1975 classic ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre."" And let's not forget the very John Carpenter-esque synthesizer musical score (yes, this movie pre-dates Carpenter too), which has much to do with why this film is so unsettling.
Jessica (very well played by Zohra Lampert) has just been released from the asylum after a nervous breakdown. Her husband (Barton Heyman, who played the immortal Dr. Klein in ""The Exorcist"") has purchased an old house in the country where they hope to relocate and start life anew. A hippie best friend comes along for the ride and naturally, the youthful trio drive through the country in a Hearse with the word ""Peace"" painted on the side - well, this is 1971. The house is sinister, to say the least, with a dark past to include the legend of a ghost/vampire walking its grounds. I will not give away the rest of the tale, suffice to say the local town nor the characters are what they seem. The film's dream-like quality is further enhanced by a surpise ending left open to interpretation.
""Let's Scare Jessica To Death"" plays out like one long, unsettling nightmare. Scenes of Jessica running through the woods are reminiscent of similar scenes from ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre."" In fact, take away the chainsaw, and ""Let's Scare Jessica To Death"" and ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" bear striking similarities - young people headed to the country, finding an old dark house, and encountering local yokels with an intense dislike for strangers.
I think the low-budget quality of ""Let's Scare Jessica To Death"" enhances its creepiness. It is abundantly clear this film has been shot entirely on location, with scenes inside of the house having a claustrophobic feel. But I did find some of the supporting performances (Kevin O'Connor, the goofy townspeople) to be so bad as to be distracting, not to mention the at-times ridiculous dialogue.
But with the lights turned out and alone at night, I can't think of a more enjoyable creepfest than ""Let's Scare Jessica To Death"" - an interesting, if not creative, horror film ripe for discovery.",1070928000,73,2799,4.809128630705394

'Hour of the Wolf' had been released something like three years before and I suspect the director was a fan. British viewers of a certain age may also be minded of those BBC 'Ghost Story For Christmas' adaptions of MR James's stories. Unfortunately, the director has neither the budget or sureness with actors to pull of his warped premise. Despite some risible moments and the unnecessary early flyposting of the plot at an antique dealers, any film that pokes fun at the vulnerability of the hippy philosophy can't be all bad.
