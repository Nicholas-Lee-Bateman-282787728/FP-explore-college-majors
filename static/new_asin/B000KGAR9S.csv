8156347,5,B000KGAR9S,"I give this movie a 5-star not because it is historically accurate, but because it is a good, campy couple of hours of entertainment.

It does mix in some historical truth along with heaping doses of hysterical misinformation. The treatment of Lyndon Johnson is hilarious; he is presented as some sort of trusted advisor of the Kennedys when in fact the Kennedys and LBJ were waging a sub rosa war for 3 years.

JFK is also presented as a hawk during the Cuban Missile Crisis, when in fact he was the dove holding back the urges of the JCS, his Cabinet, Congress, and the governors who were all telling him to go to war with Cuba. We know now that that would very likely have resulted in nuclear war with missiles blowing up some American cities and possibly every Russian city and the island of Cuba.

It does also present the canard of Lee Harvey Oswald supposedly trying to shoot Edwin Walker, which was a ridiculous fantasy trumped up post JFK assassination in the government's attempts to demonize Oswald. A terrified Marina told a lot of lies post JFK assassination as she was a marionette doll for the real killers of JFK: LBJ and CIA. They were using her to posthumously frame Oswald. As Marina told Jesse Ventura in 2010: what is more important the truth or the safety of your kids (in 1963 she had two very young children with Oswald).

As for Edwin Walker, he may have been involved in the JFK assassination. LBJ certainly was. CIA-military intelligence and the Texas oil men were at the core of it, too. Gen. Edwin Walker was plugged into all those groups.

So I give this movie a hearty recommendation; but remember you are being given campy entertainment with cartoon characters along with counterfeit money when it comes to historical accuracy.",1356912000,,1759,4.661290322580645
8156348,4,B000KGAR9S,"This is not a right-wing script at all, but a truly American effort that deliberately shows the right-wing in its KKK sheets.  Although the script, acting and casting were imperfect, this is actually a unique perspective on the JFK administration, never seen in film before.  The script hints that ex-General Edwin Walker was directly involved for the JFK assassination - which historical scholarship is only now beginning to reconsider.  With a larger budget this could have been a great movie, and I think it deserves a redux.  The film insinuates a direct linking of the clash between the liberal Kennedys and the racist General Walker with the fatal danger of Dallas.  The portrayal of Bobby Kennedy is exceptional just as the portrayal of two youthful brothers, hip and cool, in the White House, may be more realistic and less idealized than any portrait the viewer is likely to see about the JFK period.",1354320000,,909,4.915032679738562
8156349,2,B000KGAR9S,"A Kennedy movie from a parallel universe. It seems to be written from the perspective of the John Birch Society. Everything is kind of backwards. LBJ is depicted as the voice of reason and integral to all Kennedy decisions. Joseph Kennedy is so far over the top as to be laughable, which is clearly not the intent. At one point he is washing a Cardinal's feet. The Kennedys take their orders from the Catholic Church in this universe. At one point John Kennedy tells an FBI underling to tell Hoover he can have his way with General Walker in the mental institution he was taken to following his arrest. Only the John Birch Society spread such rumors of brainwashing and mental experiments on Walker. The writer/director clearly tips his hand here as to his source material.

This is not as some have written a black comedy or a satire. This is also not as some reviewers have written a type of documentary. Although it does include newsreel footage it is a docudrama covering the Kennedys form the 1960 Democratic Convention on into the major points of the Kennedy administration. Loose and fast with the truth from a right wing angle. Very odd film. Worth it for Kennedy collectors. A real oddity. Both Kennedy actors are in fact really good. LBJ actor is really fantastic. The script is awful due to its obvious anti-Kennedy right wing bias and poor directing magnifies that fact.",1330387200,,1382,4.710743801652892
8156350,3,B000KGAR9S,"PRINCE JACK combines new fiction with vintage documentary footage in an attempt to depict the Kennedy presidency. Robert Hogan as Jack and James F. Kelly as Bobby are weak imitations of the originals, and the story suffers as a result. Madcap comic Kenneth Mars was an odd choice for LBJ, while Robert Guillaume as Martin Luther King is quite good.

The concept of viewing JFK's administration through the eyes of ten prominent men was badly served here by both a weak script and uninspired acting. (This marked the last screen appearance for Dana Andrews and Jim Backus.)

As of 3/09, ""Prince Jack"" was not available on DVD.
