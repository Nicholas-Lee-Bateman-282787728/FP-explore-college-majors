8496490,1,B006CPFS0E,"If you are looking for a collection of ORIGINAL Spike and Tyke cartoons, like I was, then do yourself a favor and do not, I repeat, DO NOT order this because you will be sorely disappointed. I am a great fan of these cartoons and thought that it was wonderful that a collection had finally been released but this one is about 80% NEW, poorly animated cartoons and contains only one original Spike and Tyke. I hope the company does release a thorough collection of the originals one day but until then....don't waste your money on this !!",1337299200,4,537,4.489795918367347
