8323393,3,B001NC9U0U,"These classic films by Cocteau are still amazing in their imagery, actors and special effects.  The films have been restored, and the image and sound are as good as they can be.  Remember these were made in the 1930's and 40's, the film is a bit grainy, micropones then were not good.  But the sound is quite good, the actors speak clearly in french.  Cocteau's vision of Hell being ruled by French postwar bureaucrats is both funny and frightening.  The same men that lost the war for france now rule hell.
There is a problem with this collection for American viewers- the audio is in french, the only subtitles are in Korean. Apparently it never occured to the company that made these that having english subtitles might improve sales. The DVDs arrived with the plastic sleeves crumbling.",1252713600,4,790,4.737226277372263
