There is one fight scene where a bad guy is hit and he forgets to react to the punch for about a second, and then does it anyway!
If you can find a cheap copy, which I'm sure you can, get it!",1057708800,2,303,3.9836065573770494
8079721,5,6305767157,"Anybody reading this should buy this movie now. This is without a doubt the funniest kung-fu movie I've ever seen. Me and my buddies have watched it countless times and we still crack up everytime we see it. This movie has the worst editing I've ever seen, actors with absolutly ZERO talent, horrible special effects, hideous dubbing. So why do we love it? well because it's so bad that it's a classic. The fighting scenes will have you rolling on the floor, the dialogue will crack you up, the extras are funny in how they die, the main villains use horrible weapons (slinky dildo anyone?).  If you have any sense of bizarre humour, do yourself a favor and buy it.",1003795200,,665,4.541666666666667
8079722,5,6305767157,"If you are just one of those people who LOVE cheesy movies, one of those people who really find hong kong action movies amusing... well, this should be your pick. The movie has the worst storyline ever (don't even mind that), and the action sequences are HILARIOUS and VERY, VERY creative. The only thing is that it is done soooo badly, it is very funny. If you are one of those persons who does not laugh at this kind of cheesy things, then this shouldn't be for you... this movie is for very specific people.",982886400,2,510,4.378947368421053
