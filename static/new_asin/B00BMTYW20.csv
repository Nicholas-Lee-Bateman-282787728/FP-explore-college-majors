I really want to see him in more roles like this one. Tyler Perry is great as a cop, he brings it all to this film. This movie leaves you wanting more. I want the dvd now!!! Can't wait for Alex Cross 2!!!!",1354060800,7,364,3.9324324324324325
5650450,2,B00BMTYW20,"This has to be one of the worst movies of the year. Reminds me of John Cena's ""12 Rounds,"" only that was a film masterpiece compared to this. Simply awful!

To quote respected New York film critic Jay Sherman: It Stinks!",1353110400,15,220,4.365853658536586
5650451,3,B00BMTYW20,"The film has only a little character build for master detective Dr. Alex Cross (Tyler Perry) who pays attention to details and then reconstructs the scene, always correctly. In this film Tyler Perry doesn't play his own mom...which may have been an improvement. Alex Cross becomes involved in a complex cat and mouse game with a highly skilled assassin in Matthew Fox.

Cross is aided by his partner Tommy Kane (Edward Burns) and Monica Ashe (Rachel Nichols). The film lacked originality and a good twist. Tyler Perry played a very stiff character, if you can believe that. Tyler's ability to figure things out from little clues should have been the fun part of the film. It worked well in the early scene with his wife (Carmen Ejogo). Instead it was very stiff and infrequently used. His partner should have said a sarcastic, ""Brilliant Holmes!"" at least once.

Parental Guide: Minor F-bomb usage. Implied sex. No nudity. Some torture. 3 stars is pushing it. I thought newly released ""Fire with Fire"" was better.",1352505600,4,1013,4.883720930232558
5650452,2,B00BMTYW20,"In a role made famous by Morgan Freeman, Tyler Perry takes over the character of Alex Cross. ""Alex Cross"" is based on a character created by writer James Patterson. Freeman played the character previously in ""Kiss the Girls"" and ""Along Came a Spider"". This movie is a prequel to the prior films. In ""Alex Cross"", Cross is a homicide detective, not yet an FBI agent. His career has yet to take off and that is somewhat the premise of the film.

When a hitman's mark is left in a fancy neighborhood, tied to a bed and violently tortured, Cross is awoken in the middle of the night to investigate. There is pressure to clean up the case, being so high profile, but quickly Cross discovers that this will be no ordinary case. He has a keen eye, better than most, and his investigation leads him onto the trail of a single man who had the skill to take out three bodyguards and still eliminate his target.

""Alex Cross"" is a mixed bag and will leave a mixed opinion with its audience. The script is interesting. It's always moving and there are many twists and turns. It focuses ample time on the personal connections, as well as the action. For the most part, the actions scenes are well done, especially one that occurs in a high-rise corporate building where they are saddled with the protection of a target in a safe room and are dealing with a skilled assassin. Then there are some scenes that are poorly handled with not just a shaky camera, but a frantically shaky camera. Whether it's the case or not, shaky cameras, in my opinion, are used to cover up actors who aren't good fight actors. This camera was shaking so much, the actors must have been supremely awful.

I couldn't help thinking as the movie played out, that the material was better than the talent on screen and behind the camera. With the exception of Matthew Fox, the acting was lukewarm at best, and even Fox has his moments of over-the-top selling of his craziness. Lines were delivered at times with flair without justification. Perry, at one point, in an effort to be dramatic explaining the suspect they seek to his partners, turns and seems to go off to a distant place. It was disappointing to watch. I had hope that the movie would be better and that Tyler Perry would do well. In fairness, sometimes actors are given a bad rap because the directors don't do enough takes or aren't vigilant enough.

""Alex Cross"" is another one of those movies that I wish would have been better. I wanted to love it and the story deserved it. Unfortunately though, the direction of the film was lackluster. Some things that should have been left for the audience to figure out were fleshed out in a short two-minute and highly unrealistic scene. After watching a film that was disappointedly acted and then enduring a hard to watch shaky camera, it was the final straw.  It's too bad because ""Alex Cross"" had a great story and had its moments, but the best part about the movie was its trailer.",1352246400,21,2955,4.546992481203008
5650453,4,B00BMTYW20,"The subject matter is CRINGE WORTHY. My first introduction to ALEX CROSS---movie or book. The movie HELD MY ATTENTION. The ACTING is GOOD. I am pleased to see TYLER PERRY do so well in his move to DRAMA, and I look forward to seeing him as he pursues this genre. I believe he WILL only get better. (I really LIKE and RESPECT him in real life) The buddy chemistry between Tyler Perry and Ed Burns is good. I was creeped out by alot of the story line. Many chills through the movie. Pretty DEPRAVED stuff. Not for the faint of heart.",1351814400,6,531,4.267326732673268
5650454,3,B00BMTYW20,"Straight up: Didn't think Tyler Perry could do drama. But then I thought about the old saying that the best comedians typically grow up enduring the worst kind of abuses, their humor an outgrowth reflection of pain. So I have respect for Perry crossing over to challenge a new stage, likely using that pain to help him become a more complex, non-comedic, character.

This prequel version of a younger Alex Cross gives us his story before joining the FBI. Already a brilliant investigator, he and his team of cops are suddenly thrust into a strange series of murders. Bad enough the bodies are piling up, but these are not your typical victims. Detroit's elite one-percenters are suddenly being hunted by an insidious killer; one who doesn't appreciate being interrupted or distracted from his mission.

Perry was not bad. Nothing quite like the original, but then who could be? Morgan Freeman is, cinematically speaking, a cultural icon exponentially cubed. Still, all things taken into consideration, his rebooted replacement was very decent. Thankfully, the producers didn't go for an MTV type of recast, hiring some slick songster wanting to break into films. For that alone I'm very grateful.

The choice of Matthew Fox was interesting. He's one of those performers that&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/seemingly-found-his-one-role/dp/B0036EH3WU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">seemingly found his one role</a>. Of course, actors who find that role often learn to detest it, treating it like an albatross hanging from the neck of one's career. Most end up forever boxed. But in this film I found his execution not shabby at all and better than expected; hinting that he has more to offer as a performer. One weakness: I realize that the character's speech impediment was foundational, but thought it limited the performance; if he was going for the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Francis-Dolarhyde-model/dp/B0000509C1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Francis Dolarhyde model</a>, then it should've been more pronounced.

Additionally, Picasso isn't a fully constructed character. We don't get to know the person other than the flimsy details as sketched out in the screenplay, making it that much more difficult to engage. Unfortunate. Felt the role was unfinished and could've easily taken on more weight. And speaking of which...

Absolutely loved that Matt bulked up for the film - he looked fantastic!

The direction was adequate for the subject matter, but lacked creativity. Example: When Alex deciphers the hidden clue to the assassin's next target, we don't get to share that ""Ah ha!"" moment because Director Rob Cohen failed to appreciate the scene as one of us, the audience. We didn't read the script, post storyboards, go thru rehearsal, film, then sit down at the post production edits - for us in the audience it was a new and fresh revelation - and he blew it. A missed opportunity.

Also, I don't appreciate shaky-cam slo-mo with high pass contrast in place of solid fight choreography. If Cohen wanted to showcase CQB skill - showcase the skill. Extraordinarily difficult to screen a battle if it's filmed like the cinematographer dropped acid before the scene commenced; thought we left this kind of cheesy effect back in the 80s.

Again, adequate direction with decent rhythm and solid pacing. And considering this was a Rob Cohen piece, I'm pleased it was adequate. The man is not known for quality.

Overall, decently entertaining with moments of interest and depth. Just wished it had not followed a pre-approved studio template.

Torn between grades. A strong three or a very low four.

Call it a three with hints of a four.

All things considered, and given the end of the film, I'm actually looking forward to another in the series - as long as the producers hire a more skilled director. The franchise and Alex Cross deserves it.",1351296000,40,3935,5.359805510534846
5650455,3,B00BMTYW20,"Saw ALEX CROSS the movie yesterday. Pleasantly surprised by Tyler Perry's dramatic acting, had only seen him in comedic roles, and Matthew Fox did a great job Cross' creepy psychotic nemesis, Picasso. The special effects were impressive and the movie raced along keeping everyone on the edge of their seats until the conclusion, which was an obvious set up for a sequel.  Yes, I enjoyed the movie, but as a fan of James Patterson's Cross books from the very first one I was disappointed that some of the main characters, who seem like old friends, were changed: Cross' childhood buddy, Samson, was replaced by ""Tommy"" a somewhat wimpy white guy played by Edward Burns, and 'Nana Mama"", Cross' feisty little old Grandmother, was little but not old and grumpy rather than feisty. In all, the movie felt as if it had taken parts from many of the books and tried to sew 'em together. Fine as a couple of hours entertainment for someone who has not read the books, but didn't work for this long time fan.",1351036800,106,999,4.6440677966101696
5650456,5,B00BMTYW20,"I could not wait to see this movie for many reasons. I'm a huge fan of James Patterson for years, I admire Tyler Perry for Superb Acting Performance, and thrillers are my all-time favorite genre. This exciting, action-packed thriller aims to please, and this is one of the Best gripping thrillers of 2012 that I certainly can watch again-and-again as I add it to my collection. Alex Cross follows the young, psychologist/detective Tyler Perry, adapted from James Patterson's Bestselling novels, which I am addicted to.  Cross meets his match in a serial killer, Matthew Fox, as the two face-off in a thrilling game of cat and mouse. Then, the mission becomes personal and Cross is pushed to the edge of his psychological limits. The action becomes explosive, the plot is filled with mystery and intense suspense, and the entire cast did an excellent job in Performance. Special Effects very good, and this exciting thriller has you biting your nails throughout. This crime mystery is as mesmerizing as KISS THE GIRLS, and as chilling as ALONG CAME A SPIDER. Tyler Perry is as brilliant and amazing as Morgan Freeman is, and I'm not surprised at all in his excellent Acting Performance. This movie proves that Tyler Perry can play the serious guy as well as the funny guy, and still come out smelling like a rose. Awesome Movie, worth every penny, and can't wait to add the DVD to my favorite mystery/thriller collection. All-In-All, totally satisfied. Highly Recommended to mystery/thriller lovers who enjoy intense suspense with explosive action!",1350691200,28,1547,5.019455252918288
5650457,3,B00BMTYW20,"Avoiding Tyler Perry like the plague has always been a rule of thumb. If you're trying to be an open-minded film critic, you still give a decent amount of films a fair chance even if you're not particularly interested in them or fall into their target audience. Just seeing trailers and TV spots alone for the Madea movies has been enough though and the best thing Perry has done up until this point was be parodied on the ""South Park"" episode ""Funnybot."" Maybe it was that mindset, never getting around to seeing ""Kiss the Girls"" or ""Along Came a Spider,"" and not having any expectations at all that made ""Alex Cross"" more entertaining than it had any right to be.

Perry is going to surprise a lot of people. Alex Cross is an incredibly intelligent homicide detective; his skills are nearly unprecedented. But he's also a family man with two kids, a wife, and another kid on the way. Along with his childhood best friend and partner Tommy Kane (Edward Burns), Cross can handle pretty much anything that is thrown at him. This is his breaking point though. This is the case that pushes him over the edge. A tragic, life-changing event occurs that sends Cross into an emotional downward spiral that leads him down the path of vengeance and away from the rules of the law. Perry deserves at least some credit for portraying as much emotion as he does and is stronger during the sadder moments of the film.

The sole reason you should see ""Alex Cross"" is for Matthew Fox. Fox is a highly skilled assassin with no name, but is known as ""Picasso"" for the art he leaves at the scene of the crime. He has an infatuation for using a drug called TTX, which leaves his victim's completely helpless but aware of the torture he puts them through. Fox is extremely lean and pure muscle in the film. Not only is his appearance unusual for him, but so is his performance. His body movements are so peculiar, his cold stare makes the hair on your arms stand up, and you just know something intense is about to occur whenever that vein in the middle of his forehead pops out. While Fox will probably be best known for ""Lost,"" ""Alex Cross"" is certainly a game changer for him as Picasso is one of the most memorable and chilling villains of the year.

Giancarlo Esposito was really fantastic as the neat, clean, and organized druglord Gustavo ""Gus"" Fring on ""Breaking Bad."" He has such little screen time here and is mostly very forgettable, but the most amusing part about his character is that Cross lays into him about ""knowing chemists"" and demands a name for the person supplying the TTX. It seemed like a blatant homage to ""Breaking Bad,"" but is more amusing if it's just some outstanding coincidence.

Everything the crime thriller has going for it is almost thrown away in the final confrontation between Cross and Picasso. It is really difficult to process just what the hell is going on during their fight scene at the abandoned movie theater. The camera movements are so sloppy, shaky, and fast moving that you can't really tell what's going on. The writing of the film also makes it seem like everyone at the police station who isn't directly involved with Cross or his team is completely incompetent. John C. McGinley as police chief Richard Brookwell is the main offender. He always wants to take charge and wants everything done his way, but in reality he's completely clueless to the task at hand.

Tragic events take a completely mediocre crime thriller and turns ""Alex Cross"" into something a little more worthwhile. The emphasis on that tragedy and the consequences which are constantly being revealed throughout the rest of the film pack a bigger punch than you may be expecting. Tyler Perry reveals that he can portray drama and emotion with ease. Matthew Fox is sick, deranged, and absolutely outstanding. Think of ""Alex Cross"" like popcorn entertainment with extra butter that you didn't ask for, but you'll appreciate in the meantime.",1350604800,5,3941,4.69753979739508

Alex Cross seems to be a character lost between Sherlock Holmes and Detective Monk. It would almost seem they were going for a drug free version of Robert Downey Jrs Sherlock Holmes as he can notice things and was also able to slug it out with the villain.

I did like the villain as he is a ruthless dangerous freak. But I don't think he was developed enough and at times he seemed to forget his training especially when fighting Cross.

I did not care for Alexs team.  They seemed to be more of a filler then a purpose.  Edward Burns is woefully underutilized.

Tyler Perry should never be allowed near a camera or a computer again just to save the world the pain of him making another movie.

At times he is entirely believable as a ""Detective Monk"" wannabe, but other times ""Madea"" appears in his voice when he speaks very fast. I am unsure why Tyler Perry was chosen for this role. This is not a children's movie or a family movie. It is almost a thriller, but not quite. Perhaps Tyler Perry needs a different director when playing in a dramatic role.

The villain played by Matthew Cross was truly a villain. I would like to have seen his character more developed.

Cicely Tyson, born in 1924, plays the mother. It was lovely to see her still acting. She is ageless because as a young woman she played a 104 year old woman. Now she looks 104 and appears ageless. I hope you will go back and watch the Autobiography of Miss Jane Pitman to see her age then and compare to her performance in Alex Cross.

Alex Cross is not a movie that I want to see again. The special effects were excellent, but nothing that I want to see again. This might be a good movie to play while doing something where you need a distraction else like preparing taxes, mopping the floor, or cooking.

Why 3 stars -- the special effects were good. I liked seeing Cicely Tyson still acting. I deducted 2 stars because after rewinding several time, I never could figure out if the villain kidnapped Alex Cross's female co-worker.",1480809600,2,1380,4.464285714285714

When I read the books I pictured someone like Shemar Moore as Alex Cross  and maybe someone like LL Cool J for Sampson (only perhaps a better actor).  I decided to give it a try, despite them casting Tyler Perry.  I had no idea they would change his partner to a wimpy white man.
His best friend is supposed to be the strong, silent type.  Nana Mama was supposed to be a loveable, feisty character, not a grumpy, old woman.  They changed Alex to more of a vigilante than someone who tries to do the right thing.  He was never a bad cop who would steal evidence, or plant evidence.  Even the Butcher didn't stay true to his character.  He wasn't a serial rapist, didn't slash up his victims faces, etc.  They got everyone's character wrong.  They seemed to take little bits and pieces of several books, getting the timeline of events all disjointed.  I wish I could give this one an upside down dog.",1450483200,,970,4.4124293785310735

Mathew Fox was THAT villain!  Psycho & smart, he gave Alex a total run for his money, and had me on the edge of my seat, justing waiting for Justice to claim her due.

This movie is a mess of loud noises, implausible goings on, and inane special effects.

The script is incoherent and makes almost no sense at all. The plot seems to be that Alex Cross is some kind of shrink/cop who goes up against a professional assassin of some sort and eventually wins. Along the way he does all kinds of evil things but they are Ok according to the movie because he ""needed"" to do them to catch the bad guy. Lots of absurd gun play and martial arts.

The end where the evil billionaire gets his just reward is so implausible it made me shake my head. It seemed like it was just tacked on to the rest of the movie to me.",1424044800,,746,4.13103448275862

5650759,3,B00BMTYW20,"As a long time fan of James Patterson's Alex Cross novels, I thought Morgan Freeman was the perfect choice to play Cross, and I loved Kiss The Girls. I was weary of a remake, especially one done by Tyler Perry, but to my surprise he was much better than expected, unfortunately, the film was not. Alex Cross has always been about beating criminals with his mind. The forensic psychologist is best known for his ability to out think rather than over power his opponents, but you'd never know it by watching this film. Alex Cross and his team are called in on a triple homicide, but the suspect had more on his mind then just his targets, and sets his sights on Cross and the team. There is a heavy focus right from the beginning on the bad guy, who we immediately see is Matthew Fox. To me this took all the mystery right out of the story, and instead of being a who done it, the film was about how to catch the bad guy. The writers didn't do that right either, as Alex Cross is blinded by rage and goes out guns blazing to fight and kill the assailant. While this may make for an exciting action film, it's not who or what Alex Cross is all about, and despite all the novels I've read, I felt like I didn't know the characters at all. Tyler Perry stars as Cross and shows that he's more than just a comedian dressed as an old woman. Perry was very intense and likeable, under different circumstances I would have really enjoyed his performance, but again, he wasn't playing the Alex Cross I know. He's paired with Lost's Matthew Fox, who has played the bad guy before. I love Fox as an actor, but he just doesn't have the look or temperament of a killer and wasn't very believable here. Alex Cross is one of my all time favorite characters, and the first time they put him on film, they did it right. The second time, wasn't one of Patterson's better stories, but still very well done. This time, Alex Cross has turned into John McLean, and while some people will love it, to me it just emphasized everything that is wrong with Hollywood today.",1423440000,,2044,4.339425587467363

I was going to rent it to see if I liked it or not but since it was only $5 (now I know why) it made more sense to buy it. If you are bored and just want something new to watch this OK.

5650768,5,B00BMTYW20,"I never cared for the Medea series despite Tyler Perry's immense talent.  They were just not my ""cup of tea"".  So, I wasn't too optimistic about this film.  Mr. Perry is an amazing actor and I was pleasantly delighted to see he can hold his own in my favorite action, shoot-'em-up-type detective dramas.  I thought, no actor can fill Morgan Freeman's shoes in playing this character, but Mr. Perry proved me wrong.  I hope there will be more films in the Cross series which star Mr. Perry and Mr. Burns.  In the books, Nana Mama is not as ""gruff"" as in this film, and I wished her character had been just a teeny bit softer.  Edward Burns did a great job in his performance of Alex's parter and long time friend. The talented Giancarlo Esposito had a great role as a ""not too bad guy"".",1421452800,,785,4.372413793103449

Don't like Detroit being picked as the city he lives in, and really don't like that his best bud is a white guy even if I like the actor that played the part.  Also the head of the FBI is long gone in previous books.  Why mess with what works in the book for the sake of a movie?

5650971,1,B00BMTYW20,"This was bull. With as much dignity as I might want to muster, this plain sucked! It should've never been made into a movie!! Now, I can just see some country broad who loves this movie, sticking her chest out as wide as she can, getting ready to smear her lipstick for the 5th time in the day, with such a challenge as, ""OH, well who the HELL died and made YOU the Alex Cross expert,"" wiggling her oversized chest in the process? Well, I'll tell you right now who died, and his name is ALEX CROSS!!! Why do I have the nerve and the right to make such a statement? Because I happen to be READING the Alex Cross series by James Patterson, and this just makes me sick!

Before I really start to piss people off, maybe I should actually give the good points of the movie.

#1: Alex Cross is black. They actually got that part right. But it's funny, I had a black female friend tell me last night that SHE thought this sucked too, and she's trying to get her husband to see that as well.
#2: The bad guy's actually bad. He's ruthless. They got that right too.
#3: Alex loves his family.

Now, time to piss off the people who truly LOVE this movie, because I'm about to rain down some hell on Tyler Perry's latest. This is the bad!

#1: This movie is so messed up to a James Patterson and Alex Cross fan, the plot doesn't even make sense. Yes, Alex is a family man in this, but not even once does he come off as a thinker, like he does in Patterson's books. He comes off as Madea taking off the Madea mask, and just looking plain freaked out most of the time. In the books, Alex Cross uses his brain, and lets his street smarts do the talking, and he uses his boxing a lot of the time to bring opponents down before bringing out the guns.

#2: Where's John Sampson? Funny, because he was in KISS THE GIRLS, and the role was played perfectly. The only thing that Sampson didn't do during KISS THE GIRLS was refer to Alex as ""Sugar,"" which is a pet nickname for Sampson. In ALEX CROSS, there isn't even the THOUGHT of John Sampson! That's just plain stupid. Outright stupidity.

#3: In the book, it really doesn't take long for Maria to get killed, then for Alex's life to go to the present. In this? It's ALL in the present. Well, that's kinda dumb. This book this is based off of, CROSS, or ALEX CROSS, happens to be book #12 in the series, and Patterson refuses to fudge by making this an early Alex Cross story. It's the story of a killer attacking TODAY, and the killer being Maria's killer.

#4: I'm here to tell you that if the REAL Nana Mama were to watch this, she'd probably slap the director before she invited him in for coffee. Cicely Tyson has some talent, but she ain't no Nana Mama. No way, no how.

#5: Alex gets on his partner's case for sleeping with another female detective. That's Tyler Perry talking, because Alex can't keep it in his pants most of the time, especially when he gets a new female partner from the force. At least that's the case some of the time.

#6: As far as the piano playing goes, it happens to be Alex's way of winding down. In this, Alex shows his daughter how to do some piece and make it better, but he never really tags out anything on his own. Alex Cross in the books is a maestro!

#7: It all just plain sucks, and that's the way it is.

So, in saying all of that, I really don't know what I was supposed to be watching. Because it certainly wasn't Alex Cross on camera. It was more like Alex WHO, and I'm just glad it was inter-library loaned, and that no money was wasted on this crap!",1395964800,,3531,4.185567010309279

5650994,3,B00BMTYW20,"James Patterson's novels have given us some memorable characters and one of the more memorable is Dr Alex Cross, a homicide detective/psychologist with the Detroit Police Department. The always-popular Madea of Tyler Perry's creation steps out of the drag costume this time around and becomes a very credible Dr. Alex Cross: the transition is comfortable and encouraging for him as an actor.

Dr. Alex Cross (Tyler Perry) with the help of his aide Thomas Kane (Edward Burns) is on his last police duty to track down an assassin called Picasso (Matthew Fox), who's been torturing and killing rich businessmen in Detroit. When Cross' wife is killed by Picasso the mission becomes exceedingly personal, Cross is pushed to the edge of his moral and psychological limits to end this once and for all and from that point on the movie gains speed and is well resolved. There are some fine cameos by Cicely Tyson, Jean Reno, Chad Lindberg, Carmen Ejogo and Giancarlo Esposito.

The screenplay gets a bit self indulgent and sappy at times but the movie as a hole comes off well. Tyler Perry has more chutzpah than we've seen before. Grady Harp, February 14",1392940800,,1147,4.876923076923077

All the posing and moaning had me cracking up, and it was supposed to be hot! Not! It really was pretty funny, and this isn't a comedy!

I wish they had cast Denzel, but it wouldn't have mattered, because the story sucks. Rachel Nichols does a great job, but her character is only incidental.
You'll find yourself completely disgusted by the racial stereotypes that are consistently utilized along the film. The bad guy's M.O. is clear, but his motivation is never explained, which is what makes the book slightly better. SPOILER ALERT: The inconsistency is so abhorrent, that the identity of the killer, the one who kills Alex Cross's wife, is different in the movie.

5651018,3,B00BMTYW20,"Rob Cohens Alex Cross, based on a novel by James Patterson, had a lot of potential. It has some decent mystery built in, and at least one stellar performance. Sadly, it is bogged down with ratings restrictions, more mediocre performances, plot holes, and exceptionally bad dialogue. This is one of those movies that could have been great, but comes off rather forgettable.

Detective Alex Cross (Tyler Perry attempting to break out of comedy) is a criminal profiler in Detroit. He and his team (forgettably portrayed by Edward Burns and Rachel Nichols) have made a name for themselves solving high profile cases with ingenuity and guts. When a horrific multiple murder in a ritzy neighborhood turns out to be the work of a sadistic assassin, the team follows hot on his trail trying to bring him down before he can claim another victim. When they foil his next assassination attempt, the killer takes it personally and seeks revenge against the investigators who dared to defy him.

A lot happens in this movie, but there isn't much to write about. Matthew Fox as the killer is the one truly bright spot in an otherwise blas movie. His performance deserved so much more than the script had to offer him, but he steals the show. Judging by his performance and the basic premise of the film, the movie seemed like it was intended to be much more edgy and dark. Sadly, this movie suffers the curse of the dreaded PG-13 that Hollywood loves to impose on their more violent movies so as to get a few more bucks out of the coveted 13-18 year old demographic. In a movie where a man calmly cuts off a womans fingers one by one just for fun, there is little to no blood to be seen and I have heard more swearing from soccer moms. I am not saying movies need to be gory or foul to be good, but sometimes the subject matter needs to be treated a bit more realistically. When people get shot in the chest a small puff of dust is not usually the result.

Tyler Perry makes a valiant attempt at dramatic acting with this role, but he seemed woefully out of his depth. Most of the time he was bland and forgettable and seemed to be struggling to find the right emotion with his face and voice. There were a few good moments, but it is not a good sign when you are getting out acted in a scene with a ten year old.

The action-packed climax had its moments, but was fraught with plot holes and laughable inconsistencies. I found it more than a little unbelievable that Perry could go toe to toe with Fox, especially considering how the movie established Fox as such a brutal fighter earlier. Foxs last line in the movie makes no sense and the convenient the cops show up after everything is over trope was so poorly executed that I wanted to call a foul on the play. The epilogue of the movie was contrived and felt tacked on as a cheap way of writing the movie out of a corner. The closing scene after the epilogue (yes, you read that right) felt like cheap sentimentality considering the seriousness of the subject matter and lacked any genuine emotion.

Alex Cross may have started out as a good story with a real plot, but once the screenwriters, director, and producers got hold of it, it got jumbled and turned into boring, easily digestible mush. It is not a bad movie, per se, but it is far from being a good movie. The story never seems to know if it wants to be about Cross or the killer. There is so much speculation about the killer, but no closure is ever given and though that kind of open-ended narrative can work in the right movie, here it does not. Matthew Foxs performance is the only thing that keeps the viewers attention, and I wish they had re-edited this movie as a solid R rating and given it a rewrite instead of cutting it off at the knees with a PG-13. It probably would have been a far superior film.",1389916800,,3814,4.4196301564722615

5651042,5,B00BMTYW20,"Wow...this is a really good movie!  I read the reviews prior to purchasing and I almost didn't purchase based on some critical reviews.  Tyler Perry REALLY HELD HIS OWN in this Detective Drama.  Once again, Tyler Perry has proven his talent; also has proven his ability to handle roles outside of the ""Madea"" character. The movie is PG-13 and very tastefully done. Its full of suspense; and captivating twists and turns that kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time.  Its full of high impact for those that enjoy the ""High Action"" type movies and what I enjoyed most of all its clean...no F-bombs! I have no buyer regrets here.  Get it...watch it...you be the judge, just don't forget the popcorn, as that is the only thing I was missing...lol!!!  Will definitely enjoy watching this movie again.",1387324800,,801,4.685714285714286

I like them but they are not for me.  I am more of a action movie, sci fi, and drama movie.  I like comedy in a movie that is not too much.

In this movie he really shows me another side of his acting skills I hope he will make another movie like this one.  The story line is good and a lot of action and drama, also it shows how he loved his family and his relationship to his family.  The story shows his relationship with his partner which is more like a brother.",1386288000,,624,3.6818181818181817

5651063,1,B00BMTYW20,"This movie in my mind was almost a total and complete failure.  The only character in the film that has any substance is the one portrayed by Matthew Fox - and that isn't really a good thing.  There needed to be more balance.  The other characters aren't really developed very well at all and there's this sense of phoniness (preaching one thing and doing another) which I find a little unnerving -  I feel that Mr. Perry really tried to make this character work, but the script was such that he didn't have much to work with.  I don't know much about Dr. Cross other than what I'm told - it doesn't do much for me as far as getting me to like the hero and getting me to be sympathetic to him.  The film tells me that he is very experienced, but I get the impression from watching the film that he really is a novice, and doesn't know much about detective work, and then at the end I'm supposed to believe that he pulled it all together.  What a bunch of BS - it was just a bad film overall.  Like I said, the only character in the film that is sold out to making the film work is the one played by Matthew Fox - he does this role perfectly.  But one person doesn't make the whole film work, and I didn't think this was a good movie at all.  I think Tyler Perry did try to make the movie his own, but that's part of the problem too.  You are supposed to convince me why I'm supposed to care, and you didn't do that very well.  Maybe it's my attitude as a movie watcher - but it's your job to engage me. And not only did I not really believe the line of BS that I was watching that I really think this movie communicated this in a manner which wasn't exactly how Mr. Patterson intended and it communicated some messages which go against what you are telling me the character ""believed"" to begin with.  So this say one thing and do another turned me off.  It wasn't very believable to me overall.  The flow of the movie wasn't very good overall.  Honestly, if it weren't for Matthew Fox I would have given it 0 stars.  I hope my review doesn't anger anyone.  I'm not seeking to offend people.  I'm just trying to be honest about the movie.  I thought it was a bad movie.",1384992000,,2168,4.128878281622912

5651066,4,B00BMTYW20,The movie was not awful-- it just did not live up to the books.  First of all- nobody can do Alex Cross like Morgan Freeman did.  Tyler Perry just is not serious enough.  Some of the supporting cast seemed almost trite and had to be explained too much.  And quite frankly-- Alex Cross would NEVER have done some of the things that happened at the end. I don't want to give anything away but even in anger it would not be in his nature to do what he did in the end of the movie.  Even for vengeance.  I did not agree with the ending at all.  The Nana Mama character was not true to how she was in the books at all.  I will stick to the books from now on unless they bring back Morgan Freeman for the part!!!!,1384387200,,707,3.9645390070921986

5651167,2,B00BMTYW20,"Alex Cross is the movie based on Cross, the twelfth book in the Alex Cross series by American author, James Patterson. The credits say ""based on the book, Cross, by James Patterson"". I would amend that to ""very loosely based on"". There are two similarities to the book: 1. Alex Cross is a black policeman; 2. Alex Cross is after his wife's killer. This is a drama/action movie with very little relation to the Alex Cross books. Fans of action/drama may enjoy this. Fans of the books will be disappointed.",1373760000,,504,4.611111111111111

Tyler Perry fits for the detective role. However his actions are a tad bit slow for an action movie of this sort.

I understand that it was not feasible to use Freeman in this particular film but the actor did not come across like the cerebral character that Patterson created.

I think when you read all of the Cross novels, you as an individual, create the image/demeanor of the character and Tyler Perry (although good in other movies) just wasn't my Alex Cross.  Just like casting  Tom Cruise in Reacher.....Mr. Cruise has a pretty face, but in each of Jack Reacher's novels, his enormous SIZE (6'5"") is a BIG part of his character.",1372636800,,468,4.482352941176471

5651217,4,B00BMTYW20,"ALEX CROSS has all the ingredients we expect in a film of its sort: an engaging plot-line, a criminal we love to hate and want to see ""get his,"" harrowing chase scenes, a couple of real surprises, etc. It also has several of the corninesses and unlikelihoods that are usually found in a film of this genre, but oh well.

Tyler Perry plays the role of the lead character, a combination psychologist-profiler-homicide detective, very naturally, and the character he plays is better developed than those in many thrillers. Matthew Fox is similarly good in the role of the psychopathic bad guy. Most of the supporting cast play their roles quite believably: There are some truly interesting characters in this film, e.g., Cicely Tyson as ""Nana Mama.""

Notably, ALEX CROSS succeeds in being rivetingly disturbing without a lot of gore, ultra-violence, or any serious sex/nudity to spice the cake (hence, the PG-13 rating).",1371686400,,917,5.026315789473684

The storyline stays somewhat close to the book but typically Hollywood cant resist tinkering for more dramatic effect, fortunately in this case they did not destroy the thrust of the original plot.

5651273,5,B00BMTYW20,"I have been an ""Alex Cross"" fan for a while now and I just love the novel series!  I saw the other two adaptions with Morgan Freeman (a living legend) as our favorite detective, Det. Alex Cross.  ""Kiss the Girls"" was an amazing adaption that captured the world of the novel it was based off of so beautifully and awesome.  As for ""Along Came A Spider""..... no so much.  But I did enjoy Morgan Freeman.

Now comes the next step into the world of Alex Cross and we are getting a ""reboot"" this time.  In this third adaption, we see none other than Tyler Perry take the role as Det. Alex Cross and just unleash his acting skills into making the character come to life.  Thank goodness that his time as ""Medea"" paid off.  And we also get to see new blood into the world as well.  Sure, the movie doesn't exactly remain completely true to the novels, but it does a great job at capturing the dark theme of the novels like ""Kiss the Girls"" did.

Okay, I can understand why people don't like Rob Cohen as a director.  The only movie I ever liked that he made was ""Triple X"".  The guy isn't really that good at making a movie.  No offense to him, it's just the truth.  But despite that the director doesn't really have my attention, the storyline wasn't really that bad.  Sure, it needs some work, but it actually has a great emotional presence that just does a great job at bringing the dark and light themes from the novels and into the movies.

The movie is an adaption of the twelfth novel in series, ""Cross"".  The movie doesn't exactly follow the novel like ""Kiss the Girls"" or ""Along Came A Spider"" did.  In fact, the movie actually borrows from the other novels and also just goes its own way for once.  The only thing that it actually remains loyal to, is the fact that Alex Cross is a honest detective and will do anything to protect his family from danger, while going after a killer at the same time.  Even though the movie doesn't follow the novel very well, it does bring the atmosphere of the novel and the dark presence to life.

The characters are freaking amazing as well!  As usual, we have Mr. Tyler Perry, who not only brings Alex Cross to life with his acting and personality skills, but with his physically presence too.  We even see him as a loving husband and loving father to his kids, which we never saw in the other two movies.  We even get to see him in action as a detective and as a psychiatrist, which we are familiar to, but on a whole new level when Mr. Perry goes to work.  We also have Alex's partner and new character, Det. Tom Kane, who replaces John Sampson from the novel series, but keeps a great relation to John's character.  While Tom isn't really that interesting, he is fun to see around Alex, as they make jokes and talk about their fun times as kids.  We also have the sycho villain, Michael ""The Butcher"" Sullivan!  While he is called the Butcher, his real name is never fully given, except for in the novel.  Michael Fox is at his best as the evil assassin and proves to be one amazing adversary to Alex himself.  Michael makes this character so scary, that you will be praying for Alex's safety against him.  And finally, we have Alex's family.  In the movie, we get to finally meet Alex's kids, grandma, and wife for the first time.  While we do get a glimpse of Janelle and Nana Mama from ""Kiss the Girls"", we finally get to see them having big roles in this movie.  Both Damon and Janelle show us what life is like for Alex as he comes home from work and spends his time with them and also what it is like when they lose someone they love.  Nana Mama is.... well... Nana Mama.  Still Mrs. Grumpy and Bossy lady who is almost just like her ordinary self from the novels, except for the moments when she comforts Alex in hard times, which we don't see in the movie.  Maria Cross, the wife of Alex, is indeed beautiful as they say in the twelve book, with the exception of her personality.  In the past movies, there is no mention of Maria, except for a brief hint in ""Kiss the Girls"", when we see Alex touching his wedding on his finger, referencing to his marriage with Maria.  Her character is do very well in the movie, providing a very emotional moment when a unexpected situation happens.  Trust me, all of these characters are done beautifully!  While some characters have been replaced or personalities changed around, you love every minute of them.

I know that some of you didn't like the storyline or didn't like the directing of the movie, but come on!  The acting and the theme of the movie wasn't all that bad.  There are worse movies out there.  The graphics were okay and the fast-pace was almost like from the novel.  You got to love Tyler Perry and Michael Fox as they bring their characters to life and make the world of Alex Cross real as possible.  I hear that a sequel is going to be made, which will be the thirteen novel, ""Double Cross"".  Please try to help get another movie going, because I can promise you this, if a new director and new scriptwriter help out with this new adaption, the sequel will be way better.  Trust me on that!

5651323,3,B00BMTYW20,"I've been a fan of James Patterson's Alex Cross series since I first read Mary, Mary. Quickly, I got my hands on a copy Along Came A Spider, and have read every Cross novel since. There have been adaptations of Along Came A Spider and Kiss the Girls, both staring Morgan Freeman as Alex Cross. With Hollywoods recent trend of sequels and remakes/reboots, it came as no surprise when I heard that a new incarnation of the Alex Cross series was beginning production.

Based on the novel, Cross, a kind of new direction for the books as well, I was more surprised when I heard Tyler Perry had been cast as the famed detective. Known more for his comedies than his serious work, Perry was a bold choice that could have potentially changed the direction of his career. With the talented Matthew Fox (most famous perhaps for his role on the T.V. series LOST) playing the main villain in the film, it seemed viewers were in for a real treat.

Unfortunately, the actors are never allowed to reach their full potential. While Fox really plays a deplorable villain and Perry shows surprising dramatic chops, they are both weighed down by a script that is simply not good enough. Patterson has never been one to worry about the plausibility of his stories, but the film mostly ignores Patterson's plot, taking the story into even more unbelievable directions. Both characters hint at deeper emotional backstories, but plot never allows them or the audience to delve past the surface. Rather, they are used more as pawns to lead us through a cat and mouse game that comes to an unsatisfying conclusion. For casual action fans, this film is a fine escape that doesn't require much thinking and has a few promising scenes. For fans of Patterson and his Alex Cross series, this movie uses the name Alex Cross for a character that only slightly resembles the one in Patterson's novels. If you're looking for something a little closer to the novels, check out the Morgan Freeman films instead.",1368576000,2,1976,4.72463768115942
5651324,3,B00BMTYW20,This movie really doesn't live up to the book it was based on. Tyler Perry is not Alex cross and seems to be lost as to how to play the part.,1368230400,,141,3.5806451612903225

5651326,3,B00BMTYW20,"The villain (Matthew Fox) is probably the highlight of this movie.  Tyler Perry's acting is OK at best, story line isn't that unique really, there's a few minor twists/events you don't necessarily expect, but nothing to really push this movie above average.  It's OK if you just need an action movie fix or really like any of the particular actors, but definitely nothing you need to see.",1368144000,,388,4.776119402985074

5651354,1,B00BMTYW20,"First off Tyler Perry was not a good choice to portray alex cross he just over does his seriousness it's actually quite funny though. obviously never read any of James Patterson's books or anyone who wrote the script for that matter. Detroit? Really? If you read any of the cross books you know what I mean especially ""CROSS"" which starts out we alex and Maria in an apartment in dc with their two kids Damon and Jannie. Alex and Sampson are watching a drug lord who has a hit on his head from the New York mafia. The butcher of Sligo is the hit man. He takes out the drug Lord OUT right in front of alex and Sampson. Maria meanwhile counsels a young woman who has been brutality raped.all of a sudden Maria gets shot right I front of alex.flash forward to the present alex ups and retires from the fbi and starts up private practice as a psychologist only to get a lead on Maria's killer the butcher who's back causing mayhem. Hunted by his former employers the mafia he starts hunting them down one by one. Alex and Sampson team up to go after him when they finally catch up to the butcher he tells alex he didn't kill his wife alex believes him only to kill him in self-defense. Sampson tells alex something he's been hiding for years he killed Maria's killer a few months after her murder James ""Jimmy hats"" who was a friend of Mike Sullivan aka the butcher. So that leaves big ? Marks in my mind why the big plot shift? Where's Sampson? What's with the white dude? Where did the name Picasso come from? Besides the fact he cuts his victims up? I did like Mathew Fox as the butcher. Nana mama was great too except the fact that she's Alex's grandma not mom leave comments let me know what I'm leaving out. They should've named Tyler Perry the butcher cause he butchered this film along with writers and director",1367539200,,1815,4.35693215339233

Yes the writing is often predictable but Matthew Perry is wasted in a superb performance as a scary bad guy by the lack of tension created by Perry.  The film overreaches and never reflects the dark overtones to really make it thrilling.  It's not over-the-top terrible, it just never generates the requisite level of anxiety needed to satisfy.

5651392,2,B00BMTYW20,Good action and acting. However the story felt unfinished and underdeveloped. Could have been a good movie but the story line was disappointing and had gaps to say the least.,1366329600,,174,4.833333333333333

5651426,2,B00BMTYW20,"Tyler Perry plays Alex Cross, a Detroit police detective with a doctorate in abnormal psychology. Created by James Patterson, Alex Cross is a unique person, a family man and highly trained homicide detective with Sherlock Holmes-like abilities of observation and deduction, and in the new film he is pushed to the edge when a sadistic serial killer ""Picasso"" (very chilling Matthew Fox) with a penchant for torture arrives in the town. This sounds interesting, but in reality ""Alex Cross"" is just another run-of-the-mill thriller.

Tyler Perry (nominated for Razzie for this role) is not that bad, but he is not that good, either. The film's biggest problem is its weak screenplay that doesn't offer us anything fresh or original, and the lackluster direction of Rob Cohen, who did far better jobs in ""The Fast and The Furious"" and ""Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story."" With the film's sluggish pace and lack of suspense, it seems he is not really interested in making the story compelling. Supporting players including Edward Burns, Jean Reno and Cicely Tyson are all wasted.

""Alex Cross"" is an attempt of Hollywood studios to reboot the Alex Cross series, but the result is only a dull and generic action movie. Two previous Alex Cross movies ""Kiss the Girls"" and ""Along Came a Spider"" were not particularly great, but with charismatic Morgan Freeman as the protagonist they were not boring, which ""Alex Cross"" exactly is.",1365552000,,1418,5.004237288135593
5651427,3,B00BMTYW20,"This was probably a much better book than a movie.  At under two hours, the plot moved so quickly that there wasn't much time to get to care about the characters.  The ending where the bad guy confesses everything over the phone was so phony, trite, and overused that I was annoyed by it.",1365552000,,288,4.314814814814815

Now I can order movies! Good quality clear movies. James Patterson is my favorite and Tyler Perry as Alex; I love it! Seriously speaking, I ordered the movie and it was delivered as scheduled. But no DVD (April Fool joke maybe). I contact Amazon via email and it was corrected within 24 hours. Now that's customer service. Until that mishap I never had any problems with anything I received from Amazon. Thank you Amazon you're the best.......",1365465600,,604,4.45045045045045
5651440,3,B00BMTYW20,"I really like Tyler Perry in dramatic roles. Unfortunately, something was missing from this film for me. It was slow moving until about half way through and it certainly wasn't anything that I hadn't seen in other cop movies. It had a great cast, but not much to work with. Matthew Fox was very unnerving as the antagonist, but still, not enough meat for the actors to chew on. I haven't read the Alex Cross books, so those who have might enjoy this more (or less...) than I did. I'm hoping that if they make more Alex Cross films, they develop a script worthy of these high calibre actors.",1365465600,,590,4.422018348623853

5651444,4,B00BMTYW20,I really didn't expect much since I've never been a Tyler Perry fan.  But I actually liked the movie and was impressed with how well he transitioned from Madea to Cross.  I'd say its worth a watch.,1365379200,,197,4.297297297297297
5651445,1,B00BMTYW20,Might like the movie if I could watch it.  Tried to watch the movie the other night but it will not play.  My blue ray player software is updated and I had watched James Bond Skyfall just prior to trying to watch this movie and have watched other movies since then. Because it was more than 14 days after I had recevied the movie I was unable to return it. This is the first time I have been disapointed with Amazon.,1365379200,,416,4.1234567901234565

5651458,5,B00BMTYW20,"Why not.  I like his films and like him as a person.. if you don' like any of his films.. he comes off as not authentic but if you study his ""bad guys"" he put in his plays and then (buy into the fantasy) of how the ""loving, understanding"" father is pushed to the breaking point... then the ""hell you keep back finally breaks loose"" with the Tyler Perry moral quandary only sprinkled..  Doesn't really give any back-story to the characters is my only gripe...especially the ""killer""... the ""past didn't make sense for the present.. but it is a good action story and entertaining.. so  a success all around.  If you looking for a ""deep"" story... look elsewhere.",1365292800,,659,4.559322033898305
5651459,3,B00BMTYW20,"Those of us who have followed the book series for many years already knew about Maria.  That's the most important thing we learn in this movie.  Alex's first wife was shot and killed.  I don't think the film had anything else to do with the books.  Which is ok.  But, if I had my choice, I would rather read the books than watch the movies.  I found Tyler Perry to be somewhat flat as Alex Cross.  Cicely Tyson, who is a very good actress, did not pull off the Nana Mama character we love, with her ""tough love"".  She just seemed somewhat angry.  I don't care about who his partner is or was.,  I wanted Sampson.  So, I will plan to stay away from the films and read the books from now on.  That way I can use my imagination to picture these people that I've grown to care about over the last 15 or so years.  I do want to say that Matthew Fox makes a very good creepy, psycho bad guy using very little dialogue.",1365292800,,912,4.084745762711864

First off, it seems like he just got done telling a joke just before each serious scene, because he just looks that way.  Not everyone can act, and I think that's the case with Tyler Perry.  Also, this is not a well written script.  This movie doesn't come even close to the first two Alex Cross movies - Along Came A Spider, and Kiss The Girls - both of which were excellent in my opinion.",1365033600,,447,4.162790697674419

He just walks through every frame of the film like he's thinking about being intimate with women like it's the most natural thing in the world. I for one, could see him in the bedroom with a host of very very attractive women: Nigela Lawson for one. Maybe a Liza Minelli for those of us who might remember her.

I'm hoping Tyler does a one-man song and dance show with lots of kick dancing and singing and shirtless men as his backup dancers.",1365033600,,697,4.4375

Paterson's written form of the Alex Cross novels is an art where he has made us visualize the people in the stories like we know them as the character has progressed.

I adore Cicely Tyson, but she's not the character Nana-Mama in James Patterson's books; however, I think tyler Perry was a better Alex Cross than Morgan Freeman, who I felt was too old.

I learned while watching this movie, ALEX CROSS is actually a character a Morgan freeman developed as he was Alex Cross/detective, psychologist, in movies like ""Don't Kiss the Girls"" w/Monica Potter and another movie he made with Ashley Judd he also, played this character. If I had to choose, of course Mr Freeman is the better actor ! but we can give and hope Mr Perry, continues to do better roles in the future and stays away from them MADEAS movies, ""come on Tyler, YOU can do better.",1364083200,,829,4.286624203821656

5651549,3,B00BMTYW20,"Having read many of Patterson's books and having seen the other Alex Cross movies with Morgan Freeman as the older Alex Cross, I was looking forward to this movie with Tyler Perry as the younger, definitely hotter Alex Cross.  Unfortunately, only a few minutes into the film, I could tell this one would be a bit disappointing.  The acting is passable, but there wasn't a real sense of camaraderie between the characters--no believable connection, no magnetism. SPOILER ALERT for those who never read the novels: When the lady loves are murdered, the events just moved the plot along, but I didn't get a real feel for the tragedy and loss. It just happened. Move on to the next scene.

Cecily Tyson is such an amazing actress, and her character in the novels is so strong, but somehow even her performance felt a little flat to me.  I'm going to blame it all on the director and possibly the editor, rather than the actors, since the pace didn't work for me either.  At any rate, the movie is okay, so if you like Tyler Perry or James Patterson's books, you might still enjoy this film as long as you don't expect too much from it.",1364083200,,1131,4.5245098039215685

5651562,1,B00BMTYW20,"I'm a HUGE fan of murder/mystery thrillers.  Although I've never read any of Patterson's books, I'm a HUGE fan of several others such as Michael Connelly, Craig Johnson, Elmore Leonard, and several others.  And I very much enjoyed the other two adaptations of Patterson's ""Kiss The Girls"" and ""Along Came A Spider"".  The saddest part about this movie is that it now is part of the Alex Cross movie franchise, and reducing the chance that hollywood will decide whether or not to make more of these types of movies based on this pathetic attempt.

I'm not sure who I blame more for this failure, the director or the screenwriters.  The actors did a passable job, although they tend to pale considerably when compared to the actors in previous Alex Cross movies.  Tyler Perry stepping into the role established by Morgan Freeman??  Really????

This movie turned out more like a poor man's James Bond than a murder/mystery thriller.  Shallow, stereotypical bad guys, rich guys, good guys, family scenes so sweet you'd think it was a Disney movie from the 60's, dialogue fitting ""Hawaii Five-0"" (the 60's version).  The list goes on and on.  I found myself being totally insulted by this creative team's assumption their audience would know nothing about police procedures, investigative procedures, almost every aspect of this movie.  There was even one scene in which they were having a mixed martial arts competition and one of the competitors knocks the other one down, then prances around the ring as if the guy that's down must take a mandatory 8 count before continuing.  Or the scene in which they come to the rich guy's building because they believe the antagonist is coming after him, and are held back by private security guards because they can't come in without a warrant.  Hint to the director, police don't need a warrant to enter if there is reason to believe someone is in danger of being hurt or killed.  Simple stuff like that should NEVER slip by the creative team making a police-based thriller.

5651580,3,B00BMTYW20,"Tyler Perry's early portrayal of the Alec Cross' character and like likability pumps up the quality of the picture. Matthew Fox plays a creepy villain.

However, the story and its presentation is hit or miss at best. It's very much of a cat and mouse game with the usual and expected elements.

Also starring Ed Burns and Jean Reno.

This is the third film appearance of the character Alex Cross, the main character in a series of novels by James Patterson. Cross was previously portrayed by Morgan Freeman in Kiss the Girls (1997) and Along Came a Spider (2001). In 2010, Idris Elba was hired to play Cross but he was replaced by Perry. Prior to the film's release, it was announced that Double Cross would be adapted into a film with Perry reprising his role. (Wiki).

The budget was $35M and it made a bit over $32M at the Box Office.

CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B to B plus; STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: C plus; THRILLER PACE/CLUE TRAILS: B minus; ACTION SCENES: B minus; SOUND/MUSIC: B minus; CINEMATOGRAPHY: B minus to B; WHEN WATCHED: mid March 2013; OVERALL GRADE:  B minus to B.",1363737600,,1076,4.696808510638298

5651606,2,B00BMTYW20,"Liked:
(1) Tyler Perry and Ed Burns are good; Cicely Tyson is good except in one scene, which I'll mention in the Disliked section; Mathew Fox was good, and the actress who played Tyler Perry's wife gave one of the best death scene performances I've seen, she was very believable; the lady who played Tyler and Ed's partner was good; the leads were mostly fine.
(2) Strong scene when Cicely Tyson's character tried to convince Tyler Perry's character not to seek revenge - best scene in the script.  Both characters told the truth, which I liked.
Disliked:
(1) Script - poorly executed story.  This story was the first time I'd seen or heard of the character so I knew nothing about him, and the opening sequences of him chasing down a criminal, chastising his co-workers (""you're like 6th graders""), going to visit a prisoner, then home, seeing him with his child and his mom - it was all too little information and poorly told, too choppy and abrupt for me to get a sense of him.  First, criticizing his co-workers, the writer should have shown me how they failed.  All I saw was 3 officers chasing a male, who they told numerous times to halt, and the suspect failed to do so.  In real life, if 3 police officers are chasing you and tell you numerous times to halt, and you do not, you most likely will be shot, multiple times, and probably will die.  Most American citizens know this, even many children know, so adults do certainly.  When one officer character shot the suspect in the leg, and the Tyler Perry and Ed Burns characters didn't, I found it unbelievable.  The writer should have shown me on what grounds Tyler Perry's character had to criticize the other two; at least the female officer slowed the suspect down.
Why did Alex Cross go visit the convict - in his discussion with her he said he believed she was innocent and was taking the rap for a family member - if he believed it was so, and he wanted her released, why didn't the writer show him working toward that goal.  Why would a prisoner trust a police officer she never met before she got into trouble?  Why did Alex Cross care about her particularly?  The writer needed to show the connection between him and the prisoner.  Alex Cross is a police officer, it makes sense a convict would be suspicious of him, and the audience is given no information about his motives.  This is the beginning of the story and this lack of information is not good.  The writer is supposed to be helping the audience enter the story, helping us to understand, attach to (care about) Alex Cross; we need to know what makes him tick - and the writer needs to show us, not tell us.  If Alex is trying to free an innocent person we need to see him working towards that with other officials either before he met with the prisoner or after, and we need to be told why he believes she's innocent, and, why he cares.  He says she has no priors, and that it doesn't make sense for her to suddenly kill these people, whereas her uncle has a long rap sheet and would go to prison basically for the rest of his life.  Okay, but why does he think this about a person he doesn't know?  The audience needs to see something (witness some information) regarding how he reached this conclusion.  After all, killers kill for the first time every day.  What was unusual about this person, as a first time killer, that made her stand out?  People with no previous criminal record perform heinous acts everyday.  It is not unusual to read in the paper that a psychopath had no previous criminal record, so what about this particular character made Alex Cross suspect she was taking the fall.
The interaction between Alex Cross and his daughter is awkward, and should have been better written.
Cicely Tyson's character came on too strong in ordering her granddaughter upstairs to do her homework.  It would have been okay if the writer had shown the audience her previously ordering the child, and the kid disobeying, to perhaps impishly get out of doing her homework by playing piano for her father, who hadn't known about the previous order.  Something along those lines; anything that made sense.  All grandparents are not soft and cuddly, but when they are coming down on their grandchild even harsher than the parent, the writer needs to show why.  Tyler Perry's character didn't say ""but mom, she was just showing me blah, blah, blah,"" which would have made sense, given his mom's harsh tone.  Poor writing; this is our lead, this is his family, this is our family, our attaching characters in the story, and we need to recognize their behavior, at the very least.
(2) Editing - poor, no good transitions, perhaps they were not shot.
(3) Music - didn't care for it.
(4) Villain - weakest link.  Mathew Fox was fine, this is criticism of the character, how he was written.
(a) An insane villain is not a good film villain, because a good film villain needs to scare the audience, and the audience knows that a mentally ill villain is seriously disadvantaged.  The audience needs a film villain who is competent, intelligent, capable, and at the top of his/her game.  A mentally ill villain simply is not at the top of their game, no matter how brilliant they are, and an audience knows it.  Mental illness is a handicap; a film villain needs to be viewed by the audience as a predator, a successful predator; she/he can be human, they need not be superman/woman, but they need a high skill set, and they need to impress the audience.  Mental illness, no matter how scary in a film, also generates pity.  You want your audience to fear the film villain, not pity him/her.  A mentally ill villain is at some level, not in control of their actions - when a writer writes their villain as mentally ill, presenting him that way to the audience, the audience knows that person is not in total control of their behaviors, they are sick, and their illness is not their fault. The villain needs to be totally in control of themselves, totally responsible for their behavior - they do what they want to do and don't care about the cost to anyone else.  A sick film villain is not competent to assess the cost.
(b) High end mercenary - it's totally unbelievable that a high end mercenary would get so upset that Alex Cross could begin to anticipate his behavior, and almost catch him (at the building where his German target worked), that he would seek to avenge himself on Alex Cross, his team and their families.  I know no high end mercenaries, but think, you are a gun for hire, one of the best in the world, how do you get that way.  How is it you can charge what you want, and rich people can find you, though you're not listed in the phone book.  You must be intelligent, highly skilled at killing people, including knowing all kinds of machines to help you do that job (guns, just to name the obvious), and have lots of other technical knowledge about a wide range of subjects.  If you are a high end mercenary, it's doubtful that you are spiteful and stupid when it comes to your work.  You would probably be highly focused, and may not even enjoy killing, but simply be good at it and have no moral aversion to it.  You would not be a successful high end merc by going after police officers and their families.  Anyone physically attacking police officers and their families in retaliation against officers performing their jobs, are in effect, attacking the state, and attacking the state means you have declared war on the state - you have become a terrorist and the full force of national and international policing officials would be brought to bear against you.  So, it is obvious, that no high end merc would do this, certainly not in the context this film sets up.  If the Mathew Fox character as a high end merc found that his moves were being anticipated by the local law, what he would have done is completed his mission as soon as he possibly could, and then left.  He certainly would not have targeted the officers or their families, what professional needs that heat.  If, by some stretch, the merc became fascinated with the Alex Cross character, he might have followed Alex's future cases from afar.  At the most, he/she would have used the close call with Alex as a learning tool, as a professional is always striving to get better.  In the real world there are high end mercs, yet you never hear about them taking out police officers and their families.  High end mercs, high end assassins, wouldn't do this type of work (attack local police), they're on a whole other level; this movie merc is just poor storytelling.  If the writer needed the merc to fixate on Alex Cross, the merc could have had a loved one that got in the way and who Alex and his team took out.  That would have better explained the merc's interest in Alex, but no merc would believably take a loved one on a job, so the writer would have to show how Alex and his team's investigation lead them to someone the merc cared about, that may have worked.  But a professional assassin at the top of her/his game, and on a paying job, would not attack the investigating officers and their families, story just not believable as presented.
(5) Police officers as law breakers - the writer spent more time showing how Alex Cross became a criminal (breaking into the evidence room and assaulting the officer on duty, conspiring with the criminal who allowed his niece to take the fall for him, to break the law by giving him the weapons used in the criminal's murder of others, framing the villain who hired the merc in the first place, who Alex Cross blamed for ultimately killing his wife, assaulting the chemist who created the date rape drugs), than he did showing why Alex Cross was superb at his job; the writer told the audience Alex Cross was good, but he didn't show us Alex's process, how he reached his conclusions.  We were told Alex Cross is clever (Ed Burns character told his girlfriend that Alex could tell you what you ate for breakfast), but the audience didn't get to experience it for ourselves; we were told it, we weren't shown it.
I think writers should be careful about having heros in a story breaking the law with no negative repercussions for them, especially characters charged with upholding the law.  Unfortunately we know that our legal institutions are, like us, not perfect, and again unfortunately, our institutions reflect the racism and sexism of our society in many ways.  Also unfortunately times are about to get tougher for many Americans, especially the poorer of us, as petroleum prices are expected to begin rising significantly in the next 5, 10 years (see post carbon institute.com), and petroleum is used in the manufacture of nearly everything we eat and the items we use.  Prices will rise and the poor will become even more stressed, and some with undiagnosed mental illnesses, trapped by increasing prices, and unable to leave emotionally untenable, but paying jobs, may snap - we may see more people snap - and we don't need to see film stories with law officers matter of factly breaking the law, because they want to, and getting what they want with no repercussions; it may help a sick audience member, already angry and frustrated with their life, make an officer a target.  I am not saying don't show police corruption in film, I am saying writers should consider the world in which they are writing - if they want to show officers breaking the law, show that, but show them paying for the error of their ways, like an ordinary citizen would.  Don't let them be the hero, which in our culture has usually been the morally correct character, and the criminal getting away with crime too; if they are the hero, and they successfully break the law in your film, consider what you are suggesting to the audience.  Stories are not just stories; they help the culture know who we are; what laws and rules we share.  Over the next 10 or 20 years, this country, and the world, will be moving into a very different future than the one experienced in the recent past, because oil in the ground, but harder to access, will cost more.  Short term the world and the majority of us will have our income contract, and it will be painful.  I believe governments already know this.  Police officers, not perfect, but necessary enforcers of the law.  It is helpful to have at least the illusion of law for us ordinary folk.  I think writers should know and understand that even more challenging times are coming; be careful who you criminalize, and think very carefully about who they are in the story and in the real world, and how their behavior may be perceived by the audience.  In this story, Alex Cross began the film as a police officer who would not even shoot a fleeing suspect, and who visited a convicted felon in prison; he ended the story as a criminal himself, unconvicted and unpunished by the story's authorities, but clearly shown to be a criminal to the audience.  Is the writer saying that Alex Cross' behavior is okay because he is a police officer, and that police officers are above the law?  Alex Cross is the story hero, there is no other hero, so it makes sense for the audience to conclude that is what the writer is saying.  In an increasingly difficult world more people will be stressed, and I don't think it wise to show police officers as heros above the law; they can be heros, but within the law.  Telling a story this way may protect an officer from a person who has gone off the rails, and with increased stress on the world, more people may become ill who might have otherwise been able to cope in better times.  I am not the story police, just my opinion.

There was no real emotion evident anywhere in this movie.  When he got his revenge in the end, it seemed as if it didn't matter to him.  There was no smug justification, no look of triumph, nor was there a show of pain for stepping across that line between moral and immoral.  Some might say that it was because he was acting ""numb""  but his words were not that of a man frozen in a state of numbness.  He was exacting his revenge on the man responsible for the death of his wife and unborn child, and if you weren't watching his face, or listening to the tone of his voice, you might just believe that was what he was doing.  Also, the storyline was hard to believe.  When Cross first arrives on the murder scene, he and his partner talk about the torture of victim, and what the killer was thinking.  Cross' accurate profiling of the killer made it seem like this was not his first kill, that they had seen and studied  him before, but this WAS the first time they had come across this man, so how was Cross so accurate?

I watched a lot of ganster movies before and now trying to stay away from violent movies I found violent scenes realistic.  The best thing for religious persons (like me) to do is look at the movie's story first...similar to the message in a song...before casting it aside as violent and unwatchable.  For example, The Passion of the Christ was violent, but the story was good.  Any who, Alex and his partner's chemistry started slow but the first crime scene made me believe that they really were friends.

The Alex Cross of this movie is completely different from what we get in the books, his actions are totally out of character and on top of that they have changed basic facts needlessly. Therefore, if you follow the books, I am pretty sure you will be annoyed and disappointed like I was. Those for whom this is their first experience with Alex will probably be OK, but even in that case, the movie is nothing special.

Alex is living in Detroit and happily married with Maria. When a killer named Picasso kills her, Alex goes on a rampage to get revenge and stop his plans. I am pretty sure I do not have to spell out some of the differences with the story in the books. The deviations are many, but that is not even the worst part. The way in which Alex reacts to the events and how he goes about finding the killer fits more with Dirty Harry than with the detective we have come to love.

5651704,5,B00BMTYW20,"Thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  Tyler Perry's role was second to none.  He is one of the best actors today.  I can't wait to see what he does in his next movie, ""Temptation.""",1362614400,,174,4.375
5651705,4,B00BMTYW20,"As a fan of James Patterson's novels involving Alex Cross I was anxious to see how the new version held up. Both pervious films starring Morgan Freeman were good but his depiction of Cross was far from what the books involved, most noticeably his age. When I heard Tyler Perry was chosen for the role my only hope was that he wouldn't do it in drag. So does the new version hold up? Quite well actually.

The film opens with Cross and his partners chasing a criminal through the decaying area of Detroit. He is caught and another criminal is off the streets. Cross goes home to his family, a reprieve from the mean streets he patrols so well. There he learns that in addition to his two children and mother that live with him, his wife is expecting another child but insist he tell no one. Like that's gonna happen.

Cut to a paid assassin named Picasso (Matthew Fox) who is stalking his next target, a wealthy woman he seduces by fighting mercilessly in an illegal mixed martial arts ring. Going home with her, she takes him to her bed only to have him inject her with a paralyzing drug and then torturing her for information.

Cross is awakened in the early hours of the day and calls in his partner Thomas (Edward Burns). Since Thomas was with Monica, another officer, he lets him know getting involved with another police person will just result in one of them having to leave. The question is left in the air and they head towards the crime scene. Cross checks out the scene and deduces that the killer paralyzed the victim and then took out all three of her hired guards. Looking through the house, they discover a missing laptop but then find a back up hard drive the victim kept hidden.

Through various clues Cross puts together the identity of the next victim and he and his team head out to keep him from being murdered. While at this location they run into Picasso and prevent him from fulfilling his mission. The only problem is that in getting in his way he sets out to make sure it doesn't happen again first by torturing and killing Monica and then by killing Cross' wife.

More determined than ever to make sure his family is safe, Cross doubles his efforts to find this psycho who not only kills for a living but enjoys inflicting pain in others. As the clues and body counts begin to add up, Cross and his partner keep moving closer to that final confrontation with Picasso.

The suspense in this film is one that builds slowly like the best of criminal procedural films but a little bit disjointed at times. This doesn't distract from the story though and its one that not only develops the characters in the film but holds your interest from start to finish as the reason for catching the killer moves from professional to personal.

There isn't a bad performance in this film. Standing out is Perry as Cross. Having seen Perry in constant drag as Medea in his series of films it was interesting to discover that he's actually a good actor without hiding behind the petticoat. The slow burn he displays as his motives alter is well developed and by the end of the film you find yourself anxiously anticipating the next chapter in the stories of Alex Cross. Fox turns in a hair raising performance as the psycho killer Picasso making him not only a worthy adversary but a terrifying one as well.

Though no word is out yet if another film is in the works, fans can hope that this becomes a series of films rather than a stand alone production. Perry does indeed get the character right and would be able to carry the series into long term standing. Let's just hope that this film does well enough on DVD to insure that it happens. Should it do so fans of Patterson's Alex Cross will find something to look forward to other than the latest installment at the book store.",1362614400,,3789,4.481159420289855
5651706,2,B00BMTYW20,"Alex Cross is the third film to feature the title character and star of the best-selling mystery and thriller series of novels written by James Patterson.  In the first two films the character was portrayed by Morgan Freeman and this time around he is played by Tyler Perry in a reboot/prequel.  Cross is a forensic psychologist with the FBI although in this film he has not joined the FBI yet and is still a lieutenant with the Detroit Police Department.  Cross is offered a job with the FBI but his pregnant wife is reluctant to move to Washington D.C.

Fox and his team of Tommy (Burns) and Monica (Rachel Nichols) are investigating a murderer who is targeting several extremely wealthy targets.  They are able to thwart the attempt on the life of a German businessman and in retaliation the killer, who calls himself Picasso (Fox) turns his attention to Cross and his team.  The sadistic Picasso first murders Cross's wife and then tortures and kills Monica who was Tommy's lover.

Cross and Tommy now risk their careers, breaking into the Detroit Police evidence lockup in order to get the information they need to hunt down Picasso before he can take out his last wealthy victim, a billionaire named Giles Mercier (Jean Reno), and disappear.

Cross is one of those Sherlock Holmes type minds who can make deductions from the most scant pieces of evidence.  The problem is that Rob Cohen almost gives Cross a superhuman level of intuition.  With a fluffball script, Cross just seems to figure everything out without any effort to rationalize how he did so.  So you end up with a guy who is the smartest guy in the room going up against a sadistic nutcase in a bizarre series of silly cat and mouse contests.  Picasso is one jump ahead of Cross but drives around in a car equipped with Onstar that allows him to be tracked.

It's this sort of wild inconsistency that causes Alex Cross to shoot itself in the foot and it's stopped off with an utterly stupid twist ending.  I would hazard to guess that Picasso would not have a long career as a hitman being so easily upset that he loses sight of his main target to begin a vendetta with local law enforcement.  Perry is a talented writer and producer but less so of an actor, particularly for a dramatic thriller such as this.  He's far too wooden and his range of emotions is almost nonexistent.

Matthew Fox is little better as the psychotic hitman.  Fox's attempt to come off as a cold-blooded killer is trumped by his over-the-top nuttiness.  Subtlety is not the character's strong point!  And I'm not sure what's going on with him but he appears to have been on a hunger strike since Lost went off the air.  He looks positively anorexic and unhealthy.

John C. McGinley plays Cross's commanding officer Captain Brookwell and he's equally horrible.  As a native of the Detroit area I can tell you that a dimwit like this wouldn't last a week in the city.  Burns is always solid in supporting roles although he isn't given much to do here.  Cicely Tyson plays Cross's grandmother and she's also enjoyable.  It's nice to see Tyson back onscreen in recent years after she had mostly been absent from films for some 20 years.

There is little in Tyler's interpretation and performance that resemble the Alex Cross in the book. I talked to some folks about this movie.

So perhaps it was my inability to see beyond that.  Why why why didn't they get Denzel for this movie?!??! Nonetheless Tyler was definitely not the worst part of this movie and he certainly didn't do terrible, it was just ehhh for me.

Matthew Fox really did an incredible job in his role as Picasso the serial killer.  He was by far the best part of this movie.  I really, really enjoyed him and hope to see him in more movies in the future!!

And WOW for the small role she played, that little Yara Shahidi (Alex Cross's daughter Janelle) I have never ever seen such a little actress show such amazing emotion.  When she cried...I was so moved I got weepy.  That little girl is gonna make it big!!  Loved her!!!

And for the downright awful....John McGinley...Terrible....horrible!!  It was so unbelievably bad that I literally laughed at a few parts.  What were they thinking when they cast these people in these roles????  I really hope they step it up if they're going to make the entire book series into movies.  They have the potential to be a really great movie series, but not if they keep choosing actors that do not fit the roles.

The plot was great except the ending was a little thin but that could be due to mr perry's acting.

The movie had a lot of suspense to it and there was non stop action. The storyline is very intriguing especially if you are familiar with Morgan Freeman and his portrayal of Alex Cross. Alex Cross is a detective with the ability to read through the minds of the most disturbed personalitites.

The action scenes are believable with great special affects. Matthew Fox is superb as this mentally disturbed killer who will stop at nothing to reach his targets. He studies his targets amd learns their weakness, which makes him more difficult to capture. He finds delight in torturing his targets and making sure they experience every ounce of pain he has in store for them. Quite frankly I enjoyed his acting much better than Perry. The movie is not all that spectacular but the storyline is interesting enough.",1361577600,,946,4.733333333333333

Unfortunately, Tyler Perry wasn't the only thing wrong with this movie. It was pretty short, and it felt like they left a lot of character development on the cutting room floor. A lot of the interactions between characters fell flat, and much of the movie was pretty contrived. The final showdown was worthy of a b-grade 80s action movie.

I like that it has smart humor and not full of the dumbed down obvious humor

Alex Cross is a good movie to watch if you're just looking for the standard Hollywood experience.

As I was watching this movie, I realized that this is just another movie created for the purpose of pleasing as many people as possible. That's not a bad thing, in my opinion, but it's also not ground breaking. This movie follows in the footsteps of every other movie based on a popular selling action book. Everything's good in the beginning, then something bad happens and the main character seeks revenge.

Nothing really stood out in this movie as ""amazing or jaw dropping"", but I still enjoyed it. I definitely don't regret the rental fee (I should really get amazon prime...) but this isn't a movie I'm going to watch twice.

5651953,4,B00BMTYW20,"Watched this movie tonight and generally enjoyed the pace of the action and the suspense, and found that it held our attention throughout. The movie was very watchable and we recommend it.

However, having read most of Patterson's Alex Cross series books I agree with other reviewers that this movie feels like a patch-work of bits and pieces of his books put into a salad bowl and the pieces kinda ended wherever they were tossed. Much of the acting was believable and it was easy to get to feel like you knew the characters... but then the more likeable ones were taken from us.  The loss of two happened in such quick succession that it seemed to happen without real emotional effect or lingering passion... actually, once Picasso dispatched with one (named withheld to avoid spoiler...) there was no real mention of that character thereafter (no funeral, brotherhood celebration of his/her life, wake, etc...). Odd.

Matthew Fox played an insanely terrific bad guy -- he was ripped for the part and came across as 100% certifiable, scary and creepy. Serious transformation from other parts I have seen him play, and man did he pull it of with gusto. Wow.

Tyler Perry's dramatic acting was OK, though he kinda looked lost (as in lost in the script, not just lost due to the character losing his wife and colleague) from time-to-time and the makeup made his face look very odd on some camera angles... somewhat lurch-like.

Cicely Tyson, bless her past exceptional acting, just didn't do anything for me with Nana Mama other than come across as a stern bee-atch waiting to spit a little more venom in anyone's direction.

Don't know what the heck John McGinley was doing as the Chief; it was like he was stuck in his Scrubs character and was just doing a series of ""Here I Am"" cameos... like another reviewer noted, I just kept wishing that Fox (Picasso) would toast the Chief early on so we would not have to see him on screen again.

One thing that really bugged us all was the super crazy camera shaking during the climactic fight scene between Picasso and Cross... it gave half of us headaches, and the others all decided to take a bathroom break or grab another brew halfway through it. What was up with that technique??? It almost seemed like maybe Perry and Fox sucked at fighting and the director was trying to figure out a way to cover it up. Really bad technique.

Our bottom line: Tyler Perry has potential so do not give up on him in this role.  He (and his character) should move on to the FBI and gain some more experience, then try this again. This production was watchable and even enjoyable despite the challenges of trying too hard by using highly recognizable supporting cast who were just wrong for their parts.

Bring on the next one and consider different directing, and I'll bet that the next installment matures into a good production.",1361059200,,2862,4.671968190854871
5651954,3,B00BMTYW20,"I liked some of it the action parts, but if you read the books first it is a disappointment I think.

Alex Cross's wife dies in a different place in the movie then she did in the book. Also we never saw Damon or Rosy the cat, or John Sampson. Nana Mama was pretty good and so was Alex Cross but it doesn't follow the books or at least thats what I thought. The Butcher of Slago is pretty good in his part too but still left me thinking the books are a lot better. I Also don't remember Detroit being a place they lived at all but could be wrong. I remember them living in the same house always in Washington DC but could be wrong. If I read a book and see a movie I should see the movie first I guess. But some of the things that were off to me were from earlier Alex Cross books..",1361059200,,781,3.88125
5651955,4,B00BMTYW20,I like it but I would not watch it again. Very slow to start but in the end it does pick up and become a decent movie. Very good ending.,1361059200,,136,3.566666666666667

5651960,2,B00BMTYW20,"I must admit that I'm a little biased against this genre of movie.  I MUST be won over by originality, if there is excessive violence in a movie.  For instance, I basically deplored (was made very uncomfortable by) the violence in ""Wanted"", but found the story original, and therefore interesting, overshadowing the violence.  This movie was blah and uninteresting, which made the violence vulgar... as it was the only thing to focus on.

Tyler Perry didn't pull this off, he was more like a detective paper doll.  And I didn't buy love and romance with the woman cast as his wife, so there was no empathy or sympathy, they would be more believable as coworkers in the squad room.

It's really not fair for me to review this.  I didn't like the preview, watched a couple of weeks ago, but I was very bored today, and now I'm even more bored.",1360972800,,841,4.529801324503311
5651961,1,B00BMTYW20,This movie was so disappointing.  I lost interest in the 1st hour and did not care much for Tyler Perry playing Alex Cross.  The character in my opinion is more of a Denzel Washington.  I love the books but this was one of the worst.,1360972800,4,233,4.133333333333334

5651964,1,B00BMTYW20,"I think Patterson forgot who his character is...a smart doctor who is also a great detective.  Tyler Perry was believable as a dramatic actor and I think he could have played Alex Cross as we all know and love him.  Too bad to waste good actors on a template 'blast the smithereens outta the bad guys"".  Fox is outstanding as the demented villain.  I'm sad that Patterson has reduced Alex to this level.",1360886400,3,403,4.47945205479452
5651965,2,B00BMTYW20,"This movie is plain awful. Terrible acting. Terrible scripting and dialog. The director should simply be ashamed of himself for allowing this. Example: There's a moment where Alex Cross gets all dramatic in the Police station. He turns and faces the camera and tries to look serious, but it just doesn't work. It felt like I was watching a bad play. I like Tyler Perry but he should not have been cast in this role.",1360886400,,415,4.546666666666667
5651966,3,B00BMTYW20,"The movie isn't 'bad' as much as it tops out at 'made-for-TV' quality. The plot and dialog are predictable, the acting fair but unimpressive, the cinematography and direction pedestrian. I agree with other reviewers; Mathew Fox's psychopathic villain is the most engaging character. Unless you're a Tyler Perry fan and want to support him on principle, save your money and go read a book. (Try the James Patterson novels the film is loosely based on.)",1360886400,,451,5.026666666666666

Matthew Fox was pretty awesome though, At first, I didn't recognize him. Overall, the movie wasn;t horrible, just not worth more than a $1 rental. I actually was bored through much of it and finally faced forwarded through a lot of the last ""action"" scene, just to get to the end.",1360800000,,398,4.465753424657534

5651970,2,B00BMTYW20,"Matthew Fox is the show-stealer here.  He plays an excellent mad hitman.  Other than that, this movie was a flop.  The acting is subpar on Perry's part.  The kid is annoying.  The dialogue is sometimes really silly and melodramatic for no clear reason.  The movie has a few Tyler Perry family mushy moments that slow down the film and make it boring.  I honestly was waiting for Alex Cross to dress up as a fat old lady to trick Fox's character.  Yes, there were a few good action scenes wherein you wondered what was going to happen.  But I was wondering how the villain would succeed, not how Cross would win.  The good guys in this are just simply not interesting.  A movie about the villain would have been much better.  Rent it if you have money and time to waste.",1360800000,,769,4.375886524822695

Perry does a commendable job in his role but it is hard to imagine him in an action role after all the Madea roles.

I was wondering how Tyler Perry was going to pull off the role and playing it after Morgan Freeman but I thought he did a good job. Tyler played a younger Alex Cross and he pitted his detective and mental skills against a master killer who would not give up. In the end even Alex Cross wanted some revenge.

The film can be gruesome and macabre in some scenes but it plays into the role and personality of the killer. The action scenes and fight scenes are well done and enjoyable. Was the movie perfect, no but it was still entertaining and if a second film comes out as a sequel I will watch it also.

There are several good actors and actresses in the film and it is worth watching. It is a different movie without Morgan Freeman in it but after I got used to the new Alex Cross I liked it a lot!",1360627200,,917,4.060773480662983

There was a certain amount of intelligence in the various Morgan Freeman-Alex Cross movies, but no such thing exists here.

5652041,4,B00BMTYW20,"""Alex Cross""  is a predictable pop corn muncher of a cop/action drama with explosions, car chases, detective work and pathos.  What sets it above other films in the genre is two of the performances.  Yara Shahidi plays Cross' daughter. She stands out for the few minutes she has in this film and I hope she will be seen in more movies.  She outacts Tyler Perry in the shared scenes by a mile.  Matthew Fox plays a crazed psychopathic killer who looks like a cross between Michael Stipe and Lance Armstrong.  Razor thin and smoldering with over the top wackodaciousness he makes the film worth seeing.  Edward Burns was miscast as a cop in this film.  He seemed to be a likable doofus and not much like a police detective. Perry isn't bad just kind of average.  His performances needed some more energy. I thought it was too low key for the character.  He lacks the snap and inner fire of a Morgan Freeman.  The setting is Detroit.  This city in its decline could have been more strongly portrayed in the film. That might have given the film more punch.

There are some very large holes in the plot.  It is predictable and certainly not original.  However,  for a Saturday afternoon cheap film rental it is okay.  I would normally have given only three stars to this movie but Fox and Shahidi rated it one more star.",1360368000,,1315,4.504237288135593

I have read almost every ""Alex Cross"" novel by James Patterson and love this character. I felt Morgan Freeman was perfect as Alex Cross in two previous movies, but of course he could not have played the Dr. Alex Cross, in this action packed film. Still a good 2 hours spent.

It seems like its Perry's first movie and you can see him over exaggerating every emotional scene. The action sequences were a joke. Seriously would Perry really hold his own in a fight with Fox. Not for a second, Perry looks so out of shape and the acting is just horrible. I've personally never seen other movies by Perry and after this never will, but Fox gave a chilling performance.

Only watch this is you are truly bored and have too much money laying about.",1360195200,11,321,4.03125
5652059,5,B00BMTYW20,"I have to say I enjoyed this movie when I thought I'd hate it...but the whole time I watched it I could not stop missing Morgan Freeman as Alex Cross.  If you are a big fan of the Alex Cross books or the two previous Alex Cross movies then you might never be able to enjoy anyone else in the role besides Morgan Freeman.  I personally think it was absolutely stupid to recast this part and ever make an Alex Cross movie without Freeman in the role.  To me, it's like making an Indiana Jones movie with someone other than Harrison Ford in the part.  I know that Alex Cross is not as big a pop culture figure as Indy, but I really love the character and to me Freeman just was perfect.

That said, you also have to let go of the fact that Cross lives in DC in the books and previous movies but now he's randomly been moved to Detroit.  That was really jarring to me, especially since most of this movie was filmed in Cleveland so it wasn't even really Detroit.  That's the kind of thing that really bothers me about movies like this...when I know they have changed the character for no reason.

Aside from the above, though, I thought this movie was interesting until the last 15 minutes or so.  I still gave it a 5-star rating because the movie was good enough to make me forget that Tyler Perry was starring in it.  I don't like Perry and in fact find him obnoxious most of the time...but I didn't even once think of Madea or those other Tyler Perry movies while watching Alex Cross.  So he did a good job as an actor in this.  I also like Ed Burns in his part...though I did miss Alex Cross's best friend ""John"" and their relationship from the books and earlier movies.

I think the actress who played NanaMamma was great...and I liked her better than the actress who previously played this character. I wish there was more of her in the movie because she and the kids are big parts of the books.  What makes an Alex Cross book fun is his home life characters and NanaMamma telling him what's right.  The movies have never really done a good job at showcasing this, which is a shame.

Whenever I watch a movie on Amazon Instant Video I try to remember back to the days when I used to rent movies from a corner video store.  Back then, it would be about $3.99 to rent a DVD but I'd always end up returning them late so for me it would be like $6 or $7 in the end to see a movie.  It would be very rare for me to watch a movie more than once when I rented it...and more often than not I'd feel like I wasted my money in renting the movie in the first place.  I'd feel that way especially if it was cold or raining and I had to walk the DVDs back to that store...all because I rented the stupid movies to begin with.

I have to say that I would have been glad I rented Alex Cross even if it did cost me late fees back in the day.  I am glad I rented it on Amazon for the $3.99 I spent and I actually would watch this again in a few years when it's one of the $1.99 or $.99 rentals on here.

I still miss Morgan Freeman, but I enjoyed Tyler Perry in this role more than I ever thought I could like him in anything.",1360195200,10,3111,4.065573770491803
5652060,3,B00BMTYW20,"You will not be bored or lose interest in this movie, and Tyler Perry's dramatic acting was very good.  However, this Alex Cross isn't exactly the one James Patterson created.

The dialogue failed in many places and the Chief of Police was so corny I was hoping someone would take him out. Some of the characters were cliche'(the Frenchman's hat), but I liked the movie in spite of the sophomoric directing and script.

Tyler Perry will definitely make it as a dramatic actor.",1360195200,30,476,4.710843373493976
5652061,4,B00BMTYW20,"As mentioned by some reviewers here, beats me why this movie was panned by some critics. Just because Tyler Perry is mostly known for cross-dressing in his comedies doesn't mean he can't act and act very well in someone's film. It's almost as if these critics have stuck him in a box and refuse to take him out or want to see him in a different light from his Madea character AND will punish him when he does step out of the box. He can do comedy and clearly he can do drama. He was great in 'Alex Cross'! I watched it at the theater the weekend it was released. Whatever problems the script may have had and the lack of depth in some characters had nothing to do with Tyler. Morgan Freeman is Morgan Freeman! No one can be like him in the role of 'Alex Cross' and no one should superimpose Morgan on Tyler and find him wanting because of it. Yes Tyler had big shoes to fill and thus far has performed admirably. Give him a chance, stop comparing him to Freeman at every turn and compare him to the character. The movie itself was very good, Matthew Fox turned himself into this incredibly scary antagonist. If I didn't already know who he was playing in the movie, I would NEVER have recognized him. He truly morphed into this fiend onscreen.

I look forward to seeing Tyler blossom in future roles as Mr. Cross. Don't listen to the naysayers Mr. Perry. Keep honing your dramatic chops and your fans, me included, will keep paying to see you at the box office.",1360195200,,1461,4.3321167883211675
5652062,3,B00BMTYW20,"It was refreshing to see an African American hero in a cop and killer action drama.  I did not like how they made our hero do incredibly foolish things and making the bad guy seem so much more dangerous than the hero that him winning seemed ridiculous.  If I would to compare this to Die Hard (another cop killer film) I would say that Die Hard was better because Bruce Willis played a character who did not panic under pressure, used common sense and crazy moves to combat a madman etc and strangely it seemed more believable. Alex Cross panicked, he played by the books etc. (spoilers) and basically just barely got the bad guy by accident and with help.  When the bad guy had a sniper rifle on Alex and his wife and called to tell him about it and insulted his tie, clearly the response should have been about the tie and not him running for his wife only to see her get killed.  I thought for sure Alex was going to say something like ""really, I love this tie.  You don't think it goes well with my jacket?  I would have really have liked to see some wit and see Alex save his wife some how.  I think the character of Alex Cross was too blah.",1360195200,,1146,4.205479452054795
5652063,5,B00BMTYW20,"Unfortunately, due to below average critical reviews and competition in the theaters when ""Alex Cross"" came out, I waited until it became available for home viewing to get the blu ray disc.  After seeing it in my living room, I realize I should have caught it on the big screen.

While I liked ""Kiss the Girls"" and ""Along Came a Spider"", two other James Patterson-penned works that became Hollywood movies, Tyler Perry's version of the character Alex Cross in this new movie is much more realistic, or at least closer to what James Patterson was envisioning, than Morgan Freeman's version in the two earlier movies.  I'm not saying Morgan Freeman wasn't good in the roles; Freeman is a legend and excellent actor.  I'm just saying that Tyler Perry is closer to the age and physical condition of the character Patterson portrayed.

Although the setting for this movie was Detroit rather than Washington D.C., ""Alex Cross"" had more of a feel of James Patterson's novels than the previous movies had.  In fact, ""Kiss the Girls"" and ""Along Came a Spider"" felt more like ""Silence of the Lambs"" in their mood and setting.

Several of the critics had bashed the villain in ""Alex Cross"", played by Matthew Fox, for being too over-the-top or extreme.  I disagree.  Fox's character, based upon Picasso from Patterson's novel, was on the money.  In fact, in Patterson's books, the villains are in fact VERY over-the-top.  James Patterson, when discussing his novels, admits he doesn't write realism.  He writes excellent, fast-paced, exciting, action-packed stories that are fun to read.  And that is exactly what ""Alex Cross"" the movie felt like to me.

In addition to enjoying the script written for this movie, I thought the acting was superb.  Tyler Perry and Matthew Fox are well supported by several other well known actors, including Edward Burns as Cross' partner and Cicely Tyson as Nana Mama.

Bottom line: if you're a true James Patterson fan, you will of course notice differences between the books and the ""Alex Cross"" movie, but overall the differences don't make the movie bad.  Like Patterson said in a recent interview, his books and the Cross movies stand on their own.  Overall I thought ""Alex Cross"" did both Hollywood and James Patterson justice.  Check it out if you get the chance.  Five stars.",1360108800,,2306,4.909560723514212

Fox was very impressive. The cinematography and use of the city of Detroit and the metro area was fantastic as well. I couldn't stop watching. I'm really starting to believe that critics are bought off to like movies, and to pan them. There's no way this movie should have the terrible ratings that it has on other websites. It's a shame that many of the people that worked on this film will have their careers suffer because of it. It was a great movie. I'm disgusted, what more can I say?

5652066,3,B00BMTYW20,"Alex Cross(released Oct/12)stars Tyler Perry as Alex Cross,Edward Burns as Tommy Kane,Matthew Fox as Picasso,Jean Reno as Giles Mercier,Cicely Tyson as Nana Mama,Giancarlo Esposito as Daramus Holiday and many others. The protagonist here is played by Tyler Perry,whose character,the self titled Alex Cross,we last saw played previously by Morgan Freeman in two earlier movies.
As the film opens we are introduced to Cross who is a Detroit psychologist/policeman/and astounding profiler,all in one. He can look at just about anyone or thing and almost instantly assess what they have done,what caused an object to be where it is,etc.,and in great detail. His partner is Kane and they have a very tight working and personal relationship. Simultaneously we are intro'd to one Picasso,who pays to fight an extreme fighter. He thoroughly trounces the man and a wealthy lady in the front row ends up taking him home and seducing him. However when he ties her up with her own stockings,he also injects a drug which paralyzes her;she can only see what he does to her but cannot react or verbalize.
Cross and Kane investigate the grisly scene and determine that they definitely have a professionally sick man running loose. A sketch left behind by Picasso reveals initials which leads them to a German industrialist. Picasso's attempt at another murder is foiled by Kane and Cross. Picasso is now on the revenge path. In retaliation he beats up Kane's girlfriend then during dining at a restaurant he wastes Cross' pregnant wife. Kane and Cross meet up with the owner of the German business,Mercier. He is a multi million dollar businessman and it quickly becomes apparent HE is the actual target of Picasso's desires and implores Cross to help him.
Meanwhile Cross and Kane track down a local criminal called Holiday. They stole a gun out of the evidence room and present it to him,one to be used against him in am upcoming trial. Holiday will get the gun in exchange for him telling them where exactly the paralyzing drug comes from that Picasso uses to render his victims helpless. With that info they head off to see the drug dealer and they find video with a license plate number that belongs to Picasso. When Cross and Kane learn that Mercier is about to attend a conference they speed over but it is all in vain as a bazooka blast from a nearby rail train Picasso commandeered,takes care of Mercier and his men. Cross and Kane track Picasso down and smash their vehicle into his as he leaves a nearby parking lot to escape. The fight returns back inside the parking lot as Cross faces Picasso alone. The fight ends when Picasso falls to his death. Picasso is dead but Cross claims it's not over.
Cross has put two and two together and realized it was Mercier who set Picasso loose to begin with to fake his death,by killing his underlings and a look a like during the conference. Cross has pre sent bags of cocaine to his private villa in Cambodia. Cross tips the local police who arrive and arrest Mercier. The film ends as Kane drops off Cross at his house,who is moving to a job in Washington,to which Kane will follow.
The action here is swift(at times) but predictable throughout. The whole premise of a sick serial killer on the loose goes way back in movies and this one just doesn't stand out over and above the more mundane of that lot. The film is stoically directed by Rob Cohen and I thought it had the look and feel of a made for television movie. It is a been there done that movie. It was nice though to see black veterans Tyson(Cross's mom)and Esposito(Holiday)back in the spotlight again. I haven't seen either for some time.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp. Extras include a featurette and deleted scenes.
All in all a tepidly directed and executed piece of film. It is not a bad or poor film ,it's just not great or even above average. All the acting talent here cannot rise above the film itself.",1360108800,,3963,4.703597122302158
5652067,4,B00BMTYW20,"I must admit I wasn't sure what to expect from ALEX CROSS with Tyler Perry portraying James Patterson's titular hero.  After all, Oscar winning Morgan Freeman had played Cross in two previous films.  Perry isn't all that bad but he never really inhabits his character---it's more like ""Hey, watch me prove I can do more than Madea or produce horrible TV sitcoms---take me seriously!""
I respect his attempt to diversify his abilities, limited as they may be.  A stronger actor may have made ALEX CROSS a little better.
With that said, I liked this movie more than I expected to.  Matthew Fox is a appropriately vile antagonist and Edward Burns is an affable partner for Perry.  A big fan of Patterson's books, I found it easy to spot the clue regarding the bad guy who hired the assassin.  Director Rob Cohen keeps the pace brisk, although he overdoes it with some of the MTV-style jerky camera work especially in the climactic fight scenes.
I hear that due to the film's disappointing box office the studio deep-sixed any future Perry/Cross sequels.  Even so, fans of Patterson should enjoy this misfire.",1360108800,,1104,4.809523809523809

It is a very good movie if you have not read the books.  Tyler Perry as a police detective as opposed to roles he has played before will take some getting used to but he is actually very good in the role.  Matthew Fox is fantastic in the role of the psycho bad guy.  I was disappointed to find Alex Cross, sidekick, lifelong best friend to be a white guy who seemed to me as if he had been borrowed from Pattersons ""Michael Bennet"" series.  I like Michael Bennet but would have liked to find as in the Cross books a black ""John Sampson"" character in the role.  I also remember that the Cross series was set in Wash. DC, not in Detroit.  As a fan of the Patterson series I was disappointed with how far the screen play deviates from the books.  I found the ending disturbing in that I thought Alex Cross would never do that.  Not gonna say more so I don't give it away.

5652093,1,B00BMTYW20,"Tyler Perry as it turns out, is no Morgan Freeman.  But in his defense, Morgan Freeman couldn't have made this garbage heap of a ""film"" any better.  In fact Tyler Perry, in an unusual display of restraint on his part, is the best thing about this movie.  When Tyler Perry is the best part of your movie... you have problems.

Where to begin...  The script is an incoherent mess!  Alex Cross is a detective, a doctor, and a brilliant mind.  How do we know this?  We are told.  Repeatedly.  One character even goes out of his way several times to call him ""Detective Doctor Cross"".  But the only actual detective work we see him do, is to decipher how On-star works, and deduce that a drawing the bad guy left at a murder scene is in actuality a mad fold-in revealing his next target.  He is followed around by his best friend, whose only purpose in the film seems to be to constantly spout ""we've been best friends all our lives.""  He does NOTHING else in the movie.  Also in this movie is Alex Cross's wife, who we are told is pregnant, and whose sole purpose is to get killed, and provide motivation for our hero. ALSO starring is Rachael Nicols, playing the same character she did in Criminal Minds (and who was thankfully written out) who is apparently banging Cross's best friend.  This is, according to several characters, against the rules.  Why?  No one says, but then no one really seems to care anyhow.  She'll be dead twenty minutes in anyway so Cross's best friend also gets his motivation to... tell Cross they've been best friends all their lives.  The script constantly ""tells"" us everything.  Characters aren't developed, we are only ""told"" who they are supposed to be.  The story is completely incoherent, making one illogical leap after another.  At one point the ""heroes"" break into a jail, knock out and tie up a policeman, steal evidence, and give it to a man they know to be a murderer, ensuring he will get off scott free, just to get the name of the drug dealer to the man they are after.  And then there is Cross's nana, who could have been Madea if Perry had decided he wanted a second role, but instead went to an actress with even less talent.

This brings me to to the acting.  Tyler Perry actually tries to make his character believable, but he can do little with terrible dialogue, and brain dead decisions given to his character.  NO ONE ELSE is even trying.  His best friend says his lines, and checks out.  Rachel Nichols essentially plays the same character she did on Criminal Minds, and then dies.  The sarcastic doctor from scrubs plays....  the sarcastic doctor from scrubs in a police uniform.  And Jean Reno sits around looking embarrassed wondering where his career went.

It's a shame there isn't a zero star option, because that's what this movie deserves.  I guess I shouldn't be surprised, based on a novel by James Patterson, and directed by Rob ""Stealth xXx Mummy 3"" Cohen, it was bound to be terrible, but this feels like they really went out of there way to suck.  I was never a big fan of T. Perry's work, but after watching this movie I genuinely felt sorry for him.  No actor should have to result to this, even if it's just for a paycheck.",1357689600,53,3192,4.511343804537522
5652094,2,B00BMTYW20,"If you haven't seen any of the previous Alex Cross films, and you're not too demanding, this movie might just make it into the mediocre category. If you HAVE seen any of the prequels, you're in for a major letdown. First and foremost, Tyler Perry is no Morgan Freeman. I've not seen anything else by the dude, but his limited range in this film is glaring. The scriptwriting is straight out of the ""blaxploitation"" films of the sixties; predictable and formulaic. Whoever cast Perry as Alex Cross should find a new line of work.",1354838400,11,528,4.627659574468085
8571013,5,B00BMTYW20,"Initially, I was hesitant to watch this film because I always associated Tyler Perry with comedy (Madea character).
For the longest time I didn't watch this movie because I felt that no way could Tyler Perry (TP) carry on the role of Alex Cross after Morgan Freeman in Kiss the Girls and Along Came a Spider.  I was pleasantly surprised in TP's realistic and credible portrayal of Alex Cross, as described in James Patterson's bestselling novels.  In one of the special features in this DVD,  the author James Patterson stated that Tyler Perry's portrayal of Alex Cross fits the description in the novels much closer than how Morgan Freeman portrayed him.  This film deals with Alex Cross teaming up with his partner Tommy (Edward Burns) to try to stop a deranged killer (Matthew Fox) on a killing spree.  (You'll have to watch the movie; to point out plot details would ruin the surprises).  I was impressed with TP's acting, and I felt ""Alex Cross"" was a worthy addition to Kiss the Girls and Along Came a Spider.  One big plus of this DVD are the special features:  Audio commentary by director Rob Cohen, a good documentary ""The Psychologist and the Butcher:  Adapting and Filming Alex Cross"", and deleted scenes.

Director Rob Cohen did a great job of helming the direction of the film.  Cohen chose good actors:  Edward Burns as Alex Cross' partner,  Matthew Fox as the deranged killer, Carmen Ejogo as Alex's wife; Jean Reno as a billionnaire targeted by the killer.  I was especially impressed with the children actors as well.  This is a worthy addition to the Alex Cross action/ crime series.  I hope that Rob Cohen would make a sequel to this movie, and Tyler Perry will reprise the role of Alex Cross.  Highly recommended.",1531094400,,1734,4.745819397993311
