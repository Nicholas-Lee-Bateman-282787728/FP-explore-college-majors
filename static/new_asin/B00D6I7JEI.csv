5775595,5,B00D6I7JEI,"A great old movie.  I love Walter Brennan.
I also will be looking for the other B&W Movie: ""Swamp Water""",1382054400,,104,4.2
5775596,3,B00D6I7JEI,Jeffery Hunter is a favorite of mine. This was a surprise to me most of his movies have been war or western.,1381449600,,108,3.9545454545454546
5775597,5,B00D6I7JEI,"It is a short movie, but very good. The setting is great. The sound and picture are perfect as well. Being from Florida I have to say the Everglades are no where as friendly as shown in this movie.",1378080000,,197,4.076923076923077
5775598,5,B00D6I7JEI,"I have another version of this same movie, only with Wanda Hendrix as the one who stumbles on the wanted man and his son, Audie Murphy.  It was Sierra in one version and Lure of the Wilderness in the other.  Haven't seen the Jean Peters, Jeff Hunter version in 60 years but remembered it so well with quicksand and snakes instead of stampedes.  Great memories from the days when if a script worked good in one genre, use it in another.",1377388800,,435,4.345679012345679
5775599,5,B00D6I7JEI,"I saw this movie long time ago, precisely in springtime 1958. when I was 12 years of age and was more than pleased, so I puchased this DVD to renew my childhood memories. I am glad to say that after all these years this movie did not lose any of it's allure (no pun intended) for me. The story is compelling and plausible the cast is excellent, ms Peters is beautiful and late mr. Hunter is handsome and manly enough to be convincig in his role. Late mr. Brennan is, well, good as ever. Last but not least there is the best villain in history of american cinematografy unforgettable mr. Elam. I recommend this movie to all as nice afternoon entertainment. Tehnically, DVD is very good, picture and sound are very good an of course there is old glorious tehnicolor, the best color system that was ever invented.",1377129600,14,810,4.47972972972973
5775600,4,B00D6I7JEI,This was terrific. Loved the story and Jean Peters was more than a match for Jeffrey Hunter. Two very strong actors that complimented each other beautifully. Fun story and a good movie.  I really enjoyed this one.,1377043200,6,213,4.756756756756757
5775601,4,B00D6I7JEI,"Set in the Georgia swamps of the early 1900s, a young man (Jeffrey Hunter) gets lost in the swamps looking for his dog. He's captured by a long time fugitive (Walter Brennan) from the law and his young daughter (Jean Peters) who have been hiding in the swamps for years. Eventually, he feels a bond with the two and promises to find a good lawyer to reopen the fugitive's case. If the story sounds familiar, it's a remake of Jean Renoir's 1941 SWAMP WATER, this time in Technicolor but with Brennan playing the same role he played in the 1941 film. While enjoyable, it's simply not as good as the Renoir film although the screenplay and Jean Negulesco's direction follow the original quite closely. While Technicolor enhances the film's Okefenokee Swamp locations, most of the actors (Hunter in particular) give rather enervated performances though Constance Smith as Hunter's spiteful fiancee is good and Brennan, no surprise, is just fine. There's a decent score by Franz Waxman. With Tom Tully, Jack Elam and Will Wright.

The Fox MOD DVDr is an above average transfer. The clarity is very good and, for the most part, the colors are nicely rendered.

5775602,4,B00D6I7JEI,"Who knew the great Franz Waxman scored this remake of ""Swamp Water""?  A curiosity, with Jean Peters as a girl on the run with resentments and distrust, Walter Brennan as her father (!), and Jeffrey Hunter as the handsome lad who befriends them.  Constance Smith, who Fox top-billed but has little to do, seems to be an attempt to duplicate the allure of Maureen O'Hara, but she fails completely in a thankless part.  Jeffrey Hunter is a better actor than perhaps he is given credit for.  Not without interest, particularly if you are a 20th Century-Fox fan who grew up on ""Saturday Night at the Movies"" on NBC beginning in 1961.",1372550400,10,628,4.63063063063063
5775603,4,B00D6I7JEI,"This is an excellent color print from Fox Archives. It is a very unusual and exciting drama with a very good Jeffrey Hunter and Jean Peters, a favorite of mine. Taking place in the Florida Everglades in the early 1900's, the color photography is beautiful and does not contain any of the expected adventure normally associated with the Everglades. Very different and very good.",1370649600,18,377,4.90625
5775614,4,B00D6I7JEI,Jean Peters was one of my favorite beauties. I have seen all the variations of the same story and I like them all,1420416000,,113,3.9565217391304346

Excellent film with an excellent cast.  Hunter, Peters, Brennan, Elam, what else could you ask for.",1405987200,,262,4.51063829787234

5775621,5,B00D6I7JEI,"I have wanted this movie ever since the first time I saw it & it didn't come out in DVD at first so, I was so happy to finally see it. The way the town treats these people is evil. Walter Brennan is great in it as the man who was in trouble for a crime he did not commit. Thanks to Jeffrey Hunter for trying to help him.",1403913600,2,320,3.652173913043478
5775622,5,B00D6I7JEI,"Everything about this was likable.  The fear of the unknown, the hate and bigotry that can be ginned up in a mass of people, how important our Law of Justice is, that women too can be survivors....They can shoot, survive in non-civilization, they can think and strategize and are not just weak pretty airheads.
The background was really good too.",1394323200,3,346,4.766666666666667

8589994,3,B00D6I7JEI,"Jeffrey Hunter was just breaking in to his short lived stardom with this nice family type entertainment with a touch of mystery and excitement. Nice print from Fox Archive - which cannot be trusted generally. This is a 4:33 film and the Technicolor transfer is fine to buy. Good Weekend afternoon movie; simple, straightforward and old fashioned",1529625600,,345,5.0701754385964914

8590001,5,B00D6I7JEI,I enjoyed this movie from 1952. The war was over and those that fought it and worked in the war factories were busy building their lives and having families. Color movies and young actors were the new norm. The story line is simple enough. Look for a very young uncredited Warren Oates as Jack Elam's sidekick. The technicolor of this period is dazzling. This is a fun movie for a Saturday night at home.,1430611200,2,404,4.472972972972973
