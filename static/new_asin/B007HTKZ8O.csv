5087210,5,B007HTKZ8O,"Mandie and the Cherokee Treasure is a great movie for the whole family! I have a 10-year old girl and a 7-year-old boy, and they both like to regularly watch this movie and the first one--Mandie and the Secret Tunnel.

My kids really like the adventure and mystery in Mandie and the Cherokee Treasure. They love the riddles and the chase scenes. My daughter admires Mandie's independent and adventurous spirit, and my son thinks Joe is cool. They both laugh at the antics of Gaynelle Snow and Bayne Locke, particularly Locke's humorously exaggerated word pronunciations.
Personally, I enjoyed seeing the redemption of (no spoiler alert needed) one of the characters. This character experienced a heart change that was believable and powerful, and the redemption was rewarded with forgiveness. The themes in this movie provide some meaningful conversation starters with kids.

As a parent, it's great finding a movie with the plot and production quality that holds my kids' attention while communicating valuable themes with layers that multiple ages can grasp and connect with.

My kids and I are looking forward to the third movie in the Mandie series!

5087211,4,B007HTKZ8O,"I've been a Mandie fan for almost 25 years now, and understand how fans may feel about the Mandie books being made into movies. For those who want movies to closely follow books, this one doesn't follow the book _Mandie and the Cherokee Legend_. The two stories are very distinct. Because of that, I'll review the movie more as a tie-in to the previous movie title, rather than as a tie-in to the book series. Whether you have also read the books or are just watching the movies, however, I strongly recommend that you watch the first movie before watching this one, because it picks up where the other one left off.

In _Mandie and the Cherokee Treasure_, Mandie discovers that her uncle has a secret mission that he wants to complete, in a mine poisoned by sulphur dioxide gas. Could it be that he's looking for gold? He enlists the help of Uncle Ned, but tells Mandie and her mom to stay home. Of course, this is easier said than done, since the women are headstrong. Elizabeth wants to secretly follow John to stop him, but Mandie wants to go for other reasons. She recruits her friends Polly and Joe to go along, requesting that Joe bring along his science book so that they can figure out how to safely go inside the cave. While on the trip, Mandie attempts to play matchmaker, knowing that her mother and Uncle John used to love one another.

Meanwhile, the crooks from the prior movie are attempting to get back home . . . until they get wind of the treasure from someone who appears on a wanted poster. This puts them directly in the path of Mandie and her friends and family.

Will they find treasure? And what type of treasure will it be?

Directly following the conclusion of each movie, there has been unexpected news that now two beloved people affiliated with the Mandie series have passed away. This news has hit me hard at the end of each movie, and I feel other viewers may also be jarred in the same way by these sad announcements.  I wanted to warn sensitive viewers that a similar ""in memory"" message appears at the ending of this movie.

I preferred the first movie to this one, because it was more in the tradition of the books. The main reason, though, is that there's something obvious in this movie that's supposed to be a surprise, but saying what it is would give away a huge part of the plot. Also, although mentioned as being a big player in the movie, Hayley Mills appears in less than 10 minutes of it, but she does a wonderful job in the role. I hope she will be in future movies. Wouldn't it be fun if the Mandie series follows her to the girls' boarding school, where she is closer to her grandmother? Celia is mentioned as being in the next installment, so those of us who are fans of Mandie's various adventure locations can hope!",1291593600,15,2767,4.426326129666012

5087234,3,B007HTKZ8O,"First the pros-
This is a great little movie. The plot is interesting and the mystery enough to keep my two youngest children watching. The setting is as much a part of the story as the characters. There is some humor in the story as well. I would love to rate this movie higher because it is a great family movie. It does not rely on gimmicks or special effects or computer animation to make the movie.

But the cons-
The cons are what keep me from rating this higher. This movie has some really truly poor acting. The characters are stilted or they over act and because of that, much of the drama of the situation is lost. The two characters who care for each other don't seem to because of the stilted acting. When they are at their highest point of danger, there is no drama or adrenalin surges because of the over acting.

If I had younger children they would probably love it more than my  11 and 13 year old children did. I say this in part because younger children are capable of overlooking poor acting and often buy into over acting a little bit better than pre/teen children.

I probably wouldn't pay for this movie, but if i could watch it free I certainly would. Enjoy.",1419984000,,1182,4.334841628959276

5087261,1,B007HTKZ8O,"My wife picked this one up randomly thinking it would be a good family film to watch while we ate dinner, but from the start it was so boring that my wife started reading ""F Minus"" comics on her laptop, and I tried to riff on it but it was so horrible that not even Mystery Science Theater 3000 could have done anything with it to make it more enjoyable.

Apparently this is the second film in the serious.  Now, a *good* film sequel introduces the characters (at least the MAIN ones) in such a way that the audience need not be at all familiar with the rest of the series in order to take a liking to the characters and get interested in the story enough to care about who these people are, care about what they're doing, and maybe even think, ""I liked this film so much, I want go back and see the preceding film(s) I missed.""  ""Mandie and the Cherokee Treasure"" failed in this area.

We have not seen any other film in this series, and as such we were incredibly confused when important peripheral characters were introduced and we didn't know why we should care.  When the disguised thieves were exposed at the end, there was a big gasp from the other characters at the reveal, but we the viewers had no idea why it was such a scandal.

The plot was difficult to follow and the motivations behind characters' actions were so vague that we had trouble understanding ""why are they doing that?"" throughout most of the film.

The opening bit was really confusing:  A woman hurriedly opened a steaming hole in the ground that looked like it lead into an old-timy space capsule.  She threw a bunch of knickknacks into the hole, then carefully placed a wrapped bundle which looked like it could have been a baby in swaddling.  After she closed the hole back up, the scene changed with the caption, ""61 years later,"" and we were suddenly thrown into the scene of Mandie being reunited with her mother.

The two kept going back and forth with ""I thought you were dead,"" ""No, I thought you were dead,"" ""No I thought YOU were dead,"" and the mother looked a lot like the 61-years-ago woman -- in fact it looked like she was plastered with make-up to make her look older, but she just looked like a boxer had used her face as a punching bag -- and I was looking for some way to link the confusing, seemingly meaningless opening scene to the rest of the film, so I cynically thought that Mandie must have been the baby locked into the ground 61 years prior and that she looked awfully young for a 61-year-old woman.  I knew that wasn't supposed to be the case, but that opening scene really made no sense or had any relevance at all until the very end of the film when every detail missing from the plot gets explained.

The daftness of the characters was unbearable.  In one scene the kids thought it would be a good idea to hang OUT IN THE OPEN DAYLIGHT, wait for the bad guys to walk WITHIN INCHES below in order to snatch a bag from them, and then the bad guys NEVER saw this kid hanging JUST INCHES ABOVE EYE LEVEL.

And then it was grating how long it took the kids to figure out that the riddle saying that the entrance to the cave was ""beneath and behind the river"" meant ""the entrance is BEHIND THE WATERFALL.""  I understand that this is supposed to be an everybody-family-film, and maybe the film makers wanted the kids watching to have ""plenty of time"" to figure out the riddle, but I would prefer that my children actually get some mental challenges, not treated like brain-dead simpletons who can't spot the obvious.

Another point to knit pick is that everything looked too shiny and new; even people who were supposed to look dirty or at least like they'd been in the wilderness of the Western Frontier for a while looked like their entire wardrobe had just barely been cut from a fresh roll of fabric.

And why did the poison jet puffs in the cave sound like hydraulic door pistons?",1347235200,3,3888,4.398884239888424

5087266,5,B007HTKZ8O,"G-rated. No one on the cast/crew need be ashamed of film adaptation of the essence of the Mandie stories by Lois Gladys Leppard. Films never fully cover a book, but this second part of a series is a visual versions of the Mandie adventures. Now the films will be remembered by kids as much as the books. And older folk, like me, enjoy it too. Expect clean dialogue, no major violence, plenty of great scenic Mountain footage as well as southern mansion elegance. Mandie ends up saving the day, of course but I'll not spoil it and say more if you've not read the book. She's again looking for a missing item with friends Polly & Joe. Unfortunately so are others, both friends and foes. There are surprises galore for them, bad and good, adventure extraordinaire, edge of your seat danger. Even some Hayley Mills, but she's only partly dangerous. You really feel a part, up close and personal, in what is going on in this 19th century period tale. Mandie stories are a bit of historic fiction/drama of American late pioneer life.

SUBTITLES provided. And there's a ton of extra bonus stuff. It takes longer to go through all the bonus material than it takes to watch the feature length main attraction. But don't miss out on any of it.
Few Hollywood film makers could create this quality on the budget this group used. And it's Dove approved. That means quality Family Viewing.
This film was dedicated in memory to Shyne Kohout who played a wild crazy funny bad-girl blonde and who died shortly after this second Mandie film (she was in both 1 & 2) at a young 33 and with a promising acting career ahead.

Some scenes are extended acting, typical when targeting youth, but the story moves quickly, so hang on. Several of the cast reappeared in the first Mandie movie, ""Mandie and the Secret Tunnel"". Also, a must-see is the newest ""Mandie and the Forgotten Christmas."" Watch it even if it is not Christmas time.

I've not read the book, and the film may not be a perfect adaptation of the books, but it should encourage kids to dig into reading more Mandie stories. The 3 films are that good. Will there be more in the future? Hope so.",1321660800,2,2133,4.549479166666667

5087272,1,B007HTKZ8O,"I realize that as a person who read Mandie growing up I may be a bit prejudiced, but this movie is to me a prime example of somebody taking a good thing and ruining it.  The Mandie books are well written with interesting plots, especially the early books.  And this movie is based off of the second book in the series.  Unfortunately, it isn't clear to me whether the directors are doing a shoddy job of filming, or whether they are on something as artists often tend to be.  For the filming is all done in a very mocking and farcical manner.  None of the characters in the film are really given serious treatment.  Even the camera angles are done so as to highlight the farcical element that they seem to be so eagerly wanting to portray.  Most of the people who read Mandie when she was popular are grown up now, so to give it the treatment as though they are filming for preschool toddlers doesn't really seem to make sense.  But I guess maybe preschool toddlers are their target audience.  Which I find to be a sad thing.  As the Mandie books are deserving of first class treatment.  Not second and third string haphazard treatment.  All I can say is that I think Mrs. Lois Gladys Leppard (the author of the Mandie books) must be rolling in her grave at this type of film portrayal of her Mandie mysteries.
