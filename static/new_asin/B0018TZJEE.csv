3421355,5,B0018TZJEE,"The musical where Fred did not dance with Ginger. Replaced by Joan Fontaine, a non-dancer (although Ruby Keeler had been suggested previously), the female lead might have seemed something of a weak link in a frothy piece offering a confection of music, dance and spectacular imagery.

Not a bit of it. Director George Stevens and his RKO team added Burns and Allen, used one of the Gershwin brothers' melodious scores, and together with Astaire created an entertainment that might justly be described as stupendous.

The plot is pure flummery, centering around Hollywood English types, class-prejudice and a debonair hero (played by Astaire) who walks off with the girl in the end. But this doesn't matter: the script (by P. G. Wodehouse and others) fairly crackles with one-liners, most of them delivered by Gracie Allen in one of her most spirited roles. To see her working with her long-term partner George Burns is to watch comic legends in performance, their facial expressions playing off one another as they relish the nuances of the script.

Astaire's dance-routines are as unbelievable as ever. One such routine, ostensibly taking place in an English fairground, involves a series of surreal images concentrating on different manifestations of the human form. We are transported into a world of pure imagination, where conventions of verisimilitude simply don't matter. Cinema possesses this transformative potential, which is why it has proved so powerful in determining our imaginations.

The score contains so many standards: ""Things are Looking Up,"" ""A Foggy Day,"" and ""Nice Work if You Can Get It."" To be honest, ""A Foggy Day"" is a bit limply staged, with Astaire mooning around a night landscape having little to do with London (as mentioned in the lyrics). But the atmosphere becomes much more animated with his wonderful harmonies in ""Nice Work,"" topped off with a dance-routine (completed in one take) that is pure choreographic Nirvana.

Even if viewers are not fans of old movies, I defy anyone not to be charmed, inspired, and ultimately emboldened by this film.",1473724800,,2083,5.150887573964497

3421359,4,B0018TZJEE,This is a good film - Gracie Allen and George Burns are a riot and I think this is my favorite of what I've seen them in.  Fred Astaire and Joan Fontaine don't really click but it works.  Overall there's enough humor and plot to keep it interesting despite a couple scenes feeling out of place and the unlikeliness of the main characters in a romance.  Worth watching if you enjoy the Burns & Allen humor and the old sit com style.,1468540800,,431,4.2317073170731705

Go Gracie go! Gracie's extended dance scene took a world of stamina for a 5 foot 103 pound woman.  Delightful!!",1462665600,,349,5.327272727272727
3421363,2,B0018TZJEE,"This disc is poisoned with copy protection that prevents it from being played on your PC. I had to rip the content I had paid for just to watch it. If you're one of the growing number of people who relies solely on their computer to watch media, I would not recommend purchasing the Archive Collection DVD of this movie.

The movie itself is of middling quality, really only of interest due to the people who happened to be involved. Burns and Allen have a few great lines, and it's a particular joy to see them dancing alongside Astaire. It's just a shame that you have to sit through stretches of tedium to get to these moments. Considering the Wodehouse novel this is based on is very amusing, it's surprising that the entertaining parts of the movie were not in the novel at all, but that's how it turned out.",1461196800,,813,4.42

3421371,5,B0018TZJEE,"Having seen a number of Fred Astaire's films, this is one of my favourites; I was entranced. The storyline evokes an impression of ""Downton Abbey"" meets the Marx Brothers, with Fred being the kingpin who links the action together, whether romantic or comedic. George Burns and Gracie Allen provide some genuine belly-laughs with their repartee, with Allen getting most of the best lines - ""My, my, how old-fashioned! Horse-whipping a man in this day and age when they could run over him with an automobile!"" - and the scenes where they dance with Fred are scintillating - all three of them just look to be having so much fun, it's impossible not to want to join in.

Joan Fontaine is at her demure best but shows some uncharacteristic feistiness - which sits well on her - in the scene where she gets annoyed at Fred, when he doesn't understand that she's in love with him.

There are some fine comedic interludes from the supporting cast but naturally it's the great man himself who takes command of the film, even when he's not on screen. It doesn't matter whether Fred's leading lady can dance or not because when he takes to the floor, all eyes are on him anyway. The guy had that rare gift of being able to combine romantic lead with comedy, and in the scene on the hall stairs, where Lady Alyce rejects him, he displays that trusting vulnerability (reminiscent of Stan Laurel), which makes him so endearing and has us rooting for him from start to finish.

The choreography to ""Stiff Upper Lip"", sometimes called ""The Funhouse Number"", won Hermes Pan the Academy Award for 1937 for Best Dance Direction.  The other dance routines, especially Fred's ""drum solo"" toward the end of the film, perfectly display the athleticism, innovation, musicality and style of the man - and Fred was never less than perfect. Doubtless there are Fred Astaire films in which the dances are more sophisticated and romantic - but perhaps none with the feel-good factor of this one. By the end, everyone's differences have been settled and they're all just one big happy family (almost). So grab your suitcase, pack your chuckle muscles and get yourself down to Tottleigh Castle. This is one country house party you'll want to revisit again and again.",1440720000,,2235,4.767441860465116

3421373,5,B0018TZJEE,I loved this movie.  It was fun to see Gracie dancing with Fred.  I am trying to collect all the movies that George and Gracie made.,1430352000,,132,4.038461538461538
3421374,4,B0018TZJEE,"Funny story by PG Wodehouse, the always brilliant Fred Astaire (not just for the dance numbers, but the lovable character too,) some great moments with nonchalant George Burns, too.

3421384,5,B0018TZJEE,I love this movie. I was looking for more of the George Burns and Gracie Allen Show and read about it so I bought it.

3421387,4,B0018TZJEE,"While some of this movie's humor would be considered corny by today's standards, much of the movie is funny and entertaining. It is clean entertainment from a golden age of Hollywood. The ""Things Are Looking Up"" song and dance is one of the top classic romantic dance scenes of all time. The dance scene at the fair is unequaled and gives a glimpse of how fairs used to be early in the 20th century.

3421389,5,B0018TZJEE,"My comment above was made by George Burns in his typical dry style; this film actually lost money for RKO as the audience was probably expecting Ginger.  As a old film fan I am starting to collect the old musicals made during the ""studio system"" and found this one to be thoroughly enjoyable.  Burns and Allen are excellent hoofers; many equate them simply with comedy but in vaudville Gracie and George were mostly booked as dancers.  Their number with Astaire at a ""British"" amusement park was worth the price of this DVD, replayed the segment three times before moving on.  As with most musicals the story line was so corny that it rose to a satire of old musical story lines, kind of campy.  It goes without saying that Mr. Astaire turned in a great performance that is the rule with him very classy.  Highly recommended.  The excellent service and quality of this new ""Prime"" DVD proves why Amazon is my favorite source for DVD's.",1391817600,,935,4.63030303030303

3421394,4,B0018TZJEE,"With P. G. Wodehouse as a main writer, this film is filled with clever lines and silly gags, and with the Gershwins as composers, it is also a delight to listen to the music -- every song is a hit. A joy to revisit time and again.",1382659200,,230,3.9148936170212765
3421395,5,B0018TZJEE,"Some critic reviews show this is one of Fred Astaire's least popular movies.  I am not a great Ginger Rogers fan, so I disagree with them.  While Joan Fontaine was not the best dancing partner pairing for Astaire, she works well opposite him considering her character.  In addition, Burns and Allen are excellently cast with him.  The story is simple and cute, but the point is a musical comedy.  Also, it is an Astaire film, so the dance sequences are phenomenal.  There are laugh out loud moments, usually from Burns and Allen, but all of the characters interact really well, so the whole movie is highly entertaining.",1381708800,,620,4.747663551401869
3421396,4,B0018TZJEE,"PG Wodehouse, Burns and Allen, Fred Astaire and a great George Gershwin score. . . ""who could ask for anything more""!!  Joan Fontaine is possibly Astaire's worst partner but they only have one number together.  Not as romantic as Astaire and Rogers, but still great fun.  Reginald Gardner and Harry R.

3421398,5,B0018TZJEE,"""A Damsel in Distress"" is a classic mistaken identity comedy starring Fred Astaire and Joan Fontaine. George Burns and Gracie Allen added their unforgettable style to the film as Fred's publicist and his secretary.

The movie is based on a P. G. Wodehouse story (and he also co-wrote the screenplay), so it's no wonder that it's so clever and funny.

If you haven't read details of the story elsewhere, I'm not going to spoil it for you here. To me it is much more interesting and amusing to discover for yourself. Just understand that the dialogue is smart and funny, as is the overall story. Gracie Allen is a hoot, and Fred Astaire is as good as ever.

Watch for the extended funhouse dance sequence It is entirely unique and will keep you chuckling throughout.

Highly recommended.",1380153600,,785,4.708029197080292
3421399,4,B0018TZJEE,"I always love Fred Astaire and I think George and Gracie are wonderful so this movie was fun for me to watch.  But I really dislike Joan Fontaine and she played the aristo Fred is in love with, which somewhat spoiled things for me.  The plot is absurd but that can be said for most of Fred's movies so that's not why it isn't a five-star in my book--I just think it doesn't ""zing"" without Ginger and Edward Everett Horton and the other stalwarts Fred starred with in ""Top Hat"" and ""The Gay Divorcee"", etc.  Still it is a Fred Astaire comedy and that's always a good thing.",1379808000,,572,4.277777777777778

After being amazed at how quickly it came (3 days), I began to marvel at the film once again. It's as great as I remember it, the songs are fantastic, the acting is superb, and the comedy is hilarious. I highly recommend this product, the only minor setback I had was it didn't play on my DVD player, which is a 'play only' device, (there is a disclaimer on the case saying ""This disc is expected to play back in DVD video 'play only' devices ...""), but it played on my computer's DVD drive.",1373673600,,633,4.072

Singing and dancing by Fred Astaire, comedy and tomfoolery by George Burns and Gracie Allen, script and general silliness by P.G. Wodehouse. One of the BEST dance sequences EVER with Fred and Gracie in a funhouse, choreographed by Hermes Pan which will take your breath away.
The only false note in this entire production was the truly horrible miscasting of Joan Fontaine as the female lead. Can she sing? No. Can she dance? No. Why is she in this movie? The studio decided she needed to do something....who knows?

Wodehouse the wonder humorist of cracking comedies, books and plays wrote this great story.  I felt like I was reading from his book.  It doesn't get better than Wodehouse.  Too bad so many people today haven't seen or read the escapades at Totleigh Towers.  Fred Astaire is better than his top form but Gracie Allen stole the show.  You did too George Burns.  The photography is magical as a movie like this should be what it was meant to be,  fantastical and full of romantic surroundings.  The wit was quick and smart and sometimes silly.  This great movie  'A Damsel in Distress'  is a  way of being in their funny world, in beautiful surroundings and forgetting our troubles.  Thanks P G Wodehouse!",1358121600,,811,4.428571428571429
3421409,4,B0018TZJEE,"This Warner Brothers 'Archive Collection' DVD is about as bare bones as it gets; cover art is present (as pictured), no insert, and the disc gives every sign of being 'manufactured-on-demand' (as advertised).

The menu screen has only one selection- 'play'; no scene selection, bonus material or subtitles.

The film itself looks great, if a little uneven- some scenes are very sharp and rich, and a few scenes are grainy and scratched.  This may be due to the source material, but in any case, it still looks far better than any previous edition I've seen.

The soundtrack is crystal clear; Ray Noble's band and Fred's (and Gracie's!) singing sounds incredible.
There are a few scenes where the audio seems a hair out of sync with the picture; but again, that may be due to the source material.

This is a charming film, and well worth the price to see Burns and Allen dance (twice!) with Fred Astaire, the debut of some Gershwin songs, and Fred's incredible drum/tap solo in the finale.  The picture looks better than I've ever seen it, and the audio is beautifully clear.  Thank you, Warner Brothers, for making this film available again!",1357516800,,1141,4.790816326530612

3421411,4,B0018TZJEE,"Like even the Fred and Ginger movies from the 1930's, A Damsel in Distress takes more than one viewing to truly fall in love with.  As Arlene Croce pointed out in her ""Fred and Ginger Dance Book,"" the plots of these movies are so silly and contrived that initially they are off-putting.  However, you come to eventually feel great affection for the stories after you see them enough times.  What is not second-rate or contrived, but instead pure magic, are the music and dance numbers.  Fred, George, and Gracie were consummate professionals who were given terrific numbers by the Gershwin brothers to showcase.  This is also one of the few films where you can appreciate the Gracie Allen persona, which captivated an entire generation of radio listeners.  Finally, while the young Joan Fontaine was certainly not a dancer, she had a presence and beauty in this film that simply glowed.  You can understand why they cast her.  In four short years, she would provide two immortal screen performances, as Mrs. De Winter in ""Rebecca"" and Lina Aysgarth in ""Suspicion.""  I agree with other commenters that this film was unjustly underrated because audiences reviewed to accept Fred Astair with anyone but Ginger Rogers.",1342915200,,1214,4.97029702970297
3421412,4,B0018TZJEE,"We'd been waiting for this classic movie-musical-comedy to come out on DVD, and we weren't disappointed when it finally did. Everything looks so much better in the spring cleaning of this Astaire, Burns and Allen, and Gershwin flick in which Hollywood goes to P.G. Wodehouse's house in jolly old England where not much makes much sense, but it hardly matters, since the whole thing is  more like a piece of music rather than a closely plotted novel. It's all pure entertainment that purely entertains. Wodehouse said his books were like old-fashoned musical comedy rather than modern tragedy, and his novel this movie is based on is certainly typical of the former, and the Gershwin brothers' great songs help to seal the deal. Astaire makes graceful dance look easy and inevitable through ""Foggy London Town,"" while Burns and Allen do some of their better routines and more. See the funhouse segment with Gracie in the middle like  a bobbing bobbin. It's all so simple that it somehow works.",1342569600,,992,4.934131736526946

3421414,5,B0018TZJEE,This is a rather silly film but charming and amusing.  Have you ever wanted to see George Burns dance?  Gracie Allen seems born to it.  This is a different type of Fred Astaire film made in 1937 during his series with Ginger Rogers but it's the same Fred Astaire - poetry in motion.  The music is by George and Ira Gershwin and I'm almost as fond of Fred's singing as his dancing.  There is plenty here to relish if you just go with it.  The great advantage of DVD is instant replay and my remote got quite a workout.  The fun fair number was amazing.,1336348800,,551,4.190476190476191

Joan Fontaine is no Ginger Rogers or Cyd Charisse, but her beauty and brightness add to the fun.  It's easy for us to forget that Burns and Allen were a very successful Vaudeville song and dance comedy team and this film amply demonstrates what fine dancers and how funny they were.  The cast is bolstered considerably by Reginald Gardiner and Constance Collier who give a British authenticity to an American film.  Alfred Hitchcock would use Joan Fontaine three years later in ""Rebecca"" and Contance Collier eleven years later in ""Rope.""

By the time this film was released in 1937, George Gershwin would be dead at 39.",1319155200,,796,4.91044776119403

I knew Gracie Allen was a GREAT comedienne, George Burns was the first to point that out, by giving her all the punch lines, because she was just better than anybody, including him! But I had never heard of DAMSEL IN DISTRESS. Everyone knows that Astaire was the greatest screen dancer ever, but Gracie blew me away in that Funhouse number, which is quite extended. Who knew Gracie could dance like that? Okay, a bit of Ginger would have spiced up the movie, but I found it a delight from beginning to end. Great laughs, great dancing, great music and lyrics. What more could I ask for? Why the missing DVD, of course! PLEASE!!! I keep checking Amazon, yet still I wait. I am getting old! DAMSEL IN DISTRESS on DVD please!!!",1303344000,,790,4.417808219178082

Since I now have a DVD-R, I've been recording movies on at odd times that I don't see available elsewhere. And I was astounded not only at this movie's charm, but the fact that it had a unique flavor from any other movie I've ever seen, and I am a movie addict.  There is something magical about the chemistry between such disparate talents as Fred Astaire, Joan Fontaine, George Burns and Gracie Allen. The best way I can describe it is that they create a ""joy bubble"" and a quirky alternate reality that made me smile the whole way through. With the wonderful music and dancing, the setting, and the best of ""character actors"" playing supporting roles, I felt truly blessed to see it, especially now when I am home with the flu and so needed a lift.

3421419,5,B0018TZJEE,"Based on a story by P.J. Wodehouse, the plot is wafer thin, and yet there's a lot to relish in A DAMSEL IN DISTRESS. This screwball musical comedy didn't fare too well in the box office in 1937, and I think this was Fred Astaire's first cinematic flop. That it tanked was largely because the audience back then was used to seeing Astaire paired up with Ginger Rogers, and folks got in a snit when it turned out that not only was the leading lady not Ginger Rogers, neither did she have Ginger's hoofing skills. Me, I didn't mind at all. Joan Fontaine, then 19 years old, was a fresh face, very beautiful, and she demonstrated an endearing naivete, despite that she was perhaps a bit too passive in her role. But, no, she couldn't dance. And she was still a few years away from REBECCA and her Best Actress Oscar nomination and then her Oscar win for SUSPICION.

Unlike Ginger's more street savvy roles, Joan Fontaine's demure and proper character doesn't really get plenty of chances to crack wise. Instead the husband-and-wife comedy team of George Burns & Gracie Allen were signed on to provide the laughs, and we learn that they're not too shabby at the dancing, either. Taking place in England and its fog and that sprawling manor, the decor tends to veer away from the swanky, glittery art deco style we've gotten so used to in past Astaire-Rogers flicks. Just another change of pace for Fred Astaire.

What remains the same is that Fred plays yet another dapper musical entertainer. Jerry Halliday's cross to bear is that his publicity agent  (Burns) has pumped him up as this serial heartbreaker, a plot conceit which proves to be an obstacle in the story's romance. The plot revolves around a silly misunderstanding. Jerry, while visiting in England, comes to think that he's the American that the lovely Lady Alyce Marshmorton is in love with (but he's not). Also believing that Lady Alyce is unwillingly confined at her estate, Jerry sets out on a rescue mission.

A DAMSEL IN DISTRESS has so many things going for it, again it's a bit odd that it didn't do better during its theatrical run. Fred Astaire is as great as ever, his good-humored brand of classy and his graceful dancing feet and, yes, his singing, all as delightful as ever. He was still very much at the peak of his talents, although, honestly, the man's peak lasted for decades. We get to see Fred (but probably his stunt double) perform the legendary ""Leonard's Leap."" We see him get caught in a chorus line of old Brit fogies and belt out a tune ""with a Hey and a Nonny!"" And we see him have fun with his buddies Burns and Allen.

But my favorite Astaire routine in this film takes place on the busy London streets as Fred tap dances away from an unhappy policeman even as vehicles zip by and honk at him. George and Ira Gershwin provide the music and lyrics and introduce two more terrific standards: ""Nice Work If You Can Get It"" and ""A Foggy Day,"" which I love. 'Things Are Looking Up' and 'Can't Be Bothered Now' are okay, but no classics. ""Things Are Looking Up"" is the number in which Fred has to work around Joan's lack of hoofing skills. But it's okay. Joan Fontaine is still real pretty, even with two left feet.

The funhouse number ""Stiff Upper Lip"" won Hermes Pan, Fred's chief dance collaborator, his Academy Award for choreography, although I wasn't that into it. To me, the most interesting thing about it is that, at one point, Fred and Gracie re-enact the trademark run-around exit that Fred and his sister Adele often used when they performed on stage years ago.

Lest people forget - and how many of the younger folks remember George Burns today? - George was the straight man in the Burns & Allen act. George would set up Gracie, and Gracie would deliver with some screwball remark. But I don't know if folks nowadays will think her stuff funny - some of her daffy zingers are pretty dated, perfect for vaudeville way back when, but not really tailored for today's sensibilities. Still, she and her guy George add great energy to the film, and if you dig their vaudeville humor, then you'll smile plenty. Montagu Love is also very good as the understanding Lord Marshmorton (whom Astaire mistakes for a gardener). And the servants' antics - and their marriage betting pool on Lady Alyce - really enliven the film.

A DAMSEL IN DISTRESS isn't out on DVD yet. What's up with that?",1266537600,,4376,4.594110115236876

If you have ever stood in front of this type of mirror and wondered what to do, this will show show you.

And Gracie turns to George (playing a press agent) and says ""George, some Hawaiian is on the the phone."" ""Some Hawaiian?"" asks George. ""Yes. He says he's Brown from the Morning Sun.""",1261612800,,737,4.533834586466165

So? Does every Fred Astaire movie have to have Ginger Rogers in it to be good? (Answer: No) Is Joan Fontaine relatively weak and poorly cast? (Answer: Yes) So what do we have?

We have Fred Astaire, being as brilliant as he always was. We have Burns & Allen at perhaps their best. We have on film Gracie dancing, which is a rare treat in and of itself. We have Ray Noble, a bandleader/actor/songwriter, who doesn't turn up all that often in films. And let us not forget one of the best things: a brilliant score by George & Ira Gershwin. And face it, folks: they didn't write all that many movie scores. How can we dismiss a movie that introduced to the world such masterpieces of The Great American Songbook as ""A Foggy Day,"" ""Nice Work If You Can Get It,"" ""I've Got Beginner's Luck,"" etc.? (1937 was the the year the Academy made one of its most notorious and shameful blunders by giving the Oscar for Best Song to ""Sweet Leilani,"" a thoroughly forgettable ditty sung by Bing Crosby in HAWAIIAN WEDDING...and it wasn't even written for the movie! Gershwin never in his lifetime received even a nomination for the brilliant and timeless classics he wrote for his few films.)

So...the big question: Why is this movie not available on DVD in the USA? We get a French import that's in the wrong format. This is as much a slap in the face as that Oscar for ""Sweet Leilani""! Come on, whoever has the rights to the RKO library this week: get on the ball and let us have this film. And don't skimp on the extras, either!

I own a barely viewable copy taped off Public TV in the nineties.  One piece of trivia mentioned was that Joan Fontaine was paired with Astaire because he and Ginger's latest movie had 'fallen off a bit' at the box office.

3421425,3,B0018TZJEE,"""Damsel In Distress,"" (1937) another Fred Astaire romantic musical comedy for RKO Radio Pictures, as the studio was then known, was, despite some great help - and most of the usual suspects behind the camera -- the great dancer's first box office flop.  It is, therefore, not in print, I believe, and hard to find: I settled for a used videotape, and, if you really want it, you might have to, too.  So let's look at the pros and cons. Firstly, and most importantly, neither sound nor picture is what we've been happy to become accustomed to.

However, the talent is there.  Astaire himself, of course, playing Jerry Halliday, professional American dancer visiting London.  The late great vaudevillians/comics, George Burns (playing George) and Gracie Allen (playing Gracie), his staff people.  But someone important is notably missing: Ginger Rogers.  She is replaced by Joan Fontaine, then just beginning her career, as the romantic lead, Lady Alyce Marshmorton.  There are sturdy British supporting players Reginald Gardiner as Kegs, butler with a hand in many pies; Montagu Love  as Alyce's father, Lord Marshmorton, mistaken for a gardener by Astaire's character; Constance Collier, then a very big name in the British worlds of theater, society, and sapphism, as Lady Carolina Marshmorton, Alyce's Aunt.  The talented George Stevens directed.  The nine-song score is by George and Ira Gershwin, completed before production began on the picture.  Confusingly enough, some sources say this was their last completed film score; others say ""Shall We Dance"" was.  Go figure.  Pandro S. Berman produced, as usual; Hermes Pan was in on the choreography, as usual.  Story and screenplay, as silly as anything Astaire ever made, were by outstanding British humorist/novelist P.G. Wodehouse: Lady Alyce is of an age to marry, but can't make up her mind, until she shares a cab with Halliday, and falls for him. Van Nest Polglase was not on hand to supply his usual gorgeous art deco sets, but it's doubtful that that's what caused the movie to flop.

Most people lay the blame for that at poor Joan Fontaine's door.  She was just beginning work; she was supposed to be the second lead, and help carry the picture, but she couldn't.  She was then rather colorless for starters, and she couldn't dance.  She was given only one brief dance with Astaire, and the haste with which she sits down in the nearest chair, as soon as that's over, is still telling after all these years.  Supposedly, as Fontaine, sister of Olivia De Havilland, sat at the movie's premiere, watching herself try to dance, a woman behind her loudly said ""Isn't she awful.""  The actress always said she thought this movie set her career back four years.  She would eventually succeed, of course: she was nominated for an Oscar for the well-known 1940 film ""Rebecca,"" in which, you'll recall, she, in character, couldn't ride or sail, either.  She lost Oscar that year, oddly enough, to Ginger Rogers, who'd gone on to better things, in ""Kitty Foyle: Natural History of a Woman."" But she won the Oscar in 1941 for Alfred Hitchcock's ""Suspicion.""  She always said she considered Astaire a notable exception among her male co-stars, in that he cared more about the film than himself.

Well, Astaire cared about the movie, and the studio did too: that's why they brought Burns and Allen in after production began.  These seasoned performers actually could both sing and dance pretty well, in addition to being funny.  They do a nice job together on ""Stiff Upper Lip."" The pair, and Astaire,(both men in spats), dancing to an instrurmental number, do an infectious, enjoyable funhouse romp that most people consider the picture's highlight.  Finally, I've always loved Astaire's versions of ""A Foggy Day in London Town,"" and ""Nice Work If You Can Get It,"" so I just plain wanted the picture.  You might, too.",1202515200,,3868,4.9720062208398135
3421426,5,B0018TZJEE,"There are several things of importance about this film. Most importantly.......it's George Gershwin's LAST COMPLETE score. He did write 1 more song for 38's GOLDWYN FOLLIES but never completed it (Ira Gershwin and Vernon Duke did.....OUR LOVE IS HERE TO STAY) but A DAMSEL IN DISTRESS is choc a bloc with gags and songs and great comic performances. Fred Astaire really seems so much more at ease here than with his former dance partner Ginger Rogers. The storyline is bright and breezy and filled with great character actors Constance Collier,Ray Noble(yes, the British band leader),Reginald Gardner and Harry Watson. The charming if wan Joan Fontaine but most importantly George Burns and Gracie Allen at the top of their game....GB:(criticizing Gracie for her forgetfulness) ""Gracie, sometimes I think that their's nothing up here"" (indicating his brain)to which Gracie replies: ""Ah George , you're self conscious!""

The Gershwin songs are some of his best...A FOGGY DAY, NICE WORK IF YOU CAN GET IT,I CAN'T BE BOTHERED NOW and STIFF UPPER LIP

Burns and Allen and Fred Astaire have two dynamite dance numbers as a trio......most impressively is the ""fun house"" sequence which contains bits from his Broadway days with sister Adele...take note of the ""Swiss Miss"" section in the fun house! It's the closest thing to actually seeing Fred and Adele Astaire actually dance on film. Point of interest: Adele had retired from the stage and had refused to team up with Fred in films because she met and married British nobility and retired to live in Britain before the start of WWII.

Hermes Pan is credited with the dance direction but you can see Fred Astaire's mark all over the film. This also may have been one of the last films to feature any actual British countryside footage before the blitz!

A charming film, wacky story and hilarious performances and Oh those Gershwin songs! Ok so it didn't have Ginger but it is a great cup of English Musical Comedy tea and crumpets!

A downright peculiar picture which works better than might be expected. Certainly Joan Fontaine was no musical performer, but the inventive, Oscar-winning choreography by Hermes Pan is stunning: the Fun House sequence is particularly memorable. The film fizzled upon its initial release in 1937. Apparently audiences felt that Fred without Ginger was like corned beef without cabbage: edible, but only if you're very, very hungry.

Without Ginger Rogers to stimulate and challenge him, he's forced to dance up a storm -- in and out of traffic, through the woods (twice), and inside a drum kit -- all in a vain attempt to pump some life into this fairy tale.

Finally, and most fatally, there's a kid playing Young Albert who gives the most annoying performance in the entire history of musical film... he turns Wodehouse into the Ritz Brothers.

This is a clever film which takes advantage of Astaire's underrated comedic talents.  The Gershwin score is timeless.  ""A Foggy Day"" is a ""must see"" Astaire performance.

We'll  just leave out that outdoor dance he did with Joan Fontaine, though the  song was a beaut.
