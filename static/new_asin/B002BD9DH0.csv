8360993,5,B002BD9DH0,"Dusty covered so much ground from 1964 to 1969.  20 hit songs are performed by Dusty.  Some of them are Live and some are lip syncs (which was standard back in the day, but she acts them out so well and is so playful in them, you'll still be entertained).  The Live performances of ""Son of a Preacher Man,"" ""You Don't Have To Say You Love Me,"" ""The Look Of Love,"" ""Dancing In The Street"" are brilliant and Dusty at her very best.  Dusty's two backup singers sing her praise.  Both very dear friends who clearly respected and adored her (Both as a tremendously gifted singer and also as a human being).  Madeline Bell (a successful singer in her own right) gives entertaining insight into Dusty's special vocal technique and her personality and character.  Simon Bell and Burt Bacharach shed light on what made Dusty such a unique and incredible vocalist.  We also hear directly from Dusty herself in a few brief interview segments.  A great DVD for any Dusty fan.",1468368000,,963,4.584795321637427
8360994,4,B002BD9DH0,"Will this DVD play on any player? I notice the format is PAL. I thought most North American players were NTSC. I do see it's all regions, but the PAL designation has thrown me.",1256256000,,176,4.205882352941177
8360995,5,B002BD9DH0,"This is an absolute must to own DVD for all Dusty fans out there, the next most essential Dusty DVD after the classic ""Live at the BBC"". Apart from memorable contributions from the ever reliable Madeline Bell etc, snippets of a newly discovered American interview from 1978 (why in black and white...and not the whole thing ?), short never before seen bursts of live video footage of Dusty at the airport, etc, we get some of the best and perfectly restored performance clips available commercially.

Highlights for me include a flawlessly performed (non-double tracked) live rendition of ""All Cried Out"" from Ed Sullivan Show (1965), ""I Close My Eyes And Count To Ten"" from Jones the Voice (1968), ""Son Of A Preacher Man"" from Ed Sullivan Show (1968), ""Brand New Me"" from David Frost Show (1969) and full performances from the 1965 and 1966 NME Poll Concerts, bits of which may be familiar to many of us but never before seen in their glorious entirety. Watch Dusty close with ""Shake"" on the 1966 concert - hip, soulful...great stuff. ""A House Is Not A Home"" (1970) accompanied by Burt Bacharach on piano and beautifully sung is now considered - even by the self critical Dusty herself - as a perfectly delivered live performance she could be proud of.

Disappointments, there are a few but only in terms of regrettable omissions. Why didn't they license her powerful and energetic live take of ""Stay Awhile/I Only Want To Be With You"" from the Ed Sullivan Show (1964) instead of using the mimed Russ Conway and Australian Bandstand clips ? Or include the full 10 minute clip from Pop Spot (1964) which includes Dusty miming and dancing to ""Can I Get A Witness"" instead of using only ""My Colouring Book"" ?

Reeling In The Years Productions has a history of releasing quality DVD products - check out the Temptations and Marvin Gaye in the soul series if you're Motown fans. ""Once Upon A Time"" is no different in the British Invasion vein. Dusty would have been pleased...and that's saying alot.",1254787200,5,1995,4.7601156069364166
