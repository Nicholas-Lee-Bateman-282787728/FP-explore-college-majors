8076353,3,B000A8MNA2,"A unique short film from Bengal.

Stories of ladies and girls at brothel.
Of course, several problems happen including a murder.

An impressive episode to me is about a girl and her mother.
The girl wants to go to school because she believes she can be educated to take her mother away from the brothel.
Her mother, though, stops the girl going to school, and feels happy as a married rich old man is taking them to . a cage  where the mother believes they can be happier.

They try to be happy, and still there are problems

8076354,3,B000A8MNA2,"I would say that the most value this movie has for people outside of India is that it gives a glimpse of the seedier part of Indian culture.  It is a story as old as there have been civilizations.  Lati, the young girl, is central to the story, but there are several sub-stories.  One is of an old couple that a driver is trying to find a hospital for them, but can't find one.  Another is about a wandering cat, but neither my wife or I could figure out what that was for; maybe is is symbolic of something in Indian culture.  At times, there was moralizing that reminded me of some very early American movies.  The move is a bit rough cut compared to the better Hollywood movies, but it is worth watching if only to broaden one's cultural experience.",1223942400,2,752,4.297872340425532
8076355,5,B000A8MNA2,"A rather sad film that is contemplative in many ways but it reflects the impossible dream of the West that underdeveloped countries should never develop. Here is India in 1969 when the first man walked on the moon. We know what has happened since then. The unfettered development of India in an unexpected field based on the desire to learn and work of the untouchables. They could only learn vocational trades and they did, computer science and we know what they are doing with it. The first ever computing workshop in the world serving the whole world and controlling the whole world with its computing dexterity. No, definitely no , third world countries do not want to keep their traditional way of living that rhymes with prostitution in this film, no hospitals, except for cows in this film, no studying for girls except the bawdy songs of a whore-house, of a brothel. We can in the West always dream, that will not happen. They want change, development, knowledge, know how, a future in one word and not a present tied up to a past. The best part about it is that in the west we have exactly the same dream and exactly the same people tell us that dream is not possible, we have to limit our ambitions. We have to say with Barack Obama, we want the American dream for everyone, and not the American nightmare or any perverted version of this dream of a world governance of the peoples, from the peoples and by the peoples. This film is an admirable vision of this irrepressible urgency of now as Martin Luther King would have said, and God only knows how irrepressible this emergency is now. So let's seize the day and run to the train to Calcutta  and start a new life at the passage gate between the silk road from Tibet and the world.
