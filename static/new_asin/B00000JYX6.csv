1239226,5,B00000JYX6,"Spectacular!  The video is fantastic. The undersea cinematography is great, high caliber work all around. The soundtrack is appropriate to video, relaxing ""new age"", done in Dolby Digital. Screen saver  and Wallpaper for your PC.  It will rank high in my collection of Reef and  Ocean videos. I recomend it for a gift to a special friend.  This work  truely deserves recognition and support.  In fact I'm going to look for  more work by David Hannan.",949104000,20,450,4.828947368421052
1239227,5,B00000JYX6,"I always thought it would be nice to dive the Barrier Reef, but had other locations higher on the list.  After seeing this DVD (and buying a copy for a gift, too!) it has moved WAY up on my list!  I have shown it to  non-divers as well as divers and all are awed.  Spectacular clarify,  beautiful new age original music.  Makes me want to get my gear and go!",944438400,14,358,4.042857142857143
1239228,5,B00000JYX6,"This is a spectacular DVD! If you are looking for some ""eye-candy"" to impress your friends with your new DVD player, then look no further. The video on this DVD is fantastic, crystal-clear  closing in on HDTV clarity. The undersea camera work is great, high caliber  work all around. The soundtrack is appropriate to video, relaxing and  ""new age"", done in Dolby Digital. Also, there is a screen saver  for your PC on the disk.
There is an education feature of sorts too, if  you turn on subtitles, they show up to name the underwater  creature(s).
Excellent job all around. Great to view, great to relax too,  great to learn from. Can't go wrong with this disk. BTW, I'm just a happy  consumer, not associated with the maker/manufacturer.",941673600,50,739,4.71875
1239229,5,B00000JYX6,It takes you to a different world. I listenend to it so many times that the tapes squeaks and need a new one. It also lead me to start to snorkel and changed my way of looking at the sea.,928800000,2,187,3.7
1239230,5,B00000JYX6,We bought this film in VHS back in 2001 when we were in  Australia and it washed away with our beach house in Hurricane Katrina.  So please to have found it again and in DVD format to fit the times!!!!  Great condition and fast delivery!  Thanks!,1378080000,,246,4.282608695652174
1239231,3,B00000JYX6,"I saw this dvd in the waiting room of my doctor's office and wanted it for my home
Although I have an HD Panasonic tv the picture is not nearly as clear and colorful as I had expected
I had read reviews saying the same thing but I thought because I had such a good tv this would not happen to me
very disappointing",1369094400,,314,3.921875
1239232,5,B00000JYX6,"This is a great video with good, clear picture quality. It is very relaxing to watch, definitely suitable for all ages. My 2 year old loves this video! I also like that you can watch it just by itself with the soothing background musice, or with under titles. The under titles explain what is currently being shown and offer some description for those who would like to learn something. Overall, we love this DVD and are looking for more of the same series! A great deal for the price, too!",1363564800,,490,4.455555555555556
1239233,5,B00000JYX6,More than I expected. The photography was incredible. This CD is worth seeing over and over again.  Very good investment.,1360454400,,121,5.05
1239234,5,B00000JYX6,Received in time and was just as described. Would use this lister again. The packaging was excellent . My mother in law loved it.,1357862400,,129,4.416666666666667

1239236,5,B00000JYX6,"We made the mistake of buying ""Coral Sea Dreaming"" new because i could not find Coral Sea Dreaming to give as a gift.  We have it and it is 20 times better than Coral Sea dreaming which is a total bore.  The photography on it was not up close.  We give Coral Sea Dreaming a 10 (1to10 being best)

1239237,5,B00000JYX6,"I had put this one on the back burner for a long time mistakenly assuming it would be mediocre. Wow, was I wrong!

I'm an underwater photographer and dabble in videography too . I'm VERY picky and will often be the only one with criticisms. The quality of the videography in these videos is simply supreme. Better than IMAX. Superb lighting and shot selection resulting in fantastic color and variety. Considering that the footage was shot prior to 1999... even more stunning. My only criticism is not about the video.. but the audio track. The background music is nice but I wish I could turn off the narrative without turning off the music. There are some inaccuracies which isn't unusual in a documentary but what is annoying are the silly arguments for why we should be responsible and respective of the reefs - much like in IMAX and other nature documentaries. It's absurd to say that one of the main reasons to preserve the reefs is the potential for new medicines. How well did that work with the Brazilian rain forests? Simply put, without the reefs, the ocean ecosystem will die off and humans are dependent on the ocean ecosystem for endless reasons. If, as predicted, all food fish are gone by 2048, this will be part of the trigger that will cause our civilization's food supply system to collapse. This seems SLIGHTLY more compelling than warning people that they may lose potential exotic medicines in the future.

So I will put some nice background music on and will watch this video, one of the best underwater videos ever, over and over. Bravo to the divers and their underwater videography. A+",1327708800,,1611,4.729537366548043
1239238,4,B00000JYX6,"This is a wonderful video showing life on a coral reef.  The images are stunning yet not overwhelming.  Some of the scenes tend to be short while others can be a bit long, but well edited.  The soundtrack is nice but can be distracting at times.  My true issue with this video is the incorrect naming of animals.  Granted, this could be due to colloquial naming but calling a nudibranch a flatworm is incorrect--it's a mollusk.  Overall I would recommend this video because it shows the wonderful biodiversity of coral reefs.  A great addition to a video library.",1299024000,,563,4.683673469387755
1239239,5,B00000JYX6,THIS IS A VERY BEAUTIFUL VIDEO AND GREAT PHOTOGRAGHY DONE UNDER WATER ON THE GREAT BARRIER REEF I REALLY ENJOYED IT.,1290816000,,116,4.571428571428571
1239240,5,B00000JYX6,"We saw this DVD when we took a Cruise to Mexico a couple of years ago, and it was the most peaceful and relaxing DVD we'd ever seen.  The underwater scenery is absolutely awesome!  The music that accompanies this is easy listening type and allows it to fit into whatever you're doing without competing for attention.  When you want to watch something mindless and just enjoy God's beautiful creations without noise, this is the DVD for you.",1288051200,,440,4.688311688311688
1239241,5,B00000JYX6,This is one of the best videos I've seen for underwater sealife.  The colors and scenery are absolutely gorgeous and breathtaking.  It's a great video to pop in when guests are visiting - it's a great topic of conversation.  The Great Barrier Reef is truly a world everyone needs to experience.  I want to find other videos just like it.,1252627200,,337,4.566666666666666
1239242,5,B00000JYX6,"I realize this won't be what most people care about, but if you're looking for something to help a small child sleep, stop here. Buy this. You'll never find anything better. Beautiful pictures, calm and pleasant music, zero dialogue, zero violence, zero scariness. We've used it for years and love it.

If you're wanting this video for yourself, the other reviews will be more helpful. My personal endorsement is that I actually like it after watching it weekly for four years, and that's saying a lot :)",1245974400,,504,4.793103448275862
1239243,5,B00000JYX6,"Beautifully captured, peaceful footage of the undersea world that I can watch over and over.",1223251200,,92,5.2
1239244,4,B00000JYX6,"The Coral Sea Dreaming DVD shows a variety of marine life in clear format and upclose. The format is more like a relaxation DVD and less like a documentary. For this reason, I'm reluctant to give it a 5-star review. Why do I still give it 4 stars? The answer is simple -  picture quality is amazing. Even though it is filmed in nature, the sharpness, clarity, lack of fuzziness and timing is stunning, just like your saltwater aquarium, except the marine life is upclose and captured on DVD at the right moment (feeding, releasing larvae etc). You can also treat it as a screensaver or run it in the background when you have guests over. I'd expect it to gain the attention of a 2-4 year old, although a 7 or 8 year old might find it boring as it doesn't explain what the marine life is doing (unless you happen to be a marine biologist and can explain it to your kids while it is running).",1217462400,,890,4.2976190476190474
1239245,5,B00000JYX6,"I've owned this for a few years now. I absolutely love this disc. The photography is stunning, and the music not only is also good, but perfectly matches the video. It one of my favorite chilling videos. I cannot recommend this disc enough. If you like underwater photography, especially of coral reefs, BUY THIS DISC.",1191715200,,318,4.8
1239246,5,B00000JYX6,"My son is in college in Maine for Marine Science. I saw this Cd in the eye doctors office. Every time I went it was on. It was so amazing. All the different fish and corcal. The color of the coral and how the fish hide was amazing. The fish I have never heard of most of them. I bought the Cd for my son for Christmas. He was amazed! We watched the CD so many time, and always found something new.",1170201600,2,397,3.8536585365853657

1239249,5,B00000JYX6,"First of all there's no words in this DVD.  But you can turn on your subtitles if you like and it will tell you each description.  It is really beautiful and fun, child friendly, the fish do eat-but there's nothing bloody or gross.  There are a couple of sharks but they are just swimming by.  It is relaxing but hard to take your eyes off the screen to get relaxed.  And some of the music isn't exactly ""getting to sleep"" music.  But the dolphins that ""surf on the waves"" are so much fun to watch, as well as the sea lions.  You can tell some of the sea life really adore the camera and show off for it.  A neat way to show off a new TV too!  Also has uses for your computer such as screen savers and 30 high resolution pictures.",1142985600,3,730,4.048951048951049
1239250,3,B00000JYX6,"This video is great for ""Eye Candy"".  It has some of the most stunning underwater videography that I have seen, however, this should not be classified as a movie.  There is nothing but Video and Background Music.  There is no story, no narration, anything at all the resembles the title of ""Movie"".  It would be great as a TV Aquarium or the such.  Overall I would rate as Picture Quality (Outstanding) Movie format (Stinks)",1120521600,3,424,4.675675675675675
1239251,5,B00000JYX6,"This DVD is for people who want unbelievable nature footage with serene music and without narration of any kind.  The footage is of top video quality and includes littoral birds and underwater footage of fish and coral.  The music is very calming.

This can be played in the background or for regular viewing.  My one year old will watch off and on and likes the music.  It is relaxing, beautiful and educational at the same time.

I highly recommend.  I wish there were more DVDs like this.",1110844800,9,491,4.574712643678161
1239252,4,B00000JYX6,"Beautifully filmed by Australian cinematographer, David Hannan.  The undersea footage filmed is of the Great Barrier Reef.  Amazing exotic fish and stunning coral reef footage.  Loved the optional feature to include subtitles of each creature's common names.  Nice conclusion with the night dive, too.  Unicorn fish...who knew?!

A couple of additional vignettes also quick and nice if you want to flip around the menu: Dolphins surfing, sea lions, etc. Light music in the background.

Also, you can set continuous loop or straight play.  Useful if this is being used as background.",1103760000,8,582,5.318681318681318
1239253,5,B00000JYX6,"Coral Sea Dreaming shows a variety of ocean life and habitats, both under and around the water.  Compared to relaxation DVD's, this has the highest quality picture that I've seen.  The picture on a widescreen rear projection TV needed no adjustments.  Although the picture is very sharp and clear in many places, there is some variability in the picture quality.  Some scenes were fairly fuzzy.  It's filmed in full screen mode.  I'd like to find this type of movie in widescreen filmed with high definition cameras.  It probably sounds pretty goofy, but I enjoy watching fish swim around!  I highly recommend Coral Sea Dreaming.",1070496000,9,629,4.980769230769231
1239254,5,B00000JYX6,"My family once owned the video to this movie. It was so relaxing, peaceful, and beautiful. The first time I saw it, I fell asleep (that's not a bad thing). This a great video for the whole family; babies will be mesmarized by the color (then quickly put to sleep because of the music), kids with be awed, teens will find it very facinating, and parents can take a well needed break. This video/DVD can take the stress out of anyone's day and turn a bad day upside down. This movie wasn't made to have a plot, it was created just to be beautiful. Everyone should own this; I highly recommend it.",1066262400,11,594,4.3125
1239255,5,B00000JYX6,"I have almost all available underwater DVDs. If you want one thats like meditation, ""Coral Sea Dreaming DVD"" is really one of the best. The quality of the film sequence is crystal-clear. It's indead as the title is.",1045094400,10,215,4.684210526315789
1239256,5,B00000JYX6,Exquisite.  No voices.  Just spectacular photography and music to match.,1029888000,,72,6.1
1239257,3,B00000JYX6,"Coral Sea Dreaming consists of the main feature, ""Coral Sea Dreaming"" (54 minutes), and six short features Wetlands"", ""Surfin' Dolphins"" (3 min), ""Ocean Moods"" (6 min), ""Undersea Breeze"" (4 mins), ""Sea Lions"" (7 min), and ""Save the Reef"" (1 min).
My personal favorite was the Surfin' Dolphins short feature which had nice shots of dolphins playing in the surf off an Australian beach set to lively music.
The cinematography in all the features is excellent and captions (when turned on) clear and easy to read.
But... What I was hoping for in the main feature was a more relaxing, less rushed, somewhat aquarium-like, view of underwater coral and fish of the reef -- what I got was more of a very well done streaming catalog of short clips of each fish or coral.
Rather than a more continuous flow of images, the main feature presented a view of one scene or fish species for 3 to 7 seconds before cutting to another fish or angle for another 3 to 7 seconds, over and over again.
This gave me the feeling that I was reviewing a substantial catalog of excellent views of coral and individual fish species rather than the more relaxing views that I had desired.
I was hoping for something that would bring back memorys of past snorkeling trips (Sea of Cortez) -- holding a view of a continuous and/or contiguous background longer or following a school of fish longer.  But, too many scene changes too fast...
So, partly based on my expectations (perhaps unwarranted), I have to give this DVD 3 stars. I would happily give any of the 3-7 second scenes 5 stars, but I found the constant cutting and fading of scene after scene in such rapid order disruptive -- enough so that I did not find the feature relaxing, nor particularly suited for repeated foreground or background viewing.
I'm guessing that this would be a wonderful video for anyone planning to go the the Great Barrier Reef who wants to view and study a large collection of short segments of different creatures of the reef.",975628800,181,1983,4.6657142857142855
1239258,5,B00000JYX6,"This film is the best of all 15 dvd's i have in nature series. It is really relaxing. No words only music. And the subtitles help you the name of the creatures. A ""must have"" item.",970617600,12,180,4.027777777777778
