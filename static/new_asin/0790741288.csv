111364,3,0790741288,Helen Hayes is a great actress but she is not Ms. Marple. The others are much better in the part. It's worthwhile to watch just as a comparison.,1370995200,,144,4.178571428571429

111366,5,0790741288,"I loved watching this movie ""Murder with Mirrors"" over and over....this tv movie of Agatha Christie was superb very enjoyable performances by great actors Helen Hayes, Bette Davis, Leo McKern, Frances De La Tour, John Mills, Dorothy Tutin, Liane Langand, James Coombes and John Laughlin.  I enjoyed Frances performance as the housekeeper Mrs. Bellaver. The chemistry between Miss Marple (Helen Hayes) and Inspector (Leo Mckern) was superb as a comedy team guessing the manor house murders.",1155859200,5,489,5.434210526315789
111367,5,0790741288,"Bette Davis and Helen Hayes, 2 of the greatest ladies of the American Cinema united for the first time in a movie. People may wonder why Helen Hayes who is older than Bette Davis seems to have more zip than Miss Davis. The reasn was that Miss Davis was ill during filming of the film.

No woman in all of England has a reputation quite like that of Miss Jane Marple. Scotland Yard knows her well - an infuriating meddler, but one who is insightful and infinitely useful when it comes to an investigation. An old friend asks Miss Marple to look in on his stepmother, Carrie Louise Serrocold, at her palatial estate on the outskirts of London. Someone may be poisoning the ageing lady of the manor and it appears everyone but her dutiful husband has a motive - so an engaging twist-filled case of country house intrigue unfolds.",1134691200,8,826,4.506666666666667
111368,5,0790741288,"I wanted to have a movie that had Helen Hayes in it because I always loved her as an actress, (I used to watch a lot of 40's movies). I love murder mysteries. This one was/is  a relic. She was absolutely delightful. I would recommend this VHS to anyone who loves Helen Hayes. However, I would have  liked  the movie better if they had left Bette Davis out. She was pathetic. Katherine Hepburn did a better job in her last movie before she died (and she was indeed very sick).",1125878400,3,475,4.2555555555555555
111369,3,0790741288,"This is an entertaining performance for the Agatha Christie fan, with a taleneted lead and supporting cast that includes Helen Hayes, Bette Davis, and Tim Roth.  I, however, recommend the BBC version of this film entitled They Do It With Mirrors, starring Joan Hickson as Miss Marple.  The story is more tightly woven, with what I found to be more interesting characterizations of some of the lead characters, particularly Miss Marple's old friend and main character Carrie Louise.  The drama and intensity of the plot holds me much closer in that version as well, as here Miss Marple seems portrayed as almost fragile and frightened of some of the events surrounding her.  Still, this is a definite addition to the collection of any die-hard Christie fan.",984096000,7,756,4.976190476190476

111386,2,0790741288,"What a stinker. Bette Davis looks like she rose from the grave to take this role. One side of her face was partially paralyzed from the stroke she suffered and she is as thin as a bird. She has few lines as a result and they are delivered in a wooden fashion. It must have been infectious on the set because the rest of the cast including John Mills is every bit as wooden except the delightful hambone Leo McKern, best known for Rumpole of the Old Bailey. Helen Hays, the Grand Lady of the American Stage who plays Miss Marple, shows how ordinary her talents were compared to the English actors in the cast.",1453507200,2,608,4.2956521739130435

111388,5,0790741288,"I really have mixed emotions about this particular presentation. I, as usual, was overjoyed with Helen Hayes' performance but the appearance of Bette Davis in her waning years was almost too much to deal with. In this presentation, Miss Davis was, as usual doing her best, but was obviously having great difficulty in everything she did due to her having to deal with her VERY advanced physical and mental problems of old age. It left me with a feeling of great sadness!

However, the story line and presentation as a whole was marvelous and the cast was truly outstanding. Another coup for Agatha Christie and Helen Hayes!",1446681600,2,623,4.822429906542056
111389,3,0790741288,it starts very slowly.  After the first half though everyone hits their stride.  This was Bette Davis after her stroke.  She gives a good performance in spite of that. Mills does a pretty good job.,1444176000,,197,4.571428571428571

111420,1,0790741288,"I love Agatha Christie and have seen most of the movies.  Somehow I had missed this until today.  It is dreadful, over acted all the way through.  Unbelievably badly delivered lines.  Cars driven into a gate then explode.  Some excellent actors in this, they must have needed the money.  This style of movie in my view is always done better by the British, Americans somehow don't seem able to recreate the mood these shows require.  Look at the Suchet, Poirot's and the recent Marples all leave this trailing sadly behind.  Do not buy it is really bad.",1428192000,4,553,4.628865979381444

111424,1,0790741288,"Awful - Helen Hayes evidently earned her reputation as a ham actress and although I guess Bette Davis wanted to continue working, she should have given it up - she wasn't Bette Davis anymore. Maybe it was the cheesy screenwriting, but there was no impression of intelligence in any of it. Although Agatha Christie's plots were elaborate and highly improbable, still, the television series, Hercule Poirot (David Suchet) and Miss Marple (Joan Hickson) were produced with style; unfortunately lacking here.",1409875200,2,504,5.3125

111426,3,0790741288,"Helen Hayes is a wonderful actress but she does not quite fit the bill when playing Miss Marple.  Miss Marple, in Margaret Rutherford's version, is a self-assured woman who speaks her mind and takes no nonsense.  Here, she appears to be a timid woman who is easily startled and intimidated by those around her.  The Miss Marple I know would not put up with the young woman who drives like a maniac, is spoilt and entirely self-absorbed - no, she would have told her off or at least voiced some criticism or displeasure.  Instead Helen Hays is apologetic, making excuses for her ""snooping"" and generally appearing as if she wanted to say to everyone ""Excuse me for living."" .  Miss Marple would never do that.  Not at all what I expected given the cast of actors.",1400976000,,762,4.5661764705882355

7791442,5,0790741288,"The present writer loves this little film, ""Murder with Mirrors"" (1985), aprs Dame Agatha Christie, since it is the only joint appearance of two of his favorite actresses, Helen Hayes and Bette Davis.  The young Tim Roth is also seen, early in his career, and Dick Lowry directed.  The fine score is by Sir Richard Rodney Bennett, who also scored the classic ""Murder on the Orient Express"" (1974).

In truth, Miss Hayes, in her final film, does seem too American (despite her early success in Victoria Regina), but her great warmth and charm conquer all.  Miss Davis, with her unconquerable spirit, seems so vulnerable that she wins our compassion--and our hearts.  In this film, we have two of our greatest personalities from the stage and from the cinema.",1503619200,,757,4.8828125
