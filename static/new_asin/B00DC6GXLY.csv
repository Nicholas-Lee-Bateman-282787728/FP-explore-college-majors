8591605,4,B00DC6GXLY,"I love this detective drama that ran on ABC from 1982-85, about a filthy rich Texan, Matlock Houston(Lee Horsley) who lived in a mansion in Hollywood Hills, who moonlighted as a private detective in his spare time as a hobby with the help of his attorney sidekick, CJ Parsons(Pamela Hensley).  Houston was also a bit of a ladies man, and owned a lot of property, along with the fact that MATT HOUSTON was in competition with MAGNUM, PI, except Thomas Magnum (Tom Selleck)was more of a beach-bum who lived on a shoe-string budget, rent-free at a semi-swanky estate in Oahu with an often crotchety British butler, Higgins(John Hillerman), and was always broke and indebted to his fellow Vietnam veteran Navy buddies, TC (Roger E. Mosley), and Rick(Larry Manetti), unlike Houston whom was never indebted to anybody since he was never broke.

Therefore, Houston outclassed Magnum in so many ways, living the kind of lifestyle that Magnum would have envied and wished he had since Magnum basically lived a rich-man's fantasy, unlike Houston whom was made of money, despite the fact that MATT HOUSTON was outlasted by MAGNUM, which ran on CBS for 8 years, from 1980-88 as opposed to MATT HOUSTON only lasting 3 years, and ended up in cancellation in the Spring of 1985, due to MATT HOUSTON's 10PM time-slot on ABC conflicting with MIAMI VICE's 10PM time-slot on NBC, which resulted in MATT HOUSTON losing too many viewers through MIAMI VICE, which K.O.'d MATT HOUSTON in the ratings.",1502409600,,1477,4.904
