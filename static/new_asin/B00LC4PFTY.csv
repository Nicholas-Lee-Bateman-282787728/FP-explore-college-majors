6479454,4,B00LC4PFTY,"Eleven years ago, standing at the edge of a cliff and overlooking the Sonoran desert toward Mexico several miles outside Tuscon, I could only think how terrifying it must be to any of those contemplating crossing that landscape on foot. Dusty, arid and foreboding, it is a completely barren landscape, apart from scrub brush, cactus and hills rising in the far off distance. The rising heat created a dusty filter, which along with the isolation, lack of water and enormous desert confronting us, was one of the most forbidding landscapes I'd ever seen, including desolate snow-covered mountain ranges. I could not fathom being a hopeful immigrant looking at the desert one needed to cross in hopes of a attaining a better future. God Bless those who have ventured to do so.",1417824000,5,774,4.916030534351145
6479455,4,B00LC4PFTY,"This is a documentary but with some parts recreated or rather re-imagined. It starts with the Pima County Sherriff's Department discovering a body in the Sonora desert and their subsequent investigations to find out who he is. They are particularly hopeful on this occasion as he has a distinctive tattoo. Most immigrants are advised not to carry ID documents and to use an alias if caught.

The film makers also use an actor to recreate the possible trip, this is the marvellous Gael Garcia Bernal (`No', Amores Perros', and `Bad Education') who takes the journey North to the USA. Since the late 90's immigration routes into the US had more resources thrown at them as ` an effective deterrent'. Since then deaths in the desert of Arizona have gone up ten fold. The medical examiners have over 2,000 deaths in ten years. This film follows the path to identify such people and who was this tattooed man in particular.

This is not a comfortable watch; there are scenes showing bodies in various advances of decomposition and some of the scenes can be emotionally upsetting too. It does shine a light on the plight of so called `illegal's' and the risks they take to do honest blue collar jobs, in North America, often for minimum wage and all so they can have improved standards of living for their loved ones. It is a shame that in life there is no money to help these people but in death so much effort is expended to find out who they are, so they can be repatriated.

Whilst there is staggering inequality in the World there will always be economic migrants - my parents were such. How we chose to treat them is another matter and as the doctor appearing in this film says - what is the magic number of tragic deaths in the desert that will awaken the authorities to say enough is enough? A very well made and thought provoking documentary that I would recommend but with the above caveats and hope you get as much from it as I did.",1417824000,6,1937,4.5285714285714285
6479456,4,B00LC4PFTY,"When you put a face and family to the immigration dilemma facing the USA, it becomes more heartbreaking. We forget that these are people who want to better their lives and their families lives and some of the struggles they face trying to get to the USA.",1415836800,,254,4.425531914893617
6479457,5,B00LC4PFTY,"Beautiful movie, but I wished they explored more the cause of this problem. Latin american governments corruption and ineffectiveness at creating an economy that works for their people.",1412380800,4,185,5.642857142857143
6479458,5,B00LC4PFTY,"Very moving, realistic movie which focuses on the lives of real people who come north for a better life, not for themselves, but for their kids.  Highly recommended.",1412121600,4,165,4.892857142857143

8665110,4,B00LC4PFTY,"Well-done mockumentary about illegal immigrants from Central America to the United States. Gael Garcia Bernal is in it as an interviewer, but he also shares the experience of the migrants.",1513209600,,188,5.3
8665111,5,B00LC4PFTY,"Very good film.  I still wonder how Gael made all the scenes look so natural, as if each person he meet during his trip was an extra in the movie.  It blurs the lines between movie and documentary in such a smooth way, you will definitely be surprised.  Outstanding edition made it feel like a movie, yet the only ""actor"" was Gael.",1492732800,,331,4.306451612903226
8665112,5,B00LC4PFTY,"This is reality and there is no point in ignoring it.  We might as well be educated in the area of immigration; we might as well contemplate an complex issue which is not easily solved.  Above all, when we talk about immigration, we are talking about people  .  .  .  . living, breathing people.",1491955200,,295,4.37037037037037
8665113,5,B00LC4PFTY,"This movie personalizes the plight of the refugee and makes you realize that these are human beings, not criminals or bad buys.  It covers the whole refugee experience well.",1486598400,,173,4.9655172413793105

8665116,5,B00LC4PFTY,"Don't judge some-one until you walk a day In their shoes! An amazing movie, a must see for all, wish there was more to help these people who are just looking for a better life!  After all,  unless you are Native American,  your parents, grand parents, great grandparents or great great grandparents all did the same thing!!",1441670400,2,323,4.631578947368421
8665117,5,B00LC4PFTY,"Humanize's these people we call ""immigrants"" .....they have families and dreams also. Plus it points out that because the U.S. Subsidizes Corn, people from Central America can't 'compete', so are forced into other types of work. Speaks also to the general Global issues of 'Corprotocracy', how the U.S. Goes to extreme lengths to control resources we covet and in the process creates turmoil in the world. Try John Perkins, ""confessions of an Economic Hitman, and his other books about the subject. Sobering. Cheers.",1441238400,,516,5.228915662650603

8665119,4,B00LC4PFTY,"My daughter needed to watch this movie for school. I watched it with her. The movie is very sad, but it is also a realistic issue that occurs every day when people are crossing the border from Mexico into the United States. I do think it has impacted how I view Immigration Policy in our country.",1435190400,2,296,4.303571428571429
