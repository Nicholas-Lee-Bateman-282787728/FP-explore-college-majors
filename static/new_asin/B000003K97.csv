7902891,3,B000003K97,"Legate Ghemor, the Cardassian who once mistakenly believed Kira to be his daughter (in the episode Second Skin), comes to Deep Space Nine. He is sick  and dying. Although he now knows that Kira isn't his daughter, he still  holds her close to his heart and wants to make her happy. He knows  important information about the Dominion alliance with the Cardassian's and  wants to tell all. But before he can Gul Dukat arrives in a powerful  Jem'hadar Battle Cruiser, he claims to have Ghemor's best interests at  heart and wants to take him home to Cardassia. Dukat has evidence of  Ghemor's involvement during the Bajoran occupation that puts him in a bad  light, Kira must decide whether to be by the side of a dying man who is  desperate for her love or to follow her instincts and hand him over to  Dukat. A touching episode in which the Dukat-Kira relationship once again  comes into play and dominates the action, disappointing that Ghemor doesn't  give us the viewer any important info on the Dominion but always great to  see Weyoun and Dukat!",966729600,2,1049,4.666666666666667
