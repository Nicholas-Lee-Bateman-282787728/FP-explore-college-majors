5932209,4,B00EPA3USA,"Quantum of Solace, 2008 film

It begins with a car chase, the pursuing car fires a submachine gun at the fleeing car! The police block the road, then follow them. There are spectacular accidents! Then we see the contents of the trunk. This is set along the coast of northern Italy. Later we learn about the captive. Will he talk? There is a surprise! A man flees through tunnels pursued by James Bond. Shots are fired! The chase continues, the action is spectacular! You know who wins. They investigate the background. James Bond goes to Hawaii to investigate a suspect. Bond neutralizes his attacker, then leaves with a small suitcase. A woman gives him a ride, there is more action. There is a ruthless leader. He facilitates changes, such as a new government for a general. There is more spectacular action with motorboats and submachine guns!

Seasick? Bond calls HQ for information. Dominic Greene boards a chartered jet plan to talk to his business partners. There will be a new government in Bolivia to allow oil drilling. Getting rid of a man is no problem. Then there is a meeting for wealthy people. [Where did Bond get his outfit?] You see events that are not described. Bond overhears a conversation, then speaks! There is more shooting at the opera and a body falls. M wants Bond back, he refuses. What about Hanes? Be careful of who you trust. Bond meets Mathis and asks for a favor. Next Bond is in La Paz Bolivia. Global warming will create a shortage of water. Fields meets Bond. Is she furious? A man has a plan to rejuvenate the planet (and benefit himself). Im so sorry. What is the Tiara Project? Where is Mathis? Forgive yourself. Bond switches vehicles. There is an attack, smoke pours from the engine! There is a spectacular escape!

M reports to the Minister. There is a necessity for oil, that affects policy. Bond learns about his friends history. A drought makes water expensive. Bond meets M and her help. Why her? Coated with oil! But Bond is not ready to retire. M trusts him now. Can a taxi driver provide information? Bond talks to Felix Leitner. Move your ass and he does. Greene meets with military men. Their payoff is in Euros. Greenes organization owns 60% of the water supply. He makes an offer that cant be refused. Then Bond appears and starts shooting! There is a fight with Greene while fire erupts through the building! Bond questions Greene then releases him in the desert. [Is that a narrow gauge railroad?] Time passes. Bond is in Russia and talks to a couple. Make it quick. Later Bond reports to M. I never left.

This movie has a lot of spectacular action. Is it possible in the real world? This overshadows the weaker plot (which educates you about what is really important to people). The James Bond movies from the 1960's had a good balance between plot and action (as I remember them). They also added humor in spots. This movie seems too intense. Are all those foreign governments corrupt? What about domestic governments? Something for nothing always lures people, look at those who buy scratch-off lottery tickets. Isnt this reliable than calculating the numbers yourself? This movie warns viewers about an attempted monopoly that would control the water supply in a country. Do you know what corporation controls your water supply? Some have criticizes Craig for his average looks and height. It is more realistic to have an agent who doesnt stand out and looks like everyone else. [The Charlie Chan movies in the 1930's pioneered the idea of an investigator that travels to foreign places to solve crimes.]",1416441600,,3565,4.745161290322581
5932210,5,B00EPA3USA,"QUANTUM OF SOLACE is a superior hard-edged James Bond film. Daniel Craig commands the screen with his strong visual presence and captivating aplomb as Ian Fleming's dedicated civil servant. Craig's interpretation of Ian Fleming's James Bond is that of man of few words, but whose mind never sleeps, ultimately to get the job done. He is a physically fit, brutally effective thinking man's Bond. He has a certain unfathomable charm and sardonic humor that makes him appealing to the opposite sex on screen and to the audience as well. The plot of QUANTUM OF SOLACE is character driven.

Looking at QUANTUM OF SOLACE closer, this film is really more of a study of James Bond and his world. This is very evident in Bond's scenes with Ren Mathis (Giancarlo Giannini) and then again with his scene with Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright). The tone of QUANTUM OF SOLACE is very dark and realistic. It is not a glamorous film as has been a hallmark of the series. It is a personal film. David Arnold's score once again continues to break new ground into Bond's hard-edged world. Arnold's ""What's Keeping You Awake"" is a very reflective piece and ""Field Trip"" is a real throwback to the classic Bond sound created by John Barry. I was glad to see that an actual Ian Fleming title was used for this film. I think this was rather fitting.

QUANTUM OF SOLACE has swept aside and maligned since the release of SKYFALL. QUANTUM OF SOLACE was the second film of the James Bond re-boot started with CASINO ROYALE. Somehow SKYFALL seemed to not follow the continuity after  QUANTUM OF SOLACE where Bond was on the top of his game. Of the 3 Daniel this far, QUANTUM OF SOLACE is my favorite.",1414972800,3,1669,4.650847457627119
