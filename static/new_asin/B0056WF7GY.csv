Director Pavel Bardin has made a mockumentary film supposedly about working class Russian skinheads. So is it any good? Well that depends what you actually want from it. It has been sold as `Romper Stomper meets This is England' quoting Variety magazine on the cover. However, it is not as good as either; it owes more in terms of style and presentation to the excellent `Man Bites Dog'&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Man-Bites-Dog-The-Criterion-Collection/dp/B00006FMCS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Man Bites Dog (The Criterion Collection)</a>- but once again fails to achieve the humour or poignancy that the Belgian classic managed.

Russia 88 tells the story of Blade or Sasha (Petr Fedorov) and his gang of skinhead mates, they are urban thugs who spend their time chasing and beating up anyone they feel is not Russian, they are then `coons' or `blakasses' - even when they are white. They are using their half Jewish friend Eddie (or Abraham as they call him) to make films that will be used for propaganda purposes on the internet. In the beginning they are uncomfortable with the camera, but as time goes by it becomes an essential part of what they do, and goes everywhere filming as much as he can.

Their slogan `Russia for the Russians' is almost a mantra that they try to get unwitting members of the public to extol. They meet at a `gym' where their ex soldier fascist coach orders them to do petty thuggery on anyone foreign'. The violence is intermittent and almost school playground at time. There is even some humour, lots of swastikas, racist tattoos and of course a training camp. The real irony is the way they laud Adolf Hitler, if Russia is for the Russians why are the Nazi's so cool?

Having only one camera is limiting, but Bardin (who also wrote this) does make a good go of it, though at times you do feel you missed crucial moments in the story. The inevitable climax is catalysed when Blades sister goes out with a `southern Caucasian' and he is having none of it.

There is enough to keep you hooked and this is far from being a bad film and I did rather enjoy it, I shall certainly remember it. In aspect ratio 16:9, this is Russian with some German and not very good sub titles. The German is translated into German and some of the English is badly spelt, but once you get used to it, it is not too much of a handicap. This is not a great film, but it is a good effort and probably asks more questions than it ever set out to answer. If you like World cinema, then this is a near original concept that is worthy of a watch, but just do not expect too much.",1335571200,,2810,4.659274193548387
