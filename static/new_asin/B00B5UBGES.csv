5559471,5,B00B5UBGES,"It is not often that I am in general agreement with my colleague critic Keris Nine, but in our assessment of Pergolesi's L'Olimpiade I am fully sympathetic to her analysis. L'Olimpiade is by far the true gem of a masterpiece of his four opera seria. Each one shows that his inherent genius had to overcome some awkwardness or mannerism of the opera seria style. And each one shows the progress to the mastery of his own talent. It should be noted that all were composed under very difficult situations, often in great haste,and none were immediately deemed successes. The three preceding opera seria: Salustia, Il Prigioniero Superbo and Adriano in Sirio are all now available in excellent recent performances (sponsored by the Pergolesi/Spontini Foundation)with period instruments and very accomplished singers and performers. The present work is an outstanding composition and certainly represents the high point of the Italian Baroque Style. The melodic writing uses delicate tone colors, smooth elegant expressive lines without the virtuosity displays of earlier works. The pathos in Salustia is here replaced by restained sentimentality and the aria formerly used to summarize a scene now can actually be the climax of the action. I must say that the duo of Megacle and Aristea ""Ne giorni tuoi felici"" that closes act 1 is one of the most ravishingly beautiful pieces of music that I've heard in a long time. Each and every singer in the cast are young and extremely talented and perform as close to perfection as is humanly possible; they sing and act. I cannot extol the virtues of the performers enough.
For several years I've had a very pleasant recording of the L'Olimpiade of Baldassare Galuppi. It is a pleasant and charmingly beautiful setting of the same libretto written some fourteen years later than the Pergolesi. In it I find one of Pergolesi best conceived arias for Megacle ""Se cerca,se dice: l'amico dov'e"" in act 2 pretty much intact.
Pergolesi had only a limited success in his lifetime. His four opera seria were initially failures. In fact Adirano in Siria was considered so bad the the authorities had Pergolesi's name removed from the roster of accepted composers for this Naples theatre. However the very last piece written before death (tuberculosis) the Stabet Mater won some noteriety and is still revered. L'Olimpiade enjoyed some later popularity and was staged many places in Europe including twice in London directed by Handel. However his name was kept alive by his comedy La Serva Padrona which was on the roster of most traveling comedy troups throughout Europe and even in America. I saw it at the old Met with Roberta Peters. The success of this comedy was so great that it evoked in Paris the ""Querelle des Bouffons"" a pamphlet war about which was the better comedy Italian or French.
The revival of interest in ""all things Baroque"" has now shined a light on all the works of this forgotten genius of that time.",1366416000,4,2953,4.9676767676767675
5559472,5,B00B5UBGES,"Despite it having one of the most convoluted plots of any opera, Pietro Metastasio's L'Olimpiade was one of the most popular texts for Baroque composers.  Originally set to music by Antonio Caldara in 1733, it was most notably followed by Vivaldi's version in 1734 and Pergolesi's in 1735, but the libretto has also been set around 60 times by composers such as Hasse, Galuppi, Jommelli, Cimarosa and Piccinni.  Thanks to the Fondazione Pergolesi-Spontini's initiative to revive and release recorded performances of all the composer's operas in new critical editions, we finally have the opportunity to see Pergolesi's version of this immense work and it is something of a revelation.  Not only is it one of Pergolesi's most beautiful works with perhaps the finest musical and singing performances we've seen yet from Jesi, but it also turns out to be one of the best settings of L'Olimpiade that exists.

All of Pergolesi's works released on Blu-ray so far have been given very strong productions with superb performances on period instruments by the very finest experts in this genre, but L'Olimpiade surpasses them all.  To a large extent that's down to Pergolesi's distinctive and sparklingly expressive account of the work, where even the most tragic of circumstances and bitterness of sentiments have an achingly beautiful melancholic quality, but it's brought out exceptionally well by conductor Allesandro de Marchi and the musicians of the Academia Montis Regalis.  The crystalline clarity and warmth of expression, with even the continuo sounding beautifully melodic, comes across particularly well in the HD sound recording here.

More than anything else however it's the singing that really conveys the true sentiments and strengths of this particular work.  Jesi's preference for choosing female sopranos instead of male countertenors is certainly justified by the quality of the performances here of Sofia Soloviy as Megacles and Jennifer Rivera as Lycida.  Soloviy in particular is just astonishing as Megacles, a role that not only has challenging tessitura and ornamentation but it is also particularly demanding and crucial for the expression and characterisation of the human sentiments that lie at the heart of the work.  Sofia Soloviy gives a truly revelatory performance here in her singing of some of Pergolesi's most ravishingly beautiful and sophisticated music.  Jesi's strength in all the previous DVD/Blu-ray releases however has been in the consistently high quality of young singers in all the roles, and L'Olimpiade is no exception.  All up-and-coming talents, young, fresh and free of mannerisms, every member of the cast demonstrate total commitment to the roles, singing with a wonderful clarity of tone and diction.

The staging of the work at the Teatro Valeria Moriconi in Jesi is unusual in that it's performed in the round, on a very small centre stage that has platforms leading to it in the shape of a cross.  There's evidently little room then for decorative props or backdrops, so it's to the credit of Italo Nunziata's direction and the intensity that is drawn from the performances that you never feel less than totally involved in the drama.  Masked figures and dancers manoeuvre characters around this small space, holding up mirrors and barred walls, providing all that is needed to keep the dramatic expression meaningful and without ever getting into heavy symbolism.  What little opening up there is, using balconies for scenes and even for extending out the orchestra, is also most effective and scenically impressive.

The quality of the Blu-ray release is also simply amazing.  The High Resolution image and the sound mixing are breathtaking good, the audio tracks in particular revealing all the qualities of Pergolesi's musical score and the precision playing of the orchestra.  It's also very well filmed by Tiziano Mancini.  This is a challenging production to film, on an unconventional stage in a small theatre with the audience visible all around.  The audience can be a bit distracting, waving fans and reading programmes throughout the whole performance, but the actual performance is well captured and comes across with real dramatic intensity.  We are fortunate to have this magnificent performance recorded and made more widely available, as this brilliant and rare work from one of the greatest composers of the Baroque age really deserves to reach a much larger audience.

The Blu-ray disc from Arthaus Musik is region-free, the audio tracks are the usual PCM Stereo and DTS HD-Master Audio 5.1 with subtitles in Italian, English, German, French, Spanish and Korean.  The only extra features on the disc are trailers for the other Arthaus Pergolesi titles.  The booklet contains an essay on the work which only has a brief outline of the plotline, but I'm sure a full synopsis for this famous Metastasio libretto can be found on-line.  Pergolesi's setting and the performance here however is so good that it shouldn't be too difficult to follow.",1363651200,15,5013,5.2428035043804755
8563050,5,B00B5UBGES,"""L'Olimpiade"" is Pergolesi's last and, by a large measure, best, opera, based on what is arguably Metastasio's best text. It is here impeccably staged, sung and played and the blu-ray recording does full justice to the performance, with excellent picture and sound. If you're at all a fan of baroque opera, just buy it and see it and listen to it: you won't regret it.",1509148800,,368,4.676923076923077
8563051,5,B00B5UBGES,"I am a music lover, but no expert, and therefore I generally hesitate to comment on performances. I was delighted to read, though, that two others have found this production of l'Olimpiade worthy of five stars. I think this opera, as well as the staging, are terrific, and I agree that Sophia Soloviy as Megacle is outstanding. I look forward to viewing the other Pergolesi operas in the box set I have purchased.",1459555200,,413,4.671232876712328
8563052,5,B00B5UBGES,The other reviewers have provided fine commentary... I have nothing to add to their perceptive reviews. Read what they have to say. Buy and enjoy this work of art!,1443916800,,163,4.655172413793103
8563053,5,B00B5UBGES,"L'Olimpiade is not staged as most operas with the orchestra in the pit, the singers on stage, and the audience in front.  Instead an orchestra is on stage with (at least for part of the time) a smaller orchestra is on a balcony to the right while the singers are either on a cross which runs through the audience or on one of the balconies.  The good news with this is that there are stereo effects which DTS makes apparent. The bad news is that one is more aware of what members of the audience is doing than is advisable. Someone is reading, many are fanning themselves, a fellow is tapping his knee, etc.

Anyway it's best to watch this one in DTS if you can - a fact I, myself was not aware of until midway in act three.

By the way, its a musically rich opera that is well sung if not particularly dramatic.",1433116800,,812,4.185897435897436
8563054,5,B00B5UBGES,Absolutely amazing in every way..maybe except for the cross stage showing the audiences which is a bit distracting. I like this DVD even better than Vinci's Artaserse DVD for the singing especially by Sophia Soloviy as Megacle. Beautiful performance and production.,1430352000,3,265,5.487804878048781
8563055,5,B00B5UBGES,"My review will be short  this is a live video released in 2013, of the same work that was released in 2011 on CD, also conducted by Alessandro di Marchi under Harmonica Mundi.
Di Marchi employed an entirely different cast from the CD recording.
I totally agree with the earlier review that the real find of this performance lies in the two sopranos singing Megacle and Argene.
Sophia Soloviy was previously unknown to me, though I believe in the Eastern bloc she must have already made a good name for herself judging from her ravishingly beautiful singing as Megacle. I feel that the casting of Soloviy as this suffering secondary hero is shrewd indeed, just as in Vincis Artaserse, the secondary hero got the main crop of drama and fireworks of the score, Megacle in Pergolesis late masterpiece also snatched the scores trump card. Soloviys scene and aria ""Se cerca, se dice"" in Act 2 is an exemplary piece of performance in its striking expressivity and vocal beauty. She sings in a good range, fully integrated, with crystal enunciation and sheer perfect intonation.
Cuban soprano Yetzebel Arias Fernndez is another young singer that I am unfamiliar with hitherto, but finds great interest after viewing this performance. Her smoky timbre with an expansive scope for dramatic expression is a real tour de force in repertoire ranging from baroque to bel canto and early Verdian works. Her spitfire-like accurate fiorature is simply jaw dropping in its dramatic force and shattering musical effect.
In the minor roles, the great Raul Gimenez as the King and Milena Storti as his courtier Alcandro both offer great performances.
Three young singers fed the bills of the primary hero and heroine Lycidas and Articea, as well as Aminta. I find mezzo-soprano Jennifer Rivera to be struggling a bit vocally with her role in her light weight timbre, while light lyrical coloratura Petrova is a bit on the bland side dramatically. The young tenor singing Aminta has a pleasant light lyrical tenor, but clearly not as seasoned and expressive as the great Gimenez yet.
It is a pleasant reversion to ladies singing trouser roles after hearing and seeing a wide array of countertenors.
A perfect foil to Vinci's ""Artaserse"" DVD indeed.",1421539200,3,2226,4.967828418230563
8563056,5,B00B5UBGES,"Pergolesis 1736 death at the age of barely 26 was one of the musical theatres greatest ever losses. Lolimpiade (1735) resoundingly demonstrates in its later Acts that he had already become an Italian opera seria innovator that could have influenced the entire course of the 18th-century opera.
Pergolesis posthumous fame and were largely sustained by his opera buffa one-acters, notably La serva padrona, and by his sacred work Stabat Mater. Thanks to Alessandro de Marchi and his superb Piedmont period-instrument orchestra Accademia Montis Regalis, one quickly appreciates the composers wider dramatic range and command of an Italianate gift for lyrical characterization.
In setting a Metastasio libretto used by some sixty other composers, Pergolesi heightened the intensity of a drama of hidden identities, torn loyalties and conflicted emotions in his wonderful score.
The venue of this performance in 2011 was the 200-seat Teatro Valeria Moriconi, a made-over twelfth-century church. A cross-shaped platform stage divides the seating area into quadrants with seats facing the centre. The orchestra is seated beyond the tip of the cross; galleries above the other three sides also are used, and singers sometimes move from one level to the other via unseen stairs during ritornellos.
The performance seems relatively bland in Act 1, likely the fault of Italo Nunziatas in-the-round production, which persistently confuses the action by dressing the principals alike and inserting a troupe of masked figurants. However, the power of the work takes firm hold from Act 2 onwards. The predominantly youthful cast, headed in the principal leads by the Russian soprano Lyubov Petrova as Aristea and American mezzo-soprano Jennifer Rivera as Licida, are both sterling members. There are, however, two even more jaw-dropping sopranos in the Ukrainian Sophia Soloviy as the second lead Megacle and Cuban soprano Yetzebel Arias Fernndez as second lady Argene, who engaged in an even more exciting vocal tournament with the leading couple. These four wonderful ladies are joined by two marvelous veterans, the wonderfully rich-toned Italian contralto Milena Storti and Argentinian tenore di grazie Raul Gimenez, already well into his sixties at the time of this performance and singing with utter grace and dramatic alertness. Young tenor Antonio Lozano is also promising in this lyrical tenor fach.
Bubbling tempi sweep through a story of loves swinging consequences. What evidently fired Pergolesis imagination in this libretto is its intermingling of heroism with humanism. To win the prize of Aristeas hand in an Olympic competition, Licida engages his best friend Megacle, a prize athlete, to impersonate him. Megacle was formerly betrothed to Aristea, but dares not tell Licida  whose own earlier lover Argene, thought dead, lives in disguise as a shepherdess at Aristeas court, and must watch Licida throw himself at Aristea. Pergolesis unique style  lilting melodies, throbbing pulses, suspensions  makes his music at once passionate and, as needed, tongue-in-cheek. We feel the lovers pain, joy and despair; we also hear Pergolesi gently mocking their gullibility.
The scores greatest challenge lies in telling a story through persistently repeated motifs, sections and rhythmic cells. Thanks to de Marchis deft contouring, this drama emerges naturally.  With some minor exceptions, his cast cunningly extracts the characters implied in the score.  Volatility lurks just beneath the surface of Aristea, erupting in white-hot coloratura. The bravura of Licida shades into vulnerability through Jennifer Riveras occasional jagged delivery. Both singers have light and whitish timbre well served by the use of body microphones in a small venue. Long stretches of secco recitative prevail, but hardly distracts from the musical drama.
The real find of this DVD, however, lies in the two secondary hero and heroine, though not having any less share in the score to display their marvelous artistry  the Megacle of Sophia Soloviy, a real successor to the greatest sopranos of the previous century with a highly flexible and full timbre, displaying totally stylish singing and terrific expressivity in the portrayal of this characters conflict, despair and pathos.  Megacles Act 2 Scene as well as the Act 3 aria by Soloviy are both the best baroque performance seen in the past 15 years.
Of equal artistic strength is the Cuban soprano Yetzebel Arias Fernndez, who upstages the very fine but rather light weight Russian Lyubov Petrova in almost every turn both in musicality and dramatic expressiveness. Fernndezs slightly darker and fuller timbre brings out the grudge and turmoil of Argene to great effect.
Shining equally brightly with these two young ladies are the veterans: tenor Raul Gimenez, the Prince Ramiro opposite Cecilia Bartoli in the Houston La Cenerentola and already in his sixties in this performance, and the Italian rich-toned contralto Milena Storti.  Gimenezs emotionally charged and stylish deliverance in Act 3 was however not equally matched by de Marchi and his band.
All in all, a most exciting and musically rewarding performance that should not be missed under any circumstances.",1421539200,2,5206,5.4664179104477615
8563057,5,B00B5UBGES,"This is a classic Greek tragedy captured wonderfully by the composer.  The minimalist staging is very appropriate for the genre as it is an intimate opera and a Greek drama needs no grand setting.  I love the way the audience surrounds the stage which consists of a small oval with four ""ramps.""  The singing and acting is wonderful and the costumes capture the classic Greek ""muse"" with a modern touch.  I am looking forward to exploring more from this composer",1417392000,2,462,4.7375
8563058,5,B00B5UBGES,"Pergolesi died young and is known primarily for a one acter La Serva Padrona and the exquisite Stabat Mater.  This opera is a revelation.  The music is exquisite (Mentre Dorme is hypnotically beautiful) and dramatic.  The production (on a cruciform stage with the audience seated around it) is simple and apt, the performers are not stars but sing beautifully and movingly.  The only drawback is that the audience members, vigorously fanning themselves and assiduously reading their programs, are visible and a bit distracting.  But to see and hear such commitment from dedicated young artists is a treasured experience.  Highest recommmendation.",1399161600,6,646,5.41
8563059,5,B00B5UBGES,"This is the first time I have seen L'Olimpiade. I will watch it again.
The performance was conducted by Alessandro De Marchi and sung by Raul Gimenez, Lyubov Petrova and Yetzabel Arias Fernandez. Enjoy.",1368662400,,202,4.970588235294118
