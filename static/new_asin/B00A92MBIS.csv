5401215,5,B00A92MBIS,"I started out watching westerns about two years ago and my passion for them was mostly due to The Big Valley. This show never even crossed my radar until about 4 weeks ago and even then it took a while for me to get into, but now I'm so addicted to it that hardly a moment passes when I don't mention it. People are starting to get irritated too. It's a great show and worth a watch! The episodes are restored wonderfully on the release of Season 1. I can't wait for the release of season 2!",1291507200,19,491,4.072164948453608
5401216,5,B00A92MBIS,"I eagerly awaited  season two as I had purchased season one and had watched most of them pretty quickly . The stories are really good and the picture quality was fine, but what impressed me most  was the beautiful cardboard book that held the discs within the embossed tin. Being two thirds of the way through the collection I placed my order for season two. On arrival I  have found to my horror that the picture book has been replaced by a plain old video case!  The beauty of owning the entire series has been ruined for me and unless I managed to purchase later seasons  at a bargain price I would certainly not continue forking out the rather extortionate asking price at the time of release. If handled gently the discs could be removed quite easily from the cardboard , and I couldn't really understand some of the customers fuss. Thanks to a few moaners a beautiful once in a life time collection has been ruined. I suggest anyone who found need to complain should avoid the Lone Ranger, and Wagon Train collections also as they a beauty to behold and worth every last dime as was season one of the Virginian.  Season two on the other hand doesnt even include as much as an episode guide. Poor, poor marketing for a great series I'm afraid, very poor indeed.",1288224000,15,1266,4.482608695652174

5401258,5,B00A92MBIS,"Without hesitation this is a great show. I like 90 minute shows on TV so this THE VIRGINIAN is good acting, good action portraying kindness and actual scenes one can only believe is true. Every actor fits his or her part and it is so  believing in what they do. I am a western lover so I spend many hours enjoying this and other westerns. Doug McClure is my favorite and not only because of his striking good looks but how expertly he handles his horse, or a situation with quite a sense of humor. He is the only actor who fits the description that a good rider and horse seem as one. He went to rodeos to learn how to properly handle a horse and he learmed well. When he rides away he and his BUCK are as one. I really advise getting it from Amazon as they are so efficient and prompt with their customers.",1495929600,,807,4.140127388535032

in the series. When he left the show, they just couldn't seem to find another actor who could
take his place. He and The Virginian had such good chemistry on the show.

5401390,5,B00A92MBIS,"I have written an overall summary of my feelings about THE VIRGINIAN previously.  I have nearly finished viewing season 4....having already viewed seasons 1,2, 3, and 9.  Lee J. Cobb was still starring in season 2....a wonderful actor...remembered for many fine performances (notably ON THE WATERFRONT).  One of my favorite episodes was It Takes A Big Man...a story of a spoiled rich man without too many redeeming qualities....who finds himself when pushed to his limits.  Another was The Drifter...the story of how the Virginian came to Shiloh.  It is the writing, the story, and the acting that makes this series stand out.  Sometimes, however, I felt some of the stories went on for too long a time......this was a 90 minute show.  Yet, the overall excellent quality of the series lifts it above just the ordinary....and one can forgive having a story that takes a bit more time to tell. I do look forward to watching seasons 5, 6, 7, and 8....I expect my interest will not wane, and my expectations will remain high!  A series not to be missed!",1384560000,3,1049,4.788888888888889

5401434,5,B00A92MBIS,"Here are capsule impressions of selected episodes from the stellar second season.

TO MAKE THIS PLACE REMEMBER -- Guest star, Joan Blondell
The grieving mother of a man hung without trial persuades Judge Garth to hold a mock trial to clear his name. Pungent statement for justice and tolerance, powerfully advocated by Cobb, is perhaps his finest hour on ""The Virginian."" But the Great Actor was unfulfilled by the series, as he let everyone know, and when Cobb finally jumped ship midway in season four the only real surprise was that he hadn't done it sooner.

KILLER IN TOWN -- Guest star, Broderick Crawford
Ruthless bounty hunter sniffs for prey as an epidemic strikes Medicine Bow. Nimble script assigns significant parts to all five series regulars and a snugly fitting role for Crawford's dominating presence. Accomplished episodes like this reflected the confidence of a successful series just beginning to hit full stride.

THE EVIL THAT MEN DO -- Guest star, Robert Redford
Betsy is smitten with a handsome parolee who finds it difficult to adjust to life outside the walls. Redford's sullen charisma gets prime early showcase in exemplary episode directed by Stuart Heisler. Shore's puppy love pangs are touching. Jovial character actor L.Q. Jones appeared frequently as ranch hand Belden.

IT TAKES A BIG MAN -- Guest stars, Lloyd Nolan, Chris Robinson
An old friend asks Judge Garth to hire his disgruntled son, who immediately antagonizes Trampas. Intense drama takes joltingly tragic turn. McClure, Nolan, Robinson and Cobb are excellent, and cherubic Ryan O'Neal has some telling moments as Nolan's other son.

STOPOVER IN A WESTERN TOWN -- Guest star, Dick York
Genial cowpoke takes up rustling to finance courtship with high-toned woman who actually prefers The Virginian. Best remembered as the bedazzled Darren in ""Bewitched,"" York proves he can do more than look astonished with haunting performance in dark, disturbing tale. Apart from its rawness, episode is noteworthy for staunch opposition (calmly articulated by Drury) to vigilante lynch law condoned in Owen Wister's novel.

THE FATAL JOURNEY -- Guest star, Robert Lansing
The Virginian infiltrates an outlaw gang responsible for the death of Molly Wood. Lansing's brilliance as the cruel, calculating bandit chief is matched by Drury's tight-lipped ferocity. Inevitable shootout against long odds is vividly staged by director Bernard McEveety. ""Molly Wood"" was a character in name only, since Pippa Scott's participation in the series ended in season one.

ROAR FROM THE MOUNTAIN -- Guest stars, Jack Klugman, Joyce Bulifant
Steve journeys to trap a maneating cougar but gets snared in an unhappy couple's discord. Fans of ""The Odd Couple"" will find no trace of Oscar Madison in Klugman's performance as the timorous, self-loathing husband. Clarke's growing attraction to lonely wife Bulifant heightens tension in edgy, disquieting drama directed by Earl Bellamy.

FIRST TO THINE OWN SELF
Betsy tries to shield young drifter Randy Benton, who is dodging a murder rap. Entertaining episode introduces Randy Boone's stereotyped but engaging rustic character to the series. Bruce Dern, then locked in a sneering villain stereotype, dukes it out with Drury in rousing finale.

ANOTHER'S FOOTSTEPS -- Guest stars, Sheree North, John Agar, Paul Petersen
While tracking a murderous bank robber, The Virginian offers a helping hand to a suspect's distressed family. Drury registers his conflicting emotions strongly under R.G. Springsteen's direction. Swarthy George Keymas, one of the busiest of western heavies, plays a renegade Indian. Petersen's guest-starring stint has to be the briefest in television history.

THE SECRET OF BRYNMAR HALL -- Guest star, Jane Wyatt
Betsy and Randy spend a dark and stormy night at a mansion where strange deaths have occurred. Shore shrieks and shivers through diverting Gothic mystery that's longer on atmosphere than plausibility. Former ""Father Knows Best"" star Wyatt is chilling in rare menacing role. Other cast names forever linked to a hit series include Mark Goddard (""Lost in Space""), Victor French (""Little House on the Prairie"") and Edward Platt (""Get Smart"").",1330300800,12,4183,5.353120243531203

5401436,5,B00A92MBIS,"As a country lover person, I fell in love with these episodes when I saw them on cable TV. Being an inmigrant to this great nation, I did not have the opportunity to see them when they first aired, in the 60's.  Disapointed that they were about to be discontinued, I decided to purchase the episodes on DVS.  The theme, morality, and good taste of these episodes make today's harsh and inmoral shows all the more disgusting.  Not to mention the great job of the leading characters which leaves nothing to envy from any other great country movie stars.",1328659200,2,551,4.545454545454546

All of the stars are wonderful but Trampas is a little more special to me that I think my husband may be just a little jealous, lol. It is truly a wonderful show that all the family can enjoy without all the badstuff that you wouldn't want your children and grandchildren to see.

5401469,5,B00A92MBIS,"A good family series, with the shows that are on TV today with all the violence and the sex it is nice to have a show that doesn't have all that violence. It does have some violence but that was the norm back in the western days. But nothing compared to today's society. the acting was real,the actors have a chemistry that works well together. They were family and friends and it showed through each episodes. Each story had a value or moral that everyone could learn from and use throughout their lives regardless of their age. A show for young and old alike.",1299456000,5,561,4.403846153846154
5401470,4,B00A92MBIS,"The 2nd season was not packaged as nicely as the first season, and I thought at first that the film quality was less, but that turned out not to be true. The film quality is right there with the first season. On packaging -- Season 1 looks like a book, and each ""page"" has a description of each episode including each guest appearance, and the date it was shown originally. The 2nd season doesn't have pictures on every holding page like the 1st season does (subsequent seasons are packaged like season 2). The interview of James Drury was exactly the same as the 1st season interview. On the plus side, there is an interview with Clu Gulager.

I'm a long-time Virginian fan, and even have the Owen Wister book. I know I will continue buying every season offered. I'm even writing my own season 2 episode descriptions with guest appearances so I'll know where to locate each episode.",1298592000,6,883,4.5886075949367084
5401471,5,B00A92MBIS,Season 2 of The Virginian is very good.  My only complaint was that it did not provide a short description of each episode like the Season 1 DVD set.  I like the way the DVD's were packaged in the first season.,1298419200,7,210,4.097560975609756

Amazon has done it again. The DVD quality is excellent, and it is hoped that the other seasons will be available in the future.",1296172800,3,416,4.608108108108108
5401474,5,B00A92MBIS,"I have season one and now season two. I truly enjoy the show length allowing character and story development (I think a principal reason for it's initial long run on TV). The restored and digitally remastered video/sound is very good.
Although some reviewers like the season two packaging (multiple plastic hinged DVD carriers) better than season one, I prefer season one's book like package with title, air date, featured guest and short story description for each DVD jacket. TMG has done a very good job of preserving this outstanding TV show. I look forward to purchasing season three the from TMG because of the product quality.",1296086400,8,633,4.981132075471698
5401475,5,B00A92MBIS,"The Virginian was a quality show in every way--the cast, writing, cinematography, music, etc. Imho it was the best Western of the 1960s. The second season starts out with a great episode that gives the back story for Trampas. The picture quality seems to me just as good as season one--and in fact maybe a little bit better. What they were trying to do with The Virginian was make a whole little B-Western movie each week, and for the most part they pulled it off. Highly recommended.

James Drury stars as The Virginian and Doug McClure co-stars as Trampas. They are both great in these roles. The Virginian is tall, dark, handsome, and mostly serious, while Trampas is blond and buff and has a devil-may-care attitude at times. The rest of the cast is excellent too, and each week there are fine guest stars, including in this season Royal Dano (who was also the voice of Lincoln for Disney's Meet Mr. Lincoln), Gena Rowlands, Robert Redford, Slim Pickens, Yvonne de Carlo, Dick York, Mariette Hartley, Deforest Kelley and Leonard Nimoy of later Star Trek fame (in the same episode!), Jack Klugman, Peter Graves, etc., etc...

And as the earlier reviewer said, Timeless has now fixed the packaging. The DVDs are now in cases rather like they have for the original Star Trek series on blu-ray. I didn't have problems with the packaging for season one, but I do prefer the new packaging.",1294185600,19,1387,4.7272727272727275
