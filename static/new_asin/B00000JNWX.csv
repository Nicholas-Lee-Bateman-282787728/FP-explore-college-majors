The production is really low-budget, it's old grainy pictures with boring voice-over narration, and it's not remotely current or interesting. They don't even mention the red-light district of Amsterdam, they think there is still a wall in Berlin, and the narrator sound like some boring office manager reciting next years budget. It makes the Rick Steves stuff on PBS positively tingle with inspiration, and that's pretty bad.",1006819200,2,501,5.3544303797468356
