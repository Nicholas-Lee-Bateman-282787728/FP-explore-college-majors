I recommend this video to anyone who wishes to delve into the personal accounts of ""experiencers"" and their heart wrenching stories and emotional scars that these events leave behind.",1263686400,14,335,5.4423076923076925
3499262,4,B001BT1SH8,"Both compassionate and skeptical, indie filmmaker Laurel Chiten leads us into the complex world of people who believe they have been abducted by alien life forms. Chiten's provocative and intimate interviews with Harvard Professor, John Mack forced me to question my own beliefs and ideas about American mythology, story telling, dreams and the cosmos. ""Touched"" shook my world for several days, a true testament of its psychological impact.",1225065600,21,441,5.5

8284778,3,B001BT1SH8,"John Mack is presented well, but the documentary itself needs a producer to give it focus and direction, and a sound engineer to balance the volume levels.  Nowhere is this more needed than during the sequence when the guy is screaming profanity at the memory of his abductors during his hypnosis session.  Overall the movie was okay for some of the information presented, and for the footage of John Mack, but it needs a professional touch to make it into a better documentary.  The overall narrative seemed to lack direction and flow.",1416096000,4,536,4.804347826086956

8284780,4,B001BT1SH8,"This documentary is about Harvard psychiatrist John E. Mack's (open minded) investigations of people who claim to have encountered (non-terrestrial) alien beings.  It is at the same time intriguing, fascinating, thought provoking, and ultimately very entertaining.

Mack started off bearing a conventional scientific rationalist world-view, which discounts all experiences which do not fit that limited, anthropocentric, anthropo-chauvinistic mindset.  But over the course of many, many sessions, he came to believe the stories as being real, in large part because he could find no evidence that the claimants were suffering from psychological impairment or pathology.

The criticism that Mack, and the claimants suffer from the conventional thinking establishment is, for me, the most entertaining aspect of the video.  They seem almost desperate to place the experiences of others into their comforting world view in which humans are the highest lifeform in the known universe, and all that all who threaten this view are to be condemned, shunned, and silenced as delusional heretics.

The film also contains an unexpected degree of poignance.  In one case, a woman was interbred with an unknown male, and the offspring genetically altered by the aliens.  A few years afterward, her ""children"" were introduced to her, and she was allowed to meet with them for only a short period of time.  The longing of this mother for her little known children brought her to tears, understandably so.

In another case, the wife of a male abductee suffered jealousy and resentment after learning that during her husband's abductions, he felt as if his breeding partner was more like his real wife and soulmate, than the woman he had married.",1347840000,2,1729,5.3468634686346865
8284781,4,B001BT1SH8,"This is a good book if you are interested in the alien abduction phenomenon. Dr. Mack is highly educated and presents the material well. His statistics are a bit shocking; such as the number of abductions. If one accepts the experiences as abductions, then one is left with the question of why they are happening. Any possible answer to that question is disconcerting.",1326844800,5,368,4.857142857142857
8284782,4,B001BT1SH8,"This indie documentary is rather unusual in that it focuses just as much on the investigator - and the culture of such work within academe - as it does the testimony of those claiming to have been abducted by aliens.  The investigator in question is the late Dr. John Mack, arguably the bravest and most important researcher in the nascent history of the alien abduction field.  As a Pulitzer Prize-winning clinical psychiatrist at Harvard Medical School, Dr. Mack's work with alien abductees - and his conclusion that this was a real phenomenon requiring future study - was a huge shot of legitimacy in the arm of a field of inquiry that even most ufologists didn't dare touch at the time.  The publication of Abduction: Human Encounters With Aliens in 1994 set off a firestorm of controversy and rattled the cloistered halls of the Harvard establishment.  Even though Mack's primary interest lay more with the transcendent than the physical aspects of the abduction scenario and how the experience affected the subject's worldview, the mainstream press was quick to label him a true believer and took to referring to him as Mack-O the Wack-O - and the Dean of Harvard Medical School went so far as to form a committee to review Mack's work and investigative standards.  This unprecedented move against a tenured professor opened up a larger debate about academic freedom.  Undaunted, Mack withstood all of the pressure, defended his clinical practices eloquently, and retained his job.  Unfortunately, shortly after the release of this documentary, Dr. Mack was hit and killed by a drunk driver in London (a most suspicious death, in my opinion).

In terms of abductees themselves, this documentary basically covers the story of just two of Dr. Mack's patients, both of whom have been greatly affected by their experiences.  The first, a young lady named Karin, relates a series of abductions dating all the way back to early childhood and involved the production of alien hybrid children.  The second subject, a 40-ish male, also reports a sexual agenda behind his abductions, and the viewer is given the opportunity to listen to a couple of significant clips from his actual hypnotic regression sessions with Dr. Mack.  In addition to this, his story is presented from the viewpoint of his long-suffering wife as well as himself, allowing the viewer a rare look at the traumatic effects of the abduction phenomenon on a spouse.  Two other abductee stories are also described to some extent when the filmmaker travels to Brazil to see how the abduction phenomenon is being reported and received in a different culture.

The other major component of this documentary is the controversy surrounding Dr. Mack's work at Harvard Medical School.  In an egregious example of the pot calling the kettle black, the head of the Harvard-appointed head of inquisition (oops, I mean inquiry) criticizes Mack as hopelessly biased and pretty much accuses him of being the leader of a cult.  Mack himself defends his work as the proper thing for a clinical psychiatrist to do when confronted by something he cannot explain.  Others, such as Harvard Law School's Alan Dershowitz, defend Mack in the spirit of academic freedom and espouse the danger of censorship from above in an institution supposedly dedicated to pursuing knowledge with an open mind and a free spirit of debate.

This is clearly not your everyday alien abduction documentary because director Lauren Chiton does not truly focus on the alien abduction scenario itself.  We only hear snippets of the personal experiences of less than a handful of abductees, and no attempt is made to dramatize or recreate any abduction.  In fact, I don't believe you'll even find the image of a single alien anywhere in the presentation.  It does make for interesting viewing, though, providing a different yet valuable viewpoint on the abduction phenomenon and the academic perception of research in this particular field.",1310601600,4,3960,5.063076923076923
8284783,4,B001BT1SH8,"I'm not sure if the current 2008 edition of the DVD is the same, but the 2003 edition has some hidden bonus features (in addition to stated bonus features like deleted scenes and an extended interview with Harvard's Alan Dershowitz on the subject of John Mack's academic freedom). The main hidden bonus feature is a short but interesting audio interview with the filmmaker Laurel Chiten conducted by author Whitley Strieber. To access this, go to the ""biographies"" menu, and click on the collar of the priest, or the sunglasses worn by another of the people in the bios menu. This works on the 2003 edition, but as I've said, the current edition may be different.

UPDATE: The 2008 edition (with the UFOTV logo in the lower left corner of the case) does *not* include the hidden audio interview with the filmmaker conducted by Whitley Strieber. Other differences are minor:

The 2008 edition has an excruciatingly long animated promo for the UFOTV brand. It just goes on and on and on, longer than any logo should. The regular bonus features (extended interview with Alan Dershowitz etc) are present, though all in-a-row rather than selectable individually, and quite atypically, the FBI warning and the UFOTV logo play AGAIN before the bonus feature plays (I've never seen that on any DVD's special features before).

The visual quality of the DVD is no better or worse than the original release; although much of it was shot on miniDV and edited digitally, the final output is pretty bad, with weak blacks, excessive grain, and blurry titles. But those flaws were present on the original release too, so, either one will serve you equally well. It is still an interesting documentary despite the subpar presentation.",1284508800,6,1718,4.937716262975779
8284784,3,B001BT1SH8,"I read John Mack's book previous to seeing his video and must admit some of the material in the book sounded like some of the alleged abductees truly were suffering some bizarre psychological trauma far removed from the abduction phenomina and heavily in need of a vial of high dose qualudes.  I'm coming from the vantage point of having read about a dozen varied books on the UFO subject and seen 8 or so video documentaries (probably the same ones you have) on the same.  Mack's presentation is much like Bud Hopkin's experience with reported abductees and once you've seen the ""hypno"" sessions of either, you get the idea.  I can never help but wonder that because these docu's are carefully put together, how much of it is genuine and how much is slanted.  Listen, we don't need the mysterious background music when an event is being investigated.  That doesn't happen in real life so don't try to enhance the presentation to the point of fantasy with your outer space music.  Yeah, I do believe there are UFO's (even though I've yet to see one), and consider it very likely there are other life forms in our universe somehow manifesting themselves in our environment but I can never help that nagging adage, ""where there's money to be made""...  Mack strikes me, at least on camera, to be a very genuine and sincere person.  It also is very satisfying to see that professional people are so amazed by this apparent anathema among us that they devote much of their lives to it whilst suffering the criticism and ridicule of their present and former colleagues.  It leaves me with the feeling that due to the high level of professional involvement there really IS a universal and widespread belief in the abduction/UFO phenominon.  The video presents much of the same ""evidence"" as witnessed in documentaries which have come before it.  Mack's merely adds to the heap of cases.
  As in almost every well-planned production, I often fear that what we aren't told can be just as important as what we are in creating biases.  For instance, I find it hard to believe that ANY psychologist can merely count to five and send someone off apparently into the magical land of hitherto forgotten recent memories much less alone causing them to act out their supposed experiences. Can it really be that easy??
  Mack's docu leads us to the usual end-user dilemma of being left with a whole bunch of unanswered questions and no closer to a bonified answer with respect to the hugely amazing claims of alien abductions.  It's another OK alien subject video which will probably enhance the wonderment of such reported experiences but it is nowhere near the final answer to the inquisition.",1277164800,5,2677,4.772234273318872
