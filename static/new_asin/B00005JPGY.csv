I loved the show when I was a ""tween"" and 40 years later I still think of him often.  He had the opportunity to make a comeback in Pulp Fiction in 1990 and turned it down.  It makes you wonder whether he would have made a big comeback, and maybe become an idol again to he women in my age bracket.  I will definitely buy the series if it comes out on DVD.",1166918400,3,500,4.071428571428571
1569710,5,B00005JPGY,"I have been searching and waiting for the release of this tv series, The Legend of Jesse James, for a very, very long time.  I hope my long wait is finally coming to an end!  This was a great tv show and I'm sure there are plenty of Christopher Jones fans still out there who feel the same as I do.  Please listen to the fans and release this series on DVD!!!",1164585600,5,359,3.9583333333333335
1569711,5,B00005JPGY,"This was a great TV series. Why is was cancelled after only two seasons

is a puzzle to me. PLEASE, Amazon release it. Also, We Chris Jones fans

would like ALL of his work released on DVD ( this includes A BRIEF SEASON ).

So Make us Christohper Jones Fans happy & give us HIS ENTIRE BODY OF WORK.",1160092800,15,298,4.016949152542373

1569713,5,B00005JPGY,"I am more than thrilled that there is going to be a DVD on The Legend of Jesse James. It has been a long time coming. I discovered the actor, Christopher Jones, on this series and I have a long time fan since then. That was a long time ago but it is still fresh in my mind. I won't forget the first time I saw Chris playing Jesse. I just wish I could have saved his shows on tape. Being able to own a DVD of the series would be the bomb! I hope anybody else that is a Christopher Jones fan will please make your voice heard. Let them know how much we want a DVD of The Legend of Jesse James.  Debbie, a fan",1156896000,9,606,3.7716535433070866
1569714,5,B00005JPGY,"""The Legend of Jesse James"" television series aired on the ABC Network from September 13, 1965 to September 5, 1966. There were thirty-four thirty-minute black-and-white episodes. In terms of ratings, it did not do badly. In fact, the series had a sizable and loyal following. Unfortunately, it spent its entire network run--Monday nights in the 8:30 to 9:00 ET time slot--up against a perennial ratings powerhouse, ""The Lucy Show,"" on CBS. To the disappointment of a legion of fans, ABC cancelled the series after only one season. This was not a top-notch western, in the ""Bonanza"" or ""Big Valley"" sense, but it was very good and had a fine cast, including Christopher Jones (""Wild in the Streets"") in his first on-screen role. Jones' promising film career was all-too-short, and this series is a valuable showcase for his on-film charisma and talent. In addition to Chris Jones, the series featured a host of veteran actors, such as Allen Case (""The Deputy""), Robert J. Wilke, Ann Doran, Tim McIntire, and John Milford, and guest stars like Susan Strasberg and Charles Bronson. The series' ""Robin Hood"" account of Jesse James' life and career is highly-fictionalized. In keeping with the sixties, James here is portrayed largely as ""the product of a permissive society."" This series is a ""lost classic"" of the 1960s, and I look forward to purchasing this DVD collection as soon as it becomes available!",1156291200,19,1404,5.030042918454936
7941872,5,B00005JPGY,When will this series finally be released on DVD or online?  I loved it so much as a kid; Christopher Jones was such a beauty ....,1456099200,,130,4.0
7941873,5,B00005JPGY,I was not aware of this show until I read Christopher Jones' obituary.  He was very popular after WILD IN THE STREETS.  Shortly after RYAN'S DAUGHTER his star faded.  I would definitely buy this in DVD just for the historic value of his time in show business.  It's sad that he is now lost to us completely at the age of 72.  I hope those who have the capability will bring this half hour show from the 60's to DVD.,1391904000,3,415,4.1375
7941874,5,B00005JPGY,"Just sitting here brainstorming about all the great series I'd love to own and this one came to mind and it was like ""Of course!  I HAVE to have that one!""  Brings back so many good memories of the westerns I loved:  This one, Bonanza, The Big Valley, and Laredo.  Was it ever released on DVD?  If not, I don't know who we have to appeal to, but PLEASE get this to DVD so the fans can order it!  With no such things as VCR's or DVD players, I did the next best thing back then:  I recorded the audio of the half-hour shows on a reel-to-reel!  I'd order this series right away if it was offered.",1345507200,2,594,4.017094017094017
7941875,5,B00005JPGY,"RATS! Another great tv western series I missed. Hope it gets put back out so I might be able to pick it up. If I remember correctly there was only one season and it was canceled because of the fear that it made Jesse James look like a hero to us kids instead of an outlaw. It was a different world in the 50's and early 60's. Not saying that it wasn't a good thing, just different.",1269388800,3,381,3.961038961038961
7941876,5,B00005JPGY,What a great TV show this was. I used to rush home from school to make sure I had done my homework and household chores well beforehand so I could watch this in peace. The whole family loved it. My parents have passed on. I just hope I am still around by the time someone extracts their digit and releases it on DVD...pretty please !!!,1192752000,2,335,4.1692307692307695
7941877,5,B00005JPGY,"I have such fond memories of this short lived series!  I would definitely buy the DVD if it becomes available.  I still think of this show over 40 years after it first aired.  Please help us baby boomers re-live our fantasy with Christopher Jones as Jesse James!  He was a hot as they get!

7941879,5,B00005JPGY,"Used to rush home from school back in the early seventies to catch this show here in the UK, with somewhat limited success. Can still hear ""that"" song and those title images it played over. Never thought I'd ever see this again so get on with it Studio that owns this, and if not, give it to somoeone independent who will!",1167436800,5,322,4.295081967213115
7941880,5,B00005JPGY,"Christopher Jones, is one of Hollywood's Finest Actors. All of

his Movies and his TV Series should be released on DVD.  The

Legend of Jesse James Series was watched by more women, because

of him. Not to mention his movies!!!!

  He is a ""Very Talented Artist"" now, and if the right movie would

come along, maybe we will see him again on the Big Screen.  Please

release his movies and TV Series.

I still remember many of the cast members, and how handsome Christopher Jones and Allen Case were. I am still hoping, praying and longing to see the TV series again. Please, someone make this dream possible for all of ""Jesse James'"" Fans!!",1167264000,8,386,4.422535211267606
