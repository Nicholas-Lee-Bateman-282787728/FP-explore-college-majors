7850058,3,6303507646,"I saw this movie on TCM.  The main reason to watch it is that it is a remarkably well-preserved/restored example of a 1913 movie.  I found it well made, the acting good for the period.  What I found amusing about it was that nothing has changed, then to now, in terms of how the peculiar institution of the World's Oldest Profession is portrayed.  Of course, there has always been a reprehensible, seedy side to that industry.  But the conservative moralists and the liberal dogooders always want the public to believe that it's all about innocent girls being kidnapped, raped, and held against their wills as slaves.  The reality is, overwhelmingly, far more mundane.

I'm old enough to remember when a brothel was not that hard to find, especially if a boy was connected in some way, practically anywhere in the country.  The operatives, usually girls aged seventeen to twenty-three, were invariably unwed mothers, cast out by their conservative families with no job skills or way to support their children.  They weren't even recruited, just showed up at a madam's door, referred, word of mouth, by someone in a position to know that their services might be worth a little money and perhaps even a place to stay for a while.

The brothels of the sixties were illegal but tolerated by the authorities.  In many ways, they were safe houses; security was tight.  The police patrolled and kept order, if required.  Sure, no doubt many of the operatives ended up in prison for something, their children remanded to the Court.  Most probably just faded back into the woodwork.  Believe it or not, some found husbands from among their clients.  I know that, at least second hand.  From what I saw, prostitutes don't hate men, what they do or what they are.  In fact, many like it very much, would be having sex with strange men whether they got paid for it or not.  Indeed, it may well lend a little power to the powerless.

I'm just saying, don't buy into all the propaganda . . .",1381104000,,1977,4.6753623188405795

I purchased this video after a failed attempt to record this off Turner Classic Movies on cable TV.  My only complaint is that this DVD version has no soundtrack! No music score --NOTHING!  Yes, it IS a silent film (I knew that) but even the TCM version had a soundtrack with music, and IMHO the people who produced this DVD could have provided something on the soundtrack, even if it was canned ""elevator music"" to provide something to listen to.",1292284800,10,541,4.625
7850061,5,6303507646,"I'm very glad I came across ""Traffic in Souls"" because I thoroughly enjoyed it and was surprised how very good and entertaining such an early feature film could be.  Not only is it an excellent crime drama in itself, it has special significance for its adventurous exposure of the real-life crime problem at that time, namely white slave traffic.  The film depicts the various ways in which innocent young women were tricked and abducted, then held captive in a ""den of iniquity"" for the slavery market.  Emigrants arriving in New York were targeted, as were naive women from the country, and even a shop assistant who falls victim to the charms of one of the operators.  Another true-to-life aspect emphasized in this film is that the ""man higher up"" in the racket is a prominent and honorable member of society who pretends to be taking the lead in ridding the city of white slave trafficking.  The film also gives us a closer, more personal look into the lives of the two families involved, making it much more than just a crime story about the cops getting the bad guys in the end.  Another fascinating aspect, I found, was the means by which the main members of the operation where ultimately convicted, namely by recording their conversations with the latest technology of the time; the phonograph recording.  Futhermore, the film quality is very good throughout, and the new piano musical score by Philip Carli is also excellent, making this a really worth while film to add to any good movie collection.",1089849600,10,1511,4.788461538461538
