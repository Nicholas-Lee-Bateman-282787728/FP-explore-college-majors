7989189,3,B000094J7M,"I won't bore you with the plot as I am sure you can find that elsewhere. This movie about a few teenagers having a little fun and mischief becomes dark rather quickly. There is sexual assault, drug and alcohol use, and suicide. It is not a happy movie about kids messing around an empty amusement park for a day. When I remember being a teenager, I felt the same range of hormones that made most of us insane at that time in our lives. Roller-coaster takes a look at that and shows how far off the deep end this emotional roller-coaster can take us if we are unfortunate enough to be in such a situation. The acting was very good for what seems like a small budget movie. The story is sad, but did not really resonate deeply with this viewer. I thought the attitude at the end after the last traumatic event showing a little but not deep emotion was spot on though - teenagers do not yet have the emotional capacity to properly deal with these feelings and sometimes appear to society as sociopaths in that approach. It does not mean they do not feel for it, it is just how they react. The stand out actors are Kett Turton and Brendan Fletcher.",1370822400,,1144,4.325581395348837

7989191,1,B000094J7M,"Now your problay wondering why i put 1 star on their
and the put ""THIS MOVIE SUCKS"".Well that's because
it has only 1 good scene in their that's when that kid
with the spikey red hair gets his revenge on the pedofile
security guard. This movie really has no plot,no story
they really don't tell what are the story behind these
5 troubled teenagers. And i think whoever made this movie
needs to go back to college because he has no idea how to make
a film in my opinon. And i would only reccomend this movie
to (...),lesbians,pedofiles,troubled teens,adults
or canadians",1116892800,3,569,4.588235294117647
7989192,4,B000094J7M,"Another entry in the aimless youth category, Rollercoaster is the story of five young teens, who break into a deserted amusement park. They walk around, drink booze, smoke pot, and are just generally upset with the world. However, two of these kids have an agenda. They plan to kill themselves at the end of the day, jumping from the top of a rollercoaster. What makes this movie so compelling to watch are the excellent performances from the entire cast, and the ending is quite startling. The actual DVD has no special features to speak of except being widescreen and you can watch the trailer. I would recommend this to anyone who likes (or is affected by) the films of Larry Clark (Kids or Bully). Watch out for the park security guard!",1058745600,6,740,4.656488549618321
