2439363,5,B000BRQWTA,What a GREAT DVD that simply teaches you the most popular line dances.  Even my 11 year old son quickly learned the Party Line Dance steps and confidently used them at his 1st school dance.  Thanks Shawn!!,1164499200,6,205,4.513513513513513
2439364,4,B000BRQWTA,"This DVD has saved me from the disgrace of not knowing how to do the Electric Slide.  (I even managed to recognized it in the Tyler Perry movies!!)  Shawn knows his stuff.  This is a great intro for beginners and the uninitiated.  I would have liked an extended practice time, but the instruction is solid, so I can turn on my fav country station and get that myself.",1164153600,6,367,4.352941176470588
2439365,5,B000BRQWTA,This DVD was also GREAT! We started with the Quick Start Guide to Line Dancing and went immediately into this one. This DVD was different in that it gave some fun options to do for the dances rather than focusing more on the steps and it had some new ones. We breezed through this DVD being that we were comfortable with the steps. This DVD's also really easy to learn from and definitely a great value. Our favorite was the Tush Push! GEORGE,1164067200,6,442,4.337349397590361
2439366,5,B000BRQWTA,I highly advised the Party Line Dance DVD if you want to learn some fun line dances.  My husband did not want to learn line dances at first but now he loves them.  We learned the line dances in a little bit of no time.  They are so easy to learn and fun too.  This DVD will have you and your friends line dancing in no time.,1161734400,7,324,3.791044776119403
2439367,5,B000BRQWTA,"with this dvd, i learned and mastered electric slide and all main variations in 5 minutes, after years of bafflement seeing it on the floor at least a hundred times. i have it clearly in my mind now. shawn shows it with absolute clarity. (electric slide is strangely rooted in harlem swing-era moves!)

shawn rocks!",1153353600,7,315,4.7272727272727275
2439368,5,B000BRQWTA,"I have now had a chance to review both this DVD and the couples ultimate dance sampler (thank you so much!) that I received.  I thought they were great!  They were the most thorough dance DVDs that I have ever seen, and I have seen plenty.  Every step was shown so thoroughly that I can't imagine anyone NOT getting it after they get through with the DVDs.",1153094400,7,356,4.2835820895522385
2439369,1,B000BRQWTA,"Please be advised that if you are thinking you are going to buy this and be able to have friends over and get up and dance to the music, it's not going to happen.  This is a rather instructional piece that does not even have the actual music, at least to the Electric Slide.  This is not a group of folks dancing to the music to provide visual pleasure and something fun to dance with.  This is one man showing steps.",1152835200,14,417,4.1234567901234565
2439370,5,B000BRQWTA,"I was standing on the sidelines..wanting to do the Electric Slide...  Now.. I can do it better than anyone...

2439371,5,B000BRQWTA,"I own many dance instuction tapes and DVD's, but they're all collecting dust.  Not, Shawn Trautman's.  I have 4 of his now.  This is the best one for a beginner. Anyone, and I mean anyone can learn to dance with his DVD's.",1132272000,40,222,4.238095238095238
2439372,5,B000BRQWTA,"Excellent dance instruction for someone like me who is pretty much a novice. I had to learn some basic steps quickly for a wedding so this video was an outstanding tool for me. It was quick, easy and fun. Even my kids learned a few moves. I highly recommend this video and I will certainly check out Shawn's other products.",1129680000,35,323,4.4

2439378,5,B000BRQWTA,"Music was not the best but the instruction is.  I listen to  my own music and would purchase  from this instructor again.  Get it, its a blast and great exercise with fun, the best.",1394409600,,181,4.235294117647059
2439379,5,B000BRQWTA,My husband and I do ballroom dancing and have learned some line dances from Shawn. He and his wife are good teachers. Step by step instructions.,1389916800,,144,4.576923076923077
2439380,4,B000BRQWTA,"Fast, easy way to learn some of the line dances in my living room.  The instructor has an excellent way of teaching each dance in segments with repetition.  Pleased with this purchase.",1382227200,,184,4.71875
2439381,1,B000BRQWTA,"Shawn Trautman shows you the steps, but not to the music that they are usually done to.  I learned more on youtube and would not waste my money on this product.",1374192000,2,160,4.161290322580645
2439382,4,B000BRQWTA,I bought this for my 70 year old mother and she had a very easy time following along with the instruction.,1373500800,,106,4.095238095238095

2439384,5,B000BRQWTA,I loved this would be more fun if I had someone to do it with . it was slow and showed you several times so you could catch on. he didn't go off and leave you like some .,1367366400,,170,3.3846153846153846
2439385,2,B000BRQWTA,"amazon is great , I have not had any problems with deliveries, purchases etc.  Unfortunately, this dvd was very disappointing.  I was fooled by the price, meaning it was alot more than most the others so I thought this must be a good one!!. Wrong, it was ok. Short instruction, short dance time to an actual song, dvd froze, and the ""many more"" dances than listed on the cover was a joke etc.  If it would have been $10. I wouldn't have cared but $50.???!!  What really upset me in the end though, was that they would not return my money until I removed all my comments and reviews about their product.  So now that I have my money..here it is. You can keep your dvd and I won't ever order from shaun again.",1332979200,,707,4.246268656716418
2439386,4,B000BRQWTA,"this is a great basic beginners video on some popular line dances...the only thing I didn't like was the music they played for a couple of the dances because it wasn't the original music that went with it.  (i.e. electric slide).

I also liked that he showed variations of the dances....",1300752000,,287,4.607843137254902
2439387,2,B000BRQWTA,This is detailed step by step but he must not be licensed to use the original dance songs with the DVD because the music thats played faintly in the background is not even the songs that go with the dance. Instructor very dry and monotone. You're better off trying to find it for free with You Tube.,1287532800,5,299,4.2631578947368425
2439388,5,B000BRQWTA,"This is a wonderful DVD for learning line dancing.  Coming from a person that has never danced before, I was thrilled to get instructions from a ""real"" dancer who can convey the steps and practice all in one DVD.  Shawn Trautman is a great instructor and coach for a variety of line dances.  In addition to wanting to learn more line dances, practicing with this particular DVD has made me want to own all of his dance videos.

2439389,4,B000BRQWTA,I have enjoyed learning the steps on this DVD. It is easy to follow and now hope to get the hubby out of the chair to try it as well.,1280016000,,133,3.466666666666667
2439390,5,B000BRQWTA,"I ALWAYS WANTED TO LEARN DIFFERENT LINE DANCES. THIS TAKES YOU THROUGH THE STEPS AND IS VERY EASY TO UNDERSTAND AND FOLLOW ALONG. A GREAT PURCHASE WITH GREAT SERVICE!!!!!  I'M DANCIN""!!",1271116800,4,185,4.967741935483871
2439391,5,B000BRQWTA,"I bought this video for my 83 yr. old mother who just started line dancing at the Senior Center.  I was quite excited to do the video with her and I was impressed with the instruction and the review.  I liked that Shawn turned his back to the camera so we could follow him like he was in the room with us.  I don't know if my mother will continue line dancing, but I know I will!",1266883200,3,379,3.896103896103896
2439392,5,B000BRQWTA,"Shawn is a great dance instructor. I have problems with direction such as left, right. I go right when I'm supposed to go left. With this DVD, I don't have that problem and he shows you the dance steps from the front, the back, the side. Even the dances that seem difficult are easy to learn.",1265328000,4,292,4.232142857142857
2439393,1,B000BRQWTA,"Majority of dance teachings present without music. Very boring. The songs listed are not the actual songs, most sound like remakes. Would not recommend.",1249948800,5,152,5.375
2439394,4,B000BRQWTA,The person I got this for loved it.  She has been wanting to learn the electric slide for a while now and now she has mastered it!,1234569600,3,130,3.814814814814815
2439395,5,B000BRQWTA,"I just completed this video and Essential Line Dances Volume 1 and really liked it. It moves faster than Line Dance 101 and this time I was ready for it. Shawn is such a great instructor and I highly recommend him. The only thing I wish was different is the music; I wish it was to the actual songs, but i understand why he didn't use them (still wish they were different though).",1221091200,,380,4.219178082191781
2439396,5,B000BRQWTA,My husband and I are using the video and having a lot of fun! I would recommend it to anyone!,1220140800,2,93,3.7
2439397,5,B000BRQWTA,I liked that the instruction was a little faster in this one than in Line Dance 101 and that some different variations of the dances were given. It may have been too fast if I hadn't seen Shawn's 101 DVD first. I liked the music but agree with other reviewers that it could be improved.,1210118400,3,286,4.218181818181818
2439398,1,B000BRQWTA,We bought this for exercise purposes because we have minimal line dance experience and with a little instruction we thought we could get both instruction and exercise.  Wrong.  We got the instruction in a painfully slow format and very little music for exercise.  Would not recommend unless you have never seen a line dance.,1209168000,4,324,4.962962962962963
2439399,3,B000BRQWTA,"Very thorough basic step instruction, but no party action.  If you want the arm movements and line dance moves with good country music, you might need another DVD.  With knowledge of footwork, I can now follow the music but do not look or feel like a line dancer.",1208822400,3,263,4.458333333333333
2439400,5,B000BRQWTA,"Thanks again, Shawn! After I received this one even my husband has gotten interested. He may even take me line dancing before neither of us can dance.

Our children are really impressed with how fast and how much we are doing.

Easy! Fun! Great exercise without great exertion!

Threw away the other CD's from other instructors. Shawn rules!!!

2439401,5,B000BRQWTA,"This dvd is wonderful and easy to follow.  It is very easy to learn because the steps are repeated and shown at different angles. I watched the electric slide portion and learned it very quickly.  I have been to weddings where people are doing these dances, but never had anyone to show me how to do them--this is the perfect solution.  I only wish he had actually played the electric slide song, instead of an alternate one. It's great!",1184198400,7,437,4.506329113924051
2439402,4,B000BRQWTA,Shawn Trautman is great in this instructional DVD.  His instruction was easy to follow and a lot of fun.  I recommend this DVD to anybody wanting to learn basic line dancing.,1180656000,7,174,4.580645161290323
2439403,5,B000BRQWTA,"Shawn Trautman has done a great job of breaking the dances on this dvd down into easily remembered bite-sized chunks that don't overwhelm a person and that's quite a feat considering the sheer number of dances covered on this dvd. You definitely get your money's worth. The camera angles work well and Shawn's instruction is low key and patient without being boring.

Of course, the best part for me personally is that you can always watch the dvd again and again if that's what it takes for you to ""get"" a certain part of the dance and nobody's going to get worn out or impatient with you.

So if you've longed to get up and join in the fun when people start dancing, but haven't because you think you're too much of a klutz this is a perfect place to start. Most highly recommended.

Btw, my fiancee and I also own the Slow Dance dvd (for my upcoming nuptials) and we both absolutely loved it as well.",1180051200,8,903,4.395209580838324
2439404,5,B000BRQWTA,"My last experience with line dancing was a disaster, so I'm glad I followed through with this one. It was very easy to follow along with and I liked the fact that it wasn't overdone. I could see the instructor's feet as well as his body, and the steps were easy to follow with some good variations to throw in to make it more interesting. This is not an aerobics DVD, but if you want to learn how to do the dances to go out and get and have fun line dancing this is a really good one to learn from.",1179619200,12,498,3.9405940594059405
2439405,5,B000BRQWTA,I am very pleased with Shawn's DVD. He breaks the steps down into manageable parts. I also like the steps shown from the different angles. This DVD is a must for all beginners.,1178236800,12,176,4.363636363636363
2439406,5,B000BRQWTA,"I was very pleased with this purchase as well. The way Shawn teaches is much easier to learn from than any line dance instructor I've taken from in the last couple of months since I started. The dances are taught a little faster than Line Dance 101 and adds several useful steps as alternates. These are still some pretty easy dances, but they're good to know. Highly recommend.",1178150400,13,378,4.573529411764706
2439407,4,B000BRQWTA,Shawn Trautman's instructional dance video was extremely helpful.  I recently became a Country Western Line Dancing addict and have thoroughly enjoyed learning some of the most popular line dances.  My favorite dance on this particular video is Slappin' Leather.  Shawn is a great teacher and makes it easy for anyone to learn!  He also shows how to adapt different styles and moves to standard line dances.  I have tested out the new dance moves I've learned and have had a blast dancing with friends.  I'm a sucker for choreographed dance moves and it's sooo much fun to learn line dances.  This is a great video for beginners and pros - I would highly recommend this video to anyone wanting to learn any type of dance.  Enjoy!,1171584000,15,729,4.73015873015873
2439408,5,B000BRQWTA,"I just recently purchased Shawns Line Dance DVD in search of some country steps to create an easy choreography for a group I am working with.  The DVD was very easy to follow by showing the feet clearly, repeating steps often, and broken down into small segments to learn.  It is a great DVD for those who are beginning dancers yet he throws in some challenging variations for those more advanced. These are basic line dances done by all!!! Thanks Shawn for a great support DVD",1170806400,13,477,4.534883720930233
2439409,5,B000BRQWTA,"This is a great DVD.  I bought it for my son, who has Special Needs.  He attends a lot of dances and is always on the dance floor, but has never been able to figure out how to do the Electric Slide or Macarena.  Neither my husband nor I knew how to do these dances either.  I played the ""Party Line Dances"" DVD, and asked my son to follow Shawn's instructions.  Pretty soon he was moving along with Shawn, and doing very well.  And by joining a few of our son's practices, my husband and I quickly picked up the dance moves too.  My son now participates fully, and we look forward to line dancing at our own occasions.",1169683200,17,618,4.142857142857143
2439410,5,B000BRQWTA,"I always manage to get my feet all tangled when I try to do line dancing and I get the timing all wrong. It is almost like a line up of dominos when I get in the dance line so I was determined to figure a few of them out. This DVD was fun to go through and helped me realize that the dances are not really that hard when they are broken down and that I COULD do them.  I am sure that if I had started out this way I would have avoided many awkward moments that I have gotten myself into. As such, I definitely recommend this DVD.",1168387200,9,529,3.765765765765766
2439411,5,B000BRQWTA,"This was a great video. In the past, I had bought some videos from other sources and also checked a bunch out from the library and most were not very good. They were out of date or did not have the kind of dancing we do around here. But Shawn's dance DVD was very up to date. It has the type of dancing that we often do  in my location (Florida) and at the LDS church dances I attend.",1166400000,13,384,3.8607594936708862
2439412,5,B000BRQWTA,Hey if you are going to a wedding this is a must.  Don't just sit there when the line dances are played just because you didn't bring a date or your date doesn't dance.  You can join in on the fun as a single with Line Dances.  When you get out on the dance floor you will already know how to do the dances and not look like a fool.  Recommend that you buy this!,1165795200,25,362,3.7866666666666666
8091621,1,B000BRQWTA,DVD is boring to me and for the price I am concerning returning it. I can somewhat understand instructions being boring but it would have been nice to see the dances done to the music that this dances are usually done to.

8091625,1,B000BRQWTA,"I thought this DVD was terrible and returned it. I bought it as a Birthday gift for a 13 year old girl. The DVD case itself is thin and cheep looking. The dance instruction is literally one guy, standing in a quite room showing dance moves over and over. I thought at the end of the lesson there would be a group dance to the actual song but nope...just him performing to some knock off wordless version of the song. The Macarina dance ended with a completely different version of some classical country. No Macarina song at all! This video sucked the fun right out of dance. I'd give it a zero star if I could.",1477180800,,611,4.275862068965517
