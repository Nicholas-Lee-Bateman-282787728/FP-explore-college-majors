7752208,5,B01FZ8I7R4,"The DVD is a burnt copy of the Japanese version of ""Godzilla"" with English subtitles. The American dub isn't a part of this DVD, but that is all right seeing that the Japanese version is superior. Granted, if you hate subtitles, you may not want to consider buying.

Some people have complained about the transfer. Really, I think it's fabulous! It's as good as you're going to find when you purchase any other DVD. The disc is really nice in that it's decorated professionally and not with some cheap sticker. There are no menus so the film starts up right away. At the end there is a nice making-of featurette which is really nice!

All in all, this is a great buy considering we still don't have the American version available to us in the States. I would really suggest picking this one up!",1331251200,16,794,4.506944444444445
7752209,5,B01FZ8I7R4,"I have this movie on dvd but it's the american film. This film is great for special effects,music,and story aswell as the monster suit.

  Story: A fishing boat caught during a storm goes near an active volcano which explodes and the crew hears a monster roar? After the storm a news reporter finds the vessel and find most of the crew kiled by a giant mutated sea lice the reporter finds the last surviving crew member he returns to japan to confirm the monster which turns out to be godzilla after he destorys a Russian Nuclear Submarine. Godzilla then appears and attacks a nuclear power plant and goes back to the ocean. Godzilla then heads for tokyo and destroys the millitary tried to kill him with tanks, planes, bullets,and bombs. Godzilla then gets attacked by a new weapon called the Super X which knocks godzilla down only for Japan to find out that A russian satalite launched a nuclear missile from space which was launched from a soviet ship in Tokyo bay when godzilla destoryed it. they counter it by the U.S. Nuclear missle both blowing up in space over tokyowhich everything suffers EMP from the blast resulting in Godzilla's revival then Godzilla attacks the Super X turning it into scrap and turning tokyo into a ghost town with Godzilla leaving and heading back to MT Mihara resulting in Godzilla getting burried into the Volcano. Otherwise great movie lots of effects.  I give this film 10/10 rating",1329350400,3,1420,4.7368421052631575

""After seeing the Raymond Burr/Dr. Pepper Version, I thought this film would be superior to that and boy was I right. When I watched this film it instanly became one of my favorite Godzilla movies of all time.""

7752211,5,B01FZ8I7R4,"Overall i think The Return of Godzilla is a pretty good movie but Toho needs to stop using scenes from previous movies in future Godzilla movies.  Because the rehashing of scenes just gets old after a while seeing the same scene from a previous Godzilla film.

I did enjoy the film that was received, but for anyone looking for a package that includes both versions of the film be advised this is not it.

I felt a sense of terror and dread as Godzilla attacked Japan that I've never felt before while watching a Godzilla film (including the new ones). Hats off to the director who is clearly a genius. The plot is also exceptional. I highly recommend this one.,1517184000,2,423,4.367088607594937

7752248,4,B01FZ8I7R4,An important note for anyone who saw the limited theatrical release or rented the video cassette version is that this does NOT INCLUDE THE NEW WORLD DUB of the film which was called Godzilla 1985 (85 was American release year). So no Raymond Burr. No  American actors in Military uniforms. No Dr. Pepper machines. I'm still glad I bought it but the editing in the American Version definitely was better and cut some unnecessary stuff out. The music was way more on point in the New World release version. I'm telling you look at VHS version and tell me you don't agree specifically the scene where the lasers are firing with Godzilla in middle then the eerie piano music followed by him roaring. relive,1511913600,2,702,4.661290322580645

This movie from 1984 ignores the past ""kid friendly"" Godzilla movies where the monster is a ""hero"" fighting other monsters and harkens back to the original movie.

7752268,4,B01FZ8I7R4,"Koji Hashimoto's ""The Return of Godzilla"" (1984) rebooted the Toho franchise, beginning the Heisei period, which lasted from 1984 to 1995. The story follows Hiroshi Okumura, who survives Godzilla's attack on a ship, his sister Naoko, his teacher, Professor Hayashida, and reporter Goro Maki as they attempt to discover what motivates Godzilla and how they can use that to trap him in a volcano. Along the way, the Prime Minister faces pressure from Soviet and American diplomats to use nuclear weapons to combat the monster. He refuses, but the Soviets had brought a missile just in case. The Japan Air Self-Defense Force uses their new Super X weapon (a flying weapons platform) to attack Godzilla and has moderate success, but the Soviet missile accidentally launches. The Americans launch a missile and destroy it, but the ensuing EMP revives Godzilla and disables Super X. In the end, Professor Hayashida's plan proves successful.
The film serves as a direct sequel to the original 1954 Gojira and ignores the subsequent Shwa period of films (19541975). Viewers need only watch the original to understand the plot of ""Return of Godzilla,"" but this film provides enough background and is relatively self-contained so it may be viewed on its own. While the original Gojira served as an allegory for nuclear power, ""Return of Godzilla"" amplifies this message to a level befitting the heightened Cold War tensions of the mid-1980s. In this, it resembles the original Godzilla sequel, 1955's ""Godzilla Raids Again."" As both serve as direct sequels to the original, there are a few comparisons beyond the message. In the earlier film, Godzilla returns after being encapsulated in ice, while here he was freed by a volcano. Both had their anti-nuclear messages heavily edited when they premiered in the U.S. And both show the triumph of scientists over the military.
This DVD includes both the original Japanese film with English subtitles and the English dub. The default setting is the English dub, which is rather jarring, especially when the Japanese actors' voices are replaced with Midwestern American accents. Make sure you adjust the audio settings prior to watching it.",1502928000,5,2175,5.164305949008498

7752273,5,B01FZ8I7R4,"When I saw this in movie theaters in the US as GODZILLA 1985, I thought it was an entertaining, if sluggish in the middle, movie - and I thought, ""Oh, Cool! The Japanese know most of the West knows the original GODZILLA as being the edit with popular Big Guy Television Star Raymond Burr (PERRY MASON, IRONSIDE) splicedin, so they hired Burr to shoot some scenes for this one, too!"" Turns out I was so wrong on that - the US version only has Burr in it.

With that said, the Japanese original version is a much richer, more powerful, and more consistently watchable movie. There's no sluggish stuff here, and everything that seemed weird in the US version makes perfect sense - because they didn't cut out necessary character and story development to add Raymond Burr staring at projection screens of Godzilla in action and saying oracular things.

I got the Blu-Ray on Amazon for less than $6 - and if you like Godzilla at all, I recommend this version highly.",1501113600,2,961,4.5813953488372094

Enough of that backstory.  This movie was... okay.  What hurts the movie for me is the pacing of it, as it feels more sluggish than usual.  Especially the end of the second act and into the beginning of the third, I nearly fell asleep, which is peculiar for a kaiju film.

What I really appreciate, and I'm not sure if it's intentional, is how once again, Japan is not only at the mercy of Godzilla, but American and Russian politics, as both nations are quick to not only want to intervene, but take over the operations.  Kind of reminds me of the events leading up to the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings- America rushing in to defeat Japan and demonstrate their power to their ""allies"", rather than actually wanting to end the war.  The anti-nuclear message is a good staple in the films and I'm happy to see it return.

Happy I own it, but not sure I'd watch it more than a second or third time.  Not without a group of friends and some alcohol to make the dragging parts tolerable again.",1493164800,,1252,4.404347826086957

The sea lice the audience meets at the beginning of the film are disgusting but also rather funny.  The movie's depiction of the American and Soviet envoys is almost a casus belli.  Godzilla's role is a bit longer than a cameo but no more than a minor supporting part.  The audience gets to study his teeth more closely than in most Godzilla movies--I'm not sure why.  The audience also gets to see lots more of his feet, but they aren't especially ""realistic.""  One also wonders how something 80 meters tall and not svelt enough to be a gymnast could sneak up on a nuclear installation.

7752309,5,B01FZ8I7R4,"I'm just overjoyed that we here in the west can finally get this movie on Blu-Ray. It's been held up in legalities and rights issues for decades. I think the last US release was VHS. Even better, we actually get both the Japanese version (very good) and the somewhat changed American version (unintentionally hilarious in all the wrong ways.)

The Return of Godzilla/Godzilla 1985 was the first reset of the Godzilla movies. After a decade of no new movies it was a direct sequel to the original 1954 Gojira, and ignored all of the ""Showa"" era movies. It returned Godzilla to being a dark destructive force of nature, instead of the goofy children's hero he had become. The movie also has some great Cold War themes and plots. Well the Japanese one does. The American one is more Dr. Strangelove by way of a Dr. Pepper commercial (so wish I was joking.) The effects work was outstanding for the time and holds up extremely well. While far from the best of the ""Heisei"" era Godzilla films, it was a decent start.

If you do get this, I strongly recomend the original Japanese version. The American rework seems custom designed for MST3K.",1491523200,6,1136,4.646766169154229

7752311,4,B01FZ8I7R4,"Finally, after all these years, one of the best Godzilla films has made it to the high definition format! This release, while short on special features, presents a great transfer of the original, uncut version of the film. The film itself is a return to the series darker, somber side with a fairly well integrated human story line for a Godzilla film. This film features no other monster for Godzilla to fight with only the Japanese government with the help of the scientific community trying to curb Godzilla's path of destruction. Featuring great model work, a great suit and some decent animatronics, the special effects deliver. The score is also a highlight with a great opening credits overture and a poignant requiem for the films final moments. Finally, while far from great, it would have been fun for Kraken to have included the American, Raymond Burr cut. But all things considered, I'm just grateful for what we got here in the States!",1491436800,4,948,4.8580246913580245
7752312,5,B01FZ8I7R4,"So in 1984, Return of Godzilla hit the stage. It is a very good film for its time. It struggled with many themes some that carried over into the recent Godzilla movie, Shin Gojira.
One of those themes being, the americans wanting to launch a nuke at Godzilla which would also hit all of Tokyo. Obviously, if you have seen any of the others after it  you could guess what happened.
Now in the Americanized Version (more like Cold War Version), many of the scenes were changed with scenes of Raymond Burr.

Now the one biggest change they made was when one of the Russian went back to the carrier, he actually was trying to stop the nuke countdown. Just as he was, Godzilla attacked. He still tried to reach for the controls to stop the nuke but the explosion of the ship killed him... That is what happened in the original 1984 movie.

Now Americans with their pettiness back then, they edited it to turn  ""Russian trying to stop the nuke and dies"" into ""Russian launches nuke and dies"".
The reason for that edit was ""Conservatives  Leanings"" and because they wanted to paint Russia in bad light and US in a good light.
Thankfully I would hope we are past those days of pettiness.

Now this version released by Kraken Releasing.
It is the Japanese Version with Subtitles. Toho and Kraken Releasing had a hard time getting the distribution rights to the Japanese Version alone. And its almost impossible to figure out if they can actually sell the Americanized version here.
Now this dvd does have an English track, it it isn't exactly amazing but thats because the english dub track was made for countries that didn't get Americanized Version but instead got the Japanese Uncut.

The movie is worth the money though.
It retackles themes showning Gojira, regarding Nuclear Weapons and such. But it also allows Godzilla to have his own flick. Today he only has 3 flicks where its him vs Humans. (Thats of course if you don't count the terrible American take of godzilla known as Godzilla 1998.)
Back then, he only had one film where it was hin vs Humans. Until this movie was released.

I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes Kaiju movies and never got to see the original Japanese movie, Godzilla 1984.",1491350400,4,2210,4.619897959183674

YAY!!",1490918400,,57,5.444444444444445
7752314,4,B01FZ8I7R4,"Godzilla 1984 ushered in what came to be known in Godzilla fandom as the Heisei series of films, most of which came out in the 1990s (the Heisei era began in 1989 with the ascension of Emperor Akihito to the throne but Godzilla 1984 was connected to the following Godzilla films through 1995s Godzilla Versus Destroyah, all of which took place in the Heisei era, so Godzilla 1984 with its connections to the following films was retroactively included in this era). The previous grouping of films which began with the original Gojira and carried through to 1975s Terror of Mechagodzilla came to be known as the Showa series. The Heisei series was marked by a Godzilla that was no friend to mankind, though neither was he a purposeful enemy. He was a force of raw nuclear power propelled by often animalistic instincts. This is true of Godzilla 1984 whose Godzilla is driven by his need to feed, and his food is nuclear power. He is a plodding menace because he creates swaths of destruction as he travels overland in Japan to nuclear power plants. Hes also a bit grumpy and hes none too concerned about how he is disrupting the lives of the small bugs (the humans) that he steps on until they sting him with military missiles and heat rays from fancy flying vehicles. This smart reboot of the franchise seems to fall into three parts. The first is one that I had forgotten as a reporter finds and explores the creepy sea wreckage of a Japanese fishing vessel and finds the crew dead and scavenged by giant, icky sea lice. This portion of the film turned out to be too intense for my 8-year-old son who has seen a few other Godzilla features. It was truly creepy and filled with a nice amount of scary tension, almost Alien in its presentation. Anyway, the reporter is attacked by the sea lice but saved by the sole injured but living passenger who recognizes that their vessel was attacked by a new Godzilla. As this mystery unfolds over the first act, the second act establishes Godzilla and his threat to Japan as he comes ashore and wreaks destruction and they are helpless to stop him try as they might. There are some very convincing, and some not so convincing, spfx shots herein but on the whole they are pretty good and the Godzilla suit (sometimes animatronic) was both fierce and much more anthropomorphic in his unusually large head and eyes. In the third act of the film the Japanese Self Defense Force unleashes their super weapon, the flying Super X which contains a reflective mirror and cadmium missiles, the one not just deflecting Godzillas atomic breath but redirecting it back at him and the other freezing the beast. The Super X puts up a good fight as it faces off in the heart of Tokyo and Godzilla is nearly finished off after a giant skyscraper is toppled on top of him. There are some real nicely staged fight and effects sequences in this stand-off, especially as Godzilla wades through the city and is dwarfed by the skyscrapers even as his reflection ripples across their glassy windows. What is unfortunately distracting, though, are the air and eyes holes that can be easily and frequently seen in the front of the Godzilla suit at his neckline throughout these scenes.

In the end Godzilla isn't defeated by the military but by the manipulation of his instincts, in this case a scientist has recognized Godzillas sensitivity toward bird calls that act like a beacon for him, and they use this sound to draw him into a volcano where he presumably meets his end. This is a Godzilla movie where the creature himself takes center stage. The human characters help to fill in the story but aside from the shipwreck survivor, his sister, and the reporter the audience has little human contact to care for. There is some political subtext to the movie as Japan is caught between the two nuclear titans of the (then) USSR and the USA. While I don't remember for sure I want to say that the original Japanese release paints the USA in poor favor to some degree though they are still Japans ally. In this release (altered? Im not sure) it is the USSR that is the aggressor that puts Japan in more peril and they use a nuclear missile, against Japans wishes, to try and eradicate Godzilla and it is Americas military intervention (!quite the turn of events there) that staves off another nuclear disaster (Godzilla not included) from striking Japan.

Godzilla 1984 is a much better kaiju film in the Godzilla mythos from what I had remembered. Its well worth a watch, even for a non-Godzilla fan I think. But, as my little kid can attest, the first act of this film may be too frightening for younger viewers.",1490313600,15,4628,4.635809987819732

Raymond Bur plain out seems like he doesn't want to be there. He's like a really forced element they shoehorned in because he was in the First movie. Of course he wasn't, he was edited into it in post, but that's besides the point.

7752357,4,B01FZ8I7R4,I have been always used to the version with Raymond Burr. After seeing this version I still enjoy it but the ending still needs the speech Raymond Burr said in the U.S. version. All in all I still love it.,1483833600,,205,4.15

I got this movie in the mail the day me, my sister, and Dad travelled to go see Shin Godzilla in Auburn , AL. By the way, awesome movie. Scariest looking Godzilla ever. Anyway, Return of Godzilla/Godzilla 1984 does not have Raymond Burr. It is the original International release. That means the English track features voice overs from different voice actors like the ones from Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah, Godzilla and Mothra: The Battle For Earth, Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla ll, etc. Truthfully, I am still used to the Godzilla 1985 voice over tracks. But I was still fangirling when I walked down to the mailbox and found I finally got my movie. For any GOJIRA fan, this is a must have.",1483056000,,806,4.8478260869565215

If the American re-edited 1985 version of this film is the only one you've seen you really owe it to yourself to watch this original Japanese version. I only wish it included the American re-edit if only to make a critical comparison. You can watch this in English or Japanese with subtitles.

7752429,5,B01FZ8I7R4,"I'll be upfront, the five stars is a bit biased, but I think it's an ""earned biased."" Can that be a thing? We're making it a thing. Anyways, dear god how long did we Americans have to wait? No I'm serious, this was the only Godzilla movie to never see an official DVD release in America. This movie was practically released everywhere else but the U.S. Which if you are like me was heart breaking. Godzilla 1984 (Return of Godzilla) was the first Godzilla movie I've seen before getting into the franchise leaving the second movie being the infamous 1998 that everyone hates, but after that I couldn't get enough and started renting Godzilla movies as much as possible. But it was all thanks to the '84 film that I'm at all into the series. So after all these years, was it worth the wait to get the Blu-Ray release? Truth being it would be more worth it if we got this YEARS ago, but technically speaking, yes it was worth the wait with some minor disappointment. Don't worry this movie doesn't disappoint, I'll explain what I mean.

Now assuming if you're like me where you state that this movie too was your first movie of the franchise, more than likely you remember the 1985 American Edit that starred Raymond Burr. I can tell you for a fact that this isn't that version, but it does still contain an English Dub as well as the original Japanese cut with subs. With that being said, you'll not only relive moments in this movie, but you'll get some new experiences as well. However with that said you won't see or hear any of the Raymond Burr moments, which even a hardcore G-Fan would say is slightly disappointing. More specifically never getting to hear the amazing ending speech Burr gives regarding Godzilla. The 85 edit might of had a lot of useless shots that were in no way needed for the movie, but even in an uncut / unaltered movie like this, the speech was not only powerful but fitting.

So I confirm that this won't be the exact same as you witnessed before, does that mean that you should skip it? No because as I said that you not only relive moments, you get some new experiences. Also we waited years for this movie and would probably be a sin to any Godzilla fan to not get it. Anyways, some of the moments you'll experience include more of the chemistry between the reporter and the lead female. You also get more of the discussion between using Nukes on Godzilla between America, Russia, and Japan. In short a lot of the unedited stuff is stuff you probably won't care for in a Godzilla movie, but is better than seeing a random shots of American actors discussing if they should help Japan only for Raymond Burr's character to say ""No."" Which reminds me, some of the edits that were made on Godzilla made him seem a bit of a jerk, well more of an aggressive killing machine I should say. Like when the scientist was testing his machine to lure Godzilla which works only for Godzilla to charge at the building. . . At least that's what happened in the edit. Here Godzilla arrives at the building more on his own, Godzilla never attacks the building holding the main characters. The edit version gave me some nightmares when I was a kid with that scene and in this version, I mean I still remember getting frighten but the impact is not as strong. But when you first see Godzilla, don't matter which version, that always sends chills down my spine.

We waited forever for this movie, and it may not be the edit that we all witnessed years ago but it's still the same movie that got many of us in the franchise. I love this movie even if it doesn't have Raymond Burr in it. If you're a Godzilla fan and have yet to see this movie, get this movie whenever you can. Unless this movie falls into a familiar fate as Son of Godzilla or Godzilla vs. MechaGodzilla in which case I hope does not happen. I'll feel bad if this movie ends up reaching the +$100 price range.",1476748800,11,3887,4.418410041841004

7752435,3,B01FZ8I7R4,"Receiving the original Japanese version of ""Return of Godzilla"" was a real treat for me.
The DVD arrived in great condition.  The audio and video quality were great, like I was watching it the day it was released in 1984 in widescreen format. It was a real treat to finally be able to see the original Japanese language version.  To note, I haven't watched the English dub version included, so I cannot comment on that. Oddly, The only glitch seemed to be the menu screen.  Maybe this was because I was actually watching it on an older tube TV, but the menu screen displayed a little bit wider than the screen, clipping it slightly. I was still able to access all menu options, but it was on odd blemish on an otherwise flawless presentation.  Also, there doesn't seem to be a lot in the way of extras, just some of the original trailers.  But it was enough of a treat to be able to see the original Japanese version as it was intended.
As for the film itself, it was a joy to finally see it unedited.  The film didn't have quite the impact I was hoping for, but the production value made it worth the viewing experience.  Toho (the film company responsible for the Godzilla films) stepped up the special effects for this film after the backslide in production value from some of the previous Godzilla films.  The miniatures, explosions, matting, and lighting effects all look fantastic.  Though admittedly I didn't always like Godzilla's fire breathe, as it seemed they were going for the original ""mist"" or ""spray"" look used in the original 1954 film. Also it seemed to ""curve"" oddly at some points.
But that's what this film was clearly meant as: a throwback to the grimness of the original 1954.  Gone are wacky aliens, goofy science fiction gadgets, and Godzilla's status as a hero.  In this film Godzilla is once again portrayed as the horror of nuclear war.  This is a very grounded, realistic film that expresses concerns over the Cold War politics of the mid 80's.  Though admittedly this film doesn't quite match the masterpiece level of the original, it was still very interesting to watch.
I didn't find the human cast very interesting.  All the actors performed well, as I believed they were facing a radioactive monster, but the plot doesn't really give them anything to do besides combat Godzilla.
But, in closing I highly recommend this to Godzilla fans who want to see the original Japanese version of ""Return of Godzilla"" which as been unavailable in the United States until now.",1476576000,,2497,4.684210526315789

The plot takes place after the first movie and Godzilla is still in a snit.  This is not the cutesy anthropomorphic Godzilla that began to crop up in some of the other incarnations.  This Godzilla is a stomper.  When people run and scream they have good reason.  It was a pleasure to see him wreck havoc.
For this movie they returned to the theme of nuclear weapons and their misuse.  The Soviets are in full rage and want revenge for a sub that was destroyed in the Pacific by Godzilla.  Naturally, they want to kill Godzilla with a nuke.  Instead, Super X is employed using cadmium shells to blast the poor misunderstood lizard.

There are only a couple of times where I missed the the '85 version and those were only in relation to Godzilla being a badass and taking out the Super X. In truth how they show it in this version is still better but I got more of a feeling that Godzilla was opening a can of atomic whoopass in the '85 version. Besides, who doesn't like Doctor Pepper?  ;-D

Seeing this for the first time in 2016 I think this would be an outstanding movie now if the SFX were updated to current standards. I always liked the Godzilla (Cybot?) robot over the suit used in this movie since it had a overall better look. However, one thing I, perhaps just became accustomed to, I really like the practical effect explosions. Who knows if they are realistic or not but I enjoy the half realistic/half pyrotechnic explosions of the pre CGI Godzilla films.

The story is that it has been 30 years since the first Godzilla attack - thus all the movies between 1954 and 1984 did no happen.  Japan knows what they are facing and are not willing to let the USSR and USA dictate to them.  The super powers want to nuke Godzilla, but Japan says no.  Japan does have a new weapon to use against Godzilla.  Now this is a 1984 movie and the use of models and rubber suit is the movie magic.

I knew from the beginning that I was buying the original Japanese version of the film with English subtitles and dubbing, but the fact that they couldn't hire the same voice actors from the previous American version really makes this score plummet. The voice acting in the new dub is sub par to say the least. The sound effects are quiet and unimpressive, the characters speak in low monotonic voices and there is little personality shared between any of the characters. I didn't get any sense of comraderie or suspense, and many times the voice actors seemed to lose the plot completely. Also even some scenes with American actors were completely redubbed with different voices which hardly makes any sense at all. When it comes to repackaging a foreign film for western audiences, an English dub can make or break the quality of the film depending on the talents of the voice actors.

7752469,4,B01FZ8I7R4,"A great movie finally brought to blu-ray and DVD and its well worth the wait, if you have not bought this and your a Godzilla fan, well get to it!
That said I will be saying some things that many may not agree with.

First off the sub is fine and the actors did well enough given the martial and what they were doing, the dub however, to me is inferior to the original. The dubbers sound wooden and really don't put much into their roles as the original release did and the lack of Raymond Burr is really felt. though more on that in a sec.

The only real flaw with this to me, beside the goofy shots of Godzilla in some parts, is the shot that really do nothing for the film and seem to serve to pad out the film. AKA the pointless detail shots that really don't add to the film.

As for what I mean by Raymond Burr, the character he plays is Steve Martian in original American dub of Godzilla and reprises his role for the original release Godzilla 1985 release, and while i will agree the most of my fellow reviews that the additions in the 1985 release were not truly needed, Raymond was. As his character, Mr. Martian as he is called in the original 1985 film and how will be referring to him from now on, was a survivor of the original attack and though out his scenes offers a different prescription then all the other characters. This really come into play with what most fans, myself included, remember about this movie, the ending monologue.

All the characters from all sides see Godzilla as a threat, as an enemy to kill or defeat, Mr. Martian see him in a different light, as a creature of mans hubris, a creature of great power. a creature to respect and pity, a creature of nature. And nature has a way sometimes of reminding Man of just how small he is. She occasionally throws up terrible offspring's of our pride and carelessness to remind us of how puny we really are in the face of a tornado, an earthquake, or a Godzilla. The reckless ambitions of Man are often dwarfed by their dangerous consequences. For now, Godzilla - that strangely innocent and tragic monster - has gone to earth. Whether he returns or not, or is never again seen by human eyes, the things he has taught us...remain.",1474502400,,2210,4.343825665859564

I would have given it less but hey, Godzilla is in it and they let him keep his roar from the original Godzilla, which curdles the blood with fear and dread. I understood that it was the Japanese release version, without Raymond Burr, pretty much like the original Gojira of 1954. Nope. It was not like the original at all, or at least what I expected from it. I guess watching my DVD of Gojira beforehand in preparation for this one pretty much killed it. Gojira is in Japanese with English subtitles and really goes into depth in portraying the horror of the natural, mixed with man-made, disaster called Gojira. The Return of Godzilla is overdubbed in English, like the old Kung Fu movies. Not only was I annoyed by the overdone grunts and gasps (who voices these things???) but several characters in the film referring to the monster as ""Godziller"" was really getting on my nerves. The direction was lame compared to 'Gojira' as a few members of the screaming crowds can be seen smiling. Plus it was hard to swallow that the military would lower a civilian from a helicopter to rescue people from the window of a tall building.  Although Gojira stood very well on it's own without the Raymond Burr character (Steve Martin), The Return of Godzilla really could have used him, but fortunately he appears in Godzilla 1984. Actually the trailer included was more effective and thrilling than the actual movie. I just wish the Americanized version with Raymond Burr was included.

7752482,3,B01FZ8I7R4,"BOTTOM LINE: This Godzilla movie is a sort of holy grail among the G-faithful, since the ""international"" version of this particular film has never been legally available in the States. While it's interesting to see the original uncut version of the film, it's still a ho-hum affair. Godzilla himself doesn't get to do a whole lot of rampaging beyond his singular Tokyo Bay entrance and his stroll into Shinjuku. Fans like myself will want it for sure, but the disappointing lack of extras and the shockingly mediocre quality of the supposed ""hi-def"" transfer left a foul taste in my mouth. 3 STAR movie, 2 STAR Blu-ray (YMMV)

THE STORY: A volcanic eruption awakens Godzilla from his undersea slumber and he rumbles forth to menace Japan once again. Lots of stuffy Japanese government officials wring their hands, frown and worry aloud while a soapy quadrangle involving the lone survivor of a freighter that Godzilla attacked, the man's sister, a headstrong reporter and a moody ""bioscientist"" keep the pot boiling away, hogging most of the film's 103 minute runtime. After a few brief military VS Big-G battles, the Charles Bronson-esque looking scientist makes a convenient ""huh?"" discovery, and everything is wrapped up all nice & tidy... at least until the next film in the series, (which was far more interesting and exciting) - 1989's GODZILLA vs. BIOLLANTE.

THOUGHTS: Ignoring all the films that came before it, save the '54 original, this mid-80's update/reboot re-invigorated the long-running film series, but instead of putting the radioactive reptile front & center, it tortures us with a tedious melodramatic romance that pretty much goes nowhere. Poor Godzilla gets shoved to the wayside for most of the film. The generally decent visual F/X work here is more of the same from then in-charge special effects honcho, Teruyoshi Nakano, who gave us the blood-spurting & explosion-filled G-films from the 1970's. The design of Godzilla is a nice change from the cringe-worthy puppydog-eyed superheroic superlizard we endured in the previous few films. The Big G looks suitably menacing and is once again given three prominent rows of dorsal spines. The large (by GODZILLA movie standards) budget allowed the Toho F/X boys to attempt a few interesting things, such as constructing a 15 foot tall, fully animatronic ""cybot"" Godzilla used in several shots, and a full-scale Godzilla foot (which looks exactly like what it is: an uncooperative crane & cable-actuated rubber wrapped prop). The English-language ""International"" version was dubbed by the same listless crew of somnambulistic voice actors who did most (if not all) of the 1970's G-films. Once again we're subjected to monotone script readings instead of engaging, emotional voice acting (except when it isn't appropriate - of course). Those laughably irritating mispronunciations ""Godziller"" and ""Godzilly"" are found scattered throughout the picture, too. *SIGH* (Give me the glory days when AIP coughed up the dough for quality dubbing from the gang at Titra/Titan productions.) Still, the biggest letdown of this release remains the absence of the New World Pictures version - ""GODZILLA 1985"" - which brought Raymond Burr back as beloved United World News reporter, 'Steven Martin.' The full-length Japanese/International version we're given here is sorely lacking without Burr's somber presence and stentorian voice-over narration ...especially during the film's fiery finale. Perhaps some day...

THE BLU-RAY: In a word? Sad. This is a long-awaited ""lost"" entry in the G-cannon that many fans, both hardcore & casual, have been wanting & waiting for years... decades even. I'm sorry to say that the quality of the transfer is a HUGE letdown. The features & benefits of the hi definition format are given no chance to shine with this release; the overall quality looks & sounds like any run of the mill thrift store DVD. Only a handful of shots approach proper razor sharpness. Most are frustratingly soft and the film itself looks scratchy, with the color scheme being muddled and over-saturated. Did the archival crew at Toho NOT do a proper restoration of this film? The quality of the transfer acquired by Kraken Releasing would certainly suggest this; especially when compared to Kraken's excellent Blu-rays for GODZILLA VS. THE SEA MONSTER, GODZILLA VS. GIGAN and GODZILLA VS. HEDORAH. The only bonus feature included for THE RETURN OF GODZILLA / GODZILLA 1984 is the original Japanese trailer for the film, along with Japanese trailers for the aforementioned three G-titles offered in hi-def by Kraken. It's nice to have this on home video, but it could (and should) have been sooo much better.",1474070400,7,4674,5.229333333333333

7752486,5,B01FZ8I7R4,"I was very very excited to receive this disc. Godzilla 1985 was the first Godzilla movie I ever saw, I was about 6 years old at the time and it blew me away. Now some 32 years later I finally get to see the original Non Raymond Burr added, non english dubbed, unedited, and non story altered Japanese original. Most of the movie is unchanged but its really obvious where the story was changed to make it more palatable to American audiences in the mid 80s. And the movie is so much better with the original dialog and english subtitles. While modern Kaiju movies are great with their abundance of CGI there is always something great about a guy in a suit stomping on models and fighting with toys. Practical effects are always going to have a realism that CGI will never match. Although there are a few shots of a giant robot godzilla foot that were kinda laughable and its pretty obvious why those were never tried before, never tried again, and edited from the US release.

The video and audio quality are really good for an old Godzilla movie. I'm thoroughly impressed with this disc. The ONLY thing I would like is for one day the American Godzilla 1985 to be available to watch as well just because it was my first movie. But if I had to choose between the two, I'd take this one any day.",1473984000,27,1293,4.3875
7752487,5,B01FZ8I7R4,"Finally, after years of waiting, this film is available to the Western world on DVD and Blu-Ray.  It's been years since I last had a working VCR and saw this film, and that was the watered down American version.  This is the original uncut Japanese version and it's superior.

After the end of the Showa series of Japanese Godzilla films with 1975's Terror of Mechagodzilla, Godzilla went on a nine year hiatus.  During the Showa series, Godzilla had changed from the original monster who rampaged through Tokyo in 1954 to a family friendly monster who helped the people of Japan.  Well, with this movie, the not so nice monster is back.  This movie kicked off the Heisei series of films, which I consider the best of the Godzilla films.  This is also the first direct sequel to the original 1954 masterpiece since Godzilla Raids Again, a near total reboot of the franchise.  And, it was the first Godzilla film since the original to not feature a monster fight.  Instead, Godzilla fights the Japanese military only.

This movie is a pure masterpiece, almost as good as the original film.  It had the best special effects to date, the miniature work is particularly fantastic.  Godzilla's rampage through Tokyo and his fight with the military and their Super-X plane, which was unfortunately shortened and altered in the original American release, is truly stunning to watch.  The Godzilla suit itself was also getting more realistic looking, with more facial expressions than previous versions had, though the later Heisei series films would feature an even more realistic looking Godzilla.

The only minor drawback to this film is the subtitles.  The print that was given to the company that released this has Japanese text on the screen in some places, much as the already released Godzilla VS Biollante does.  While this isn't a problem itself, some of it has the English subtitles overlaying the Japanese. (identifying characters or places, translation of Russian signs, etc.)  The problem with this is that the Japanese subtitles and the English ones are both white, making the text hard to read in spots.  While this didn't ruin my enjoyment of the film, it could have been done better.

All said, this is a masterful film and a terrific release.  It's a must own for all English speaking Godzilla fans.",1473984000,3,2310,4.904639175257732
7752488,5,B01FZ8I7R4,"Classic Godzilla that revived the franchise. The new bluray looks great and sounds awesome. Dvd menu music is Goodbye Godzilla, quirky choice but i think it's a nice touch.  A must for true G fans.",1473984000,,197,4.628571428571429

Godzilla plays a bad guy again, and that's how I prefer it. There is also a bit of moral and political tone to it but it doesn't over power the entertainment factor.

The quality of the video is also pretty good. This is the first time I've seen it si I can't comment in the quality compared to other formats.

The only complaint I have is that the bonus features is only a couple of trailers. I would have loved to see a mini documentary ur a making of. I'd even take some concept art or set photos. Over all a good purchase for the price and quality",1473897600,,683,4.12781954887218

7752494,5,B01FZ8I7R4,"Great release of a lost gem. This is the Japanese version, which is much different from the American ""Godzilla 1985"". It is much darker in tone and lacks the Raymomd Burr scenes (for better or for worse). One of the interesting differences is how the role of the Russians has changed (in the American version, the Russians are the bad guys, intent on shooting nukes at the Big G...not so in the original cut).

I had the Japanese version on bootleg and was stoked to see this release. My only lament is that I feel it should have had the Americam version included. It would have been a cool little bonus and let Godzilla nerds like myself do side-by-side comparisons.

Great transfer, good sound. I like that the dub uses voice actors that are familiar if you're a fan of old school Kung fu flicks.  At some points, I was waiting for an actor to utter, ""You bastard! You murdered my master! Prepare to die!"".",1473811200,2,908,4.490909090909091

7752496,4,B01FZ8I7R4,"First, this IS NOT Godzilla 1985. That movie (which includes Raymond Burr) has still not been released in the US. Don't be confused. This is the Japanese cut of Return of Godzilla.

This release does include an English dub and the original Japanese with English subtitles as audio options.
Japanese intertitles are superimposed with English translations. This is a first I've seen.

With that said, the quality of the video transfer is great, but not fantastic. Details are a little murky for a Blu-Ray. No specifics were available about how the transfer was made, but it's not too many steps above DVD quality.

As for a review of the movie itself...well, I'll just quote the review from my blog: ""[This movie] cannot be described even as a decent Godzilla film. The human story is not nearly as compelling as the 1954 original that it hopes to emulate (with a scientist hoping to find a way to rid Japan of Godzilla and a bit of political drama between the US and Russia with Japan in the middle). And the Giant Monster action, coming after so many films where Godzilla has some other Giant Monster to battle, is relegated to the King of Monsters stomping on a few parked cars, destroying buildings, and picking up a commuter train as the Super X does its best to drive him away. This film simply doesn't have the emotional resonance or the historical weight of 1954's Godzilla to carry it.",1473811200,,1392,4.673469387755102

Yes...even the obnoxious Travis Swords character, believe it or not. I wish they would of included the U.S ""Godzilla 1985"" version, but oh well.

7752501,4,B01FZ8I7R4,"Now, as a big Godzilla fan myself, I can't begin to tell you how amazing it is to finally see this legendary movie get an official US blu ray release, let alone a dvd one. I had previously seen this movie in both its 1984 Japanese and 1985 American versions via a bootleg with VHS quality.
Ever since seeing the scenes of this movie in the Godzilla vs Biollante bluray, I have been waiting for this sort of release. I am extremely impressed with the sound quality of this release, and the picture quality, while nothing too spectacular, is leaps and bound better than the bootlegs I watched.
The one major issue I have with this release that keeps it from 5 stars is the fact that the original American version is not included. While the American version is heavily edited, cutting out about 20 minutes, it also starred Raymond Burr reprising his role as Steve Martin (No, not THAT Steve Martin), from the original American version of Gojira. He gave a spectacular performance, and was easily the best thing about the American version of Godzilla 1984.
That being said, however, the Japanese version is still a fantastic Godzilla film, and if you're a fan like me, you should definatly pick this one up if you haven't already.",1473811200,,1226,4.628440366972477

What you get is the Japanese audio with English subtitles and An English dub different from the Raymond Burr version with no subtitles. Once you've made your choice for audio selection you're stuck with it. You CANNOT change language audio in midstream.

The English dub is actually more of a curiosity than usual, being not the 1985 dub/cut with Raymond Burr but a lesser (but adequate) international dub of the original Japanese cut of the film. The 1985 Americanized version is not on this disc unfortunately, due to rights issues. I would be happy to support that if it ever gets cleared for a Blu-ray.

Video and audio quality are good, though not possessed of the clarity of some other offerings from Kraken releasing such as Hedorah. Overall, a basic package but nice to have this always-entertaining entry in the franchise on blu-ray.",1472601600,,716,4.821138211382114
7752508,4,B01FZ8I7R4,"The picture quality on the blu-ray is pretty good, bearing in mind it's a 30+-year-old film that was not shot digitally nor in high definition. The English language dub adheres to the original Japanese script and thus comes off sounding more intelligent than the dub for ""Godzilla 1985."" Even the Russian dialogue is dubbed into English. By selecting English 1 subtitles, the viewer sees translations for all Japanese writing, even that on the sides of various vehicles. It even shows both the Japanese lyrics to the music playing on Maki's sailboat along with an English translation! All-in-all a very good product from Kraken Releasing. The lack of a fifth star is due entirely to the lack of special features, which is limited to only a Japanese theatrical trailer with English subtitles for both dialogue and captioning.",1472428800,,824,5.0661764705882355

At the power plant, a security guard comes to see what was stomping but he's startled seeing a huge green taloned foot stomps down before him cracking open the pavement. He's suddenly terrified looking up at who's standing in front of him, looking further up, it's Godzilla bearing down at the guard, he screams his iconic roar at him. Now for the first time, a U.S. release of Return of Godzilla by Kraken Release with Godzilla 1984 is a kaiju 90s treat for for G-fans. I hope Kraken will include the end credits for Return than Classic Media's fade to white editing. Looking forward to this. With a rehash version of Godzilla 54 in Resurgence coming soon, I already have SH Monsterarts Spit Fire Godzilla 2014 figure added to my Big G collection. My Godzilla has no bounds.

Love the director's cut from Return of Godzilla! What a difference it is from scenes that were re-editted and cut to Godzilla 1984 with Raymond Burr reprising one is famous roles as news reporter Martin next to Perry Mason. It's understandable nowadays why Gojira and Return were re-editted due to the politics of WMDs with Raymond's inserted scenes when they are also there as an English interpretation and story extension of the films.

The visual quality is so much better than before! We finally see Big G green as ever with those big close up head shots. Return was made on a big budget $6.25 million. Director Koji Hashimoto wanted the film to be as believable as possible to King Kong's first remake as well as reminding Japanese society about the dangers of nuclear weapons with art of disaster scenes, a large scale Godzilla foot stomping down and a 1/40th scale replicated set of Tokyo for Godzilla's increased height and sized up to high rise buildings.",1472256000,6,1949,4.695906432748538

7752515,5,B01FZ8I7R4,"Most of the peoples reviews here seems to be for the older bootleg version that was available.
I can assure you that the previous Kraken Godzilla releases are good, so this version will probably be as good as Godzilla Vs Gigan and Godzilla Vs  Hedorah for example.
The movie itself is at least for me the best Godzilla movie to date (I haven't seen Shin Gojira yet) but I know that many American fans haven't got the opportunity to see the original version because of the edited Godzilla 85 version.

And the previews Kraken releases of Godzilla Vs GIgan, Hedorah and Ebirah is great for the price so I'm very glad to see that this film is finally being released here as well. I live in Sweden so this movie has always been available for a cheep price, but I will buy this version too and support Kraken, and hopfully we can get more rare Godzilla releases in the future like King Kong Vs Godzilla, Son of Godzilla and Godzilla Vs Spacegodzilla for example.
The only downside of this release is that I think they could have released it with the Godzilla 85 version as a bonus 2nd disc, since I've never seen that movie and have wanted to see it for a while. And on top of that, there are a lot of fans who actually like that version so I think it's a bit strange they didn't included it here.
I would pay a little more to get a double feature!

7752522,3,B01FZ8I7R4,"Let me first clarify that as a longtime Godzilla fan, I'm pleased that this film is finally coming to North American home video in its original version. I'm glad whatever contract was holding it back before finally expired. I wouldn't say this release isn't worth picking up, or shouldn't be coming out. With that said, I do have misgivings about it.

My main problem with this release is that it's Kraken putting it out. Kraken is a budget label aiming at casual retail shoppers; the fact that this Blu-ray release is coming out at $9.99 ought to make that clear enough. Their previous releases of some of the '60s and '70s Godzilla films had excellent quality, yes, but that's thanks to high-quality masters created for Sony's DVD releases of those films in 2004. No such master exists for this film, so it's likely what we're getting is the Japanese HD master used on Toho's Blu-ray, which is decent but hardly a great example of what the Blu-ray format is capable of. We'll get that master, plus an English track and likely a couple of trailers, which is all Kraken's previous releases included in terms of extras.

The obvious omission is Godzilla 1985, the re-edited US version starring Raymond Burr. Among the alterations made by US distributor New World Pictures was the addition of music from Christopher Young's score for Def-Con 4, another New World film. It's these stock cues that prevented the US version from being included in this release - no doubt the royalties would have been easy to sort out, but Kraken couldn't be bothered if it would mean selling the Blu-ray at slightly more than bargain bin prices.

To compensate for the loss of this version, Kraken's copywriters, who had previously used corny taglines and an emphasis on camp to try and sell the earlier films to non-fans, tried to make this release out to be better off without the US version of the film, disparaging Godzilla 1985 with a ""You don't even really wanna see that"" tone while hyping The Return of Godzilla as some sort of epic masterpiece, using dubious implications that the film had been ""censored"" in the American version and outright misleading taglines like ""Lost for a generation"" (The Return of Godzilla has never been a ""lost"" film by any definition of the term). They pass this off as some kind of general consensus on Godzilla 1985, when most fans are actually very interested in seeing that version released (as it's only ever been released on VHS) and are disappointed in its exclusion from this release. While fans scour the internet for a rumored HD recording from a 2006 TV broadcast of Godzilla 1985, Kraken seems to be trying to act like it's beneath them and pass off a rushed, cheap, lazy release of the film as what we've all been waiting for. If Raymond Burr is good enough for the Criterion Collection's release of the original Godzilla, he's good enough for you, Kraken.

What's really unfortunate is that Kraken apparently outbid other companies for the rights to this film, which for all we know could have included someone like Shout! Factory. Shout! is a larger and more established company with more capital and resources at their disposal and a long history of solid-to-excellent releases of niche films, often featuring new and much-improved transfers and newly-produced bonus material. Had they been able to acquire the rights, we might have had new transfers of both versions, some new extras, extras ported over from the Japanese release, not to mention better cover design - as opposed to the amateurish template used for Kraken's Godzilla Blu-rays, Shout! releases frequently feature attractive new cover art that can be reversed to display the original poster art. Kraken beat them out, though, thanks to not planning to spend any money on anything a Shout! release might have included - instead of budgeting for the rights, new transfers, new art and new extras, they could blow their entire budget on the rights and put a negligible amount of effort into everything else.

All in all, The Return of Godzilla is a good film, and I'd rather have this release than none at all. Still, about all I can say for this release is that it exists, because it's pretty mediocre in every other respect.",1468454400,13,4221,4.824585635359116

7752524,5,B01FZ8I7R4,"The original uncut Japanese movie finally getting a legitimate North American Blu-ray and DVD release. I will probably get some heat for saying this, but I'm going to say it anyway. I finally saw this particular movie because I recently purchased it from Sumogorilla.com. I own the original VHS release of Godzilla 1985 put out by New World back in 1985 and Godzilla 1985 was the first time I ever saw a Godzilla movie on the big screen in the summer of 1985 and I was not disappointed. After watching this movie, I now see what people mean when they say that Godzilla 1985 was really ""chopped up"". I get it and I definitely believe that The Return of Godzilla is a far more superior film and a much more complete film. However, I still defend Godzilla 1985 if only for one major reason. That reason is the scenes with Raymond Burr and his closing speech at the end of the movie. For me personally his scenes in both Godzilla King of the Monsters and Godzilla 1985 are relevant and should not simply be dismissed with the passage of time. I will definitely be purchasing this movie on both Blu-ray and DVD when it comes out later this summer, but I would still like to see Godzilla 1985 receive a legitimate Blu-ray and DVD release as well. In closing, I have to give ""mad props"" to Section 23 and its parent company Sentai Filmworks. This company (which I believe is based in Texas) has been doing big things over the past few years in two of my favorite categories in particular, Classic Japanese Anime and Classic Kaiju movies. Some of my favorites are their 2013 release of Gatchaman: The Complete Series on Blu-ray and DVD with the excellent Alex Ross artwork on the packaging, the 2014 releases of 3 Showa Era Godzilla movies in time for the 60th Anniversary that year, and of course The Return of Godzilla coming out this year. I hope this company continues to do their thing and I hope that people who have an appreciation for this kind of entertainment will continue to support their efforts.",1464566400,93,2001,4.545706371191136
7752525,5,B01FZ8I7R4,"This is not the cheesy, bastardized American cut ""Godzilla 1985"" starring Raymond Burr. This is ""The Return of Godzilla"", the original Japanese version of the film that HAS NEVER BEFORE HAD AN OFFICIAL U.S. RELEASE, and contains over 20 extra minutes, a darker more serious tone, and no Raymond Burr. This is is a completely different (better) edit of the movie. Like with the original ""Gojira"" before it, ""Return"" was neutered when it was brought over to the U.S. and recut into a cheesy sci fi movie. They changed the name, added in new scenes with American actors (Burr), added jokes, and stripped it of any political commentary. It took about 50 years for ""Gojira"" to get a U.S. release, and likewise ""Return"" hasn't had an official release here in the 30+ years since its release, giving American audiences the false impression that Godzilla was always a cheesy monster movie intended for kids. If you wanted to see it you had to either get a bootleg (which is what I did) or buy a region free dvd player. Even though I have the bootleg I will be buying this because my copy has big Japanese titles over the screen with no translation, and I want to own an official copy on blu ray. Some of the new scenes you can look forward to include a huge lifesize robotic foot of Godzilla that they built for the movie (completely removed from the U.S. cut) stepping on some cars, akin to how they built a lifesize Kong to use in a few shots in the '76 King Kong.",1464393600,55,1458,4.484962406015038
7752526,5,B01FZ8I7R4,"I loved watching Godzilla growing up and this was probably my favorite out of all of them. This version is in Japanese and subtitled in English, but I love watching movies like that anyways so no big deal to me. This version is different a little bit from Godzilla 1985 which is in English, but i think its better. Honestly to me the American scenes in the English version added nothing. The beginning with this one adds a bit more back store and as others have noted other scenes like the Russian sub have changed. But for me it was all for the better. I highly recommend this movie, as long as subtitles don't bother you",1448582400,,622,4.370689655172414

7752532,5,B01FZ8I7R4,"I was very pleased with DVD and playability. I do not expect to need subtitles, as I can translate or know the English translation.  Beautiful move, what Godzilla is all about!  Special thanks to GMK Toys for curious service, as I cannot leave feedback through normal channels. Product was what I expected and I and more than satisfied",1433203200,,335,4.758620689655173

7752535,5,B01FZ8I7R4,"Godzilla steps back onto the stage, in this installment, and Tokyo is in dire shape from his return.  The Super X is a nice touch, it provides plenty of firepower, to match that of Godzillas.  The action scenes are terrific, the human factor is kept to a minimum.  My version does not have the Raymond Burr cameo, and I did not miss it in the least.  In a Godzilla film there is only one lead actor, and he wears a suit.  A very enjoyable entry in this series, I recommend it to fellow Godzilla fans.  JRV",1425859200,,505,4.208333333333333
7752536,5,B01FZ8I7R4,"I liked ""Godzilla 1985"", but it was lacking in parts, mainly the parts that were filmed specifically for the American version. There is only two things I liked better in the American version - Raymond Burr's speech at the end, and the fact that it's a little faster paced, getting to the action sooner. But the American version also cut out a lot of good scenes, badly re-edited one scene involving a Russian officer and a nuclear missile, and the added American material added little to the story and was generally badly acted with corny dialog. That's why I like this original Japanese edit much better.

This is the original Japanese edit, released in Japan as ""Gojira"", better known in the rest of the world as ""The Return of Godzilla"". It acts as a direct sequel to the original Godzilla film, but it ignores all of the other sequels, rebooting the franchise. And indeed, this often feels more like a remake of the original film than a sequel. And a good sequel/remake it is. The one on Amazon though is sadly overpriced and you only get one version of the film. I went to sumogorilla.com and got it for only $12.99 with free shipping and it included both this original Japanese cut as well as the American ""Godzilla 1985"" cut.

The Plot: It has been thirty years since Godzilla had appeared and devastated Tokyo, but thanks to the help of scientist Dr. Serizawa, humanity prevailed, and Godzilla was destroyed. But now Godzilla is back (maybe resurrected or maybe it's a different Godzilla altogether), but he's back none the less, and with a vengeance! As Godzilla makes his way to Tokyo once again, the battle begins to save all of humanity! Can a new special aircraft, the Super X, outfitted with the latest weaponry, be enough to stop Godzilla's destructive rampage?

It's got good effects, good characters, a good story, and it's action-packed. It would be a shame for any Godzilla fan to miss out on this. Highly Recommended!",1422748800,,1937,4.724852071005917

7752538,4,B01FZ8I7R4,"I consider this dvd a ""place holder"" in my collection, until a proper, re-mastered blu-ray version becomes available. Given this, it is a pleasure to watch the unadulterated Japanese version. It is a much more serious, and heavy handed version than the American one. After viewing this version the film has moved up a couple of notches in my G film ratings. The image quality is ok, but not very good. Acceptable too is the sound. The music sounds clear and rich, but the rest of the audio, especially Godzilla's roar, are distorted and unclear.  But if you are too impatient, as I was, to wait for the blu-ray version, this is the way to go. Enjoy!",1420416000,2,649,4.547008547008547

7752547,4,B01FZ8I7R4,"Godzilla 16 or the rebirth of Godzilla or Godzilla 1985 is probably closer to the original in tone than any other Godzilla film. Godzilla is the enemy, he doesn't fight other giant monsters and Raymond Burr is in it (U.S. version).

Finding this on DVD is somewhat tough. There are several burned versions around and I've had a chance to view a couple of different releases. Sumogorilla sells several Godzilla films that are pretty tough to find. The Return of Godzilla DVD they sell comes as a 2 disc version. One with the Japanese version running 1:43 minutes an U.S. version running 1:27 as you can see by the running time these are very different cuts. The video and sound quality are really quite good. The case has a picture similar to the one listed here, but the discs have no graphics( at least mine don't have any).

Back to the film, this is a good entry in the series even if it seems out of place. Considering this was supposed to be the new improved Godzilla they effects aren't really that much different than the other films. All in all I'm glad I was able to purchase the missing link to my collection until a proper release comes along.",1402272000,6,1154,4.4904761904761905

As with the original ""Godzilla"", the US release had some of the original Japanese content removed and additional footage featuring Raymond Burr spliced in for the US market.

This movie is the complete original Toho film released in 1984 in the Japanese language with English sub-titles.  It contains none of the changes made for the 1985 US release.  The DVD also included a copy of the Japanese trailer for the original ""Godzilla"", a copy of the Japanese trailer for ""The Return of Godzilla"" and a documentary describing the making of ""The Return of Godzilla"".

Now with the exception of that[ SILLY sea Louse TOY thing] and the Gojiru/Godzilla's robotic heads shots In all, the combination of a serious story line and a menacing Godzilla destroying stuff and preety good Japanese actors still makes this my favorite Gojira/Godzilla movie Just love the destruction Gojira/Godzilla in this movie!. Sorry fans of Godzilla 2014. But that movie is still preety good in it's own right. Just not as good as ROG....just my opinion",1346371200,,880,4.98639455782313

The main story is Daikoku Island erupts and don't you just know it to your amazement a new Godzilla appears. As usual the monster heads to Japan for some quick nourishment and its traditional rampage of what ever city it is near. This Godzilla is meaner looking then the past Godzilla of years gone by. At least with the old version you could bring that one home to the folks and maybe go out on a dinner date. Also, this is the first Godzilla movie in nine years. The last Godzilla movie was the Terror of Mechagodzilla which was released in March 15, 1975. The special effects of this movie are great for the era of that time. Finally, this is the first Godzilla movie since the original back in 1954, that the big guy does not do battle with another monster. The Return of Godzilla or Godzilla 1984 gets an AAAA++++.
