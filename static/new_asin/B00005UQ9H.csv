1667783,3,B00005UQ9H,"Even though its called Zombie Holocaust, its really more of a cannibal flick.  It looks like they started making a cannibal flick that centered on this blonde woman who grew up on a cannibal island.  Even though she is known to her friends as a vegetarian/macrobioticist, there are two scenes where she's developed a craving for meat.  Then suddenly, the zombie craze hits Europe and that plot line is dropped.
She goes back to the island of her birth with Ian Mcculloch to get to the bottom of this cannibal mystery in New York, where corpses are being mutilated and fed upon by people who come from the same island.
Then they meet this doctor who tries to misdirect them as to the proper cannibal island, and so far, the movie has been going nearly an hour with nary a zombie in sight.
Eventually, the small party accidentally finds the cannibal island even though the doctor gave them a guide to keep them lost.  After a rough night's sleep, they are beset by cannibals and finally when all but three of our party are eaten alive by the cannibals, the zombies show up and scare the cannibals away.
Then Ian Mcculloch uses an outboard motor to kill a zombie on the beach.  But then we find out the zombies aren't even really zombies, but cannibals who've been operated on by the afore mentioned doctor.
Later the blonde is captured by the cannibals while Ian Mcculloch is captured by the doctor.  The blonde is strapped naked to a sacrificial alter which tilts back, proving her to be the queen of the cannibals while Ian Mcculloch is strapped to an operating table where he's destined to have his brains transplanted into one of the doctor's many corpses in the morning.
Then the blonde brings the cannibals to rescue Ian Mcculloch and the movie ends with the doctor's rather unsanitary operating theater burning to the end credits.",1037232000,,1835,4.648148148148148

It's just as entertaining as it was when watching my...bootleg tape, but now with great picture quality!  FANTASTIC extras!  Good, gory horror.  Love it.  Buy it.

mindless gore, nudity, and shock (i.e. fun fun fun), this is for you! At times we all should turn our brain off and just sit back and enjoy the ride! So many elements here..... Zombies, evil mad doctors, cannibal natives, naked babe, Ian McCoullough, etc. And finally in a restored verson that looks crisp and sharp. From the early 80's when almost anything goes.

Interesting story, however the the title is misleading seeing as how the movie is mainly about a twisted doctor and not about zombies.  All in all a decent movie.  There was enough gore to make me happy.  Bad acting.  Deffinatly a classic horror flick.  GREAT PREVIEWS!

1667787,5,B00005UQ9H,"'Zombie Holocaust' is a true must for any horror, gore or exploitation fan out there. It has zombies, cannibals, a mad scientist, cheesy acting, great gore and a naked chick! What more could you want? There's even a drinking game that's easy as pie: As soon as you see the symbol (and believe me you don't need to look for it. It's given a huge close-up and a 'bing' noise for 'dramatic effect') - take a shot. It happens so many times it's hilarious.
The barmy plot for this has a group sent off to an island to investigate cannibalism from a tribe that have been stealing organs. After being attacked by the cannibals, the cannibals then get scared off by zombies. Then our heroes find out that the zombies are products of a mad scientists Frankenstein-like attempts at creating a supreme race. Zombies and cannibals then fight it out in a battle at the end...
Some footage used is from Fulci's 'Zombi 2' film, which is shameless, but it's only some location footage so it's not too important. And any film that has the line ""I could kill you now... But I'm determined to have your brain!"" said seriously, has got to be good. Don't take my word for it, just click 'Add to Cart' and you won't regret it!!!!",1024790400,3,1207,4.46606334841629
1667788,5,B00005UQ9H,"Well, I doubt anyone is going to put up an actual DVD review for this film, so I'LL do it!
Let me start off by saying that Zombie Holocaust is a pure cheese fest! The Italian cut (which this DVD is) is closer to serious than the infamous ""Dr. Butcher"" cut. This film is worth watching if you're a horror buff, or you just wanna watch something with a group of your buds! Anyway, to the DVD!:
Video: The film is presented in it's full 1.85:1 widescreen ratio (16X9 enhanced even!). Considering the budget of this film, the quality is SPECTACULAR!!! There is slight grain evident a couple of the night scenes, but other than that, the print used is crystal clear. No marks, scratches, nothing! Obviously the source print was a direct NTSC transfer (and not PAL to NTSC) as the color is perfectly balanced and there is no ""motion blurring"". Just perfect and no ""bleeding""...no pun intended...
Video Quality: 10/10
Audio: The audio, however, still has a muffled sound to it. However, it is clearer compared to previous video releases and there is no popping or hissing, so it's probably the best it will be. Also, as a side note, being that this is the UNCUT print, this version contains Nico Fidenco's original (and in my opinion MUCH greater) music score.
Audio Quality: 7/10
Extras: JACKPOT!!! This is where we hit the motherload:
-U.S. ""Doctor Bucther"" Trailer
-German ""Zombies Unter Kannibalen"" Trailer
-Interview with Make-Up effects director Maurizio Trani
-Interview with ""Tales to Tear Your Heart Out"" director Roy Frumkes
-Unfinished footage from ""Tales to Tear Your Heart Out"" with Roy Frumkes audio commentary
-Zombie Holocaust still gallery
-Tales to Tear Your Heart Out still gallery
-Five minute deleted sequence (Peter VS. The Cannibal Duo)
Besides this, there are bonus trailers for ""Beyond the Darkness"", ""Jungle Holocaust"" (A.K.A. ""Last Cannibal World""), ""Eaten Alive"" (The Umberto Lenzi Film), ""and ""Burial Ground"" (A.K.A. ""Nights of Terror""). The deleted scene, unfortunately, isn't in as good of quality as the rest of the film, but still decent looking. Basically, this scene was only in the U.S. and Japanese cuts. The disc, however, was missing the original international trailer, yet it was seen on the Burial Ground DVD! It's pretty much the same as the German trailer anyway, but worth having either way.
Extras Rating: 10/10
As I stated earlier, if you're a horror buff, this is worth the search. There is nearly an hour of additional features especially for this film, which does NOT include the ""bonus trailers"", which would add an extra 13 minutes to it. Forget about that old bootleg video, put away that worn out ""Doctor Butcher"" videotape, go out and get this!
Overall rating: 10/10
P.S.: This version of the film actually uses the opening and ending red credits which were meant for Italian viewers even though this version is in English! However, if you want to see the alternate English opening and ending credits, here's what to do...
1. Head to the Special Features section
2. Click on the ""Special Thanks"" section
3. When you get to the screen, press up. You should have highlighted the name Edwin Samuelson.
4. Click Play or Enter
There you go! It's basically the same as the credits in the film, except they are white and are in proper English. However, for collector's and completists, it's worth a look.",1022716800,3,3344,4.889084507042254

1667790,2,B00005UQ9H,"This attempt to cash in on the success of Lucio Fulci's Zombie (which itself was an attempt to cash in on the success of Dawn of the Dead) turns out to be a very silly and badly directed, but still quite amusing gorefest.  Ian McCulloch is in this one, and he and Alexandra Delli Colli head to some jungle island to investigate a cannibalistic tribe.  The gore is the movie's selling point, and the effects range from surprisingly good to hilariously awful, and the lovely Delli Colli does look quite alluring in the buff (note: she appeared about three years later in The New York Ripper, and somehow looked a dozen years older in that one!)",1020038400,,642,4.525862068965517
1667791,5,B00005UQ9H,"Probably the funniest - and one of the goriest - Italian zombie movies is this weird amalgam of zombies and cannibals.  In fact, the zombies here don't even kill anybody!
They're being created by brain-swap wacko Dr. Obrero (Donald O'Brien, in a priceless trash performance), who has plenty of donors to work on - a whole island full of primitive cannibal tribesmen.
But heroic professor Chandler (Ian McCulloch), hoping to get to the bottom of a body-snatching case, stumbles on Obrero's crazy scheme.  Now he has to fend off mad surgeons, hungry natives and brain-dead zombies!
The really impressive gore FX are sky-high - and include scalpings, eyeball-eating, throat-slashing and a head mashed by propellor - but this only adds to the movie's goofy charm.
ZOMBIE HOLOCAUST has moments of such stupidity that it's impossible to resist.  For example, a suicide victim's body clearly smashes in two when he throws himself from a 20-storey window, but is back in one piece when the camera closes-up on him.  Once O'Brien's medic starts one of his meaningful scientific speeches (""Patient's screams disturbing me - performed removal of vocal chords!""), this becomes Grade-A trash.
But it's so self-serious with its' stupid premise that it becomes inoffensive and genuinely hilarious.
Italian zombie fans will be well in their element, so I recommend this one wholeheartedly!",1008288000,27,1373,5.199095022624435
1667812,3,B00005UQ9H,"A mad scientist who also happens to be part of an island cannibal tribe in New York City as he's taking human body parts from the hospitals and graveyards leaving the police baffled. A group of explorers and researchers alike must try to find this mad lunatic of a scientist on an island, over there the scientist creates Frankenstein-esque experiments of zombies and has his cannibal tribe to do the work for him.

Entertaining Italian made horror action shocker that plays as both a zombie flick and a Cannibal movie but without the animal cruelty like some Italian cannibal movies. Ian McCulloch is a good horror actor as always much like his counterpart in ""Zombie (a.k.a. Zombi 2)"", the story is a little mediocre but the nudity and graphic gore make up for that in this gut-munching and fun zombie flick with memorable moments like a zombie getting his head mutilated by a boat motor and of course some realistic operation sequences that aren't for the squeamish. Think of it as Island of Dr. Moreau with zombies.

This DVD contains decent picture and fine sound with some good extras like Trailers to this and other Shreik Show trailers, Poster and still gallery, talent bios, interview with special effects artist Mauritzo Trani and scenes from ""Tales that will tear your heart out"" that was added to the U.S. cut known as ""Dr. Butcher MD"".

1667816,5,B00005UQ9H,"zombie holocaust is one of the stupidest films you'll ever watch. the plot dosnt make sense, the acting is mediocre and over the top gore is so bizzare, its almost laughable. but, with all that said, this is also one of the coolest, most fun films you'll ever watch. the story has something to do with some lady going into the jungle in search of answers to bizzare cannibalistic acts occuring in new york. the rest of the film consists of the cast being torn to peices by cannibals or opperated on by an insane doctor. right about now your probably asking yourself were the zombies enter the mix, and that is zombie holocausts biggest letdown. although the title promises zombies, the audience is graced with only about 7 minutes of zombie action. well, action might not be the right word because all the zombies do is emerge fom the jungle and look funny in their strange clay makeup. one hopeless zombie almost steals the show when he nearly sneaks up on a couple of humans, but they notice him and evicerate his head with a boat motor. the movie may not deliver much zombie, but it definately delivers on the holocuast factor. the movie is jam packed with dismemberment, intestine ripping, eye gouging, neck slicing, blood spurting gore. this film should apeal to many audiences of the euro sleaze genre including cannibal, zombie and mad scientist enthusiasts. the main thing you have to remember while watching zombie holocuast is not to take it seriously which shouldnt be to hard since the movies so absurd. great movie to watch if youve had a bad day.",1163721600,,1560,4.676363636363637

Well, in this movie the Zombies are only in the movie for maybe 5 mins and do jack. All they do is come out of nowhere and make a gggggg noise that scares the Cannibals away. The movie starts in New York for about 15 mins maybe then the people finally make it to the island that was used in Lucio Fulci's Zombie 2 AKA Zombie, and to make things worse they also take 3 scenes out of Lucio Fulci's Zombie movie when they are on the island in this car driving around through the village. This movie for the most part does have very good gore scenes through out the movie.

1667819,2,B00005UQ9H,"I am watching too many of these Italian movies.  I am starting to recognize the people from other movies and be familiar with the names of actors/music/special effects from other movies.

I really should stop watching them because I really don't like them very much.  I am more interested in gore comedy and these gore movies without the humor of a ""Dead Alive"" or ""Terror Firmer"" tend to bore me.

This movie is more for the straight gore fan.  There is someone stealing body parts in a hospital.  There is a mad doctor taking off skull caps and changing brains.  There is cannibalism.  There is a machete stuck in someone's head for self-defense.

My favorite one was the main character using a boat prop to scramble a zombie's face.  I wish there were more things like this and I might have enjoyed it more.  It was poorly done however.

From what I have heard this is a popular cult favorite for this type of movie however the makers seem to have made it without much inspiration besides making money.

I really enjoy the special features of these types of movies (which I guess is one big reason I continue watching these types of Italian gore movies that I don't really like).  I enjoy the stories behind the movies, etc.

This one had an interview with a special effects person who I recognize from the Zombi 2 bonus features (I think it was from there?).  I am pretty sure the interviews for this and Zombi 2 were done in the same setting.  It seemed to me this was probably done right after the interview for Zombi 2.  In this one he seemed annoyed by repeated questions from the Zombi 2 interview.  His attitude was an annoyed ""As I said before..."" like he didn't realize the previous time was for a different dvd?!

Also he was asked how the special effects were done.  Basically he said he didn't remember that much about them.

He was also asked if he was satisfied with the special effects.  He said he didn't ever see them on film as he has never watched ""Zombi Holocaust"".  ""I guess they turned out ok because I heard it made money"".

This was different from the Zombi 2 interviews (his and others) where they were excited and proud of their work.

I have never seen special interviews where the interviewees are not interested in the movie and telling the story.  It was funny to watch this.",1142294400,,2308,4.485576923076923

But that doesn't stop a whole lot of angry cannibals from running amock. And boy, do they ever. Plenty of gore here.

Acting is alright. Ian McCulloch shines, of course. But whatever. No one really gives a damn about acting in this movies. If they do, well. That's just strange and uncalled for.

1667823,5,B00005UQ9H,"Here we go again with yet another zombie film. How many of these things exist? More than you can possibly imagine. Lucio Fulci's ""Zombie"" and George Romero's Dead Trilogy--plus his latest ""Land of the Dead"" entry--seem to constitute the apogee of the genre. Let's not forget about ""The Return of the Living Dead"" and its two sequels, or Bill Hinzman's derivative ""Flesh Eater."" Then, if you think you're ready for more teeth tearing into shrieking flesh, you can move on to Andrea Bianchi's ""Burial Ground,"" the Fulci/Mattei production ""Zombie 3,"" and Claudio Fragasso's ""After Death."" Oh yeah, Zack Snyder's ""Dawn of the Dead"" remake ought to fall somewhere near the top of this list. I won't even get into the microbudget, shot on video undead crud churned out by distributors like Sub Rosa and Troma. I guess I can conclude that a ton of these films exist, a few of which earn praise as even more of them sink into the deepest pits of banality. I think it's finally time for me to review one film that often falls in the latter category, the 1982 Marino Girolami chunkblower ""Zombie Holocaust,"" sometimes referred to by its cut to ribbons U.S. title ""Dr. Butcher M.D.""

Girolami's film begins with a weirdo sneaking into a morgue in the middle of the night. He's obviously here on serious business since he carries a satchel that contains rubber gloves, a flashlight, and assorted sharp instruments. Our man saws off a hand, puts it in a bag, and promptly leaves. He's obviously been doing this for some time. Then we next see a bunch of giggly medical students standing around watching their professor carve into the very same corpse so ignobly robbed of its extremity in the preceding scene. The doctor dismisses his students after discovering the ghoulish atrocities and brings in an archeologist by the name of Lori Ridgway (Alexandra Delli Colli) and health inspector Peter Chandler (Ian McCulloch) to investigate the grisly thefts. A wisecracking reporter, Susan Kelly (Sherry Buchanan), soon arrives to nose around in the situation as well. Eventually, our heroes discover the man responsible for the organ harvesting, some nondescript native type, but cannot move fast enough to prevent him from jumping out a hospital window and hitting the ground with such force that his arm turns into a mannequin's appendage which promptly shatters. It's noticed with some consternation that a tattoo he has on his chest exactly mirrors an emblem on a dagger stolen from Ridgway's apartment. What's going on here?

It turns out that the dagger came from some island populated by cannibals, and it's not long at all after this realization that Chandler organizes an expedition to said isle with the goal of getting to the bottom of these shenanigans. Along for the ride are Ridgway, Kelly, and some guy named George Harper (Peter O'Neal). After some initial problems getting to the island thanks to the intransigence of the local guides to go to a place where they're certain to die, the group meets the inestimable Dr. Obrero (Donald O'Brien). A world famous surgeon who claims to be on the island in order to help out the local populace, Obrero seems uninterested in keeping our group of outsiders around. He sends them off into the jungle just in time for an episode of ""When cannibals attack"" to commence. Sadly, some of our new friends don't make it to the end of the film, but the ones who do quickly discover that Dr. Obrero's motivations on the island are far from altruistic. He's up to no good, of course, and that means turning people into shambling zombies on his operating table. I'm not giving anything away by saying this, of course, as you knew there had to be a Dr. Butcher involved somewhere along the line. The rest of the film is an attempt by Chandler and Ridgway to survive the myriad indignities visited upon them by the grotesque Obrero.

This Italian schlockfest gives us all the usual cliches one finds in the zombie genre. We have a remote island loaded with cannibals and the disintegrating undead. We have footage shot in New York City. We have bad dubbing. We have Ian McCulloch playing a lead role. We have a beautiful Eurobabe playing a leading role. We have gore up the wazoo. We have hilarious dialogue. It's all here, all the things that make these cheesy movies such an endearing experience. While I could make an argument, quite successfully, that ""Zombie Holocaust"" is an epic of catastrophic proportions, I'm not going to. I am going to say that I loved this bundle of schlock. It's a great, fun film that will have you laughing out loud. Even better, Alexandra Delli Colli prances about in next to nothing every ten minutes or so. Even better still, we get cannibal munching mixed with surgical carnage, all shot in extreme close up. Yep, it doesn't get much better than that--unless you consider Obrero's hilarious musings concerning brains and vocal cords. One could spend hours discussing the numerous flaws in this film, and spend more hours laughing about them.

We get a boatload of supplements on the Media Blasters DVD. An interview with one of the special effect's geniuses involved in the film, a deleted scene, trailers, and a whole bunch of information about the cuts made in the film to ensure a U.S. release round out the disc. An interview with Roy Frumkes, a filmmaker who contributed some of the new footage to the U.S. cut of the film, runs on and on as he discusses not only his minor contribution to this gore classic but his entire career in low budget cinema (Frumkes is the guy behind the classic ""Street Trash,"" soon to arrive on DVD!). I highly recommend this picture. It's funny, gory, and utterly ridiculous. In other words, a great way to spend a couple of hours!",1122595200,5,5729,4.795546558704453
1667824,5,B00005UQ9H,"Alright. I think most of us already know that 'Zombie Holocaust' is not about to be nominated for any oscars. But who defines good taste anyway?

 There were a great number of things about this film that I enjouyed (speaking as an avid horror fan of course). The many involvements of the plot, I found to be most effective.

 The film starts out as though it is set to be a medical/hospital themed horror film, a little like Re-Animator, which would've worked for me because I love that sort of thing.

But Zombie Holocaust reveils its true colors and begins to introduce tribal elements, before the main characters ship off to the island of doom and the film proves to be along the same lines as 'Cannibal Ferox.'

There is never a dull moment and the veiwer will always be guessing.

 The title 'Zombie Holocaust' is a puzzleing one, because there really is very little zombie holocausting going on.

But it is still a zombie movie and holds a proud position in that sub-genre of my horror movie collection.

It must be agreed, that the zombies in this movie were done remarkably well. The make up is probably the best I've ever seen for this sort of thing, and the zombies are scary.

This movie has got it all: Cannibals, zombies, gore galore and a mad scientist to boot. What more could a horror fan ask for?!

 This movie is also very harsh and sadistic, especally the infamous 'vocal cord removal scene'

Yeah, this film will stay with you long after the credits have rolled.

 Zombie Holocaust aka Dr. Butcher M.D.  is one of the most individual movies I've seen. Combining primative, tribal elements with medical elements is a rare thing, and the film will not be forgotten for it.

The dubbing is ok. A little cheezy at times (at least on the version I've got), but would we have it any other way?

In conclusion, I recommend this film to any horror fan.

Wether you like it or not, it is undeniably a milestone in horror cinema.",1119744000,2,1939,4.517241379310345
1667825,4,B00005UQ9H,"As I almost invariably point out in my reviews of this sorta thing, I prefer good horror films, but I'll take a campy one too, and  'Zombie Holocaust' is about as good as bad horror gets.  With reams of gore and stunning dialogue this film is a delight from beginning to end.  Highly recommended.

As many have mentioned, there aren't actually very many zombies in this movie, and they don't actually kill anyone.  The film was initially released in the US under the much more delicious and appropriate name, 'Dr. Butcher M.D.', so I suggest you think of it as that. Still, title confusion aside, this is a fine gorefest, with cannibals doing the ripping and eating and whatnot, and they prove to be just as good at it as zombies generally are.  The gore actually holds up better than I woulda imagined, better than you'd see in a Fulci film.  Partially, this is because the gore is rarely anything to fancy, mostly just severed limbs and spilled guts, and lots of it is only seen in the aftermath.  But, those are the essentials of your gore film, so you don't ever want stray to far from them.  There are some fun, more elaborate effects, such as a surprisingly nasty and effective eye-gouging scene, and an head mangling via outboard motor so awesome and hilarious that it could be in 'Riki-Oh'.  Sadly, much of the gore is too badly lumped together, with one main cannibal assault in middle part of the film, but there's enough good stuff at other points that it doesn't matter too much.

The plot is staggeringly convoluted.  Alright, there are some corpse desecrations at a hospital in New York, and they wanna find the culprit, which turn out  to be done by natives from some pacific archipelago with a name I can't recall, and some of the hospital workers and reporters and so forth decide to go there, for no apparent reason.  They get their, and meet a humanitarian doctor who  turns out to be a mad scientist whose making zombies, and they're attacked by the fickle natives, and eventually there's a fire, and they're gonna sacrifice the blonde chick but don't for some reasons and there are zombies and he gonna operate on the dude from 'Zombie'(Peter, in both films) and so on.  The wacky plot is good, as films of this sort can get a bit boring while your waiting for the killing to start.  Not so here.

The acting tends to be quite humorous as well. Special kudos go to the mad doctor himself, who is played with a startling, intense vigor.  Humorous dialogue abounds.  A few examples, quoted approximately, but you'll get the gist of it.  After discovering the corpse desecration two hospital employees talk to one another. Old doctor guy: 'I could understand this  happening in a primitive, superstitious society, but here, in New York city?' Chick: 'But doctor, do you really think we are all that different from primitives?' Old doctor guy: 'I just don't know....' Now that, my friends, is called social commentary. Course, it turns out that it was primitives doing it all along, so his doubting of modern man proved to be foolish.  Alright next, upon arriving at the island, the blonde chick finds a severed, maggot covered head in her bed.  They go and tell Dr. Butcher, and he responds, saying, 'Don't worry, if the natives wanted to kill you they could already have done so very easily'. How reassuring.  And of course, there is the absolutely immortal line towards the very end of the film.  Peter nearly escapes, but Dr. Butcher has his zombie slaves catch him, and he pulls a gun on him. Dr Butcher says, 'I could easily kill you now, BUT I'M DETERMINED TO HAVE YOUR BRAIN!!!!!'

Oh man, this movies great. Check it out.",1109203200,13,3647,4.631415241057542
1667826,3,B00005UQ9H,"I went to Fry's Electronic in search of some flicks when I came across this film.  From the moment I read the cover I thought of ""zombies..zombies...oh and lots of apocolyptic chaos and more zombies"".  THIS MOVIE IS NOT WHAT I HAD IMAGINED.  Now as for the movie itself it's pretty decent and main character in this film can also be seen in Zombi.  Zombie Holocause is a very misleading title and not to mention there are barley any zombies in this film!  It should have bin called ""Cannibal Holocaust!""  The movies plot is pretty average and nothing new heck it's sort of similar to Zombi except there are cannibals.

Eventhough the Zombies are not really zombies it is still enjoyable to watch.  The movies main enemies are the cannibals NOT the Zombies.  Is this the best Italian horror film ever?...no but still enjoyable I should have seen the trailer for this film on Zombi DVD but I didn't even go on the trailer section so thus I some how got this film.

As I have said before this isn't even a zombie flick there's barely any zombies seen in this film!  Maybe 3 or 4 but that's it.

The plot is ok, The actors are not even close to the word all right especially Dr. Butcher, and the direction of this film NOT TO MENTION THE MISLEADING TITLE is just plain bad and that's I am giving it

a 3.0 out 5.

I must say that they did show some effort in this film so I will give them Credit.  Also this film is not for the sqweemish as this film has some pretty gritty violent content(one scene involving a man getting his stomach torn apart by the canibals and his eye are gauged out)and of course Nudity, full frontil I might add but in this one she's pretty attractive(Unlike the one in Zombi)

That's all I got to say..

1667828,4,B00005UQ9H,"Zombi Holocaust (A.K.A. Doctor Butcher M.D.) is in a category by itself among Zombie, Cannibal, and Mad Doctor movies because it is all three in a tropical setting. In how many other movies do you get a mad doctor doing Frankenstein experiments, cannibals running amuck, scientists getting lost on the right island, a manniquin leaping to it's death, and Alexandra Delli Colli getting body painted all in one movie. The zombies in this movie are more appropriately automatons (Frankenstein's monsters). They are living beings which have been brought back to life by the mad doctor to do his bidding (of course if they ever got a good look in a mirror they would kill him on the spot). This movie does consist of its good parts and its so bad its good parts. The basic story begins in the city (what city?...who cares) where a rash of cannibalism breaks out (stay with me). In some of the cases the cannibal had a tattoo of an ancient symbol belonging to a group of islands in the Archipeligos. A group of doctors and a reporter take an excursion to an island in the Archipeligos which was pointed out to them by a fellow doctor who attends to the natives on these islands. Unfortunately, they have engine trouble and have to dock the boat at a different island. Then the fun begins. I will not ruin this for those who have not seen this movie. I will say that I have watched this several times and still enjoy it. The four star rating is for the fun factor not the artistic factor (certainly not).

1667842,4,B00005UQ9H,"Zombie Holocaust is a good Italian flick that has suspense and turns.  It contains every genre included in any Italian horror movie (bad dubbing, lots of gore, zombies, cannibals, and nudity), but it does have a negative side to it.  Well, here's the story.
At a hospital, corpses are being cut, revealing missing body parts and organs.  The head doctor becomes suspicious of the whole mess and plan to see who the culprit is.  One night, one student is caught taking a heart out of a corpse and in the process of eating it when he is caught red-handed.  But he commits suicide by jumping out of the window in one of the most hilarious scenes ever filmed. (If you want to know if that was his real arm coming off his body, then you are a fool.  That was a stunt dummy falling on the ground on the tape.)
The female doctor, who is also educated in anthropology, spots a tattoo on the victim's chest.  It is revealed to be a symbol of Keto, a far off island.  She brings this to the attention of a local policeman, played by famed Italian horror hero Ian McCulloch.  so, the female doctor, the cop, his assistant, and a nosy reporter head to the island of Keto to find out what is going on.  Then, like in every zombie or cannibal movie, they face horrible dangers ahead.
Now to the negative aspect.  Just in the same dilemma as Cannibal Apocalypse (which I also reviewed), the title of the movie, Zombie Holocaust does not really fit the plot.  Through the movie, you only spot five or six zombies, all of them never killing anybody in sight, and in one scene appear to be saving our future heroes from being cannibal meat.  Now, if I saw over 100 zombies killing live human flesh, I would consider it be a zombie holocaust, but as far as I'm concerned, it could be named Island Holocaust.  Also, what is the whole purpose of the mad doctor killing humans and implanting their soul into other corpses?  Just like other Italian movies, the plot doesn't mesh.

All of that is rolled into ZOMBIE HOLOCAUST aka DOCTOR BUTCHER M.D. (Medical Deviate). If you're already looking here, chances are you're already a fan of the italian horror genre. This ain't CITIZEN KANE, kids. Sure, there's bad dialogue, a few cheesy special effects (A suicidal manequin jumps from a window?), and plot holes big enough swallow a Fiat... But that's all part of the B-movie charm that you love in italian zombie films. It's a zombie flick, yes, but they're only a fraction of the whole cannoli here. In fact, you've got a whole lotta cannibals and, might I add, for an italian cannibal film there is NO ANIMAL SLAUGHTER to be found, very nice for a change! But where there's cannibals and zombies, there's usually buckets of gore. Whole lotta gore. Eye gouging, throat slashing, rib cracking, disemboweling, bloody, gooey gore. The film stars Ian McCulloch, who also starred in Lucio Fulci's classic ZOMBIE, and the gorgeous Alexandra Delli Colli, who is just a stunning nude. Yes, you gotta love italian zombie movies!
Anyway, Shriek Show did a great job with this DVD with an anamorphic widescreen transfer and a great selection of extras. Clearly these are people who love the genre as much as their fans and produce a superior product to show as much.
If you're new to the italian zombie genre, I'd recommend picking this one up, along with Fulci's ZOMBIE. And just a word of advice: If Ian McCulloch calls up and invites you to vacation with him in the tropics, RUN, DON'T WALK, as fast as you can!",1059955200,5,1642,4.867857142857143

It looked serious enough to a ten-year-old but now that I've actually sat down and watched it I couldn't help but laugh at its sheer incompetence.  The music must be attributed to a small Casio, the special effects are some of the worst I've ever seen (paging Herschell Gordon Lewis!), the dialogue is inept (""I'm determined to have your brain!"") and the zombies aren't really the bad guys; that title goes to mad Dr. Obrero and the decidedly Asian cannibals that attack our heroes on the island.  Bashes you over the head with its stupidity, but hard liquor significantly softens the impact, and actually can make it fun under such influence (especially with friends to help make fun of it).",1054166400,4,805,4.735714285714286
1667848,4,B00005UQ9H,"With a snappy title like ""Zombie Holocaust"" you're lead to believe that this film has hordes of the living dead tearing into people like a 20 piece order of hot wings, but that's not the case. In fact, there are very few zombies, and though those few look really cool, they're relatively wimpy and harmless. Plus, they don't kill anyone and they're easily dispatched. The gory mayhem in this film comes from a cannibal tribe, and they certainly do excel in it. An earlier reviewer already covered the fact that this film is way too influenced by Fulci's Zombie, but I'm going to talk a little about that as well. It starts in New York(So does Zombie. Italian horror directors have an obsession with New York for some reason), and our cast of characters set out to find the island that the cannibals are coming from. Good ol' Ian McCulloch is once again in the lead(as in Zombie) as a New Yorker named Peter(as in Zombie) taking a trip to some doomed island of zombies(as in Zombie). In reality, these people wouldn't even go to the island, it would just be an open and shut case of murder....... but we wouldn't have a movie then, would we? Peter gets some servants to escort him to the island(one of them is a guy from Zombie who basically played the same role), and their boat goes on the fritz(as in Zombie). Once we get to the island we're treated to some creepy voodoo drum music(like the kind in Zombie), and our gang is assaulted by the cannibals! Alot of them get wasted in pretty gruesome fashion. The ""jungle noises"" sound like a guy repeatedly twisting a very rusty faucet(same ""Jungle Sound"" in Jungle Holocaust). Well, after slipping by the cannibals and zombies, our guy and gal end up at the lab of a deranged scientist doing wacky experiments involving zombies(as in Zombie). The doctor's sadistic to be sure, but comes across about as scary as the Three Stooges. And after the action packed climax of the film, the zombies and lab go down in flames(kinda like in Zombie).",1050105600,3,1988,4.587078651685394
1667849,2,B00005UQ9H,"In the late '70s and early '80s, in the wake of the success of Romero's Dawn of the Dead, the Italian film industry was churning out zombie flicks left and right.  Some of them, like Lucio Fulci's Zombie, practically redefined the genre.  Others were simply cheap knockoffs designed to cash in on the zombie craze.  Zombie Holocaust falls into the latter category.
For starters, much of the plot is out-and-out stolen from Zombie. The movie stars Ian McCulloch (who also starred in Zombie -- go figure) as a cop who must travel to a remote tropical island to solve a series of bizarre cannibal murders in New York. Sound familiar? When he gets there, he finds that a mad scientist is creating a race of zombies, who are wreaking havoc on the island -- another plot element from Zombie. And, as in Zombie, the film ends with a fiery showdown between the remaining humans and the zombies. None of this would matter if the film had great special effects, good acting or any other redeeming quality. But it doesn't.
On the plus side, there are plenty of extras on this fine DVD from Shriek Show. Among these, there is a lengthy interview with Roy Frumkes, who was tangentially involved with the highly edited American version of this film, ""Dr. Butcher, MD."" German and American trailers, an interview with a special-effects artist who worked on the film and a deleted scene are also included. There is also an easter egg: go to the ""Special Thanks"" menu and click on the name ""Edwin Samuelson."" When you do, you'll see the American version of the opening sequence.
The only thing that detracts from the viewing experience is the slight blurriness of the picture. Cheap film stock used in the original production is the likely culprit here. Given the high quality of the rest of the DVD, it seems unlikely that the film-to-digital transfer is somehow to blame.

If you are like me, after seeking out some of the brighter lights of the genre (Zombi 2 for example) you may come across the festering turkey of ""Zombie Holocaust / Dr. Butcher"". This movie is great and I won't write another list of great scenes but a few points;
-The tagline calls Dr Butcher, among other things, a "" sadistic rapist"". I am not one to seek out movies with sexual assaults because I don't find it entertaining. The tagline is just a bit of a trashy come-on; there are no rape scenes in this movie, and honestly I cannot imagine Dr Butcher even looking at a female as anything other than someone to scalp and lobotomize.
-This movie GENEROUSLY rips off Zombi 2 and has zero ability to recreate the atmosphere or zany terror of Lucio Fulci's epic gorefest. Ian McCulloch was cast as lead for both movies. His partner although beautiful, is even more blank than Tissa Farrow, which is saying something. I believe the truck in which they explore the island is the same one. The Dr's lab looks like the same set at the end of Zombi 2. The great Dakar plays trusty right hand man in both movies. The main difference is that this movie has cannibals making most of the carnage while the zombies just kind of stagger around in the woods unless they are being set ablaze. The zombie on the cover with one glaring eye and a rotten flapjack covering the rest of his face has become an iconic image associated with this type of zombie movie.

So if you haven't seen it, I heartily recommend, especially if terrible, non sensical, poorly directed, Italian exploitation zombie movies are your thing (I know they sure are mine)",1450137600,,1758,4.5109717868338555
7955303,2,B00005UQ9H,"Italian films are always fun, even this stupid, repetitive sex and gore fest.  It is so cool to see actors in classy Italian fashions portraying ordinary Americans-who are universally fashion slobs compared to even average man on the street Italians.  This film is more or less a re-shoot of Zombi II, another Italian Zombie flick.
 Not only is the story line almost identical-strange events in New York City provoke our intrepid band to head for the Tropics where most of them are dispatched by Zombies-but even some of the actors and film clips are recycled.  These Zombies are constructs of a demented medical genius (just like Zombie II).  Actors Ian McCulloch and Dakar play almost the same roles that they pioneered in the previous film.
 Director Marino Girolami provided absolutely nothing new in this film, one of dozens that he made.  His other titles include Nude Obcon and Two R-R-Ringos From Texas.  He has a wide experience but to judge from Zombie Holocaust, little imagination.  He does have actress Alexandra Delli Colli and uses her to best advantage.
 Delli Colli was only 23 in 1980 but her character is supposed to have both a degree in Anthropology and Medicine.  As Dr. Lori Ridgeway, she is most impressive when she sheds her clothing, which she does frequently.  The turn in the movie comes when she is about to be sacrificed by little Asian cannibal guys (most of the mayhem is caused by the little cannibal dudes, not Zombies.  The Zombies have a supporting role as it were.)  They are so taken by her Blonde Beauty, and prolonged shots with full frontal nudity, that they revolt against the evil genius, save the last two surviving New Yorkers andfine.
 Cool items, besides a beautiful naked Medical Doctor covered in floral body paint, include a Zombie kill by outboard motor and a scalped news hen getting her skull popped off while she is deliberately kept awake.  The Mad Doctor is really off the beam.
 The most un-cool item is the dead pan acting.  In the climatic scene, the two survivors watch a burning Zombie thrash around while a horde of little Asian dudes gobble up the mad Doctor.  They show less emotion to these goings on than a little old English lady discussing her roses.
 This single brain, derivative film might have some entertainment value, especially to those who like naked girls.  People who want a competent story line or competent acting will be badly disappointed.",1426118400,,2421,4.827669902912621

Of course when a pretty blonde is capture by a group of ""savages"" they must be stripped naked like Bo Derek or Ursala Andress. Don't blame me, I don't make the rules. Alexandra Delli Colli is a natural blonde.",1414800000,,656,4.248
7955305,3,B00005UQ9H,"I'm not entirely certain this movie qualifies as a zombie flick.  The producer Fabrizio De Angelis admits he decided to combine two horror genres because of the success at that time of zombie movies and cannibal movies.  Only in this movie, the zombies are manmade and they don't eat anyone.
The plot concerns a series of bizarre incidents in a hospital; someone is stealing body parts.  They eventually catch the culprit red-handed, about to snack on a heart.  The felon makes a run for it.......out a window.  For reasons that are not entirely clear, a doctor (Ian McCulloch) decides to investigate these strange occurrences (making it seem like a lark).  He talks an anthropologist (Alexandra Delli Colli) into going with him, along with his assistant (Peter O'Neal) and a reporter (Sherry Buchanan).  They head to a remote island they're told contains the answers they're looking for.  Engine trouble forces them to land on a closer island.  From that point on, everything that could possibly go wrong, does.  Along with a never ending supply of hungry cannibals, they also stumble onto a mad scientist (Donald O'Brien) and his insane scheme to prolong the lifespan of mankind.........by killing people and switching their brains with dead people.  I didn't quite see the sense in that but then this movie stops making sense long before that revelation is unleashed.

If for nothing else, this movie should gain points just for audacity.  The story is nonsensical, the `zombies' are incidental to the plot, the gore is limited to a few wow scenes and a lot of expected treatments that are less than inspired.

7955307,2,B00005UQ9H,"I think there's a certain set of expectations one brings to the table when reading about or selecting to watch a film called 'Zombie Holocaust'.  Conversely, the film was first released in America with the title, 'Doctor Butcher, Medical Deviate', which probably also has a set of expectations built into it, although I can't say for sure - actually, I would have likely passed on 'Doctor Butcher, M.D.', but 'Zombie Holocaust' had me at 'zombie'.

Part of those expectations involve comparisons between all other Italian zombie films of the late 70's and 80's with Lucio Fulci's classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zombie/dp/B0002C9DK4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zombie</a>, which to me ranks near the top of ALL zombie films.  Knowing also that Ian McCulloch, the lead in 'Zombie' returns in 'Holocaust, and that both films were shot on the same sets led me to hope that 'Holocaust might be at least half the film 'Zombie' was.

Nope.

'Zombie Holocaust' is a sort of genre mash-up between cannibal film and zombies, with the extreme gore of the film reserved for the cannibals.  Now, you might call it splitting hairs, but I'm not really a big fan of cannibal footage, though zombies don't bother me.  I suppose it has to do with one layer of fantasy being removed, but I can't say for sure.  Anyway, in 'Holocaust', several cadavers at a metropolitan hospital have been violated, and eventually its discovered that a cult of islanders who are now living in New York are dismembering and eating them.  A motley crew of investigators set off to find out the connection between the cult and the island of Kito.

Upon arrival at a neighboring Island, they meet up with Dr. Obrero, who first comes across as a sort of Dr. Schweitzer.  Later, the group discovers that Obrero has not only revived the cannibal cult among the natives of Kito, but that he has also been involved in horrific experiments designed to reanimate the dead.  Of course, once those crazy kids see what Obrero is really up to, he vows to dispose of them as gruesomely as possible.

What can I say?  I enjoy these low-budget cheese fests, but this one didn't really do it for me.  Perhaps it was so over the top that I never could get into it - at least with 'Zombie', if you bought into the fact that the dead were up walking around again and looking for dinner, the rest of the film proceeded fairly logically.  'Holocaust', on the other hand, seems to want to throw so much at the viewer that none of it really sticks.  Cannibals, zombies, mad scientists - sheesh, pick one and stick with it.  The production value seemed a little less than 'Zombie' also, and many of the night scenes were almost unwatchable.

Essentially, this film was trying to make a quick buck from horror fans, and did it as cheaply as possible.  The special effects were unremarkable, and there were no scenes that really made the story stand apart from just trying to gross the audience out.  Never did I feel as if the film created any real tension - it just stumbled from scene to scene, some quite ridiculous by film's end, and then it was over.

Two saving graces to this flick that keep it out of one star territory - Alexandra Delli Colli as the stunningly attractive anthropologist who goes on to be the nakedly nubile queen of the cannibals, and Donald O'Brien, who chews up scene after scene as the mad Obrero, or Dr. Butcher in the American version.

Extras on the disc are pretty substandard - this is a film which would have benefitted from a commentary, but the closest we get is an interview with the speciaal effects director who doesn't even remember much about the film.  There are also a few trailers and some other interviews with Roy Frumkes, who supplied some supplemental footage for the American edition.

There is no ""holocaust"" of zombies, unless you consider a group of 4 shuffling zombies a holocaust.

This move should be called Cannical Holocaust...With Zombies, because that is exactly what it is. Although Cannibal Holocaust isn't a grand movie, it is still actually better than this title, which is attempting to rip it off in a way.

Back in the late 70's/early 80's, zombie films and cannibal films were making big money. Zombie Holocaust is a lame attempt to cash in on BOTH genres at the same time by throwing zombies in what is basically a cannibal/mondo movie.

But the most important fact here: this movie just isn't that great. It is boring, with bad acting, bad zombies, silly tribal cannibals and people somehow managing to get eaten by cannibals who barely comprehend something as complicated as the wheel.

Your money would be better spend elsewhere",1212537600,,897,4.875
