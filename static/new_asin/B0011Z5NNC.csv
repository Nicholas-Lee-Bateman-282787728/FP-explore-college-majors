3070503,5,B0011Z5NNC,"Season two differs from Season one in that there is less focus on the Begley household and more on the greening up the homes of other celebs. I still enjoy this version, but miss the antics of the rain barrel and solar oven from the first season. I sure wish we could get a hold of Season Three, but Discovery network is being jerky about it! GIVE US SEASON 3!",1384300800,,360,4.1571428571428575
3070504,5,B0011Z5NNC,I've loved Ed Begley Jr since his days on St. Elsewhere! But can you imagine living with him today? LOL he's a lot of fun to watch but... But the show is so much fun and I've learned alot about greening the planet and conserving all I can. Love seeing Jay Leno and his neighbor Bill Nye show up often. Ed's wife deserves a lot of credit!,1331596800,,337,4.044776119402985

3070506,5,B0011Z5NNC,Living with Ed is so funny!  Ed and Rachelle gave us so many great ideas to make our home a bit greener without going broke.  Ed and Rachelle are inspirational and motivational. Talk about practice what you preach.  Love the show!,1277078400,,230,4.560975609756097
3070507,2,B0011Z5NNC,"I cant tell if this is intended to be serious or is a spoof on green advocates.  Such naieve people, creating tons of carbon to facilitate token installing some questionable green product.  Obviously the concept of Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) is too large to fit Ed's head much less the show.  If it is supposed to be serious, I give it one star.  If it is supposed to be funny, I give it 3. and so the average is 2.",1235001600,,414,4.1375
3070508,4,B0011Z5NNC,"I actually preferred Season One, which highlighted how to develop and maintain a green household when not all (seemingly) are on board with the idea. Season Two is a bit too Hollywood Celebs Today for my taste, and the homes are not exactly like those a lot of us are living in (whereas Ed and Rachelle's is very much so).",1228003200,3,322,4.383333333333334

3070510,3,B0011Z5NNC,"I bought the book first and it has great tips on how to be spend less money and conserve more, which is what I was looking for. The series is pretty entertaining and gives some good motivation to be conservation minded. It's a bit annoying to see people tearing down perfectly good houses to build a more green house, or to see 2 people living in a huge house ""go green"" by replacing a few light bulbs with CFLs. I appreciate the Begley's for living as they preach though, so getting insights and tips from the way they live was good value. It's also nice that he doesn't judge anyone's efforts to conserve, no matter how small or how egregious their waste might be in other areas. As he says, low hanging fruit first and any improvement is good.",1224979200,2,746,4.374100719424461
3070511,4,B0011Z5NNC,"As in the first season, successful actor Ed Begley, Jr. plays himself as an average Joe dedicated to conservation and simple living. His wife, Rachelle Carson, plays herself as an average Jane that would rather not think about energy one way or the other, mugging her aggravation relentlessly as Ed preaches conservation. Instead of scaring you with talk of climate change, Living With Ed serves up a mix of simple energy-saving tips (the low-hanging fruit) and pricey new technology.

We were interested by the green design approaches in the large and elegant houses of celebrities Cheryl Tiegs, Jackson Browne, and Phil Rosenthal & Monica Horan, but Larry Hagman's opulent 25,000 SF hilltop Xanadu didn't seem to fit with a message of energy conservation. To his credit, Hagman has incorporated $750K worth of solar panels, and donates energy to help nearby working class families, but Ed fails to point out that such an immense house for two people, even with a household staff, is extravagantly inefficient.",1222041600,3,1011,5.127272727272727

8243047,5,B0011Z5NNC,"Any self-respecting eco-friendly environmentalist or environmentalist wannabe will get a real kick out of this series, with Ed Begley, Jr. giving you all sorts of great advice on saving the planet while his not-as-enthusiastic spouse provides a typical real world counterpoint to Ed's fanaticism. I loved every one of these shows for multiple reasons, not the least of which is my own effort to make my own family completely eco-friendly. In many ways I admire Ed's dedication towards a less trashy, self-sufficient, self-sustaining planet. Two fantastically enthusiastic thumbs way up for this series!!!",1437004800,,604,5.505376344086022
