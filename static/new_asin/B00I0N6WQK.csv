8638081,3,B00I0N6WQK,"There is almost nothing by Emmylou that I don't like. I find this a little strange, perhaps because it was performed in front of a European audience, but it was still OK. Region 4 DVD's (Australia) for Emmylou are hard to come by, so this fills a spot.",1442620800,,252,4.270833333333333

8638083,4,B00I0N6WQK,"If you love EMMY LOU (and I do) this is a good performance done several years a go
during her SPY BOY tour.  It's a good clean visual and sound version.
There is another DVD made about thsi time period that is just a tad better, BUT If you
really are a fan.......You'll need this one also",1400803200,4,288,4.052631578947368
8638084,1,B00I0N6WQK,"Whilst this DVD seems ""official"", I can only think that it is some sort of bootleg because the quality of the video is almost unwatchable! The audio is OK but Emmy seems uncharacteristically uninvolved in her performance. For avid fans only....",1397347200,8,244,4.975609756097561
