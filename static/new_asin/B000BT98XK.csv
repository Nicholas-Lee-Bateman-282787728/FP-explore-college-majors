2440215,4,B000BT98XK,"Great movie, I love SLJ, he's an American treasure, and he was so funny, as was Eugene Levy.  Worth your time.",1137715200,,110,4.238095238095238
2440216,4,B000BT98XK,"Buddy cop movies are certainly nothing new to filmdom.  THE MAN is not one of the best, but one can't deny the entertaining value it has.  Chalk this up mainly to the gifted Eugene Levy, who can make any material seem fresh and funny.  As the dental supply salesman Fiddler, he finds himself involved in a sting originally planned for badass Samuel L. Jackson.  When Jackson decides to milk this mistake and capture the bad guy (Luke Goss), he and Levy enter into a questionable partnership.  The movie wouldn't have been half as good if not for the rapport that Levy and Jackson establish in a pretty whitewashed script.  But there are some fun moments and even Levy can make flatulent jokes seem new.  If you want some fun entertainment, THE MAN delivers.",1137628800,,757,4.646616541353383
2440217,4,B000BT98XK,"This movie, for me, had some lower expectations, but to my surprise...this movie was really, really funny!! Both Eugene Levy and Samel L Jackson did a wonderful job with the material!! This movie had it all...and then some...action, suspense, laughs a million and great direction!! This is the kind of movie that you can just have  a good time with. The script flowed really well between all the actors involved, no matter how small of a part that they did or how big. Watch  THE MAN, action packed, funny as all get out movie that will have you wanting more!!",1137628800,12,560,4.59
2440218,3,B000BT98XK,"Derek Vann (Samuel L. Jackson) works for the A.T.F. (Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives) and he's the trigger-happy, untrusting, shoot-now-ask-questions-later[...]. He's on the case following some weaponry that was stolen right from the A.T.F. warehouse and will be leaving the city in 24 hours. He's contated the thieves posing as a potential buyer (after he learns that his partner is dead and the cache of guns has been stolen) and he sets up a sting to try to get the weapons back. Everything is going smoothly up until Vann is late for the meeting and the thieves mistake Andy Fidler (Eugene Levy), a talkative simpleton who gives everyone the ""benefit of the doubt,"" for the potential buyer. Now, the two must make peace in order for Vann to take down the crooks and Fidler to make it back to his family in one piece.

""The Man"" is the type of movie that would make a great rental: No so good that you should buy it, but not bad enough to miss it entirely. It's a good movie, but not one that you'd see over and over.

The acting by Samuel L. Jackson and Eugene Levy is great. Each portrayed their character beautifully and each role seemed to fit perfectly. The dialogue is, at times, predictable and, at some other times, just plain corny. Nonetheless, it does have it's peak moments (""I'm taking a mental picture of you...[blink, blink]..."") and comical value. They mix well.

I thought that it would be uproariously hilarious from start to finish, but it's not exactly like that. Although some comical moments and witty banter does appear every so often, this is not what dominates the film. I do believe that the director (and writers) did a good job of not to skew from the storyline in order to get a few cheap laughs.

Though it's less than likely that is will be the best movie you've ever seen, you're sure to have a good time watching Vann create colorful insults to Fidler and watching Fidler get Vann into more and more trouble. So, if you're at your local video club looking for a few laughs and some mild adventures, this is the movie you're looking for.",1137369600,3,2092,4.600536193029491
2440219,3,B000BT98XK,"I had high hopes for this film, despite the critics reviews. I am a huge fan of Samuel L. Jackson and Eugene Levy. However, this movie was just not that funny. There were about three times that I laughed really hard, but the rest of the movie, I was just watching Eugene get in and out of one scrape after another. The characters are stock characters for Eugene and Samuel. Eugene is playing the straight-laced, good hearted though somewhat naive, dental supply salesman and Samuel plays a hard-nosed cop who doesn't trust anybody. I felt like I had seen both of them play these characters in other movies and while they are both very good at these roles, the movie did not come off as being fresh or original because you feel like you've seen this before. You just haven't seen these two do it TOGETHER (which I think is the whole point of this movie).

Of the two, I enjoyed Levy's performance more than Samuel's, possibly because Levy's character is the butt of most of the jokes. Plus I miss the snappy dialogue of Samuel's other movies like the Long Kiss Goodnight or the interesting meanderings of Pulp Fiction. Though the theme is a re-hashed one, I appreciated the fact that the two men had to learn from one another. The dental salesman needed to learn discernment and the cop needed to learn trust.

I think that the acting was good but because the material that Levy and Jackson had to work with was not fresh, The Man suffered because of it. Still, it's a light hearted buddy movie and deserves a look. However, I definately would not pay 19.95 (ie, full price) for this movie! Buy it on sale unless you are a collector of works by these actors or this director and you just have to have it! The only exception would be if you've never seen other films by Levy or Jackson. If so, the movie will probably be much funnier for you because the characters will be new.",1137196800,,1875,4.463556851311953

While in Detroit, he happens to be at the wrong place at the wrong time, and some gun-dealers think he is a buyer. Agent Vann thinks Andy is robbing the store, because one of the bad guys gives Andy a gun. Throughout the film, Andy is annoying to Vann, who has no time for nonsense.

Samuel Jackson is great in a dramatic role as an ATF officer trying to track down the gunrunners that killed his partner and are selling the large shipment of guns they stole. Eugene Levy is pretty comical as the wrong man in the right place at the wrong time. He adds the comedic element to the movie as a dentist going to a convention in Detroit. When he gets mistaken for a gun buyer he ends up assisting Jackson, if you could call it that, in dealing with the gunnrunners. Nice mix of drama and humor and a decent story make it worth renting or even buying if you like comedy/drama cop movies.",1168214400,2,736,4.340579710144928

Samuel Jackson is convincing as a ""cop with issues"" and Eugene Levy realistically portrays a ""man caught in the middle"" of a crime gone sideways.

But that's something it hasn't got

I can't believe Sam and Eugene

Just put it back - don't even rent

2440343,2,B000BT98XK,"Sorry, after watching this film I became too ""brain dead"" to come up with a title for this review.  This film comes across as an adventure-comedy farce.  It has some truly funny moments, but the humor doesn't leave you feeling good.  It leaves you with more of the blush that one feels after having laughed at an off color joke.  Not much about this film, the plot, the action, nor the punch lines is original.",1153094400,,410,4.426666666666667
2440344,4,B000BT98XK,"If you browse the other reviews on this page, you will quickly note that many viewers thought rather poorly of this film. But if you survey their comments more carefully, you will observe that the better part of their debasements are targeted toward but a single facet of this multivalent, living artwork. That is to say, many found the basic adherence of the film's humor to the topic of flatulence to be disproportionate, if not excessive.

To this I reply that the flatulence humor is not disproportionate, excessive, or even overtly bothersome. Rather, it is simply misunderstood. Reviewers who unfairly target this source of amusement fail to appreciate it in its appropriate literary context. Director Les Mayfield draws from traditions that stem from the days of Chaucer, who writes, ""Speke swete bird, I n'ot wher thou art. / This Nicholas anon let fleen a fart, / As gret as it had ben a thonder dint, / That with the stroke he was wel nie yblint."" And by the fifth page of Moby Dick, Melville writes, ""For as in this world, head winds are far more prevalent than winds from astern (that is, if you never violate the Pythagorean maxim)."" I am sure none of ""The Man's"" detractors would ever blaspheme the names of Melville or Chaucer; this is evidence of the underlying hypocrisy in this film's unfair reviews.

Please disregard the negative verbiage of the other reviews on Amazon and treat yourself to this cinematic masterpiece.",1152057600,,1439,4.845528455284553

2440356,1,B000BT98XK,"In ""The Man"", we have a dental supply salesperson (played by Eugene Levy) that gets caught up in a weapon's deal, and has to work with a cranky ATF agent (played by Samuel L. Jackson).

The plot itself was not too bad.  Unfortunately, the movie is supposed to be a comedy.  And when you are a comedy, and the best gag you have in the whole movie is a fart joke, you can pretty much guess that the movie ""stunk up the joint"".  (All puns intended.)

Levy was his usual bland self, and Jackson simply played a bully.  Neither was outstanding, leaving the movie to feel awfully flat.

I wouldn't watch this again if I had a choice.  Watching it the first time was of only limited laughs, and not really worth the 83 minutes I spent watching it.",1144108800,,740,4.273381294964029
2440357,2,B000BT98XK,"Being a fan of both Samuel L. and Eugene L., I was looking forward to this film with eager anticipation of some good belly laughs.  Unfortunately I only had a few smiles and some half-hearted chuckles.  This talented twosome had a tired script to work from.  They gallantly try to make it work--Samuel with his tough guy with a heart of gold act and Eugene with his good hearted dork act.  It wasn't enough to get past the tired fart jokes and some of the meaner humor.  I didn't think it was funny that an ATF agent was ramming an informant with his Cadillac and complaining about the front of his car smelling like ""ass.""  Skip it and re-rent American Pie.",1144022400,4,658,4.396694214876033
2440358,4,B000BT98XK,"I never even wanted to see this movie b/c of all the bad reviews I read on it. I just figured it would be stupid. So after I had several people tell me how funny it was I decided to rent it myself. I really enjoyed it! It is not the best movie I have ever seen by far, but it is funny and very entertaining. I have come to find that the movies that have the worst reviews are the ones I end up liking the most. Give this movie a try, you will enjoy it!",1140220800,5,452,3.670103092783505
2440359,1,B000BT98XK,"The characters played by Levy and Jackson are thin retreads and the production values are nonexistent.  None of this would matter, of course, if there was a reasonably coherent story.",1139961600,2,183,5.1
2440360,3,B000BT98XK,"Why did this movie get such savagely bad reviews?  I rented it with the full expectation that I would hate it, that it would be a non-stop barrage of stupid jokes.  Not true.  The plot is decent and there are funny lines thrown in appropriately without going overboard.  Levy and Jackson work well together.  Sure, it is a formula ""buddy picture"" from start to finish, but it was good, not bad.",1139702400,2,394,4.492957746478873
2440361,4,B000BT98XK,"This year has been a bizarre year for movies. It literally has some of the best and worst things I've seen in a while. The year started off rocky, but things really picked up during the summer. While there may be fewer five-star movies out there, this summer was a great time to see some really good films.

However, once Labor Day passes, we pass into the doldrums of the fall. Kids are back in school, so there are fewer of them at the multiplex. The big summer blockbusters have all been released, and the holiday films are still several months away. Same goes for the Oscar nods that tend to flood the market in the winter.

Some say that late August and early September are the darkest days for movies, and that's usually true. It certainly was for the last few weeks with movies like ""A Sound of Thunder"" and ""The Cave"" stinking up the joint. I had little confidence that ""The Man,"" a fish-out-of-water buddy cop movie starring Eugene Levy and Samuel L. Jackson, was going to be different.

In fact, I said to a friend before seeing it, ""This has `suck' written all over it.""

However, as I was watching the movie, something strange happened... I started laughing. Does this mean that ""The Man"" is a great movie? No. It doesn't even mean it was a good movie. It just made me laugh.

The movie itself is beyond preposterous. Eugene Levy plays a dental equipment salesman who stumbles into an arms deal orchestrated by an ATF officer played by Samuel L. Jackson. They're stuck together as a bickering couple until they can bring down the bad guys. The stars play exactly to type. Eugene Levy reprises the roles he played in films like ""American Pie"" and ""Waiting for Guffman."" Samuel L. Jackson gives us the honest cop take on his character Jules from ""Pulp Fiction.""

But they're both so good at these stock characters that it brings a bizarre level of charm to the movie. It's what ""Pulp Fiction"" would have been if Eugene Levy had been cast as Vincent Vega instead of John Travolta. Not really a good idea, but still funny.

Is it predictable? Yes. Does it have juvenile humor throughout it? Yes. Is the story as flimsy as wet tissue paper? Absolutely. It is everything that all the other critics are going to complain about. But like the gorgeous Jessica Rabbit once told a cynical private investigator as to why she loved her freaky little husband. He made her laugh. Never underestimate the power of laughter, people. It's what made the fat, bald Curly Howard a huge ladies man.

Ultimately, you can't take this movie too seriously. In some ways, this film is as much of a spoof of the buddy-cop formula as it is a serious attempt to make another ""Lethal Weapon"" or ""Rush Hour."" I wouldn't expect Levy and Jackson to become cinema icons like the famous comedy duos Laurel & Hardy or Abbot & Costello. They're more like the less-famous comedy duo of Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan.

They do put on a good show... as long as you're not expecting something great.",1139529600,3,2968,4.56390977443609
2440362,2,B000BT98XK,"The producers of The Man calculated that the collision of their innate racial qualities would produce the kind of comic sparks that Levy and Queen Latifah set off in Bringing Down the House. When ATF agent Derrick Vann (Jackson, Pulp Fiction) learns that his partner is dead and a cache of guns has been stolen, he sets up a sting to get the weapons back. But into the middle of his scheme stumbles Andy Fiddler (Levy, A Mighty Wind, American Pie), a dental supplies salesman from Wisconsin. From there unspools some formulaic buddy-movie pap: Vann gives Fiddler a dose of excitement and Fiddler teaches Vann a little compassion and trust as they improbably track down the bad guys. To a degree, the producers were right--the interplay between Levy's Groucho eyebrows and Jackson's burning scowl provides the only juice this movie has. The Man doesn't deserve actors as talented as Levy and Jackson, but there's no denying they apply themselves diligently and squeeze out a couple laughs.",1138060800,,988,4.957831325301205
2440363,4,B000BT98XK,"When I first saw the trailer for this movie, I didn't think I'd like it very much.  How can you pair Samuel Jackson & Eugene Levy together and make it watchable?

Samuel Jackson plays Special Agent Vann, a cop with an attitude. While Eugene Levy plays Andy Fiddler, a dental salesman??  Unreal.

Anyways, Vann is out to find his partners killer.  And he seems to be close to nabbing them when Andy stumbles into the picture.  Vann goes undercover and has set up a deal to purchase illegal weapons from some bad guys he thinks might be the ones who killed his partner.

However, Andy is mistakenly taken to be Vann.  The weapons dealer gives Andy a bag containing a phone and a gun.  He then tells Andy to wait for his call.  Andy proceeds to open the bag to find phone and gun.  A waitress at the diner they've met at sees the gun and screams ""he's got a gun"".

Vann walks in on this and it looks like Andy is sticking up the joint.  So Vann draws his weapon.  He eventually figures out that the deal went down already, only with Andy instead of himself.

So he takes Andy along with him to try and continue the deal and make things right. But things only get worse from there.

Watch and see how things turn out.  Hilarious scene with Jackson and Levy in the car.  Remember the word FLATULENCE.

Good humor.  Funny and serious at the same time. Not bad, not great. Watch it to the finish.  You'll be glad.",1137888000,2,1406,4.290076335877862
2440364,4,B000BT98XK,"I went to see `the man`on theater with my friend and my friend`s mom i had average expectation from this movie but it turned out to be quite good. Eugene levy and Samuel.l jackson works together to get rid of a mafia gang and they make quite a team..

The movie has really funny parts but remains serious, a buisness man gets into a policeman`s way and they work together against the sort of mafia. The levy-jackson `s very different attitudes when put together makes a winning lottery ticket. You could expect an action movie but after youl see it youl come to the conclusion that this could also be a comedy movie the mix of both makes a great movie.its a different kind of movie that many people can appeal too. Really,really good! Eugene levy alway take the role of a buisnessman and samuel the role of a rough attitude guy.

Less known movies like `the man`shoudnt be ignored because they're really good and funny. 4 stars.go rent it or buy it now `the man`is a great movie.",1137801600,,979,4.4636871508379885
