5256622,2,B0093URNL2,"Unfortunately, I don't agree with the other reviewers.  I've been doing yoga for about 6 years but had to stop last year due to surgery.  I was looking for some dvd's to get me back gently.  I consider this a ""workout"" video that happens to use yoga moves.  If you are looking for a yoga dvd that discusses alignment, breathing, and allows for introspection while you practice, this is not for you.  I love Bethenny's tv shows, but would definitly grow tired of her shtick while trying to practice everyday.  Won't be using these.  Love Tamal Dodge's dvd's.  That's the kind of yoga I appreciate.",1366848000,2,596,4.609523809523809
5256623,5,B0093URNL2,Love the dvds! Love bethennys jokes and that its challenging for her too. Already feeling more toned and fit and i have only done them a few times.,1363996800,,147,4.285714285714286
5256624,5,B0093URNL2,"The other one is ok, just not my cup of tea. The Body by Bethenny is great though, very practical and do-able. Overall great price for a great product.",1362355200,,151,4.241379310344827
5256625,5,B0093URNL2,"I've never done yoga before and wanted something that wasn't too advanced that I couldn't do. While advanced, this video also provides easier versions of each move so you can learn with the easy moves and work up to the advanced moves when you're ready.

And Bethenny is very entertaining throughout the entire workout.",1361145600,6,319,4.907407407407407
5256626,5,B0093URNL2,"Excellent. I have never found a DVD workout that I could either stand the instructor or at the appropriate level for my fitness. (I have probably purchased 10+ DVDs in search of a do-able workout that still has an edge) I am not overweight and have been an avid runner for 10+ years. However, after having babies and throwing my back out lifting them...I had to address the fact that my body needs some strength, stretching and TLC. This workout set is just right. I felt like I had done something and Bethenny is entertaining to listen to over and over. Not too pushy...just is. I have tried Jillian's workout...As a working mom doing these DVDs at 4am...I don't need the ""pump up"" for motivation and it is hard on my body at that time in the morning. If you are looking for a hard workout that won't damage your already injured body. This is great...Even when I start running again...I will keep this DVD in rotation at least 2x week for strength and stretching! P.S. the kids love doing the moves right along with Bethenny on the weekends.",1359244800,8,1042,4.518518518518518
5256627,5,B0093URNL2,"These DVD's are done as if the trainer is giving Bethenny and us a yoga lesson.  Bethenny chimes in periodically to ask questions or make comments, but the instructors do the teaching.  Both instructors are very easy to follow and both of them stress the importance of doing the poses correctly and breathing throughout.

Body By Bethenny is a great 40-minute workout taught by Kristin McGee.  Bethenny's Skinny Girl Workout, with Mike McArdie, is done in three segments so you can (supposedly) choose the length that works for you.  Since I hadn't done yoga in a while I chose the 15 minute segment.  30 minutes later I looked at the clock wondering why it hadn't ended.  I guess I was supposed to be timing myself and just shut it off?  But it doesn't seem like they would give time options if you still had to time yourself.  The workout was great, but I was sore afterwards.  Next time I will set an alarm so that I know when I can stop.  This odd flaw would not stop me from buying the DVD's again.

I have some yoga experience and really liked these workouts.  I felt like I learned something new and hearing that Bethenny was struggling to hold a pose made me feel better about my quivering legs.",1357862400,14,1203,4.463302752293578

5256632,5,B0093URNL2,"Fantastic workouts! I prefer yoga workout just because I love yoga. I used to do Jillian Michael's workouts and realized they made me extremely aggressive and I was not balanced out, because she IS aggressive. I don't need the military approach. What I want to say is that I am not a beginner but the yoga workout is challenging enough. It's also a lot of fun and the chatting is funny and doesn't bother me at all. I didn't try the other workout (with Kristin) but I have Kristin's Pilates DVD which is very good as well.",1424995200,,522,4.391752577319588

5256635,5,B0093URNL2,"I have always ""worked out""....aerobics, running, strength training. I am 53 and wanted to add some low impact work outs to maintain flexibility and tone my muscles. I wanted something I could be more consistent with. I often don't have an hour to exercise, so this really ""fits the bill"". I can do a 15 minute work out, or do the entire tape for almost an hour. The moves are not difficult, but you will feel and see results. I still do an aerobic work out  twice a week, but have added this yoga tape when I am crunched for time. Bethenny makes it fun and doesn't make me feel like I have to do everything  ""perfectly"". When I do some of the stretches.....my knees are bent a little....but it's OK. Hoping to improve on that:)",1416182400,,727,4.338235294117647

5256642,4,B0093URNL2,"I love that this comes with both DVDs.  Bethenny makes the workouts enjoyable with her commentary and I like that you can tell some poses are hard for her, as well.  I'm easily defeated with workout videos when I can't do some of the moves and the instructors are just cruising through as though it's as easy as breathing.  I feel more confident and at ease with these DVDs.  I'm a yoga beginner and about 20lbs overweight, so there are some moves that are more difficult for me, but I don't get discouraged as I usually do with other videos.  I also enjoy that you can choose the length of your workout depending on the amount of time you have to complete the workout.  That's an awesome feature!  My one negative would be that the pace is a bit faster than I would like it, but not so fast that you can't enjoy it.  This is a must for any beginner or anyone who wants to have an easy (but effective) workout.",1410307200,,910,4.25

5256648,5,B0093URNL2,I am a beginner and this workout is great. It's easy to follow along and the instructor explains each move. Bethenny works along side the instructor and shows a few versions of her moves. It is also challenging and I feel I get a good workout.,1398297600,,243,4.304347826086956
5256649,1,B0093URNL2,"This would be a great DVD if Bethenny Frankel would just not talk. She is not funny, and I feel like she ruins the work out! I don't understand how people in these reviews think she's entertaining.",1395360000,2,197,4.351351351351352

The work out is great and feels wonderful!!
Both DVD's worth on different areas of the body and you feel it, but you don't have to work too hard if you don't feel like it.
A must for Yogi beginners.

The only negative about these videos is how much talking there is.
Bethenny is a chatter box, so be prepared.",1373587200,,326,4.09375
5256656,5,B0093URNL2,"These DVDs have great workouts. It's nice that the workouts are broken down into modules so that you can choose what you want to do. For example, I skipped to section 2 on the Skinnygirl Workout yesterday because I was already warmed up from a bike ride and I added the additional stretching section to the end. Both of the yoga instructors are great and give good directions with modifications. I wanted to title this review ""Great workout for cynical people,"" or something similar. If you're looking for chi and relaxation, this isn't for you. If you're looking for a workout, this is totally for you. If you get bored during yoga, this is a good set of DVDs because Bethenny cracks jokes and isn't afraid to comment on things hurting or wanting to take a break. I'd rented Skinnygirl Workout from the library and knew I wanted to buy it. I'm glad I got the set because I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed Body by Bethenny.",1368403200,9,938,4.523529411764706
5256657,3,B0093URNL2,"I generally don't write reviews, but for this I had too.

First of all, it is a GREAT yoga workout.  I love the dual discs so I can switch it up everyday alternating between more intense to moderate days.  Has really strengthened me after one week.

Secondly, and this is the sad part. One of my discs CRACKED.  I was removing it from the case and it just snapped.  It is a VERY VERY cheap disc. I was so disappointed because I have only had this for about a week! I have had dvds for YEARS and never have had them break, crack, or scratch.  I take very good care of my discs so I was very disappointed in the quality of these discs.",1367798400,2,633,4.056451612903226
8535433,1,B0093URNL2,"The Yoga is a nice workout, however, Bethany doesn't SHUT UP!!!  Let the instructor run the practice and just stand there and look skinny for motivation.

8535441,4,B0093URNL2,"I really enjoy doing both of these yoga routines.  The Skinnygirl workout is 50 minutes long (broken up into 2 15 minute practices and one 20) and is the more difficult of the two workouts.  The instructor is good.  I've been doing yoga for a while now and he explained some things about positioning of the feet and not shrugging the shoulders that I had never heard before.  There are a lot of balancing poses and even a bit of cardio in this practice. There is also a bonus 12 minute stretch which I did not try.  Bethenny drives me nuts in the one.  She chatters constantly and makes ridiculous comments.  She didn't add anything of value to this workout at all.  The Body by Bethenny workout is easier and shorter.  There are more traditional yoga poses and the pace is more relaxed than in the Skinnygirl workout.  This practice is 40 minutes long and there are also a couple of bonus workouts, a strength training workout for your arms (they use 5 pound weights) and a butt workout.  I have not tried to butt workout, but the strength training workout is good.  Bethenny is not as irritating in this one, but I really could have done without her in both of the workouts.  I think a beginner could do the Body by Bethenny practice with relative ease, but the Skinnygirl workout, in my opinion, is better suited for someone who is more advanced.",1431388800,,1349,4.479508196721311
