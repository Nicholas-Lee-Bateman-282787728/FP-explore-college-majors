8500122,3,B006KAPM0W,"In ""Trfico de menores"" from 1978 (AKA ""Orgie des Todes"", ""Enigma rosso"", ""Rings of Fear"", etc.), iconic Italian actor---Fabio Testi (""Il giardino dei Finzi Contini"" 1970), plays police-detective 'Gianni di Salvo', who is investigating the grisly murder of a teenage-girl from a prestigious (which is code-word for---""sinister-goings-on"") boarding school for girls. This was screenwriter Massimo Dallamano's third installment of his ""Schoolgirls in Peril"" series, started with 1972's ""Cosa avette fatto a Solange?"" (""What Have They Done to Solange?""). The typical giallo elements are all in place, except here; regardless of the various strange characters and usual plot-twists, it all becomes very predictable. The sub-plot of under-aged-girls-for-hire by rich and influential men comes as no surprise either, since this began with a series of ""gialli"" (the aforementioned title), and in other genres before that too. If anything, this is telling of a certain section of society (sick and depraved older-men), who like to prey on teenage-girls. This ""menace"" is probably---worse than ever!

The good things going for this one (less than 20 minutes into the film), there is a nice shower-scene: featuring curvaceous Spanish-beauty Silvia Aguilar (not to worry either, the actresses are all in their early twenties too). Beautiful German Helga Lin is also featured, alas, sans nudity. ""Giallo"" enthusiasts will want to add this one to their collection. This was an Italian, Spanish, and West German production, but it would be nice to have it in its original Italian language.

The DVD picture and sound quality is excellent, the film has been completely digitally restored. PAL format, English (dubbed), (German, German subtitles, no English subtitles), FFN, NR 83 mins.

Love and Peace,
