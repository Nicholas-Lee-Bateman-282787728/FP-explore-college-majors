220403,1,6300185451,"This DVD was the biggest dissapointment in recent memory. I remember seeing this special on Cinemax back in 1985. After receiving the DVD I was compelled to compare the audio to my video taped copy. The seventeen year-old VHS mono tape was superior in every way, audio wise, to the DVD. How can this be? The folks responsble for this DVD should be ashamed of this product. Still the performances by all involved are hard to resist. George Harrison never seemed to have more fun in his life and Carl himself seemed to be stoked by his all-star admireres. The video quality is not all that great either, but the horribly muddled sound contributes to an overall dissapointing purchase.",1023235200,6,682,4.739495798319328
220404,3,6300185451,"Like the reviwer below, I found that this new DVD had picture quality superior to the import DVD that has been available for a couple years (in Japan) but I too was rather disappointed in the sound quality. It's not as awful as the other reviwer might indicate, and it's certainly not unlistenable, but it's rather muddy.
Still, since this is the only way most folks can acquire this great old performance, it's still a worthy purchase. Perkins himself is in fine form, playing and singing like he's a kid. George Harrison nearly steals the show during his set, showing again how deftly he took his rockabilly lessons. Even Ringo Starr is in rare form, reminding us how he's one of the last breed of rock drummers that knows how to swing.
Don't miss watching and listening to the great lead guitar and vocal work of Dave Edmunds. His devotion to this genre is as genuine and thrilling as the old masters.
If there's one less-than-wonderful performance, it's by Eric Clapton. Not that the guitarist doesn't play well - he does, terrifically, but this isn't his genre. His quicksilver riffs clash with the swinging range of rockabilly. Still, he's clearly enjoying himself and his bandmates appreciate him - after all, this is a celebration, so no real complaint.
Anyhow - unless you have a multi-code player and money in your pocket for the Japanese code ""2"" or the Hong Kong code ""0"" editions, this is as good as you'll get for this show. If you enjoy the old rockabilly music and the players appearing here, this belongs in your library.",1022112000,3,1538,4.7
220405,5,6300185451,"I recorded this on VHS when Cinemax aired it in 1985.  I loved it then, and love it even more now that it's on DVD.

Carl Perkins owns a place in rock/rockabilly music history, but as is so common to the man, he played it low-key all his life.  Carl was so energized and into this session, and obviously SO touched by the affection and admiration that the ""youngsters"" had for him, and that vibe is evident throughout.  This show demonstrates how deep his influence was on so many players...most especially his good friend George Harrison.

As we know, George had shied away from concerts for a number of years, and so it was a thrill to see him at this show.  Of course it's now bittersweet to see playing with one of his idols, but George's joy is also so clear to see and hear.  Having George and Ringo singing and playing the Perkins' tunes they did as Beatles, and to be playing them with Carl...well, it just brought a big smile to my face.  And hey, don't get me wrong: Clapton, Dave Edmunds, Roseanne Cash, Lee Rocker and Slim Jim...it wasn't exactly amateur night!!

And now that this has been released on CD, I feel that Carl Perkins has gotten his due.  Rock on, you rockabilly cat!",1019692800,8,1193,4.406392694063927

Spirited performances from Perkins, Ringo, George Harrison, Eric Clapton (just a tad  less spirit from Eric but major league pickin' nontheless), Rosanne Cash  and the cast make this video an uplifting experience.  Would really like to  see this with dts surround.  As it is, you want to keep playing it  over........and over........and over.......  The audience gets into it in  the end; after watching the throngs gyrate in The Bee Gees One Night Only  and Tina from Amsterdam, one can't help but think this crowd has lost it's  sense of particiaption.  During the last three songs, however, some true  rock and rollers circa 1955 take to the floor for some serious juice.  Awfully good stuff! And, you're going to really love Carl and his  supporting crew giving tribute to Jerry Lee Lewis and 'Whole Lota Shakin'  Goin' On'.  This video dates to a performance fifteen years ago.

220480,5,6300185451,"This is a wonderful session in honor of one of the founding fathers of rock and roll -- The music is superbly played by a great band containing personnel - not only with a high recognition factor (Harrison, Clapton, Starr, etc...) - but by people who were indirectly mentored by Perkins and profess a deep respect and admiration for the music and the man...Perkins himself more than holds his own on the guitar and has the strongest vocal performance.  Members of the Stray Cats blend their strong rockabilly sense with the star power of Clapton, Dave Edmunds and the ex-Beatles -- all of whom contribute strongly to a session that rocks harder as it progresses.

I got the VHS version when I heard that the DVD transfer was ostensibly a bit runny with an inferior sound...Whether or not that's true, the VHS picture is clean and the sound very good...Since this was meant as an hour TV special, there aren't many extras, except for a brief introductory tribute by Jerry Lee Lewis, Roy Orbison and Johnny Cash...No matter...The best advice that I can give is to pop it in the tape player, sit back and watch it straight through...and to pick up the audio CD, which provides me with some of the best traveling music while I'm driving.",1191369600,2,1233,4.651376146788991
220481,5,6300185451,"This is one of the best music specials ever made. I remember watching on TV when it was first shown and recorded and watched it over and over and over. Below are the tracks and featured artists:

To pick highlights is very difficult because its all great. But for me the rare appearance of George Harrison is an absolute treat. Eric Clapton plays some truly blistering guitar solos, that put all the other guitar players into the shade, and Carl Perkins admits as much himself.

However it is Carl Perkins who is the star of the show and its great to see him in prime form. My only reservation is the picture quality which is OK but could be a lot better.

It was incredible to say the least to see Carl Perkins in fine form along with George Harrison, Ringo Starr, and Eric Clapton. They were all young, good looking, and at the top of their game and full of fun and excitement to be there for one of their great friends & mentors. I can recommend the VHS format for sound and my picture was great although somebody should do this thing right on DVD to save it for posterity.

So let me be very clear - the show itself is above and beyond 5 stars. I want to instead rant and rave about the mediocre audio quality of this particular dvd transfer here. Anybody who doesn't complain never owned the VHS before, and so of course they must think the sound can't get any better. It CAN. The picture on the dvd is fine, the audio is not terrible, but OH, if you had the VHS before, you'd know what you're missing. I thought I just had ungrateful amateur ears until a) I looked on the second page and started seeing that other people were complaining about the sound on this dvd and 2) sellers are still selling the VHS at full price here on amazon because a lot of people must be complaining about the dvd quality. I assumed I would see a bunch of penny listings, but it's going to be worth it to me to buy the vhs back for $10-15 and transfer it to dvd, and now beg Eric Clapton and his people, Olivia Harrison and her people, Carl's family, Ringo - somebody - RE-RELEASE THIS AS A SPECIAL EDITION DVD WITH OUTTAKES AND LOADS OF SPECIAL FEATURES AND, ABOVE ALL, REMASTER THAT AUDIO.

220488,5,6300185451,"Much has already been said in review of this DVD. So I won't repeat it over and over again....BUT:

I was surfin' the net the other night looking for a good old photo of Carl Perkins. (the original rock superstar). I happened across a grainy, faded shot of Carl onstage with George Harrison, Eric Clapton and Ringo Starr. The first thing that occured to me was that I needed to see if this was a good concert and was there a DVD (or even VHS) available.

I found it here on Amazon and read the outstanding reviews.... So I bought it....

LORDY, MAMA....!!! THIS CONCERT BLEW ME AWAY................!!!!!

Sure it's packed with superstars........and they all played really great.....(Trust me on this.... My wife calls me ""Mr. Fussy"").....So what if Ringo sings lyrics in any order he pleases... Who notices that stuff but me and a few other anal retentive types anyway.

What matters is the tremendous heart that is embodied in this, THE GREATEST, MOST RADIO ACTIVE, THERMO NUCLEAR, ROCKABILLY MIND BLAST ever put on tape.

Yes, it's grainy.... and the sound isn't digitally remastered or digitally computer circumcized by espresso sipping engineers........ THAT'S WHAT'S SO COOL ABOUT IT....!!!

It is unvarnished, pure 100% unadultered rock'n'roll joy...

If you are a rock-n-roll junkie of ANY age.... If you loved The Killer, Roy Orbison, Lil' Richard Penniman or anyone of that ilk. THIS CONCERT IS A MUST SEE.

It's EVERYBODY at their best... When Eric, George, Dave Edmunuds, Ringo, Roseann Cash and everyone else sit down in folding chairs and their idol (Carls Perkins) leads them in a real old time jam session... It is a sight to behold..... It's history in the making.

This thing RULES.

While watching the finale of ""Blue Suede Shoes"" I began thinking about the fact that Carl and George are both up in heaven. I just broke down and cried.... God bless them both. Thanks for the great memories.

Congrats also to Dave Edmunds... Super player, super concert producer.....

DON'T MISS OUT ON THIS PHENOMENAL CONCERT.

God Bless Carl Perkins.... God Bless rock-n-roll.

220519,5,6300185451,"I borrowed this video from my uncle ten years ago while still in high school.  Needless to say, I was blown away like the other reviewers here. What I thought was gonna be an average show by an aging rocker past his prime turned out to be the most enjoyable concert video I've seen to this day! This is Carl Perkins' finest hour, and it is a special show that vividly captures the driving beat, heart, and spirit of early rock n' roll. The music here, wonderfully directed by Dave Edmonds, is as vibrant and infectious as rock n' roll gets!

This is the kind of rare show we desperately need more of in American music today. It is everything that today's music is not. There are no angry thugs shouting offensive lyrics in your face, no scantily-clad girls gyrating across the stage to compensate for a lack of musical ability, no twangy morons in cowboy hats singing about a tractor being sexy, and no manufactured pop clones who aren't allowed to play instruments or write their own songs.  What we have here instead, is one blissful hour of the most spirited performances and hottest guitar playing you will see from a group of rock n' roll legends on one stage.  When all is said and done, this will stand as one of the best rock n' roll specials ever captured on film!

You can't help but like Carl Perkins after watching this video. Not only does he sing and play better than you've ever heard him before, but the warmth and sincerity of the man really shine here as he showers each and every guest with kind words of praise. What makes this concert so special to me is how Carl's spirit and enthusiasm brings out the best in everybody on the stage.  Rarely have these guys performed with a greater sense of joy and passion which makes this a treat to watch!

George and Ringo sound more inspired here than they did with the Beatles, and watching Eric Clapton unleash some of the most ELECTRIFYING solos he has ever played is worth the price of the video alone! Clapton literally sets the stage on fire with his guitar playing on ""Mean Woman Blues"", and Carl's amazed reaction to Eric is priceless! If Clapton was the best guitarist on the stage that night, Perkins was certainly the best singer. His voice had matured since the 1950's and he clearly outsings all of his guests. The soul and feeling in his voice comes out in every song.

This video is pure musical joy from start to finish, but the best is saved for last in a truly dynamic performance of ""Blue Suede Shoes"" that is nothing more than rock n' roll at its joyful best!! The audience is up dancing all over the place as everybody on stage rocks their hearts out!  George Harrison is so caught up in the music that he suddenly leads the band into a rousing encore of the song.  Dave Edmonds sums up the electricity of the moment as he turns to Carl and shouts ""ROCK IT MAN!"". Perkins is moved to tears of gratefulness after sharing such a special night with his peers, and the total lack of arrogance from this rock n' roll legend is truly admirable.

The music world lost a fine musician and human being when Carl Perkins passed away in 1998.  This unforgettable show will stand as a great tribute to his spirit, music, influence, and talent. If you love Chuck Berry's ""Hail Hail Rock n' Roll"" or Roy Orbison's ""Black and White Night"", this will be a priceless addition to your collection!",1146096000,5,3360,4.463295269168026
220520,5,6300185451,"Wow!

When i first watched this is the spring of 1999, I had tears in my eyes for much of the concert. On the second viewing, five days later, I still had moist eyes. This was almost too good to be true! I couldn't believe what I was seeing and hearing.

Now that I've watched this numerous times, I don't get emotional but I still love it. This is old-time rock 'n roll (""rockabilly,"" to be exact) at it's best with rocking short songs that if they don't make you tap your feet and get just about everything else moving on you, then you check yourself for a pulse. Only a couple of the 17 songs are slow, and they are decent, but the last few songs really cook and that's basically what this is - an hour of feel- good rock.

Carl Perkins, one of rock's early but lesser-known pioneers, still can sing here (he died a few years later) and play his guitar well. He also comes across as a genuinely nice guy. Perhaps that is what drew George Harrison out for his first concert appearance in 15 years. Perkins had tons of respect and love among rock musicians.

Ringo Starr is here to sing and play some drums; Dave Edmunds, a good friend of Harrison's and a decent performer in his own right, is here. So, too, is bass player Lee Rocker, who is animated and fun to watch....and then there is Eric Clapton, who is simply outstanding and even has Perkins shaking his head almost in disbelief at his guitar playing.

The finale was Perkins' famous ""Blue Suede Shoes,"" and was really nostalgic with the host and then several of the other performers taking turns singing it. You could just feel the warmth between Perkins and all his guests. They loved the man. This is just rock 'n roll heaven!  Great to have it on DVD.",1145232000,4,1715,4.34375
220521,5,6300185451,"This is a great show honoring the great Carl Perkins.  I actually recorded this on VHS when it was aired on TV during the late '80's.

Highlights for me, like the others who have reviewed it, are Ringo and George who are clearly having a blast singing and playing with one of their heroes.  Everyone's love and admiration for Carl P. is obvious and very moving.  Final note:  I agree with some others who have opined that this show captures the best playing Clapton has done in the past 25 years, or more.  I know it's heresy to say that he usually bores me.  Maybe he came to life here because of Carl's presence, or maybe I just like him a lot better playing rockabilly. Regardless, this is a show for Carl, a true founding father of rock & roll, and, like him, it's a great one.",1143504000,2,781,4.272108843537415

In fact buy two in case you lose one. Watching these cats trade licks and vocals across the tiny stage just TAKES YOUR HEAD OFF, and the love that flows between the artists for their hero is deeply touching. Dave Edmunds is brilliant. Roseanne Cash puts

most other ""rock chicks"" to absolute shame. Perkins' voice is sterling and beautiful, Clapton's solos are just SEARING, Ringo proves he's one hell of a drummer and extremely cool vocalist, George is a joy. Just watching him stare in wonderment as Carl plays a little tribute to Les Paul is worth the price of the disc alone. This just MIGHT be the greatest rock and roll set ever put on DVD.

220526,5,6300185451,"As an inveterate, avid, intense Beatle fan, I was thoroughly delighted with this dvd!  Hats off to Carl Perkins not only for being a driving force during the inception of Rock & Roll, but for influencing George Harrison!  George Harrison ROCKED!  He tore the place up with his guitar playing!  If you think he sounded phenomenal on this dvd, be sure to listen to ""Beatles Live at the BBC"" and George's guitar playing sets the place on fire!  Check him out on ""Youngblood!""

Although the transfer ain't great, the music and the artists are.  Ringo keeps a steady beat and his former bandmate, the nonpareil George Harrison will have you rockin' your blue suede shoes or your Beatle boots off!  His revival of his 1965 cover of ""Everybody's Trying to Be My Baby"" brought many smiles to many faces.  Gear up that 1963 Ford Falcon and take a trip to 1965 with George!

If you love Rock & Roll, the Blues and some EXCEPTIONAL guitar playing, this is the dvd for you.  It is just plain fun and you will find yourself singing along with it and don't be surprised if you find you've started dancing!",1117152000,8,1091,4.51530612244898
220527,5,6300185451,"I have just received this DVD and cannot stop playing it. As a fan of the Beatles when I was a kid I have heard tunes on this that I haven't listened to since 1966! And they're fun to hear again. I agree with the previous reviewers, this is a very poor, runny, VHS transfer. It was taken from an HBO series that was screened world-wide (yes even here in Australia!) in the mid-1980s. The sound is OK, but it really sounds ""Live"" if you know what I mean. The colour is also very runny and there are a few drop outs captured on the disc. Even the cover photo on the case is out of focus! Oh well this was 20 years ago but the content is pure fun.

 The late George Harrison, who was a great Perkins fan, comes across well but his playing is down in the mix, his cool red Gretch Guitar looks the part. His version of ""Everybody's Trying To Be My Baby"" brought back a lot of memories! Clapton probably plays better on this DVD than any in the last 20 years except his Guitar Festival appearence last year. Ringo Starr does a great rendition of ""Honey Don't"" (Done by the Beatles in 1965, 11 years after the Perkins original at Sun). Perkin's strange and controversial chord progession on this tune is what makes it so different and wonderful (see the section about this on the ""Good Rockin' Tonight"" DVD).

Carl Perkins was an innovator. He was from Tennessee and came to Memphis with a plethora of new ideas from country and blues music. He was a different type of rock musician. He was once marked to be  bigger than Elvis (hence Jerry Lee Lewis' opening comments) but was hampered by a car crash in the early touring days and poor marketing by Sam Phillips and then others. However, like Albert King in blues, players and purists knew talent and the real thing. His beat and style of incorporating shuffles into country-rock grooves (rockabilly) was truly cool. Also he liked to use blues ideas hence we hear hints of Arthur ""Big Boy"" Crudup,  Blind Lemon Jefferson and others in his tunes. He was a gifted guitarist as well. Listen to his playing with George Harrison when he emulates the echo effect he heard Les Paul do in the early 1950s without any effects but his fingers! Extraordinary!

Lastly, this series should be remixed and released as a set. There are several great perfromances in the ""A Session"" concerts. The best, to me, is BB King's ""A Blues Session"" with Albert King, SRV, Paul Butterfield, Eric Clapton and others. The ""Soul Session"" has James Brown with Wilson Pickett, Aretha Franklin and others. When will these be released? (An update: both of these have just been released in 2005. They are also pretty poor in picture quality but they are fantastic and have very rare performances like the late Robert Palmer on ""Soul Session"" and Paul Butterfield and Albert King on ""Blues Session"". Get all three!!!)

Get this DVD it is delightful, fun to watch, has great playing and is historical. It's a little more pricey than the average Amazon DVD, but it's worth having!!",1113782400,15,2989,4.534322820037106

Eric Clapton, George Harrison & Ringo Starr do much more than just turn out to add ""megastar"" interest as they're quickly swept up by the electric atmosphere of the evening and, along with Dave Edmunds, Rosanne Cash and a host of others, become part of a hugely talented backing group who are clearly having the time of their lives playing along with a rock legend on top form. Carl Perkins signs off after the final, spine-tingling rendition of ""Blue Suede Shoes"" with tears of pure joy streaming down his face - music doesn't get more ""real"" or exciting than this.",1086393600,8,788,4.759124087591241
220570,4,6300185451,This DVD is absolutely fantastic!  It is must have for any Rockabilly fan.  I would have given it 5 stars if not for the sound that is disappointing like others have mentioned.  There has to be a good recording of this somewhere and I hope it is released someday soon.  Even with the sound issues I would recommend this DVD strongly,1074729600,3,332,4.39344262295082
220571,5,6300185451,"With George Harrison, Ringo Starr, Eric Clapton and Dave Edmunds joining Carl Perkins for some rollicking fun you know this has to be a great DVD!  George is great on ""Everybodys Trying to Be My Baby"" and looks to be having more fun than he did with The Beatles.  Ringo is great on ""Honey Dont"".  And Eric Clapton throws in some scorching licks throughout!  Carl Perkins is a terrific rockabilly pioneer and a major influence on rock and roll.  Buy this DVD, put it on, turn up the volume and be prepared to have some fun!",1069804800,4,522,4.395833333333333
220572,5,6300185451,"My buddy Bob & I have probably watched this thing 40 times.  Carl was a really decent man and a great guitar picker.  The fact that George Harrison, Eric Clapton, Ringo, Dave Edmunds, 2 Stray Cats & Rosanne Cash are all there doesn't hurt either.  Get the DVD, a fridge full of beers, call Dominos, [turn] it up and be prepared to watch it 3 times.",1061510400,3,348,4.242424242424242
220573,5,6300185451,"Truly a masterpiece. Carl Perkins truly is one of the greatest early original rock-n-roll/rock-a-billy masters. The supporting cast is truly a tribute to Carl Perkins and his influence on their music. It is one of the best dvd's I have purchased. Ranks highly with The Bands ""Last Waltz"", and Roy Orbison ""Black and White Night"". A must have for any rock fan.",1048204800,4,359,4.806451612903226

IT'S FRUSTRATING, THAT I CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT THIS. I WILL HOWEVER, LOOK AND SEE WHO PRODUCED THIS EFFORT AND NOT BUY AGAIN FROM THESE PEOPLE. THEY SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES.

220575,4,6300185451,"Yet ANOTHER GREAT DVD, that Ringo is in.  The case is a little misleading, as not everybody pictured actually perform.  However this is STILL a must have.  George Harrison does several, including one of Carl's that Carl forgot all the words to.  Carl still looks good, plays good, sings good, and still has that ""good-old-boy"" persona.  The end of this disk made me get a little weepy-eyed.  This is a piece of history, along with Roy Orbison's Black and White Night, and Ringo's All Star Band.",1027987200,,494,4.686046511627907
220576,5,6300185451,"This is simply one of, if not the best music videos ever. On one stage you have Carl, George Harrison, Clapton, Dave Edmunds, Ringo, all obviously having  a great time. It's a very personal tribute to Perkins from his greatest admirers. This is one video that delivers on its promises. Carl was a huge influence on George and Ringo. A gem.

220577,5,6300185451,"THERE ARE MANY ADJECTIVES TO DESCRIBE THIS DISC. BUT FOR NOW I'LL CALL IT MESMORIZING. THIS DISC BELONGS IN EVERY MUSIC CLASS IN THE WORLD. IT FEATURES THE ARCHITECT OF ROCK-A-BILLY MR CARL PERKINS. (ELVIS BUILT THE FOUNDATION.BUT CARL BUILT UPON IT.) AND BOY WAS IT EVER A GRANDIOS BUILDING. ONE OF THE MANY AMAZING ASPECTS OF THIS PROGRAM IS HOW LISTINABLE IT IS. THIS IS WHAT THE REPEAT FUNCTION WAS CREATED FOR. IT MOVES YOU TO THE CORE OF YOUR SOUL AND NEVER LETS YOU GO. THERE IS AN IMPRESIVE GUEST LIST AND THEY ALL DEFER TO CARL. AND WE ARE TALKING ABOUT GIANTS HERE. HOW DOES ERIC CLAPTON, GEORGE HARRISON, RINGO STARR, AND DAVE EDMONNS AMONG OTHERS SOUND.?

220578,5,6300185451,"If you like Carl Perkins, George Harrison, Ringo Starr, Eric Clapton, Rosanne Cash and Dave Edmunds, buy this DVD. Perkins is in top form here, as are all of the participants. His skills as a mature stage performer, guitarist, and singer are on full display. George Harrison sings and plays up a storm, too - if you love George's music, that's enough reason to buy this disc. A suprise favorite for me was Rosanne Cash's brief set, including a vocal duet with Perkins on ""Jackson."" It's all great music and great fun.",1024790400,4,517,4.630434782608695

7804408,5,6300185451,Great DVD. Carl & the fellow performers put their heart & soul into the mix. You can feel the love that pours out. If you like that good ol'e Rockabilly this is a trophy to keep. The visual is definitely not of Blu-ray quality but is never an issue since the performance takes you off your feet.,1366761600,,295,4.192982456140351
7804409,5,6300185451,"This concert bristles with excitement, talent and gives anyone an insight into what makes Carl and these musicians so revered. There is an incredible vibe and Dave Edmunds, as musical director, delivers, unselfishly and deliberately, a musical platform for Carl that is simply perfect. It's a thrill to watch the exchange of guitar licks, supported by a relentless infectious rhythm throughout. It lifts my heart to watch and to listen to such obvious enjoyment and skills of George, Eric, Ringo and Dave - love the Roseanne Cash performance too! Put into rock music perspective, it's a nostalgic trip that echoes Lennon's ""You Should Have Been There"" quotation! The best tribute DVD that sets the standard for capturing pure joy and celebration of this truly under-estimated genius of rock and roll! Free spirits running wild in a celebration!",1349481600,,844,5.1678832116788325

he was the one the beatles and everybody followed not Elvis.
Since my Pop died and taking over his record collection I started
one of my own and Carl Perkins is top of the list! I have nothing
more to add that others didn't say but this is one of the best

Although I'm a huge Perkins fan, the best part of this video for me , was seeing how much George Harrison was enjoying paying tribute to his good friend.

7804415,1,6300185451,I purchased this DVD - Carl Perkins and Friends - Blue Suede Shoes: A Rockabilly Session which was released in 2002. Another DVD called Blue Suede Shoes was released in 2006. I knew the DVD's were exact but I figured the covers were different. When it was shipped I found out it was the exact DVD and cover which I already had from the 2006 release. The DVD is awesome but you need to advertise the correct cover. This DVD shipped was the same cover as the Blue Suede Shoes cover released in 2006.,1212019200,3,497,4.297872340425532
