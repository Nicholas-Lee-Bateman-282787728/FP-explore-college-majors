8200584,5,B000RGI7SO,"Being a N-Scale model railroader as well as a steam fan, I have always had interest in the Cab Forwards.
This video shows all variations of the Cab Forwards with plenty of great film footage.
And their special sounds is captured great including their own wheezing sound from the pumps which they alone had.
Makes running all my N Cab Forwards more exciting now on my layout.",1407024000,,374,4.597014925373134

8200586,1,B000RGI7SO,The DVD they sent us was defective.  It would not play the entire video and would stop in the middle of the scene. I've emailed and called Train Video Depot and no one has gotten back to me. Be careful when ordering from Train Video Depot!!!,1352937600,2,241,4.239130434782608
