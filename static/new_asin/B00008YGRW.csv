1871518,5,B00008YGRW,"This is one of the best television series I have seen in a long time.  I know the show has its detractors, saying that it resorts to gratuitous sex and violence too much, but I feel that it is a valid portrayal of police officers fighting real life crime in the mean city streets.  Every episode had me sitting on the edge of the seat the entire time, wondering what would happen next.  That is what makes this such a great show, you can't possibly predict where it will go next.  I am very much anticipating the release of the DVD set this october.",1050278400,4,549,4.25
1871519,5,B00008YGRW,"This is the greatest show ever made.  Every week you find yourself stopping everything around you and you have to watch this show.  The first season was awesome and the second season did not disappoint. This is the first time in years that I have found that everyone who has the talk ""around the water cooler"" wants to talk about the show when it was on the night before.  Hands down best thing ever to hit the small screen!",1049414400,7,424,4.341772151898734
1871520,5,B00008YGRW,"I first started watching the shield when it won the award, but the first time i watched it it was not because of the award but by chance. since then i have not missed a single episode from the second season. the second season was very tense in the sense that you get sucked up in all the problems faced in the episodes. you get to experience things that would seem imposible to get out of, like a murder or money laundering. i would recomend this DVD because the acting from all the people in the series is great and shows that non-recognized actors can take the steps of hollywood anyday!.",1049155200,4,590,4.324324324324325
1871521,5,B00008YGRW,"Only when I thought this show could bot get any better --- it did. Not only did it get better, it got absolutly riveting. Not only have the characters developed further, the enemies have too. Things have changed in ""The Shield"" over the course of its second season, and all for the better.
It has become much more unpredictable. What was thought to be the seasons big bad guy, actually gets what a sane audience would want, his death in the worst way. He got it. Vic has gotten somewhat out of the rut he was in last season, but it is constantly huanting him with the presence of Claudette, a fellow detective. Not only does she know of his past, she knows how to take him down. But she knows without him, the presinct would fall.
The strike team is running and is more action packed than ever. Now with a new fifth member, things get more interesting on each bust.
Vics personal side gets more screwed up with every episode. Now his wife, again, has basically banished him from the house, his duaghter no longer cares for him, and his son has slipped further into autism.
If you watch this show, you know why it won a Emmy and two Golden Globes. This defines great TV. Hopefully the DVD is as good as the last one, maybe with somE more interesting menus please? Fox, this time you have no excuse about ""not enough time"".",1049068800,18,1321,4.373983739837398

1871605,5,B00008YGRW,"Great series. Why did it ever end. Michael Jace really messed up. Difficult to watch him on TV he portrayed a hollier than tho god fearing man on the show but look what he did.

1871643,5,B00008YGRW,It's kinda creepy because I knew of a police officer kinda like Vic Mackey where I used to live.  The 2nd Season picks up where Season 1 leaves off and doesn't miss a beat.  Wherever there's bad guys you'll find the strike team not far behind kickin ass and most likely stealing their money and drugs.,1375747200,,301,4.357142857142857
1871644,5,B00008YGRW,Even more awesome than the first season.  Mackey and his team of gorilla thugs beat the streets of Farmington in this action packed and riveting thriller of a season.,1374451200,,166,4.724137931034483
1871645,5,B00008YGRW,Watch it.....you won't turn it off. Gritty and violent. Micheal Chiklis plays the best good-bad cop of all time. Excellent series to keep and watch over.,1372723200,,153,4.923076923076923
1871646,5,B00008YGRW,"This show just gets better with each season, not for the faint of heart though.
If you like police dramas I highly recommend this one as it's one of the best.
Great writing and characterization are this shows strengths, but the writing can also be its downfall at times with outlandish plots sometimes, but when this show hits it hits good and hard, making up for some of the few absurdities.",1370995200,,392,4.535211267605634
1871647,2,B00008YGRW,I purchased all 7 seasons of The Shield that were advertised as NEW.  All were fine except season 2 and 4.  Seasons 2 and 4 DVDs had cloudy patches and scraches on all of them that leads me to believe they were used previously.,1367366400,,227,4.136363636363637
1871648,5,B00008YGRW,"I ordered these DVDs over six years ago, and the show has been off the air for almost five, but I still feel compelled to say that, start to finish, this is unquestionably one of the greatest, most well-executed, most compelling TV shows ever made. Most current shows worth watching owe it a debt of gratitude. All hail Vic Mackey.",1366243200,,331,4.533333333333333
1871649,5,B00008YGRW,"Fascinating plots, characters, etc. Sure beats the drivel we are fed from the dumbed down TV producers of today. .",1365379200,,114,4.75
1871650,2,B00008YGRW,"I thought the season of the Shield was great, couldn't watch the 2nd disk due to a break which caused it to skip.  Other than that I would have given it a 5 stars.",1363737600,,163,3.7941176470588234
1871651,5,B00008YGRW,"Outstanding.  I watched The Shield when it was on television, but forgot alot of what had happened. Now I can enjoy it whenever I want.",1357776000,,135,4.4
1871672,5,B00008YGRW,I just found The Shield this year and so far I have watched seasons 1-5 and they are great and I would recommend this to everyone to watch! Just a great show!,1345507200,,158,3.96875
1871673,5,B00008YGRW,Bought as a gift for a fan of the show. They loved it! So if you are a fan I recommend it!,1341446400,,90,3.1363636363636362
1871674,5,B00008YGRW,"This season of THE SHIELD ramps up the tension as the protagonist, Vic Mackey's personal life crumbles when his wife & children run away leaving him foundering a bit at work while a civilian auditor observing the unit causes Captain Aceveda to form an uneasy alliance with Vic to further his political aspirations.  Detective Claudette Wymms (the exceptional C.C.H. Pounder) suspects this unholy alliance and begins to investigate Vic while trying to bolster her partner, Dutch's confidence after he screws up a case.  Meanwhile Dani faces harassment after a justifiable shooting while her partner, Julian becomes involved with a single mother to prove to himself that he is not gay; the Strike Team is greenlit by a Mexican gang leader after they try to run him out of Farmington and FINALLY the Strike Team plots a rip-off of an Armenian money train.

Whew - now that's a LOT of storylines within a 13-episode season but that is the brilliance of this show - their ability to act out this multi-arc format in such a fast paced fashion. As a viewer I found myself easily engrossed in this show - I would try to allow myself 2 or 3 episodes per viewing but watched the entire season in one sitting.

This set is also packed with featurettes that give insight into the creator's mindset as well as a few of the directors and the star, Michael Chiklis (Vic Mackey); but honestly this series would not be what it is without the OUTSTANDING supporting cast including:  Benito Martinez (Capt Aceveda); Catherine Dent (Dani); Michael Jace (Julian); Jay Karnes (Dutch) and Walton Goggins (Shane)and the aforementioned, C.C.H. Pounder (Det Wymms).

If you (like me) had never seen the series when it originally ran, try to see or buy the first 3 seasons - you will be on the edge of your seat by the end of the 3rd!",1326499200,,1807,4.720634920634921
1871675,5,B00008YGRW,"This series just keeps getting better! Saw the season opener and immediately went and ordered season 3 just to make sure I get it in time so I don't have to wait to see what happens!  If you liked the first season, nothing changes here!",1300665600,,236,4.2444444444444445

1871677,4,B00008YGRW,"This season was just as gritty as the first. Vic Mackey and his Strike Team are back with a vengeance. This season takes place about a month after the original. Vic is trying to find his wife and kids while he and his team plans to rob an Armenian money laundering operation. Throughout the season, each character have their own share of problems. Julien gets married, but is still haunted by his past. Captain Aceveda makes choices that could alter his career, and much more. I highly recommend THE SHIELD: THE COMPLETE SECOND SEASON!!!",1286496000,,537,4.723404255319149

1871679,5,B00008YGRW,This series in it's entirety is a must have for anyone who loves cop dramas and action!  there is a great lesson within this series!  This series cinematography was amazing the writing was phenomenal and the series is brilliant. i highly recommend this series! I've been a fan for years!,1273536000,,287,4.72

1871712,5,B00008YGRW,Kept me glued to the TV til I went through the whole season. Very intense and nail biting.,1256342400,,90,4.055555555555555

1871714,5,B00008YGRW,"Having been a fan of the series, I purchased season I. Seeing follow up seasons at a sale price I will add 1 or 2 a month as I can afford to. Michael Chiklis, the somewhat soft roly poly, Police Commissioner from the ABC series ""The Commish"", shaved his head, buffed up and learned to swear, making this show a hot satelite dish prime time product. The interaction between the characters and good casting and writing make this a worthwhile show and a good buy for your video library",1246924800,,482,4.426966292134831
1871715,5,B00008YGRW,Great show! Never had time to watch it when it was on tv so I started watching it two weeks ago and can't get enough!!!!,1243209600,,120,3.84
1871716,5,B00008YGRW,"I'm glad I purchased this series.  I missed it when it was out!  Vic and company was off the hook, totally out of control.....from  Shield 1, episode one. I thought ""The Wire"" was bad.  Can you imagine living in those areas!  They all kinda tie in together, though,  from rogue cops to corrupt politicians. and sprinkled in between, is the ordinary citizen who has to put up with all that fraggle naggle. Phew!!!!",1240531200,,413,4.589041095890411
1871717,5,B00008YGRW,THis show completely suprised me. I really don't get into television shows but my boyfriend had me watch it and I am hooked!,1235865600,,124,4.434782608695652
1871718,5,B00008YGRW,"This second season creates the setup for the rest of the series, when Vic and the Strike Team boldly decide to tap into the ""money train.""  The problems this decision will cause the team, and the tensions amongst them and their families and the rest of the police force, creates some wonderfully complex, entertaining television.
In addition, Aceveda is a character that at times seems to be wearing the white hat, other times the black hat, but always with an agenda.  Whose side is he on, and for what reasons?
Vic's life in the meantime is in shambles, learning that his kids have autism, etc.
The Shield is an outstanding show.",1233100800,,631,4.675675675675675
1871719,5,B00008YGRW,After I watched Season 1 I thought that maybe I shouldn't buy Season 2.  There is no way Season 2 could top the first season.  Well it did.  Season 2 is great!  A must buy for a fan of the Shield!,1226448000,2,196,3.707317073170732
1871720,5,B00008YGRW,"I thought The Shield season 2 was a very good season and especially how it ended. One very intresting thing that happend during the end of this season was Vic and his strike robbing a money train that contained millions. To find out why this occured, buy this season and discover other shocking happenings. You will not regret buying this season.",1225584000,,346,4.688524590163935

Outstanding show!!! Can't wait to see more.",1214092800,,341,4.029411764705882
1871753,5,B00008YGRW,"This is one of the best TV DVD's I've ever bought.  Besides the show being incredible, the extras shine better than nearly any other TV DVD extras.  You won't find short, 5 minutes extras here, you'll find a good half hour and hour extras that make this product a delight to own and enjoy.  If you like the show, you really need to buy this DVD.",1209859200,,345,4.196969696969697
1871754,5,B00008YGRW,"Vic Mackey, played by Michael Chiklis is a phenomenal series that pushes the boundaries of primetime TV.  FX has been known for putting risque shows up, but The Shield takes the cake.

It is primarily about crooked cops in L.A., but you have a hard time hating them because they are so danged effective.  So, buy this series, and watch for Season 7, the final season coming to TV soon!",1206489600,,385,4.4714285714285715
1871755,5,B00008YGRW,"I had purchased The Shield, season 1 and enjoyed it thoroughly, therefore I ordered Season 2, while really not expecting it to measure up to # 1.
I was pleasantly surprised to find it of equal or better quality, and will order season #3",1192579200,,236,4.386363636363637
1871756,5,B00008YGRW,"This is just a fantastic series.  Every episode in the second season is action-packed and always entertaining.  If you liked the first season, you'll definitely like the second.

Buy? Of course!  This season is so good it demands you buy the third.",1191110400,,248,4.833333333333333
1871757,5,B00008YGRW,"I've seen every season of The Shield and no matter how great each season is, it seems the next one is even better. This is definately a one of a kind cop show, and by far the best in depth show I've ever seen!",1182124800,,209,3.772727272727273
1871758,5,B00008YGRW,"The Strike Team, led by Vic Mackey, has become the king of the asphalt jungle. The ""how"" comes in Episode 9, ""Co-pilot,"" explaining how The Barn began and how the satellite station works. It also shows how Vic wasn't necessarily ""questionable"" with his methods in the beginning and how he has become a big fish in a chaos-riddled pond by creating a veritable mob with a lovely badge to boot. This thing becomes emboldened by profits from various enterprises, by the sweet smell of success, and rumors of a beautiful Armenian enterprise simply called ""the money train.""

As a viewer I cannot stress just how good the show has gotten. It won a Golden Globe by this point for Best Drama Series and Micheal Chiklis won an Emmy/Golden Globe for Lead Actor in a Drama Series. It deserved it, too, because it affords audiences of all types (not all age-ranges) something to watch and doesn't just focus on a linear concept. Quite simply, you do not have to adjust your screen because the picture is indeed perfect.

As I'm writing this I just completed the sixth season and can say that it doesn't let up and that many of the things that happen in the 1st and 2nd season sculpt the landscape of things to come. (There are NO spoilers, either, so don't worry aobut reading on) This isn't meant to say that the show is driven by one thing, either, or that it isn't doesn't exist on more than one level. It instead says that the show rewards you, showing you the ironclad ways of an environment that constantly changes and yet remains - in part - the same. You have the main theme that run alongside Vic and his teammates as you see the line and how things blur because of things that are not easily divided into good/bad, and you see clashes of culture everywhere - especially in the department itself.  This is illustrated boldly when shown through Julein's eyes, addressing a conflict on an individual level and also working as a group dynamic, and it shows you just what a blanket party means when you know the person suffering. There are also the rules of the streets, the territories and the politics that run them, and the rules of the governing bodies that want to change them into something controllable for a variety of reasons. This, combined with interesting casework and one of the best illustrations of how profiling the traits of a killer - ala Dutch - works, makes for something that goes well beyond expectation. Some of the best acting I have ever watched comes from this show - even in the minor characters that appear and reappear - and connecting with the show becomes an addictive thillride that is not only watchable but also rewatchable as well.

Included in this season are all 13 episodes, some with audio commentary, 5 behind-the-scenes featurettes, 37 deleted scenes, and a preview of the videogame (not recommended) as its features.
For reference, the episodes are as follows: 1 - The Quick Fix, 2 - Dead Soldiers, 3 - Partners, 4 - Carte Blanche, 5 - Greenlit, 6 - Homewrecker, 7 - Barnstormers, 8 - Scar Tissue, 9 - CoPilot, 10 - Coyotes, 11 - Inferno, 11 - Inferno, 12 - Breakpoint, 13 - Dominoes Falling.
They all feed off each other, none wasting your time as a viewer and none attempting to feel the void between concepts. This is one of the most impressive things to me - normally a show has cracks in the facade but The Shield is solid from beginning to end.

Closing, I can't stress just how good this series is besides to say that I have only purchased five series in the thousand or so DVD purchases I've made and that this was one of the top picks I had to have in my collection. It comes highly recommended and will keep you wanting and watching and ready for the next season. When it comes you will do the same all over again, making for a unique experience.
I cannot sing its praise loudly enough.",1181692800,,3831,4.522366522366522

1871760,5,B00008YGRW,"Each episode of season 1 of The Shield had me glued to the TV.  A problem that a show like The Shield that starts out with a bang is the follow up season does not compare.  Glad to say, season 2 does not disappoint. There is a main story line which is resolved within the season (Armadillo) and one which carries through to the next season (Money Train) along with other stories which make this show one of the best on TV.

The DVD contains several extras, which include several features and some deleted scenes.  Unfortunately there are commentaries on only 1/3 of the episodes.  Wish they were on all of them. The DVD packaging (fold out) isn't that great compared to the later seasons more sturdy slim case packaging.",1176595200,,720,4.507692307692308

1871801,5,B00008YGRW,"The Shield is a series of the highest-order. I could use this review to compare Season 2 to Season 1 (or those that come later), but whatever their individual strengths or weaknesses, they are all great. The acting in the Shield, especially Chiklis, is phenomenal, and the plotlines are all hard-hitting.

I especially appreciate how nearly every main cast member gets their own plot arc which runs throughout the season, all tying up in the thrilling finale.

Specifically, this season deals with the crafty gang leader Armadillo who puts a hit out on Mackey and his strike team; Vic trying to keep his family from spiralling further apart; Dutch's dealing with his shortcomings as a detective; Julian's struggle against his homosexual nature; Captain Aceveda's compromising with Mackey's questionable methods in his pursuit of political success; Danny's being targeted by a civilian with a grudge; and, finally, the strike team's plot to rob the Armenian mob.

If you read the above list, which is not comprehensive, you'll realize that this season does a lot (especially given that it only runs 13 episodes long). Most television shows take much more time to achieve much less. This show does all of that with power, reality, emotion and offers three or four compelling crime-drama plotlines for all of its individual episodes, besides. Also, I should specifically mention that there is a ""prequel"" episode included, which takes place before the pilot episode. Pure brilliance.

The Shield is one of the best shows television has to offer. Its Second Season, however it might relate to the others, is a quality part of the series. Five stars.",1152403200,3,1645,5.0814814814814815

The overarching storyline of the season, for me at least, are the sacrifices Aceveda makes as he pushes to win the primary for Farmington City Council; the biggest of these is a you-watch-out-for-me-and-vice-versa deal with Mackey, which neither really intends to honor, but it's fun to watch them pretend.

The major story, of course, is that of the Money Train, rumored to be carrying the Armenian mob's entire West Coast cash haul, and the Strike Team's on-again, off-again plan to rip it off.

No fair to say whether or not is successful, but is sure IS fun to watch Mackey disfigure the hell out of a drug dealer who refuses to leave town.

What happens as a result, however, has serious ramifications for the entire Strike Team's future.

That was quickly remedied with a one-click on Amazon and two days later I had the second season in hand. During this season you are brought up on the quest to hijack The Money Train by the Strike Team, Capt. Acevada's quest for a City Council seat, the

further marital problems of Vic Mackey,the Civilian Auditor's report and the fallout from that and many, many sub plots that continue to swirl through this amazing series. There is no disappointment in the Second Season. Once again, I found myself watching the 13th episode and wondering where the time had gone and then scurring to the computer right after it finished to order the Third Season. The series is probably not for everyone. There is considerable violence, much bad language, and some conversations about sex and sexual orientation that are not for young ears, It is adult fare and it comes at you like a runaway freight train.

1871810,5,B00008YGRW,"Nominated for 4 Emmys and 4 Golden Globes, including Best Television Series - Drama, The Shield is one of the top police dramas of the past decade. The brainchild of creator Shawn Ryan, writer for such hit shows as Nash Bridges (1996) and Angel (1999), The Shield made history in 2003 by becoming the first basic cable series to win a Golden Globe for Best Drama Series (in the past, only non-ad supported shows such as The Sopranos and Sex And The City have done so well). The hour-long drama boasts a strong, well-rounded cast who, along with the writers/producers, have managed to make The Shield the longest running series on the FX Network...

The Shield centers around an inner-city Los Angeles police precinct where the lines between right and wrong are often blurred. An ongoing power struggle between a group of corrupt, yet effective, cops and their new boss, Capt. David Aceveda (Benito Martinez), remains the focal point of the show. Det. Vic Mackey (Michael Chiklis, of The Commish) heads up an elite unit known as the Strike Team. An effective leader who bends the rules when they fit his aims, Mackey often butts heads with the by-the-book Aceveda who weighs his own political ambitions against the cost of bringing down Mackey and his associates. Veteran Det. Claudette Wyms (CCH Pounder, of ER) knows the ropes, admires Mackey, but also knows how to play sides of the game. For the 2005 season, Glenn Close - star of such films as The Natural (1984), Fatal Attraction (1987), and Air Force One (1997) - joined the cast as Capt. Monica Rawling. Together, this celebrated cast maintains an internal tension among themselves while carrying out a unified fight against the criminal element - a fight that keeps the streets of L.A. safe...

The Shield (Season 2) DVD features a number of exciting episodes including the season premiere ""The Quick Fix"" in which Vic searches feverishly for the whereabouts of his wife and children. In his absence, the Strike Team allows a shipment of cocaine into Farmington that turns out to be bad, prompting the team to enter Tijuana in search of the culprits. Meanwhile, Detectives Wyms and Wagenbach attempt to solve a series of gangland assaults... Other notable episodes from Season 2 include ""Homewrecker"" in which Mackey, Wyms, and Wagenbach investigate several murders at a women's shelter, and ""Breakpoint"" in which Mackey secretly works with Dutch and Claudette to uncover the whereabouts of a missing kid...

The mistake that many cliffhanger season finales make is the conflict they propose is resolved within the first couple episodes of the next season.  The  tremors of the season 1 finale ripple through every last episode of the Shield's second season.  This collection of episodes features perhaps the most nefarious, most intelligent, and most engaging villain of the series thusfar in the drug and gang lord Armadillo.  We see Vic's theshold's pushed further than they ever were in season 1 and the results that follow.  The magnitudes of his personal conflicts force him to accept and forge an uneasy alliance with Aceveda - an alliance almost as dramatically engaging as Vic's new conflict in the precinct with Veteran detective Claudette Wymms.  There are few actors who can walk toe to toe with an intimidating Chilkis.  Benito Martinez brought such a prescence in the first season.

What I like about the second season of discs over the first is the addition of scenes from previous episodes to refresh the memory.  Very helpful and much appreciated.  Of all of the episodes I felt CO-PILOT was the weakest.  Though interesting it was a throw away.  I liked seeing the origin of the Strike Team, but I did not feel it rang true to the very first episode.  It implied that the malfeasance of the team only began a few days before the first episode, though the first episode implied their antics had been going on for quite some time.

Season two is more violent than season one and the Strike Team makes quite a few new enemies.  Teasing us with the Money Train throughout left me salivating at the end in anticipation of the big heist.  The more Mackey tries to start doing things right the more things get screwed up.  I'm even warming to Shane.

We've all been passing around THE SHIELD; first its first season, then its second.  And it hasn't lost any steam.  THE SHIELD still crashes and careens through the streets of L.A. like one of its wobbling-camera footchases, always managing to stun and electrify its audience.

Staying totally out of control.

I'll go as far as to say I think it's the best cop show on television.

I love the characters and I love the care the writers put into them.  The actors are all superb.  THE SHIELD is harsh, violent and sometimes very ugly, but it's also funny, sometimes touching, and always very smart.

1871825,4,B00008YGRW,"Make no mistake The Shield is first class and along with The Wire, it is the most gritty police series on TV. Set in Los Angeles, with one exception all of the police officers are various shades of grey, balancing police work with their own ambitions. In particular this is true of the main charactor, Vic Mackey. Mackey is a good if ruthless cop, brave, loyal to his men and a loving father. He is also totaly corrupt licensing the drug dealers in his area and torturing and killing anyone who gets in his way. Michael Chiklis does an excellent job of showing MacKey with all his contradictions, one minute saving a baby from drowning, the next burning a drug dealer on a hot grill.

MacKey's boss, David Aceveda played by Benito Martinez is eager to catch him, but balances this against his own political ambitions. Other charactors include Julian (Michael Jace) a Christain patrolman who refuses to accept he is gay and a Dutch (Jay Karnes), a dectective who craves the admiration of his colleagues. The only person we can admire is Claudette Wyms, played by the excelent CCH Pounder. Claudette has no agenda other than to be a good cop and catch the bad guy. She is clever enough to know what both MacKey and Aceveda are up to and they in turn know not to cross the only other cop with the abilty to bring them both down.

In the Shield's version of L.A. everyone is a gangster, corrupt politican, corrupt police officer, drug dealer, drug addict or psychotic killer. and often all six. I have never been to Los Angeles and the Shield does nothing to make me want to go there. This is the show's weekness. It is unremitingly grim. All right the life of an L.A. cop cannot be a bundle of laughs but it must have it's lighter moments. It is these that the Shield fails to show. An injection of the occasional bit of humour would go a long way. I am all for crime being shown in all it's horror but man does not live by gunshots and stab wounds alone.

Another weakness is the number of near misses that MacKey and his crew have. Always getting away with it by the skin of your teeth gets a bit repetitive.

I may be picky but why show the deleted scenes separate from the show? It would have been better to put these in the episodes so we can see them in their correct place. Having said that bring on series 3.",1106265600,5,2313,4.372093023255814

Fans of The Sopranos, 24 and similar shows will quickly get caught up in its compelling storylines and characters.  I personally found Season Two to be a bit more violent than the first, as the writers and cast continue to push the drama to new heights.  Some scenes might not be for the faint of heart.  However, the violence just one aspect of a well-incorporated show and though it is shocking at times, it does not overpower the other equally-interesting themes of politics, race/ gender/ sexuality, and the grey area between righteousness and corruption.

However all fail to meet the intensity and character development that The Shield consistently dishes out. When it comes to drama, this show is as good as it can get.

You watch the first episode of the first season and you'll be hooked. The first season is just incrdible and the second season only amps up the intensity. The entire cast is amazing. Chicklis and Pounder both deserve emmys. I know Chicklis already won one but he deserves another and Pounder being passed over for actress just isn't right. These people light up the screen with their performances and I have never cared about a show as much as I do this one. Also the writing is very well done. The storylines and the way the actors carry this show make it non-stop edge of your seat entertainment.

Here's the one problem with the second season. You can't jump right into it without watching the first season. Well, you can because it does stand on its own, but to get the full emotional effect that this show delivers, you really need to watch the first season first.

1871866,5,B00008YGRW,"The second season package of The Shield does justice to it.  As far as I could tell, actor commentaries are less frequent on this one than on the 1st season set - with more from the crew.  My own bias with special features is for those that feature the actors - the best one in that regard is ""Wrap Day"" which shows the cast and crew in the midst of filming the last episode of the season.  There are some truly hilarious moments in that, particularly those featuring Michael Chiklis.  Another featurette makes you appreciate how much goes into sound editing.  A roundtable featuring directors of The Shield is a reasonably frank appraisal of how the show is made.
The DVD retains the same grainy documentary-like resolution of the TV show and it works in that regard, rather than looking like a bad transfer (other FOX shows are not as lucky in this way).
The episodes themselves remain strong.  The season arc was unpredictable - the sense I had of where things were going midseason proved completely off.  This is a good thing - the show's strength is its ability to move in surprising directions.  Strong and compelling writing is central to The Shield, but my theory about its success is that it is has the best casting on television.  Every one of the actors does terrific work with their roles.  Michael Chiklis deserves all the plaudits he has received, but credit is also due to C.C.H. Pounder, Jay Karnes, Walton Goggins, Michael Jace, Catherine Dent, and Benito Martinez among others.

A couple of comments about the series:  a story about corrupt cops naturally tends to be dark. However, Vic Mackey and his band of detectives are not totally corrupt and are not without any redeeming qualitities.  Consequently, the characters are engaging and sometimes charming, and the show has moments of real humor to it.  The show is absolutely not for kids:  there is a very violent theme underlying the daily activities of the officers (both on and off duty) and a great deal of implied violence, but there is little of the overt, graphic, on-scene violence or torture that I sat through in the Sopranos... I have yet to have to leave the room during an episode of the Shield because of some bloody murder or another. Nonetheless, some plots are very disturbing (for example, one deals with the retaliation rape of a young girl:  the assault is not shown, but the effect of the attack is readily apparent).  The plots are well developed and generally do not lose their thread mid-episode or mid-season (in contrast, what happened to the Russians in the Sporanos??), however, some of the Shield characters go through some changes that are difficult to follow.  (If you want to know who, you'll have to watch for yourself.)
As to the DVDs themselves:  there are few extra features on the discs, but the show is sufficiently compelling that we didn't need much more.  There is cast commentary which adds a little, but not much.  The disks have been compatible with every DVD player we've used them on (at least 4 different models), and have stood up well to normal use and abuse.",1078876800,,1822,4.627329192546584

I am not going to right a long review like all of the others did. They have said it all. There are just not enough stars for The Shield. I have been hooked from day one and obviously I'm not the only one. Don't look at these reviews and think that this show is like all the others, because it's not.

LIKE I SAID ABOUT THE FIRST SEASON, ANYONE WHO LOVES TRUE ENTERTAINMENT WOULD ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS SET, I BOUGHT IT THE FIRST DAY IT WAS OUT.",1073865600,,348,4.580645161290323
1871894,5,B00008YGRW,"Series creator Shawn Ryan led ""The Shield"" through its second season while sacrificing or toning down NONE of the grittiness and fierce energy that made Season One so spectacular.
Vic and his Strike Team, like in the first season, spend 13 tense episodes walking that fine line between morality and immorality.  In season two they are targeted for execution by a ruthless drug lord (played very menacingly by Danny Pino), compelled to frame a fellow cop for contributing to a murder, and tap dance to keep the Police Administration, their boss, their boss' corrupt boss, civilian auditors, fellow detectives, and fate from finally exposing them for what they have become and having the whole thing blow up in their faces.
Vic has more on the line this season, both professionally and personally.  While the final episode of Season Two isn't the violence-filled tension-fest that ended Season One, it does lay the groundwork for a particularly tense Season Three.  On top of everything else the Strike Team has had to deal with up to now, in spite of all the bullets they've somehow dodged, Season Three is slated to see them being hunted by the Armenian Mob AND on in the crosshairs of their new boss, Detective Wymms, who is morally determined to take down Vic and his men.  Detective Aceveda may have been driven by a mix of morality and political ambition, but the political ambition part was what provided a safety net for Vic.  Wymms has no such ambitions.  So Vic and crew are up against a couple of more determined enemies than they've ever faced before.
I bought the Season Two DVD box set the day it was released (01/06/04) and had watched the entire 13 episode season within 24 hours.  Yes, it is THAT compelling!  Even after having seen them all before in first-run on F/X.
Keep this show coming!  This time, though, I hope we don't have to wait the full year to buy Season Three on DVD.",1073779200,,1898,4.692771084337349
1871895,5,B00008YGRW,"Fans of the first season know what an amazing show The Shield is. However, that is the reason that I had doubts about season 2. I mean, with how great season 1 was, it would be kind of hard to top. Season 2 of ""The Shield"" manages to be even better than the first season. Every moment from the opening episode, to the extremely enjoyable season finale is filled with even more violence, profanity, and controversy. The suspense this season brings is unreal. You see everything from Mackey and his team being heavily investigated to Aciveda aligning himself with Mackey. Season 2 should definately not be missed.
""The Shield"" in my opinion is one of the best shown on TV right now. The FX Network raised the quality of their programming up a notch when they released The Shield onto the air. The thing that I like most about the show, is how realistic it is. It actually feels like you are witnessing what goes on in the real world. The show often showcases acts of violence, nudity, and tons of profanity. That is why the show works. The quality of the show is put above the actual opinion of the viewers. The Shield is also the first cop show that I have seen that actually ties the episodes together. A lot of cop shows are based on what happens from case to case. But with The Shield, you actually have to see every episode to understand what's going on. Michael Chiklis offers one of the best performances I have ever seen with his portrayal of Vic Mackey. The character often toys with your emotions because you will find yourself hating the guy and supporting the guy all at the same time. The rest of the cast is top notch as well, despite being filled with relatively unknown actors.
The Shield is the one show that you should definately watch. The disturbing cases, excellent acting, and overall realistic feel push the show to a whole new level of law enforcement television. Watching season 2 of The Shield on DVD is the only way to go. All 13 episodes are provided commercial free and with excellent picture and sound quality. The extras are a sweet bonus because of all the behind the scenes footage that is shown. There are 38 deleted scenes, and tons of commentary from the show's creator Shawn Ryan and the cast. Overall, this is an excellent buy that should not be passed up.",1073347200,,2292,4.512019230769231

1871897,5,B00008YGRW,"Despite what many critics stated about the second season of FX's The Shield, this season proves to be better than the first by pushing (and even breaking) the limits of what can be seen on television.  The main story running throughout this season is corrupt cop Vic Mackey (Michael Chiklis) and his Strike team learn of a money train and plan to hit it, but not without a few snags in the way.  Julian (Michael Jace) denies his homosexuality and gets a quick marriage before he is revealed to his fellow officers, Dani (Catherine Dent) loses more and more her grip on her job and her state of mind, while Shane (Walt Goggins) forms a closer bond to Vic.  Season highlights include Carl Weathers guest starring as Vic's old partner, the introduction of a drug dealer named Armadillo that would have a profound impact on the show, and a flashback type episode in which we see Vic and the Strike team join together for the first time, and we witness Vic's first corrupt act as a cop.  Even though Chiklis gets most of the press for his performance on the show, the standout of season 2 was undoubtadly CCH Pounder who slowly learns the truth about Vic and his team, the culmination of which finds her in line for Aceveda's (Benito Martinez) job; the culmination of which will come to a head in the upcoming third season of the show.  I had feared that after a breakout first season The Shield would become a cliche, corrupt cop drama a la NYPD Blue, but creator Shawn Ryan pulls no punches and up's the ante for on screen violence and brutality, while weaving an incredible web of story.  All in all, this is cable TV at it's unprecidented best.",1072224000,4,1643,4.515151515151516
1871898,5,B00008YGRW,"This show is amazing.  I have to admit however, that I missed Season 1 completely and although I started to watch Season 2, I missed a few episodes in a row so I quit watching it becasue I wanted to see the action as it unfolded, not be informed about who Mackey took a bribe from and then beat up in the ""Previously on The Shield..."" clips.  You know what I mean right?  Anyway, I'm going to buy Season 1 and Season 2 on DVD and watch them back to back.  The characters are very likable, each with their unique view on how Mackey goes about doing his job.  ""The Shield"" is simply phenomenal.  I highly recommend it.",1070496000,,616,4.177966101694915
1871909,5,B00008YGRW,"The second season of the Shield picks up right where the first season of this controversial FX series left off and provides just as many shocking twist and stories as season one did:
""The Quick Fix""- The season premire has Vic still recovering from his wife abandoning him and running off with his kids and the revelation that a shipment of drugs that the Strike Team purchased behind Vic's back was laced with poison. As the Strike Team goes to Mexico to get their money back, Claudette and Dutch discover a new crime boss has entered the city and begun inflicting horrificly violent death and mutilation towards those who stand in his way to unify the city's gangs under his sole control.
""Dead Soldiers""- Claudette goes after the new syndicate leader Armadillo only to find her investigation hampered by Vic, who is desperately trying to keep Claudette from linking him to Armadillo's newest victim, his pet drug dealer Tio. This leads to Vic to inflict a brutal revenge on Armadillo, who declares war on Vic and the Strike Force in retaliation...
""Partners""- An old partner of Vic's returns in need of assistance while Vic tries to reconcile with his recently returned wife. The B-Plot for this episode meanwhile has Dutch and Claudette investigate the maiming of a young girl who has been taken prisoner by her sex obsessed neighbors, who ultimately murder their victim while the wife manipulates Dutch so as to keep him from finding out the truth before he can save the girl from them.
""Carte Blance""- A bland episode has Vic and Shane engaging in an undercover bust where everything that can go wrong goes wrong but yields information about a transport of a money train filled with mob money that Vic decides to hijack the next time it comes into town. Meanwhile a ""Toys for Guns"" drive yields new information for Claudette on old case of hers.
""Greenlit""- Armadillo announces that he's put out a bounty on the heads of each member of the Strike Team as Vic and Acaveda investigate revelations that Armadillo's gang is selling drugs to grade school kids.
""Homewrecker""- A powerful episode that has Vic searching for a murderer who killed the occupants and staff of a battered women's shelter, which leads to more strife between Claudette and Vic over their working relationship do to the fact that Vic usurps control over the investigation over the case. The ending features a shocking death to one of the supporting cast members as Connie, the prostitute who is an informant for Vic, is murdered after she reveals to Vic the location of the man who murdered the women at the shelter.
""Barnstormers""- Things come to a head in this episode as Dutch, do to his handling of the maiming/murder of a young woman several episodes back, is in the departmental doghouse and contemplaits going down the slippery slope of planting evidence in order to catch a murderer and redeem himself in everyone's eyes. Meanwhile Vic and his new love interest feud over how to help a battered woman who lives next door to Vic's new home while Armadillo returns and sends a message to Vic by way of beating up Ronnie (one of the Strike Team) and disfiguring him.
""Scar Tissue""- This episode brings the main storyline to a head as Armadillo turns himself in and threatens to expose Vic's illegal connections to the drug trafficing communtiy as well as for brutally beating him at the start of this season unless Vic makes Ronnie recant his statement that Armadillo disfigured him. While Vic is willing to sacrifice himself rather than make Ronnie recant, Lemonhead and Shane orchastrate the murder of Armadillo and arrange for Dani to take the blame for his death in order to save their own skin from the fall-out of Vic coming clean.
""Co-Pilot""- After dealing with the season's big bad, the writers bring out a flashback episode set during the first day in which ""The Barn"" open. Lots of retconning takes place as we see Vic and Claudette meet for the first time, Vic commit his first morally ambiguous act of evil, learn the real reason why Terry joined the Strike Team, and see first hand Vic and Acaveda's relationship go from friendly to hostile in the matter of 24 hours...
""Coyotes""- The Strike Team's new minority member joins the team as Vic and Shane must contend with not only the return of Gilroy (who's desperately trying to get Vic to give up damning evidence on himself in order to save his own butt) but also Acaveda, who has to deal with powerful political forces who threaten to fire him if his bid for elective office ends unsuccessfully.
""Inferno""- Ronnie returns to duty after being disfigured as the Strike Team prepare for the Money Train Heist. But before they can start to work on their plan, they get drawn into a massive manhunt for a notorious street gang leader who is in the city for the birth of his first-born son, leading to a dangerous cat and mouse game between everyone to for the chance to be the one to arrest him.
""Breakpoint""- The best episode of the season, a child abduction leads to Vic and Dutch hunting for a pedophile/murderer which turns into something much, much, much worse. Meanwhile Claudette gets drawn into the game of politics being played by those who are out to remove Acaveda from power, Julian's homosexual exploration is exposed by his former lover who blinds one of Julian's friends from counselling when he tries to get him to stop stalking Julain, and Vic gets framed by his exwife for domestic assault after refusing to let Vic see his kids.
""Dominoes Falling""- The second season ends with a dud in an episode. The money train heist goes off but not without several minor complications while Julian and Dani both suffer nasty fates as Julian gets lynched by his fellow cops do to his bisexuality while Dani gets fired. Meanwhile the A-Plot of this episode has Claudette's ex-husband being murdered and Claudette and Vic forced to put aside their hate for each other and to find the killers after linking it to an organized random killing spree one gang has put together to strike fear in the hearts of the city.",1066521600,5,6057,4.74218009478673
1871910,5,B00008YGRW,"To be honest, I never thought that The Shield could live up to the expectations set by the premier episode.  I was so incredibly wrong.  The first year of The Shield completely blew my doors off.  Non stop action, great plotting, dialogue and the acting was top notch.  Other than the birth of my sons, those thirteen hours were the best I spent that year.  It had to go downhill though, right?  The second season would be the one where Ryan and company would resort to the tired conventions of police drama and my new favorite show would lose it's edge.  Happily- Wrong again.
Season two developed the characters of Mackey and his crew to new levels.  If you haven't seen the show I won't ruin anything for you, but everyone is put through the wringer in these thirteen episodes.  We get political intrigue, interoffice machinations, great police drama with healthy doses of sex and violence.  Unfortunately that's what most people focus on.
Chicklis deserved the Emmy for the quiet moments as well as the brutal ones.  This actor has got a slow burn like no other.  There are moments where he says nothing but we can tell all the alternatives he is running through his head by simply looking at his eyes and physicality.  This season brings Mackey to a crossroads where he has to make some serious decisions about where his life is headed and we feel every emotion he is going through thanks to this beautiful, bald man.
That having been said, this is not a series for the faint of heart.  There are scenes of physical torture, violence against women, hostage situations and raw sex. You are forewarned.
If your stomach can take a brutal, skillfully written, brilliantly acted police drama there is no better way to take up space in your DVD player than The Shield.",1065139200,11,1767,4.639871382636656

Vic Mackey which is the main character with a dark side really wants to see Justice done .. but is tired of the laws that govern the way he must do things. He and his band of enforcers take it to the streets ""their way"" with some side step Justice .. Some things just work ... The only drawback to this series is the 9 months before another 13 episodes ... Come on Shawn Ryan get a move on ... Spring and Fall Baby !!! Oh and Vic !!

1871912,5,B00008YGRW,"The intesity of this series first season was a tough act to follow. On occasion, they didn't quite manage it. But the story arcs of the second season made for riveting television viewing.
When Mackay and Asseveda forge a tenuous (mutually beneficial) alliance, it takes everybody by surprise. Asseveda has his political future to be concerned with, and a civilian auditor who could close the precinct. Mackay has to try and find his family, keep the Strike Team together, rule the streets, and figure a way to take down a drug dealer's money train.
The thirteen episodes in these seasons never seem to be enough. But the creators also seem to realize that it's just enough to keep the viewers happy for another year.",1064707200,7,716,4.782258064516129

1871914,5,B00008YGRW,"I certainly didn't think they could top the first season of The Shield. Well, I was mistaken. ...[T]he first episode was a little flat, but suffice to say, as the season plays out, what one thought were unnecessary, time consuming details come full circle. Given how ludicrous tv networks can be, who knows if FX will ever have the lunacy to cancel this show. If, heaven forbid, they do, I can't encourage the purchase of season one AND season two, and any upcoming seasons as well. I have already watched the season one DVD set countless times, and am anxiously awaiting the release of season two. This show makes NYPD Blue look one step above Cop Rock. The acting is beyond superb, while the camera effects, coupled with the soundtrack actually get your heart racing. Add the sinful pleasure of not being too sure whether or not one should be rooting for Vic and the Strike Team. Their tactics may be questionable, but you have to love the results.",1057017600,6,950,4.627218934911243

After watching The Shield and comparing it to all the other ""cop shows"", I found myself wondering why anyone would bother with anything else. Simply put, The Shield cannot be touched! I think a lot of people did not watch the show at first, me included, because it looked like just another drama. Surprise, surprise! The comedy elements of the show are what put this show ahead of every other. Don't get me wrong, the in your face violence is awesome as well. I find myself wondering what more can go wrong for Vic and the strike team in every episode. How many more problems can they get themselves into. And most of all, the interesting ways they temporarily get out of them. Check your morals at the door and bring your sense of humor.

I can relate to each character on the show, and compare him to a cop I know . That is what makes great TV, being able to relate all the people and experiences to yourself. I feel that in Season 3, Mackey is going to learn there are consequences and reprocussions for his actions. But these past 2 seasons have been as well-written, finely acted, and superbly directed as any police show I have ever seen. The use of the hand held cameras just adds to the grittiness of the show. Clark Johnson (himself a fine actor in his own right on Homicide)brings a superb touch to every episode he directs. Can't wait for season 3.",1054944000,15,799,4.194805194805195

It wasn't until FX was showing the reruns every night in a row. I think what drew me to watching it was a brief clip during a commercial when Vic was chasing a guy and the suspect jumped a wooden fence and Vic ran through the fence and tackled the guy. I like the show for its diversity also. You have whites, blacks, latinos, koreans and... people from Armania., And its great how the strike team gets pumped up before a warrant and listen to music. Reminds me of before a football game., I went and bought the dvd set the other day and watched it all from start to end. Believe me it is worth it to beable to watch them and not wait for reruns and not have to worry about commercials. I cannot wait until Season 2 comes out. I don't have the option to get them here.
