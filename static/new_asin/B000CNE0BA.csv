Pedro Infante is magnificent in this film, in which he plays 3 very different characters. #1, Rafael Lara (father), a down and out singer who can't find work and struggles to take care of his wife and twin sons; #2, Rafael Lara (son), a happy go lucky fellow following in his father's footsteps as singer, and full of life and love, whose only anxiety is knowing that his mother has kept a lifelong secret from him. #3, Carlos Iturbe (Gabriel Lara), who has grown up a millionaire, doesn't suspect Rafael is his brother, and has disdain for those ""below him"" socially. Fate ties them together again, as the brothers fall in love with the same woman, and the tightly woven web unravels. The saga begins as Rafael finds a baby abandoned in a churchyard on a bitterly cold night, and brings the baby home, not realizing that he could be implicated as accomplice in a kidnapping plot. The complex story unfolds from there, with the theme of class injustice and wealth vs. poverty, and holds our interest with brilliant acting and singing, and an excellent script co-written by director Miguel Zacarias.

Libertad Lamarque gives a luminous performance as Maria de Lara, and from her Argentine roots we hear her renditions of 2 great Carlos Gardel tangos. The film also features several Agustin Lara songs, with a marvelous dance number to his ""Farolito."" Others in the fine cast include Irma Dorantes as Isabel, and Arturo Soto Rangel as Don Lorenzo. Though there are no landscapes for Gabriel Figueroa's famed cinematography, his atmospheric interiors are beautiful. ""Ansiedad"" is a special film for Infante and Lamarque fans, and one that can be enjoyed time and time again. The songs are an integral part of the plot, and are:

Sung by Lamarque:
1: ""Sus Ojos se Cerraron""
2: ""Cuesta Abajo""
3: ""Estrellita del Sur""
4: ""Noche Criolla""

Sung by Infante:
1: ""Tu Recuerdo y Yo""
2: ""Mujer""
3: ""Amor de Mis Amores""
4: ""Farolito""
Duets:
1: ""Ingrata Perjida""
2: ""Marimba""
3: ""Ando Muy Boracho""

""Cartas Marcadas""

In this reworking of Taming of the Shrew, Pedro Infante and Marga Lopez shine as two people who love to hate each other, then hate to love each other, while pride and stubbornness keep their heads from admitting what their hearts both know. The plot is about Victoria (Lopez) and Manuel (Infante), who to comply with a will, must marry each other. Director Rene Cardona co-stars as Don Manuel, who is Victoria's father and Manuel's godfather, and he finally has to manipulate circumstances to get the squabbling pair together. A great cast surrounds them, with the ever funny ""El Chicote"" Armando Soto as Manuel's sidekick Tepalcate, and Alejandro Cangherotti as Ernesto, the town doctor (for both human and animal patients) who is madly in love with Victoria.

Chucho Monge wrote the score, and there are six wonderful songs, some of them with Infante's marvelous ""Mariachi Shout,"" and one of them a female serenata with the Hermanas Julian backing Marga Lopez, The lovely cinematography by Jack Draper still looks good considering the age of the film, however the audio has deteriorated a little, but is helped by raising the volume, and no subtitles are available. There are many hilarious scenes as the antagonists play dastardly tricks on each other, like gift-wrapping a great big live rat, and this is another of Infante's romantic comedies that is a 100% winner. El Idolo de Guamuchil lives forever in his many heartwarming films, that are filled with love and laughter.

""Barca de Oro""

Sofia Alvarez stars as Chabela Vargas, a tough gal who lives on a ranch with her sister Graciella (Nelly Montiel) and tio (Carlos Orellana). Chabela wears the pants in the family and runs the ranch, and is very much ""one of the guys."" An engineer from the big city (Rene Cardona) comes to the ranch to complicate matters of the heart, and both Chabela and Graciella are smitten. He plays on both their affections, leaving Lorenzo (Pedro Infante), who is secretly in love with Chabela, out of the running. Lorenzo is an honest man, and the only one that is macho enough for Chabela, but it takes time (and a big fight!) for Chabela to discover this.

This is very much Alvarez' film, with Infante getting very little screen time, but he makes the most of every minute of it. Sofia Alvarez (1913-1985), the wonderful actress from Colombia who was also paired with Infante in ""Soy Charro de Rancho Grande"" and ""Si Me Han de Matar Ma&ntilde;ana,"" is terrific in this role, and her enchanting grace and style can be seen even in her masculine stance and dress. Her hands are amazing, and so expressive. Directed by Joaquin Pardave, the Jorge Stahl cinematography is gorgeous, and gives one a feeling of what ""old Mexico"" was like. The audio is somewhat deteriorated, and you'll have to turn up the volume a little more than usual. Manuel Esperon scored the film, and Infante and Alvarez have 3 songs apiece, With the title song getting several renditions. Other songs include ""El Corrido de Chabela Vargas"" and ""Un Resbalon.""

I haven't seen ""Un Rincon Cerca del Cielo"" yet, but am looking forward to it. There's no limit to the joy of Pedro Infante films!",1214870400,4,5162,4.841269841269841
