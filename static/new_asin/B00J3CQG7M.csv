6330112,1,B00J3CQG7M,"I am rating this poor not because of low or no budgeting, but because it was slow, and they took a decent screenplay botched it with average performances and goofy last 30 minutes of the movie.  The last act of the movie ran did not support the arc of the movie which made for a stupid last act.  Watch the first 40 min and then turn off.",1411430400,3,338,4.029850746268656
6330113,1,B00J3CQG7M,HORRIBLE MOVIE !! A freaking waste of film. Don't waste your time watching this crap,1410825600,2,84,4.666666666666667
6330114,1,B00J3CQG7M,"Not good. Not expensive. Made the most out of some piles of wet hair and what I think may have been a Halloween spider, some yelling and slurping noises, motivated ""actors"" who probably did this for free, a gallon or two of slime, a storage unit for location, and the rudiments of a plot. Also considerable yelling and sniffling. If this sounds like something you'd like to see once it's accumulated, have at it.",1400025600,4,412,4.581081081081081
6330115,3,B00J3CQG7M,"It was a cool little low budget horror film. I have seen alot of horrible low budget horror films - this was better than most. It kinda reminded me of something with a retro 90's twist - in a good way. Acting was ok, good camera and music. Honestly, I really thought this film was going to be worse than what it was, but it ended up being OK. It held my attention.  It started off a little slow, but pick up the pace when the lights went out.

It drops you in the middle of three different story lines until they merge when the creature starts killing the final people off.  I was curious, so I looked up the budget and was really impressed with the little project it was -- big studios make horrible stuff all the time with millions.. this was OK.",1396742400,2,748,4.144827586206897
6330116,1,B00J3CQG7M,"The movie starts off by us reading about killings in an abandoned warehouse in 1937 involving stolen ancient artifacts. In current day Chicago, the warehouse is a multilevel storage facility. We see killings going on, or at least hear people screaming, appearing bloody, then their bodies being pulled away by something unseen.

A group of college kids opt to go after the demon stones allegedly hidden in tunnels under the unit. This of course can only happen at night. There are other people accessing their units when the lights go out. The quality of the amateur filming approaches that of the hand held genre. The different groups act as various cheap subplots as people with flashlights running and screaming. Kendra (Rocki DuCharme) appears to be the main protagonist among the groups of non-connected individuals.

The plot was well conceived. The execution was horrible. More for those who like bad hand held films without knowing or caring who is filming.

6330119,4,B00J3CQG7M,"I'm giving it 4 stars because the audio was fantastic. Story was decent, and acting was good. I'd recommend if you're a horror fan.",1435276800,,131,4.5
6330120,1,B00J3CQG7M,"Others have already given a plot synopsis, so I'll stick to my opinion of the film.

This was an extremely annoying film: from the jump shots with date/location titles (which only served to confuse, not clarify), to the horrible editing and camera work (zoom close-ups of mouths), to an incoherent plot (was it a monster, was the goo turning people into murderous slaves), to the fact that the monster was NEVER shown, and finally that EVERYONE died (not that I cared - these characters were also annoying).

The only thing I am grateful for is the fact that it was free with my Amazon Prime - my annoyance would have turned to anger if I had paid to watch this.

6330122,1,B00J3CQG7M,"The first 5 minutes sounded awesome.  As a life long Chicagoian -- I was intrigued by missing ancient artifacts from Chicago's world famous Museum of Science & Industry, adding a dash of murder, season with a pinch of mysterious customs, black magic/voodoo, let it marinate with story, cast & script--turned into a recipe for disaster.  It's almost as if they spliced the wrong intro to this odd homemade youtube-worthy storyl, paid the local storage unit $100 to film there & invited friends to ""act"" in it for pizza & beer maybe?",1422144000,,531,4.824175824175824
6330123,2,B00J3CQG7M,It had potential but it was so slip shod. You don't even get to see the magic stones they're after; and the entire premise that something so ancient and  stupidnatural is being kept in a storage warehouse is just ridiculous. It's like watching children playing at inner city Indiana Jones.,1420761600,,289,4.78

8647672,1,B00J3CQG7M,Very disappointed. Mostly just a bunch of yelling and screaming starting a few minutes after several groups of people figure out they are trapped. They turn on each other. And the creature was like something out of a 60's movie. Could not finish but did watch pretty far. Do directors think a bunch of yelling and bickering makes a movie scary? It just bums me out. And I thought was supposed to be about a curse and spirits. Maybe showed at the very end but mostly they showed parts of a very unoriginal creature. Bad.,1531958400,,519,4.473684210526316
8647673,1,B00J3CQG7M,"The only positive I can say is the acting is decent and that's about it.  And there isn't much acting.  This movie tries to be too many things at once and fails at every turn.  1.) There are too many groups of different people walking around and never really meet each other.  They are just cannon fodder with a few spoken lines.  2.) No atmosphere.  Turning off the buildings lights does not make things scary.  3.) People start behaving irrationally without an explanation as to why.  4.) The umm... entity? is never shown, and you do not get any real hint as to the scope of the danger.  People that might have knowledge on the subject don't have any.  And there isn't any build up to when it strikes.  Imagine jaws without the fin - it'd be like jaws jumps out of the water and grabs his victim then off to the next.  That's what this entity does.  5.) There is no story.  Each group has a reason to be there, but that's about as much as your going to get.",1529798400,,960,4.232044198895028

8647675,4,B00J3CQG7M,"It is a very good low budget movie.  Supernatural, weird and fun. If you like horror this is a keeper. It's a low budget that feel better than that, it feels more mid budget. It has a good story, character are interesting but not too, they hide the monster, lot's of mystery, good acting and creative. I believe if the director had a better script and more money he or she would have had a outstanding film. But all in all the entire group deserves applause and should be given future opportunities in film.",1472083200,,507,4.3936170212765955
