8024003,1,B00028LRGG,"This DVD is garbage.  Sadly, I failed to see the prior review before purchasing this incredibly bad DVD.  Basically, this DVD looks like someone with poor camera skills carried a cheap videocam to some third-rate outdoor police training sessions, recorded whatever came along, loaded it on a DVD, and sold it for an outrageous price.  To make matters worse, to ensure the full 60 minutes was filled, they actually took the first couple of lessons and duplicated them AT THE END OF THE VIDEO!  Everything in this video is commonly discussed in the shooting magazines and forums.  Stay away from this turkey!",1252108800,3,606,4.901960784313726
8024004,1,B00028LRGG,Wow. Don't be fool like I was. Ayoob has been a very publicized gun expert. So I told myself that it would be very instructive. What a disapointement. Video is VHS transfer at his worst. Audio has a hiss the whole 60 min and sometimes the mike seems to go bad as there is no sound. The info is repetitive and not very useful. Stay away. At least you will have been warn as i wasn't (there was no customer review) !!!,1196467200,5,416,4.085365853658536
