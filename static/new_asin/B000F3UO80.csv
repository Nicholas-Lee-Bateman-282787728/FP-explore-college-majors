8117263,3,B000F3UO80,"Oh my gosh...  I read the other reviews, and I was hoping that I would at least be able to learn and play the basic versions of these standards.  I may still be able to do that, but it's going to take a LOT of work.  Andy frequently refers the viewers back to the Modern Jazz Piano video for chord theory.  Maybe I should have watched/studied that one first. This should be considered a master class. No doubt there are people (jazz educators, music majors, professional musicians, etc) that are capable of learning from this video the way it was intended.  I'm just not one of them.  That said, I'm so glad that Andy has written the books and recorded the DVDs that he has.  Appreciate his commitment to teaching jazz piano.

The first run thru the song Andy shows us how to play the tune with what he calls basic 2 and 3 note voicings.  (sounds easy right?) He plays a lot of arpeggios in the basic versions.  Little finger playing the bass/root of the chord and then reaches up to play 2 and 3 note voicings an octave up. The basic arrangements are good, but not easy.

Then he shows us (and talks us thru) his arrangement of the tune - beautiful but tough for me to wrap my brain around.  We're expected to be able to watch the keyboard (song being played back at half speed) and pick up the voicings. I would have thought I would be able to do that, but (huh) it will take many hours of pressing the rewind key and documenting the voicings for each song.

Next Andy shows us his re-harmonization of the tune. He walks us through what he's doing (chord substitutions) the why and how it makes sense (instead of this, I did that - which is a tri-tone away, etc).

And finally he plays a contrafact (uses the chords from the original tune, but comes up with a new melody).

Andy's arrangements are beautiful modern jazz piano.  There is also a  CD of Andy playing these tunes with a band - called Double Standard.

There is a little fake book that comes with the CD. It shows the original chords for the tune and the re-harmonized chords. It also shows the contrafact(s).",1389398400,5,2073,4.354166666666667
8117264,4,B000F3UO80,"I was really interested in seeing what the product would be like, given the mixed reviews.  To cut to the chase, I would highly recommend the video, but with an important caveat.

The caveat is that this is definitely NOT intended for someone at a beginning level.  It requires a very strong background, especially from the standpoint of being familiar with chords, as he throws out complex chords names one after the other, so you if you don't have a strong background as to chord spellings, you'll very likely be lost.  It's not intended to be a primer in theory; that background is assumed.

There are two strong points to the video, IMO.  The first is when Andy goes through the video at half-speed, and sometimes at full speed, and explains his thinking.  I found that to be the most useful.  That is, more than the actual chords chosen themselves, but the WHY.  He does a really good job doing a very difficult thing, which is to explain the thinking behind the choice.  Often in playing one chooses chords without really knowing why, so the temptation is to say something like ""I tried this, and liked the sound of it, so went with it"", which isn't very useful from an educational standpoint.  Andy doesn't do this, but has reasons for the choices he makes, and being able to share in the thinking process of an accomplished musician is the best part of the video, to my way of thinking.  So if that's something which sounds intriguing, I would recommend the video.

A weak point to the video is that arrangements are not written out.  So if you want to play note for note what Andy is playing, be prepared for a lot of work.  That this wasn't done is the biggest disappointment to me.  Andy's voicings are always top notch, so I would really liked to have seen them written out.  However, the chord choices for the reharmonizations are written out, so at least you have that to go with.

Another disappointment is that, from a playing standpoint, it seems like Andy was just going through the motions.  That is, the playing often wasn't particularly musical, but I suppose that's because of the context.  However, when Andy was playing his own arrangements, what he calls ""contractfacts"", those I found to be very satisfying from a musical perspective.  Very well played, and really well done.

If the written arrangements had been included, I'd have given this 5 stars.  But even without that, it was definitely, for me, well worth the money, and I'm looking forward to seeing what other videos he has.

Also I liked that he chose standards to work with, so I was familiar with many of the tunes he played.",1364515200,5,2615,4.6103896103896105
8117265,1,B000F3UO80,"It's too fast to me. And i hate the lessons without showing hands of player/teacher. The ""keys showing"" of the piano does not easy to follow because i can't see clearly 10 keys at the same time. if i can see hands, i know where are key i need to use (base on my ears and my eyes at the same time)",1364515200,2,296,3.7903225806451615
8117266,5,B000F3UO80,"Andy Laverne is an experienced musician and teacher. He knows that it's very important to a student to play well arranged examples in standard formats and reharmonized versions to compare and feel those new ways to expand arranging skills. It's better than study static theories and rules. Great instructional DVD for any musician,no matter the instrument he plays. That's important to say that the beautiful and amazing reharmonizations are very sophisticated and a pleasure to listen to. Highly recommended.",1286668800,2,509,5.455696202531645
8117267,2,B000F3UO80,"... that this vid is NOT for beginners.  And even for those who are more advanced and could use some of the advice, I don't think it's worth the price.  You will be viewing the artist at his piano just playing the song (looking at his face in the top half of the screen while viewing his fingers playing on the piano keyboard) in 'basic' mode.  Then he plays it again embellishing it while recording it on the Yamaha disclavier that he is using.  Then you see the piece played back just viewing the keys playing on their own, which is totally useless for instruction even though he plays it back at half tempo.  Then, on to the next song.

All the while the artist is explaining the chords he is playing and some reasons why he is embellishing some of them and adding some licks, etc.  But as far as worthwhile and practical instruction goes: Fuhgeddaboutit!

If you like watching this fellow play while listening to his interpretations of the pieces while he droning on, ""G flat major. C  sharp sus, D flat minor, etc"", and/or if you are a fairly well advanced student, then perhaps you may like this DVD.  But if you are a beginner and want to know HOW to play a piece(s) step-by-step, then this is not for you.

Two stars for the audio and video quality, and the quality of viable instruction for what amounts to very little, if any `instruction'.  Maybe even one star.  Maybe zero stars.  Totally useless instructional DVD.",1282435200,5,1427,4.48062015503876
8117268,5,B000F3UO80,"This DVD has really helped me expand my jazz piano playing, and sped up my development.

Andy takes 6 great standard tunes and shows how you might arrange the song from a lead sheet which just shows the melody and the basic chord changes.

First he just demonstrates a basic version of the tune with basic 7th chord voicings in the left hand and melody in the right hand. He then demonstrates a more elaborate version of the tune by using more complex voicings and some approach chords that make the arrangement sound a lot fuller. By playing it back at 50% speed on the Disklavier piano without Andy obstructing the keys, you get to see these voicings which is very, very helpful.

He then reharmonises the tune which I still have to study, but is obviously very useful to show what can de done by completely changing the harmonic structure of the tune, makes the song sound completely fresh. Andy finishes off by playing a contrafact which is a new melody over the original chord changes.

I always used to ask what the ""secret"" was to the voicings of legendary players like Chick Corea, Keith Jarrett, Bill Evans, McCoy Tyner, Herbie Hancock etc but Andy Laverne shows how to do it. Sometimes it is just one or two notes that make the chord sound richer, and this DVD unlocks the ""secrets"" to these questions of what the legends actually do.

I would say this is the best Jazz Piano DVD on the market. I wouldn't recommend it to beginners, as knowledge of basic chords and harmony is required. There is a lot of material/study here but it's just like having a one to one lesson with an incredible jazz pianist. I wish he would do another sequel DVD with more arrangements of other standards.",1282348800,11,1694,4.540983606557377
8117269,5,B000F3UO80,Andy Laverne is a great teacher.  All good teachers have a flare for passion.  Andy is one of the best and his passion for teaching is evident in everything that he does.  His presentation of the material is logical and straightforward and allows the student ample time to absorb the information and put it to practical use.  I'm always on the lookout for anything that Andy has to offer.,1195948800,8,388,4.579710144927536
