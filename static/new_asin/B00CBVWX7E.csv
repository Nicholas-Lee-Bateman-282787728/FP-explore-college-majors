5713273,5,B00CBVWX7E,"I love documentaries about uncommon sports because the filmmaker never knows how they will end. They are a lot more interesting to me than ""reality TV"" shows because the filmmaker can only edit so much - since they have tighter budgets than the big TV networks. Over the years I'm enjoyed documentaries on Crossword puzzle competitions (""Wordplay""), marching bands (""Drumline"") and more. Watching ""Ping Pong"" was just as much fun. Yes, it's about table tennis - not the most exciting sport. BUT, this is the"" International OVER 80s"" completion held in China where all the competitors (and there are over 2,000 from over 52 countries!) compete. The reigning world champion is Australian Dorothy leLow who is 100 years old. (Yes, you read that right!). She needs a wheel chair to get around but put her at the end of a ping pong table and she is amazing. Co-Directors Anson and Hugh Hartford, introduce you to eight players - including one player who is given just one week to live - and follow them through out the brief 76 minute film. The nice thing about ping pong is that each game is quick, usually less than a minute and a match is 11 points. With tight edition, and a neat upbeat soundtrack of original music, the time flies by.

The film is in English but has English subtitles when the non-English-speaking athletes (and they are athletes; one guy in his eighties lifts barbells to train!) are interviewed, but that is not very often.

The DVD has two bonuses: The Theatrical Trailer and a few extended interviews and Deleted Scenes. But it's the feature film that is the center of attraction.
If you like documentaries about real people in real competitions, I think you'll like Ping Pong. I know I did.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

8580049,4,B00CBVWX7E,I enjoyed this documentary. As an avid older player myself it was fun to watch over-85s competing at a hIgh level. The movie was inspirational without being overly sentimental. The only reason I am not giving this movie 5 stars is that it lacked sub-titles and some of the dialog was heavily accented and really hard to understand.,1440979200,,331,4.724137931034483
8580050,5,B00CBVWX7E,"Excellent movie. I am an avid table tennis player, but the real interesting focus of the movie was not table tennis itself. The movie is really about how important to stay active as we grow older.",1437696000,,196,4.472222222222222
8580051,5,B00CBVWX7E,"A great documentary about the human character, it follows several individual athletes who are facing their mortality, overcoming their fears and enjoying their passion for life and the game of Table Tennis!",1410307200,,206,5.46875
8580052,4,B00CBVWX7E,"This is a touching and very funny film reminding me that we may all be getting older, but it does not mean we lose our desire to be winers!",1391299200,,139,3.8275862068965516
8580053,5,B00CBVWX7E,"A good film. I bought this because I'm from a family of ping-pongers. My grandma is 89 and is pretty good with the paddle. As of now, it's out circulating somewhere. Hopefully a lot of ppl can watch it",1386288000,,201,4.17948717948718
8580054,4,B00CBVWX7E,This was an utterly charming video/documentary on several 80-somethng table tennis players and their quest for competitive success. I recommend it as a fascinating case study in the human spirit and ego. It was certainly worth my time and effort to track it down and watch it.,1382918400,2,276,4.8936170212765955
