8759095,1,B01EL3I4X6,Great show but when I purchased this collection the subtitles didn't translate even close to well. Unless you speak Japanese avoid buying this.,1493510400,,143,5.260869565217392
8759096,1,B01EL3I4X6,"Ok i loved the anime when it came to buying the DVD this wa my only option, and i regret it, its a Korean fake, it has 8 disks for 75 + 25 + 25(episodes) OVAs & Film, so u have .mkv on the actual CD with a .Bin & .cue loader older DVD players & PS3s will not play this because of the codec needed, i noticed mine was fake because one of the DVDs had a water mark and smudged imprint on the front with rather poor packaging after 3 days the glue wore off so the sleeve is now obsolete

now then the English subs are so poor you're better off streaming this or Torrenting, its god damn garbage as all the people names have been translated to Korean and the Grammar is so bad, that you actually throw this in the binn and buy the originals, or learn Japanese so u don't have to use the subs,

Faster and better quality downloading",1484697600,2,827,3.9759036144578315
8759097,3,B01EL3I4X6,"Horrible English subtitles.  The discs are in great condition, and they play on Region 1 dvd players, not to mention the case is fine (plastic dvd case housing all 8 discs.  But the subtitles don't translate well at all.  Pretty disheartening.",1472428800,4,243,4.878048780487805
8759098,3,B01EL3I4X6,As much as I loved reading the manga this was bad the discs had all came inside a couple of sleeve and then there was a random show in it with the rest. The English subtitles had way to many errors in it making it hard to read sometimes. it still is a good show,1472083200,7,261,3.7636363636363637
