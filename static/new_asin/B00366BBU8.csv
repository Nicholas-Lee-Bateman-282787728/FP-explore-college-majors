4073198,5,B00366BBU8,"Awesome!  I show it to my Survey of Architecture class for a few reasons:
-Entertaining
-Beautifully shot, some good animations as well
-Educational
-Love the exploration of his iconic Case Study House photos, his process in general
-A great starting point for introducing Modern Architecture to those who think it's lame
-Schulman is wonderful
-Great examples of architects wearing ""pretentious round-frame glasses""
I find that the first half of the film is ""better,"" but that could be that I'm more interested in mid-century US Modernism than more contemporary styles",1438387200,,569,5.393258426966292

4073219,2,B00366BBU8,"Pros:
An accumulation of ""personality"" video well edited together at a leisurely pace thankfully missing irritating loud music. Overall probably deserves a 3 star average rating as being a typical wondering DVD that gives little direct technical info but is  ""nice"" personality piece. Yet it gets a one from me see below:

Cons:
Not really any info about photography. Little to no, lens, camera, or film comment. One guy gives a quick summary of his technique in one of the segments but it is unusually short and not fully featured, blink and you miss it.

Not really any info about architecture, just briefest comments about his interaction with architects & modernism. Too much info on a couple of houses that they featured and not enough on the photography technique.

Missing the clear definitions needed to understand the material.

Over rated when given 1 stars by who? Friends of the makers? If they hadn't been so enthusiastic I would not have been so disappointed.

This is a classic example of very well done skimpy personality piece that just touches the surface of the material.

It wonders as though it is a collection of interviews produced & written by people with little to no background in the material.  This is the problem with most documentaries, they lack a writer with knowledge of the material behind them.

Ultimately my irritation is that I should have spent my hard earned money elsewhere but I got conned by the good reviews. This is worth about $3 not the $20 I paid. Too bad the economics won't let them price it this way.",1389484800,2,1551,4.7790262172284645
4073220,4,B00366BBU8,"The photos speak for themselves.  Just look at the box cover.  But this commits the cardinal sin of including, even encouraging, a lot of hero worship.  I admit there may never be another golden age of modernist architecture nor another man to capture it this beautifully on film.  He usually chose his subject well.  Then he spent hours or even days finding the exact ""sweet spot"" perspective and lighting that makes the image come alive.  He deserved to feel happy about his results, but let's face it: he had the easier job.",1370476800,,527,4.673913043478261
4073221,5,B00366BBU8,"I have never met Julius Shulman; though his work was referred to me by Architect Charles Lagreco.
I have a pro bias nature in me regarding this person Julius Shulman because I purchased Charles Lagreco's Family Home in the fall of 2008, and Julius featured this house on pages 364 to 367 of an Architecture Book called Modernism Rediscovered.
  I felt a little bit uncomfortable in the self aggrandizement and lauding, but one must blame the documentarian for this tedious expose; although Julius's Photography in Architecture is superior to any one else's work.  I did want to meet him, and could have since I purchased the home during the time-period he had rendered the Lagreco Home exquisitely - but he passed on.
Whenever I am in my new home ... and try to photograph it ... Julius is metaphorically standing behind each branch that he would like in the photo. A good and kindhearted friend to Architects and Artists. We see the world differently in Architectonic ways because of his vision, and blood and sweat of the Architects and their Builders.

4073224,4,B00366BBU8,"As an Architect, I can concur with some of the other reviews here; after watching a screening of the movie at a local Architecture Festival, I experienced a host of mixed feelings, unlike after seeing other major movies on Architects or Architectural subjects. On the positive side, yes, impressed and pleased with the main character and his work, but I agree that there's too much stuffed into this movie that's distracting, as has been mentioned before. But not only that; it is likely that as a viewer you're about to see not only photographs, but works of Architecture that are absolutely stunning and new at the same time, but to see them come by as on a luggage 'belt' for only what seems to be not more then a second at a time, is, maybe unknowingly, producing a teasing effect (multiplied by 100), only to take you back to the next shot of an 'event'. That is so contrasting with the few moments in the film where time has been taken to be in a place with the man and pertaining other relevant character(s), that it numbs you while watching, so that after having seen half of it, the movie line and direction are not apparent any more, no cohesion, and you wonder if that's it, after every sequence. Thanks for mentioning the bonus material and trailer; I might after all buy the movie, because as a teaser, the movie does have an effect; I want more of the Architecture shown and his photography of it !",1359417600,5,1412,4.498054474708171
4073225,5,B00366BBU8,My son was very pleased to receive it. I had viewed it previously and found it to be a very well done and infomative documentary.,1357171200,,129,4.2

His photography of the mid-century homes was so well done...with his timing of the shots to get the best light and angles...one of the best and a beautiful, humble person as well.",1356825600,,262,4.6521739130434785
4073237,5,B00366BBU8,This is a must-have for anyone who is interested in photography of any kind but especially architectural photography. People who aren't interested in photography but who are interested in 20th century modernism will also like it. I had already seen this movie and liked it so much that I bought this DVD.,1355184000,,304,4.865384615384615
4073238,5,B00366BBU8,"I will never look at architecture the same way - what an amazing eye and sense of beauty this man had when creating his art.  His photos are breathtaking and surreal.  A man whose passion for his art and life itself are an inspiration to others.  I really had no clear idea what modernism was in regards to architecture, but now I do and I can say it is strikingly beautiful.  What an exciting time that must have been, the modernist period of architecture...!!!",1346198400,,462,4.464285714285714
4073239,5,B00366BBU8,"I loved this documentary simply because I feel like I met Julius and got to spend some time with him, if only via the screen.  His simple approach to photography of single point and revealing his secret of combining natural light with artificial lighting to complement each other in order to reveal more layers was wonderful.  Also, I liked the concept of how he was always relaxed and took the time to experience the moment and let the architectural, and the emotional impact of the moment, lead him in his shot taking; not letting components of that moment like dogs barking, be something that distracted him, but instead, gave him the opportunity to interact and respond as being one with the moment.  Clearly his talent was to know how alive he was at every moment, and his photos reflect this energy.  The architecture he was shooting, simply allowed him to share himself like any artist does, through their chosen medium and present to us what he was able to see at that moment.  The beauty he didn't create, but he was able to see it, and capture it through his camera lens, and in this respect, created a different kind of beauty, one that everyone could now see, and see it though his eyes by way to the photos he took.  I see architectural photography in a new light now.",1342137600,5,1281,4.547826086956522
4073240,5,B00366BBU8,"This film is a must see for all fans of what is being dubbed 'mid-century modernism'.  No single photographer documented this alluring style of architecture better than Julius Shulman.  It puts you behind the scenes and even the camera from time to time.  We are treated to interviews with the Stahl family as well as other clients, fans, surviving architects and colleagues.  Perhaps most importantly, we are offered a glimpse into the real genius behind Mr. Shulman's work - his understanding of and his eye for using light as muse.

The images captured by Mr. Shulman represent an ideal, a perfection that is rarely achievable on this physical plane. He transports us into his world allowing an escape (for a time) into a realm of gracious living, where design lifts the spirit out of the mundane and into simple, non-cluttered bliss.  Mr. Shulman created art from art, yet he is shown in the film humbled, surprised and amazed that so many people seem to care about his life's work.  That makes him instantly loveable and leaves you saddened that you never got the chance to shake his hand.",1328832000,,1094,4.787234042553192
4073241,5,B00366BBU8,"If you are a fan of Modern architecture you must own/watch this documentary!

Thanks to Julius Shulman's lens generations of people have been able to enjoy and ""enter"" such wonderful masterpieces.",1324598400,,359,4.901639344262295
4073242,5,B00366BBU8,"The Camera is the least important element in photography, says Julius Shulman.  I have to agree, you've got to have vision first, and Julius certainly did.  His photographs have become icons seen by millions around the world.  He admits that luck had a lot to do with it, but what he did with with that was to create an enduring legacy for the world to enjoy.

This is a great documentary about the man behind the images, and his passion for Modernist Architecture.  This is a must see for people who enjoy architectural photography and architecture.

A heart warming look at the man and his career.",1323907200,,599,4.60377358490566

4073257,5,B00366BBU8,"I just watched this courtesy of Amazon's new perk for Prime members, and I really enjoyed it.  As one trying to learn more about photography and what makes a great photo, I found this film about the life of Julius Shulman, his photographs, and the discussions on architecture very engaging.

4073258,5,B00366BBU8,"I have seen the movie, ""Visual Acoustics"" several times before, at its debut and at several film festivals since.  Julius Shulman was a wonderful friend that taught me so much during the last five years of his life.  I purchased the film to keep his memory vivid in my consciousness, and to share with others I meet along the way.

4073260,3,B00366BBU8,"After waiting for nearly a year for the chance to see this, I had so hoped that this documentary would be worthy of Shulman and his extraordinary work. As mentioned in the video Modernist Shulman did not like Post Modernism architecture. Oddly what we have here, to present Julius Shulman born 1910 died 2009, is a dizzying Post Modernist chop chop documentary. I am absolutely enthralled by Shulman's photo work. And apart from the style of film making, what is most maddening is that Shulman's photographs, the very reason why the video should have been made, are usually on the screen for a period of less than four seconds each - four seconds! And during those sparse moments, Shulman's photos are moved around, swept across, have distracting CGI animated roads threading below - just too much razzle dazzle. Painfully, there is even a segment where a cartoon character is animated to walk in front of a few of Shulman's photos - the impact is unbelievably amateurish at best. Shulman's work was used and experimented with like raw materials to show off what the filmmakers can do instead of showing us what Shulman did. If you have ever been at, or in, a great work of architecture you know that understanding it, the space, your presence - takes time. I found myself continuously pausing the video just for the chance to really see these historic, architectural photos. The video offers far too many distractions such as people making needless comments and who really should not be in the video. The filmmaker and his crew did not need to be in the video, movie stars and their spouses need not have been included. Experts did not have to endlessly offer their reasons as to why Shulman is great - the photos could have done that and in the most meaningful way possible. Within this documentary there is a video that could be pared down into a nice informative piece. Having Shulman on film is essential. Yet overall, the chopped up peppy editing style of trying to include too much stuff betrayed him. Shulman and his work are truly great - a comment that relates well to his view on greatness is in the bonus material. Actually, I think you can get a better sense of Shulman from the straightforward bonus material that was left out of the finished product. The trailer as well, in many ways, is better than the finished film. Also, it was nice to hear Dustin Hoffman as narrator throughout. For me, Hoffman's presence connected well to the great documentary series he hosted on Pollock, deKooning, Smith, Gorky, and Kline in the early eighties. I wish the Shulman filmmakers had seen those works.",1282867200,53,2605,4.740088105726873
4073261,5,B00366BBU8,"This tribute to the architectural photographer Julius Shulman is a joy to view.  Having grown up in the 50's and taking in everything about architecture and decoration at that time, Julius Shulman's photographs were memorable in every way.  The photographs of the Case Study Houses during the 50's painted a picture of the idealistic post-war lifestyle.  The simplistic elegance of the architecture and decoration of the period is captured in Mr. Shulman's beautifully staged photography.  This DVD was produced shortly before Mr. Shulman's death and his sharp wit and vibrant personality are fun to view as he discusses photographs he had taken 60 years before.  His memory and recall of every detail is unbelievable.",1282435200,,718,5.2631578947368425
4073262,5,B00366BBU8,"What a surprise this film was. My husband rented it for me from Netflix and I wondered why. How ashamed I am now that I did not know who Julius Shulman was. I love photography and as soon as I saw his photos on the screen, I knew I'd seen them before. Masterful photographer of architecture -- but not necessarily the big impressive buildings; he found ways to express the small masterpiece houses as well. And to top it off, what a charming man he was! By the end of the filming he was 98, but still the life of the party. Not only charming, but so interesting to listen to. If you met this guy at a party, you would want to sit down at his feet and hear as many of his stories as possible. As another reviewer posted, I am now purchasing the DVD as it's definitely a keeper. Well worth the investment.  And I'm searching out his books to learn more about his photography as well.

I rate it as 3-stars because it provides little or no insight into the working methods and/or the aesthetic principles that drove the artist, even though he was both alive, cognizant to speak of them, and a willing participant in the film.
