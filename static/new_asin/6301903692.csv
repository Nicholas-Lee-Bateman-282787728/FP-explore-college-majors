fan since '71! He has the BEST persona in show biz! I've seen
him dozens of times & he is the ULTIMATE showman! He's a survivor
if ever there was!.""Breaking Hearts""is a terrific LP & that WAS
an outstanding Tour! Diehards like me always say those sorts of
things! Because we stuck with EJ thruout his career,between the
Highs & Lows/Ups & Downs/Fun & Tragedy. He's been thru it all!
This vid proves his voice is as powerful as ever (this was after
his throat surgury from the late '70's)He sings a few octaves
lower & I think it amplifies his beautiful range!",1044576000,4,621,4.362068965517241
