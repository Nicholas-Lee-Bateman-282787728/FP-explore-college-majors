4081466,5,B0037MNCEY,This workout is a great mix of yoga and strength training.  Lots of strength training!  Mandy also has a great sense of humor.  I love it!,1271289600,5,138,4.230769230769231
4081467,5,B0037MNCEY,Okay! THIS was what I have been searching for...I have not worked out this hard without a full gym.  And results in every area of your body is quickly recognized after just a couple weeks of doing this workout few times a week! It truely is the best workout I have ever done and I didn't need any special equipment! Peaceful yet intense yoga.  She does have a slight George Michael Syndrom (obcession with her butt) still worth every penny! Love it love it!!!!,1271116800,5,460,4.464285714285714
4081468,5,B0037MNCEY,Really great video that keeps you going. A fun and inspiring workout every time. I hope she comes out with more videos.,1270252800,3,119,4.454545454545454
4081469,5,B0037MNCEY,"I highly recommend this DVD. She allows you to get into the Yoga pose and holds it so you can feel what she is explaining.
She is very down to earth in her explainations and I like her sense of humor throughout the DVD.  It makes you want more!
Great DVD and gives you a solid workout.",1270080000,3,285,4.0
4081470,5,B0037MNCEY,"This is not a traditional yoga workout. It is a hybrid workout that combines yoga with some traditional toning moves. Mandy had a wonderful sense of humor, you feel like your working out along side your best friend, and it's a good workout. Again this is not a traditional yoga workout so if that's what your after this is not it.",1269820800,3,330,4.426229508196721
4081471,1,B0037MNCEY,"When I saw that Jennifer Aniston's yoga instructor was putting out a DVD I couldn't wait to purchase it - who doesn't want to look like Jennifer Aniston?  I have been doing yoga regularly, both at home and with an instructor for about 6 years and am always looking for new yoga workouts.  What a disappointment this DVD is!

First, the cover promises 2 complete 30-minute workouts and one longer 55 minute workout.  What it doesn't tell you is that the 2 30- minute workouts are identical except that one provides instruction and the other does not.  In addition, the longer workout is just the same 30-minute workout with a more traditional sun-salute series stuck onto the beginning.

The 30 minute workouts are really not yoga at all - I felt like I was back in my college dorm room doing Jane Fonda!  The sun salute series is impossible to follow unless you are actually looking at the screen which is obviously not practical.  Also, the workout is very disjointed - there is a lot of standing around while Mandy explains what's coming up.  There is absolutely no flow.

I guess if I'm going to look like Jennifer, I'm going to have to do it alone!",1268438400,264,1152,4.548543689320389
4081472,5,B0037MNCEY,Mandy is inspiring. Yogalosphy is a workout for your body and your mind. It's fun. It's intense. I took forward to it and feel like I'm making a difference...in many ways. She says working out should be a celebration and to dig what you got and love what you have....All while making you sweat. I like that. Thank you Mandy!,1267142400,2,324,4.416666666666667
4081473,5,B0037MNCEY,"I have practiced several types of yoga for many years. I wasn't sure about the combination of yoga and traditional exercises but I really like it. I find this DVD to be very refreshing. There are several different options. There's the 30 minute workout combining yoga and toning exercises - this can be done with or without instruction. There are four more short sections - a sun salutation series, warrior poses, balancing poses, and seated stretches. You can combine it all for a 55 minute session or pick and choose. I don't usually like music with my yoga but the music on this DVD is great. Mandy is also lots of fun with a great sense of humor. I always feel happy when I finish. Some of the cueing is a little off but after a couple of times it's fine. As another reviewer said, people who are interested in very classical yoga may not like it, however, I would have put myself in that category before trying it. Looking forward to Yogalosophy 2!",1267056000,13,953,4.482758620689655
4081474,5,B0037MNCEY,"This is maybe not the DVD for people who are looking for traditional yoga but for those of us who like the yoga poses combined with excercises this is THE workout DVD. It is both fun and efficient, you can either do just the workout part that takes about 30 min or do more traditional yoga with the excercise part incorporated if you have more time. Mandy is an excellent instructor with a sens of humor. I am impatiantly waiting for her to do more DVD's...",1266796800,67,457,4.325581395348837
4081475,1,B0037MNCEY,"Zero Stars. This is the worst instructional DVD ever!  Also the most ego driven yoga teacher I've seen ""Watch me"", "" I have A Great Ass"", ""I'm on Location"". You don't even know when she switches sides because she doesn't tell you. She thinks you are just watching her instead of actually doing the yoga poses. Waste of money. Oh, they require 1 star to post this review. How about one star minus one.",1442793600,4,400,4.405405405405405
4081476,2,B0037MNCEY,"Let me start by saying I knew exactly what I was getting myself into when I bought this DVD. I did some research and decided to go for it. I'm not necessarily a yoga purist, so I thought i could handle it. I had no idea what I was missing from my research. This DVD has a very home video feel to it. The instructor seems.......a bit kooky, to be honest with you. All this talk about her ""@$$"" drove me absolutely crazy. I don't get the hype for this one at all. Perhaps it has something to do with Jennifer Aniston?? Who knows. The workout isn't terrible, which is why I gave it two stars, as opposed to one star. But, there are much, much better vinyasa flow DVDs out there. Skip this one.",1441324800,,690,4.118518518518519

4081480,4,B0037MNCEY,It is a good workout. Mandy can be a bit tedious. It emphasizes workout over yoga which is fine with me.,1436313600,,104,4.0
4081481,5,B0037MNCEY,I absolutely love this workout system! The combination of yoga and Tony exercises make you not realize that you're working out. Until the next day when your sore!,1424304000,,162,4.821428571428571

4081487,5,B0037MNCEY,she is hilarious and the dvd makes you feel wonderful after.,1412208000,,60,4.545454545454546
4081488,3,B0037MNCEY,"It is SUCH a good workout.  If only the cues were better-timed (or timed at all), and she didn't talk so much about nothing. I so wish she would redo this workout.  It really is one of the best I've used for a quick hit-all-the-right-places workout, but the major drawback is having to constantly look up - not easy in Down Dog (or most any other pose) to see where she is. I finally started watching the Silent Workout option (with just the music) and counting a slow 1-8 and can usually stay on track that way.  Just keep counting and breathing 1-1000, 2-1000, etc...",1410134400,4,569,4.4
4081489,3,B0037MNCEY,"This is a good toning workout. The problem with it is, she doesn't continue talking throughout the workout so unless you're watching the tv the entire time, you can get lost or stay in a pose too long because she has moved on to something else without telling you. its difficult to be in some yoga poses and watch the tv the entre time.",1404864000,5,336,4.265625
4081490,3,B0037MNCEY,This is not a good DVD if you are looking for straight up yoga. Mandy incorporates some muscle toning exercises in with the yoga. It is a good workout but it wasn't what I was expecting.,1403654400,,186,4.194444444444445
4081491,5,B0037MNCEY,I love this video. This video is very helpful with explaining how to do yoga and helps with posture and breathing,1402704000,,113,4.428571428571429

4081494,4,B0037MNCEY,This DVD provides good instruction and is easy to follow the instructor.  It is also suitable for a beginner or intermediate practice.,1392595200,,134,5.090909090909091

4081496,5,B0037MNCEY,I really love this workout and I really love Mandy!  She runs through the workout expertly and with a Great sense of humor.  I highly recommend and did buy extra for Xmas gifts,1389225600,,176,4.303030303030303
4081497,5,B0037MNCEY,This video is very relaxing & peaceful. It has good quality picture & sound. Some moves are easy & some are harder but she has good adaptations for anyone.,1389052800,,155,4.379310344827586
4081498,4,B0037MNCEY,"I am sitting here with sore legs and tush after doing this video yesterday. I think if you are looking for a fantastic body weight toning and stretching video this is worth the purchase. However, if you're looking for a pure yoga workout you will be disappointed. I am new to lifting and body weight exercise so this is nice place for me to start without feeling like I will hurt myself. I recommend it to people interested in body weight, old school toning, and stretching exercises.",1388707200,,484,4.574712643678161
4081499,5,B0037MNCEY,This is one of my favorites for toning.  You can feel your muscles burning and you know that it's working.,1386547200,,106,4.3
4081500,2,B0037MNCEY,The half hour workout with her commentary is terrible. In fact its just her talking about how great her body is. I wish i could return this.,1383436800,,140,4.222222222222222
4081501,5,B0037MNCEY,Love Mandy's attitude and fun approach to her yoga workout.  I talked my fiance into doing the workout and he admitted that what she adds to yoga makes for a great all around workout.,1382659200,,183,4.382352941176471
4081502,1,B0037MNCEY,I was very disappointed to find out that it's an old DVD I already have with a different cover. I want my money back!,1381622400,2,117,3.9166666666666665
4081503,5,B0037MNCEY,Love! And I don't like workout videos. She keeps the movements flowing and isn't cheesy or annoying. And it's a great workout!,1380758400,,126,4.7727272727272725
4081504,4,B0037MNCEY,This DVD should only have one production not another with a different cover.  This DVD goes with the book and the other should not be offered.  If offered - change the routine in total.  Otherwise its a waste of money and energy.,1379030400,3,229,4.404761904761905
4081505,5,B0037MNCEY,"Just a heads up that this DVD is EXACTLY the same workout as the Gaiam, green case Yogalosophy DVD. You don't need to buy both!",1378598400,8,127,4.12
4081506,5,B0037MNCEY,"I like this video because you can use it with instruction from Mandy to get used to the poses and exercises and then later without any coaching. The version without coaching has positive messages that pop up on the TV screen during the workout. I like this because it helps to keep you focused on the benefits of the workout rather than any pain you may be experiencing. If you are proficient at yoga poses, I'd probably just get the book to learn how to do the strength training moves that she adds to the poses.",1377388800,,513,4.354166666666667
4081507,5,B0037MNCEY,"I really like this DVD. She has included the exercises with voiceover help and without, which really makes it nice. Simple instructions to exercises that will definitely make a difference in legs and thighs!! Love this girl.",1376265600,,224,5.081081081081081
4081508,4,B0037MNCEY,"I do like this DVD although I have to modify quite a bit for now. I got the book as well so I can do the routing or movements on my own too. There are several segments to choose from so depending on how much time you have and how much you want to do, you can choose your routine. Mandy does talk a lot throughout. I would however, like to find a DVD that verbally walks you through the routine so you don't have to try to watch the TV while holding a pose.",1375488000,,456,3.8105263157894735
4081509,4,B0037MNCEY,"I am glad I bought this dvd to go along with the yogalosophy book I purchased.
It would be good on its own but its important to note that the workout could become redundant.
Hopefully, Mandy Ingber will offer more workout dvds to add variety.
Also...I guess I am pretty particular...but I think the verbal guiding from pose to pose could be a little better.
I am in no way discouraging people from getting this video!! It is amazing and I know it is a great benefit to me.
But, I do feel like I have to mention this detail.  I am particular.",1374883200,,541,4.252427184466019
4081510,5,B0037MNCEY,"Not your usual yoga practice. Not relaxing- but I was sore for days afterwards and got a great work out. She also made me belly laugh, which was great.",1373673600,,151,4.241379310344827
4081511,5,B0037MNCEY,"Mandy is refreshingly 'real' and 'modern'. Her style of yoga is similar to my local yoga teachers and when I'm not in her class, I have Mandy to keep me yoga-flowing. Mandy is not boring and you don't loose interest, you just give your mind over to her and listen and breath and.....Namaste....everyone :)",1373241600,,305,4.666666666666667
4081512,5,B0037MNCEY,"I bought the Yogalosphy book and allthough it's a pretty basic book, I found that after going along with this dvd, I was actually doing some of the moves in the routine incorrectly!! Buying the dvd has helped me follow along with her on the yogalosphy routine and I am forever confident when doing so. She makes you laugh, feel good about yourself, and never tells you to push harder... she actually tells you to listen to your body. Mandy is patient in the dvd which helps me slow down and really feel each movement to the fullest. Sometimes, people speed through moves thus not creating the effect you are trying to achieve.
The dvd is perfect! Wish there were more moves to follow since she has a bunch of ""extra credit"" moves to try in her book that I seem to have a hard time getting but if they were in the dvd, it would make the book and the dvd a total package. Overall, I bought both her book and dvd and I am satisfied with the results! Anyone can try it!!",1372723200,3,966,4.255434782608695
4081513,1,B0037MNCEY,The copy I got skipped really badly to where it was not usable. The little bit I was able to see seemed ok.,1372032000,,107,3.6956521739130435
4081514,5,B0037MNCEY,"I love this DVD. Mandy Ingber is encouraging, funny, and a great instructor! It was a great workout and she made me giggle, too!",1371254400,,128,4.375
4081515,5,B0037MNCEY,"Loved the book & the video, I love yoga & Many's video makes it so easy to use, love it love it!!!",1371168000,,98,3.5
4081516,5,B0037MNCEY,I was surprised to see the negative reviews that this DVD received.  I own many workout DVD's and this one has quickly become one of my favorites.  Mandy is an excellent instructor.  She is easy to follow along with and allows for individual ability and growth. I have seen and felt results in muscle tone almost immediately.  I would definitely recommend this DVD.  I hope that there will be more to come.,1371081600,,406,4.583333333333333
4081517,4,B0037MNCEY,"Very effective - the positions/movements can be tough, but Mandy Ingber is a very pleasant teacher, and makes positioning clear.  Her personality is upbeat, which is important because some of the moves are hard!  But they are all very effective - love these workouts when I have a little more time.",1370649600,,298,4.823529411764706
4081518,3,B0037MNCEY,"This is not for beginners to yoga.  This might be for people who already do yoga, but are interested in supplementing their practice with toning.  It's familiar with yoga poses in between, but more heavy on the toning exercises.  I would call it Tonelosophy instead, but I guess Yogalosophy sounds more cool and Hollywoodish.

But, for 30 minutes, I have had better workouts with other videos.  I'm not sure if I will use Yogalosophy again.  When I finished the first 30 minute workout, I started wondering who I could give it to that might want to try it.

When I bought it, I thought that $15 was about the same price as a yoga class (although it usually runs 60-90 minutes), so I don't really think of it as that much of a waste.  Been there, tried that.  And, if I ever want to do it again, it won't cost anything.",1368662400,,818,4.364238410596027
4081519,4,B0037MNCEY,My wife and I used this DVD to help get our mid-40s bodies limbered up. We walk every day but felt like we needed something more to stretch those muscles that don't get used much even in a vigorous walk.,1366675200,,203,4.1
4081520,4,B0037MNCEY,"I bought both Yogalosophy and Mandy Ingber's Yogalosophy Workout DVD when Amazon suggested ""buy both for only blah blah blah"".  But in actuality ... they are the same DVD.  One is just put out by Gaiam and one is not.  The workout itself is great and the extras seem to be as well.  Totally worth it to buy ONE or THE OTHER but don't be fooled into buying both as they are exactly the same right down to the intros by Mandy and by Jennifer.  Luckily I have a sister I can give one to.  :)",1365552000,7,488,4.03125
4081521,5,B0037MNCEY,"I had heard quite a few things about this DVD, and decided to give it a shot. I absolutely love this workout, and Mandy is truly amazing at what she does. I love that this DVD gave me an amazing workout in such a short amount of time, and is not too difficult. I've done other DVD's in the past, but they usually get boring within the first month, but Mandy's DVD is fun, and I love that I can break it down into a specific area I would like to workout. I'm very athletic, but would still recommend this to even a novice to working out.",1364688000,,536,4.018691588785047
4081522,1,B0037MNCEY,"I ordered both of Mandy's videos from amazon.  Upon receipt and after opening the packaging, the actual DVD was exactly the same for both.  Because they were opened, I could not return one of the DVDs.

I totally wasted my money on two of the same DVDs in different style boxes.

Very disappointed!",1359504000,5,298,4.566037735849057
4081523,5,B0037MNCEY,"Not only was this product an absolute wonderful purchase, but the delivery was timely as well. (Which is always appreciated!)

If you are looking for a fun, more relaxed, and humorous yoga adventure, Mandy Ingber's Yogalosophy is for you. I bought this product looking for a fun change from other yoga DVD's that I have and it is. You have the choice to make your experience as simple or as difficult as you are looking for. I love how she adds in humor to help make you through tough spots as well, it really lightens the mood. It's a hard workout, but I can already feel the changes in my body, and strength is one of them. The repetitions that she has you do not only increases strength but you can feel it toning as well. Yoga and an aerobic workout in one!

Definitely give this DVD a try! I'm sure you'll be satisfied.",1359244800,2,824,4.3441558441558445
4081524,5,B0037MNCEY,"I do yoga and Pilates in the gym but still love to do the 25 min music only and stretch portion of this workout at least 2-3 times a week. It gets my heart rate up and is great for toning and no matter how many times I do it my legs still burn especially during the crescent/lunge section. For people who struggle with the lack of cuing once you do the workout a few times you quickly become familiar with it, I just count to myself and no longer need to look at the TV to see the changes between moves. I prefer the music only section, the soundtrack is excellent. You get an amazing strength/toning workout  n those 25 mins and the 5 min stretch really has helped with flexibility and has improved my performance during running and spinning.",1347148800,,743,4.2695035460992905
4081525,5,B0037MNCEY,"But I felt like I needed to share my experience. I find it so weird when other reviewers say ""PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS!"" just because it didn't work for them. Just give the opinion, and let others make up their own mind.
Anyway, I've done this DVD for about a month now, and personally, I LOVE IT. I've done many different workouts over the last 20+ years, and this is one of my all-time favorites. True, it's not a ""traditional"" yoga workout, but it doesn't claim to be. it's a mix of yoga poses, with standard toning exercises such as lunges, squats, sit ups, etc. but for some reason, it just works for me. I can do Jillian Michaels for weeks and barely see a difference, I do this workout and all of sudden I have arm and leg muscles I haven't seen in years. I feel like I get a full body workout- and my body just seems to respond to it. I feel exhausted yet relaxed when the workout is over.
The cuing is a little off. sometimes she starts a new set without saying anything, but after doing the workout a few times you learn what you should be doing and when to do it.  As far as Mandy, some people don't like that she talks so much, but I find her charming. she's funny and real. So she mentions ""i've got a great a**"" a few times. so what. I want a great a** too or I wouldn't be doing this workout!
I recommend this DVD and hope you give it a try. I actually bought an extra one just in case this one breaks.

p.s. The first time I did the DVD, I kept thinking ""this voice! i know this voice! why do I know this voice?!"" it drove me so crazy I had to stop the DVD and look Mandy up on IMDB. I realized I recognized her from her role as Annie Tortelli (Carla's daughter-in-law) on Cheers. Just a little fun fact for Cheers fans!",1338940800,76,1733,4.064327485380117
4081526,4,B0037MNCEY,"nice video, good arrival time. I was always looking for combining yoga and other exercises. this video was exactly what I was looking for. I highly recommend this video to anyone who wold want to get a slik body.",1336608000,2,212,4.461538461538462
4081527,1,B0037MNCEY,There is absolutely no cueing going on.... impossible to follow unless you can see the screen... which is impossible if you are in down dog.  she'll go through 10 moves without saying anything.,1333929600,3,193,4.848484848484849
4081528,4,B0037MNCEY,"I like this but I'd recommend doing a good warm-up before.  She goes into some pretty intense leg stuff right away and doesn't really get you warmed up. I think it's hard to do all that if you aren't warmed up properly, not to mention risk of injury.  Otherwise I think it's great and would recommend it if you like yoga/power yoga type workouts.",1332806400,2,346,4.390625
4081529,5,B0037MNCEY,"Way better than any other yoga workout I've tried. Mandy is funny, bubbly and encouraging. Love the breathtaking view, as it easily relaxes my mind, as though I'm on a vacation.

I used to shy away from tricep dips, but the other exercises helped me get the form right.

The bow and superman poses are excellent for stretching out the front of the body, which helps fight fatigue.

Do the fully loaded challenge at least once a week and you'll see results.",1331683200,2,456,4.536585365853658

I have purchases/used many exercise DVDs over the years, and none of the instructors have had the warm, genuine, funny energy that Mandy has.

The music is great, Mandy is a great ""host"", and the ocean at the background makes me almost feel like I was in sunny California too.

You can't keep looking at the tv when you are in down dog to see when she is moving onto the next pose.  Why can't she give a cue to start the next pose???  She expects that you should know the flow and how long to hold each posture before moving on.  Please, DO NOT waste your money on this dvd!!  She needs to redo the dvd with better cuing and then it would be an awesome workout.  Try the Exhale Core Fusion series instead!!",1307923200,8,550,4.027777777777778

However, I am at the point where I memorize the routine, and don't need to look up at the TV to see what point she's at. If you just stick with this workout, try it on the silent version and you will remember it by heart!

4081540,4,B0037MNCEY,"NOTE:  I received a free review copy of this DVD from the web site Metapsychology Online Reviews; you can read a more complete version of my review on that site.

YOGALOSOPHY purports to be a blend of traditional yoga postures and toning exercises.  The DVD features a 35-minute ""Express"" workout plus a longer ""Fully Loaded"" option; the latter adds ""Breakout Segments,"" or additional chapters which are also featured under the Extras submenu.  The Main Menu of the DVD reads as follows:

Introduction -- Mandy Ingber
Introduction -- Jennifer Aniston
Yogalosophy Express with Cuing
Yogalosophy Express with Music Alone
Fully Loaded Challenge
EXTRAS

Ingber is working out alone on a large patio-type area overlooking the ocean.  The background music is quite eclectic, a mix of vocals plus jazzy and almost techno tunes.  For the 35-minute Yogalosophy Express, Ingber oddly combines both live cuing and voiceover instruction, with names of the exercises appearing on the screen.  She states that she will be doing ""eight of everything,"" including eight breaths followed by eight repetitions and then eight pulses--this is the basic format, although Ingber sometimes deviates slightly from this pattern.  The exercises in the Express workout are as follows:  calf raises -- squats/crescent lunges -- temple/pli&eacute; squats -- down dog w/leg lifts -- cat/cow -- fire hydrant -- bow -- superman -- plank/push-ups -- side plank -- floor tricep dips -- bridge/pelvic tilts -- reclined twist -- abs work (crunches into boat/v-ups) -- brief seated meditation.

As noted above, the Fully Loaded Challenge is an extended version of the Yogalosophy Express practice, as it includes add-on chapters which are listed under Extras.  The entire Extras submenu appears as follows (I have added approximate times in parentheses):

Sun Salutation (7.5 minutes)
Rock Block (3.5 minutes)
Balance Challenge (3 minutes)
Stretch (6 minutes)
Mandy on Breath (<1 minute)
Mandy on Yogalosophy (<1 minute)
Mandy on Vision Mat (2.5 minutes)

The first four of these segments are incorporated into the Fully Loaded Challenge practice.  The routine begins with the Sun Salutation.  Ingber takes the sun series at a nice, measured pace, adding a pause of five breaths in down dog and building up to hops forward/back as well as three-legged plank.  (Note:  it is easier to follow Ingber here if you have your mat perpendicular to your television rather than parallel to her.)  The ""Rock Block"" is a series of warrior poses which Ingber holds for five breaths per pose.  She moves through warrior 2, reverse warrior, and side angle, and then repeats the entire series on the other side.  Next is the Balance Challenge sequence.  Ingber begins with a knee hold, moving into tree pose and then continuing to balance on the same side for warrior 3 and front leg extension; she finishes on the second side.  Following the balance work, Ingber moves through the entire Yogalosophy Express portion.  Finally, she concludes with the Stretch segment.  The postures in this series include lunge, pigeon, one-legged forward bend, cobbler's forward bend, and full forward bend (no savasana), bringing the complete Fully Loaded Challenge to 55 minutes total.

I've been practicing yoga for almost ten years now; personally, I usually turn to yoga to stretch and relax, not to ""work out.""  Given this, I wasn't particularly expecting to enjoy this DVD, as I don't generally click with power yoga or other quick-moving vinyasa-style yoga practices.  However, I was pleasantly surprised to discover that what Ingber offers is quite different.  I found that the toning exercises, which are performed at a moderate pace, flowed very nicely from the yoga postures, making this an excellent yoga practice for building strength.  I enjoyed the overall tempo and never felt that it was either rushed or too slow.  Of course, those who do tend to prefer fast-paced yoga practices are likely to be disappointed with this DVD.

There are several other caveats worth mentioning as well.  First of all, Ingber's cuing can be a bit difficult to follow, as she does not always alert the viewer to when she is switching to the next move/next side.  If you are used to counting on your own, that will help, as for the most part, Ingber does stick to the 8-count format; also, as noted above, turning your mat to face your television may be beneficial as well.  Another major issue is Ingber's personally, which came across as lighthearted and tongue-in-cheek to me but which might rub some people the wrong way.  The most salient example of this is during the squat sequence, when she states that she has a mantra that she uses:  that mantra is ""I have a great a--,"" which Ingber repeats several times.

In conclusion, I would recommend this DVD to those who do not take a purist approach to their yoga practice, who want a yoga routine that is challenging without being fast-moving, and finally, who do not mind some irreverence from their yoga instruction.",1305072000,95,5000,5.0734394124847
4081541,5,B0037MNCEY,"Honestly, I cannot say enough about the genius that is Mandy Ingber.  She is inspiring, funny, adorable, incredibly toned, and so amazing.  I would love to be her friend AND her yoga client.

This is one of the best yoga DVDs out there, and it really tones you as well as relaxes you.  You get an amazing workout, but you also get a great meditative experience.  I sweat so much, but she keeps you relaxed enough that you don't even realize how hard you are working.

I highly recommend this DVD.  It has changed my life.",1304467200,2,521,4.364583333333333
4081542,3,B0037MNCEY,"Although the 30-minute routine Mandy does is great and challenging, it's the ONLY workout on the entire DVD. Even if you do the 55-minute version, it's just a quick warm up with a few poses, one flow and then it's back to the same 30-minute routine. I was very disappointed there weren't more options to chose from for workouts. I'll also agree with others that her cues aren't the best for when to switch poses and her timing can be inconsistent when going between your right and left side. Overall, I think there are better yoga DVDs that give you a variety of routines for the same price.",1303862400,3,591,4.481481481481482
4081543,4,B0037MNCEY,"I am very athletic, doing cardio and lifting weights 3-4 times a week, for 15 years.  I needed a change in my routine and turned to this video based on good reviews.  I found it challenging and felt very relaxed afterward.  It is not exactly yoga, more calisthenics, though she does do some yoga poses. The only caution I offer is that she talks you into the correct posture of a pose, which is good, but she leaves you there while she discusses it.  I found I was working one side of my body more than the other.  She states in the beginning of the video that you will be in each pose for 8 breaths, so once I became familiar with the routine I counted for myself so that I got an even workout on each side.  Other that that it is a great video.",1301529600,5,746,4.075342465753424
4081544,5,B0037MNCEY,Yogalosophy is great!  I've worked out with personal trainers and not toned up any faster.  I love the combination of strength and stretch moves.,1301270400,,145,5.0
4081545,5,B0037MNCEY,"LOVE LOVE LOVE this Yoga DVD! I feel so much better on the days that I do it.......and Mandy's personality is one that helps you to enjoy the DVD each time you do it. I was also amazed at how much I ""felt it"" the next day!",1300060800,2,222,3.74468085106383
4081546,5,B0037MNCEY,"I have Mandy's Yogalosophy DVD and absolutely love it! It seems to me that some of the negative reviews are more focused on the presentation of the DVD rather than the actual workout that is being provided by Mandy. I truly believe that anyone who completes this workout could not deny the fact that it is an amazing full body muscle toning workout that leaves you feeling exhilarated!

Mandy considers this workout a hybrid of yoga moves and muscle toners and I think it is obvious that this is more modern type yoga and that she is not following a strict yoga practice. She knows what will produce results! Mandy has a unique teaching style and a very light-hearted approach. That's why I love it!

I love the fact that Mandy is cracking jokes throughout the workout. I really feel that she is being sincere and is relating to the audience. She has a sense of humor which you don't normally see in workout DVDs, particularly yoga. It's so refreshing! The first time I worked out to this DVD, it honestly made me smile and I believe that's so important.

One review site I read mentioned a shaky camera and poor editing, and I will say that there is a spot or two where the camera was a little shaky for a second or two and I remember one spot where one pose seems to last longer than a count of 8 (but maybe its intentional), however you just need to get past that, workout at your own pace and complete your own counts. Many times throughout the workout Mandy mentions to take breaks if you need to. She allows you to be flexible so you enjoy it and keep coming back. It does require you to have some discipline and to be able to complete the workout without being spoon fed. You can't always be looking at the TV screen throughout much of the workout anyways.

I have always loved yoga hybrid and yogalates type workouts as they have always given me the results I want. Sure if you want a wind down relaxing traditional yoga session, pop in another DVD, however if you want to tone your muscles and see results, this is the way to go! You have to overlook the minor flaws of any editing and just work it out. I always feel so amazing (refreshed, energized, strong, happy) after completing even the 30 minute portion of the DVD workout and I always seem to feel the effects into the following day! I personally recommend this workout to anyone who loves yoga hybrids, yogalates or pilates, is looking for full body muscle toning, and has a sense of humor with an open mind!

PS: In addition to the Yogalosophy DVD, there are more workout downloads available on Mandy's site. I plan to download them and I look forward to her second DVD to be released sometime this year.",1296691200,,2673,4.42479674796748

4081548,4,B0037MNCEY,"I really like this workout. It is not too long, and I like the options you can add to make it just a bit longer.  Her mantra is something I'm now saying to myself every time I work out: ""I have a great ___.""  Let's just say assets! I could definitely feel this workout the next day! That lets me know it is working.  The only issue I have with this workout is that she often doesn't say exactly what position she is getting into, and if you are in downward dog or something where you can't look at the screen, you don't know what she is doing. Other than that, GREAT workout!",1296172800,,575,4.070796460176991
4081549,5,B0037MNCEY,"Wow, I'm surprised at the bad reviews for this. I can only assume those people don't have a very good sense of humor, because Mandy is HILARIOUS. Her personality and talking throughout are the highlight of this DVD for me.

I suppose I can see how people into traditional yoga might not think this is strict enough or whatever, but that's the reason I love it...she's fun and doesn't take things so seriously. So if you've never tried yoga before (I hadn't) because you think it's too hippy-dippy, new age, weird, give this a try, because in addition to a great workout, she keeps you entertained throughout.

4081552,5,B0037MNCEY,"I met Mandy at the Self Magazine Workout in the Park and decided to try out her DVD. Like everyone, my schedule is hectic and I often can't find time to workout. For the past few months I've been putting in the DVD at 6am every morning and doing the 30 min workout to start my day.  I find the toning exercises mixed with the yoga gets my blood flowing and really kick starts my work day.  I think with any DVD you can't do it once and expect to see instant results. Just from doing the 30 min workout every morning, my arms are leaner and I don't struggle with pushups, my core strength has increased and my legs and butt are toned with nothing wiggling.  I read the review where the woman said she felt like she was doing the Jane Fonda workout....well nobody can deny Jane Fonda had an ""epic ass"" in the 80's. I wish I could include a picture of my rear end with my review because you'd see that Mandy's toning routine will give you amazing results.",1288742400,7,952,4.191256830601093

She encourages you to ""listen to your body, not the teacher"" which is nice to see in a yoga class!!!  It's a good workout and leaves me feeling sore, stretched and ready to take on the world!  I highly recommend this as a good basic yoga DVD that you can modify according to your needs.

4081559,2,B0037MNCEY,Mandy Ingber talks constantly throughout this video. The workout itself is very good but the non stop chatter is irritating. There is a silent option but it's shorter in duration and difficult to keep looking at the TV for instruction and to keep up the routine.

Jennifer Aniston must have only been trying to help her dear friend Mandy. Honestly, Jennifer is the reason I bought it. It is choppy, easy, and a worthless workout.  I never felt as if I could get into a yoga zone. The P90X Yoga is a thousand times more challenging and fun.  After doing this DVD, I felt like I needed to go get in a real workout.

I definitely recommend it to anyone. As for some of the reviewers saying the instructions are not good - she clearly states at the beginning that you'll be doing everything for 2 sets of 8 so once she starts an excercise you know what you're in for without having to watch her or have her narrate.

I feel like this workout helps my back and as long as I'm careful to modify the section with squats I'm just fine.  The rest of it is smooth sailing. Mandy is really good at explaining the techniques with attention to form, etc. without being too chatty.  She is witty and so positive, I felt she was genuine.  I liked her style.  The sections are put together so that you can do them one at time without watching the intro. if you want. Nice music in a beautiful outdoor setting.

I never thought that yoga could cause anyone to sweat, but the poses in Yogalosophy makes me perspire, and my muscles burn after finishing the DVD.  My favorite pose featured in the Yogalosophy is crescent, and I also love the sun salutations.

I like how Ms. Ingber coaches you through the different poses, in the thirty minute workout, so that you know what to expect in the fully loaded 55 minute workout.  I also really like the more traditional excercise movements, such as lunges and squats that are infused with the yoga poses.  Ms. Ingber even refrences Jane Fonda's ""Rover's Revenge"" excercise move, from the very popular ""Jane Fonda's New Workout"", which made me smile, and feel like I at least had some idea of what I was doing, since I had never done Yoga before.

I also like the ""Extras"" portion of the DVD, where you can individually go through the yoga movements from the start of the 55 minute workout, such as the sun salutations, which is a plus for people who are new to Yoga.

Yogalosophy is a fun, well thought out yoga program that is interesting and challenging all at the same time, and I highly recommend this DVD!  :)",1272585600,11,1420,4.569169960474309
4081573,3,B0037MNCEY,"The queing on the dvd is not good.  Like other purchasers stated, she moves to another move and does not tell you and it is sort of hard to look at the tv when in down dog.  Also, the flow does not really ""flow""  she stops before every sequence to tell you what it coming up, I just want to keep moving!  She seems to be a little too into her body too, talks about how great her a*# looks and it is from doing yoga.  I thought yoga was suppose to ""remove"" the ego.

In my opinion this is not worth $30.00.  If you were paying $10.00 then I would say try it, the leg workout is not bad (lunges, plies, calenstenic sutff).

p.s. I can't imagine this is the yoga Jennifer Aniston did to get in such awesome shape.  That is the DVD I wanted.",1272153600,12,737,3.9591836734693877
4081574,5,B0037MNCEY,"First of all, I NEVER write reviews but I just had to share my experience and thoughts about this DVD...Not only am I a huge Jennifer Aniston fan, but I had been wanting to try yoga for some time. I am a stay-at-home mother of two small children and I felt like I needed something other than my treadmill for a workout. I've also known that yoga can help with stress and relaxation, so I decided to try it. I love love love Mandy Ingber! People have to remember that this is a hybrid workout, yoga poses combined with strengthening exercises. I have been doing the 30 minute workout 6 days a week for the last month and a half, and wow! My flexibility has increased beyond my imagination, I'm toning everywhere, and I actually enjoy the feeling of sinking into a pose and just letting myself feel it! I have done the 55 minute challenge a few times and really enjoy it, but the ""30 minute silent"" has become my ultimate favorite. It's quick, awesome music, calming, and it really works!",1271376000,26,986,4.423076923076923
8390632,2,B0037MNCEY,"While the workouts on this DVD show you a few good moves and Mandy is encouraging, the workouts are not long or challenging at all. I was expecting more instruction or a more class-like feel to the video, and this seems more like an informercial for the Yogalosophy brand than an actual product. In hindsight, I should have just found some free aerobics and yoga videos on youtube rather than spend the money on this product. I'm disappointed that it was so expensive and really only includes one mini workout, with two shorter pose-guide type videos.",1507852800,,551,4.75
8390633,5,B0037MNCEY,"Absolutely love this video! And lets be real don't we all want to look like her and, HELLO JENNIFER ANISTON!!! It's not easy at first but you can start slow! And listen to Mandy! If you need a break take it! You'll get stronger and better the more you do it!",1494288000,,258,4.078431372549019

8390641,5,B0037MNCEY,"I absolutely LOVE this workout! I was a beginner when I bought this but I love it! It gives you 3 workout options, the first one is with direction, one is silent and one is fully loaded with a stretch portion. I don't know how long the first two options are but I do the fully loaded option and it's about 55 minutes. I feel so great after doing this workout and it definitely works your muscles!",1447372800,5,396,4.1558441558441555
