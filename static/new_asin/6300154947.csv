7803140,2,6300154947,"A skillful software designer for a video game manufacturer, Carly Kendall (Diana Reis), has become engaged in an illicit scheme whereby she hacks into large corporate banking accounts, skimming monies from them and transferring the amounts into a ""dummy"" account shared by her with her white collar confederates in crime, only to find that their monetary ambitions equal a potentially perilous future for all those involved.  When Carly decides to keep all of the illegally gained proceeds, 3.5 million dollars, for herself, and abscond with it to Brazil, her fellow grifters are quite naturally displeased with her treachery, to the point of wishing her to be dead, and since she has encoded the hiding place of the stolen cash within the software of her most recent video game creation, Thrillkill, ""The Game That Plays You"", Carly and her somewhat bewildered sister Bobbie (Gina Massey), whom she has supposedly taken into her confidence, find themselves menaced by the other conspirators who are frantically searching for the hidden loot and becoming quite homicidal during the course of their quest. Eventually, the final survivors from the greedy group of miscreants assemble at ""the convention center"" (performed by the Ontario Science Center, in Toronto) to skirmish with each other in efforts to pare down the number of plotters, thereby increasing profits for any survivors. This film is noteworthy in one regard, that the nine principal characters are all consistent liars, and none seems to flirt with much more than a semblance of honour or loyalty, although the script does not allow for any sort of character development, but rather provides essentially one episode of taut suspense following closely upon another, generally abetted by a partially electronic score. The work's director, Anthony Kramreither, sensibly allows cinematographer John Clement to develop these scenes, as his compositions are inspiring throughout the production. It should be mentioned that several of the cast are able to occasionally vary their facial expressions, proving to be the gamest of efforts when considering a sapless screenplay.  Editing by Nick Rotundo and the director helps to provide a briskly paced, albeit less than memorable, affair.",1234915200,,2244,5.372159090909091
