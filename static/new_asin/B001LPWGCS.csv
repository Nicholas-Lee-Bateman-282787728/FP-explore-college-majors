3688507,1,B001LPWGCS,"The 2007 answer to 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding' seems to have come in the shoddy package of 'Everybody Wants to Be Italian', a long and painful 'romantic comedy'.(Just saying that feels like I'm lying in it's favor) Really, there's nothing funny about it, or in that case romantic either.

Jake Bianski, played by Jay Jablonski(so creative with the character naming) is an entirely unlikeable bozo, who runs a fish market with the help of all his much older(but still just as idiotic) Italian friends.
Jake is under the strange illusion that he's still involved with his ex-girlfriend Isabella(Marisa Petroro) although she's married with three children, and completely uninterested. Jake becomes an all out fool every year on their old anniversary, parading around the city purchasing a new suit, ring, flowers(apparently he couldn't splurge for the brain instead) and attempts to woo his soul mate once more.

Then along comes Marisa(Cerina Vincent) a beautiful veterinarian, whom Jake's Tweedledee & Tweedledum-esque friends Steve(John Kapelos) and Gianluca(John Enos III) find and persuade into meeting their single(they forgot to mention psychotic) friend.

Somehow Jake and Marisa begin to nurture a friendship, though Jake insists he still has a girlfriend, therefore they cannot be more.

Of course Jake eventually finds out he really does love Marisa and follows her to the ends of the earth(or in this case, just Italy) to involve her in his schizophrenic mind, and propose to her.(Forget trying a relationship, you bag-o-crazy)

The film drags along, so very slowly and all you do is wait and pray for some sort of redemption that never comes.

If I didn't already, I'm sure I don't want to be Italian now.",1237766400,6,1714,5.14748201438849
3688508,5,B001LPWGCS,I am so glad that I found this movie. It is very cleverly written romantic comedy that had me laughing for two hours. This is as good of a movie as I have seen in a long time.  Highly recommended to anyone who watches movies.,1236988800,11,225,4.0
3688509,3,B001LPWGCS,"It's an old story.  Fish market owner wants girl he dumped 8 years ago, who is married with kids.  Friends introduce him to sexy veterinarian, whose clock is running, but he wants what he can't have. I bought this movie because I am a Cerina Vincent fan.  I wasn't dissapointed.  Not the greatest of film. It is entertaining.  Something I would watch again if there is nothing good on TV.  Which is most of the time.",1235692800,2,416,4.407894736842105

3688531,3,B001LPWGCS,the only problem isn't the film-it's just that too many people have done that same joke. If I saw it about 5 or 10 years ago I know I woul have liked it a lot more.,1448755200,,164,3.5833333333333335
3688532,5,B001LPWGCS,"Extremely literate, intelligent script.  Quirky premises and lovable characters.  Superb acting.  Hard to believe a smart person like Jake can be so incredibly dopey, yet you know he has a good heart and you fervently wish for him to find happiness.  Totally warmhearted film. LOVED IT.  The credits are really worth watching, too.",1448323200,,331,5.169811320754717
3688533,5,B001LPWGCS,"This is an average movie, yet I found it quite enjoyable and funny. I think it's because of my Italian ancestry, and sometimes the characters reminded me of my cousins.  Although some characters are stereotyped, often have some basis of truth, which then get exaggerated in movies. I just happened to find it funny.

It's a cute, fun movie and love story. It was worth the price I paid. As my godfather always said ""Everybody wants to be Italian""  I may have enjoyed this movie more because, as I said earlier, it reminded me of some....not all...of my cousins. Perhaps this movie is more enjoyable to younger Italian Americans or to those who grew up with them. As I stated earlier, stereotypes are usually exaggerations of some truths. Enjoy!",1445212800,,744,4.751937984496124

3688536,5,B001LPWGCS,I loved this movie.  Loved the humor and all the scenes in Boston's North end.,1427241600,,78,4.2

3688554,2,B001LPWGCS,"I was very disappointed with the film. The leading man acted like a complete fool.
I found the woman very attractive and way too smart for him (as they were portrayed).
The preview was done in a very sly manner, so that you thought it would be a nice love story, but it wasn't.
I would not recommend it to anyone.",1396051200,,313,4.147540983606557
3688555,4,B001LPWGCS,"Ever since I saw the trailer to this I wanted to see this. It was a fun, light-hearted movie. Enjoyed the different characters.",1392422400,,127,4.565217391304348
3688556,3,B001LPWGCS,"This film tries to be a combination Moonstruck, My Big Fat Greek Wedding and countless romantic ethnic movies hybrid but it misses because of the uneven script.  I liked it but it is not steady throughout and thus falls short.  Some of the jokes fall flat and are not even interestingly presented by the actors.  Also, the music takes away from several of the scenes.  it is passable fare but not great. It comes close to capturing the Italian culture but it waters it down Italian culture like a well-known chain does to Italian food.  It comes close, but no true  amore Italiano here.",1387324800,,586,4.586538461538462
3688557,2,B001LPWGCS,this movie failed to deliver on its promises of heartwarming romance.  dumb premise; dull acting; waste of time. don't bother.,1384560000,,126,5.3
3688558,5,B001LPWGCS,"Great cast of characters, loved the settings in Italy and Boston. The girl who is the co-star is drop dead gorgeous!!",1382400000,,117,4.619047619047619
3688559,4,B001LPWGCS,"Not an Oscar winner but it's romantic and very funny.  It's filmed in Boston and, since that's my childhood home, I enjoyed seeing some familiar sights.",1381017600,,152,4.846153846153846
3688560,5,B001LPWGCS,"This is a very funny movie with likeable, albeit goofy, characters.  I even enjoyed the credits at the end -- very amusing.",1377734400,,123,4.590909090909091
3688571,3,B001LPWGCS,"The film Everybody Wants To Be Italian is far from being a great movie but it is is entertaining.  Jay Jablonski and Cerina Vincent are very engaging and attractive characters as are Marissa Potroro.  Penny Marshall is underutilized.  The premise is that Jake and Marissa both pretend to be Italian but in the end it turns out that neither of them are.  Jake is in a delusional relationship with a woman that he used to date eight years ago and at first it seems like he will do anything possible to get her back but then he meets the doctor who is six years older than he is and he slowly begins to be entralled by her and vice versa.

The men who work with him in the fish market that he owns counsel him to forget the old girlfriend who is now married with three children and concentrate on the doctor until they discover that Marissa is anxious to have children as her biological clock is ticking.

I liked the movie and would recommend it to others but do not expect greatness but merely a good movie and a good time.  It is a little offbeat.  All the characters are well drawn.",1375660800,,1083,4.300492610837439
3688572,1,B001LPWGCS,"What an effort to watch this. Yes, Cerina Vincent is gorgeous, but thats it. As an Italian I have to say that this is a contrived and forced comedy. After 40 minutes, I put on the Weather Channel for a tropical update. This movie is a turkey...",1374105600,,244,4.212765957446808
3688573,3,B001LPWGCS,"The movie attempts to be cute and clever by feeding us unrealistic characters. Jake (Jay Jablonski) owns a fish store in Boston. He is still ""in love"" with his ex-girlfriend (Marisa Petroro) and soul mate of 8-12 years who is now married with 3 kids. This is the first joke that didn't work, unfortunately they made it part of the story. Jake's Italian friends fixes him up with a woman (Cerina Vincent) who they think is Italian. Neither one is Italian but pretends to be Italian because they believe the other one is Italian. That was the whole premise of the title and the second joke that didn't come off well. Jake is so confused about his feelings, he becomes unlikable and pathetic.

I didn't find the movie to be funny, or heart warming and neither did my ex-girlfriend and soul mate.",1337212800,,792,4.577464788732394
3688574,5,B001LPWGCS,"You will absolutely fall in love with Cerina Vincent.  She is the one who gets introduced to Jay Jablonski.  He likes her and she him.  But he's still in love with a former girldriend, Marisa Petrono.  These two ladies play their roles perfectly.  Is Cerina a ""doctor"" (she's a verterarian), but does she have a boyfriend already?  Cerina invites the fish monger to a dinner of intellectuals.  Jay doesn't want to go but the result will surprise and please you, as it did him.  The movie and Cerina Vincent both get 5 stars from me.",1312502400,,532,4.526315789473684
3688575,3,B001LPWGCS,"I found this film amusing and it gave me some belly laughs. Others viewing it did not seem so delighted. One left the room and others just sat.
The premise is ridiculous but some of the developing situations and dialogue I found really funny.
If you have some time and are in a good mood, have Italian heritage or have some really close friends who do, you MIGHT enjoy this film.",1295308800,2,379,4.352112676056338

3688577,1,B001LPWGCS,I live in the North End and this was the worst film of all time. Good god I wanted to like this movie. It was painful. The plot jumps around and makes no sense whatsoever. The only enjoyable part was the main female leads copious amount of cleavage. Mama Mia stay away!,1243900800,2,269,4.1923076923076925
3688578,3,B001LPWGCS,"It was only ok. It was not as funny as My Big Fat Greek Wedding. Most people only get it if they are Italian. An OK ""date"" movie.",1243296000,2,129,3.642857142857143

8319389,2,B001LPWGCS,"Cerina Vincent is beautiful and she carries the movie.  Yet it could not be saved from boredom.  Jablonski is not an actor.  He cannot carry a movie.  His sidekicks, the guys who run the fish store with him, are somewhat amusing, but not really funny.  The whole plot is implausible, really.  I should know.  I'm Italian.",1513987200,,321,4.625
