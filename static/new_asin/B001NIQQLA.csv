I would recommend this video for anyone who is wanting to get consistancy and understand why they have missed shots. It was easy to understand and entertaining.

8327112,5,B001NIQQLA,This video offers instruction in a manner that is easy to understand and apply. The material that Coach Fisher covers applies to any age group and certainly made me think about things that I took for granted related to shooting a basketball. The video is also entertaining and fun to watch. Highly recommend to anyone with kids (or grandkids)!,1239321600,,343,4.830508474576271
8327113,5,B001NIQQLA,"We will have to see during the games to see if my kids 8 to 11 are practicing what they learn, but I can say from the outset the big difference is the teacher. Yes the coach is there for color commentary-but most of the dialogue and examples are done by a child actor. Big grabber for my kids was to hear another kid doing the teaching. Normally most basketball videos have kid demostrators with coach or sport star doing all the talking. This video has the kid doing most of the talking.",1232841600,,488,4.258064516129032
8327114,5,B001NIQQLA,"I got this video for my fifth grade brother for Christmas.  In his words, ""Coach Bob sure can shoot.""  His enjoyment of the video was good enough for me, but besides that I found the video to be fundamentally sound and applicable to all ages.  It offers a individualized approach to shooting that shows quick results.  You can order one of the other videos out there and spend extra time compensating for less than ideal technique or you can order this video and learn to shoot the natural way.  Highly recommended.",1232582400,,515,4.615384615384615

8327116,5,B001NIQQLA,"Excellent video.  Not a boring basketball video like many others on the market.  It keeps your attention and has a lot of great, new information!  One of a kind!  You won't be disappointed in this purchase.",1230595200,,206,4.638888888888889
8327117,5,B001NIQQLA,"I have never been an accurate shooter, but after watching this video and using the techniques presented, I have been tearing up the court!!! It feels great being able to make baskets! I would recommend this video to anyone who wants to feel confident on the court!!!",1230508800,,266,4.680851063829787
8327118,5,B001NIQQLA,"As a high school girls coach, this DVD has become a part of our learning process.  It's easy to understand, based on scientific research, and will improve your shot in a very short period of time.  We've used the DVD with kids from age 10 to 17 and the results have gotten other athletes to ask about it and take it home to watch.  I'd strongly recommend this to anyone of any age who wants to make more shots.  It almost immediately improved the shooting percentage of some of our better shooters on a successful high school Varsity team.",1229472000,,539,4.414141414141414
8327119,5,B001NIQQLA,"This DVD and it's easy to understand approach has remarkably improved my shooting consistency!  This is a video that can be used by shooters of all ages to diagnose and correct simple things to make you a better shooter and help you enjoy the game more.  If this ""old-man"" can learn something, than imagine how much a middle or high school player would get from this, especially with the kid host.",1229299200,,397,4.577464788732394
8327120,5,B001NIQQLA,"This DVD will show an individual of any age how to effectively shoot a basketball. While a truly enjoy the fact that a scientific approach was used in creating this video, I enjoy even more the fact that the Secrets of Shooting approach can be easily learned by players of any skill level. I own a copy myself, and I recommend it to any current of future basketball player or coach.
