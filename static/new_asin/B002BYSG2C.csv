My boys absolutely love them, even my 2 year old (all he cares about is trucks, trains, and cars and won't look up otherwise)will sit an watch it and sing the songs afterwards.

8362501,5,B002BYSG2C,"My kid will not stop watching this. I have watched this DVD about 3500 times. I am at the moment that I can probably tell you every dialogue in the DVD. Definitively worth the money since he is glued to the tv instead of climbing furniture and hurting himself. If you need to distract your little monkey, I totally recommend it. They use a little bit of music and art styles in every episode that I hope some of it is being absorbed by my child.

If you need to cook, or clean, or just need 15-20 mins to yourself, pop the DVD in and watch the children get glued to the TV.",1520467200,,573,4.070796460176991
8362502,3,B002BYSG2C,"We are a Little Einsteins family and have every DVD and all the books etc. We love this show!! This was the last DVD to complete our collection. Well, in the first episode, Firetruck Rocket, the feautred artwork is a Japanese Shadow puppet (or as my son calls it a ""puppet giant"") While it's a beautiful work of art for an adult to comprehend,  it is frightening for a toddler!!! It's a strange looking image and feautred in a scary way. This is actually the very first time our 3 year old has been spooked by something so much. It's so unfortunate since they incorporate a cool firetruck that really catches the kids attention. Just disappointed with this one.",1517788800,,661,4.554621848739496
