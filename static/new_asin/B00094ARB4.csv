2261980,3,B00094ARB4,"Somehow I just knew Rhino's DVD release of season one ""My Favorite Martian"" was a complete fluke. The amazing quality found in the season one set is definitely lacking in season two and I'm a little disappointed. Season two is also presented in beautiful black & white and contains all 38 episodes with a noticeable difference in quality. Fans of the show will be disappointed that 5 of the 38 episodes are presented in their shorter ""syndicated"" television versions. This is clearly stated on the back of the DVD package as Rhino Home Video claims that an extensive search came up empty for the original masters for these episodes. As a fan of the show I was upset to learn that this was the case.

Once again the packaging is pretty cheap compared to other Studios and a booklet listing the episodes in the set hasn't been included. Bonus features would also have been nice this time around like commentaries or bloopers, anything! For fans of these old TV shows we are at the mercy of the Studios to release them, but at what cost to us? While I'm not happy about it I can overlook the shorter versions if it means completing season two. I only hope that the long delay for season three is that Rhino is trying to get it right this time around. Please Rhino give us the final season produced in color to finally complete the series.

2261981,2,B00094ARB4,The third season was produced in Color. How do I know? I own the VHS box set released in the early 90's that contains all 32 third season shows IN COLOR. The first two seasons were produced in black and white.,1158451200,11,209,4.121951219512195
2261982,3,B00094ARB4,"Some of the criticisms made by other reviewers on this page are beyond my knowledge to evaluate. I found the DVD set to have good quality production values. ""My Favorite Martian"" is a great old time series with lots of gentle humour, not the in-your-face style that is so popular today, a pleasant change.",1154217600,7,305,4.666666666666667
2261983,1,B00094ARB4,"On a few of the episodes the video images are unstable. At first, I thought the DVD player or the DVD was responsible. However, after viewing someone elses copy on a different player, it is clear that the producers of the DVD are at fault. This should never have gone to market with this problem.",1142121600,11,296,4.4
2261984,5,B00094ARB4,I loved watching the series when I was growing up and was very glad when I found it on DVD.  I pull it out every so often to watch it.  Bill Bixby was great in the show along with Ray Walston.,1140134400,6,192,3.658536585365854
2261985,3,B00094ARB4,"My Favorite Martian is a great show, but this is one cheap DVD release! The episodes are edited and the package is cheap!

By the way, Amazon, it's not My Favorite Martian:Complete Second, it's My Favorite Martian - The Complete Second Season! TITLE IT PROPERLY!!!

Amazon also incorrectly said it was in Color, it is not, it is in Black & White! GET IT TOGETHER AMAZON!",1125014400,16,370,4.590909090909091
2261986,4,B00094ARB4,"This is one of the better fantasy sitcoms of the 60's.  Ray Walston endeared himself to us by playing The Martian with so many quirks, along with his warm insights into human behavior, his constant name-dropping of historical figures, and his occasional human-like outbursts at the foibles his ""experiments,"" or nephew Tim's (Bill Bixby) or landlady Mrs. Brown's (Pamela Britton) interferences cause.

This show was a contemporary of all the other ""fish-out-of-water"" fantasies of the 60's, including ""Bewitched,"" ""I Dream of Jeannie,"" and even the ""Munsters"" And ""Addams Family"" sitcoms.  The basic question the first season asks is ""what would happen if a 450-year-old Martian anthropologist crash lands on earth and is taken in by an Earthling (who's also a newspaper reporter) who tries to help him get his spaceship repaired and return home?""  The second season seems more interested in ""how many ways can a Martian find to demonstrate his extraordinary powers while getting himself knocked off kilter by earth's natural and human environment?""  Most of the story lines in both seasons are clever, and these episodes offer a showcase of many of the most ubiquitous character actors of 60's primetime TV.

The complaints about Rhino in other comments are valid, but they don't diminish the fact that these are delightful sitcoms for those who enjoy a different standard for family TV than today's fare.  Each season is on five sides of three DVD's.  Incidentally, ALL the episodes in both seasons are in Black & White on these DVD's, (not Color as indicated by Amazon).",1119744000,25,1573,5.1171875
2261987,1,B00094ARB4,"Why does RHINO not go back to the masters on a classic series like this?  The simple answer is...they don't care about the fans or the series...they just want your $.  When the first set was being put together, my friend offered RHINO a print of the MY FAVORITE MARTIAN  Un-aired PILOT (Which was not included on the first set).  RHINO said they would get back to him...they never did.  This set has episodes which are the CUT Syndicated versions of the episodes???  Why?  COLUMBIA HOUSE had some of the same episodes transferred from the masters un-cut.  When RHINO issued the GUMBY series on DVD...they didn't want to pay to use the original CAPITAL music, so they used this incredibly bad synthesizer music, which was put into the series in the 1980's.  Fans of classic TV are wise to RHINO, especially when shows like the ANDY GRIFFITH show are coming out on DVD from the NEGATIVES with sponsor spots and shows like NAKED CITY (IMAGE) are coming out with the bumpers and commercials transferred from the negative.  If RHINO doesn't care about a series...they shouldn't put it out unless they put it out right.",1117929600,85,1113,4.690721649484536
2261988,1,B00094ARB4,"Enough is Enough! Combat! from Image Time Compressed, NO THANKS! My Favorite Martian the FIRST season, Perfect! But now, M.F.M. The complete (!!??) second season....with 4 episodes of the 38 EDITED! Why?, because Rhino says ""After an extensive search, we were un-able to locate the ""elements"" for these four episodes un-cut"". Oh really? Then why was one of the four edited episodes available thru Columbia House Home Video Un-cut?. We are not talking about LONDON AFTER MIDNIGHT here Rhino. You call the shows distributor, they tell you where the ""elements"" are stored and wa la! Did you attempt to ask people/fan/collectors on the internet to supply the ""lost"" footage. There are hundreds of M.F.M. collectors that I'm sure have these episodes on 16mm. It boils down to simple laziness. Send a LOUD messege to Rhino. Release these beloved shows un-cut to the dvd collecting public or not at all. DO NOT BUY THIS DVD SET. I for one will watch the first season and hope that Rhino releases the 3rd season UN-CUT.",1116460800,67,1011,4.883720930232558
2261989,5,B00094ARB4,"I know this is a comedy and a fantasy but in comparison to what you see on the movies and TV today this is a very complex science program.  It is also very funny and will keep you laughing and some times thinking.  My only disappointment was that I found out that this was not one of the rare TV Shows that went to color before everyone else.  Amazon advertises this second season 1964 - 1965 being shown in color but the DVD's I got are in B&W.  Yet, it is still worth the money to get this excellent program on DVD.",1115683200,10,517,4.03921568627451

2261996,2,B00094ARB4,"After watching Umbrella Entertainments reproduction of My Favorite Martian, The First Season (6) DVD set, I was very disappointed with the overall picture quality and audio sound track of the second season (6) DVD Set. The black and white contrast in many of the scenes is sub-par rendering the characters and sets dark and grainy, there are actually some scenes where the video momentarily becomes totally diffused, or unfocused.

While Umbrella Entertainment mentions this fact as an introductory note on the second series disc, they also mention ""by-the-way"" that several scenes are missing from the last episode! They never mention any of these problems when advertising the second series DVD set.

Umbrella Entertainment should have been upfront in their pre- purchase product advertisement concerning the reproduction quality and deficiencies regarding the complete second series (6) DVD set, especially for the price they are charging for a technically flawed product.",1326758400,6,975,5.5369127516778525
