7887875,3,6305339007,Not quite as good as some of the other amateurish anime hentai offering.,1420329600,,72,4.615384615384615
7887876,5,6305339007,"This was a great tape. Only 2 things I would advise is that if you have or plan on getting Vhs version is you fast forward the first 5 mins of the tape because of all the ads in the tape. Then don't watch Malice in wounderland in the dark,this is was the most disterbing piece of animation I ever watch when you watch this it feels that someone/something is going to get you. But other than that it all funny worth the bucks!!!",1227744000,,427,4.095238095238095
7887877,1,6305339007,"The other reviewers did not make it clear to readers that this DVD is an animated violence video and not a sexual escapade video. If you are looking for a fun animated adult sex theme video... This is NOT it! If you are looking for fun sex animation like the magazine ""sex to Sexty"" you will hate this video. This particular website does not have any adult animation you would enjoy.

This DVD should be a starter video for aspiring serial killers. The cartoon artwork looks like the Yellow Submarine characters and Mad Magazine artwork bizarrely morphing from one psychodelic state to another performing gruesome violence and maiming with utterly nonsensical & tasteless acts & behavior such as cutting off body parts and eating babies. The dozens of 10 second clips throughout the video entitled ""Sex and violence"" are nothing but violence except for a brief 1 second innuendo of a mermaid BJ on a diver. Innuendo because it really shows you nothing.

The rare appearance of sex involves grossly unstimulating themes such as a corpse in a coffin, a morphing scene and poorly done claymation characters of which most of the actions are under the covers or not directly shown. Unless you are into necrophilia or gumby, you won't like this either. The only reasonably close short 1 minute skit is a pasty dancer whose boobs turn into machine guns... which you would get more by watching Austin Powers Fembots instead.

Most of the artwork is primative, immature, poor quality and looks like a pre-teen on drugs assembled it in their garage.

Most of the video is quite unwatchable such as a guy yelling ""meat"" over and over again at the top of his lungs in a trailer park and then dropping dead.

I really don't recommend this video. I have over 1000 popular movies of all genre in my collections from sci-fi to classics to comedy to horror ... but this is only the second unwatchable video I have ever purchased. If you like animated graphic violence you might better enjoy any cartoon currently being shown on cable TV which at least have better artwork, continuity, plots and production than the ones on this video.

For those who are looking for better fun adult cartoons (and are not partial to Japanese anime), the only ones I have seen so far are produced by Hollywood Video (and those are extremely lacking in quality as well). There is a definite absence of options for some fun Adult animation as one might have seen in the ""Sex to Sexty"" adult cartoon magazines of yesteryear.",1145318400,23,2486,4.7297921478060045
7887878,5,6305339007,"never before have I laugh so hard or been shocked more than I was watching this inspired collection of animated shorts (some blend live action elements to delightfully sick effect).

some of the segments are brilliantly conceived from a visual angle and some are so warped you feel guilty laughing at it.

this is proof that their is an underground scene in America producing stuff that blows away every animated release by a major release studio. It should go mainstream like air on [adult swim]!",1142726400,3,497,4.8352941176470585
7887879,5,6305339007,"While there are a few duds the animation in this DVD is amazing, ESPECIALLY Attack of the Hungry Hungry Nipples. Definitely buy this dvd if you like funny trippy cartoons.",1121731200,6,171,4.733333333333333
7887880,1,6305339007,"You heard me.  This is a mixed bag of animated shorts, but, with few exceptions (some of Bill Plymptons, one other), they are boring and not very imaginative (pretty much like watching a 10 year-old boy tell dirty jokes).

Don't waste your money.",1121126400,4,246,4.6976744186046515
7887881,5,6305339007,"This collection of short, sick, twisted and utterly moraly wrong cartoons makes up thi gem that is General Chaos. This has alot of derranged materal that is not for the easly offended or faint of heart, However if your into the sick stuff this is deffentaly the DVD/VHS for you. My Fav is a short called ""Sunny Havens"" (AKA MEAT!!!!!) it gets funnier each time you see it and just can't help but to scream ""MEEEEEEAAAT!!!!!!"" yourself. This Dvd contains 12 new shorts by legenad Bill Plympton.",1096588800,3,493,4.67816091954023
7887882,4,6305339007,"This is some great stuff if you're a little sick and twisted yourself! This is not for the easily offended and you probably won't like if if you're over the age of 30. They're all animated random bits of material like a parrot who feels guilty about just what dirty stuff he has to do to get a cracker, one about ""Hungry Hungry Nipples"" with an attitude who battle a Richard Nixon baseball bat and my favorite, ""Deep Sympathy"" about an old gravedigger who poses as a priest doing a funeral who ends up ""boinking"" the corpse! Cool! Great DVD for a party!",1041638400,6,553,4.378640776699029
7887883,4,6305339007,"This video is great; especially with Grimshaw and Plymptoons. I didn't care for much about some of the other shorts,but it is funny! I would like to find more of these videos.",1008028800,,175,4.5
