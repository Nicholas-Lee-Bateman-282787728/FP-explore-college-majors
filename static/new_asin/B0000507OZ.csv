Unaware of where he is or how he got there the young fighter played by Gordon Liu relies on The trickster Wang Yue to help him around, and also keep him out of harms way.  Instead the two men seem to find more trouble then they can get away from, and Liu's Past creeps its way back onto the scene.  Can he find out who he is before something really bad happens?  Or was his biggest mistake in who he chose to be his company?  A great film with real good comedy, and astonishing fights.  Gordon Liu and Wang Yue are brilliant, and this film is not to be missed by any martial arts film fan.",991526400,,713,4.093525179856115

7928692,5,B0000507OZ,"One of the best Kung Fu movies out there. Unlike many old kung fu movies, this one doesn't get heavy hearted with betrayals and death of close friends/loved ones. Some characters do die though. Overall, it's a great time. It's very very fun to watch with friends. Great action, great story, great concept, great comedy, and great chemistry between the two heroes (ones the goof ball and the other is serious but vulnerable guy)",1417132800,,427,4.783783783783784
7928693,4,B0000507OZ,"Loved it! Gordon Liu -what can I say - he has the moves! A few funny scenes.  The plot was there all the way until the end! I can't say that about all Kung Fu flicks - some have none!  This is a classic that's earned to be in my top 5% and one I can watch a few times over.  Not only were the fighting scenes pretty good - it was well chorographed.  Hey, I can see the talent in this movie!",1124928000,2,390,3.6626506024096384
7928694,4,B0000507OZ,This is my second Gordon Liu Movie to see and I was a little disapoited in him when I saw Shaolin Drunken Monk but in this move he is great.  My only complaint about this movie is nobody is as dumb as the charcters in this move.  There are many things that are so obvious that they don't figure out.  If you can get past that the rest of the story and the Kung fu are great.,1085184000,,374,3.831168831168831
7928695,3,B0000507OZ,"1) Shoalin Drunken Monk: This film contains a very good audio commentary by Ric Meyers, which i found informative and entertaining... i wish more of these kung fu movies had commertary by film makers and experts. Sadly this DVD was not in widescreen so you don't really get the whole movie
2) He Has Nothing But Kung Fu: I felt that this was the better of the two...........So much Kung Fu..........Fighting for no absolute reason. but again not in widescreen. However bye its cheap. good to have for your collection",1084752000,6,516,4.7444444444444445
7928696,5,B0000507OZ,"This movie is about a wandering noble who has amnesia who is taken in by a homeless con man.
This movie is fantastic. Gordon Liu's mastery of Hung Gar is on fine display, and every fight scene is exciting. The plot is unique to Hong Kong films in that it has NO REVENGE!!! I highly recomend this to any kung fu flick fan.",1020124800,,321,4.111111111111111
7928697,3,B0000507OZ,"HE HAS NOTHING BUT KUNG FU (1977) is an early combination of kung fu and comedy predating similar efforts by Sammo Hung and Jackie Chan. The kung fu is frequent and exciting and expertly staged by director Lau Kar Wing. The clever storyline balances the kung fu and humor with a dexterity not often achieved in the genre.
Gordon Liu plays a wandering amnesiac who displays advanced kung fu skills when attacked. Wong Yue plays a con man who latches on to Gordon to use him in his schemes to get back at a local crime boss. Much to Wong's dismay, any money they acquire is immediately distributed by the fair-minded Gordon to the poor victims of the local racketeers. All this activity builds up to a sprawling final battle between the two heroes and the criminals amidst the ruins of an abandoned building.
In the middle of it all, Gordon's father, a famous admiral, shows up with great fanfare and demands that the local officials find his son. Little does he know that the corrupt officials are in league with the criminals and are actively trying to rub out the two heroes to stop them from giving away any more of the gang's money.
While it lacks the spectacle of Shaw Bros. kung fu films and leaves the emphasis on martial arts technique to Sammo Hung's films, it does offer a concise package of witty writing, strong acting, lively supporting cast, and expert direction. The title may be awkward, although it aptly sums up the main character's situation, but nothing else about this unsung kung fu gem is. The two stars, Gordon Liu and Wong Yue, later re-teamed for DIRTY HO (1979).",1006646400,4,1588,4.614840989399293
