1817095,1,B00007K02C,"Apparently the script, sound equipment and several cameras were lost on the way to the set of this dull film.
I imagine the director telling his actors: ""More mumbling--more mumbling! I nearly understood some of the dialogue in the last take!"" Then he turned to his cameraman and told him to slop another jar of vaseline on the lens.
I could put up with some of the pretentious art-school escapades of this movie if the story was worth following, but there IS no story. A bunch of LA people with direct and tangenital ties to the entertainment business wander along for two hours--that's the story. Woopee.
The one and only redeeming thing in this meandering piece of junk is the veterinarian who comes to check out David Hyde Pierce's sick dog and sticks around to eat hash brownies. I don't know who the actress is, but she is a breath of fresh air in the midst of this smelly waste of time.",1047168000,4,893,4.518518518518518
1817096,1,B00007K02C,"Interesting ideas regarding the movie's structure, some good acting, but ultimately - very VERY boring. The fact that the actors had to apply their make up themselves just doesnt make it worth seeing (unless you need some sleep). The actors seem to enjoy this, I guess because they had complete freedom . If you want to see a movie that was actually 'written' and 'directed' go somewhere else.

1817097,5,B00007K02C,This film proves that a good story (not a large budget) makes a good film.  I heard it was made for $2 million and grossed a total of $2 million in theatrical release.  I found the story refreshing in the way it wanders.  The nuances will be even more poignant if you live in Los Angeles but they have broad appeal.  I especially liked the psycho HR director played by Katherine Keener.  Enjoy !,1041465600,3,395,4.283783783783784
1817129,2,B00007K02C,"I am not one to criticize a movie because it doesn't fit the mold, in fact I find the quieter, more character driven movies more interesting than others (see Lost in Translation). However, as an experimental piece and ensemble movie, I just never got into it. I didn't care about any of the characters and while I applaud Soderbergh for trying something new and different, it didn't translate very well even if the cast was probably have a good time going outside their zone of comfort.

The Blu-ray at least has a fair amount of features including the original cut (the main one is an extended version for some reason) with the Soderbergh/Hough commentary (the only way to view the movie is with the commentary, however) along with cast interviews (the actors in character), 17-minutes worth of deleted footage and a standard interview with Soderbergh.

The scenarios between Julia Roberts and Blair Underwood is great, he makes great points about Hollywood films and issues concerning race and sexuality.

The film is filled with odd funny and sometimes even disturbing characters bouncing off of each other in Seinfeld like moments that provoke introspection of the part of the viewer. So stay away from this film if you cant keep up with witty dialog and have objections to being provoked into thinking for yourself.",1365292800,,730,4.607692307692307
1817131,3,B00007K02C,"The Blu-Ray includes a 111 min cut of the film that's a bit different from the 101 min theatrical cut.

I think it's just a mistake, as it feels like an unfinished version. The difference in running time is more down to additional shots and portions of scenes than whole new scenes. (I ran the DVD and Blu-Ray at the same time to compare).

As this is a bargain Blu-Ray coming out with no fuss, I don't think it's an officially recut version by Soderbergh.

The 101 min version actually is on the BD as well, but only in standard definition and only with the audio commentary as audio, you cannot listen to the film audio while watching that cut of the film.

1817132,2,B00007K02C,I could only watch about 30 minutes of this movie before I had to abandon it. The characters were not believable to me and the acting was somewhat stilted.  The interaction between Julia Roberts and Blair Underwood was just painful to watch.,1336867200,,241,4.738095238095238

I enjoyed ""Bubble"" Many didn't; ""Out of Sight"" was intriguing, and his Hollywood endeavors (""Traffic"", ""Erin Brockovich"") were made with precision and care. ""Full Frontal"" was amusing at times, slow, character driven, and required a bit of suspension of the norm. Not that bad. Duchovny, Roberts, Keener and Underwood...and the others were having a ball with the material. If you hate this film, it only means you are taking life way too seriously.

1817134,2,B00007K02C,"The reason I purchased this movie and the only reason it's tolerable is because David Duchovny is in it.  I am a loyal fan of Mr. Duchovny.  I own all his movies as well as the complete X-Files series.  Throughout the entire movie, I kept waiting for something to happen.  I figured out, at the very beginning, that it was a story-within-a-story, story-within-a-story, story-within-a-story which was very confusing.  The grainy quality of the ""real"" story made it seem amateurish.  I was disappointed that David Duchovny only had about four scenes.  He made the most of his few scenes, however,even though they were at the very end.  What I didn't expect was his character's death from auto-erotic asphixiation.  If the point of the movie is that Hollywood celebrity-types lead boring, pointless, empty lives, it lived up to its expectations.  The ""f"" word was used too many times.  Whoever wrote the dialogue has a very limited vocabulary.",1260403200,,940,5.0
1817135,3,B00007K02C,"Steven Soderbergh is one of the most creative directors working today. Although I don't like everything he has done, some of his work is truly brilliant (""Schizopolis"" is a personal favorite), while some is mainstream and less intriguing. All of it is interesting to try to understand, and in that regard ""Full Frontal"" is no exception. Soderbergh views ""Full Frontal"" as a more contemporary ""Sex, Lies, and Videotape"" and is one of his more personal ventures into the world of low budget filmmaking (the budget was two million dollars). When Soderbergh does something with a small budget, the creativity is normally inversely high, and the originality factor is definitely present here.

The film features a non-linear plot, where differing stories involving interconnected pairs of people explore modern Hollywood life. The creative ""movie within a movie"" concept is used to good effect, but must be carefully watched to ensure that you understand whether you are seeing the actors or the characters they are portraying. To assist with this understanding, Soderbergh has provided the viewer with several subtle clues that truly reveal the hand of a master craftsman. The film within a film (""Rendezvous"") is shot on film, has brilliant color, has music and sound effects, while the rest of the movie is shot in a more documentary style on a digital camera, done with natural light (and was made to look even grainier in postproduction, as revealed in the commentary), has no sound effects, and no background music.

The interactions between the characters were very interesting to watch and were sometimes nonsensical (as random dialogue between two people tend to be when background information is not present). I was especially fond of the characters played by David Hyde Pierce and Blair Underwood, and found their characterizations most natural. I think Julia Roberts was adequate in her role, but perhaps not as suited to the more improvisational nature of this type of film. I found Catherine Keener's character pointedly annoying, and while that served the ultimate goal of the film, I found it to be difficult to endure. (I did enjoy the multiple games of catch with a beach ball globe while she grilled various people to name all the countries in Africa, though.) Nicky Katt was amazing as a truly wretched art house Hitler in a production of ""The Sound and the Fuhrer"", which I suppose counts as a play within a movie revealing extra complexity. (If you ever wanted to imagine Hitler on a date or in therapy accompanied by avant-garde dancing Nazis, this is a must see.) I was also delighted with the dog owned by David Hyde Pierce that had eaten six hash-laced brownies; rarely has an animal been so perfect in a role.

The writing by Coleman Hough (with help from Soderbergh and the actors) is frequently full of unexpected gems like ""I have confused my personality quirks with standards"", but they are so subtly played that they tend to slip by unless the viewer is watching intently. That characterizes the entire film: it contains a lot of good material, but requires extreme attention to detail to understand it all.

The DVD features many extras, most of which are excellent (although the ""Director's Spy Cam"" feature is a complete bust). The commentary with Soderbergh and Hough is especially enlightening, as is the interview with Soderbergh. The ""In-Character Interviews"" were interesting, and served as an excellent outlet for improvisation; some are more successful than others. While the interview with David Hyde Pierce was excellent, the interview with Julia Roberts was tepid at best, and the interview with Blair Underwood was excruciating. For people genuinely interested in filmmaking, Soderbergh's comments are always enlightening, and I found them the most enjoyable part of the DVD, and therein a problem resides. If the commentary is the most interesting part of the DVD, then perhaps the material is not among his most brilliant, and in this case I think that's partially fair. The issue is that much of the material is strong, but some isn't and tends toward boring; I especially found that to be true with the characters of Keener and David Duchovny, who came across as not only self-absorbed, but totally unlikable as well. Their roles were ill-defined and I kept waiting for them to reveal their integral importance to the plot and to explain why I should find them to be worthy of attention; with a bit of an exception from Keener at the end, I never found them to be sympathetic characters, nor did I find them to be as compelling as the remainder of the cast.

On balance, I find this movie more worthy of study from the point of view of how it was made and why various choices were made in its production rather than as an organic piece of entertainment. People familiar with Soderbergh's big budget pictures will likely not find this to their liking (although in addition to Roberts, there is a cameo with Brad Pitt; Pitt fans should watch the film to the very end) while fans of indie and Soderbergh's lower budget films (especially ""Schizopolis"") will be much more open to the quirky charms of ""Full Frontal"".",1247356800,3,5156,4.94919168591224
1817136,1,B00007K02C,"It saddens me to say so but ""Full Frontal"" is painfully boring, pointless, disjointed, and underdeveloped. I am a big fan of indie experimental original movies but this one gives the term bad meaning. As hard as they tried, the talented performers ((David Hyde Pierce, Catherine Keener, Mary McCormack, Julia Roberts, Blair Underwood) could not make their lifeless characters interesting enough for me to care. I love Catherine Keener in every movie I've seen her but she's played the same role in better films. She is much more interesting in Neil LaBute's ""Your Friends & Neighbors"" (1998) which reminds in some ways Full Frontal. Both, Neil LaBute's and Soderbergh's films picture selfish and often unpleasant and despicable people who are not happy with themselves and can't make happy those close to them. Another Keener's film that came to my mind, is Living in Oblivion (1995), a 91 minutes long low-budget independent movie about trials and tribulations of making a low budget independent movie. Tom DiCillo's smart, funny, playful, and highly enjoyable Living in Oblivion has surreal, strangely poetic and amusing quality to it. Unlike, Soderbergh's empty exercise in self-indulgence, wonderful cast of Living in Oblivion has something interesting to play and the characters created by Steve Buscemi, Catherine Keener, Chad Palomino, Dermot Mulroney and Peter Dinklage (in a very funny cameo) are alive and three-dimensional. I am a fan of Soderbergh's work since I saw his fascinating debut, the Palme d'Or winner ""Sex, Lies, and Videotape"". I read that ""Full Frontal"" is in a way a sequel to Soderbergh's first feature. If that's true, it only proves that sequels almost never measure up to originals.",1207612800,3,1712,5.2290909090909095
1817137,1,B00007K02C,"This was a very bad movie. It was very disjointed, confusing, no story and in my opinion worthless. The movie was presented in a documentary style about making a movie. The acting was very poor and the script was awful. That is something that I don't say very often because I am the one that likes B movies. The only reason that I would have given this movie 2 stars would have been that David Duchovny was totally nude. Well, the scene was about 2 seconds long, blurry and shot at an angle that you knew that he had something between his legs, but you really couldn't see it well enough to say it was worth the movie price.

Frankly, this is more than you can say for most of what comes out of Hollywood these days, which (for me, anyway) is recommendation enough. I've now seen it twice, and that second viewing is where movies either stick with me or quickly become forgotten. I'll watch this one again, to be sure.",1149033600,,508,4.3578947368421055

As others have noted, this is a pretty disjointed random set of vignettes, many of them full of film school pompousness and indie cliches, but there are some gems here and there.

The really HIGH SCHOOL dead spots though, like the interminable scenes on the set of a contemporary artsy fartsy avant Hitler play, simply beg to be skipped through.

I recommend watching this film as a collection of notoriously uneven shorts.  Just skip through the garbage and enjoy what gems you can find.

1817168,3,B00007K02C,"When a script utilizes the f-word ten times in a scene at a traffic light, I find myself wanting to beam in a thesaurus.  I do not care for excessive profanity, partially due to personal convictions, but also due to what repetitive profanity represents artistically--a lazy vocabulary.  Passion and anger and shock and dejection and even annoyance cannot effectively receive proper expression by the same handful of vulgarities.  In this story in particular, characterization is blurred by poorly articulated emotions.

Tenderness which peaks out during the final scenes might have resonated more richly had the script employed more creative lines and less repetion of a generic shock-word which typically dulled the audience's comprehension of a character's motives and intentions.

Nearly all actors involved served their parts well.  Julia Roberts' role seemed underdeveloped (not her fault), and Nicky the Nazi felt cartoonish and tacked onto the otherwise love and lust driven plot.

Filming technique enhanced more than it detracted.  Music was generally apropos.  The varying storylines intersected well, and the concise production length enabled the viewer's sufficient emotional investment in each tale.",1108080000,,1212,5.651933701657459

1817171,3,B00007K02C,"Ever since I saw `Traffic', I have been catching up on what I have been missing of the brilliance of Stephen Soderbergh.  Full Frontal, though extremely stripped down and roughed out, is still interesting and entertaining enough inspire repeat viewings; and each viewing became more entertaining than the last.  If you enjoy a mixed bag of interpersonal relationships with a bit of satire and improvisation that doesn't take itself too seriously, this is the film for you.",1097366400,2,472,5.116883116883117
1817172,2,B00007K02C,"I expected more from this highly touted film by Steven Soderbergh but sadly I felt lost and unaffected throughout the entire experience.

I know this film is supposed to be artsy and creative, something profound that only a few really dedicated souls can figure out. I understand the movie within a movie concept and I get the need for all the grainy, jittery camera shots but I think this film went too far into the ozone layer for the average person to comprehend its full meaning.

David Hyde Pierce, Julia Roberts, Blair Underwood, and a few other notables did good acting jobs but their characters were never really explained and then when they were things changed anyway so the theories once held were quickly swept away. David Duchovny is the ""frontal"" that caused all the uproar when this film originally opened, but if you blink you will miss what you came to see and it's dead anyway!

I hoped for more from Soderbergh but the interesting writing found on a few of the stories never seemed to tie all together in the end. I walked away completely confused and unsatisfied; it just wasn't a picture for me.",1092268800,12,1115,4.649746192893401

Catherine Keener and David Hyde Pierce however do flex decent acting chops here. Ducovney should have never accepted an asphyxiation role...those roles are difficult to recover from. I wonder what my favorite bitchy movie reviewer (and hero) Rex Reed would have to say about this?...""David D. Chokes in an anti-climatic Soderbergh film. Is Put on Hold""...

 I don't like Blair Underwood. I don't know why. He's just not my type. Julia is wasted here. One should see happier Julia Roberts movies, not this bit of depressed and depressive effluvia. My overall advice: see side by side with 'The Player' and decide which is the better movie. I bet you'll go with 'The Player'..",1091750400,,877,4.801324503311259
1817174,2,B00007K02C,"Though ""Full Frontal"" boasts of its great casts including Julia Roberts, the film is rather an experimental indie film, mostly shot in 18 days with a digital camera (which cost only $ 4,600).  That is not a problem if the film is interesting -- I mean, interesting characters, interesting techiniques, interesting stories, or anything.  No such luck, sorry.  Though some actors are giving their best efforts, the film looks more like a self-indulgent film-school student's work.
The film follows the events that happen to the characters (whose profiles are revealed in the introductory part).  Journalist Julia Roberts is interviewing TV star Blair Underwood; Cathrine Keener is doing the most uncomfortable job of the human resorce office (that is, firing the employees); her sister Mary McCormack is talking about the guy she met on the net; David Hyde Pierce (who shows uncanny resemblance with director Soderbergh himself) is rehearsing the stage drama for the always quizzical Nikky Katt.  When the day comes close to the end, these assorted people find themselves strangely entangled in the web of human relations, which is represented by the dinner party for ""Gus,"" powerful Hollywood producer played by one star from ""X-Files.""
The film also includes 'film within film"" device (and even ""film within film within film"" devide, too), which might confuse some of the viewers.  Fortunately, the device is not overused, and soon you will understand what is doing on.
The trouble is, except for some moments including talented Keener, none of the characters can really grab your attention.  They are facing the critical moments of life, the film implies, but strangely we do not care.  And as the experimental film, ""Full Frontal"" is not as innovative as ""Schizopolis"" (in which Soderbergh himself starred).
Possibly, here is the reason for its half-baked result: first, incredible you might say, but Soderbergh's use of digital camera is so poor like someone's home movies.  At one scene, you see Sandra Oh very briefly.  Well, but I couldn't see whether it was her or not because of a blurred image (I knew her voice, and saw her name in the credits), and I was thinking -- what is the point of doing that?  The poorly shot images just detract our attention to the characters which should not be sacrificed for the dirctor's unnecessary ""experiments.""
Some parts of the film might interest you (if you're a film buff).  You see many cameos -- Brad Pitt, Terence Stamp, and David Fincher (as the perfectionist director who needs 49 takes for one breif shot).  But they are not enough for us to keep being interesting in the story which should really count.  The conculsion is this; you just cannot use this great cast just because you want to be experimantal.  Life is too short to do that, especially with this cast.",1076198400,6,2820,4.982942430703624
1817175,1,B00007K02C,"The only reason this movie gets one star is because there's not an option to choose zero.  This is, unbelievably to me, given Mr. Soderbergh's other credits, one of the WORST movies I've ever seen.  The ""documentary"" style filming is grainy and extremely distracting, and even more so because it's such an over-used technique.  I'm an avid independent film viewer and like the unusual and the avant-garde, but this film is a poseur which fails in every way.
If you come to the story without knowing it's supposed to be imbued with skewering cleverness and satire, it's confusing, unengaging and boring, and, come to think of it, now that I know it's supposed to have those elements, it's STILL confusing, boring and unengaging.  The character development is so poor that you don't care about anybody nor understand what's motivating them.  David Hyde Pierce is a horrible choice for the main character--he has no depth or emotional range which, unfortunately, keeps us half wondering if Kelsey Grammer's going to come through the door at any minute.  Catherine Keener has the kind of charisma that transcends shoddy screenwriting, but how her character behaves makes the least sense of all.
I think the only reason to rent this movie would be if you want to get a few second ""full frontal"" view of David Duchovny, albeit a grainy one shot from a distance so you really can't see anything, or if you're the VP of HR and you need to show your managers how NOT to conduct an HR interview.",1072483200,3,1485,4.7587548638132295
1817176,4,B00007K02C,"Full Frontal is a difficult movie to watch and to fully understand on its first viewing. With patience and careful listening this movie opens outward like an onion as layer upon layer begins to emerge. This is the movie quotes Soderbergh that Woody Allen would have made if he moved west and dropped a lot of acid. That may or may not be the case.
What Full Frontal is is a carefully crafted exploration of Hollywood relationships. In its format it reminded me a little of Robert Altman's Short Cuts in that we have multiple storylines with the same characters. Also we have a movie within a movie within yet another movie. If this all sounds confusing it is. But go along with the premise and it becomes enjoyable.
This is a fine ensemble piece with some of Hollywood's biggest stars: Julia Roberts, Blair Underwood, David Hyde Pierce,Catherine Keener, and Mary McCormack. The film , or rather multiple films chronicle the relationships between the characters leading up to the 40th birthday of movie producer, Gus Delario (David Duchovny).
The film shot both in 35mm and grainy DV presents challenges to its viewers and may be one of the more intelligent films of last year and is well worth a viewing or two.
The DVD presents the film and a large group of extras tht really add to the presentation. There are the usual director and screenwriter commentaries, on camera in character interviews with the cast, deleted scenes, spy cam shots and an interview ith Soderbergh.

He walked away from the big bank job and everything else and started living as a 21-year-old all over again.  Steven Soderbergh reminds me of that guy.  Having made ""Traffic"" and ""Erin Brockovich,"" it's like he decided to go back to college and make an edgy--and what student does not want edgy?--film on a film student's budget.  I don't know what happened to the banker, but I know what happened to Soderbergh: he made ""Full Frontal,"" and it succeeds more than half but not entirely.
The effort has a lot of fine parts but the whole does not do them justice.  This is a ""day in the life of"" dash between interrelated lives and the daisy chain of events that connects them; mostly they are held together by the shared experience of living in LA and working either in one of the media or in the fringes.  David Hyde Pierce is extraordinary as a writer faced with an array of serious losses in this single day, unaware of one more that hangs in the balance.  He is the moral touchstone in a town and film where soul is an endangered species.  David Duchovny is the dark angel, a producer turning 40 in a town where that is a risky move.  Julia Roberts and Blair Underwood come off as rather plastic, kind of slumming it with the indie crowd, but appropriately their story line is that of characters who are revealed to be in a film within a film about an actor in a television show, etc., etc.  Catherine Keener careens throughout like a pinball spiked by the worst essences of LA., and as grating as she is at first, much comes to depend on how she will make it through the day.  Nicky Katt's storyline is barely tacked on, but he makes the most of it as a small-time stage actor who has wisely not quit his day job.
The biggest problem in this project is the smugness in which Soderbergh revels as he deploys indie conventions that are no longer that special: grainy, choppy film; jumpy hand-held cameras; zoom shots that are engaged like someone hitting the accelerator instead of the brakes; location shots in all low-ceiling spaces; and the assumption that regular people use words that can't be said on television as routine discourse.

1817200,1,B00007K02C,"Okay, if you like this movie, don't read this review and remember it is my opinion.
Some really high powered actors are found in this movie. It is a movie within a movie.  You see an interview taking place that is really part of the movie and then you see the character's real lives.
The line from movie to ""reality"" gets blurred.  However the use of video quality scenes versus the kind generally used in Hollywood movies helps provide the definition of which is which.
There are several characters.  Focal to this movie in primarily name only is Gus.  All the players are planning (except for one) to go to a birthday party in his honor in the near future.
A young black actor, who in the movie plays second fiddle to a well known actor.
An actress who plays a reporter.
A VP of Human resources that is nearly a basket case.
The sister of the VP of Human resources, who is also massage therapist, who has a unique connection to the birthday boy.  She also plans on meeting a blind date from the internet soon.
A director of the movie, who's life is falling apart.  It is pretty obvious why, with his victim mentality.
The director's partner, who does off Hollywood plays as well as producing this movie and hopes to meet a blind date on the internet.
All these characters are played by well-known actors in this self-obsessed movie.  The only point is our moods and actions are so dependent on our sense of safety.
I can't say I found this movie entertaining, but only mildly diverting and for the most part pointless.  Maybe that is the point.",1066521600,2,1546,4.476868327402135

1817202,3,B00007K02C,"From a quiet little picture called ""Sex, Lies, and Videotape"" to big punches like ""Erin Brockovich"" and ""Traffic"", Steve Soderbergh has charted quite a route. He even made possibly one of the most enjoyable big-name movies of 2001, Ocean's Eleven.
Full Frontal was where he probably got his kicks doing something offbeat. Not many directors can, or would want to, knock off a quick, small-budget movie between major projects. But perhaps that's what makes Steven Soderbergh such an intriguing director.
To put it simply, Full Frontal confused me. Its look at Los Angeles movie-industry culture has a way of telescoping further and further outwards. Using the visual technique for which he won the Oscar for Best Director on Traffic (he again operates as his own director of photography on this movie under the alias of Peter Andrews), he separates the different storylines and worlds with different visual looks. Much of the film is shot on digital video, giving it a harsh, washed-out look. The movie-within-the-movie is on standard 35mm. And there are two move levels even beyond that, one featuring David Fincher and Brad Pitt.
I had trouble gaining full acceptance for Full Frontal. It covers its emotional resonance with layer upon layer of stylization and apathy. He holds the characters at arms length, never really showing any sympathy for their situations. Part of this is his visual style, which, while helpful in understanding the way the movie operates, tends to lend more of a documentary feel to the proceedings. Its wild tonal shifts can throw the viewer off ..., and Catherine Keener's behavior through the first two acts make it difficult to connect with her breakdown in the third.
Perhaps die-hard film geeks will rave about Full Frontal for its cleverness and its ""offbeat""ness. But that cleverness comes at the expense of the emotion that lies at the heart of this story.
All style and no substance, which is probably what Soderbergh was going for. And for that, it works. But it's difficult to care.",1065744000,13,2021,5.017857142857143
1817203,2,B00007K02C,"""Full Frontal"" is built on a remarkably juvenile screenplay by performance artist Coleman Hough; it's pretty amazing director Steven Soderbergh saw anything in it. It's literate enough, but about all the neurotic, postmodern things we've grown to loathe: weird sexual fetishes, the debate of  ""reality"" vs. ""unreality"", that two-degrees-of-separation-in-LA material, and, finally, unnervingly, Hollywood mechanics. We did not need another ludicrous, didactic structural analysis of Hollywood.
Boy do we get it. ""Full Frontal"" begins with an introduction of the characters through series of random, purposeless monologues drawn from different points in the film, then the opening scene of what looks like a big budget romance movie between an actor (Blair Underwood) and a journalist (Julia Roberts), just staged and false enough to let you know it's winking, before commencing with seemingly unrelated subplots that wink like an old creep with a pocket of butterscotch candies.
Another journalist (David Hyde Pierce) is clinging to his magazine job and his marriage to a human relations executive of some kind (Catherine Keener) who is quite clearly deranged or a descendant of the inquisition: She conducts interviews, all day it seems, by throwing a plastic blowup globe at her applicants and demanding the names of all the countries in Africa. This story is intercut with the opening of a second-rate stage comedy about Hitler, with a lead actor (Nicky Katt) channeling Cary Grant and quoting Peter Ustinov; and a massage therapist (Mary McCormack) who eventually crosses the paths of all the characters. David Duchovny appears in a cameo as a kinky movie producer that proves he's pretty hard up in life after ""The X-Files.""
Soderbergh is usually pretty savvy with a variety of film styles and camera lenses, but using cheap digital cameras mutes the small victories of comedy Hough's script does deliver. The hand-held jitter is agonizing as well. There's only so much of the follow-the-globe cam we can take.
Mostly, though, ""Full Frontal"" is a painful (and refreshing) reminder that not every chic, self-absorbed New Yorker like Hough can waltz into LA and force audiences to acknowledge her obvious highbrow wit and trendy verbal gymnastics by inserting bizarre non-sequitors like vampires, marijuana brownies and guys crawling along hotel floors. Keener especially rants and moans her way into the pantheon of grating personas. It could be said that Roberts acquits herself in a small role - Roberts seems to be doing a lot of that lately - while Pierce most closely approaches a performance of resonance.
Based on its less-is-nothing marketing campaign, Soderbergh and others basically knew ""Full Frontal"" was inside baseball, pertinent to the few, aimless for the rest. That knowledge doesn't excuse the film, particularly the ridiculous final scene that pulls back and back and back to reveal a couple of artists an hour past being ""on it"" and hip.",1065484800,5,2960,5.311300639658849
1817204,4,B00007K02C,"Even casual Steven Soderbergh fans must have figured out his pattern by now: A film for the box office, a film for me. Director Soderbergh is in a unique position to retain indie ""cred"" (""Schizopolis"", ""The Limey"") AND pump out box office hits (""Erin Brockovich"", ""Traffic"") that earn him the freedom to do more personal projects. ""Full Frontal"" falls somewhere between ""Welcome To L.A."" and ""The French Lieutenant's Woman"" with its movie-within-a movie structure and self-absorbed Angeleans. Good performances abound, particularly from David-Hyde-Pierce as a neurotic Woody Allen type. Catherine Keener (as Pierce's straying wife, an HR director with a rather unique method of conducting applicant interviews) continues her legacy of caustic, self-loathing ice-queens (she's beautiful, and a fine actress, but will she EVER play a likable character?!) Julia Roberts is so low key that she is nearly unrecognizable, which I found oddly appealing. Nicky Katt is the funniest Hitler since Dick Shawn, and David Duchovny is memorable as the pivotal character who ultimately ties all the stories together (and helps Soderbergh play the biggest ""in joke"" af all time on ""X-Files"" fans who remember psychic Peter Boyle's vision of how Fox Mulder would ultimately meet his demise!). Don't blink or you might miss two almost subliminal cameos by Terrance Stamp, reprising his role as ""Wilson"" from ""The Limey"" in an oh-so-clever tie-in.",1065484800,2,1428,5.408071748878924
