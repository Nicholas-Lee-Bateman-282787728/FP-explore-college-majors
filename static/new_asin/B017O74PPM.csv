7509502,4,B017O74PPM,"The title is a parting statement two friends have used for years. Here is a G-rated dramedy (yeah, you read that right) that highlights the importance of friendship. We have two lifelong buddies whose lives are in flux. One wants a baby and the other becomes ill. Yup, it's a chick flick.

Director Catherine Hardwick (""Red Riding Hood"" 2011) working from an original screenplay by Morwenna Banks (British television) gives us an upbeat tearjerker. Yup, you read THAT right, too! Actually, the women's touch is evident throughout: The sets look authentic, the clothes seem ""real,"" and relationships with parents, spouses and children all ring true. (And the casting of these two as little girls is perfect.) The husbands are rock solid, so no bad guys there!

We see:
  * Drew Barrymore (""Blended"") is Jess, the practical one. She is always swept into her chum's absurd schemes. She is almost frumpy next to her fashionista friend; she really wants a baby...and her uterus is ticking...
  * Toni Collette (""Hector and the Search for Happiness"") Milly is the wild child: She has an actress mother, a penchant for chichi shoes, LOVES ""Wuthering Heights"" and wants to see the moors.
  * Dominic Cooper (""Agent Carter"") Kit was a roadie with a rock show but settled down the moment he met Milly. He has to make the most challenging adjustment after her surgery.
  * Paddy Considine (""The World's End"") Darling Jago toughs it out through all of those attempts to get Jess pregnant. Eventually he takes a job on an oil rig to earn enough for in-vitro fertilization. He hopes they're gonna need a bigger boat! (They live on a boat.)
  * Jacqueline Bisset (""Rizzoli & Isles"") Miranda has enjoyed great success as an actress, and now all those years playing a doctor on that soap really pay off.
  * Tyson Ritter (""Parenthood"") Ace is an appealing bartender at a local pub, but he's moving to Yorkshire...

This is G-rated so expect no profanity or violence (well, a pretty funny childbirth), gunfire or mayhem. HOWEVER, be ready for (up-close and personal) scenes with injections, chemo sessions, vomiting and hair loss, plus a lengthy bit after a double-mastectomy. Terminal illness isn't pretty and this clearly doesn't pander to the faint of heart.

Affinity groups often attend advance screenings; the one which came tonight is affiliated with breast cancer research, so the issues and scenes were not a surprise. They loved it, though I found this attention to detail to be disconcerting. I guess I'm faint of heart. Be warned...",1447200000,11,2526,4.922169811320755

7509551,3,B017O74PPM,"This is a drama--not a romance or comedy. I thought it was a lighthearted movie about friendship. It is not. It deals with breast cancer and how it affects the person with cancer and her loved ones.  Toni Collette is a little over the top and Drew Barrymore seemed to sleepwalk through the movie.  Millie's mother, played by Jacqueline Bisset, is amazing; her small role steals the show and is the most believable.  Definitely, a tearjerker.

SPOILERS
The 1998 Beaches movie, which I can't help but compare this movie with, was a better movie with powerhouse performances by Bette Midler and Barbara Hershey.  That said, I do appreciate that this film did not try to copy Beaches. In ""Miss You Already"",  Milly does not cope well with her diagnosis and her body image changes.  She lashes out, a common response to an overly stressful event. Thankfully she does come to peace with her disease.",1520726400,,893,4.759740259740259

I got so engrossed with the first 15 minutes, I forgot about my schoolwork. The way the movie is shot is beautiful... it captures a sort of rawness and genuineness. It was lovely. There were times when I thought I knew where the story was going and it would quickly dodge in a different direction. I loved that. To not give too much away, it is a tear-jerker. I'm wiping tears away as I type. But there are plenty of joyous moments too. I highly recommend.",1517356800,2,626,4.313559322033898

I thought this movie was going to be a lot better like 50/50 with Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Seth Rogen.  I wish I could've gave this movie more stars, but the one who's having a hard time really gets on my nerves because she goes bananas and doesn't handle her situation very well at all and does a lot of stupid stuff.  I think this would've been better if they made this movie a hair shorter cutting out the stupid stuff she does and make her a strong person instead while fighting her battle.  I would recommend this if you like a good drama, but it's probably only worth renting because it's not really something you will want to watch more than once.",1508112000,2,884,4.432098765432099

Jess was the saint of this movie and Milly's character was really a two-sided coin; She seemingly loves her family and friends, yet she cheats on her husband not once but twice, causes Jess to almost lose her first child, and totally disrespects her family and friends and a surprise birthday party. I lost heart for her character in the end. Jess loves her friend Milly almost more than her own family at the end. It's a nice movie, but it's shallow and
almost artificial. Kit was played well, but he was too weak for Milly's character and no one would hardly stand up to Milly and her antics and attitude throughout the entire movie because she's sick and going to die and Milly acts like this because of her condition and she has a unlimited license to do whatever she pleases not matter whom she hurts",1505865600,,951,4.502890173410405

7509696,5,B017O74PPM,"When it was over it took me one second to text my best girlfriends to tell them to put this on their watchlist. The characterization of important female friendships have rarely been the subject of a movie; this one quickly passed the Bechdel Test, and passed it throughout the entirety of the movie.  The intimacy between these 2 women is familiar to any woman with a female best friend or friends: it's really impossible to put into words these relationships, but this movie managed to show it through the wonderful acting - although I have a feeling that in real life Drew and Toni have struck up a very wonderful relationship.  Both are absolutely wonderful actors, but there were sparks there that even the best actors can't fake.

Lovely movie.  It made me appreciate my girlfriends and want to give them huge hugs and I will the next time I am fortunate enough to see those wonderful beings.",1505001600,4,897,4.658227848101266

Barrymore is good as usual, although she tends to stick to what she does best.  She doesn't have a wide range of acting or just sticks to the same kind of funny/sad story comedies?

This movie spans a lifetime of friendship with all of it's ups and downs.  It really is sad because of the cancer and losses.

7509778,4,B017O74PPM,"I didn't want to like this movie since I knew going in someone was going to die from cancer and it was designed to be a tear jerker, basically an updated Beaches. However, I think the film treated the subject of cancer pretty authentically as far as the emotional and physical suffering that the cancer patient goes through and they allowed her to be vain and selfish which seemed realistic and honest. One criticism is that everyone in the movie was a little too beautiful to be real and some of the scenes had a music video quality to them, essentially putting an ""Instagram filter"" on cancer. If any of you have lived through watching a loved one die from cancer, you know it's just ugly and unless you are mega-rich, your hospice looks nothing like the one in the movie.

7509804,3,B017O74PPM,"There is cancer in my family, so it's not as if I'm watching as a stranger to what's in this movie, but Drew Barrymore, who has an intensely warm smile, basically just smiles intensely and warmly no matter what is happening throughout the film. They've both married perfectly wonderful husbands, and then Colette goes off the rails as she discovers different things, and then realizes she shouldn't go off the rails, and the husbands act upset and then are absolutely perfect again. I'm sure, for some people ""involved with cancer,"" it brings up excruciating feelings, but I can't believe that this was even close to what they went through. Not really. It just reminds them of the their own feelings. I'd rather watch a movie about THEIR feelingsreal onesdone by better writers and someone who isn't as one-note as Barrymore (who can do better than this) was in this movie. Toni Colette is always great, but as others have said, this character is almost narcissistic. Obviously, if you are suffering, you'll be thinking more about yourself than other people, but that's not what I mean. I mean, that's what her character was like from the beginning, before she suffers. And a perfect friendship? Closer than sisters? Someone who leaves their own life behind to help you through, and smiles warmly the whole time? If you can find that, you have found something rare indeed. Let's put it this way. If it's a lazy day, and you don't have anything better to do, or you're sick in bed, it's a lightweight view of a heavy subject, and oddly so, but if you don't expect much, you'll have a nice time watching it on the television or your phone, and be pleasantly surprised that it was a little better than I've described. In other words, keep your expectations low, and you'll enjoy it.",1496534400,,1779,4.723472668810289

7509814,3,B017O74PPM,"The actresses were amazing in this movie, and the story line of this movie is great. Me, being a healthcare professional, working with cancer patients everyday, this story speaks a lot of what cancer patients go through. It also speaks a lot of true friendship, which is also impossible to find nowadays. But I don't understand why it needs to include so many mature sexual scenes. Beginning of the movie, it showed teenager kids were at a party and a couple were kissing, the boy took off Milly's panties. towards 1/3 of the movie, it even implied Jess watched some porn, and collected some sperms for the purpose of his wife's in vitro pregnancy. Most of the PG-13 movies I've watched have few minutes worth of kissing, would show as far as couples lying in bed together. But this movie, has good 20-30 minutes worth of sex scenes, showed actors/actresses taking clothes off, long tongue to tongue kissing... I think the movie should have been rated PG-17 (and there should be such a thing) rather than PG-13. I regret very much I watched it with my 15 year old daughter. To be honest, a 13, or 14, or 15 year old is way less sexually mature than a 17 year old, and any girl younger than 17 is not ready for the sexual scenes this movie contains, let alone understanding the dark part of this movie (i.e. how massed up Milly got, cheated on her husband, etc. before she found out her breast cancer had metastasized to her brain).",1495929600,7,1431,4.528957528957529

7509896,5,B017O74PPM,"Sad to see the 1, 2 & 3 star reviews on this movie. I found lots of it to be comical, but more realistically, it's definitely drama. I'd put it right up there with ""Terms of Endearment"". Both actresses do a phenomenal job. I don't know what it's like to be terminally ill, but this movie does shed some serious light on cancer/mastectomy/and the after-effects. This story is about a true friendship between two girls from grade school until death. No death is not a comedy but the way ""Millie"" sees life brings a lot of joy and she certainly displays that she wants to live and be loved. I don't think that every woman who has cancer feels the need to go out and have an affair to feel loved, but in this rendition, she's not getting what she wants from her husband after he sees her breasts gone, doesn't wish to touch her (but continues to love her). Difficult situation to be in as a woman.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves stories about friendship, love, laughter, and sadness.  Keep an open mind. You never know what you would do in this situation.  Sometimes difficult to understand what Millie's words are, especially as the end comes nearer for her (she whispers a lot) and no matter how loud I turn up the volume, I still could not understand her words - her strong English accent got in the way!",1489017600,6,1323,4.413934426229508

I love Toni Colette, but I didn't relate much to her character, Millie. There was a scene, though, where Jess confronts Millie, and she's judgemental and not at all understanding of what her scared, dying friend is going through. That was the only scene where I felt anything for either character.
As usual, Drew Barrymore plays Drew Barrymore, so, that's reliable.

Attempts to be chain-jerking, but didn't succeed with me.  Why?  Barrymore's character was long-suffering, while Colette's was so narcissistic I couldn't sympathize.  Although there are a couple of moving scenes, for me there was no a-hah moment, no  sense of triumph or closure.  Felt as though I'd wasted my time.",1487980800,,446,5.111111111111111

There is nothing funny about this movie.  I was disappointed in Drew's performance, I really thought she might have broken her stereotypical leading role persona, dug deep and played a sincere, heartfelt lead, but alas she did not.  It was contrived, hardly believable, made cancer seem trite and well.... was just a bad movie.",1486598400,6,493,4.6976744186046515

I suppose if you want to immerse yourself into the world of illness and how it ravages the body and how people cope with such things then this movie is for you.  Personally, I watch  movies and TV shows for entertainment, I'm not looking for life lessons and the struggles of people who must suffer beyond comprehension with curve balls that life certainly can throw.  Acting was fair not a Barrymore or a Toni Collett fan.

There are a few sexual moments but not that bad. I would recommend viewing over 18 years of age. It is just one of those stories that one of us have dealt with in our life or somebody we know has been through the same circumstances with a loved one or close friend with cancer.

7510256,4,B017O74PPM,"Definitely not a comedy.  I've seen horror flicks where you laugh a couple times, and those aren't categorized as comedies.  I would have preferred to give this 3-1/2 stars, but I will say that one thing this movie did a very good job at is dispelling the myth that people who are terminally ill become angelic fonts of wisdom.  They are frightened, in pain, and already grieving the loss of their health, who they used to be -- and what/who they are going to miss.  So yes, they can become jerks sometimes, and jerks or not, it's incredibly tough for all those who love them.  This really doesn't display just how devastating such an illness can be, but then it would probably be too grim if it tried.  As a final note, the music is excellent.",1485820800,,744,4.4338235294117645

7510835,4,B017O74PPM,"Surprisingly good movie. I had saved this on my list to watch but then always kept bypassing it, thinking, ""It's a Drew Barrymore movie; it's probably not that good"". I was pleased to be proved wrong when I finally gave in and watched it one night. The movie has both excellent acting and a plot line with enough depth to keep you interested and take it out of the realm of ""chick flick"", but enough lightness to keep it from being too serious and leaving you in a mental funk.
Ms. Barrymore and Ms. Collette are total naturals together and as you watch this, you truly feel you're watching the story of two women who have known each other for years. The dialogue is the type of thing you can imagine yourself saying to your own best friend or husband. All in all *she puts on her best Roger Ebert voice*, I'd give this one two thumbs up. Perfect to watch late night when alone or with your significant other. I can see men enjoying this just as much as women. Some scenes are a bit intense, either sexually (though NOTHING graphic in this movie) or due to the situations, so I'd leave this one to the adults and maybe mid teens.",1484697600,5,1129,4.330188679245283

Drew is not her usual funny self but her performance is that of a regular, everyday woman trying to maintain a BFF relationship with a sick friend and a very adult relationship with a love interest. Barrymore and Collette are wonderful in their respective roles but I didn't feel there was major BFF chemistry between them. More like sisters. Heartfelt, emotional, ups and downs. Drew does drama well. Haven't been many movies that I've really liked lately. This movie gets high marks for entertainment. Watch with your BFF or sister.

7511166,3,B017O74PPM,"Not really sure what the whole point of this movie was.  I've always enjoyed performances by Drew Barrymore & Toni Collette, but they were both just kind of blah in this movie.  There was really no plot other than one of the characters dealing with cancer.  We never really got drawn into the characters so never really felt moved by anything that happened.  If you need to kill 90 minutes, then there are worse things you can do than watch this movie, but it's really not that great.",1484006400,,484,4.465909090909091

7511176,1,B017O74PPM,This movie did nothing well. The writers and producers missed the mark with this narrative. None of the characters were developed properly and I do believe some of the breast cancer dialogue needed some fact checking.

7511193,5,B017O74PPM,"Awesome movie.  It tore my guts out as I had just lost my daughter to leukemia a year ago.
What a tragic disease.
But, having someone who walks with you through it ALL is such a ""GIFT"".  It changes us all.  And, never to be forgotten.  They live on in us.  We live life with more intention!
Chemotherapy is such a devastating treatment to endure.  We go in with so much hope that going through the treatment will end the nightmare; only to find out it didn't work.

Since I saw so many over the course of eight months not make it; I found no comfort in being there and watching so many life's going through the treatment and yet only to learn it wasn't enough to put it in arrest.

The movie is explicit, accurate and so true.  What a great and true depiction of the raw reality of it.

I found comfort and felt hugged in my own grief.
We can't imagine nor even begin to understand, but this movie paints it truly and includes the horrors of all those having to walk through this kind of ordeal.  Children, spouses, parents, friends and medical staff.

Many lessons to be learned in the art of dying and comforting one another.  We all get a chance to grow up a bit.  And then....We continue on and they are no longer suffering.....Just those left behind.",1483920000,242,1255,4.3076923076923075

it can be hard to watch but this is life. It can happen to everybody and it can take everything in a short time.

Without giving away too much, it did highlight how humans are flawed even when they have the best intentions, they sometimes seek self satisfaction vs. being loyal to those who stand by them through tough times.

Warning- This is rated PG-13 but the frequency of sexual situations that really push the line are not appropriate for a younger tween. I often watch PG-13 movies with my 10, 12, and 12 year olds and this was uncomfortable during many scenes we fast forwarded.",1482969600,,587,4.699029126213592
