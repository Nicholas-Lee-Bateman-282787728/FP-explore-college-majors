5801532,4,B00DHJT200,"""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" (2013 release; 114 min.) brings the story of Walter Mitty (played by Ben Stiller), an employee at Life Magazine who is your average guy but with a severe case of daydreaming. Walter has a secret crush on Cheryl (played by Kristen Wiig), a co-worker. At the beginning of the movie, Walter tries to send a ""wink"" to Cheryl on the eHarmony dating site, but it doesn't work, so Walter talks to Todd, a customer representative, to try and fix the issue. On the very same day of Walter's 42nd birthday, it is announced that Life is being acquired and that the last issue, coming out in 2 1/2 weeks, will feature a cover shot by famous but reclusive photographer Sean O'Connell (played by Sean Penn). O'Connell sent the negative to Walter's care, but Walter cannot locate it, forcing him to track down O'Connell. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, this movie (based on a short story) is a remake of the original Walter Mitty movie, released in 1947. Second, the movie is epic in scope and eye-candy from start to finish, with some astonishing visuals, in particular when the movie is set in Greenland and Iceland. In my mind, the movie is as much a travelogue as it is an emotional story. Third, speaking of the movie's emotional pull, it very much succeeds and I will admit tearing up on more than one occasion. The best scene in the movie for me is when Walter is in Iceland, debating his options with himself, when Cheryl appears out of the blue in a dream sequence, singing David Bowie's ""Space Oddity"". Just superb. But the entire movie is every bit as epic as the trailer (which I had seen several times in recent weeks) make you lead to believe. Towards the very end of this incredible journey, Walter meets up with Todd, the eHarmony guy, and Todd blurts out ""It's like Indiana Jones becoming the lead singer of the Strokes!"", and that just about sums it up. Speaking of the Strokes, no, their music is not featured in the movie, but a bunch of other great indie music is, including Of Monsters and Men, Rogue Wave, Junip, and Jose Gonzalez (of Junip), just to name those. Check out the latter's ""Step Out"", an epic-sounding tune that is the unofficial anthem/theme song of the movie. (The soundtrack is available here on Amazon, for anyone interested.)

""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" opened today here in Cincinnati and the late matinee showing I saw this at, was nicely attended. I was pleasantly surprised by the movie, as it turned out to be just as good as the trailer made me think it would. This is the perfect movie for a family with young teenagers to catch over the holidays. ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1387843200,30,2787,4.58316633266533
5801533,5,B00DHJT200,"This was one of the first humorous short stories on which I ""imprinted"" when I was young. Up until then, I thought I was the only one who could go off on wild adventures without leaving the house. Author James Thurber showed me otherwise.

Our day-dreaming Caspar Milquetoast imagines PG-rated heroic actions, brilliant strategies and a love story for the ages in order to escape the humdrum boredom of the job he has held for sixteen years. Writer Steve Conrad (""The Pursuit of Happyness"") has wisely set his story in a current corporate down-sizing situation, fraught with job loss and grief for a magazine that will no longer be printed. The company taking over is staffed by heartless suits who only see numbers, not people in that magazine.

We watch:
  * Ben Stiller (""Arrested Development"") as our eponymous hero who ""spaces out"" occasionally. He has a passport but has never gone anywhere.
  * Kathryn Hahn (""We're the Millers"") is his sister who wants to audition for Rizzo in ""Grease.""
  * Kristen Wiig (""Saturday Night Live"") has just been hired at the same magazine; she has a three-legged dog and a two-legged son.
  * Adam Scott (""Parks and Recreation"") plays the new broom that is going to sweep everything clean. He is cold, demanding and has no clue about the history of the company that is being taken over.
  * Shirley MacLaine (""Downton Abbey"") is Walter's ever-lovin' mom, being moved to that assisted living facility with a piano that is waaaay too big.
  * Patton Oswalt (""Young Adult"") works at the computer-dating service that Walter subscribes to; he wants our hero to have a more interesting rsum.

It has been a Hollywood dream to commit this fantasy-laced story to film for a long, long time (the one with Danny Kaye really doesn't count). Now with unfettered Computer Generated Imaging, director Ben Stiller has finally achieved the dream. I would point out however, that the best parts are the ""plain"" scenes, the red car driving on a lonely road, the skate boarder going down that long hill, the runner crossing the bridge, those are the remarkable scenes that stayed in my head long after the happy ending. Oh... And the volcano!

Yup, people to root for, with no gunfire, no vehicular mayhem, no profanity, no blowie uppie stuff and no sweaty bodies; just Entertainment. I've asked Amazon to notify me when the DVD is available.",1387238400,4,2362,4.823821339950372

Ben Stiller does his usual fantastic job of playing the character perfectly throughout his development.  We all have imagination, and to see how a person's imagination can lead them into making it a reality is absolutely invigorating.

5801667,5,B00DHJT200,"Possibly one of my favorite movies of all time. This movie took me by such surprise because I have no memory of how or why I watched it the first time, but I remember just sitting there being stunned at how much I related to this character and how simple and plain life and it's problems can be- to being (by the end of the movie) envious and enriched by this characters path. I would recommend- and I mean this to the point of almost saying these would be deal breakers for me if you didn't have the options- watch it in HD and with surround sound. It's so beautiful. Filming on location does a lot for ANY movie, but you'll know why after seeing this that any 'green screen' nonsense would have ruined the movie. And the music is crucial.
For the price of this movie, I have something I'll carry with me for life. And that's a hell of a trade off. And to the three or four people that know this reference: This movie hit the same spot as Joe Vs. The Volcano for me and if you know that spot- this movie is for you as well.",1515283200,,1024,4.099502487562189

5801670,5,B00DHJT200,"This movie is good, not great but good. But I give a five star rating because the copy I got of the movie came with everything. Blu-ray, DVD, and the soundtrack all for five bucks. Totally worth it for the soundtrack alone.",1514764800,,223,4.333333333333333
5801671,5,B00DHJT200,"This movie has it all in terms of the best way a movie should be made.  It has a rock solid plot, that's punchy, fast, and solid. It's all about the chase - finding Sean Penn wherever he is in the world, in a volcano, photographing leopards in Afghanistan, or traveling on ships across shark filled oceans one clue (photo) at a time. It has a balling skateboard scene, a red or a blue car, and suspense while waiting for the leopard to appear. It's about love and relationships, it is about turning your daydreams into reality by actually experiencing the things that you were always afraid of in your waking life. It's about being a human being over a corporate creep. It's about your mother who always has your back no matter how much you day dream.  It's about friends who are there for you when the doody hits the fan!  It's about taking risks and changing your life for the better.  I highly recommend this movie on a cold and blustery winter's night because it will warm your soul, like a hot steaming bowl of chicken soup!",1514678400,,1029,4.428571428571429

The amazing things happening because of Walter are actually happening because of the change in his life. This alone shows symbolism of how amazing one could be if one risked everything.

Of course computer graphics allowed for some surreal adventures, but the premise was grounded somewhere deep within every human heart. Some of it was predictable, boy gets girl, but the finale was not. It was an inward voyage, something Proust might have written on a very clear day. What I do know is that I needed to see this film at this particular moment. It has a layered profundity that another viewing or two will be needed to fully take in the wide scope of the experience.

5801716,5,B00DHJT200,"I thought that this was a very moving and well done movie and I wasn't a Ben Stiller fan until watching this movie. I think Mr. Stiller did a magnificent job in his portrayal of Mitty who is an average individual living a life of quiet desperation until he has the courage to follow his heart. It's one of those movies that you will want to watch more than once.

Walter Mitty, played by Ben Stiller, might remind you of yourself as living an insignificant and repetitive life at the mercy of institutions, society, politicians and circumstances. While Mitty suffers through life, he has moments in which his imagination provides him an escape from this prison into a world of his own making as hero and adventurer.

Mitty appears pathetic and weak as he learns and reacts that ""Life"" magazine, where he works, is being repurposed and downsized. The new transition manager and his lackey's tease and humiliate Mitty for being out of it and call him Major Tom referring to the song by David Bowie which comes to play an important role in the movie.

Despite the abuse from the transition manager, Mitty continues to accept his plight in life until  he freaks out when he sees that the most representative negative of Life magazine's history that is to be used on the last issue of Life magazine is missing. This leads Mitty to start a personal journey that forces him way outside his comfort zone and his routine into a real-life adventure as he tries to find and retrieve the negative. As the movie progresses Mitty becomes more and more committed to this self quest and finds himself traveling the world and experiencing real life adventures beyond what he had previously day dreamed. This self quest to follow his unique path consumes and nourishes him in ways he's never known before and which results in an admiring self evolution.

I won't give away details of the film, but highly recommend it. Well, maybe just a peak... There is some awesome cinematography in this movie. The scenes of Mitty skateboarding through Iceland are fantastic and are guaranteed to evoke an emotional reaction from you if you like adventure or nature by any measure.

Even if you have already seen this film, it's fun watching again. Especially if you like films depicting individuals discovering and following their own path. The travel and skateboarding scenes by themselves are worth watching the movie again.",1508544000,,2396,4.803398058252427

5801731,5,B00DHJT200,I have never wrote a review and don't plan on it again. However this movie deserves five stars in my eyes. It's script and acting is skillful and subtle in a way that will leave you longing to experience the meaningful things in life more fully. Walter Mitty is a film developer for Time magazine who is dedicated to his job and family. At some point in his life the grind of daily responsibility has taken away his ability to see the wonder in life and sapped away the courage to pursue anything outside the lines of routine. HIs determination to do his job well cause him to chase after a lost negative from a film roll. The things he does and the people he meets along the way change him at the very core and he finds instead of wishing to be something incredible it is better to have the courage to face life opportunities as they come. The scenery and picture quality is beautiful and only one or two crude attempts at humor mar what would be a perfectly executed film.,1505865600,,974,4.327868852459017
5801732,5,B00DHJT200,"I watched this movie on the recommendation of a local radio show.  When I saw that Ben Stiller was in it, I was initially put off.  I am not a big fan of his ""normal"" movies.  I am so glad I gave this one a chance.  The movie was not only well written and acted, it was a visual treat.  It truly does feel like a National Geographic special in that regard.  Lucious scenery, and great depictions of the people native to the region.  The script is well written with enough of the original short story evident that you have a great backbone for the parts that were expanded upon and added.  There are many lessons I took away from the movie without once feeling preached to.  Finally, I love the way you are left to your own devices to determine if this was yet another of Walter's elaborate fantasies, or, in fact, an actual life-changing decision he made to finally begin to live the life he so long had only dreamed of.  The Secret Life of Walter Mitty definitely earned 5 stars in my humble opinion!",1505865600,3,1001,4.304812834224599

5801741,5,B00DHJT200,"My girlfriend and I had seen this movie, a few years ago, and really enjoyed it. Not the typical ""bad mistakes followed by bad mistakes"" Ben Stiller formulated fare. Recently, we had thought about seeing this again, and decided to buy the Blu-Ray + DVD + Digital Download bundle from Amazon.

I had looked over the Blu-Ray.com review to see how the video and sound transfers had fared, and made a confident purchase. The reviews for the blu-ray quality were not at all exaggerated: the cinematography and love of photographic detail are beautifully transferred, and the audio track engages and explodes appropriatelyin the appropriate places.

As I had not reviewed the extras section, there was a not-insignificant detail I missedinclusion of the non-score soundtrack!

There was no mention on the packaging of this value-add, and even a blurb on the back about looking for the sountrack on CD, which made this completely unexpected. What a great inclusion for fans of film who stick around to see the music credits!

The blu-ray includes the soundtrack on CD? How come this isn't a thing?",1504310400,,1090,4.972527472527473

Ben Stiller showed genius when he wrote the story and directed as well as starred in it. There wasn't a single instance I would do differently. Absolutely perfect story and brought to the big screen with a cutting precision that makes this an authentic classic.
Walter Mitty is often zoning out, yet not because he lacks courage, more because he's never had a reason or the opportunity to flex his bravery along with his big heart. As the story unfolds, you wonder what this tiny little man can do to reach the formidable goal of finding a go-getter photographer often hanging off dangerous assignments.
Hold on to your hearts and your smiles as Walter Mitty will make the whole world pale in comparison to what he can achieve.
An example of devotion and dedication we can hold on to for a long time to come.

5801876,2,B00DHJT200,Definitely not one of Drillers best movies.  The plot was not interesting the action was kind of cheesy and the ending was very lackluster.  Was really waiting for the movie to end at multiple points in the movie.,1491004800,,213,4.578947368421052

5801878,5,B00DHJT200,I really enjoyed this movie. The scenery and the story were terrific. I had seen other reviews that liked the Danny Kaye version of the movie more than Ben Stiller's version. I prefer the Stiller version.,1490486400,,204,4.694444444444445

5801906,5,B00DHJT200,An unknown gem! I'm blown away at how excellent this movie is without ever hearing of it until I was searching for the original with Danny Kaye for my mother. I purchased both the movie and much of the music too. It's similar to Second Hand Lions and other hidden gems that your family watches over and over and over. I've watched it several times since purchasing it in order to show it to family members and friends to watch their reactions. It's a crowd pleaser. And I still crack up at the elevator scene as well as others...it's just very well done! Wonderful!!! Ben Stiller finally won me over. Bravo! Encore! Encore! (Seriously...make more movies like this.),1488672000,4,665,4.6440677966101696

5801927,4,B00DHJT200,This was a free movie on international flights - and I've taken a bunch!  I've watched this over and over - and just had to have the CD.  My wife and I have actually visited Iceland so naturally really related to that part of the movies.  Ben Stiller was great although gave the movie 4 stars because I wasn't crazy about Kristen Wiig.  Sean Penn was absolutely perfect in this role and liked the eHarmony sub-plot.,1486771200,,415,4.421052631578948

5801996,3,B00DHJT200,"Overall just felt inconsistent. It's off-beat and quirky at times with a surreal ""Being There"" feel, at others it's like ""Napoleon Dynamite"", and others it's a romantic comedy. Although the plot was clear and the ""25"" macguffin central enough to the story, I still never felt that I understood the theme or feel the film was aiming for. Granted it's well-acted and the visuals are impressive, particularly the mountainous terrain of Afghanistan, but by the end of the film when everything wraps up I was still left uneasy and uncertain about what I had just seen. I guess just take it for what it's worth.

The odd thing about the film was the placement of eHarmony and how that sub-ploy sort of followed the narrative, and how I was uncertain if the online dating service was being painted in a positive or negative light. The Papa Johns and Cinnabun references really pushed the envelope of commercial placement. Sure, they were quirky devices to add to the oddness of the story but they also felt like commercials.",1484611200,,1017,4.778409090909091

5802085,5,B00DHJT200,"While you shouldn't expect this to be anything like the old version with Danny Kaye, this movie is fantastic nonetheless. While the movie maintains Walter's tendency to daydream, the daydreams aren't quite as complex. That being said, this movie is incredibly entertaining as a man wakes up from his torpor and seizes life. The cinematography of the movie is incredible and immediately made me want to travel again. If I ever end up in Iceland, then I want to long-board down a mountainside. While I'm guilty of taking far too many pictures, I loved the idea that some moments shouldn't be captured but enjoyed. I highly recommend this movie because after watching it, I wanted more from my life.",1482105600,,696,4.857142857142857

I ""get"" this film, whereas others might not. And it's more of a road trip, journey, type of concept. I really liked it and I bought the Stretch Armstrong doll ( like in This movie), to give as a gift with the DVD to certain family members for Christmas just for fun.",1481932800,,426,4.083333333333333

5802114,5,B00DHJT200,Loved loved loved this movie. Mostly because I have a never ending case of wanderlust suffocated by the day to day drudge of real life. Ben Stiller is known to play some cringe worthy goofy characters...which I love....but in this movie he's a lovable character that your root for til the end.

5802116,5,B00DHJT200,"When I read the short story for a college class, I found it depressing. Walter Mitty served as the model for our lesson on the anti-hero. Since I had no real expectations for this movie, I was able to go with an open mind. Might as well see what they could do with it. Also, I really like Ben Stiller. What they did was turn the anti-hero into a latent hero, and as he replaces day dreams with reality, we accompany him on a marvelous journey. It's a visual masterpiece and a touching, humorous, uplifting story. That said, I didn't like Adam Scott's character. He was basically cut and pasted from Stepbrothers. He serves as a place holder for the evil corporate representative, and does a fine job of being extremely unlikable. This is a movie that I love to introduce to people who haven't seen it so I can watch it again while I watch them enjoy it.",1481241600,,853,4.371069182389937

Recommended it to all my skeptical friends and they all enjoyed it too.  One of my all time favorites.  Adored all of it... the story, acting, scenery and music.  The movie inspired me to step out and fulfill a dream of visiting Iceland.  Spent three weeks in Iceland in July 2016 with 3 of the skeptical friends and we hunted down some of the movie sites such as Seydisfjordur and Kirkjufell.

5802207,5,B00DHJT200,"Funny and pretty clean. Family friendly with the exception of a rude moment or two. Sweet. Rated PG. Kristen Wigg as Cheryl Melhoff, the love interest of Walter Mitty (Ben Stiller), is quite good in a way that is much more subtle than a lot of her over-the-top SNL (and other movie) performances. Sean Penn as adventurous photographer Sean O'Connell brings a calmness to his main scene with Ben Stiller. You may recognize Adrian Martinez as Mitty's assistant, Hernando. He's the guy in the State Farm television commercials who always yells at Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers, ""Hey Rodgers!""

***************************************************************Spoiler Alert*****************************************************************************************
The funniest scenes to me were when Stiller's character goes into a bar in Greenland and a helicopter pilot (Olafur Darri Olafsson), is doing a horrible karaoke version of the Human League's massive early 80s' hit ""Don't You Want Me?"" The helicopter pilot is supposed to fly Mitty out to a ship at sea to deliver some radio components. Stiller's character sits at a table with the pilot as the pilot finishes a big glass boot of beer. There's a momentary pause in which Mitty is looking with trepidation at the drunken pilot who is supposed to fly him into an approaching storm that is just hilarious (at least to me). Following scenes in which Mitty finds himself in the ocean as men on a ship and then he mispronounce the word ""purpose!"" while yelling are also hilarious. An earlier scene with Kristen Wigg which is preceded by Stiller saying, ""I've got that Benjamin Buttons' thing"", is also hilarious though one would have had to have seen the Brad Pitt movie ""The Curious Case Of Benjamin Buttons"" to understand the reference.",1476748800,,1802,5.3674911660777385

5802233,5,B00DHJT200,"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is 2013 comedy adventure film written by Steve Conrad based on James Thurbers short story of the same name. However, the only thing thats the same in both stories is the main character of ita guy who daydreams a lot. The whole plot is entirely new as with its characters.
Based on the actors playing the characters one would assume that this is going to be one of those over-the-top comedy, but it isnt. The main character played by Ben Stiller perfectly resonate to any ages when they feel like they are stuck. The whole movie will make one feel a sense of wanderlustwith the help of the amazing cinematography and equally remarkable soundtrack. (trust me, it is amazing.)

This will be one of those self-discovering movies that will make you think of how you should be living your life.",1476576000,,820,4.616438356164384

But please take this movie for what it is, and not what you think it should be...meaning, this isn't an oscar winning blah blah blah, rather, it is a great story of a person finding oneself through adversity.  We all day dream, or at least I do, about doing things that might seem impossible until one day, you get the courage to try it.  It might not be quite as grand as what Walter does, but it makes you want to take some chances right?  I love a movie that both entertains and makes me want to do better...I realize this is a remake and while I generally dislike remakes, Kristen and Ben have good chemistry, good awkward chemistry :)  Rent it, you will not be disappointed!",1476316800,,709,4.340909090909091

It touched that side of me that roots for the underdog; that side of me that loved the idea of seeing the world, instead of being stuck in the place where I was born and raised, afraid that I would never see other places, and never experience other people's cultures.  This movie is for every person out there who has wanderlust in their blood, and loves the idea that even the ordinary guy/girl, could achieve his/her dreams; all it takes is to have that first spark,or someone's encouragement.

Our children are all 11 and above in age and I wouldn't recommend this movie for children much younger than that due to a couple of scenes like a shark scene and a scene with a drunk pilot that could be quite scary for younger children.  The overall message may resound with some adults as it has to do with living your dreams instead of just thinking about them and also the corporate downsizing world.  This isn't the greatest movie ever but it is good enough to merit one watching.,1472774400,,572,4.327102803738318

We are all guilty of self doubt at some point and Walter Mitty has greatness and humility in him, he just needed a catalyst to get him going.  The missing #25 was that catalyst.  Silly at times (Disney) but worth the watch.  A few special moments like Kristin Wigg's rendition of Space Oddity and Sean Penn's recounting of a simple reminder to us all about beauty stand out.",1470787200,,488,4.449438202247191

Travelling the world to find a photographer isn't necessarily realistic, but meeting someone nice at the park and trying to impress their kid and holding hands is. Too often cinema sets dangerously, unrealistic expectations for relationships. Walter Mitty does not.

The DVD came with an expired coupon for Shutterfly on the cover. We thought that was funny.",1468886400,,527,5.057471264367816

My biggest concern, aside from the unnecessary need to empower Ben Stiller, is why they cast Kristen Wiig so she could stand around and look bemused. This one sat around on a shelf in development hell for a long time before it got made, and the staple marks on the script and casting show. What would this have been like ten years ago with Owen Wilson or Jim Carrey? We won't know, but the story of the making of this one might be more interesting than the end product.",1468454400,,502,4.351063829787234

5802499,2,B00DHJT200,"Obviously having grown up with the 1947 Danny Kaye version of this film, it was hard to be completely unbiased.  I like Ben Stiller but Danny Kaye can run circles around him with his comedy/acting talents/musicianship.  That said, I was still curious to see it for the story and from all the positive reviews on here it is clear to me that none of them have seen the 1947 version.  In the original version the Daydreams were much more prominent in the film, whereas in the remake they seem to be an afterthought (more like quick filler material just to get on with the real world story).  In the 1947 film he is a proof reader for a comic book company and has a very vivid imagination (which leads to many detailed daydreams) and ends up involved with a girl that may or may not be real and a murder/spy ring that may or may not be real.  In the remake he is a photo editor for Life Magazine who goes on a trip around the world to find a photographer to ask him about a missing photo negative.  There are funny moments in the film (ie making a mad dash for the lone bike to transport him off the fisherman's docks) and the tour around the world is interesting, but ultimately the whole point of the story is kind of lame.  Bottom line if you want to see a better actor and a more entertaining story, then watch the 1947 Danny Kaye version.",1468108800,,1339,4.248031496062992
5802500,5,B00DHJT200,Very good movie. I would watch it again. Great acting and story line.,1468022400,,69,4.384615384615385
5802501,5,B00DHJT200,I really enjoyed this film.,1467763200,,27,4.6
5802502,4,B00DHJT200,"Ben Stiller directs the 1939 short story, already known to audiences through Danny Kayes 1947 movie of the same name.  On the surface as the film starts cool and aloof as the character appears to be, but its worth sticking with it to see the change as the film progresses.  Ben Stiller directs himself as the titular daydreamer, who is a lonely, apparently buttoned up, individual in the Negative Asset department at Life magazine.  As the magazine is downsized, he is tasked with producing the image to form the magazine cover, provided by the magazines ultra-reclusive photographer, who has (he claims) produced an image that is the quintessence of Life.  However, the negative for which he is responsible has gone missing, and he must overcome his awkwardness to interact with the co-worker for whom he has a crush, as he searches for the elusive Frame 25..
If the first half is marked by day-dream heavy sequences which I found occasionally jarring, despite the cleverness of the photography, the second half is where the film really gains momentum, as the daydreams give way to Mittys reality as he finds ever new limits to his comfort zone.  As we move from the office world filled with its somewhat too-cartoonish characters, we move to the bleak yet starkly beautiful scenery of Greenland and Iceland as the movie opens up both literally and figuratively.
If the film has a weakness it is that it hinges so much on Stillers performance.  He gets away with it, but the role does not speak to his strengths, and the chemistry with Kirsten Wiigs character is not evident.  This is more than made up for by the gentle and thoughtful way the movie unwraps its theme with Mittys revealing of his inner potential, combined with some truly exceptional photography.  First time directors can often fall into tricksy photography to mark their calling card, but here the tricks and ideas seem actually more like Stiller is having fun, rather than trying to just squeeze them in.  It really works, and ultimately, what really makes this work is not the set piece moments, but a gentle understated approach to the sequences between the set pieces.
Go with it, persevere through the daydream sequences which can be overegged.. and I think youll find this movie a surprise on many levels, quite beautiful, and ultimately far more satisfying than you probably expected.  Its more reflective, than comedic  and the better for it, if you know what you're getting into.",1467763200,,2458,4.870503597122302

I've always liked him a lot, but felt this really showcased him.  I had forgotten how it was so beautiful to just look at.  It finally occurred to me that because he is the guy who works in the photography section (in the basement) of the Life magazine building, everything was shot with a photographer's eye.  How absolutely perfect is that.  I don't think I was putting that all together in the first viewing.  Sean Penn....a perfect part and a perfect guy for it.  Shirley Maclaine was an added delight.

It is smart, thoughtful, reflective and exciting.  It puts a different spin to the bucket list.  It incites courage, going after what one is passionate about, not impulsive, but purposeful, in a desire to achieve a purpose.  Life is what one makes of it.

This is now our favorite Ben Stiller movie.  He did a great job acting in this one, in addition to directing it.  Highly recommended.",1460851200,,556,4.545454545454546

5802866,5,B00DHJT200,"A Parallel But Not an Equal
 A story showing the life of a man who day dreams turns into a phenomenal adventure in the movie The Secret Life of Water Mitty. The movies central idea is from the short story The Secret Life of Walter Mitty by James Thurber, but it is no equal to it. The movie in comparison to the short story has a dynamic plot line. The movie shows a man who day dreams about adventures in foreign places doing audacious things, but then finds himself back in reality of his very run of the mill boring life where he does not take risks. Then through the progression of the movie he changes his lifestyle to take more risks and his daydreams start to become something he realistically could and would do. Whereas the short story it is about an older married man who day dreams and comes back to reality through out a day. He imagines cliche things but stays the same person throughout the short story. There is no growth of the character nor a change in the story dynamic. The movie was one that is not only very entertaining but can teach the viewers good life lessons. There is something to take from the movie and the evolvement of the character is much more entertaining then that in the short story. I would prefer the movie over the short story.
 Many people say that The Secret Life of Walter Mitty was not as astounding as it was for others because of the confusion of the tone it needed. They ask, was the movie supposed to be sad? Happy? Comedic? Devastating? Triumphant? Some people did not enjoy it because it didn't have one set tone, it was a bunch of the emotions all jumbled together. To argue this point viewers may understand that this is a movie that is supposed to be a non-fictional and possible movie. It is about a struggle of a man within his life and the movie beautifully portrays the many emotions that you go though in everyday lives. It gives a good somewhat realistic picture of this emotional life changing journey.
 This movie kept my eyes on the movie and my mind entertained. I enjoyed it very much and thought it was very well scripted and executed. It is of good educational value as well, it is a movie with life lessons intwined with it. I enjoyed The Secret Life of Walter Mitty and would recommend it highly to anyone who it considering watching it.",1460592000,,2305,4.418823529411765
5802867,5,B00DHJT200,"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, directed by Ben Stiller, weaves together the simplistic theme found in James Thurbers original short story. The movie, however, expands on the idea of dazing over and living in an alternate reality to escape the monotony of everyday life, but follows the life of Walter Mitty over the course of a few months as his dream world slowly begins to coincide with his reality.
Mitty spends a majority of the film traversing the globe in an attempt to find an elusive photographer who claims to have taken a photo that is the ""quintessence of life and, unfortunately, has been lost. His travels take him far from the monotony of his daily life as possible. As he searches the world he journeys from a karaoke bar in Greenland, to a shark fight in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, to the upper Himalayas and back to his home in New York City. Although the travels are nothing short of a crazy string of miracles, they blur the lines between Mittys boring reality and his exciting dream world.
While some might say that the movie is about a hunt for a photo, I believe that this movie encompasses much more than that. The movie ultimately is a hunt for truths and excitement, an escape from everyday life. Along with other lessons, Mitty learns that beautiful things don't ask for attention (Sean OConnell). Mitty begins to experience life through the simple lens of a film camera and to understand that sometimes having less is having more.
Although at first it was a challenge for me to see how a short story that takes place over a few hours could be expanded into a full length film, I now see that it is merely the ideas of how this man, Walter Mitty, lives his life that was expanded. For all we as readers know, the movie may be the future of the short story. Overall, I found the movie to be engaging and almost philosophical. I found that the movie stirred a desire to travel and to experience the world. Life is about courage and going into the unknown.",1460592000,,1988,4.509695290858725
5802868,4,B00DHJT200,"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty portrays the story of Walter Mitty, who contains a blue-collar job and a below average, dull life. He works at time magazine as the negative assets manager and his job becomes threatened as the company is transferring to digital. He dreams of having a relationship with his coworker, Cheryl Melhoff, who he finds while trying to start an eHarmony account along with many other adventures when he spaces out. His biography is close to empty, as Walter has never actually done anything life changing. That is until one day Sean O'Connell, a photojournalist at life magazine produces negative 25, in which Walter cannot seem to find, but that captures the ""quintessence"" of Life and would be the perfect cover for the final cover.
Sean O'Connell gifts Walter with a wallet incorporated with Lifes motto hammered in the inside. When Walters new boss request the negative, it encourages Walter to find Sean and ask him where the negative was. This brings Walter in many situations like jumping out of a helicopter flown by a drunk pilot, almost being covered by an erupting volcano, and climbing the Himalayas.
 The original short story, by James Thurber, portrays the idea of Walter Mittys routine and uninteresting life interrupted by these crazy illusions he creates in his mind.  His dreams in this story include being a life saving surgeon, a pilot willing to sacrifice his life for his country, and a man walking in front of a firing squad.
I enjoyed the twist the movie put on the short story. I believe it shows how you never know where life is going to take you. It encourages the average cubicle worker to put ones self out there for adventure. It can change ones perspective on life and keep one from drifting off into Walters imagination land.  The short story is rather pessimistic and ends as it started, with Walter being unsatisfied with his life. The movie, however, ends rather happily, with Walter finding the negative of the photo, getting the girl, and participating in a pure bliss moment of observing a snow leopard with Sean OConnell.
Walter is such an ordinary man, but the movie depicts the change that occurs in him very well. Each time Walter is expected to leave his comfort zone and surprises those around him with each new adventure. His daydreams truly become reality. He really lives life during this small search for the negative, which is inspiring and creative. He turns into the action hero he strived to be.",1460592000,,2472,4.811764705882353
5802869,5,B00DHJT200,"Before seeing this movie, I highly recommend reading James Thurbers classic short story The Secret Life of Walter Mitty; it provides the viewer with a different perspective on the character of Walter. The movie, however, takes a classic story and turns it into something full of life.
Ben Stiller, in both his acting and directing was able to create a balance between Walter Mittys imagination and the real world. Embrace and accept every moment in the film to see its true beauty. Stillers ability to capture the meaning of Walters journey was critical; his goal was to find a lost negative, but it turned into something so much biggera journey to find himself.
The supporting actors, soundtrack, and filming locations all contributed to the success of this movie and the meaning behind journey. Kirsten Wiigs performance enhanced Stillers with a feeling of simplicity and ease that Wiig provides. The development of their relationship was fun to watch and the meaning behind simple interactions between the two was apparent.
The soundtrack gave the movie a playful undertone and made me want to download the album when I got home. The tunes were easy listening and light; none of the scenes were overruled by the music, but instead, complimented. The genre paired perfectly with the flow of the scenes. There was a good variety of music, from David Bowies classic Space Oddity to the modern Stay Alive by Jos Gonzlez.
As far as the locations go, they are arguably the most important part of the whole movie. The locations are what bring Mittys imaginations to life. Taking the adventures to remote places such as Greenland, to the beauty of Iceland give a fun contrast that make the movie interesting. The skateboarding scene was one of the most enjoyable for me to watchthe location combined with the music brought the scene to life and made me feel as though I was there. I could vividly picture the wind blowing through Walter Mittys hair.
Overall, I highly recommend this movie. I found it easy to watch with a captivating story line, as well as actors who did their roles justice in bringing a short story to life in film.",1460592000,,2129,4.835616438356165
5802870,5,B00DHJT200,"The story of The Secret Life of Walter Mitty has a very interesting story line. However, the movie executes this story line much better than the short story. In the short story Walter daydreams of wonderful scenarios in which he saves the day. His reality, unfortunately, lacks a certain Major Tom-esque bravery. The film, on the other hand, illustrates powerful character development. Maybe this is because Walter is unmarried, so he is able to get the girl as a victory,  or maybe because the film has a story line outside of incredible fantasies (his job and quest of getting image 25, perhaps). For these reasons, people are able to sympathize with Walter better. The movie could be better than the short story for the simple reason that it is easier to follow and has tremendous visuals throughout. Or maybe the film is superior because on a deeper level one admires Walters eventual discovery of self-worth, which everyone can hope to relate to.
 Yes: the short story was extremely imaginative and the base for the film. But it is undeniable that the film The Secret Life of Walter Mitty surpasses the short story in excellence. I personally think this is the result of the well-roundedness of the movie: an unappreciated protagonist, a demeaning superior, a personal hero, a love interest, a quest, a found sense of self, a family value, and a victory.
 If you are apprehensive about seeing the film after having read the story: don't be. If you are considering reading the story looking for the same excellence that was in the movie: dont.",1460592000,,1547,4.830188679245283
5802891,5,B00DHJT200,"Anyone who has read the short story by James Thurber should have been surprised when they encountered the movie version of The Secret Life of Walter Mitty. Basically, the movie and the original short story only share the name and a few personal features of the protagonist, Walter Mitty; for example, they both zone out frequently during daily life. The age and job of Walter, the setting, the story plot, and the resolution of the conflict were so different that people who had expected a true representation of short story to movie may have even been disappointed. However, compared to other movies that are inspired by novels or short stories, Ben Stillers work is a true creation from what one can get out of a short story.
 The original short story by James Thurber is rather narrow in perspective and more depressing than the movie. Walter Mitty, in Thurbers story, seems to be an old man whose wife and people around him see him as somewhat useless. It is evident that he does not enjoy his current life. He wants his life to be more spectacular such as being a commander during the war or professional surgeon. He wants to be someone who has power and authority, a man whom people all respect and follow. However, the reality is different, and his daydream never become reality. Since he is old and does not do anything to make his dream come true, it is hard to be inspired or get excited after reading the story. The story just ends with depression that his daydream stayed as daydream.
 On the other hand, the movie The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is very inspiring for many workers in these days who only daydreams their adventure and blindly follows their boring daily routine. Walter Mitty in the movie is a typical employee of Life magazine and has been working for it for many years without either change in position or promotion. He often zones out of reality and dreams about his adventure like saving a dog, fighting with his boss and departing towards the unknown adventure, but his dreams are just dreams and for that reason, he is not so attractive according to the online dating site. While Walter in the short story imagines his adventure, Walter in the movie unexpectedly departs on the adventure to find Sean OConnells quintessence of life, the photo has been decided to be the last cover of Life magazine but gone missing. On the way to find Sean, Walter encounters incredible adventures that he only imagined before, and finds himself enjoying the new experience rather than his normal boring life.
 The movie Secret Life of Walter Mitty is a bigger interpretation of the short story and provides the audience with bigger perspective and valuable life lessons. These days, there are a lot of movies that are based on short stories, novels or true stories, and most of them usually stick to the original plot in order to meet the expectation for the fans. However, Ben Stillers work is the true way to make a movie out of especially short stories because it is creation of new work not just movie version of the short story. Copying the story directly to the screen does not contain any improvements nor artistic value as a movie. In terms of interpreting the story and creating something new, Ben Stillers The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is a superb work and perfect example for excellent movies based on other stories.",1460592000,,3347,4.698466780238501

It captures all of the magic of great story telling beginning with an amazing screenplay, great performances, editing, sound track and directing. I highly recommend it. I don't think I ever laughed out loud, but it put a smile on my face in the opening moments and I never stopped smiling throughout the entire film. I love it when a seemingly silly premise can draw me into the life of the characters in such a way that I am effected emotionally by the end of their journey.

5802897,4,B00DHJT200,"i share many others' opinions of this fine Ben Stiller-directed fantasy. My literary self was shamefully struggling to remember that James Thurber wrote the original story (which I never read) but did remember the Danny Kaye film, and the delightful Warner Brothers cartoon based on Thurber's ""outline"". As is this beautiful essay on, well, the meaning of life. I hate the word ""tonal"" but this film is tonally perfect - strikes a note in the opening frame and maintains, expands upon, amplifies, and then returns to it in the close. The central plot element is a missing film negative (don't want to spoil it by explaining) but that negative becomes -- in a wonderfully post-modern way -- the absence that becomes a presence in the film. What is the picture of, taken by the elusive Sean O'Connell (an almost eerily quite/Zen Sean Penn) that O'Connell claims is the ""quintessence""? The answer invoves both Mitty's journey of self-exploration and the meta questions of the meaning and journey of Life itself. Photography and Score threaten to steal the show here, but the supporting cast is excellent all-around, including an hysterical Patton Oswalt as an eHarmony Tech Support rep. I love that ""Customers Also Watched"" films such as Stranger than Fiction, because I loved Mitty almost as much as Stranger (another excellent dramatic turn from a Comedic actor, Will Ferrell) and I loved Stranger very, very much. Great stuff.",1459641600,,1426,5.046610169491525

5803325,5,B00DHJT200,"I LOVE, LOVE this movie. I saw it many times. The beautiful music and breathtaking images of remote lands takes the audience  through the experiences of the main character transforming his fear into appreciation for life. It is  what many people feel in their lives: intense fear of trying new things and transform into happier human beings. I loved it the first time I saw it, and also the second time and the third and fourth.  It transports me to a dream like state which is to me what cinematography is all about. One of those movies that you can watch again and again. It is profound in its simplicity and like nature, it envelops you and returns you to wonder and inquiry. It makes you ponder, touches your heart and it fills your senses with beauty. That is to me what cinematography is about: a pleasurable audio-visual experience. At the movies, I like to be taken away from the harshness of the real world and this movie accomplishes that. I LOVE IT every time I watch it. I LOVE the music of Jose Gonzalez, a great musician, and the cast is perfect in a modest, subtle and believable way. Good acting, just good acting, without making a huge deal about it. Just good acting. Thank you to all the people involved in this movie, in front and behind the camera, short or long lines, main character or extras.

5803392,3,B00DHJT200,"This is a movie about a day dreamer that decides to take a chance and realizes that failure is better than stagnation. Though to take a chance and fail also means to take a chance and win since you can never win when you are not trying at all. There are some fun clever scenes about daydreams though there is no cue to let you know that are in one or out of one. This happens multiple times so when he does leave the nest and try and fly you are not sure that he won't wake up in the next moment.

Though the beginning is a bit slow for the set up, when the movie is rolling along it is more of a meander but it is worth sticking it out to the end if you have made it that far. Some of the scenes are really pretty and worth looking at, the film as a whole is enjoyable but I don't think I'd watch it again and it wouldn't be the first thing I would suggest someone to watch if they were looking for something.",1453248000,,910,3.8663101604278074

5803497,4,B00DHJT200,"There's a little Walter Mitty in each of us.  This film, while not perfect, flows well. Stiller is convincing as a middle aged everyman introvert confined to middle class decay. This is probably his best serious on-screen performance. Elements of the David Bowie song Major Tom are used as a Leitmotif, which eventually capitulates in the song being sung as he jumps into a helicopter and decides to embrace uncertainty. The scenery filmed in Iceland is particularly well done (this includes the areas that are supposedly in Greenland). There is a cheesy superhero sequence that seems out of place in the film that detracts from all of the other ""Walter Mittyisms"" that are otherwise well-received. The ending also has a little too much of the modern Hollywood treatment, but despite this, the film succeeds.",1451779200,,808,5.029850746268656
5803498,5,B00DHJT200,"This film was excellent.  The scenery was beautiful, the acting was genuine, and overall a great movie to watch with your family.  Inspiring without being an ""inspirational movie"".  Well, well done! :)",1451692800,,201,5.21875
5803499,5,B00DHJT200,"Having read the short story and seen the Danny Kaye version more years ago than I now care to remember, I was curious how things would come about this time around in the story of the man whose life in his imagination is much more dramatic than his actual one can ever be.

Since most of the tale takes place in Mitty's mind, it's always been a difficult one to dramatize, rather like Poe or Lovecraft...not that it's a horror story, but there's not much action in the real world.  This one takes a different route. Mitty has fantasies, yes, and they segue into his real life in such a way the viewer is tricked into believing them...momentarily. After the second time, whenever some overt action is performed, we know it's a day dream but enjoy it just the same.  When Life Magazine, where Mitty works, decides to go electronic and the cover picture is missing, Mitty takes on the task of tracking down the elusive photographer and find the negative. He does this without a second thought and doesn't seem to realize he's embarking on an adventure much greater and better than anything ever happening in his mind. He segues into it as easily as he does his imaginary adventures. With the song ""Rocket Man' as his mantra, showing how courage exists in all of us whether we realize it or not, and a customer service tech from an online dating service making up his profile as he continues his quest, Mitty realizes his dream of  adventure, is successful in his search, and comes home to find love waiting.

It may be less fantastic and comic in imaginary adventures than the other film but it's a fun story and an exciting one and its realism will make the viewer take it more to heart.

I lost my father but much later in life.  I used to daydream but much earlier in life.  This is about someone who puts aside his hopes and dreams to care for his family when his father dies.  His hopes and dreams are now mostly in his graphic daydreams.  His life has been put on hold.  It is sweet and funny and awakening.

5803624,5,B00DHJT200,"My husband and I saw the very end of this movie when it was being filmed live in NYC (we were passerby). We were excited to watch it and see what it looked like in the film, what the context of that scene was. Online reviews we read were disappointing, but we thought this movie was great. It was visually beautiful. The story kept us interested the entire time. Ben Stiller did a great job creating an interesting character - all of the cast members were played their parts well. We read the book as kids, and it was fun to watch the movie version of this imaginative story. It was worth the rental. Similar to Ben Stiller's other latest film, When We Were Young, this film makes a statement about the changing culture of technology and ethics. Mitty also reminds us that real life can better than daydreaming if you have courage and choose to be present.",1448236800,,856,4.424050632911392

5803665,5,B00DHJT200,Good movie,1447632000,,10,4.5
5803666,4,B00DHJT200,"Plot: Walter (Ben Stiller) works at Life Magazine in the 1990's, and he flirts with Meg (Kristen Wiig).  Walter imagines many adventures, and in the course of the movie he has one.  [imdb]  [photos]

Review: Walter Mitty is a fantasy set in New York city. It has fantasy parts are pretty cool. interweaved a rom-com style plot. As Walter grows he fantisizes less, and the move becomes an surreal adventure. I am a sucker for magic realism, so this was a good genre for me.

I liked Kristen Wiig here, she is pretty good when she is not do extreme characters as she did on Saturday Night Live. Ben Stiller was OK, because the character called for the nerdy cluelessness that he often plays. I am not a Ben Still fan generally, but this is one of his better efforts.

I saw this on TV about 2 years after it was in the theater. It is a good movie for home viewing because a lot of the action is mental.

The 1940's version promoted the trope of Walter as a tremendous exaggerator, and according to Wikipedia this entered pop culture at the time. In this version, the fantasies are in Walter's own head, and he is not a fabulist or big liar. Walter's issues are more mental than social, and there is a feeling that dreaming big is not necessarily bad.

Cast: Ben Stiller, Kristen Wiig

Directed by: Ben Stiller; based on the short story by James Thurber

The Music: A few good pop songs, including an A Cappella version of Space Oddity by Kristen Wiig.

The Visuals: Some nice visuals in Iceland. I liked the art direction of the Life Magazine offices with the large photos on the walls, and the photos being carried out at the end.

Rating: 2.5 stars: Entertaining and Interesting.",1447632000,,1679,4.468852459016394

The fantasy world in Walter's head is an entertaining escape from reality, and yet there is also a real-life, suspenseful plot that keeps you engaged and surprised as it unfolds.
Personally I also appreciated the lack of profanity and nudity.  It seems that many movies lacking a good plot or well-written script try to make up for it by filling in with filthy language and/or sex.  It's usually just annoying and ruins the opportunity to watch it with your kids.  Thanks to Ben Stiller this one has substance - no fillers needed!",1447027200,,746,4.496296296296296

On the other hand, it could have been filmed so differently, more fun, more awe or more laughter, or more fun, or.... somethings missing.  I think the movie stumbles from taking itself too seriously to lightness.  Midway through, I sat up and thought to myself ""I don't really care if this character finds what he is looking for, or not"".  The characters are not well developed, don't pull us in or make us care; at least that was my experience.  Yawn.",1446854400,,526,4.381443298969073

5804055,5,B00DHJT200,"As a family we love to see a movie on Christmas and on Christmas 2013 this was the movie. To be honest my kids haven't seen a lot of Ben Stiller other than the Museum movies. He tends toward the ridiculous and inappropriate. So when I saw that he was in a movie that was rated PG I though ""Hey, maybe it will be okay"". I was so wrong.

This move was way more than okay. It's a story of a man who has lived two lives. One is in his head where he dares to do the daring things. The other is his everyday life where he works a 9 to 5, helps support his mom and sister, and that's about all. He works at a famous magazine that's beginning to go the way of the card catalog. He wants to do things but he's so worried about staying safe. This movie spoke to me in so many ways. It's about breaking out and doing the hard things. It's about seeing things from a different perspective. It's an amazing movie!

We enjoyed it so much that we purchased a copy on Amazon Instant downloads the day it became available because my kids (12, 14 and 16) wanted to see it again. The only thing in this movie is there is a scene where sailors are racing for a bicycle to get to a strip club. Also, they mention teen pregnancy and sex in reference to a stage production of Grease.

Having seen the original movie The Secret Life of Walter Mitty starring Danny Kaye, I wasn't sure how this one would play out. But after seeing both I'd say they should be taken as completely different stories. Between the two I think this one is much better. Ben Stiller did an excellent job of directing and acting in this movie. If he does any more PG movies, we will be more than happy to check them out!

P.S. Awesome soundtrack!!!",1442188800,,1698,4.120845921450151

5804206,5,B00DHJT200,"You know I didn't catch this until May 2015 on an overseas flight. I immediately watched it again on the way back and then ordered the DVD upon getting home. First of all - I apologize to Ben Stiller for stupidly listening to the critics and not watching Mitty in a theater - it deserves a big screen viewing. Secondly it is a good movie (and I have written him a letter of apology). Stiller (no comedy here though there are comedic moments) plays a real guy facing real problems who daydreams about the ways he wishes he could solve those problems. The same thing we have all done and still do. Supporting cast is great. Cinematography is fantastic (thus the regret not seeing it on the big screen) Regarding ""bad guy"" Adam Scott - many years after completing The Picture of Dorian Gray, actor Hurd Hatfield regretted doing the part because he was so evil no one would give another decent part. Adam Scott does such a good job of playing a little snot nose punk here - I think that he needs to worry about his acting future.",1439769600,,1025,4.4

I wanted to watch it more but my wife started thinking I had gone crazy. So now I just watch it whenever she's out shopping :). This movie ropes you in and never lets go. It's fun. It's quirky.

5804487,5,B00DHJT200,I was floored by this film.  This is a late review but just wanted to add my voice.  This was such an adventure it made e want to have more adventure in my own life.  Ben was so in character with each zone out. An incredible talent is now emerging.  I look forward to more of this from him now.,1435622400,,294,3.85
5804488,1,B00DHJT200,"This is a movie about an extremely ordinary man who has constant daydreams to escape his boring and unhappy life.  So much could have been done with this story.  This man could have had so many interesting daydreams, funny ones and adventurous ones and deep ones, because daydreams can go wherever the imagination can go and anything and everything can happen.

This movie was so boring that I just couldn't believe it.  I kept pausing the movie, thinking about what I would have written instead.

You all should look up on Google ""Maladaptive Daydreaming"" which is what this movie hinted at but didn't risk.",1435622400,,608,4.8076923076923075

I started watching it while playing video games but it pulled me in. I ended up turning off the game and paying more attention to the movie. It's creative, and most of all, very emotional. And not a cheesy overdone kind of emotional either. It's very genuine and really forces you to feel it.

5804616,2,B00DHJT200,"I'm going to be the unpopular contrarian here.  The concept of living life fully --  somewhere between dreams and reality, and peppered with pretty footage -- has great potential, right?  ...But instead of the visually lush inspirational film they aspired toward, it fell short, with a campy, feel-goody, guy-gets-the-girl movie, with flat dialogue and a predictable ending.

The good:
There are definitely some ""eye dessert"" moments.  This movie had hints of Michel Gondry's Science of Sleep (amazing movie), and pleasant aesthetics / art direction at times (hints of Wes Anderson's dreamy color saturation and attention to detail), and could have been good.  I feel like attaching those directors names to this film might be overly complimentary, but there were definitely some pretty moments.

The bad:
- You are watching an ongoing commercial for e-Harmony and other brands.  I'm lookin' at you:  Cinnabon, McDonald's, and Papa John's.  Holy unabashed brand and product placement.  So tacky.  How are people overlooking this???
- Unbelievable scenarios compromised the plot (e.g., e-Harmony customer support calling its customers daily to give them moral support and harass them about their profiles, or coming to the airport to rescue you from the TSA -- really?), and lackluster dialogue (they had Kristin Wiig, who is an improv genius -- but instead of turning her loose, tethered her to a cliche role and blas script).

This film needed to go the full artsy, but it didn't take it here.  It lingered in Mediocre Land, at best.  Was glad when it was over.",1432425600,,1562,5.142857142857143

Go out and watch the youtube video Space Oddity (David Bowie + Kristen Wiig)."" What you see is a 5-star movie. But the bland sound track throughout this movie subtracts massively.

This movie has great acting, great cinematography, great directing and a great story. You can watch and enjoy that music video 10,000 times but the movie several.

It does jump the shark in the shark scene. But with a decent soundtrack, this scene would have been suspenseful without the out-of-place unneeded shark in Greenland waters.

Writers/ actors/directors/producers, watch this movie and learn-- with a decent soundtrack this movie Would Have Been Great. There are so many amazing scenes in this movie.

Based off the short story by James Thurber, I'd say it does justice! The story is simple, man has a dream of doing something great ... and thanks to the challenges of a missing photo -- he finds himself doing something great ... it's a fantastic adventure that will surely help motivate anybody!

That aside, the characters are believable, relatable, and sometimes painfully accurate. I found myself in Walters shoes moseying through life in a grey fog in the beginning ... and even felt my heart race a bit when things got exciting and he made a huge step in his life!

If you're on the fence, get this movie, I have spoken with a lot of people who haven't seen it, but when they have watched it, every single one loved it!",1431043200,,955,4.540697674418604

5804909,4,B00DHJT200,"This package includes both a Blu-Ray disc and a DVD disc. It ships in a standard Blu-Ray case. See note.

Note: My package arrived with the Blu-Ray disc dislodged from the support tabs and loose inside the case. This is common with any shipped optical media in the respective standard case (CD, DVD, and Blu-Ray). But, this makes them more highly susceptible to damage. Fortunately mine was not damaged and played okay. But, be warned and check out any optical media thoroughly as soon as it arrives. Many Amazon sellers provide only 14 days (I have seen only 7 days) to return items for any acceptable reason.

I knew this movie would be long. But, based on the previews, I expected it to be worth the extended duration. It was enjoyable, but a bit draggy. It would have been more enjoyable had it been edited down more closely to a standard 90-minute movie length. If you do decide to watch it, just know it does pick up some pace in the second half.

The story and acting were good (not great). The direction and production was good overall, but lacked in the otherwise spectacular and exotic cinematography. A better job of direction/production would have made more creative and interactive (and just plain ""more"") use of the great locations. One particularly memorable scene where this was excepted showed Walter Mitty (Ben Stiller) skateboarding at 50+ miles per hour down a long, winding road in Iceland into the blast zone of an erupting volcano. (Was that really Ben Stiller on the skateboard? It looked very convincing.) This fast moving scene is captivating and is a strong pivotal point for the main character. The strongest pivotal point for the main character was supposed to have been when Walter Mitty jumped onto a flying helicopter just after take-off. But, the distracting poor choices in camera coverage and cheesy illustrative content (Walter imagining his would-be girlfriend singing to him from the ground) caused this scene to fail in connecting with me.

Is it an awesome movie? No. But, it is definitely worth a watch to evaluate for yourself - even if you have to wait nearly 2 hours for it.",1427414400,2,2118,4.794520547945205

5804911,5,B00DHJT200,"This is a beautiful and sweet movie that I'd happily call a feel-good movie. I admit I do not always enjoy Ben Stiller himself, though I am a fan of much of his work- Meet The Parents, Zoolander, Mystery Men, Night At The Museum. I think I like a lot of his movies without really liking him all that much, if that makes sense. He can be annoyingly neurotic at times but here he plays it with a certain innocence and unintended humor that make him delightful. I was doubtful this movie would appeal to me since I'm fond of the character of Walter Mitty but couldn't picture Ben Stiller playing him. I loved the short story on which the movie is based but never saw the original Danny Kaye version. This adaptation, which Stiller also directed, is the story of a chronic day-dreamer who sets out on an incredible adventure while also pursuing love. There were times in the beginning of this movie that seemed silly, due to Mitty's wild imagination, but I stuck with it and it did not disappoint. This movie is so visually stunning with the beautiful settings (Iceland) and fabulous cinematography. The story is refreshing and fun with just the right amount of humor, great dialogue and appealing characters- nothing over the top. It is ""clean"" so it is kid as well as parent-friendly. Supporting cast includes Shirley Maclaine, Patton Oswalt, Kathryn Hahn and Sean Penn, all of whom are delightful. I recommend this movie for anyone who wants to be inspired by the delightful imagination of dreamers.",1427241600,,1498,4.699619771863118

And has a good fun cast that makes everyone smile, except Sean Penn.  He really pisses off those Republicans.  But then, Greedy men who want to rule the world hate James Bond.

While amusing in some parts, it stands on its own originality and is completely absorbing in design from the fruitful mind of Ben Stiller.

5804940,2,B00DHJT200,"Boy, I really have to object to the reviews that gave this 4 or 5 stars. I have to object to the reviews that gave this movie anything extreme, in fact. This movie fit so perfectly into the low average range for me that I thought everyone agreed. Let me get this out of the way by stating that there were a few moments in this movie that were actually top notch funny, and this would have been a 4 star movie if there were 5 or 6 moments like them. If the whole movie had been like them, it would have been a terrific movie. The scenes with the giant Greenland helicopter pilot were excellent, and as good as they needed to be. The scene where Walter Mitty meets him in the bar and the scene where Mitty jumps to the boat were witty and quite funny.

After hitting that peak though, the movie settles back down into boredom land. It hits this tone that just seems really anemic, like the cast is whistling and walking through it, and it has this weird low emo-energy that kind of puts you in the doldrums.  Stiller and Wiig seem like they don't care about the script. Stiller is really starting to strike me as a middle aged guy who would rather be at home working on his bike than making movies. It also kind of sucked the heart out of this movie that it turned into a running commercial for eHarmony and Papa John's. Do they expect us to believe that eHarmony is that cool? I appreciate Ben Stiller's entrepreneurial spirit, but it kind of drains this movie of heart. Ben Stiller acting casual could have worked as long as his dead pan expressions played off of hilarious events and made the jokes pop, but almost none of that happens in this movie. This movie is Ben Stiller running out of ideas. I have to say that I hate the emo-tone of this movie that has whistling music and a ""who cares?"" attitude. It seems like everyone in this movie is too cool to care or to try at all. I agree that Kristin Wiig looks her most beautiful and likable in this movie, but nothing really happens with her comedically or emotionally.

I've got to say that it does bother me that Hollywood liberals say so many bad things about ""big evil"" corporations and consumerism yet put all sorts of product placement in their movies. It is pretty annoying and frustrating that one thing comes out of their mouths and something entirely different happens when they vote with their feet.

In any event, this movie has a few high points of laughter, but mostly settles down into a very ho-hum tone that kind of sucks the energy out of the plot. The plot itself is very coherent and concise, and it s builds very nicely. The overall structure of the story is pretty strong, and that is one of the high points of this movie. Beyond that, this movie is kind of mediocre. I battled with myself over whether to give this 2 or 3 stars, and I might have given this 2.5 stars if that were possible. However, it definitely falls into mediocre, non-spectacular territory for sure.",1426809600,,2946,4.37043795620438

5805001,4,B00DHJT200,"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty
 The Secret Life of Walter Mitty-the movie-has only a passing similarity to the classic 1939 short story by James Thurber.  We find the daydreaming Mitty of the movie moved up a few decades to coincide with the demise of Life magazine, the American popular culture icon.  In this version Mitty works for Life as a custodian for film negatives.  The film has a more satisfying story arc than the original work.  The film Mitty has a fuller life story, one that I enjoyed.
 Ben Stiller stars and also directs.  This is Stillers fifth outing as a director.  He also managed Tropic Thunder and Zoolander, enjoyable films both.  He has made recent statements about his preference for directing over acting.  Perhaps this will be his last act as a performer.
 Kristen Wiig (Oscar winner for her script writing in Bridesmaids) plays the romantic interest.  The Mitty character is known for his drifting off into fantasy.  The biggest fantasy in this film is that Wiig would be interested in a relationship with the barely present Mitty in the first place.  Sean Penn has a small role as a famous photographer which he plays to a seldom seen level of perfection.  He also gets the best line in the film.  We also see Oscar winning actress Shirley MacLaine as the Mitty Mom.  She had her first movie role in 1955 which makes it 58 years on the silver screen for her.  The 79 year old is still busy with 15 roles in the 21st century, including a smashing performance in the Brit TV drama Downton Abbey.
 Much of the action takes place in Greenland and Iceland.  We are treated to truly lovely cinema-scapes of places we seldom see.  We call Stillers direction competent rather than dazzling but his acting is much above what we usually see from Stiller.  He directed from a script by Steve Conrad who also wrote the very well received Will Smith vehicle The Pursuit of Happiness.
 In 1947 another version of the Mitty tale appeared starring Danny Kaye.  Our version is billed as a comedy but I thought it more of a drama and the Danny Kaye version funnier.
 The Secret Life of Walter Mitty lasts one hour and 54 minutes.  With a budget of some $90 million and a thus far worldwide gross of $114 the film may struggle with profitability.  I hope this average three saw blade film finds an audience.  With a famous pedigree and two Oscar winners in the cast most people will want to see this pleasant, entertaining film.
 This film rates a very mild PG score, a pleasant and refreshing change from recent excesses.",1425772800,,2534,4.6062639821029085

I would have given 5 stars but the film seems to start off a bit on the slow side and doesn't find its feet until a quarter of the way through. This is a great re-imagining of the Thurber short story and new spin from the 1947 Danny Kaye classic. I was surprised by how much my 13-14 year old kids loved this film. It blends just the right amount of Walter's daydreams with his real life quest to have a more adventurous life. Solid acting all the way around except I felt the ""Corporate"" characters where too much of a SNL cliche of themselves. Superb visuals through the film mixed with interesting side characters that help build and encourage Walter on his journey. I give this a a 4 out of 5 for a Family Pizza night rating. It's a fun compelling story that starts a little slow but builds and finishes strong. Family friendly for 12 and up. Glad to see a PG film that is solid in the story department.",1424390400,,970,4.306010928961749

It's funny that's not on the level of crude or overly obscene. The story is simple like Walter Mitty's life and sincere in it's telling of his coming to terms with his inner adventurer.

This movie has a great supporting cast with Kristin Wigg and Sean Penn whom they make the movie equally worth watching as Stiller's character takes a romp through the unexpected beauty of Iceland and Greenland.",1424044800,,611,4.5963302752293576

I wondered how they would make a full-length movie out of the short story (even though there is an older movie of it). It is actually a very good movie. Yes, it has some exaggerations but that is ok, considering the story is about a man who daydreams all day long. The movie is funny, Stiller is great and funny as usual.

I've never cared for Ben Stiller's acting or dry, dull sense of humor. I can think of several actors who could've done a far better job. As for the movie, I couldn't get past the 30 minute mark before finally giving up and ejecting the disk. A movie really has to suck for me to do that.

5805357,1,B00DHJT200,"First of all, there already was a film titled ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" - released in 1947 starring Danny Kaye. It is a superior film in ever single capacity, as most originals tend to be. It is a rarity indeed to find a remake that matches or exceeds the original. That being said, why take the title of a film and then not truly ""remake"" it - are the people involved lazy or just simply too unimaginative to come up with anything original - even a title?",1422057600,2,464,4.224719101123595
5805358,5,B00DHJT200,"This was one of those movies that either infected you with it's FEVER or it missed you. If you were lucky and you caught it, it was a transformative magical ride through the looking glass....a Modern Wizard of Oz that was not entirely a dream. I saw this film, and went back and took my family to experience it, and it thrilled me yet again! From the daydreaming, to the  film's message of going for it and not sitting on the sidelines of your own life- to believing you CAN, I was inspired. I tried something I'd only talked about doing for years,and the wonderful helicopter sequence complete with Bowie soundtrack helped me make my own cosmic leap in my life. I'm so thankful I saw this film, it helped me tick something off my ""bucket list"" so I can get on with my new life.
The production value was outstanding-from the wonderful Offices at LIFE, the strange bar with Karaoke in Greenland,or the fountain outside the offices. I wanted to touch the pictures on the walls. The Cinematography was amazing- I was literally there exploring, skateboarding downhill, and hiking with sherpas! In the end, I even wanted to try the damn cake that his mother made him, this film made me laugh, gasp and wonder where I should  go explore next before my passport expires.

Ben Stiller is one funny and talented guy in other movies I've seen that he's acted in, but in this movie, not good. He didn't seem to be ""in character"" and definitely not the kind of film where you forgot you were watching a movie and got totally drawn into the the story. His acting seemed contrived and not in keeping with the kind of character that Walter Mitty is, for the most part.

I'm giving 2 instead of 1 star, for the gorgeous scenery shown in Greenland and some other shots. Other than that, this one is a snoozer.",1420848000,,624,4.3247863247863245

I had read this story back in high school and was familiar with the story. I thought the movie did a great job of making the story both compelling, entertaining, and relevant to our world today, while still being true to the concept/point of the original story. The casting was realistic and the cinematography and music was fantastic. I think the fantasizing he does in the movie is perfectly blended into the story. The only thing for me was the young boss who came in - I thought the character was a bit overdone (not as realistic as it could have been), but it was effective in some ways for the story's nature, so hard to say if I would have done it differently.

I am not one to re-watch a movie very soon after watching it, but I did with this one. A winner for me. One of my favorites in the past few years. More of this, please.",1420761600,,969,4.154255319148936

Not going into detail but read the other reviews (positive ones, not the negative few people by comparison who didn't like it)... I'm a huge James Thurber fan and that's what got me interested. It's definitely not James Thurber but still has his essence, his quirkiness, and elements of his personality incorporated in this film. We are coming here to buy the DVD, we liked it so much that we want to support it with our money:) Hope you enjoy it too but to each his own. Just know that this brought much happiness to us for 2 hours instead of the normal (now days) boredom and frustration we feel when watching so many movies. I don't know why we liked it and some people don't... just goes to show how different we all are, huh? I hope you enjoy it as much as all we 5 star reviewers did:)",1420156800,,855,4.283950617283951

5805591,5,B00DHJT200,"Tonally this is a sad film.  All the way through, even as Mitty discovers and lives life and becomes the dream instead of the dreamer, the expansive spacious places (even in the office building and among crowds of people) that he moves through feel empty and he seems so small.  The film, visually beautiful and often arresting, stresses within its color palette a lot of blues and silvers and interplays between stark blacks and whites.  This plays heavily into the films tone as well.  Ben Stiller plays Walter Mitty, a stifled (day)dreamer who sees lifes adventures through the camerawork of some of the worlds most famous photographers.  Mitty works for Life magazine and the story concerns itself with the publication of the last issue and the photo that is going to be placed on the cover.  Mitty has lost that photo and goes on a trek across the globe to talk to Sean OConnell (a subtle and off kiltered Sean Penn) who provided the prized picture and entrusted it to Walter.  Its quite an adventure and we root for Mitty who lives more in one week than he has in his whole life up until that point.  The film does not exposit his self-discovery through tracks of dialogue or even clearly characterize his awakenings; Mitty himself doesnt often seem to notice whats happening as he is too busy chasing down OConnell in order to get whats needed.  Its poignant in a very understated way.  The entire film, in fact, is understated.  Its a nice change of pace for Ben Stiller, and also for his love interest in the movie (Kristen Wiig showing a vulnerable side to her acting).

We may be underwhelmed (or say, I knew it!) when we finally learn what the lost photo is, but the film will leave you wanting more, and will linger in your mind like a surreal haunting.  It has a gentle charm that disarms in part because of the tonal sadness set against what your mind tells you is a life affirming film.  And so it is, and the secret is out.  4.5 stars.",1420156800,,1952,4.521367521367521

On my flight to Reykjavik, I saw this movie listed as one of the ones available to watch but I skipped over it as I was never a big Ben Stiller fan and didn't feel like watching a comedy.  What a mistake I made.

I've read the short story by James Thurber and, while this movie is based off it, the screenplay goes far beyond what the short story ever told.  The movie touches on the depth of relationships, of adventure, and what's truly important in life.

Ben Stiller and Kristen Wiig are outstanding and their performances couldn't be further than from what I expected.  I cannot recommend this movie enough.  I've already bought it once for myself and twice as gifts for others.  Inspiring, influential, incredible.",1419292800,,835,4.63265306122449

5805776,5,B00DHJT200,"Ben Stiller is the most underrated director out there (let alone actor). He's brought us Zoolander, Tropic Thunder and now Walter Mitty. If you haven't seen Mitty, do it. It's completely inspiring and makes you want to live life. Not very many movies can make that claim, but this one fulfills it totally. It's sort of funny (certainly not as much as Zoolander or TT), but it's the feeling you get from the film that makes it stand out above the pack. Just watch it! You'll be very glad you did. It's the only film of the decade not to miss.",1418428800,,541,4.366336633663367

Ben Stiller was great in it, the music was great, the scenes were awesome.  There were some slow times, but they were filled with music, which worked for me, but I think would probably bore some people.  They weren't long, though.  I think most people would not agree with a five star rating.  I love travel movies especially when they involve a bit of adventure and self discovery and that's what this movie delivers in a big way.  The fantasy scenes are well done and a lot of fun.  It makes a great date night video.",1417996800,,667,4.32258064516129
5805817,2,B00DHJT200,"This film starts out with a lot of promise: the first fantasy sequence on the subway platform, tied in with the eHarmony bit (this movie sure has a lot of blatant product placements) was great, as were Stiller & Wiig's initial performances. But then the hammer falls with the overcooked overacted clich scenes of office down-sizing, followed by some vague ill-defined vision quest after the nebulous Sean Penn character (a heroic photographer?) mixed in with nonsense about skateboarding (pandering to a very specific demographic I guess) & some kind of non-ending.

Biggest problem was the film-makers lost focus early on vis-a-vis what was fantasy & what was reality which is what The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is really about.

This made me think of a Tom Hanks & Meg Ryan movie that had the same theme but was a thousand times better: Joe versus the Volcano.",1417996800,3,864,4.870748299319728

5805928,4,B00DHJT200,"I really loved this movie.  As a teen I was a fan of the old Walter Mitty movie with Danny Kaye, and when this version came out I was looking forward to watching it.  Whether or not you've seen the old version - plan on being surprised at this new one. This movie was not what I expected. I was slightly concerned at the beginning that my family may be disappointed in it.  (I was the one that picked it out.)  It is styled very differently than typical movies and has an 'artsy' feel to it - but in the process you find yourself becoming immersed in the theme of the movie - that life is precious, and should be lived rather than dreamed.

My biggest concern about this movie is the PG rating.  My husband and I watched it with our 16 year old and our 12 year old - and thought ""I couldn't possibly have heard S**t, a**, J***s, d**k"" as well as a small handful of other swear words and innuendos as well as outright comments (horny chileans???)

With that being said - it's a great overall message for everyone, including older children.  Within a few minutes I was hooked - and I am planning on watching it again.",1417219200,2,1115,4.226415094339623

5805932,5,B00DHJT200,"I passed on this movie when it came out in theaters, mostly because of all the bad reviews I read.
Years passed, I'm on a cross country airplane ride, this movie is going to be shown on the plane. It was free and I was still hesitant about watching - but I did.

The first third of the movie was not bad. Not great mind you, but worth seeing if you're stuck on a plane with nothing else to do.

The second third really improved. I thought - wow this is a much better movie than I had expected. I should have seen this when it came out. In a really delightful way, many plot points were carefully set up in the first part in unexpected ways.

The last third moved this movie into my list of all time favorites. I remember at the time thinking ""this may be the best movie I have ever seen"". Then later thinking, well maybe, but it's probably just because it's so recent and you've watched your favorites so many times they have lost some luster.

I bought the movie from Amazon more than 6 months ago, and have watched it 4 more times. The fourth just the other night. My goodness - what a great movie! The best movie ever is still The Princess Bride, but The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is a really really close second.

Why is it so good?
1) A very high degree of polish in many areas (casting, music, cinematography (worth seeing just for the eye-candy scenery), editing, writing, directing)
2) Multifaceted message(s) about deep and important questions (subtly thought-provoking even after multiple viewings)
3) A wonderful balancing of the ludicrous things Walter does with the humble and realistic way Walter is played",1417046400,,1622,4.466216216216216

The character and plot development are well done, and by the end of the movie you think that you actually know each character.

5806036,4,B00DHJT200,"It baffles me that so many people so adamantly dislike this movie. If you are looking for an action, nope. If your looking for an edge-of-your-seat adventure.....also nope. That is not the point. The point is not to showcase some incredible, life-altering breakthrough and emotional revelation by the characters. The point is to show the ordinary-person adventure. To show that anyone can have an adventure if they put their mind to it, and that even the most bland and uninteresting among us have much to contribute and much that is unique. Fantastic cinematography, plus absolutely captivating musical score, makes this an overall wonderful movie, well-worth the time. But bear in mind, this is what I would refer to a a literary film. Its depth and beauty require you to pay attention, to immerse yourself in the story and the environment of the film. If you are impatient or looking for zone-out entertainment, this is not the film for you.

5806092,5,B00DHJT200,"I recall that in the 1950's our family subscribed to the nationally popular ""Life Magazine"".  I couldn't wait until the week's edition arrived in our mailbox in Drexel Hill, PA so that I could see the grand photos that described the world outside the neighborhood where we lived.  I was 10 or 12 at the time, and ""Life Magazine"" was the equivalent of today's vastly superior internet.  ""Life""'s idea was to tell major news stories thru spectacular black and white photos; it really was photo-journalism at its best.  At the time I think that Life Magazine was the most widely distributed and popular magazine news source in the US.  Sadly Life Magazine died in 1972 after nearly 100 years in existence.

The original ""Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" was a short story written by James Thurber in 1939 for the New Yorker.  It chronicled the sad life of a daydreaming office clerk who escapes his dreary life by fantasizing about various scenarios in which he becomes a hero.  In this most recent adaptation of Thurber's story for 'the big screen', the adapters embellish the original Thurber story rather dramatically.  Walter Mitty is a daydreaming file clerk at Life Magazine.  During his 16 years as the file clerk for Life Magazine's precious photos, he's never once lost a negative.  But just weeks before Life's final issue, Walter Mitty mysteriously loses the ""negative"" of the photo that is supposed to be on the front cover of Life Magazine's final issue.  To retrieve the photo negative, Walter Mitty embarks on a real life adventure that takes him from New York to Greenland, Iceland, the Himalayan mountains in Afghanistan and back to New York City.  He does this not to save his job or to save Life Magazine, but to win the love of the woman in his dreams ... another file clerk at the offices of Life Magazine. The film is a comedy and a great romantic story with spectacular scenic shots.  Stars include Ben Stiller, SNL's Kristen Wiig, Shirley MacLaine and Sean Penn.  But it's the seriousness of purpose that surprised me.  It's theme is Life Magazine's poetic motto:  ""To see the world, dangerous things to come; to see behind walls, draw closer; to find each other; and to feel.  That is the purpose of Life.""  Love is at the center. Very romantic.

I recommend it.  Though movie critics didn't shower it with praise, I think it's well-made and deserves much better.  A serious romantic comedy is not easy to pull off, but it certainly worked for me, and I think the critics simply missed the serious parts ... they just didn't get it.  Wouldn't be the first time.",1414886400,,2579,4.720357941834452

Unlike most movies that only showcase a scene that actually needs to be seen - this movie showcases way too many scenes. I usually enjoy a movie that has a never-ending plot (or a start back up feel). Definitely a very detail-filled movie.
However - the acting was brilliant. Whenever the plot points confused me the actors and landscape really drew me in. There are many things I wish that I could change about this film but the creativity that went in to this movie wouldn't be one of them.

5806148,5,B00DHJT200,I don't know if I can put my finger on just one thing that makes this movie so amazing.  There is something so enchanting about it.  Part of the magic is definitely in the music.  The story is inspiring and unfolds at a leisurely pace but it isn't slow.  It is perfect.  The story of a man with a mundane life who grows one step at a time until he is doing amazing things and fulfilling his dreams.  There is some humor - the part with the shark is hilarious (It's not a por-poise!) - but I don't think it is meant to be a comedy.  It's magical and I watched it through the first time completely enthralled.  I'm not a Ben Stiller fan but I took a chance on this after I heard from many people that it was a great movie.  I'm glad I did.  I have watched it again many times and never tire of it.  I highly recommend this movie.  I am going to buy the soundtrack as well because it really adds to the magic of the film and I think it would be inspiring to listen to in the car.

5806151,4,B00DHJT200,"It was high school since I last read James Thurber's THE SECRET LIFE OF WALTER MITTY, so it was fun to revisit literature's best daydreamer via Ben Stiller's offering.  My expectations pulling up a chair to watch this film were nada, so I came away most pleasantly surprised.  Stiller hasn't been in anything memorable recently, but here he's captivating and charming as Walter Mitty, a soft-spoken darkroom developer for the soon-to-be-defunct 'Life' magazine.  Walter goes about his tedious job quietly, harboring a considerable crush for a co-worker (Kristen Wiig) whom he is too shy to approach. . .but does he ever daydream about her.  (By far my favorite fantasy involved a spoof on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Benjamin-Button/dp/B00AEFXQ5C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Benjamin Button</a>.)  Vagabond global journalist/photographer Sean O'Connell (Sean Penn) has sent Walter some negatives to develop; in particular, Sean instructs Life management to be sure to use Negative 25 for the cover of the magazine's final issue.  Trouble is, Walter can't find it anywhere, and as he knows his days of employment are numbered, he embarks on a spontaneous trip looking for the elusive reporter that takes him on adventures beyond his wildest fantasies--from Greenland, to Iceland, to the snowcapped Himalayas.  The story then neatly ties up a handful of subplots, with the finding of Negative 25 the ultimate payoff.  Again, this is one charming film.

Stiller is stellar here (sorry, couldn't resist); he plays the introverted Walter with ""Aw, shucks"" aplomb.  The years of chain smoking and living on the edge have taken their toll on Penn, yet Shirley MacLaine seems ageless as Walter's somewhat overbearing mother.  Walter's nemesis is new boss Ted, played by Adam Scott.  Scott's performance?  He should stick to making vodka commercials.  Finally, I thoroughly enjoyed an actor by the name of Olafur Darri Olafsson, playing a drunken Greenlander helicopter pilot, a pilot who sends Walter directly into the icy waters of the North Atlantic.  Yet Stiller is the ultimate prize with this film, as both actor and director, and many of the vistas as Walter goes on his journey are literally stunning and breathtaking.  THE SECRET LIFE OF WALTER MITTY is a definite feel good movie, a film daring you not to be charmed.  When's the next Air Greenland flight?

I read reviews here and was saddened by the one star reviews, most of which contained little substance in the sentence or two people strained themselves to write. Then I realized that the common thread of these reviews was that people felt nothing happened and it was boring.
How sad for these folks that they missed so much. A whole lot happens in this film. Wonderful things, sweet things, exciting things and thoughtful things, but apparently if a movie doesn't contain big breasts, explosions, sex and death every two minutes it is termed ""boring.""
This is a movie that is very enjoyable to watch without knowing the details and having events unfold for you at the same time it does for the characters. This movie takes you on a journey with Walter Mitty, who escapes his quiet, uneventful life by daydreaming about incredible experiences. A turn of events involving a missing photograph is the catalyst for him to get motivated to go on a real journey that involves experiences he never imagined he would have, and meet people that are unexpected and wonderful in so many different ways. Add to that unrequited love (with Kristen Wiig playing a charming co-worker) and a game changing scene that uses David Bowie's song Major Tom in an incredibly meaningful way, and you have a film that is a joy to watch and go along for the ride.",1412035200,,1398,4.641129032258065

5806373,5,B00DHJT200,"I'll be honest, I had low expectations going into this film. I hadn't heard great things about it and the reviews from the critics were mixed, at best. That being said, I am blown away by how much I enjoyed The Secret Life of Walter Mitty. I was apprehensive at first, as the opening 20-30 minutes is the weakest part of the film. There were a few of Walter's ""imagination"" scenes that didn't really work for me but then the film really takes off when Walter stops imagining things and starts making his own adventures.

Ben Stiller did a wonderful job directing and acting in the film, with this being maybe his finest performance yet. The supporting actors and actresses were great as well. Kristin Wiig plays a cute and extremely likable love interest. Sean Penn delivers the standout performance of the film and others such as Patton Oswalt, Shirley McClane, and Adam Scott provide great supporting roles that were both funny and heart-warming. Perhaps what I like best about the film is its soundtrack. From David Bowie to Of Monster and Men, Walter Mitty delivers in its ability to connect you to the experience via music.

Don't believe the critics on this one, you definitely do not want to miss The Secret Life of Walter Mitty.",1411603200,,1236,4.691244239631336

Walter Mitty is no different, except that he's a little more conservative in his desires for his future, though his daydreams are excellent alter-egos. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is definitely inspiring, breathtaking, and adventurous (just like Life and Nat Geo), you'll miss out if you don't watch it.

It starts out all right, updating the old Thurber story and definitely improving on the Danny Kaye vehicle. But not long into it that all drops away and we're into an entirely different movie, with lots of spectacular footage of Iceland and the Himalayas and such, a kind of middle-aged coming-of-age story in which Walter makes a big life transition from imaginary hero to real-life one, as a lot of wimpy emo songs by Arcade Fire and bands that sound like them go on too long and too loud behind him. Telling movie-goers to get out and actually live their lives instead of... well, watching movies is kind of ironic, though not a bad message for today's Twitter-addicted world.

It's very unlikely that a kid would actually trade a longboard for a stretch armstrong doll... Seriously, was that believable for a second?  That a kid that age would trade a longboard for a DOLL?

Oh, and by the way... You can't just run around Iceland as fast as possible - through the mountains - without any water to drink.

Also, no, you can't outdrive a volcano eruption, and no, you wouldn't survive if you were that close to an eruption...

The slow movement from imagination to reality and the overlapping of these concepts is well developed  both being valid. also the transition from old tech to new tech is explored in this movie  you will yearn for 35 MM film. There are some ""office Space"" moments looking at the absurdity or management's re-structuring of  a company.  But this movie excels with exploring sentimentality.

Ben Stiller's sort of hip downtrodden-guy humor seems a bit ill-fitting in this broad sweeping-themed fable, but not enough to hurt the film. Another actor might have brought much more heft and impact, is all.  The overall experience is rewarding and entertaining, both.",1410307200,,377,5.25

5806751,5,B00DHJT200,"I have not read the short story or seen the original film with Danny Kaye. Also I was somewhat put off by the somewhat negative reviews that were about of this film and I have not liked much of Ben Stiller's previous material.
However I saw and liked the shorts of this so I bought it on Blu-ray.
I am really glad that I did.  This is a great film.  It is absolutely gorgeously filmed, has some amazing locations and has a very complimentary sound track.
The characters are likeable and the character of Walter is well developed through the film.  I liked Ben Stiller as Walter very much and the female lead fit really well with the Walter in this film.
It has a whimsical character which seems to fit very well with the underlining story.
I can see that this might not be a favourite film for some (if they are to stuck to the short story or original film etc) but I am afraid that I find it extremely hard to understand any of the 1 or 2 stars reviews.  I read quite a few of them but I have no idea what they were watching.

I feel that this movie is his best to date, featuring a story that is hilarious (it had me laughing aloud several times), heartwarming, and with a meaningful message. Although Stiller more or less seems like the same guy in all his movies, the range that is present among his weird titles, such as Tropic Thunder, Zoolander, and Walter Mitty is just amazing. I would wholeheartedly recommend this movie to anybody, even if they have been turned off by some of Stiller's other movies. This one is his best, and it will make you think about the important things in life, without being preachy or over sentimental. It's just a marvelous movie!",1409097600,,714,4.6299212598425195

There were a few moments where I wasn't sure if the movie was going to end soon, then find out there's still more going on... but other than that I loved watching the main character, Walter, grow and take risks. The other thing, is I wish I knew a little more about his crazy family than what you see. I felt like there was so much more to how his character became to be and it just scratched lightly on the topic of his family life... leaving me to know them more.

 The soundtrack in this is amazing. Towards the end of the film you go from feeling sorry for Walter to being happy for him and even though the turnout is more realistic than other movies, you won't feel disappointed for him.

At least see it once! And then buy the soundtrack. So good.",1408924800,,880,4.104651162790698

Transitions leave you confused in some places, as to whether you are in Walter's reality or actual reality. Producer Ben Stiller needed a stronger script for this one!

Bored weekend, looking for something ""new"" on Amazon Prime - and there was ""MITTY""...

Family sitting in the living room on a weekend.  After a long week.  Everybody tired and grumpy.

""Mitty"" was the least-objectionable thing we found on Amazon.  (Kiddos rooting for war flicks and robots and big booms, wife hoping for a chick flick.  Me just trying to unwind.  Executive Decision - we will watch ""Mitty""...)

Some grumbling - but the movie had us all entranced from the very beginning.

Simple plot ""boy loves girl - secretly"" then ""boy goes on adventure to impress girl"".

But excellent photography, beautiful scenery, had to be some GreenScreen work in there - but it looked good.

Family happy afterward - all enjoyed it.

Its funny (very), poignant, and has a plot that weaves a wonderful tale that leaves you breathless.  The casting is perfect and a cameo by Sean Penn is brilliant.  I've seen this movie twice now and enjoyed it just as much the second time.  If you can, see this movie with a youngster - the movie is for all ages but early teens is probably the best.

Have always liked Ben Stiller, thought him funny.  Here he has stepped away from his usual comedic role and shows his serious acting side.  Producer, director, leading actor,he has his fingerprints all over this movie. If this is any indication of what Ben Stiller can do as an artist, not just as a comedian, we should see some thoughtful and serious cinema going forward... I hope so.",1406937600,,536,4.383838383838384

And it's hard to find a beautiful movie these days.
This one is pleasant too because it doesn't have the ever-unnecessary language they like
to slam in there to make movies realistic. But it's not realistic that all people curse when upset. It's a stupid movie trend, just like the sex on the spot type trend in moves too. This one is different. It's pleasant and has GORGEOUS nature cinematography. It's a balanced movie with not too much time on the romance story and not too much on the adventure part. The realism is artfully placed in between. I think this movie is genius.",1406937600,,605,4.559633027522936

5807505,5,B00DHJT200,"I am an author - and yet I can't seem to come up with the right words to describe the marvelousness of this film. Ben Stiller must have a very deep soul, and in this movie, it feels as if he set out with the goal of reaching for others with that same depth of spirit. If you love this movie, it's because you FEEL it, in some indescribable place that warms you from the inside out. The score and soundtrack are unbelievable, and the way Stiller has tied them in with the movie is beyond adept; it's perfect. This is the first movie in two decades for which I have longed for a hard copy. Recently, I had an accident and suffered a spinal injury leaving my right leg more or less useless and leaving me in vast amounts of pain. My husband rushed out, purchased The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, and set it up beside my bed. I opened my eyes and watched. Then I stood with them in that decision-making and life-changing moment in Nuuk while Major Tom played in my head... I felt the wind on my face while Walter faced that Iceland hill in his very special, very wonderful way. I transcended my pain to join the characters in a dream brought to life, one so much better and so much more fulfilling than anything Walter Mitty, the king of imagination, could have imagined himself. This movie is resplendent. I have seen it sixteen times. I will treasure it in the years to come. Thank you, Ben, for sharing with us your soul.",1406937600,6,1420,4.282527881040892

Ben Stiller and cast were all well placed, great pacing and placement of comedy so it did not slip into corny or too preachy. Loved how it did a great comparison between adventure ""big A"" and obvious (mountain climbing and jumping into the ocean) and the more subtle and I think the film argues more difficult and risky territory of family life, relationships, children, work, and finding meaning in it all. I loved the message to stay in the moment, Shawn Penn was really moving in the mountain lion scene. I would recommend, if you can manage to quiet your inner sarcastic modern voice and enjoy the ride of this beautifully shot film, FYI, Greenland/Iceland are on the bucket list of must see places after this film, stunning!!",1406851200,,822,4.675862068965517

5807764,1,B00DHJT200,"Considering the limitless potential of this movie... wow, is this bad. With the myriad and mystifying ways it misses in thrilling, entertaining and touching the viewer, its failures are borderline offensive in their stupidity and inefficiency. This is basically ""Hallmark Card: the movie,"" as it features that same level of humor, wit and emotion of a bad poem on a get-well card.

For anyone who's familiar with Ben Stiller's oeuvre, they know that while he is capable of dizzying highs with his direction (Zoolander,) he can also be incredibly silly and stupid (the worst of ""The Ben Stiller Show""... and Zoolander.) Unfortunately, this film is one of those failures.

The movie's biggest problem is its cloying attempts to move the viewer. With relentless syrupy bathos, the viewer is first bombarded with scene after scene of the protagonist's woefully pathetic life and Stiller's aw-shucks poodle-face. Then in the second half, the film is a constant montage of the hero gleefully so alive! in a beautiful travelogue of foreign locales set to the newest, uplifting power-folk ballads.

Is the movie nice to look at? Sure. Is it smart, insightful or funny? No. Are its attempts to touch you desperate and ad nauseum? Definitely.

What's also odd is how this movie is a remake of a comedy classic, yet borrows so little from the original. The first Danny Kaye film from the what, 40s?, was a zany screwball comedy, where the hero constantly daydreams his boring office job into exciting pulp adventures. This film takes a horribly dumb McGuffin of a plot (with an anger-inducing payoff after an entire two hours' tease of the great reveal,) and the few dream sequences here are flat and uninspired. I don't know if the hero even has any of his delusions in the final hour of the film, when that's the fun gimmick that made the original. The blueprint for this film was a hot property for decades, as I remember Jim Carrey supposed starring in this in the 90s. So in the infinite worlds where an infinite versions of this remake exist, Stiller's is definitely towards the bottom of the pile for simply missing the entire point of this movie.

The product placement is egregious. The main plot involves redeeming Life Magazine. The subplot is about the hero's eHarmony account. There's more too peppered throughout, but the characters spend the whole movie literally touting these brands as they're integral to the story.

The ""Benjamin Button"" scene in this film is so bad and dumb, it would still be horrific to see as an outtake from ""Scary Movie 8."" A nonsensical parody of a little-seen 6-year-old movie? In the past day since seeing ""Mitty,"" I honestly cannot think of a more out-of-place and insipid scene in all of cinema. Congratulations on making the worst scene ever.

5808000,4,B00DHJT200,"THE SECRET LIFE OF WALTER MITTY was one of many films that I was unable to see in theaters in 2013, and I was more than little worried given the rather lukewarm critical reception that it received. Thankfully, now having seen it, those fears have been assuaged. This film, while still a little overly earnest, is heartfelt and has a good message. And outside of the NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM movies, it's also one of the few films Ben Stiller has done that's appropriate for families. The story is about Walter Mitty who, in this film version, works for Life Magazine as a negative asset manager. Basically, he keeps track of all of the photographs that come in. As the magazine is in transition to becoming online only, a famous photographer Sean O'Connell (Sean Penn) sends in a roll for use in the final print issue. In particular, one negative (#25) is to be used as the cover. However, it's missing and Walter has to track it down and find it. This serves as the springboard for Walter, a rather insular fellow who tends to zone out and daydream, to get out and make something of his life. One thing I really liked about this movie was the way in which it seamlessly blended Walter's fantasies with the real world. They offered insight into an otherwise closed-off personality (at least in the beginning), and were realized visually in a very cool way. I also enjoyed the overall visual aesthetic of the film, which had lots of wintry blues, grays and whites. The characters were satisfactorily drawn, although none of them were terribly deep, save Walter. I thought Kristin Wiig gave a nice performance, but her character was never really given much to do other than be the object of Walter's affections. On the downside, for all of the buildup to a few things which I won't spoil here, the end result is a bit underwhelming. Still, the journey to the end (and to the discoveries found there) is an interesting one. This movie turned out to be much better than I expected. It's a fun film that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. Highly recommended.",1405728000,2,2051,4.591280653950954

I thought it was very well written and wonderfully directed & shot by Ben Stiller. I prefer his films where he directs himself; he has a much more nuanced way of presenting his unique physical and emotional comedy as well as pathos. Total thumbs up for this story.

I suppose the movie stands out in that it was one of the most unsatisfying movies I've ever seen.  The plot truly makes no sense, and not in a way that challenges thinking.  It simply was a cobbled together mess where the beginning, the end and the middle were interchangeable.
I know nothing of movie development, financing, production and distribution.  But I must ask:  how does a movie, based on a beloved story and with an arguably good cast, get produced when apparently no one read the screenplay??",1405641600,,592,4.70873786407767

5808066,5,B00DHJT200,"Witty, fanciful, and tasteful. The story moves at an engaging pace, slowing down only long enough to let the beauty of specific scenes wash over you before moving on to the next development. Well acted, well shot, and hosting a music score appropriate to both the overall mood of the film as well as to the mutating emotions of the characters, in my opinion it unquestionably earns the right to its 'fade to white' credits.",1405555200,,423,4.653333333333333

The movie is happy, refreshingly original, and funny!  One of Ben Stiller's best performances (an actor I'm usually luke warm on), you can't help but to smile and laugh through most of the movie.

5808315,3,B00DHJT200,"There is a lot to like about THE SECRET LIFE OF WALTER MITTY and yet the film ends up a major disappointment.  Who can't related to a lonely and frustrated day-dreamer longing for love and success? Ben Stiller's heart was in the right place when making this film but his film falls so far from its potential. Ben Stiller, Kristin Wiig (who has never looked lovelier), Shirley MacLaine, Adam Scott (in an annoyingy fkae beard) and Sean Penn give us their best but nothing can save a film that is short on story and enthusiasm.
Walter Mitty (Ben Stiller) is in charge of photographic negatives in this digital age. He works for LIFE magazine, which about to publish it issue (which, of course, happened years ago). Mitty's life suddenly takes him around the world in search of a photographer  Sean O'Connell (Sean Penn) and a missing negative whose picture will be on the final cover of LIFE. Along the way, Walter is infatuated with a coworker Cherly (Kristin Wiig) who he tries to connect with on eHarmony. MITTY does seem to turn into a filmed commercial for eHarmony, Papa John's Pizza, Cinnabon and others. The advertising connection seems over the top at times and the film becomes a running commercial for several products.
There is some stunning photography in THE SECRET LIFE OF WALTER MITTY and it helps overcome the shortcomings in the story. Walter ends up in Iceland, Greenland, the Himalayas and Afghanistan. I checked the credits and filming was done in Iceland and British Columbia so it appears the crew did at least go to ICELAND and the setting is just gorgeous. We get to see Ben Stiller show some moves on a skateboard (with the daring moves being done by a stunt skateboarder). Another plus is seeing Kristin Wiig in a serious role. No slapstick comedy..just a sweet lady trying to survive in a tough world and find happiness.
Stiller has made a career of playing the lovable loser with a gentle heart. His Walter Mitty is no different.  Stiller's eyes light up the screen as does Kristin Wiig's beauty. Sadly, there is just so much lacking in this film as we struggle to care about the story and the people.",1405209600,4,2128,4.684491978609626

5808401,5,B00DHJT200,"Ben Stiller directed this?  I was wondering who was behind the helm, admiring the storytelling and attention to detail.  It might seem a bit self indulgent, but the end result was a tremendous visual tour-de-force with a heart.  Ben Stiller plays his usual loser role - when does he never play a loser right? - but gives himself permission to take it a different route.  It's kinda like Forrest Gump with cooler visual fx and a great soundtrack.  I'm not a reviewer that likes to regurgitate the story lines, so in short - this is a movie about LIFE...and living.  One of the more satisfying movies I've watched in a while.  Let's hope Ben does another one.  Go Ben Go!",1405036800,,669,4.516666666666667

I am giving this movie 5 stars because it beat the storyline of the book. In the book it is very different and random with no plot.

This movie has a simple plot and a basic reason for all this adventure. A lot of things happen for no reason. Even though they are fun to watch, I ended up asking myself... why? I would recommend that the main character gets placed on medications immediately because of the danger he is to himself and to everyone around him.

I saw this movie in Africa with my daughter, her husband and my twins, age 16, and we all loved it. The message is about living your dream and not fearing life and appreciating the little things and valuing art and doing your work because it's the right thing to do. This is a fabulous family movie but it does not have to be. I've shown this to my 11 year old when it came out on DVD and I've shown it to my friends who have not seen it and I love it each time more and differently and I cry each time at the end. LIFE magazine was my favorite and this movie marks the end of that era. I love Ben Stiller (though never been a big fan, he's so serious in this) and Kristen Wiig (again, a surprise serious role) and Sean Penn, the ever present artist is the one who appreciates the artistry of someone who is under-appreciated. I was so disappointed that it did not get any Academy Award nominations. Wow, they all went to August/Osage County and Her and (yawn) Gravity. Seriously, makes me question the Academy.

5808811,5,B00DHJT200,"In his famous short story, ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty,"" James Thurber created the ultimate Caspar Milquetoast.  Mitty's daydreams in which he imagined himself the dashing hero provided his only escape from his drab, uneventful life and endless browbeating by his domineering spouse.

Fine on the page, but not exactly the stuff of riveting cinema.  The Hollywood solution?  Enter Ben Stiller as the latest big screen incarnation of dull Walter.

He's the chief negative editor for LIFE, the world's most famous photojournalism magazine, in the heart of bustling Manhattan.

Boring.

He's charged with producing the final cover of the print edition before the periodical goes exclusively on-line.

Tedious, for sure.

He loses the money shot, just as the corporate big wigs who have taken over the publication are screaming for the negative.

Yawn.

So, with the missing photo as the MacGuffin, Walter sets off alone to the earth's rugged places to track down the elusive, Galen Rowell-type adventure photographer Sean O'Connell, who took the picture.

I mean, were it not for the free company coffee, I don't how this guy manages to stay awake through the workday.

Obviously, director Stiller and his screenwriters jettisoned most everything from Thurber's quirky, off-beat, slightly unhinged story but the title and the notion of a chronic daydreamer.  While Walter's fantasies were the entire point of the short story, the fantasy sequences in the movie are its weakest part, perhaps because the whole, charming film is so daffy.  With such an intriguing life, it's not clear why Walter needs to fantasize to such an extreme degree.  He virtually blacks out at times, which, we learn from his mother near the end of the movie, is not his salvation but nearly his downfall--just the opposite of Thurber's character in the written story.

One fantasy sequence in the film--a superheroes-style battle between Walter and his antagonistic boss--seems nothing more than an attempt to bring in the comic book crowd.  When Walter sets off in pursuit of the missing photo, his coworker Cheryl (likeable Kristen Wiig), for whom he has romantic longings, remains ever-available not only in his fantasies but on his cell phone (even on top of a mountain in Afghanistan, where rock-solid Afghani infrastructure guarantees crystal-clear reception ).  The worst fantasy sequence, in which Walter imagines himself as an old man dying in elderly Cheryl's arms, is just stupid and repulsive.

Like James Thurber's famous character, this film is a wanna be.  It wants to be a typical Hollywood rom-com, with a dash of action-adventure flick, but its true heart keeps peeping through.  This film is an ontological reflection.

A what?

It's about being--being true to yourself, being the real you, letting your light shine.

Which is not to say it is Deep and Serious.  Hardly.  It's a goofy mess of a movie, but the care it takes with its layered details, implausible as the action may be, is one of its pleasures.  The travelogue is breathtaking as Walter pursues O'Connell, (nicely underplayed by Sean Penn) from the sub-Arctic to the Middle East.  The characters, as opposed to Thurber's cartoons, are fleshed out and believable.  The set-up may be Hollywood crazy, but the emotions are real, as deftly played by Stiller, Wiig, Penn, and Shirley MacLaine as Walter's alert and caring mother.  Stiller has made a career of passive characters.  He does not so much act as react to others in a scene, which makes him perfect to play the always accommodating Walter, a perpetual spectator (hence his photo editor job) .

This tender-hearted movie's frequent pauses and hesitations are what gives it weight.  The filmmakers tip their hat as to their real concerns in the crucial scene where Walter at last catches up with O'Connell.  It is their first face-to-face meeting, but their relationship is already profound because Walter has been receiving dispatches from his star photographic contributor and turning them into magic on the magazine's pages for 16 years.  The depth of the emotions in the wonderfully subdued scene reminded me, wild as the stretch might seem, of the explosion of unstated feeling that occurs when Rick and Ilsa first see each other once again in CASABLANCA.  When O'Connell observes (referring to the snow leopard in his lens), ""Beautiful things don't ask for attention,"" he sums up the theme of the film--Walter's own underappreciated beauty, especially of himself.

The plot is unpredictable, careening all over the place, the storytelling is often inventive, the dialogue rich, the acting first-rate, the scenery superb, and there are some laughs and some throat-catching moments along the way.  The brilliant ending is an emotional wallop.  So don't worry too much about the ontological meaning of it all.  As you'll see in the fine and touching finale, THE SECRET LIFE OF WALTER MITTY is a great date movie.  It may leave you with an afterglow about how good it feels to be you.",1404086400,,5000,5.092137592137592
5808812,5,B00DHJT200,"Who is Walter Mitty? As the movie begins, Mitty represents what everyone is afraid we all are: insignificant cogs in the institutions of power, beat upon by bullies,  out of it, no one cares -- did I say weak?

The movie opens with Mr. Mitty grimly working over a check register of all his expenses: the material world, the balancing of accounts, perhaps fear of not having enough, fear of death.

He's in crisis:  his mom is getting older and needs to sell her piano in order to move into a retirement apartment.  It's time to weigh his values and worth, as he's having a birthday and getting older himself. And he clearly believes that he comes up short.

To put it boldly in Christian terms: he's stuck under the dispensation of law -- no fun.

His sister Odessa (female name for Odysseus, the archetypal pilgrim) a free spirit of yoga, ""tough but tender"" actress, who makes little if any money gives him their Mom's/Shirley McClaine's cake and his childhood stretchy-muscle-man and cries out for help fighting for the piano.

Muscle-man is a symbol of a resurrected Christ, the God-man, the finding of strength out of weakness, being able to do the impossible when all looks completely lost.

Mitty -- true to his name -- attempts to retreat away from heroism and family into his job.  He looks pathetic and weak as he carries his cake and muscle doll around at work.  But ""Life"" magazine, where he works, is no longer a haven; Life has become a place of death; it's going digital-- lay-offs and violent unkind change everywhere.

In the elevator Mitty seems ashamed to admit to the new boss/""transitions manager"" at Life magazine that he's a ""negative assets manager.""  Since we don't know exactly what he does yet, ""a negative-assets manager"" hints at something heavy and bleak perhaps even related to the dark legerdemain of the financial crisis.

A symbolic or spiritual reading would associate ""negative assets manager"" with some kind of legal or moral management of sin; a reading amplified when Mitty later argues  upon being fired that this is the first time he has ever done anything wrong, ever lost a ""negative.""  This is someone who is playing it very safe.

""Put that on your desk plaque at your next job"" is the response of the boss.  Even Mitty's supposed sinlessness finally counts for nothing, and cannot fulfill ""Life's"" higher call and purpose.  Only God can fulfill the law and bring life out of death.  But where is God in this mess?

The new transition manager/boss devil and other playful demons tease him for being out of it and call him Major Tom: ""Ground Control to Major Tom!"" from the David Bowie song ""Space Oddity"":  -- Mitty is a spacy spirit oddity. But as we'll see later, God's grace is using both his enemy's words and Mitty's imagination to guide and help him, if he has eyes to see.

When Mitty and his friend and helper enter their dark but private, happily self-ruled domain of the basement, it becomes clear he's a meticulous keeper of Life's archives of file ""negatives"" in the basement.  He freaks out when he sees that negative # 25 is missing, ""the quintessence negative"" that represents all the work of ""Life.""  This is to be the final cover so must be found, such is his work-ethic.

When they suddenly begin reading the film negatives as clues/symbols, anyone with any knowledge of the hero's journey, get's it; we are in the land of myth and must see beyond the everyday world.  Where, oh where is God leading?

The trinity of clues:  the big ugly ringed thumb of a drunk, the waters of death/baptism, and his mother's piano.

Film negatives are the dark reversed image before film is develop.  Mitty's ""career"" is imaginatively loaded.  But he himself has lived only with the negative images and has not developed himself.

However, he knows how to find himself: He must meet and take on the Father hero of his life.  He thought his 16-year relationship as dependable point man for Shawn McConnell -- creative genius of Time/Life (a symbol of God the Father and Creator) -- would guarantee his worth and value at Life, but it doesn't seem to be enough.

Mitty realizes the only way is to seek the Father-figure in his own milieu out there-- nature, the whole world, the inscrutable unknown, all of it -- He must leave New York city!

In a hell-hole of a bar in Greenland, (a la Joseph Campbell's book A Hero with a Thousand Faces) Mitty must go over the threshold into a new life past a scary temple guard-- a drunk helicopter pilot.  The thumb-ring identifies him against all reason as God's means of grace.

Mitty is beckoned on into this new life not just by God but by a spirit mate/love interest he's trying to develop through eHarmony, an online dating service, even though Cheryl happens to actually work in his building.  Cheryl becomes a guide and powerful spiritual presence for him when she tells him his taunt ""Major Tom"" and the song ""Space/spirit Oddity"" can be embraced as honorable and heroic.

Cheryl appears to sing the faith of ""Major Tom"" straight into Mitty's heart when he needs it most.  ""And I think my spaceship knows which way to go.....""

Against his will and reason he finds himself running and leaping into the helicopter as it lifts off.  Not his will, but God's will triumphs.  Mitty is in shock, the thrilling leap of faith utterly takes his breathe away -- and mine. (My favorite scene.) In utter desperation, with the help of his love and guide Cheryl and by embracing ""Major Tom"" as his new identity, he makes his choice to risk all.

The modern world of technology is amazing but so weak and vulnerable:  ""For here am I sitting in a tin can.  Far above the world.  Planet Earth is blue, and there is nothing I can do.""  Ultimately we are all Augustinians,  living in Pelagian worlds, i.e. experiencing choice as significant.  In the leap scene, these two Christian views are reconciled, yet forever paradoxical.

Mom's cake wraped in ""Dad's"" ""Word(s)"" later becomes a communion -- after his baptism in the ocean.  Mitty recognizes Sean O'Connell's mystical words as the clues to life but does not understand them.  He cannot understand until he through faith continues the journey.  (Understanding comes through living and loving in faith.)

Mitty takes muscle-man with him on his hero's journey.  He later has to trade him for transportation -- the skate board.  This points to the essential condition of all seekers  We are pilgrims on this earth, always in route. The journey demands we give up everything in order to move closer to our destiny: God.

Mitty no longer needs muscle-man because he has integrated the resurrected Christ into himself: he is now living the Christ life; He get's it: through weakness he found the door that brought him to it's opposite: the resurrected Christ within!  The skateboard represents the freedom and joy of life free from his old beliefs and old self-- no longer under the tyranny of law.

By utterly committing himself to the journey, the living law grows in his heart; he is not fighting for himself anymore or to save his job. (He becomes even more committed to the journey after being fired.)

The calls from e-Harmony as he travels are reminders of the law (success and it's demands to accomplish).  But now he is not burdened by law/works but realizes law as integral to the thrilling and joyful life that he owns as his calling.

Mitty now journeys to fulfill the law written on the soft flesh of his heart:  image #25, the lost ""image"" (as the negatives are called), the mysterious image that is sought like the Holy Chalice by our hero is the image of God and must be found and brought to Life.

When Mitty finally stumbles upon the Father at the top of the Himalayas, he is ""working.""  His is enjoying the snow leopard, called a ghost leopard because he doesn't like to be seen, another image for God.  Photos are not being ""taken"" because experiencing stillness and beauty are more important than capturing them.

The Father-figure tells Mitty that he --Mitty-- already has the image.  It is in the wallet he gave him. Mitty challenges the Father's wisdom in ""playfully"" putting his image into a wallet!  They wrestle a bit, you might say.  And Father-God agrees.  Mitty doesn't know how to explain to the Father why he threw away his gift -- that he was totally disillusioned with his work at ""Life"" as represented by the wallet.  That he could not see his life as he had lived it as a gift.

The Father-figure will not answer Mitty's inquiry about the identity of image #25. The symbol of the wallet forces Mitty back toward his old life, back down to Earth.  He must come full circle, but now will see his life with new eyes and a new heart.  The Father leads him to join the circle of the world community represented by a fun and glorious ball game as the sun sets.

The movie is an archetypal journey to wholeness.  Mitty goes to meet his maker and comes back with the boon, something not just for himself but to show to the whole world from the cover of ""Life"":  God's image restored through Christ.

He has found wholeness and meaning in his life that cannot be taken from him by circumstance.  He knows his ""Life"" time was not in vain.  He matters.  And so becomes a Christ picture, an embodiment, a prototype --  a quintessence available to all who experience themselves as nobodies without the spirit and meaning of Christ.",1404086400,,9375,4.6611822059719685

Stiller tries to make the protagonist a real life action hero, and in doing so, completely misses the universal attraction of the short story, a mundane world made more livable by flights of purely imaginary fancy. This movie takes all of the trite plot turns of movies such as ""You've Got Mail,"" ""Romancing the Stone"" and ""Lost in Translation,"" and leaves the audience wondering ""Why do I care about any of these characters?""

Although not a remake in so many ways, Ben Stiller's Walter was truly made with a lot of heart.  With the amazing soundtrack, picturesque landscapes, and a few humorous situations (that made me roar with laughter) these amazing actors/crew/writer delivered a well developed story of a man living only a half life that decides to grab life and become the man he is meant to be.",1403481600,,526,4.574468085106383

There were many laugh out loud moments.  Even though the story line and situations got a bit corny, the reactions still held some surprise and unpredictability.  Especially liked Walter's die-hard contact at EHarmony, that was hysterical.  Acting was great, all characters were done very well.",1403481600,,459,5.2465753424657535

5809081,5,B00DHJT200,"First this IS a comedy.  But, with Ben Stiller as both director and lead actor, it is a refined
comedy, perhaps too refined for most peoples' tastes these days, who only think a movie
is a comedy if it involves copious amounts of gas, fluid or other things  coming from various
bodily orifices at the worst possible times.  No, this movie rarely goes for such simple
laughs.  But if you appreciate understated humor, it is hilarious.  I laughed at least once
until the tears were rolling down my cheeks.
But at the same time, it is also a stunningly beautiful film (physically--the locations), a bit
of an action movie, and actually a good character study.  Because it's such a mixed
genre, it makes it difficult to properly promote this film.  I watched the Blu-Ray version
without having seen it in theatre or on TV, and I totally loved it.  Watch this movie and
APPRECIATE IT, dammit!  It's darn near perfectly done.",1403395200,,919,4.658385093167702

5809083,4,B00DHJT200,"Possible spoilers ahead.

Even for a movie loving person, choices must be made each year as to which of the 500 or so released in the U. S. should be seen.  New release choices are further complicated by numerous ""foreign"" films that never make it here and the countless tens of thousands in movie archives.  I took a pass on this remake of the 1947 film starring Danny Kaye.  It finally came time to catch up with it on Blu ray and I was pleasantly surprised that I found it better than I expected.

Ben Stiller stars (and also directed) as Walter Mitty.  In this version of James Thurber's short story, Mitty is a basement dweller working for ""Life"" magazine.  Specifically he handles the negatives of shot film before inclusion in the magazine.  Walter is a mild-mannered man who is prone to elaborate daydreams where he briefly escapes to a fantasy world where he sees himself as somewhat of a hero who stands up for what is right.  His sister (Kathryn Hahn) just says he's zoning out.  Walter has his romantic sights set on Cheryl (Kristen Wiig), a newly hired co-worker.  But Walter, lacking in confidence, struggles to ask her out.

Walter's world is disrupted when ""Life"" announces it will become a web-based magazine only and will be shutting down traditional print publications.  The ""transition"" manager, Ted (Adam Scott) is an arrogant, bearded jerk as are the two ass-kissers who assist him.  ""Life's"" final cover page is to feature a photo taken by Sean O'Connell (Sean Penn), a world famous photographer.  The specific photo has been sent to Walter along with several others.  But the specific photo #25 is missing.

Walter's search for the photo go beyond fantasy and he sets out to find the photographer.  This leads him on an unlikely journey to Greenland and ultimately Iceland where he finally locates O'Connell.  Sean tells Walter that he had it all along.  I won't spoil the location or the shot itself but it contains the proper payoff.  Some of the adventurism of Walter is a bit hard to buy given his milquetoast personality but you just have to go with it.  The photography of the North Atlantic countries is beautiful and Stiller's direction is solid.  Wiig takes a supportive role and creates a character who is sweet and honest.  While this may not be one of the great films, it is certainly worthy of a look.

The Blu ray transfer is quite good, no make that excellent.  It has a 1080p video resolution and uses a 2.40:1 aspect ratio so bars at the top and bottom of most screens is normal.  The picture and especially the colors are striking.  The ever present blue skies and dark blue ocean provide a respectful re-creation of cinematographer Stuart Dryburgh's work.  The audio is something very special.  The package comes with a DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 track which provides an enthralling audio experience.  It does an equally good job replicating the office environment where Walter works and really shines in those thunderous scenes where Walter is airlifted onto a freighter in the middle of the ocean.  Then there are the panoramic shots high in the Himalayas where it is mystically quiet but for the sound of a few animals and guides playing soccer in the distance.  There are numerous 5.1 options available in other languages as well.  Subtitle options are numerous.  Here is a list: English SDH, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Portuguese (Brazil), Russian, Arabic, Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Estonian, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Icelandic, Latvian, Lithuanian, Chinese, Polish, Romanian, Serbian, Slovenian, Turkish, and Ukranian.

5809084,4,B00DHJT200,"An excellent Stiller performance. This is a good movie with a lot of imagination, literally on Walter Mitty's part. This film is put together and excecuted perfectly.",1403395200,,166,5.185185185185185
5809115,3,B00DHJT200,"Thurber's short story stood out as a personal favorite in my 7th grade literature textbook, probably because I was at an age where 'pretending' and playing with dolls was frowned upon but my imagination was still producing copious amounts of material with no outlet.  I can't explain where this film went wrong.  My husband was bored off the sofa and out of the room in the first half hour.  I was sufficiently captivated by the gorgeous imagery and special effects to stick it out to the end.  Maybe the short story would have been better handled in one short film or a series of short films...but then there's no more audience for short films than there is for short stories these days.  Ben Stiller's Walter is forgettable as ever; the most memorable moment belongs to the asphalt in the skateboarding scene.",1403395200,,811,4.723404255319149

I don't want free music to stream, I want to pay 79$ for prime! I thought 79$ was too much! Amazon is has turned into walmart.  Anyone remember when super walmart first came out it was so clean and the people who worked there so educated and friendly?  Remember when they had a three customers in a line a new cash register will be opened policy?  Remember when walmart used to stock their shelves in the middle of the night instead of during the busiest time of the day?  Remember when made in America was their slogan?  Now that they drove all the mom and pop stores out of business look at walmart.  The stores are filthy, a lot of the people who work their look and act like they just got out of prison, the isles are always crammed with huge pallets to be stocked during the busiest times, and everything is Chinese.  Also, the prices aren't any better than anyone else.  Walmart is a bully.  Amazon has gotten a little too big for it's britches and is getting just like walmart.  I find the prices better elsewhere and that makes up more than enough for shipping.  Plus, most online vendors give free shipping over 50$ anyway.  Good luck Amazon!

5809124,5,B00DHJT200,This movie is beautifully filmed but just lovable and I'm not fond of Ben Stiller. I loved this movie.

5809155,4,B00DHJT200,"The cinematography and soundtrack of this movie make it very good. The frame tends to be very well composed and quite epic. The story becomes slow at some points, but the tone of the film makes it hard not to like watching.",1403222400,,223,4.333333333333333
5809156,1,B00DHJT200,"I'm not sure why people rated this film so highly. I wonder if they just have low expectation of ""same old boring"" Ben Stiller, the ""odd man out"" in every one of his films. He plays the same stupid role in every movie from Meet The Parents to Night At The Museum to this ""work of art.""

The film began somewhat hopefully. Walter wants to meet a co-worker on a dating site but his account doesn't seem to be cooperating so he calls tech support. The  man on the other end isn't really interested in helping Walter; he just wants him to completely fill out his sparse dating profile. Walter begins to fantasize about saving said co-worker's dog from a burning building.

From there on, Walter keeps imagining dull fantasy scenarios to escape abusive bosses, boring life events, and so on. There are hints once upon a time Walter was ""cool"" and into the whole mohawk  haircut/skateboarding scene but you'd never know from his current life (or escapist thoughts).

After an hour of Walter going in search of a lost ""negative"" for the final issue of his company's magazine, I had enough and had to leave the room. My husband and I both agreed this was a terrible movie and we don't care what happens in the end. Our 16 year old is still in there hanging in with it.

Don't waste your time. Every character in this movie is unlikable or annoying or just boring. I can't recommend it at all.",1403222400,2,1384,4.472222222222222
5809157,1,B00DHJT200,"Tom Hanks can play Everyman, sometimes Bruce Willis can, but not Ben Stiller. He's more like Boringman...or maybe Emptyshirtman. I had hopes when Shirley MacClain showed up, but even she couldn't energize this lifeless snory. The only interesting character was the helicopter pilot and he had to work by himself without any reaction or interaction from the headliner. Why the Mitty character's love interest maintained communications with this nonentity is unfathomable. I cannot stand Sean Penn for his personal politics, but I confess, I was embarrassed he was involved in such a crappy project. The great James Thurber deserved better than this uninspired mess. I would recommend it as a quick cure for insomnia though.",1403222400,,722,5.28695652173913

The first half hour was such agony, that I had to skip through to the end... and every time I resumed watching, the segment seemed even more boring than the next. I mean, they even managed to make Iceland boring! No spoiler here, but one premise is Walter has to go on a kind of world-wide scavenger hunt to find the final Life cover picture. Must admit, the ending was one jaw-dropping, unexpected, surprise: Whodathunk that this finale would be just as boring as the rest of the picture?. And, lest you think I'm a troll-- the group I watched with found it equally groan-worthy and kept saying ""Skip... Fast forward... Skip... Fast forward... Oh, just go to the 'effin end!"" I didn't find the Walter at the end of the film that much more enlightened that the Walter at the beginning. At least with Thurber's conclusion, Mitty isn't somebody who thinks his imaginativeness is something that  needs to be fixed. He refuses to be enlightened but instead remains true to himself, co-opting his self-destruction and turning into self-affirmation.",1402790400,,1099,4.7539267015706805

It just lacked a little something and it was the same thing over and over and over.  Walter daydreams.  Walter is bullied.  Walter finally becomes someone to watch when he gets a backbone.

I didn't leave this movie with anything memorable.  Some movies are just for entertainment, and that's ok.  One thing that did disappoint me was the fact that the word d*** just HAD to be inserted in there somewhere.  I guess ""jerk"" is not strong enough to convey the point, which actually conveys that movie makers seem to have this notion that they cannot make a point without some sort of shock value.

And why everyone is worried about offending everyone but Christians is the kicker.  The use of Jesus' name as an expletive couldn't be left out either.  There were no other punchy words that could have been used instead.  I love old movies.  The classics have become such because they told a story and they didn't need anything gratuitous to do so.",1402790400,,1102,4.517766497461929

There are some holes that I am still not sure how to fill, such as why/how did the photographer meet Stiller's character's mom ... a confusion to me. There were other parts that were inexplicable, but very enjoyable to watch such as the soccer game near the end.

5809408,5,B00DHJT200,"There are not many movies that I wanted to watch again the next day. This is one of them.
There are not many movies that I want to purchase. This is one of them.

This movie was breath-taking on my new Sony 65"" 4k TV. Breath-taking. Stiller as director showed not only his talent for acting (this was his best so far), but his genius for landscape, framing, and color. Yes, the outdoor shots were incredible! Gorgeous and beautiful. But even a city shot with apartments was artistic. The inside of a bar in a far and lonely place. Stiller's director's eye was genius.

I loved the story. I loved how it was fairy tale, yet realistic, yet finding the balance between the two and not going over the top within either to produce a very entertaining story. The acting was excellent and understated for all the main characters and supporting actors. Yes, that was Shirley MacLain on the screen, but it was really Walter's mother. Yes, that was Sean Penn on the screen but that was really Sean Conner, the photographer.

One of those rare clean movies that are entertaining. Why can't Hollywood produce more like this?",1402531200,,1112,4.606060606060606

So I was initially upset that it might not be included, but when I opened up the box, one of the 3 discs was the CD soundtrack for the movie.

This movie is on my Top Ten movies I have ever enjoyed (along with Blade Runner, Amelie, When Harry Met Sally, Brazil, The Shawshank Redemption, Sleeper, and Good Will Hunting, to name a few).  It touched me deeply which was a real surprise when I rented it since I saw the movie trailer before and it really didn't do the movie justice.

Hats off to Ben Stiller for directing a legitimately good movie. Much better than the sophomoric humor of Cable Guy and less heavy handed than Reality Bites.  It works on many levels.

5809439,4,B00DHJT200,"The ability here to only present full stars left me choosing four. While this movie isn't in the category of ""one of the best I've ever seen,"" it's near that.
As Ben Stiller movies go, this is probably as serious as he'll ever get, nonetheless he can make me laugh with a look or a gesture, and that puts him in an elite group of my favorite comedians. You would think that matching him up with another one of my favorites i.e., Kristen Wiig would create a fireball of hilarity that would bust your gut, but as a team they reach for something higher here, and they get it. The ever illusive ""Sean O'Connell,"" that Sean Penn plays enhances his image as a ""guru,"" personality he has become in some of his more recent films, as opposed to the ""Jeff Spicoli"" character that many of us remember.
This film captures the snickers and smirks of everyday life, but it also captures the ""big picture,"" and the struggles that we face as a people here in America. The loss of jobs, the quest for adventure and love, as well as the pursuit of contentment and happiness. It aptly shows the impediments as well as the avenues to obtaining those things as well.
While this plot deals with a real life closure of a company, namely, Life Magazine, you only need a minimal amount of background info to realize that this account is highly fictionalized. Yet, at this point most of us in America of a certain age have worked for companies that are now closed; and in many cases those same companies had been around for many previous generations; this film captures the essence and the realities and emotions that run through those closures.
All of that having been said ... maybe I should have given it five stars :)",1402444800,,1695,4.488673139158576

5809441,5,B00DHJT200,"Beautiful, comedic, inspired, adventurous, insightful and heartfelt, these are just a few of the adjectives that well describe Ben Stiller's  remake of The Secret Life of Walter Mitty. It is honestly one of Ben Stiller's best outings as an actor and probably the best film he's ever directed. One of the most interesting aspects about this movie is simply that you do not know what to expect next.

The film is very well rounded and has a general appeal to all who would watch. Many may claim that the film is boring or too slow, unfortunately for them, they just aren't watching close enough. The movie is about Life, literally. The movie is about Life magazine and a 16 year tenured employee who has yet to do much with his. Something that you might not expect from a movie like this is the incredible cinematography (perfectly accented by the blu-ray release). There is much more to Walter Mitty than meets the eye and thats how the movie is too.

5809465,5,B00DHJT200,"I had in mind a slight recollection of Danny Kaye playing Walter Mitty and having watched that movie when I was younger.  I didn't remember much about it other than that Danny Kaye was a day-dreamer.  Well, anyway, this was a great movie with some beautiful scenes in it.  We have an HD TV and it was great in HD.  I have to admit, my family was a little gun-shy about watching something with Sean Penn in it (he's not even listed in the credits I've just reviewed).  He has what I'd call an extended cameo roll in the film and it was just fine.

I'm smiling as I think about Mitty's daydreamed (zoned out) moments and now I get the trailer and nod affirmatively as I recall the hi-jinx of Danny Kaye in his roll as Mitty.  It's a solidly ""cute"" movie, in my opinion.  We all thoroughly enjoyed it, from 36-75 years of us liked it very much.  I wouldn't mind watching it again.

Despite the wild fantasies and the beautiful cinematography, the movie felt slow.  I have read the short story, and the movie is a complete rework and departure from the original.  The audience at our house consisted of three adults and two preteen girls.  The girls one after the other decided to go to bed rather than finish the movie, and both men fell asleep watching the movie.

This movie works ok as a romantic type comedy that Stiller works well in but at times the movie kind of meanders along very predictably and has that clich predictable type happy ending.

5809685,5,B00DHJT200,"If you're expecting your typical Ben Stiller hilarity, you'll be disappointed.  If you're looking for mindless entertainment, you'll be disappointed.  If you want a fast-paced thrill ride, most of this movie won't give you that (but some of its moments will). This is a meaningful, mindful film.  Don't just sit there and watch.  Be engaged in it.  Be willing to look for the truth in it.  I would compare the thoughtful nature of this film to the emotional rewards of watching It's Wonderful Life.  Go with Walter from his hum-drum life into a world he never expected to see.  Apply his journey to LIFE.  If you do that, you will get so much out of this movie.

I've never been a huge Ben Stiller fan.  I really like the Night at the Museum movies, but this goes beyond humor.  Ben Stiller as an actor captures who Walter is and who he becomes.  There are definitely funny moments, but they are subtle.  There are ample life-affirming moments for those who are open to seeing them.  I have new respect for Ben Stiller after seeing this movie.

Visually, this is a stunning film.  My husband and I were fortunate to see it in the theater, and it was mesmerizing.  The music is also beautiful and very fitting from beginning to end.  If you want a life-affirming, thoughtful movie experience, this is it.  But you have to let it in.",1401840000,6,1331,4.5358649789029535

The film departs from the plot of the original Thurber short story but one soon gets caught up in the plot.  The characters are real, humorous and relatable to a lot of people we know.  My kids enjoy the movie at a different level to the adults but loved it so much that we purchased the film after renting it twice!  The scenery is amazing especially on a big screen.

I was afraid that it might be cheesy or too slow, and that his daydreams would be confusing...but instead I was entranced by this story. It flowed well, and it was like a good book that you can't put down, you just have to see what happens next. This is one of those movies that makes you look at life differently, and inspires you to jump into life head first.
I would highly recommend this film, and I know I will be watching it again and again.",1401840000,,531,4.373737373737374
5809716,3,B00DHJT200,"This movie had a LOT of promise. The idea of a guy with no life breaking out and going rogue and finally living... there was so much they could have done. But most of the movie was B - O - R - I - N - G. I found myself feeling a bit ripped off: not because of the money I spent on the rental, but because of the time I wasted where I could have been watching something else.

Don't get me wrong - it wasn't exactly terrible. That's why I gave it 3 stars. But it does fall into the category that I have come to believe a lot of ""art"" falls into. It's a bucket mediocre nonsense that everybody thinks is great only because they think everybody else thinks it's great. Andy Warhol is a perfect example. You have the rich jet setters from New York all hyping up this guy and he became very famous on some extremely sad, mediocre crap. Hey, if the anointed ones say it's art, then it's art, right? I went to the Warhol exhibit in St. Pete FL and when I left the gallery my first thought was - based on that I should be a billionaire.

But there are some good scenes and funny scenes, and well sorry for the spoiler but in the end he gets the girl.

I'm really surprised this movie wasn't a whole lot better, especially since I really like Ben Stiller a lot and enjoy almost all of his work.

I gave it 3 stars instead of two because the directing was great, the special FX were great, the editing and overall production quality was great, and the acting was superb. The story was just not great.

Life Magazines Walter Mitty works with photo negatives at a time when everything is going digital. He lives beyond his humdrum cubicle walls through a series of elaborate daydreams. When redundancy looms, his existence becomes more fantastic than he ever could have imagined.

What did I think?

Stillers Mitty is a photo negative in a world of iPads; struggling for relevance but full of potential beauty in and of itself.

5809889,5,B00DHJT200,"I'll admit, I was prejudiced going in. I love Ben Stiller. I truly enjoy his movies. He's really able to laugh at himself, and gets others to laugh at themselves too, including those who always seem to take themselves a wee bit too seriously!

This movie was a bit different. Walter Mitty, while very shy around the women he fancies and immensely awkward with his co-workers, is extremely competent at his job, managing his mother's affairs, and skateboarding, of all things. The laughs are still there, but Stiller really instilled his character with a sense of sweetness that hasn't been a big part of his thigh-slapping comedy offerings.

I really connected with his zoning out at work. I often find myself wondering if people would still act the way they did if they could only see themselves, and realize what complete twits they are? I get cranky with the world and people, because they're just such idiots - Walter just...goes somewhere else for a while. The things that go on in his head are hilarious. No one understands, of course, but I found myself empathizing completely.

You learn during the movie that there is a life event that has caused his odd behavior, but Walter is never a jerk, never pitiable and even when he's at his most awkward socially, you see him interacting normally with his subordinate at work, as well as his family so you know he's capable. The joy of this movie is seeing him coming wholly to life again, so to speak.

Dare to dream, trust your instincts, do the best you can and be proud of what you do  Ben Stillers performance as to how Walter realizes all this, his posture, his facial expressions allow the audience to feel what Walter feels and how he sets himself free in the end.

5809997,4,B00DHJT200,"Anyone expecting Ben Stiller to recycle the two principal intertexts for this story - the James Thurber story or the classic Danny Kaye comedy from 1947 - is likely to be highly disappointed.  Superficially the plot remains the same, with Stiller playing a put-upon employee of LIFE magazine who is bullied by the new boss Ted Hendricks (Adam Scott), but eventually discovers himself as a result of a once-in-a-lifetime trip to find elusive photographer Sean O'Connell (Sean Penn), who possesses an elusive negative needed for the final print copy of the magazine.  Needless to say everything ends happily, with Mitty discovering to his delight that the photograph celebrates the work of all LIFE's employees - journalists, printers, editors, photo-staff - who made the magazine such an American institution.  He also manages to convince the love of his life, Cheryl Melhoff (Kirsten Wiig) of the sincerity of his intentions.  At heart, however, WALTER MITTY is a story of the importance of discovering yourself, even if the odds seem stacked against you.  Walter learns to follow his inclinations, and by doing so fulfills his mother Edna's (Shirley MacLaine's) aspirations for him.  Stiller gives a delightful performance, his character gradually changing from one of wide-eyed stoicism (which provokes him to daydream) into a person of quiet strength, who is not frightened of confronting Hendricks and telling the boss exactly what he thinks.  At another level WALTER MITTY can be seen as an elegy for LIFE magazine, that bastion of American journalism, which has now become an online-only journal due to falling sales and changing reader preferences.  The film uses archive material to show how it chronicled all the major events and personalities of the twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, and how its staff (for the most part) were dedicated to their work.  It's the kind of magazine that doesn't deserve to be taken over by superficial ignoramuses such as Hendricks, whose principal concern is for profitability rather than journalistic integrity.",1401235200,2,2063,5.284403669724771

I am not even sure too many people still read Thurber but it's so much better than seeing a re-mail of some movie from the 80s. This is not a re-make of the film starring Danny Kaye, but a complete modern take on the Thurber story. It has depth, nuance, laughs and maybe even some tears. Stiller is mighty both on screen and behind the camera. The other players are wonderful (especially Adam Scott as a total corporate takeover prick). A fine, fine bit of filmaking.",1401062400,,581,4.290909090909091

I don't even have time to write a long review, but I will say that it felt good to watch this movie from the beginning to the end...How many films can you say that about these days?",1400976000,,357,4.264705882352941
5810137,4,B00DHJT200,"Secret Life of Walter Mitty

  Walter Mitty is, according to IMDB, ""A day-dreamer (who) escapes his anonymous life by disappearing into a world of fantasies filled with heroism, romance and action. When his job is threatened, he takes action in the real world embarking on a global journey that turns into an adventure more extraordinary than anything he could have ever imagined.""  From the first frame to the rolling credits this film is a visual masterpiece.  But I didn't expect it to resonate so personally with me.  Ben Stiller, Kristin Wiig, Sean Penn, Shirley Maclaine and a cast of literally thousands, 15,000 to be precise, create the world in which Walter Mitty, Negative Asset Manager for Life Magazine, lives and we get to be the audience.

  His inner world is much more interesting than his real life.  It's the last days of Life Magazine as it transitions from print Goliath to online David.  He manages to embody all of our collective regrets and insecurities in one sweet package.  Of course it's also a love story.  Aren't all the best movies about love at some level?  The musical direction is as superb as the visual direction and he has chosen to make sure transitional scenes are from a point of view invisible to the actors and visible only to us and it works nicely to move the forward story and to add grace notes and punctuation to the unfolding drama.  Life is either something that happens to you or is something you make happen.  And it is Life Magazine's motto that guides our story.  That motto was ""To see the world, things dangerous to come to, to see behind walls, draw closer, to find each other, and to feel. That is the purpose of life.""

  The corporate bearded grim reaper has just told everyone it's their last issue and the famous recluse photographer, Sean O'Connell, has sent the negative that will be the issue's last cover shot.  Walter has received the film but negative 25, the cover shot, is missing.  His abusive childlike gleeful grave digging new manager plays the role of ""rubber"" of I'm rubber your glue fame.  At its heart it's a movie about Life that's about life but it's disguised as a Mcguffin type film wherein the object of the protagonist's search, negative 25, is in none of the places the film takes us.  As with Dorothy, of Oz, it was always not just at home but within him the whole time to make the magic real.

  This film resonated with me because my Dad was Sean O'Connell, the wise man whose camera provides a view of the world that can only comes through the lens of that camera by virtue of what the photographer sees and how he sees it.  Photographers are the men and women whose eyes are, once opened, never closed and this film made me think of Dad.  Dad made his way through this world in his own way.  Dad, too, was a photographer and he didn't just teach me how to frame a shot and show me how visual arts were either manipulation of light or space, he taught me how to be a human.  This film brought all that back to me and for that I'm grateful.",1400976000,3,3026,4.497247706422018

5810139,5,B00DHJT200,Great movie! Not what I expected but definitely a good family friendly movie that is unpredictable.  You'll really love it!,1400976000,,123,5.15
5810140,5,B00DHJT200,Great scenery. Motivational. I would recommend this for the entire family. Ben Stiller brings his humor through in this movie.,1400976000,,126,5.35
5810141,4,B00DHJT200,"The movie was original and kept you on the edge of your seat. It was an excellent movie.  Ben Stiller portrayed many characters in the movie, which made it very amusing.",1400976000,,169,4.451612903225806
5810142,2,B00DHJT200,"My family likes Ben Stiller. I detest his consistent wussy, neurotic, bumbling, can't just stand up straight and actually say something clearly schtick. But whatever. In any case, half an hour into this, it was so slow and boring that we just... stopped it without any protest. No story line had emerged; the couple of intermittent flashes of fantasy came out of left field without any coherence; the performances were either tepid or strained. in summary, I am happy for Mr. Stiller's sake that it seems reviewers here liked it, but I remain a non-fan of his. If you appreciate his Igor-like, can't look you in the eyes, mumble your way through life thing... looks like this movie will have you covered.",1400976000,,704,4.778688524590164
5810143,2,B00DHJT200,"It is very strange, to me, that so many people rated this movie so high. Then I read the four and five star reviews. Folks, you don't give a movie high ratings because the cinematography is great. Yeah, there were great shots, stunning vistas. So what? I can turn on a  National Geo. travel video and see the same, or better. This movie was boring to the nth degree. We both fell asleep throughout the flick. The plot was interesting, to an extent, but the pacing, chemistry between leads and general development were horrible. I gave it two stars only because of the camera work. If not for that, this would be a zero.",1400889600,3,619,4.4298245614035086

5810165,4,B00DHJT200,This is an enjoyable and inspiring story based loosely on the classic James Thurber character. Ben Stiller does a good job in the title role. Some of the locations are beautiful.

5810166,3,B00DHJT200,"I chose this movie based on a short 20 minute  audio book narrated by Ben Stiller. It wasn't really what I expected because the movie did not really follow the short prelude. Although the scenery throughout the movie was really beautiful, it was very difficult to follow and seemed  to constantly jump from scene to scene so you really have to give it all of your attention.",1400889600,,374,4.567164179104478

5810168,5,B00DHJT200,Ben Stiller did a good job of directing and starring in this one.  It also has a good message to the whole movie.,1400889600,,113,3.9130434782608696
5810169,5,B00DHJT200,"I just love this movie. Ben Stiller makes Walter Mitty a reality. He shows the human side of a cloistered mind who never quite stepped out of his comfort zone as a man. In childhood he was an average kid who enjoyed skateboarding.  He had moments of ""dropping"" out of time even as a child.  After his father died he had to find a way to help his mother make ends meet and so he got a job. Still he had his moments of zoning out. All throughout life his mind would take him on adventures that he never felt comfortable endeavoring in.  Until he was forced to. With the take over of Life magazine by a dissembler who intended to make life a digital only venue he was forced to make some choices. His biggest choice was the choice to find a single picture. Somehow it got lost and he had to find it. It was the ""quintessential"" statement of what Life was all about. It was an adventure that he had only dreamed about before and it made a new person of him.
I think you will love this movie for simplicity and for the adventure.",1400889600,,1024,4.161616161616162

5810195,5,B00DHJT200,"I've read many of the ""talking heads"" reviews, which in general tried to over analyze this movie, mostly with phony premises. This was, in my opinion as a movie watcher, a Ben Stiller creation, touching, fun, with a good feeling flick. For quality entertainment I had to give it five stars.

He's come a long way since ""Something About Mary."" The ending, as expected, was heart warming. I'll be watching it again to see details missed in the first viewing.",1400803200,,456,4.7
5810196,4,B00DHJT200,But well worth the watch.  Ben Stiller and the Life background is what sets this version off from the original.,1400803200,,111,4.55

5810198,5,B00DHJT200,"The rare case of a maligned remake, a long-term denizen of development hell, which seems to have benefited from the extended incubation. The offbeat saga of a chronic introvert, so conflicted he debates the merits of a single mouse click, it thrives on his spirited imagination and the audience's uncertainty about where the line stretches between stark reality and vibrant make-believe. These scenes, peppered with equal amounts of breakneck effects magic and surprising, effective laughs, are the heart and soul of the movie. Not only do they keep the pace skipping along at a frantic speed, but they also effectively foreshadow upcoming events, convey Walter's wants and needs, and chart his progress on the road to self-discovery. Ben Stiller is wonderful in the leading role, both as a mousey, zoned-out ghost at the journey's outset and the large, confident individual he becomes, and the awkward chemistry he shares with Kristen Wiig is just right. My sole complaint, really, is that after handling so much in the opening acts, it feels stuck during the slower-paced home stretch. Intelligent, thoughtful, entertaining adventures - both real and imagined - with a beating heart and a fresh sense of style.",1400803200,,1212,5.188775510204081
5810199,4,B00DHJT200,"The beginning of the movie may cause some to stop watching, believing that it will be just another Ben Stiller comedy.  While there is nothing wrong with Ben Stiller comedies one may be expecting something different based on the title.  If this is the case, one would not be disappointed.

5810201,5,B00DHJT200,"Its quiet, contemplative, compelling, and beautifully made. A guy who never does anything, except in his fantasy life, finally ventures out and does things I would never think of doing in a quest to find a missing negative (to save his job) and ends up becoming a real human who can interact well socially with other people for the first time in his life.

Why did I rent this?  Then it got interesting and then I realized it is really an uplifting movie.  I guess I didn't like his daydream sequences.  When he started living life to the full it started to really tell a story.  Then the ending had a uplifting twist to it.  Hope you like it as much as I did.,1400803200,,471,4.087912087912088

Walter Mitty had the opportunity to take the audience on a true spiritual awaking like in film such as ""Life of Pi"" and ""Way of the Peaceful Warrior"". This film felt flat and unbearable to watch.

It was almost painful to watch. Walter keeps zoning out into these elaborate daydreams while those around mock him. Once he decides to take action and actually do something the movie improves. The last half of the movie is much easier to watch and it ends on a happy note. Not epic happy, not syrupy happy, but happy none the less.

5810299,3,B00DHJT200,"Based on the same James Thurber short story, this movie is the latest attempt as of this review.

Walter (Ben Stiller) leads a complex life as he watches after his mother (Shirley MacLaine), is love smitten by a co-worker (Kristen Wiig) and must find ""slide 25"" form his hero (Sean Penn). There are several other subplots.

At crucial moments he zones out and imagines scenarios that start out logical and goes way out in left field; sort of in the style of a David McAlister ""Dave"" Barry skit. Soon we are caught up in longer and longer zone outs.

Now you thing that the zone outs are just crazy fun. Soon you realize that they are more than just a coping tool as they help figure out the great puzzle of the missing ""slide 25.""

A lot of the comments made assume that you have seen several movies such as The Wizard of Oz (1939), Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977), Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), The Outsiders (1983), and The Matrix (1999).

It has a light and innocent feel about it similar to ""Stranger Than Fiction"" which is another movie I like.  I think Ben Stiller did a fine job directing this movie as one of his first forays into directing a more serious film.  But it still has a few precious Stiller-esque moments in it.

The the story of a bench warmer making his way to Varsity.  The humor isn't epic. The jokes are subtle, but intelligent, and appropriately placed throughout the movie.  The character of Walter is a person inside all of us. We see the journey of a man who is the very definition of a, "" late bloomer.""

(there's a tiny bit of swearing, but nothing over the top) There was one moment that did give me pause, and I had to discuss with the kids afterwards... jumping into a plane with a thoroughly wasted pilot was framed as a carpe diem, following-your-dreams kind of choice. Not exactly a good teaching point for kids. Otherwise, thumbs up.",1400457600,,491,4.72093023255814
5810390,3,B00DHJT200,"I watched this movie with my wife and we both found it moderately entertaining.  Ben Stiller did a good job as Walter Mittya chronic daydreamer who is forced to break out of his ordinary life when a negative goes missing.  The storyline was a bit cheesy (i.e., Stillers character is forced to travel the world looking for Sean Penns character in order to ask him about a negative he lost), but the ending makes up for iteven if the ending was relatively predictable in my opinion (spoilerthe negative was in the wallet he threw away).

Overall, I felt the special effects were good, the acting was decent, and there were some humorous parts.  It was far from a great movie, but was entertaining enough.

5810498,5,B00DHJT200,"I went into this with a lot of trepidation.  Ben Stiller's recent output hasn't been very stellar with its share of formulaic comedies and ""Meet the Parents"" retreads.  This project is an obvious labor of love for Stiller who not only stars but directed the film and his painstaking efforts to do justice to the material shows.  The underlying theme is it's alright to fantasize but there's a big wide world out there so go out  and embrace it.  Walter, somewhat passive and a little timid, through necessity is forced to leave his comfort zone and finds that as one existence dies  another one is born and there is no turning back.  Walter is an everyman and we root for his success.  It's difficult to pigeonhole this film because it has elements of comedy, drama, and dabbles in the fantastic.  What this film has is immense heart which cannot be replicated by any amount of CGI.  ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" is a rousing crowd pleaser that demands to be discovered.",1400371200,,975,4.616279069767442

5810543,5,B00DHJT200,"I've always loved the concept of Thurber's Walter Mitty, but I was not really that in love with the original film even though I liked Danny Kaye very much.  Having never been a big fan of Ben Stiller, I basically decided to see this film because the trailer was good and the other movies available at the time left me cold.  I was stunned at how good this was.  This is really the only role I've ever seen Stiller in where I felt his performance was outstanding.  Unlike the usual goofy roles he ordinarily plays, this one gave him the opportunity to be a real guy--shy and intimidated at first, and then courageous and indomitable as he pursued his goal.  Despite his more realistic portrayal, he is still funny--and actually, perhaps funnier--because his humor is understated and does not undermine his portrayal as an everyday guy rather than a caricature.  He is likable, and before long you find yourself rooting for him.  Kristen Wiig's performance was especially engaging.  We don't really see enough of her in the movie, but she is the driving force behind Stiller's transformation.  Sean Penn is seen even more briefly in the film, but his portrayal of the renowned adventurer/photographer is terrific and believable. In the sea of mediocre films that Hollywood has churned out in the past few years, this is one of the few standouts.  I'll watch it again.",1400198400,,1365,4.770212765957447

It doesn't follow the original story line at all, but recreates a new story based on the original idea. The new story is good too, so don't be put off by that.

5810569,5,B00DHJT200,"THE SECRET LIFE OF WALTER MITTY is the story of a man who escapes his mundane reality through wishful fantasies, who one day steps outside his door to DO something noteworthy, and in the process discover that life is worth living, and worth living *bravely*. It is a warm, rich, beautiful, big-hearted film that brims with earnestness, passion, and a wide-eyed love for cinema. Ben Stiller did something rare to me with Walter Mitty: he made me realize the true potential of the movies to change people again.

The cast is led by Ben Stiller, ditching the goofball persona that served him so well in Tropic Thunder and Zoolander, and showing admirable restraint. His Mitty is an everyday-guy who is forced to step outside of his dream world and do something brave, even dangerous, and in the process discovers excitement, friendship, love, and the joy of living. It's a fabulous performance, earnest and full of heart, with Stiller's comedic talents serving him well in fantasy scenes. He's backed up by a charming and smart Kristen Wiig, and a supporting cast filled with talented performers like Sean Penn, a hateable Adam Scott, Shirley McClaine, and Patton Oswalt.

But the movie's unique visual style impressed me as well. Stylistic, almost retro, Mitty moves between anonymous offices, the bustling life of the streets, and the vast open lushness of Iceland with equal aplomb. The cinematography is gorgeous, and the colors are rich and vibrant. Stiller's implementation of CGI, especially in the day-dream scenes is admirable, reminiscent of Robert Zemeckis. The score and soundtrack is earnest and rousing, coupling perfectly with the theme of the film. One small gripe I do have is with a few camera angles. Ben Stiller is not a new director, but he's never worked with this budget before, and you can tell in some scenes that he's trying a new angle to show off his expensive set, or putting the camera in this place to get a striking shot, without realizing that it doesn't really add anything to the movie.

But in conclusion, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is a beautiful, rich, feel-good drama comedy with a great performance from Ben Stiller, gorgeous visuals, and a great message. This is just the kind of film you want to curl up on the couch and watch with your family. 5 Secret Lives out of 5.",1400198400,,2313,4.835858585858586

This gave us more time to really study the film, appreciate the excellent acting.. and think about all the things on our bucket lists, left undone.  We can highly recommend this movie.  I'd like to watch it again soon.. or even own the DVD.",1399939200,,537,4.6
5810766,3,B00DHJT200,"Boring. Artillery is an ok actor but a flat, simple director. You keep waiting for some excitement and it never happens. I'll watch anything and yet I could almost not get through this movie.",1399939200,,191,4.647058823529412
5810767,5,B00DHJT200,I really liked the movie. It was fun to watch all the adventures and to see the story line develop. It was basically a very good movie. It would be one your would not be embarrassed to show your family and yet stayed interesting the whole time.,1399939200,,244,4.212765957446808
5810768,5,B00DHJT200,"Very well done movie, emotional and visually wonderful. I think the critics are not fair with the movie and in the future it will be more appreciated",1399939200,,149,4.555555555555555

5810770,5,B00DHJT200,Ben Stiller was great as Walter Mitty. A good family movie that can be enjoyed by all ages. Very enjoyable .,1399939200,,108,4.190476190476191
5810771,4,B00DHJT200,"It's harder to find a family film that our entire family can enjoy, but surprisingly this movie was enjoyed by all.  To be candid, I wasn't expecting much of a movie that Ben Stiller not only acted in but directed.  Our experience was quite the opposite - it was charming, funny, had great scenery, and was touching all at the same time.",1399939200,,337,4.419354838709677
5810772,3,B00DHJT200,"This was not a bad movie, it just seemed very ""pieced together"". That whoever wrote this had these scenes in it and just choppily connected them. I really like the story of Walter Mitty, written and the previous Danny Kaye version. There are some beautifully shot scenes in this - all the skateboard scenes+++ but I did not see a connection/chemestry between any of the characters or with what was happening. Sean Penn was not in it a whole lot but I did enjoy the one scene, gave you an idea of what his Fast Times character might have became :) I don't tend to follow reviews so watch it and make up your own mind. Hope YOU enjoy!",1399939200,,632,4.319327731092437
5810773,5,B00DHJT200,"I loved this movie, I wish I had seen it in the theaters because the scenery was amazing!  I'm sure a lot of us can relate to his ""daydreaming"".  Here's hoping we can make some of those daydreams come true!!",1399939200,,207,4.15
5810814,4,B00DHJT200,"Fun movie with great cinematography and a good ending. Not the best movie, and kind of silly, bit I wasn't disappointed at all.",1399939200,,127,4.565217391304348
5810815,5,B00DHJT200,Creatively written and scenes from Greenland and Iceland were beautiful! My husband and I chose it for our movie for the week.,1399939200,,126,4.7727272727272725
5810816,5,B00DHJT200,"This movie was so well done and kudos to Ben Stiller as he continues to grow as an artist.  I love the way his fantasy scenes blend into the movie and you don't always know if it is real or not until he snaps back.  This was a fabulous novel by James Thurber (obviously updated with history and technology) who showed the way we all tend to have regrets for not taking the risks that would light us up.  Also, Kristen Wiig was great in this, and absolutely perfect for the role.

Loved it!  I would watch it again.",1399939200,,514,4.151515151515151

5810820,3,B00DHJT200,"Story line and WM imagination/daydreaming scenes seemed silly to me at first, but I ended up getting sucked in by how well the move was made.  Nice job Ben Stiller.",1399939200,,164,4.466666666666667
5810821,4,B00DHJT200,Great movie about principles. Odd at first but events make you want to see what happens next. Funny and romantic.,1399939200,,113,4.7

5810824,5,B00DHJT200,Bought this movie to supplement reading the original short story.  Movie has a calm feel to it... the way Walter's life is supposed to be... The exciting things that begin to really happen to his life add a nice bit of humor too.  Ben Stiller... perfect choice as Walter.,1399852800,,271,4.510204081632653
5810825,4,B00DHJT200,This was a very fun movie to watch.  I love Walter's wild imagination and propensity to daydream.  It kept my interest.,1399852800,,119,4.619047619047619
5810826,5,B00DHJT200,My whole family - ages 20 through 13 - were able to watch and enjoy this movie.  It's got great life messages and is entertaining.  We'll be watching this again!,1399852800,,161,4.333333333333333
5810827,5,B00DHJT200,"I just placed this item on my wish list, as my birthday is coming up in July. My husband and I FINALLY got the chance to watch this on a movie app two nights ago; we meant to go see it in theatres but the holidays as newlyweds were rough. I knew I would probably like it right off the bat, as the trailers featured a track by Of Monsters and Men. It turns out the soundtrack held much more than that. The plot was wonderful--unconventional and kept me interested every minute. The music tied every scene together and Ben Stiller plays a wonderfully deep character that keeps you wondering what's next in his life. I tend to like comedic actors, such as Stiller and Will Ferrel, better when they play more serious roles. This movie moved along quickly and featured a gorgeous soundtrack to keep things moving.",1399852800,,808,4.466216216216216
5810828,5,B00DHJT200,"I admit, I'm not sure why this movie was so spectacular; it just was. I guess I'm just writing to say if you think this is going to be a yawner, think again! I thought it would be, and kinda wanted that. Just some mindless snoozer I didn't have to think too much about. I was very pleasantly surprised that it really hit me where I live. The premise is that Walter escapes real life through fantastical daydreams, and by doing so often misses 'real life.' Blah, blah blah. Who cares. Old theme.

But this turned out to be a rather different twist on the old theme. Walter's escapist daydreams (amazing scenarios that involve asking 'the girl' out, telling off a jerk, etc), while laughable, are actually quite mundane and in some ways perfectly within the boundaries of reality in that he *could* ask the girl out and tell the jerk off, if he really wanted. But his real life adventures, once he begins searching for the elusive photojournalist, are completely unbelievable; in almost no way achievable. And yet I found I didn't even question a moment of it.

It's worth seeing just to spend time in a world where the possible and impossible trade places so serenely you don't even realize it until the end.",1399852800,,1207,4.583333333333333
5810829,4,B00DHJT200,"Surprisingly wonderful movie.  Entertaining, funny, good story line, and you don't have to worry about bad language or sex.  Very family friendly movie.  Just fun to watch.",1399852800,,172,5.296296296296297
5810830,3,B00DHJT200,"I enjoyed this movie, but you had to watch closely, so you didn't get lost.  Ben Stiller made the movie come alive.",1399852800,,115,4.2272727272727275
5810831,5,B00DHJT200,This movie was a really nice surprise. What I thought was a great story was transformed into an excellent film. The acting was very good. Ben Stiller finally does some more serious acting and an excellent performance at that! The photography is especially good in this film!,1399852800,,274,4.851063829787234
5810832,5,B00DHJT200,"This movie is a must-see, even if just for the visual impact.

At points, the scenes are shot intimately close. At other points, extreme wide shots give a sense of the scale of little Walter in a very big world.

Sean Penn plays a small role as an actor, but his character's impact on the film is overarching and key to Walter becoming the man he's dreamt of.

Let your kids watch this one and get inspired to become the best at what they do.",1399852800,,442,4.176470588235294
5810833,5,B00DHJT200,"It isn't always easy to find a film the whole family can enjoy. This is definitely one that our whole family (girl age 9, boy age 12 and mom and dad) really liked. The story is beautifully crafted and when it is over you are left wanting more. It kept the kids attention throughout, the scenery was amazing and the characters were all really easy to like (well except for the one who you weren't supposed to like but even he was entertaining). I'm not really a Ben Stiller fan but I would watch this one again.",1399852800,,510,4.268041237113402

5810855,5,B00DHJT200,"I love the original of this film with Danny Kaye, which was more of a comedy.  I also liked this updated take on the same theme...to not waste time dreaming that life is better, but going out and making it better.  I appreciated that it was clean and family friendly, it had a good moral, and we enjoyed it.  Good show.",1399852800,,319,4.19672131147541

Ben Stiller and Kristen Wiig do a great job of portraying their characters and there is no senseless violence or innuendo that would make you uncomfortable, like in too many movies today.  In short, it's great entertainment and feels good to watch.",1399852800,,391,4.909090909090909
5810860,5,B00DHJT200,"I love how this story  targets the Walter Mitty moments that we all keep hidden deep inside our smaller selves during our ordinary lives.

Uplifting.",1399852800,,325,5.25
5810861,5,B00DHJT200,"I'm always a little hesitant when i sit down to watch a Ben Stiller movie. They're either complete duds or they're amazing.

I think the second half of this movie is much better than the first, but overall I don't know if I'd recommend it.  Some of the characters were underdeveloped and the plot was pretty predictable.

Plan to have some time after watching it to replay parts. Never gets old. Amazon does not let me give it a high enough rating. This makes a five star movie cower in it's shadow. At least fifteen stars!!!! It's funny, clever, and interesting. It's a family movie, but if you need a good laugh, look no further! And if you seem to be getting bored, (?!?) at the end, all of the little details fit together, like the wallet and clementine cake. Worth the price.

I love Ben Stiller and Kristen Wiig, but their chemistry fell flat, the weird concept combined with unlikely relationships, the lack of any really funny moments, just made this movie bad.

One of the coolest scenes I've ever seen in a movie was the Major Tom song and the helicopter. It blew me away.

Ben Stiller is brilliant. If nothing else, it's a beautiful movie with gorgeous scenery, but it's much more than that. It's about not being satisfied to stay in your comfort zone and just dream your dreams. It's about getting out and turning those dreams into memories. But it's also about being at peace with who you are and where you are in life. Very enjoyable.",1399680000,,527,4.557894736842106
5810992,4,B00DHJT200,"I enjoyed this movie a bit more than I expected.  I like that Ben Stiller took a number of hysterical actors and then toned down the  comedy to a much more subtle level.  The only part I think they overdid was the outrunning of the volcano.  If it was ever that close, they and the car would have turned to ash.  I only know that because of the useless knowledge I have about the hot ash, how fast it travels, & how hot it actually is.

Other than that, It was a fun, if not a bit disjointed at times, movie.  For light fair, it's a thumbs up.

5811027,5,B00DHJT200,"Loved this movie! It's a feel good happy movie. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is a magical tale of James Thurber's classic story about a nerdy, geeky man who lacks confidence and who is a day-dreamer, escaping his rather boring dull life by mentally zoning out into a world of fantasy. Walter's Life Magazine job along with that of his co-workers is about to end due to a shut down as Life Magazine ceases to be a printed media, has a corporate takeover, and is soon to become an online only magazine. Walter takes action in the real world embarking on a global journey to find the missing picture that is needed for Life Magazine's last printed cover image. Walter's trip turns into an extraordinary journey of interesting people, situations, gorgeously breathtakingly beautiful landscapes and most importantly the discovery of his confidence, courage and a new zest for life.",1399593600,,879,4.866666666666666

5811072,5,B00DHJT200,"First of all, I am not a big fan of Ben Stiller. His movies are hit or miss with me. However, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is a fantasy exploration of the adult psyche grasping to the childhood bewilderment of endless daydreaming. It is a movie about take action and defining yourself.  It is amazing to watch Walter transcend from the life he feels he is expected to live and never living the life he envisions to actually play out those dreams.  I think the directors and actors did the original short story justice and was a pleasure to watch. I almost rented it again so my wife could see it, but that was only an excuse so I could again as well!",1399420800,,653,4.258064516129032

I really enjoyed this movie.",1399420800,,344,4.34375

Something about Stiller's version attracted me but I did not have the time to see it when it was at the movies.  I am so glad I picked this up when I went to the video store.  I am not a huge fan of Ben Stiller, I like a couple of his movies but once is often enough for many of them, not so with Mitty.

I loved everything about Ben Stiller's The Secret Life of Walter Mitty: the music, the visual/cinematography, characters, the actors who did a fantastic job and the interpretation of the story.  I personally think this interpretation can apply to so many people who live without actually experiencing life.  Once again it has been proven that if the professional reviewers don't like something, it is worth a second look and the price of movie ticket.

This will be going on my movie shelf. Charming,funny, engaging, visually stunning and worth watching.",1399334400,,1050,4.4375

The story was too fragmented, and the plot didn't hold together well.

5811135,2,B00DHJT200,"I guess I was looking for more of the ""Secret Life"" than Ben Stiller provided.

This movie is loosely based on the Thurber story but, strange for Hollywood, is more upbeat and has a happy ending.

Ben Stiller makes an endearing Mitty.  Although he is strangely physically fit for a sedentary dreamer, that can be easily overlooked as one gets caught up in the storyline.

I actually prefer the movie to Thurber's story, as I liked seeing Mitty triumph in the end.

It would have been funny if Stiller could have worked in at least one machine which made the ""pocketa-pocketa"" noise (which every machine in Thurber's story makes), but Oh well.",1399334400,,643,4.714285714285714

Mitty had become subsumed in a life of living for others.  When he finally considered his own needs everyone was supportive and he got the girl.  Escapism.,1399334400,,322,4.0476190476190474

There are quite a few strange and far-fetched scenes that will keep your interest, even if the ending is a bit less than satisfying.  Kristen Wiig and Shirley McClaine have small, but pivotal roles, and the cameo by Sean Penn is oddly serene.

5811318,5,B00DHJT200,"I saw this in the theatre and absolutely loved it. Ben stiller swung for the fences with this one, and although some critics panned it as a miss, I thoroughly enjoyed it. I felt that the extreme goofiness mixed in with the seriousness tone worked because it showed just how much different Walter was on the inside. The tone of comedy was over the top and I think that's why critics were put off. They knew how great this could have been if it had chosen a side. Either comedy or drama. Or a more typical dramedy.

I've seen the original Walter Mitty with Danny Kaye, and I wasn't expecting much out of a remake (as, sadly, seems to be the norm these days in Hollywood).  This one, however, was really good.  Ben Stiller gave a great performance as the ""zoned out"" Walter Mitty, and played the part quite well.  Great cinematography and music.  Overall, a very enjoyable movie!  Glad to see there wasn't any overt political or social message in this one (rare these days).  Watch this if you just want a good, clean, ""feel good"" movie!

5811406,4,B00DHJT200,"PREFACE: I haven't seen the original.  I try not to compare remakes to the originals anyways, unless they're by-the-numbers remakes designed solely to make a little cash.  This film comes across as a true labor of love, so I feel I'm justified in giving it an unbiased review.

Walter Mitty works in the cellars of LIFE magazine, and his job may be on the line: a trio of bearded wonderboys (headed by snob-for-hire Adam Scott) has come strolling in with the news that the magazine is switching to online-only, and a lot of people are about to be out of their jobs.  Walter, who spends equal parts of his time daydreaming about the person he'd like to be, and fantasizing about the woman of his dreams whom he can barely talk to, is sure to get axed.  Especially when famed photographer Sean O'Connell sends in his latest snaps...with his most cherished picture missing.

So Walter takes a leap of faith and pursues O'Connell across the globe, and this is where the film begins to fall apart.  Don't get me wrong: it's incredibly easy to root for Walter.  Writer/director Ben Stiller portrays him perfectly, a nuanced performance that is a bit by-the-numbers, but Stiller has enough charisma (especially with costar Kristen Wiig) that it's hard not to like him.  However, the film is at its strongest when it's portraying Walter as a day-dreaming everyman, an ordinary schmuck who doesn't realize his full potential.  THIS is the heart of the film (and, hence, the title).  When Walter impulsively starts acting out his fantasies, we begin to lose touch.  The film strays away from its point.  Cue the dramatic music and endearing scenes of self-fulfillment.

THE SECRET LIFE OF WALTER MITTY gets one thing right from start to finish: it looks fantastic.  I mean amazing.  The film slips seamlessly from fantasy to reality, a polished cinematic gem burdened mainly by its script.  The acting is solid and the direction is near-flawless; yet the film ultimately undermines its own purpose.  Which is a shame, because there's so much to like here.  Even if it's your typical ""feel good"" movie, there's still enough here to make it worth your while.  But with the talent behind it, it could have been much, much better.",1399161600,,2216,4.8121693121693125

5811408,4,B00DHJT200,This movie isn't a remake of the Danny Kaye classic-which is great. Ben Stiller does a real great job playing Walter Mitty -an introvert who dreams of doing great things but never quite does them. The catalyst for change is a missing and high-value photo print which send him on an exotic  journey. The journey is not really one of self-discovery so much as one that breaks the inertia of his life. There's also a love interest and a random connection through Eharmony that pushes the story-line.,1399161600,,496,4.7011494252873565

5811411,2,B00DHJT200,"For the first 30 minutes I kept shaking my head (between yawns) and asking myself "" what the hell is this movie about?"". It's slowww, disjointed and did I mention BORING. If you manage to actually make it through the entire movie there IS an ending, however lame it may be. I'm stunned at all the 4 and 5 stars people have given this. There are some beautiful scenic parts towards the end along with about 5 minutes of Sean Penn acting stupid, but so what? The story is ridiculous. This Bluray has been watched once and will forever more just collect dust in some dark corner of the DVD cabinet.
If I forgot to say BORING allow me to say it: BORING.  If you must purchase this movie PLEASE take my advice and wait a year or so until the price drops to below $10. Then at least you won't feel like you just got ripped off for $20.",1399161600,,829,4.18125

5811567,3,B00DHJT200,"James Thurber's ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" is one of the most-loved short stories in the English language.  It was adapted into a tasteless vehicle for Danny Kaye in 1949, then into this ho-hum vehicle for Ben Stiller in 2013.  The latest version was trapped in development Hell for twenty years; it was repeatedly re-written for many lead actors until Stiller came along.  We can be thankful for some things; it doesn't go to the vulgar depths of humiliation that Stiller films often do, and it tries hard to be thoughtful.  If it didn't claim to be derived from Thurber's story, it might have earned a better reception.

The best that can be said for this film is that it is visually beautiful.  It is based on the theme of photography - specifically photography for Life Magazine - and lives up to that ambition.  The color palette and contrasts are wonderful; if you don't see this in Blu-Ray, you've missed the boat.  But when someone's first comment about a film is: ""It looked beautiful,"" you know that the story was lacking, and it is.

Anyone familiar with Thurber's short story knows that it is built around the hero's preposterous fantasies of living a heroic life while suffering a life of pointless tedium.  It is a story that mixes a little pathos with a lot of humor.  Unfortunately, it doesn't provide enough material for a full-length film.  In the Danny Kaye version, the early Thurber-based fantasies are padded out with an inane spy plot.  In the Stiller version, the fantasies are an afterthought that don't flow well with the hero's real-life adventures.  The ""extras"" section of the recording show that most of the fantasy work ended up cut out of the film.  The result is a bittersweet film that echoes Stiller's more ambitious efforts.  Despite the over-the-top nature of those real life adventures, the film retains its drowsy maudlin mood.

There is a socio-cultural angle to this film too, an attempt to make an important comment about the phenomenon of ""downsizing"" that pervades America.  We the people have seen this before: a multi-million dollar corporate film taking shots at crass corporate goons ruining our society.  Not surprisingly, the piety leaves a sour aftertaste.  Even if Mitty and his sweetheart end up with each other, what does it matter if they don't have jobs?  Apparently, that's unimportant to Twentieth Century Fox; they've got our movie money.",1398902400,,2404,4.88641975308642

5811569,5,B00DHJT200,I loved everything about the movie. The acting was exceptional. The characters were great. The story line was cute. This is one I'm sure I will watch again.,1398902400,,156,4.607142857142857
5811570,5,B00DHJT200,"There are a lot of things wrong with this movie. For example the whole Benjamin Button scene felt kind of awkward to watch, the fact that Walter Mitty's phone miraculously worked even on top of a mountain and Walter Mitty's persistence for looking for Frame 25 wasn't fully addressed. In the description it says that the jobs of his and Cheryl but her job is already in jeopardy and getting Frame 25 wouldn't help her.

So why would I give it 5 stars? Well because I am Walter Mitty. I'm that guy that lives an average/dull life who daydreams just to escape. I can connect with Walter Mitty and there are people who can't so I understand if they dislike the film. It strays far from the source material and even further from the 1947 adaptation but I believe movies should be based on their own merit. But like any story you should focus on the overall theme and ideas they're conveying and not necessarily what actually happens. So if you're an average person with an extraordinary imagination than you'll love The Secret Life of Walter Mitty.",1398902400,,1044,4.5828877005347595

I am really hard to please when it comes to newer movies.  Either the ending is terrible or they just don't keep my attention thru out the movie.  Walter Mitty kept me interested the entire time and I couldn't wait to see ending, and it didn't disappoint.  I will not give out any spoilers, but Ben Stiller was very good and didn't ruin it with constant goofy skits.  I really felt for his character and in the end, I was so happy how all the pieces came together.  Please check this out, I really think you will enjoy.

By the end of this movie, though, I was 100% in love with everything about it.  It's a sweet, slow burn that will stay with you and, even if only in the tiniest of ways, make you a better person for having watched it, so be patient with it if you find yourself midway through the movie thinking, ""huh.

It does jump in the beginning between real-life and Walter's imagination, so that was a bit hard to follow at first, till I got used to it.  This movie is a work of art, the scenery, cinematography, the locations, colors, etc. are just amazing!  Walter Mitty is on a journey of self-discovery.  Sometime the journey is not about where you go, but about rediscovering who you are inside and Walter learns this on his adventures. Walter has to take a step outside his comfort zone and while doing so learns to become confident, not afraid to take chances and believe in himself.  This is a truly uplifting and great story.  I really enjoyed this film as did my husband.  He kept stating, I can't wait to see how this ends, such an interesting movie!

Ben Stiller is a fine post-modern Mitty, and his newly created quest to find the elusive photographer Sean Penn provides the fantasy element from the original story, but enhanced to a level that is both surrealistic and humanitarian. Kristen Wiig's character is nothing like the shrewish Mrs. Mitty, but
she offers a pleasant touch of realism, and an anchor to bring Mitty back from his daydreams.  The back story of the demise of LIFE magazine is the most painful part of the story, making the viewer wonder what James Thurber would think of our device-laden universe.",1398816000,,658,4.918918918918919

He daydreams constantly to make his mundane existence seem more exciting. After a chance happening at work, and the encouragement of a lady, Walter heads out the door to face the world. If you like the idea of isolated travel, beautiful scenery, and great directing you will like this. The story starts kind of slow, which makes Walters story seem that much more epic. If you need constant action or comedy in a movie I would stay clear, this film is more about the experience of life. I would recommend if you liked ""Into The Wild.""

5811792,1,B00DHJT200,"This bears only a passing resemblance to the short story upon which it claims to be based. The first 1/3 of the film displays Mitty going into fugue states and living through over the top fantasies. The fantasies are very short and hard edged. Stiller's Mitty comes across as an angry, tightly-wound man -- it's Michael Douglas's character from Falling Down who simply can't find a gun.

The final 2/3 of the film reveal Mitty is far more of a superhero than he imagined.  Gone are the fantasies, now he's living them out fighting sharks, jumping from helicopters, eluding volcanos, climbing the Himalayan mountains, etc.

None of this fits the charm and kind underdog theme of either the originating short story or Danny Kaye's superior film.

Beyond ruining the plot, the film lacks a sense of humor and drags you through Stiller's (must be, he's both director and lead actor) Western New Age / Zen-ish life lessons in a pedantic, patronizing series of music video / powerpoint presentations.  If you muted the volume and only walked into the room occasionally, you'd think it was a pretty travel slide show. Some of the film moments are, indeed, beautiful. The contrast only heightens my disappointment with this film.",1398729600,2,1221,4.907766990291262

5811798,4,B00DHJT200,"We have all had moments such as portrayed by Walter Mitty when our mind takes flight in a world that is fraught with constraints, restraints, political correctness and idiot bosses. In fact, it is probably true that if we did not have this ability we would go mad! And so it is with this film's protagonist.

Is the character mad, simply delusional, or secretly a hero in the disguise of a regular ""joe""? By the end of the film you wonder and depending on your personal proclivities you can chose any of the options.

If that is where you find yourself then the story/screenplay, directing, producing, acting and overall sense of the piece has done its job very well indeed!

I am not a rabid fan of Ben Stiller, although I thought he was nearly brilliant in ""There Is Something About Mary"", but I have to give him very high marks for his portrayal of Walter Mitty. Moreover, the production values of the film are astonishing with Iceland being my favorite.

It seems that this story could very easily spawn a franchise with a devoted fan base of which I would be glad to count myself as a member.",1398729600,,1097,4.49748743718593

I'm a big fan of Ben Stiller and I know the story of Walter Mitty and so I was primed to have a good time with the movie and it was, to say the least, a big disappointment.  The biggest problem with the movie is that I was often unsure about whether I was in real time or in fantasy.  The story is a classic; this telling of it is terrible.",1398729600,2,397,3.746987951807229

I guess perhaps I can just relate with Mitty moreso than most mainstream characters. Some of it was kind of cheesy I suppose, but personally I found even those moments highly entertaining. I'd say The Secret Life of Walter Mitty if definitely worth the watch, and I plan on adding it to my collection of movies as this is one I'll come back to for sure.",1398729600,,516,4.619565217391305

5811912,4,B00DHJT200,A quiet little movie that will make you smile. It's not Danny Kaye. The humor is much more subtle. The adolescent boss is a little over the top. But Walter does need a tormentor in this film so he'll do. Just wish he had been a little more prick and a little less 15 year old bully.,1398643200,,282,3.9649122807017543

5811920,3,B00DHJT200,"This movie is all about the imagery and the backgrounds.  The characters are poorly developed and the plot is quite weak.  While I am happy I have the Blu-Ray copy for the amazing scenery, the movie itself was far too predictable and a failure in my eyes.

I read some of the reviews and I am glad that others were able to go on an existential journey, but sadly for me that did not occur.  There are some light moments of humor, a brief moment or two of emotional movement, and the rest of the time is spent looking at the backdrops and seeing how much time is left in the film.

It is worth watching just in case you are one of the lucky few to go on that journey, but if you are like me you will be at least satisfied with the visuals and the karaoke scene.

Note:  With this being directed by Ben Stiller I got the distinct impression that he simply wanted to take a vacation to some remote locations.",1398643200,,905,4.137142857142857

It was not funny most of the time, it was the cause of some watchers in my living room to fall asleep because of the pacing of the movie...I don't know.  I just did not connect with this one.  Too disjointed.  Too slow.  Too un-funny:-(",1398643200,,341,4.265625

What is the point of someone mixing up his imagination with the real life and doing a bunch of nonsense.

A total BS.",1398643200,,317,4.482758620689655
5811923,4,B00DHJT200,This was a good remake of the original one done by Danny Kaye. The first half I thought was a little slow but was much better later. Good acting by everyone. My 14 & 19 year old were bored. They weren't quite getting it & was random. My husband loved it. Great moral to the story about how to enjoy life each day & take some risks (within reason) to allow yourself to get out of your comfort zone. All in healthy choices of course. A relationship in the story with no references to sex.....clean for kids but they would probably not understand the depth of the life lessons.,1398643200,,574,4.275229357798165

5811925,5,B00DHJT200,"In an age where amping up the violence, action, and crassness to intolerable levels seems to be the only way to make a movie, along comes Walter Mitty.  I loved this film, because it has just about everything:  Humor, romance, a bit of action, mystery, and adventure, all wrapped up into a fun and original story you can sink your teeth into.  And to top it all off I was able to watch it with the whole family (including a 7 year old).  There were a couple curse words, a couple somewhat vague sexual references, and a scene with a drunk guy who goes on to fly a helicopter, but aside from that it was what I would consider to be very family friendly.  Great job, Ben Stiller, keep them coming.",1398643200,,695,4.2748091603053435

5811953,4,B00DHJT200,Modern update of classic film which seems to work well.  Ben Stiller does a good job as hapless Mitty.  Good direction and careful editing sometimes makes it hard to distinguish between reality and his fantasy.  Flashes of sly humor and entertaining set pieces enliven the plot. (Nice reference to the unpronounceable name of the Icelandic volcano)  Minor characters nicely developed in what is essentially a one man show.  Well worth seeing.,1398643200,,442,5.169014084507042

I sure wish I had checked the review on Rotten Tomatoes first, where the critical consensus is 50%.  Now that's more like the disappointing movie I watched.  To me a five-star rating should go to one of the very best movies of the year and this most certainly is nowhere near that.

I like Ben Stiller, but this directorial effort was clearly a failed one.  I don't even know what he was trying to achieve here.

What this movie is, though, is a shill for product placement. Right up there with Tom Hanks worthless ""Castaway"".  I counted at least 5 offensively placed products, and it is worth noting that each product is mentioned and shown clearly multiple times.  Does it really help the story to know that Mitty worked at a particular pizza place such that we have to see images of their sign at least 10 times during the movie as well as many references to it? And the pizza place is mentioned throughout the movie, lest we forget.  I find that sort of predatory market really, really, really offensive.

Walter is per say your average office job male with a slight identity issue and daydreams a lot. He ends up finding himself in some modern humanistic sort of way that is appealing to some people today I guess.

Its fictitious story, but the magazine was real, and the people that worked to bring it life, like all print media worked largely out of passion. Of course with the internet, ""Life"" and many other magazine went under.

5812526,3,B00DHJT200,"Ben Stiller stars and directs The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, an in-name-only adaptation of a James Thurber short story (which was turned into a film starring Danny Kaye back in 1947). The new film is about a timid middle-aged man with a penchant for daydreaming, who has been working for Life magazine for sixteen years.

When he is unable to find a negative (for the magazines final print issue) that a photojournalist Sean O'Connell (Sean Penn) has sent to him, Walter sets out on a journey to find the missing picture.

In a sense the films title is misleading because, in fact, Walter stops daydreaming (which makes him an object of ridicule) once his life-changing journey starts. The Icelandic location is beautiful to see, and the film manages to have some nice interaction between Walter and his co-worker and love interest Cheryl Melhoff (Kristen Wiig), but The Secret Life of Walter Mitty suffers from unfunny jokes (including one Benjamin Button reference) and a far-fetched story that undermines the simple message: To see the world.

The message is all very good, but The Secret Life of Walter Mitty needs something better than a whimsical adventure  itself pretty entertaining, though  to make the message more persuasive.",1398384000,7,1238,5.019512195121951

I enjoyed the attempt at making the movie feel more new and updated, but I don't think the story was done quite right. I think with a little extra work this film could have been one of my favorites and totally in my collection. When I heard the bad reviews this got I told myself ""I will not expect much, but just try to enjoy it for what it is. So in short, Walter Mitty is a nice film with a passable story and acting.

I can't remember what else I did that day, or what I got for gifts or even what I gave. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty made last Christmas a day to remember. I have been going on little adventures now and then since I was 18 years old. But it had been over a year since the last time, and none were ever so grand as depicted in the movie. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is heart warming and inspirational, and it inspired me to book my upcoming trip to Iceland. I also think about this movie when I try new foods and experience new things that I may not have ever tried otherwise. It's worth it for anyone with any kind of longing for adventure to experience this film, and then go on an adventure of your own.

5812612,4,B00DHJT200,"I'll try not to spoil too much here...

Basically, the premise is this:

Walter Mitty is surrounded by people at work and in his life who have him pegged as a simple type, an ordinary man with nothing interesting about him. These people see him and think he lacks personality and a backbone because at times, his creative mind goes to a different place (I think to escape their rude and borderline bully behavior) where he sees himself in an exciting way...and to those around him, when he does this, he's spaced out and weird. However, come to find out, he is actually in fact really kind of cool. He has small secrets that people don't realize because they're too busy judging the book by it's cover!! He's really an adventurous type with a big heart.

Ben does a good job playing this role and is far less annoying in this than his other movies, I liked that. All in all, this is a good film to sit down and enjoy. Has beautiful cinematography and views into different parts of the world that movies tend to shy away from.

Give it a shot, keep an open mind and see the bigger message.",1398211200,,1088,4.371287128712871

Highly recommend both of them",1398211200,,247,4.25531914893617

Coming of age movies can be a bit taxing when all you want to do is grab the character and shake them but with this movie you can relate more with the life of Walter Mitty than all the others. The skateboard scene in Iceland was thrilling, the Himalayas were awe inspiring and the entry into LA International Airport security was hilarious. Oh and don't forget Todd. He was special. In other words, don't pass this movie up because of supposed other reviews or doubt. Watch it and enjoy.",1398211200,,586,4.435185185185185

However, not far into the movie it became completely engaging and wonderful.  Ben Stiller did an amazing acting job in this particular story.  My husband and I both said it was too bad that comedic roles aren't normally considered Oscar-worthy because his performance was so perfect and gave the character great charm and depth.  The adventure he engages in becomes completely engrossing and very believable.  It contains a very powerful message about developing our strengths, recognizing the value of others, and the rewards of doing versus just dreaming.  I am very happy we have this movie in our personal library and will undoubtedly watch it many times.",1398211200,,810,4.955555555555556

I'm sure you can find a synopsis in the other reviews so I'll skip that. If your of an age where you've spent 20 years or more ""taking care of business"" be it family, career or both, you will understand and appreciate this movie. In the past I have not been a huge fan of Ben Stiller, This role suits him well. I don't think I've ever wished a two hour movie were longer but if there had been a few more scenes in the middle....... anyway, if your middle-aged or better I believe you will truly enjoy this.

Really pumps you up, makes you want to quit your job and go cave diving or something.

So, to super enjoy this movie, watch the first 45 minutes of 12 years a slave (or schindlers list, ect ect) and THEN watch this.  Really good combo.",1398124800,4,597,4.472222222222222

I have not really been a fan of either Sean Penn or Shirley MacLaine (later movies) but I now have a favorite Sean Penn movie and favorite Shirley Maclaine movie. Kristen Wiig was really good - very believable and likable and I can't think of anyone who would have done better.
The way the movie was shot was very artistic. If you liked all the added graphics in ""Stranger Than Fiction"" (which I did), this is along the same lines (look for credits and the Life Magazine motto in the background through the movie.)

5812963,1,B00DHJT200,This movie has a very slow start.  The only appealing character in the entire movie was the mother.  Just not worth ever watching again.,1398124800,,136,4.625
5812964,5,B00DHJT200,"I understand this is a remake. I will have to go and check it out. I don't think it will out do this rethought,  instant classic. Ben Stiller is one of my favorite stars in many different types of films.",1398124800,,203,4.075

5812992,5,B00DHJT200,"On a scale of 1 to Dredd, I'd put this movie at a Dredd. It's not cheesy, it's not saccharin, it's just a great movie. Ben Stiller does a phenomenal job on becoming a strong person, while not going overboard. His directing was well done, and the limited special effects used made the dream sequences seem like a dream.

Great movie, great acting, great directing. Good job Ben!",1398038400,,377,4.544117647058823

5813030,5,B00DHJT200,"We loved this movie, and found the low PG rating very refreshing! It is a great story of a man finding himself, and having the courage to go and do the things he had only dreamed about before. Definitely an inspiration to not be afraid to take a leap sometimes, and see where life takes you. Our whole family loved it! :)",1398038400,,321,4.193548387096774
5813031,5,B00DHJT200,I Love it.  It's great story of a lonely man who leads a bland life but he gets an opportunity to change it and he does.  I got so excited for him!  Never too late to change your life for the better.,1398038400,,199,3.6904761904761907

5813033,4,B00DHJT200,A great feel good movie. Didnt know this story was originally a book by Walt Whittman. Has a very good story.,1398038400,,109,4.238095238095238

He even finds himself so boring that he lives in his daydreams. What will happen to Walter?",1398038400,,263,4.26
5813035,5,B00DHJT200,"I liked this film because I enjoy anything that Ben Stiller does. The surprise was that it wasn't anything like the Danny Kaye movie I saw as a kid, which I loved.
Once the story line became understandable I was hooked. Also Stiller evokes a warmth to his character that's very endearing. You want him to rise up and be the person he is meant to be.",1398038400,,349,4.223880597014926
5813046,2,B00DHJT200,Could and should have been so much more. As the character in the movie phased out periodically so did the movie. The potential was all there but the trailer was the better choice.,1398038400,,179,4.454545454545454
5813047,5,B00DHJT200,It is a feel-good movie.  Good for date night.  Good for family movie night if kids are bit older.  (no innappropriate scenes....just kids old enough to follow the story and not get bored),1398038400,,188,4.636363636363637
5813048,3,B00DHJT200,"I thought this movie was very inspiring. Yet very few memorable situations. Ben Stiller is a great actor, and i enjoyed this character better than most of his. Very believable.",1398038400,,176,4.9

5813050,3,B00DHJT200,"I only watched this as the reviews on here were really good. Its an ok movie and the scenery was cool when he starts traveling places, but I never got connected to any of these characters really. The daydreams this man has are pretty unrealistic, but I guess that was the point. It was just ok for me.",1398038400,,301,4.206896551724138

5813052,5,B00DHJT200,I watched this twice in a row. It was a good family movie with no swearing or super violent scenes. The idea that living your life to the fullest vs. dreaming about doing it resonates with the viewer.,1398038400,,200,4.2894736842105265

5813054,3,B00DHJT200,I loved this movie though I had some difficulty watching it...the quality wad not great as well as it stopping and rewinding on it's own several times. That was pretty frustrating.  Think I will rent it from the redbox to ser it without interruptions because the story was very uplifting.  This is the third movie I have rented from Amazon that I had this problem with. Thankfully it was not a movie I rented with my children...like the previous two...which led to tears!,1398038400,,471,4.662650602409639
5813055,5,B00DHJT200,"Didn't expect much, and yet I found myself pleasantly entertained.... I highly recommend this movie!

5813066,4,B00DHJT200,"There are some great instances where Walter is considering his place in the universe.  Each of either contemplate those types of issues or just put off thinking about it.  I thought the movie did a great job of illustrating how there are time when we need to look pass the gloom and doom and see we have options to react differently.  I am a huge fan of the original Danny Kaye ""Secret Life of Walter Mitty Movie"", and think the direction this version took does not compete with the original.

I really enjoyed the movie and the many characters.  There is not a lot of slap stick which I liked.  Overall a very enjoyable and entertaining movie.",1398038400,,644,4.461538461538462

5813069,3,B00DHJT200,Sure not the original  but a good story.. Kristen Wiig was her usual SNL un funny self but Bem Stiller was very good.,1398038400,,117,4.086956521739131

5813072,4,B00DHJT200,"If that makes sense at all, it was long and drawn out but the end made the wait worth it. It's really hard seeing Ben Stiller in this type of role where he's so serious, but he pulled it off like a charm.",1398038400,,204,3.7674418604651163

5813086,5,B00DHJT200,"I really enjoyed this movie immensely. Ben Stiller is such a great creative entity, isn't he? I don't like writing lengthy reviews so I'm not sure where to begin with this one. Somewhat bittersweet film, with a wonderful message about perseverance and being true to yourself. Some great scenery from different parts of the world that one normally doesn't see in films (at least mainstream American films). A gentle romance ( or at least budding romance). Great acting of course. Witty comedic moments and phrases. A very interesting character in the main ""villain"" - well acted and humorously so by whoever that actor is. i thought Sean Penn in the movie was very cool - even though he only appeared briefly towards the end, his presence was felt throughout. and what a wonderful casting choice for the main actress - I don't know who she is but she's incredibly cute. I won't even say anything about Ben Stiller because he's just awesome. Go Ben Stiller!",1397952000,,955,4.793939393939394

5813090,5,B00DHJT200,I am surprised this movie did not get higher reviews. It is a movie about a guy with a midlife crisis that blurs the line between day dreaming and real life. Who wouldn't want that?,1397952000,,181,4.2
5813091,1,B00DHJT200,"What a waste.  Truth be told I'm not a Ben Stiller fan.  He tried to make a charming film but failed in the attempt.  Its the dilemma of film makers everywhere - we have all the right elements and when we mix them together we should have a comedy, a drama...but sometimes it just doesn't work.  The Danny Kaye version from 1947:  ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty""  seemed to capture the imagination of Walter Mitty and myself without having to resort to special effects or outlandish scenarios.  As a friend once admonished me ""Its Just a movie,""  but this fails to reach that mark.  I still want my money back.",1397952000,,611,4.4324324324324325

5813093,5,B00DHJT200,"Ben Stiller's acting and direction were solid. The story itself was real, human, and oddball enough to be intriguing.  The ending was touching.",1397952000,,143,5.217391304347826
5813094,4,B00DHJT200,"I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. I was not expecting to feel that the there was many layers to this story than just a guy falling in love with a girl. The whole movie is about being in the ""now"" the present. From the moment the character of Walter makes the decision to look for the photographer and the missing picture his eyes are opened to life; the great adventure.
 I enjoyed all the actors, Ben Stiller, Shirley McLean, Sean Pen and  Kirsten Wiig. Very enjoyable and well worth watching.",1397952000,,502,4.5054945054945055

5813122,3,B00DHJT200,I thought it started off a little slow at first but got better at the end. All in all the movie was good and the back ground in Iceland and Greenland was enjoyable to watch,1397952000,,172,3.942857142857143
5813123,5,B00DHJT200,"Not completely true to Thurber's original work, but Stiller's direction keeps the concept alive.  The choice of music, cinematography, and storytelling make the movie worth your time.",1397952000,,183,5.777777777777778

5813127,4,B00DHJT200,"Ignored the lukewarm reviews from critics and rented this to watch with our 7 and 10 year old daughters.  We all really enjoyed this one! Great concepts about experiencing life to the fullest, living in the moment, and turning off the social media and internet to make real world connections.  Fantastic soundtrack, too. A few adult references, but they were brief and frankly went right over my kids' heads.  They said they loved Walter Mitty, and we did too - a great feel-good flick!

Edit: (minor spoiler ahead) Note to parents: there was one moment where Walter is trying to decide whether to get into a helicopter and fly with a pilot who is obviously drunk - played as a funny, pivotal moment, but I felt compelled to turn to my kids and say, ""You are never ever to to ever get into any kind of vehicle with someone who has been drinking, unless you happen to be stranded in Greenland.""  They were like, ""Yeah mom, we know, of course, duh!""  But it felt worth mentioning.  The rest of the film is fine, minus a couple of swear words, but my kids have seen and love ""The Goonies,"" so we've already had that discussion.",1397865600,,1124,4.480392156862745

I watched it again after ordering it as soon as it came out, and loved it just as much as when I first saw it. The cinematography is stunning and beautifully shot, and you can really tell the makers of this film did their best to really make a great movie that is first off, visually stunning. Secondly, I love the humor and fun plot of this movie, and find it very refreshing from what Hollywood is providing in theaters these days. It's family friendly, hilarious, and uplifting. The soundtrack is simply fantastic as well, and really compliments the action of the script. Ben Stiller is incredibly likable in this film and did a great job as the lead actor, director, and producer of the film. It's creative, positive, funny, and really a movie that I will continue to enjoy throughout the years. I highly recommend it!",1397865600,,914,4.5120481927710845

As for Amazon it is really FLUSTRATING to have the movie reload 8 times while watching. I use the Amazon app on the Roku and it strange that watching movies from others have little or no problems, so it either Amazon or a Verizon problem. I am watching FEWER movies on Amazon because of this problem. That why I give it one star",1397865600,,456,4.021978021978022

5813181,4,B00DHJT200,"I absolutely adored this movie -- went into it with high expectations based on the trailer, and got so much more than I was hoping for.  Favorite movie of the year, hands down.

My partner bought the Target edition Blu-ray and, although the packaging is really nice (looks like a book), the included spread of Life magazine covers isn't something that I will enjoy over and over again (I prefer her suggestion, a replica of Sean's wallet).

But loving this movie like I do, I decided to dip my toe once again into the world of digital copies.  I had only tried this once before with Rango and been sorely disappointed in the results.  I hate to say that this experience has not endeared me any more to the process.

First let me say that I'm no computer newbie.  I know my way around Androids, etc. and can usually figure out almost any problem I encounter.  Having said that, getting my digital copy made me feel exactly the opposite.  Worse, there doesn't seem to be any way to reverse an incorrect decision.

For example, choice one is method of delivery.  I chose the Google Play store, but in retrospect wonder if iTunes wouldn't have been more user friendly.  Too late.

I then chose an HD quality download, not realizing that it downloads to your device and there is no way to move it over to your SD card where you have three times the storage capacity.  Had I known this, I would have chosen a smaller file to download.  Too late.

You also can't use your Android player of choice to watch, only the device's stock player.  And you can't find the file in your file system, it can only be accessed through the Google Movies and TV or Play app (I did actually find it after digging through some Android forums, but it's in an almost unknown format called .wvm that can't be converted to anything more conventional).

It's cool that you can download it to multiple devices, since obviously I might not be using my current one forever, but it's still very irritating that the download is ""yours,"" but only so far.  I'm not comfortable with things existing only in ""the cloud"" since I have no control over it if something goes wrong.  Obviously this is an anti-piracy measure, but again we see punishing the law-abiding citizens along with the crooks.

If I'm wrong about any of this, please, correct me.  I'd love to know if there is a way to use my legally downloaded copy of the movie in a way convenient for me and not just in these narrowly dictated channels.",1397779200,,2468,4.498876404494382

Its essential all the same. Maybe those critics should take a hike or something. Put down the latte and get out of the office.

Well written, superbly acted with solid, almost understated eloquence, featuring some epic landscapes and hilarious daydream sequences, this is a fine, dare I say, 'family' movie. Its poignant, encouraging, delightful. Well done, Mr. Stiller.

5813231,4,B00DHJT200,"This is the story of Walter Mitty; a day-dreamer who escapes his anonymous life by disappearing into a world of fantasy . Its also the story of how Ben Stiller starred and directed a film that feels just a few steps short of pure cinematic brilliance! I was completely shocked to discover that this film was so universally panned by critics when it came out. I see the obvious flaw within the film, but for everyone to simply turn a blind eye towards this movie is nothing short of disappointing.

First the bad...

From the trailer, you easily get the feeling that this will be a film that would get so called ""Oscar buzz."" That's at least the feeling I got when I first heard about this movie. You've got Ben Stiller in what looks like the type of role you love to see popular comedians do; the ones where they break away from their usually schtick and try something charming and more dramatic (Jim Carrey in Eternal Sunshine, Will Ferrell in Stranger Than Fiction). And actually, for the most part, that's really what you get from Stiller. He's the everyman. The quiet anonymous man with a dream of being more than he is. Unfortunately, Stiller (who also directed this picture) believes its necessary to show us every single fantasy that pops inside this characters head. THIS is really where my criticism lies. In the first 40 minutes or so of this movie, you're treated to a parade of Walter Mitty's rich often CG-filled inner life. And its in these sequences that you really get a mixed feeling going on.

The trailer screams ""Forrest Gump"" while the first act offers up mostly Anchorman, Tropic Thunder, pretty much any broad comedy you can think from the passed decade. Its just that these fantasy sequences, while sometimes funny, don't really fit very well into the rest of the feature. It wouldn't bother me as much if it happened maybe two or three times, but after about six or seven times throughout the first 40 minutes, it really started to bug me. I understood everything that Walter was about before we were introduced to his ILM imagination and I was already rooting for him to succeed. Ben Stiller didn't need to include all these sequences to get his point across. While they would have worked perfectly fine in a broader comedy, here it feels out of place with the tone of the rest of the movie...

And now for the good....

After Walter Mitty finally has a goal and the motivation to begin his journey, that is when the film REALLY begins to become the film you were probably expecting it to be. The music, the direction, the cinematography, EVERYTHING that happens from this point on is incredibly well done! There's even a scene where Walter has another fantasy sequence...but somehow this one works! I know I was critical of the ones that came before, but this one is a lot smaller and a lot better integrated into the movie. Had Walter's day dreams been a bit more subtle and smaller like this one seen later on, I probably wouldn't have minded them so much and probably really enjoyed them.

Its almost a complete tonal shift from what you were introduced to. It becomes a film that captures the adventure of traveling into the unknown and gives you that really uplifting feeling that shows you how incredible life can really be. Its your typical story of an ordinary man who goes off and does extraordinary things, but it does it extremely well (in the latter half of the movie at least). That's what hurts the most; that this truly awesome movie has such a sporadic and sub-pare beginning. Perhaps that's why people found it so underwhelming; I think if you go in knowing it'll eventually become the movie you were wanting it to be, you'll be able to forgive it and enjoy the ride that it takes you on. I know I did.

The cinematography is amazing; honestly the wider the camera gets, the more beautiful it becomes! Its hard to believe places like this still exist and it really makes you want to get out there and explore the world. All the actors deliver great performances under Stiller's surprisingly good direction. The idea behind the fate of Life Magazine in this movie is satirical of the state of things today.

On a lighter note, one question you'll be asking yourself after you see the movie:

What MAGIC cell phone provider does Walter Mitty have?!

5813238,5,B00DHJT200,"I would not classify this as a comedy. It is an uplifting adventure drama. Yes there are some parts, mostly in the beginning, which made me chuckle a little, but over-all it is a simple story of a man who wants to do more but is stuck in an average world with an average job. He constantly day-dreams these extravagant stories and it is very entertaining. Where the movie get's really enjoyable is when he stops day-dreaming and actually living his life. Very positive story.

Ben Stiller did a fantastic job of acting and directing. Kristen Wiig was also charming as usual. It is rated PG, however they do say s*1t and d1*k in it, in that order. Don't let the PG rating deter you from watching this movie, it is not geared toward kids, but it will be enjoyable for everyone.

5813253,5,B00DHJT200,"Benjamin Stiller directed a great movie.  I believe every good autuer makes a film like this because it is in their heart.  Ben has made many movies as an actor but, as a director, has made the movie he wants to make.  Just like Will Ferrel in ""Truth in Fiction"", Stiller's character follows an existential path to redeeming the finer qualities of life.  But, the difference is that the actor is the director, and Stiller is able to capture the same brevity and magnitude of our own desires while understanding the continuity of the basic needs: that is love.  No matter how far we travel it is always to find sanctity in the love we find in the many facets of our lives.  And we should always understand that love, is in many forms.  A very powerful movie.  With many perspectives and much love- Benjamin",1397520000,,805,4.503448275862069

This charming film was a feast to my eyes, ears...and especially to my heart. An engaging storyline with an genuine and affable main character. The rich deep texture to the film itself made me wish I had seen it on the big screen (how did I miss this at the theatre??).

The music/soundtrack was equally delicious in way that seemed so very inspirational and sweet...and yet, at the same time haunting. I can tell this film will linger with me for a long time...

Two thumbs up!!!

5813271,5,B00DHJT200,"""Let's make every moment count starting now."" Walter Mitty (Stiller) is a boring unadventurous man who daydreams all day and works for LIFE magazine. When he finds out the magazine is publishing it's final issue all he has to do is find the negative for the final cover. This turns out to be a life changing experience and Walter Mitty finally discovers who he is. I have to admit that I was not excited about watching this going in. The trailer seemed boring to me and I am not a big Ben Stiller fan. I am not too proud to admit when I'm wrong and I was way off the mark on this one. From the opening scene you get to know and feel for Walter and during the course of the movie you root for him and share his experiences with him as if they were your own. Walter Mitty is the type of guy we all relate to and that's what makes this such a good movie. By the end he becomes someone we all wish we could be. This is not just a good movie its a very inspiring movie that needs to be seen by anyone unsure of themselves, and really who isn't? I highly recommend this movie and this is Ben Stiller's best work yet. Overall, a movie that hits you on a very personal level and makes you look at you life and how you live it.

Taking an idea from the wonderful James Thurber for the 21st century is just a delight.  Visually its breathtaking.  It has action, adventure, romance, and good laughs all in very dynamic times for industry. My family loves to sit down and enjoy a movie together which is extremely difficult given the extent of sex, gutter language, drugs, and violence that seem to be the formula for most movies other than animation or silly kids movies.  This is a grown up movie everyone can enjoy.  It was my 19 year old that said lets go.  My 21 year talked about it for days later.  But it was my 10 year old that said we had to see it again and please just buy it!  Again, thank you to Ben Stiller and his producers for making a film that satisfies so much of what a movie should be!  There is a good deal of product placement but it becomes a part of the story and I applaud those products who agreed to be part of a quality PG.
Just sit back and enjoy this movie and don't overthink it.",1397433600,,1076,4.204878048780488

5813279,5,B00DHJT200,This one is a must see.  Ben Stiller was great in this one.  It has a deeper meaning than what the movie is about and it goes into how Walter day dreams and then finally takes an adventurous trip.  He works for life and has a dull job and he takes a leap into the unknown which is something that he has always wanted to do but just hasn't.  This is a journey of where he is trying to find his self and he does.,1397347200,,410,3.788235294117647

I had two main problems with the movie:  It was very little like Thurber's short story which I felt compelled to read ( takes less than 20 minutes) after seeing the movie - and I always think that those movies that are based solely on titles are a bit of a rip-off.  Second there were the internal inconsistencies:  really, how much of an ineffectual guy could Stiller/Mitty have been, if he, at 42, could still skate board down a steep mountain side, bike and run 15KM up a volcano and then hike up the Himalayas.

It was ok, but a bit disappointing.",1397347200,,776,4.429577464788732

5813299,3,B00DHJT200,"This movie seems to have the potential to be so much more, it just seemed to not have the soul it could have.

I could easily relate to a Walter Mitty who can be shy, have a low self-esteem, generally unhappy in life, hesitant to take chances/risks, and lacks assertiveness. I have felt all of those at some point in my life and have always wanted better. Sometimes you just need that extra push or motivation, or the right person to come into your life and change you forever. ""I don't love you for who you are, I love you for who I am when I am with you"" type of thing. It seemed he was trying to pull off an ""Along Came Polly"" plot, just had too much other clutter in it.

Saying that, sadly, this movie does not maximize the potential of this connection but rather skips through it at a pace in which it seems it never really scratches beneath the surface. Despite some moments of action the movie moves at a snails pace, and at times you forget what the movie is even about. I think it is supposed to be about a man who wants more out of life but just does not have it in him to take it, but the movie never fully achieves this and because of that I came away unsatisfied. I think there was too much going on in the plot that distracted from the human story, such as what was on the negative, the adventurous photographer (whose legendary mysteriousness was a letdown once he was revealed in character), the jerk corporate exec guy and what was going on at LIFE, the eHarmony stuff, the woman of interest and her ex drama. All of this led to an ending that was pretty predictable by the time you got there.

Not a waste of 2 hours, just 2 hours I think I could have enjoyed much more if Walter were only given the chance.",1397260800,,1726,4.177177177177177

This movie is an intricate, brilliant film.
An epic adventure, a man trying to no avail to find someone, and all the while he finds himself.
Of course there are touches of comedy in this film, but this is unlike any other Ben Stiller film. There are also a bunch of really terrific actors in it too. Then there is this cool soundtrack, that really fits the film well.
The moral content in this story is going to resonate through me for a long time. This is definitely going on my favorites list, it was simply that incredible!",1397088000,,649,4.284552845528455

Boy, was I pleasantly surprised.  The movie starts off with what I understand to be the more mainstream idea of Walter Mitty, but then takes off with it to make a really great story and movie.  It isn't very often I can say a movie really inspired me, but this one really did.  I won't give it away, but it does feature some of the trademark Ben Stiller deadpan and wildly random humor, combined with a really great script, story, and excellent cinematography.  I couldn't wait for this one to come out so I could add it to my home library, and now I have it!",1397088000,,836,4.1875

One has to experience the movie, a few paragraphs could never do justice.
It would be like the question, ""Describe the Universe and give three examples.""

The story isn't perfect in that it's completely predictable and there is one painfully awkward ""Benjamin Button"" scene, but Walter Mitty's journey is such a joy to watch that you won't mind the one bizarre moment and that you already knew how it would turn out.",1397001600,,383,4.550724637681159

I'm very glad I did purchase it as I can see myself watching this over and over again. I think everything worked seamlessly.

I have been a fan of Ben Stiller's directing ever since Cable Guy which I think is one of the most underrated films of the past 25 years. Walter Mitty is a beautiful film, simple, not over-the-top, the scenery was incredible (my particular favorite is him going down the road on the skateboard with that beautiful background).

As for me it didn't inspire me to jump on of helicopters into freezing cold shark infested waters but I think it will inspire me to do some of the things that I have always wanted to do this film made me appreciate the living of life.",1397001600,,917,4.264367816091954

5813365,5,B00DHJT200,"The critics gave this movie a lot of crap for some reason.  I think it was because of 1 or 2 reasons. 1. The want to box up Ben Stiller hand have him be their little clown. Dance clown, dance.  He didn't dance like a clown in this film. It was a well written, well acted, well directed, and especially beautifully shot film.  or 2. The Walter Mitty tie-in just wasn't strong enough because it was so unlike the short story. Forget what anyone has said or what the title is and just watch this beautiful film. If it doesn't leave you smiling in the end, then you might be too cynical for a feel good film of this quality.",1396915200,,620,4.15

I purchased this movie on Kindle just a few hours ago,  simply because I had nothing else to watch, and I thought... why not? I'll give it a go. And I'm so happy I did! I was expecting a cheesy movie with (hopefully) a few laughs, but what I got was so much more! By now, I'm sure you've already read through some of the other reviews, so I won't repeat what the movie is about. My whole point of writing this review is simply this: the critics aren't always right. If they were,I would have never gone to see Star Wars on opening day when I was just a little girl and didn't care what anyone thought. I needed to see that movie!  I should have channelled my 'inner little girl' and seen this in a theater. But even though I didn't take that chance, I'm THRILLED that I took the chance on my Kindle. This is a wonderful movie!

This is a romantic comedy with a twist of wanderlust. It's more about getting off your booty and doing something with your life than about getting booty.  For me, a traveler and adventurer at heart, it made me want to travel, hike, and skateboard through Iceland;) Fun and easy to watch, with a touch of creativity, song and imagination.

What would it take for me or you to follow our calling or our heart's desire? For me, it would take a bit of a push. Perhaps this movie can be that push. It would be what you religious people call a sin to watch this and not have it effect your life. There are millions of men and women who daydream and never step up and grab what they possibly can. I am one of them. Perhaps I will step out of my comfort zone. - By comparison, I have nothing to lose. Remember that the only thing you get to take with you when you leave this life are memories.

I however believe part of the greatness of this movie is it's simplicity.  It isn't Harry Potter or 300.  It shouldn't be an epic grand adventure like Lord of the Rings.  It is a story about a man who finally gets to live his dreams in a way that he never expected.  I loved it.",1396483200,,422,4.2125

I mean, there is a predictability to the movie, you know where the negative is from the start and it is sort of frustrating  that Walter can't figure that out. But come on, other than that one not so believable shortsightedness on Mitty's part, the movie is just wonderful. I couldn't take my eyes off it for a minute. Stiller's performance was perfect and so was his directing. I bought this movie just to see it early. I seldom do that, the price you know? But this one as soon as I read the readers reviews and watched the preview I knew I had to see this one. Glad I did because it uplifted my spirits and even moved me (Life magazines final issue is a sad milestone in our lives, to see such an American iconic legend as Life go away is always underlying in this story and gives the movie greater depth).

So I don't know who these critics are who didn't like it, but whoever they are they're obviously just a bunch of self important sour pussed grouches who don't appreciate the magic of a beautiful story told, directed, acted and filmed beautifully. Don't listen to them. This movie is magical and you will love every minute of it.",1396483200,,1316,4.36734693877551
5813408,2,B00DHJT200,"Taken on its own merits this is an OK Ben Stiller vehicle with some excellent cinematography.  My problem is that it really has nothing to do with the James Thurber story that gives it the title.  I would have loved to see something like the 1930s hydroplane busting through the storm with Mitty as the skipper (""the old man'll get us through, he ain't afraid of nothing"") cue Navy hymn in the background.

Maybe because it's not mind numbingly dumbed down for the audience.  The entire experience was like a visual enema for all the clutter that clouds our minds and convinces us that, 'we can't do that'.  Maybe it's because by the end Walter was a man who chose to 'do it' instead of 'thinking or talking about it' that the critics hated it.  If you enjoy being led along by reality tv, 24 hour news cycles, pointless sporting competitions, being told how to live according to what you should buy then this is not a movie for you.

As a photographer, I was compelled to see Walter Mitty on the big screen after seeing the previews. However, the critics had given it bad reviews and I went into the theater not expecting much. After all, as a kid I absolutely adored the version with Danny Kaye (yes I was a kid in the 80's who grew up on old movies!).

What I got with this movie was far more than I bargained for or expected. It wasn't a love story per se - it was an experience. A journey. An awakening. (spoiler) The moment on the mountain when the photographer didn't capture the picture but instead wanted to enjoy the moment with his own eyes - that was life changing for me. Those moments that cannot be captured but must be EXPERIENCED are some of the best moments of our lives. And the end... oh the end.

5813443,5,B00DHJT200,"(Be Advised - SPOILERS)

This is not a movie that should have worked, and looking at Rotten Tomatoes, many of the critics did not think it did (though 3/4 of the viewers liked it).  It's not a great film.  12 Years a Slave was a great film...which I nonetheless hated, coming away from it from feeling empty and manipulated.  In contrast, I was deeply moved by Walter Mitty, profoundly more so than that other, Important Film. I came out of Walter Mitty feeling a genuine sense of uplift and wellness, which, though it didn't really track with the content, was actually there.

The film is loosely based on a wisp of a story by James Thurber (which, despite being an undergrad English Major, and despite ""Walter Mitty"" being a cultural shorthand for a big-dreaming little-man, I never read until today).  The movie begins with Walter Mitty, a ""negatives assets"" worker (there are two in his department) at LIFE Magazine, on the day it has been acquired and is being turned into an online-only product.  The usual corporate white-collared goons come in from the head office to execute the unfit (they all, inexplicably, have beards), with the lead, Ted Hendricks, being played by Adam Scott (who I loved in Tell Me You Love Me). That's happening as Mitty has been smitten by Cheryl Melhoff (Kristin Wiig), who is a recent divorcee, and newly employed at LIFE.  As the film opens, Mitty is trying to ""wink"" her through eHarmony, and is being shut down by the site for not having done enough with his life.  Whence he meets Todd, the helpful customer service rep who befriends Walter and acts as an appreciative fan through the film.

The plot pivots around the missing ""negative 25"", sent to Walter for the last cover of LIFE by the famous and maverick photographer, Sean O'Connell.  Cheryl plants the seed to go seek out O'Connell (played by a beautifully scruffy Sean Penn), which he does, with a trip to Iceland and then Afghanistan.  He returns, settles scores with Hendricks, and gets the girl.

It shouldn't work, at all.

So how does it work?  Well, let me lay out the ways I don't think it works.

Number one:  Ben Stiller is not the right actor to play Thurber's Walter.  You look in his face and it's not that of a beaten down everyman.  The vacuity of Derek Zoolander insouciant mug is gone. There's depth, history, strength, and self-awareness.  He's not broken and he knows what is going on in the world around him, and what people are, and (essentially) how to engage them.  He daydreams, true, but they are not the pathetic compensations of a man who is at heart a coward. That's not Walter's heart, which is clear from very early on in the film.  He's not looking out at the world through a fog of failure and weakness.  There's already a strength and perceptiveness in him from the beginning.  Therefore he's not a believable Walter Mitty, as Thurber portrayed him.

Secondly, the setup:  Small man discovers his Bigness by facing and overcoming trials of strength and courage, and winning the girl.  Well, in a sense that's the Hero's Journey, so that's OK, as a structure, but dangerously trite.  If it was done more straight, with earnestness on the part of the film, it would have been treacly awfulness.

Third, the Other Places and Other People as Route to Awakening.  That could have also been painfully done.  Really painfully.  I tend to avoid these film premises, so nothing comes to mind immediately as an example.  But the thought of the Wise Native makes me start gagging like a cat with a hair ball.  (Please don't go all Avatar, either.  In that film, it's the half-breed that saves the natives.)

But with all that, why does it work and how does it work?

I think Stiller's goal is essentially to present the feeling of the state of self-integration as a tone. It's that state which Mitty solidifies through facing himself, via following through with his quest. Stiller doesn't seem to care to present a map of the way there, in its details.  Unlike, perhaps, some 60's story of travel to India to find enlightenment, Stiller is not saying, ""Here's how you have to do it.""  He doesn't care about presenting a ""credible"" portrait of the journey that Mitty is on.  He's not bound to Mitty as the Thurber or the quest structure would seem to define the character.  Mitty, once moving (which, I'd argue, is from the moment he pushes Cheryl's ""wink"" button), is real, engaged, with depth, and with a power of his choices.  He doesn't waffle when he chooses.  Even in the bar, in Iceland, deciding not to go with the drunken helicopter pilot is not a craven choice.  It's actually quite rational and understandable not to go over a frozen body of water with a man you just met, who will likely pass out at the control of a several ton machine suspended off a whirligig.  That scene does not match with a character who is supposed to be a weak, ineffectual, daydreamy man.  His choice to go is not, then, overcoming cowardice, but rather, embracing audaciousness and chance.  That's very different.

Mitty's journey is not so much a depiction of transformation, as of coming out of pause mode (begun as a kind of shock reaction to his father dying when he was young).

So, if Stiller is not presenting a real depiction of transformation, or a map to courage and change, then why has he not failed?  If he uses cliched structures and plot devices, why does the movie not feel hackneyed and unearned?

Because, again, I don't think that's his intention.  The secondary characters--Cheryl, the helicopter pilot, Hernando the other negative assets guy, Todd at eHarmony, even Bearded Corporate Lackey--are too full and have too many moments that point to (even if not fleshed out) inner lives, which are not pre-programmed by the film's overt conventions.  There's too much interiority to these characters, who should, if the external structures (of quest, transformation, seeking-the-girl) be shells or ciphers, organized around Mitty.  But they're not.

Instead, the film gives a series of events, characters, and locations which are all tonally consistent. The beautiful mountains of Afghanistan, the starkly sumptuous Iceland and the rugged space of Greenland;  the quirky foreigners and sailors;  the fighting of a shark without totally freaking out; skate boarding down a scary-steep road;  outrunning a volcano.  They are all underlay by a tone, like a subliminal musical drone that colors all the overt notes, which, although those notes may adhere to a certain ""melodic"" structure, are fundamentally changed by the foundational harmonic, being the integration of the self with itself.

The encounter with Sean O'Connell is the keystone of this.  O'Connell should be the Wise Man on the Mountain.  He's a man of the Old Ways (he still shoots on film, is geographically enigmatic, and is unconcerned with money), who Mitty, literally stumbles over on top of a mountain, laying in wait to photograph the rare snow leopard (referencing Peter Mathiasson's book, The Snow Leopard, about a quest for enlightenment symbolized by the leopard).  The potential for rank kitsch is breathtaking.  Yet O'Connell is played, and directed, as an actual man, with his own particular interior that is not beholden to the external trappings of the character, but who is real, spontaneous, and wise in his way, without being a cloying prick about it.  He does not represent what should be striven for.  Rather, he's another of the film's elaborations on the felt quality of a state.

So, that's all why The Secret Life of Walter Mitty works, because it's not about what it looks like it's about.  Rather, it's a series and collection of ""carrier melodies,"" that allow for that underlying drone to be communicated, the tone of the state of self-integration, of an interior self that matches an exterior self.  The trappings are not the point.  The beautiful scenery and the foreigners in foreign lands are not the point.  The point is to have two hours of exposure to a state, which is your state, which is what the felt-sense of that integration is.  That's why it works.",1396137600,,8079,4.811320754716981

At first I thought X-ray was pointless, but I've actually come to enjoy using it. Particularly on films which I care about watching more than once.

Amazing is an understatement. I will have to say, I went in the movie with an open mind not expecting to believe all the hype. Believe the hype... or should I say pockets of hype as this movie did not receive many official accolades of which it is deserving. If you have ever traveled or wanted to get away and experience things that are new and familiar all at once... go see this movie. Its basically about an adventurous guy who had to grow up fast, put aside his true self while peering through someone else's adventurous spirit and his own daydreams to keep in touch with who he really is. The cliche that a small step leads to a big journey (or some variation of that) absolutely applies in this movie. The best part to me is the bit where Sheryl appears and starts singing Space Oddity. As I am typing this, I am thinking... what a perfect song! It is used against him with Adam Scott's character as if to say... ""Hey dude get your mind out of the clouds"", but then is used again when Sheryl sings it to him so that he can literally get in the clouds and begin his journey. It makes me think of the quote ""One small step for man one giant leap for mankind."" (In this case a giant leap for the life of Walter Mitty)  Totally apropos. The whole movie is filled with serendipitous and funny moments, as they often are when you travel abroad, or travel through life. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie.

That's how I would describe it as well. It touched something deep inside me -- maybe it was the ordinary life becoming extraordinary or the average person-in-a-rut reaching beyond his boundaries for something new and exhilarating. Maybe that's a commonality in all of us, that we want to dream and then have those dreams become a reality, to become braver than we ever knew we could be.

Philosophical, I know, but this movie is different from so many others. I didn't read any reviews prior to going, nor did I read any interviews with Ben Stiller, but it seemed to me that Walter Mitty is his masterpiece, something he put his heart and soul into, and it shows.

5813463,5,B00DHJT200,"I'm not a person who says that lightly. If you ask me for my favorite anything chances are I'll be stumped because I don't like to rank things like that. But this is different. This movie did things to me I can't even explain.

It's hard to really put into words what I love about the film, but I guess what it really comes down to is Walter himself. He's one of Ben Stiller's Awkward Nice Guy characters, but distilled into absolute perfection; his awkwardness is never over the top and always believable. I loved him from the very first scene, where he's pacing around his apartment trying to work up the nerve to click the mouse on his computer.

When Walter finally does have to take a big step out of his comfort zone, he does it himself. He's nudged, gradually, but ultimately he's the one who  makes the choice to grab his coat and fly to Greenland. And I guess that's why I found it so moving. This isn't a situation where a character is forced into a corner and has to react, or else; instead he's given a chance and a motive, and he's the one who decides to act on it. It's a relatively small victory in the grand scheme of most movies but to Walter it's huge.

But the most wonderful thing of all, I think, is the realization that even before the events of the film, when Walter was just a normal quiet guy doing his job without any variation in his daily routine, he was still admired for it, appreciated, and (you'll never convince me otherwise) loved.

I haven't even touched on the film's beautiful soundtrack and cinematography, or the fantastic supporting cast, or the fact that it has some genuinely hilarious moments, but that's all true as well. I saw this film seven times in the theater (a record for me) and I'm looking forward to watching the blu-ray even more.",1394841600,2,1785,4.413373860182371

5813465,4,B00DHJT200,"Ben Stillers Walter Mitty of 2013 bears a passing resemblance to Danny Kayes of 1947, and none at all to James Thurbers original creation (in which a hen-pecked husband, who inhabits a short story about five pages long, is sent out to buy overshoes and dog biscuits while his wife has her hair done). So those professional critics who complain (and some have) that Stiller doesnt capture Thurbers nuanced social commentary are talking through their hats.

Nor, as far as I know, did Thurber leave behind Tolkienesque appendices of the sort that might underpin the two hour rollercoaster on show. It is a story of derring-do, adversity and high-jinks only matched by the development trajectory of this script. In its decade-long passage through the hands of agents, writers, producers, studios and directors, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty was also dunked in the arctic ocean, shot at by Afghan warlords and abandoned in Himalayan wastelands, before falling for its final release into the loving arms of Ben Stiller who found himself not only leading the cast but directing the film as well.

Usually films with this sort of midwifery are a disaster. This ones a peach. Im inclined to give Stiller much of the credit, though I dare say Steve Conrads screenplay didn't write itself.

On a big screen, it is stunning. This is what Hollywood blockbusters should be like: imaginative, inventive, engaging, beautiful, sweeping, clever, well observed, well acted, and fun. Stiller demonstrates himself to be a subtler comic than many of his peers (Jim Carey was associated with this picture at one point) and an outstanding actor: his transition from biro-pocketed nerd in the basement to swashbuckling global explorer is a joy to behold. For a little guy with sticky-outy ears, he is a surprisingly credible leading man. There is real chemistry between Stiller and Kirsten Wiig.

That said, Walter Mitty is made by, features, and speaks to the people of a certain demographic - mine: mid-40s toilers who spend their private moments aghast that their lives are slipping away unremarked, and their public ones putting on brave faces and avoiding the inevitable conclusion that their toils might have been for naught.

This film counsels not just seizure of the day, but also that it hasn't been in vain: the beautiful, as Sean Penn remarks, don't ask for attention.

Ironically, Walter Mitty learns of his own beauty only when he flees his gilded cage. Only once he really has leapt from a helicopter into shark-infested water does he realise his life hasn't been wasted after all. (Special mention, by the way, to that Icelandic bear of a man lafur Darri lafsson, here the drunken chopper pilot, whose extraordinary performance in the recent Icelandic feature The Deep has to be seen to be believed).

Those not old enough to have acquired the humility to doubt their place in the firmament may find this all a little bit self-involved, but there will a big constituency among the rest of us for whom this film hits its mark. It is relentlessly big and beautiful: Stuart Dryburghs sparkling cinematography deserves as big a screen as you can find to see it on, and those receptive to its message will sit there for two hours with a big, dumb grin on their faces.

This movie depicts the life that most people I know live as few reach out and take hold of the opportunities that life has to offer.  We are lucky to live in a time when we can get on a plane and fly to so many places of adventure but most choose to play it safe and live their lives out through others most try to do it through their children and the rest do it within their own imagination.  I think this is the lesson that Ben Stiller's Walter Mitty provides us.  Life is to be lived and not imagined or observed.  We think that working at a job is THE LIFE GOAL but that is a GREAT LIE because until the past few generations humans have never worked a 40 hour work week or lived in a modern home and this is likely the reason so many turn to drugs and alcohol for their escape.  For most of us we must work to make the money so we can live adventures but most people do the first, they work all their lives but they fail to do the other, they fail to seek the adventure of life and for that reason Walter Mitty is a must see movie for anyone feeling their lives are not what they should be.

""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" reminds me of Stiller's  show on FOX when that network was just beginning. That show was brilliant, short-lived and pretty much forgotten.

Stiller is a remarkable talent, although he has often worked in stunted scenarios that allowed not much room for Ben Stiller to be Ben Stiller. This is Stiller being what Stiller wants to be. I saw this film because my daughter, after three cancelled flights back to Chicago, was in town another night. I suggested this film simply for something to do, and it was playing at the cheap place. Otherwise I probably would not have seen it, in a little bit the same way Walter Mitty would not have broken from his secret, imagined world had he not simply decided, for real, to go find an elusive photographer.

I'm afraid I have yet to read Thurber's story, but Stiller's adaptation is simply an admonition to get up off our butts and actually do something, especially something for which there is no app. With incredible landscape shots, snippets of cultures so very not American, quirky transportation, and at times a representation of digital technology serving people rather than enslaving us, he succeeds in a very fresh way. This film is also often very funny. I kind of feel sorry for those too cool for school folks who didn't or wouldn't plug in. It's disappointing this film was ignored awards-wise. It's at least equal to ""Twelve Years a Slave"" or ""Saving Mr. Banks,"" and has it all over something like ""Philomena.""",1392768000,2,1601,4.772563176895307

It's story is amazing, touching and well written. The visuals are profound and breath taking. Some scenes will definitely leave you tearing up. One warning about this movie is that when you see it you WILL want to travel the world. One other thing that will come out of this movie is you not wanting to miss out in anything during life, to live to your fullest and do as much as you can while you can. Overall a movie for the whole family that will appeal and bring a smile to everyone in the room. Cheers to Ben Stiller and the cast/crew, a well done movie!",1392681600,7,688,4.0661764705882355
5813474,5,B00DHJT200,"I went into this movie with one eye squeezed shut in preparation for what I hoped wouldn't be a modernized fart joke version of the Danny Kaye film, given Stiller's past performances such as Along Came Polly and Tropic Thunder.

I haven't read the book (though I swear, one day I will), but the Danny Kaye film has held a place in my heart as one of my family's favourite movies when I was growing up.  When I first learned that Stiller was directing and starring in this new, updated version of the story, I was skeptical that he would be able to pull it off with a straight face.  I wasn't expecting it to not have a few Stiller-esque jokes, but I wanted to see it done with the style and integrity I remember from the classic.  And while it's granted there was no tapoketa or musical breaks courtesy of an imaginary WW2 fighter pilot persona, I was absolutely blown away with the quality of the story, the cinematography and the acting portrayed in the film, as was my mom, who I took to see it on Christmas Day.

Kudos to Ben Stiller and the rest of the cast and crew for making this a surprizing and enjoyable film experience.",1392681600,7,1131,4.341232227488152
5813475,5,B00DHJT200,"Generally, people don't go and see the latest flick in theaters to eat overpriced popcorn and get irritated by the texting teens three rows in front of them. The common motive for moviegoers is to get lost in the plot of an absorbing film and escape their routine-oriented lives for approximately 90 minutes. What better way to escape monotony than by watching a movie about escaping monotony? The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is a beautifully crafted film that blends the genres of drama, romantic comedy, fantasy, and adventure, which results in an overall satisfying production to audiences of all ages.
 Based on the short story by James Thurber, the movie begins with Walter Mitty (Ben Stiller), a negative assets manager for Life magazine living a dull life, calling to inquire about technical difficulties with his eHarmony account. This phone conversation turns into the first of many elaborate daydreams that Walter experiences to escape the doldrums of his daily life, when he rescues a dog from an exploding building. The dog happens to belong to Walters love interest of the film, his coworker Cheryl (Kristin Wiig). These daydreams consistently occur, sometimes unexpectedly, keeping the audience on their toes as to what is reality and fantasy. However, these fantasies turn into a very real adventure for Walter as he goes on an epic search for the famous and elusive photographer Sean OConnell (Sean Penn) to retrieve a lost picture negative that is to be the cover of Lifes last print issue.
Some could argue that a blend of many genres might get confusing and leave the viewers lost sorting them all out. However, the director (also Stiller, how impressive) does an excellent job of merging the genres in a way that leaves the audience appreciating aspects of each one. Light humor is peppered throughout the film, lightening the serious, dramatic moments, as well as subsiding the adrenaline-rushes initiated by the wild fantasies and adventures. Stillers clear vision of a fun, yet meaningful adventure film is cohesive as these genres blend artfully.
 As Walter is living out his fantasies adventuring through Greenland, Iceland, and the Himalayas, encountering volcano eruptions and shark attacks, the remarkable cinematography of Stuart Dryburgh is displayed through gradual, purposeful camera movements that bring out the natural beauty of these locations while absorbing the audience into the action.
 As for the performances, Stiller is capable of moving the audience through his self-discovery and transformation to become a more confident man who lives life to the fullest. The brief romantic elements sprinkled throughout the film give the audience something to root for throughout Walters transformation. Both Stiller and Wiig, who we are used to seeing in less serious, comedic roles, charm the audience with their exchange sweet and sincere dialogue. Sean Penn makes a smaller appearance, as he is more so talked about throughout the film. However, he lives up to the talk with his performance of a nomadic photographer with an obvious deep connection and appreciation of his photos. With these solid performances leading the way, this movie reaches its destination of a meaningful and entertaining piece of work.
This movie explores the original idea surrounding the irony of a Life magazine employee who hasn't lived. This film inspires the audience to reflect on the times they didn't live, and inspires them to start: an added bonus to escaping for a while.",1392595200,4,3492,5.198934280639431
5813476,5,B00DHJT200,"To see the world, things dangerous to come to, to see behind walls, to draw closer, to find each other and to feel, that is the purpose of Life. Life Magazines quote from The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (directed by Ben Stiller) very accurately describes both the plot and the theme of the movie. The quote is also somewhat ironic as, in the film, the magazine is in the process of transitioning to an online publication called Life Online.

With a mind filled with wanderlust but stuck in New York at a job processing photo negatives for Life Magazine, Walter Mitty (Ben Stiller), is attempting to find a way to introduce himself to his coworker, Cheryl Melhoff (Kristen Wiig). This wish and more are granted when he is unable to find a film negative intended for the cover of the very last printed issue of Life Magazine. Leaving the country, he seeks to find the photographer, Sean OConnell (Sean Penn), and, in turn, find the negative, which Sean calls the quintessence of life.

Walter has an idea of how he wants to be, an adventurous, brave, and strong man, similar to the idea of a true man as society often defines. He is constantly made fun of by the transition manager (Adam Scott) for zoning-out, and he is even given the nickname Major Tom, alluding to the late 1960s David Bowie song, Space Oddity, about an astronaut alone in space, the kind of brave and adventurous person Walter wants to be.

Confidence plays a strong role in how someone behaves in life. Throughout Walters adventures, he more often picks the color red, instead of his normally dull colors, for his vehicles or clothes. This bright color was chosen for a reason. Red is a color which is used to grab ones attention, instead of sinking into the background, and often signifies confidence in ones self or actions. This is a very subtle, but clever, choice on the costume designers part, for its help in enhancing Walters newfound belief in himself and his ability to take risks and succeed.

This dramatic, adventurous movie has intuitively and strategically placed comedic lines and events placed throughout the script (screenplay by Steve Conrad) to aid in comic relief of more serious or somber parts. The moods of the scenes vary greatly from when Walter free jumps into the North Sea, his long adventure through the Himalayas, or when he and his partner are fired from Life.

While watching the movie, one can tell that each actor has thought about his or her character and carefully crafted a personality for their character and a certain rapport with every other character. The interpersonal relationships of the actors, the phenomenally developed special effects, and the interpretation of the screenplay create a work which surpasses the expectations given by the trailers.

Walter Mittys transition from an average Joe to a world traveler is able to give nearly anyone and everyone, including myself, a feeling of wanderlust and wanting to create their own adventure in their own, possibly stagnant, life. Thanks to this masterpiece, I am now scouring the globe for my own world adventure to change my own life, and possibly others for the better.",1392595200,2,3140,4.827137546468402

The men go out and have the adventures and life changing journeys while the female characters are either dotty mothers, single mothers doing it tough or crazy, single sisters.  Why are there no movies with women having these sort of adventures?  The scenery is fantastic and the locations amazing, but would have been a great film with stronger and more defined lesser characters.  As much as I wanted to really love this movie I can't help but feel as if Ben Stiller cast himself purely out of ego and not for the greater good of the film.  Nothing against Ben - he's a good actor but just not the best for this role. I couldn't help but feel that the movie could have been something really special but ended up being another film hijacked by a Hollywood ego thinking that they are the best at doing everything - in front and behind the camera - and not quite hitting the mark.",1391731200,3,1101,4.377450980392157

5813482,4,B00DHJT200,"I feel compelled to write this down because after a few internet searches I'm beginning to think I am the only one who gets this aspect of the movie or is the only one who cares. The whole thing takes all the design of the past eighty years and puts them into a blender, and I love it. The Life office headquarters look out of the '60s. The color scheme is black/ white/ beige/ powder blue. The lights are very bright and white. Again I want to say '60s. The clothes they wear aren't blatantly retro, but definitely  classic and therefore timeless. I guess it's a testament to how incredibly boring office fashion is.

Walter Mitty works with photo negatives. (In reality his job would have been cut at least ten years ago.) The equipment he uses looks fifty years old. Lots of chrome. Very art deco. The original story was written in 1939, I believe. Walter and his assistant, when they're in the basement wearing what they're wearing, saying what they're saying, and doing what they're doing.... they could BE in 1939 and nothing would need to be changed. Not even their outfits.

Walter Mitty spaces out and he gets David Bowie (popular musical artist of the 70s who is obsessed with outer space) quoted at him: ""Ground Control to Major Tom."" The song makes a later appearance, which I also loved.

His love interest's son is obsessed with skate boarding. Now I know there is a healthy skate board culture out there right now in 2014, especially in a big city. However, it also calls back to the '70s and the '80s when it was waaaaaaaaaaaaay more popular.

Walter's sister is an aspiring actress and she's involved in a local theatre production of Grease, a musical written (and popular) in the '70s but set in the '50s.

The street outside his love interest's house is lined with gas guzzlers from the 1970s at the earliest. Really cool cars, but there's no way anyone in that neighborhood is driving one of those cars in 2013. But it definitely gives a more working class vibe than yuppie, which I think is what they were going for.

There is a scene with a volcano and a plane that reminded me of the 1930s because of the style of the plane. Very Charles Lindberg and Amelia Earhart.

All that, and yet we KNOW that this movie is set in modern times because of eharmony, Cinnabon and iphones. That's really your only clue. Other than that it's completely timeless. And I really love that about it.

And the very end of the movie plays with smart phone culture a little bit. The whole movie plot is about finding this famous photographer who is an adventurous Ernest Hemingway type (another throwback to another time), and when he finally finds him in the mountains, Walter is talking on his mobile with the eharmony help desk guy.

""Buddy, do you mind? I'm working here,"" says the photographer played by Sean Penn. But in his mind he's thinking ""Jesus. I can't ever escape these people!"" And this guy is the biggest anachronism of all. He shoots in 35mm film. He doesn't have a mobile anything. He doesn't have a home address or even a bank account to direct deposit a paycheck into. He would have done very well in Hemingway's day. But Walter apologizes and they have a talk that ends up being a critique of modern life.

These days people can't even sit down to dinner without taking a picture of their food and broadcasting it over the internet. This guy is a professional photographer, always looking for beauty, and although he doesn't say ""You people and your GD smart phones"" he does talk a little about the perils of living life behind a viewfinder. Most of us don't daydream quite like Walter Mitty, but all of us should be able to relate to the need to put the GD phone DOWN.

Perhaps I am the only one who read it that way because I recently turned in my smart phone for a dumb one. To me it's just been an incredibly costly distraction.

Anyway. Bottom line. I loved this movie. I also know a little something about trading in your fun-loving youth to shoulder responsibility a little earlier than your peers, like Walter did. Anyone else who did too would probably love this movie as much as I did.  I will be purchasing it in HD on Amazon on Demand as soon as it's available.",1390348800,122,4195,4.502631578947368
5813483,3,B00DHJT200,"The film starts out catching the essence of Walter Mitty (Ben Stiller). Indeed watching Ben Stiller lament over pushing a ""wink"" button as if it would be a lifetime commitment. was great. Walter works for ""Life"" magazine and is on his way out the door with the final issue. He was sent a picture, that he cannot locate which embarks him on a very long un-Mitty like journey. While we all want our protagonist to succeed, the film became inane, lacking humor and purpose other than to circle around to the formulaic ending.

I had higher hopes for the film which under utilized Kristen Wiig so Ben Stiller's face can remain on the screen for just about the whole film. Having said that, it is a feel good film the whole family can watch and inspire everyone to jump out of helicopters into freezing cold shark infested waters so they can have something to put on their E-Harmony page.

It is not a bad film, just one I wish was scripted better so as not to be a Ben Stiller ego-fest.",1389657600,2,982,4.419889502762431
5813484,4,B00DHJT200,"This will be very spoilery, by the way, so be aware.

I think the movie starts out fantastically. There are all these moments where we shift into Mitty's imagination without realizing it until he snaps back to himself. It meshed well with my vague impression of the short story, and Stiller was great in those scenes. What I really liked, though, is the reaction from the people around Mitty. Especially the stuff from Ted Hendricks (played by the excellent Adam Scott).

Unfortunately, the daydreams get more and more fantastic as the movie goes along leading to an epic battle between Mitty and Hendricks through the streets of New York as they fight over a Stretch Armstrong doll. The power of the earlier scenes is that the daydreams are (mostly) normal. They are the kinds of things that anyone would wish they had done instead, things like asking the girl out or telling off your obnoxious boss. So, in the early movie, it's not always clear when he's gone off in his head until he snaps back to reality, and that stuff works really well. The fantastical stuff works less well.

Still, even the fantastic stuff, the superhero fights, would have worked well in small doses if the film had stuck to Walter Mitty being this guy that just goes off in his head. However, to make the point of the movie, Mitty eventually moves off into a real life adventure full of fantastic moments. Like, you know, getting attacked by a shark or skateboarding near a volcano while it's erupting. These things made me uneasy with the movie, and, although I was enjoying it, I wasn't fully enjoying it, because it just didn't feel right.

Of course, what I kept wondering was whether it was because it wasn't fitting with my perception of the short story.

To be clear, I enjoyed the movie well enough. I especially enjoyed the ending moment of the movie. But I was still feeling... unsettled... about the whole thing. Okay, that meant I needed to find a copy of the short story so that I could figure out if that's what was causing the issue. And I did that, and the short story and the movie are not really alike except that the movie takes the concept of the story and turns it into a movie. After all, the short story is only a few pages long and is about a trip into town with Mitty and his wife (Mitty has no wife in the movie. In fact, that is part of the conflict in the movie, Mitty wanting ""the girl""). There is no revelation in the short story that life is better lived than imagined.

The departure from the source material didn't really bother me. Well, there was some botherment in that the movie changed the point of the story, but, really, that was okay overall. But it was still bothering me. The movie, that is. After a lot of thought, it finally settled in me what it was:

The idea of the movie, which is right there on the poster, is that you should live your life, not daydream about it. And, really, I get that. There are those things that we should not just wish we did, you know, like ask out the girl. What's the worst that's going to happen, after all? She'll say no and you won't go out with her which you're already not doing so just ask her out already. However, telling off your boss is not necessarily the best idea in the world. Not if you want to keep your job.

Of course, part of the idea of the movie is that you shouldn't want to keep your job. Your job keeps you from the things you are dreaming about, so you should just take off and do those things. It's a message that's impossible for the ""normal"" person to do. I mean, here's the thing, in the movie, Mitty is this 40ish, single guy with much more money in his bank account than the average person. We do see that he's concerned with money and somewhat compulsive about tracking his money, but, really, he's doing okay and has thousands of dollars available to him, so, when he decides to take off, he's able to just do it. Most of us (I'd guess 99% of us) can't just do that kind of thing. And he's single with no kids. So, like, if I was a real jerk, I could just wipe out my family's finances, abandon my wife and kids, and go live life as the movie suggests. That's what it would take, ruining the lives of the people in my family. And that's where almost all of us are, and, I suppose, that's why the movie falls apart for me: it supposes that any of us can just (ought to, in fact) get up and do the things we've always dreamed about. And, maybe, some of us could. If we're real jerks. Because it would take abandoning our families, jobs, responsibilities to do it. Then, therefore, this idea of just taking off becomes another dream that we can't actually attain.

Not to mention that upon quitting your job and taking off, you suddenly become without an income source and, eventually, you're going to be screwed. I'm not thinking it's likely that it's going to be all that easy to get a new job when you just abandoned your previous job.

I suppose, in the end, I would have liked the movie more if it was actually about a guy that was constantly losing himself in his daydreams instead of being about a guy that learned to do the things he always daydreamed about. I think there was probably more to be said in the story they didn't tell rather than the one they did, one that is actually told all the time. It would have, at least, been kind of unique.

The acting was good, though. Stiller was great. I loved Adam Scott. Kristen Wiig was Kristen Wiig, which is great if you want Kristen Wiig in a role, because no one plays her like she does. Kathryn Hahn was also pretty hilarious. Sean Penn is... well, he's there, which is what he's supposed to be. Patton Oswalt was amusing; that whole story line is interesting and goes along with the idea of the movie which is both good and bad, I suppose.

The movie was enjoyable, for sure. It's good. It's just not great. I mean, telling people to live their dreams is all well and good -- I'm for that -- but, if that's going to be your message, I think you ought to tell people how to do that in a realistic way, because taking off for Iceland and all the rest of what follows is hardly something that's going to work out for most people.",1389484800,2,6172,4.34345186470078
5813485,5,B00DHJT200,"Ben Stiller is an interesting celebrity.  Hes built his career on playing the lovable dork, the guy who you cant help but like to be around but who cant help but screw everything up.  The general public embraces him, and he has yet to completely tarnish his career by following the career path of Adam Sandler (who was always a more abrasive and easily dislikable comedian to begin with).  Stiller has never been offensive in his film choices and yet hes never been all that adventurous either.  He kind of stays in a comfortable wheelhouse and rarely ventures outside of that box.

Looking at his film career from the standpoint of an actor is one thing, but looking at his career as a director can bring a different feeling.  Hes now directed five films, and they are all rather notable.  Reality Bites is a sincere film about those confusing teenage years (and it has some really identifiable social commentary), The Cable Guy was a huge moment for Jim Carry and continues to be considered a comedic cult classic.  Zoolander is one of the funniest movies of the aughts and Tropic Thunder (I didn't even know he directed that) netted an Oscar nomination for one of its stars.

Its a great list, but then The Secret Life of Walter Mitty comes along and brings something entirely new and different to the table.

I have not read the source material or seen the original film (from the 40s) but from what I gather this is a completely revamped adaptation and so it doesnt need to be compared to previous versions.  In Stillers Mitty, our protagonist, Walter, works for the ever-changing Life Magazine.  He is a man dedicated to his work and a man with little real life ambitions.  He doesnt seek out the true adventures in life and instead lives his life from a distance where he fantasizes about having the kind of life that other people actually live.  He has fallen for the new girl, but lacks the courage to approach her so he stalks her from an internet dating service that is having technical difficulties.  When he has a very important photograph placed in his hands, he finds his world beginning to shift.  The image is lost, his job is in jeopardy and his spirit soars with excitement as he chases the photography to the ends of the earth looking for the image.

In the heart of adventure, his life is reborn.

The message in The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is a simple one, dealt with rather simply and because of that it has a deeper impact.  Living your life isn't truly living if you never really live.  Does that make sense?  It does when you watch Stillers beautifully crafted film.  You can feel the energy that is displaced in all the right areas, creating a beautiful presence that pulls the audience along from scene to scene.  What I love about this film is that it doesnt make the film an advocate for literal adventure as much as one for the adventure of life itself.  While Mitty has his share of excitement traveling the globe, hiking mountains and swimming with sharks, the real adventure is not being afraid to reach out and grab the things you really want.  The real beauty in life is often taken for granted because we are expecting something else, something manufactured, and yet we don't realize how special the life right in front of us really is.

We are living with eyes wide shut.

Stiller direction is rather impressive.  He builds a beautifully languid story and finds ways to heighten our excitement with visuals that arouse interest and a fluidity that never shakes our interest.  I was actually blindsided with how effortless the whole film feels.  The comedic interludes, the heartfelt themes, the rich development, and subtle yet effective acting; all of it comes together and creates a unified and completely delightful film.",1389225600,146,3766,4.6707132018209405
5813486,5,B00DHJT200,"I've been inundated with rave reviews of ""Saving Mr. Banks.""  I was predisposed to loving it.  Tom Hanks.  Emma Thompson.  Mary Poppins.  The perfect storm.  On the other hand, I had heard very little about ""The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty.""  The poster caught my fancy.  I don't dislike Ben Stiller, but I've never put him in my A list either.  And Kristin Wiig?  Kind of weak in my opinion.  Still, James Thurber.  And that poster.  Intriguing.  I had no idea I was walking into a theatre to watch what turned out to be, in my opinion, the perfect movie.  From the opening titles to the very last frame, there was not a single misstep.  Yes, it was a fairy tale.  I''m a sucker for fairy tales.  But it walked a line between magical realism and a deeply truthful vulnerability laced together with laughs -- the kind of laughs that come from recognizing yourself in the mirror the story provides.  And Kristin Wiig was funny and strong and vulnerable and beautiful all at once.

Ben Stiller's performance was without flaw.  Completely understated.  No self-pity.  No grandiosity.  A man who slips into larger than life daydreams to find some meaning in his dreary life and ultimately by taking the enormous risk of acting out his dreams, he's able to give up the fantasy and live in the much more rewarding real world.

In a season where:  1.  Walt Disney is glorified over a neurotic, loathsome woman who finally makes peace with her childhood trauma of an alcoholic father -- and if the depictions of the affable, compassionate Walt and the odious P.L. Travers are true -- it nonetheless seems ungallant of the Disney organization to congratulate their founder on his fine character at her expense; and 2.  A man finds true love with an artificial intelligence because once again real women just aren't adequate to the job whereas computers, robots and software programs are true soul mates;  and 3. We celebrate the dysfunctional and distasteful relationship between a man with an exceptionally bad combover and his glamourous and equally morally bankrupt wife -- how can it possibly be that ""Mitty,"" this visually stunning film with characters you can weep for and cheer on, with a musical score that transports you and a happy ending to boot -- how is it that this movie is eviscerated by the critics while the others receive accolades?

Ben Stiller -- you hit it out of the galaxy.  This movie will be around long after people have forgotten the Wolf of Wall Street.  You have drawn us into a dream where we can face our own fears of inadequacy and with you triumph in the end, get both the girl and the cover of Life Magazine.  And see a snow leopard to boot.

Delightful performances by Shirley MacLaine and Kathryn Hahn were unexpected gifts.

It's a  metaphor, it's a  love story, it's a fairy tale, it's a visually spectacular story.  If it doesn't take the Oscar away from Mr. Disney, there is no justice in the world.",1389225600,20,2931,4.663405088062622

It starts off well, with the daydreamer daydreaming his way through some very rough moments, and doing himself no favors in the process. Then, it takes on a more magical and heroic aspect - but, at the same time, the distinctions between dreams and realities fall apart. Just how victorious were those moments of victory throughout the later part of the movie?

No matter, everyone should be the heroes of their own stories, as Walter most certainly is. Charming, even if baffling at times.

5813495,5,B00DHJT200,"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty came out of nowhere and is most likely here to stay. I first saw the trailer for this Ben Stiller comedic drama (or dramatic comedy perhaps?) before watching The Desolation of Smaug, and the unique mix of stunning visuals, inspiring music, and humor intrigued me if nothing else. Never being one for the mainstream comedy stars of today, I filed the film away under films I might check out eventually as opposed to the more urgent must watch area of my mind. But in the past week, when several friends mentioned the film to me in passing, and the opportunity presented itself to head to the theater, the decision was made to see Mitty in the spur of the moment. I hoped to be intrigued by this curious film that straddles the line between the epic and the absurd, but I never expected it to be so poignant, so enjoyable, so inspiring, and most importantly: so timely.

Evidently, Stillers Mitty is loosely inspired by a James Thurber short story, which was also previously adapted into a film starring Danny Kaye in 1947. I knew none of this until after watching Stillers version, so I really have no idea how to compare Stillers version to the previous incarnations of the story, but I do know that this new film is a remarkable achievement on its own merits. Both directed by and featuring Stiller in the title role, Walter Mitty is a negative assets manager for Life magazine who lives a rather mundane and boring life processing photographic negatives. He is single, has a secret crush on coworker Cheryl (Kristen Wiig), is about to lose his job as Life transitions to online only, is tormented by transition manager Ted Hendricks (Adam Scott), and regularly zones out, participating in fanciful daydreams of how he wishes his life would go. When he is tasked by famous photographer Sean OConnell (Sean Penn) with providing Life with the quintessential photograph of the photographers career, negative 25, only to find that it is missing, Walter Mitty is faced with the task of hunting down either photograph or photographer, which results in him stepping beyond the mundane and into a globe-trotting adventure.

Mitty works on a remarkable number of levels. The film is funny and clever, but also genuine and earnest. Walter Mitty is a wonderful character because, as he is played by Stiller, he is incredibly relatable. We have all been Walter Mitty at some point in our lives. We have all agonized over a crush, awkwardly fumbled over words with those we are trying to impress, felt as if we were going nowhere with our lives, zoned out for a moment and dreamed of some fantastic ending to the story that is the present moment, gotten fed up with that boss at work that places corporate goals and his own success above (what it seems to us) all human decency. We have all felt oppressively lonely in the midst of a large group of people. We have all looked to the far off horizons and longed not to simply read about that greater life we dream of, but instead experience it for ourselves. Stiller, in his portrayal of a man who feels lost in the cogs of modernity, a man who (ironically) is lost in Life, has hit upon the frustrations and longings of anyone who is human. We do not laugh at Walter Mitty. We laugh because we know his struggles, for we have all been in his shoes.

The first ten minutes of the film are brilliant, immediately prompting us to empathize with Walter as he fills out his checkbook in his bland apartment, then proceeds to agonize over sending a virtual wink to Cheryl on eHarmony. His finger hovers over the computer, quaking with anxiety. He is forced to wrestle with both his own lack of courage and technical difficulties before heading off to work, where a great emphasis is placed on how he is just one solitary office drone among many off to do the same drab thing. It is all brought to a head when he sees Cheryl at work, and we realize what a simple and yet profound statement Stiller is making about our increasingly technological world. For all of our increased social connection through technology, in the masses of people present in our cities, are we really any closer to each other than before? No, we are in fact more distant and separated. Yes, it is a question we have hopefully all asked ourselves before, but in its first act, Mitty draws attention to many of the gulfs so prevalent in modern life remarkably well, and slowly but surely (through the surprisingly profound motto of Life magazine itself) begins to expose us to a far better way of living, one that is far more satisfying than even the most fantastic of Walters daydreams.

When Walter ventures beyond New York, his journey in pursuit of the elusive photographer and photograph takes him to some of the most wondrous and beautiful places on Earth, and the cinematography and camera work is breathtaking. Just as Walter as a man begins to transcend his previous dull existence, Mitty as a film begins to transcend simply being a fun, interesting and empathetic film and grows to become a journey of profound discovery that is both poignant and epic. He encounters a remarkably interesting cast of characters on his way, and it is a joy to see Walter gradually realize that participating in the beautiful play that is life itself is not limited to the dream-world as he once believed.

I could continue to go on about the wonders of the story itself, but I fear spoiling some of the wonder of the discovery that Walter undergoes throughout his outlandish adventures. Mitty consistently pushes the bounds of reality, but only to a point that is pleasantly imaginative and quixotic. The acting is superb, and the music is not simply an accompaniment but an integral part of the story. The humor and daydreams are a delight because they are so real and relatable. We have all been Walter Mitty, and we all long to break out of the mundane life that the modern world hands us that feels soulless and bereft of meaning. Mitty tells us to step out into the wider world, pursue  our dreams; do not just observe life through the lens of the modern worlds fake social constructs and interactions (looking at you, social media), but participate in the beautiful.

By the end (or perhaps the beginning) of Walter Mittys adventure, however, we have also learned something else, something far more profound. Though we must transcend the mundane, there is a level of tediousness and disappointment that cannot be avoided. But even in what we see as pointless, boring, and drudgery, there is an opportunity to do something greater, to live a life of meaning and significance wherever we find ourselves, regardless of whether we are recognized, regardless of whether we are traveling the world as Walter eventually does. Even Walters childhood experiences and hobbies, seemingly insignificant, are revealed to have weight and importance. To see behind walls, to draw closer, to find each other and to feel,  that is the purpose of life wherever we are, and for bringing our attention to that profound truth in such an artful and entertaining way, we cannot thank the makers of The Secret Life of Walter Mitty enough.

FIRST... Walter Mitty (Ben Stiller) is not a photographer. He's in charge of handling the photos.
Second of all, product placement?!?! Really...
Because of papa johns? It's part of the story you twit! It was his first job after his father died.

5813497,5,B00DHJT200,"I saw this film in theaters earlier today, and I was absorbed into it from the first five minutes and continued to be entertained and surprised for the remaining two hours. It was funny, sweet, and inspirational. I felt really great walking out of it and knew I was going to pre-order it when I got home because I cannot wait to watch it again. I do not understand the hate out there for this movie and/or Ben Stiller. It was beautifully directed and Stiller's passion for the story was evident. I cannot recommend it enough.

Additional details: I have read the short story it is based on, and I have seen the 1947 film version. I think Walter Mitty's story is an everyman's. I enjoyed the 1947 film, but I really think James Thurber would be proud of Stiller's directorial update to the story. I haven't felt that happy coming out of a movie in a long time. Great soundtrack, great scenery, great humor. It all worked.",1388793600,14,920,4.476190476190476

5813499,4,B00DHJT200,"""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" is a drama and adventure film, which examines the introverted lifestyle of Walter, and his daydreaming of situations far removed from reality.

The escapades featured in the movie presents several important messages, including: overcoming fretfulness, self-discovery by spending time outside of comfort zones, and to surmount the obstructions life can present such as loss.

Despite Walter's setbacks an appreciation of a world of greater possibilities gives him a new energy.

5813500,5,B00DHJT200,"I'm not a fan of Ben Stiller so I was a bit hesitant in seeing this movie, but I don't regret it at all. The cinematography was great, and the movie was hilarious. The movie also had a good point to it, and i think many people can relate to Walter Mitty, although I don't think you need to buy into the cheesy ""meaning of life"" line the movie gives, but rather the underlying meaning in the movie. The only real downside to the movie was the occasional, mild off color word or remark that really served no purpose in the film.

5813501,1,B00DHJT200,"March Boy nominations: Visual Effects and Cinematography

Hate is a strong word--it's got some fine technical features going for it. Some of the shots look REALLY good (it should get an Oscar nomination for the cinematography) and the visual effects are excellent--especially the volcano--but there really isn't much of a story to tell and the characters are about as paper thin and one-dimensional as you can get because the screenwriting never really scratches under the surface and we never get to know them very well. A photographer gets bored with his dull, uneventful life and goes on a vacation to Greenland, inspired by his wild imagination. And that's basically it. The quote on the mountain about the purpose of life is just fancy, pretentious, empty words that bear no deep, thought-provoking or philosophical meaning. Plus the sexual jokes--like the one about the volcanic eruption--added nothing useful to the script and were merely included to appeal to a lazy, unrefined and uneducated audience. The fat slobby drunk pilot who couldn't articulate worth a flip was not remotely funny at all. Don't even get me started about the scenes with the toy rubber man.

Thumbs down. Stay away from this one.",1388534400,25,1212,5.085427135678392
5813502,5,B00DHJT200,"Normally the Hollywood machine would cast the current A list boys and girls and the plot would go like this: Mitty, who is very introverted and shy would have zone outs because he has no life so he is always fantasizing these wild adventures. But since he is a virgin his buddies dare him to tell off the boss and quit the job and go party. That would take up the first half an hour and then as he has more and more fun the fantasies get broader and more spectacular ( if only to show off the amazing special effects). And in the last ten minutes he realizes what he really wants is the girl he is secretly in love with and the biggest daring move he finally gets the nerve to ask her out.
But.....that is not what happens in THIS film. In fact, without spoiling it THIS film does pretty much the opposite! And you know what? It works! No naked boobs. No sophomoric fart jokes. No F Bombs. There is one brief super hero type fight sequence but it isn't really violent. Take the family- its great. Mr. Stiller...I'm a fan from Ohio. LOVED the film and I wish you continued success.

5813513,5,B00DHJT200,"If I didn't know the Danny Kaye 1947 movie of the same name, I wouldn't have paid any attention to this one after seeing the trailer.  This movie is much funnier than the trailer made it seem.  (The trailer was one of the most incoherent I've seen in a while, and that's saying a lot, since many trailers today are hard to make any sense out of.)  Based on James Thurber's short story of the same name, both Walter Mitty movies resemble the short story only in that Walter's normal life keeps getting interrupted by daydreams.  The Danny Kaye movie's daydreams are entertaining but not ridiculous, while in this one, the daydreams get really ridiculous, a great outlet for Ben Stiller's quirky face and quirky sense of humor to be used.  Another point of interest is that while in the 1947 movie, Danny Kaye is a mama's boy who is nervous, Ben Stiller in this is deadpan for the most part.  About to lose his job, which is his only social life, he ends up going on an adventure around the world to try to save his job, and develops a mild romance.  (Someone as emotionally detached as him can't get too romantic even if the plot were to let him.)  Along the way there are a lot of incidents that work perfectly for Ben Stiller's quirky humor.  Sometimes it's the randomness, sometimes it's the ridiculousness/implausibility, and sometimes it's the timing, but the humor really worked for me in this movie.  I'm never able to say why it does or doesn't, but perhaps the best explanation in this case is that Ben Stiller directed his own movie.  Also, like Don Knotts, he uses his awkward-looking face as a major part of his comedic persona.  I think Stiller's funnier in this than Night at the Museum.

My only point of criticism (besides that it added a few words to get a PG rating--I still don't understand why the rating, rather than merits, of a movie is supposed to bring in money) is that the pace and comedy both slackened significantly in the second half, though thankfully didn't die.  If comedic creativity had been at work more in the second half, it'd have helped the pace and kept the mood energetic and spontaneous.  However, the end is rewarding.  It's interesting that I just saw Saving Mr. Banks and thought from the trailer that it'd be a comedy when it was more of a drama, while this has much more humor and didn't seem as serious to me as the trailer made it seem.",1388275200,7,2385,4.4988399071925755
5813514,4,B00DHJT200,"I went to see the The Secret Lift of Walter Mitty on a whim as I tend to like Ben Stiller's sense of humor.  I really liked this film.  Ben Stiller is a 42 year old man, Walter Mitty, living a responsible life, but feeling inadequate, which is evidenced by his difficulty in approaching Cheryl Melhoff (Kristen Wiig)  with whom he is smitten.  Walter's life changes when he decides to find the missing negative for Life's final magazine issue.  His decision leads to a series of adventures with some unexpected twists and turns.  His trek is punctuated with his fantasies (e.g. his secret life).  Walter ""zones out"" into fantasies where he is the hero to Cheryl's damsel or the recipient of wisdom from Cheryl or others in his life.  These mental interludes punctuate the story line adding some funny and poignant moments.

In reading reviews of this movie, I thought some reviewers were viewing the movie too literally.  While the movie was not true to Thurber's vision, and for those who expect a faithful depiction of Thurber's work would, legitimately, be disappointed, the previews clearly communicates the movie's divergence from the originally story line, thus, limiting viewers' remorse.  Otherwise, I think the film captures the feelings of many men.  Walter is hitting his midlife crisis, drifting into his own world momentarily to bolster his eroding self-image and as honey to swallow bitter interactions between himself and his manager.  However, Walter moments also reflect his sub-conscious urging him to reach for something more, and the importance of the lost negative to his continued employment and to Life's final edition only serve to remove any remaining barriers to ""going for it"", leading to an entertaining adventure to breath-taking places. His adventures are linked together by seemingly disparate actions that weave together in surprising ways to complete his story.

There are incongruities, such as Icelanders that do not know English, but these imperfections do not detract from the kindhearted interactions between Walter and those he encounters underlining the idea that people are connected by their natural impulse to help each other.  Walter's adventures are not just about his liberation through overcoming obstacles as he pursues his goal, it is about the humanity he discovers in the large and small things other do to help him on his way.  Walter experiences, first hand, the beauty, not only of the world, but the sublime connection we share with each other through acts of kindness.

The Secret Lift of Walter Mitty may be a little schmaltzy and it is definitely a movie to make one feel good, but the former does not detract from the movie's charm, and the latter is no sin when making a comedy.

5813515,1,B00DHJT200,"Sorry, but the product placement was so blatant it ruined the illusion of the story. Let's face it, unless your making a documentary all filmmaking is based on creating good illusions, like a talented magician! When a particular fast food company that serves gross food infects a story - like a flu virus - it wrecks the fantasy created by the filmmakers! James Thurber would be spinning in his grave!

Such product placement is totally unnecessary unless the producers of the film felt The Secret Life of Walter Mitty was going to be a big flop. Or, those making the film want to squeeze every last cent they can to make money by treating filmmaking like a commodity, such as toothpaste or underarm deodorant! Hey, that's a great idea, since we get to know over and over again Walter Mitty's favorite crappy fast food restaurant, why not let us know what his favorite toothpaste and underarm deodorant are, too?!! And why stop there? Let's find out his favorite type of paper towel, toilet paper, laundry detergent, car, soda, vodka, beer and on and on. I even have a new idea for a title: ""The Secret Product Placement Life of Walter Mitty.""

I didn't pay $11.50 for a ticket and another $6.50 for popcorn to repeatedly watch and hear the characters talk about commercial products in the middle of a movie. The product placement in this film was not subtle and I didn't appreciate being forced to watch such nonsense!

5813517,4,B00DHJT200,"I like Ben Stiller for both the far-out characters he gives us in films such as ZOOLANDER and DODGEBALL and his can't-get-a-break regular guy parts in flicks such as ALONG CAME POLLY, THE HEARTBREAK KID, THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY and MEET THE PARENTS. Playing the title character in his 2013 remake of THE SECRET LIFE OF WALTER MITTY, at first Stiller seems to be the latter as the man who gets so lost in his imagination he fails to apply it to the situations that inspire it.  However, without giving away the story, I'll say when Mitty leaves New York City and what we see next is in the mind of the director Stiller as opposed to that of the man played by him, give THE SECRET LIFE OF WALTER MITTY credit for daring to challenge the audience with something I, for one, would not have expected.

THE SECRET LIFE OF WALTER MITTY will get you to root for Walter Mitty as you see him pursue what you thought he may have been content to just visualize.  I just wish it had a little more of Adam Scott as the super-jerk boss Ted, the character we root against.  But there is just enough of Sean Penn as a legendary photographer Mitty must find to save his job; a lesser film would have had the two team up once Mitty at last locates him but instead the great actor exits as cagily as he entered, no aura lost.

Finally, THE SECRET LIFE OF WALTER MITTY ends with as good a payoff as you will ever see. A lesser film would have made it all about Mitty getting the woman he secretly loves but with all we see the man go through, he deserves even better and gets it.",1388102400,10,1563,4.249158249158249
5813518,3,B00DHJT200,"""My second time seeing a cinema-released film on Christmas Day since Django Unchained last year. What would you make out of life if you lived in a dream-like, lucid state of mind? Well, Ben Stiller responds to this question with this esoteric, psychedelic or hippie-influenced, and quirky remake of the 1947 film of the same name and film adaptation of James Thurber's magazine story. Ben Stiller as Walter Mitty seems like an earnest choice since his character, remembering from some clips and pre-evaluated knowledge, is not over-the-top, raunchy, or stoned as today's comedic actors would come across.

Stiller evokes a sort of Truman Show-esque vibe to this character and his peculiar episodes dealing with his dreams, his love interest, and adventures through Iceland, Greenland, and the Himalayas. Mitty is done in a way, and with some of the film's choice of environment and place, like an 80s or 90s film where there the technology is there but it feels minimalist and too kind to be out-there and a bit too rough and stylised to be considerably respectable to the older generation. Given this element, I found myself laughing little in this film but being intrigued by the cinematography and oddball events that Mitty encounters more than the humour alone. The Iceland and Greenland scenes were well-done and the beginning scene (which is cleverly done comedy by being subtle) but the scenes set in the Himalayas and elsewhere felt a bit stale and overlooked.

The plot does feel a bit loose too with scenes going on for quite a few minutes without any kind of intriguing traction or element of suspense and emergency which adds to the good but not always brilliant ""hippie/psychedelic"" label to this film (not to say, the excellent choice of David Bowie, nature shots, quotes of strength, and other pieces of music in it). It did not help that the film used the same title twice which could be an editing error in the opening credits and I honestly wish there could have been more dream sequences or ending the film like it was a dream as that concept flew over the cuckoo's nest 1/3 into the film. The possibly perceived anti-corporate, anti-TSA/pro-privacy, pro-nature, pro-culture message might be off-putting to some but it was done within the confines of exploring out of your surroundings and feeling life for what it is almost like a travel guide on Globe Trekker or a crazy episode of Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations but without the food or all-out vulgarity.

One thing that intrigued me more (not just how much product placement there was which was something that didn't bother me really but it was funnily done) was the PG rating (which is more appropriately granted here than a PG-13) for this film given it has no kid appeal and features language (ass, hell, damn) and adult humour (a heroin and genitalia joke) which might scratch parents' heads more for a PG than if it was another animated work from Disney or DreamWorks. Aside from that, I probably might have missed this film if it was not for the PG curioso element to a film that looks like it would be another commercial PG-13 film aimed at adults these days. As a film, it works to be a modern-day homage and it does its job and does not squirm on over-the-top elements here which add to the film's dryly comic yet ultimately dramatic presentation.

It also works by allowing you feel like in a place other than somewhere else which is ultimately what Christopher Nolan's Inception did three years ago but considering how overrated and confusing I though of it, Walter Mitty (the two versions included, 1947 and 2013) was better done with the lucid concept. I watched this film during Christmas day knowing of a family relative's respect and admiration for the original and being from the new generation, I gave this title a chance and I was not disappointed as much as some of the critics have said. It was far from perfect but it was nicely done and the Iceland/Greenland scenes were worth the admission at least and the PG curiosity to it.""",1388016000,6,4027,4.7982708933717575

5813520,5,B00DHJT200,"We brushed aside the critic reviews and saw this movie on Christmas Day.  Five of us walked into the theater to be entertained (fingers crossed), five of us walked out captivated.  This is a stunning movie that uses the story, the scenery and a beautiful score to weave a spell around you and whisk you away to a dream that you wish would go on and on.

Slightly over two-hours long there wasn't a moment that I yawned, stretched my legs and thought about hitting the loo.  This movie was mesmerizing.

Ben Stiller's understated performance as Walter Mitty is outstanding.  I daresay, in my opinion, this is his best performance to date.  Kristin Wiig's performance is gentle and sweet.  It's so exciting to see Wiig outside SNL as an actress who can hold her own.  The other characters, including Adam Scott (the man you'll love to hate) and Sean Penn (the man you'll either love ~me~ or want to be) are also well done.  Scott is a bit over-the-top as the 'bad guy' but he has to be for this whimsical, fairy tale-esque story.  Personally, I thought his weird beard worked because this is very much a fairy tale.

Equally important to the fine performances are the locations - the scenery is breathtaking, and the musical score.  One scene where the music plays equally to the acting is just transcendent.

This is a movie I will pay to see again at the cinema before it's gone.  This is a Blu Ray that I will purchase for my personal library.  This is a movie that is now in my top five favorite movies of all time.",1388016000,549,1517,4.461818181818182

It's the kind of experience I was expecting to get from Gravity and didn't. I was shocked. This is partly due to the fact that I am not the world's biggest Ben Stiller fan. Slapstick comedy is a delicate thing for me, and I certainly don't enjoy it if I am watching the comedian copy someone else's decade's old jokes (which is more often the case then not).

This movie is a work of art. The critics hated it. It is a true journey of heart, mind, and soul, and the movie is not simply about a man that wants the attention of this one girl. It's about a man waking up and experiencing life after having put it to the side for years to do the right thing for his family. Amazingly cast. Floored (and astonished) by Ben Stiller's acting and direction. I give this an 8.5 on IMDb, and that's more than I gave Temple Grandin. I will have to own this one (which means shell out good money for the bluray), and I'm guessing I'll end up buying many copies, as I did for Time Traveler's Wife (the book, not the horrible movie) because I must give a copy to everyone that hasn't experienced it.
