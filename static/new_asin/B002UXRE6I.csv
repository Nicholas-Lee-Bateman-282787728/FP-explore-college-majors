3993628,3,B002UXRE6I,"The label says 4 to 10 yrs, but I really do not think it would hold the attention of children over 6 yrs. I, personally, also do not care for the songs, and feel as though the DVD would not really be an edifying supplement to my younger students' lessons. This will be returned.",1377907200,2,278,4.166666666666667
3993629,2,B002UXRE6I,My 5 year old is taking piano and she and her sister thought this was so boring. We didn't watch more than ten minutes of it. I will keep looking to find something for her,1377734400,,171,3.914285714285714

Now, she has knowledge and recognition of musical concepts that I wasn't sure how to go about teaching to a 2 year old.  Concepts such as the treble clef, musical notes, middle c ... etc
EXCELLENT beginner piano video!!",1355011200,2,280,4.384615384615385
3993631,5,B002UXRE6I,"The video is very good, it is cartoon characters which really kept my 5 year old engaged. I think the information is a little bit complex, but in my case that is a good thing because I don't want him to master the DVD the first time he watches it. I think it is great for what it is, I only wish they had a larger series covering more about the subject. I will have to say the materials on the DVD are very catchy, and my son loves watching it. There is also some song choices at the end. 30 minutes is a bit short, but it seems longer wit the menu of all the songs at the end. There really is nothing else out there like this from what I can see.",1346976000,2,647,3.8358208955223883
3993632,4,B002UXRE6I,I bought this DVD for my 4 year old son after he expressed an interest in the piano. It is a great way to introduce the piano and music theory to a child. The songs are catchy and and the images are pretty fun. I am so glad I bought this!,1333843200,3,238,3.6862745098039214
3993633,2,B002UXRE6I,The quality of this video is exceptionaly poor.  Our 2.5 year old seems to love it but it makes me want to tear my eyes out. The voice of the main character sounds like a robot and is very annoying.  I would look else where for a piano DVD.,1327708800,2,240,3.877551020408163
3993634,5,B002UXRE6I,I bought this for my 4 year old and she loves it...I even enjoy watching it.  The cartoon is cute and the songs really help her learn the material.  If your child loves to sing then I highly recommend this video.  It teaches the child everything they need to know to start reading music and it is fun!  It is worth every penny.  The only downside is the video does not teach your child to play any songs but it does teach them the basics of reading music.  It would be great if they could throw in a simple song at the end.,1307577600,11,523,4.029126213592233
3993635,5,B002UXRE6I,"My daughter is 3 years old. She started traditional music lessons about three months ago but was progressing very slowly. As I put on the DVD the very first time she did not want to take it off. The presentation is very good and she not only loved it but music suddenly made sense. I watched it with her and even I found it entertaining, easy to learn and remember the notes on the staff and the positioning of the first 7 notes on the piano.
I would love to get this in a series for my daughter to learn everything about music. It certainly makes it easy for anyone to learn but especially for young kids. Also the style of teaching allows you to watch it like a movie and remember the lessons for when you go on the piano at a later time. There is no need to have the piano in front of you while you learn.
I highly recommend this DVD to all parents with young kids who are about to learn piano and music for the first time.",1304726400,8,926,4.065573770491803
3993636,3,B002UXRE6I,"My kids at 6 and 9 enjoyed the dvd, but were just old enough to find it somewhat slow and boring.  I would not buy this for a child older than 5.",1293840000,4,145,3.53125
3993637,4,B002UXRE6I,"Compared to what I found available on the market; Trebellina and Dot this one is the best. The pace is fast enough to keep my son (16 months)engaged. It moves along the lessons in a relaxed way that takes it out of context to allow digestion, such as bus rides and preparing snacks. It is paced well and the songs are catchy. I would recommend the purchase.",1289952000,6,357,4.343283582089552
8381609,5,B002UXRE6I,My 3 year old daughter loves Suzie. She asks for her all the time and sings along. Great intro to piano.,1448150400,,104,4.0

8381611,4,B002UXRE6I,Very good and fun dvd. Got it for my 5 year old. It teaches good basics but she got intimidated towards the end of the dvd. She's absorb in a lot though !,1426896000,,154,3.696969696969697
8381612,1,B002UXRE6I,I wish I had known before I bought this that one of the main characters has a speech impediment. It is not productive for a child who is struggling to pronounce their R's correctly. I will be searching for another product and putting this one in the trash can.,1425081600,2,260,4.326530612244898
8381613,3,B002UXRE6I,"I am going to mostly base my review on other products in the market (for children).  Be careful with the price of this one, because honestly it is not worth it (for the price I paid).  First I will explain why this DVD falls very short from my expectations.  I have a son who is taking piano lessons who occasionally needs to be reminded a few basic things.  Comes the supplementary videos like this one to help with that.  He found this DVD to be totally awesome.  Lots of songs, lots of music, very entertaining and catchy (and he is 8 years old and autistic, catching an autistic child's interest is hard).  However I also found that he is equally as interested in ""Piano With Dot""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Piano-with-Dot-The-fun-way-for-kids-to-learn-piano/dp/B0017SZ9FA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Piano with Dot.  The fun way for kids to learn piano.</a>&nbsp;which is a better version (slightly older made by the same company) DVD.

Suzie's DVD focuses on Treble Clef (just as the ""Piano with Dot"" DVD) however the biggest disappointment I got was that it only covers an octave and that's it.  I watched the whole thing, and it begins by telling the kids that there will be a set of ""two black keys"" to the left of their piano, followed by a set of 3 black keys.  Our piano is a 76-key piano and has 3 black keys to the left and then 2 right after.  Luckily my son wasn't affected by this as much, since he has been taking piano lessons for 6 months so far.  This, however will create an awful lot of confusion in other children, and/or parents who might want to help their kids learn to play piano.

Transition from ""one lesson"" to the next, consists of a bunch of cut-scenes (and eye-candy) that are time consuming (I can think of the one in which Suzie goes to the kitchen and tells Melody that she needs to eat healthy food to announce the next note [which happens to be ""E""] as the ""number 1 note of the treble clef"") that's kinda cute sure but at 30 minutes, a lot of time is lost.  ""Piano with Dot"" is more ""blunt"" and to the point, so one hour of playtime gets you a lot of more work done (all you need to do is watch in parts with your child and appear interested)!  Suzie's ends as soon as she announces all the notes in that fashion...

Piano with Dot teaches you about other musical terms: Piano (soft), Forte (strong), Allegro (fast), Adagio (slow)... overall don't expect that to be included in Suzie's DVD.

None of the above mentioned cover the Bass clef, however what I believe happened was that the company probably was trying to make a shorter more simplified version of a piano educational DVD, and that perhaps they intended to make more DVDs future wise.  Suzie's Piano Primer would be perfect if it was part of a set that eventually covered everything in ""Piano with Dot"" and then Bass Clef.  Overall incomplete.

I've also tried the ""eMedia My Piano DVD"" and might give 4 stars on that one, I don't see it on Amazon without the Keyboard bundle.  But overall I'd say those are the ones available these days (aimed at kids only), unless you want to fork out $150 and get something like: ""Learn & Master Piano"" home-school edition, which I keep hearing great reviews on (recommended for children and adults as long as they're serious about learning piano).  Good luck everyone.",1423267200,7,3354,4.686006825938566
8381614,4,B002UXRE6I,seems fun for my little one to watch,1420675200,,36,3.625
8381615,3,B002UXRE6I,I was hoping for more note teaching she only teaches about 5 notes.  The rest of the movie she teaches other basic piano things.  It was okay.,1407628800,,142,4.222222222222222
8381616,4,B002UXRE6I,"This video is VERY basic in every way. The animation and storyline are pretty low-budget, but the songs do exactly what we want, which is help our 4-year-old to memorize the basics of the treble clef. It's a great start for him, and the bonus is that it keeps both his AND his little brother's attention for the duration! The only thing I really cringe about is that the Melody character has a speech impediment, which may have some unintended affects in impressionable young kids. I don't know why they chose to do that. I'm glad my kids haven't started imitating her.",1403827200,,569,4.588235294117647
8381617,5,B002UXRE6I,"I give this video 5 stars in the very specific context of my situation.  I have a 32 month old to whom I am trying to spark an interest in playing piano.  Just a week or so before, I placed the note stickers on our keyboard for him and only casually have started pointing out the notes.  Anyways, this video only covers the notes on the treble cleff staff, both how to read them on paper and where to find them on the piano.  That's absolutely it.  If your child knows this most basic information, he or she will not learn anything from this video.  But, aside from the slim amount of information it delivers, it is quite entertaining for my 2 year old and he has asked to have it played over and over and over again.  The songs are catchy and the animated characters, Suzie and Melody, are quite endearing.  I'm not sure how well this video would go over for an older child.",1397001600,2,875,4.228915662650603
8381618,5,B002UXRE6I,"It's educational, my 3 year old loves it and the music is catchy. perfect for a 3-4 year old. I'm 31 and even I feel like I learned a thing or 2.",1390608000,,145,3.5625
