3841537,5,B0021SGO6I,"I watched the original movie ""The Fighting Sullivan's"" waaaaay back in the early 1990's on the TMC channel.  It was a real tearjerker ..a great movie!  I came here looking for it to watch again on netflex but decided to come to Amazon and found this.  The seller whom I bought this from told me that this is the movie that ""Saving Private Ryan"" was LOOSELY based on!  Never knew that..Never saw SPR and have no desire too (don't like Hollywood fake BS movies)..This is a tremendous documentary about the family and the events that followed..very very sad and I wouldnt doubt that you will shed a tear or 2..love this!",1289606400,18,617,4.531531531531532
3841538,5,B0021SGO6I,This film causes one to think of what love of country means and what sacrifice was made for us by many military people like the Sullivans.,1254528000,18,138,4.346153846153846

3841545,5,B0021SGO6I,I enjoyed this film very much.  It provided new information which is unknown to the public by just watching the screen movie.  I was surprised to know they were not the only family siblings who went to war together even if they are the most famous.  I highly recommend this video.,1414713600,2,280,4.450980392156863
3841546,4,B0021SGO6I,Good movie but the part at the races not right 2 of the brothers were in the navy at that time and could not have been there also 4 brothers died instantly on that night the forth had been wounded the day before he survived 5 days in a raft waiting for help to arrive infact about 100 men survived the sinking,1410566400,,309,4.0

3841548,3,B0021SGO6I,this was not quit what I was expecting.  But it is a fairly good accounting of their lives.  It is good for history reference.,1378339200,,126,4.208333333333333
3841549,5,B0021SGO6I,"The history of the five Sullivan Brothers and USS Juneau CL-52 shipmates lost during ""The Battle of Guadalcanal"" in November 1942 reminds us of the sacrifices made by our military to protect our freedom and defeat Japan in WWII.
I proudly served aboard USS The Sullivans DD-537 (destroyer named after the five Sullivan Brothers by FDR in 1943) in 1964.  The ship was retired in 1965, and is a National Historic Memorial moored at the Buffalo NY Naval & Military Park.  The History Channel documentary of the five Sullivan Brothers and USS Juneau is excellent.",1373068800,4,559,4.873684210526315

3841553,5,B0021SGO6I,"This video is about the five Sullivan brothers that were all killed together during World War II. On November 13,1942 they were all serving aboard the USS Juneau, when a Japanese torpedo struck the ship and all five were lost along with 395 others. It's a documentary and a little different then the Hollywood movie version which is still one of my favorite old movies.  It was worth watching and is in color and B&W.",1354665600,5,417,4.56
3841554,5,B0021SGO6I,"I grew up believing the 5 Sullivans were all killed at one time while searching for their wounded brother. Hollywood had me fooled!

I had to order the movie, couldn't find it anywere...Blockbuster did order it for me on VHS but, now I need to find this on DVD and haven't been able to find the same movie by Ivy Classics on DVD.

3841558,5,B0021SGO6I,"Sent it as a gift and the recipient, who had seen the movie, loved this video!  Was surprised by the amount of information which was left out of the movie or changed.
