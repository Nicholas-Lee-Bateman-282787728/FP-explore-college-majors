8444916,4,B004WCSMHA,"This ""collection"" is comprised of the 1998 and 2003 ITV-A&E co-productions of the Thomas Hardy novels TESS OF THE D'URBERVILLES: A PURE WOMAN and THE LIFE AND DEATH OF THE MAYOR OF CASTERBRIDGE: A STORY OF A MAN OF CHARACTER.  Although written in 1891 and 1886, respectively, the stories are both set in the middle of the 19th century in rural England.  Both TV movies were adapted by Ted Whitehead (a Hardy scholar) with Sally Head at the helm as executive producer.

TESS OF THE D'URBERVILLES: 3 & 1/2 stars

This story is about Tess Durbeyfield (portrayed by the unconventionally beautiful Justine Waddell), a simple farm girl, who is wooed by first Alec d'Urberville (Jason Flemyng, who looks every bit the rogue), Tess' wealthy, distant relation (can't be more specific here) and then farmer-in-training Angel Clare (Oliver Milburn - another good casting choice).  Like all of Hardy's protagonists, Tess is, to some extent, the ""plaything"" of fate, and her tragedy is all the more sad becuz she is - as is stated by the novel's subtitle - a ""pure woman"".

The acting, sets, locations, and music of this production are good.  Unfortunately, either Whitehead or director Ian Sharp took it upon himself to give Tess flashes of sarcasm or assertiveness that didn't appear in the novel, which alter Hardy's depiction of the ""pure woman"" who was more resigned to her fate (the blame, however, for the good but far from stellar performance of Waddell - who was terrific in WIVES AND DAUGHTERS - can certainly be attributed to Sharp), and one of the sources of conflict that leads to Tess' act of retribution against another character near the end of the story had been revealed to her much earlier in the novel, a change made, perhaps, to provide a greater sense of betrayal and drama.  Also noteworthy about this adaptation is that it features a narrator, whose sometimes awkward insertion into the story cost this movie at least 1/2 a star in my eyes. (Another problem with this production is one that I just can't put my finger on: either it's the choice of film stock used [or whatever the technical term is] or that it seems as if the movie was shot in wide screen and then someone decided to release it in full screen becuz something just isn't ""right"" about the way it looks.)

All in all, though, this is an entertaining movie (and, IMO, is superior to the 2008/9 BBC tv serial - at least in regard to the casting of the pricipals).  Incidentally, the running time for this adaptation is around 175 minutes and, as it aired on A&E in either three one hour episodes or two 1 & 1/2 hr segments (can't remember), there is at least 20 minutes of footage here that wasn't aired during the tv broadcast.

THE MAYOR OF CASTERBRIDGE:  5 stars

As noted by the novel's subtitle, the Mayor of Casterbridge, Michael Henchard (wonderfully brought to life in all his glory by the magnificent Ciaran Hinds), is a ""man of character"", by which Hardy means a ""very human"" man.  Henchard's great hubris is his pride and other powerful emotions, which lead him to often react to those in his life in very rash, insensitive, and (self-)destructive ways.  Although the fates play a large role in the events of his life, it is Henchard himself who determines his life's course.

Hardy contrasts his protagonist with Donald Farfrae (nicely played by Hinds' future ROME castmate, the handsome James Purefoy), who is befriended by the mayor, but later becomes his business and political rival, and who is pragmatic and unemotional; indeed, he is so detached that when he does appear to display feelings, it is often more a case of him simply acting in a manner that he believes one is supposed to in such circumstances.  And, it is the two women in their lives, Henchard's daughter Elizabeth-Jane (period piece favourite Jodhi May) and love interest Lucetta (the very curvaceous Polly Walker, who also starred in ROME), who are a major source of conflict between the man of character and his polar opposite.  Incidentally, the act that is shown to be Henchard's first egregious decision (I won't reveal what it is - no, I shan't) did, in fact, occur in that era - though obviously not often -  and hearing of one such incident planted one of the seeds of this story in Hardy's fertile mind.

Although shot in 2001, for some reason or another this adaptation did not air until 2003, but it was well worth the wait, as the production values are very high and the acting superb.  The ending, in particular, is especially moving, btw.  And, if I remember correctly, this was originally broadcast on A&E as a three hour movie, but, as this film actually has a running time of around 194 minutes, there must have been at least 40 minutes edited out of the broadcast.

All in all, this 2 disc dvd set is well worth its $15 price tag, despite the dearth of extras.  Just have the tissues ready when you watch them.",1330300800,20,4887,4.688888888888889
