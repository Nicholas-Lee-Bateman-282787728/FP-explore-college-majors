3060211,1,B00114UUR2,"This is a repulsive example of Italian cinema at its worst. This film stars the genuinely creepy Helmut Berger as ""Mad Dog,"" a career criminal who enjoys murder and mayhem just a little too much. He and some henchmen escape from prison and seek revenge on those who put him behind bars.

His chief foe is Police Inspector Santini whose own father (the judge who, coincidentally, sentenced Mad Dog) and sister eventually become hostages. The resulting hand-to-hand fight scene, which concludes the movie, is both bloody and gratuitous.

Technically the film is directed and photographed fairly well (excepting the credit sequence and some arty shots so popular in Italian cinema of the period), and the acting of the principals is above average for the genre. One interesting problem was in keeping the action in the final fight scene straight, as the director for some reason chose to dress both Mad Dog and the Not-So-Great-Santini nearly identically, which made for several confusing moments (or maybe I was just bored).

While I have seen many more poorly crafted films, the utter lack of morality and needless violence, especially toward women, made this painful to endure, and totally worthy of a single star.",1196899200,6,1214,5.06

8240394,2,B00114UUR2,"Vitali (Helmet Berger) and three of his friends escape from prison. Their plan is to change cars, get money, get papers, and leave the country...after they enact revenge on the snitch and the judge etc.

The restoration wasn't there. The plot had wholes and the characters all came across as idiots. How did Rome conquer the world again? Worth a pass.

Available on a 50 DVD pack.

8240401,1,B00114UUR2,"My friend purchased this blue underground cult classic, I work at a dvd store and have learned that certain dvd cases like the clear one's used for Mad dog killer will crack your disc to pieces from the center out. I have found 0 people who know this and so I'm starting my own boycott now and refuse to buy any dvd's put in cheap cases like this. Yes you heard me right this type of case will crack your dvd from the center ring just from sitting in it!!! The center hubs are too big and force the dvd up until the ring sits on the prongs resulting in a shattered waste of money! This is why your dvd's and games break it is not your fault it is the fault of the dvd case manufactures! I have already had about 10 or more movies destroyed by cases some I only viewed once and who will replace them? No one!  Movie is great but why buy something you know will be useless in a few months?",1353456000,4,887,4.011299435028248
8240402,1,B00114UUR2,"This was an snoozefest,all the shock,schlock and violence couldn't keep my attention on it. The Killer is some blondefairy looking dude who looks more like an spoiled brat than some Violent sociopath,Only the Police and the beautiful yet kind of old and not in a cougar-y way gets the movie passing along. The car chase is semi-exciting,although Alfa-Romeo's are not exiciting cars;I've seen better Italian Cinema.",1343865600,,414,5.287878787878788
8240403,3,B00114UUR2,"There's nothing like a good Helmut Berger movie....that's what I always say.  In Mad Dog Killer he's Nanni Vitali, a violent criminal who's just escaped from the slammer with a few of his flunkies.  He kills a guy responsible for his incarceration, rapes Marisa Mell and tries to get her help in a large robbery before he escapes to Venezuela.  Meanwhile he's pursued relentlessly by cop, Richard Harrison.  That's more or less what it all is.
There are many good Italian crime films, but this one isn't all it's cracked up to be.  Sure it's not terribly original, but I don't mind that.  What I mind is that a movie based around the concept of an out of control psycho on a rampage presents us with one rather limp noodle villain.  Berger's performance isn't terrible, but his character is weasley, wimpy, and really not all that violent.  Numerous times throughout the film, Harrison is calling him a coward, and as the viewer you really begin to see what he means.  Sure he's an unpleasant character, but no so in that interesting way that keeps our eyes glued to the screen like with Albert Ganz(James Remar) in 48 HRS or Mr. Joshua(Gary Busey) from Lethal Weapon.  Those two(Remar especially) come across as way more ""mad dog"" than Berger.  Plus the film isn't near as violent as the quotes on the box would have you believe.
I certainly wouldn't say it's a boring movie, and it does have it's moments, that's why I gave it 3 stars.  But writer/director Sergio Grieco(who did The Sinful Nuns Of Saint Valentine, and who hasn't seen that flick?) certainly is no threat to Enzo Castellari or Sergio Sollima.",1212796800,7,1610,4.670212765957447
