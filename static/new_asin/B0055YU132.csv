8458925,5,B0055YU132,"All three were great movies, especially Burning Plain. I had not heard of that one; I don't know how I missed it when it came out. Great acting, especially by Kim Basinger. I bought it for the other two movies with the hot babes. It turned out they had some good acting as well, especially Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Great buy with all three for a great price. Highly recommended.
(Just saw another excellent Phillip Hoffman movie with DeNiro, too, for free on Amazon Prime called Flawless. I love Amazon.)",1460764800,,504,4.674157303370786
