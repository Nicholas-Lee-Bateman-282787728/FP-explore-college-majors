8672131,1,B00MGNYKWI,"I taped some of these episode off the air and I was thrilled to find these on DVD. What a disappointment! The quality is unbelievably poor. Fuzzy or out of focus. No effort was made to remaster.
I bought my copy from another supplier, I think the company that put it on DVD. I complained to them, but got nowhere.
As of now, Amazon is not offering this for sale.
Don't buy this piece of junk, here or anywhere else.",1519603200,,415,4.2
8672132,5,B00MGNYKWI,"This is one of the BEST EVER scientific documentaries. Yes, it IS roughly 30 years old, but it is extremely well done by the production staff and narrator. The story is a complete geological journey of about the last 400 million years of Earth's history, showing where the continents started, how they formed, and how North America was shaped and came to be what it is today. Though the video quality on this second-hand production is not very good at all, the story content and scientific information on the show is absolutely marvelous. This is a program that should be redone with a digital re-enhancement to show it in all its original glory. While many the average viewer would be bored senseless with the way the story is told, those of us with any decent amount of scientific curiosity find it to be wonderfully informative and a real treat to watch. I'd give it 5 stars simply because of the content.",1453766400,2,908,4.645962732919255
8672133,3,B00MGNYKWI,"I purchased this set directly from MediaOutlet.com to replace my 1986 VHS off the air recordings of the PBS series. The three star rating is in no way related to the Peabody Award winning content of the six episodes. It is still a wonderful exploration of the geology of North America focused on the continental USA (with short shrift to Alaska) with bits and pieces of Canada thrown in (the Canadian Shield and the Rockies). ""Corridors of Time"" is my favorite segment and has inspired my multiple visits to the desert Southwest. Without getting into deep waters of political debate, it presents a balanced view of what we both gained and lost in damming the Colorado. ""Land of the Sleeping Mountains"" remains an evocative exploration of the wonders of the Great Basin. I was fortunate to spend July and August of 2014 traveling the areas of these two episodes by car. The landscape and the series evocation of the same remains magical.

So why three stars? The video and audio quality is far worse than my 1986 VHS hi-fi tapes. The source appears to have been of fairly poor quality and there is no evidence of attempts at digital restoration. Colors are sepia-toned (my old tapes remain quite vivid) and the picture is slightly out of focus and grainy. The audio doesn't compare to the VHS hi-fi recording. I have taken the precaution of archiving the old tapes to DVD and those ""homemade"" efforts remain my go-to option when I want to revisit the series.

It is a shame. The roughly contemporaneous ""Land of the Eagle"" (also a BBC/WTTW co-production if memory serves correctly) was released some years back in a restored version that is leagues beyond the quality of the set under consideration. Here's hoping the original producers see the light and restore this landmark with the care it deserves.",1438992000,7,1802,4.790996784565916
8672134,5,B00MGNYKWI,This series is one of my all time favorites.  I just wish the original publisher would release it.  I have the after-market version.  It's not wonderful but at least I have a copy.,1427587200,3,180,4.393939393939394
8672135,5,B00MGNYKWI,"Everyone in science-challenged America should see this series (though whether many have the attention span to view it is unlikely). It details the geological underpinnings of various sections of North America, including the Great Plains, the Mississippi Valley, and the Great Basin area. The message is that we need to know how the continent was shaped in order to work with it rather than abuse it, and that many of the rivers, farmlands, etc. we depend on are delicate and changeable. For example, the Mississippi River periodically has shifted its delta back and forth, but in order to maintain the city of New Orleans, it has been dammed in its attempts to shift back to its other outlet near Baton Rouge; this is a battle the Army Corps of Engineers ultimately can't win. And in trying to do so, it's making the existing delta sink by damming the river so that the silt it carries no longer reaches its mouth. Another example is the Oglallah Aquifer, a huge deposit of water underlying the Great Plains. It is left over from the melting of the last glacial period, and it it currently being drained for farming at an unsustainable rate; once it's drained, it's gone, and so are the farmlands of the Great Plains. Information every American and Canadian needs to understand.",1416355200,4,1278,4.787330316742081
