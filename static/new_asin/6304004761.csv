8363138,4,6304004761,"First Loves 1 is by Pink Pineapple, KSS Studio's mature anime branch.  It  was subtitled by ADV around mid-1990s.  Anyway the music and sounds are  clear and crisp.  The voice acting and coreography are very well done as  well.  (The VAs really get across the idea that these students are all new  to the entire dating and relationship scene.)  The animation and colors are  good, but not not as rich as KSS Studios and Pink Pineapple are known  for.
As for the show itself, First Loves 1 is about the new high-school  freshman Kakeru.  He want's to be in a serious relationship... but hasn't  ever had an experience in doing so.  Thrown into this path are an  upperclassman girl who's on the rebound, and another girl who's just as  unexperienced as Kakeru, and you have a very mature story about growing  up.
Recommended for people who like a good romantic story about  relationships, and how newcomers learn just how much work is involved in  having a real, meaningful one.  A very enjoyable show.
