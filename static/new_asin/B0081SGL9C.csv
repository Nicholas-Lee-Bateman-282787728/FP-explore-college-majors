8524131,4,B0081SGL9C,"Another Alpha Video DVD with some good episodes of Frontier Doctor, and the video quality on these are definitely better than some of the other volumes in the series (such as Vol. 4). A great old western with a stoic if bland cowboy star - unfortunately, Rex Allen doesn't do much singing in this series, as was his won't in his days as a cowboy screen idol. If you like old 50s TV westerns, this is a decent DVD to pick up.",1431216000,,424,4.182926829268292
8524132,4,B0081SGL9C,"Each of these dvd's contains 4 episodes from the mid-1950s tv series. I watched this series as a kid. In fact, I was one of my most favorite television Western series. No fastest gun in the West, no gimmicks such as sawed off rifle or shotgun or riverboat gambler followed around by shotgun toting Indian! Just stories of the settling on Arizona south of Tucson at the turn of the century. This dvd contains four very absorbing frontier stories.",1406505600,,445,4.6455696202531644
8524133,5,B0081SGL9C,"Bought this TV program because my wife had a small talking part toward the beginning of the episode. She was 8 yrs old at the time and worked often as an extra in Hollywood, and we wanted a record of this on DVD rather than tape.",1406160000,,229,4.0
