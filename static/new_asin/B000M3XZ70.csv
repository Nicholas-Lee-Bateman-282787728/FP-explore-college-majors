8166169,4,B000M3XZ70,"This is an excellent addition of the famed Vuelta a Espana, the third biggest bicycle race in the world (behind the Tour de France and Giro d'Italia). There's some great racing throughout, and as always the production by World Cycling and commentary by Phil Liggett is superb.

However, the race was marred, if not at the time, months later, when the winner and his chief lieutenant were caught doping, and their team turned out to be probably the dirtiest team in recent years. Adding to this shame, the rider they ""cheated"" out of a win, had a potentially dark past as well (though appears to, by most all accounts, have cleaned up by the time of this race).

Everyone realizes that cycling has had serious doping problems for the last decade, akin to baseball's ""steroid era"", but the sport is cleaning itself up, and if you can overlook the cheating, even if it's obvious to you, this race is well worth watching.",1235779200,,917,4.654320987654321
