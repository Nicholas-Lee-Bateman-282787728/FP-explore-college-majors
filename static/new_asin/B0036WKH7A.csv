8390212,4,B0036WKH7A,"""Evil Angel"" exeeded my (rather low) expectations. It offered a surprising amount of violence, blood, nudity and profanity; not at all the tame material I expected from a writer/director best known for mormon drama films (maybe this is why it doesn't seem to have been released in the US). It's a well made horror/mystery/thriller with a good villain, Lilith, well played by several actresses as she takes possession of different bodies. This seems to be the only film appearance by gorgeous leading man Kristopher Shepard. Ving Rhames does a good job as usual as a private detective.

""Evil Angel"" was a positive surprise. Recommended for fans of supernatural thrillers.",1390348800,4,671,5.155963302752293
