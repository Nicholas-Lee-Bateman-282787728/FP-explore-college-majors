5124688,5,B0083HXKJU,"I love Shiva Rea style and the Yoga Matrix is a most, you can choose your combination of routines according to your energy, you can do one, two, or as many routines your body resist, is perfect.",1355097600,,194,4.27027027027027
5124689,5,B0083HXKJU,I love it this core yoga dvd. I am 56 years old and  I have lower back issues. I can do these core yoga moves and the results are good. I do feel it the next day in my abs and not my back.  Sometimes I move slower then her and that is ok. You do need to listen to how your body feels that day. I believe that this is also strenghthening my lower back without the pain.,1353974400,4,368,3.6455696202531644
5124690,2,B0083HXKJU,"This DVD is too improvisatory for my taste - there is too little actual direction and instruction. If I wanted to make up my own workout, I would not have paid for a DVD!",1349481600,6,170,4.029411764705882
5124691,1,B0083HXKJU,Misleading Photo/Description. Does not show abs and engagement of ab muscles as shown on package cover and on the ad. All good workout videos show the muscle being worked. This one does not.,1348444800,6,190,4.787878787878788
5124692,5,B0083HXKJU,"I have been doing yoga for a few years, and consider myself an ""advanced beginner"" in yoga.  I try new poses and new things. I recently discovered Shiva Rea, who is considered to be a ""powerhouse yoga teacher"" by the New York Times.  This DVD is an excellent value for your money, especially if you want to work your abs.

Other reviewers have pointed out that this DVD consists of three older programs, now released on one DVD.  That is true.  The three programs are Creative Core Yoga for abs(2006), Creative Coreand Lower body (2008) and Creative Core and Upper body (2012). They were filmed outdoors at the White Sands National Park and Kauai's Limahuli Garden.  Watching a yoga DVD that has been filmed outdoors makes yoga even more relaxing and meditative to me.  Because I am new to enjoying Shiva, and had not purchased many of her DVDs yet, I did not have the other workouts that these yoga workouts were in.  So the fact that this is repackaged material was fine, it made it a good value for those who are new to this type of vinyasa flow yoga.

The breakdown of the yoga matrix-a device central to Shiva's DVDs that lets you choose how long or little you work out-consists of the following:

These are the ones from Creative Core abs:

Water Core (10 minutes)
Spontaneous Core ( 8 minutes)
Fire Core (17 minutes

These are from Creative Core and Lower body:

Creative roots (13 minutes)
Creative lower body ( 9 minutes)

And these are from Creative core and Upper Body:

Agni Namaskar (25 minutes)
Creative Core upper body (8 minutes)

Then there is Shavasana at the end for 2 minutes.

By far, I found Agni Namaskar the hardest workout to do.  This workout is a total body salutation and is very strenous.  It consists of 9 cycles of prostration pushups, and is not for the faint of heart. It also is the longest workout on the DVD by far, the others averaging under 20 minutes.

My favorites were the Water Core and Spontaneous Core by far.  The environment of the White Sands National Park provides an incredible backdrop for Shiva's take on yoga.  These brief workouts are invigorating, really work your abs, and are ideal to add on to another yoga workout if you feel you have not completed enough ab work.

Shiva is a wonderful, inspiring instructor. With her use of fluid movement and dance, she breathes new life into old yoga postures. If you have not purchased the DVDs that this one is a compilation of this workout is well worth your money.",1348099200,67,2463,4.560364464692483
5124693,1,B0083HXKJU,"Because I have previous DVD's created by this yoga instructor, this DVD is useless!!!  Waste of my money.  All it is is recycled clips from other DVD's.  Why this is not stated on the preview through Amazon is a mystery to me.  I guess its all about $$$$ and they got mine!!",1347926400,10,274,4.211538461538462
5124694,4,B0083HXKJU,"Shiva's videos are top notch,,,very creative, gives us something different than the same old, same old. But, this is a repackaging of her Core Yoga products. Thats not a bad thing,,,we get 3 videos for the price of one,,,but, if you already own the set of 3 Core Yoga videos, this is the exact same thing,,,beware!!! That said, I own all of her videos, and I love her creativity and style. Dont let this repackaging be a turn off, get on the mat with Shiva, she will work you, in a good way!!!",1347840000,24,493,4.311827956989247

5124696,5,B0083HXKJU,The routines in this DVD really get your abs going. Daily Energy is still my favourite yoga DVD; however this DVD is fantastic when I want to focus on core work.,1485561600,,161,4.225806451612903

5124700,1,B0083HXKJU,Not that challenging to the core. There are lots of times she wants you to get creative. I don't know what to do at these points and try to get ideas from her but she's moving too fast. I pay for dvds so that I don't have to get creative...,1467244800,6,240,3.82

5124706,4,B0083HXKJU,"This isn't my favorite Shiva title, but it's still good. The sequences are taken from other DVDs so if you own any of her other titles make sure you double check that there isn't overlap on this DVD so you don't waste your money. She generally does a good job explaining and demonstrating poses and there is a variety of different levels of sequences. Anyone, beginner to more advanced, can find something on this. Shiva does get a bit obnoxious at times, but overall is still a good instructor.",1452902400,,495,4.573033707865169
5124707,5,B0083HXKJU,"This was a gift, I'm sure the recipient will love this. Will order another one for myself.",1452038400,,90,4.352941176470588
5124708,4,B0083HXKJU,"I haven't done all of the segments yet, but so far I'm really enjoying this DVD.  I love the ""matrix"" format that allows the user to create a different practice to match mood, time available, etc.  This, along with her Daily Energy DVD, are my first Shiva Rea videos, and at first I wasn't sure about how I felt about them.  They are completely different from Rodney Yee, Jenni Rawlings, and Travis Elliott, whose videos I have used for the past 7 years.  Where they are quite structured and very clear-cut, Rea's videos are more free-flowing and have a ""do what feels good to your body"" mood.  Her direction and cues aren't as concise as the other instructors either, so I find myself watching the screen more than I want to.  I'm sure I'll get past this once I've become accustomed to her style.  Another big plus is the music--the music on both is delightful.  Her voice is also incredibly soothing, even though I must admit at first I wasn't a fan.
One of the things I've learned through Yoga is to keep an open mind and to never discount something - or someone - based on first impressions.  If you're on the fence about ordering either of these DVDs, go ahead!  I think you'll be glad you did.
One more thing:  I think just about everyone will find some challenges in these DVDs, but I wouldn't recommend them for beginners because it is assumed that the practitioner is well-versed in the proper form of most of the poses.",1445472000,5,1429,4.478764478764479
5124709,5,B0083HXKJU,Love it. Really hits the spot and helps you to relax.,1445299200,,53,3.909090909090909

5124713,1,B0083HXKJU,"I ordered this dvd because i have another dvd from shiva that i really liked.  Thinking it would be top notch i ordered this core dvd.  I also liked the idea of doing compound exercises that covered lower body and core, upper body and core, etc.  First, this is not for beginners.  I am experienced and found this dvd frustrating on two counts.  The customer better have a knowledge of poses and be experienced because injury could result.  Second, it comes off as a mish mash.  It has been said it is a compilation of other dvds but please be professional about presentation...dont just end a segment!  No winding down, no notice that we are finished!  I also found the lack of true upper body work obvious.  Lots of flailing around, improvisation, you do what feels good to you...really?  Upper body with core turns out to be leg work and  the 25 minute segment will certainly either kill you or turn you off.  Yes, you get core work but not worth the aggravation.  So glad i bought a used, new dvd and didn't waste much money.  For a good workout i recommend mark lauren's you are your own gym and throw this one into the donate pile.",1429833600,5,1137,4.42512077294686
5124714,3,B0083HXKJU,"I like how intense the work out is, but this is not what I was expecting. Completely different from her pre/post natal and mommy and baby yoga formats. A little to eccentric for my personal taste.",1429315200,,196,4.472222222222222
5124715,5,B0083HXKJU,Love Shiva Rea's DVDs. This is my third one and it doesn't disappoint.,1428710400,,70,4.461538461538462
5124716,2,B0083HXKJU,Not a fan. I like the way the DVD is set up though.  As far as yoga goes - this is way too advanced for my level and it's impossible to follow.,1428364800,,143,3.46875
5124717,2,B0083HXKJU,"I tried to do it, but I did not like it cuz I had to keep look up at my computer all the time.

5124727,5,B0083HXKJU,I love this DVD. I can work my core without all of the extra workout that I don't need or want. The matrix system in the DVD gives me a chance to taylor my workout based on the amount of time that I have that morning.

5124735,4,B0083HXKJU,I have several Shiva Rea yoga DVD's and really do like them all.  My only issue is that you have to look up quite a few times to figure out what she is doing.  Some of the other yoga DVD's we use provide much better audio cues.,1399420800,,227,3.8085106382978724
5124736,4,B0083HXKJU,"The description says this video ""includes segments from the following previously released DVDs..."" .

This DVD collects together several of her creative ""core"" sequences
into one wonderful long workout that will do wonders for your back and posture.
She explains everything clearly and demonstrates beautifully.",1389398400,,242,5.5675675675675675
5124740,5,B0083HXKJU,"This DVD is amazing. At first I was a little weirded out by her nontraditional approach to exercise (what? I'm supposed to move around in the pose?), but WOW, does this work to firm up and strengthen your core. I consider myself in moderate shape - I'm not an athlete but I'm no couch potato either. Her guidance is top notch so you maintain your form and target the appropriate muscles. The moves are hard enough where you want to continue to do them so you progress to her level.

My favorite part is the 25-minute workout (I forget what she calls it) that includes 120 pushups and flow/core work in between. It's perfect for a weeknight workout when your kids are asleep and you don't have the energy to bounce around but you need to do something.

I also highly recommend this for women post-partum. My youngest is 3 years old and I finally feel like my abs are coming back to life, despite working out regularly for a few years now.  Had I found this years ago, it probably wouldn't have taken that long :)",1387497600,4,1011,4.39572192513369

But I began to feel and see the results pretty quickly!!  My husband noticed first that my ""teabag butt"" was gone.  Heh heh.  I hadn't been aware that I had a teabag butt, but I was glad it was gone!!  But the strength that I gained quickly blew me away!!  And even now, after 5 months, I feel as if I am rubbing someone else's legs.  They feel so different!!  I started taking karate after doing this for 2 months, and I am not embarrassed out there.  Before, I would have flopped around on the mat and never gone back.  There are 7 segments, and you can mix and match them to suit your mood and your needs.  The standing pose segment killed my thighs at first, and I had to keep standing up, but now I have a solid and long-lasting saddle stance in karate.  There is a 17 minute segment that covers everything, if I just have time for a short workout.  This is one of those workouts where I end up breathing hard and sweating well, though I am not moving a lot. And as I progress, I find new, deeper, long-forgotten muscles that I invite to join the rest, and I am filling in the gaps in my range of motion.  For me, this workout has been dynamite!!",1365033600,12,1281,4.129554655870446

5124750,3,B0083HXKJU,"I have recently become interested in learning yoga to increase my core strength and flexibility. I purchased this dvd last week at a retail store. I have already given up on it after trying it once. I have not really practiced yoga before and this is clearly for those more advanced in yoga and flexibility. There is no way I can get my body in the positions that she does and she doesn't give enough time or instruction on how to do it. By the time I figured out what she was doing, she was on to the next move. I think that this dvd might be great for those that already have advanced yoga skills, but definitely not for the beginner or if you are not flexible. I will pick up a dvd that has better instruction for beginners and maybe come back to this down the line.",1361232000,6,769,4.167785234899329
5124751,3,B0083HXKJU,"This DVD is, as others have noted, a compilation of segments from Shiva Rea's prior core workouts, two of which I already own. While it's nice to not have to change DVDs to do multiple segments, I doubt I would have purchased this had I known there was no new material.

I have no issues with the workouts themselves; they are great, as most of Shiva's stuff is. However, I do take issue with what I think is misleading packaging that never indicates that this is old material in a new DVD.",1359158400,9,490,4.326086956521739
5124752,5,B0083HXKJU,"If you have already purchased any of the Core Abs, Core+Lower body or Core+Upper Body, you might want to skip this dvd as this dvd is a compilation of those three dvds put into one Core Yoga program, with Shiva's signature ""matrix"". I love this part of her videos, as I can take just what I want and put together my own practice for the day. Sometimes it is longer, sometimes shorter, or sometimes more focused in one area. This is a great way to be able to gear your practice to the time you have available.

In this program you work the core in all the segments, but some have additional emphasis on the lower body or upper body. The upper body has one particular segment with a lot of yoga push-ups.

I would say that this is geared to an intermediate practicer but every now and again she throws in something that I think is a little more advanced. (I'm still trying to figure out how the heck I balance on my hands with my legs out in front of me and my butt off the floor....without using a tub full of water to make me float). Shiva's style is calm, with good cuing, excellent form and as always beautiful sets-this time in White Sands and Kauaii.

The movements are unique, and you will definitely feel your core if you do them correctly. I would say the one drawback might be her more 'free-form' segments where she doesn't really want you to follow her but to work your core with exercises you were shown but in your own beat, style and creative flow. This isn't for everyone, so if you don't like that part, just follow along with her....no one is the wiser if you don't feel like getting into a creative free-flow.

Overall, a really well put together dvd, good instruction, fabulous cinematography and a great matrix format so you can choose your own workout of the day.",1358640000,15,1783,4.377643504531722

8524542,5,B0083HXKJU,"wow ,I really enjoy this yoga cd. I like that you can chose your warm up and chose 2  areas to work on of your body and you have a choice of your ending. I can become really bored when I do the same work out over and over again and with this cd I feel I will be able to use it longer due to the many choices I have on routines.",1517184000,,327,3.4794520547945207

8524547,5,B0083HXKJU,"Best core yoga workout I've tried because it works the whole body. The philosophy is that all muscles in the body influence the core. You get sore and also energized. Please note there is a section that involves pushups but if you can't handle that you can skip it by using the matrix. Anything you can do is an accomplishment so every section should be tried. This is definitely intermediate yoga and strength training and it's best for a person who is already relatively fit, relatively flexible, and who is looking to up the challenge.",1495238400,2,538,4.673684210526316
