8041189,3,B000009MUJ,"This is an interesting, fun little movie. It stars Yuen Biao (Dragons Forever) and Eric Tsang (My Lucky Stars) as two young stuntmen working in the Hong Kong movie industry. Stanley Fong (License To Steal) plays Yuen  Biao's father, a man who leads the souls of the dead to their final rest,  Dad does this while in a trancelike state where he appears to be sleeping.  Biao and his friend are unaware of this and it creates some funny  moments.
The stuntmen find romance with a young female folksinger and a  lady movie Art Director. Lam Ching Ying (Mr. Vampire) portrays Yuen Biao's  uncle, a man wise in the ways of the supernatural.
When Father refuses to  guide a chosen soul to safety he is slain by vengeful spirits. Now the  guide job is left to Yuen Biao, who seeks a way out of his unwanted  obligation to the dead. The four young people work with Uncle Lam Ching  Ying to free Biao.
This is a light movie, just a little spooky, and very  intriguing! Yuen Biao gets to show off a little of his incredible athletic  ability, his character is pretty cute too! Eric Tsang has many great  comedic moments, and just about steals this movie. I especially liked the  beach scenes and the interior re-decorating job. The scenes where the evil  spirit inhabits the various people in the room is riveting. samo Hung Kam  Bo has a couple of cameo roles in this movie too, you'll know him when you  see him!
Although Yuen Biao does not have much in the way of martial arts  or fighting in this film it is most definately worth buying!",964051200,,1531,4.446043165467626
