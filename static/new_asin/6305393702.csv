This is a really good video and very well done.  These stretches and strength excercises are non-traditional, but they isolate the muscles specific to golf and do a real good job at improving golfers' overall ball striking ability.  There are no false promises here.  What you get is an excellent golf workout. And plenty of humor...Jesper does the complete workout at the end which gives you the chance to go through all the excercises you just learned.  For Jesper fans out there, you can find The Divots music single, ""Jesper Parnevik"" at TheDivots.com ****",1002067200,,756,4.611940298507463

If you really expect to train up your muscles to prepare for powerful swing, this tape should suit you. At least this tape is much better than Gerry James's ""Advanced Power Golf"". Each session is focus on different phase of swing: takeaway, backswing, impact etc. and the trainer would explain in details why you need this exercise for that particular phase of swing.",970272000,3,491,5.0
