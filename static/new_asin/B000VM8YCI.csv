2945160,3,B000VM8YCI,"I grew up with the Die Hard movies. I really liked the 1st movie and am in the minority becuase I also enjoyed the second. The 3rd and 4th movie I liked, though not as much, because they didn't feel like Die Hard movies as much as the first two did. 1&2 consentrated mostly on John McClain. With the 3rd you had Samuel Jackson. He was a big focus during the movie, but was similar enough to Bruce Willis' character that it didn't distract too much from the movie.

With the 4th movie, it didn't feel like Die Hard so much. At times, it almost felt like a sequel to 16 blocks, that had been watered down to a PG13. Don't get me wrong though, I did enjoy the movie, but it definitely isn't the Die Hard I grew up with.

The audio was very good on all films, but I was disappointed by the earlier films video quality. After recently seeing what Warner Bros. were able to do for Blade Runner, the first two movies are pretty disappointing. BR is 25 years old and they were able to make it look like it was made almost yesterday (except for obviously dated tech). I wish they would have taken a little more time and cleaned up the films better.

While this is a good deal for all 4 movies, you might want to wait for an unrated version before purchasing these. I'm hoping the reason there wasn't an unrated blu-ray version is that they're going back to do some re-edits to make it better than the unrated version released on DVD.",1192579200,91,1424,4.247232472324724

2945198,1,B000VM8YCI,Waste of 20 bucks. Amazon shouldn't have this available anymore. These are manufactured damaged. Most of the positive reviews aren't of the product but the actual movies.

2945199,5,B000VM8YCI,Definitive Blu-ray set.  Doesn't have the last Die Hard which I'm fine with since I didn't like it. Nice and compact.  I dug into With A Vengeance and the upgrade in HD is crisp and vibrant. Smart of Fox to include all the bonus features on each movie that came out in prior DVD editions. Also looking forward to the new doc's on the added disc 5. Set runs about $25 which is well worth it.,1488240000,,390,4.118421052631579

This is another of those cardboard slip cover packs which are a pet peeve of mine because they often scratch discs and they force you to put fingerprints all over just to get them out.

So I was super excited to get these movies on Blue Ray as they are my favorite series of all time. My wife had never seen them with me, mostly through stubbornness, so I was super excited to make her watch them as well. About half way through the first movie...nothing, the disk just stops. It was the worst timing and completely ruined my moment sharing it with her. But you may ask why I rated it a 5 instead of something lower because of this, and I will tell you. The replacement process with Amazon was super easy and super quick. I was able to get and return a new copy in just a couple of days and pick up where we left off.

The second film rivaled the first and seriously made me wonder about traveling by plane. By the time the fourth movie came around, so many years had passed, I went to see it with some doubt.  Boy was I wrong.  Big John still has it and the fourth movie was as good as the rest, if not better. By then, wife Holly was no longer the endangered heroine and that title had passed to John's daughter.

2945361,5,B000VM8YCI,"Based on the 1979 crime fiction novel, ""Nothing Lasts Forever"" by author Roderick Thorpe, the ""Die Hard"" franchise starring Bruce Willis is an exciting and fun action adventure series filled with shootings and explosions galore.

I first saw the first ""Die Hard"" when I was a young boy, & loved it ever since.

Where the film depictions differ from the novel is first the movie was produced as an ""action tough guy shoot em up"" epic, where Bruce Willis follows in Arnold and Chuck Norris's footsteps of either punching or shooting any man who crosses him.

 Second, the novel is a deeper and somewhat darker look at the nature of man, and how man reacts to the violence of being forced to fire a gun at another human being.  John McClaine, the fantasy NYPD tough cop actually throws up and is disturbed about being forced to kill the Terrorist bad guys in the high rise, while in the movie McClaine's character cracks wise guy jokes while gunning each villain down, and he does so with ease as if his targets were video game aliens.  The novel is more mental, and has deeper insight where the film version is simply a shooting gallery.

  The villains and their motivations are slightly different in the book version, so a true fan may want to check that book out and compare the two.  I loved the ""Hans Grueber"" villain portrayed brilliantly by English actor Alan Rickman.  These two are big mental equals among a group of dopes, dueling it out first mentally via the radio as Willis hunts down each of Rickman's deadly henchmen one at a time.  They both find ways to piss each other off, while Grueber anti's up the game throwing Willis into more traps injuring him every time more and more in the process.

 Willis finds himself not only up against these ruthless Terrorist killers, but also against an imbecile and bureaucratic FBI moron who doesn't respect what Willis's character John McClaine has done, nor knows about the villains.

 Very good first movie, followed by an okay winter time shoot em up against domestic Army Terrorists 1990 sequel, then followed with the third installment where Willis is teamed up with Samuel L. Jackson on the crazy streets of New York fighting against a deadly random Terrorist bomber.

 I found this series, despite being impossible and absolutely fictional where in no way one guy could survive all of what is thrown at him, to be very fun and also very politically & militarily contemporary were our modern country is faced with the real deadly menace of Terrorism and attackers like the villains from ""Die Hard"".  Awesome movie, two thumbs up and A-",1425686400,,2596,4.716186252771618

Do not expect a film that is going to revolutionize your ideology, your spirituality, your religion, or even your political beliefs. It is an action film that is supposed to entertain you and nothing else, and yet

It starts with some nice Christmas party in some high rise office block in some international super capitalistic business if not corporation. The poor John McLane is coming to Los Angeles from New York to visit his children and wife he has been estranged from for some months with three thousand miles between their two places of residence.

The whole tower block is taken over by some German terrorists just after John McLane has arrived and the whole film will be his action in order to get rid of the terrorists, to save the hostages and to save his own wife.

The film shows how rotten some apples in the basket can be. Even one is able to sell his own colleagues to get a coke in a glass, hardly more. In fact he won't even be able to drink it because once he has given some leverage to the terrorists they just thank him for the rest of his eternal life.

But whats best in this film is the action and the visual effects. No digitalized special effects and it looks real, rough, hard. The very good final product is reached thanks to the editing of the film. It makes it so fast that it becomes breath-taking and at times it is hilarious because some of the situations look so hectic, so extreme, and yet they are nothing but an illusion and it is enjoyable.

It is also enjoyable to see LAPD officers, inspectors or whatever they may call them down there being smashed up, the FBI being fooled and ridiculed, the media being unworthy of any trust, and only two little black men coming on top, a plain motorized street cop who manages to raise the alarm and a little black limousine chauffeur who manages to block the escape of the last terrorists. That makes you feel happy and warm in the heart. The little ones are the heroes of the film.

BRUCE WILLIS  DIE HARD 2  1990

Christmas eve again with John McClane, this time on Dulles airport in Washington DC. This time John McClane is waiting for the arrival of his wife on a plane. But of course everything went wrong, which was to be expected.

The airport was taken over by a band of terrorists who tried to recuperate and liberate a general who had been convicted of some anti-communist crime or something. That is not entirely clear and that does not matter. Of course these terrorists could not succeed in their plan if they did not have come accomplices in the airport and in the armed forces brought in to deal with the situation.

But John McClane is the savior of the day, which is normal on Christmas eve. John once again managed to stop the apocalypse he could not really prevent since he was surprised in it himself, but he also managed to get rid of the beast, the dragon and Babylon at the same time: the liberated general, the chief of the terrorists and the military traitor.

Apart from that the rhythm is quite diabolical, though they kept the panic for the very end. People in that airport were so patient, so enduring, so smiling silent when something was obviously wrong. Thanks to a journalist the bad news was finally aired and the panic could come. We are not told how many casualties.

Pure entertainment based on a very fast rhythm and some kind of humor that is always targeting some kind of officials or uniformed commissioned puppets and generally below the waist if not below the knees, low, low, low anyway. I personally missed one thing: the old church that was to be blown up with tons of plastic of something like that. It did not blow up. Too bad.

BRUCE WILLIS  DIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE  1995

We finally move to New York and out of the Yule season. It is still dealing with the Germans we have been dealing with before, that kind of German army trying to conquer the world, or at least some kind of back base for their criminal activities.

It starts like a game and then becomes very bitter and it becomes a real war time operation targeting Fort Knox and their reserves of gold, hundreds of billions of dollars in gold bullions. To get down there without attracting too much attention is a little bit difficult so you have to have one massive explosion that opens the street down to the underground vault.

The rest after that is nothing. John McLane gets some black innocent and neutral partner at the beginning of the game and they will become a good pair of gamesters in full addiction till the real end and finish of the hunt, chase and tracking search. It sure is more suspenseful than the Football Super Bowl. It is also quite spectacular about the damage caused to the urban environment. Crossing Central Park with a car in something like ten minutes at a peak hour late in the morning is quite spectacular.

Of course we know the gangsters will be defeated, the main leader who is the brother of a previous gang leader who was defeated and killed by John McLane, will die defeated and beaten into pureed smithereens. The whole interest of this film is to see how and here there is some inventiveness more than creativity on the side of the plot-writers and scenario-writers.

In this film some digital visual effects (hello Buena Vista) are used and that make the film slightly less rough because digital special effects are smoother, more easy-going, more fluid than standard old fashioned analog special effects. But we are used to that nowadays though it makes the film less impressive.

Just for entertainment of course. This film will not give you some intellectual overload, though with too many of these you might get into some apnea, the suspension of your breathing that could be lethal, due to the lack of cerebral activity.

Enjoy the spiritual and mental relaxation.

BRUCE WILLIS  LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD  2007

We finally had to come to the modern world and computers. This film is so frightening for simple people that it should create a real panic among them. It deals with all the central networks created by our modern society to control govern and command absolutely everything that can be set in some kind of network. The big fear is that when all networks are synchronized and connected one person from one keyboard and central computer will be able to control absolutely everything in life and society. Everyone knows about it. Check Terminator for that.

In Paris they even have some higher education professor, Marcel Gauchet, who explains that in such a society we just need to blow up or paralyze the nodal points of these systems to bring a society to a stand still and thus impose a revolution. No one has been able to find out if that man is using this idea as a menace against society or as a warning to society. Some of his students were even investigated some years ago as having played a role in such an attack on the fast train network in France

But this fear is also lined with another which is a lot older: the fear of machines per se. People are afraid of machines though they use machines everyday, like cars and other means of transportation. Computers are even more frightening than a crashing airplane because all we see on the screen is a whole lot of figures, in fact digits, and we cannot understand what the machine is saying, and it is always saying a lot. We have always been afraid of foreign languages, and computers speak a foreign language.

The third level of fear you can find in our world is the fact that after 9/11 we have put all our valuable data on central computers that are supposed to be hyper protected and they are. The film demonstrates that they cannot be reached from the outside by hackers but can only be reached from the inside that is to say from these giant central computers themselves because they are absolutely isolated from the outside world and their connection with this outside world is absolutely under digitalized secure surveillance. So the hackers who want to prove the vulnerability of that central computer has to penetrate the fort in which it is located. Only a military operation can do that, but that operation is just plainly unimaginable. The human guards can be killed but they can be so connected to the central security that the alert is given as soon as some sensor senses the attack on the body or mind of the guard and then instead of sending two guards as reinforcement a security wall can fall down that can only be opened from the inside.

The system that is shown here, for our entertainment for sure, is super fragile and super UN-protected. It is less protected than a henhouse against foxes. It is as little protected against the infiltration of terrorists as a sieve is ready to retain water. So that makes the fear ludicrous and the entertainment loses all suspense value and all frightening effect.

Of course John McClane has to have a partner and this time it is a young hacker that the terrorists want to kill and that the FBI wants to interrogate. He becomes the digital mind of McClane and McClane is nothing but the brute force, the basic muscle of the operation. The two together are funny in a way since they are so different and one could be the father of the other.

But the film is funny though the digital special effects are so visibly artificial, not even analogue, that they become cinematographic anecdotes. I think these action films have lost something g with the massive shift to digital special effects. They just look unreal and whats more we recognize the special effect maker and then we recognize a special effect we have already seen in some other films. We may even wonder if they are after all not plainly the same.

BRUCE WILLIS  A GOOD DAY TO DIE HARD  2013

After the daughter endangered in the previous and fourth installment of Die Hard, now in the fifth installment we get the son, John McLane Jr., who is the partner of his own father as a CIA agent in Moscow. We had to fall, sooner or later, in the anti-Russian cold war atmosphere. I am afraid though Bourne and Taken do that type of action film a little bit better. Here it is too gross, too thick, too much deconstruction and not enough subtlety.

The two McLanes find themselves on the same mission but from two different agencies, one CIA and the other NYPD, or is it FBI? They have to recuperate a political prisoner who is going to be tried in Moscow for some unclear reason. We all know Russia is a dictatorship. That type of clich is slightly too schematic to be believable. But it is a lot worse than that. The two American agencies were completely fooled if not bamboozled. The political prisoner is a personal friend of the president of Russia, follow my eyes and read my lips. But he is using both the Americans and the Russian security services to have the president assassinated and to take over.

His daughter is the main in-between triple agent and she succeeds perfectly well. The two McLanes are just following the trend and get completely ridiculed and nearly killed. But they manage to get to the secret abandoned nuclear facility, probably Chernobyl which is not in Russia but in Ukraine, but who cares about the place and name. From Moscow to that place anyway it takes about thirty seconds on the screen, in real time about a couple of hours. Distances are not exactly correct.

There they find the dear father who is pretending to be very sick though he has killed with his daughter quite a few of the Russian secret agents. The supposed report hidden in this place does not exist and then the mission is reduced to killing the triple agents, destroying a helicopter, etc. They do this is in a jiffy and they survive all the mayhem with hardly a scratch. They get out of Russia with no problem whatsoever and they arrive in some American airport where the daughter McLane is waiting for them. We just wonder why they bothered to get involved in what was a purely Russian domestic political game. I guess American security agencies are no longer what they used to be.

Lets hope there will not be a sequel to that. We have reached the third underground level under well devised action films. Lets say they were part of the anti-Russian campaign for the Olympic Games. Viva la new era Cold War! I am sure Ron L. Hubbard must be turning in his tomb in total clarity.

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: Here you get Five awesome Blu-ray discs and they include in this Deluxe Limited Edition Collection DigiBook the following Blu-ray discs and they include: Die Hard; Die Hard 2: Die Harder; Die Hard With A Vengeance; Live Free or Die Hard [Die Hard 4.0] and Decoding Die Hard.

Over the last twenty years, John McClane [Bruce Willis] has become such an iconic part of the action-film landscape that it's hard to remember a time when he wasn't etched in our pop culture consciousness. Starting with 'Die Hard,' and continuing through three sequels, the character has proven to be one of the most durable in a very fickle genre. Aside from James Bond and Indiana Jones, there may be no other action movie hero who has lasted as long or remained as beloved by audiences. John McClane redefined the boundaries of the action archetype; bringing warmth, humour, unpredictability, and an almost fanciful sense of masculine daring do to the genre.

'Die Hard' [1988] Was of course, the first film that started it all, and it broke all preconceptions for what an action hero could be. Bruce Willis' John McClane is a NYC cop who has (reluctantly) flown to Los Angeles to reconcile with his upwardly-mobile wife Holly Gennaro-McClane [Bonnie Bedelia], but he ends up trapped in a skyscraper with a bunch of mercenary thugs led by the snivelling Hans Gruber [Alan Rickman]. The simple premise, great action, airtight execution, and unlike the muscled action heroes of other films, John McClane is not a superman, but rather just an ordinary guy stuck in an extraordinary situation. His cocky facade masks a palpable vulnerability, but that only makes him even more courageous. By the time he gets around to kicking Hans Gruber's ass at the film's end, he's already rewritten every clich in the action film playbook.

Just wrapping up his run in TV's 'Moonlighting,' Bruce Willis was at his hungriest in 'Die Hard,' and he almost single-handedly carries the entire movie on his well-oiled shoulders. John McClane's got more quips than James Bond and Freddy Krueger put together, but somehow Willis makes the character endearing rather than smarmy. Alan Rickman is also the best villain of the entire 'Die Hard' series, coming off as the kind of uber-nasty psycho who would stab you with a knife, lick off the blood, and then stab you again. And the seemingly incongruous pairing of Bruce Willis and Bonnie Bedelia manages to generate real sparks, making us actually believe that this guy would risk everything to save his wife, instead of just another tired plot device. Add to that John McTiernan's economical direction and a breathless set of stunt sequences that still hold up, and 'Die Hard' stands head-to-head with the absolute best action flicks of the 1980s.

Die Hard 2: Die Harder [1990] Hit screens only two years later in 1990 and was essentially a remake of the first film, only this time set at an airport with a whole group of psycho terrorist baddies who like to crash planes for fun and profit. After they take control of the airport and demand millions, John McClane must outwit their superior technology while again dealing with a bumbling police bureaucracy. Meanwhile, John McClane's wife (a returning Bonnie Bedelia), is stuck high above in one of the circling planes.

Aided by a bigger budget and the energetic direction of Renny Harlin ['Cliffhanger' and 'The Covenant'], 'Die Hard 2' pumps up the formula that worked so well in the first film, and it's almost as much fun, although the seams of the formula show through at times. There's an element of freshness missing (Bruce Willis' wink-wink quips have already grown slightly stale), and the villains are nowhere near as memorable as the scenery-chewing Alan Rickman. And why has the spunky Bonnie Bedelia been banished to a cheap seat in coach for the entire film? Still, there's enough of the old John McClane magic left in Die Hard 2: Die Harder to make it worth a return visit.

Next we have 'Die Hard with a Vengeance' [1995]. This time, a crazed mad bomber named Simon Gruber [Jeremy Irons] has an axe to grind against John McClane, and is planting explosives all over New York City. With the help of a local shop owner Zeus Carver [Samuel L. Jackson], John McClane must complete a series of tasks laid out by Simon Gruber, or innocent civilians will die. Eventually, the madman's true motivations will be revealed, but they aren't as exciting as the build-up would leave you to believe.

'Die Hard with a Vengeance' sees the return of director John McTiernan to the franchise, and also opens up the milieu considerably, with John McClane hitting so many scenic stops in the Big Apple that he might as well be a tour guide. Unfortunately, what worked so well in the first 'Die Hard' was its sense of confinement and claustrophobia, and 'Vengeance' just isn't as fun or suspenseful. The script is also ham-fisted in its attempt to weave in social commentary (the Jackson character seems to face bigotry at every turn, all in wholly contrived ways). And with Bonnie Bedelia bowing out of this third outing, there is little personal drama for John McClane, so we barely feel invested in the eventual outcome of all the carnage. 'Die Hard with a Vengeance' is certainly my least favourite of the series.

Fast-forward over a decade and we have 'Live Free or Die Hard' [Die Hard 4.0] [2007]. Surprisingly, things get back on track with this long-in-development fourth entry, which turned out to be one of the biggest hits of year. John McClane is still as ornery and resourceful as ever, albeit a bit more grizzled. This time, he's up against the crazed Thomas Gabriel [Timothy Olyphant], who's out to ""redeem"" America with an all-out attack on its technological infrastructure. With the FBI unable to catch the criminal mastermind, it's up to John McClane and a geeky hacker [Justin Long] to foil the villain's plot, as well as save John McClane's daughter Lucy [Mary Elizabeth Winstead].

Directed by Len Wiseman ['Underworld'], 'Live Free or Die Hard' works as a surprisingly resonant retelling of the ""aging old relic story,"" where the fighter must jump back into the ring for one last fight to ensure his legacy. But it also doesn't forget what made the first film such a gas, giving us wall-to-wall old-school action that needs little assistance from overdone CGI or slapdash music video editing. 'Live Free or Die Hard' is both modern and retro, giving us all the stunts, explosions, humour and ridiculous violence we loved the first time around, but also throwing in enough new emotional wrinkles for the John McClane character that it doesn't all feel stale. It's the perfect sequel that plays just as well to newbies as it does long-time fans of the series.

As a franchise, the Die Hard series stands tall. In the character of John McClane, Bruce Willis found his best-ever role, and with a combination of brawn, brains and snarky wit, created a whole new icon of the action movie. Add to that some of the most top-notch stunt sequences and effects the genre has ever seen, and you have a series of four films that truly do rival such legendary franchises as James Bond, The Terminator and Mad Max. I can't claim that the 'Die Hard' series hasn't had its ups and downs, but even in its weakest moments, the Die Hard series has never been less than a total blast.

Blu-ray Video Quality  20th Century Fox Home Entertainment brings 'Die Hard: 25th Anniversary Collection' to Blu-ray in a handsome and sturdy five-disc box set. The package is shaped and opens much like a book with new artwork corresponding to each movie. Those same pages also serve as sleeves for each disc which slide out by placing some slight pressure to the top and bottom, widening the mouth a little. The inside is smooth and glossy to prevent the discs from scratching. All four films come on separate discs while the fifth disc contains a brand-new retrospective. The book comes with a side-sliding slipcover made of a hard cardboard material with a picture of Bruce Willis on the front and very lightly textured. At start up, each disc goes straight to an animated menu screen with colourful graphics and music playing in the background.

'Die Hard' as with all the films in this 25th Anniversary collection, the first film in the franchise arrives with the identical encode [2.35:1] as the previous 2007 release. And frankly, the source used for this high-definition transfer is in excellent condition, giving fans the best possible presentation imaginable of an awesome 1980s action classic. Fine lines and textures are sometimes highly detailed and very well-defined with several shockingly revealing close-ups, exposing pores, wrinkles and trivial blemishes on the faces of ever actor. Beads of sweat shimmer in the light while dirt and grime is made plainly visible covering John McClane's entire body. Contrast is terrifically well-balanced and crisp while black levels are true and penetrating. Colours are bold and energetic, and a very thin layer of grain provides the video with an appreciable cinematic quality.

Die Hard 2: Die Harder sadly, this sequel is the slightly weakest of the bunch with an average, only mildly impressive encoded transfer. The presentation has its moments, for sure, particularly at the beginning when there is plenty of daylight, but as we move into night-time, the quality diminishes quite a bit. Granted, this is due to the original photography and not faults in the encoded image, but nonetheless, it's not as pretty as the other films. Although showing a welcomed film-like quality, grain tends to fluctuate from scene to scene while black levels range from accurate and true to a tad murky and flat. Definition is strong for a good chunk of the time but overall unimpressive with several soft scenes. On the other hand, contrast is well-balanced and stable, and colours are mostly bold and animated with good skin tones and textures in facial complexions.

'Live Free or Die Hard' [Die Hard 4.0] [2007] Being the most recent of the series, the fourth instalment offers the best and often stunning high-definition presentation of the bunch. With a squeaky-clean, crystal-clear encode image leading the way, the video shows sharp, well-defined lines in the foliage of trees, along the side of buildings and down to individual threads of costumes. Every shard, fragment and debris from car crashes and explosions is plainly visible as they fly everywhere, and Bruce Willis is really starting to show his age by this point, as every wrinkle and blemish is exposed. Contrast is spot-on with crisp, brilliant whites, allowing for excellent visibility into the far distance. Black levels are inky rich with superb gradational details within the deepest, darkest shadows, providing the 2.35:1 image with plenty of depth. Colours are vibrant and accurately rendered with primaries looking particularly energetic.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  As with the Video Quality, here is the Audio Quality of each Blu-ray disc is as follows:

'Die Hard' [1988] With our rugged, blue-collar hero also arrives with the same DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack as before, and it's a fantastic listen. Considering its age and the period of when it was made, the original design is not the sort to go toe-to-toe with your more modern action spectacular, but it sure puts up a hell of a fight for a 25-year-old film. Mostly contained in the fronts, the soundstage is wide and welcoming. Especially with the fun and pretty-clever music of Michael Kamen, imaging feels expansive, with excellent fidelity and full of warmth while very lightly bleeding into the surrounds. Dynamic range is clean and precise with outstanding distinct detailing in the instrumentation, and dialogue reproduction remains well-prioritised throughout. Best of all is a robust and impactful low-end with tons of highly-responsive and punchy bass. Each bullet and punch comes with serious weight and force while explosions and helicopter blades penetrate deep into the room with awesome wall-rattling effect.

Die Hard 2: Die Harder [1990] Compared to the others in the series, this DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack is not quite up to the task, which is not to say it is bad. It's just not as noteworthy and is comparatively the scrawniest of the bunch. Although very subtle and somewhat restrained, rear activity is still plentiful, with several great atmospherics inside the airport. Sudden bursts of action and gunfire continue supplying the surrounds with many discrete effects, but imaging is mostly a front-heavy presentation. Dialogue and character interactions are generally loud and clear in the centre, but once in a while, voices tend to get lost in the commotion, slightly overwhelmed by the explosions and barrage of bullets. Nevertheless, dynamic range remains clean and precise, with excellent distinction and separation in the upper frequencies. Low bass is not very commanding or potent, but it's effective and adds some gravity to action sequences.

'Die Hard with a Vengeance' [1995] Arrives with an enjoyable and highly amusing 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack which packs the action with a great deal of fun and excitement. Rear activity is very subtle but at a near constant with discrete effects of city noise and traffic, generating a pleasant and satisfying sound field. Panning and movement during action sequences are flawless with bullets and debris whizzing by in all directions or with the sounds of sirens echoing through the busy streets. In the fronts, dialogue is well-prioritized and intelligible from beginning to end, and channel separation is terrifically well-balanced with several convincing off-screen effects which create a wide and spacious soundstage. The mid-range is clean and precise with excellent clarity in the upper frequencies. Sadly, low bass is not as powerful and commanding as I would have liked, making a couple explosive moments feeling somewhat wanting, but overall, the lossless mix offers plenty of entertaining impact.

'Live Free or Die Hard' [Die Hard 4.0] [2007] This 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack may be identical to the previous release but it remains and continues to be one of the best available on Blu-ray. All manner of noise, chaos and mayhem spreads into every corner of the room and with flawless panning, creating a highly satisfying 360 degrees sound field. The smallest debris and piece of rubble falls all around the listener with excellent discrete clarity while bullets and helicopters fly overhead. The action continues to excite with a broad and expansive soundstage that creates a massive wall of sound while delivering precise, well-prioritized dialogue in the centre. The mid-range is extensive with room-penetrating clarity that's dynamic and sharply detailed, allowing for the tiniest shard of metal or falling glass to be perfectly heard. The best attribute of this lossless mix is without question the authoritative low-end, which effectively reaches ultra-low frequencies with commanding force. Explosions and bullets not only rattle the wattles, but they're felt hard in the chest and vibrate the couch with each shot.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras: 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment recycles the same set of supplements as the previous Blu-ray release but not from the inferior NTSC DVD Five-Star Edition, making the majority of this release a simple repackaging.

2945556,4,B000VM8YCI,"While I've no doubt that we'll eventually see a Die Hard box set that includes the current 5th film in the series (which is just absolutely dreadful) alongside the inevitable sixth one, this box set containing the first 4 films is a winner considering the $20 price point that Amazon currently has it on (this writing is dated 12/9/13). The first in the series is a downright classic and has a super high replay value. Enough has been said about that film so it's redundant for me to go into how amazingly awesome it is. It's nearly a perfect action film. In my personal opinion I feel that the 2nd film is a cheap and subpar ripoff of the first film. It basically takes the premise of the first one and transports it to an airport. I know this film has its fans but I do not, and will never, consider myself one of them. The third one is the one I grew up watching the most out of the 3 (it was always on HBO and I actually saw this one before I had ever seen part 1). It's a completely different animal compared to the first two and works more like a thriller than a straight up action movie (though part 3 does have some pretty awesome action set pieces). Part 3 is an incredibly well-paced and exciting film. As for the fourth, the more I watch it the more I like it. This is the slickest looking out of all the 4 films. And while this is the movie that transformed John McClane into a superhero rather than keeping him a Regular Joe, it's still a fun flick to watch. The extras in this set are kinda skimpy considering there's nothing really new that's being offered here for fans. Most of the extras have seen the light of day before in previous DVD and Blu ray releases save for a few new featurettes. But for $20 you cannot go wrong considering that I'd pay that amount just for the first and 3rd films alone.",1386547200,,1817,4.239193083573487

Tried on 3 different players and same problem on all.  Sadly, I didn't go to watch one of them soon enough and can not return them ( missed by 6 days ) Don't waste your time or money on this set and save yourself a trip to UPS return this.

There is over 6 hours of total bonus content in this collection but there are a few problems that prevent this set from being deluxe. Die Hard and Die Harder have fairly average picture quality. Live Free is the PG-13 theatrical cut not the unrated version. The special features are in SD (they haven't been remastered). The fifth film, A Good Day to Die Hard, is not included.

2945603,5,B000VM8YCI,A beautiful set stylized kind of like a book with each page containing the blu-ray disc (in which is easy to retrieve unlike other set that forces me to damage the disc to get them out). Each movie could have been restored a little better since it's blu-ray and wished the Live Free or Die Hard included here was the unrated cut but overall a great collection that doesn't include the latest awful Good Day to Die Hard which does not even feel like a Die Hard movie so this is the best damn good-looking Die Hard collection you can expect to buy. Each page has a good looking bad-ass art of each movie and as a bonus they give a Decoding Die Hard disc for the fans. Live free or buy hard...it's not even that expensive so it's very worth it.,1375488000,,741,4.225352112676056

I was pondering waiting to buy the inevitable ""complete collection"" after ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" was released, but since that film was probably the most disappointing movie of the last decade (and certainly the worst action movie of 2013), I'm sure happy I fortuitously spent the 30-ish bucks on this earlier in the year!",1373932800,2,378,4.742424242424242

I have 2 blu-ray players and Disc 1 would not work on either.  I tired the other 4 discs and they all worked.  Only disc 1 was defective.  I also tested my players for firmware updates but none were needed.  I exchanged the set at target but when I returned home I had the same problem again!!  Disc 1 wouldn't load.  All the other discs were fine once again.  I drove back to Target and exchanged it again.  My 3rd set was finally not defective.  All 5 discs are working.  Pretty sad manufacturing and quality control.  If you buy this set make sure you test all the discs right away after purchasing.

2945623,5,B000VM8YCI,"In 1988 John McClane bust on the screen in the action movie ""Die Hard"".  Working with a budget of $28 million the film grossed $83 million domestically and $140.7 million worldwide.
Die Hard established a lasting image that time has not faded.  Over the years, three sequels followed each one doing well but never hitting the mark like the original.
A fifth film, not included in this set, is in stores now.  While this is no guarantee that a person will like the films, it says a large number of people have liked them.

Bruce Willis is a very tuff loner with a smart mouth who manages to stumble upon a well-organized criminal group at work.
Over the next two hours, more or less, he manages to upset their plans and stop the crime.  This involves a great deal of gunfire, fights and great stunts.
All of this is set to snappy dialog as McClane triumphs over great odds.  Unless you have spent the last 25-years off world, you already know the story lines.

This is a very handsome set.  The five discs, four movies and special features, are housed in a book like album in a slipcase.
Each disc is one page of the book.  As you turn the pages, each two-page set is fully illustrated with pictures from the movie and John McClane as he looks in the move.
Decoding Die Hard is a series of features on the stories, villains, sidekicks and place in film history.  These are new features, the actors have aged, that benefit from hindsight.

Copy quality and sound are excellent.  The picture is very clear and crisp with excellent color.
The background music is not allowed to step all over the dialog.

This might be the nicest of the Die Hard collections.  They will have to do something really spectacular to make a better one.",1372896000,2,1727,4.493589743589744

The Design is real cool, good pics, great graphic design... but the movies editions... well... are kind of... lame.
Practicly no extras in the movie disks, no directors cuts, and the bonus disk is not a big deal, a couple of pointless documentaries, trailers and no so much...
if you are desesperate to own the saga buy it, 4 movies for a good price, if you can wait then do it until they edit the next boxset with a good day to die hard and directors cuts",1372377600,,622,4.3247863247863245

2945642,4,B000VM8YCI,"First of all. these are great movies transferred onto Blu-ray with excellent sound. Watching these movies again now in HD with THX sound makes for great viewing.

Since I already like these movies (as probably most people here) I won't go into the content of the movies. Besides, there are plenty of true movie reviews available on actual movie review sites. I will rate the product (movies as well as format and quality) I received.

This ""boxed"" set is exactly that...a cardboard boxed set with a pull-out DVD holder. It is firm quality (strong) cardboard with smooth coated inserts for the DVDs. The movies are a pretty good transfer considering the age of the originals. The sound quality really enhances the enjoyment of these movies.

Overall, I am very happy having these movies on Blu-ray in my collection. I don't think you will be disappointed either especially if you already like Die Hard.

Although I love these movies, I rate the entire product only 4 stars because it's not perfect and does not have as much ""extra"" information as I had hoped. Also, oddly,  these DVDs do not resume play where I left off if I turn my DVD player off and then back on again while the disc is in the tray.",1371600000,3,1201,4.619718309859155

The good guy always win with him overcoming tremendous odds. If you like so called 'MAN MOVIES ' then this collection is definitely  for you. Each movie can stand on it own or it can be watched as part of the larger collection. In summary this collection of 'DIE HARD' movies is well worth it. It one of the first collection of so called 'MAN MOVIES '.",1370908800,,478,4.370786516853933
2945648,5,B000VM8YCI,A must have for die hard fans. Only wish it had the newest movie in it. My husband loved thus gift,1370736000,,98,3.7142857142857144
2945649,5,B000VM8YCI,"John McClane is the quintessential action hero, and this series is one of the most action-packed series ever created.  I cannot believe it has been 25 years since John kicked ""terrorist"" butt all over Nakatomi Plaza.  I remember watching these movies on VHS, and wanted this collection since I saw it released.  I just bought it today,and started watching the first one as soon as I got home.  It absolutely looks amazing and I couldn't be more pleased with the purchase.

The first movie is the absolute best.  There is no comparison to its place in history, and few movies can touch its overall pace and action.  Die Hard IS the definitive top when it comes to action movies, and John McClane continues to go unmatched when it comes to total toughness.  His wittiness and shear grit make him a hollywood classic character.  This is what started the franchise, and he Willis absolutely nails it.  The plot is original and the most intense in the series.  The Blu-Ray version of it is spectacular, and I am amazed at how new this 25 year old movie looks.  Alan Rickman and Bruce Willis are one of the best movie combatting duos of all-time here as McClane and Gruber.

The second movie is by far the worst in the series.  I remember watching it only a few times, and don't remember much of anything that stands out.  I know it's about planes, and that's about it.

The third installment has a great plot, and tremendous acting as well.  Samuel L. Jackson is a good addition, and plays a great sidekick to McClane's lead.  The hoops they have to jump through and mindgames the bad guy makes them jump through are both creative and original.  I can watch this one over and over again, just like the first one.  It never gets old.

The fourth movie has a great updated plot with technology, but doesn't take away much of the action from the original.  The only downfall I saw in this was the whole believability factor.  The first three, as incredible as the plots seemed, were very believable, but this had a lot more over the top sequences.  Even with these, I did like the overall feel of it, and the action was non-stop.  Justin Long's character was great, and John McClane proved again that he was timeless.

I can't believe he has been doing this for 25 years, and want to see the newest one so badly for prosperity's sake.  It can't be any worse than the mindless drivel most movie-makers seem to put out on a yearly basis.  If it has Bruce Willis as John McClane, then I'm at least going to take the time to see it.  This series is a classic and will always hold a special spot for me.  You can't go wrong with this purchase, as you have a great foursome of movies as you can get for the price.",1370649600,,2699,4.426829268292683
2945650,4,B000VM8YCI,"A great collection of the movies that defined its genre. My husband and I enjoy these movies regularly as a fun action packed experience. We are movie buffs and the extra features and the blu-ray quality and clarity had us beaming.

But this review is based upon the set not the movies so I won't digress from the task at hand. I enjoyed the packaging, the pictures were great and the set is obviously compact (great for a bursting shelf!)  The only negative to the packaging is the fact that the disks are slid into cardboard sleeves, but that is common. Plus an extra bonus is when you fan through all the movies you can watch John Mcclane bald, or backwards and watch him grow hair, magically!

So I absolutely recommend this set to action fans, 90's movie fans, or fans of Bruce Willis as a one man wrecking crew. 4.5 stars.",1370390400,2,828,4.434210526315789

The blu ray collection has amazing picture and sound especially if you've got a home entertainment center. The 4th die hard on here is not the unrated edition so just be aware of that. Also, some of the special features are kind of lame, and also some of the audio commentaries are boring to listen to.

2945672,4,B000VM8YCI,"This is a great collection. You get four movies for the price of one. Not only is John McClane an immensely likable and witty character, but the supporting characters throughout the four films are compelling and each Die Hard does an admirable job of setting itself apart from the previous one. Director John McTiernan (who also did Predator) really brought all the elements together for the first movie. And even though there was a change of directors for Die Hard 2, Renny Harlin was up to the task and delivered an exciting sequel. McTiernan came back for Die Hard with a Vengeance and which maintained the series' standard of explosive cat-and-mouse action.

If there is a weak link in this collection, it's probably Live Free or Die Hard. While still entertaining, at PG-13 it feels a bit watered down. Still, I heartily recommend this box set to action fans everywhere.",1366934400,,875,4.833333333333333

After we saw it in the theater late last year (2 hours we'll NEVER get back), we decided to go ahead and get this set. The fact that it was featured as a ""Daily Special"" here on Amazon didn't sway us in the least. We'd have gotten it anyway because we think these movies are genius. How many franchises this old actually get better as they age (the most recent entry notwithstanding)? I think that ""Live Free or Die Hard"" was just about as good as the original (but not quite).

2945718,5,B000VM8YCI,"Love all these movies. It's probably been 7 years since I've seen the first one and as I'm watching it I remembered how much I was a repeat watcher cause I found myself saying the lines of the movie out loud.
The case for the box set is good. I like that you open it up like a book and the disc are easy to pull out. I was afraid to get the box set cause I've had problems in the past with them, like the Star Trek Next Generations movies. In the box, each disc comes with it's own thin case and I ended up with 2 of the same movies. It was a easy return and then I got all the movies and the bonus disc. But then I ordered one for my mom's birthday she was missing one of the movies and had 2 of the bonus disc. So be careful when ordering box set movies. Save your recites, print out the bar code for return orders and drive to your local UPS store.
5 stars cause the movies are great, (can't wait to see the next one even though the reviews say it sucks) a well made box set with all 4 movies plus bonus disc, shipped fast and no damage done.",1363737600,2,1045,3.8425925925925926

I especially like how the characters are developed on both sides (good vs. evil), and so agree with the statement made in all of these movies, ""It's always about the money.""  Am new to blu-ray, and am pleased with the results of conversion for the older movies.  Buy this if you don't already have them or need to replace your old DVDs.",1363564800,,447,4.493827160493828

The transfers are ok for the earlier movies (DH 1 and DH2) and perfect for the newer movies. The packaging is a hardback book format with individual sleeve-style pages for each disk.

I was looking forward to seeing Die Hard 4 it in its full, uncut blu-ray glory and couldn't tell by the description here if the 25th anniversary edition would deliver. It was on sale, so I took a chance. It arrived and I found no mention of rating on the box or the disc, so I popped in Die Hard 4 and...yep, it's the edited, PG-13-rated version. That means John McCane's catchphrase gets cut; that's right, the concluding 4-syllable profanity is cut from John's ""Yippie-ki-yay"" catchphrase. Maybe it's just me, but that alone was so annoying that I returned the whole box set.

Die Hard 5 is out and no doubt a new box set will be forthcoming in the next year. Maybe, just maybe, they'll do it right next time.",1362268800,3,830,4.4183006535947715

Well with the most recent inclusion of Die Hard 5: A Good Day To Die HArd, it is obvious that finally there is a Die Hard film that I do not need to wait around for. Apparently in Die HArd 5 John Mcclain forgets how to deliver hillarious punch lines, opting instead to be a humorless neck head ala his fictional son, who is all business, none of which is funny business. ANYWAY... unfortunately the flawless track record of amazing movie after amazing movie in this franchise has ended. So its safe to stick with the four movie box set, and pretend that John Mcclain never had a son. OR maybe they can bring back John Jr in another attempt somewhere down the road with a more believable proffession (as opposed to a CIA operative!)

Even if Die HArd 4 was a little bit goofy, it still had the heart of a great Die HArd movie and these still remain my fave action movies EVER.., thanks.",1361318400,3,1072,4.275862068965517

2945816,1,B000VM8YCI,"First off, not a review of the movies themselves - I'm a Die Hard fan.

This set, however, has some known issues.  If you search around the net, you will find reports that various discs will not even load up in players - sometimes it's the first disc, sometimes the 4th.  There have been a few reports of all discs loading up, but freezing taking place in the middle of playback.

I tried two different sets in three different blu-ray players.  In two of the three players, the first Die Hard would not even load up.  In the third blu-ray player, it did - however I must point out that this particular blu-ray player is old and has not had a firmware update in years.  Yes, the oldest most out-of-date player is the only one that would read the first Die Hard.  In my ""primary"" blu-ray player, I made sure to have the most up-to-date firmware - and it is connected to the internet for any ""OMG there's a problem with the Die Hard set"" updates that may come flashing across the net.  No luck - still would not work.

The reason I tried two sets is because I took the first set back to Best Buy (where I originally bought), and they tried that set as well as the other copy they had in the store on their players.  I even waited as they updated the firmware on their player - still would not even load up.

I have a feeling many people are buying the set and just shelving it, or watching one or two of the movies, and do not even know that they have a defective set.  From what I've read, since the problem isn't necessarily with the same disc in every set, and since it can also happen mid-way through playback - you're not going to know if you have a problem until you watch all of all four movies.  I don't know of many people who do that with these collections within the 30-day return period.  I was ""lucky"" in that my problem manifested immediately, with both sets, during the first disc.

Regardless - I would be very wary about buying this set.  I am not a fan of people who give bad reviews on Amazon related to a single issue like this, however, in my mind this is a pretty serious flaw in the product.  Some people may go months or even years before actually watching all four movies in the set - and then it will be too late for them to try to get their money back in the case of a problem.",1360972800,17,2301,4.167420814479638

2945835,1,B000VM8YCI,"I had every intention of buying this set.  I already own the previous 4-movie collection that came out several years ago, but I honestly don't mind double dipping if there is a significant upgrade in quality and/or quantity of special features.  It's a well known fact that the previous Die Hard collection had sub-par video transfers on the first 3 films and, perhaps most disappointing of all, it didn't include the (in my opinion) far more superior unrated cut of the 4th film.  As some have pointed out, no there isn't much added in the unrated cut aside from some added gore and cursing, but even those minor editions make it feel so much more like a Die Hard movie than one of the other countless generic action flicks that Bruce Willis has been in over the past decade or two.

So as I was saying, I had every intention of upgrading to this new set, thinking surely it would include the unrated cut and improved video quality.  After all, the previous collection came out almost 6 years ago now...with today's technology, it would cost Fox next to nothing to upgrade the films at least somewhat.  As I did a bit of research, though, I saw more and more indications that the video quality would be identical to the earlier release on the first three films.  This was disappointing, but I still vowed to get the set if it included the unrated cut of Live Free or Die Hard, which nobody seemed to have a difinitive answer as to whether it did or not.  However, as another reviewer pointed out, Fox just put out individual releases of all 4 films (which, for whatever reason, don't seem to be available anywhere but Fox's own website which, if you bought all 4 films, would end up costing you about $80-90) and the fourth one DOES include the unrated cut, so I figured this new set was just a combination of those 4 individual releases.

Well, I was in Target yesterday, and I had the new set in my hand.  I looked at the bottom of the box where it lists the ratings for the films and......PG-13.  It does not include the unrated cut.  It does have an extra disc of bonus content (though, not much) but the 4 films themselves are the same discs included in the previous set that was released over half a decade ago.  I immediately put the set back on the shelf and left.

This is just unforgivable to me.  My initial reaction is ""well this release is just for people who don't have the earlier set and can't wait until the inevitable 5-film collection later this year"", but no, that can't be it.  The earlier set is still widely available (in fact, my local Best Buy had both the new one and the old one side by side on the shelf, and the old one was about $25 cheaper) and contains the same content, save for the few bits of special features which definately don't add up to the larger price tag.  People who want the films now can just get that.  Then, there is undoubtedly another ""ultimate collection"" coming sometime this Summer that will include the upcoming fifth movie, as well as all the bonus content for the other films they left out on this one.  So then, if this set is not for the casual fans who want all 4 now and can just get the older/cheaper set, and it is not for the hardcore fans that are willing to wait for the 5-film ultimate collection, who exactly is it for?  The only answer I can think of is that it is meant for people lacking the resources or knowledge to be able to reseach it the way I have and know that there is a cheaper, virtually identical set still available.  It is meant to trap people uneducated on this product into paying around $40 when they can get the old set for between $10 and $20.  I find this dispicable, and if I didn't love the series so much I wouldn't even bother going to see the new movie or buying the next collection.  But alas, I love Die Hard so all I can do is not buy this set and warn other buyers about it, and just wait for the next collection.

I don't like leaving one-star reviews for products I haven't personally purchased, but in this case I have done my homework on it and want to make sure other people don't get fooled by Fox's shady practices.  If you need a Die Hard fix now, buy the older collection that was released in 2007.  You can get it really cheap.  If you are able to wait, wait until May or June sometime when the fifth movie, A Good Day to Die Hard, is released on Blu-ray.  There will inevitably be another collection coming out then with the features that should have been on this one.

EDIT 3/4/13: Well, I found the new individual Blu-ray releases of the 4 films that were previously only available on Fox's website in Best Buy the other day.  As mentioned, the one for Live Free or Die Hard does include the unrated cut, but ONLY on DVD.  The only version on the actual Blu-ray disc is the theatrical version.  So, once again, wait until a 5 film set comes out to get the movies....don't bother with this 25th Anniversary set or the 4 individual Blu-ray releases.  The only way to currently see the unrated cut of Die Hard 4 in high definition is on iTunes.",1359504000,41,5055,4.343617021276596

Next comes the packaging, not the easiest to get the disc out and besides some nice collage of images for each movie there's not much else to say. DO NOT BUY to upgrade previous 4 movie set. The documentary in disc 5 is not even 2 hours and all they show additional to that is all of the trailers for die hard. Nothing worth the extra 40 bucks!!  I just couldn't believe they wouldn't put the unrated version of Live Free or Die Hard in this collection on blu ray. Additionally they don't give you any of the movies rating so you can buy this version hoping you'd get the unrated version. No die hard should ever be PG-13. That is a disgrace to the franchise.

The first 2 films, while being the cornerstone for the franchise, are of the worst video quality. While it still isn't bad by any means, they look like they are just up-scaled from the original DVD format, and not actually remastered. The audio on the other hand is fantastic with deep, crisp sound and bass.
The 3rd and 4th films look much better with the 4th looking the best. The audio is also wonderful, a masterpiece for any sound system connected to your TV.
Special features are what you would expect..behind the scenes, interviews, commentary...nothing out of the ordinary and nothing exceptional, but I am one who doesn't buy these kinds of products just because of the special features.
My only gripe is that the 4th film included in this collection is the standard version and not the unrated. Many fans (including myself) take the PG-13 rating as a huge slap in the face..part of the story and part of John McClane's character is about being brash, brutal and uncensored. To not hear the ""yippie Ki-Yay"" line in its entirety is just plain stupid. And the uncensored version should have been included for the fans.
All in all..this is a must own for your blu-ray collection. Hands down, if you've enjoyed any of the Die Hard films without seeing any others, you most definitely would love them all, so its a no brainier to own this awesome collection.

2945855,2,B000VM8YCI,"Cannot believe (actually I can) Fox blew off on remastering these titles. The first time these were released were several years ago and HD technolgy has come a long way since then. These are EXACTLY the same discs as released before (except new labels and packaging) with a fifth disc thrown in to promote the new Die Hard movie (that is not worth the price of these re-treads). This is downright wrong on Fox's part to just repackage a midiocre product and resale it to us fans. Don't even get me going about the fourth one still NOT being the unrated version.
Once again Fox is just out to make money and not to promote a high quality product. Maybe when the fifth one comes to blu ray, will we get another box set? Who knows and at this point in the game, who cares.
I am tired of throwing my hard earned bucks to the cheap company's like Fox. What a wasted opportunity.
If you don't have this set, get the older one because its cheaper. If you own the old one, don't bother upgrading. It is not worth it!! Sad day for us fans!
ADDED ON 2/14/2013: JUST SAW THE DIE HARD MOVIE MARATHON AT MY LOCAL AMC THEATER IN DALLAS.
  HOLD OFF ON GETTING THIS RETREAD SET. FOX HAS REMASTERED THE FOUR FILMS
  AND THEY LOOKED AND SOUNDED AWESOME!!  WHY FOX DID NOT RELEASE THESE
  VERSIONS ON THIS 25TH ANNIVERSARY COLLECTION IS BEYOND ME.
  I just hope I am right. The fifth Die Hard movie should be
  out on home video in a few months, but not sure when Fox will

I was also a little hesitant because some of the reviews were saying the quality was bad & you should wait for better copies. I waited long enough & took a chance. These are all so much better than the dvd's. I watch the Blu-ray version & then put on the dvd version & go from scene to scene & see what the quality is like compared to the Blu-Ray. No comparison. Blu-Ray wins. Even if the movie isn't 100% better it's still far better than the regular dvd, in my opinion, & that's what counts, on MY review. The quality seems to get better on each film. Less & less grain on each one,although it was never a real problem for me. The audio seemed really good on all {4} films but I listen through external speakers hooked up to my stereo. Nothing fancy here, just good old fashioned stereo. The special features get better on each disc too. I really wanted the movies more so than the special features anyway.

I realize that Die Hard and Die Hard 2 are fairly old movies now but this is Blu-ray and the picture quality is pretty pathetic on those disc when compared with the third and fourth films in the series.

FOX did an amazing restoration job on the first two films in the Alien franchise, so why no love for Die Hard? It really could have used it! Ultimately I got this set for a really low price and I like the films enough to only be minorly disappointed with the poorer picture quality of the first two movies.",1345766400,,649,4.233870967741935

I bought this set when it was on sale, and I wasn't expecting it to be the be all end all for blu-ray sets, but I was expecting a better set. The first Die Hard movie suffers from a really lackluster transfer, and no special features of which to talk about. As you progress through the series, there is a definite improvement in the quality of the picture. Die Hard 2 and Die Hard 3 look much better than Die Hard, and Live Free or Die Hard looks fantastic. Again, this set is for those who are looking for just the movies and nothing else. The price I got them for is great, which is why I'm giving it 5 out of 5 instead of 4 out of 5. Great movies, but Fox should give these movies a better HD transfer.",1344988800,,832,4.048484848484849

It comes with 8 dvd's in 4 cases. (One on each side) In the beginning of all the movies the menus are 3d like at the movie theaters. It was a good touch and looked cool. The first 3 are rated R and the 4th is PG-13 or Unrated. The case is tough papery cardboard. One of the sides is open to put the dvd's in. The movie cases are those really thin ones like 2 cm thick. Great movie edge of your seat action. The unrated version has more swearing but it will not show up in the subtitles for some reason...

2945896,5,B000VM8YCI,"I was going to buy movies 1 and 3, but this set was a but cheaper in the end, so I grabbed it. My personal opinions on the quality of these films is 1, 3, 4/2. 2 and 4 are tied.

Video quality: All movies are 2.39:1. Live Free or Die Hard Is certainly the best-looking, but no real surprise. One looks the poorest, since it was not remastered. 2 and 3 are fine. not super-awesome, but good.

Audio quality: A mix of Dolby and DTS. naturally, DTS sounds better. Being a newer recording, 4 sounds the best of the set, and 1 the poorest. I really hoped that the levels would have been fixed for the original, but no.

The originally still a favourite movie for me, even after all these years. All-in-all a very good action movie set. If you want a more detailed review, just look at individual reviews.

I never look at the extras, so I cannot comment on that. The packaging is pretty good and discs pop in and out securely; not too easy, not too hard. they stay in place and are raised from the surface - something i really hate about too-thin disc cases.",1324512000,6,1053,4.223880597014926

But when I searched for my copy of the first Die Hard, I soon remembered that I had sold it years ago, immediately after buying it.  Why?  Because the picture quality was a disgrace.  The very first release of the DVD was NON-anamorphic, grainier than a good VHS tape, and as faded as an unrestored movie print half a century old.  The same miserable quality affected other Fox releases at the time, some of them long-awaited treasures (for me), like several of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals.  I ALMOST ordered the 4-disk BluRay set tonight, until I read the warnings from several disappointed customers.  I am not surprised at anything Fox does, or FAILS to do.  The chorus of boos over those original DVD's was deafening, and after a few years Fox released better, anamorphic versions.  But why should customers tolerate abysmal Bluray engineering from big, rich studios, when small labels are producing ten dollar Blurays of B-movies that look magnificent?

There was some question in the reviews as to whether it was the unrated version, which makes me question why they would review a product that they don't own.  Now the really big question for me at least is what medium to buy this movie on.  I got a blu ray player last year, and rented the original die hard on blu ray, and have to say that i was disappointed.  When I first got the blu ray player i was originally going ro just rebuy most of the movies in my collection, but I was starting to see that movies made before 2000, or some made just after, just don't look very good in high def.  Some studios really put the time and money into making their classics really look amazing, but Fox just really hasn't done that for its old movies yet, and though Die Hard is by far one of if not the greatest action movie of all time, I would reccoment getting the set on DVD.  The only movie in the set that is going to look better (if not worse) on Blu Ray is Live Free or Die Hard, which is by far the worst movie in the set, so I would reccomend getting it on DVD, or find the Die Hard Trilogy on DVD and getting Live Free or Die Hard on Blu Ray if you are a completionist, or just really like that movie for some reason, but for most fans, this will do nicely.  As far as the movies go, as previously stated Die Hard, the original, is a classic, and easily the best action movie ever made.  Up until Die Hard, action movies were either the tense cat and mouse movies, or over the top (Looke at the director's own Predator, especially the fight in the compound) and when Die Hard came along, it was the idea that the person at the center of an over the top situation could still be human and vulnerable, but it was his will (and wit) that would keep him going when average people would just give up.  It was his love of his family, but that also is a convaluted mess.  Life isn't easy, and there are a lot of pieces that fail within the society, and a lot of people that don't want to get their hands dirty, and the hard works get passed down to John, not because he is the best, but because he won't let it go.  I can tell you having worked in the government that so many things get through the cracks, and the people that get things done because of a sense of duty that they won't give up is at the heart of this movie.  This movie is about not giving up, even though it seems like life is against you because there are too many people in suits that are only interested about what they can acquire, and the world changes more and more to where the buck keeps getting passed.  The whole movie keeps movie on with a dying cowboy breed motif and killer dialogue, and complete control from the director, not to mention great director of photography in jan debont, who went on to direct speed, and also dp for robocop as well as a lot of verhoven's other work, so just a great film all around.  The second tried to be too similar to the first.  It was actually the first Die Hard movie I saw, and though at the time I was in love with the movie, it really doesn't compare to the original in terms of pacing and action, so i have to say it seems a little too much, as in one man couldn't do all that, and becomes a little too cartoony, such as the airplane explosion where he survives via the ejection seat, even though there is no way he would have escaped without internal injuries.  It tries too hard to improve upon a perfect film.  The third film spends a majority of the movie with a buddy team between McClain and Samual L. Jackson, whose racial tensions seem too much of a rip off between what Bruce already did better in the Last Boy Scout, however the twists and turns, not to mention that it doesn't seem as unrealistic in its action sequences.  If you take the best moments from the first two sequals and leave the bad parts you get the first films equal, however the fourth film is just complete garbage.  I remember seeing it in theaters dispite it having a pg 13 rating which should have been my first clue, but I remember the studio talking about it being a hard pg 13 and that there would be a unrated, or really an r rated cut on dvd, however it doesn't help a really tired and unbelevable set of action sequences that do not remind me of the first at all.  its one man takes on a jet plane, and lives.  its like bad video game cgi with McClain insight and one liners interjected.  Over all a really great set of movies, and worth watching all the way through, because you know part five will come out eventually.  I hope they kill off our protaganist so they will stop doing stupid sequels.",1300492800,7,4788,4.1457883369330455
2945916,2,B000VM8YCI,"Great through the first three but number 4 ""Live Free or Die Hard"" was defective. I'll see what Amazon's customer service will do about this.",1295222400,2,141,4.68
2945917,4,B000VM8YCI,"The first two are great because it involves Bruce Willis risking his life for the love of his wife. But, ""Die Hard with a Vengeance"", is typical ignorant Hollywood loud action simple-minded brainless entertainment for people who don't like to think too hard.

This is so typical of Blockbuster movie entertainment. You get two guys who just meet each other, they feel compelled to work with each other although they practically can't stand each other, but yet they carry on like husband and wife with their pansy bickering. Then, what's really stupid that comes with alot of dumb Hollywood films, you get a terrorist who likes to talk in poetry, through an anonymous phone call, about his next terrorist act. Jeez, that is so dumb! The cops are trying to show their cunning and intelligence with serious acting over an overall stupid idea that some professional terrorist is actually enjoying dropping clues about his next move. How can any viewer take this seriously?

I like the first two, but I traded away the third one at the used CD/DVD store, when I had the DVD set.

I thought that ""Live Free and Die Hard"" was a better comeback for Bruce Willis, so it's unfortunate to have to keep this crappy third release in my library.  It stunk so bad, I just refused to have it in my DVD library.  This same outcome applies to how I approach the ""Indiana Jones"" movie series.  The third film with Harrison Ford and Sean Connery (it should have been great, but it wasn't.  Two great stars who cancel each other out as who really leads in the film) just wasn't as great as the first two.  This new fourth ""Indiana Jones' should be a respectable comeback for Harrison Ford.  I hope.

Getting back to ""Die Hard"": The only films that I saw that were stupider than ""Die Hard with a Vengeance"", were ""Tango and Cash"", ""Red Heat"", ""Lethal Weapon"" (yes, all of them), ""Rush Hour"" (I hate it when black people are made to act ignorant or proudly lazy, it only promotes prejudice) and the ultimate (how could people be so stupid to let this scenario happen) blockbuster film: ""Con-Air"".

Bruce Willis' ""Armageddon"" was also ""over the top"" stupid. ""Deep Impact"" was a better, more realistic approach to the same subject.",1290297600,2,2206,4.674418604651163

I'm not that much of a stickler when it comes to quality as long as it's not so bad that I really notice, which I didn't.
However I had 2 problems with this particular set. First, half of the little tabs that are supposed to hold the DVDs in the cases were broken so all the DVDs were loose. And second, all 4 of the movie discs had one place during the movie where it skipped to the next scene (the 1st one actually had 3 skip places). Cleaning the disc and the lens on the player didn't make any difference.
The movies of course are great action flicks, but people who don't like a lot of explosions and violence should stay away. Just wish Bruce Willis hadn't been bald in the final movie, he looked ridiculous. And also that the set didn't have these little flaws.",1279065600,3,927,4.155555555555556

2945935,5,B000VM8YCI,"This is Bruce Willis' defining collection, The Die Hard Tetralogy. As a huge Bruce Willis fan I was very excited to get this because it's a 4-disc set of his greatest movies ever. I really don't have a favorite movie because this is a very rarely collection, in that each film is as good as the last/next.

Included in this set:

Die Hard (1988)
Rated-R/112 mins.
It's Christmas Eve and Bruce is on a mission to save an entire building from a slew of terrorists.
5/5 stars

Die Hard 2: Die Harder (1990)
Rated-R/124 mins.
This time Bruce is trying to save a D.C. airport from complete and total destruction.
5/5 stars

Die Hard With a Vengeance (1995)
Rated-R/131 mins.
Teamed with Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce is on the streets of New York, playing a deadly game of Simon says.
5/5 stars

Live Free or Die Hard (2007)
Rated-PG-13/107 mins.
Bruce now has to contend with cyber-terrorists in this 21st century thrill-fest.
5/5 stars

Each disc includes a TON of extras, too. Each movie/disc includes trailers, featurettes, movies, documentaries, interviews, bonus clips and alternate endings. I especially enjoyed the ""Die Hard With a Vengeance"" alternate ending. It was so funny and so different from how the movie actually ended.

All of the movies look pristine in 1080p blu-ray. I never saw Bruce look or sound so great. This includes 'lossless audio' as well as 'smart menu technology' (the ability to use the menu while the movie is up on the screen).

This comes packaged in a standard blu ray case and the size of this 4-disc collection is roughly the size of 1 standard DVD. Isn't that cool? Each disc includes a color silkscreen picture of Bruce from that particular movie, as well.

I understand Bruce is in negotiations to make ""Die Hard 5"" and can only imagine that it will be just as exciting and thrilling as these 4 movies are. If you have any interest in action, adventure and even comedy you must get this set.",1268179200,5,1923,4.665680473372781

2945939,5,B000VM8YCI,"The 2 first Die Hard movies really represent the apogee of the Action Movie genre in the 20th century. The movies were such tour de force and departures from the regular genre formula of the 80's. Consequently many movies tried to emualte the formula, which is where the labels ""Die Hard in the seas"" (Under Siege) or ""Die Hard in the ...""  became essential to describe many 90's films. But the success was never replicated.
Furthermore, John McClane played brilliantly by Bruce Willis, in my humble opinion is the greatest action hero of his era. No longer are we exposed to the brain dead marine, super juiced martial art expert who could take down a battalion without breaking sweat. McClane is a common man, a regular NYC cop, who happens to be at the wrong place @ the wrong time confronted with impossible odds and who makes it out alive by a combination of his wits, luck and some adrenaline. Being also an irritating jerk (by function of what is said  by his entourage) he might even be considered more like anti-hero.
Die Hard With A Vengeance is a good movie but such a departure from the original first two movies that it didn't live up to the Die hard fanatics. Live free or Die Hard the 4th movie in the serie is also a great popcorn flick although still not comparable to the first two.",1264723200,,1300,4.504237288135593

This is a great buy on those merits alone, however, I dropped two of my stars for a very aggravating omission from the set. In hindsight, I did it to myself by not reading deeper into the product description.

I own the previous DVD collection which includes both a theatrical AND unrated version of Live Free of Die Hard. The unrated has been completely sapped from the BluRay treatment. As a lifelong fan of these movies I found that Live Free was actually a good time, and really in the same spirit as the others while in it's unrated form. This was the McLane we've known all along, not watered down to appeal to (and be accessible to) a younger (PG-13) crowd.

Why was my option to watch the REAL McLane in Live Free taken away for this set? Now it ensures that I have to retain an inferior DVD for my shelf instead of allowing these BluRays to condense my collection.

2945949,5,B000VM8YCI,"The die hard movies have been reviewed to death.  Obviously most considered the first one of the best action moves ever made, if not the best.  It's the sequels that cause debate and get the additional reviews.  The second flick is usually considered the least favorite, and with good reason.  The plots more silly than usual, the action is not the best, with long periods where nothing interesting occurs.  Oh yeah, and Bruce willis is only allowed to by funny about two and half times in the entire movie.  Thought its not the worst movie, its hardly up to die hard standards.

As to the third, while it is far more entertaining, with great action and dialogue, the one thing missing is the claustrophobic nature of the first.  While the second flick wasn't great, at least it felt like a sequel.  This one feels like its own movie, with John McClane thrown in.  Though this may not be a bad thing, depending on what you're hoping from a sequel.  Overall a pretty fun movie, that I've watched quite a few times over the years.

Then there's the hotly debated fourth movie.  Was it necessary?  Probably not, but frankly I think it's the better of the sequels.  The action is top notch, John is wise cracking, but the thing I like most about it is that they didn't provide a huge cheat in the use of technology.  John doesn't do technology.  He admits it, and can't get it right even when he needs to.  His character is older, and the world is starting to out grow him, though not his usefullness.  I was particularly fond of seeing the older john mcclane still beating bad guys and saving the day, but acknowledging he couldn't do everything.

As to the blu ray, it is certainly a great deal.  All four films and a ridiculous amount of special features.  While I admit the transfer of the first two flicks is nothing special, I did compare to my dvds unconverted, and noticed a difference, thought not that great.  The fourth however is my demo movie as it looks AMAZING.  There are also a ton of special features, though I note alot of those that were on the dvds for the first movie are missing, outtakes and such.

While I'm sure there will eventually be a re-release (there were three or four releases on dvd), I'm thrilled with what I have.  Tons of features, pretty picture, and some really great flicks.  If you have a blu ray player give it a shot.",1252886400,3,2357,4.471830985915493

2945957,5,B000VM8YCI,"Some movies are truly transformational, with an impact on not only film but often culture in general.  For example, Star Wars not only changed movies by adding emphasis to special effects, but also helped changed the studio philosophies to one of pursuing blockbusters and more generally, pushed science fiction more towards the mainstream.  Die Hard may not have had the same impact, but it definitely had an effect on the action movie.  After all, after Die Hard, there was Under Siege (Die Hard on a battleship), Under Siege 2 (Die Hard on a train), Passenger 57 (Die Hard on an airplane) and Speed 2 (Die Hard on a cruise ship).  As is typically the case, it's best to stick with the original movie and its sequels, all in the Die Hard Ultimate Collection.

The original Die Hard is, as would be expected, the best in the bunch.  The plot focuses on the siege of an office building by some supposed terrorists.  As is typical in the Die Hard movies, any political motives are mere cover for getting money, in this case, hundreds of millions of dollars in bearer bonds.  The bad guys are led by Alan Rickman in a role that is one of the top villain roles ever.  Bruce Willis, playing cop John McClane, is the man accidentally in the right place in the right time, leading to a cat-and-mouse game with the crooks.

With sequels, the stakes have to be raised, and in Die Hard 2:,Die Harder, the bad guys have taken over an entire airport on a stormy Christmas Eve.  With a number of planes at risk unable to land, the villains are able to hold hundreds hostage to force the accomplishment of  their goal of freeing a notorious (and wealthy) drug lord.  McClane stumbles upon their scheme and leads the effort to stop them.

Die Hard with a Vengeance has bombers threatening New York, with Jeremy Irons leading them.  He plays the brother of Hans Gruber, Rickman's character from the first movie, who leads McClane through a series of dangerous games to distract the NYPD from their actual goal involving the gold in the Federal Reserve.  Although still good, it is my least favorite of the four movies:  Irons may have an Oscar but his villainy pales compared to Rickman's, and Samuel Jackson plays his standard angry-guy role.  Released in 1995, this film does have a certain extra layer of irony after 9/11 with its bombings.

Live Free or Die Hard has Tim Olyphant as a computer genius who has hacked into major infrastructure systems and is throwing the country into chaos.  McClane isn't much with computers, but his old-school ways (that is, shoot-em-up) will prove to be quite the match.  Justin Long plays a hacker who is an inadvertent accomplice and then is targeted for assassination.

While none of these movies are the sort to win Oscars, they are all loud, turn-off-your-brain action-filled roller coaster rides,  Besides the movies, there are heaps of extras (each movie is a two disc set) including commentaries and ""making-of"" features.  If you're a fan of action movies, this Die Hard boxed set should be part of your DVD collection.",1235174400,,3052,4.715094339622642

So this review below is for the 2009 set, not the 2013 set. I do not own the 2013 set (25th Anniversary Collection).  Check when other reviews were written by other members to see if they posted recent reviews for the 2013 edition.

When I think Blu-ray, I expect high quality video and sound, otherwise there is no point to buying a blu-ray version of an already existing dvd.
The first two movies, Die Hard 1 & 2 from the 80's, look terrible visually.  FOX did a horrible job in re-mastering these for blu-ray, or they did not re-master them at all.  It is possible they used the regular dvd's and just up-converted them without remastering/restoring them digitally.  Sound is decent.  The third film, Die Hard with a Vengeance is more recent from the 90's, but it doesn't look great.  The fourth film does look good and sounds great, but it would be more convenient to just purchase the fourth film as a blu-ray version and get the first three on regular DVD if you don't own them already.  You would save a lot more money and you would be getting the same thing as this box set here.  FOX definitely messed up with this whole set.

UPDATE: If the price does drop under thirty and you don't own any of these movies, the set is worth purchasing.  If you already own the movies on DVD, the upgrade isn't worth the price. Wait for a new remastered version to be released in the future. Many shots are soft in Die Hard 1 and Die Hard 2. It's hard to believe that the films were shot this way with the focus so soft.

2945971,5,B000VM8YCI,"This is by far one of the best series of action movies you will ever see. Bruce Willis and the rest the casts of each movie made them believeable and the writing, directing, camera work, sound, and music were great. It is not surprising everyone knows at least one movie in this set and there is hardly a person on the planet not familiar with the name of a fictional cop John McClane and his famous quotes while being in the right place at the wrong time.

Synopsis:
In the first movie McClane, a New York City cop, goes to LA to visit his wife that has moved there with their kids because she was offered an exceptional position. While flying out another passenger tells John that the best way to relax after a long flight is to take off shoes and socks and curl your toes in the carpet. Unfortunately John must try to rescue everyone at the building when terrorist take over to steal bonds and he runs around barefoot the whole movie through broken glass.

During the second film McClane encounters terrorists at Dulles Airport in Washington DC trying to rescue a military prisoner by taking over the tower controls to the planes. This time he must fight them while barely clothed in frigid weather.

In the third movie McClane has drawn the attention of the brother of the head terrorist in the first movie that is also intent on bombing people as a cover up to a gold heist. He demands McClane do some Simple Simon tricks. McClane is brought in from his suspension with a bad hangover and headache and has to stand in Harlem in his underwear with a deragatory sign to blacks when he gets the assistance of a racist shop owner played by Samuel Jackson. Jackson helps him track down the terrorists and the two make a great comical pair.

In the fourth movie McClane finds out the terrorist control several government agencies and the utilities through the internet so they can rob them. While picking up a hacker, played by Justin Long, for the FBI they are both nearly killed and he enlists the aid of Long to track down the terrorists.

Although I had the individual movies I couldn't pass on this set after reading the review by ""The Game"". I wanted a set anyway and it looks like this is a great one for a super price. One other thing. I couldn't tell from the ad, but this is four thin DVD cases in a cardboard box so it takes less than half the shelf space of the four full size cases. This set includes an extra disc for each movie dedicated to extras. One of the best when it comes to all the background on the movies and then an exceptional price for all this material. The quality was just as indicated, very sharp and clear. I am very happy with this set. Excellent replayability. If you enjoyed this catch ""Lethal Weapon"" and ""Unbreakable"".

Before I picked up this collection I hadn't seen a Die Hard movie in a long time but I remembered loving the first and third, but hating the second.  This is pretty much still true, but the second one isn't as bad as I remembered.  There where some highlights (I laughed when I saw the most interesting man in the world), but the first and third are by far the best.  The fourth one is good, but it's missing the gritty style of the first three.  Picture quality is excellent on all of the films, and suprisingly good on the first one considering it's like 20 yrs old.  I don't have the best surround sound in the world, but the sound quality was great as well.  The packaging is nice and the I like the way the menus have a similar style for each movie.

2945977,3,B000VM8YCI,"First, let me start by saying I love the Die Hard movies. So when I saw this collection on BD, I just couldn't refuse!

You already know the movies, so let's get to the overall package.

Positives:
+ DTS MA on every movie that really reinvigorates the films
+ Good set of extras, not a single feature from the standard DVDs is left out, making you think these are the definitive versions to have
+ Special box saves you space on shelf and keeps discs safe. It's a little bigger than the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Planet-Earth-The-Complete-BBC-Series-Blu-ray/dp/B000MRAAJM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Planet Earth - The Complete BBC Series [Blu-ray</a>] boxset (without the slipcase).
+ Exactly the same discs as individual releases, so you're not getting gimped versions of the already released BD movies --they're the same.
+ Live Free or Die Hard is a total show-stopper, demo material, A+ reference disc. Both in terms of video and audio, this is one of the best movies to showcase what High Definition is all about (and the movie itself is a great ride, btw)

Negatives:
- In the first three movies, both subtitles and dubs in spanish are CASTILLIAN, not Latin American. Why on earth did FOX included castillian dubs/subs on an AMERICAN, region locked disc, goes beyond me. They should know by now that most latin people HATE the castillian dubbing, specially when these movies have such great voice acting. Granted, I always prefer to watch movies in their original languaje w/subs, but there's always the chance to borrow or watch the movie with people that prefer to hear it in their own language. Even the regionalized castilian subtitles are distracting. This is not a problem on the 4th movie. The voice acting and subs are the way they should be for an american release.
- The first 2 movies look downright awful, to the point it seems you put the SE DVD and upconverted it. Time is totally not an excuse: just look at the impressive video quality of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman-The-Movie-Blu-ray/dp/B0016MOWOQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Batman: The Movie [Blu-ray</a>]: a 40 yo movie that looks absolutely fantastic (more than it deserves, if I may be so bold). And that flick is probably just being released to make a quick buck on the batman fever, so FOX, you're telling me you couldn't give a AAA movie such as Die Hard a proper transfer? Come on...
- The 3rd movie looks way better, but still does not compare to the visual blast that is Live Free or Die Hard.
- The 4th movie is the theatrical, PG-13 version, not the UNRATED one. Again, what's going on here! Simply put, FOX could have put both version on the same disc via seamless branching. This has been a reality since the days of DVD, and there are a couple BD that have this feature already, so NO excuse.
- The special features on every disc are Standard Def. only to the point most of them look like VHS (this is no exaggeration). Not a single drop of remastering love (let alone HD treatment) has been poured on even the alternate endings.

Bottom line? This is looking like a future double dip. If you don't care for extras or hearing the movies in a language other than English, this will probably suit you fine, even without the unrated cut of Live Free or Die Hard.

However, this is far from being the Definitive version of the movies to have, to the point of getting me wondering if FOX actually knows the fact that this edition of the movie should be the one for all the american continent. Moreso, I'm left guessing if they care about what their public wants: both their High Definition users and their non-north american audience.",1214870400,878,3720,4.964686998394863
2945978,5,B000VM8YCI,"Having viewed both this set and the blu-ray collection, I can honestly say this is the set to buy.  The blu-ray collection is very nice and looks good but the older films (especially the first) just don't look any better in blu-ray.  It actually looks more grainy on the blu-ray than the traditional dvd.  However, the 4th film looks spectacular in blu-ray but that is the only one I would say is worth the extra cash.  This set costs about half of the blu-ray edition and includes more extra features than any Die Hard fan could want.  Each movie comes with a bonus disc chalk full of commentaries, documentaries, and behind the scenes footage.  I found the audio and video of these dvds to be mastered very well considering the 1st film is 20 years old.  The only issue i noticed was slight edge enhancement on certain scenes in the first 3 movies, but hardly distracting.  So do yourself a favor, save the cash and buy a set that is just about as good.

In theaters, Die Hard 4 had the displeasure of a PG-13 rating, and really gutted most of what made Die Hard what it is.

Now, I understand that most of you think swears or not the movie was fine, but I truly disagree. Iconic moments from all three films (including the incredibly famous Yippie Kai Yay, *@#$%@) had swears in them.  From all the films.  To not include the unrated edition in this collectors edition set was a slap to my face.  Especially because I didn't realize it till I put the Bluray in!

Now, that being said, this ""unrated version"" is still completely unavailable on bluray!  You won't find it yet!  So if you are looking for the gritty laughter and iconic style of the other films, and you want a high definition experience, you'll have to wait.

2945986,4,B000VM8YCI,"Here's some cool trivia:

The original 1988 Die Hard is based on a 1979 novel by Roderick Thorp titled&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nothing-Lasts-Forever/dp/0345287819/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nothing Lasts Forever</a>, which was a sequel to Thorp's book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Detective/dp/0385294697/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Detective</a>&nbsp;that was made into the movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Detective/dp/B0007PALXE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Detective</a>&nbsp;starring Frank Sinatra in 1968.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Predator/dp/B000244EMO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Predator</a>&nbsp;Director John McTiernan directed Die Hard.

In Die Hard, Hans Gruber is played by Alan Rickman, now more famous for his role as Servious Snape in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harry-Potter/dp/B000W4B8NC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harry Potter</a>&nbsp;series. Rickman and Jeremy Irons, in my opinion, could easily be confused with each other...especially when they're heavily costumed.

Die Hard 2 was based on the book titled 58 Minutes&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/58-Minutes/dp/0812510038/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">58 Minutes</a>&nbsp;by Walter Wager. The plane crash at the beginning of the movie is considered one of the most horrific ever filmed (according to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Maxim/dp/B000T8XYOW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Maxim</a>.

Die Hard 3 has John McTiernan back in the director's seat, and DH3 is the only one of the four to have been written by a screenwriter. It stars Alan-Rickman-act-alike Jeremy Irons as 'the bad guy'.

Die Hard 4 is based on a 1997 Wired article by John Carlin (see it here wired.com/wired/archive/5.05/netizen.html). DH4 is directed by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Underworld/dp/B000TGJ80I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Underworld</a>&nbsp;series master Len Wiseman and stars that dude (Justin Long) who's more popular from his stint in the recent Apple Computer commercials than his past acting roles.

This Blu Ray compilation of all four films is a great package. Chances are that you're here (like I was) because you've already seen the first three, and you're wondering if it's worth it to buy the entire collection in order to get the 4th? I'll say this: the fourth (Live Free or Die Hard) stands out as one of the best, if not the best, of the series. So if you've always wanted the Die Hard series in your collection, this great compilation is for you.

Like the previous 3 movies, in Live Free or Die Hard John McClane (Bruce Willis) is seemingly indestructible, surviving death defying feat after death defying feat. Willis' banter with costar Long is witty and funnier than anything from the first three movies combined. The action is non-stop, and the supporting cast is fabulous (especially&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Deadwood-s/dp/B000O5B4BU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Deadwood's</a>&nbsp;Timothy Olyphant).

But ask any 20 something now about what an amazing guy series this movie is!  its ""the standard"" in guy action movies!

i recall in the U.S there used to be ad campaign on TNT: ""Movies for guys who love movies""  DH was always in the lineup!

Enough reminiscing about DH, for the fact all 4 were released on Bluray was a big step forward! i was hoping to get it when that actually happens. Lets thank sony for not messing up the encoding on these discs like F4 2 (u guys know what i am talking about!)  I bring this up because there is a ton of fun stuff on the discs that takes a while to load and experience.

Back to the movie...i think these 2 guys in Hollywood struck a very nice balance of bringing an old analog hero in a digital world.  They kept the amazing depth of the characters around and did not mess it up like most franchise movies when they make a #4 of its kind!  i think #4 is the best DH yet. The stunts and the action sequence is BIG guys! i mean BIG!  and of course the BD performance in picture and sound added to the realism of what was happening here. This was key always in DH: realism!  there were some crazy moments but allot of fun.

I gave it 4 stars because the 1st DH was similar to T1 in terms of quality. I don't know how much remastering one can do on the older print of DH1 and DH2. But the sound was definitely remastered.

3179657,3,B000VM8YCI,"I grew up with the Die Hard movies. I really liked the 1st movie and am in the minority becuase I also enjoyed the second. The 3rd and 4th movie I liked, though not as much, because they didn't feel like Die Hard movies as much as the first two did. 1&2 consentrated mostly on John McClain. With the 3rd you had Samuel Jackson. He was a big focus during the movie, but was similar enough to Bruce Willis' character that it didn't distract too much from the movie.

With the 4th movie, it didn't feel like Die Hard so much. At times, it almost felt like a sequel to 16 blocks, that had been watered down to a PG13. Don't get me wrong though, I did enjoy the movie, but it definitely isn't the Die Hard I grew up with.

The audio was very good on all films, but I was disappointed by the earlier films video quality. After recently seeing what Warner Bros. were able to do for Blade Runner, the first two movies are pretty disappointing. BR is 25 years old and they were able to make it look like it was made almost yesterday (except for obviously dated tech). I wish they would have taken a little more time and cleaned up the films better.

While this is a good deal for all 4 movies, you might want to wait for an unrated version before purchasing these. I'm hoping the reason there wasn't an unrated blu-ray version is that they're going back to do some re-edits to make it better than the unrated version released on DVD.",1192579200,91,1424,4.247232472324724

So I was super excited to get these movies on Blue Ray as they are my favorite series of all time. My wife had never seen them with me, mostly through stubbornness, so I was super excited to make her watch them as well. About half way through the first movie...nothing, the disk just stops. It was the worst timing and completely ruined my moment sharing it with her. But you may ask why I rated it a 5 instead of something lower because of this, and I will tell you.

I enjoyed Die Hard as John McClane takes on an office building full of terrorists holding hostages, one of whom is his wife Holly. The second film rivaled the first and seriously made me wonder about traveling by plane. By the time the fourth movie came around, so many years had passed, I went to see it with some doubt.  Boy was I wrong.  Big John still has it and the fourth movie was as good as the rest, if not better. By then, wife Holly was no longer the endangered heroine and that title had passed to John's daughter.

3179858,5,B000VM8YCI,"Based on the 1979 crime fiction novel, ""Nothing Lasts Forever"" by author Roderick Thorpe, the ""Die Hard"" franchise starring Bruce Willis is an exciting and fun action adventure series filled with shootings and explosions galore.

I first saw the first ""Die Hard"" when I was a young boy, & loved it ever since.

Where the film depictions differ from the novel is first the movie was produced as an ""action tough guy shoot em up"" epic, where Bruce Willis follows in Arnold and Chuck Norris's footsteps of either punching or shooting any man who crosses him.

 Second, the novel is a deeper and somewhat darker look at the nature of man, and how man reacts to the violence of being forced to fire a gun at another human being.  John McClaine, the fantasy NYPD tough cop actually throws up and is disturbed about being forced to kill the Terrorist bad guys in the high rise, while in the movie McClaine's character cracks wise guy jokes while gunning each villain down, and he does so with ease as if his targets were video game aliens.  The novel is more mental, and has deeper insight where the film version is simply a shooting gallery.

  The villains and their motivations are slightly different in the book version, so a true fan may want to check that book out and compare the two.  I loved the ""Hans Grueber"" villain portrayed brilliantly by English actor Alan Rickman.  These two are big mental equals among a group of dopes, dueling it out first mentally via the radio as Willis hunts down each of Rickman's deadly henchmen one at a time.  They both find ways to piss each other off, while Grueber anti's up the game throwing Willis into more traps injuring him every time more and more in the process.

 Willis finds himself not only up against these ruthless Terrorist killers, but also against an imbecile and bureaucratic FBI moron who doesn't respect what Willis's character John McClaine has done, nor knows about the villains.

 Very good first movie, followed by an okay winter time shoot em up against domestic Army Terrorists 1990 sequel, then followed with the third installment where Willis is teamed up with Samuel L. Jackson on the crazy streets of New York fighting against a deadly random Terrorist bomber.

 I found this series, despite being impossible and absolutely fictional where in no way one guy could survive all of what is thrown at him, to be very fun and also very politically & militarily contemporary were our modern country is faced with the real deadly menace of Terrorism and attackers like the villains from ""Die Hard"".  Awesome movie, two thumbs up and A-",1425686400,,2596,4.716186252771618

3179866,4,B000VM8YCI,"BRUCE WILLIS  DIE HARD  1988

Do not expect a film that is going to revolutionize your ideology, your spirituality, your religion, or even your political beliefs. It is an action film that is supposed to entertain you and nothing else, and yet

It starts with some nice Christmas party in some high rise office block in some international super capitalistic business if not corporation. The poor John McLane is coming to Los Angeles from New York to visit his children and wife he has been estranged from for some months with three thousand miles between their two places of residence.

The whole tower block is taken over by some German terrorists just after John McLane has arrived and the whole film will be his action in order to get rid of the terrorists, to save the hostages and to save his own wife.

The film shows how rotten some apples in the basket can be. Even one is able to sell his own colleagues to get a coke in a glass, hardly more. In fact he won't even be able to drink it because once he has given some leverage to the terrorists they just thank him for the rest of his eternal life.

But whats best in this film is the action and the visual effects. No digitalized special effects and it looks real, rough, hard. The very good final product is reached thanks to the editing of the film. It makes it so fast that it becomes breath-taking and at times it is hilarious because some of the situations look so hectic, so extreme, and yet they are nothing but an illusion and it is enjoyable.

It is also enjoyable to see LAPD officers, inspectors or whatever they may call them down there being smashed up, the FBI being fooled and ridiculed, the media being unworthy of any trust, and only two little black men coming on top, a plain motorized street cop who manages to raise the alarm and a little black limousine chauffeur who manages to block the escape of the last terrorists. That makes you feel happy and warm in the heart. The little ones are the heroes of the film.

BRUCE WILLIS  DIE HARD 2  1990

Christmas eve again with John McClane, this time on Dulles airport in Washington DC. This time John McClane is waiting for the arrival of his wife on a plane. But of course everything went wrong, which was to be expected.

The airport was taken over by a band of terrorists who tried to recuperate and liberate a general who had been convicted of some anti-communist crime or something. That is not entirely clear and that does not matter. Of course these terrorists could not succeed in their plan if they did not have come accomplices in the airport and in the armed forces brought in to deal with the situation.

But John McClane is the savior of the day, which is normal on Christmas eve. John once again managed to stop the apocalypse he could not really prevent since he was surprised in it himself, but he also managed to get rid of the beast, the dragon and Babylon at the same time: the liberated general, the chief of the terrorists and the military traitor.

Apart from that the rhythm is quite diabolical, though they kept the panic for the very end. People in that airport were so patient, so enduring, so smiling silent when something was obviously wrong. Thanks to a journalist the bad news was finally aired and the panic could come. We are not told how many casualties.

Pure entertainment based on a very fast rhythm and some kind of humor that is always targeting some kind of officials or uniformed commissioned puppets and generally below the waist if not below the knees, low, low, low anyway. I personally missed one thing: the old church that was to be blown up with tons of plastic of something like that. It did not blow up. Too bad.

BRUCE WILLIS  DIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE  1995

We finally move to New York and out of the Yule season. It is still dealing with the Germans we have been dealing with before, that kind of German army trying to conquer the world, or at least some kind of back base for their criminal activities.

It starts like a game and then becomes very bitter and it becomes a real war time operation targeting Fort Knox and their reserves of gold, hundreds of billions of dollars in gold bullions. To get down there without attracting too much attention is a little bit difficult so you have to have one massive explosion that opens the street down to the underground vault.

The rest after that is nothing. John McLane gets some black innocent and neutral partner at the beginning of the game and they will become a good pair of gamesters in full addiction till the real end and finish of the hunt, chase and tracking search. It sure is more suspenseful than the Football Super Bowl. It is also quite spectacular about the damage caused to the urban environment. Crossing Central Park with a car in something like ten minutes at a peak hour late in the morning is quite spectacular.

Of course we know the gangsters will be defeated, the main leader who is the brother of a previous gang leader who was defeated and killed by John McLane, will die defeated and beaten into pureed smithereens. The whole interest of this film is to see how and here there is some inventiveness more than creativity on the side of the plot-writers and scenario-writers.

In this film some digital visual effects (hello Buena Vista) are used and that make the film slightly less rough because digital special effects are smoother, more easy-going, more fluid than standard old fashioned analog special effects. But we are used to that nowadays though it makes the film less impressive.

Just for entertainment of course. This film will not give you some intellectual overload, though with too many of these you might get into some apnea, the suspension of your breathing that could be lethal, due to the lack of cerebral activity.

Enjoy the spiritual and mental relaxation.

BRUCE WILLIS  LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD  2007

We finally had to come to the modern world and computers. This film is so frightening for simple people that it should create a real panic among them. It deals with all the central networks created by our modern society to control govern and command absolutely everything that can be set in some kind of network. The big fear is that when all networks are synchronized and connected one person from one keyboard and central computer will be able to control absolutely everything in life and society. Everyone knows about it. Check Terminator for that.

In Paris they even have some higher education professor, Marcel Gauchet, who explains that in such a society we just need to blow up or paralyze the nodal points of these systems to bring a society to a stand still and thus impose a revolution. No one has been able to find out if that man is using this idea as a menace against society or as a warning to society. Some of his students were even investigated some years ago as having played a role in such an attack on the fast train network in France

But this fear is also lined with another which is a lot older: the fear of machines per se. People are afraid of machines though they use machines everyday, like cars and other means of transportation. Computers are even more frightening than a crashing airplane because all we see on the screen is a whole lot of figures, in fact digits, and we cannot understand what the machine is saying, and it is always saying a lot. We have always been afraid of foreign languages, and computers speak a foreign language.

The third level of fear you can find in our world is the fact that after 9/11 we have put all our valuable data on central computers that are supposed to be hyper protected and they are. The film demonstrates that they cannot be reached from the outside by hackers but can only be reached from the inside that is to say from these giant central computers themselves because they are absolutely isolated from the outside world and their connection with this outside world is absolutely under digitalized secure surveillance. So the hackers who want to prove the vulnerability of that central computer has to penetrate the fort in which it is located. Only a military operation can do that, but that operation is just plainly unimaginable. The human guards can be killed but they can be so connected to the central security that the alert is given as soon as some sensor senses the attack on the body or mind of the guard and then instead of sending two guards as reinforcement a security wall can fall down that can only be opened from the inside.

The system that is shown here, for our entertainment for sure, is super fragile and super UN-protected. It is less protected than a henhouse against foxes. It is as little protected against the infiltration of terrorists as a sieve is ready to retain water. So that makes the fear ludicrous and the entertainment loses all suspense value and all frightening effect.

Of course John McClane has to have a partner and this time it is a young hacker that the terrorists want to kill and that the FBI wants to interrogate. He becomes the digital mind of McClane and McClane is nothing but the brute force, the basic muscle of the operation. The two together are funny in a way since they are so different and one could be the father of the other.

But the film is funny though the digital special effects are so visibly artificial, not even analogue, that they become cinematographic anecdotes. I think these action films have lost something g with the massive shift to digital special effects. They just look unreal and whats more we recognize the special effect maker and then we recognize a special effect we have already seen in some other films. We may even wonder if they are after all not plainly the same.

BRUCE WILLIS  A GOOD DAY TO DIE HARD  2013

After the daughter endangered in the previous and fourth installment of Die Hard, now in the fifth installment we get the son, John McLane Jr., who is the partner of his own father as a CIA agent in Moscow. We had to fall, sooner or later, in the anti-Russian cold war atmosphere. I am afraid though Bourne and Taken do that type of action film a little bit better. Here it is too gross, too thick, too much deconstruction and not enough subtlety.

The two McLanes find themselves on the same mission but from two different agencies, one CIA and the other NYPD, or is it FBI? They have to recuperate a political prisoner who is going to be tried in Moscow for some unclear reason. We all know Russia is a dictatorship. That type of clich is slightly too schematic to be believable. But it is a lot worse than that. The two American agencies were completely fooled if not bamboozled. The political prisoner is a personal friend of the president of Russia, follow my eyes and read my lips. But he is using both the Americans and the Russian security services to have the president assassinated and to take over.

His daughter is the main in-between triple agent and she succeeds perfectly well. The two McLanes are just following the trend and get completely ridiculed and nearly killed. But they manage to get to the secret abandoned nuclear facility, probably Chernobyl which is not in Russia but in Ukraine, but who cares about the place and name. From Moscow to that place anyway it takes about thirty seconds on the screen, in real time about a couple of hours. Distances are not exactly correct.

There they find the dear father who is pretending to be very sick though he has killed with his daughter quite a few of the Russian secret agents. The supposed report hidden in this place does not exist and then the mission is reduced to killing the triple agents, destroying a helicopter, etc. They do this is in a jiffy and they survive all the mayhem with hardly a scratch. They get out of Russia with no problem whatsoever and they arrive in some American airport where the daughter McLane is waiting for them. We just wonder why they bothered to get involved in what was a purely Russian domestic political game. I guess American security agencies are no longer what they used to be.

Lets hope there will not be a sequel to that. We have reached the third underground level under well devised action films. Lets say they were part of the anti-Russian campaign for the Olympic Games. Viva la new era Cold War! I am sure Ron L. Hubbard must be turning in his tomb in total clarity.

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: Here you get Five awesome Blu-ray discs and they include in this Deluxe Limited Edition Collection DigiBook the following Blu-ray discs and they include: Die Hard; Die Hard 2: Die Harder; Die Hard With A Vengeance; Live Free or Die Hard [Die Hard 4.0] and Decoding Die Hard.

Over the last twenty years, John McClane [Bruce Willis] has become such an iconic part of the action-film landscape that it's hard to remember a time when he wasn't etched in our pop culture consciousness. Starting with 'Die Hard,' and continuing through three sequels, the character has proven to be one of the most durable in a very fickle genre. Aside from James Bond and Indiana Jones, there may be no other action movie hero who has lasted as long or remained as beloved by audiences. John McClane redefined the boundaries of the action archetype; bringing warmth, humour, unpredictability, and an almost fanciful sense of masculine daring do to the genre.

'Die Hard' [1988] Was of course, the first film that started it all, and it broke all preconceptions for what an action hero could be. Bruce Willis' John McClane is a NYC cop who has (reluctantly) flown to Los Angeles to reconcile with his upwardly-mobile wife Holly Gennaro-McClane [Bonnie Bedelia], but he ends up trapped in a skyscraper with a bunch of mercenary thugs led by the snivelling Hans Gruber [Alan Rickman]. The simple premise, great action, airtight execution, and unlike the muscled action heroes of other films, John McClane is not a superman, but rather just an ordinary guy stuck in an extraordinary situation. His cocky facade masks a palpable vulnerability, but that only makes him even more courageous. By the time he gets around to kicking Hans Gruber's ass at the film's end, he's already rewritten every clich in the action film playbook.

Just wrapping up his run in TV's 'Moonlighting,' Bruce Willis was at his hungriest in 'Die Hard,' and he almost single-handedly carries the entire movie on his well-oiled shoulders. John McClane's got more quips than James Bond and Freddy Krueger put together, but somehow Willis makes the character endearing rather than smarmy. Alan Rickman is also the best villain of the entire 'Die Hard' series, coming off as the kind of uber-nasty psycho who would stab you with a knife, lick off the blood, and then stab you again. And the seemingly incongruous pairing of Bruce Willis and Bonnie Bedelia manages to generate real sparks, making us actually believe that this guy would risk everything to save his wife, instead of just another tired plot device. Add to that John McTiernan's economical direction and a breathless set of stunt sequences that still hold up, and 'Die Hard' stands head-to-head with the absolute best action flicks of the 1980s.

Die Hard 2: Die Harder [1990] Hit screens only two years later in 1990 and was essentially a remake of the first film, only this time set at an airport with a whole group of psycho terrorist baddies who like to crash planes for fun and profit. After they take control of the airport and demand millions, John McClane must outwit their superior technology while again dealing with a bumbling police bureaucracy. Meanwhile, John McClane's wife (a returning Bonnie Bedelia), is stuck high above in one of the circling planes.

Aided by a bigger budget and the energetic direction of Renny Harlin ['Cliffhanger' and 'The Covenant'], 'Die Hard 2' pumps up the formula that worked so well in the first film, and it's almost as much fun, although the seams of the formula show through at times. There's an element of freshness missing (Bruce Willis' wink-wink quips have already grown slightly stale), and the villains are nowhere near as memorable as the scenery-chewing Alan Rickman. And why has the spunky Bonnie Bedelia been banished to a cheap seat in coach for the entire film? Still, there's enough of the old John McClane magic left in Die Hard 2: Die Harder to make it worth a return visit.

Next we have 'Die Hard with a Vengeance' [1995]. This time, a crazed mad bomber named Simon Gruber [Jeremy Irons] has an axe to grind against John McClane, and is planting explosives all over New York City. With the help of a local shop owner Zeus Carver [Samuel L. Jackson], John McClane must complete a series of tasks laid out by Simon Gruber, or innocent civilians will die. Eventually, the madman's true motivations will be revealed, but they aren't as exciting as the build-up would leave you to believe.

'Die Hard with a Vengeance' sees the return of director John McTiernan to the franchise, and also opens up the milieu considerably, with John McClane hitting so many scenic stops in the Big Apple that he might as well be a tour guide. Unfortunately, what worked so well in the first 'Die Hard' was its sense of confinement and claustrophobia, and 'Vengeance' just isn't as fun or suspenseful. The script is also ham-fisted in its attempt to weave in social commentary (the Jackson character seems to face bigotry at every turn, all in wholly contrived ways). And with Bonnie Bedelia bowing out of this third outing, there is little personal drama for John McClane, so we barely feel invested in the eventual outcome of all the carnage. 'Die Hard with a Vengeance' is certainly my least favourite of the series.

Fast-forward over a decade and we have 'Live Free or Die Hard' [Die Hard 4.0] [2007]. Surprisingly, things get back on track with this long-in-development fourth entry, which turned out to be one of the biggest hits of year. John McClane is still as ornery and resourceful as ever, albeit a bit more grizzled. This time, he's up against the crazed Thomas Gabriel [Timothy Olyphant], who's out to ""redeem"" America with an all-out attack on its technological infrastructure. With the FBI unable to catch the criminal mastermind, it's up to John McClane and a geeky hacker [Justin Long] to foil the villain's plot, as well as save John McClane's daughter Lucy [Mary Elizabeth Winstead].

Directed by Len Wiseman ['Underworld'], 'Live Free or Die Hard' works as a surprisingly resonant retelling of the ""aging old relic story,"" where the fighter must jump back into the ring for one last fight to ensure his legacy. But it also doesn't forget what made the first film such a gas, giving us wall-to-wall old-school action that needs little assistance from overdone CGI or slapdash music video editing. 'Live Free or Die Hard' is both modern and retro, giving us all the stunts, explosions, humour and ridiculous violence we loved the first time around, but also throwing in enough new emotional wrinkles for the John McClane character that it doesn't all feel stale. It's the perfect sequel that plays just as well to newbies as it does long-time fans of the series.

As a franchise, the Die Hard series stands tall. In the character of John McClane, Bruce Willis found his best-ever role, and with a combination of brawn, brains and snarky wit, created a whole new icon of the action movie. Add to that some of the most top-notch stunt sequences and effects the genre has ever seen, and you have a series of four films that truly do rival such legendary franchises as James Bond, The Terminator and Mad Max. I can't claim that the 'Die Hard' series hasn't had its ups and downs, but even in its weakest moments, the Die Hard series has never been less than a total blast.

Blu-ray Video Quality  20th Century Fox Home Entertainment brings 'Die Hard: 25th Anniversary Collection' to Blu-ray in a handsome and sturdy five-disc box set. The package is shaped and opens much like a book with new artwork corresponding to each movie. Those same pages also serve as sleeves for each disc which slide out by placing some slight pressure to the top and bottom, widening the mouth a little. The inside is smooth and glossy to prevent the discs from scratching. All four films come on separate discs while the fifth disc contains a brand-new retrospective. The book comes with a side-sliding slipcover made of a hard cardboard material with a picture of Bruce Willis on the front and very lightly textured. At start up, each disc goes straight to an animated menu screen with colourful graphics and music playing in the background.

'Die Hard' as with all the films in this 25th Anniversary collection, the first film in the franchise arrives with the identical encode [2.35:1] as the previous 2007 release. And frankly, the source used for this high-definition transfer is in excellent condition, giving fans the best possible presentation imaginable of an awesome 1980s action classic. Fine lines and textures are sometimes highly detailed and very well-defined with several shockingly revealing close-ups, exposing pores, wrinkles and trivial blemishes on the faces of ever actor. Beads of sweat shimmer in the light while dirt and grime is made plainly visible covering John McClane's entire body. Contrast is terrifically well-balanced and crisp while black levels are true and penetrating. Colours are bold and energetic, and a very thin layer of grain provides the video with an appreciable cinematic quality.

Die Hard 2: Die Harder sadly, this sequel is the slightly weakest of the bunch with an average, only mildly impressive encoded transfer. The presentation has its moments, for sure, particularly at the beginning when there is plenty of daylight, but as we move into night-time, the quality diminishes quite a bit. Granted, this is due to the original photography and not faults in the encoded image, but nonetheless, it's not as pretty as the other films. Although showing a welcomed film-like quality, grain tends to fluctuate from scene to scene while black levels range from accurate and true to a tad murky and flat. Definition is strong for a good chunk of the time but overall unimpressive with several soft scenes. On the other hand, contrast is well-balanced and stable, and colours are mostly bold and animated with good skin tones and textures in facial complexions.

'Live Free or Die Hard' [Die Hard 4.0] [2007] Being the most recent of the series, the fourth instalment offers the best and often stunning high-definition presentation of the bunch. With a squeaky-clean, crystal-clear encode image leading the way, the video shows sharp, well-defined lines in the foliage of trees, along the side of buildings and down to individual threads of costumes. Every shard, fragment and debris from car crashes and explosions is plainly visible as they fly everywhere, and Bruce Willis is really starting to show his age by this point, as every wrinkle and blemish is exposed. Contrast is spot-on with crisp, brilliant whites, allowing for excellent visibility into the far distance. Black levels are inky rich with superb gradational details within the deepest, darkest shadows, providing the 2.35:1 image with plenty of depth. Colours are vibrant and accurately rendered with primaries looking particularly energetic.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  As with the Video Quality, here is the Audio Quality of each Blu-ray disc is as follows:

'Die Hard' [1988] With our rugged, blue-collar hero also arrives with the same DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack as before, and it's a fantastic listen. Considering its age and the period of when it was made, the original design is not the sort to go toe-to-toe with your more modern action spectacular, but it sure puts up a hell of a fight for a 25-year-old film. Mostly contained in the fronts, the soundstage is wide and welcoming. Especially with the fun and pretty-clever music of Michael Kamen, imaging feels expansive, with excellent fidelity and full of warmth while very lightly bleeding into the surrounds. Dynamic range is clean and precise with outstanding distinct detailing in the instrumentation, and dialogue reproduction remains well-prioritised throughout. Best of all is a robust and impactful low-end with tons of highly-responsive and punchy bass. Each bullet and punch comes with serious weight and force while explosions and helicopter blades penetrate deep into the room with awesome wall-rattling effect.

Die Hard 2: Die Harder [1990] Compared to the others in the series, this DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack is not quite up to the task, which is not to say it is bad. It's just not as noteworthy and is comparatively the scrawniest of the bunch. Although very subtle and somewhat restrained, rear activity is still plentiful, with several great atmospherics inside the airport. Sudden bursts of action and gunfire continue supplying the surrounds with many discrete effects, but imaging is mostly a front-heavy presentation. Dialogue and character interactions are generally loud and clear in the centre, but once in a while, voices tend to get lost in the commotion, slightly overwhelmed by the explosions and barrage of bullets. Nevertheless, dynamic range remains clean and precise, with excellent distinction and separation in the upper frequencies. Low bass is not very commanding or potent, but it's effective and adds some gravity to action sequences.

'Die Hard with a Vengeance' [1995] Arrives with an enjoyable and highly amusing 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack which packs the action with a great deal of fun and excitement. Rear activity is very subtle but at a near constant with discrete effects of city noise and traffic, generating a pleasant and satisfying sound field. Panning and movement during action sequences are flawless with bullets and debris whizzing by in all directions or with the sounds of sirens echoing through the busy streets. In the fronts, dialogue is well-prioritized and intelligible from beginning to end, and channel separation is terrifically well-balanced with several convincing off-screen effects which create a wide and spacious soundstage. The mid-range is clean and precise with excellent clarity in the upper frequencies. Sadly, low bass is not as powerful and commanding as I would have liked, making a couple explosive moments feeling somewhat wanting, but overall, the lossless mix offers plenty of entertaining impact.

'Live Free or Die Hard' [Die Hard 4.0] [2007] This 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack may be identical to the previous release but it remains and continues to be one of the best available on Blu-ray. All manner of noise, chaos and mayhem spreads into every corner of the room and with flawless panning, creating a highly satisfying 360 degrees sound field. The smallest debris and piece of rubble falls all around the listener with excellent discrete clarity while bullets and helicopters fly overhead. The action continues to excite with a broad and expansive soundstage that creates a massive wall of sound while delivering precise, well-prioritized dialogue in the centre. The mid-range is extensive with room-penetrating clarity that's dynamic and sharply detailed, allowing for the tiniest shard of metal or falling glass to be perfectly heard. The best attribute of this lossless mix is without question the authoritative low-end, which effectively reaches ultra-low frequencies with commanding force. Explosions and bullets not only rattle the wattles, but they're felt hard in the chest and vibrate the couch with each shot.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras: 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment recycles the same set of supplements as the previous Blu-ray release but not from the inferior NTSC DVD Five-Star Edition, making the majority of this release a simple repackaging.

3180053,4,B000VM8YCI,"While I've no doubt that we'll eventually see a Die Hard box set that includes the current 5th film in the series (which is just absolutely dreadful) alongside the inevitable sixth one, this box set containing the first 4 films is a winner considering the $20 price point that Amazon currently has it on (this writing is dated 12/9/13). The first in the series is a downright classic and has a super high replay value. Enough has been said about that film so it's redundant for me to go into how amazingly awesome it is. It's nearly a perfect action film. In my personal opinion I feel that the 2nd film is a cheap and subpar ripoff of the first film. It basically takes the premise of the first one and transports it to an airport. I know this film has its fans but I do not, and will never, consider myself one of them. The third one is the one I grew up watching the most out of the 3 (it was always on HBO and I actually saw this one before I had ever seen part 1). It's a completely different animal compared to the first two and works more like a thriller than a straight up action movie (though part 3 does have some pretty awesome action set pieces). Part 3 is an incredibly well-paced and exciting film. As for the fourth, the more I watch it the more I like it. This is the slickest looking out of all the 4 films. And while this is the movie that transformed John McClane into a superhero rather than keeping him a Regular Joe, it's still a fun flick to watch. The extras in this set are kinda skimpy considering there's nothing really new that's being offered here for fans. Most of the extras have seen the light of day before in previous DVD and Blu ray releases save for a few new featurettes. But for $20 you cannot go wrong considering that I'd pay that amount just for the first and 3rd films alone.",1386547200,,1817,4.239193083573487

Tried on 3 different players and same problem on all.  Sadly, I didn't go to watch one of them soon enough and can not return them ( missed by 6 days ) Don't waste your time or money on this set and save yourself a trip to UPS return this.

It includes a bonus disc entitled, ""Decoding Die Hard"" with almost two hours of exclusive material. There is over 6 hours of total bonus content in this collection but there are a few problems that prevent this set from being deluxe. Die Hard and Die Harder have fairly average picture quality. Live Free is the PG-13 theatrical cut not the unrated version. The special features are in SD (they haven't been remastered). The fifth film, A Good Day to Die Hard, is not included.

3180100,5,B000VM8YCI,A beautiful set stylized kind of like a book with each page containing the blu-ray disc (in which is easy to retrieve unlike other set that forces me to damage the disc to get them out). Each movie could have been restored a little better since it's blu-ray and wished the Live Free or Die Hard included here was the unrated cut but overall a great collection that doesn't include the latest awful Good Day to Die Hard which does not even feel like a Die Hard movie so this is the best damn good-looking Die Hard collection you can expect to buy. Each page has a good looking bad-ass art of each movie and as a bonus they give a Decoding Die Hard disc for the fans. Live free or buy hard...it's not even that expensive so it's very worth it.,1375488000,,741,4.225352112676056

I was pondering waiting to buy the inevitable ""complete collection"" after ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" was released, but since that film was probably the most disappointing movie of the last decade (and certainly the worst action movie of 2013), I'm sure happy I fortuitously spent the 30-ish bucks on this earlier in the year!",1373932800,2,378,4.742424242424242

I have 2 blu-ray players and Disc 1 would not work on either.  I tired the other 4 discs and they all worked.  Only disc 1 was defective.  I also tested my players for firmware updates but none were needed.  I exchanged the set at target but when I returned home I had the same problem again!!  Disc 1 wouldn't load.  All the other discs were fine once again.  I drove back to Target and exchanged it again.  My 3rd set was finally not defective.  All 5 discs are working.  Pretty sad manufacturing and quality control.  If you buy this set make sure you test all the discs right away after purchasing.  Some other comments I have seen have complained about disc 4 being defective.,1373760000,4,859,4.348101265822785

3180120,5,B000VM8YCI,"In 1988 John McClane bust on the screen in the action movie ""Die Hard"".  Working with a budget of $28 million the film grossed $83 million domestically and $140.7 million worldwide.
Die Hard established a lasting image that time has not faded.  Over the years, three sequels followed each one doing well but never hitting the mark like the original.
A fifth film, not included in this set, is in stores now.  While this is no guarantee that a person will like the films, it says a large number of people have liked them.

Bruce Willis is a very tuff loner with a smart mouth who manages to stumble upon a well-organized criminal group at work.
Over the next two hours, more or less, he manages to upset their plans and stop the crime.  This involves a great deal of gunfire, fights and great stunts.
All of this is set to snappy dialog as McClane triumphs over great odds.  Unless you have spent the last 25-years off world, you already know the story lines.

This is a very handsome set.  The five discs, four movies and special features, are housed in a book like album in a slipcase.
Each disc is one page of the book.  As you turn the pages, each two-page set is fully illustrated with pictures from the movie and John McClane as he looks in the move.
Decoding Die Hard is a series of features on the stories, villains, sidekicks and place in film history.  These are new features, the actors have aged, that benefit from hindsight.

Copy quality and sound are excellent.  The picture is very clear and crisp with excellent color.
The background music is not allowed to step all over the dialog.

This might be the nicest of the Die Hard collections.  They will have to do something really spectacular to make a better one.",1372896000,2,1727,4.493589743589744

The Design is real cool, good pics, great graphic design... but the movies editions... well... are kind of... lame.
Practicly no extras in the movie disks, no directors cuts, and the bonus disk is not a big deal, a couple of pointless documentaries, trailers and no so much...
if you are desesperate to own the saga buy it, 4 movies for a good price, if you can wait then do it until they edit the next boxset with a good day to die hard and directors cuts",1372377600,,622,4.3247863247863245

3180139,4,B000VM8YCI,"First of all. these are great movies transferred onto Blu-ray with excellent sound. Watching these movies again now in HD with THX sound makes for great viewing.

Since I already like these movies (as probably most people here) I won't go into the content of the movies. Besides, there are plenty of true movie reviews available on actual movie review sites. I will rate the product (movies as well as format and quality) I received.

This ""boxed"" set is exactly that...a cardboard boxed set with a pull-out DVD holder. It is firm quality (strong) cardboard with smooth coated inserts for the DVDs. The movies are a pretty good transfer considering the age of the originals. The sound quality really enhances the enjoyment of these movies.

Overall, I am very happy having these movies on Blu-ray in my collection. I don't think you will be disappointed either especially if you already like Die Hard.

Although I love these movies, I rate the entire product only 4 stars because it's not perfect and does not have as much ""extra"" information as I had hoped. Also, oddly,  these DVDs do not resume play where I left off if I turn my DVD player off and then back on again while the disc is in the tray.",1371600000,3,1201,4.619718309859155

The good guy always win with him overcoming tremendous odds. If you like so called 'MAN MOVIES ' then this collection is definitely  for you. Each movie can stand on it own or it can be watched as part of the larger collection. In summary this collection of 'DIE HARD' movies is well worth it. It one of the first collection of so called 'MAN MOVIES '.",1370908800,,478,4.370786516853933
3180145,5,B000VM8YCI,A must have for die hard fans. Only wish it had the newest movie in it. My husband loved thus gift,1370736000,,98,3.7142857142857144
3180146,5,B000VM8YCI,"John McClane is the quintessential action hero, and this series is one of the most action-packed series ever created.  I cannot believe it has been 25 years since John kicked ""terrorist"" butt all over Nakatomi Plaza.  I remember watching these movies on VHS, and wanted this collection since I saw it released.  I just bought it today,and started watching the first one as soon as I got home.  It absolutely looks amazing and I couldn't be more pleased with the purchase.

The first movie is the absolute best.  There is no comparison to its place in history, and few movies can touch its overall pace and action.  Die Hard IS the definitive top when it comes to action movies, and John McClane continues to go unmatched when it comes to total toughness.  His wittiness and shear grit make him a hollywood classic character.  This is what started the franchise, and he Willis absolutely nails it.  The plot is original and the most intense in the series.  The Blu-Ray version of it is spectacular, and I am amazed at how new this 25 year old movie looks.  Alan Rickman and Bruce Willis are one of the best movie combatting duos of all-time here as McClane and Gruber.

The second movie is by far the worst in the series.  I remember watching it only a few times, and don't remember much of anything that stands out.  I know it's about planes, and that's about it.

The third installment has a great plot, and tremendous acting as well.  Samuel L. Jackson is a good addition, and plays a great sidekick to McClane's lead.  The hoops they have to jump through and mindgames the bad guy makes them jump through are both creative and original.  I can watch this one over and over again, just like the first one.  It never gets old.

The fourth movie has a great updated plot with technology, but doesn't take away much of the action from the original.  The only downfall I saw in this was the whole believability factor.  The first three, as incredible as the plots seemed, were very believable, but this had a lot more over the top sequences.  Even with these, I did like the overall feel of it, and the action was non-stop.  Justin Long's character was great, and John McClane proved again that he was timeless.

I can't believe he has been doing this for 25 years, and want to see the newest one so badly for prosperity's sake.  It can't be any worse than the mindless drivel most movie-makers seem to put out on a yearly basis.  If it has Bruce Willis as John McClane, then I'm at least going to take the time to see it.  This series is a classic and will always hold a special spot for me.  You can't go wrong with this purchase, as you have a great foursome of movies as you can get for the price.",1370649600,,2699,4.426829268292683
3180147,4,B000VM8YCI,"A great collection of the movies that defined its genre. My husband and I enjoy these movies regularly as a fun action packed experience. We are movie buffs and the extra features and the blu-ray quality and clarity had us beaming.

But this review is based upon the set not the movies so I won't digress from the task at hand. I enjoyed the packaging, the pictures were great and the set is obviously compact (great for a bursting shelf!)  The only negative to the packaging is the fact that the disks are slid into cardboard sleeves, but that is common. Plus an extra bonus is when you fan through all the movies you can watch John Mcclane bald, or backwards and watch him grow hair, magically!

So I absolutely recommend this set to action fans, 90's movie fans, or fans of Bruce Willis as a one man wrecking crew. 4.5 stars.",1370390400,2,828,4.434210526315789

The blu ray collection has amazing picture and sound especially if you've got a home entertainment center. The 4th die hard on here is not the unrated edition so just be aware of that.

3180169,4,B000VM8YCI,"This is a great collection. You get four movies for the price of one. Not only is John McClane an immensely likable and witty character, but the supporting characters throughout the four films are compelling and each Die Hard does an admirable job of setting itself apart from the previous one. Director John McTiernan (who also did Predator) really brought all the elements together for the first movie. And even though there was a change of directors for Die Hard 2, Renny Harlin was up to the task and delivered an exciting sequel. McTiernan came back for Die Hard with a Vengeance and which maintained the series' standard of explosive cat-and-mouse action.

If there is a weak link in this collection, it's probably Live Free or Die Hard. While still entertaining, at PG-13 it feels a bit watered down. Still, I heartily recommend this box set to action fans everywhere.",1366934400,,875,4.833333333333333

After we saw it in the theater late last year (2 hours we'll NEVER get back), we decided to go ahead and get this set. The fact that it was featured as a ""Daily Special"" here on Amazon didn't sway us in the least. We'd have gotten it anyway because we think these movies are genius. How many franchises this old actually get better as they age (the most recent entry notwithstanding)? I think that ""Live Free or Die Hard"" was just about as good as the original (but not quite).

3180215,5,B000VM8YCI,"Love all these movies. It's probably been 7 years since I've seen the first one and as I'm watching it I remembered how much I was a repeat watcher cause I found myself saying the lines of the movie out loud.
The case for the box set is good. I like that you open it up like a book and the disc are easy to pull out. I was afraid to get the box set cause I've had problems in the past with them, like the Star Trek Next Generations movies. In the box, each disc comes with it's own thin case and I ended up with 2 of the same movies. It was a easy return and then I got all the movies and the bonus disc. But then I ordered one for my mom's birthday she was missing one of the movies and had 2 of the bonus disc. So be careful when ordering box set movies. Save your recites, print out the bar code for return orders and drive to your local UPS store.
5 stars cause the movies are great, (can't wait to see the next one even though the reviews say it sucks) a well made box set with all 4 movies plus bonus disc, shipped fast and no damage done.",1363737600,2,1045,3.8425925925925926

I was looking forward to seeing Die Hard 4 it in its full, uncut blu-ray glory and couldn't tell by the description here if the 25th anniversary edition would deliver. It was on sale, so I took a chance. It arrived and I found no mention of rating on the box or the disc, so I popped in Die Hard 4 and...yep, it's the edited, PG-13-rated version. That means John McCane's catchphrase gets cut; that's right, the concluding 4-syllable profanity is cut from John's ""Yippie-ki-yay"" catchphrase. Maybe it's just me, but that alone was so annoying that I returned the whole box set.

Die Hard 5 is out and no doubt a new box set will be forthcoming in the next year. Maybe, just maybe, they'll do it right next time.",1362268800,3,830,4.4183006535947715

Well with the most recent inclusion of Die Hard 5: A Good Day To Die HArd, it is obvious that finally there is a Die Hard film that I do not need to wait around for. Apparently in Die HArd 5 John Mcclain forgets how to deliver hillarious punch lines, opting instead to be a humorless neck head ala his fictional son, who is all business, none of which is funny business. ANYWAY... unfortunately the flawless track record of amazing movie after amazing movie in this franchise has ended. So its safe to stick with the four movie box set, and pretend that John Mcclain never had a son. OR maybe they can bring back John Jr in another attempt somewhere down the road with a more believable proffession (as opposed to a CIA operative!)

Even if Die HArd 4 was a little bit goofy, it still had the heart of a great Die HArd movie and these still remain my fave action movies EVER.., thanks.",1361318400,3,1072,4.275862068965517

3180313,1,B000VM8YCI,"First off, not a review of the movies themselves - I'm a Die Hard fan.

This set, however, has some known issues.  If you search around the net, you will find reports that various discs will not even load up in players - sometimes it's the first disc, sometimes the 4th.  There have been a few reports of all discs loading up, but freezing taking place in the middle of playback.

I tried two different sets in three different blu-ray players.  In two of the three players, the first Die Hard would not even load up.  In the third blu-ray player, it did - however I must point out that this particular blu-ray player is old and has not had a firmware update in years.  Yes, the oldest most out-of-date player is the only one that would read the first Die Hard.  In my ""primary"" blu-ray player, I made sure to have the most up-to-date firmware - and it is connected to the internet for any ""OMG there's a problem with the Die Hard set"" updates that may come flashing across the net.  No luck - still would not work.

The reason I tried two sets is because I took the first set back to Best Buy (where I originally bought), and they tried that set as well as the other copy they had in the store on their players.  I even waited as they updated the firmware on their player - still would not even load up.

I have a feeling many people are buying the set and just shelving it, or watching one or two of the movies, and do not even know that they have a defective set.  From what I've read, since the problem isn't necessarily with the same disc in every set, and since it can also happen mid-way through playback - you're not going to know if you have a problem until you watch all of all four movies.  I don't know of many people who do that with these collections within the 30-day return period.  I was ""lucky"" in that my problem manifested immediately, with both sets, during the first disc.

Regardless - I would be very wary about buying this set.  I am not a fan of people who give bad reviews on Amazon related to a single issue like this, however, in my mind this is a pretty serious flaw in the product.  Some people may go months or even years before actually watching all four movies in the set - and then it will be too late for them to try to get their money back in the case of a problem.",1360972800,17,2301,4.167420814479638

I'm not surprised, but I and friends of mine bought this set on that tidbit, and realized we were duped. Live and learn.

3180332,1,B000VM8YCI,"I had every intention of buying this set.  I already own the previous 4-movie collection that came out several years ago, but I honestly don't mind double dipping if there is a significant upgrade in quality and/or quantity of special features.  It's a well known fact that the previous Die Hard collection had sub-par video transfers on the first 3 films and, perhaps most disappointing of all, it didn't include the (in my opinion) far more superior unrated cut of the 4th film.  As some have pointed out, no there isn't much added in the unrated cut aside from some added gore and cursing, but even those minor editions make it feel so much more like a Die Hard movie than one of the other countless generic action flicks that Bruce Willis has been in over the past decade or two.

So as I was saying, I had every intention of upgrading to this new set, thinking surely it would include the unrated cut and improved video quality.  After all, the previous collection came out almost 6 years ago now...with today's technology, it would cost Fox next to nothing to upgrade the films at least somewhat.  As I did a bit of research, though, I saw more and more indications that the video quality would be identical to the earlier release on the first three films.  This was disappointing, but I still vowed to get the set if it included the unrated cut of Live Free or Die Hard, which nobody seemed to have a difinitive answer as to whether it did or not.  However, as another reviewer pointed out, Fox just put out individual releases of all 4 films (which, for whatever reason, don't seem to be available anywhere but Fox's own website which, if you bought all 4 films, would end up costing you about $80-90) and the fourth one DOES include the unrated cut, so I figured this new set was just a combination of those 4 individual releases.

Well, I was in Target yesterday, and I had the new set in my hand.  I looked at the bottom of the box where it lists the ratings for the films and......PG-13.  It does not include the unrated cut.  It does have an extra disc of bonus content (though, not much) but the 4 films themselves are the same discs included in the previous set that was released over half a decade ago.  I immediately put the set back on the shelf and left.

This is just unforgivable to me.  My initial reaction is ""well this release is just for people who don't have the earlier set and can't wait until the inevitable 5-film collection later this year"", but no, that can't be it.  The earlier set is still widely available (in fact, my local Best Buy had both the new one and the old one side by side on the shelf, and the old one was about $25 cheaper) and contains the same content, save for the few bits of special features which definately don't add up to the larger price tag.  People who want the films now can just get that.  Then, there is undoubtedly another ""ultimate collection"" coming sometime this Summer that will include the upcoming fifth movie, as well as all the bonus content for the other films they left out on this one.  So then, if this set is not for the casual fans who want all 4 now and can just get the older/cheaper set, and it is not for the hardcore fans that are willing to wait for the 5-film ultimate collection, who exactly is it for?  The only answer I can think of is that it is meant for people lacking the resources or knowledge to be able to reseach it the way I have and know that there is a cheaper, virtually identical set still available.  It is meant to trap people uneducated on this product into paying around $40 when they can get the old set for between $10 and $20.  I find this dispicable, and if I didn't love the series so much I wouldn't even bother going to see the new movie or buying the next collection.  But alas, I love Die Hard so all I can do is not buy this set and warn other buyers about it, and just wait for the next collection.

I don't like leaving one-star reviews for products I haven't personally purchased, but in this case I have done my homework on it and want to make sure other people don't get fooled by Fox's shady practices.  If you need a Die Hard fix now, buy the older collection that was released in 2007.  You can get it really cheap.  If you are able to wait, wait until May or June sometime when the fifth movie, A Good Day to Die Hard, is released on Blu-ray.  There will inevitably be another collection coming out then with the features that should have been on this one.

EDIT 3/4/13: Well, I found the new individual Blu-ray releases of the 4 films that were previously only available on Fox's website in Best Buy the other day.  As mentioned, the one for Live Free or Die Hard does include the unrated cut, but ONLY on DVD.  The only version on the actual Blu-ray disc is the theatrical version.  So, once again, wait until a 5 film set comes out to get the movies....don't bother with this 25th Anniversary set or the 4 individual Blu-ray releases.  The only way to currently see the unrated cut of Die Hard 4 in high definition is on iTunes.",1359504000,41,5055,4.343617021276596

Next comes the packaging, not the easiest to get the disc out and besides some nice collage of images for each movie there's not much else to say. DO NOT BUY to upgrade previous 4 movie set. The documentary in disc 5 is not even 2 hours and all they show additional to that is all of the trailers for die hard. Nothing worth the extra 40 bucks!!  I just couldn't believe they wouldn't put the unrated version of Live Free or Die Hard in this collection on blu ray. Additionally they don't give you any of the movies rating so you can buy this version hoping you'd get the unrated version. No die hard should ever be PG-13. That is a disgrace to the franchise.

The first 2 films, while being the cornerstone for the franchise, are of the worst video quality. While it still isn't bad by any means, they look like they are just up-scaled from the original DVD format, and not actually remastered. The audio on the other hand is fantastic with deep, crisp sound and bass.
The 3rd and 4th films look much better with the 4th looking the best. The audio is also wonderful, a masterpiece for any sound system connected to your TV.
Special features are what you would expect..behind the scenes, interviews, commentary...nothing out of the ordinary and nothing exceptional, but I am one who doesn't buy these kinds of products just because of the special features.
My only gripe is that the 4th film included in this collection is the standard version and not the unrated. Many fans (including myself) take the PG-13 rating as a huge slap in the face..part of the story and part of John McClane's character is about being brash, brutal and uncensored. To not hear the ""yippie Ki-Yay"" line in its entirety is just plain stupid. And the uncensored version should have been included for the fans.
All in all..this is a must own for your blu-ray collection. Hands down, if you've enjoyed any of the Die Hard films without seeing any others, you most definitely would love them all, so its a no brainier to own this awesome collection.
Yippie Ki-Yay!",1357171200,,1648,4.705882352941177

3180352,2,B000VM8YCI,"Cannot believe (actually I can) Fox blew off on remastering these titles. The first time these were released were several years ago and HD technolgy has come a long way since then. These are EXACTLY the same discs as released before (except new labels and packaging) with a fifth disc thrown in to promote the new Die Hard movie (that is not worth the price of these re-treads). This is downright wrong on Fox's part to just repackage a midiocre product and resale it to us fans. Don't even get me going about the fourth one still NOT being the unrated version.
Once again Fox is just out to make money and not to promote a high quality product. Maybe when the fifth one comes to blu ray, will we get another box set? Who knows and at this point in the game, who cares.
I am tired of throwing my hard earned bucks to the cheap company's like Fox. What a wasted opportunity.
If you don't have this set, get the older one because its cheaper. If you own the old one, don't bother upgrading. It is not worth it!! Sad day for us fans!
ADDED ON 2/14/2013: JUST SAW THE DIE HARD MOVIE MARATHON AT MY LOCAL AMC THEATER IN DALLAS.
  HOLD OFF ON GETTING THIS RETREAD SET. FOX HAS REMASTERED THE FOUR FILMS
  AND THEY LOOKED AND SOUNDED AWESOME!!  WHY FOX DID NOT RELEASE THESE
  VERSIONS ON THIS 25TH ANNIVERSARY COLLECTION IS BEYOND ME.
  I just hope I am right. The fifth Die Hard movie should be
  out on home video in a few months, but not sure when Fox will

I was also a little hesitant because some of the reviews were saying the quality was bad & you should wait for better copies. I waited long enough & took a chance. These are all so much better than the dvd's. I watch the Blu-ray version & then put on the dvd version & go from scene to scene & see what the quality is like compared to the Blu-Ray. No comparison. Blu-Ray wins. Even if the movie isn't 100% better it's still far better than the regular dvd, in my opinion, & that's what counts, on MY review. The quality seems to get better on each film. Less & less grain on each one,although it was never a real problem for me. The audio seemed really good on all {4} films but I listen through external speakers hooked up to my stereo. Nothing fancy here, just good old fashioned stereo. The special features get better on each disc too. I really wanted the movies more so than the special features anyway.

I realize that Die Hard and Die Hard 2 are fairly old movies now but this is Blu-ray and the picture quality is pretty pathetic on those disc when compared with the third and fourth films in the series.

FOX did an amazing restoration job on the first two films in the Alien franchise, so why no love for Die Hard? It really could have used it! Ultimately I got this set for a really low price and I like the films enough to only be minorly disappointed with the poorer picture quality of the first two movies.",1345766400,,649,4.233870967741935

I bought this set when it was on sale, and I wasn't expecting it to be the be all end all for blu-ray sets, but I was expecting a better set. The first Die Hard movie suffers from a really lackluster transfer, and no special features of which to talk about. As you progress through the series, there is a definite improvement in the quality of the picture. Die Hard 2 and Die Hard 3 look much better than Die Hard, and Live Free or Die Hard looks fantastic. Again, this set is for those who are looking for just the movies and nothing else. The price I got them for is great, which is why I'm giving it 5 out of 5 instead of 4 out of 5. Great movies, but Fox should give these movies a better HD transfer.",1344988800,,832,4.048484848484849

It comes with 8 dvd's in 4 cases. (One on each side) In the beginning of all the movies the menus are 3d like at the movie theaters. It was a good touch and looked cool. The first 3 are rated R and the 4th is PG-13 or Unrated. The case is tough papery cardboard. One of the sides is open to put the dvd's in. The movie cases are those really thin ones like 2 cm thick. Great movie edge of your seat action. The unrated version has more swearing but it will not show up in the subtitles for some reason...

3180393,5,B000VM8YCI,"I was going to buy movies 1 and 3, but this set was a but cheaper in the end, so I grabbed it. My personal opinions on the quality of these films is 1, 3, 4/2. 2 and 4 are tied.

Video quality: All movies are 2.39:1. Live Free or Die Hard Is certainly the best-looking, but no real surprise. One looks the poorest, since it was not remastered. 2 and 3 are fine. not super-awesome, but good.

Audio quality: A mix of Dolby and DTS. naturally, DTS sounds better. Being a newer recording, 4 sounds the best of the set, and 1 the poorest. I really hoped that the levels would have been fixed for the original, but no.

The originally still a favourite movie for me, even after all these years. All-in-all a very good action movie set. If you want a more detailed review, just look at individual reviews.

I never look at the extras, so I cannot comment on that. The packaging is pretty good and discs pop in and out securely; not too easy, not too hard. they stay in place and are raised from the surface - something i really hate about too-thin disc cases.",1324512000,6,1053,4.223880597014926

But when I searched for my copy of the first Die Hard, I soon remembered that I had sold it years ago, immediately after buying it.  Why?  Because the picture quality was a disgrace.  The very first release of the DVD was NON-anamorphic, grainier than a good VHS tape, and as faded as an unrestored movie print half a century old.  The same miserable quality affected other Fox releases at the time, some of them long-awaited treasures (for me), like several of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals.  I ALMOST ordered the 4-disk BluRay set tonight, until I read the warnings from several disappointed customers.  I am not surprised at anything Fox does, or FAILS to do.  The chorus of boos over those original DVD's was deafening, and after a few years Fox released better, anamorphic versions.  But why should customers tolerate abysmal Bluray engineering from big, rich studios, when small labels are producing ten dollar Blurays of B-movies that look magnificent?

3180412,5,B000VM8YCI,"Let me get some technical things I would want to know out of the way.  This set includes Die Hard, Die Hard 2, Die Hard with a Vengence, and Live Free or Die Hard, the Unrated version.  There was some question in the reviews as to whether it was the unrated version, which makes me question why they would review a product that they don't own.  Now the really big question for me at least is what medium to buy this movie on.  I got a blu ray player last year, and rented the original die hard on blu ray, and have to say that i was disappointed.  When I first got the blu ray player i was originally going ro just rebuy most of the movies in my collection, but I was starting to see that movies made before 2000, or some made just after, just don't look very good in high def.  Some studios really put the time and money into making their classics really look amazing, but Fox just really hasn't done that for its old movies yet, and though Die Hard is by far one of if not the greatest action movie of all time, I would reccoment getting the set on DVD.  The only movie in the set that is going to look better (if not worse) on Blu Ray is Live Free or Die Hard, which is by far the worst movie in the set, so I would reccomend getting it on DVD, or find the Die Hard Trilogy on DVD and getting Live Free or Die Hard on Blu Ray if you are a completionist, or just really like that movie for some reason, but for most fans, this will do nicely.  As far as the movies go, as previously stated Die Hard, the original, is a classic, and easily the best action movie ever made.  Up until Die Hard, action movies were either the tense cat and mouse movies, or over the top (Looke at the director's own Predator, especially the fight in the compound) and when Die Hard came along, it was the idea that the person at the center of an over the top situation could still be human and vulnerable, but it was his will (and wit) that would keep him going when average people would just give up.  It was his love of his family, but that also is a convaluted mess.  Life isn't easy, and there are a lot of pieces that fail within the society, and a lot of people that don't want to get their hands dirty, and the hard works get passed down to John, not because he is the best, but because he won't let it go.  I can tell you having worked in the government that so many things get through the cracks, and the people that get things done because of a sense of duty that they won't give up is at the heart of this movie.  This movie is about not giving up, even though it seems like life is against you because there are too many people in suits that are only interested about what they can acquire, and the world changes more and more to where the buck keeps getting passed.  The whole movie keeps movie on with a dying cowboy breed motif and killer dialogue, and complete control from the director, not to mention great director of photography in jan debont, who went on to direct speed, and also dp for robocop as well as a lot of verhoven's other work, so just a great film all around.  The second tried to be too similar to the first.  It was actually the first Die Hard movie I saw, and though at the time I was in love with the movie, it really doesn't compare to the original in terms of pacing and action, so i have to say it seems a little too much, as in one man couldn't do all that, and becomes a little too cartoony, such as the airplane explosion where he survives via the ejection seat, even though there is no way he would have escaped without internal injuries.  It tries too hard to improve upon a perfect film.  The third film spends a majority of the movie with a buddy team between McClain and Samual L. Jackson, whose racial tensions seem too much of a rip off between what Bruce already did better in the Last Boy Scout, however the twists and turns, not to mention that it doesn't seem as unrealistic in its action sequences.  If you take the best moments from the first two sequals and leave the bad parts you get the first films equal, however the fourth film is just complete garbage.  I remember seeing it in theaters dispite it having a pg 13 rating which should have been my first clue, but I remember the studio talking about it being a hard pg 13 and that there would be a unrated, or really an r rated cut on dvd, however it doesn't help a really tired and unbelevable set of action sequences that do not remind me of the first at all.  its one man takes on a jet plane, and lives.  its like bad video game cgi with McClain insight and one liners interjected.  Over all a really great set of movies, and worth watching all the way through, because you know part five will come out eventually.  I hope they kill off our protaganist so they will stop doing stupid sequels.",1300492800,7,4788,4.1457883369330455
3180413,2,B000VM8YCI,"Great through the first three but number 4 ""Live Free or Die Hard"" was defective. I'll see what Amazon's customer service will do about this.",1295222400,2,141,4.68
3180414,4,B000VM8YCI,"The first two are great because it involves Bruce Willis risking his life for the love of his wife. But, ""Die Hard with a Vengeance"", is typical ignorant Hollywood loud action simple-minded brainless entertainment for people who don't like to think too hard.

This is so typical of Blockbuster movie entertainment. You get two guys who just meet each other, they feel compelled to work with each other although they practically can't stand each other, but yet they carry on like husband and wife with their pansy bickering. Then, what's really stupid that comes with alot of dumb Hollywood films, you get a terrorist who likes to talk in poetry, through an anonymous phone call, about his next terrorist act. Jeez, that is so dumb! The cops are trying to show their cunning and intelligence with serious acting over an overall stupid idea that some professional terrorist is actually enjoying dropping clues about his next move. How can any viewer take this seriously?

I like the first two, but I traded away the third one at the used CD/DVD store, when I had the DVD set.

I thought that ""Live Free and Die Hard"" was a better comeback for Bruce Willis, so it's unfortunate to have to keep this crappy third release in my library.  It stunk so bad, I just refused to have it in my DVD library.  This same outcome applies to how I approach the ""Indiana Jones"" movie series.  The third film with Harrison Ford and Sean Connery (it should have been great, but it wasn't.  Two great stars who cancel each other out as who really leads in the film) just wasn't as great as the first two.  This new fourth ""Indiana Jones' should be a respectable comeback for Harrison Ford.  I hope.

Getting back to ""Die Hard"": The only films that I saw that were stupider than ""Die Hard with a Vengeance"", were ""Tango and Cash"", ""Red Heat"", ""Lethal Weapon"" (yes, all of them), ""Rush Hour"" (I hate it when black people are made to act ignorant or proudly lazy, it only promotes prejudice) and the ultimate (how could people be so stupid to let this scenario happen) blockbuster film: ""Con-Air"".

Bruce Willis' ""Armageddon"" was also ""over the top"" stupid. ""Deep Impact"" was a better, more realistic approach to the same subject.",1290297600,2,2206,4.674418604651163

I'm not that much of a stickler when it comes to quality as long as it's not so bad that I really notice, which I didn't.
However I had 2 problems with this particular set. First, half of the little tabs that are supposed to hold the DVDs in the cases were broken so all the DVDs were loose. And second, all 4 of the movie discs had one place during the movie where it skipped to the next scene (the 1st one actually had 3 skip places). Cleaning the disc and the lens on the player didn't make any difference.
The movies of course are great action flicks, but people who don't like a lot of explosions and violence should stay away. Just wish Bruce Willis hadn't been bald in the final movie, he looked ridiculous. And also that the set didn't have these little flaws.",1279065600,3,927,4.155555555555556

3180432,5,B000VM8YCI,"This is Bruce Willis' defining collection, The Die Hard Tetralogy. As a huge Bruce Willis fan I was very excited to get this because it's a 4-disc set of his greatest movies ever. I really don't have a favorite movie because this is a very rarely collection, in that each film is as good as the last/next.

Included in this set:

Die Hard (1988)
Rated-R/112 mins.
It's Christmas Eve and Bruce is on a mission to save an entire building from a slew of terrorists.
5/5 stars

Die Hard 2: Die Harder (1990)
Rated-R/124 mins.
This time Bruce is trying to save a D.C. airport from complete and total destruction.
5/5 stars

Die Hard With a Vengeance (1995)
Rated-R/131 mins.
Teamed with Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce is on the streets of New York, playing a deadly game of Simon says.
5/5 stars

Live Free or Die Hard (2007)
Rated-PG-13/107 mins.
Bruce now has to contend with cyber-terrorists in this 21st century thrill-fest.
5/5 stars

Each disc includes a TON of extras, too. Each movie/disc includes trailers, featurettes, movies, documentaries, interviews, bonus clips and alternate endings. I especially enjoyed the ""Die Hard With a Vengeance"" alternate ending. It was so funny and so different from how the movie actually ended.

All of the movies look pristine in 1080p blu-ray. I never saw Bruce look or sound so great. This includes 'lossless audio' as well as 'smart menu technology' (the ability to use the menu while the movie is up on the screen).

This comes packaged in a standard blu ray case and the size of this 4-disc collection is roughly the size of 1 standard DVD. Isn't that cool? Each disc includes a color silkscreen picture of Bruce from that particular movie, as well.

I understand Bruce is in negotiations to make ""Die Hard 5"" and can only imagine that it will be just as exciting and thrilling as these 4 movies are. If you have any interest in action, adventure and even comedy you must get this set.",1268179200,5,1923,4.665680473372781

3180436,5,B000VM8YCI,"The 2 first Die Hard movies really represent the apogee of the Action Movie genre in the 20th century. The movies were such tour de force and departures from the regular genre formula of the 80's. Consequently many movies tried to emualte the formula, which is where the labels ""Die Hard in the seas"" (Under Siege) or ""Die Hard in the ...""  became essential to describe many 90's films. But the success was never replicated.
Furthermore, John McClane played brilliantly by Bruce Willis, in my humble opinion is the greatest action hero of his era. No longer are we exposed to the brain dead marine, super juiced martial art expert who could take down a battalion without breaking sweat. McClane is a common man, a regular NYC cop, who happens to be at the wrong place @ the wrong time confronted with impossible odds and who makes it out alive by a combination of his wits, luck and some adrenaline. Being also an irritating jerk (by function of what is said  by his entourage) he might even be considered more like anti-hero.
Die Hard With A Vengeance is a good movie but such a departure from the original first two movies that it didn't live up to the Die hard fanatics. Live free or Die Hard the 4th movie in the serie is also a great popcorn flick although still not comparable to the first two.",1264723200,,1300,4.504237288135593

This is a great buy on those merits alone, however, I dropped two of my stars for a very aggravating omission from the set. In hindsight, I did it to myself by not reading deeper into the product description.

I own the previous DVD collection which includes both a theatrical AND unrated version of Live Free of Die Hard. The unrated has been completely sapped from the BluRay treatment. As a lifelong fan of these movies I found that Live Free was actually a good time, and really in the same spirit as the others while in it's unrated form. This was the McLane we've known all along, not watered down to appeal to (and be accessible to) a younger (PG-13) crowd.

Why was my option to watch the REAL McLane in Live Free taken away for this set? Now it ensures that I have to retain an inferior DVD for my shelf instead of allowing these BluRays to condense my collection.

3180446,5,B000VM8YCI,"The die hard movies have been reviewed to death.  Obviously most considered the first one of the best action moves ever made, if not the best.  It's the sequels that cause debate and get the additional reviews.  The second flick is usually considered the least favorite, and with good reason.  The plots more silly than usual, the action is not the best, with long periods where nothing interesting occurs.  Oh yeah, and Bruce willis is only allowed to by funny about two and half times in the entire movie.  Thought its not the worst movie, its hardly up to die hard standards.

As to the third, while it is far more entertaining, with great action and dialogue, the one thing missing is the claustrophobic nature of the first.  While the second flick wasn't great, at least it felt like a sequel.  This one feels like its own movie, with John McClane thrown in.  Though this may not be a bad thing, depending on what you're hoping from a sequel.  Overall a pretty fun movie, that I've watched quite a few times over the years.

Then there's the hotly debated fourth movie.  Was it necessary?  Probably not, but frankly I think it's the better of the sequels.  The action is top notch, John is wise cracking, but the thing I like most about it is that they didn't provide a huge cheat in the use of technology.  John doesn't do technology.  He admits it, and can't get it right even when he needs to.  His character is older, and the world is starting to out grow him, though not his usefullness.  I was particularly fond of seeing the older john mcclane still beating bad guys and saving the day, but acknowledging he couldn't do everything.

As to the blu ray, it is certainly a great deal.  All four films and a ridiculous amount of special features.  While I admit the transfer of the first two flicks is nothing special, I did compare to my dvds unconverted, and noticed a difference, thought not that great.  The fourth however is my demo movie as it looks AMAZING.  There are also a ton of special features, though I note alot of those that were on the dvds for the first movie are missing, outtakes and such.

While I'm sure there will eventually be a re-release (there were three or four releases on dvd), I'm thrilled with what I have.  Tons of features, pretty picture, and some really great flicks.  If you have a blu ray player give it a shot.",1252886400,3,2357,4.471830985915493

3180454,5,B000VM8YCI,"Some movies are truly transformational, with an impact on not only film but often culture in general.  For example, Star Wars not only changed movies by adding emphasis to special effects, but also helped changed the studio philosophies to one of pursuing blockbusters and more generally, pushed science fiction more towards the mainstream.  Die Hard may not have had the same impact, but it definitely had an effect on the action movie.  After all, after Die Hard, there was Under Siege (Die Hard on a battleship), Under Siege 2 (Die Hard on a train), Passenger 57 (Die Hard on an airplane) and Speed 2 (Die Hard on a cruise ship).  As is typically the case, it's best to stick with the original movie and its sequels, all in the Die Hard Ultimate Collection.

The original Die Hard is, as would be expected, the best in the bunch.  The plot focuses on the siege of an office building by some supposed terrorists.  As is typical in the Die Hard movies, any political motives are mere cover for getting money, in this case, hundreds of millions of dollars in bearer bonds.  The bad guys are led by Alan Rickman in a role that is one of the top villain roles ever.  Bruce Willis, playing cop John McClane, is the man accidentally in the right place in the right time, leading to a cat-and-mouse game with the crooks.

With sequels, the stakes have to be raised, and in Die Hard 2:,Die Harder, the bad guys have taken over an entire airport on a stormy Christmas Eve.  With a number of planes at risk unable to land, the villains are able to hold hundreds hostage to force the accomplishment of  their goal of freeing a notorious (and wealthy) drug lord.  McClane stumbles upon their scheme and leads the effort to stop them.

Die Hard with a Vengeance has bombers threatening New York, with Jeremy Irons leading them.  He plays the brother of Hans Gruber, Rickman's character from the first movie, who leads McClane through a series of dangerous games to distract the NYPD from their actual goal involving the gold in the Federal Reserve.  Although still good, it is my least favorite of the four movies:  Irons may have an Oscar but his villainy pales compared to Rickman's, and Samuel Jackson plays his standard angry-guy role.  Released in 1995, this film does have a certain extra layer of irony after 9/11 with its bombings.

Live Free or Die Hard has Tim Olyphant as a computer genius who has hacked into major infrastructure systems and is throwing the country into chaos.  McClane isn't much with computers, but his old-school ways (that is, shoot-em-up) will prove to be quite the match.  Justin Long plays a hacker who is an inadvertent accomplice and then is targeted for assassination.

While none of these movies are the sort to win Oscars, they are all loud, turn-off-your-brain action-filled roller coaster rides,  Besides the movies, there are heaps of extras (each movie is a two disc set) including commentaries and ""making-of"" features.  If you're a fan of action movies, this Die Hard boxed set should be part of your DVD collection.",1235174400,,3052,4.715094339622642

So this review below is for the 2009 set, not the 2013 set. I do not own the 2013 set (25th Anniversary Collection).  Check when other reviews were written by other members to see if they posted recent reviews for the 2013 edition.

When I think Blu-ray, I expect high quality video and sound, otherwise there is no point to buying a blu-ray version of an already existing dvd.
The first two movies, Die Hard 1 & 2 from the 80's, look terrible visually.  FOX did a horrible job in re-mastering these for blu-ray, or they did not re-master them at all.  It is possible they used the regular dvd's and just up-converted them without remastering/restoring them digitally.  Sound is decent.  The third film, Die Hard with a Vengeance is more recent from the 90's, but it doesn't look great.  The fourth film does look good and sounds great, but it would be more convenient to just purchase the fourth film as a blu-ray version and get the first three on regular DVD if you don't own them already.  You would save a lot more money and you would be getting the same thing as this box set here.  FOX definitely messed up with this whole set.

UPDATE: If the price does drop under thirty and you don't own any of these movies, the set is worth purchasing.  If you already own the movies on DVD, the upgrade isn't worth the price. Wait for a new remastered version to be released in the future. Many shots are soft in Die Hard 1 and Die Hard 2. It's hard to believe that the films were shot this way with the focus so soft.

3180468,5,B000VM8YCI,"This is by far one of the best series of action movies you will ever see. Bruce Willis and the rest the casts of each movie made them believeable and the writing, directing, camera work, sound, and music were great. It is not surprising everyone knows at least one movie in this set and there is hardly a person on the planet not familiar with the name of a fictional cop John McClane and his famous quotes while being in the right place at the wrong time.

Synopsis:
In the first movie McClane, a New York City cop, goes to LA to visit his wife that has moved there with their kids because she was offered an exceptional position. While flying out another passenger tells John that the best way to relax after a long flight is to take off shoes and socks and curl your toes in the carpet. Unfortunately John must try to rescue everyone at the building when terrorist take over to steal bonds and he runs around barefoot the whole movie through broken glass.

During the second film McClane encounters terrorists at Dulles Airport in Washington DC trying to rescue a military prisoner by taking over the tower controls to the planes. This time he must fight them while barely clothed in frigid weather.

In the third movie McClane has drawn the attention of the brother of the head terrorist in the first movie that is also intent on bombing people as a cover up to a gold heist. He demands McClane do some Simple Simon tricks. McClane is brought in from his suspension with a bad hangover and headache and has to stand in Harlem in his underwear with a deragatory sign to blacks when he gets the assistance of a racist shop owner played by Samuel Jackson. Jackson helps him track down the terrorists and the two make a great comical pair.

In the fourth movie McClane finds out the terrorist control several government agencies and the utilities through the internet so they can rob them. While picking up a hacker, played by Justin Long, for the FBI they are both nearly killed and he enlists the aid of Long to track down the terrorists.

Although I had the individual movies I couldn't pass on this set after reading the review by ""The Game"". I wanted a set anyway and it looks like this is a great one for a super price. One other thing. I couldn't tell from the ad, but this is four thin DVD cases in a cardboard box so it takes less than half the shelf space of the four full size cases. This set includes an extra disc for each movie dedicated to extras. One of the best when it comes to all the background on the movies and then an exceptional price for all this material. The quality was just as indicated, very sharp and clear. I am very happy with this set. Excellent replayability. If you enjoyed this catch ""Lethal Weapon"" and ""Unbreakable"".

Before I picked up this collection I hadn't seen a Die Hard movie in a long time but I remembered loving the first and third, but hating the second.  This is pretty much still true, but the second one isn't as bad as I remembered.  There where some highlights (I laughed when I saw the most interesting man in the world), but the first and third are by far the best.  The fourth one is good, but it's missing the gritty style of the first three.  Picture quality is excellent on all of the films, and suprisingly good on the first one considering it's like 20 yrs old.  I don't have the best surround sound in the world, but the sound quality was great as well.  The packaging is nice and the I like the way the menus have a similar style for each movie.

3180474,3,B000VM8YCI,"First, let me start by saying I love the Die Hard movies. So when I saw this collection on BD, I just couldn't refuse!

You already know the movies, so let's get to the overall package.

Positives:
+ DTS MA on every movie that really reinvigorates the films
+ Good set of extras, not a single feature from the standard DVDs is left out, making you think these are the definitive versions to have
+ Special box saves you space on shelf and keeps discs safe. It's a little bigger than the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Planet-Earth-The-Complete-BBC-Series-Blu-ray/dp/B000MRAAJM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Planet Earth - The Complete BBC Series [Blu-ray</a>] boxset (without the slipcase).
+ Exactly the same discs as individual releases, so you're not getting gimped versions of the already released BD movies --they're the same.
+ Live Free or Die Hard is a total show-stopper, demo material, A+ reference disc. Both in terms of video and audio, this is one of the best movies to showcase what High Definition is all about (and the movie itself is a great ride, btw)

Negatives:
- In the first three movies, both subtitles and dubs in spanish are CASTILLIAN, not Latin American. Why on earth did FOX included castillian dubs/subs on an AMERICAN, region locked disc, goes beyond me. They should know by now that most latin people HATE the castillian dubbing, specially when these movies have such great voice acting. Granted, I always prefer to watch movies in their original languaje w/subs, but there's always the chance to borrow or watch the movie with people that prefer to hear it in their own language. Even the regionalized castilian subtitles are distracting. This is not a problem on the 4th movie. The voice acting and subs are the way they should be for an american release.
- The first 2 movies look downright awful, to the point it seems you put the SE DVD and upconverted it. Time is totally not an excuse: just look at the impressive video quality of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman-The-Movie-Blu-ray/dp/B0016MOWOQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Batman: The Movie [Blu-ray</a>]: a 40 yo movie that looks absolutely fantastic (more than it deserves, if I may be so bold). And that flick is probably just being released to make a quick buck on the batman fever, so FOX, you're telling me you couldn't give a AAA movie such as Die Hard a proper transfer? Come on...
- The 3rd movie looks way better, but still does not compare to the visual blast that is Live Free or Die Hard.
- The 4th movie is the theatrical, PG-13 version, not the UNRATED one. Again, what's going on here! Simply put, FOX could have put both version on the same disc via seamless branching. This has been a reality since the days of DVD, and there are a couple BD that have this feature already, so NO excuse.
- The special features on every disc are Standard Def. only to the point most of them look like VHS (this is no exaggeration). Not a single drop of remastering love (let alone HD treatment) has been poured on even the alternate endings.

Bottom line? This is looking like a future double dip. If you don't care for extras or hearing the movies in a language other than English, this will probably suit you fine, even without the unrated cut of Live Free or Die Hard.

However, this is far from being the Definitive version of the movies to have, to the point of getting me wondering if FOX actually knows the fact that this edition of the movie should be the one for all the american continent. Moreso, I'm left guessing if they care about what their public wants: both their High Definition users and their non-north american audience.",1214870400,878,3720,4.964686998394863
3180475,5,B000VM8YCI,"Having viewed both this set and the blu-ray collection, I can honestly say this is the set to buy.  The blu-ray collection is very nice and looks good but the older films (especially the first) just don't look any better in blu-ray.  It actually looks more grainy on the blu-ray than the traditional dvd.  However, the 4th film looks spectacular in blu-ray but that is the only one I would say is worth the extra cash.  This set costs about half of the blu-ray edition and includes more extra features than any Die Hard fan could want.  Each movie comes with a bonus disc chalk full of commentaries, documentaries, and behind the scenes footage.  I found the audio and video of these dvds to be mastered very well considering the 1st film is 20 years old.  The only issue i noticed was slight edge enhancement on certain scenes in the first 3 movies, but hardly distracting.  So do yourself a favor, save the cash and buy a set that is just about as good.

In theaters, Die Hard 4 had the displeasure of a PG-13 rating, and really gutted most of what made Die Hard what it is.

Now, I understand that most of you think swears or not the movie was fine, but I truly disagree. Iconic moments from all three films (including the incredibly famous Yippie Kai Yay, *@#$%@) had swears in them.  From all the films.  To not include the unrated edition in this collectors edition set was a slap to my face.  Especially because I didn't realize it till I put the Bluray in!

Now, that being said, this ""unrated version"" is still completely unavailable on bluray!  You won't find it yet!  So if you are looking for the gritty laughter and iconic style of the other films, and you want a high definition experience, you'll have to wait.

3180483,4,B000VM8YCI,"Here's some cool trivia:

The original 1988 Die Hard is based on a 1979 novel by Roderick Thorp titled&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nothing-Lasts-Forever/dp/0345287819/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nothing Lasts Forever</a>, which was a sequel to Thorp's book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Detective/dp/0385294697/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Detective</a>&nbsp;that was made into the movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Detective/dp/B0007PALXE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Detective</a>&nbsp;starring Frank Sinatra in 1968.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Predator/dp/B000244EMO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Predator</a>&nbsp;Director John McTiernan directed Die Hard.

In Die Hard, Hans Gruber is played by Alan Rickman, now more famous for his role as Servious Snape in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harry-Potter/dp/B000W4B8NC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harry Potter</a>&nbsp;series. Rickman and Jeremy Irons, in my opinion, could easily be confused with each other...especially when they're heavily costumed.

Die Hard 2 was based on the book titled 58 Minutes&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/58-Minutes/dp/0812510038/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">58 Minutes</a>&nbsp;by Walter Wager. The plane crash at the beginning of the movie is considered one of the most horrific ever filmed (according to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Maxim/dp/B000T8XYOW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Maxim</a>.

Die Hard 3 has John McTiernan back in the director's seat, and DH3 is the only one of the four to have been written by a screenwriter. It stars Alan-Rickman-act-alike Jeremy Irons as 'the bad guy'.

Die Hard 4 is based on a 1997 Wired article by John Carlin (see it here wired.com/wired/archive/5.05/netizen.html). DH4 is directed by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Underworld/dp/B000TGJ80I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Underworld</a>&nbsp;series master Len Wiseman and stars that dude (Justin Long) who's more popular from his stint in the recent Apple Computer commercials than his past acting roles.

This Blu Ray compilation of all four films is a great package. Chances are that you're here (like I was) because you've already seen the first three, and you're wondering if it's worth it to buy the entire collection in order to get the 4th? I'll say this: the fourth (Live Free or Die Hard) stands out as one of the best, if not the best, of the series. So if you've always wanted the Die Hard series in your collection, this great compilation is for you.

Like the previous 3 movies, in Live Free or Die Hard John McClane (Bruce Willis) is seemingly indestructible, surviving death defying feat after death defying feat. Willis' banter with costar Long is witty and funnier than anything from the first three movies combined. The action is non-stop, and the supporting cast is fabulous (especially&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Deadwood-s/dp/B000O5B4BU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Deadwood's</a>&nbsp;Timothy Olyphant).

But ask any 20 something now about what an amazing guy series this movie is!  its ""the standard"" in guy action movies!

i recall in the U.S there used to be ad campaign on TNT: ""Movies for guys who love movies""  DH was always in the lineup!

Enough reminiscing about DH, for the fact all 4 were released on Bluray was a big step forward! i was hoping to get it when that actually happens. Lets thank sony for not messing up the encoding on these discs like F4 2 (u guys know what i am talking about!)  I bring this up because there is a ton of fun stuff on the discs that takes a while to load and experience.

Back to the movie...i think these 2 guys in Hollywood struck a very nice balance of bringing an old analog hero in a digital world.  They kept the amazing depth of the characters around and did not mess it up like most franchise movies when they make a #4 of its kind!  i think #4 is the best DH yet. The stunts and the action sequence is BIG guys! i mean BIG!  and of course the BD performance in picture and sound added to the realism of what was happening here. This was key always in DH: realism!  there were some crazy moments but allot of fun.

I gave it 4 stars because the 1st DH was similar to T1 in terms of quality. I don't know how much remastering one can do on the older print of DH1 and DH2. But the sound was definitely remastered.

3180491,5,B000VM8YCI,"Even though I noticed that Bruce's showing his age, I still enjoyed watching him in his signature role. The only complain I have is that his daughter should have had more screen time. She's not only daddy's little girl, but grew up to have his tenacity. Maybe a sequel is in order for her to follow in her daddy's footsteps?",1198540800,,324,4.416666666666667
3180492,5,B000VM8YCI,"From where do you want me to start? I have all this movies on DVDs and now I have them on Blu-ray for my BD. There is no way the picture quality can be any batter, on this set way pass any copy I have ever seen. The DTS HD was awesome on all the movies, and the Sound quality That movie has one of the best audio tracks I've heard from Blu-Ray so far.
I'm happy with my set and I'm hopping you will enjoy them too.",1196380800,6,414,3.715909090909091

8219436,1,B000VM8YCI,"This review is for this box set, *not* the Die Hard movies.

Finally got around to watching this Blu-Ray set and what do I find? About an hour thirty into the first movie, it starts freezing and skipping. A brand new, never been opened disk, free of cosmetic flaws...and it has playback errors. And this didn't come from some third party seller, this came from Amazon.

I unfortunately cannot return the set since I bought it over a year ago. Luckily I got this on sale, so I'm only out $19. Maybe Best Buy will have a working copy?",1520121600,4,532,4.363636363636363
