8671559,3,B00MBVLDA2,"I've loved sepulture for a long time ,and I was excited to get a live show in my house. But the metal drums was cool at first but after three songs I had enough. It got old fast and took away from the band awesome sound. hopefullyI can find a show with just the band in the future.",1420243200,,281,3.8620689655172415
