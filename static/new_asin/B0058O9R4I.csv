4601459,3,B0058O9R4I,"This was a spin off from ""Waking the Dead"", about a cold case unit. The lead here was the pathologist in that series. However, she was not a strong character in that show. I was rather surprised to see her step into the lead in this series as she seems far more capable of supporting actor work. I did not appreciate, until seeing this spin off, how important it is to have a strong, almost overwhelming actor in the lead. Trevor Eve was that lead in ""Waking the Dead"". He played one of the most obnoxious people imaginable. Yet he was very effective as the leader of the unit. With his not being in the spin-off, it was as if the air had gone out of the show, like a balloon.  Trevor Eve juiced up the show and made it compelling. Sometimes you wanted to throw the set at him but you never wanted to turn it off. This spin-off never had anyone like that in it. So I learned something: nice characters without that strong personality have a hard, almost impossible time, getting series tv off the ground. I fully expected it to last only one season and that is all it did.",1439769600,4,1072,4.254901960784314

4601461,3,B0058O9R4I,"Not the greatest forensic shows, disappointing, that's why there is only one season.  Too bad.",1426377600,3,94,5.266666666666667
4601462,5,B0058O9R4I,So wish they had continued with the series!,1418947200,2,43,4.5
4601463,2,B0058O9R4I,"Waking the Dead was spot on...this was too gory to watch!  Forget disc 1, go to 2 and 3 and forget 4!

Too explicit to watch!!!  Don't waste your money on this one!",1399248000,3,164,3.909090909090909
4601464,5,B0058O9R4I,"I couldn't be happier with the fast shipping and receipt of my DVD.  I have had items from just across the border in the US take 10 times faster to arrive than this did all the way from UK.  Thanks so much.  Loved this show and will enjoy having it on hand to watch again.  Packaged securely, item in A1 shape when it arrived.  Thanks so much again !",1351555200,3,350,4.0144927536231885

4601467,3,B0058O9R4I,"I like Fitzgerald a lot, but this series seems a little trite and the characters a bit overdrawn, especially the Aspergers-type guy. Maybe Ive just seem one too many seasons of Bones?",1458864000,,183,4.75
4601468,5,B0058O9R4I,A great intelligent show. If you like the dark murder mystery with scientists and cops struggling to understand each other and solve murders you will love this!,1457654400,2,160,4.962962962962963

4601470,3,B0058O9R4I,enjoyable if you like this genre,1454544000,,32,4.5
4601471,2,B0058O9R4I,"Disappointing.  The crew lacks the interest of the Waking the Dead crew, the heavy bracketing narration has little relevance to the stories, the fact the crew works on active cases alongside a detective is implausible, and most of all, they almost never use the bodies in the body farm to help their cases, thus, the body farm setting is irrelevant.  It is watchable, but again, disappointing.",1451865600,6,393,4.9393939393939394
4601472,2,B0058O9R4I,Depressing and not really that good in my opinion.,1449273600,,50,4.666666666666667

4601474,5,B0058O9R4I,Really enjoyed the show. It's unusual and portrays a different point of view to CSI work.  I found each show an interesting reflection on humanity and how situations and evidence can evolve.,1446681600,,190,4.9375
4601475,1,B0058O9R4I,"I couldn't make it through 2 episodes. It is an attempt to copy the better CSI top shows, but it's SO poorly done. It is totally contrived, in that they find some scientific fact, and then try to build a story around it. I can't recall ever being so disappointed in a show. I love UK cop shows, but this falls flat on its face. Don't waste your time, or money.",1445817600,7,360,4.084507042253521

4601479,5,B0058O9R4I,"I loved this series!!!! It was edgy and if I'd seen it when it first premiered, I would've said it was a one-of-a-kind series. Of course now we have all of the CSI's and all those other forensic evidence examination shows. Still I liked this show because the characters seemed like something that has not been presented in American TV thus far. Great meld of characters that gels well within the storyline. I liked this show, but watch it for yourself.",1441929600,2,452,4.592592592592593
4601480,5,B0058O9R4I,"Well written and produced. Intriguing characters and well cast. Pity it only lasted one season.
Some people complained about the Gore, but decay is a natural process and nature isn't always pretty. It's reality. The science of forensics help the dead to speak, especially those who were the victims of murder and their families, and hopefully find justice. Cracking good show!",1441843200,2,376,5.180327868852459

8462008,5,B0058O9R4I,Very realistic and involved in how crimes are often figured out through research done at body farms. Definitely different from the usual crime show and I'll watch more of the series. Had a technical view and yet kept personal interaction of team members too.,1469923200,,258,4.886363636363637
