8029576,4,B0002NAG6S,"The DVD arrived in good shape and on time.  The video at times had the clarity as shown on the cover, a bit hazy.  Uncle Charlie (Wilson, formerly of the Gap Band) is shown either in the credits or initially on stage, but he quickly disappears is not in the music line up.  Maybe a contractual issue?  Nonetheless, he would have been the show himself; he is HOT right now.  Others were correct when they say, ""Tom Joyner needs to sit down, and get out of the way.""  I mean, I appreciate him helping to put the show on, but really?  He cannot dance, play music, or sing.  Say your piece, and bow out until intermission, please, I love you man.  Overall, this was a good concert.  Wish it had all of the artists in the show on the DVD.  Good concert for the cost.",1303257600,,761,4.179310344827586

8029579,5,B0002NAG6S,Probably the greatest Funk concert I've ever heard or seen especially the DAZZ band.  Too bad it can't be played in the US on a standard DVD player.,1251072000,2,148,4.285714285714286
