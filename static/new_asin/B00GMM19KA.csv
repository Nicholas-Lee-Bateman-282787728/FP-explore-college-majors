6086960,5,B00GMM19KA,Every Baby Boomer needs to see this documentary - priceless!,1408233600,,60,5.1
6086961,5,B00GMM19KA,"For anyone in their late 50's and older this DVD of the ""American Experience: 1964"" with bring back a lot of memories and probably a wave of nostalgia. For those younger this DVD should prove riveting to watch as an important year in the history of the United States is told. The PBS series ""American Experience"" has a well known reputation for quality programs and ""1964"" rates as one of the very best I think. It starts by looking back to that fateful day in Dallas in November  when President Kennedy was assassinated and how that event would launch what would occur in the year to come.

It would start of course with Vice President Lyndon Johnson suddenly now the new President and inherits all the important issues that President Kennedy has had to deal with. The biggest domestic issue would be civil rights that would come to the fore front in the country in 1964. With resistance in the south among the politicians to even bring a vote for equal rights to the senate. The documentary does a very good job of showing just how Johnson would go about getting the votes he needed to get the bill passed. He was able to get the votes in a way that Kennedy could never have and it would certainly show the greatest moment in President Johnson's term as he got the 1964 Equal Rights Act passed. Of course the documentary also looks at the early beginnings of what would become Lyndon Johnson's downfall as President as he would draw the country into the Vietnam war beginning with the Gulf of Tonkin incident.

As for the civil rights movement itself ""1964"" looks at the freedom riders and what they would face as they came in buses from the north to the south and how they would prepare for it. It of course covers the murder of the three civil rights workers killed in Mississippi and the emotional impact it brought on the nation at its brutality.

The program also does an excellent job at looking at the beginnings of the conservative movement that would take over the republican party with the nomination of Barry Goldwater as its candidate for President in 1964. It also looks at the beginnings of the women's movement towards women's rights that was started by Betty Freidan with her book ""The Feminine Mystic"".

There are more lighthearted moments as well covered by this documentary as it remembers the beginning of the British invasion with the appearance of the Beatles on the Ed Sullivan show and during their stay in the U.S. including getting to meet Cassius Clay shortly before his fight against Sonny Liston for the boxing heavyweight title as well as that fight itself and Clay's finally announcing his conversion to the Islamic faith and change of name to Mohammed Ali.

This is an outstand documentary looking at one important year in the history of our country. There were other important years in our history but ""1964"" is an excellent presentation of how one year in the United States history would change us as a country.",1406246400,2,2947,4.657692307692308
6086962,5,B00GMM19KA,Saw this on television when it first was shown.  I think if you're a 'boomer' you will find it particularly interesting.  Well done.,1399766400,,132,4.695652173913044
6086963,5,B00GMM19KA,"What I really want is a related DVD"" PBS American Experience: ""1964 -- The Year America Lost It"".  I found it on Amazon one day and then it disappeared.  PBS says it's out of publication.  It's similar to the one I bought, but not identical, though boxed in an identical case.  I know it exists because a library I use has it.  But I need my own copy.  The one I was able to get is also a PBS American Experience DVD titled ""1965 -- The Year America Stood Up - and Split Apart.""

I would be very grateful for the opportunity buy the one I most want.",1396742400,,549,4.027777777777778
6086964,4,B00GMM19KA,"Graduated high school in 64.  Enjoyed watching it on PBS and decided I wanted to have an archive copy.  Good docu.  Stuff missing, things that should have been covered (along with some less so), sure; but overall it's a decent effort.  Mostly for those that came of age in that period.",1396310400,,285,4.529411764705882
6086965,5,B00GMM19KA,Really a great documentary that American Experience has put out once again. I was totally into this documentary of 1964.,1395014400,2,120,5.05
6086966,5,B00GMM19KA,"As a U.S. History teacher, for the 60's it is just a fantastic look and the beginning of the Great American Revolution, and we have never been the same since.  The scenes with the Beatles and Cassius Clay, are worth the DVD alone.",1394755200,3,230,4.348837209302325
6086967,5,B00GMM19KA,"As usual, I enjoyed this latest PBS American Experience installment. This one seemed especially valuable, though, because it turns out 1964 was a watershed year in American history.

I did think that on the whole it tilted a bit to the left. I support many liberal causes, but I was disappointed that this show wasn't more objective. The documentary made it seem like the only people doing anything significant in 1964 were heroic freedom-fighting liberals and right-wing reactionary racist extremists. This could give the viewer a distorted view of history. Were there any moderates or non-extreme conservatives doing anything worthwhile then? How about a-political people? Artists, writers, scholars, scientists, engineers, others?

Most of the people interviewed seemed to look back to the 1960s with fond nostalgia. That's certainly the note the documentary closed on. I am sympathetic to the many gains we made with civil rights, etc. But personally I think the 60s also started some lamentable trends with terrible consequences - working moms, sexual immorality, individualism at the expense of community, etc. I admire the hippies for seeking something better, but in my opinion in many cases they threw the baby out with the bathwater. Not everything about the 1950s was bad.

Overall, I highly recommend this show. I will show it to my kids.

If you liked this documentary, then&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/American-Experience-LBJ/dp/B000BYRCDI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">American Experience: LBJ</a>&nbsp;is a nice compliment. It tells more about Johnson and how things went later in the decade.

[Added]

I didn't know this before, but another reviewer pointed out that the Republicans overwhelmingly supported the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Wikipedia backs up that claim:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964#By_party

Southern politicians, both Republican and Democrat, were the only ones that opposed it.

I know the political parties were different then. But this confirms my feeling that this documentary is tilted toward the progressive side of the story.

[Updated]
I watched this a second time several months later and it didn't seem nearly as biased toward the left this time. If you have to present the most important happenings of this period in a short doc like this, then this seemed to do that well. I enjoyed it the second time as much as the first. Enjoy might not be the right word - some awful things happened - but at least my brain enjoyed being so well informed.",1392163200,18,2554,5.544987146529563
6086968,5,B00GMM19KA,"We caught this documentary on PBS streaming video, and according to the PBS website, the DVD, to be released on February 4, is the two hour documentary with English subtitles available and no other content.

As for the documentary itself, we had low expectations. In recent years, previously excellent shows like NOVA and Frontline have turned into infotainment that skims the surface. Breathless commentary and gee-whiz special effects replace information and science.

However, American Experience: 1964 was just great. There's plenty of film from the time, and lots of people who have vivid memories of the year are interviewed. In this show, we hear from Hodding Carter, Todd Gitlin, Stephanie Coontz, Phyllis Schlafly, Jann Wenner, Jon Margolis, Rick Perlstein, Robert Dallek, Robert Caro, Mark Kurlansky, and more. Presented in a roughly chronological sequence, it starts with New Year in Times Square, only weeks after JFK was assassinated. Weeks later, the Beatles would appear on The Ed Sullivan Show for the first time. From tragedy to giddiness, to tragedy again, as the Civil Rights debate, simmering all along, starts boiling over when Lyndon Johnson makes it his priority.

Hearing from historians and biographers helps put things in perspective, but the testimony from some who were there is what makes you realize how people felt at the time. One civil rights organizer, Dave Dennis, recalls the moment when he moved from calling for peaceful change to calling for change at any price. It's powerful, and the fact that there is film to document his moment of evolution is riveting.

Barry Goldwater, Betty Friedan, Cassius Clay/Muhammad Ali, the Harlem Riots, Bewitched, the murder of three civil rights workers in Mississippi, the Gulf of Tonkin and the escalation of the war in Vietnam, it's all in here, and arranged and edited so that it makes as much sense as a two hour review of a single year can. It could have been a hodgepodge of sights and sounds, but it comes across as a milestone year, musically, politically, socially.

Even if you were there, you will learn something from this well thought out documentary of a year that is still resonating.",1390003200,31,2174,5.078431372549019
6086979,2,B00GMM19KA,"I was enjoying this documentary, the year following the death of Kennedy, until it talked about the Civil Rights movement. The talking head they put on made it sound as if it was REPUBLICANS who whose resistance to the Civil Rights Act gave LBJ fits. Actually, it was the DEMOCRAT members of the senate and the house who blocked it.

I will say that the program did give Goldwater credit for the kind of politician he was, conservative, and what that meant. Too bad they didn't also talk about George Wallace's bid for the democrat nomination.",1425513600,,543,4.65625
6086980,5,B00GMM19KA,"You have to understand the events of 1964 before you can understand the events of 1968.  I like the way this documentary mentions the Warren Commission conclusions, which were made public in September and October 1964, without obsessing on the events as they had unfolded in November 1963.  People today need to see them from the perspective of 1964.",1421280000,,350,4.915254237288136

6086982,4,B00GMM19KA,"This is a good American Ex. episode covering life in America from November 1963 through 1964. The effect of the Beatles, Cassius Clay to Mohammed Ali, to the death of the 3 civil-rights workers, and the beginnings of some of the mid-sixties riots. These event influences American culture still in 2014!",1414886400,,302,4.9411764705882355

6086984,1,B00GMM19KA,"Since I remember 1964 I thought I'd indulge in some nostalgia and watch this film. But it presents a conservative fringe view of those days, one I did not share or enjoy. It emphasizes the viewpoint of arch conservatives remembering the year when times began to change and their wealth no longer gave them the status they thought they were due. They thought the most important happening of the year was Barry Goldwater's nomination (and massive loss) for president. The film considers the Beatles nothing and reports with glee them being called pansies by two different public figures. And on and on.  No not very enjoyable for most normal Americans who remember that year.",1411948800,,673,4.9035087719298245
6086985,3,B00GMM19KA,"This documentary is filled with fantastic film footage of many key events from 1964, and it contains some great current interviews with several people who were first hand participants in these events.  So, this film does a pretty good job of capturing this time period, except for it's almost laughable leftist tilt.

An uninformed viewer would come away believing that if not for Lyndon Johnson's skillful arm twisting, Republican's in Congress would have thwarted the passage of the Civil Rights Act, when in fact, Republican support was overwhelming (over 80% in both chambers), whereas Democratic support was a bit more tepid (69% Senate-63% House).  The film skillfully implied the exact opposite.

And while the film is focused primary on the racial struggles of this time, it conveniently leaves out any mention of 1964 Democratic presidential candidate George Wallace, who was the very face of racial hatred and pro-segregation fervor?  An innocent oversight, I'm sure.

These are but two examples of a mindset that pervades this film.  It'll probably be a long stretch before I watch another PBS ""documentary"".",1411689600,4,1119,5.252808988764045

6086988,5,B00GMM19KA,Great documentary. Sure made me aware of how detached we were from all that strife as kids in high school on the other side of the country. Too bad we didn't have the internet then. Scary times!,1408752000,,194,4.27027027027027
8624703,5,B00GMM19KA,"Truly an amazing documentary, showing how the country changed so much between Kennedy's murder and Christmas 1964, a must for any student of American history and anyone old enough to remember that fateful year or appreciate Sam Cooke's ""A Change is Gonna Come.""",1483660800,,261,5.093023255813954

8624711,3,B00GMM19KA,"I'm sorry, but the Free Speech Movement in Berkeley did a lot less than Peter, Paul, And Mary did by recording ""Blowing in the Wind,"" and this honest, intelligent documentary gave Republicans far, FAR more significance than they had. And Bob Dylan got, oh, about 40 seconds of screen time.  What's up with that, very seriously?  As a 15-year old proto-hippie in a previously segregated Jacksonville, Florida in 1964, what mattered was what the MUSIC was saying, not the politicians or even the activists.  This decent film absolutely doesn't get it, even remotely.  The Beatles and Cassius Clay?  What about their 1964 US tour?  Not a word.  And we were reading Sartre, Rilke, Emily Dickinson - and even Ayn Rand - but waking up, to politics, to ethics, to art - and very truly, to what a meaningful life might consist of - past politics, law, and business.  This documentary is well worth watching, but only once.  And again, it's not the 1964 I vividly remember.",1428105600,2,964,4.759036144578313
