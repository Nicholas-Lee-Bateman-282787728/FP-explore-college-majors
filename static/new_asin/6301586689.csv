7813204,2,6301586689,"I am a big fan of 80s wrestling especially WWE/WWF and NWA/WCW.  This card looked like gold on paper but unfortunately most of the matches were very short under 10 minutes and the building of feuds and promos took president over the matches.  Mr Perfect and Kerry Von Erich I thought had great matches in WWF this match is good but it's way too short I think it was under 10 minutes.  Dusty Rhodes vs Randy Savage could have been a classic with 2 of the biggest stars of the 80s facing each other.  However Dusty Rhodes and his manger being bought by Dibiase took up more time then then the actual match.  Jake Roberts and Bad News was decent but nothing special.  Hulk Hogan and Earthquake was better then expected.  With overweight Earthquake it could have been a real slow bore but it was not too bad but not one of Hogans more memorable matches.  Warrior and Rude who had, had some excellent matches especially the 1989 Summer Slam match had an awful match here.  Maybe it was trying to sell the brutality of the cage but it just made for a real slow match with them laying on the mat and wobbling around, their timing seemed a bit off as well, it was just awful.  The best match of the night was the 2 out of 3 falls Hart Foundation and Demolition match.  These 2 teams always had good matches with each other and this match was long and and had great action and good back and forth stuff it really saved the ppv from being a total dud.",1441497600,,1441,4.280442804428044
7813205,3,6301586689,"Rockers VS Power and Glory: Shawn Michaels is taken out during the entrance and Marty Jannety does the entire match by himself. Jannety does a good job but falls to Power and Glory in the end. I did enjoy Power and Glory's finshing move.

Texas Tornado VS Mr Perfect: Torando wins the IC title in a quick match. They'd have better matches during their feud.

Sherri VS Sapphire: Summerslam turns into a Where's Sapphire mystery. Im glad this match didn't happen. People had to be pretty dumb not to figure out who was giving Sapphire all her expensive gifts.

The Warlord VS Tito Santana: A decent match but nothing to exciting.

Demolition VS Hart Foundation: A very good match, probably the best match of the whole card. It was sloppy in a few spots.

Jake Roberts VS Bad News Brown: Big Bossman was the speical guest ref. Roberts looks out of it, not uncommon in those days sadly, as Brown beats the hell out of Robert for a few minutes with Roberts making a few comeback attempts. Brown gets disqualified for using a chair.

Jim Duggan and Nikolai Volkoff VS Orient Express: Anther who cares on my part.

Randy Savage VS Dusty Rhodes: Could have been a classic but this match was way too short. Million Dollar Man appears with Sapphire, what a shocker. Rhodes gets pinned after a loaded purse to the face.

Hulk Hogan VS Earthquake: Bossman was again an enforcer in this match. I remember this feud and the match was decent but the ending sucked.

Warrior VS Rick Rude in a cage match: One of the worst cage matches i've ever witnessed. Rude would have been an excellent world champion but WWE didn't let too many heels hold the title. Rude had the world title at least 5 or more times but keeps on stalling. Warrior retains the title in a horrific main event.

Overall, this card was decent with only a few good matches. Alot of these matches were under ten minutes.",1236988800,,1871,4.525222551928783
7813206,5,6301586689,"Forget the WWE. As someone else already mentioned, 1990 was a golden year for the WWF. The way this Summerslam built up was huge. After watching Earthquake crush Hulk Hogan's ribs on ""The Brother Love Show"", I wanted to see Hulk settle the score. One of my other favorites back then, Big Bossman was also given the spot to watch Hogan's back after his original corner man, Tugboat, was injured.
I wasn't actually an Ultimate Warrior fan back then and was actually rooting for Rick Rude to leave with the World Title. My most emotional feelings were saved for the 2-out of-3 falls tag match with my favorite team, Demolition facing the fan favorite Hart Foundation. I loved Demolition and even though they added a third member and seemed to turn heel, I was still a loyal fan. I was visibily upset though when the Harts beat them in the third fall with the help of the Legion Of Doom. DAMN THOSE ROAD WARRIORS!!!!
The 1990 event also saw Saphire turn on Dusty Rhodes to join up with Ted Dibiase. This angle still doesn't make much sense and I see why it was scrapped, down the road. We got a great match with Jake The Snake battling Bad News Brown and his ""sewer rats"" who we never got to see. Big Bossman pulled double honors here as guest referee. Other great moments had Shawn Michaels getting put on the shelve courtesy of Power & Glory and newcomer, Texas Tornado beating Mr. Perfect in a major upset.
To me, this was what the WWF was all about. Great matches, great stories, and feuds that were well-developed. Sadly, the WWE of today is just garbage.",1062201600,,1556,4.501766784452297
7813207,5,6301586689,"I honestly believe that 1990 was the year that the WWF delivered some of the best PPV'S ever, Summerslam being a prime example. The night was topped off by a double main event, the first half of it being a classic confrontation between the Earthquake, with Dino Bravo and the ""Mouth of the South"" Jimmy Hart in his corner, versus The Immortal Hulk Hogan (screw Hollywood Hogan), with the Big Boss Man in his corner. Although the match was not as fast paced as fans today are used to, nonetheless, it was a great match for it's time, and in my personal opinion, still a classic confrontation up to this day strictly for the significance that the match carried with it. Had Hogan lost the match, the ideal of him as an immortal wrestling legend would have vanished. Luckily, Hogan came away with the victory. The second half of the double main event consisted of a cage match between the late great Ravishing Rick Rude and the WWF Champion The Ultimate Warrior, still one of the most electrifying champions in WWF history desptite the fact that he only held the title once. The Ultimate Warrior captured the victory. But both of these matches paled in comparison to the WWF Tag Team Title match between the champions Demolition (Ax, Smash, and Crush) versus the Hart Foundation (Bret ""Hitman"" Hart and Jim ""The Anvil"" Neidhart), truly one of the greatest tag team title matches in history before tag team wrestling, and wrestling overall, was plagued with outside interference, therefore taking away the authenticity of any victory or title reign. Some other notable matches include the short but sweet IC title match between Mr. Perfect and the late ""Texas Tornado"" Kerry Von Erich and other matches including Jake ""The Snake"" Roberts and the ""Macho Man"" Randy Savage. If you're an o.g. wrestling fan such as myself, then you would know that no other Summerslam has surpassed the magnitude of Summerslam 90. This is sports entertainment at it's best.",1010880000,,1949,4.82089552238806
7813208,4,6301586689,"This is one the best P.P.V.'s ever. There are one or two matches which aren't worth much but the highpoints definetly make up for it. The event is a double main eventer, with Earthquake v. Hulk Hogan( still 6 years away from being the brilliant Hollywood Hogan) being pretty mediocre, and, WWF Champion The Ultimate Warrior defending against the late Ravishing Rick Rude in a steel cage match. There are several other great matches, Mr. Perfect(curt hennig) defending the IC title against The Texas Tornado(kerry von erich, another deceased wrestler)is short but good, and most notably probably the best match of the card, The Hart Foundation(Bret""Hitman""Hart & Jim""Anvil""Neidhart) defending the WWF Tag Team Titles against Demolition(Brian""Crush""Adams, Barry""Smash""Darsow & Bill""Axe""Eadie) in a Best of Three Falls Match. I defenitly recommend you buy this if for no reason other than hearing Demolition's theme music which is still the best to this day. BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1003536000,4,979,5.447368421052632
