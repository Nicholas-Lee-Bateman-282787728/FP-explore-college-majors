1084510,5,6305873461,"Produced at a time when the public's conception of the war was at an impass, Vietnam: The Ten Thousand Day War was not only a document of one of the darkest chapters in American History, but an indictment of war as a  whole.
This unflinching documentary will take places you never thought  you'd see.  The jungles, the cities, the back roads, the fields, even the  mountains of what was once an idyllic paradise, all are the backdrop for a  journey of horror.  Combining news, military, and independent documentary  footage, we are transported through the entire spectrum of the conflict.  We see it all, from the end of French Occupation, through the arrival of  military ""advosors"", Tet, and the fall of Saigon. You'll even  examine the war at home.
If you are still questioning why this tiny  country in southeast asia was so crucial to our country's history, make  this the first and last documentary you watch on the subject.  You'll never  be the same again.",961459200,59,964,4.763636363636364

1084606,5,6305873461,"Well worth having, viewing and absorbing.  This set of documentary episodes traces its way from the days of French colonialism of the later 19th century, and the oppressive conditions under which the Vietnamese were forced to live, through the first half of the 20th century, after which France finally surrendered control of Vietnam and allowed the establishment of two Vietnam(s), separated by the 17th parallel.  After that, France wanted nothing to do with the Vietnam(s) and the U.S. allowed itself to become involved in what was essentially a Vietnamese civil war; a civil war in which the U.S. foolishly wasted billions of dollars and something on the order of 50,000 U.S. lives lost in a Cold War chess-game-like effort that was doomed to failure from the outset.  It still serves as a lesson, for both the U.S. government and military, that press coverage must be strictly controlled regarding the reporting of military conflicts; an unfortunate reminder that, in war, the first casualty is always ""the truth"".  This episode in history was pretty much played out on T.V. sets back in the U.S. and the public opinion that developed would eventually act to throttle military efforts and tactics to the point where the eventual demise of the ill-advised U.S. efforts were unavoidable.",1476057600,,1290,5.099526066350711

1084612,5,6305873461,"The Ten Thousand Day War:  Vietnam, 1945-1975 is a 26-part documentary about the war in Vietnam, produced by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.  It was conceived by Michael Maclear, a Canadian broadcast journalist and film maker, who had spent some time in North Vietnam during the war.  Maclears wife, Mariko Koide, a Japanese news researcher, had contacts which helped Maclear gain access to archival film from North Vietnamese military and civilian organizations (unfortunately, this film, in black and white, is of poor quality).  This series also employs film from Canadian, French, Australian, and Japanese news organizations, from the U.S. National Archives, and the Nixon, Kennedy, Johnson, and Ford Presidential Libraries.  The script was written by Peter Arnett (who won a Pulitzer Prize in 1966 for his reporting on Vietnam), and narrated by actor Richard Basehart.  Interviews with a wide range of U.S. and Vietnamese officials (especially Nguyen Cao Ky and Nguyen Van Thieu), and American military officers and soldiers provide important perspectives on the war.  There is less input from the other side, mainly from Australian reporter Wilfred Burchett, and Ha Van Lau.

The series opens with America in Vietnam, a 51-minute overview of U.S. involvement in Vietnam from 1945 to 1975.  Most of the 25 subsequent 25-minute programs are devoted to a general history of the war (with some overlapping between programs), beginning with a brief account of Vietnamese anti-colonialist activities before WWII, and a description of how the Viet Minh and the OSS fought together against the Japanese during World War II.  During that war, the U.S. opposed restoration of French rule in Viet Nam; but after the war, and especially after the Communist victory in China and the outbreak of the Korean War, the U.S. began assisting the French in Vietnam.  The Ten Thousand Day War devotes an entire program to the battle of Dien Bien Phu, then discusses the Geneva Conference, the Diem regime, and the assassination of Diem, Viet Cong guerrilla warfare against South Viet Nam, the Tonkin Gulf incident, growing U.S. involvement through advisers, bombing, and ground troops, the siege of Khe Sanh, the TET offensive, Nixons Vietnamization policy, peace negotiations, the final military campaign, and U.S. withdrawal from Viet Nam.  Along the way, we learn about Viet Cong tunnel systems, American air and naval firepower, body counts, the limitations of the Army of South Viet Nam, and the impact of the U.S. presence on Vietnamese officials and people,

In addition to this general history of the conflict, The Ten Thousand Day War includes special programs focused on each of the following specific aspects of the war:  (1) North Vietnamese society, (2) the Ho Chi Minh Trail, (3) the weapons of the U.S., the North Vietnamese, and the Viet Cong, (4) each sides efforts to gain the support of the villages, (5) the air war, (5) the anti-war movement in America, (6) the lives of American troops in the field, and (7) the experiences of American prisoners of war.

Many Americans who lived through it are likely to be highly critical about things that were done or not done during the war.  They may be dissatisfied with this Canadian-produced series, which, to a great extent, avoids taking sides, between South and North Vietnam, between military and civilian officials, or between hawks and doves.  Reviewers have expressed vastly different views, one characterized this series as government propaganda, another commented that it demonstrates Washingtons systematic blundering and inefficiency, and another, who identified himself as a Vietnam veteran, described it as the finest and most complete history of the Vietnam War I have ever seen.

In the final program, Vietnam Recalled, a wide cross section of diplomats, military officers, politicians, and soldiers provide a wide range of assessments of Americas Vietnam policies.  Among them are Ellsworth Bunker, Clark Clifford, William Colby, William Fulbright, Robert Komer, Melvin Laird, Henry Cabot Lodge, Eugene McCarthy, Dean Rusk, Arthur Schlesinger, Maxwell Taylor, and William Westmoreland.  There is no equivalent commentary from the other side.  In any case, throughout the war, there seems to have been little divergence of policy views among North Vietnamese leaders.  With regard to Vietnamese memories of the war, it is perhaps sufficient to note that roughly 5 per cent of Vietnams people died during the conflict.

The Ten Thousand Day War cannot be considered a definitive history of the conflict.  The Vietnamese were involved in fighting for even more than ten thousand days.  Guerrilla action against the French actually began before 1940, and was followed by operations against the Japanese during World War II.  After 1975, Vietnam was engaged in combat against Cambodia and China.  The series neglects much of the diplomacy behind the war, the backgrounds of South Vietnamese leaders, and the course of South Vietnamese political developments.  Moreover, like many documentary films, it is largely guided by the availability of motion picture images.  Thus, combat operationsof which there is much film footagetend to receive more attention than diplomatic and military policy decisions (e.g., McNamaras change of heart, government misperceptions and misrepresentations, peace negotiations, etc.), which took place away from the cameras.

Maclear also wrote a companion volume,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ten-Thousand-Day-War-Vietnam-1945-1975/dp/0380609703/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ten Thousand Day War: Vietnam: 1945-1975</a>&nbsp;(1981), which provides much additional information.",1472256000,5,5716,5.582175925925926
1084613,5,6305873461,"Vietnam, The Ten Thousand Day War is the definitive work on the war. This presentation is exhaustive as to the general historical events of the conflict with an emphasis on the social and political aspects of the action. If you are looking for a treatment that is more detailed in the area of tactics and strategy this work may leave you somewhat unsatisfied. If a more military centered treatment of the conflict is looked for I recommend the program ""Battlefield: Vietnam!"" Another drawback to this treatment of Vietnam is the slight bias I detected to the side of the ""anti war"" sentiment. I attribute this to the fact that this program was produced fairly soon after the end of the war. Perhaps the French admonition that no history should be written until at least 50 years after the the event in question should have been heeded. All in all this is the most exhaustive work on the sociopolitical aspect of Vietnam.",1471910400,,920,4.720496894409938

1084769,5,6305873461,"This is a great series and the DVDs I got are very high quality. I had forgotten just how good this series is as a review of the war from all perspectives. You could watch it a dozen times and learn or realize something new...for those who think they understand that war, or what went wrong, the only thing better would be to read the Pentagon papers (which are the official governmental analysis of our involvement up until about 1970...).

I said ""Overview"" and it is that but it's not a light overview it drills deep on the important things, which are NOT combat for the most part, though key operations are well covered. TV being a visual medium that's what the coverage of the time was all about,combat;  this remedies that by giving footage of participants talking afterwards, and of diplomats and presidential staffers and political activists all reflecting upon the events, decisions, motivations, choices...

Especially helpful for Americans is the way in which it tells the motivations and actions of the North, and of people who fought and then reflected upon it.",1422835200,6,1074,4.826086956521739

1084772,5,6305873461,"If I were still teaching high school, this work would be the one I would insist on using for my students to understand the complexity of the ""Vietnam War"" (actually, the Second Indochina War) for the United States -- and especially for those of us who came of age during the Vietnam War. I graduated from high school in Newark, New Jersey, Class of 1964. Our high school graduating class was fated to be the main class to ""serve"", live or die for the ""Vietnam War."" My luck gave me a college scholarship and the time to study the war (and become an anti-war activist and organizer), while most of my Boy Scout and high school buddies (including my best friend, who died during his Marine Cops service) had to go into ""the service.""

I took those of us who organized in opposition to the war (as I began to do in 1966) years to learn the information now summarized powerfully in ""Vietnam -- the Ten Thousand Day War."" We worked forward towards the truth, inch by inch, against the propaganda that soaked most working class towns (and ""boys"") in the USA during the 1950s and early 1960s. One of the reasons why it was possible for America's political leadership to force a half million of us into the war was the Draft. And so a triumph of our movement against the war was that we ended the draft and stopped the government from getting an unlimited supply of cannon fodder for the presidents' next misplaced adventures into other peoples and countries.

Sadly the lessons taught here in ""Vietnam -- the Ten Thousand Day War"" were not learned during the years of brainwashing by the cultural icons of the American ruling class. And so, as a result, by the time things got to their worst in both Iraq and Afghanistan, we had to listen to the same old silly nonsense about ""pacification"" and ""counter insurgency"" that we remembered being rebuked by the late 1960s in Vietnam (and the rest of ""Indochina""), One additional irony today, in 2015, is that the Obama administration (a different kind of ""Chicken Hawk"" from the administration of  George W. Bush, but no less odious -- and I knew Barack Obama personally before he became an international super star and the ""winner"" of one of the most dubious Nobel Peace Prizes) now has to decide whether to prosecute on of the biggest hucksters of their generation -- General David Petraeus.

It's fitting, and that celebrity general should be held accountable for his crimes, but there is a bigger irony.  Petraeus pushed the bankrupt policy and notions of ""counter insurgency"" that had been discredited by the time of the American escalation in Vietnam -- as a result of the failure of the French versions of the same nonsense between 1947 and Dien Bien Phu in 1954. By the time I was organizing soldiers and veterans against the Vietnam War in the late 1960s and later, some of our most prized possessions were books by Barnard Fall (Street Without Joy and Hell in a Very Small Place) that shared for us (and, it turned out, some of the better minds in the American parts of Vietnam) the fact -- FACT, it has to be shouted -- that ""counter insurgency"" is bulls***.

I was particularly moved by many of the men who appear in ""Vietnam -- the Ten Thousand Day War,"" but treasure most perhaps two: Frank Snepp and Bernard Fall. Snepp's moving narrative of the final betrayals of the USA towards those ""South Vietnamese"" who had been on our side for so long is a priceless addition to our understanding of the disgraces we force on the people who subject to our imperialist experiments. One of the books in my library is the book Snepp wrote about his work for the CIA and these betrayals -- a book for which he was prosecuted and silenced by the government of the United States. A government that was later to turn the con man Petraeus into a tin pot celebrity.

Bernard Fall, as everyone who took the war seriously knows, provided us with all the journalistic reporting we needed to know that the American adventure in Vietnam would end badly. But while some of the wisest minds who studied the war read and reread Street Without Joy and Hell in a Very Small Place, the lessons have again been lost, buried under the nonsense of propaganda that began with cowards like Sylvester Stallone and which continue to this day to sophists like Barack Obama.

Another powerful part of the story is the emergence of the anti-war veterans' movement. The narrative of those vets, with whom i worked for years (though I was not a vet, being the first CO out of the Elizabeth New Jersey draft board) is important not only because it shows the sinews of a movement, but also because it doesn't show what later became the hagiography of VVAW -- the John Kerry version of our movements. While Kerry provided some help to the vets movement, it was the ""rank and file"" who built and sustained it, all the way through, while Kerry got himself into too many headlines as he plotted his course into his future. And of course the vets who speak most powerfully to the story are the injured vets who thread their way through Vietnam the Ten Thousand Day War. The accounting from the Bronx VA hospital gave me flashbacks because we were among those who helped publicize those atrocities. It was a warning to all of the soldiers America sends off to come back in a body bag marked ""parts missing"" (as was the end of my best high school friend) or come back alive but in parts. Once their ""service"" is over, at some point in the future some comfortable Ronald Reagans will begin to cut back on the promised programs, medical and otherwise, that the vets need for the rest of their lives. It's happened after every way this country has fought, and is happening again today as the VA scandals during the Obama administration show.

Each episode of ""Vietnam -- the Ten Thousand Day War"" is a carefully crafted book worthy of our study. Sadly, I'm not teaching high school any longer, but I will be sharing this work with my own sons, and with anyone who asked me, as some still do, ""What did you do during the war, Daddy."" Well, I worked for six years against it. And this DVD will help you understand why.",1421539200,2,6116,4.562841530054645

I spent 21 days in Vietnam with my children, who did not understand why the Vietnamese people would be involved in a war, or did they realise that while being in this country why such a focus was placed on the tourists in terms of the war. Visiting the Chu Chi Tunnels, traveling down the Mecon Delta and visiting the War Museums throughout the country, they could not believe there was a war. It was not until sitting down with my children on return from vacation and watching this video series that they realised what a devastating impact the war had on these people, and how well they have rebuild their country and moved on from their traumatic memories. (But not forgoten past.)
It was a real eye opener and a great political and history lesson

The new DVD reissue of Vietnam: The Ten Thousand Day War is great news for history lovers everywhere. This was probably the first documentary I saw that captured my interest when I was young and it surely remains one of the finest documentaries ever produced on any subject. If you love American history and documentaries, this DVD set is a must-have for your collection. The entire story of America's longest, bleakest, and most unnecessary war is covered in great detail, with informative interviews from General Westmoreland and other key figures from both sides of the conflict and a wealth of raw film footage taken straight from the battlefields and elsewhere.

The film explains that President Kennedy was eager to aid South Vietnam in their fight for independence from the North, but firmly believed it was THEIR war that must be fought and won ultimately by their own efforts. By early 1965, President Johnson made the decision to send American troops into battle to fight alongside South Vietnam, a fateful move that resulted in over fifty thousand American lives lost, not to mention the lives of millions of asians. By 1968, Washington was literally clueless as to how to win the war against a determined North Vietnam. Violent war protests broke out across a deeply divided America outraged over the mounting death toll of American soldiers. Realizing his handling of the war had turned much of the country against him, Johnson wisely decided to leave the presidency at the end of his term, leaving the war in the hands of President Nixon in 1969. Despite Nixon's noble efforts to win the war while gradually bringing troops home, he also expanded the war in the early 70's into Cambodia, and America's involvement in the war would last another four years as opposition and protests continued throughout the country. Finally in 1973, a peace treaty was signed and American troops were finally sent home after eight years of endless fighting in which far too many American men died for so little. In 1975, North Vietnam finally conquered the south which brought the long and bleak war to a sad end.

Written by CNN correspondent Peter Arnett, the 26 episodes of Vietnam: The Ten Thousand Day War {spread out over four discs in this new set} cover the entire course of the war without the blinding conservative/liberal bias that saturates mainstream news media in 21st century America. I agree with others that the rich, mellow voice of Richard Basehart is highly effective and helps make this documentary the masterpiece it is. His engaging narration draws you in and hold your attention throughout. Vast, comprehensive, absorbing, and educational, this is first-rate documentary filmmaking at its best.

1084955,5,6305873461,"""Vietnam: The Ten Thousand Day War""  is a documentary series first aired in 1981.

Writer and former CNN correspondent Peter Arnett's script mixes military, political, and intelligence testimony from key historical figures, straightforwardly with journalistic balance, using proprietary footage, much of it from North Vietnamese sources.

Rather than lay blame at the feet of the French, or Kennedy, Johnson, or Nixon, the film illustrates how the war's progress and escalation were never clear-cut, but tragically led to thousands of deaths and laid waste to the country of Vietnam.",1365552000,10,921,5.50354609929078

1084979,3,6305873461,"This documentary is a fatally flawed treasure.  It is a treasure for the amount of documentary footage so rarely seen, giving the viewer a visceral feeling for the main characters involved in this multi-decade tragedy.  (Note: the complete DVD set is available from Time-Life for a little over forty dollars!)  It is fatally flawed on two points.  First: it fails to mention in any meaningful way, let alone explain in full, the January 31st, 1964, ""Pentagon coup"" in Saigon that was the single most key moment in America's plunge to war.  The 3-month old government council - in place after the killings of Diem and JFK, in early and late November 1963, respectively - advocated a cease fire, American troop withdrawal, NLF and North Vietnamese participation in a coalition government, and rescheduling of elections to unify North and South.  On Jan. 31st, 1964, that peace-seeking ruling government council in Saigon was overthrown, with LBJ's approval, by a new set of generals who immediately asked for more U.S. aid and military action.  Through the window of opportunity for peace, LBJ set in motion a full scale bombing and invasion.  Secondly: toward the end of the series, a key Kissinger aide trumpets Nixon's 1972 ""Christmas bombings"" - of Hanoi and Haiphong harbor and everything in the 60-mile corridor between - as bringing North Vietnam to agree on a peace treaty.  That claim is utterly false.  The aide cynically omits to mention the crucial factor: America's withdrawing the 60-some qualifying conditions added by South Vietnam's so-called president, Thieu, to the peace treaty with the North already agreed upon by Kissinger and the North Vietnamese leadership.  Withdrawing those conditions after the bombing, and putting the original peace treaty back on the table, was the key factor leading to the January 1973 Peace Accords.  Bombing the North, not to mention the South, had never been effective in creating peace conditions, and it was equally ineffective in late 1972.  For a fuller explanation of these two points (the fatal flaws), see: Kai Bird, ""The Color of Truth;"" Seymour Hersh, ""The Price of Power;"" and Stefan Schindler, ""America's Indochina Holocaust.""  While not specifically mentioning the two fatal flaws herein described, the best documentary on America's war on Vietnam still remains ""Hearts and Minds"", by Peter Davis.

Included is the French occupation of the country and their re-occupation after WW2, culminating in the dramatic seige of Dien Bien Phu which turned the war on it's axis from a French Imperialist war to an American war against Communism. The Americans fought much of their battles as a set-piece fight against Armies, forgetting the Political War which they eventually lost. This is brought to stark contrast with the 'Vietnamese War', which stressed politics over any battlefield tactics or the consideration of casualities. The many atrocities that are part of civil war and guerilla war are also brought into light as well as the 'Home-Front' in America and the Anti-War movement.

I was VERY glad there was a comprehensive history of the French in Indochina, the Paris peace accords, the U.S. backing of the reneging of the agreements for free elections, the Gulf of Ton kin (1 & 2) and the landing of U.S. Marines at Dah Nang in 1965 as opposed purely to the American involvement. That's the stuff I really enjoy as that's the basis for the U.S. involvement and, this set delivered handsomely.

Richard Basehart's narration is spot on. He has a voice that's engaging along with the right amount of maturity given the subject matter. The episodes are about an hour in length each which is just about right in my opinion.

There are episodes devoted to the stateside sentiment towards the war including the anti-war demonstrations which tore up the USA politically as much as the war tore up US resources and personnel.

1. America in Vietnam
2. Dien Bien Phu
3. Days of decision

7. Tet!
8. Front line America

10. The Village War.
11. Peace

I'm not sure how this set got to be so expensive. Other than the price it's very well worth owning as you can go back to it time and again.

Seek out other sources for this set as it's just not worth the asking prices I see here.

1084986,3,6305873461,"First on the DVD itself. The prices going around for DVD copies of this 1980 CBC TV series are patently outrageous. The amazon Uk site has it going for 429 pounds! However desperate you may be to obtain a copy for nostalgia's sake or because you think the series is excellent don't pay close to a thousand dollars for 80cents worth of plastic especially when you consider the DVD print run for this item finished years ago. As a result you are either buying a used DVD copy or someone has copied a VHS copy to DVD and put it on DVD-R disks. That sounds like a breach of copyright to me. I saw one advertisement along those very lines. Six disks (DVD-R)in plastic jackets and no art work.

On the series itself, it was a thirteen episode mini-series with each episode 45minutes - pretty standard for commercial TV with 15minutes or so for ads in an hour time slot. You do the math but 13 X 45 minutes doesn't add up to 16hrs (another sale promotion for a DVD copy of this series quoted that time - bogus). It's actually 9.75 hours total viewing time.

I watched the series with interest back in the eighties when it was screened here in Australia and had since forgotten about it. Curious to see if it was available on DVD I came here to Amazon and saw one seller trying to flog a used copy for nearly a thousand dollars last year. Give me a break. I kept an eye open however and low and behold 1 new copy came up for around 50 bucks which I promptly bought that very second. Now I'm not sure my 3 disk set is bone fide. It carries the logo of the History channel and ""Image entertainment"" but suspiciously doesn't have much in the way of copyright or distributor information. It does come in a printed jewel case with the three disks also printed. The picture quality is pretty good but it still looks very much like a VHS to DVD transfer as well. Nonetheless its very watchable with no flaws I noticed.

As for the content and quality of the series? Its a good overall summation and reasonably objective. The book is some 492 pages in total (I have it in paperback) and a fascinating read. I guess you can only do so much on film. Considering the book and film came just a few years after the end of hostilities it was pleasing to see a relatively non-partisan flag waving exercise. Everybody's got their own opinion - I have mine. The sequences I found most fascinating were in the second last episode. Various pentagon, state department, white house and other officials as well as US ambassadors, senators and so forth are (obviously) asked were they thought everything went wrong for the US - why did the US ""lose"" the war?  The military types blamed the politicians, the politicians blamed the military and other commentators just rambled on with non specific generalizations and hyperbolous remaks.

Well for me everyone lost the Vietnam war because the whole sorry saga was a missed opportunity. As Maclears book states on page one, chapter one ""The first Reversal"", the US was looking to set up an intelligence network through south east Asia after WWII and one Archimedes Patti of the OSS was running the show on the ground. He met Ho Chi Minh in April 1945. The US had helped Minh during the war procuring his release from the Nationalist chinese govenement after Minh was arrested for being a communist - though his upbringing was as a nationalist like his father. Patti was told by Minh who was an admirer of the US (believe it or not) that he was not asking anything from the US but hoped his independence movement might establish a relationship with the US. ""We want Americas moral support. We ask for nothing else"".

Right there and then the Vietnam war may well have been prevented.",1276214400,4,3698,4.495535714285714

Basehart's sonorous, melancholy-tinged narration captures the grim disillusionment that came to characterize the Vietnam debacle. There is a palable sense of deep-seated weariness in Basehart's voice that parallels the weariness of the soliders featured throughout the documentary.

The viewer comes away from each installment of ""The Ten-thousand Day War"" with an eerie discomfort that so many died for so little. Had anyone but Basehart narrated the film, the profound tragedy of the whole Vietnam-experience would have been shamelessly lost on those of us who remember that dark period in history AND for those who weren't born but are interested in learning about that ""dark period.""

1085019,5,6305873461,"UPDATE ON WHERE TO VIEW THIS SERIES

FYI It has been posted on (...) in it's typically user posted low resolution but it is watchable and
better then watching it full of TV commercials per episode. IMHO. This series is really hard to find even
a copied set, but if you Google it you will find sets for (...).

This is one of best war documentaries ever made (I place it tied or at least close to ""The World At War""). I would seriously think of purchasing it because it's being shown in chopped up episodes full of commercials on TV now. Why do I think it's so good? It was made just 5 years after the end of the American involvement so all the major characters were still alive to be interviewed. The Vietnam War was the most filmed war ever to that time so the documentary is able to take advantage of all the film (mostly in color). Lastly, Richard Basehart's narrative voice is as distinguished as James Earl Jones. I never perceived a bias politically on the series, (I lean heavily to the right on foreign affairs), and I think although the war was a tactical loss, it helped win the cold war so it was a strategic win (the east could not provide the basic necessities of life while competing with the west's war machine output). Still, just reading now that Peter Arnett wrote this series makes me pause, but if any war deserved Peter Arnett's input I guess this one would. Maybe it's not being re-released because Arnett has ""jumped the shark"" and has been totally discredited as an objective journalist. It's a shame because there isn't anything on the Vietnam War that comes close to this series quality and historical reference. To all you American (and Allied) Vietnam Vets, God Bless You Brothers and Sisters, I salute you!",1146873600,11,1735,4.522292993630574
1085020,4,6305873461,"This is one of the most thorough, comprehensive video treatments of the long Vietnam War.  The series begins with an overview of the set, which is helpful to those unfamiliar with the conflict.  The next 11 chapters cover the post-World War II French occupation and the fall of Dien Bien Phu through the 1975 fall of Saigon (i.e., 30 years, or 10,000 days).  Along the way, we see video footage from both sides of the Ho Chi Minh trail, the firepower used by both sides, the effects of the war on the American public, and the sad evacuation of Saigon. This is followed by a video giving the perspective of soldiers who fought in the war.

The set includes an impressive number of interviews from important actors like US Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker, Gen. William Westmoreland, South Vietnamese Presidents Thieu and Ky, North Vietnamese officials, many anti-war activists, and ordinary soldiers.  The 13 chapters (on five tapes, at least in my Discovery channel version) provide a thorough overview of the conflict. The footage is often rare and always riveting.  Richard Basehart narrates with the right amount of authority.

This is probably the most balanced of the video series out there, although that may be damning it with faint praise.  The reason I deducted a star from what otherwise would be a five-star series is that like many discussions of this conflict, it is framed by the point of view that the Vietnam war was essentially a nationalistic struggle against imperialism and the North Vietnamese simply had more ""will to fight.""  In this telling, the American government and the South Vietnamese (including ARVN) seem to be in a race to the bottom as to who would give up first.

What is not emphasized here is the enormous support given the North Vietnamese by the Soviets -- the only Russian we see is Kosygin, at Ho's funeral.  We are not shown the many who fled south as Ho took power; the tens of thousands who crossed over from the Viet Cong to support the South Vietnamese government; and the horror inflicted on villagers who resisted attempts to force them to work for the North Vietnamese side.  No footage is shown of the ""re-education camps,"" where hundreds of thousands were sent, nor of the ""boat people"" who fled for their lives, even though this series was made in 1980, when these events were already known.  The series does not adequately cover the difference in strategy and tactics when Westmoreland was replaced by Creighton Abrams or point out that the new strategy was actually working.  This series was tailored to support a certain point of view.

Nevertheless, if balanced by books like ""A Better War,"" by Lewis Sorley, this is an indispensable addition to anyone's  collection of Vietnam War studies.",1133913600,13,2741,4.862365591397849

The folks at Image Entertainment own the rights to this series and have told me they have no plans to re-release it. If you want it re-released find their web-page (just put Image Entertainment in your search engine) and email them and let them hear from you!

1085022,4,6305873461,"I disagree with John Carlson:

Has he seen the episode on the Ho Chi Minh trail?

It basically glorifies the North Vietnam army and people and shows shortcomings of our military strategy (the US).  The other episodes often times give left-leaning opinions on the war.

Arthur Schlesinger for instance doesn't disagree with the war, but castigates Gen. Westmoreland for his leadership in it.

At 36 in 2004, I generally have a middle-of-the-road point of view on Vietnam and was tempted to turn the channel when viewing that above episode and some others because I was ashamed and angered to be shown that we didn't have the upper hand in many respects of that war.

Also Peter Arnett, who had a major role in the production of this film is an established Anti-war journalist most recently being fired by CNN...etc.

So how can you conclude that this program is slanted toward the right?

All in all, I think this series is teriffic and is a wealth of knowledge into that era for people seeking to learn more.

Very unbalanced point of view, December 12, 2001
 Reviewer: Larry T Stone from St. Petersburg, Fl United States
This documentary is overwhelmingly pro-war, anti-Vietnamese. It essentially demonizes the Vietnamese who fought for their country and totally disregards the fact that the US attempting to force its will on them led to the deaths of 3 million Asians.
He wrote ""the Vietnamese who fought for their country""
This idiot thinks that North and South Vietnam fought together
for their country, the North and South fought against each other
not together as one. North Vietnam was communist and South Vietnam was not, North Vietnam attacked South Vietnam to make it communist, South Vietnam fought against becoming communist.
He wrote: ""totally disregards the fact that the US attempting to force its will on them led to the deaths of 3 million Asians.""
Obviously mis-informed again, who is ""them"" that you write?
North Vietnam or South or both?
the U.S didn't force it's will on ""them"" We fought ""with"" South Vietnam to stop the North. North Vietnam created the situation and events that led to the deaths of Vietnamese by invading South Vietnam
Our role there was very politcally movtivated, we wanted to stop the spread of communism. A bad political decision imho.
