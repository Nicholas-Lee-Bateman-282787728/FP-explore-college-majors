8423846,4,B004CYF7LW,"I downloaded this because of Engelbert Humperdinck's appearance.  True to form, he did perform his song, but the interview unfortunately was cut out.  Of course, Johnny Carson is so funny and entertaining, that you can't be disappointed, but it was all about Engelbert really for me.  I thought these shows would be full length, but not so for this particular one.",1344556800,,364,4.934426229508197
8423847,5,B004CYF7LW,"I just love Johnny Carson and his shows
are just wonderful.  Great DVD! Highly
recommend this DVD! His monolog's are
so funny and his guest stars are just
so talented and hilarious to watch at
times.  Especially love this DVD!",1315353600,,226,4.625
