4064967,5,B0033CBAPQ,"While PowerFit has been out for a couple of years now, I just discovered them this year.  I like them so well that I have acquired all three series!  Each series has it's own value, whether it's more variety or the way the workouts are split up.  I like the variety I guess.

PowerFit Plus is the most compact version of the three. It only consists of two 20 minute workouts, Total Express which hits the entire body in 20 minutes, or Cardio Kick which is all cardio.  I like the cardio workout, it includes some kickboxing moves that I enjoy and aren't in the other cardio workouts.  Many of the moves in the strength workout are similar to the other PowerFit workouts, they are just arranged in a different order and in a way that the entire body is covered.  A lot of multiple muscle groups are worked at once, making the most of your 20 minutes as Stephanie often says.

While I wouldn't call any of these series advanced, Plus is probably the most advanced of the three.  Harmony being the easiest and the original somewhere in the middle.  I would rate all three series anywhere from beginner to intermediate, which options to up the intensity if you choose.  Using a step for some of the cardio segments, or using dumbells in place of the bands.

I find that I will use the step for the cardio workouts, but I use the band for the strength workouts.  I like using this series as intended.  I was a dumbell user for many years, I still enjoy using them but I am enjoying incorporating different types of workouts into my routine and using different tools, such as bands, stability or weighted balls and kettlebells.  The variety helps me from getting bored.

All PowerFit workouts would be great for travel, but this one especially due to it's compactness.  All you need is one band and two DVDs!  I don't travel much but if I did I would definitely take these along.

Stephanie Huckabee leads these as well as the other PowerFits.  She is best known for her days with The Firm.  Those familiar with the Firm will recognize some of the phrases she uses right away.  Others not familiar need not despair, the moves are pretty easy to pick up on, even if it takes a few times.

Overall, I highly recommend this series or any of the PowerFit workouts. 5 stars...",1355616000,3,2265,4.457420924574209
4064968,5,B0033CBAPQ,"I have had my eye on the PowerFit workouts for some time but never took the plunge on them until this past year.  I am very glad I did.  Years ago, I likely may have dismissed these workouts because they were too short or too easy, well not anymore...

PowerFit was created and led by Stephanie Huckabee, who is famous from her days at The Firm and is one of my all time favorite Firm instructors.  She created this series after her schedule became busy due to motherhood, etc.  These workouts are around 20 minutes each, which is easy enough to fit into most busy schedules.  They also require little equipment using only a resistance band which is also convenient for many.  Not having the chore of dragging out a bunch of dumbells etc is nice at times.  These workouts would also be great for travel, the case of DVDs and the band is all you need!

This series is divided into 5 workouts, Cardio, Core Fusion, Legs and Shoulders, Chest Triceps and Butt, and finally Back Biceps and Thighs.  Again they are each around 20 minutes including warm up and cooldown.  However, no time is wasted here, Stephanie gets down to business right away and makes the most of your time.  All of the strength workouts contain some ab work as well, which I like.  Even though there is a separate workout that focuses on the core, extra ab work certainly doesn't hurt me!

While these are considered beginner-intermediate level, they can easily be modified up if you choose.  For some of the cardio the band is used on the floor as an imaginery step, I will use my step instead and it bumps up the intensity nicely.  For some of the strength moves, dumbells could easily be substituted for the bands.  Stephanie does keep it moving though, so be sure to have your band ready or the remote handy if you need to pause the workout.

The program comes with a meal plan, while I haven't followed it myself it appears to be a very doable program which includes a lot of healthy choices.  Lots of carbs and protein are included which is helpful as energy.

I am so pleased that I came to my senses and ordered these workouts, so much so that I have acquired PowerFit Harmony and PowerFit Plus as well. I use all three programs, I enjoy the variety and the workouts are short enough that you could easily do more than one at a time if time permits.

I only have one minor complaint regarding the series, each 20 minute program is on one DVD.  To conserve space I think putting more than one workout onto a DVD would have made more sense, but that's just a minor quibble.

I give this series 5 stars.  One of my best purchases of 2012 by far!",1355011200,9,2617,4.392931392931393
4064969,5,B0033CBAPQ,"I have all the Powerfit DVDs....and this one is my favorite.  It has the best music, and it is easy to remember what workouts you have done because the discs and DVDs are color coded.  I mix and match all the series, and they all work well together.  If you can only buy one in the series though, this one is a have-to-have!!  Can do just one DVD or add more for a long 40 or 60 minute total body workout. All 20 minute discs have an ab workout included, which is super! Results are fast, even if you only do 20 minutes.  Can use resistance band included, which is purple medium resistance, or can buy your own to substitute. I have used the resistance cords with handles, too.",1342137600,5,677,4.217054263565892
4064970,2,B0033CBAPQ,"I think that this might be good for someone new to exercise.  I have execercised my whole life and although I am middle aged now, I still find it far too easy.  I really wanted to like it since I like Stephanie's style.  Get this one if you're a beginner, you'll love it.",1328313600,2,271,4.0754716981132075
4064971,4,B0033CBAPQ,"I ordered this set when it premiered. The DVD's sat until Dec 2009 when I decided to get serious about fitness. There is no wasted time in these workouts. It will take you a few times doing them to get the moves down. I was a fan of Stephanie's when she was with The Firm. These workouts are more ""do-able"", the level of difficulty is brisk..but not impossible to get through. The one thing I will say is these should have been rated as Intermediate. Beginners that have been sedentary would have a difficult time with the speed of this workout...and Stephanie doesn't explain any of the moves, so you need to have some experience in order to do these workouts successfully. These workouts are great for people who have limited time.",1324944000,6,733,4.5606060606060606
4064972,5,B0033CBAPQ,"--at least to me! This is because each workout is different from the previous or next one. This is to help create muscle confusion, which has helped me tone up nicely, especially in my calves. My arms have not toned up with this workout system, however, nearly as well as my calves, but I do not use the most resistant band. I use the medium band. To really tone my arms, I use a kettle bell workout that I also love, by Gin Miller. It is broken up iinto 3 segments on one DVD. This multi-disc workout is broken up into many workouts on separate DVDs. They're my favorites at this time (I have dozens of DVD workouts that I love). I am 58, and they keep my body looking at least 20 years younger.",1315785600,2,696,4.162962962962963
4064973,4,B0033CBAPQ,"Stephanie really works the whole body in such a short time. Each workout is only 20 minutes long but you will feel that every muscle in your body has been worked thoroughly. I noticed that my muscles were much firmer in a matter of 3 weeks.

Stephanie said that she created the power fit series because she only had 20 minutes to spare each day to exercise because she was raising a family and working full time. Therefore, this program works dual muscles with one procedure like a over head press, which will work on the shoulders, forearm and the upper back in a few minutes.

That is why with this program you can work your whole body in 20 short minutes or combine both workouts to have a longer 40 minute workout, which leaves me a bit out of breath and I workout 4 to 5 days a week 40 minutes a day. I usually work out with Chris Freytag and I started using Stephanie power fit series for variety. I enjoy the results I have experienced.

The Cardio kick workout is a light to medium kick boxing segment revved up with fast music to get your heart pumping. Also it has a lot of floor work that can be done on a step to add to the intensity. I enjoy this workout the most. The toning segment is done with a stretch band so its easy to control your intensity. On the days that my energy level is low, I barely move the band and on days when I feel extreme I fully press the band. The stretch band allows me to be in control at all times not so with free weights.",1313884800,5,1466,4.136842105263158
4064974,5,B0033CBAPQ,"I have the 10 dvd set also and I love these workouts. They are great when you are short on time, and the bands really help. I have definitely felt a good workout in my arms, back, and quads. I like Stephanie as an instructor, steps are all easy to follow, with good instruction.",1290902400,5,278,4.166666666666667
4064975,5,B0033CBAPQ,"I originally purchased this set for my daughter to get her started exercising.  It comes with a resistance band and only required 20 minutes of time.  The amount of time makes for an easy committment.  Well, I also purchased the series for myself so I would be able to share the expereince with my daughter.  I did not expect to like it as much as I did as I am a more advanced exerciser.  However, I have immensely enjoyed the workout.  The moves are not overly complicated and Stephanie cues well.  A little samba here and there but over all straight forward.  The 5 disc set ( 1 disc each day for 5 days)does not waste a lot of time getting started nor are the introductions to the fellow exercisers at all long.  She is quick and moves on to the next routine without wasting your time.  I have Jillian Michaels 30 Day Shred, but can't stand the slow talking and the slow introductions and the slow getting to the exercise and the slow constant yapping...it bores me to tears.  Stephanie is a joy to work with and therefore I actualy look forward to the workout!",1282176000,15,1065,4.38265306122449
4064996,5,B0033CBAPQ,Really like these workouts for when I'm short on time or feeling low energy.,1411344000,2,76,4.5
4064997,5,B0033CBAPQ,Love the fact that in 20 minutes I feel like I worked out.  Having 5 different work outs keeps  me from getting bored.,1399593600,3,118,4.086956521739131
4064998,5,B0033CBAPQ,She is very easy to follow calling with. A good workout every time. Bands provide a good stretch. This is the second DVD of hers I've bought.,1395532800,3,141,4.2592592592592595
4064999,3,B0033CBAPQ,"Total Express is a fine short strength training workout if you need to get a little exercise in for the day, but it really doesn't spend enough time in any one exercise long enough to feel any worth while results. Maybe if your new to strength training and you want something fast and unintimidating, but anyone who uses this video more than once a every two weeks will grow out of it quickly.

Cardio Kick, again, great if you need a little movement in for the day, but it's painfully easy and the amount of time spent on one series of exercises is enough to put one to sleep.

Overall not a bad DVD for what it claims, it's about getting the most you can out of 20 minutes. One really needs to spend at least 35 minutes (that includes warm up and cool down) in order to get any real benefit. If however, you have a busy day it's better than nothing.",1394323200,,851,4.214723926380368
4065000,4,B0033CBAPQ,"Love her workouts!  Most of her vids are good, especially for beginners.  Her queuing is good, and she is very motivating.",1374364800,2,122,4.761904761904762
4065001,5,B0033CBAPQ,"Stephanie Huckabee is a former FIRM gal who does a great job with these DVDs.  I especially like these routines because at 57 my joints aren't quite as limber as they used to be. These are low impact exercises, very good, but low impact. I usually do two 20 minute routines. I mix Stephanie's workouts with FIRM workouts plus the stairstepper. If you are a PX90 type person, you won't like these but if you are looking for low impact workouts these are great!",1366588800,6,459,4.464285714285714
4065002,5,B0033CBAPQ,It gets the job done. You can work as hard as you feel like it when using bands. It will build strength.,1365465600,2,104,3.772727272727273
4065003,5,B0033CBAPQ,So far I've only used 2 DVDs out of this set but I'm really enjoying it.  Each DVD is geared towards a particular body part.  That way you can use these daily (imho) because you're using different muscle groups with each DVD.,1362960000,2,225,4.333333333333333
4065004,5,B0033CBAPQ,I have only used for two weeks but it's a great workout for 20 minutes. I actually work up a little sweat and feel like I am getting a good workout. If you only have 20 minutes I recommend this.,1362355200,4,194,3.875
4065005,5,B0033CBAPQ,This two DVD Set is a very good workout for 20 minutes.  You will sweat.  I received a powercord instead of a resistance band; however you can pick up a three pack of resistances bands anywhere.,1360368000,,194,4.361111111111111
8387912,1,B0033CBAPQ,Didnt come with band even though it shows one in the picture. Really misleading and disappointing,1505779200,,97,5.125
8387913,5,B0033CBAPQ,"Great workout series. 20 minute workouts fit into a busy schedule. The resident bands add muscle toning. Stephanie is good instructor. Following her is fun and easy. I enjoy these low impact, time saving workouts!",1501372800,,213,5.114285714285714

8387915,1,B0033CBAPQ,"BIG disappointment.  I am an active 70-year-old, and work out at home using DVDs.  I am on a constant quest to seek different programs to vary my workout and be challenged so I ordered this set thinking I would be able to pick and choose and combine 20 minute workouts.  I loved the way Huckabee provides instructions in the Weight Watchers Time Crunch Training DVD. The Power Fit workouts were little more than warm-ups for me, never raising the cardio intensity to a beneficial level.  Even though there were several cardio workouts distributed over a month's program, I found none of them to be worthwhile.",1475193600,2,609,4.771428571428571
8387916,3,B0033CBAPQ,"I was attracted to the shorter (20-minute) routines in this set; as I'm getting older (late 40s now), I am finding that I generally prefer to mix-n-match workouts, and I will often reach for something short rather than do nothing at all.  I also liked that this series uses a band for the strength work:  I think it's great to challenge the muscles with something other than weights once and awhile.  I was a little hesitant about the instructor, Stephanie Huckabee, who had previously work for The Firm franchise.  I do like some of The Firm workouts, but may of their instructors tend to be rather cookie-cutter, so I wasn't sure what to expect here; more on that below.

Each of the five workouts in this DVD set comes on its own DVD.  This felt completely wasteful for me, especially since each routine is just 20 minutes long.  It is also inconvenient--i.e., if you want to do two routines on the same day, you have to swap out disks.  Each workout has an approximately 3-minute warm-up, and each includes with about 2 minutes of stretching, so the actual workout length is about 15 minutes.  The workouts are VERY choreographed, not in a complex way, but in a way that you are doing a precise set of moves on one side, then a precise set of movements on the other side, with very little variation from workout to workout.

A few specific notes:
CARDIO - I expected to like this workout, as I prefer simple, easy-to-follow cardio routines.  It was that, but it was barely aerobic for me, and I actually found it quite boring.  The only part I enjoyed was the 2-minute standing abs section just prior to the cool-down
CHEST TRICEPS & BUTT - This was the shortest workout at just 18 minutes.  There was VERY little biceps work, but it did include some abs work.  The second half of the routine was entirely on the floor.
BACK BICEPS & THIGHS - This workout was also half standing/half floor, and this time, the biceps are worked from various angles with the band.  This routine also includes some abs work.
LEGS & SHOULDERS - There was a ""power"" segment to this routine that was rather laughable, as it was SO slow!  A good deal of abs work is included.
CORE FUSION - This was the first workout I tried from the set, and it's probably the one I liked the best.  The first half is a blend of crunches and other abs-focused moved, and the second half is stretching.

I generally consider myself pretty solidly intermediate in terms of fitness--I exercise daily and am a yoga instructor, but I don't do much advanced stuff.  I would say that these routines are solidly beginner--perhaps more experienced beginner, but still beginner.  I often find that beginner workouts are still useful for me, as I can use them on lighter days, and I can usually modify up.  I just don't think that's going to be the case with this set, in part because after doing all the workouts once, I have absolute no desire to do them again.  Stephanie's personality is definitely a factor in this.  Although she is a good instructor who cues well, I just did not click at all with her style, which involved MANY repetitions of pat phrases such as ""you can do this; I know you can.""  After the 10th time, it just starts to sound stale, and that's how I felt about this set overall.",1474934400,,3257,4.5
8387917,5,B0033CBAPQ,"I've been exercising for my entire adult life. I'm now 60 and needed something a bit different from The Firm videos I've used over the years. Stephanie Huckabee's Power Fit was a pleasant surprise. I appreciate her clear and precise instructions and her positive encouragement.  The pace is still energetic and the moves, while familiar, have a different flair to them. I highly recommend this series for those who enjoy exercising, but simply need a less intensive, but still effective workout.",1468368000,2,495,5.111111111111111

I will use Zumba step when I get home, which takes more time, but this is one of the best 20 minute workout I have ever used and us great for the morning. Stephanie had another set she created after this one, but I just didn't like it as much. I went on Amazon one day and decided to see if I could find this one again and I did.
