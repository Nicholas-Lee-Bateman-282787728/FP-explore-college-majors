3916656,4,B002EBRFAQ,"Excellent film from German director Christian Petzold, whose portrayal of incomplete lives raises issues about identity and the tyranny of economic systems - not surprisingly set in the former East Germany, where the introduction of capitalism has seemingly created a social void where personal freedom is elusive if not beyond reach. This is maybe over-intellectualizing a fairly straightforward story about a love triangle, but then after listening to Petzold describe his own analysis in the DVD's making-of documentary, abstractions like this seem somehow to take on a life of their own.

His characters - a soldier returning from Afghanistan, a Turkish immigrant, and his German wife - are pretty much all at loose ends. They often show little emotion and keep their intentions well hidden. Their conversations are either shallow, lacking subtext, or they are portentous with potential meaning. The discontinuity generates a level of suspense that keeps you wondering what is really going on. Sparks of passion suddenly burst forth with intensity and are as quickly snuffed out. How much each trusts the other is often unclear. Who is lying? Who is cheating? Can any of them really feel love?

While harking often to ""The Postman Always Rings Twice,"" the points of similarity turn out often to be red herrings. Trusting a film-noir sensibility, we jump to conclusions that turn out to be premature. Each of the characters has traits that elicit sympathy, while behaving in ways that make us dislike them. At the end of it all, one is left with a hollow sense that the debts that accumulate over a lifetime can never be repaid. As a parable about the cost of living, this one has much to provoke thought, with thanks to excellent performances by Benno F&uuml;rmann, Nina Hoss, and Hilmi S&ouml;zer.",1258761600,12,1802,5.08445945945946
3916657,4,B002EBRFAQ,"""Jerichow"" revisits James M. Cain's ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" in a rural and economically stressed area of Germany. Writer/director Christian Petzold seems to have been inspired to some degree by both of the famous film adaptations of Cain's novel, the noir classic ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" (1946) and Italy's unauthorized ""Ossessione"" (1943). But ""Jerichow"" isn't a remake. It's a German update that looks at commercially successful Turkish immigrants and Germans who are inspired to reckless and secretive behavior, perhaps to recapture some optimism at a point in their lives when they realize things haven't gone as planned.

Thomas (Benno Furmann) is back home after serving in the German army in Afghanistan, now in need of a job to begin renovations on the house his recently deceased mother has left him. Ali Ozkan (Hilmi Sozer), who owns 45 snack bars in the area, asks Thomas to make his daily rounds of deliveries for him when his driver's license is suspended for DUI. In spite of his heavy drinking, Ali is an demanding and perceptive businessman. He seems to want Thomas to learn the business, and he encourages Thomas to get to know his pretty German wife Laura (Nina Hoss). But Thomas and Laura see something of themselves in each other and find the attraction irresistible.

This is old territory, but it usually doesn't feel like it. The characters befit their particular time and place. All are criminal in some sense, and all are sympathetic in some sense. We don't get to know Laura well until late in the film, but the uneasy relationship between the two men develops over course of the film. Their mundane conversations create suspense, as the audience gets the creeping impression that things will turn out badly. Both men are enigmatic, frustrated, and hiding something that will have to give at some point. Kudos to Hilmi Sozer for making Ali a fully realized character, perhaps even more tragic than the rest, even though he is not a protagonist. In German with optional English subtitles.

The DVD (Cinema Guild 2009): Bonus features are a theatrical trailer (2 min), trailers from 3 other Christian Petzold films, and a ""Making-of Documentary"" (25 min). This includes interviews with the director in which he discusses the characters and the socio-economic milieu in which the film takes place and interviews with actors Benno Furmann and Nina Hoss, who discuss their characters. Petzold's comments are particularly interesting and thoughtful. Bonus features have English subtitles that cannot be turned off. English subtitles are available for the film, and those can be turned off.",1257465600,18,2627,5.104651162790698

While its predecessor, The Postman Always Rings Twice, is fast, snappy, and full of plot interest, Petzold's genius does not lend itself to the American style of film noir.",1424476800,,360,4.82258064516129

8367450,4,B002EBRFAQ,"""Jerichow"" (2009 release from Germany; 93 min.) brings the story of Thomas, a loner who just recently has returned to his home town of Jerichow in northern Germany after doing a tour of duty in Afghanistan. We learn in the opening scenes that he is in financial trouble, owing money to some shady characters. Through a turn of events, Thomas is hired as a driver for Ali's business of 45 regional snack-bars. Ali moved from Turkey to Germany when he was only 2. Ali is married to beautiful (and younger) Laura, who also helps out in the business. At first, we don't know how Ali and Laura became an (unlikely) couple. As soon as Thomas shows up for work, you can immediately sense the attraction between Thomas and Laura. how did Ali and Laura hook up? Will Thomas and Laura give in to their attraction? To tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, this is another great movie from German writer-director Christian Petzold, who previously brought us such stellar movies as The State I'm In, Gespenster and Yella (and most recently in 2012 brought us the outstanding political drama Barbara). Second, as was the case in Yella (and later in Barbara), Nina Hoss is Petzold's leading lady again, and she does not disappoint. Her (lesser-known) co-stars Benno Frmann (as Thomas) and Hilmi Szer (as Ali) are very good too. Third, there is a sense of doom-and-gloom in the movie that is palpable. At one point when discussing love, Laura exasperates ""you can't love if you don't have money"". The movie reminded me vaguely of The Postman Always Rings Twice, and wouldn't you know, in the DVD bonus materials, there is an interview with Petzold, and he mentions that movie as a clear reference point! There are also interviews with Hoss and Frmann (but strangely, not with Szer).

Bottom line, this is a terrific movie from someone I consider to be one of Europe's leading directors of this generation. I will go see anything Petzold makes. If you are in the mood for a top-notch quality foreign movie that is light years away from your standard Hollywood fare, you cannot go wrong with this. ""Jerichow"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1396310400,3,2225,4.746770025839793
8367451,5,B002EBRFAQ,"... has already BEEN said here, and very eloquently. I simply LOVED everything about this movie. I came for Benno Furmann (brilliant in lots of stuff but most loved, by me, for The Princess and the Warrior) then fell in love with Christian Petzold, Nina Hoss and Hilmi Szer.

I still want to find that Turkish pop song that Hoss annoyingly shut off with a slap to the boom box at the beach (featured in the preview). It's been in my head all this time and I really want it on my mp3.",1387584000,3,483,4.193548387096774
8367452,4,B002EBRFAQ,"German screenwriter and director Christian Petzold`s fifth feature film which he wrote, is loosely based on the novel ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" from 1934 by American author and journalist James M. Cain (1892-1977) and was screened at the 33rd Toronto International Film Festival in 2008, In competition at the 65th Venice Film Festival in 2008 and in the German Cinema section at the 59th Berlin International Film Festival in 2009. It was shot on various locations in North-eastern Germany and was produced by producers Bettina Reitz, Andreas Schreitmller, Jochen Klsch, Florian Koerner Von Gustorf and Michael Weber. It tells the story about Thomas, a dishonourably discharged former soldier who has returned to his home in a German village called Jerichow. Thomas has begun renovating his home and is having difficulties finding a job, but after a coincidental encounter with a Turkish businessman named Ali he is offered a job as a driver. Thomas and Ali becomes friends and he is introduced to Ali`s wife Laura, but as the relation between Thomas, Ali and Laura evolves, Thomas and Laura falls in love and begins to make plans for themselves.

Distinctly and finely directed by German filmmaker Christian Petzold, this eloquent love triangle draws an intriguing portrayal of a dangerous liaison between a wealthy businessman`s wife and a lonely former soldier. While notable for its naturalistic milieu depictions and the compelling cinematography by German cinematographer Hans Fromm, this somewhat romantic, at times humerous and character-driven thriller which examines themes like friendship, love, betrayal, crime and capitalism, contains a good score by composer Stefan Will.

This poignantly atmospheric and finely paced fictional tale where a random meeting instigates a string of strange events, is impelled and reinforced by its two merging studies of character, cogent narrative structure and the understated and involving acting performances by German actor Benno Frmann, German actress Nina Hoss and Turkish-German actor Hilmi Szer. A suspensful and existentialistic love-story which gained the German Film Critics Award for Best Film Christian Petzold at the German Film Critics Association Awards in 2009.",1341705600,3,2232,5.523391812865497
8367453,4,B002EBRFAQ,"""Jerickow"" from 2008 is another excellent offering from Christian Petzold (""Yella"" 2007), who is turning out some really thought-provoking films. Strongly reminiscent of luchino Visconti's - ""Ossessione"" 1943, however this was not a remake but an excellent update. Here the story takes place in present-day Germany (in the northeast), and involved three marginal characters: a returning soldier 'Thomas' (Benno Furmann), his Turkish employer 'Ali' (Hilmi Sozer) and his beautiful German wife 'Laura' (Nina Hoss). What stands out the most in ""Jerickow"" is the subdued and quality acting from Benno Furman, Nina Hoss, and Hilmi Sozer. The clichs and stereotypes were eliminated, and real people and their struggle to survive in present-day Germany was being depicted. There is also of course a very big hint at East/West relations, from a German perspective (Germany has the largest population of Turkish and Kurdish immigrants in Europe). Many Germans from the east (the former East Germany), are still coping with an economic and cultural disadvantage, versus their West German counterparts (keep in mind that West Germany as of 2009, has invested some 1.9 trillion U.S. dollars into the East German economy since reunification in 1990 'Die Wende'. But where is this money ending-up?). The Turkish immigrants are no slouches either, many of them are in the food business (restaurants, food-stands, etc.) and have fared very well, creating resentment and xenophobia in the process. Ali's character in this respect, represented the real foreigner from the East (Asia Minor), that is to some degree despised by a minority of Germans (East/West), and by some Europeans in general (but in all fairness, the majority of Germans and Europeans are not xenophobes). 'Ali' for all his shortcomings, revealed the most humanity in the end (I won't give anything away here). But neither 'Thomas' or 'Laura', were racists or bigoted in anyway. They just became opportunistic in their common interest against 'Ali'. An excellent film, that is telling it, like it is! NTSC, German (English subtitles), NR 93 mins.

8367454,5,B002EBRFAQ,"When I first saw this movie in the theatre, I was blown away.  The actors play their parts with cool reserve.  The setting - in the former East Germany - is riveting whether it's the Baltic Coast or the rural inland where much of the action takes place.  Midway through the film it becomes apparent that this is a brilliant adaptation of a classic film noir:  The Postman Rings Twice.  That the love tryst involves an ethnic aspect is a new twist, and the placement of the Turk in the position of the shop owner and relatively successful, but ruthless businessman and the subordination of the two native Germans who form the illicit affair that leads ultimately to tragedy makes this film even more endearing.

8367455,5,B002EBRFAQ,"How's that for an odd tag?  This movie stays with me and continues to grow on me.  I will absolutely see it again, and maybe again.  It's a love/sex triangle in the key of darkness and James M. Cain's Postman Always Rings Twice.  Each of the three main characters has a dark and brooding story and in the show-don't tell of good film making, we lose ourselves in these stories.  For example:  Ali the cuckolded husband says: ""I am not wanted in this country (he came to Germany from Turkey as a young child 40 years earlier), I bought my wife, and I don't want to die."" Each one of those statements has back-story.

In the special features Petzold discusses Cain and in a most interesting way.  Petzold uses phrases like ""post-Fordism,"" ""wage labor,"" ""class conflict"" and you just are not going to find many directors with such a powerfully distinct point of view (except Ken Loach and Mike Leigh to a lesser extent in the UK, and Victor Nunez here in the US).  The actors talked about their characters, how they crawled into their minds through the script and what we, the audience, got is a near brilliant piece of film making.

I knew, everyone must know, that it has to end badly, but how badly and what kind of badly and badly for which one or two???? Those unanswered questions creates the suspense.  I love noir and I see so much of it and read so much of it, so when I come across a movie or book that shifts the noir axis--this is very exciting for me.  Petzold intrigues me and I have just seen an earlier film called Yella.  Unlike Jerichow but at the same time his particular classist sensibility is there as well.",1268956800,10,1626,4.416107382550336
