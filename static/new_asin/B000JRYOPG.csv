2678459,5,B000JRYOPG,I loved this movie and I am so glad it will have a legit American release. It is violent at times but still entertaining and emotional. I recommend this to anyone who loves gangster movies.,1165536000,,189,4.428571428571429
2678460,4,B000JRYOPG,"A Jamaican version of the Hype William's ""Belly.""  A classic gangster movie and a must-see for all carribean people.  A little unrealistic at times, but it was still a gret movie.  Kymani Marley and Spragga Benz held their own with our great Paul Campbell (even though he played the rudest of rude bwoys).  Louie Rankin was equally entertaining.  My only disappointment was with the casting of Wyclef---he was horrible and irritating as usual. Without him, the movie would have been far more entertaining.",1165363200,2,505,5.036144578313253

2678462,5,B000JRYOPG,"""SHOTTAS"" WHAT A HARD MOVIE TO FIND, YOU HAVE 2 SEARCH THE NET FOR IT OR TRAVEL 2 JAMAICA! SHOTTAS WAS MEANT 2 BE BORN!! THE CAST DID NOT OVER OR UNDER ACT, THEIR SKILLS WERE ON THE $$$!! DOT'S WEH ME AH CHOT 'BOUT SEEN, MOR FI-YAH MOR FI-YAH! THE ONLY COMPLAINTS I HAVE ARE WHEN THEY OPTED 2 SHOW SPRAGGA SHAGGING THAT HOE...I WAS ALSO UN-EASY WHEN KYMANI LEFT MY MAN MAX/PAUL CAMPBELL AT THE HOSPITAL, I SUPPOSE HE FELT IT WAS THE BEST THAT HE COULD DO 4 MAX BEING THAT HE WAS INJURED? I MUST GIVE A SHOT-OUT 2 PAUL CAMPBELL, THE MARLEY FAMILY, SPRAGGA BENZ, LOUIE RANKIN & WYCLEF JEAN! WYCLEF (of the Fugees) HAD A CAMEO, HE PLAYED A HAITIAN HUSTLER.

THERE'S SO MANY SCENES THAT I LIKE...ANYTIME MAX/PAUL CREW WOULD RUN INTO MR.BRUKSHUT/LOUIE CREW THEY WOULD BEEF... THERE WOULD BE VIGOROUS PATIOS OBSCENITIES EXCHANGE FROM BOTH SIDES!! I LOVE PAUL CAMPBELL NOT ONLY BECAUSE HE'S SEXXY...ALSO BECAUSE HE SUITS THOSE ""RUDE BUOY"" ROLES LIKE ""RON BRICE""...(THEY'RE KNOWN 4 PLAYING MANIACS).

""SHOTTAS"" TAKE PLACE IN CONCRETE, JAMAICA BASED ON THE LIVES OF A GROUP OF CHILD-HOOD FRIENDS GROWING UP LIKE BLOOD BROTHERS (ON THE ROAD 2 SELF DESTRUCTION)... THEY HAD A LUST 4 FAST CARS, FAST HOES & MOSTLY FAST MONEY! THEY WANTED IT NO MATTER WHAT, CROSS THEIR PATHS & YOU'RE DEAD! MAX/PAUL C. WOULD MARK THE # OF VICTIMS THEY'VE KILLED ON THE WALL WITH THE VICTIMS' BLOOD (NO JOKE, DOT'S GONGSTA)!!!! THEY'RE RUTH-LESS & WON'T HESITATE 2 KILL FOR 1 ANOTHER AS BROTHERS WOULD! **OF COURSE IN EVERY GANGSTER OR HOOD MOVIE YOU'LL HAVE A CROOKED COP OR STOOLIE A.K.A RAT-SNITCH & THEY WOULD BE DEALT WITH ACCORDINGLY!**

***TAKE WHAT YOU WILL FROM ""SHOTTAS"" BUT IT'S ABOUT ""LIFE"", ""LOVE"" & THE LOST OF IT... THE SAME STREETS THAT FEEDS YOU CAN EAT YOU!***

I WOULD DEFINENTLY RECOMMEND SHOTTAS 2 PEOPLE ""WITH GREAT-TASTE""... IF YOU LOVE DANCEHALL HIP-HOP & REGGAE ROOTS MUSIC THEN BUY SHOTTAS ON DVD (IT'S VITAL)! <2 THE CAST I LOVE Y'ALL BABY KEEP GIVING US FLAVA 2 SAVOR>... UNO EAT WEH ME SEH?...AH RAIN AH FOLL BUT DE DUTT 2 TUFF, AH HUNGRY MOBB IZ AH ONGRY MOBB!!

2678463,4,B000JRYOPG,"Anyone who grew up or spent any number of years in Jamaica or had close cultural exposure through parents\family should find this film very authentic and entertaining; especially if you are a fan of Dancehall Reggae and have familiarity with the contemporary culture.  What I found most entertaining was the brash and flamboyant nature of the gangsters (a.ka ""shottas"") and the authenticity of the patios and each character.

Louie Rankin (also in Belly w/DMX) is a hysterically funny and course gangster who played well against the intensions of Biggs(Kymani) and Wayne(Spragga).  Spragga Benz was surprisingly engaging and executed a consistently cool ""in control"" demeanor, especially in the first half of the movie that was shot in Jamaica.  Paul Campbell who played the character ""Priest"" in Dancehall Queen is excellent as the cool and deadly killer who adds a menacingly dark yet complimentary contrast to the mentality of the ""shottas"".  Wyclef Jean, formerly of the Fugees plays a small but forgettable role as the Haitian contingency who supports Louie Rankin(Teddy Bruck Shut).

The violence depicted in this movie is shocking(but not overly gory) in the way the gangsters\ ""shottas"" boldly embrace and aggressively execute their way of life with such minimalist concern for human life other than their own brethren.  The plot develops very quickly but there are some gaping holes that make the film seem a bit unrealistic.  The sub titles are helpful because if you are unfamiliar with Jamaican patios the movie will be hard to follow.  However, the sub titles don't include all the dialogue.  In my opinion this is will be a long time cult favorite.",1110326400,13,1662,5.144981412639405

2678615,5,B000JRYOPG,A must have in my collection. This is way better than Belly to me. It has more action and the actors did a really good job. I wish they can make more movies or maybe come out with a second part of Shottas. Classic Jamaican movie. Even 70 year old love Shottas that's been proven to me. If you can't deal with a lot of cursing or you don't understand the urban life then this movie is not for you. Or if you are learning about different lifestyles and how people are brought up from different eras in the world or just different generations then this could be for you. This is a really good movie and you have to understand how and where people come from and why people act and do what they do. This movie is a prime example of that. Awesome movie.,1441756800,,747,4.123287671232877
2678616,5,B000JRYOPG,My first time viewing this movie was at someone else's house. I never really paid it much attention; I just remember people saying it was something like BELLY.

2678672,5,B000JRYOPG,My husband talked about this movie so much and repeated so many lines from it that I had to get him his own copy.  I'm giving it 5 stars because my husband just smiled like a kid when it came in the mail addressed to him.  It's the small things that make us happy.  I watched it and didn't really get why it was so great to him.  It's pretty low budget and there's lots of subtitles because Jamaicans speak English but it's a broken type of English called Patwah or Patois.  So prepare yourself for that if you're not familiar with Patwah.,1430438400,,539,4.194174757281553

Strong language and violence thus not recommended for the light hearted",1391644800,,361,4.1571428571428575

2678831,1,B000JRYOPG,"The beginning of the movie was intriguing, and I enjoyed the raw scenery of urban Jamaica. This helped to capture the feelings of desperation the characters experienced and presented clearly the motivations that would spur a child to a life of crime. The plot and the character dialogue slowly disintegrated, however, into ""gangsta movie"" cliches. The characters became nothing more than shallow husks of human beings, grasping for money and the girl with the biggest implants. The ending was trite and unrealistic. The mobster was surrounded by an army of bodyguards the entire movie, and then, conveniently, after attempting to assassinate the most feared and powerful ""gangsta"" of the past decade, decides to celebrate with his girlfriend in a hot tub outside of his home with no bodyguards at all and noone else at his compound.",1390262400,,832,5.125

2678855,5,B000JRYOPG,"Reminds me of where I come from, life outside of the tourist resorts in Jamaica is rough. Although the island is beautiful, their is a lot of poverty their.

If you don't know that dealing drugs and threatening people with guns and shooting people will eventually get you and your associates in prison or killed, than maybe you are just ignorant enough to enjoy this movie. I liked the film Belly because it at least had a positive message about transformation and choosing a better path at the end. This is a pure disgrace. It sensationalizes, glorifies, and glamorizes extortion, violence, and the objectification of women. It is disappointing that a child of Bob Marley, who has his father tattooed on his arm, would be part of a film as negative as this.

2678923,4,B000JRYOPG,"Sorry to be the only negative review but personally, I thought the movie was gratuitously violent.  Yes I know that this movie is as close to the real world of shottas as you can get. I am Jamaican and everything in this movie seems to be based on fact.  It gives you a very good idea of shotta life-style from their point of view.  All I'm saying that there was a lot of needless violence; violence put in to make the movie more gritty. A lot of people got shot in the head.  Is this shotta life? Yes it is!  It is important that we see the blood and brain matter to understand that he got shot in the head, no it isn't.

Someone else mentioned that there should be a part 2 to this movie. I agree, make a part 2, but based on the underground success of this movie, how about a part 2 that shows more points of view? It would it interesting to explore how the shotta life affects his family. Does anyone remember the famous shotta who had a brother who was an English professor?  Or how one gave his mother unlimited credit cards for Neiman Marcus in the States?

2678927,3,B000JRYOPG,"Shottas (2002) is a movie that unfolds in the American and Jamaican
underworld involving a kingpin with armed associates, clique,
entourage and million dollar lifestyle. This is intended for a
middle-of-the-road, general audience with mass appeal, featuring
gang animosities.

Some will be taken aback from the frequency of Jamaican slang, such
as ""bloodclot"", or a reference to Day-O (Banana Boat song) or the
shot caller (shotta.) There's also the matter of the  pronunciation
by the locals, incomprehensible, suggesting a style derived from
mass illiteracy.

Surprisingly, the release is not 16 x 9, which is unfortunate, as
many angles, the editing, the flow of the script and of the story
if often glossy, well chosen, filmed  and delightful.

There is nothing lost in the soundtrack, from an eclectic,
balanced, diversified and eager for risk series of numbers.

The story is food for thought, ranging from the characters -  all
miscreants and juvenile delinquents that are trigger happy - such
that the special F/X dept uses up dozens of blood packs over the
course of 90 mins, to weighing the likelihood that a kingpin can
make  $7 mil merely from shakedowns of other gangs and legit
businesses.

At not time is there any retaliation law enforcement. There is no
tension, either, among the gangsters, about the legitimacy of their
conduct, operations, rivalry, showing an euphoria from beginning to
end, ranging from scenes at clubs to outdoor festivities and indoor
scenes. A non-stop impunity for all conduct is the case, public and
private, in terms of rubouts, gunplay, car jackings,  and
shootouts.

Viewers are made to see a number of ""toys"" used by the
protagonists, ranging from a power yacht, a Lamborghini, Mercedes
Benz, Cadillac Escalade, Porsche, Rolex, etc.

The director's boldness is clear, in exposing the underlying
violence affecting much of Jamaica, and in expatriate communities
who know of no other livelihood than crime, firing pistols and
shotguns.  The ugliness and senseless killing, is in plain sight
and the darkness is juxtaposed tightly with hedonistic moments.

The ghetto, as shown, comprises people who are one-dimensional,
emotionally shallow, closed to cultural sources that normally,
permeate people's lives, ( TV, sports, religion, politics, book
authors.) The charactes seem to never have heard of those things,
or been influenced by any of them. The exception is when a
politician, (mingling with gangs perhaps to gain an upper hand on
rivals), turns against his underworld henchmen when they go rogue
and become front page news.

At the end, many will wonder how is it the characters are still
walking the streets, and not in an asylum.

The oversimplification of crime may also be a turn off, not least
of which because some of the biggest and most profitable
masterminds never show themselves, or commit violence personally,
Finally, Ky-Mani Marley's acting is promising, as Biggs.",1271635200,,2931,5.230769230769231

for a gangsta movie this is probably the best one besides new jack city, belly, godfather and scarface and it will keep u off ur feet. what kind of movie wouldnt be a good gangsta flick if it takes people out of kingston (the murder capital) and moves them to miami where they extort drug dealers and enjoy it

then it backfires and the drug dealers strike and kymani marley really goes off the top and seeks them out which makes this movie GREAT!!! his revenge is sweet and he seeks out all the drug lords and even shoots their girlfriends totally badass

The story is a powerful one! I can understand why this movie has quickly spread via the underground, but I do not understand why Shottas hasn't received the full recognition it deserves from Hollywood.

If you love ScarFace then you'll love Shottas even more is all I have to say.

I'm so glad there were subtitles...lol and the Shottas dictionary, there was no way I would've understood what some things being said were. I didn't know how one word ""bloodclat"" could have so many synonyms: bumboclaat, rassclaat and pussyclaat, lol.

My boss was not too happy that I viewed this movie because she always has something negative to say about American blacks as she calls us, like the black youths stand out on the streets doing nothing then go to jail. I asked her who fills the jails of Jamaica? Jamaicans...Who fills the jails in China? Chinese, so why is it so frowned upon that Blacks are in American Jails?

When young people or people in general are not giving the right opportunities, they will find a way to survive whether it's on the mean streets of America, Jamaica, or Africa.

It was also cool that the movie included subtitles in English for viewers who do not understand or speak Patois. This movie will probably not be rated as high as ""The Harder They Come,"" but it should be ranked as one of the top Jamaican rude boy films of all time as well as the coming out of artists such as Assassin, Spragga Benz, Kymani Marley, Louie Ranking, who were either already established stars or were on their way to stardom.

2678943,4,B000JRYOPG,"People scoring this movie with only a couple stars and complaining that it is derivative of other movies are missing the point. There is no pretension that this movie is something original and new. The point is to examine the life of Jamaican shottas, which this movie does well.

The quality of the acting is a pleasant surprise. Some of the main characters had no previous acting experience and do an admirable job. Louie Rankin, in particular, delivers a tremendous performance and is perfectly cast. Spragga also is excellent in the film. Although Ky-mani Marley gives a decent performance, there is something about the way he portrays his character that does not feel quite right. Hopefully in the sequel this aspect will be addressed.

The soundtrack is essentially flawless. The selection of songs and the soundtrack, done by Stephen Marley, fit into the movie well.

I would like to commend the director of Shottas, who also happens to be the writer of the story. The film is pieced together well, has the correct ambience from scene to scene, and is paced nicely in a way that does not get boring. There is also a fun addition of a little bit of comic relief from time to time that is placed well.

Shottas is by no means a masterpiece, but it is highly entertaining. There are few films that I watch multiple times. Shottas is one of those few films that I watch over and over. If you want to see a solid action film with pounding reggae and a Jamaican backdrop then Shottas is for you.",1193443200,10,1496,4.612781954887218

2678946,5,B000JRYOPG,"This was Cess Silva's 1st film and it was a very good movie, it explores the life of two Jamaican childhood best friends who grew up dirt poor & raggedy in the slums of Kingston, Jamaica. The friends (Biggs & Wayne)shared common goals, and each wanted to be rich with money, power & respect and wouldn't stop until they got to the top and had the best life possible. The movie takes you on a roller coaster ride while it explores friendship, loyalty, ambition, crime, pain, love, deceit/betrayal and teaches you a lessons. The loyalty, love and respect Wayne, Biggs & Mad Max have for one another as friends is almost farfetched nowadays, no one got jealous of the other one, no hating or backstabbing, just true brotherly love. They were down for each other and fearless. At the end Biggs learned a painful lesson when his demons finally catch up to him and he has to pay in many ways that money nor fine luxuries can't buy. I'll admit it was an underground movie and leaves alot to be desired which may come if there's a sequel, but being this is the director's first movie, I give him 5 stars for effort and for the delectable eye candy (Kymani Marley & Spragga Benz). In his next effort I'm sure he'll have a plot and other essentials in a good movie.
This is a good movie and anyone from the hood, the Caribbean and  born African American can definately relate, I feel as though this movie is just as good as Scarface, The Godfather and Belly for that much, these rappers and artists that have no formal acting coaching did a superb job!",1184630400,26,1542,4.448763250883392

2678948,5,B000JRYOPG,"This is de truest shotta business. One to watch! Better than any movie mi ever see bout shotta business. This a jamaican affair about top shottas and if there is a second part mi will buy it any day. It's intense,tough and hotta than fire. Kymani Marley,Spragga Benz(de real thuggie),Louie Rankin and the real mad,tough&wickedest actor Paul Campbell should be awarded for best actors fi di year. The plot was remarkable and one to remember!!!",1178928000,2,442,4.906666666666666
2678949,4,B000JRYOPG,"Loved it, Great movie..it shows the grimy hard life in Jamaica, not the white sand and pretty beaches. When they went to Miami it got much better too,I wish there was a soundtrack for it because I liked the music. Can't wait to see the sequeal!!",1177804800,2,245,4.3478260869565215
2678950,2,B000JRYOPG,"Two poor Jamaican youths decide to rob a vendor to get some money. The rest of the movie is a mindless repetition of Jamaicans stealing and killing each other, both in Jamaica and America. It never rises above a third-rate in plot, acting, characterizations, or special effects.",1177027200,4,278,4.9361702127659575
2678951,5,B000JRYOPG,this movie was HOTT.  i bought this movie on bootleg and never watched it until i got bored one day.  WOW what i had been missing.  head bussing and wig splittin all throughout the movie.  i don't know what was funnier wyclef himself or the clothes that he was wearing.  BIG UP to the cast and musch respect to dem shotta mad max,1176336000,7,329,4.158730158730159
2678952,5,B000JRYOPG,"The acting was outstanding. Very believable characters. This story needed to be told. I hope this discourages our Jamaican youth from a life of violence and encourages the powers that be to do something about the Shottas culture. The fact that Jamaican actors and musicians were utiliized was awesome! I love that it was shot on location in Jamaica! That certainly lends validity to the project! Ky-Mani Marley did a great job in his role and I was pleasantly surprized with Spragga Benz's performance. Well done cast and crew! Well done, Silvera!",1173398400,,547,4.956521739130435
2678953,5,B000JRYOPG,Great Jamaican movie with subtitles for those of you who will not understand some of the dialogue.,1170806400,2,98,4.823529411764706
2678954,2,B000JRYOPG,This movie is okay if you like low budget gangsta movies without any plot. People compare this movie to City of God and I have to wonder what they've been smoking. This movie is just like any of the other straight to Dvd movies starring a rappper except its about Jamacans in Miami,1169596800,4,281,4.320754716981132
2678955,5,B000JRYOPG,"This is a great movie. Loved it. I cannot wait for the sequel. Hopefully this will be in the theater officially and not known only through bootleg. I hope they do not let corny, overacting Wyclef have a part in the sequel.

please, please.",1169078400,,239,4.431818181818182
2678956,5,B000JRYOPG,"The 1st movie to accurately portray gansta life in Jamaica. Makes light of the crooked politicians and police and their influence in perpetuating the crime situation in Kingston, JA.  All of the characters were authentic except for Wyclef Jean who's goofy character and terrible acting should have been left out.  If you like movies like Scarface and Belly you've got to cop this movie!!",1168732800,,387,5.03125
2678957,5,B000JRYOPG,"This movie is simply amazing.  It was produced with a fairly low budget but has great, realistic effects.  It also captures the heart of gangsta mentality and the reality of what goes on.  I actually met Cess last night and he's working sequel right now - I can't wait to see the next one.  If you love great independent films, buy this DVD and keep an eye out for Shottas 2!",1168560000,,375,4.23943661971831
2678958,5,B000JRYOPG,"This isn't another talentless rapper movie (accept Wyclef)don't overlook it due to pathetic movies starring oh say 50 cent, master p or any rapper movies that followed.",1168473600,,168,5.2592592592592595
2678959,5,B000JRYOPG,"This movie is very raw, full of excitement and gritty. When it comes to gansta flicks, this will also be noted since it shows a diff spin. It is truly the jamaican version of Belly.",1168300800,,181,4.2
