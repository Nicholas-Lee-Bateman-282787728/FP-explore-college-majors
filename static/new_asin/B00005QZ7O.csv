1652128,2,B00005QZ7O,"I will be first to admit this is the worst of the Robotech Series...the fact of the matter is a great deal of ambiguity that complete vexes me. First of all, the mecha used by the Southern Cross are pathetic, even the assault choppers. Second, when ""help"" arrives from deep space, they should have more serious technology, ie., the Alpha and Beta fighters. Third, when the Robotech Masters left Tirol, their protoculture levels were terribly low, so low in fact that humanity's levels of protoculture should've torn their invasion fleet to shreds. Alas, no...the Southern Cross continually gets pounded and you get this feeling like Supreme Commander Leonard is the biggest loser on the face of the planet. So, thats my story...I love Macross and the whole Invid storylines much better than this, with Macross being the best of the best! True fans must have all the DVDs coming out, but that doesnt mean we have to like the 2nd series one bit!",1003190400,,943,4.791411042944786
1652129,5,B00005QZ7O,"All of the Robotech DVD's are worth owning just for the experience of reliving childhood memories.  I have purchaced all of the DVD boxed sets so far and have not been disappointed and do not expect to be disappointed by this one either.
For most of us, Robotech was our first introduction to dramatic episodic television and 15 years later it does not lose any of its magic or any of its power.  Beyond its nostalgic value, the story is still superior science fiction/space opera and will be as good today as it was when you were a kid.
If you have never seen Robotech - SEE IT.  Start at the begining and watch it all, you will not be disappointed.  Sure, there is some cheeze involoved - but, hey - it was the 80's.  There is nowhere else that you can get the kind of action, comedy, and drama that Robotech holds.
You will identify with the characters and struggle with them as they try to understand what is going on around them.  Robotech is vastly superior to any Japanese Anime on television currently because the characters are realistic and mortal.  You learn about the horrors of war and learn that people are not immortal.  (unlike cartoon like Gi Joe, where no matter how many bullets were on the field somehow the heroes made it out safely)
The Robotech Masters saga will give you the meat of the story and explain many plot points that might have been bothering you since you watched the Macross Saga.  So, put away your Pokemon trading cards and go out and get a toy hovertank (one of the coolest mecha in the saga) and put the Robotech Masters DVD in your player today.",1003104000,3,1586,4.441379310344828

7951301,5,B00005QZ7O,"This Legacy Set #5 is a DVD release of the US 1985 TV Series Robotech: The Masters Saga Episodes 49-60.
Note: The rest of The Masters Saga is in Set #4 which has disks 07, 08, and Bonus Disk E4. The entire series consists of seven box sets.

Set #5 Has three DVDs:
Disk 1 (09) is episodes 49-54
Disk 2 (10) is episodes 55-60
Disk 3 (E5) is the Bonus Disk
..typing off the back cover of E5, the Bonus Disk contains...
- Macross Pilot
- Preproduction Art (Sentinels and unproduced Southern Cross Designs)
- Robotech The Movie Supplementals (trailer, music video, storyboard animatic)
- International clips (various languages)

By this point everyone knows that this is taken from the original Japanese Super Dimensional Fortress Southern Cross, and it aired in the US starting in 1985.  Some of the Southern Cross footage appeared in Robotech The Movie along with parts of Megazone 23.  There have been a few US DVD releases over the years, and these days there are two main flavors: Original/Legacy and Re-Mastered (mostly).
The original release would be this one - the Legacy version, while the Re-Mastered (mostly) exists in the standalone Re-Mastered sets and the complete set Re-Mastered releases like The Protoculture Collection and Robotech The Complete Set.

Looking at both versions, you can see that the Re-Mastered release does look a little better as the colors are more defined and the details are sharper than with the Legacy version.  Plus viewable area of the screen is a little larger with the Re-Mastered releases. The newer release It isn't perfect, though.  Artifacts present on the original releases can still be seen on the Re-Mastered ones. In some cases they are easier to spot as the overall details - including defects - are now sharper.  Choosing the Legacy release allows you to watch Robotech in all its grainy 1985 glory, so one would think that the Re-Mastered version would win hands down.

However, the downside with the Re-Mastered releases is that they *Specialized* the sound effects rather than leaving the originals as they were.  Some say the some of the new effects now sound like those produced by a video game rather than a TV series, which spoils the nostalgia.  Thus some people opt to stay with the grainy Legacy version to stay true to the original sound effects.  It's all a matter of taste.  As 99% of the Legacy releases floating about these days are ""used"" they don't cost that much, so I opted for both the Re-Mastered and Legacy versions.  One items of note is that the Legacy versions take up a LOT more space on one's shelf with their individual inefficient packing, so make sure you've got the room for them all..  I'd say The Complete Set (20+ disks) is only a little larger than just one of these Legacy box sets.

Off Topic:  From what I have heard, there MAY be higher quality versions floating around.  But these would all be Japanese releases lacking even English subtitles (Ex: Macross, Southern Cross, Mospeada).  I gather the odds of getting a higher quality release in the US with the original US voice track would be next to impossible, so if you want this on DVD, pick a version and buy it. :)",1513296000,,3158,4.7299270072992705
7951302,5,B00005QZ7O,"Two of the four discs. that make up the second part of robotech. Like its previous release this one is also
packed in a case containing one disc each. Each of the discs contain 6 episodes. And packed nicely in a card board sleeve similar to the Legacy Collection 4.
  I have viewed these discs as well. The background music is still good. Its amazing how the music is in sync with the
scenes. Good sound effects.
  Do i recommend it? Yes. for any robotech fan who wants to complete his set of robotech dvds. or a fan of southern cross, who don't want to see the whole robotech series but wants to watch only the second part of the story.

7951303,3,B00005QZ7O,"Robotech: Masters - Legacy Collection 5 is a three-disc DVD box set that was released in 2001 by ADV Films.  The first disc contains the episodes: ""A New Recruit,"" ""Triumvirate,"" ""Clone Chamber,"" ""Love Song,"" ""The Hunters,"" and ""Mind Game.""  The second disc contains the episodes: ""Dana in Wonderland,"" ""Crisis Point,"" ""Day Dreamer,"" ""Final Nightmare,"" ""The Invid Connection,"" and ""Catastrophe.""

The third DVD in the set is labeled as ""Extra Masters 2 - Elements of Robotechnology V.""  This DVD contains all the special features included in this box set.  The first extra is the original English pilot for Macross.  This pilot was produced by Carl Macek before the idea of Robotech came to fruition.  The theme song took the original music and wrote new English words for it.  However, the English lyrics were pretty bad, and the singer on the theme wasn't very good, either.  I also didn't like the narrator on this pilot; he was ""over the top,"" and it gave the episode a cheesy feel.  Most of the dialogue in this pilot is used in the first episode of Robotech; the main changes to the dialogue had to be made due to name changes (most notably, Rick Hunter was Rick Yamada in this pilot).  Most of the voice actors were also the same, although the voice for Macross City's mayor was notably different.  After seeing this, I know that this treatment would never have worked for Macross, and that it ultimately worked better when it was part of Robotech.

There is also ""Pre-Production Art.""  There is thirty-one pages of line art for The Sentinels, and twenty-two pages of line art for unproduced Southern Cross designs.  Next is ""Movie Supplementals.""  In this menu, you can see the trailer for Robotech: The Movie.  A video for Three Dog's Night ""In My Heart"" is included (although it should be noted that while the song was recorded for Robotech: The Movie, all the footage that appears in the video is for the Southern Cross portion of Robotech).  Under ""Movie Supplementals,"" you can also see twenty-two pages of original storyboard drawings by Paul S. Power, and you can watch an animatic for Robotech: The Movie.

The final extra on the third DVD is the ""International Clips.""  The first clip is when Marie Crystal and Sean Phillips have a confrontation at a restaurant.  The second clip is when the Fifteenth Squadron smuggles Musica past Nova Satori.  Both of the clips are available in English, French, Italian, Spanish, and Portugese.  I'm disappointed that the original Japanese versions of these clips weren't included.

Overall, this is a decent DVD box set.  Even though I wish ADV Films had gone to more effort to remaster the video for this release, I would still recommend this box set.",1234224000,2,2706,4.8431372549019605
7951304,4,B00005QZ7O,"Good afternoon. Do you remember me? This is Eba Kutowa again to have another discussion. Today's discussion, wil be sat on  the subject of ""ROBOTECH"" a little mecha show from the 1985's.

Dana, Boey, Zor, Louie, Lutenant Brown, Nova, Marie, Sean, and all of those other people are characters from this show. I love Dana, she's got her own thing, she spunky, stubborn, jealous, and a commander! She's so cute! Zor is the one she likes. In these volumes, he get's amnesia and can't remember a thingt, and it's her job to help him remember!

ROBOTECH is a really good show. It's got heart, mecha, action, robots, comedy and all that. It is pretty good. I give THAT a 5-star point. Now,the reason why i overal made this only a ""4-star"" is becuase it's just a bit corny, and i don't care for the extras disc too much. I could live without it. But yeah, it is highly recommended! The show is great, the characters are great, it's got a cool plot, i love the voice actors! Kywaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! And i love Dana!

Well, i'll see you next time for one of my other little discussions, which will be in ""Poke'mon: Soundtrack for ""1st movie""

Well, until then! Bye!",1164758400,,1170,4.605769230769231
7951305,4,B00005QZ7O,"This box set contains Robotech Vol. 9, Robotech Vol. 10 and Robotech Extra Disc 5. Since the first two discs can be bought seperately, my review will be on the extras disc.
At first glace, these extras appear to look pretty good, but once you see them, it's kind of a let down. The main attraction here is the Macross pilot. This pilot episode has all the original Japanese music and animation with an exception for the closing and opening sequences. There isn't much in here that is different from the Robotech version. Such as the scene of the Mayor talking about the future of Macross city and the scene where Gloval walk off the stage. There are also a good number of script changes. Most notably that the name Rick Hunter has been changed to Rick Yamata. Some other small changes include changing SDF-1 to Macross and Micronians to Inhabitants. It was pretty good, but not all that enthralling.
Then there is material from the Robotech movie. The first is a high quality trailer for the film that is less than 30 seconds. A lengthy music video that was made for the movie is on here, but it's typical 80's techno that will leave you a little tired. Probably the best movie material here is the animatic sequence which tells a part of the story through storyboards. But still, with all these extras, why didn't ADV just put movie on the disc?
Thankfully, the rest of the extras are well done. The production sheets of all the military units from Southern Cross and the unused designs from The Sentinals were pretty fun to take a look at. The International clips were okay, but someone needs to fix that Italian track.
Overall, these extras are above average when compared the last disc, but still leave you wanting more out of Robotech.",1010448000,3,1740,4.598070739549839
7951306,5,B00005QZ7O,"The Robotech Masters Legacy:  Collection 5, a three disc collection, contains episodes 49 through 60 (the second half of the second story arc, The Robotech Masters) of the legendary anime series Robotech from the mid 1980s.  Also included in this boxed set is the fifth installment of the Elements of Robotechnology special features DVD which includes the original English language translation of Macross and extras from the Robotech II: Sentinels movie.
Robotech was the most popular of the Americanized Japanese anime series to hit American TV waves during the 1970s and 1980s (along with Star Blazers, Voltron, Transor Z,  etc.)  Known for its cutting edge animation, high-tech battle scenes, futuristic weapons (planes, tanks, motorcyles that transform into robots), cool alien invaders, and realistic and compelling storylines, Robotech swept an entire generation and helped put Japanese Anime forever on the map of American pop culture.
In this particular volume the action and drama hit a crescendo as a memoriless Zor joins the Earth's ranks and the Earth's defenders (under the direction of the stubborn and foolish Leonard) continue to fight an uphill battle against the far superior Robotech Masters.  This collection is the pivotal chapter to the entire Robotech saga as the secrets of Protoculture (the reason why all the fighting has taken place) are finally revealed, giving a prelude to the maelstrom to come in the next story arc.
Here's the rundown of the episodes and content featured on each disc:
Disc 1:  Counter Attack
Episode 49 - A New Recruit:  General Emerson assigns a memoriless Zor to Dana's 15th Squadron in hopes that (an infatuated) Dana can help him regain his memories.  Bits and pieces come back in haunting bits for Zor.  Also, Supreme Commander Leonard makes a faithful decision.
Episode 50 - Triumvirate:  Dana and Zor visit the site of the SD-F1 in hopes to jog Zor's memory and find mysterious plants growing inside.  Marie saves the day as the Earth Defense forces launch their biggest (and fruitless) attack against the Masters yet.  Also, introducing, The Ajax Fighters.
Episode 51 - Clone Chamber:  Musica is overcome with human emotion; Marie saves the day again as Leonard unveils his new plans.  Plus, Dana makes a date!!!
Episode 52 - Love Song:  Reunited, Sean and Marie head off for a date (with disaster); Nova has a secret admirer.  Plus, Leonard has an unpleasant surprise for General Emerson.
Episode 53 - The Hunters:  Louie's special targeting system for his video game draws attention from the Robotech Development department.  Plus, Emerson's fleet goes off into battle.
Episode 54 - Mind Game:  The 15th is assigned to and attacks the Robotech Masters Fortress -- where betrayal awaits.  Bowie copes with his feelings on killing.  Plus, introducing -- the Invid Fighters!!!
Disc 2:  The Final Solution

Episode 56 - Crisis Point:  The 15th make their escape from the Fortress with the aide of Musica and a re-programmed Zor.
Episode 57 - Daydreamer:  The 15th smuggles Musica back to Earth, hiding from Nova and the GMP.  The Masters plan their next move and deal with the fallout from Musica's actions.  Plus, the 15th is betrayed again...

Episode 60 - Catastrophe:  The thrilling conclusion for the Robotech Masters saga.  The 15th attempts to liberate the clones and Zor attempts to stop the Masters once and for all!!!
Disc 3:  Elements of Robotechnology 5
This collection actually contains one of the better installments in the ""Elements of Robotechnology"" series.  Here's a rundown of the contents on this disc.
1. Original Macross English Translation Pilot:  This is the half hour Carl Macek produced English translation of the Japanese anime series Super Dimensional Fortress Macross, which formed the 1st Generation of the Robotech series (the Macross Saga).  Same basic storyline, etc. etc.  Awfully cool feature.
2. More Production Art Clips for the Sentinels as well as unused artwork for Southern Cross.  Pretty cool.
3. Extras from the Robotech Movie including:  1 - the movie trailer, 2 - a music video featuring 3 Dog Night's ""In My Heart"" (really cool) and 3 - Storyboards and 2  minute animatic (the animatic's pretty cool).
4. More International Clips in French, Spanish, Portuguese and Italian for two scenes (Sean's disastrous date with Marie and the 15th trying to sneak Musica onto Earth past Nova).
Though this particular arc of the Robotech saga is pointed to by many as the ""low-point"" of the series due to somewhat confusing storytelling and less enthralling characters (I felt the same way too as a kid), I must say that it's definitely A LOT better than I remember it being. The action still kicks ... even 15 years later.
If you've never seen Robotech, simply put YOU MUST.  The action and the drama are compelling, clearly showing why Robotech became a pop culture icon.  It is the series that forever put Japanese anime on the map in the US.  If you did grow up with Robotech, give these a watch again.  They're great for a trip down memory lane. You can't lose!!!

7951307,3,B00005QZ7O,"I have to agree with most `Techies that the `Southern Cross' chapter of the ROBOTECH saga is probably the weakest of the bunch. I found it a bit too cutesy at times, and the storyline often took severe leaps in logic that make some of the more implausible moments in other 80s `toonage seem down-to-earth. Also, due partly to the abrupt cancellation of the Southern Cross when it was originally broadcast in Japan, it ended without really developing most of the characters to the fullest. And whoever cast the voice actor who did the dub for Zor shoulda been made to suffer a slow and painful death! Still, it does have its moments. And when it comes to my fave shows on video, I'm a completist-- I just gotta have `em all!
Much like the previous ROBOTECH eppies put on disc, the picture & sound quality of this batch ain't that much better than what I used to see & hear on VHS. But, at least the DVDs have more eppies per plateer than any of the VHS videos had per tape, making this series an amazing shelf-space saver. That, and I don't have to worry about degradation after endless viewings. So, at least there's a bright side to the situation.
The bonus disc in this particular set contained a surprising addition: the first episode of the English-language rendition of `Macross' before it was incorporated into the Robotech saga and re-dubbed! Until now, the only way to get this rare piece of anime history was eBay for a legitimate VHS tape (VERY expensive!)  or the bootleg market. This pilot has the same voice actors in the same roles, and most of the original dialogue spoken here remained intact in the Robotech re-do. Also included are a few scenes that were eventually trimmed from the Robotech rendition. Unless you're a really observant viewer of the show, the restored parts may pass you by without a second thought!
Also included are a few bits of media regarding the unreleased and largely-unseen `Robotech: The Movie', most of which didn't impress me all that much. Both the teaser trailer and music video (3 Dog Night's ""In My Heart"") weren't all that spectacular, and contained only `Southern Cross' footage that was cannibalized and stuck into the film. None of the cannibalized `Megazone 23' scenes are present. The Robotech movie animatic is basically the dialogue & sound track from the end of the movie, with shots of the corresponding rough storyboard sketches. This little bit of anime proto-cinema is probably one of the only moments from the movie that'll ever see a legitimate video release. Don't feel too bad about this revelation, though-I've actually viewed `Robotech: The Movie', and believe you me, you're not missing out on much.
Also included on the bonus platter are several sketches of various Southern Cross body armor & transports that never made it into the finished series. Most of the body armor designs are reminiscent of Samurai uniforms & the robots of M.S. Gundam. And, like the previous bonus platters, this one includes a few clips dubbed in French, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish.

7951308,5,B00005QZ7O,"Most reviewers will get tired of the plot of these episodes, understandibly. What they do not understand is that these episodes (the re-thought series forced to fit in the American Robotech storyline) are not at all about fighting an attacking enemy race, but instead seeing the folly of the military power, as the earth becomes the real antagonists and bullies, who attack an unknown enemy who have actually come to protect the human race from the massive imminent invasion of the Invid, who are in search of the flower of life. The Robotech Masters are a dying race, the last thing they want is to fight humans--but they need protoculture to survive, and the humans do everything possible to stop them.
The bittersweet ending of the series should have made people understand that this section is not about heroes and crusades for peace, it is about war for the sake of war and the evils of such warfare (the supreme commander is exemplary of this). At the end, it is clear that the foolish destruction of the Robotech Masters will lead to earth's invasion and decimation, enter the Invid.
The series features the deepest questions about us as humans in the Robotech series. It lacks the immaturity of the first series (Dana's immaturity is mocked and quickly confronted, as is Bobby's). Reviewers who have attacked the plot problems (like the returning ship from the REF forces) forget that it was not originally created as part of the Macross universe, and elements were conveniently adjusted to fit it in (such as constant references to Zentraedi of which there are none, only 15 years after the original series!!!). If such depth is not your style, wait until the Invid invasion series, which feature the most interesting battle scenes and mecha in Robotech, but perhaps the worst plot and characterization.
A fan of the Macross series will likely dislike Southern Cross, but a fan of the Robotech re-creation will admire the much more complex, deeper (and granted imperfect) plot. Great mecha animation coupled with stunning musical pieces makes this as well as the remainder of the Southern Cross series a must-have.",1006905600,18,2123,4.932960893854749
7951309,3,B00005QZ7O,"Southern Cross gets alot of bad reviews. But lets be honest, what could have topped Macross? Not much. Southern Cross had alot to live up to. My view is that SC was a well made animation, and if it would have been a stand alone, it would have been big. This collection is fantastic! The animation is outstanding. I personnally loved SC, the mecha, the Robotech Masters... everything about it was amazing. The battle scenes were great and the story flowed well. The DVD's came with previews of many of my fav animie! Just give it a chance, I'm sure you'll love it.",1005350400,3,563,4.475728155339806
