7730175,5,B01E4K22X4,"Saw this subtitled in english.  This does feature several plot lines, however, I found the main one with megan lai and baron chen adorable.  They have incredible chemistry and megan lai fully deserved the award she won as pi yanou.  This has action, romance, drama and beautiful scenery.",1484611200,,287,4.9375

7730177,4,B01E4K22X4,I love this series! Its one of my favorites. This would have gotten a 5 star review except ***Spoiler Alert*** the last disc ends without the 1 min. 45second true ending that played after the credits. I originally watched the series on a streaming channel called Dramafeaver so I know it should be in there and is not included on the discs. High quality though and the translations pretty good too.,1465603200,15,398,4.619718309859155
7730178,5,B01E4K22X4,"Delightful film with subtitles, a thrilling plot with lots of intrigue, and four  amazing love stories. Gender is not always primary when two persons find each other. Musical score and songs, beautiful nature shots, and plenty of warm encounters.",1464825600,3,246,5.3076923076923075
8757602,5,B01E4K22X4,"Actors: Baron Chen Bromance is one of my favorite Chinese dramas. This copy is made by Multimedia and is the only version available. I believe it is now out of print ( upc 9 555 209 016693 ). The subtitles are good but not perfect, in most Chinese dramas, subtitlers frequently have confused Nieces and nephews as an example. Truthfully I haven't watched this recently, but since it is a common mistake it might be in there, so I thought I should mention it. It happens in most of my Chinese dramas from Multimedia.  Picture quality is excellent.  Now for the review.
  STORYLINE
Pi Ya Nuo is a girl that has been brought up and live as a man until her 26 th birthday. If she doesn't do this, according to the fortune teller, she will die young. On her 26 th birthday she will be a woman from that point on. So, she is currently 25. Pi Ya Nuo sees a fight and jumps in to protect the people being attacked. With the attackers loosing the fight, she has now discovers that she made the mistake of helping the mob boss Du Zi Feng and his sister. Du Zi Feng doesn't want to owe anyone and try's to repay Pi Ya Nuo. Meanwhile his sister has fallen in love at first sight with Pi Ya Nuo and pursues her as a love interest throughout the series. Du Zi Feng is not like other mob boss's. He is an upstanding person who runs a theme park and doesn't break the law. There are a lot of fight scenes in this drama. Since Pi Ya Nuo was brought up as a male she can fight with the best of them and win. She is a breadwinner for her family and a strong  person mentally and physically. Du Zi Feng even brings her home. He try's every way he can think of to repay Pi A Nuo , who doesn't think it's a big deal because anyone would have done the same. Her food truck gets stolen and he offers her a spot in the theme park to sell food. There are other story lines in this drama too. Du Zi Fang's father is missing and has been for years along with his best friends father. This storyline is amazing by its self but to much to list. I love that in Chinese dramas the side characters get to have full story lines too. But it would be to much to write about. A lot of mob dealings and finding his father who has memory loss. Pi Ya Nuo and Du Zi Feng become very close and she falls in love with him but is unable to tell him she's a woman. She wants to be with him even if it's as a man as he hates people who lie to him. And he starts to be confused about his feelings for her too, because he's not gay, but can't risk her leaving him. So, they become blood brothers. This just complicates things more. This way he is also able to protect her from the other mob bosses who would hurt her or use her against him. She's spunky and even confronts mob boss's on her own too. She has one female friend that has always known that she was a woman. She dressed Pi Ya Nuo up once as a child as a girl and took a picture. Pi Ya Nuo saw a boy drowning in the water and recuses him, but he thinks it was her friend as she had to hide as people were coming and to not be discovered. It was Du Zi Feng that she rescued and he has been trying to find her and has her Barrett. Her good friend sneaks her out to let her dress up as a woman and to try to get used to it as her birthday is coming up soon. They we spotted by Du Zi Feng and told that she is her twin sister. But to his amazement he doesn't have the same feelings toward her and  finally comes to the decision that he doesn't care if Pi Ya Nuo is a male, that his feelings are real and he will accept  that he's in love. These two have a hard time making it to her birthday for the big reveal. She is so afraid during the series of loosing him because of her parents superstition but still is willing to respect her parents and comfort them by waiting for her birthday. There is also a love rival for Du Zi Feng, a male friend of hers who accidentally found out that she was a girl and not a boy on the day she rescued Du Zi Feng as a child. This drama is long but each episode is fantastic and addictive.
  THE ENDING CONTROVERSY. LET ME ADDRESS IT HERE.
The couple do get married but the real ending of approximately 2 minutes is missing.  It should have the couple kissing from the elevator, down the hall and to room 1314 while continuing to kiss. They barely make it into the room. It was so funny and one of my favorite parts. So, I did what normal people do and asked the seller about it. The seller was surprised that something was edited out like this and some other small edits, so he asked questions.  Me, on the other hand decided that I wanted answers immediately. So, I contacted Multimedia by email to ask for the proper ending. Believe it or not they are fast to respond from Malaysia. The reason for this is it did not pass that countries censor boards. They said that if the government has any sensitive issues, kissing scenes will always be edited out. Yes, I did that and then let my seller know the answer before he had his answer. If you like my reviews click on my name and see others. I try to list all dramas with company when possible, subtitle and picture quality and durability of the sets. This one works over a large number of plays without quality loss. Also, if I replaced the set with a better set and who has the better set. I recommend buying the best set first if possible. Because replacing it later doubles the price, it would have been cheaper if I had done that. I will be listing about 200 dramas and CDs that are Korean / Chinese / Taiwanese. CDs I'm listing track lists if in English, special features and if it offers English subtitles and if the DVD plays on US players. I hope this helps you decide, but remember once the sets are sold your chances of finding them again are small.  I buy from BLG WORLD, ASIAN DRAMA STORE, ASIAN MALL,TIMOTHYNG001,KONA AND MORE,SUI GENERIS, CINFLIX (used) THESE ARE THE BEST SELLERS. You will be able to get excellent customer service from them and are easy to work with. If anyone wants to see the real ending, I think it's still available to watch on Netflix.",1529712000,2,6068,4.1027801179443975
8757603,5,B01E4K22X4,What a excellent movie. i found it entertaining. Baron Chen is a natural actor. The rest of the cast is great. I really enjoy watching this movie  and i watch it almost everyday.,1528675200,,178,4.393939393939394
8757604,4,B01E4K22X4,"The copy of Bromance I received was a very bad copy for the price paid. The movie its self was fun, romantic and it kept you wanting more!",1526947200,,138,3.9642857142857144
8757605,5,B01E4K22X4,"When stuck at home ans sick for a week, you binge watch.  I loved this story! Not what i expected in a good way... It's categorized as comedy romance but don't let it fool you... I was so pissed that the second half had my mucus membranes working overtime against all my meds that were trying to dry me up... i was crying all over the place and I couldn't stop watching... then at the end I was so happy that I had to go back and watch all my favorite ""falling in love"" parts again with my new perspective.  Loved it so much!",1518048000,,525,4.038461538461538
8757606,5,B01E4K22X4,Mmm I love the series however where are the other episodes. There are 30 episode and I only have 18 here. Where can I get the others?,1513641600,,133,3.962962962962963
8757607,5,B01E4K22X4,I found this had a lot of funny parts and I liked how his friend from child hood fell in love too.,1502409600,,98,3.5
8757608,5,B01E4K22X4,"One of the best dramas I 've watched - Baron Chen and Meg Lai are wonderful. I love the girl disguised as a boy story, and really liked the acceptance by friends and family of  a man dating another man. and like other reviewers have said - there is real chemistry. And so romantic! There is much less scheming / general evilness than in Korean drama's (This is a Taiwanese drama) - no evil step moms (dont get me wrong, I love villains).  This is sweet and heartwarming. This version for sale is the Malaysian version and has some edits for modesty - like they edited out the end end scene in the hallway...too steamy apparently. So far this (Malaysian edition) is the only english subbed version I can find for purchase. Hopefully with the increasing popularity of this drama and other Taiwanese dramas (Prince of Wolf) there will be more english subbed versions available.",1492041600,,874,4.632258064516129
8757609,4,B01E4K22X4,"Everything seems great! Unfortunately to my disappointment, as another customer mentioned, the special ending after the credits is missing! Is there a way to fix this? I gave it 4 stars because it wasn't the entire series. Even if it was only a couple of minutes worth.",1491177600,2,269,4.74468085106383
8757610,5,B01E4K22X4,"My re-introduction to Asian TV shows. 4 love stories, parent, children family stories & a healthy dose of intrigue with action. What's not to like about this charming show? Megan Lai & Baron Chen's chemistry is incredible. One reviewer is right, this is missing the awesome ending and the 1 hour special. You can catch them both on Drama Fever & Vicki.",1490572800,4,352,4.693548387096774
