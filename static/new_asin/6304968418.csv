7880562,4,6304968418,"In this film, Marc Mac Young and Richard Dodson concentrate only on attacking with a knife. The defensive stuff is presented elsewhere (Surviving a street knife attack).
The instruction is very good in the film, and they demonstrate each technique in great detail. All the techniques are very simple, and it is easy to believe that you could realistically use these techniques in a fight. In addition of great instruction, there is lots of humor in the film, but the instructors continually remaind you of the harsh reality of a real knife fight (""The winner of a knife fight is the guy who ends up doing 20 years hard time"").
As with the previous film, the production value of this film doesn't match the high quality of instruction. This fact reduces one star from the rating.
