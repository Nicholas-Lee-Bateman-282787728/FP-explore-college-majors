3435502,5,B0019EXZY4,"This was a good movie. It had plot twists and intrigue and it wasn't until the ending credits did I realize it was based on a True Story. The movie was about some small time crooks who think they've lucked out with a bank job only to learn that they are up against MI5 and some bigger crooks and crooked cops. Ending credits usually state that the names have been changed to protect the innocent, but here it states the names have been changed to protect the ""guilty"".

On balance it was a fun movie to watch with a good script and acting. If you are a Jason Statham fan, you'll like this move",1504310400,,593,4.201754385964913

3435554,3,B0019EXZY4,Jason Statham is a very good action star.  He gets over shadowed it seems like by other action stars.  This is my favorite movie of his.  This is based on a true story that I didn't know anything about.  Basically he is hired to rob a bank and get into a safe deposit box and get some some pictures of the royal family.  The movie starts off slow.  But once they start tunneling into the bank it gets pretty exciting.  I would recommend this to anyone.,1476921600,,452,4.186046511627907

3435572,1,B0019EXZY4,"This movie was terrible. Some of the acting and lines were fine, and Statham was good as usual, but the movie had this pervasive racist ""black power"" theme running through it that was very disrespectful of white people. It was very antiwhite and degrading to white women.  The whole movie is literally a caucasophobic sexual conquest fantasy masquerading as a caper film. If they reversed the races, the film wouldn't have been made.  Two thumbs down for this odious SJW flop.",1473292800,,476,4.864197530864198

He is pure entertainment if you like that kind of action movie.  I got hooked on him in The Transporter movies and The Italian Job (although I didn't know who he was in the IJ movie) He was in another one In the Name of the King which was a totally different kind of movie...but also really good, and I don't think it would have been except for his being in it.  Like Schwarzenegger or Sylvester Stallone or Bruce Willis, I can't say they are like John Wayne, great actors, but they are just totally enjoyable almost playing themselves.",1465084800,,709,4.1911764705882355

3435616,4,B0019EXZY4,"The Bank Job is based on the true story of the Lloyds Baker Street bank robbery, with the conspiracy theories of the time thrown in such as the British Intelligence involvement and photos.  The urban legend stuff of course makes this a much more interesting storyline than it would have been as the simple dig a tunnel while being overheard by the ham radio enthusiast basic vault robbery tale.  It's quite a fun movie, you do wonder why a bank without it's alarms being operational wouldn't roster a couple of its security guards to be in the bank when it's closed.  Plus the openness of discussing what they're doing over the walkie talkies seemed to be a particularly strong level of stupidity but we know that, that actually happened.  It does throw in a bit of Statham action hand to hand combat hero norm at the end which stands out as being over the top compared to the more realistic vibe of the film former to this.

Overall it's an enjoyable watch, if you like a good caper film, or films based on true crime then you won't go wrong giving this one a go.",1447459200,,1064,4.435897435897436

3435686,5,B0019EXZY4,"Martine Love drags Terry Leather (Played By Statham) into a major crime caper after she is busted for Heroin smuggling. Leather is in to a loan shark and has no choice but to agree. He gathers up a group of fellows who can assist with the job. Their plan is to tunnel underneath a bank and up into the vault itself.

Unbeknownst to Leather, Martine has been coopted by MI-5 and is playing the group against the deal she made to avoid being sent to prison for a very long time.

I won't go into too many more details save to say that this film is one of the most enjoyable movies I've ever seen. It has action, adventure, suspense and sex. All elements of a fantastic plot that carried my attention.  I was enraptured from the start. The movie was unique in it presented a plotline with four different story arcs. Michael X and his black Muslims, Terry Leather and his gang, Tim Everett and his MI-5/government cronies, David Suchet the pornographer and his corrupt cops; there's even the good cop angle led by Roy Given. All of these parties converge in the end and their convergence leads us to an epic culmination that is second to none!

A sad history of the British Royal Family. Interesting if often times disturbing.  A remarkable true story. Gory in parts but in all worth the effort. Good acting by the entire cast.  Mick Jagger has a small role as a bank employee/clerk who works in the Vault.",1431302400,,1402,4.45703125

3435726,4,B0019EXZY4,"While watching The Bank Job (2008) by Roger Donaldson I could not help thinking how much it felt like a Guy Ritchie's movie, the best that he did not direct. The Bank Job is fast, smart, and so well made that I can only agree with Richard Rupert of At the Movies with Ebert& Rupert, ""The most entertaining heist movie I've seen in years"". It is based on the true story of the Baker Street robbery that involved a robbery of the safe deposit boxes at a branch of Lloyds Bank on the corner of Baker Street and Marylebone Road, London, and the following political scandal that the content of some of the boxes might have caused. The robbers were never arrested, and the cash, jewelry and the documents were never recovered. I am not sure how much truth is in the film but it works fine recreating the atmosphere of the 1970s with its political corruption, sex scandals that link to the highest circles, and the police incompetence.

I mentioned Guy Ritchie above, and it seems that the colorful characters from the different layers of society that inhabited London in The Bank Job might have come directly from his early movies. The most decent and sympathetic turned to be the petty thieves led by Terry Leather (the role fits Jason Statham like a glove) while the owners of the stolen safe deposit boxes are mostly corrupt and despicable. Among them the members of the parliament who like to visit the fashionable London brothel, the leader of Black Power organization who keeps the compromising pictures of a member of British Royal Family in the coveted deposit box 118, and the porn-king of Soho (David Suchet) who makes the note of his every payment to the bent cops of London in the special book. Sushet, known to millions as a master of gray cells, the world famous Hercule Poirot, is here on the other side of the law. Perhaps, you won't remember this movie for its outstanding photography and spectacular scenery but as far as the level of entertainment and thrills goes, it is certainly a hit.

3435819,5,B0019EXZY4,"This movie without a doubt was the best movie I saw in 2008. It had action, adventure, suspense and sex. All elements of a fantastic plot that carried my attention.

Martine Love drags Terry Leather (Played By Statham) into a major crime caper after she is busted for Heroin smuggling. Leather is in to a loan shark and has no choice but to agree. He gathers up a group of fellows who can assist with the job. Their plan is to tunnel underneath a bank and up into the vault itself.

Unbeknownst to Leather, Martine has been coopted by MI-5 and is playing the group against the deal she made to avoid being sent to prison for a very long time.

I won't go into too many more details save to say that this film is one of the most enjoyable movies I've ever seen. I was enraptured from the start. The movie was unique in it presented a plotline with four different story arcs. Michael X and his black Muslims, Terry Leather and his gang, Tim Everett and his MI-5/government cronies, David Suchet the pornographer and his corrupt cops; there's even the good cop angle led by Roy Given. All of these parties converge in the end and their convergence leads us to an epic culmination that is second to none!

I truly loved this movie and I plan to purchase the Special Edition as well. I'd love to see whatever extras they may have compiled for the film. I'm proud to be the 75th Five Star Rating for this film and the 192nd overall review. If you like bank caper/heist movies, this one will not disappoint you. It has the added benefit of being a period piece that adds character to all of its scenes.

3435830,4,B0019EXZY4,"I liked this clever and quite twisted crime film. It is not exactly an immortal masterpiece, but an original and very skilfully made thing. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

The makers of this film decided to take numerous unrelated events which took place in United Kingdom in the beginning of 70s and combine them together to create a fictitious and very complicated but ultimately logical and coherent multifaceted tale. This idea of taking some REAL events and REAL people and then use them to create FICTION is a very original thing indeed and albeit not easy, it was done very well. To increase the feeling that this is a ""real"" story and a kind of revelation of things until now hidden from the public, the director decided to add to the credits a line saying: """"The names of many people identified in this film have been changed to protect the guilty.""

The real, but UNRELATED events which the makers of this film used as building blocks were the following:

- the ""Baker Street Robbery"" which took place on 11 September 1971, in which the robbers stole 3 million pounds...
- life of Michael de Freitas a.k.a. ""Michael X"", a.k.a. ""Abdul Malik"", a man born on island of Trinidad in 1933 to a black mother and a white father, who emigrated to UK in the 50s and since then combined a career of petty criminal and self-declared ""black revolutionary""; after he launched many vocal racist anti-white manifestos, in the early 70s he became a good friend of many British left-winged radicals, including John Lennon; in the same time he also graduated into more serious crime... I will say no more here and if you want to enjoy this film fully do not search for more on the internet
- life of Bernie Silver, a major crime boss in London's underground from the 50s to 1975, active mostly in prostitution, pornography and racketeering
- life of Peter Rachman, a London slum-landlord, who used petty criminals, including ""Michael X"", as his enforcers
- the scandal of corruption in Metropolitan Police of London, which culminated with trials of 1976-77
- the resignation of Lord Lambton in 1973 following a sexual scandal
- the rumors concerning the private life of Princess Margaret

I will not say anything about the way in which those elements were combined, but it was very well done indeed.

This is a good, solid crime film, with good performance by actors, of which Jason Statham, David Suchet and Saffron Burrows are the most known, but who ALL did a great job. There are many clever twists, some real tention, some quite graphic violence, some sex but also some good humour and all this is well mixed.

I liked this film and I will keep the DVD for a possible future viewing. Enjoy!",1398211200,,2714,4.703157894736842
3435851,5,B0019EXZY4,"This is a very good movie, and quite nostalgic, Jason can act, but the material he's given is limited to his muscular abilities. Take it  from someone who pretty much dislikes  everything made today.",1397260800,,199,4.823529411764706

3435856,1,B0019EXZY4,"No exaggeration.  The box said that the movie was supposed to be based on a true story about how some small-time crooks are manipulated into robbing a bank safe deposit box, unaware that it contains sexually incriminating photographs of a member of the Royal Family.  Sounds intriguing, right?

Well, the film beings with brief glimpses of nudity, suggesting what was photographed, and why the government is so desperate to retrieve the photographs from the safety deposit box, but cannot do the job themselves, and why they try to get small-time crooks to do the actual job.  Said crooks agree, thinking they're just going after easy money, but there comes an irrelevant subplot about a black man making a political statement by having sex with a white woman, as well as the crooks being taken to a brothel with a bunch of naked women, and they are themselves stripped and bound up for S&M sex.  I stopped watching; the nudity and sexuality was far too gratuitous and I felt like I was watching a soft-core porn movie instead of a story.  Suggesting sex is one thing; putting lots of breasts and buttocks in is another.

If you want a story about a bank heist, there are many more far superior movies out there.  If you want porn, there's no shortage of that to find on the Internet.",1395792000,,1284,4.650442477876106

To say that it ticks many factions off, is an understatement, this drug lord, that pimp, this government agency and the police precinct. hard hitting, fun and gritty not for the very squeamish there is a torture scene that is rather intense.

When a group of robbers break into the bank and steal the photos along with a great deal of money and jewels, everything goes to hell. But who's behind the robbers and why?

3435908,5,B0019EXZY4,"The Bank Job is everything a heist movie should be: a great plot, good twists, tension, and a great payoff. I've watched this movie twice. The first time just for fun, the second to study the intricacies, and there are plenty. Jason Stratham plays a mild mannered bad guy with a family. He gets roped into a big heist by a girl he once dated. Of course there's more to the job than simply breaking into a bank vault. There are dirty pictures of a British Royal and some spies behind the scenes. Furthermore, all does not go well for everyone involved, including some of Stratham's gang and the spies. At times this movie is light hearted, other times it's hard hitting and gritty. I don't want to give away the plot because this is a caper flick. Suffice it to say, it follows a known path but is a great ride. Stratham deserves tons of credit for being an action actor with talent and class. (I wish he would do more movies like this!) The supporting cast is equally polished, delivering excellent performances in such varied roles as wife and mother to gangster to bumbling cops and thieves. While watching this movie, pay careful attention because the scenes are short and things move FAST. You won't bog down in some silly maudlin set piece. Instead, you'll be treated to quite a few brilliant episodes with dialog that pops right off the screen. This movie is one to keep and watch every couple of months.

3435947,5,B0019EXZY4,"""The Bank Job"" is great! This is how the story goes: A car dealer with a dodgy past and new family, Terry has always avoided major-league scams. But when Martine, a beautiful model from his old neighborhood, offers him a lead on a foolproof bank hit on London's Baker Street, Terry recognizes the opportunity of a lifetime. Martine targets a roomful of safe deposit boxes worth millions in cash and jewelry. But Terry and his crew don't realize the boxes also contain a treasure trove of dirty secrets - secrets that will thrust them into a deadly web of corruption and illicit scandal that spans London's criminal underworld, the highest echelons of the British government, and the Royal Family itself...the true story of a heist gone wrong...in all the right ways. The cast led by Jason Statham (as Terry Leather) is great! The directing by Roger Donaldson (who also directed ""The Recruit"" (2003), ""Thirteen Days"" (2000), ""Dante's Peak"" (1997), ""Species"" (1995), ""The Getaway"" (1994), ""No Way Out"" (1987), & ""The Bounty"" (1984) is excellent! The story and screenplay by Dick Clement & Ian La Frenais (both who also wrote the story and screenplay to ""Across The Universe"" (2007) is excellent! The music by J. Peter Robinson is great! The cinematography by Michael Coulter (who also did the cinematography to ""Love Actually"" (2003) is excellent! The film editing by John Gilbert (who also did the film editing to ""The Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship Of The Ring"" (2001) & ""Bridge To Terabithia"" (2007) is excellent! The casting by Lucinda Syson (who also did the upcoming ""Speed Racer"" (2008) is excellent! The production design by Gavin Bocquet (who also did the production design to all of 3 of the ""Star Wars"" prequels and the 2 ""XXX"" movies) is excellent!

The set decoration by John Bush (who also did the set decoration to the upcoming ""Made Of Honor"") is excellent! The costume design by Odile Dicks-Mireaux (who also did the costume design to ""10,000 B.C."" (2008), which, of course, was released on the same date, ironically enough) is excellent!

While I enjoyed the fast paced action this film offers, it jumps around so much and so fast, that it's pretty hard to keep up with. I found myself quite confused at many different points in the film, especially at the end, when I had to rewind 3 or 4 times. Jason Statham is far and away the top action star out there today. What's so great about him falling under the radar is that he gets to do what he wants to do, instead of getting stuck with nothing but big budget disasters with no plot. The story behind The Bank Job and what led up to it, who was really involved in, was really interesting and made for a great plot.

I had my suspicions while watching because the amount of action in the film is very apparent. This is probably my biggest criticism of the movie, probably caused by my own incorrect expectations.

The film is accurate up to a point (as many of them are). A lot of the base details are correct, specifically the robbers leasing a nearby leather shop, digging through the floor, and ultimately coming up through the vault's floor to raid the safe deposit boxes. From there it seems much more speculative as many of the documents chronicling this event are classified and will be for years to come. The ending is the director's best guess given what they know about the surrounding events. Apparently there were several people arrested for this crime in real life, but all of them proclaim their innocence. On the one hand you wouldn't admit you participated in a crime of this magnitude, on the other, there would need to be an scapegoat because of the amount of publicity this story received.

The film does a good job chronicling this heist but could have added more excitement into the mix. I would have given it a 3 if it wasn't based on a true story.",1360540800,,1259,4.591111111111111

3435999,3,B0019EXZY4,"The Bank Job (based on a true story) tells of a bank heist ordered by some UK government officials in 1973 to recover compromising photos of a member of the royal family. Wanting deniability, a mid-level official gets his sometimes girlfriend Martine (Saffron Burroughs) to put together a team of robbers who won't know the true objective. The robbers think they're only in it for the money. Lots of other entanglements (like various crime lords and the legitimate police investigation of the robbery) make the job and the getaway a lot more difficult and a lot more dramatic. Jason Stathham plays the guy organizing the heist and trying to keep things together in the fallout afterwards.

The story is pretty interesting. A lot of the complications seem like they'd be contrivances but that ""based on a true story"" under the title makes them more acceptable. For example, a ham radio operator stumbles on the frequency the robbers are using on their walkie-talkies and the police get involved earlier than anyone expects. The conclusion is satisfying if somewhat more Hollywood than I imagined it would be.

This movie does need some major warnings. First of all, there's a lot of sex and many naked women running around in it. Way too much for my taste. The language is pretty bad (standard R-rated fare). The violence is only occasionally but rough and realistic. Which brings me to the other warning this movie should have. If you're a Jason Statham fan, you might have a certain expectation when it comes to action scenes. He's a great fighter and has lots of style, something my wife and I enjoy seeing in his other movies. There's none of that in this movie. He's a tough guy and does beat up one guy, but no fancy martial arts or fight sequences are on display. He gives a fine performance otherwise.",1357689600,,1808,4.754777070063694

3436043,5,B0019EXZY4,"Last night's bargain-rack movie was ""The Bank Job"" (2-Disc Special Edition) DVD. It was rather interesting and the story involved an actual bank robbery that took place in London in the 70s. The filming was good, as was the sound and the acting. The story was well written and well staged with only a few lapses here and there. I would not term it an action movie, as noted on the DVD cover, but the activity that there is holds your interest and attention.

The movie is based on the story of a elaborately-planned bank robbery. The plan was to tunnel into the safe deposit vault of the bank from the basement of an adjacent building over the weekend when the businesses would be mostly closed down. Not all were closed and noise became a problem. The prime intent was the collecting of as much money as possible, but safe deposit boxes contain a lot of things other than money and some of them were documents incriminating the state police and were sought by a different level of city police, so not only was it cops against robbers but cops against cops. The whole thing was rather complicated, which held your interest. The crew involved about five men and a woman and an outside observer to keep a check on things around the exterior of the building. The  woman was a secret plant who was not primarily interested in the money, but was after the documents contained in one of the boxes. Well, a lot of things began to go wrong, as you could probably imagine on an operation of this magnitude. The whole thing became rather complicated after the police thwarted the robbery but were faced with suppressing and outing some of the various documents. Deals were made between the various robbers and the several police units to somehow get everyone out of the whole mess. Be sure to read the notes at the end of the movie as to the ultimate outcome to all the different facets of the story. Good movie. Well done. Thought provoking.

Beautifully written, directed and acted by an exceptional cast led by Jason Statham, this fascinating look at corruption at the highest and lowest levels of British society during the late 1960s is sure to please the discerning viewer.

3436060,5,B0019EXZY4,As the owner of Hadtofindmusicandmovies.com I get to see a lot of movies. The Bank Job is way above the usually heist movie. While it is indeed a Bank Robbery so much more is going on. I won't spoil it for anyone so you can enjoy it unfolding. The fact that it is based on a true incident in history puts it way over the top because if it were pure fiction you would maybe say,1302134400,,376,3.960526315789474
3436061,5,B0019EXZY4,"I really enjoy heist movies; the take and the target, the colorful characters, and the inevitable plot twist all make for a great story. It was with these expectations that I went into ""The Bank Job,"" whose title spells heist movie if there ever was one. What I found, however, was a heist movie dedicated not to an elegant robbery, but instead to retelling one of the most elaborate coverups of the 20th century.

Set in 1970s London, the movie's central plot revolves around scandalous photographs taken and held as blackmail by an unpopular civil rights activist. Believed to be located in a safe deposit box in the vault of a Baker Street bank, British officials seek to recover the photographs by indirectly hiring disposable thieves to break into the bank.

While these photographs are introduced as the primary conflict, the movie's overall plot is made far more complex through the introduction of other side characters who bring with them their own individual interests. Such a large number of characters and a diversity of stories operating simultaneously might normally bog a movie down, however, ""The Bank Job"" largely avoids doing this by lightly bouncing between its many individual conflicts, and by slowly allowing its characters to develop. By the end of the movie, what was supposed to be a typical bank heist movie instead becomes much more.

Jason Statham stars as Terry, an amiable middle class mechanic. When presented with what he believes to be a no-risk, high reward opportunity, Terry assembles a crew of equally opportunistic amateur thieves to pillage a London bank of its untold riches. Each of these characters is the make-up of a colorful personality one might expect to find in a heist movie, and it is because of these personalities that the movie functions the way it does. High tech gear is replaced by shovels and a very loud jackhammer; keen criminal intellect is replaced by humorous ignorance. These characters are after nothing more than the quick score that the job will provide, and as such it is only Terry that begins to suspect that his team's involvement might have larger, more dangerous ramifications.

By the end of the movie, Terry and his crew of misfits find themselves at a standoff with British government officials, a ruthless kingpin, and crooked cops, all wanting what's theirs.

Jason Statham performs admirably in this movie. Rather than the fearless, physical action star he's cast as in many of his other movies, in ""The Bank Job"" he by contrast is a much more normal character mixed up in abnormal circumstances. He is the central figure in this movie, and it is his dialogue and actions that largely drive most of the second half of the movie.

""The Bank Job"" is a heist movie like no other, whose plot involves much more than a ""get rich"" scheme by its main characters. Instead, through a series of overlapping stories, the movie develops as a cool, intelligent retelling of an event still largely shrouded in myth. This movie is a must-see for those who love heists, intelligent action sequences, and an unpredictable series of events.",1296345600,,3100,4.917782026768642

No high tech devices, just guys with shovels etc. There were a few problems with this film, which did border on ridiculous(taking a nap in the middle of a BJ!??), but overall this was a really entertaining ride and reminded me of a film made in the 70's because it wasn't so outrageous to spoil the fun.",1290038400,,581,4.542857142857143
3436064,5,B0019EXZY4,"I almost want to copy and paste the review provided by the site here because it kind of says everything I want to say.

Seriously though, this movie is `cheerful, energetic, and completely entertaining'.

Based on a true story, `The Bank Job' revolves around a heist that serves up so many twists and turns it's almost unbelievable and yet it all works so believably well.  Splicing together tidbits of information in a creative and engaging way, the film brings a 70's feeling of funk and joviality without ever losing the films harsh and gritty edge.  You root for the bad guys because there are obviously even `badder' guys running amuck here, and you hold your breath in suspense because you truly never know how things are going to end up.

Set in the early 70's, the film tells of a group of amateur criminals who get conned into an `easy robbery', robbing a bank that will be unprotected for a short period of time.  The problem is that they what they are there to steal is property valued by many people (governmental and criminal) and when you toss in some corrupt police you have an `easy robbery' was winds up being much harder than expected.  When all is said and done, these petty thieves find themselves in far over their heads when all sides come in on them at once.

Oh, but what fun it is to watch.

The best thing about `The Bank Job' is that it never loses sight of its purpose, which is to entertain.  It is fun, 100% of the time.  It layers the scenes with an intensity that is masked with a veneer of spunk.  The performances are totally felt and in keeping with the films pace and humor (I think it's safe to say that this is Jason Statham's best film and best performance).  The films hodgepodge of sequences layered to create a patchwork of storytelling comes of spectacularly, leaving the audience scratching their heads just long enough to get them to pay close attention.

3436066,3,B0019EXZY4,"The Bank Job (2008), director Roger Donaldson's latest feature film, reminds me visually of his film Thirteen Days (2000) starring Kevin Costner.  It has that same cinematic look and tone to the movie.  Thirteen Days was set in the 60s during the Cuban Missile Crisis and The Bank Job is set in the 70s.  What I love about Donaldson's last few films is how carefully crafted the periods in which they were set comes through in the movie.  Donaldson is one of the few older directors whose work continues to improve and contribute to the craft of filmmaking (like Clint Eastwood). The Bank Job has a great ensemble cast led by Jason Statham, and the story really zips along in this film. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this film since my expectations were low with Jason Statham.  Statham usually starts in a typcial Hollywood action vehicle with lots of special effects and car chases.  But he really shines in this role and shows his dramatic acting ability that I felt in The Transporter (2002) movie.

Roger Donaldson has created another great movie in line with my other favorites of his:  The World's Fastest Indian (2005), The Recruit (2003), Thirteen Days (2000), Dante's Peak (1997), Cocktail (1988), and No Way Out (1987).  The best of filmography in my opinion is Thirteen Days, a very finely acted and crafted film about JFK during the days of the Cuban Missile Crisis.  But the rest of his films I've listed are right up there as well.  Check out The Bank Job.",1286236800,,1479,4.65

3436070,4,B0019EXZY4,"I wasn't familiar with the Baker Street robbery that took place in London in the early '70s and provides the source material for this British picture.  The ""Bank Job"" has a lot to really like, but at the top of my list was the amazing recreation of 1971 London --- from the streets of the city to the styling of the clothing and hair of the characters.  This amazing attention to time and place, along with the stellar ensemble cast of petty criminals,  immediately sets the tone for this movie and transports you back to the time of post-60s disillusionment.

Unlike other suspense films, ""The Bank Job"" doesn't have so many twists and turns that it leaves you confused and frustrated trying to piece together an elaborate jigsaw puzzle.  Perhaps this is because it is based on a true story and the screenplay remains true to the real life events.  I'm still surprised that these petty thieves were able to get away with such a preposterous bank heist.  ""The Bank Job"" is an entertaining, fast paced and engaging movie that is well worth a viewing.",1263254400,,1049,4.6378378378378375

3436072,3,B0019EXZY4,"Nicely capturing the look, fashion, and atmosphere of a classic 70's British caper, Roger Donaldson's Bank Job (2008) is supposedly based on an actual bank robbery that took place in London in 1971.  The film features a group of working class mates, who looking for a big score, band together on something of a lark, to have a go at robbing  a bank.  But things are not what they seem, and with a bit of bad luck, things escalate to total chaos.  More than just a straight caper adventure, the complicated and seemingly unlikely tale, also includes political intrigue at high levels of the British government.

Former model Martine Love (Saffron Burrows), is setup for a drug bust while returning from holiday, and contacts Tim Everett (Richard Lintern) for help.  Everett, a government official involves her in an elaborate scheme to find someone to rob a bank, in order to recover compromising photos of British royalty taken in Jamaica by one Michael X (Peter De Jersey), and locked in a safety deposit box.

Martine runs the idea by Terry Leather (Jason Statham), an old friend who currently runs a used car dealership, and is having financial troubles.  Rounding up mates Dave Schilling (Daniel Mays) and Kevin Swain (Stephen Campbell Moore), tunneling specialist Bambas (Alki David) and front man Guy Singer (James Faulkner) the group begins planning the robbery of Lloyds Bank, located in the heart of London.  Securing the lease on an  nearby shop, the group begin tunneling towards the vault, with a lookout on the roof of a nearby building in radio contact in case of trouble.  Even while still inside looting the vault, the police are already looking for them, having been tipped by a radio operator who has overheard their communications.

All hell breaks loose soon after the gang escapes with over four million pounds in loot, and incriminating photos of royalty and Whitehall officials.  Also missing are the records of an organized crime leader (David Suchet), who is willing to do some very harsh things to get them back.

Although based on a real events, to what extent is unclear, as exactly what was stolen from the vault was never determined.  Why the British government, with so much at stake, would back such a dodgy venture is a complete mystery.  It seems totally insane, but apparently it happened.  How could the government expect that the thieves would not look at the photos?  Where are the negatives?  As copying records is simple, the odds of matters ending without complications was highly doubtful.  Was there really a burial vault below the building?  If so it was one fortuitous coincidence.  Many questions remain unanswered, and the film does not have a comfortable sense of closure.

Bank Job is not as gritty and violent as some crime films from the period, but it has a retro vibe, and tells its tale without a lot of gadgets, stunts, special effects, fights or chases.  With solid acting all the way around, staying closer to reality is kind of a refreshing approach.  Some may be disappointed this isn't a balls out action extravaganza like Death Race, but Bank Job is more a nod to the past.",1261267200,,3134,4.834896810506566
3436073,4,B0019EXZY4,"Terry Leather is a shady car dealer in East London who finds himself in hock to a local gangster who`s putting the screws on everyone who owes him money.  Desperate for some quick cash, Terry allows a former friend and model to trick him into helping pull off a major bank heist, unaware that he and his buddies are actually being used by the British authorities to steal some scandalous photos that, if published, could seriously embarrass the royal family.  The potential blackmailer is a black radical who models himself on Malcolm X and who thinks he holds the upper hand with the authorities as long as he is in possession of the pictures, which he has put in a safety deposit box in Lloyds Bank.  Terry and his crew, unaware of the back story and convinced there is a fortune to be had for the taking, fall right into the authorities' trap, bearing all the risk should the scheme somehow fail, yet sharing in few of the rewards should it come off as planned.

Based on an actual event that took place in 1971, ""The Bank Job"" is a solid, old-fashioned heist drama directed by Roger Donaldson with a super-abundance of suspense, energy and style.  There are twists and double crosses aplenty in the screenplay by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, which uses the bank robbery as a mere jumping-off point for a scathing survey of the London crime scene, ranging from the lowest levels of two-bit thievery to the upper reaches of police and governmental corruption. There's also just enough uniqueness in the setup to keep us from feeling we know where the story is heading while it`s still playing itself out.  Despite a rather large cast of characters, we're usually able to keep most of the people straight during the course of the drama, though there are a few moments in the back half of the film where a little more clarity might have been helpful.

In a bit of a change-of-pace for himself as an actor, Jason Statham gets to shed his ""Transporter"" action-hero image in favor of a more recognizable working-class stiff and family man who happens to have a serious penchant for running afoul of the law.  Also compelling is  Saffron Burrows - a dead-ringer for a young Charlotte Rampling - who stars as the seductive go-between who lures Terry and his men into a plan that may well lead to their undoing.

The Great Bank Robbery of 1971 had the dual effect of not only turning villains into heroes but of helping to purge much of the corruption and rot lurking in the top echelons of British society.  It's a fascinating piece of twentieth century history brought to vivid and memorable life in a gripping and stylish film.",1257120000,,2628,4.618025751072961

With all the makings of high drama, we have a group of thugs quasi-anonymously hired to break into a bank vault to steal the contents of a specific box, thought to hold pictures of a royal family member in questionable circumstances, with the freedom to steal whatever else they like along the way.  Straightforward enough.  The robbery  isn't the real focus though, and they succeed.  What is critical is what happens after, when another covert government group becomes involved with further incriminating evidence found in the vault and many of the deposit box holders don't want to reveal the contents of their boxes.  Though the plot does deviate from the story, proper, it's fiendishly well done and viewers end up agonizing over who to pull for.  Definitely worth watching and not at all a family film.",1247443200,,938,4.861635220125786
3436076,4,B0019EXZY4,"Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais wrote the film ""The Bank Job"" is supposedly based on the true story. This can possibly explain the complexity of the film. The film is more of a documentary than a shootemup or car chase film. At first, it looks very formula. Later you get interested in how it comes out.

Seems like somebody high up any the government or the royal family made a faux pas. This ended up on some glossies that allowed a high-profile criminal to escape prosecution. These photos end up in a bank's safety deposit box. A shady car dealer Terry (Jason Statham) is convinced to Rob the safety-deposit bank vault without realizing that he is helping to retrieve the photos. The story gets awfully convoluted from here and includes MI5, other government agencies, police departments, and local criminals; David Suchet plays one.

How will this all turn out? We will see as the story unfolds.

The acting was well done and the props were excellent for the period piece Set in London in the early 1970's. This may not have been an exceptional film but it will hold your attention to the end.

3436079,4,B0019EXZY4,"Jason Statham is well on his way to becoming typecast. It seems like he's in a ton of these kind of action films lately, although this movie is a bit more subdued and complicated than some of them. At least in this heist flick, there are several twists and turns and you have to stay alert to follow who is exactly on the up-and-up and who isn't, and Statham isn't punching out 10 people at once.

This is another one of these modern-day films in which the crooks, the thieves, the bandits - whatever - are the ""good guys"" and the police and the government officials are the bad guys. This seems to be a big favorite of the anti-authority filmmakers world in the last 40 years whether it's in Hollywood or London.

Regardless, it's a very entertaining film and Statham and company are fun to watch. That's also nothing new as the tough ""Transporter"" star has become a regular at playing these kind of nice guy/macho/thug roles.

Actually, everyone is pretty much a creep in this film, just to varying degrees. They are all interesting, too, and several of the minor characters have a good sense of humor, too.  Add some very tense robbery scenes, some sex early on, some double-crosses later and you have a very serious Keystone Cops type story where you're never quite sure what crazy thing is going to happen next.",1241827200,,1316,4.563559322033898

3436093,4,B0019EXZY4,"THE BANK JOB is almost one of those guy action flicks that we blokes just love to beat our chests about.

And although The Bank Job has elements of Statham's toughness, it's not what makes this movie a very good flick to spend 111 minutes watching.

Most interesting is that the film is based on an actual London crime where a group of lowly criminals decide to move up to the big time by robbing a bank. Trouble is, it's all a ruse to get at some photos that the British government wants but can't get to. So MI-6 hires out the job ...supposedly without the knowledge of The Crown or the higher-ups in the legal system.

Terry Leather (Statham) is the unlucky soul who gets roped into doing the job by one-time flame Martine Love (Saffron Burrows,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fay-Grim/dp/B000NY0YKO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fay Grim</a>), an extremely attractive woman who's got an inside scoop on said banks security system shut down. When Terry and his crew finally do get inside and begin rifling through the contents of safety deposit boxes, they all think they're in hog-heaven. But once finished with the job, Britains elite to its scumbags come crawling around, looking for who stole their belongings, records, photos, and other miscellaneous items. Terry's team is in for some rough times. But can Terry get most of them out of it before it's too late?

Although no one really knows what happened to the bank robbers (other than they were probably jailed under assumed names), it is interesting to look at the history behind the robbery and see how involved England's legal system was in everything after the heist. None of the names of the criminals was ever released. Nor were their sentences. Nothing of their identities has ever been seen by the public, even though this was a public crime perpetrated against a public entity (a bank).

There's a lot going on in the story, too, so it's pretty convoluted but the story holds together exceptionally well. Director Roger Donaldson (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-World-s-Fastest-Indian/dp/B000MX7V3Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The World's Fastest Indian</a>) is to be commended for that; this thing could've got completely unwieldy, I'm sure.

Statham carries the film well on dramatic chops and not his normal action/martial arts ones. His overwhelming affection for his wife (Keeley Hawes,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-at-a-Funeral/dp/B001O2MBP0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death at a Funeral</a>) is portrayed with just the right amount of tenderness and tough-love. His caring for his team is also well played, especially when they begin to disappear in not-so-pleasant ways.

All-in-all, this is a very well put together flick, with just the right doses of action and drama to make one enjoy every minute of it.",1238889600,,3452,6.0060975609756095
3436094,5,B0019EXZY4,"Mick Jagger earns a few honest dollars as a clerk in The Bank Job. This is just one interesting detail in a movie that overwhelms you with details. The acting is sound, the direction is excellent, and the plot keeps your interest. There are several bizarre twists and turns. It's filmmaking at its best.

It's based on a true story, the robbing of a London bank in 1971. Director Roger Donaldson pointed out in the DVD commentary that he researched court transcripts and visited actual locations. The robbers tunneled under the bank, broke into the vault, and looted scores of safe-deposit boxes. They grabbed a fortune in cash and other valuables, much of which was never claimed because it was dirty.

But it turns out that the boxes also contained incriminating photos involving the Royal Family and a ledger that documented massive police corruption. So, it was not the ""simple"" heist that the thieves had planned. They are pursued by powerful and vicious people.

The robbers are a motley crew of petty criminals who were tricked into the heist by Martine Love (Saffron Burrows). She made a deal with the government in order to escape prosecution for a drug bust. If she can get those nasty photos she will walk. So, she recruits Terry Leather (Jason Statham), a former lover who runs a shady used car operation that is deeply in debt to a loan shark. The tough and resourceful Leather puts together a band of hoods who are oddly innocent and loyal to each other. Leather and a couple of the others come off as rather solid family men. They seem to be ""blokes"" who want a big score to escape tedious lives.

There's some of that distinctively droll British humor. It's made clear that the British mind-set differs markedly from our Wild West mentality here in the colonies. And the film leaves you contemplating a titillating question that has never been answered. Was that Princess Margaret friskily frolicking in the Caribbean?",1234742400,,1934,4.798798798798799

Something I've always noticed since watching Jason Statham is that the differences between his Hollywood and British movies are very distinct. His Hollywood titles are usually mindless action entertainment fluff, whereas his British (aka BETTER) movies are a lot more dramatic and/or whimsically written. Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch (the only two I've seen) are great, great pieces of film full of quirky characters, plot twists, excellent scripts, and a very dark style of comedy. The Bank Job is a slightly faulted return to form, portraying yet another heist gone bad, but with our protagonists coming out on top at the end. I liked it. As typical of myself and British scripts, I took a liking to the dialogue and subtle frankness that Brits have in their language such as their accents and colloquialisms (I find it funny to call someone a wanker or say the word ""bollocks""). On top of that, the film itself did a very good job of pacing all 3 acts: the setup, the job, and the getaway. Drama and thrills abound in this movie with good writing, decent characters, and a retro feel to the '70s. I was rather impressed by the staging, set designs, and costumes, having been born in the '80s myself, and thus not as familiar with what was. The one complaint I did have, though, was with the tone of the film. Of the 3 British gangster/heist movies I've seen (Lock, Stock, Snatch, and Layer Cake), I found Bank Job to be just a tad lacking in terms of a strong screenplay. Guy Ritchie put a great deal of quirkiness into Lock, Stock and Snatch, while Matthew Vaughn put a lot of grit into Layer Cake. However, I simply felt Bank Job fell short of this by not putting enough emphasis on any particular aspect of the story or characters. But regardless, it's still a very good movie for what they had to work with (being based on a true story and all).

Video - 4.0

What a strange and fickle job of cinematography. I saw so many instances of reference video, but then other scenes would be too high in contrast or too saturated in hue. It's a good transfer, don't get me wrong. It's just a damn inconsistent one from shot to shot at times. Black levels are solid, and there's very little, if any grain present from what I saw. Sharpness is pretty high quality as well, but getting back to those contrast and hue problems, it had a tendency to make skin tones look a bit smudgy every now and then. But some up close shots were amazingly detailed. It was so clear you could see every line, wrinkle, and pore in a person's face as if they were standing right in front of you. Too bad it just didn't stay that way the entire time.

Audio - 4.5

Being a drama, dialogue takes up a majority of the sound stage. However, I was pleasantly surprised at how well discrete sound effects and music were placed throughout the entire length of the film in this DTS-HD 7.1 track. The side and rear speakers actually had quite a bit of directionality in terms of very subtle dings, taps, and other various background noises, which may seem like overkill for a drama, but impressive, nonetheless. Overall sound is very crisp, and I'd even say it's just short of demo'ing a 7.1 setup. I subtract that extra half point because, well, dramas aren't really demo quality material anyway. Great effort by Lionsgate, though.

Extras - 2.5

Only two segments are presented in widescreen SD, one about production of the movie, the other about the actual story. They're interesting to a degree, but hardly worth watching aside for a little trivia.

Overall - 4.0

The Bank Job is a very good heist movie that better showcases the acting abilities of Jason Statham. It's not quite on par with other titles branching from the Guy Ritchie/Matthew Vaughn mold, but there's enough drama, thrills, and even some sensuality in this particular one to keep you entertained if you're looking for a refreshing change of pace to get the absurdities of Transporter 2 or Crank out of your head. The video is a bit finicky, but the audio is excellent, making The Bank Job a solid recommendation for heist/thriller fans.",1233273600,,4107,4.5997267759562845
3436098,4,B0019EXZY4,"In the midst of a whole heck of a lot of action thrillers in which the emphasis is squarely on how much demolition can be done--and by the way, here's a special feature to show how--The Bank Job, while in fact including that, focuses on the human element much more than these other movies and comes out a winner for it.

The premise is novel and Jason Statham reveals aspects of a character he hasn't really portrayed before--someone with smarts enough to talk his way through some gritty situations, as well as someone who cheats on his wife with a former colleague and manages to get away with it. He's the soul of the movie, but it's a lot of fun to see David Souchet play a bad guy, very different from the terrorist bad guy in Executive Decision. In The Bank Job, Suchet sports a wig that can only be called a ""rug"" and interestingly enough, one of the special features is the director Roger Donaldson discussing all the work that went into defining the look of the movie, whose setting is 1970's London--including Souchet's hairpiece!

This is a reallly entertaining movie based, in fact, on a true story about robbers getting away with 4 million pounds, just to make sure upper level government officials secure some pretty scandalous photos which were stashed away in one of the bank's safety deposit boxes--i.e., robbers keep the cash as long as they turn over the photos.

Not as simple as might be thought; all kinds of complications arise, and that's where the fun is.

3436122,4,B0019EXZY4,"""The Bank Job"" may not be the greatest caper film ever made, but it is definitely a hugely entertaining one--that is, as long as you ignore plot holes and certain elements familiar in the gangster film genre. The heist film's story, reportedly based on the real crime ""The Baker Street Robbery"" that happened in London in 1971, is a bit too complicated with subplots about the royal family, corrupt cops, honest cops, a brothel and a political activist, but the fast-paced film is always light and captivating at the same time with the capable British cast.

Jason Statham is Terry Leather, happily married father of two daughters. He is also heavily in debt and needs money now. That is when his former girlfriend Martine Love (Saffron Burrows) shows up before him, offering a lucrative ""job"" to him. Actually, Martine has her own motives for supporting him. Little did Terry and his team realize that the bank's vault actually keeps some secrets the robbers really don't want to know.

The plot is full of twists and turns and it keeps a good pace throughout the film's 110 minutes. ""The Bank Job"" changes its tone in the second half where things get more tense and violent even though direct descriptions of violence are avoided. The entire cast did a good job, especially David Suchet as a chilling crime lord. Director Roger Donaldson, as in his ""No Way Out,"" is a skillful storyteller who manages to keep you interested in the story full of tension and suspense as well as incredible coincidences and plot holes (What happened to negatives?).

Perhaps the film ends too neatly and some parts look implausible. I don't know how much of the story is really ""based on truth,"" but ""The Bank Job"" is still an interesting and enjoyable ride. And try to spot Mick Jagger who briefly appears.",1230681600,,1790,4.767741935483871
3436123,4,B0019EXZY4,"I don't think I'll ever get tired of heist pictures, and if the heist picture also turns out to be a period piece, then my fan joy cup doth runneth over, brother! THE BANK JOB serves up grand larceny and its nasty aftermath. The film re-enacts the daring ""true-to-life"" robbery which went down in 1971, on Baker Street, East London. Back in the day, the Lloyds Bank heist made very big noise in British media, for a bit of time anyway, until the British authorities issued a D-Notice which effectively gagged the press. But it's cool, because now the whole dirty laundry can be aired out, merely by watching this movie. Because movies absolutely never lie.

What's in Safety Deposit Box #118? Why, the McGuffin, of course, in the form of explicit photos featuring a British royal princess caught engaged in the naughty. Now this isn't much of a spoiler as the film spells this out early on; that's what all those opening scenes of salacious frolic were all about. And these photos, locked away in Box #118 at Lloyds Bank, are presently owned by a civil rights activist, who's actually more notoriously identified as a ""slum landlord, a drug dealer, and a vicious pimp,"" if I'm quoting the film correctly. British Intelligence is aware of what's in Box #118, and it prevents them from hauling this local kingpin to the gallows (or whatever it is they did to blackhearted miscreants back in the day). Okay, so the dilemma for MI-5 (or MI-6, I don't think the film clarifies) is how to obtain these photos without causing a scandal? How about getting some villains to rob the bank, specifically the vault which holds the safety deposit boxes? Of course, the villains must never, never know about Box #118.

Enter Terry Leather (Jason Statham), a modest car lot owner with mischief in his past and currently owing the local loanshark, except that he's late with the dues. So he gets a visit from a duo of shakedown bullies. On a less painful note, Terry also gets a visit from lovely Martine Love (Saffron Burrows), a femme fatale type who Terry has known for years. Martine has a proposition for him and his shifty mates. And, yes, it concerns a bank job. So off they go, with the recruiting, and the scheming, and the execution of the thing, and the funny bits with the walkie-talkies. But Terry's a clever sort. He soon sniffs out that there's much more going on than a simple robbery. But when he and his chums realize how deep they're in it, well, after all, they're only small-time hoods... What chance have they got, going up against vicious thugs, crooked cops, and implacable government spooks? Oh, and a smut king?

Part of the charm is that these small-time hoods are mostly regular blue-collar dudes, of similar stock that produced them blokes what done THE FULL MONTY. Even the film title doesn't put on airs, getting right to the crux as it does. It's easy to root for these guys. Jason Statham, the leader of the pack, has always had screen presence and again brings his steel-wool stubble, balding dome and rugged quality to the role. That, this time, he also has a wife and two kids whom he obviously adores grounds him as a character and makes you root for him all the more. I like that Terry Leather isn't a mastermind, who's got every angle covered. When the crapcake comes down, he fails to save everyone. Terry has native street smarts, and this helps him out of several jams. But he also becomes the beneficiary of great good luck and outside circumstances.

I don't think THE BANK JOB rates as an instant classic, but it's a very good movie, and one I'll most definitely catch up with again. Taut, gritty storytelling presents us with several close scrapes and also moments which don't at all go our villains' way. The tension is ratcheted up in the second half of the movie, as we begin to see the brutal fallout of the heist. There's no doubting that THE BANK JOB, in a vicious-fist-to-the-gut sort of way, is more suspenseful than, say, those breezy Ocean capers. Here, the stakes feel more real, because the people feel more real. I also quite like the film's closing caption: ""The names of many of the people identified in this film have been changed to protect the guilty."" I wonder what really went down that time at Lloyds Bank, back in 1971. I guess, now and then, even the high muck-a-mucks deserve to engage in a bit of chickee-wang-wang... but, tsk tsk, those crazy royals...",1230681600,,4407,4.638924455825864

The heist is the idea of a woman played by Saffron Burrows, who has a specific and ulterior motive for wanting to rob a certain safe deposit box.

Jason Statham shows that he's grown as an actor in this one. He's moved beyond simply scowling and karate chopping people in the windpipe. His crew members are distinct and colorful, and they are extremely likeable despite their criminal acts.

This film isn't fancy. It's a sad story told simply and in straightforward fashion. It's not as polished as The Italian Job or as smarmy as Ocean's Eleven, Twelve and Thirteen. It's a no-frills tale that will leave you wondering at the lengths people will go to for wealth and to save their skin when they get in trouble.",1227830400,,929,4.491124260355029
3436126,2,B0019EXZY4,"The Bank Job has more nudity and blatant semi-porn than any movie I've seen in a while. Unless you're a thirteen year old male, or want to watch porn without the stigma of actually having to rent it, you might find this movie a bit boring. I'm all for period pieces that are free from cliched car chases, violent shoot-em ups, or two-dimensional characters, but sadly this movie lacks the former but without the compelling plot of a true drama. There is a haphazard quality to the film. At times I was expecting it to go the direction of Oceans 11 and be a 'lovable set of criminals' movie where each character contributes their set of skills to accomplish a goal; a sort of criminal 'magnificent seven.' The Bank Job starts down that path, but then abandons it in mid stream.

Aside from Jason Stratham's character, all of the criminal gang are faceless and pretty unremarkable in the end. There is little likability among them. Also, the stakes feel fairly low until near the end of the film, when they are jacked through the roof, contributing to the unbalanced quality of the narrative flow. Most importantly, one of the best plot elements is left relatively unexplored: the story of a female MI5 agent who has infiltrated a domestic terrorist organization. Deeper examination of her story would have provided a very interesting parallel to the main action.

Hats off to co-writers Dick Clement & Ian La Frenais for wrapping a taut thriller around that.

What struck me in the Extras is how Statham's managers picked and shepherded this film as a project for him.

3436128,5,B0019EXZY4,"Everybody enjoys a good heist flick, and this one is much better than most. Based on the true story of the 1971 robbery of a bank in London's Baker Street, it involves a group of small-time crooks who use ingenuity and imagination to make their big score by tunneling under the bank's vault. And this one turned out to be bigger even than the Great Train Robbery. Terry Leather, whose used car business is slightly bent, is recruited by a woman with whom he used to be involved -- who was strong-armed into it by MI-5, which actually wants to acquire the contents of one of the bank's safety deposit boxes, which includes some incriminating photos involving a Royal Person, which were taken by a Trinidadian hoodlum, whom the government is consequently powerless to arrest. Yes, stated like that, it's a somewhat complicated plot, but the characters explain everything very nicely along the way. Not all the characters survive the robbery's aftermath, but those who do pretty much get away with it -- and are mostly sympathetic, at that. One thing that makes this yarn especially enjoyable, at least to me, is that there are no big-name stars. In fact, Peter Bowles (whom I remember from _To the Manor Born,_ 25 years ago) is the only one I had even heard of. This means the actors are defined entirely by their roles here, and the result is almost like a documentary. The result is much preferable to the _Ocean's Eleven_ remake.",1226793600,,1430,4.701195219123506
3436129,4,B0019EXZY4,"""The Bank Job"", directed by Roger Donaldson

London, 1971; Terry Leather (Jason Statham) is a small time crook running a car lot and struggling to keep up with payments owed to a local loan shark. Terry needs something to push him over the thresh hold so he can secure the financial future of his wife and kids. Apparently timing is everything as an old acquaintance of his, Martine Love (Saffron Burrows) approaches him with an offer. It turns out that she has somehow managed to get some inside information on a bank. The alarm has been on the fritz and will be deactivated over a weekend allowing them the ability to enter a vault full of safe deposit boxes the contents of which will not likely be reported by the owners. Unbeknownst to Terry, the British government has a vested interest in the contents of one of the boxes which they can't access themselves as do some of the more powerful criminal elements of London. Terry quickly finds out that robbing the bank is only the beginning as the contents owners are not as quick to let go of their belongings as was originally thought...

""The Bank Job"" was a pleasant surprise and a smart move for lead character Jason Statham. He breaks his Kung-Fu, Transporter type cast with this role although he is reprising his ""Transporter"" role. ""The Bank job"" is loosely based on an actual bank robbery that took place in London but much of the story presented in the movie is conjecture and artful speculation as is stated in the special features and likely common knowledge for any who were around for the event or have studied it at all. This doesn't make the movie any less interesting or entertaining however and the viewer is given a reasonably complex plot that involves many local gangsters, crooked cops, political figures and a crooked social activists of the era.

The Good: The story was great and involves many people in a connect the dots of crooks, cops and politicians type of story with solid plot twists and turns. The cast all around gave great performances. As far as cinematography the movie looked great and sounded great as well.

The Bad: nothing memorable

3436131,3,B0019EXZY4,"A well paced flick with plenty of tense moments and a preponderance of twists, The Bank Job makes for a decent movie experience.

However, the pacing and twisting can't conceal that the film suffers from a lack of focus, both in narrative and theme. I felt Bank Job couldn't decide whether to be a light-hearted caper like 'Snatch' or a gritty crime drama like 'The Departed'. It attempts to be both and fails to be truly excellent at either.

The cast of characters grows quite quickly, and we don't have enough time to care about all of them as much as the film needs us to. The central love affair is also lacking. There are many such loose threads in Bank Job which show promise but are watered down and create nothing more than disorder.

A promising film that entertains but is ultimately forgettable. The special edition has some deleted scenes as extras, but they don't flesh out the movie. Standard DVD includes wide and full screen formats.",1223856000,,950,4.642857142857143

Roger Donaldson does a fine job directing this tightly edited crime thriller. It could have been another nifty heist film, except that once the heist is over, that's where it gets more interesting.

3436177,1,B0019EXZY4,"Within the first ten minutes of this move I felt that it could be a waste of 90 minutes of my life.  I was right.  Simply put, there are just better movies about bank robberies.  Such as Inside Man, with Clive Owen and Denzel Washington.  The Bank Job is very thin on plot and the development of the story line is slow and boring.  In addition, there is not any real action scenes to speak of.  Not in the traditional sense of blowing stuff up, cars chasing down the streets and fights, that is what keeps people entertained.  This movie rocked me, to sleep that is and made me second guess what I was watching it in the first place.

Since this movie is partly based on a true story I hope that the real bank robbery that took place was a lot more fun and adventurous than watching this movie.  Because overall there was absolutely nothing captivating about this movie.",1219017600,,870,4.354037267080745
3436178,5,B0019EXZY4,"What a great romp of a film!  It's essentially a crime film but with a sly sense of humour at times and with various wonderful plot twists.  It's also quite confronting at times.  It's always entertaining.

The film claims to be based on a true story.  The magnitude of the robbery on which it's based was greater than the Great Train Robbery.  Details were never allowed to be fully released as the crime had security implications.

So, let me back up a bit.  A group of small time criminals gets a tip off about a bank vault where the alarms have been temporarily tuned off.  They intend to dig a tunnel from an adjacent building and steal the contents of the various safe deposit boxes.  In spite of themselves, they succeed.  The money and jewels are stolen in the heist but so too are compromising photographs of Princess Margaret and others of various cabinet ministers.  Needless to say, the photos are more valuable to some people than the money.

Through a series of crosses and double crosses, the gang mainly but not totally succeeds.  Along the way, the plot twists and turns and the viewer is always kept guessing.  Jason Statham as the leader of the team is very convincing.  His beautiful accomplice Saffron Burrows provides some sexual tension to the story.  She is quite a revelation.

I recommend this film without question.  The British are very good at producing a crime thriller.  Hollywood could take a few lessons.  Do yourself a favour, go and see this film.",1218844800,,1482,4.666666666666667
3436179,3,B0019EXZY4,"This movie was not what I was expecting.  I thought it would be a typical heist film with lots of tension, planning and some humor and action thrown in, like the Ocean's movies or ""The Italian Job.""  Instead, it was slow.  VERY, very slow.

The movie is ""based"" upon a true story.  Which usually means a kernel of truth, and the rest is Hollywood.  However, in this instance there wasn't enough truth, or enough Hollywood!  Jason Statham plays Terry Leather, a slightly shady owner of a car shop, and loving family man.  Saffron Burrows plays his former love interest Martine who talks him and a few of his chums into a bank robbery for safe deposit boxes.  But, they are rank amateurs and only get away with it out of sheer dumb luck.  This should have been a source of humor in the story, but the set-up and execution took so long, with no real activity, that I found myself thinking, ""get on with it already!""  Terry is slightly suspicious of Martine's motives, but can't pass up this chance.  Unfortunately, half the film passes before they start tunneling to the bank, and there is no real planning during that time.  In fact, the trailer does an excellent job of giving you the plan for the entire heist, heck the entire movie including the few punchlines, in under 3 minutes!  The trailer makes the movie look action-packed.  Only, ALL the action from the film is in that trailer - literally.

None of the main characters except Terry are developed at all; they remain two-dimensional to the end.  This made it difficult to care about whether they lived or died, or even what their names were.  Instead, the film spends a lot of time introducing the nefarious crook Michael X (wannabe be Malcolm) who is untouchable because he's got scandalous photos of a royal.  That happen to be stored in a safe deposit box.  Then we meet Vogle, porn king of London, who stores his ledger of pay offs in a safe deposit box.  And the madam Sonja who stores compromising pictures of officials in a safe deposit box.  Gee, I wonder what Martine is after?  These villains are way over-the-top and almost ridiculously portrayed, but the rare instances of violence in the film are brutal and vividly real - reminding viewers that this heist really did occur, and people really did get murdered because of it.  It did not mesh well.  Nor did the gratuitous nudity that was peppered throughout the film.  In a comedic action movie, that's fine.  But, it was out of place here.

The movie did have some good points.  The cinematography, costumes and sets really captured the look and feel of the 70's.  The events of the true story, the greatest heist in British history, are very interesting (and would have made an awesome episode of Notorious, or other true crime tv show), and the last 20 minutes were excellent  as the crew tangles with crooks, MI-5, the police, and each other.  Everyone wants the photos, and everyone wants Terry and his crew dead.  The film closes with an epilogue of sorts - words appear on the black screen giving further fallout of the case.  This information was the best part of the film.

Since the official files on this case are still classified, there wasn't enough ""fact"" to flesh out the plot to support a full-length film.  This could have been much better if Hollywood had taken more liberties to inject some excitement into it.  I prefer Jason Statham in action roles like ""Transporter,"" or ""Crank,"" where he's kicking butt and stealing the show.  He was wasted in this family man role and he had zero chemistry with Burrows.  Overall, I'm glad I saw it but I should have passed on buying the DVD.  I probably won't watch it again, especially since there are NO extras on the single disc edition.  You get the film, set-up, trailer, and previews.  That's it.

3436181,5,B0019EXZY4,"Coinciding with the DVD release, a review in the Wall Street Journal suggested that this was a superb film.  And it IS a superb film but for reasons far different than what I anticipated - since the review was not exactly going into many details.  [Aside to the reviewer who complained about ""sex"" - duh, where?  I abhor those kinds of scenes and there was merely suggestiveness in this film rather than the boring full-blown sex that passes for ""entertainment"" these days.  Although I will concede that a couple of the violence scenes were not my cup of tea; I am not much into violence but it was easy to ignore the minor incidences because they did not go overboard and were not gratuitous in showing violence at every turn like one so often sees in films these days.]

One great thing about this movie is that everything is totally believable and realistic...you could actually imagine the things (good, bad, idiotic and otherwise) actually happening!  An excellent portrayal of people's pressure points - and why sometimes their actions are not driven from within but from without.  In spades.  It was just delightful from beginning to end in the characters whose stories were told.

I am a foreign film buff and this film is more in line with that type of film than the awful stuff that passes for ""entertainment"" from Hollywood.

By the end of the film, I was really hoping that the last scene(s) were true.  It was nice to believe, but one never really knows which parts are truly close to the fact and which are fiction for the audience to enjoy.  It did nail the 70's so brilliantly that I thought I was back reliving those days again - even though it was Britain and not the US.

Another bonus is that it managed to portray corruption a la LA Confidential, so if you liked that movie, then you will also enjoy this one - probably enjoy it more than LA Confidential because it is more believable from beginning to end.",1217980800,,1928,4.569767441860465

Everybody (the police and bad guys) was just sort of blundering around just like real life.

Jason Statham is very good, but the movie isn't particularly about him. It is a good ensemble caste. The writing, the pacing and filming is all good. The nudity surprises me, but it does set up the rest of the plot. Another neat thing is the the twist is the bank heist team gets into hot water, not only with the cops, but with dirty cops, the government, and some really bad guys in a pornography ring. The movie keeps me at the edge of my seat for most of the time.

I don't care if it was based on a true story. The Great Escape was based on a true story and it was great.

3436185,4,B0019EXZY4,"Jason Statham has become an action anti-hero icon. Beginning his film career with LOCK STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS, Statham continued on to film the TRANSPORTER films, CRANK and last year's WAR. The time has come for him to venture out of his pure action grind and head into the world of drama. He does so with the release this week of THE BANK JOB.

THE BANK JOB is the true story of a group of low level criminals in 1971 London who are recruited to rob a bank's safe deposit boxes. Without being aware, the group is hired to do so by the British Secret Service.

The Service' real reason for the heist is for these thieves to get a set of pictures showing Princess Margaret in an uncompromising position. Those photos belong to a black militant named Michael X (Peter De Jersey) and are his get out of jail free card when it comes to his trial. The pictures were stored there on the advice of London pornographer Lew Vogel. Unbeknownst to the Service, Vogel has his own valuable stored in the vault as well, a ledger that shows all of the payoffs to corrupt police in town.

An ex-model named Martine Love (Saffron Burrows), caught smuggling drugs, is recruited by the Service to pull off the heist in turn for her freedom. and in turn for her freedom. Martine starts the ball rolling and the criminals she chooses are an odd mixture of friends led by Terry Leather (Statham), a crook trying to go straight with a car dealership but at the same time in debt to the wrong people. The score will net him enough money to pay them off and be free.

The first part of the film details the group planning the robbery. It moves forward giving background on a multitude of players who all have something to hide and the evidence of it stored in the vault. From there we are transported to the actual heist which involves tunneling into the vault via an abandoned store two doors down.

As they tunnel their way in, they use a lookout to make sure no police arrive to check things out. But this lookout and his walkie talkie are picked up by a ham radio operator who gets the police involved. The only problem is which bank is it being looted?

The heist goes off without an arrest and the crooks head out to split the spoils of their deed. At the same time, a number of government officials (pictures of each at a local brothel part of the stolen property) get in on the case, the Service wants the pictures they started this whole thing for and Vogel wants his log book.

Can Terry and the gang get away with this robbery, the biggest since the great train robbery with an estimated $3 million stolen? Or will they find themselves squeezed between the real crooks, the Secret Service and the corrupt police? You'll have to watch to find out.

The entire cast does a fantastic job of not only settling into the skin of their characters but of playing the time period to perfection as well. Statham finally gets to show he has some acting chops which hopefully will lead to more roles like this one.

Director Roger Donaldson (DANTES PEAK, COCKTAIL, NO WAY OUT) does the story justice as well, bringing it to life on the screen. In his hands what could have been a boring caper film is instead filled with rich characters and situations that leave your palms damp with anticipation and a caring for the people involved. Sure they're thieves but you hope they get away with it.

Plenty of stories to go round, plenty of threads that are all tied up by films end and plenty of action for those who expect it. But in the end this movie gives more than mere action. It gives a true story a touch of heart.",1217030400,,3597,4.403614457831325

3436188,4,B0019EXZY4,"Set in London in the early 1970s, THE BANK JOB is based on real life events.  A group of would be criminals is set up by MI5 (or 6, no one can keep them straight) to rob a bank and regain compromising photos of a royal personage.  Unfortunately for our gang, not only were the photos in question (which were the ""property"" of corrupt revolutionary Michael X) kept in a safe deposit box at this bank, but so were the secrets and lies of many famous and infamous people, including the payola ledgers of a porn kingpin and the photo files of a well-placed local madam.  Everybody who was anybody, from the cops on the beat up to the Lords of the Realm, was implicated in some scandal by the evidence from this notorious bank robbery.

THE BANK JOB is a fun, exciting, tension-filled romp.  These amateur crooks catch more breaks and have more close calls than you would imagine possible.  While the film does slightly bog down on occasion, for the most part the pacing builds just the right amount of suspense with these twists and turns of fate.  In several places, my heart was actually racing.  By the end, our villains are the heroes, and everyone gets what they truly deserve.

I really liked the cinematography of this film.  THE BANK JOB actually looks like it was filmed in the 1970s.  At one point, I double-checked with my husband to confirm that it was a recent movie.  The effect used is very convincing, producing a very authentic look. The ensemble cast was quite good, performing as a cohesive unit, but no individual really standing out.

3436189,5,B0019EXZY4,"""The Bank Job"" stretches the truth of the 1971 heist of Lloyd's Baker Street Bank in London into a smart, entertaining political thriller. Ex-model Martine Love (Saffron Burrows) is having a fling with MI5 bureaucrat Tim Everett (Richard Lintern) when she lands in hot water over a drug charge. In exchange for her freedom, Martine convinces some old friends that the safe deposit vault at Lloyd's is ripe for the picking. Terry (Jason Statham) is a slightly shady car dealer with a history of small-time crime and a shine for Martine. Kevin (Stephen Campbell Moore) is a photographer ex-boyfriend, and Dave (Daniel Mays) and old pal. Together, they plot and execute a 4 million heist, but, unbeknownst to the thieves, the real danger lies in the secrets, not the money, that the safe deposit boxes hold.

""The Bank Job"" is a blend of fact, speculation, fabrication, and real events that have been connected in a highly speculative fashion. The bank robbery did happen more or less as presented, but there was apparently a D-notice issued by MI5 several days later that forbid the press from speaking further of the crime for reasons of national security. Even stranger, the thieves were eventually caught, convicted, and served prison sentences, but all in secret. Their names have never been revealed. Because no one knows who they are, the characters in the movie are fictional. The real robbery was certainly not orchestrated by MI5, who need only present a warrant if they want access to a safe deposit box, but the agency does seem to have taken an interest after the fact. The idea that photos of a frolicking royal were at the heart of the matter is based on secondhand information, and speculation about a connection to Michael Abdul Malik is due to his having a box in that Lloyd's vault.

The ""based on a true story"" tag in the movie's logo is misleading, but there were some strange and bewildering aspects to the Lloyd's Baker Street Bank robbery which remain mysterious to this day. ""The Bank Job"" takes the speculation, ties it all together with some pure fiction, and creates a top-notch political thriller with great 1970s period atmosphere. It's all very cynical toward government and law enforcement, and, in that way, perhaps it reflects the mood in 1971 and 2008 as well. Honorable thieves, corrupt cops, hypocritical security services and politicians, raunchy royals, sex, violence, greed, sleaze...this movie packs it all into a tight, suspenseful package. I'm surprised ""The Bank Job"" didn't do better at the box office. With plenty of intrigue and thrills, i's the best movie I've seen so far in 2008.

The DVD (Lions Gate 2008 single disc): The single disc edition includes 2 featurettes, a feature commentary, and a theatrical trailer. ""Inside the Bank Job"" (16 min) is a making-of documentary that interviews director Roger Donaldson, writers Ian Le Frenais and Dick Clement, producers, cast, and some crew about the film's tone, locations, production design, story, and the large cast. ""The Baker Street Bank Raid"" (15 min) is about the real robbery. The ham radio operator who picked up the thieves' transmission is interviewed, as well as some historians, journalists about the robbery and the suspicious aspects of the case. There is a feature commentary by director Donaldson, actress Saffron Burrows, and composer J. Peter Robinson. It's a constant commentary but not very focused or informative.

3436202,4,B0019EXZY4,"THE BANK JOB  is first class entertainment - a well-written script (Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais) with many twists and turns, face paced direction (Roger Donaldson), and a reliable cast of actors who know this genre well.  AND it is all based on a true event from 1970 when a bank heist in London resulted in a number of falls of the heads of government who were locking away their 'dirty underwear' in the safety deposit boxes of a quiet bank on Baker Street.  A great, unique movie this is not, but it is one that provides close to two hours of complex but highly suspenseful antics that keep the viewer glued to the screen.

Terry Leather (Jason Statham) isn't making it as a car salesman and has debts to pay to the crime world. He meets an old sweetheart Martine Love (Saffron Burrows) who proposes that Terry and his friends rob a bank that is due for security repairs and a fairly surefire safe means to instant wealth.  Martine just happens to be working with a fellow who wants some rasty photographs of Princess Margaret in questionable sexual liaisons and has Martine setup the 'easy heist'.  Terry and friends agree to the too-good-to-be-true venture and begin to burrow into the bank vault under cover of night and clever means. Once the 'keystone cops' of London arrive on the scene the comedy portion begins, but when Terry, Martine and friends successfully achieve their goal, all manner of complications occur and the ways in which police and governmental corruption color the picture  makes for a solid ending.  As a fine addendum, the true facts of this actual heist and resulting events are flashed on the screen before the closing credits.

The cast (including such fine actors as  Stephen Campbell Moore, Daniel Mays, Alki David, James Faulkner et al) seems to have a great time with the caper and there is just the right balance between suspense and comedy to make the movie work.

3436203,5,B0019EXZY4,"Set in the swinging London of 1971, ""The Bank Job"" is a riotously fun heist film that's loosely based on actual events.  Known then as the ""walkie-talkie bank job,"" it was the biggest bank robbery of its time and probably the most controversial.  Apparently, the loot from this heist did not consist merely of cash and jewels, but some rather more important documents that could embarrass the royal family.

The heist is prompted, really, by the British government's inability to incarcerate a criminal slumlord and pimp, Michael Abdul Malik, known as Michael X (Peter De Jersey).  A self-styled gadfly and pseudo-Black-Panther wannabe from Trinidad, he holds a get-out-of-jail card in the form of photographs he'd taken earlier of a Very Improper Personage (later to surface as Princess Margaret) in very compromising...uh...positions with lovers during an island escapade.  These photos are kept in his safe deposit box at Lloyds Bank.  Also in one of the boxes is a ledger kept by the smut king Lew Vogel (played by the versatile David Suchet), detailing payoffs to crooked cops, and another box kept by a `Madame,' the contents of which depict certain MPs in...uh...non-parliamentary scenarios.  Evidently, everyone's been a naughty boy and girl.

Meanwhile, a former model with East End roots, Martine Love (Saffron Burrows), is aided by a her lover, an MI5 spook, in beating the rap for transporting drugs into the UK.  In exchange, she has to call on her petty criminal friends to break into the Lloyd's Bank vault and retrieve the compromising photos of said VIP.  Innocent of the true motive behind the heist, her friend Terry Leather (Jason Statham) agrees to the proposition, himself needing fast cash to pay off debts to some scary thugs.  The crew consists of Terry, Martine, Terry's friends Kevin Swain (Stephen Campbell Moore), Dave Shilling (Daniel Mays), and Eddie Burton (Michael Jibson), and outside help in a Maj. Guy Singer (con artist extraordinaire), and Bambas (a tunneling expert).  The plan is to take over the lease of a handbag store, Le Sac, and tunnel from its underground to the chicken take-out store adjacent to the bank, and finally into the bank's vault itself.  (Their total loot was reportedly 4M.)  Terry suspects that Martine is hiding something, and as things get even more complicated, the crew finds themselves chased by the MI5, the cops, and Vogel's henchmen, as well as engaging in a bargain brokered by Lord Mountbatten himself!  (Absurdly hilarious, but who knows?  Real life is stranger than fiction.)

Terrific acting all throughout, especially by Statham, and lots of twists and turns to keep things fresh.  Swinging London was depicted extraordinarily well; production values were superb.  A bit of comic dialogue and scenes in between ups the fun factor.  One of the DVD extras which shows photos of the actual crime scene, especially the tunnel dug through Le Sac, were quite interesting.  Comparing them to the film, the meticulous duplication of details was remarkable.  The heist itself was audacious and entertaining, but it's the back-stories that bring real excitement into this.  The actual heist is a true story but the damning photos are mere conjecture.  A D-Notice (a sort of gag-the-press action) was issued at the time of the real events and it never surfaced as fact that the photos were indeed of Princess Margaret.  She did have a party-girl image in the 1960s, and her exploits were fodder for the British rags.  Michael X himself was hanged in Trinidad in 1975, but his file still remains closed until 2054.  Though the robbery made the headlines, it quickly died down only after a few days.  What was really behind all this?  Well, that's left for the viewer to speculate.  After all, that's part of the entertainment.",1216512000,,3790,5.036918138041734

3436205,5,B0019EXZY4,"Actually this film does not involve the Sweeney Metropolitan Police Flying Squad) but it does have Jason Statham doing a really good impersonation of Grant Mitchell from Eastenders.

Personally I think this film is a complementary piece of work to a film of a few years ago, Scandal, as both movies give a very convincing portrayal of Britain in the 1960's and '70's. with the sleazy concoction of political power, the Establishment, the secret services and the filtering down through to the lowest criminal classes.

Purists amy argue that some of the scenes in the film are anarchronistic but one must accept that given the tremendous changes which have transformed London in the last fifty years, some artistic licence is inevitable.

The film reminds me in a sense of the Long Good Friday, a superb movie with Bob Hoskins, Helen Mirren and a short appearance from a young Piers Brosnan in that the vital essence of Britain's capital. Also every aspect of this film is excellent, plot, screenplay, cinematography, acting, credibility everything. The language is a tad worse than in your average movie but it certainly seems appropriate.

I have no hestitation in recommending this film to a discerning adult audience.",1216166400,,1220,5.054726368159204
3436206,4,B0019EXZY4,"""Truth is stranger than fiction.""  This saying is given believable weight in `The Bank Job'  Sort of the British equivalent of  `<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Serpico-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B00006JU7T/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Serpico (Widescreen Edition)</a>' (with the notable exception of any honest true-life players) the film centers on the life of debt-ridden car salesman, Terry Leathers (Jason Statham), a man driven to settle his debts with a brilliant bank robbery scheme that's so riddled with twists of good and ill luck, he could have made odds' makers throw in their chips.

Back in the day, 1971, debt handlers were not a pretty sight in the U.K.  Today some people get insistent or harassing calls for delinquency, but no one comes to smash our display car models to extort a debt.  So starts the justifying context of Terry, who makes contact with Martine Love (Saffron Burrows), a woman who'd like to erase her own debt to society by obtaining some incriminating photos found in a safety deposit box at a branch of Lloyd's Bank.

It starts smart enough.  They choose nearby Chicken Inn as posturing new owners, pretending to remodel for a new business.  If that seems water tight, then tension comes quickly when a constable raps on their door to politely announce their neighbors are complaining about the jackhammer racket of their renovation.  Clever also turns to chaos once again when a roof observer radios his reports below, an radio operator quickly gets wise to them, records their proceedings, and contacts the police.  Doomed?  Not yet, there's more.

In the interweaving drama, there are conflicting parties with at least as much at stake.  One of the deposit boxes has scandalous photos of Princess Margaret and Tripoli's elusive London radical, Michael X.  In another safety deposit box is a set of photos linking an escort to a high political official who has a taste for kinky behavior.  If that weren't enough, at Berns' steamy brothel and adult nightclub, police regularly take bribes to keep the place operational, and the owner is astute enough to write down every payout on a bookkeeping ledger.  Where does he keep it?  In one of the safety deposit boxes, of course.

I won't let on if crime indeed pays, but I will indicate some of the price.  Kidnapping one of the key robbers, the debt sharks keep up their heinous extortion.  While negotiating for their release, Terry must also work with officials and police, each needing their own goods.  The government wants to keep high officials and Princess Margaret from scandal, and the police want to recapture the ledger implicating them to illegal graft.  Murder and counter negotiations take place in spades.  How and to whom?  Wild horses couldn't drag it out of me.

Will Terry and his cohorts escape with their lives and their visas?  Who comes out on top and who on the bottom?  Will there be leaks of the bank robber ""tapes"" to the press?  Will Terry be able to keep his family together and save his marriage?  Tune in to the movie and find out for yourself.  There's much more to be revealed.  How true is it?  I don't know for certain, but you get those written narratives provided at the end, filling us in on what happened to the key people and organizations the movie documents, so it must be close.  Significantly, during the credits, it reads, ""The names have been changed to protect the guilty.""  Incriminating evidence for a true tale told well.

The timing, the portrayals, and the material make for a solid and pleasurable viewing experience. (Written [Dick Clement & Ian La Frenais) and directed (Roger Donaldson) with equal finesse.)

3436207,4,B0019EXZY4,"If you've seen any of Jason Statham's past films than you've effectively seen his newest DVD release: The Bank Job.  More The Italian Job than Crank, though, The Bank Job is action packed, but it, too, is not simply a ""shoot-em-up"" popcorn flick; much thought goes into who the men and women on-screen are and what their motivations are for getting into the line of work that they do.  Full of mind games (between characters and with the audience) and twists involving the sordid sexual histories of important government power players, The Bank Job is flashy and sensational in a way that screams Hollywood formula... and yet it was based on actual evens.

Directed by Roger Donaldson, The Bank Job attempts an intricate look at the elaborate layers of covert deceit that supposedly went into the United Kingdom's greatest bank robbery of all time.  By all accounts, Statham's Terry Leather-- a man in over his head with some very bad people who gets hired to rob a safety deposit box and unknowingly stumbles onto some compromising photos of members of the royal family--should be a sexy character.  He (partially just due to Statham's bright eyes and wry smile) is somehow soft and gentle (at least by comparisons to some of Statham's earlier work) as the family man who just got in over his head and is now forced into a new way of life.  He flits between puppy dog eyes and suave masculinity, offering subtle hints of the rough and tumble bad guy persona for which women (and okay, a few men) everywhere have fallen.

The Bank Job tries desperately to be a cool and sexy film, and in most areas it does succeed.  Donaldson and his Cinematographer, Michael Coulter, captured the essence of the 1970s with everything from shot design to color schemes to focusing on the wardrobe and scenery, all which screamed ""period piece.""  In keeping with the thematic emphasis of showcasing new media and technology, The Bank Job was shot in HD, which gives its images a crisp, clear view of a somewhat hazy world: on one hand, Leather is a petty criminal, committing a serious offense, but on the other, he is taking down those far worse than he, and he is doing it for all the right reasons.  Most importantly, though, The Bank Job makes the audience yearn to be apart of its world, even when its seedy: you want to live in that era, and you want to be in Leather's company.

The use of ""cutting edge"" technology in The Bank Job should also be something about which to get excited: deemed the ""Walkie Talkie Robbery"" of 1971, the star of the event is really the ham radio that picks up their own radio signals and clues in the police force.  Unfortunately Donaldson does often choose to linger instead on the extremely literal depictions of what's sexy on screen: a topless woman swimming in the ocean, for example, which is an image that opens the film, as well as his female lead, Saffron Burrows, as the temptress who propositions Leather with the job offer.  At times the film is a bit gratuitous.  Though each crew member (from Stephen Campbell Moore to James Faulkner) has their own back story which manages to get semi-fleshed out, as a whole The Bank Job follow Leather's journey, and therefore his friends fall by the wayside a little bit, getting somewhat lost in the in the stereotypical traps of fictionalizing a real life drama into an action flick.

The two-disc version of The Bank Job on DVD includes a commentary by Donaldson, Burrows, and Composer J. Peter Robinson, which isn't half bad if you can get past the fact that the film's star is noticeably absent from the recording session.  There are the obligatory deleted scenes, all which total out at under ten minutes and don't offer anything that isn't already depicted in the film in a more succinct way, making it pretty obvious why these were left on the proverbial cutting room floor.  The standard behind-the-scenes featurette this time is ""Inside The Bank Job,"" which is just as straight forward as it sounds but does offer some insight into the project past simple reminiscence or fluffy hype.  However, ""The Baker Street Bank Raid"" is hands-down the most interesting ""extra:"" a featurette for those who are interested in true crime, in addition to cinema's depiction of such events, as it focuses on historical footage and interviews from the 1970s, cutting back and forth between the real life bank robbery and how it was depicted in the film.  The only special feature on the second disc is a digital copy of the film, making the extra few dollars you will spend on that version entirely superfluous.",1216080000,,4574,4.723618090452261

What they don't know is that they're being used by government agents to retrieve some incriminating photos of a princess caught in the act of engaging in some undiscriminating sexual behavior.  Before they know it, they are being hunted down by government agents, police and mobsters who were storing their own incriminating evidence in those very same safety deposit boxes.

Don't get the feeling that your getting an ""Oceans"" type heist movie.  No high tech gadgetry or disguises here.  It's shovels and jackhammers, a good ol' get your hands dirty robbery.

3436222,4,B0019EXZY4,"THE BANK JOB is a bit of a throwback to a different kind of crime movie.  In this day and age, most heist movies are super high-tech (THE ITALIAN JOB, any of the OCEAN'S movies) and usually an occasion for big name stars to do a little slumming.  They may be lots of fun, but they are also sleek and modern.  But THE BANK JOB takes place in 1970, and it is a gritty little period piece.

There's no mistaking it for a film actually MADE in 1970.  There's too much graphic sex and nudity, the language is too harsh. Also, star Jason Statham's hair isn't what you'd see in the 70s.  But it feels very specific to its time and is refreshingly low tech.  Jackhammers, shovels, walkie-talkies.  It's in a time WAY before computers on every desk and cell phones in every pocket.  No internet.  No email.  Just rotary dial telephones.  A time before criminals worried about leaving DNA evidence behind.

It's based on or inspired by the true story of the most lucrative bank robbery in British history (some 4 million pounds).  The robbers dug a tunnel underneath a couple of shops and emerged beneath the vault of a branch of Lloyds bank.  They opened all the safety deposit boxes and disappeared with a wide and sundry list of items.  Apparently, many, many of the box owners declined to tell what items were stolen from them, so the filmmakers have created a rather elaborate scheme involving blackmail, homegrown terrorists, prostitution and miscellaneous indiscretions at the highest levels of government to ""explain"" why so many folks were too ashamed to admit what they kept stored in the vault.  It's a complex little plot, but it is neatly put together and actually fairly fun to follow.

Jason Statham is the nominal leader of a gang of minor criminals who are lured into going for ""one big job"" by Saffron Burrows, a former school chum who grew up and left their low-class neighborhood to become a model.  After a serious brush with the law, she's given a second chance by agreeing to convince her old chums to rob this bank.  Easy pickings, she tells them.  Of course, she has been directed to recover a specific, highly incendiary packet of photos.  Photos that several warring factions want to get, and they'll use just about any means at their disposal to do so.

We've got a wide assortment of bad guys, ranging from simply nasty to murderously insane.  Into this brew our group of eager but mostly incompetent robbers are thrown.  With a mixture of luck, force of will and some innate, brute cleverness, they muddle their ways through.

I don't want to reveal too many specifics of the plot, because the primary fun of this film IS the plot. The characters are loosely drawn...we just get enough on everyone to stereotype them.  The movie is packed with characters, and moves at such a brisk pace that there really isn't time for depth.  There are some super tense scenes when a ham radio operator picks up the conversations between the robbers and their lookout...will the cops figure out which bank is being robbed in time?  There are lots of unusual touches like that throughout the movie.

THE BANK JOB also features Jason Statham's best performance to date.  I realize that might not being saying much.  His prior films, whether good or not, didn't exactly thrive on his subtleties as a performer, but rather on his brute persona and fighting skills.  In this film, I believe he's finally emerged with a credible, engaging performance.  Except for one brief scene at the end, he never is compelled to violence, so he has to rely on his wits and his charm.  Both are on display here, so even if the movie isn't a huge hit, I think Statham might start taking on some more juicy work in the future.

This is an adult caper movie.  As I hinted, it deserves its R rating.  But it sure is a lot of fun, and while it no doubt will be gone soon from the collective memory, it is well worth your time.",1205712000,,3907,4.576368876080692
3436223,4,B0019EXZY4,"The British secret service is anxious to retrieve lurid photos of Princess Margaret caught in a threesome while on vacation in the Caribbean.

Also the fact that it is based on such an extreme and outrageous true story makes it more interesting. This is a darker and more violent side of British society than most Americans are usually exposed to.

3436224,4,B0019EXZY4,"Despite a weak, B-rate feeling opening, The Bank Job manages to pull itself up and shape into a wildly engaging, gritty, realistic heist film that holds nothing back and does not have the comfy, playful feel of the Ocean's films. And here's the kick: its' based on a true story.

Yes that's right, it is based on the true story of the 1971 Baker Street Bank robbery in England, considered to be one of the biggest bank robberies in British history. Terry Leather (played by Jason Statham) is in a spot of trouble. He owes money to some criminal bigwig, so when an old friend Martine Love (Saffron Burrows) comes along with a proposition for him and his two mates to rob a small bank's safety deposit box vault, he takes it. As they begin their job everything fits perfectly into place and moves along at a smooth pace...an almost too smooth pace as very quickly the little proposition spirals madly out of control with secrets and double crossing being revealed, all before coming to a surprising ending.

I was disappointed that characters were not as fleshed out and developed as I would have liked. However, Terry is done very well and I feel Jason Statham, the most underrated action movie star, has an almost Bruce Willis-type presence.

The acting and dialogue was good, Saffron Burrows gives a bristling nuanced performance, and Terry's two mates Daniel Mays and Stephen Campbell Moore both bring a balanced energy to gang of criminals.

The Bank Job is a rough, somewhat violent heist film that does not have a fun feel to it, however as it picks up from the mediocre beginning it holds you with a raw intensity that rewards you even more once the credits roll as you read the real life aftermath of the characters.",1204848000,,1723,4.657894736842105
3436225,4,B0019EXZY4,"Sporting complex consequences for a relatively straightforward plot, The Bank Job remains intriguing throughout as each set-up leads to ever more suspenseful twists for the likeable group of ragtag antiheroes. Over-thorough character introductions cause a slower build in the early stages of the heist, but such complications likely arise from fewer liberties taken with the ""based on a true story"" events, and the result is a fascinating look at criminals, the corrupt, and those least guilty.

It is 1971 in East London and a fateful bank robbery begins to take shape. In order to remove the threat of radical gangster Michael X, government officials devise a plan to rob a bank on Baker Street and retrieve damning photographs from his possession. To keep the heist untraceable back to them, an independent group of thieves, led by car dealer Terry (Jason Statham) and the cunning Martine (Saffron Burrows) are unwittingly thrown into a deadly battle against corrupt officials and London's criminal underworld.

Jason Statham isn't your typical leading man, yet ever since Guy Ritchie's early films he has managed to keep coming back with bigger and better roles and is now thought of as an action film star. However it's here, in darker thrillers, that he finds a more sincere presence, especially as thief and scoundrel Terry. Each moral flaw creates a more dimensional character, and one worth rooting for.

The language of the film is genuinely intriguing, as it captures wonderfully wry British slang. Cheeky sod, 12-inch mutton dagger, a bit of bother, usual skullduggery and things turning a-custard are but a few of the verbal jousts that occur between the main characters. Devoid of euphuisms, these apparently authentic words make the dialogue a particularly potent piece of the puzzle.

The entire subplot about Michael X and his blackmailing of the British government is useful in its supposed tie to facts, but as filmed scenes in the movie, they are hardly necessary. Photographs of a princess caught in the act of promiscuity are at the root of the blackmail plot, which then goes on to include further damaging materials from Sonia Bern's brothel, also of factual importance, but equally unnecessary in the film. Michael X's involvement could have been entailed in a briefing by the 506 crew, who spill out the usual generic explanations of villains, and even Bern's entanglement could have been narrated through the details of the photos. While most of these moments have their entertainment value, essentially they serve to drag out the film's running time.

They say truth is stranger than fiction, and The Bank Job definitely falls into that category. Pimps, thieves, spies, and government officials all collide in a robbery gone right and then terribly wrong, lending the inquisitive to ponder over how much (or little) is fabricated in this thriller. The robbery itself is merely the setup to an intricate conclusion, even though the film takes time to create plenty of suspense throughout the not-so-carefully planned heist. Though the people making demands continually change, our attention is always seated with Jason Statham's unusually intense performance. When the credits roll and the explanation that ""the names have been changed to protect the guilty"" flashes onscreen, we realize what a delightfully flourished yet entertaining tale of ""doing the wrong thing"" The Bank Job really is.
