8041133,3,B0006BGVVK,The DVD is in Italian and is a montage of pele's plays beginning in 1958 through 1970 though it includes some shots of his play with The New York Cosmos in 1975.  The real problem is that the DVD quality is really quite poor and incorrectly claims that there are English subtitles:  It is Italian with Italian subtiles. Still it is a moderately enjoyable documentary for Pele fans and it does show some of his more memorable goals from unusual angles.,1234483200,,451,4.555555555555555
8041134,4,B0006BGVVK,"This is an Italian documentary from 1999. It does not concentrate too much on Pel's World Cup games and offers a nice selection of his brilliant goals. There are interviews with Rivera, Sormani and Chinaglia. Image quality is not very good and my DVD copy always stops at a certain point, where I have to push the STOP and PLAY buttons to resume playing. The Brazilian documentary ""Pel eterno"" from 2004 is, of course, much better and far more complete, but unfortunately it is not available in Europe or the US (I got my copy via Ebay).",1104796800,12,537,4.546391752577319
