5966486,5,B00F3LSXPA,"I have seen Pride of the Yankees many, many times and the story is a classic and first rate. I have also seen Cobb once but not in it's entirety. Very well put together but raunchy in many parts due to visuals and language. Tommy Lee Jones is very good in his part as Ty Cobb but still this movie is  over the top in inappropriateness. I bought this mainly for Pride of the Yankees. I would
never recommend Cobb for anyone under 21.",1406160000,6,432,4.142857142857143
5966487,2,B00F3LSXPA,"The Pride of the Yankee's is the quality that you would expect from Gary Cooper.  However, why they would have ever combined such a piece of trash about Cobb I'll never know.  Cobb was full of foul language, poor acting with not much of a story line from beginning to about half way through the film when I couldn't take it any more.  You'd be better off buy just the Pride of the Yankee's because this combo is no deal.",1399680000,,420,4.225
5966488,5,B00F3LSXPA,Both movies were In there And it cost a lot less to buy them together for some reason then it did to buy them each individually.,1389830400,4,128,3.9615384615384617

5966491,4,B00F3LSXPA,"Twin movies about to exact opposites in sports legend.  Gehrig was a great fellow and the movie is sweet, but more a tribute than anything else.  I don't really think it has aged as well as some classics.  Cobb is told in an amazing fashion, as a grumpy old man looks back on his life and career.  Tommy Lee Jones puts in an excellent performance and as a viewer I was quite impressed.  So nice guy = average movie.  Tough guy = good movie.",1471651200,,440,4.178571428571429
5966492,5,B00F3LSXPA,"Bought for Pride of the Yankees...classic.  Cobb is a pretty good movie, as well.",1471219200,,81,4.785714285714286
5966493,4,B00F3LSXPA,"Baseball fans in general, and Yankee fans specifically, will likely enjoy Pride of the Yankees. Yes, it becomes a bit sappy, especially by todays standards, but has relatively good acting and tells a roughly-right story of one of baseball's legends. There are some real Yankee players in the movie, including Babe Ruth, who play themselves in the picture. Cobb is another story. Literally. The contention that the film portrays Cobb accurately is being disputed. That aside, even assuming the portrayal of Cobb the man is spot on, I came away with the feeling that the film was relying a lot on the purportedly crude and lascivious nature of the main character instead of his prowess on the field. Maybe that's how Cobb really was in truth, but in this day-and-age of gratuitous ugliness one cannot escape the suspicion it is not a true account of Cobb the ball player, or there is a concerted effort here to distort his personal character. In any event I don't think this is a film I'll watch again anytime soon.",1470441600,,1013,4.761363636363637

5966495,5,B00F3LSXPA,"The price was great for these two movies. I kind of only wanted ""Cobb"", but I could never find it cheaper than normal DVD prices (both movies are great though, so I'm not complaining). The DVD was in great quality, plays great.",1463529600,,227,4.428571428571429

5966497,5,B00F3LSXPA,"Here we have two different stories regarding two different figures in baseball's history. The humble Henry Louis Gehrig & the racist Ty Cobb. Ty Cobb did not pull any punches with his opinions. Here was a man who went through the trauma of his father being killed and lying about what happen to protect his mother. His opinions on how the game of baseball should be played. When asked by his biographer his opinion about Babe Ruth he replied: ""He could run pretty good for a fat man."" He could have extended his career a little longer but as so few athletes he hung his cleats up. Gehrig showed the humility and calls and the self determination is setting the most consecutive games played mark until a savage disease took him from us too soon.",1456531200,,744,4.518518518518518

5966500,4,B00F3LSXPA,Ty Cobb was a really good movie!. It came with the pride of the Yankees. Unrealistic as Lou Gerrig looked about 40 through the whole movie. Still a decent movie for the period it was made.,1444262400,,188,4.25
