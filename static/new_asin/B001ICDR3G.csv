3647645,5,B001ICDR3G,"My customers are continually looking for a great (not good) travel film that conveys the truths of travel around this awesome planet. I think I finally found one that I can recommend.

The story is simple enough of two friends traveling around the globe spreading the ashes of a deceased friend. Along the way they encounter those situations and people that so often intertwine that travel story you hear someone talk about; Beautiful and exotic locations, strange events and even funnier people, exquisite and bizarre cuisines, and a plethora of the stories one hears while traveling from other trotters. Some of their visited locales include South America, Germany, Vietnam, and Thailand. Along the way, we are afforded our main character's narration of his travel, no matter how humiliating.

The film was made entirely with one small digital camera and the results were outstanding. The scenery never suffers (from not having million dollar cameras and crews) and the whole feel of the film makes everything believable. The DVD has plenty of extras about how they made the film (a small sampling can be seen in the credits), and even some deleted scenes.

My customers are immediately attracted to the DVD as the cover art shows 20 or so of those indie film festival wreaths on it. That aside, it shows the successful results one can achieve on a small budget, while providing an inspirational film about the tangible human benefits of traveling. Some light humor, the normal language barrier missteps, and the meaning of enjoying the ride all come together here - reminds me of how some of my world travels went. Hope you enjoy it.",1233273600,6,1636,4.941818181818181

8310763,4,B001ICDR3G,"World traveler Charlie tries to convince his buddy Cliff to join him on his next trip, to the Full Moon Party in Thailand.  Cliff, a homebody who doesn't ""get"" the allure of international travel, at first demurs, but then learns that his best friend, Paul, has died.  Cliff decides to take Charlie up on his offer as long as they can spread some of Paul's ashes in their stops along the way, thereby fulfilling Paul's desire to travel the world.  What ensues is variously funny, scary, preposterous, and ridiculous, but in the end, besides leaving bits of Paul behind, the trip has profoundly changed Cliff.

Be sure to watch the end credits for some behind-the-scenes, making-of-Last Stop footage.",1402704000,,698,4.889830508474576
8310764,2,B001ICDR3G,"A simple watching of a simple story is about booze, one-night-sex and ridiculing the local habits of different countries while spreading ashes of a ceased person in some of them.

Probably, importing an organic substance is illegal to many of these places as well as a tourist behavior screened. A link between affording-the-world-hanging-around is unclear also they were called ""friends"" in a film short description.

Somehow mirroring reality those tourists' impressions.",1347667200,,473,5.647887323943662
8310765,4,B001ICDR3G,"I bought this movie for a friend, who'd heard about it elsewhere. When it arrived, we watched it together. It's funny and engaging, and at times very heartwarming. It's no wonder that it's won so many Independent Film Awards! I liked it so much, I bought a copy for myself!",1339632000,,273,4.48
8310766,5,B001ICDR3G,"Yes, the cover is plastered with kudos and awards. But they seem possibly justified. This little film looks like almost a documentary. The stars are also the filmmakers, and they traipsed around the world with a tiny camera making movie stars out of real people, feeding them dialogue on the fly and then filming and editing the results into a charming tale. There is no plot, just a series of episodes in various exotic locales where the stars get into not too serious trouble. Had this been real, things probably would not have turned out so innocuously. Still, you will enjoy the non-Hollywood piece of work if you like little indie films with mild mannered sensibilities.",1305072000,,675,4.827586206896552
8310767,1,B001ICDR3G,"About the DVD:  I'm real disappointed.  When I popped it in I watched the movie, then checked out the menu options.  Messed around there for a couple minutes & had to leave.  Put the dvd in the next day to look at the menu options again and no matter what I do I can't get to the menu at all.  I can watch the movie if I set the dvd player to autoplay, but still can't get to the menu before or afterward.  Lame.

About the movie:  The movie is mediocre at best.  It starts by saying it's based on a true story, then the entire movie is one ridiculous & juvenile event after another, beginning to end.  Horrible acting and really annoying actors.  Repetitive and mundane lines, and gimmicky plot events.  Some of its many wastes scenes involve looking at a turd in a toilet bowl, a bug on a wall, and our ""actors"" sleeping.  I can't even give it real credit for scenery because the vast majority of the time our actors are hanging around indoors, running around a city, or too ""adventurous"" out in the scenery to actually take it in.

I eat, sleep, & breathe world travel.  Wish the movie would have given my soul something satisfying.",1304208000,,1135,4.312796208530806

8310769,4,B001ICDR3G,"The ashes of Paul topic is an extremely minor plot element - scattering the ashes is just a pretext for two twenty-something buddies to travel around the world, see interesting places, meet interesting people and have interesting adventures. The story is surprisingly engaging.  Kind of makes you want to jump on a plane and go.",1247270400,,328,4.963636363636364
