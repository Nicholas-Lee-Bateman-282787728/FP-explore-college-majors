7664651,5,B01BORHRIU,"I enjoyed this film and I appreciate Mr. Deutschle's efforts to take the viewer with him on his journey back to the village where he lived as a science teacher with th Peace Corps 34 years ago. I was relieved when the family he left behind were still alive and doing relatively well. I'm sure it was somewhat awkward for everyone after so many years and so many life changing events. However, Mr. Deutschle was absolutely right to return and I am so grateful he decided to bring along a film crew so we could see it for ourselves and get a small taste of what he found so important in helping him to become who he is today. I am curious about the school. Has it been completed? The photo I have seen of the town looks like it has improved even since the filming of the documentary in 2012. It's been five years; is Mr. Deutschle planning another return for a follow-up on this story? Has he done better at keeping in contact with his Nepali family? With the village now being on the grid for electricity and the school's computers, I should find it much easier to stay in touch. Thank you for this film, Mr. Deutschle. It was beautiful and informative.",1512864000,4,1152,4.362790697674418

7664653,5,B01BORHRIU,"I went to Nepal in 2009 to trek to Everest Base Camp and was interested in this film for that reason. I loved Kathmandu, I loved the Nepali people, the countryside. My brief experience in Nepal led me to later volunteer in another developing country.

This film is excellent-an honest, thoughtful, and deeply respectful view of one American man's experience in a remote Nepali village. I read with surprise the two-star review and am sorry that that reviewer expected a Hollywood ending. Many other cultures, especially Asian cultures, are more reserved than we are, with our American effusiveness. In fact, big shows of emotions involve a loss of face.

I will recommend this movie to anyone thinking of going to Nepal or anyone interested in a vastly different culture from western life. This is as true a picture as you can get without going to Nepal yourself. Which, frankly, everyone should, at least once in their life. I look forward to going back.

I thought every aspect of the film was handled well, from the arrival in Kathmandu, to preparations, to reunions, to a consideration of next steps.

Thank you Philip Sir and all involved for this outstanding work.",1510099200,2,1170,4.864321608040201

7664655,2,B01BORHRIU,"At first I was caught up in this story, or as much as I could be with the annoying voice of the narrator.  Then, as the story progressed, I noticed that the people in the village just were NOT as emotionally entwined with Phillip as he was attempting to portray them to be.  The host ""father"" and ""mother"" specifically did not appear to feel the strength of the bond to him as he was trying to intimate.  When it was time for him to leave, they treated him as they probably would have treated any honored guest, and there didn't seem to be much sadness at his leaving, which is kind of sad considering how much of a bond he was attempting to portray that he felt towards them.
What really struck me as wonderful was the improvements the people had been able to make in their village; clean water, the building of a new school, albeit not yet finished, the increased number of girls getting an education, the high pass rates for the national test, just to name a few.
By the end of the documentary, I had the jaundiced notion that this was more a journey to renew interest in his book than a real journey of love towards his ""family"".  And mentioning the book, no one he showed it to at the end seemed particularly interested in it or excited by it, it appeared the polite interest that any good host would show their guest.",1487894400,4,1323,4.32258064516129

7664657,5,B01BORHRIU,"I loved this film.  And I hope that Phil Sir checks in here and posts an update on his Nepali family and how they and the town faired after the earth quake.

I have been to Nepal twice:  1985 and 1991.  It was confounding for me to see how much Katmandu had changed even in those six years.  Now seeing the way it was in 2011, I am sadden a bit by the dramatic urbanization.  So many challenging things have happened there.",1519603200,,423,4.097560975609756

7664662,5,B01BORHRIU,"This is a magical film that deeply moves the people who watch it.  I understand that it has been featured at a couple dozen film festivals, and won numerous awards.  After the film was shot, the Nepali village of Aiselukharka was nearly wiped out by a devastating earthquake.

7664663,5,B01BORHRIU,"I really liked this movie/documentary about a former Peace Corps Volunteer returning to the village where he lived for two years in the late 70's.  I'm so glad that I happened upon it, I think it found me as I was not looking for it.  I was a Peace Corps volunteer around the same time that Phil served in Nepal.  I was stationed in Liberia in West Africa from 1978 -1981, serving for two years and then re-enlisting for a third year.  Just like Phil I was in a remote village, the only outsider and also teaching science in a community school.

The experiences of isolation, harsh living conditions, no electricity or running water, no phones were universal for the Peace Corps Volunteers that were (and some still are) living in isolated villages in various countries around the world.  It brought back a lot of memories for me and has me longing to also make a return trip.",1515715200,2,876,4.512658227848101

8750918,5,B01BORHRIU,"Very poignant. Reminded me of many relationships I built that too need time and effort to continue.

About the changes in the village and the host father's central role in them, I've come to realize it may be because he may be a Newar migrant from Kathmandu valley. His accent is not as sharp as the normal Gorkhali accent, and his family's cultural practices (e.g., alcohol brewing) look very 'heterodoxically' Hindu, hence Newar. He may have maintained his contact with his place of origin and aspired to bring similar changes to his village.

There are also other Newari elements in the village, particularly the local temple. Third, the tailor is also a Newar, and therefore, technically, isn't a 'Damai'. The word 'Damai' refers to tailors who belong in the Gorkhali caste system. Since our tailor is a Newar, he is simply a 'Suchikar' (tailor).",1530403200,,850,4.895833333333333
