682594,4,6303548946,"I work out to this video daily, the case was misplaced a long time ago, and I wasn't sure this was what I was looking for until I read some of the reviews. I need to replace the tape I have and now I know the name of it for sure. Thanks to the person who titled their article ""Too much chatter"" I have found it!",1036540800,4,311,3.727272727272727
682595,1,6303548946,"I could hardly stand to watch this video because the instructor was so irritating and stupid.  He would constantly yell things like ""I think about you all the time.  I really care about you""-- a statement so  ridiculous and ingenuine that it can't help but arouse scorn.  His health  advice at the end of the video gives you all sorts of ridiculous  information like the fact that ice cream and heavy cream are loaded with  fat-- DUH!  The workout itself is also so easy and so boring that I felt  like it was pointless.  I never ever work out and have only recently  decided that I might want to get in shape.  I didn't even break a sweat or  strain a tiny bit during this video even though I was doing things at a  greater speed than was shown on the video-- the instructor was dripping  with sweat.  Don't buy this.  You will regret it if you are bothered even  remotely by irritating falseness and studied enthusiasm.  You will find  Richard Simmons more genuine.  I swear.",957484800,5,977,4.4375
682596,4,6303548946,I just started this video and I love it. I haven't worked out in years and this it just what I need.,949536000,5,100,3.590909090909091
682597,5,6303548946,"I have been using this video for over a year with excellent results. After a car accident I could not afford traditional physiotherapy and decided to buy this video to rehabilitate myself. At first it was very challenging,  due to my condition., but soon became very comfortable. The versatility of  the program has allowed me, as it became easier and easier, to modify, like  adding hand held weights with even more incredible results. Best workout  video I have ever tried. The only one that motivated me to watch for more  than 2 or 3 times. Good luck everyone! And Thanks Greg Smithey!",947548800,9,589,4.735294117647059
682598,3,6303548946,"This video gets high marks for content:  it's do-able for those who need to exercise, regardless of age or level of physical fitness.  It's also the right length, long enough to work up a sweat but short enough to fit into a  busy schedule.  It loses points, in my opinion, though, because Greg  Smithey talks and talks and talks, through the entire routine.  Chatter,  like you're wonderful, etc.  He's pompous and vain, for example he asks you  to guess his age and then says he's over 40. That's so obvious and his  attitude is just annoying.  He also sings off-key!  The chatter goes to the  point where it's hard to want to use this video, even though it's great in  other respects.",944006400,15,687,4.524590163934426
7850352,5,6303548946,"This is my second copy of this video; I wore out my first one!  I like the fact that it's ""easy aerobics,"" but it's still a good workout that gets you moving!",1490745600,,158,3.9375

7850354,4,6303548946,"Easy to follow, no complex dance moves ... it is a bit dated.  Also would be great if it came in DVD.  If you are looking for something challenging, complex and moving really fast ... this is not the video.  If you want something that moves at a pace about the speed of a brisk walk that even someone with two left feet can follow, this is the one...just make sure you have a VHS player",1392076800,,386,4.052631578947368
7850355,5,6303548946,This is my favorite of the 3 installments of Startin Simple.  This product came to me undamaged and quickly after order confirmation was complete. However this product would not play on my VCR and the company was quick to fix this problem for me.  I highly recommend this seller.,1369785600,,279,4.673469387755102
7850356,5,6303548946,"I got this tape in the 90's when it was new. I was in my mid-20's and athletic, yet unable to follow complicated choreographed workouts. This tape was perfect! As I advanced, I added dumbells, which made it challenging again. When I advanced past that, I used this tape as a warm up prior to strength training. I wore the tape out and eventually threw it out. Now I am on Amazon to get another copy. Oh, and I originally bought it because it was by the same guy that did the original Buns of Steel in the 80's. To this day, that is the best workout I have ever seen! If you can get over the bright colored 80's leotards, and that hair, you should add Buns of Steel to your cart along with this tape. IT WORKS!!!",1280016000,,711,4.122302158273381
7850357,5,6303548946,I had this video before but the it got stuck in the tape player and as a result the tape was ruined. This video is great for someone that is older or has problems with their knees or feet. It is low impact but is still a workout. I have had surgery on both my knees and can't do the exercise tapes that I used so I wamted this one because it is effective. It can be corny at times with the way Greg talks about thinking as us all the time and some of the exercises seem to be corny but they do work. I lost weight 2 years ago after my first knee surgery by using this tape along with yoga and pilates tapes. I plan to do that again. It does work!,1275264000,,646,3.7925925925925927
7850358,5,6303548946,"I orignally started using this video when I was quite overweight.  Now, 80 lbs lighter, I feel I owe a lot of my weight loss to this video.  Before buying Easy Aerobics video, I  wasted tons of money on exercise videos.  They were all too complicated and fast paced.  This was exactly what I needed to get moving!",1150243200,5,313,4.327586206896552
7850359,5,6303548946,"Of the three beginner-level aerobics tapes I recently purchased (Denise Austin's Xtralite Aerobics and Fabulous Forever with Mirabai Holland are the other two) this one is clearly the best. The instructor, Greg Smithey, is funny, knowledgble, and easy to follow.  He is accompanied by a great class of very real-looking women and men, which I found inspiring.  I felt that I ""fit in"" with the other folks in the class.  The steps are simple, but what a workout!  My heart rate definitely reached my target zone and stayed there.  The tape is a bit dated -- 1995 -- but holds its own very well.  I truly hope that Smithey will do another Easy Aerobics tape soon!",1073347200,10,661,4.655172413793103
7850360,3,6303548946,"If I had it to do over again, I wouldn't buy this video. I am out of shape and very uncoordinated, yet I found it unchallenging. It is very short-I believe it is 30 minutes or so TOTAL, including warm-up and cool-down, (but I didn't really time it, so I could be wrong about that) so there's not much time spent really exercising. And Greg Smithey's condescension really rubbed me the wrong way; I found him very irritating.
All that said, if you really are looking for something very simple and short and you can tolerate being talked to like you were a four-year-old, you might find it helpful.",1062892800,2,596,4.477064220183486
7850361,4,6303548946,"I am an overweight woman with arthritic knees, and I was looking for a tape that wasn't too challenging, that included a warm-up and cool-down, and that wouldn't put too much stress on my knees.  This workout definitely provided all of that.
The workout begins with a warm-up routine, where you stretch out your muscles and then begin moving at a slow pace.  It then moves into marches, side-to-side movements, and lunges.  None of the movements were too difficult to follow (although sometimes they seemed out of synch with the music) and none were too hard on my knees.  The workout then ends with a cool-down and stretch.
The leader is unusually encouraging, in a cheesy fashion, but for some reason I found it endearing rather than irritating, and the simple fact is -- the routine is perfect for me, so I can put up with anything.  There simply aren't enough routines out there for people woefully out of shape who are dealing with knee problems.
All in all, if you're in good health and in any kind of reasonable shape, this routine will probably bore you.  However, if you get winded walking up a flight of stairs, but want to get started on some kind of exercise routine, this is a great way to begin -- challenging but not too difficult.",1047772800,27,1246,4.59009009009009
