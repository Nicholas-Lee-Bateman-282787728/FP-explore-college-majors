4687007,5,B005G1729K,"After receiving this DVD, I watched the whole six episodes at once. It excellent and vividly incarnation from the book. And I also appreciate the interview of the author, Neil Gaiman. When I heard they are planning the next season, I was excited. Since this is a perfect TV series, the next must be more interesting!  Well, as a funs of Neil Gaiman, I've read the novel and the comic first, and this small series leave me somewhat too much blanks. Such as the relationship between Richard and jessica and the killing of the beast, there can be more detailed scenes. Anyway, this is a miracle! I'm lovin' it!",1331942400,,607,4.568807339449541

4687011,5,B005G1729K,"I have watched this program several times through over the years. Last year I bought the updated book. I hadn't realized that the show came first, then the book. My love for the show has grown due to this, as most times it's the other way around and it seems like translating anything from a book to a movie it loses a lot. I now also love the book. The show is cheesy, yes, in that wonderful '70s-Doctor-Who-BBC' type of cheesiness that is wonderful.",1487289600,,451,4.380952380952381
4687012,5,B005G1729K,"Although this wasn't up the to superior level of the book (what could be?), it was nevertheless entertaining. It needed someone different in the lead, even though he did improve as time went on, but all the other characters and the settings were terrific and did not clash with the book.

Usually, a movie or series is disappointing compared to the book.  That was NOT the case here!  For a low budget series, I was impressed.",1472083200,,317,3.984126984126984

4687025,3,B005G1729K,"For those who follow Neil Gaiman know the book was actually a supplement to the series. The only reason this doesn't get 2 stars is because I love the book and most of Gaiman's other works. The acting is terrible and the effects are awful. Had I not read the book then I wouldn't have made it past the first episode. The acting was missing all the life and energy of the characters they were acting. The special effects look like they were done over night and with about a $5 budget. This all being said, this particular purchase did include a VERY nice map of Neverwhere and it is a collectors edition. If you are an avid fan of Neil's then I would recommend this purchase just from a collector standpoint.",1452297600,,707,4.363636363636363
4687026,4,B005G1729K,"It's a Neil Gaiman story! Although the movie is not as good as the book (nothing unusual there!) I have watched this several times through the years and decided it was time to order it. It is an unusual story with a good cast. I would watch it first (and read  or listen to the book!!!!) before buying as it may not be to everyone's taste. I will say that I have also listened to the audible book (narrated by Neil!) several times and absolutely love it! A great story if you like fantasy and of course, Neil Gaiman!",1448841600,2,516,4.212121212121212

4687030,3,B005G1729K,Does not do the book justice.  Production quality kind of cheesy.  Read the book first.,1439596800,,87,4.733333333333333
4687031,4,B005G1729K,"Just a note on this wonderful series,  the bulk of the poor reviews seem to be under the misapprehension that the book came first.  It did not. The Neverwhere miniseries was a project/collaboration between Neil Gaiman and Lenny Henry. Originally envisioned as a story focusing on the homeless (to ostensibly raise awareness), Neil decided to remove it to the London Underground with the fantasy and horror elements to avoid making homelessness seem cool.

When interest in the series peaked he was able to go back through the script and adapt it for novelization, which allowed Neil to flesh out the story and fill in ideas that were either cut for time or harder to translate to film. If you treat the book as a sort of Directors Cut you wouldn't be far from the mark - but in the end, without the series we wouldn't have the book.

As for disagreements about production quality or performance, this was done a long time before the BBC considered such tales worthy of significant budget. I'm no longer inclined to pick it apart,  I've loved the series since I was a teenager (35 now) and it's a well worn friend for days when I need to hide from being a responsible adult.",1436918400,76,1173,4.5933014354066986
4687032,1,B005G1729K,I absolutely loved this book so was so disappointed to see it made into such a cheesy production. I think a high school video class could have done a better job. I remain hopefull that Gaimen will let a real movie studio redo it as its such a creative and engaging story.,1430956800,,271,4.230769230769231
4687033,5,B005G1729K,It's really wild to get to watch something that have been reading for so long really neat,1430438400,,89,4.294117647058823

4687035,3,B005G1729K,"I saw this movie 15 years ago and liked it well enough that I thought I wanted a personal copy. It's a good thing the DVD was so cheap, because I don't feel so bad shelling out a few bucks for this yawner. The plot is VERY thinand far too predictable. That's a shame because the premise on which the storyline depends is not half bad. The only bright spots in this somewhat disappointing anniversary edition are the cameo appearances by some famous and familiar British actors: Freddie Jones plays the brain-addled king of an abandoned line of the London Underground, and a startlingly young Peter Capaldi (currently playing Dr. Who for BBC TV) are the two most notable walk-ons. Keep an eye open for several appearances by other Dr. Who veterans. My advice: Watch it first on a streaming service, and if you like it, then buy it on Amazon, where the price is right for such a light-weight piece of cinematic fluff.",1428192000,3,915,4.585365853658536

4687037,3,B005G1729K,"The video was delivered as intended and a fine quality DVD.  My rating is because the series itself is so bad and has no reflection on the seller, but rather on the producer/director.  I loved the book and had hoped the series would be at least mildly interesting.",1420416000,,264,4.479166666666667

4687042,5,B005G1729K,So happy to have this on dvd now.  13 years ago I have to search the internet for bootleg vhs's of this bbc series and now at easy access its the whole series.  The picture is clear and it even comes with a nice map of London Below .  Nice extra for fans of Gaimans book.,1411171200,,271,3.8035714285714284
4687043,4,B005G1729K,"I love Gainman!  He has great stories and are well written.  Because of the type of story Neverwhere is, I was a bit worried about it being a movie/TV mini-series also.  There are a few things that are different, but nothing absurd, and the story line is pretty spot on with the book (even though the mini series came before the book).  The production value is what could have been expected from any TV station during the mid-90s.  It's not a high budget feature, but not low budget either.  The special effects are about as good as any other feature from this time.  It seems a bit corny at times, but it's just so good!",1410393600,3,621,4.3478260869565215
4687044,5,B005G1729K,"Yes, the other reviewers are right - it's dated, and a bit cheesy and campy.  But, it is an interesting story, with interesting characters, and you find yourself wondering just what is going to happen next!  I'm not familiar with Neil Gaiman's graphic novels, so can't comment on how accurately this follows them.  However, I can say that it was very entertaining.",1403222400,,364,4.838709677419355
4687045,2,B005G1729K,"The first time I watched this series, Neil Gaiman could do no wrong. Sure, the Sandman series dragged a little towards the end but the man was the greatest fantasy writer of his generation and he took fantasy out of the Tolkien imitation ghetto in a very clear way. I enjoyed every moment of this silly miniseries and overlooked most of its faults which tended to center on the cheesy special effects that were actually quite charming if you are a fan of the original Star Trek or Dr Who.

Since then I have stopped being so enamored with Gaiman's writing. i still like American Gods and Sandman but I read his short story collection Fragile Things and wondered openly why I was reading a bunch of writing exercises. So the poor writing is much more apparent now. The story is pretty interesting for the most part, but how many times do we have to see the ""poor shmoe ends up in a magic world"" tale? The magic of the world is not so interesting. Characters disappear without explanation and other characters are flat. The only black woman is called The Hunter who never says anything but cliches and she walks around with a spear waiting to use it. Not since Robert Altman named a character in MASH ""spearchucker"" did the unfortunate racial histories seem to be so disregarded. Beyond that, the 'big plot twist' is NOT a plot twist when it's been done hundreds of times before. Firefly encapsulated the trope best with the line ""damn your unexpected but inevitable betrayal."" Most of the dialogue is from the ""clever"" school of dialogue writing - meaning that it sounds much better in the writer's head than it sounds in real life since it's pretty impossible to imagine anyone talking like this.

Beyond the cheesy writing, the acting is sub par. The one actor that has any talent is Peter Capaldi and he's stuck playing an angel without emotion. Everything seems shot on a sound stage and there is nothing done with lighting or camera angles that has any depth or originality.

If you remember this fondly from your childhood, let it remain in your childhood. If you're curious about this one, let your curiosity rest. If you love Neil Gaiman and think he can do no wrong, then hurry up and get this before you change your mind.",1399939200,,2230,4.597989949748744

4687047,5,B005G1729K,"I now own this Neil Gaiman work in all formats: written, audio book and now DVD.  I just finished watching it again.  I don't tire of the story nor the presentation.  Highly recommended!",1391472000,,186,4.575757575757576
4687048,5,B005G1729K,"Neverwhere was made in 1996. In England. So yeah, some of the things in it are a little cheesy and dated. Who cares?! The story was fantastic, the acting was great (over the top sometimes but only when the scene actually called for that!) and the scenery was amazing! I just wish there had been more. Fortunately I have both the comic that was released and the novel so I have enough to last me until Gaiman does a sequel.",1387065600,,422,4.2875

It's a made for tv movie and it's made for Englixh tv.  Not sure if many people in the US will enjoy it as much, but if you enjoyed the book and can understand some cultural differences in the movie it's well worth buying",1383091200,,361,3.7866666666666666
4687053,2,B005G1729K,NOT what I expected. Filmed like a Dr. Who episode. The film quality was like that of soap opera with hokey effects. The choice of actors was really excellent though. If you love the story and all that is Neil Gaiman you'd watch it anyway but it was quite disappointing. I kept it but probably should've returned the product. Can't see myself watching the whole thing a second time unless I'm desperate and stuck at home in a snowstorm.,1382659200,,436,4.531645569620253

4687055,4,B005G1729K,"Neil Gaiman is one of a select few modern-day writers in the fantasy genre whose writings are not derivative of JRR Tolkien and do not involve werewolves or vapires. A fellow Canadian Guy Gabriel Kay and Ursula LeGuin of Earthsea fame are among the few Id call his equals. Neverwhere is a BBC Series he scripted.

Richard Mayhew stops in the streets of London to help a girl and suddenly finds himself devoid of identity, largely invisible to his former associates, without a job, or an apartment. Suddenly he finds himself in Neverwhere a place where rat speakers take orders from Rats and his former world and the rules he lived by no longer apply. With Door as his guide they seek the Angel Islington and a key, but, as we are reminded, the Devil was an angel as well. In their travels they meet many more remarkable characters and places.

Over the objections of his fiancee, he rescues the little girl, named ""Door,"" and the story takes off from there.

Boogeymen, heroes, witches, apparently-immortal beings, and more populate this well-told tale.  It's one of the books you'll not put down until finished, and re-read soon.",1527897600,,530,5.104651162790698

The story is generally the same as the novel, though Gaiman wrote the book afterward and reworked ideas he didn't get to fully develop in this series. Fans of the story should start here as this is the earliest version and, despite Gaiman further developing his ideas, it's still plenty enjoyable. The cast is great, but Peter Capaldi is a special treat as the angel Islington. The filmmakers made good use of London's architecture to create a fully-developed world.

Usually women are fighting like honey badgers when I carry them off to my lair.  But barely conscious and then grateful for my help-- I could work with that!  Okay, my point is that the setup is very cliched.  Richard is such a tosser that it takes you out of it.  And the whole idea of a magical underworld within London is not unique either.  And even taking into account the age of Neverwhere, the special effects, the fight scenes, and even the camerawork are  shoddy at best.

But as the story progressed, it became much more imaginative, which is what I'm looking for.  A lot of the story takes place in London's sewers where the street urchins can talk to rats and pidgeons, so this won't appeal to everyone.  There's a lot of strangeness for strangeness's sake.  There's a playfulness to it that reminded me of the 90s movie Labyrinth with David Bowie (which I really liked), but with more of a British feel.  Or it could just be bad.  I wouldn't judge anyone for giving this two stars.",1495670400,2,1148,4.509708737864078
