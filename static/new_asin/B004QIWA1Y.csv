8438213,5,B004QIWA1Y,I saw this movie years ago so I  thought it was the original one but ti was a very good movie so glad I have it to pass down to my kids,1396656000,,135,3.21875
8438214,1,B004QIWA1Y,"Was excited to get this. However,  It is not at all what I expected for the price. It was more like an advertisment for these people and what they do than informative about Lizzie Borden and the house.  How much better would it have been had they gone into detail about the murder and the workings of the house - not just about their equipment.  High school ""student project"" quality.",1394928000,5,384,4.457142857142857

8438216,5,B004QIWA1Y,"I've only seen a few SCARED! DVD's so far and they are all pretty great but this one was really, really good! I would reccomend it to anyone who is interested in this kind of thing, whether it be urban exploration, ghost hunting or just Lizzie Bordens history.
Two thumbs up for Chris Mancuso, Brian J. Cano and the rest of the SCARED! crew. Well done!
Make sure you check out their other DVD's as well.....",1367107200,4,407,4.368421052631579
