Beautiful show for children. Wish I could find them all!",1357862400,,110,4.285714285714286
8061821,5,B0009J6O0M,"This video has 2 separate adventure episodes from ""The Wonderful World of Disney"" television show that played on Sunday nights from 1953 to 1983. The first is ""Nature's Better Built Homes"", originally aired in 1969, and repeated in 1972. In this episode we are treated a look at the wide variety of nests, dens, hives, and other unusual homes built by wild animals, insects, and sea life. Narrated by the animated character Ranger Woodlore, it features clips from the ""Walt Disney True Life Adventure"" features, as well as animated sequences. Very interesting stuff, nice family fare.

This next episode first aired in 1976, then repeated in '67 and `72. ""Joker, the Amiable Ocelot"" is a story about a mechanic named Jim, who finds a car in the desert and tows it to his shop, only to find it is owned by someone else... a family of ocelot's. One of the kittens was stuck in the car and is now ready to move in with Jim and his other animal friends. An ocelot is a wild cat from the hot desert, and being in a kitten he gets into a great amount of mischief. Very funny and lovable story.

I highly recommend this video and others in the series of 13 tapes with 2 episodes each, see my list of these to learn more. To learn about other episodes in the television series I reccommend the book, ""The Wonderful World of Disney Television, by Bill Cotter"", also available at Amazon.",1122422400,3,1377,4.526104417670683
