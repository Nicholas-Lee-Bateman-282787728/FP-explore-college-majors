1904766,5,B0000ACOYO,"This is a really great series and I wish I could see it here in the states as I'm hooked now from Season I. CSI and Law & Order are good too, but the characters are the main attraction not necessarily the murders or the who-dunnits. The mysteries are more like real life where you don't always find out what happens and the bad guy doesn't always get caught and tried. When is Season II on dvd?
In response to a previous review, the set includes 13 episodes on 4 dvds with french and english subtitles.",1085875200,6,502,4.239583333333333
1904767,5,B0000ACOYO,"I first heard of this series from a review on the website, [...] if you search for Da Vinci on the site, you can see their review of the full series. I purchased the first season  based on that review and I'm very pleased. This show is excellent! If you are a fan of television programs such as Prime Suspect, Homicide or NYPD Blue, you will enjoy Da Vinci's Inquest.
The main character, Dominic Da Vinci, is an investigator for the Coroner's office; his job is to investigate the circumstances surrounding the victim's death. He works closely with both the medical examiner and the detectives on the homicide squad. The interaction of all the characters makes for a rich mix of personalities. The first story arc spans three episodes and it does a fine job of establishing the cast and the feel for the series. Subsequent episodes introduce and usually resolve the mystery in one show, but the consequences continue to affect the storyline throughout the season. Minor plot threads run through the whole season to flesh out and provide motivation for the characters.
Viewing the first season is like reading a great novel - you don't want to stop it because it's so engrossing.
I would highly recommend this series to anyone who enjoys thought provoking television mysteries.",1082505600,6,1276,4.82648401826484

1904769,5,B0000ACOYO,"This series is a true classic. The ensemble of actors work so well together it's like watching a long-term passionate love affair.  I am spoiled forever.  BE CAREFUL! I love detective movies and TV series but now they all seem contrived, over rehearsed and egocentric.

The good news is, there are about 90 episodes.  I plan to start from the beginning after watching thru completion.  Nicholas Campbell is the heart and soul of this extraordinary venture. He creates a true intimacy that is a gift that is consistent. I continue to be amazed at the deep understanding of the those that live on the street and those that parole and serve the dark side with them.",1475107200,,662,4.672413793103448

1904777,5,B0000ACOYO,"Reviewing from DVDs bought at Amazon and given to me as a gift.

Note: For fans wanting to see season 4 to end, they are available at YouTube. Most have been watched thousands of times. Not the best video, but they are quite watchable.

I too, found this television gem on the late, late night TV schedule. Wow! You almost feel like you're watching a documentary. How Chris Haddock mixes everyday conversation in a crime drama and makes it work is the reason for its success. I was given this DVD which happens to be the Canadian version with the original intro. One episode is in French--with English subtitles. What a gift!

DaVinci's Inquest has won many Geminis, a Leo and several Academy of Canadian Cinema & Television Award for Best Dramatic Series. Canadian national treasure Nicholas Campbell plays Dominic DaVinci, Vancouver's coroner. The role is based on Larry Campbell, who has writing and other credits. Campbell is joined by other actors in believable roles: veteran actor Donnelly Rhodes, Ian Tracey, Alex Diakun, Sarah Strange, Venus Terzo, Gerard Plunkett, Sara-Jane Redmond, Suleka Mathew and the list of quality actors goes on and on.

DaVinci speaks for the dead. He annoys many of the living, but he works for those who cannot tell their story. Rhodes, Tracey and Terzo play the detectives. Interwoven into the procedural investigations are the characters' private lives. Rhodes wife is struggling with dementia, Tracey's the troubled young detective trying to understand his anger and Terzo is too involved with a young street hooker. The first three episodes relate a real crime spree that involved missing prostitutes. In later seasons you'll see Matt Frewer as a really bad guy. His performance is truly mesmerizing as the psychotic killer. And just try to hold still when a young couple kidnaps a woman to have fun with. It's creepy and again, great performances.

Despite the subject matter, DaVinci's Inquest's violence level is low-key--nothing like the daily slaughter on American TV. There is some profanity. But the story lines are intelligent, compelling, real and heartfelt.

DaVinci maxim: I'll tell you that for free.",1447372800,,2154,5.087818696883852

1904813,5,B0000ACOYO,"Da Vinci's Inquest is vastly superior to subsequent U.S. cheap imitations. Everything about the Canadian series excels--the plots, plausibility, acting, character development, and technical execution. This is not a show for someone addicted to the pyrotechnics, corny dialogue, ridiculous plots, and impossible characters of U.S. shows like CSI. Da Vinci's Inquest treats crime scenes and deaths as they actually could happen in real life and never strays into the over-the-top realm that dominates south-of-the-border shows. Yet there is an obvious influence of Alfred Hitchock at work in the attention to minute detail, the brilliant casting of the smallest bit parts, the emphasis on the tensions and stresses on the main characters that involve the viewer beyond the case du jour. Creator Chris Haddock has created, in this series, a masterpiece. His subsequent ""Da Vinci's City Hall"" and ""Intelligence"" were both better than anything ever done on U.S. television since the early glory days when directors and networks in the U.S. actually took risks and had respect for their audience's intelligence.",1282608000,,1105,5.5058823529411764

I found I had to do a manual time set on my recorder - as I was missing out on bits, rather then setting by show title itself.

1904816,5,B0000ACOYO,"Nicholas Campbell is pitch perfect in this, a true life drama from Canada that weaves a web of intrigue and suspense that keeps you on the edge. Ian Tracy is  superb, as are the rest of the cast, especially Ian Tracy and Donnelly Rhodes. Based on the life of a Vancover Coroner who must and does buck the system when needed and moves on to become mayor of that most gorgeous of west coast cities. But that's another series. Buy this one. You'll want Season Two. There is no doubt.",1273190400,,480,4.333333333333333
1904817,5,B0000ACOYO,"I ran across this program on the Sleuth network (at present, Sleuth has dropped 'Da Vinci's Inquest' in favor of 'The Dead Zone.')  I am happy to have it available on dvd - the acting, writing, cast, directing, and setting (Vancouver, BC) are all top notch, and makes for enjoyable viewing without the ridiculous pandering to the dumbest of the dumb usually found on similar American shows.

My only issue is with the dvds (product of Canada).  Apparently,  part one of episode 11, 'Final Chapter' was omitted from my Season One set, but not part two.  Has anyone else experienced this problem?

Anyway, I've already ordered Season Two of Da Vinci.  On a side note, a new program called 'Intelligence' featuring Da Vinci alum Ian Tracey, is now available on dvd.  I hope you will check it out.",1266796800,,793,4.695652173913044
1904818,5,B0000ACOYO,"If you really like all that flashy equipment and music that is such a regular part of the CSI franchise, then you may not like this.  However, if instead, you like brilliant scripts, well developed characters, realism, forensics as done within real world budgetary constraints, all set in Vancouver, Canada, then this is the show for you. After watching all the seasons of this show, I could no longer look at a CSI show because I found them so vacuous. The Da Vinci cases also do not necessarily have crystal clear resolutions.  They may not be able to solve a case or solve it satisfactorily or they may be able to solve it but they cannot prove it in court.  They aren't just concerned with murders either.  There are other kinds of deaths which the coroner's office much also investigate.  Nicholas Campbell plays Da Vinci and he has real world problems and real world assets which he deals with on a day to day basis. His character is further developed in each season and does not just remain one dimensional as it does on the CSIs. This is a really great show and I came to feel as if I knew all the characters as real people.

1904819,5,B0000ACOYO,"In my opinion CBC Television has created a gem of a realistic dramatic series of real consequence in the airing of Da Vinci's Inquest.  In reviewing some of the background write-ups and reviews some basis is made in comparing this series to Quincy, M.E.  Quincy was a lightweight drama standing side by side with Da Vinci.
 The first season introduces a fast paced gritty narrative set in Vancouver B.C.  Side plots emerge from the start and are continued off and on through the first 13 episodes.  The Actors are outstanding in all respects led by Nicholas Campbell and Donnelly Rhodes.  One thing is prevailing in all the episodes, we really don't know if the crime will be solved. More times than not the perpetrators are caught but it's not a guaranty.  Many scenes are very graphic and earthy.  The street scenes and police work remind me of another classic series, that being ""Homicide, Life on the Street"".  This award winning series is based partly on the real life experiences of Larry Campbell the former coroner of Vancouver.
 The plots are fast paced and very much not predictable.  The characters are delightfully flawed and very human.  All this when blended comes out as a magnificent recipe for high drama entertainment.  Don't pass it by.  5 Stars!  No Problem!!",1246492800,2,1279,4.829493087557604
1904820,5,B0000ACOYO,"If you're weary of the vapid U.S. based programming (reality shows, mindless sitcoms) then you should appreciate this series. I stumbled upon it on late night TV and am hooked. This show gives a novel, believable approach to social 'ills' while presenting protaganists as real humans. Unlike so many of the U.S. 'cop shows' the personal lives of the characters are intertwined in the stories. They're not always 'perfect' which makes this even more believable and enjoyable. DaVinci experiences problems with alcohol, goes through a divorce and has a teen-age daughter to contend with. Yet, he's idealistic enough to be frustrated by bureaucracy and political ramifications of doing his job. Homocide cops: one with a drinking problem, another struggling with a wife that has Alzheimer's. And a dirty undercover narcotics cop who is blackmailing a (married) city councilman.  Intrigued yet?  I've purchased the first three seasons (all available at this time) and can only hope the remaining seasons, as well as DaVinci as Mayor are released soon. I can't grasp why DaVinci (as corononer or mayor) was discontinued, or why it's taking so long for the remaining seasons to be released on DVD. Buy this - you won't be disappointed!",1243209600,,1229,5.14
1904821,5,B0000ACOYO,"We truly enjoy every bit of Da Vinci's Inquest and have the shows we cannot yet purchase from Acorn (not released yet) saved on DVR so we can watch them as well as the first 3 seasons recently purchased.  We watched one episode 3 times yesterday (weekend) because it had so much wry humour and it cracked us up even though this is an excellent drama series.  Da Vinci is a great series and Nicholas Campbell and the rest of the cast are simply wonderful at their craft.  The writer(s) have given this series true heart and headache as one would find in any big city coroner's office lucky enough to have people as talented as the cast of Da Vinci's Inquest working in a government/Crown capacity with all of the stuff that might really be going on as seen in this series with interpersonal relationships, different departments butting heads, and the kind of real life drama and humour we enjoy so very much from this drama and everyone involved.  While David Kelley has done a remarkable job in bringing some good shows forward on U.S. television, he and the talented man that brings us CSI, JAG, and NCIS to name a few, cannot give us what Canada has given us due to the fact that too many people don't seem to appreciate thought provoking shows that continue different threads throughout the season.  Because Da Vinci does do this as well as go beyond the surface of the characters and present a more 3 dimensional and realistic drama, they are well worth the price due to the amount of enjoyment we get from this drama and hope Acorn will get busy and release the rest of this series as well as the City Hall episodes asap.  We missed Da Vinci's Inquest when it was regularly on U.S. television due to circumstances beyond our control so it has been delightful to find now and truly enjoy possibly at an age where we can even get more from the series.  Hoping we do not have a DVR breakdown before Acorn gets the rest of these DVD's released.  Sandra/Johnnie Texas",1242518400,,1967,4.490196078431373
1904822,5,B0000ACOYO,"What a fine show. The strong acting, the no-cheap-shots writing and the brilliant casting make for engrossing entertainment.  The setting, Vancouver, is gorgeous and sleazy but not distracting.  Without car chases and gun battles the show makes the viewer abhor violent crime but does not deny the fascination we have for what us human beings do to each other. Most of the major characters are government employees, and there's a running theme of politics and bureaucracy which rings true.  My only complaint is that I've got the series musical theme stuck in my brain, a jazz trumpet thing that is terrific. A minor price to pay for some worthwhile time in front of the tube.",1239408000,,676,4.860869565217391

1904826,5,B0000ACOYO,"""DaVinci's Inquest"" is the best written series of this genre I've ever seen.
Dialogue is crisp, story lines are introduced gradually, as situiations are in real life.  This is not a show where violence rules - more a series where the lead character has flaws, makes mistakes, has normal daily frustrations - but for this very reason, you will be dying to see the next episode and see if this everyday man comes out ahead.

Chris Haddock heads a team of writers, actors and such who obviously love what they do and you love watching them do their stuff.  Canada should feel blessed to have such artists, because they create as good as any American series, better than most.
This is a show you can watch with your children in the room and you needn't worry they'll see guts and gore (CSI anyone?), but they won't want to watch it because the story lines are so well crafted, the kids will be lost in 10 minutes and there won't be any guns blazing to hold their interest, thank God.
My only complaint is that I will be dead and gone before Acorn gets all
the sets out on DVD.  What is their problem?  There are a host of people out there, waiting for each set to come out.
Once you have viewed all of ""DaVinci"", take a look at ""Intelligence"" which was produced by the same team.  Unfortunately, it was yanked before its time, thanks to the the questionable wisdom of CBC.
""DaVinci's Inquest"" is worth every single penny.  Remember - you get what you pay for.  Meanwhile, I'm trying not to hold my breath until the next set comes out.  ARE YOU LISTENING, ACORN?  @#%$&*#@!!",1213142400,2,1569,4.454545454545454
1904827,4,B0000ACOYO,"...For only 13 episodes, I find it a bit pricey.  Here in the US an average television programme airs between 22 and 24 new episodes per season and later markets the boxed set for less (usually $10.00 to $15.00 less, depending on the programme).  I love Da Vinci's Inquest and catch it every weekend.  Unfortunately, it looks as though that's how I shall have to continue to watch it, as I refuse to pay so much for so few episodes.

1904833,5,B0000ACOYO,Da Vinci's inquest is one of my favorite shows. I read other reviews that said the Acorn Media collection was the most complete of all the Season 1 collections. There is not a minute missing from any of the shows. I highly recommend the Acorn Media collection to anyone who is a true Da Vinci's Inquest fan. It is excellent.,1191024000,2,324,4.416666666666667

Still, as a born skeptic, I felt compelled to check into the claims that Acorn's release of ""Da Vinci's Inquest"" Season One was somehow edited from the Canadian versions. What I found was that the Canadian version that some people are praising (as if it was capable of curing cancer) actually clocks in SHORTER than Acorn's release.

By all accounts I've been able to find, the Canadian version lists a run-time of under 600 minutes, while the copy of the Acorn release I've got clocks in at 611 minutes. That's nearly one minute per episode. Again if any version of the program is cut (or ""censored"" as some maintain), it would clearly seem to be Canadian one that's missing something. As far as claims of language being changed, I didn't hear anything different and I'm pretty sure I read some words in the closed captioning that others might find objectionable.

If people want to express a preference for one version over the other, that's great (it's America after all). However, I don't think it's too much for people to get their facts straight before shooting off their on-line mouths.",1189468800,7,1188,4.706730769230769

1904836,5,B0000ACOYO,"I'll admit my bias upfront. I like this show, and I like what Acorn Media does on DVD. Still, being a skeptic by nature, I did my homework regarding the claims that Acorn's release of ""Da Vinci's Inquest"" Season One was somehow edited from the Canadian versions. What I found was that the Canadian version that some people are praising (as if it held the cure to cancer) actually clocks in SHORTER than Acorn's release.

I can't speak to where A. Wharton got the 423 minute time quoted in his/her (erroneous) review, but whatever the source was it was clearly wrong. The Canadian version lists a run-time of under 600 minutes, while the copy of the Acorn release I'm looking at clocks in at 611 minutes. That's nearly one minute per episode. Again if any version of the program is cut (or ""censored"" as some maintain), it would clearly seem to be Canadian one that's missing something.

Another thing that seems to be missing from the Canadian release is closed-captioning. Speaking for myself, a few too many rock concerts in high-school have done a number on my hearing, and I love captioning.

As to the show itself, the reviewer who compared it to ""Homicide"" really hit the mark. Dominic Da Vinci's comment that he ""[speaks] for the dead"" very much echoes the attitude of the detectives on ""Homicide."" Indeed, Da Vinci strikes me as what ""Homicide"" would have been like had the medical examiner been the main character rather than primarily a supporting role.

Shows like ""Law & Order"" are entertaining enough, but programs like ""Homicide"" and ""Da Vinci..."" go a step beyond that. Where ""Law & Order"" seldom stretches beyond the generic police procedural drama, ""Da Vinci..."" makes you feel like you've stepped into a world that is completely concrete. You know that these characters had a life before the episode started and (assuming they're not the victim) will have one that goes on after.

The downside, for a TV series, is that it is not episodic.  The character development and plot lines span at least one season.  This make it a perfect DVD.  You can plug in the first season, watch three-four episodes at a sitting, and it's like watching three great movies.  Seasons following (I think there are 8) are unbelievably good, as well.  Highly recommended.

1904840,5,B0000ACOYO,"absolutely true, Barbara Pinzka. Da Vinci Inquest DOES rate up there with Homicide. And I unabashedly adore Homicide.

CBS the network, in its brilliance, has decided to 'broadcast' this show at 1:35am on a Sunday morning, when the audience is at its largest, no? No.

Rather than bump some idiotic reality show or rather than USA pick it up and dump a 700th rerun of Law and Order for its prime time showcasing, this wonderful, WONderful show is hidden in the wee hours of the morning.

I found it by accident and am hooked. Of course, I don't always tape it and so don't know which season I am seeing and am not seeing it in sequence, but I will put it on my future list of DVDs to buy (along with the X-Files and Homicide).

Campbell is outstanding, as are the rest of the actors. I love the extra-extra-shaky handheld camera, and best of all? I LOVE the chirpy street crossing aid that is in EVERY episode! The editors have made no effort to block out street noises -- buses, chirpy noise -- when the characters are on the street.

1904844,5,B0000ACOYO,"ADDENDUM:  April 14, 2012 - I was looking to find what Chris Haddock is producing now. For those who might be interested, go to an article written in February of this year in Macleans. Ca.  Apparently he is living and working in New York as a writer on someone else's show.  Canada had its chance and because it could not support a talented writer, they lost him to the U.S.  What a rotten shame.
DaVinci's Inquest is now re-running on KONG TV in Seattle.
------------------
Addendum:  June, 2010 - Acorn managed to put out a total of three seasons and that appears to be all they can do.  None have been issued on DaVinci the Mayor and there are no Chris Haddock creations out on Canadian TV that I've been able to find - at least none of this quality.  CBC appears to prefer 3rd rate talk shows and pablum oriented programming.  Unfortunate, because there is some amazing talent in Canada (and I live in the U.S.!)  All of the reviews have not swayed Acorn, but we tried. DaVinci's Inquest is airing on Channel 6 with Comcast in Washington State right now.  Anyone out there have any new information on where else it might be airing?  I see adds that ""new"" episodes are running on ""You Tube"", but personally am not interested in sitting at a computer to watch programming.
--------------------
First entry:  March, 2007:  All of the reviews of this series are right on.  I am so impressed with Nicholas Campbell and the men who put this series together, along with the sequel, when DaVinci becomes mayor.  All or a portion of this group also, if I'm correct, created ""Intelligence"", which is running currently and one of the most engaging series on television. And they can't decide if it will continue for a second season!
Yet - we can only buy Season One of ""DaVinci's Inquest"".  This series is intelligently and realistically written with a mix of humour, the real problems of political and street life and heroes with forgivable and recognizable flaws.  What's not to love?!
I've written CBC countless times and they appear to have no interest in what their viewers want.
We can buy DVD's of countless mindless series, yet Canada produces a remarkable trio of series and we viewers can't get our hands on them.  What the heck are they thinking?  Perhaps a better question - ARE they thinking?
It would appear they are wonderful at creating but miserable at marketing.

One of the best aspects of these series is that the violence is not gratuitous and not in your face.  They understand you don't have to have blood and gore to create tension.  It is always just far enough away that you are not smacked with it, say, as one is with the CSI series.
""DaVinci's Inquest"" is NOT written for the average 12 year old mind, thank God. We can only hope someone wakes up and puts all of the episodes on DVD so the fans can watch them over and over.  They are worth every minute of your time.",1173830400,4,2889,4.545454545454546

This is unlike anything you'll find on basic cable in the USA.  Frank discussion of policies like needle exchanges and red-light districts, bleak looks at the issues of homelessness and drug abuse.  This isn't your usual prime-time fare (well, it was up here).  But underneath all of it is a brilliantly written show with amazing actors, from the stars to the recurring bit characters.  Many others have sung the praises of them, so I'll just leave it at agreeing with them.

Chris Haddock wrote most, if not all, of this series' episodes, and was showered with accolades up here for his work, and rightly so.  It stunned me that US audiences didn't make his CBS offering, The Handler (from a few years back) popular enough for a second season, even if he had to ""Hollywood-ize"" his stories.  But I'm glad that I see Davinci's Inquest finding an audience, even if it is many years later.

And for all those who want more seasons on DVD, I couldn't agree more.  If anything, the show gets even better in later seasons.",1173312000,2,1168,4.54066985645933

  I video taped it daily and I really liked that they did not totally wrap up the story every hour and had some plots that ran on for weeks or even months while the case they worked on that day might be closed.

  You also got to know their personal lives also.  The story is best if watched daily so you understand since things as they go along.  There will be references to things that have been going on over the past 5 weeks or more.

1904851,5,B0000ACOYO,"In the past six months I've quickly become obsessed with DaVinci Inquest, which offers a twist on the usual cop genre show by depicting stories of murder and natural death through the eyes of a progressive, hot-tempered, crusading coroner, Dominic DaVinci. Set in Vancouver, BC (Canada), the average US viewer also gets a look at things and thinking that do differentiate our close cousin to the North - for example, the many ethnic cultures that thrive in Vancouver are evident in almost every show, as well as the sad prejudice against the native Canadians (comparable to lingering US prejudice against Indians/Native Americans).

If you've been watching the faded-out, constant re-runs on WGN, it's worth the investment to see these full-color, unedited episodes of the shows.

DaVinci shares his screen time with the equally talented and opinionated stars of the Homicide squad, as well as the peerless forensic investigator ""Chick"" and the all-female M.E.s.  Brimming with a cast of fine actors and compelling, memorable storylines, DaVinci has grabbed me unlike any show since the late, lamented early seasons of Homicide: Life on the Streets, which it resembles in many ways.

It would be horribly unfair to not note the welcome and excellent contributions of DaVinci's long-suffering but incomparable secretary, Helen, who always knows how to speak her mind.

Season One features, in addition to many one-episode stories, three running mysteries: the systematic slaughter of prostitutes; the brutal killings of kidnapped young women throughout the US and Canada; and early development of a long storyline about a dirty Vice cop, Brian.

Unfortunately, this set has no extras other than formatting features for subtitles, etc.",1163894400,22,1733,5.352941176470588

It comes on every Saturday night at about 12:30 and, even though I normally like to go out on Saturday night, I hate missing it. It's difficult to say exactly what it is about this show that pulls you in. But one major thing I love about it is that the writers aren't compelled to neatly wrap-up the loose ends by the time the episode is over. It's a refreshing change and, despite it, I never feel cheated or turned off at the end. Actually, I only feel compelled to see more episodes. As already stated many times, the acting is great, the characters interact very naturally and the dialogue is both realistic and intriguing, but still low-key. You won't see any hysterical over the top acting on this show, which is one of the things I think really sets it apart from many American cop drama shows. It isn't glitzy.

As he works in tandem with the police, some of whom are heroes and other corrupt; city officials; street people; and the like, he is dedicated to learning why people on his watch die before their time, and improving the health and welfare of his beloved city.

I place this as the second-best ""cop"" show ever, second only to the early years of the great, late, lamented ""Homicide: Life on the Streets"" US show of the early 1990s, which ""DaVinci"" echoes in many ways.

Yet, DaVinci is thunderously human, an alkie who still drinks, a man with a broken marriage who has to work daily with his angry ex-wife and who has a beloved teenage daughter with whom he doesn't always connect.

One important thing is that the stories always place work first - the personal lives of the characters are shown, but they never take over the storyline -- no ""jumping the shark.""  A truly great ensemble cast backs up Nicholas Evans, the seemingly inexhaustible actor who plays Dominic.

This all sounds highly melodramatic but the tv show is presented in a low-key, business-like manner.  I was seriously hooked after watching only a few shows and I have yet to be disappointed.",1155081600,22,1290,4.757847533632287

We also laugh about how on Law & Order and other American crime dramas they'd be yelling at the suspect and throwing things around.  The Amer. cop show moods are somber to instant EXTREME anger.  On Da Vinci, these guys listen with quiet respect even to people who are obviously mentally unbalanced.  It's the kind of show I'd want everyone to be like and see.

1904857,5,B0000ACOYO,"This Canadian series is easily miles above most American, ""Glitzy-every-case-solved-with-excitement-by-the-end-of-the-hour"" shows. It clearly shows the handicaps, realitites and daily frustrations of police officers, prosecutors and those in charge.

As a police investigator, I am thrilled with a concept that is hauntingly real. While the show certainly exposes the ""underbelly"" of Vancouver, there are also some very touching, realistic and extremely well acted scenes of the primary characters and how they treat those in bad situations with varying degrees of concern.

This was certainly evident when a drug crazed woman attacked the lead character with a baseball bat. In order to keep her from killing him he throws a punch that knocks her down so he can get her under control. He then apologizes to her twice for hitting her.

This is a very thought-provoking, realistic and gritty drama. It would however, be far less appealing show if not for the incredibly talented ensemble cast, lead by the charismatic Nicholas Campbell as the title character.

The police officers portrayed are pretty much on the money, the pathologists overworked and underfunded and the humor, dark or otherwise, is more realistic than the average ""citizen"" knows. The series shows that it has to be humorous... or the characters would lose it.

If you haven't seen the show or are just recently hooked, get it because it will not disapoint.

However, if you're a fan of neat & tidy Hollywood stories with happy endings, you will probably not be happy with it. If you want great drama... you can't miss with this choice!",1147046400,12,1605,5.177606177606178

1904862,5,B0000ACOYO,"Several months ago, quite by accident, I came across the Da Vinci's Inquest TV show and was instantly hooked.  The show is set in Vancouver, British Columbia, and features an ensemble cast of police, pathologists, criminals, and other denizens of the city, headed up by the Vancouver coroner, Dominick DaVinci, who takes his job seriously indeed.  As he says, his job is to  speak for the dead. Acting, plotting, casting, writing and photography are all excellent. Now the first season is finally available on DVD for all of us who can't often catch the show at the odd hours it is shown in the states. I can't say enough good things about this show!  As I said, I'm hooked.",1142467200,35,674,4.638655462184874
1904863,4,B0000ACOYO,"For those of us in the U.S. who are fortunate enough to have access to Canadian CBC programming on cable television, DaVinci's Inquest will be a familiar offering. It is typical of the literate and sophisticated television offerings which are wholly produced in Canada largely for Canadian audiences. This series involves the Vancouver coroner's department as well as the police department in a series of death investigations which involve serious and often philosophical looks at the contemporary crime scene. The characters are well defined and believable while the acting is uniformly excellent. In particular, the coroner, Domenic DaVinci, played by Nicholas Campbell,is extremely well played. None of your typical U.S. serial pap here. Rather a sensitive and vulnerable coroner with his own personal hang ups, a recovering alchoholic, recently divorced, with a teen age daughter, who is trying to make sense of his personal life as well as provide compassionate understanding to those who find their lives down on the seamy side of Vancouver.

Many will already know that Canada treats drug abuse and prostitution quite differently than is the case in the U.S. This well acted series provides ample discussion of the isues surrounding the handling of social ills in Canada. I believe that it is a must see for those who want not only to be entertained but wish to understand the basis behind the more liberal Canadian thinking on these matters.",1127433600,97,1449,5.1923076923076925
1904864,5,B0000ACOYO,"This may well be the best show out there today. It's a police procedural about a Vancouver coroner, Dominic Da Vinci, and his daily routine. But it's also about his friends and allies: Leary, Shannon and Kosmo in the Homicide Division, Chick the Crime Scene Investigator, Zack the traffic cop, his secretary, Helen. And it's about the dark side of Vancouver. If you loved Homicide: Life on the Street, this is your kind of show. If you love great writing and acting, this is most definitely your kind of show. It has storylines and characters that really hook you in for the long haul. And Nick Campbell (Da Vinci), one of the most celebrated actors in Canada, is backed up by some of the best actors in the business. Even better, though he's in every episode, the other characters get their time in the sun, too. It's not just a one-man show.
My main complaint is...where's the rest of it? Season seven just finished. Season eight has been confirmed and a spin-off show is in production. So, why is only season one out on DVD? Some more extras wouldn't hurt, either. I'd happily buy the rest of the seasons as is, and the quality of what you get is fine, but some commentary from the writers and/or actors would be fun, too.",1107648000,37,1225,4.5225225225225225
1904865,5,B0000ACOYO,"Not too many television shows have ever had this kind of allure. The ensemble cast is tremendous. Nicholas Campbell (Da Vinci) is quite possibly one of the best Canadian actors ever, and if anyone knows the quality we've produced in the past (from Donald Sutherland and Mary Pickford to Michael J. Fox and Jim Carrey... the bases are covered), that's saying something.
To our American converts -- the series is rumoured to be over. In case it's not known in the States, the character of Da Vinci is based on Larry Campbell, who is the present mayor of Vancouver (but who was still Coroner when the show began), who has all the no-nonsense qualities that make Da Vinci so damn loveable.
Chris Haddock, the writer/creator, took a stab at US network TV with the well-written ""The Handler,"" which failed to ever make a market for CBS, and seems to have met its demise after part of the first season, despite a great lead role played by Joe(y) ""Pants"" Pantoliano.
RUMOUR has it that Da Vinci's about to spin off onto a news series where he gets the mayor's seat. I'm looking forward to it. The political wrangling seen in the final 2, 3 episodes of this seventh season was just brilliant and I'd love to see it taken to a new format.
A coworker (and I work in the local film biz in Vancouver and have periodically been lucky enough to work on this in post-production) stated that A&E had once considered picking up Da Vinci for syndicated airing--suspicion is that they went with Crossing Jordan. Write A&E and express your concern.
Meantime, Canadian TV takes a long time to hit DVD. Let's hope this picks up the pace.
Oh, and whoever did the ""Vancouver rocks!"" crap up above--I LOVE MY CITY, but I think you're being a butthead. Use your brain, dude. The city speaks for itself -- but not in Da Vinci, which shows our seedy underbelly more often than not.",1106611200,11,1852,4.564564564564565

The subs are important as some of the dialogue is low key yet meanigful.  I think the publisher is atlantis out of montreal.
The acorn issue, some years later, no longer has subs but does have closed caps for those fotunate enough to care and
also have the AV hookup.
