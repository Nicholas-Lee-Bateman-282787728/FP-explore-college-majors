It seems that independent integrated living for the disabled is as much a quandary in France as here. One moment I liked is when the mother of one of Sabine's fellow residents describes the effects of taking her son's medication by accident. There's also what struck me as a sort of unusual definition of autism by one of Sabine's caseworkers.

3033596,4,B000YNFXSW,"This is a very touching glimpse into the life of a young woman living with autism. Nonetheless, there was one major element that was never mentioned, and which both frustrated and slightly saddened me.

I do not doubt that the institutionalization most likely made her condition much worse, and it is good that she is no longer there. It is also good that they have managed to down her medication to half of what it once was, and obtain care for her in a facility where she can live something more akin to a normal life. Her sister seems to care for her very much, and she is blessed to have such a sister who ensures that she is taken care of.

Yet it saddens me to see the way that the mentally ill are often treated in regards to nutrition. To those on the outside, without much understanding, this might seem like a minor point. However, to watch a young woman in such a condition eating french fries, hamburgers, chocolates, drinking soda, etc.... you have to have some understanding of the impact of nutrition on the body and mental problems to understand that this could have unfairly added to her condition through the years. With the medication on top of it, however reduced the doses might be...argh! It just is so frustrating. Medication can actually lead to the development of further problems. So for example, a depressed person without Bipolar who stays on anti-depressants for five years can end up WITH bipolar. I know that this young woman does not have either of those diagnoses, but her already damaged brain is probably being eaten up, along with her body, through medications and terrible food.

Sadly, I realize there is no easy answer to all of this. Yet I do wish that those in the professions whereby they care for the mentally ill would learn more about the effects of nutrition on individuals. There is just no reason why the medical community should continue to insist that nutrition does not play a role. Of course it does. If what you put in your mouth by way of a pill can affect you, so can food in its own way. I am sad that her family has not been exposed to the information out there so that they could better step in and help her. I wish she could be detoxed of all those years of medication and most likely poor nutrition, and then given a superior regimen for the future. It is a shame that those who care for her on the clinical end are so behind in this. It is not a cure all, I realize that, but it may have given her the chance to slow the deterioration, or even reverse it to some degree.

My rant aside, this is a very unique film. I wish we could have seen more of her trip to New York. It seems to have meant a lot to her. It is wonderful to see that she has those who do care for her, despite their lack of knowledge of the better care that she could perhaps receive. They are clearly at least trying. I just hope that more information comes to help them, and soon.",1445385600,,2912,4.3474264705882355
3033597,3,B000YNFXSW,"Let's begin by examining what this film is not:

This film is not a detailed documentary on autism and how it is handled in France; this film is not an informative study with statistics, or a comprehensive cast; this film does not expose academically inclined future predictions.

This film is simply a chance for directress Sandrine Bonnaire to put together raw footage of her sister, Sabine, across various ages. As such, Bonnaire tells the story of one individual who had a lightly troubled youth, and whose autism really kicked in in her late 20s after being institutionalized for five years.

Sabine is a character we grow to love: we observe her high enthusiasm as she takes adventurous hikes and visits New York City during her teenage years; we watch as she casts tears, flawlessly performing a Bach Prelude; and we are left thinking she was fairly fine during her youth--only an expert could detect symptoms of autism in her behavior. But we contrast the Sabine of a few decades ago to our protagonist: a thirty-something Sabine whose autism has suddenly become acute, such that she must live in a special home along with other friends who suffer similar disorders, disallowing them from communicating and participating in society. We are curious as Sabine persistently asks the same question, either having forgotten the answer, or simply wanting to be certain of it. We are staggered to watch Sabine and her friends become violent and throw food or silverware during mealtime. We are disheartened to find that Sabine has totally foregone her piano skills and cannot quite remember the prelude she previously performed with such zeal.

""Her Name is Sabine"" is gripping, to say the least. Sabine is a real human being like the rest of us; this is not some fictitious story. At the same time, I feel the need to take away a few stars for a few reasons. Firstly, even while this is an artistic exploration of Sabine's life, the documentary still could have incorporated a few items to make it a bit more educational: studies and statistics; footage of other institutions in France handling autistic individuals; and a greater number of interviewees specializing in autistic treatment. Additionally, in her narration, Bonnaire utters such phrases as, ""Using my fame, I was able to open a home,"" making it clear that this film was more a personal or family ego booster than a documentary on such a touchy topic as autism awareness. I would hope that Bonnaire's next project on autism, should she choose to make one, would cover a bit more ground.",1444003200,,2551,4.898148148148148
3033598,5,B000YNFXSW,"Wonderful, yet very sad story.  I have seen some teens and young adults who are autistic and sometimes wonder how much of the behavior is associated with abuse and/or similar to PTSD vs. autism.  I continuously see kids who have extreme reactions such as this young woman, whose parents are using very physically and mentally abusive treatments all approved by so-called specialists.  Those kids with the least amount of services seem to be doing better emotionally.  It is true that autistics feel things very deeply, as many also have sensory processing disorder.  Feeling things deeply and then being subjected to abuse, not always by families, but sometimes by institutions or other experts, I have to wonder.",1442793600,,713,5.112068965517241

3033600,5,B000YNFXSW,"I've always liked this movie as I admired Sandrine Bonnaire for more than 6 years since before and after I got to see Queen to Play. I rented it once on Netflix and I enjoyed it. It made me think of myself in home movies before Sabine was moved to a hospital for 5 years. Then she ended up in a group home. Now I have it in my own home. Just like her, I used to bite my hands when I get angry or upset. I did that until I was 16 going on 17. I stopped biting my hands because I met Sandrine's Queen to Play co-star Kevin Kline as an early birthday present and I shook hands. (I can still see his eyes looking at me.) After I felt and shook hands with him, I decided to stop biting my hands and instead take good care of them no matter what. Both Sabine and I play the piano, travel to New York, speak French. This movie, Osama and Queen to Play are the only foreign language movies I watch. Otherwise, I go and buy region 2 DVDs of my favorite films for kids and adults. This is also apart of my autism research. Dinner at 7 makes sense but bedtime 2 hours after to me doesn't make sense.",1436918400,,1088,3.927601809954751

This movie seems very slow for American audiences used to a much faster pace in movies.  At times I could not tell if it was a documentary or just a movie because there is no plot, developing story or highs and lows in this film.  The camera simply invites itself into the life of a severely autistic young woman and stays around to record everyday experiences and flashbacks to an earlier time.  Some might consider this film very boring.

3033611,5,B000YNFXSW,"As the younger sister of a girl who was born with brain damage, I found this movie particulary familiar.  Monique was not diagnosed with a mental handicap until she was 7 years old.  My parents tried to main-stream her into a Catholic School, but she had great difficulty learning anything.  She was pulled out of school in short order and left to spend her days at home with my Mother. There were no schools for children with special needs at that time (late 50's to early 60's). When she became violent at puberty, my Mother made the heart-wrenching decision to institutionalize her.  From there, she went down hill fast.

Like Sabine, Monique was a beautiful child, and her handicap was not readily evident.  By her early 20's, there was no mistaking that she was different.  It makes me wonder if institutionalizing girls like Sabine and Monique sets them up for a life-time of even worse problems.  I can't help but think that both of these young women did not get the proper care, and so their condition degraded to the point where they could never live independently and that they would never achieve their true potential.

This movie made me want to call Monique more often.  I was transfixed by Sabines's story.",1362528000,6,1220,4.712264150943396

3033615,5,B000YNFXSW,"What is and what will never be - sad but true.  How different life could have been for autistic Sabine if she had not been institutionalized.  To see the contrast of ""before"" and ""after"" is truly saddening.  I can only imagine the regret her family suffers for having let her languish in that institution for so long.  Even yet, this one slip is not the end of all hope.  With love and proper care, Sabine can be brought back, bit by bit - and although she will likely never again be the person she once was, at least she will have a better quality of life going forward.  A win-win situation, for her, for her family, for everyone.  This is a wonderful documentary.",1348963200,2,666,4.365853658536586
3033616,5,B000YNFXSW,"A courageous documentary of her own sister's passage from youth to middle-age, in a neutral style - yet it evokes pathos, ethos, and at least for me - great sadness. Also, it seems that the effects of medicines on Sabine are quite drastic and telling. A parent's description of the of her accidentally taking her son's medicine and how she felt are quite poignant. As is the gut-wrenching, heart-shredding feeling, of watching Sabine perhaps realizing the loss of her own pre-medicinal 'normal' self into a darker more restrictive world post her institutionalization. It is a an enlightening and humbling documentary to watch. Sabine's move to a home allows her to be more free again, and seems like a better place to be. The lack of appropriate institutions to care for our loved ones in our 'top of the world' societies is obvious.",1341532800,3,833,4.873239436619718
3033617,5,B000YNFXSW,"Have you noticed that many of the constructive films of our age are coming out of France?  They go beyond gratuitous sex and violence and meaningless car chases.  If you are wondering what I am talking about, try Microcosmos, and try Her Name is Sabine.  Hats off to the French.

While the world waits for all human problems to be solved by technological innovation, we need to take notice when technology--in this case movie-making--is directed beyond mindless escape.

Autism, and mental illness in general, haunt many families, and isolate them from resources supporting the majority of the population.  In facing autism, society gropes forward seeking solutions.  Those who sit on the outside and watch lack understanding, and those caught on the inside suffer.  This movie is a bridge, a gift of insight, a cry for help for those who have been stranded in a no man's land of mental isolation, a cry of love from one sister to another.",1331337600,2,939,4.861635220125786
3033618,5,B000YNFXSW,"So beautiful. So gifted. But with a neurological problem which causes her to lash out at herself and others. Her mother and siblings are bewildered, and unsure how to help her. As life takes its course and her siblings move away to their families and careers, Sabine, stuck in childhood, feels angry and abandoned. Her behavior deteriorates, and after trying to find other solutions, she is institutionalized. The toxic medications and shock of the experience leave her devastated.

This film picks up at a point in which Sabine has been removed from the institution, and placed into a group care home by her sister Sandrine. Sandrine Bonnaire, the auteur of this film, and a famous French actress, had lobbied to create the group home simply to improve her sister Sabine's life. This film follows the day to day life of Sabine and the handful of other residents. Personalized compassionate care is given each one; at first I felt outraged they were not allowed to rest, or the epileptic given a wheelchair. Then I realized, the staff makes a constant effort to push each one just past the point of comfort, to keep them from stagnating. When they truly cannot, the staff steps in without judgment. Indeed, as the staff are drooled on, spat at, bitten and hit, and never lose temper, one sees why there are so few homes like this. Such saints do not grow on trees. It is very touching how endlessly patient the staff are with the residents of the group home.

This is not a film to watch if you become sad easily. This is not a feel good 'triumph of the spirit' movie. This is daily life put to film. The good news is that Sabine improved after living in this group home. The bad news is that for her and the other residents, this house in the country, with flies buzzing, and day trips to buy some clothes, or eat at a fast food place, are as good as it gets. Sandrine Bonnaire has made a gem of a love letter to her sister. We cannot forget her or the other residents. Her name is Sabine; and this film is heartbreaking.",1324252800,10,2022,4.506811989100817
3033619,5,B000YNFXSW,"I just recently watched Sandrine Bonnaire's excellent film about chess- Queen to Play- and found the movie Sabine as a result of the discovery of the film about chess.

Sandrine Bonnaire makes a hauntingly lovely film about her impaired sister and manages to do so in a loving way which I thought was not exploitative. As someone who is familiar with individuals who have similar syndromes, I found the film very true to life but also wondered about the accuracy of the diagnosis of autism. I was also curious as regards the obvious decline in Sabine's disease- was this due to medication/damage (as the film suggests) or to the progression of the condition? It seems to me that Sandrine Bonnaire's portrayal of the title character in the Vagabonde may have been influenced by her exposure to Sabine.

The film makes the clear point that families- including those of the rich and powerful- must struggle mightily to provide humane decent care for their relatives- and that much of the struggle is left to each family to develop on their own.

The film is ultimately haunting, affecting and true-to-life. I agree with other reviewers that the individuals who patiently provide care to Sabine and her housemates and who in other settings are often poorly compensated for this difficult work- deserve recognition.",1318204800,4,1310,4.972602739726027

So for example, a depressed person without Bipolar who stays on anti-depressants for five years can end up WITH bipolar. I know that this young woman does not have either of those diagnoses, but her already damaged brain is probably being eaten up, along with her body, through medications and terrible food.

Sadly, I realize there is no easy answer to all of this. Yet I do wish that those in the professions whereby they care for the mentally ill would learn more about the effects of nutrition on individuals. There is just no reason why the medical community should continue to insist that nutrition does not play a role. Of course it does. If what you put in your mouth by way of a pill can affect you, so can food in its own way. I am sad that her family has not been exposed to the information out there so that they could better step in and help her. I wish she could be detoxed of all those years of medication and most likely poor nutrition, and then given a superior regimen for the future. It is a shame that those who care for her on the clinical end are so behind in this. It is not a cure all, I realize that, but it may have given her the chance to slow the deterioration, or even reverse it to some degree.

My rant aside, this is a very unique film. I wish we could have seen more of her trip to New York. It seems to have meant a lot to her. It is wonderful to see that she has those who do care for her, despite their lack of knowledge of the better care that she could perhaps receive. They are clearly at least trying. I just hope that more information comes to help them, and soon.",1445385600,,2912,4.3474264705882355
3268094,3,B000YNFXSW,"Let's begin by examining what this film is not:

This film is not a detailed documentary on autism and how it is handled in France; this film is not an informative study with statistics, or a comprehensive cast; this film does not expose academically inclined future predictions.

This film is simply a chance for directress Sandrine Bonnaire to put together raw footage of her sister, Sabine, across various ages. As such, Bonnaire tells the story of one individual who had a lightly troubled youth, and whose autism really kicked in in her late 20s after being institutionalized for five years.

Sabine is a character we grow to love: we observe her high enthusiasm as she takes adventurous hikes and visits New York City during her teenage years; we watch as she casts tears, flawlessly performing a Bach Prelude; and we are left thinking she was fairly fine during her youth--only an expert could detect symptoms of autism in her behavior. But we contrast the Sabine of a few decades ago to our protagonist: a thirty-something Sabine whose autism has suddenly become acute, such that she must live in a special home along with other friends who suffer similar disorders, disallowing them from communicating and participating in society. We are curious as Sabine persistently asks the same question, either having forgotten the answer, or simply wanting to be certain of it. We are staggered to watch Sabine and her friends become violent and throw food or silverware during mealtime. We are disheartened to find that Sabine has totally foregone her piano skills and cannot quite remember the prelude she previously performed with such zeal.

""Her Name is Sabine"" is gripping, to say the least. Sabine is a real human being like the rest of us; this is not some fictitious story. At the same time, I feel the need to take away a few stars for a few reasons. Firstly, even while this is an artistic exploration of Sabine's life, the documentary still could have incorporated a few items to make it a bit more educational: studies and statistics; footage of other institutions in France handling autistic individuals; and a greater number of interviewees specializing in autistic treatment. Additionally, in her narration, Bonnaire utters such phrases as, ""Using my fame, I was able to open a home,"" making it clear that this film was more a personal or family ego booster than a documentary on such a touchy topic as autism awareness. I would hope that Bonnaire's next project on autism, should she choose to make one, would cover a bit more ground.",1444003200,,2551,4.898148148148148
3268095,5,B000YNFXSW,"Wonderful, yet very sad story.  I have seen some teens and young adults who are autistic and sometimes wonder how much of the behavior is associated with abuse and/or similar to PTSD vs. autism.  I continuously see kids who have extreme reactions such as this young woman, whose parents are using very physically and mentally abusive treatments all approved by so-called specialists.  Those kids with the least amount of services seem to be doing better emotionally.  It is true that autistics feel things very deeply, as many also have sensory processing disorder.  Feeling things deeply and then being subjected to abuse, not always by families, but sometimes by institutions or other experts, I have to wonder.",1442793600,,713,5.112068965517241

Now I have it in my own home. Just like her, I used to bite my hands when I get angry or upset. I did that until I was 16 going on 17. I stopped biting my hands because I met Sandrine's Queen to Play co-star Kevin Kline as an early birthday present and I shook hands. (I can still see his eyes looking at me.) After I felt and shook hands with him, I decided to stop biting my hands and instead take good care of them no matter what. Both Sabine and I play the piano, travel to New York, speak French. This movie, Osama and Queen to Play are the only foreign language movies I watch. Otherwise, I go and buy region 2 DVDs of my favorite films for kids and adults.

3268108,5,B000YNFXSW,"As the younger sister of a girl who was born with brain damage, I found this movie particulary familiar.  Monique was not diagnosed with a mental handicap until she was 7 years old.  My parents tried to main-stream her into a Catholic School, but she had great difficulty learning anything.  She was pulled out of school in short order and left to spend her days at home with my Mother. There were no schools for children with special needs at that time (late 50's to early 60's). When she became violent at puberty, my Mother made the heart-wrenching decision to institutionalize her.  From there, she went down hill fast.

Like Sabine, Monique was a beautiful child, and her handicap was not readily evident.  By her early 20's, there was no mistaking that she was different.  It makes me wonder if institutionalizing girls like Sabine and Monique sets them up for a life-time of even worse problems.  I can't help but think that both of these young women did not get the proper care, and so their condition degraded to the point where they could never live independently and that they would never achieve their true potential.

While the world waits for all human problems to be solved by technological innovation, we need to take notice when technology--in this case movie-making--is directed beyond mindless escape.

Autism, and mental illness in general, haunt many families, and isolate them from resources supporting the majority of the population.  In facing autism, society gropes forward seeking solutions.  Those who sit on the outside and watch lack understanding, and those caught on the inside suffer.  This movie is a bridge, a gift of insight, a cry for help for those who have been stranded in a no man's land of mental isolation, a cry of love from one sister to another.",1331337600,2,939,4.861635220125786
3268115,5,B000YNFXSW,"So beautiful. So gifted. But with a neurological problem which causes her to lash out at herself and others. Her mother and siblings are bewildered, and unsure how to help her. As life takes its course and her siblings move away to their families and careers, Sabine, stuck in childhood, feels angry and abandoned. Her behavior deteriorates, and after trying to find other solutions, she is institutionalized. The toxic medications and shock of the experience leave her devastated.

This film picks up at a point in which Sabine has been removed from the institution, and placed into a group care home by her sister Sandrine. Sandrine Bonnaire, the auteur of this film, and a famous French actress, had lobbied to create the group home simply to improve her sister Sabine's life. This film follows the day to day life of Sabine and the handful of other residents. Personalized compassionate care is given each one; at first I felt outraged they were not allowed to rest, or the epileptic given a wheelchair. Then I realized, the staff makes a constant effort to push each one just past the point of comfort, to keep them from stagnating. When they truly cannot, the staff steps in without judgment. Indeed, as the staff are drooled on, spat at, bitten and hit, and never lose temper, one sees why there are so few homes like this. Such saints do not grow on trees. It is very touching how endlessly patient the staff are with the residents of the group home.

This is not a film to watch if you become sad easily. This is not a feel good 'triumph of the spirit' movie. This is daily life put to film. The good news is that Sabine improved after living in this group home. The bad news is that for her and the other residents, this house in the country, with flies buzzing, and day trips to buy some clothes, or eat at a fast food place, are as good as it gets.

Sandrine Bonnaire makes a hauntingly lovely film about her impaired sister and manages to do so in a loving way which I thought was not exploitative. As someone who is familiar with individuals who have similar syndromes, I found the film very true to life but also wondered about the accuracy of the diagnosis of autism. I was also curious as regards the obvious decline in Sabine's disease- was this due to medication/damage (as the film suggests) or to the progression of the condition? It seems to me that Sandrine Bonnaire's portrayal of the title character in the Vagabonde may have been influenced by her exposure to Sabine.

The film makes the clear point that families- including those of the rich and powerful- must struggle mightily to provide humane decent care for their relatives- and that much of the struggle is left to each family to develop on their own.

The film is ultimately haunting, affecting and true-to-life. I agree with other reviewers that the individuals who patiently provide care to Sabine and her housemates and who in other settings are often poorly compensated for this difficult work- deserve recognition.",1318204800,4,1310,4.972602739726027

I watched the film this morning and Sabine has stayed with me all day and likely will for a long time.  We see videos of her in her adolescence, playful, often grinning, her speech and facial expressions seeming natural. Then the footage shifts to contemporary scenes,  which indicate a dramatic cognitive and behavioral decline, her speech labored, her gait awkward, lumbering, her affect flat, fixed. Never specifically diagnosed until her 30s, her behavior becoming more difficult and little understood, Sabine spent 5 years in a psychiatric institution. The interruption in family life and separation, are they the precipitants for the decline or is this more of a natural progression over time for Sabine's particular circumstances?  The film seems to painfully pose and explore that question. What is so striking and unflinchingly captured here are elements of Sabine's own emotional experience, particularly in her continual request for reassurance that the people she loves, especially Sandrine, will keep returning to her.

In this documentary about her sister she tries to underline the importance of having reception centers especially adapted for autistic persons. I think the approach is interesting because you can see Sabine Before and After her 5 year stays in psychiatric hospital. Before she was happy beautiful and full of life. It seems that just after she looked like a zombie, having been under strong medication (with any diagnosis really established!!!!) gaining 30 kg. In this documentary we can note the consequences of internment: she is still anxious (but certainly less than a few years before) and sometimes violent (physically and orally). Yet, she is on the right way even if she might not be like before the internment.
This documentary is also a wonderful act of love from Bonnaire to her sister. It is incredible what Sandrine and other families do for their beloved; how little they are supported and how much they have to fight so people like Sabine are respected, listened to and taken care of in dignity.
 This film helped also the French society to take conscience at least for a while that it was time to create structures like the one in Juignac for Sabine and her peers so they could communicate better with the other world around them.
