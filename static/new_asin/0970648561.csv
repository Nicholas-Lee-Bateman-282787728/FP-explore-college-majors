173573,4,0970648561,"Excellent technique for leaders contained within the sequences that are taught. Also nice and clear that the sequences are not the end game, but provide the foundations and building blocks for you to choose how and when to use. Highly recommended for tango leaders.",1178928000,2,265,5.045454545454546
173574,5,0970648561,"This video is great for women. It has so many variations of the argentine walk, which of course a woman should know how to follow, that when a man is learning all these variations, it's a perfect exercise/practice for a woman. I especially like the various view angles and close-up of the footwork in this video, which demonstrate so well how properly to step in rhythm with the argentine tango music. Very effective instructional video.",1022716800,35,437,4.84

7794226,5,0970648561,"This instructional DVD is clear, repeated dance patterns form different perspectives, each pattern repeated in slow motion.

If Fabian adds to this series I will purchase them",1393632000,2,175,5.481481481481482
7794227,5,0970648561,Very clear explanations and steps shown from many levels and directions. Very well made video with good verbal explanations on top of good clear images.,1384819200,2,152,5.12
7794228,5,0970648561,Very well demonstrated - easy to follow instructions - the lessons are well broken down in easy instalments and flow from one into the other.,1362614400,3,141,4.68
7794229,5,0970648561,"Fantastic videos. My husband and I started learning from these videos and loved them. Mr. Falas is a fantastic teacher.  His partner in the video is a great dance and gorgeous. Together, they are quite inspiring. The only problem we had going through the lessons was that my husband, who has never dance before nor has any knowledge or experience with any forms of dance, likes to teach dancing! So we either had to quit or get a divorce, so quit dancing.",1352851200,3,455,4.548780487804878
7794230,2,0970648561,"I am glad I didn't buy this (got it as a gift). It's not great. The breakdown is not very thorough at all. You will be doing most of the teaching yourself because there isn't much instruction here, just videotaping of patterns. The instruction for the leader or the follower isn't there. It's just watch and follow. You're not going to learn tango from a video anyway. You can have all the steps in the world and still be a beginner if you can't dance with a partner. And that can only happen with real people. Normally I would say get a video to supplement your class, but I'd skip this one. There isn't enough break down to know what you are doing or if you are doing it correctly. On the positive side, everything is very easy to see. The lighting is good and you get full body shots.",1325030400,2,787,4.253333333333333
