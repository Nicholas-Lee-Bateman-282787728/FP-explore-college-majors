6787388,5,B00P2S21W0,"The 6 Dr Gillespie features with Lionel Barrymore are finally out on DVD. MGM followed with these films when they lost Lew Ayres as Dr Kildare due to his pacifist leanings and he finally consented to go to war as a non-combatant medical orderly. As you may recall Ayres, a fine actor, was the star of Universal's 1930 hit, All Quiet on the Western Front. Barrymore continues the character he created in the Kildare series. Van Johnson came in to assist along with Keye Luke. I think this release marks the final 1930-50 MGM feature film series to DVD. This leaves, probably, the MGM Fitzpatrick Traveltalks color series that have not appeared on DVD in a special collection in the Warner Archive Collection and I look forward to those.",1419724800,5,735,4.705426356589148
6787389,5,B00P2S21W0,Great series. I enjoyed just as much if not more than the Dr. Kildare series.  It is great to see Nat Peddleton back.  Keye Luke is fabulous in this series as is Van Johnson.  I just wish there had been more entries in this series,1419724800,7,230,4.066666666666666

6787391,5,B00P2S21W0,"Finally, we get Lionel Barrymore's Dr. Gillespie on DVD!  In my review of THE DR. KILDARE FILM SERIES earlier this year, I voiced a wish that Warner Archive would issue the Dr. Gillespie series.  I doubt that my wishing aloud had anything to do with this release, but I'm glad to see it nonetheless.

Dr. Gillespie was Dr. Kildare's attending physician at Blair General Hospital, perfectly played by Lionel Barrymore.  Crusty and curmudgeonly but with a heart of gold, he was the highlight of the Kildare series.  At the height of that series, Lew Ayres was sacked from MGM and Gillespie moved to top billing for 6 additional films.  He works with new ""assistants"" (interns/residents) in these films, notably Van Johnson and Keye Luke.  The same supporting cast is back with guest bits from many up and coming MGM stars like Donna Reed.

The pathology seems generally limited to ""mental cases,"" but the series is entertaining.  The 6 films are spread across 3 discs.  The version of this set I purchased from Amazon is burned, but Warner Archive is also selling the set through their website and mentions that the initial run of the set is traditionally authored (pressed).  The only extra features are trailers.

It's fun to see these again as they've generally not been circulated except on TCM.  By the last film in the series, Barrymore is almost reduced to an incidental character in a more or less film noir (DARK DELUSION, 1947).",1416960000,26,1436,4.812244897959184

6787405,5,B00P2S21W0,"When Lew Ayres moved on from his very popular movie series Dr. Kildare MGM was astute enough to know that his mentor Dr. Gillespie was popular enough with the movie going audience (and why not he was played by the incomparable Lionel Barrymore) that he could continue the series under his name alone. So They brought in a couple of contract players to be his foils (Keye Luke (Charlie Chan #1 Son) and future heart throb Van Johnson).  They kept Nat Pendleton and his trusty tire iron and Alma Kruger (Molly Bird) as Gillespie's ever vigilant and crusty head nurse.  With this team and a galaxy of visiting Doctors and great guest stars this series managed another six movies (the original Dr. Kildare did nine) and were almost equally popular.

This is MGM studio movie making at it's best with all the social commentary (some of it not very P.C. these days) and focus on Family values not to mention the cutting edge of medical research at the time.  The ensemble cast's chemistry carries the day and the stories are interesting and entertaining.

You can't go wrong with this series, and besides, your Dr. Kildare collection will never be complete without it even if Dr. Kildare is gone!!",1426291200,7,1191,4.706730769230769

6787407,5,B00P2S21W0,"As I descended into the 40's world of Dr. Gillespie,
Van Johnson: bobbysoxer's dream, and
the innocent, innocuous world of my childhood,
I realized that for a 78 year old, I need to go back
and not live in the present.  Each movie was
enjoyable if you love the 40's style and have
memories of this world.  I definitely got into each
movie very well and was able to see the MGM
perfection that was status quo for the studio.
Yes, this was a 40's soap opera that tried to be
an A movie, what is wrong with a B movie.
Some of them I remember even more than
the A features I saw.  Of course, in my childhood,
Bela Lugosi was some kind of A movie star
and I didn't see why this was not the case until
well into the 50's.  I am a retarded 40's person
who definitely has trouble living in the present.
At 78, I make my own rules and so Dr. Gillespie
movies are definitely larger than life and I am
not ashamed of this.",1423180800,21,911,4.016574585635359

8686273,3,B00P2S21W0,"Husband gave me the Dr. Kildare series for Christmas, and I would rate those films with five stars.  The problem with Dr. Gillespie is the less than stellar supporting cast; I have never been a fan of Van Johnson and his performances here are lukewarm at best.  Marilyn Maxwell, supposedly madly in love with Johnson, is the silliest character in the entire series and wastes a lot of our time running around like an idiot after Johnson.  But once again the great Lionel Barrymore saves the day, so these are worth watching if, like me, you are a die-hard Barrymore fan.  I will watch anything he is in; just wish Lew Ayres had been able to continue to give the series a role worthy of being Barrymore's co-conspirator in medical miracles.",1485561600,,739,4.6183206106870225
