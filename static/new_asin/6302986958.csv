7832992,5,6302986958,"The headline for the 1988 World Series was the game-winning pinch-hit home run in the bottom of the ninth by an essentially crippled Kirk Gibson off of the game's dominant relief pitcher, Dennis Eckersley, that gave the Los Angeles Dodgers a Game 1 victory over the Oakland A's. Gibson would be named National League MVP for that season but this would be his only appearance in the World Series. The result was a moment that is surpassed only by the famous home runs hit by Bobby Thompson and Carlton Fisk in terms of being replayed over and over again.
However, the story of the 1988 World Series was Dodger ace Orel Hersheiser, who won both Game 2 and the final Game 5. Hersheiser did not start the series because he had pitched the team's Game 7 victory over the New York Mets in the NL Championship Series. Durign the season he finished as strong as anybody in the history of the game by pitching six straight shutouts, breaking Don Drysdale's consecutive scoreless innings pitched record. Consequently, Hersheiser would win the Cy Young and the MVP awards for both the NLCS and the World Series. The man was on such a role that year that in Game 2 he got as many hits (three) as he gave up to the A's in pitching a shutout.
You have to keep in mind that Oakland was supposed to win the series. They had won 104 games during the regular season and swept the Boston Red Sox in the ALCS. Their lineup included the Bash Brothers, Jose Canseco and Mark McGwire, and they had the best reliever in the game in Eckersley; which made Gibson's improbably home run all the more amazing. I just remember how angry my father was when Gibson hit that homer (he is a lifelong bi-coastal Giants fan, so I should not have to explain the animosity). For fans of the Dodgers this is the last big moment of glory the team has enjoyed and needs to be savored (at least until the team has new ownership or a lot better luck). You also get to hear the players and managers talk about the pivotal twist of fate that turned the series around for L.A. This would be the first of three consecutive trips to the Fall Classic for the A's, who would avoid the Buffalo Bills comparisons by winning their one title during this run the following season.
Good news for baseball fans: With this video for the 1988 World Series these tapes start being at least an hour long. This one clocks in at 60 minutes.",1068076800,,2377,4.429223744292237
