2446368,3,B000BYA5C8,"If the weather is bad outside, you can't go wrong with watching episodes of Overhaulin if you love cars. The Foose designs can be great, but the hosts make the show worth watching.",1391558400,,180,4.484848484848484
2446369,5,B000BYA5C8,Chip Foose has to be one the best and most professional in the car restoration business.  Best show on TV.,1389830400,,106,4.3

2446372,5,B000BYA5C8,I love it......I don't have cable tv...so I don't get this show  &  I  am too cheap to get cable or dish tv...so when I saw this offered 4prime free I jumped at it!!!!!,1376438400,,168,3.8823529411764706
2446373,4,B000BYA5C8,I really enjoy watching Overhaulin.  The second season was better than the first season.  The pranks got better and they started showing the cars in action instead of just sitting there.  Worth watching for anyone who loves pranks and/or cars.,1368489600,,243,5.025
2446374,5,B000BYA5C8,"Great season of Overhaulin'.  I'm surprised that Soldier is misspelled on episode 15, though. Can someone fix that?  Otherwise, that was my favorite episode.",1355529600,,157,5.5
2446375,5,B000BYA5C8,I brought this for my husband for a surprise present. I got brownie points for over a year now. He is still bragging to his friends about how I surprised him with the best present in the world. A must have for any rev head!,1353715200,,223,3.977777777777778
2446376,5,B000BYA5C8,GREAT DVD.  I WATCH WITH MY HUSBAND AND DREAM OF BEING OVER HAULED.  CHIP FOOS IS A MASTER.,1241654400,,91,4.0
2446377,5,B000BYA5C8,My husband is a huge Overhaulin' / Chip Foose fan.  So I originally bought these dvds for him.  But I think I have enjoyed them just as much if not more.  If you're into cars these rock!,1195257600,,186,3.972972972972973
8094197,3,B000BYA5C8,I did not notice it was a European version. I was at least able to get a computer to play European DVDs,1502841600,,103,3.727272727272727
8094198,1,B000BYA5C8,$115 for a single season?? Is it made of gold? Wtf!,1487635200,,51,3.727272727272727
8094199,5,B000BYA5C8,"OK, the trickery used to obtain the cars is hit or miss but the work on the cars and the results are still unbeaten despite the proliferation of ""restomod"" shows since Overhaulin' hit the scene. The work is the result of the genius of Chip Foose but the show, as a show, is driven by genial host Chris Jacobs. The show is upbeat, fun, and family friendly. There's nary a bleep needed for  ""the A team"" although the car owners drop the occasional blue word.",1463875200,,456,4.364705882352941
8094200,5,B000BYA5C8,Foose and the crew build more Masterpieces!,1463184000,,43,5.285714285714286
8094201,4,B000BYA5C8,"Steal a car, spend a couple hundred thousand on upgrades, torture the owner for seven days, then give the car back.  The owners reaction  to the final reveal give the series it's raison d'tre.  (in short, ""appeal"" for those of you not of a literary bent, or maybe just plain bent, period.)  I could do w/o a lot of the minutia that goes into getting the car up to speed so I'll usually fast forward thru a lot of the sanding, painting and other boring activities.",1459900800,,463,4.348837209302325
8094202,5,B000BYA5C8,great,1446249600,,5,5.0
8094203,3,B000BYA5C8,Good,1442361600,,4,4.0
8094204,2,B000BYA5C8,"LOVE the show, hate that while we were getting into it you removed it from being included in the prime unlimited streaming.",1395705600,,123,4.636363636363637
8094205,5,B000BYA5C8,Enjoy the show and want more episodes available on Amazon.  Want to see all the others seasons that were made for this show.,1393545600,,124,4.391304347826087
8094206,5,B000BYA5C8,One of the best reality shows. Very little extra drama besides the pranks they pull on the owner while they have their car.,1392336000,,123,4.391304347826087
