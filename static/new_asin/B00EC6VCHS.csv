5901386,5,B00EC6VCHS,"This is the newest Wiggles DVD currently out in the US. My nearly one year old LOVES the Wiggles and this DVD does not disappoint. It is a lifesaver whenever she's really fussy or crawling all over and we need a moment to do something or just to breath. Just a note for those who enjoy the life performances, this DVD does not have that. It's more like a normal show with regular videos. I love that as I'm not a fan of the live performances, but that's just  a personal preference.",1395187200,,482,4.239130434782608
5901387,5,B00EC6VCHS,"Purchased this as a birthday present for my 2 year old. She loves it. The four year old calls this the ""new wiggles"" and is quite delighted by the song that the ""real wiggles"" join them for. Great wiggles music, dancing and education. I'm thankful they've found a way to keep their empire going strong!",1393891200,,302,4.509090909090909
5901388,4,B00EC6VCHS,"Furry Tales is probably best described as a companion video to the Taking Off DVD except with a theme on animals this time out. In addition to Wiggly Halloween, these three DVDs covers all the songs currently featured on the US Sprout channel Wiggles show (although the skits are only in the TV shows).

Furry Tales is a very solid release, but I have to say a lot of the songs are very much filler material and do not contain many new songs that will become Wiggles classics. Taking Off had the excellent Do the Propeller, Peanut Butter, Buckle Up, Got My Glasses On, Bowtiful, Simons Cold Water Blues, etc. Lots of great ones. Wiggly Halloween didn't have a ton of great originals either so maybe they used up all the A material for Taking Off.

That said, a huge favorite with the family on Furry Tales is Say the Dance, Do the Dance. Such a catchy tune and it looks like the Wiggles are having a ton of fun in the video. I wasn't a big fan of the Coroboree Frog song at first as it seemed like it was trying to hard, but its grown on me.

Theres the usual covers of classic Wiggles songs and the best is the new rendition of Henrys Dance. I really like this version the best although its hard to beat Gregs vocal on the original. This new version just has more zip to it even though they love to say Jeah Cmon! all the time now. The new version of Wake up Jeff, now called Wake up Lachy, just sounds strange with the new name. Its awkward.

There are a handful of half-baked tunes that aren't terrible, but very mediocre. The kids will still sit through it without asking to skip so I guess they are okay, but they don't get them off their feet like the better songs on the DVD.

If you have Taking Off and Wiggly Halloween, you should definitely get Furry Tales. This new Wiggles crew is off to a great start. Hopefully they can get back to making new songs similar to the Taking Off DVD, but the trend seems to indicate we are going to get more filler.",1393804800,,1958,4.238605898123325

Other favorites in our house include the dance along pop-rock tune ""Say the Dance, Do the Dance"", pint-sized speed rock tune ""Bunny Hop"", and ""The Corroboree Frog"". Several songs feature Australian animals, which adds a unique educational layer to this collection for overseas audiences like us, and there's plenty of dancing to follow along with for energetic kids. Simon and Captain Feathersword's performance of ""Five Little Ducks"" is particularly charming. Toddlers, preschoolers, and kindergarteners will get the most out of this video, but the music is arranged and produced well enough to be enjoyable for parents, too.",1464048000,,847,5.281481481481482

5901438,4,B00EC6VCHS,"So my family are Wiggles fans from way back - our oldest was obsessed with The Wiggles back in the day, and by that I mean WAY back...when Greg, Jeff, Murray, and Anthony ( a slightly portlier Anthony, mind you) were just becoming known in America.  We went to a couple of concerts.  Then a few years later we worried when Greg retired, but welcomed Sam.  We followed them for a while, bid Sam a sad farewell, and only now that our youngest is getting into it, have watched the ""new"" generation.

And this is hard.  Because they are wearing the shirts.  They are singing the songs.  The Captain is there.  Anthony is there.  But it's kind of like growing up with Journey in the 80s, then going to a nostalgia tour and the only guy you know is Neal Schon.  Something is just off.  Maybe there's chemistry missing, maybe it's just a sense that the group hasn't gelled yet, or maybe it's something else, but if you are familiar with the original Wiggles then this will be very weird for you.

That isn't to say production values are lacking here.  They aren't.  And if you watch closely you may see a classic member or two involved.  Certainly the segments aren't as extravagant as past videos, where you may see a dozen or more performers.  This time around, things are closer, more intimate, and allude back to the small production values of the classic videos.

All this said, while it was weird for me, my youngest certainly loved it.  Dancing and moving to the music, and watching with rapt attention for the non-musical bits.  So given that, I'd say this is a win, mostly.  I think the cast is still a little awkward, but kids likely won't notice much.  A good video for car rides, but even better at home where kids can get up and move around.",1432512000,2,1747,4.430817610062893

As the boys began to know and participate in the songs on ""Taking Off"", we then purchased Furry Tales.  The new Wiggles are on our local cable on the Sprout channel and some of the songs on this DVD are played on the TV regularly (Say the Dance, Do the Dance, Henry's Dance, Monkey Dance, Corroboree frog, Bunny Hop, Scrub a dub dub in the tub...) Some of the songs were new to us though and have yet to catch the attention of my boys (Tasmanian Tiger, Cockatoo hairdo for example). I rated Yummy Yummy and Wiggletime as 5 stars as the songs on those DVD's are so catchy, easy to follow, and most have easy body/hand motions that my 16 month olds love to do. As the Wiggles progressed over the years, their songs and hand motions became more complex I think. I rated this down to a 4 star only because not every song captured my boys' attention like some of the earlier Wiggles DVDs did. I would still recommend purchasing this DVD if you already have most of the other Wiggles DVD's that are out there.",1401148800,5,1074,4.343283582089552
