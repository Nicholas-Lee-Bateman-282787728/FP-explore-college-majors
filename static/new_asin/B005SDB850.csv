This movie starts off with a ten minute lying in bed post affair with mistress while both are still obviously naked scene.  We see everything of her (you see everything of him later in the film) and really well being you've seen it all you start to get bored of this scene with still nine minutes or so of it to go, as they're just having pointless conversation which isn't essential to the plot at all.  Then we so a long boring scene at the kitchen table with the guy and his wife and kid.  Then we have a long boring scene where the  couple argue over buying a snow board for their daughter since she wrote a letter and asked Santa. She wants a pink one, but it's too big for their daughter, so he wants the stores only smaller one, but she doesn't want her daughter having something with skeletons on it.  This a long drawn out conversation that goes for another ten minutes or so.  Then there's a scene of the the mistress wanting to give a present to the daughter she's bought, but the dad understandably not wanting to get caught is apprehensive about this.  Then we have a long scene of the dad talking to the wife on the phone while driving with his daughter beside him, the wife's workplace has gone on a sudden strike so she will come to the dentist appointment (with the mistress) where their  daughter is getting new braces. He tries to talk her out of it, she insists.  Then we have the actual visit to the dentist, not so the wife can get a few clues he's having an affair, no to see an actual consultation where the daughter behaves like a brat wanting to see bear drawings that she saw last time to pick the design of her braces, the mother and father debating if she should get temporary braces being the girl doesn't have adult teeth yet and well who knows I tuned out a lot of it I was that bored.

This is a movie that we see too much.  We don't just hint and show a few seconds of what happens.  Such as at one point the mistress and husband decide to make out for five minutes when he was going to just walk out the door.  A normal edited movie with show him closing the door turning around and the two making out for a few seconds then cut to the next scene, since we can work out what happens.  This one just has us creepily watch them make out for five minutes.

8484799,3,B005SDB850,"For this being a new Romanian film, I can understand the explicit nudity, but I think the nudity, for a shocking opening scene to lure the viewer in is old stuff.  The viewer is forced to watch a couple engage in playfulness in full nudity while on a bed.  The scene goes on more than 10 minutes; then, we cut to the family middle aged Paul shares a home with Adriana and their 9 year-old daughter.

Paul is having a sexual affair with the female dentist of his daughter; this affair is passionate and we follow Paul struggling with his love for someone other than his wife.

There isn't a lot goin' on here, it lacks any soundtrack, lacks varying stages of emotion by Paul, he just waits for the time to make his secret known to his wife.  There are not a lot of characters, and mostly, the viewer is just observing wondering and waiting for each step.  However, as I said, not much happens; nothing memorable, not much in defining moments. The film drags considerably as we wait for something!

Aside from the lack of any moving or memorable scenes, the subtitles move quickly and oftentimes, there is a lot of printed dialogue that moves too quick!

I was not impressed about this slow, quiet film.......Rizzo

8484801,5,B005SDB850,"What  a great movie. Three main characters, a sensual start followed by a lot of routine behind which drama unfolds. The plot is simple, but behind all the flat dialogues the tension is slowly building up. The end of the movie is simple but astounding. One of the best Romanian movies in the last 10 years.",1326412800,6,306,4.464285714285714
8484802,3,B005SDB850,"I promise: it's mere coincidence that Tuesday, After Christmas will be releasing on Tuesday, after Christmas. The Romanian film is, as noted by its promotional materials, the latest to come from an emerging cinematic movement in the country that has already brought us 4 Months, 3 Weeks, and 2 Days and The Death of Mr. Lazarescu. While Tuesday doesn't quite measure up to those two, the film, about a family dealing with the repercussions of the husband's infidelity, is nevertheless a subtly and superbly acted, with help from a smart script. Tuesday, After Christmas may not blow your mind, but it's a solid domestic drama for those looking to brood a little this holiday season.",1325116800,3,682,4.939130434782609
