6486709,3,B00LH6MKAY,"The video uses interviews and TV footage to demonstrate how some pastors are only interested in the money they can make from their church. The director has reduced the quality of some of the footage to make it clear that he is quoting pastors by using the pastors' own video footage against them. The director's own footage is in High Def.
I think the thrust of this movie is spot on and the real strength lies in the interviews especially when contrasted with the various pastors' own footage.
The weakness is that it needed more polishing. Because of the way the directer splices the interviews with the footage, the points being made aren't clearly delineated. One comment here thought this movie was bootlegged rather than the director editorializing, as a result. For people accustomed to hard hitting documentaries like Frontline, this could have been made even better. So if you want a documentary without the sensationalization but rather sticks to the information, its pretty good",1406073600,31,989,5.0

It is well done and thought provoking. I highly recommend it for anyone attending, or contemplating attending, a mega church.

6486724,1,B00LH6MKAY,"This commentary seems like it was produced by people with an axe to grind with pastors versus the church and a way to make money.  Other viewers are correct in that most of the visual content seem to be copied from prior TV documentaries or dvds..  I wanted to be objective so I decided to watch the video myself.  I wonder if the producers of this video received permission from the various news outlets, the churches and congregation for their portrayals. Were those entities compensated?  Just like everything else in society, there may be a few pastors that do not operate ethically however, that is not the norm.  Many of the men and women that serve in the ministry do it because they love God; love the people and want to help change lives through the gospel..

  Mega Churches are often criticized about what they should or should not be doing for the community. Many churches have done a lot for the
community.  In addition to regular Sunday morning worship and weekly Bible study, Many mega churches operate like mini-social service department.  They provide food, shelter, transportation, free income tax preparation, after school programs for children, tutoring, scholarship's and college tuition, counseling services, free legal and housing assistance, clothing, hospital visitation, perform wedding and burials, etc.  Regular church attendees know this.  The government needs to look into members of  congregations that receive tax free monetary and tangible resources from the church.  In most mega churches, the ministry is supported financially, and physically by a few faithful members, People attend church for all sorts of reasons and often do not support the church financially yet they often call the church for assistance.  Giving should go both ways.  To be fair there are many White mega churches with budgets much larger than Black churches they provide services for the community too.

 What is the church? The church is a gathering of believers to hear the word of God and administer the sacraments.  The purpose of the church is to evangelize, edify, nurture and worship God.  Nothing else.  The message of the gospel is what changes lives and motivate people to do better.

Save your money I wanted to give this video the benefit of the doubt but like other writers this was a waste of money.  The producers should come back when they thoroughly researched their clams and evidence to support their claims.",1437868800,2,2436,5.019950124688279

6486745,4,B00LH6MKAY,"This documentary sheds light on the darker side of the black church. Although the black church is featured, it is a microcosm of a cancer that needs to be addressed in the church as a whole, regardless of color - and that is greed and avarice. It is what happens when ministers start acting as if they are the story, as opposed to the story of the gospel. The documentary reveals the story of preachers who have blurred the line between letting their lights shine, as Scripture says, and being in the spotlight. Once you believe you are the marquee attraction, it is only a matter of time that one believes he or she is worthy of marquee treatment. I don't fault pastors for being wealthy, as long as it isn't off the backs of the tithes and offerings of poor parishioners. But as a pastor, I told my family that if I ever become so arrogant and self-absorbed that I have to be driven to church in a Bentley, surrounded by security which keeps the people at a distance, please do an intervention. Drive the Bentley into a creek and cut up the $1,500 suits (I preach in Banana Republic khakis, by the way) until I understand that I am a servant - of the Lord, and to the sheep he has entrusted to me.

But it did lead me to do some research regarding their subject matter. However, please be warned that not ALL ""mega-churches"", pastor, bishops, and church leaders behave in that manner.

It asks questions that too many folks, especially those who are members of large congregations, avoid answering.  I have no problem with people who choose to give their money to a preacher who lives the high life - that's their choice.  But I do have a problem with preachers who are pimping the Word of the Lord for their financial gain when they're supposed to be sharing the gospel to save souls and get people on the road to doing what thus says the Lord, i.e. helping the poor, taking care of children, being kind to one another and spreading the good news.  Very little of that is reflected in these mega congregations that exist in their own sphere, where entertainment is lauded instead of the Almighty.

We are all stewards of our gifts.  Lest we forget the parable of the talents...hiding our treasure and not causing it to be profitable is a sin...in fact it caused the ire of Jesus.
