I was having my Chinese cold noodle delivery order at home after getting off from work in a fairly hot Seattle summer day while roaming online searching for something interesting to watch.
Carl Jung popped into my mind since I have been reading the dreams, memories and reflections recently. And this led me to this wonderful lecture,
Would like more of the series of this lecture. anybody know the name of the speaker in this video?",1532476800,,470,4.814814814814815
8742165,5,B018ELUEGG,"Once I began watching this I thought it would be really boring. But the speaker ended up explaining everything in a very concise way, and he seemed to just really have a love for the subject matter. I learned a lot.",1513555200,,215,4.2682926829268295
8742166,4,B018ELUEGG,"This is a superb explanation of Jungian psychology, but the presenter, I can't remember his name at the moment, was mistaken about Jung's take on the black wings and serpents in the alchemy depictions.  In fact, the science of chemistry did take paths for evil purposes, and the alchemists were aware of that, just like the Egyptians were fully aware of it, when they first developed this science.  If you read Gary Wayne's ""The Genesis 6 Conspiracy"", he explains the whole history in great detail.  He faithfully cites his sources and details his reasoning behind his conclusions.

This presenter is also unaware of the true history of the European conflicts of the first half of the 1900s, and their origins, but no one can know everything, which is why I chose to watch this documentary - to learn more about alchemy, and my knowledge and understanding of Jungian psychology was enhanced as a bonus.

I highly recommend this documentary to all those interested in a deeper knowledge of our world and our universe.",1492473600,2,1016,4.8497109826589595
8742167,5,B018ELUEGG,"Actually, I thought this was excellent.  A welcome alternative to the mystical entertainment angle that defines most documentaries on this subject.  If there is one thing true about alchemy, it is that it is tantalizing, and yet its secrets seem to remain always out-of-reach.  In this lecture, Carl Gustav Jung's take on alchemy is discussed, wherein the symbolism depicted in alchemical emblems refer to specific psychological processes, states, or changes.

Whether or not these emblems actually reflect any sort of conscious attempt on behalf of medieval and renaissance alchemists to depict psychological states or mechanisms, or merely ""leaked out"" of their consciousness as depictions of laboratory processes (exposing almost by accident their psychological maps) remains unclear.

All I know is this artwork (and in some cases, music - see Atalanta Fugiens) fascinates on a deep level nothing else does.  Something is going on here, and whether or not one agrees with Jung's assessment, his analysis is one of the more honest and ambitious ones you'll encounter.

This video is a lecture; there's no dramatic music or special effects, but the lecture is not dry nor excessively didactic.  Rather, it raises compelling questions about human psychology - that is, the psychology of you and I - and whether or not the transmutation of such to something more whole and integrated is possible, using very old, and possibly universal processes.

Enjoyed this a lot.  Deeply unpretentious and never goofy, which are two things you'll find a lot when you're reading about alchemy.  It is an excellent starting point for interpreting alchemical imagery not as, perhaps, it was initially intended exoterically in the context of the time it was written, but through the lens of the long now of the human condition, in which the transformative needs and processes of men and women hundreds and in some cases thousands of years ago, were not different from our needs today.",1485993600,8,1968,5.19620253164557
8742168,1,B018ELUEGG,"I had no idea I was getting a less than ""youtube"" lecture.  I actually thought I was buying a documentary.",1485129600,2,106,4.3
8742169,5,B018ELUEGG,Fascinating.  The speaker was able to explain the difficult concepts that Jung introduced with clarity.,1483056000,,103,5.866666666666666
