5190906,1,B008YGGUTW,"""Why in the world are they spraying"" is the sequel to ""What in the world are they spraying"". Both movies are distributed by Reality Zone, a group with connections to the John Birch Society. The message of the movie is really a subtle form of climate change denial. The movie admits that climate change is man-made, but claims that it's caused by secret government geo-engineering, rather than by fossil fuels. In this manner, the Birchers can both eat their cake and have it, too. Sure, the weather is changing, but it's the New World Order that's to blame, not our heavy dependence on oil and coal. Ah, how convenient! To stop climate change, we just have to expose the geo-engineering conspiracy, and that's that.

I'm not saying everyone in this production agrees with the above perspective (many seem to be organic farmers and one is a Latin American immigrant, hardly people connected to the John Birch Society), but this seems to be the secret agenda of G. Edward Griffin over at Reality Zone.

The documentary itself is a very mixed bag. I don't doubt that the U.S. government (and other great powers) want to control the weather. Nor do I doubt that Monsanto aren't girl scouts, or that pollution is on the rise. The problem is the way the film connects these various strands with each other. Note also the irony that the geo-engineering proposed by the scientists as a way to stop climate change, is being charged with *creating* climate change...in secret.

But then, that's why it's called ""conspiracy theory"", isn't it?",1350000000,7,1531,4.813688212927756

5190910,5,B008YGGUTW,"This underrated sequel to ""What in the World Are They Spraying?"" provides us with motives for a global weather modification project.

Firstly, ""Why in the World Are They Spraying?"" goes over the available evidence suggesting ongoing, ultra-massive spraying operations.  Then, the evidence for the meta-motive of a global weather modification project is examined.  Murphy's interviewees provide us with fascinating information as to exactly how these programs are executed.  The movie then goes into how weather modification can benefit specific groups.

If you are a military general, you want to be able to control the weather for the purpose of battlefield supremacy.  Controlling the weather can enable one to make a killing in certain financial markets such as the weather derivatives or catastrophe reinsurance markets.  It appears coincidental that Enron started the weather derivatives market.  Agricultural commodities are directly affected by the weather.  Energy company revenues are heavily dependent upon weather.  Water generated by precipitation has been highly coveted for ever.  Annual business activity sensitive to weather is measured in the trillions of dollars.  It goes on and on.

One's knowledge of the chemtrail phenomenon is not complete without watching this movie.",1473552000,,1291,5.696335078534031

5190917,4,B008YGGUTW,"The ideas in this video are intriguing. They give a lot of reasons why it would be profitable to control or manipulate the
weather.
It would be nice if they would have more evidence to support their conjectures.  With all of these airplanes
flying overhead and spraying these substances is it not possible to find someone involved with their dispersion to verify
their content? They look to be rather large jets that must take off from some airport and someone on the ground must
have witnessed something.

Some samples of earth from area's not being seeded or from a time before this supposed geoengineering and compare
those with ground samples that they believe have been altered.  I find conspiracy theories thought provoking, but it would
be really nice to see more science to back up their claims, or is it just not available?",1440288000,,832,4.804195804195804
5190918,5,B008YGGUTW,"This is an extremely important video. I live in Portland Oregon which is a prime target for chemical spraying. On most clear days the sky above my home is filled ""chem trails"" which persist for many hours and turn the sky from blue to gray,.This video explains why this is a much greater ""clear and present danger"" than global warming or even nuclear war.. The chemicals  being sprayed may poison our soil and water for centuries. They are probably the cause of the alarming rise in neurological illnesses such as Alzheimer's Disease and Autism.

5190920,1,B008YGGUTW,"Good documentary for a science fiction story.  But the whole thing is about Condensation trails, or vapor trails, in which they think it's chemtrails being sprayed for some other sinister plan.  After about 2 minutes into it, it becomes obvious that it is a video made by conspiracy theorists.  It's about anti-government propaganda, mostly about the USA government, since they don't talk about anywhere else, which this ""spraying"" would be worldwide.  The whole thing is based on a theory about how to cool the planet from global warming.  Maybe someday they may do it, but there's no proof of them doing it today, or anytime in the foreseeable future.  Yet they claim it's being done, and has been done for years.  With no evidence, and a lot of lies... for example, they say that rain should not have any aluminum particles at all, yet rain comes from evaporation from the ground, which is made up of 30% aluminum, and rain has had aluminum particles since it was first recorded back in the 1920's.  They give false reading of soil samples, and many other things that most people don't know about, and they fudge the numbers, or just outright lie about it.  I don't recommend this video to anyone.

Edit; you'll also notice that people who believe in the chemtrail hoax will attack people who know chemtrails are a hoax.  Very similar to when some people don't believe religious peoples' beliefs.  Conspiracy theorists are very similar to doomsday cults (the end is near) as they will either laugh at you in an attempt to make you seem like the idiot, or threaten you, or say things like ""you're going to regret it"", or, ""you're in for a rude awakening"", or the most common; ""you haven't researched enough"" (which is a cop out, because those of us who have heard of the chemtrails hoax usually research it enough to know that it's just a hoax) all in an effort to make you try and see it their way (to bring you into their cult)  because they believe they're trying to ""save the world"" of the evil government.
Contrails can spread and persist all day depending on the temperature and humidity, they can also form on the ground, which you can see videos of planes taking off from antarctica.  They won't research any of that because it contradicts their beliefs.",1408406400,4,2264,4.670025188916877

5190927,1,B008YGGUTW,"I mistakenly watched the movie (for free, thankfully) because I thought it was about the future of geo-engineering (the purposeful manipulation of our climate to counteract unintentional climate change).  However, the movie is a long conspiracy theory about how the government and large corporations have been using aluminum released from jets (chemtrails) to control the weather.  Supposedly, the motivation is huge profits from weather derivative markets and sales of genetically modified crops.  OK, so here is a short list of why I think this is misguided BS:

1. If the government could make so much money from controlling the weather, why do we have a federal deficit?  Why not just manipulate the weather all the way to a balanced budget.  I'm guessing the military would do that to avoid all the cuts they have received lately.

2. If the government and corporations could control the weather, why let hurricanes and tornadoes destroy so much infrastructure that government and corporate money paid to build (and rebuild)?

3. A program of this magnitude would require thousands (at least) of people involved in designing, building, and operating the chemtrail generating system.  In the age of WikiLeaks, that kind of wide-scale secrecy is naive.

4. The science in the movie is terrible.  For example, high aluminum readings in water samples usually indicates natural soil/dust contamination.  So if there is a simple explanation, why select a complicated explanation instead?

The reason I am bothering to write this review is that I would like environmentally-minded people to focus on the many legitimate environmental problems we face instead of wasting time on non-existent ones.",1373328000,4,1694,5.299625468164794

I've been researching it for many years and it is perhaps the most serious issue we're facing and totally can be stopped in a moment if they would just wake up. The details I'm finding from some researchers in the biological fields is far more dyer than we can realize. And yes there is such a thing, just go outside and watch for an afternoon.

5190935,5,B008YGGUTW,"A very useful follow up to ""What ..."".

If you doubt the exitence of chemical spraying, just take a walk and look at the trees.  The white lines in the sky is the input, the damage to the environement (and other things) in the output.

Take a look at the bark on the trees around you.  It is shriveling up and drying out.  The aluminum is choking off the roots and drying out the entire tree.  Small branches come down all the time, larger branches in higher winds and entire trees topple over once the root system has died.

Main stream media keeps it away from the everage person but what concerns me even more is that when you point out the white lines across the sky and explain to them they are not condensation (contrails) but chemicals, they glaze over and walk away.  People do not grasp the enormity of the consequences.",1355097600,19,829,4.372549019607843
5190936,5,B008YGGUTW,"This film is even better than the first one.  It expands on the science of atmospheric geoengineering and clearly shows how the purveyors of weather modification ""experiments"" stand to benefit themselves financially, personally, rather than just with government and corporate grants to carry out this work. I personally have been aware of chemtrails since 2005 but I have clearly seen evidence in movies going back to the 80's.  It is amazing that they could be doing this for so long and so blatantly without my awareness of it.  I spent many hours watching planes and contrails as a child being quite fascinated by them.  I think that part of the reason I never noticed them was because it is often overcast here in the willamette valley oregon and you need to have partially clear skys to see what they are doing up there.  I had seen a sticker that said chemtrails on it earlier but had still not noticed them until I was cresting the cascade mountains coming back from central oregon overlooking Eugene and I saw the biggest nastiest chemtrail one could see.  Coming out of the plane it looked like a normal contrail but as it grew away from the plane instead of dissipating it had what looked like upside down mushroom clouds billowing out of the bottom edge of the contrail.  It looked as if someone was dumping barrels of talcum powder out of the plane rather than simply spraying something.  No matter how hard I tried to ignore it that chemtrail was so obvious I couldn't deny it.  After that I got a video camera  and a tripod and spent hundreds of hours filming them either from central oregon where it is usually clear and you can see them nearly every day or from the valley on clear days.  If you invest a half hour or so watching these planes you will see some that spray the entire horizon, and you will see others that fly with a normal contrail and then spray for only a mile or two, usually at the edge of the cloud they are working on building.  Some will only spray one short little track in the sky as if they are marking the sky in some sort of grid defining some area of a weather pattern or something.  I am really glad that someone has made a film that puts this all together with their own admissions about the programs in a cohesive non-conspiratorial way.  The meteorologist and the stock trader were a nice addition to the film and seeing how the congresspeople act when questioned is so telling I have to recommend this to everyone.  This film is available freely on the internet but I recommend getting a copy and duplicating it and sharing with others.  Well this review is getting windy so thanks for indulging me.",1350691200,31,2649,4.522012578616352

David Hannum

This feature length comedy is 100% fiction.  It is nearly as hysterical as its predecessor ""What it the World Are They Spraying""

Frankly I was disheartened by seeing the emergency fuel jettison clip @1:03:15.  Then again, it's just another example of chemtrail shysters exploiting the anxiety and anguish of others for their own gain--but this is not at all surprising coming from people like Murphy.  At least this video doesn't feature the prototype airliner ballast tank photos (claiming them to be chemtrail tanks in gutted out airliners) which were ubiquitous in other videos of the WITWATS movies era.

The closing clips with the children are just shameless.

This video is not recommended for anyone with a background in natural sciences, commercial aviation, or for those with a modicum of common sense and/or healthy skepticism.

This product (below) is highly recommended for those who believe in the malicious prank known as chemtrails.
