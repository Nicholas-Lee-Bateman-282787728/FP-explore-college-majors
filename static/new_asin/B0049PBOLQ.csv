4292477,5,B0049PBOLQ,"I have several DVDs of Andre Rieu and his orchestra. This DVD is the best so far thanks to great selection of music, wonderful picture work and beautiful setting. The Tuscany became my second favorite because of this. To me, even only the first tune is worth the whole price.",1311811200,3,275,4.52
4292478,5,B0049PBOLQ,"I am an Andre Rieu fan and am very happy to be able to order his dvd's thru Amazon and to get them right away

4292479,5,B0049PBOLQ,"This DVD is about great music, recorded in an outstanding setting, with some unique presentation characteristics. If you understand the back ground of 'Send In The Clowns' the duet that was sung is truly outstanding. Overall, just a great DVD.",1308528000,3,243,5.1

4292482,5,B0049PBOLQ,"Excellent concert.  Photography was stunning.  His trumpet player, Roger, solo piece makes me want to pick up my trumpet after 40 years.  Carmen's solo ""Long Live Forever"" really showcases her tremendous technical and artistic ability.  The harmonizing of Carmen and Mirusia during the performance of the duet ""Bring in the Clowns"" brought tears to my eyes.  My wife and I had the opportunity to meet this two fine young ladies in person - we found them to be very gracious and totally charming - a true credit to there respective homelands of Brazil and Australia.  A definite ""BUY"".",1299283200,24,584,4.908163265306122

4292510,5,B0049PBOLQ,"This German-language musical spectacular features helpful English-language subtitles and is very easy to enjoy.  Andre Rieu and his cheerful musicians are hosted by nobility on a fairy-tale little island in south Germany's Bodensee, or Lake Constance, for a summer evening idyll.  Favorite performers such as the Platin Tenors, Mirousia L., Carmen Monarcha, the Vienna Debutante dancers, and Rieu's Johann Strauss Orchestra give their uplifting best for an appreciative audience assembled in the courtyard of a picturesque grand residence; we see behind the performers a shining blue lake and foothills of Switzerland.  Rieu offers his hallmark flow of rousing marches, merry pranks, soaring beauty, and poignant moments, as for example when he has the audience remember a celebrated soprano, Anneliese Rothenberger, who expected to attend that show but passed away shortly before it was recorded.  Certainly worthwhile and safe family entertainment.",1395014400,,950,5.764285714285714

4292525,4,B0049PBOLQ,"The musical make-up of this DVD is great; however, the quality of the sound leave something to be desired.  In several areas the sound is interpreted by flaws in the DVD.
Otherwise, the DVD is outlstanding.",1362096000,,206,4.722222222222222

4292532,5,B0049PBOLQ,"This is the second Andre' Rieu DVD to be named ""Roses from the South."". Granted, it is one of Johann Strauss, Jr.s greatest waltzes - but naming two Andre' Rieu DVDs after it is more than a bit confusing. This review is of the most recent (2011) one.

I will keep the string going and, like the other six reviewers, give this DVD five stars - mostly for the visuals, although the audio is delightful too.

I love listening to the waltzes of Johann Strauss, Jr. (and also the waltzes of Franz Lehar, Frederic Chopin, Emerich Kalman, Karl Millocker, Robert Stolz, Ralph Benatzky, and Robert Gilbert - all of whom are represented here). There are also a number of non-waltz selections that are very pleasureable.

But it is the visuals that steal this DVD. The sight of young people waltzing among the roses on the lovely ""flower island"" of Mainau in the lake of Constance is breathtaking and spectacularly beautiful. My late wife and I once took a ferry boat across the Lake of Constance (also called the Bodensee.) Unfortunately we missed the island of Mainau, and, at the time, Andre' Rieu had not yet started his orchestra - he was only eighteen years old.

I personally noticed that Andre' has added at least one new member to his repertoire - Kalki Schrijvers - who appears with Mirusia Louwerse and Carmen Monarcha in both ""The White Horse Inn"" and ""Adieu, Little Captain of My heart."" She is a delight to look at and, like all Andre' Rieu performers, seems to be bursting with energy.

I have a number of Andre' Rieu DVDs (and CDs) and my favorite is, still, ""Andre' Rieu, Live at the Schoenbrunn."" But this DVD is now, solidly, in second place.

P.S. Andre' Rieu has becomne a multi-millionaire by playing the waltzes of Johann Strauss, pretty much as they were written, all over the world. Most of these waltzes were written 112 to 160 years ago. Is there any other composer who comes close to this record? Is not Johann Strauss the most popular composer of all time?",1315094400,13,1974,4.60968660968661
