IMPORT-LATIN AMERICA</a>] certainly has ""extreme"" reviews, either by people that really love it or give it about as much value as refuse. The important thing to remember about this film, however, is that (1) it takes place in Santiago de Chile, (2) the characters that are portrayed are of Latin America with their beliefs and values system and (3) therefore can't be confused with an American belief or values system and should never be compared.

On that note,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/La-Mujer-De-Mi-Hermano-NTSC-REGION-1-4-DVD-IMPORT-LATIN-AMERICA/dp/B000KQNCK4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">La Mujer De Mi Hermano [NTSC/REGION 1 & 4 DVD. IMPORT-LATIN AMERICA</a>] based on a novel by Jaime Bayly with additional dialogue written by Maria Eugenia Argomedo is a drama based on the aftermath of the incestuous molestation of an older brother to his younger, killing the younger brother's idolization and turning it into a slowly manifesting cancer.  This fact, although not developed throughout the film, is briefly addressed, however, much like it would be in real-life as it is something people are eternally in denial about and never truly accept.  For even having addressed this issue and taking it to the silver screen I applause Ricardo de Montreuil for a job well done in directing this film.

The slowly manifesting cancer once out of remission makes a reappearance in adulthood, the brothers having separated to pursue their independent futures, and the brothers are drawn back together upon the older brother's failing relationship with his wife as well as the younger brother's Bohemian lifestyle and need for money, wherein the younger brother in an attempt to rid himself of this cancer pursues an affair with his older brother's wife, giving rise to the title of this film.

This foreign film to me was very well planned and reflects upon real life on the big screen and yet is so well directed keeps one hanging in suspense as if it were a mystery film.  The ending is a jewel as it is completely unexpected!

My mouth must have dropped jaw down on several occasions throughout La Mujer de mi Hermano.  The trailers on television that advertised this film gave absolutely no indication as to what this movie was about, other than the intended belief, about an affair between a brother and his brother's wife.  However, since little to no information was given about the film, the issues addressed in the film, or much anything other than the names of the actors, namely Barbara Mori and Christian Meier, I had no idea as to the plot or storyline and not in a million years.

Shockingly scandalous, this foreign film, its excellent cast and direction are a triumph for Latin American cinema and the world.  A must see for all Spanish speakers, lovers of good foreign film, and drama in general.",1187136000,6,3079,5.515923566878981
2567705,2,B000FII31A,"The most tedious and predictable tripe, this film tosses a few ""themes"" around, but does nothing with them. Because it hasn't a brain in its head. Who knows if what the brother says is true, and ultimately, who cares? These are the poster children for the contemporary world, where ""I want"", ""I need"", ""I take"", and it's every man, and woman, and child, for themselves. I'd rather not live among them, talk to them, or watch them. An utterly indifferent film, one that dragged on interminably with lots of soft focus coupling that only served to demonstrate just how little this vapid bore had going for it.",1184544000,3,607,4.682242990654205
2567706,3,B000FII31A,"First off let's say this film was dissapointing. I heard the music ""inspired"" by the film  disc, which some people might mistake for the soundtrack(it is not) and loved the CD but was less than inspired by the movie. Read the editorials and a few reviews to get the jest of the movie,than imagine yourself skipping this one. Really, it was a big diaappointment. I expected something like ""Amorres Perros"" based on the theme and music but instead found myself seeing a dull novela(soap opera). To the films credit,the cinematic visuals are very good,in fact stunning at times, beginning with the opening shot of Christian Meier as Ignacio retrieving a bug from a colorful leaf in the pool. With this opening shot I felt promise but instead later felt duped. The modern residence is beautiful in it's own icy, cold way( a metaphor for Zoe and Ignacio's relationship?)and creates a chill factor visually that never lets you warm up to the movie. Some of the actors and characters seem to be harnessed  from cutting loose, the exceptions are the violent confrontations between the brothers, especially the hostility of Gonzalo as portrayed by Manolo Cardona. Bruno(Zoe's BGF)is believeable but would have been more fun if he were more over the top but instead comes across as just another confidant. The lovely Barbara Mori, who is Zoe, is a visual delight and saves the dullest moments with her attractiveness and wakes you up in anticipation of more glimpses of her.  A little more steamy sex or sexiness might have saved this movie but instead it is a vapid film lacking in substance. Actually the substance is there it is just not utilized enough. The contrast between brothers could have played out more just by contrasting musical tastes and lifestyles. If you liked the music ""inspired"" by the film than stick with the music because the film was not inspirational by any means. By the time Beto Cuevas's ""Mentira"" was playing, as the credits rolled signalling the end of this sordid tale, I felt like taking a shower. After all is said and done it does have a few redeeming qualities, just not enough to make this a keeper; in other words, if you are interested, rent it.",1170979200,5,2174,4.792
2567707,2,B000FII31A,"Some good actors were cast for this, but the film is flat. The dialogue has a very soap opera feel to it, and the makers of this did not succeed in making any of the characters out to be worthy of sympathy in the least bit. They took an idea that had potential and did nothing with it.

I would suggest passing on this as I found it to be dull, shallow, and obvious.",1165708800,2,366,3.945945945945946
2567708,1,B000FII31A,"I love Jaime Bayly and what he does as a writer, but this movie really sucks. The first thing that's wrong with it is the mexican accents and the use of foul language every two seconds. The book doesn't take place in Mexico, or any other place, but I feel they made this movie for a mexican audience, and it wasn't even done in Mexico!! I liked the book, it was really great, but the movie fails to catch the emotions of the characters. The book shows so much of what the characters have inside and the movie fails to get that done.",1165622400,3,532,4.174757281553398
2567709,1,B000FII31A,"The two stars of this glossy-looking movie, based on a novel by bestselling Peruvian author Jaime Bayly, are two popular Latin American soap opera stars.  Suffice to say that the characters they have played in their most popular soaps are more credible, entertaining and nuanced than the ones they play in this movie about the affair between a sexually unsatisfied woman and her artsy brother in law.  The three wealthy lead characters are good-looking, but unsympathetic, so you don't care what happens to them.  And the final resolution is a machista fantasy.  I suggest you skip this and get ""Rubi"", Barbara Mori's most famous soap opera instead.  It's more fun, you get to see more of her, and you'll get more emotionally involved that watching this movie.",1165190400,6,760,4.952755905511811
2567710,4,B000FII31A,"The story is a run of the mill extra-marital affair. Stunningly beautiful Zoe (Barbara Mori) is married to a wealthy businessman and they suffer from a bored marriage. The vulnerable Zoe falls for her husband's younger (playboyish) brother who is an abstract painter/artist and they enter into a short-lived promiscuous relationship. However, very soon Zoe gets pregnant and her promiscuous lover suddenly loses interest and calls for an abortion. Zoe's husband (who has inclinations towards being gay) redeems the ailing relationship by accepting the yet unborn kid as his own.

Nothing special about the movie, except for the stunning presence of Barbara Mori. If you remove her from the movie, then the rating drops to a single star.",1162944000,6,736,5.237288135593221
2567711,4,B000FII31A,"Unlike the website's review, I really enjoyed these characters making the best of an imperfect situation.  When lies get baked in the cake, inextricable because they occurred in the past and there's no atonement for them, or because social convention prohibits it, then sometimes a second-best solution is the best one available.  I thought the storyline believable and entertaining.

I just have two small criticisms.  First, I wanted more nudity.  In the movie, at one point Ignacio calls Zoe ""a goddess"" and she in fact looks like one.  My prurient and adolescent mind wanted more of the goddess.  However, I suppose one must take that criticism with a grain of salt, since it demonstrates more a defect with me than with the movie.

The second critique I have is that of style.  The modernist sets (particularly the wonderful Frank Lloyd Wright-esque house) clashed with the feel of the movie, which is intimate and familial.  I guess the set director wanted to say something about sterility and money not buying happiness, but instead it just looked jarring.  It's frankly also very unrealistic.",1160006400,4,1100,5.0220994475138125
2567712,5,B000FII31A,"La Mujer de Mi Hermano has to be one of the best movies of the year. It should have won an Oscar. The story line is excellent, the acting is excellent, it has twists that you wouldn't imagine. I recommend this movie to everyone.",1155427200,5,228,4.204545454545454
2567713,3,B000FII31A,"Barely a step above a Soap Opera, ""La Mujer de Mi Hermano"" lacks the weight and sincerity to support its heavy duty themes of child molestation and latent homosexuality. Bewilderingly, these major themes are raised by the characters and just as bewilderingly dropped: neither explained nor resolved.
Though the film itself is quite beautifully photographed, it nonetheless is oftentimes vapid and silly and lacking in intelligent, sincere and psychologically cogent motivation.
Zoe' (a gorgeous Barbara Mori) and Ignacio (a sturdy and icy Christian Meier) are married and unhappy: Ignacio is physically beautiful but cold and Zoe' is both physically beautiful, psychologically aware and in possession of a warm, inviting personality....a situation fraught with difficulties
Ignacio's brother Gonzalo (Manolo Cardona looking like nothing if not a throwback to the 70's with his anglo-afro and full beard), though warm and puppy-like on the outside is even more of a viper than his brother: his relationships with women border on the cruel and certainly lack any kind of commitment on Gonzalo's part.
Combine Ignacio, Gonzalo and Zoe' together and you have one hell of a spicy stew. Unfortunately Director Ricardo de Montreuil, is not the cook to stir this pot in the right direction. His mise en scene is icy-cold, filled with hard surfaces like the concrete and glass of Ignacio and Zoe's house: could anything approximating Love exist in these surroundings?",1147392000,39,1458,5.37117903930131

2567743,1,B000FII31A,"I should have stuck with the bad reviews for this movie.  It was a silly Mexican type of novella in big screen.  A woman who was in heat and a husband in the closet.  Uses the brother in law for sex,  Ridiculous story that didn't pick up as it went.  Everyone's acting was like if they themselves were bored or tired.  Aweful and boring.",1366675200,,337,4.1875

2567745,2,B000FII31A,"The producers of LA MUJER DE MI HERMANO must have been thinking about cashing in big after Barbara Mori's success in the novela RUBI, but this film is a miss.  She and her costars are wasted in this empty drama about a frustrated wife who commits adultery with her brother-in-law and the additional deceptions .  involved with it.  Outside of the three costars there is inadequate character development topped by a highly unrealistic ending.  One wonders if she chose to survive by going into the same level of denial as her mother-in-law.

The cinematography is good, emphasizing the irony of the glass house with the opaqueness of the deceptions (including those of the self- kind) of the inhabitants and their family.  This design was excellent, emphasizing the coldness of a relationship that is all smoke and mirrors to outsiders.  Interestingly, the viewer also gets a sense of claustrophobia about this house despite its walls of glass within a natural setting and wonders how anyone could live in it.

In short, if you are a student of cinematography or set and production design, this is worth seeing.  If you're a writer, don't bother.",1279324800,2,1145,4.921875

2567750,3,B000FII31A,"Watching this last year, I was amazed at the lush cinematography and excellent attention to detail (never since Spains' Pedro Almodovar have I seen a director with such a crisp, clear eye for color and angles). But that is the extent of the brilliance on display in this tedious film, one that will appeal to a broad section of the audience (due to its' inherent themes of infidelity, repressed sexuality, and an absolutely stunning female lead), but it is at the end a sad view of marriage and present-day life, with some of the dialog bordering on downright tacky.

The story essentially follows our female lead as she finds herself in a platonic marriage with a man who bats for the other team. Of course, she seems to waste no time in shacking up with his brother, and the rest of the film is a tiring sequence of heightened emotions, keeping secrets, deal-making (""Promise me you'll never see him again!!"", etc), culminating in a 'satisfactory' end for all three main characters. Was it worth it? No. Is it beautifully shot? Yes.

I suppose you could do worse. Spanish cinema is pretty much hit or miss. When they do it right, it is absolutely breathtaking. Need I even mention ""Pan's Labyrinth""? But when they get it wrong, it turns out like this. However, I do believe there will be a huge audience for this type of cinema. Its just that I am not one of them.",1241049600,,1366,4.571428571428571
2567751,3,B000FII31A,"This is one of the best Latin American movies I have seen. Yes, it is a bit too telenovela-like; but, it is good. Barbara Mori plays a woman in a miserable marriage. Her husband is emotionally distant, never really wants to have sex with her and is hiding a secret. She looks for a bit of love and fun in her husband's brother, who only wants to have fun and live the irresponsible, no-strings-attached lifestyle. Add to all of this all the cultural and morality issues present in Latin American society and you have a great exploration of a society that although progressing in economy, culturally, technologically, still has to deal with the deep-rooted and long-held moral beliefs.

The movie has all the emotional and dramatic whirlwind of a telenovela but will all the good acting these fine actors have to offer. What comes out is a very engaging and interesting film and is definitely worth watching.",1211932800,,907,4.777070063694268
2567752,5,B000FII31A,"This is a brilliant production about family dynamics and the intertwining connections between them. Written with almost ""Shakespearian Complexity"": the actors were expertly subtle in their roles so as to present this wonderful story to you like the separate courses of a grand feast. You are held in deep interest and concern for all the characters and their roles.

(The secret of good writing is to actually make you care about the characters written!)

You are left with a profound feeling of empathy and validation for all the characters in this all too relevant film of modern relationships. I highly recommend this film to anyone interested in high order theater.

There is a great difference between ""Movies"" and ""Film""! Movies are made as mindless schlock whose sole purpose is to numb your senses and take your money.

Film is art in its truest sense! Film uses people as the colors on a pallet or notes in a chord. Film is created, not made! Spanish film production is really coming into it's own and it's ability to rival the films of other major film producers.

Trust me on this; you can't go wrong with this one!",1201392000,4,1126,4.753846153846154
2567753,4,B000FII31A,"LA MUJER DE MI HERMANO seems to have polarized viewers between those who classify it as a television novela and those who see it as a stylish Latin American drama. Written by Peruvian author Jaime Bayly, adapted by Mar&iacute;a Eugenia Argomedo, and directed by Peruvian director Ricardo de Montreuil, the cast boasts actors from Peru (Christian Meier), Colombia (Manolo Cardona), Uruguay (B&aacute;rbara Mori), Venezuela (Gaby Espino), Chile (Beto Cuevas), and Mexico (Ang&eacute;lica Arag&oacute;n, Bruno Bichir). It is a fine showcase for some of the fine talent from Latin America that is gaining a strong influence on theatrical films released in the USA. It offers a story embracing many current dilemmas in society (relationship to church, infidelity, illegitimate pregnancy, homosexuality, childhood sexual abuse) and blends them into a film acted by a fine cast of beautiful and talented actors and artists behind the camera, and the result is a luminous piece of cinema that deserves a second look.

Ignacio (Meier) is a handsome, wealthy, emotionally cool man who is married to a sensuous, beautiful, sexually frustrated Zoe (Mori), The couple may appear to have it all - splendid house, wealth, expensive tastes - but they have been unable to have children in their ten year marriage. The disparity between their sexual needs results in Zoe finding solace in the arms of Ignacio's bohemian artist brother Gonzalo and they begin an affair that results in a surprise pregnancy. This crisis unveils the truth about the characters: Gonzalo, still reeling from the childhood sexual abuse by his older brother Ignacio, doesn't want fatherhood and marriage, and in the peak of the tremor the pregnancy creates Gonzalo shares Ignacio's homosexuality with Zoe. How the three confront their needs and fears pulls the story to a close, an ending that addresses fully the characteristic traits that have shaped the lives of the three.

In addition to the trio of stars there are excellent cameos by Bruno Bichir as Zoe's gay confidant, Ang&eacute;lica Arag&oacute;n as the mother of the men whose greatest need is for grandchildren, Gaby Espino as the housekeeper Laura, and Beto Cuevas as the priest who is not only a friend of the family but hears the secrets of each in the confessional. The cinematography is lush and evocative in the competent hands of Andr&eacute;s S&aacute;nchez and the tension of the story is well underscored by the music of Angelo Milli. For this viewer LA MUJER DE MI HERMANO is a classy film that brings attention to the many fine new works coming from Latin American cinema. It is well worth revisiting.
