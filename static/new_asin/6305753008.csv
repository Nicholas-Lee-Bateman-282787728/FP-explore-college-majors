7893735,4,6305753008,"As a conclusion to the series, I thought this set was kind of weak, though by itself, I liked it.  The set was a little uneventful.  The episodes kind of dragged out longer than it really needed to.  (An awful lot of the series seems to do that).  On the other hand, the end didn't leave loose threads and what Little Neese does to Naneel is pretty neat.  To put it in a nut shell, if you're a Lodoss fan, you'll probably like it (though not as much as the OVA).",989020800,,462,4.032967032967033
7893736,3,6305753008,"I read somewhere that this version was based more on the ""original"" storyline. I got to say this ending was a good. The conflicts between Parn and Ashram was resolved in a way fitting for these two characters (although I have to say Ashram came out my FAVORITE). It did clear up a bit of confusion as far as Garek was concerned. What a touching scene with him and Rhyniah(oops! I spelled it wrong) Spark finally getting what he wants sooo badly. And the bad guy getting what he deserves..By this stage in the series, you probably gotten over the ""less than stunning"" graphics and cared more about the storyline. I gotta say it was pretty good. Having both the OVA and this series I give props to this one for character development. HOWEVER, the ova was more visually captivating. All in all I liked it and think it worth the money. Especially the"" second parts"", the last one had me rolling..hahah..=)",973123200,,901,4.567901234567901
