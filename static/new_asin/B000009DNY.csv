7905412,1,B000009DNY,"This movie's claim to fame was its director, Norodom Sihanouk, the ruler of Cambodia until Nixon's ill-fated invasion in 1970.  Sihanouk spent his time filing his nails in Phnom Penh, indulging in directing the occasional film, and brokering the occasional Vietnam deal as the only neutral in southeast Asia.  See Angkor and Die is unbelievably sappy, though it does have some nice atmospheric shots of Angkor Wat.  Worth owning for the die hard Vietnam era buff or for somebody who will never see Angkor before dying.",1245974400,,518,5.0
