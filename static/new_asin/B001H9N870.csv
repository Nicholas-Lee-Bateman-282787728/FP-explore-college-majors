3625715,5,B001H9N870,"Season two of 'Flight of the Conchords' was an excellent continuation of the story of Bret and Jemaine.  If you loved the first season you won't be dissapointed.

The writing was fresh and interesting, without straying from the style of deadpan humor that made season one so enjoyable.  I can only hope that a third season is in the works.",1238889600,8,339,4.616666666666666
3625716,5,B001H9N870,"A lot of people preferred Season One of FLIGHT OF THE CONCHORDS to Season Two, but I'm not among them.  With the exception of a couple of episodes, I thought every episode of Season Two was an incredible blast.  I liked a couple of episodes more than anything from Season One.

Although this isn't the reason I liked Season Two so much, this season saw many much higher profile guest stars than Season one.  I've kidded with friends that there is a secret contract somewhere specifying that Alan Dale has to appear on every other show on American TV and he made his appearance here as the Australian ambassador (talking in his native accent).  Kristen Wiig of SNL appeared in a great episode that had Brett and Jemaine pretending to care deeply about animals in order to win her affections.  In one particularly twisted episode Mary Lynn Rajskub (Chloe on 24) plays a woman who uses Jemaine for fulfillment of her sexual fantasies, insisting that he wear a wig to make him look like Art Garfunkle.  And Art himself shows up later in the episode.  In one of my favorite episodes, ""New Zealand Town,"" I have to confess that I didn't instantly recognize Lucy Lawless, even though I'm a passionate fan of BATTLESTAR GALACTICA and saw every episode of XENA.  But Lucy has always been a bit of a chameleon and is superb at transforming herself into unrecognizable personas.  Bruce Campbell in his autobiography IF CHINS COULD KILL tells how she turned up at one of his book signings in disguise and it took a while for him to recognize her.  But for me the most successful guest appearance was not that of an actor, but a director.  Michael Gondry (one of the greatest music video directors of all time in addition to being a great feature film director) directed the absolutely hysterical episode ""Unnatural Love,"" in which Jemaine has an ill-fated romance with an Australian.  Not surprisingly, the episode has some of the best musical sequences of the season.  I should add, however, that the best song of the season, in my opinion, comes early in the season, in the song ""Too Many Dicks on the Dance Floor.""

All in all, I really enjoyed this season.  I do think the music may have been a bit stronger in Season One, but frankly I don't watch FLIGHT OF THE CONCHORDS for the music.  I don't think there is a song on the show that I'd like to hear more than two or three times at the max.  But I love the humor and I enjoy the small but excellent cast of characters.  Finally, let me add that while I love Jemaine and Brett and (in all her insanity) Mel, for me the funniest person on the show is Rhys Darby as Murray.  He managed to steal just about every scene he is in.

From what I've read I take it that it isn't clear that there will be a Season Three.  I hope that there will be.  It does, however, look possible that there will be a FLIGHT OF THE CONCHORDS movie.  Let's keep our fingers crossed for one or the other.",1238025600,13,2922,4.4492481203007515
3625717,3,B001H9N870,"My brother turned me on to the Flight of the Concord's first season. I must have watched the first season more than eight times always laughing at their deadpan humor. I liked their songs so much that I bought their two CD's which has some of their live performances. But I have to say that I was very disappointed with the second season. Their were some good laughs but not like the first season. I'm not abandoning Flight of the Concord, I'm still very eager to see season three with great hope for their comeback.",1238025600,15,516,4.442105263157894
3625718,4,B001H9N870,"Season 1 had me in stitches all the way through w/wacky story lines about two musicians who don't drink & are inexperienced w/ girls and band life in the American rock n roll way of things.
season 2 did not have as many laugh out loud moments for me and the only memorable song was ""sugarlumps"". the others seemed a bit hastily written and not as varied musically as the first season. Other actors get bigger roles and songs w/ mixed results. The opening episode where Murray goes classical was a very curious first song to bludgeon people with. I've watched the second season a few times over and it is okay but not as finely tuned as the first. I also really hope that this seasons DVD edition has bonus features and commentary. The first season is as bare bones as you can get.",1237766400,8,780,4.386206896551724
3625719,5,B001H9N870,"As of last night, it looks like our beloved Jemaine and Bret had their last show. This second season had it's share of brilliance to be sure though compared to the first season, it doesn't quite meet the excellence of the first.  Gems like New Zealandtown, Garfunkeling, the Prime Minister and the guys taking up prostitution as a way of earning money are some of highlights that will keep you in stitches.  It's not that they didn't try hard enough, it's just that after the quality of the first season, there was no where to go but down.  Still, if you are a fan of the first season, you will also love the second season.  It's like sheep; you'll always love your first sheep much more than your second (many of you will know exactly what I'm talking about).  Anyway, Conchords, you have made me laugh many times over.  You were geniuses at what you did (do) and you brought a tremendous amount of laughter to so many of us fans. Thank you and Baaaa.",1237766400,10,952,4.411428571428571

3626000,5,B001H9N870,"[This review is about the show, not Season 2 specifically] It's impossible not to love Jemaine, Bret and their manager Murray, and even the stalker Mel and the clueless, but utterly self-possessed Dave. A hilarious, deadpan show, interspersed with brilliant music videos that pay real respect to the genres from which they are drawn, while being brilliantly produced themselves. And the songs are actually all great songs, instantly hummable and spanning an incredibly wide range of genres, from Prince-styled funk to Beatlesque pop. From hip-hop to opera to metal to the new romantics. They seem to channel everyone from Barry White to Serge Gainsbourg to, in one very bizarre but hilarious sequence with Russian sailors losing body parts (done tastefully), Sergei Eisenstein cross-pollinated with Monty Python. And there is a whole episode dedicated to David Bowie, tracing him from his Ziggy Stardust days up through Scary Monsters. The humor is subtle, and having watched both seasons about three times each, I keep picking up little asides or throw-away comments, or even gestures that I had not previously noticed, but that are hilarious and add to the characterizations. It's a show for which repeated viewing pays off, and for anyone with catholic (not Catholic) tastes in music, it's a kick to try to identify the influences behind the various songs (one easy one is the Black-Eyed peas parody Sugar Lumps). And what I love about the show is the humor never calls attention to itself. It respects the viewer enough to ""get it"". Jemaine and Bret never laugh, in fact, they almost never smile. there is no laugh track. And you can learn just a little bit about New Zealand to boot. It's just a beautiful little show. Ok, I've written enough. Just watch the damn show.",1472774400,9,1774,4.996621621621622

This isn't like anything else I've seen.  After seeing the movie What We Do In the Shadows, I had to see more of Jermaine Clement and stumbled on Flight of the Conchords.  Here, on Amazon Prime.  For free!!!!!!  Worth my entire Prime membership!  I only came to admire Jermaine Clement more.  I think he's brilliant; his facial expressions, timing, delivery, all perfect.  Then, I loved Murray more and more with every episode.  There's something sweet about the way Murray never lets complete failure in everything get him down for too long.

These guys are funny, the music is silly and very clever and the premise of the show is great. (Think Tenacious D, only less swearing and way funnier.) Rhys Darby plays their band manager is hilarious too. Some might recognize Bret McKenzie as an elf from Lord of the Rings. He also wrote the music for the last two Muppet movies.

I no longer had HBO when season two aired and couldn't wait for it to be released on Dvd, but one thing and then another kept me from buying it until now.

While season one of the flight of the conchords HBO television series had a great story and the songs were both catchy and hilarious the same cannot be said about season two! Season twos story is very hit and miss youll have to sit through one subpar scene after another before youll reach a laugh worthy moment. As for season twos songs like season one the songs were done in a variety of music styles and performed well the problem is that most of them were not catchy or very funny.

3627417,5,B001H9N870,"They're still from New Zealand, still in New York, still broke, and still outrageously funny.

Not a lot has changed in the second season of ""Flight of the Conchords,"" which is just fine because the brilliant writing and hilarious songs are only getting better. Sadly this was also the last season of the show (Bret McKenzie and Jemaine Clement wanted to move on), but it sure makes you wish that the Kiwi band's fun could go on forever.

Bret and Jemaine fire Murray (Rhys Darby) because he's spending all his time on the Crazy Dogggz, and instead land a gig on a commercial for women's toothpaste. But then a lawsuit is leveled at the Crazy Dogggz and Murray finds himself broker than ever, while the Conchords find that they may be in trouble with immigration.

When the status quo is restored, Bret and Jemaine have a whole new host of problems: romance with an Aussie, forming a street gang, attempting to top the ""Friendship Graph,"" falling in love with the same girl and trying to win her over with epileptic dog benefits, Garfunkeling, an addiction to hair gel, attempting to get Bret a girlfriend, and resorting to prostitution to pay for a new cup.

And Murray's job becomes more complicated when the Prime Minister of New Zealand comes to New York, wanting to meet President Obama and open ""New Zealandtown."" And finally, Murray comes up with the ultimate plan for Bret and Jemaine's musical career...

Finishing ""Flight of the Conchords: The Complete Second Season"" is a bittersweet experience, because it's one of those rare TV shows that ended when it was at its quality peak instead of dragging it out for dozens of seasons... and frankly, it leaves you longing for more like Bret longs for his own cup. Maybe if we're lucky, someday we'll get a ""Flight of the Conchords"" movie.

The hilarity of the first season is a little more finely-tuned here, but mostly it derives humor from the same sources -- mostly from the flaky, mellow approach of the New Zealanders and their attempts to find love and musical success. The dialogue is tight and funny (""Are you a prostitute?"" ""No, I'm the guy who wears the giant condom""), and it maintains that deliciously wacky surreality that the best musicals have (there's an entire sequence inside MEL'S DAYDREAMS).

And unsurprisingly, the music is FRIGGIN' HILARIOUS. It covers everything from opera to dance to hip-hop -- just consider ""Sugalumps,"" a parody of the Black Eyed Peas' ""My Humps"" that succeeds in being a thousand times better. Jemaine and Bret sexily prance around a restaurant, singing about how irresistible their ""sugalumps"" are.

And the songs tackle subjects like cannibalism, epileptic dogs, being ""freaky"" (pillow wings!), sensitive rappers, angel sex and prostitution (""You don't have to be a prostitute/You can say no to being a man-ho/a male gigolo!""). Each one is tightly-written, with lots of in-jokes and clever phrases. And the music videos are unbelievable -- one has ninjas, fencing AND a two-man novelty band.

Bret McKenzie and Jemaine Clement are absolutely perfect playing... well, more comedic versions of themselves. Jemaine is a slightly brasher, sensible sort, while Bret is a sensitive dreamer who can't talk to girls he likes. Darby and Kristen Schaal round out the cast nicely, as their naive manager and their one and only deranged fan.

""Flight of the Conchords: The Complete Second Season"" leaves you rather sad as you leave Jemaine and Bret, but the journey is definitely worth taking -- wickedly funny, cute and gloriously well-written.",1391990400,,3536,4.95777027027027

3627421,4,B001H9N870,"I'm a big Flight of the Conchords fan. I have seen lots of their music on YouTube, and seen them live, and watched the first season a couple of times through at least. Although I enjoyed it all, I thought the second half of the first season was not as strong as the first six episodes, and I had heard that they had trouble writing a second season and an entirely new set of songs, so I would have forgiven them if this season wasn't very good.

Fortunately, it is great, for the most part. I think the first six episodes of the second season are just as good as anything they've done, with spectacular songs and hilariously surreal comedic scenes. ""Do you know any actual women, Dave?"" ""Yeah, pretty much.""

The last handful of episodes are a bit slower and get a bit awkward, but still have some good moments. At any rate, it's worth getting this just for episode 5 (Unnatural Love, where Jemaine dates an Australian, with the songs ""Too Many Dicks on the Dance Floor"" and ""Carol Brown"") and episode 6 (Love is a Weapon of Choice, where Jemaine and Bret both want to date Kristen Wiig, with the songs ""We're Both in Love with a Sexy Lady"" and ""Think About the Epileptic Dogs"") and watching those two over and over again.",1382313600,,1222,4.402654867256637

3627458,5,B001H9N870,"""Flight of the Conchords"" picks up right where they left off in series 1 - Bret and Jemaine are still penniless musicians playing gigs to single figure audiences. If it ain't broke, right?

The episodes are still completely charming but you can see a rise in production values immediately with the brilliant Murray (played superbly by Rhys Darby) bursting into song within the first 5 mins of the first episode while walking across a massive top floor office and the camera floating off into space as his operatic voice hurtles across the sky. The fantasy sequences are also improved upon with top quality effects making them look like more polished music videos.

The characters of Bret and Jemaine - innocent, somewhat gormless, kind of stupid, always hopeless - are still the same as the first series but the episodes have gotten sharper and funnier. There's an entire episode based around Bret buying a mug for $2.95 (they only have one mug and have a timetable over when they get to use it) and the brilliant visit of the New Zealand Prime Minister (""What's the state of the environment? Aw, that's terrible! Can't you send your cousins round to... y'know clean it up a bit?"").

Also Rhys Darby should be singled out as by far the funniest guy in this series. He steals every scene he's in with his bizarre manager who's similar to Bret and Jemaine's characters but has a dash of David Brent added in. He's that strange mix of cunning and stupid, with a lot of delusion and killer lines. This series is worth watching just for his character alone.

It ends (2 series, such a shame, I could've watched another 2 series) so well with the guys making an off-broadway production of their lives in America.

Such a funny series, probably the best sitcom since Gervais/Merchant's The Office and a definite must for fans of comedy. The music's not bad either.",1315180800,,1857,4.719135802469136

Perhaps the disappointment of the entire season can be summed up in the episode Friends, the fourth one.  The show has Murray looking for the band to make better friends, and Murray insists on starting with Murray's friend (played obnoxiously by comedian Jim Gaffigan).  They have band meetings where Murray measures their friendship ""progress"", and as the episodes plays out, you cringe because it makes no sense why Murray would measure friendship on graphs and have meetings about it.  You also wonder why Murray is friends with Gaffigan's character in the first place.  The whole thing is really silly and pointless, and many of the other episodes feel the same way.  It's like they were trying to be really ""out there"", and ended up being silly and obnoxious.  The songs don't feel fresh like they used to, and seemed obsessed with over production.  The best song, ironically enough, comes from the above mentioned Friends episode.  It's a simple, almost a-capella song, and it's so charming, straightforward, and perfectly written that it makes the episode worth watching (even though you can fast forward/skip to the song on the DVD).  But, alas, one song can't save the entire season, and sadly, the 2nd season of Flight of the Conchords is a disappointment.",1261958400,,1649,4.870967741935484
3627479,3,B001H9N870,"I thought Season 1 of ""Flight of the Conchords"" was flawless: the ludicrarious (that's ludicrous and hilarious) lyrics set to eclectic musical styles and staged mid-action as video extrapolations of emotional moments or pivotal plot points were a very different type of humor than American sitcom consumers are used to. How else could a running joke about taking attendance at a meeting with three people remain funny over the course of a season's episodes?

Season 2 seemed to continue at a different pace. Instead of the two Conchords being the only singers, other characters break into song in a way that somehow shattered the reality of the action in a way that Season 1 episodes didn't. I'm halfway through, so maybe I should reserve my final review for the end, but I came into Season 2 with such high expectations, and so far, they haven't been met. Many of the songs still live up to the expectations of the first season, and I think Bret's and Jemaine's rapping are still among of the funniest rap posturings I've seen on television.

Murray was hilarious as usual, but it seemed like all of the season 1 episodes were created around songs that had already been written...and the songs were clearly hilarious.

I snickered a lot, but a snicker is only a half-assed laugh reserved for shows that are clever, but aren't really funny.

With that said, I think 2.0 is pretty darn funny. It has many hits and a few misses, but overall, its funny as heck. So, watch and laugh and don't worry about comparing it to 1.0. just enjoy it for what its worth, great comedy, skits and songs from a couple of zany, hilarious New Zealanders.

3627503,4,B001H9N870,"I loved Season 1 of this offbeat, sharp, and charming show. The reviewers here who disparage the second season mystify me. This was mostly fine stuff. Season 2 offers some higher highs and some lower lows than Season 1, thereby creating a package that is about as good, but this set has two episodes far beyond anything done in the first season. Love Is the Weapon of Choice and Prime Minister can stand against any TV comedy anywhere. Other episodes, especially the first, were as good as any from Season 1. But these two especially were biting, frightfully clever, well plotted, and full of surprises. They are the most entertaining video I've seen in a long time. The Japanese karaoke was brilliant. I watched it twice in two days and, if anything, it was funnier the second day.

Unfortunately, these two sparkling gems are followed by two undistinguished rocks that probably looked funny during the creation, but failed badly to amuse and sink like, well, stones. Predictable, tedious, and ugly, they overstayed their welcome long before their completely expected conclusions. (And having a guest star adds nothing if the tale stinks.) When making a story about lovable losers, the characters cannot be too lovable, nor can they be too pitiful. There is a delicate balance when the foolishness is just enough to be plausible but not too much to make us groan. These episodes crossed that line repeatedly.

Four hours of glorious quality in five hours of material is a good deal. The deleted scenes were hilarious...good enough to stand on their own! Snap it up and enjoy!",1250812800,5,1576,4.876865671641791

I can think of other performance artists who do leading edge work which is visually experimental.  I cannot think of any other duo, either currently or in the past, who can do all three and do them all well.  The only act this even sort of reminds of is Martin & Lewis because Dean Martin could sing and their comedy was pretty good for its day.  I wouldn't go so far as to call Martin & Lewis's work performance art though.  Other than Martin & Lewis, I can't think of anyone else like these guys at all.

Why are viewers here debating season 1 versus season 2?  This is not remotely like anything else out there and it is so innovative that I can scarcely believe that it survived for a second season.  If it had been on anything but HBO I think it would have been too leading edge and been cancelled after the first season.  I'm not comparing the two; I am in grovel mode that there were two seasons!

Ok, here is the premise.  There are two musicians from New Zealand who come to New York City (of all places) to break into the entertainment world as musicians.  Their manager works for the New Zealand Commission in New York City and that job is such a no brainer that he basically can do whatever he wants with his time.  The band has exactly one fan, a woman.  The only reason she is a fan is that she has the hots for Bret.  The guys are poor as can be.  They live together in a subsistence lifestyle.  And they are complete nerds on top of everything else.  At first I liked Bret best because (being a woman), I found him cuter.  But Jemaine has grown on me and I've gotten past his awful glasses and sideburns ('70s style sideburns).  Their manager I find positively uproarious.  Even the fan has her moments.  Very often the guys deliver their lines in complete deadpan, which makes it even funnier.  Oh, and they are more often than not a disaster with women.  They have dates on the show and these dates rival anything we saw on SEINFELD or FRASIER (which heretofore covered dating hell rather definitively).

The best part of all is when the guys break out into song and movement, usually in an outrageous MTV kind of music video style, to comment on the latest bizarre aspect of their lives.  Those performances are worth playing again and again.

I do listen to the songs on my ipod and I enjoy their music.  I am not alone as their music has been voted on favorably in the NPR yearly music polls.  Bob Bollein of NPR's ALL SONGS CONSIDERED was very taken with their musical numbers without knowing a thing about their tv show. So their music is an important component of the show for me.

Funny as Bret and Jemaine are, Rhys Darby as Murray their manager deserves a special mention. He just slays me and I love every minute he is onscreen.  I adore his band meetings, especially when he takes attendance and there is NEVER anyone but the three of them in the room.

I don't remember that happening when I watched the first season.  Possibly that is because I know the characters better and feel more comfortable with them.  For example, I had to watch several episodes of the first season before I caught on to the fact that they were supposed to be in New York, that they weren't gay, etc.
