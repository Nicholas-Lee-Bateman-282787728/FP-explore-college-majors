8454462,5,B0052U8I2A,"This show is badass. Great story, good voice acting, and plenty of action. Although it is absolutely NOT for straight girls and not for squeemish guys who can't handle in your face nudity/bouncing boobs. Anyway, I think I've got all the DVDs so far. It's been awesome!! I look forward to the next episode every time i finish one. Love this series!!",1438732800,,348,4.629032258064516

8454465,4,B0052U8I2A,"Amazingly enough, Queens Blade has more fan service than Ikki Tousen and Agent Aika combined, and those two are bursting with fan service - if you know what I mean! This one has better animation, but Aika is an older series, so i'm not faulting either series, but the dialogue in Queens Blade is just horrendous. Lena, the main character sounds like a middle schooler reading a report in class most of the time, while her younger sister just needs to be put in a freezer to cool herself off. We'll see how season 2 looks, but this one gets an average of 4, 5 for the animation & fan service, coupled with 2 for the dialouge.",1327536000,2,624,4.3418803418803416
8454466,5,B0052U8I2A,"An easy 4 and 1/2 to 5 stars. This is not your kid's anime. It is about and for adults. It is a well-written story used as an excuse for many busty women to run around swinging sharp objects and each other,frequently cutting the clothes off their opponets. The characters are reasonably well drawn and the story's pace is kept up throughout the series. The average viewer is unlikely to much ponder the phylosophical meaning of this series nor is he likely to try to apply any lessons to his real life;this is a likeable and enjoyable skin show that is reasonably clever and neither obscene nor gross. There is a well-drawn demon named Mellona that squirts clothes-eating acid from her breasts,a female arms maker with triple-double-god-awful big boobs and a small boy, an elf that wears no drawers,a really strange reigning queen,an angel with one wing much larger than the other and a whole host of other characters. Endless breasts,fan service and a reasonable story-line to boot. If that is what you are looking for,you have come to the right series. While this is not for minors,there are no sexual situations in the series except once or twice the demon female that uses a snake as a G-string gets ""fresh"" and the youngest sister really needs to be hosed down,there is nothing demented about it,it is just a little too nasty.",1307145600,7,1331,4.741379310344827
