3630527,4,B001HMFCR6,"This set includes the titles:

THICKER THAN WATER

ORDINARY MIRACLES

THE COLT

FIELDER'S CHOICE

A CHRISTMAS VISITOR

ANGEL IN THE FAMILY

I was not familiar with any of these movies when I purchased this set but I enjoy most Hallmark movies and the price was very reasonable. You can't rent them for any less. It turned out they are all pretty good dramatic movies. Most of the family should enjoy them. The Amazon descriptions will give you a good idea of what the movie titles are, and a general overview of the stories. Good quality DVDS with decent replayability. If you enjoyed this catch Hallmark Collector Set V.2 (6-Movies).

3630529,5,B001HMFCR6,All 6 movies live up to the Hallmark excellence. The price was very good for a boxed set.,1233964800,9,89,4.0
3630530,1,B001HMFCR6,"I did a search for the Hallmark movie ""Head of the Class"", and the Collector Set V.1 came up.  Since it did not tell what the 6 movies were, I assumed that ""Head of the Class"" was in it.  When it arrived I discovered the movie I wanted was not included.  I kept it anyway in case I want to watch them someday.  So far I have not opened the package.  If you can help me get the movie I wanted, it would be appreciated.

Rating should be no stars.  Since you will not accept my comments without any I put in one star.",1233100800,11,515,3.894230769230769
