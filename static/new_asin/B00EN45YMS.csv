8606945,4,B00EN45YMS,"It is wonderful to look closely the process of the painting of James Gurney. But I think if the video take more time to concentrate on one demonstration instead of two, we may get more realization over painting technique. Anyway, I like it.",1433030400,,240,4.604651162790698

8606947,5,B00EN45YMS,Here is a rare opportunity to receive a private lesson from one of our century's most talented paleo artists. Jim is a wonderful and warm individulal. I am fortunate to have had a friendship with him in the 90's. His genuine openness and enthusiasm come through on camera and it really is just like you are sitting with him in his studio and learning from the Master. Highly recommended.,1395014400,4,387,4.6231884057971016
8606948,5,B00EN45YMS,"James Gurney does a great job of meticulously walking us through his painting process.  You get to see him planning out sketches, building a maquettes, photographing reference, and painting the finish.  I really appreciate seeing how he corrected certain mistakes.  It is so nice seeing someone take the care in the craft of painting especially in a world where most illustrators work digitally.",1383004800,7,395,5.238095238095238
8606949,5,B00EN45YMS,"James Gurney is a modern-day Meissonier and the techniques he shows in How I Paint Dinosaurs closely follows those of the earlier master. The creation and use of maquettes is clearly presented, as is James' discussion of materials, lighting and color. Whether you are interested in painting dinosaurs or not, there is much to learn from this wonderful DVD.",1381017600,6,356,5.0508474576271185
