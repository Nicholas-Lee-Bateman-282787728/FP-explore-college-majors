2556599,5,B000FA5ETW,"Fantastic series, well researched and top drawer productions.

These six films are an excellent springboard for grades 2-6 kids to introduce a few classical composers.  The films are fictional stories of one child who comes in contact with a composer.  This method makes the movies interesting to kids.  That aspect is fiction, however the historical aspects and settings are factual.

I show these on a yearly basis to my elementary school general music students and highly, highly recommend them to other music teachers.  They're perfect for sub plans when you can't get a music teacher to take your place.  Now all you have to do is find somebody who can operate a DVD player and TV.  Good luck!",1212278400,23,698,4.8559322033898304
8119569,5,B000FA5ETW,I have been watching and using these videos in my music classes for years.  I and my students always enjoy them and they are a great asset to my classroom resources.,1521331200,,165,4.32258064516129

8119571,5,B000FA5ETW,"We had all six of these when my kids were small, and they loved to watch them.  It made an outstanding introduction to classical music.  Now my kids are ages 20-24; three in college and one launched.  I had Beethoven on the player just now, and they asked what it was and began reminiscing about tapes we had in the car and about these videos.  They all still remember the stories, and they remember and enjoy the music.  Definitely very much worth having if you have kids around.  The same people put out some videos about artists, too, which were equally excellent.  I'll make sure to have these in the house when it comes time for grandchildren!",1461628800,,648,4.487179487179487

Thank you",1431561600,,90,4.055555555555555
8119573,5,B000FA5ETW,"Wonderful stories of famous comosers.  These videos, along with the activities in the teacher's guide, keep my students engaged while they learn about ""boring"" composers. Very entertaining, too!",1371686400,2,194,5.928571428571429

8119575,5,B000FA5ETW,I AM A RETIRED ELEMENTARY MUSIC TEACHER~~~THE COMPOSERS COLLECTOR'S SET IS EXCELLANT!  NOT ONLY ENTERTAINING BUT A GOOD WAY TO GET EXPOSURE TO THESE COMPOSERS MUSIC!  I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO ONE AND ALL!,1359504000,,210,4.9714285714285715
8119576,4,B000FA5ETW,"I am an elementary music teacher and purchased these for use in class and with my piano theory classes. We thoroughly enjoyed all but the Bach. I watched it before showing to my students and was so put off by how the whole movie had Bach storming around fussing about his rights and his music. This was totally contrary to everything I've ever read about Bach. So, that one will be saved maybe for older students who won't be irritated by the never ending tirades. The Handel was awesome and my favorite.",1347494400,6,504,4.489130434782608
8119577,5,B000FA5ETW,"These sets are from Canada, and are of the very high quality that one usually finds in British and Canadian children's programming and documentaries.  They are extremely well done.  Each DVD is about one composer, for example, Rossini.  The story of the composer is seen through the eyes of a child who befriends, or who is helped by the composer in some way.  Not only are children exposed to the personality and life of the composer in question, but the entire story contains, like a fairy tale or myth, some life lesson for the child to learn.  All the acting is first rate, what I have come to expect from Canadian children's programming.  I too enjoy wathcing the series, not only for the excellent content but also because they can be viewed in French, Spanish or English.  The original filming is done in English.  What to me is so amazing about all the DVD's in these series (there are also sets of 6 DVD's on famous artists and on great scientists) is that the dubbed in French and Spanish versions are so well acted that one does not feel that those languages are dubbed over the English.  The French and Spanish versions sound as though the set was originally filmed in those tongues.  The stories on the DVD's are filmed both in Canada and in European locales, and seem very authentic.  Canadians certainly have the British knack for getting period pieces right down to the finest details.  I could not recommend these sets more highly.  My kids loved them for the content, and for the opportunity they provided to painlessly brush up in their French and Spanish skills. I would like to see more educational DVD's of this calibre available for children.",1331337600,13,1665,4.660958904109589
8119578,5,B000FA5ETW,I agree with the reviewer that said that these DVD are great for elementary music classes. I have often used them when I need substitute lesson plans. I use them with grade 6. The story lines are fictional but based on the composer's life and times. The stories are thought provoking. It keeps the students attention.,1223078400,12,317,4.678571428571429
