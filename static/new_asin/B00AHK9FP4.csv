8551659,5,B00AHK9FP4,"The Roman Catholic Church is composed of the Western Catholic Church which is the most well known for its liturgical rite commonly known as the Mass. The Eastern Catholic Church, which is also a part of the Roman Catholic Church, celebrates a different liturgical rite known as the Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom who is a Church Father in both the Eastern and Western Church.
This DVD records for posterity a monumental event of the Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom being concelebrated with Pope John Paul II with Hierarchy of the Eastern Catholic Church, the Ukrainian Jurisdiction, in St. Peter's Basilica at the Vatican in Rome.
The significance of this event goes beyond words. When the Church was still one with the Eastern and Oriental Orthodox and the Roman Catholic, Prince Vladimir of Kiev in the 900s sent envoys to Constantinople to the Haghia Sophia and they witnessed the Eastern Church and their celebration of the Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom. The envoys reported back to the Prince that they did not know whether they were in Heaven or on Earth, that they felt the presence of God here in such beauty. This experience brought about the conversion of the Ukraine and Russia into the Eastern Church instead of the Western Church.
In 1054AD a schism took place between the Western and Eastern Church, with the Western Church adopting the name of the Roman Catholic Church. The Eastern Church adopted the name of the Orthodox Church that is split between the Eastern and Oriental Orthodox Churches. This split basically follows the split between the Western and Eastern Roman Empire.
Part of the Eastern Church, which includes the Oriental Orthodox, stayed or returned in communion with the Western Church and most of the Eastern Church remained Orthodox. The ones in communion with Rome are known as the Eastern Catholic Church. The only difference between the Eastern Orthodox and the Eastern Catholic is the very small prayer for the Pope in the Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom.
The Ukrainian Jurisdiction is both in the Eastern Catholic and the Eastern Orthodox Church. This DVD is just simply wonderful to capture this precious moment in time when the Eastern and Western Church are together celebrating the Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom :D in 1965 the mutual excommunications of 1054 were removed and the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern & Oriental Orthodox Churches are on the path for reconciliation, reunification and full communion to become again the One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church as given to us by Our Lord Jesus Christ at the Last Supper and spread to humanity from the time of the Pentecost.
