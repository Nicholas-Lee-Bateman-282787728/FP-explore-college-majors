Vogelsinger carefully builds up and out from foot position at the moment of impact, through full volley kicks on all three surfaces of the foot. It is an excellent tape and has helped me with my teams and children, who all play at the club level.

So what if the video quality is bad: the content is great",1123632000,,425,4.367088607594937
7853331,1,6303692168,"Even if this were the only video of soccer moves I'd say avoid it.  Fortunately, there are better tapes so I'd pass on this whole series unless you can get it at the library and even then prepare to use the fast fwd button a LOT.  This has to be the weakest tape of the 6 tape series since there is no motivation or logic given behind anything shown - just 'do this..like this.."" and there are few if any close-ups of the foot in motion.
Here's a simple hint for anyone whose kicks are too low, bouncing along the grass and losing momentum.  If your supporting foot is slightly behind the ball, the kicking foot will catch the ball on the upward part of its arc and give a little loft to the ball.  I have never seen this explained in any video tape - someone at work pointed it out to me.  All the boys on my U-10 team can now kick nice shots and understand this simple logic.",972259200,9,877,4.105263157894737
7853332,3,6303692168,This tape expalins how to properly kick a soccer ball.  The key here is the control.  There are drills for building the feel for the correct contact with the ball.  The tape is not as good as the dribbling tape but  you need to know how to kick the ball.  I have used the knowledge from this  tape to help teach kicking skills to 12 year old players.,959040000,3,350,4.073529411764706
7853333,5,6303692168,"Excellent graduated series of demos and drills for teaching the proper way to kick the ball with the instep and inside and outside of the foot, for beginners through advanced players.  As a coach, I've sucessfully used  these techniques to teach kids to kick correctly and to unlearn bad habits.",914457600,13,295,4.88
