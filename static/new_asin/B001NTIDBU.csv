8327929,5,B001NTIDBU,"I've bought this Rodolfo's movie because I'm an Italian Rodolfo's fan and I try to make my little piece of Paradise with my best friends like Roscoe Arbuckle,Buster,Charles Chaplin...and obviously... Rodolfo Valentino!!!This's a sweet story,where we can meet the precious-funny-Rodolfo's side!!This Rodolfo's side has not been enhanced during his career as an actor because his life is too short and the dullness thus estabilished film-makers of the time,(not very different from the film-makers of our time to tell the truth...many artists have been wasted!!),but despite everything,as Rodolfo in this film, that time and neglet makes us reach very run-down,he manages to show how he would have been fun and bubbly as sexy and erotic ONLY!!!Part of the film is so screwed up as to prevent to see the actors,especially towards the end,but we can easily follow the epilogue of this innocent,light and funny comedy short. GIU'IL CAPPELLO in the presence of the last romantic ITALIAN,beatiful and warm like the sun of Italy who by sheer force of his EROS has shoked the bigots of the world : teaching as an italian love-knows not ashamed to SUFFER FOR LOVE TO DEATH,(all references to Natasha is purely WANTED!!!).I wish that every human being who wants to be able to feel love as Rodolfo's-way can have this dvd because even if run-down,allows us to smile with Rodolfo!!!Con affetto dall'Italia,malefica.",1354924800,2,1402,5.207964601769912
8327930,5,B001NTIDBU,"Rudolph Valentino, later world famous as the swoon-inducing, alpha hero, The Sheik, here plays an entirely different, comedic character. Mild-mannered Richard Thayer is deeply in love, and very frustrated. He can't seem to get his sweetheart, Beth Lane (Carmel Myers) away from her overprotective father (Wadsworth Harris) and hordes of other admirers long enough to propose to her. He enlists the aid of his friends, William and Maude Harcourt (Charles Dorian and Mary Warren), a lively, young married couple. They agree to invite Beth to dinner at their home, and her father agrees, with the stipulation that they must have her at home by eleven o'clock sharp or he will come and get her.

The night of the dinner, all is going swimmingly until William receives a telegram announcing a surprise visit that very evening from an extremely important prospective client, Bradford (William Dyer). The Harcourts are thrown into a panic. William's finances are in a bad way unless he gets a huge influx of cash from Bradford. It is crucial for him to impress Bradford, but it will be hard to do that. There are no servants in the house because William fired them all that morning. To compensate, the four young people concoct a hasty plot. Richard and Beth will pretend to be the Harcourts and the actual Harcourts will pose as servants because Richard and Beth aren't familiar enough with the household to do an adequate job waiting on Bradford.

Initially the plan seems to be working, but it soon gets thrown off track when Bradford, a pushy blowhard, makes an increasingly strong play for Maude in her role as the maid. Before long, he begins urging Richard and Beth, in their roles as the Harcourts, to go to bed and leave him alone with Maude, which is extremely  upsetting to both Harcourts and embarrassing for the innocent Richard and Beth.

All Night is not only one of Valentino's earliest appearances on film, it is one of his very few comedies. The athleticism he later displayed in his Sheik persona is humorously employed in this film in multiple instances of slapstick, such as falling out a window and into a barrel of water. The romantic relationship is adorable, and the comedy of errors a lot of fun.

I highly recommend this film to fans of silent film, fans of Rudolph Valentino, and fans wacky, romantic comedy.",1273276800,9,2329,4.827067669172933
