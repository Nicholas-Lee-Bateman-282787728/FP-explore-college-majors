3556330,4,B001EN46NO,"If people claim that their lives are the same from the cradle to the grave they are being less than truthful.  If we put our entertainers up on pedestals and hold them to our own standards without seeing them as living, growing, changing people we do ourselves and them a disservice.  Bob Dylan is nothing if not one who goes his own way.  He sees the world from his point of view that just happens to be what many other people would like to see.  He sees in a light that is really quite different and very personal.  The songs he writes come from a place that only he knows and understands.

When he declared his belief in Jesus as his Lord and Savior it was a very personal decision that was expressed in his art and music. This time in his life was very mysterious to his hardcore fans who lived through a time of sex, drugs, and rock & roll.  The problem is that the Christianity that most people know is expressed in very severe terms; just check out the televangelists of the health and wealth gospel.  This presentation goes to the heart of what Dylan lived at the time both in his new found faith and his art.  The interviews come from both sides of the debate: his Christian teachers and the musicians who worked with him.  One of the most interesting segments is the interview with Jerry Wexler, the producer of ""Slow Train Coming.""  Pay attention to this.

To get a balanced view of this time in Bob's life buy this.  It will be well worth the time spent watching and the money spent acquiring it.

3556331,1,B001EN46NO,"I own:'Bob Dylan 1975-1982: Rolling Thunder And The Gospel Years'.  From reading the product information of this DVD ""Inside Bob Dylan's Jesus Years,..."" it seems like Gilbert just edited his 2006 'Bob Dylan 1975-1982: Rolling Thunder And The Gospel Years' by removing all the Rolling Thunder content and renaming it ""Inside Bob Dylan's Jesus Years: Busy Being Born... Again!"".  ""Again"" is right!  Rip off, I'd say if you already own the 2006 DVD.  My review of that DVD would be in agreement with the previous review - a little cheesy, Bob Dylan is not in it because it is unauthorized, but you do learn some interesting information.  If I am mistaken, please someone who has seen both of these straighten me out.  I emailed Gilbert but did not hear back.",1241308800,8,756,4.776923076923077
3556332,2,B001EN46NO,"I purchased this for my husband for Christmas as he is a really big Dylan fan. It didn't live up to the glowing reviews that i had read, it could have been done better, a little corny. But it was informative, we learned some things we hadn't know before. Left us wanting to see more old footage of Dylan's concerts and music!",1241136000,3,325,4.258064516129032
3556333,5,B001EN46NO,This dvd is a welcomed addition to my collection. So happy to have the story inside of Bob Dylan's Jesus years and hope they have remained with him.,1396656000,,148,4.321428571428571
3556334,5,B001EN46NO,I was moved by this film. This was totally unexpected. I have bought Slow Train Coming and Shot of Love after seeing this film. My spirituality has been given a Shot of Dylan.,1377561600,6,175,4.333333333333333
3556335,1,B001EN46NO,"This was one of the biggest waste of money I've made in a while.  There's no original music.  The photos are grainy, and the music is all by Highway 61 Revisited.  I can understand this guy's obsession with Dylan, but to profit off a half assed made DVD is not so cool.  Do not buy, unless you like throwing money away.",1357776000,2,319,4.180327868852459
3556336,1,B001EN46NO,Do not buy this DVD... it is not worth the money.  Boring and with no Bob content.  Lots of interviews but nothing really interesting for die hard Dylan folks.,1334966400,2,159,4.448275862068965
3556337,4,B001EN46NO,"Bob Dylan's so-called 'Jesus years' have been cruelly maligned by fans and onlookers alike, perceiving his conversion to Christianity as his second betrayal. His move from folk to rock 'n roll, embracing the electric guitar, and all the potential that such a weapon of Dylan's would have, had the same impact as his salvation, both events being decried by his audience.

The records that belonged to this period include, Slow Train Coming, the awesome, spirited and uplifting Saved, as well as part of the gospel tinged Shot Of Love. This documentary covers this period by seeking commentary from pastors, musicians, record producers, journalists, a little bit of footage from Dylan's live performances and one interview.

Inside Bob Dylan's Jesus Years: Busy Being Born Again, is a curious documenatry, highlighting something that has been all but ignored by many music fans, inspite of the reverence of his adoring fan base. It does give the impression it was made on a small budget, but the interviews are warm and wonderful and all the right questions are asked. Definitely worth a look.",1307404800,7,1091,5.089385474860335
3556338,3,B001EN46NO,I wasn't sure why this video was made.  I found most of it entertaining because I lived through this time in history and was in San Francisco for the concert Bob Dylan gave. It brought back some fond memories. I knew what was shared about the concert was true.  I am curious what Bob Dylan's take on this video would be. It left me with more questions than answers. I was hoping for more of Bob Dylan's personal testimony and found it odd that he was not part of its making.,1301702400,4,474,4.197802197802198
3556339,3,B001EN46NO,"This EASILY could have been a 70 minute TIGHT documentary. Instead it's running time has been bloated with horrible shots of the director driving and walking around. It also has the worst editing I've ever seen in a docu. Every few seconds during the interviews the video will cut to a cheesy clip-art image of one of the subjects a person is talking about. If someone says ""drugs"" we are treated to pics of syringes in someone's arm. If they say ""car"" we are shown a lovely stock shot of a car for no reason. If they say ""funny"", cut to a clown's face...EXTREMELY annoying and childish. It would have been much better without all this amateurish bunk. Even with these faults I DID find this to be an interesting docu and appreciate the fact that someone bothered to tackle the subject of Dylan's conversion at all. I just wish it was shorter and without all the horrible stock images.",1269302400,8,885,4.5375
3556340,4,B001EN46NO,"I think that there are some people who do not know very much about this period of Bob Dylan's life. This story is very inspiring. However, I wish that there could have been more of Dylan's gospel music in the video. Also, Closed Captions would have been helpful.",1258848000,3,262,4.479166666666667
3556341,1,B001EN46NO,"I'm comfortable with evangelical Christians and I loved Dylan's first couple of gospel albums. This ""documentary"" does neither any great credit. The best you can say for it is that the DVD is well-intentioned. But seldom have good intentions proved so dull. (Contains no original Dylan music.)",1253059200,4,293,5.25531914893617
3556342,1,B001EN46NO,"Yes Karen, I just watched 5 minutes and pulled out my ""Rolling Thunder Gospel Years"" and came to post the same comment. What a drag this Gilbert guy is. Amazon too, for sending me the, ""Look what's new, Dylan fan"" email. Don't waste your time, these Gilbert videos are interesting, but not that interesting. You want to see or hear Dylan, this isn't the place. You want to see Gilbert trying to look like Dylan, have at it.",1243814400,2,423,4.435897435897436
8298905,1,B001EN46NO,"This dvd seems more about the people who brushed up against Bob Dylan during his ""Jesus Years"" rather than  Bob Dylan's Jesus Years.
Very disappointing dvd. Nothing but a bunch of baby boomers pontificating on what happened during that time in history while a photo of Bob Dylan flashes from time to time on the up on the screen.  Save your money and steer clear of this irrelevant piece of garbage.",1484784000,,399,4.605633802816901

8298907,2,B001EN46NO,No thing abt. Bobby's quoted love for jesus. I was surprised not to hear more guts. Sorry film.,1483833600,,95,4.333333333333333

8298909,5,B001EN46NO,"for the Believer wanting to know how Dylan's faith influenced his music from 1979-1984, this documentary will answer their questions and reinforce their faith in Christ. For the non-believer, you're questions and unbelief will be shaken to the core.",1471996800,,249,5.410256410256411
8298910,4,B001EN46NO,"interesting, though long on interviews and short on footage",1429401600,,59,5.666666666666667
8298911,3,B001EN46NO,"Have not watched this but did see him play in Birmingham AL right after Slow Train (Muscle Shoals) came out. There was a lot more ""Preaching"" than music that night and I felt like I was at Church instead of a Dylan show. Wasn't many people there that night at the Concert hall so I moved all around the room (I had snuck my camera in by tubesock and security kept me mobile)...anyway if You were at this show I apologize for being the idiot that kept screaming ""Pass the Plate Bob""!",1423612800,,482,4.25
8298912,3,B001EN46NO,A rambling look at Dylan's gospel period. Some great questions from the interviewer. Apparently this was condensed from a longer documentary. It could still use some editing. Weird use of low-quality clip art for some transitional graphics.,1419033600,2,240,5.513513513513513
8298913,1,B001EN46NO,"Very disappointing. Interviews with Dylan alumni from the period were OK.
No footage of Dylan playing any of this material.
Also, the DVD kept 'sticking' and had glitches all of the way through.",1417910400,,194,4.909090909090909
