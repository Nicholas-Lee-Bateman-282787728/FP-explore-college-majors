7836634,1,6303052452,"This wasn't even on the level of a B movie. I watched it because I'd read good things about Lynn Bari, but I'm sorry to say that I found nothing at all to recommend her acting or screen presence. The movie was just another of those old westerns that were shown every afternoon on TV back in the 50s. They were terrible then and they're terrible now.",1448323200,,349,4.223880597014926

7836638,3,6303052452,Its ok with me.  I enjoy all the old westerns.  This one was no exception.  The technology of moving picture shows was in its infancy but improving year by year.  I always enjoy looking int he background of the scenes and noting how things were made in those days.  The homes had plank floors and sometimes with large cracks in them.  It always amazed me that the outside of the ranch house would look like it was going to fall down but when the inside scene came on it was a different story. The house was furnished lavishly with carpets on the floor and artifacts of all types displayed.  This movie was no exception.  You will enjoy it if you pay attention to all things in it.,1407888000,,680,4.299212598425197

7836640,3,6303052452,"Maybe whoever copied this and then sold it thought that no one would notice because it's an old black and white.
WRONG! It's such a poor copy it looks like it was shot on toilet paper.
Very disappointed in the quality.",1388534400,,218,4.341463414634147

The story begins with a steam locomotive running in the country. Masked men ride. ""El Paso Kid on Rampage"" says the newspaper. There is a shoot-out in town, and a higher reward is offered. A wife worries about her husband. His work requires him to travel far away. The local people don't know what Toby does. His wife Zee sent their children away, she leaves too. Toby decides to reform, so she stays. Their wedding is interrupted by the appearance of strangers in town. They escape by jumping across a chasm. Toby has a new way to get money from a bank. There is some comedy here! The Heath store sells fodder for horses. His old friends drop by to see him. Will he do one more job? The stagecoach is drawn by six horses. The search reveals no loot! Toby sends Billy away.

Toby stops at a small house for victuals. The lonely widow Weeks tells her story. Her late husband mortgaged the farm, and now she may lose it and become homeless. Toby explains what she must do when the banker arrives to foreclose. But Widow Weeks pays off her loan! The banker Sam was robbed for the money afterwards! The Kid repays his loan to the surprise of the banker. Then there is a complication. Can someone warn the Sheriff? An explosion warns everyone. The Kid and his gang return to their past endeavors. Can they get away this time? The posse closes in on Toby. He is reported killed. ""Never get your picture taken."" The Marshal calls on Mr. Heath to join the posse and find the El Paso Kid. The pass allows Toby to ride at night. Would someone betray him?

Toby is captured by the Marshal. Someone talked for the reward money. The Kid gets ten years. But the train is stopped by a robbery. Will the Kid act in a heroic manner? [Believable?] The Governor reduces his sentence. Toby and Zee are married in church. Will they live happily ever after?

This story echoes the life of Jesse James but with a happy ending. This was adapted from a stage play. The story is of average quality. It tells what entertained audiences in the 1940s. Did Westerns decline in popularity after WW II? This is one example of moral relativism, where the outlaws who prey on ordinary people are portrayed favorably. No mention of the problems caused by the bank losses and bankruptcies. The loss of money had a bad effect on the local economy, similar to the closure of local manufacturing and its loss of jobs.",1278374400,,2405,4.471526195899772
