7985531,3,B00008N73V,"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Escape-From-Taliban/dp/B000LMPMNM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Escape From Taliban</a>&nbsp;starring Manisha Koirala is a film based on a bestselling Bengali book called  ""Kabuliwalar Bangali Bou"" (""A Kabuliwala's Bengali Wife"") based on the true-life experiences of Sushmita Banerjee, a young woman from Calcutta, India trying to live in Afghanistan under the evil tyranny of the Taliban.

Sushmita is a headstrong & stuborn young girl who falls in love (or rather more like is seduced by!) a handsome Afghani man, called Jaanbaz Khan, who manipulates the nave young Sushmita to marry him in spite of her family's concerns & strong objections.

Defying her family, Sushmita elopes with Jaanbaz to his native Afghanistan, only to discover that her family was right, and Jaanbaz was/is an untrustworthy cad, who lied to her and betrayed her. Not only is Jaanbaz already married and living with his wife, Gulgutti in his family's compound, but Sushmita is prohibited from leaving, and held virtual prisoner, witnessing (and even being subjected to) severe beatings of women for the slightest infraction. If that's not bad enough, soon Jaanbaz leaves & returns to India alone, leaving Sushmita under the ""supervision"" of her intolerant & fundamentalist, patriarchal in-laws, and she soon realizes that the only way she will survive & reclaim her freedom is to flee the country and escape the Taliban (and her husband) altogether!

From the blurb on the back of the DVD box:

Based on a true story, Escape from Taliban is a riveting drama that confronts the unspeakable truth of Afghanistan under the rule of the Taliban. Sushmita is a young woman from India who falls in love with a handsome Afghani. Leaving (on the box it says ""Living"" but I suspect that was a missed typo or other misspelling) her own country and family, she follows him to his homeland. Jaanbaz, her husband, eagerly describes the wonderful life they will share, and the family they will raise in the hilly terrain near Kabul. Sushmita believes she has never been happier in her life, but she will soon discover that in following her heart to Afghanistan, she has made the biggest mistake of her life.
In Afghanistan, Sushmita is confronted with a horrific new reality. Under the rule of the Taliban, women are considered commodities whose sole purpose is to bear children, she is forced to take the life as it is. At first, Sushmita's love for Jaanbaz makes the ill treatment bearable. But one night, Sushmita discovers her husband's terrible secret, and realizes that he, too, has considered her little more than a commodity all along. The love she thought they shared turned out to be a lie.
Trapped in a loveless marriage in a suffocating, intolerant society, Sushmita makes an unlikely and courageous decision. She resolves to reclaim her lost freedom or die trying. Join Sushmita on her courageous journey to escape the snares of the oppressive Taliban society and return to her homeland. Watch the conflict escalate until the Taliban ultimately deliver a fatwah -- a death sentence- against her and witness the heroic role the Afghani women play in her struggle for freedom.
Sushmita's story is one that you will never forget.

At home, my family either spoke English or Konkani (a language spoken on the western coast of India as well as the official language of the state of Goa, and a minority language in the state of Karnataka and northern Kerala) so with the exception of the sporadic Hindi classes we took as children, we did not have much experience with Hindi.

Thus, since we understand very little (just a few random words, phrases, etc.) of Hindi, and subtitles were not available on the VHS tapes, we had to rely on our mom for translation of the dialogue. Though I'm sure she tried her best, what would inevitably happen is that while she was translating one segment of conversation, she would miss the next one, so there would be huge gaps in the translation, and often essential dialogue would deliberately (if she didn't want to translate something, thinking we weren't old enough to hear it) or accidently left out. So we had to figure out the story from the pictures and inconsistent & incomplete translations. As a result, we didn't watch many Bollywood movies growing up (the only Hindi movies I saw in childhood & adolescence were&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gopal-Krishna/dp/B006UXFUME/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gopal Krishna</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Masoom/dp/B0016GOKD0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Masoom</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ramayana/dp/B0002AAMVU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ramayana</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mahabharat/dp/B00023JH72/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mahabharat</a>, and maybe a couple/few others) I can count on one hand (with a couple of extra fingers!) or maybe two hands at the most, the number of Hindi movies I saw as a child and teenager.

But since the advent of DVDs with English subtitles (as well as Youtube, and online movie streaming), I've started watching a lot more Bollywood (and other genre) movies and I've been REALLY enjoying it!! I  Bollywood!

Unfortunately, as much as I  Bollywood, the ""Bollywood musical"" is ENTIRELY the WRONG format for a movie about a subject of this magnitude and is TOTALLY UNREALISTIC.............

Case in point, in one scene, when Sushmita & her ""daughter"" Tinni, are trying to escape from Afghanistan, they stop in the mountains, to do a song & dance number called ""Titli Si Ud Chali"" (one of my favorite songs in the film, but that's besides the point!). I mean, even the slightest bit of logic would dictate if that one is supposed to be RUNNING FOR THEIR LIVES, trying to flee from murderous thugs like the Taliban, that they WOULDN""T be stopping in-between to sing and dance in the mountains. Although Manisha Koirala, and the rest of the cast is clearly trying their best despite being given shoddy scripts and ridiculous plotlines that strain the limits of credulity, regrettably its not enough to salvage this train-wreck of a film. Its just too unrealistic -- absolutely LUDICROUS and would be LAUGHABLE if it weren't so sad!

However, although the movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Escape-From-Taliban/dp/B000LMPMNM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Escape From Taliban</a>&nbsp;is mediocre at best (AFAIK, even the author of the book that this movie is based on, withdrew her authorization & association with this film because it was so bad!) I LOVED almost all the songs, which, though it was not enough to make the movie better, the music is still great enough that I not only bought the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Escape-From-Taliban/dp/B005F6BI0A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Escape From Taliban</a>&nbsp;CD soundtrack, but I also got this movie DVD so that I could also see the video of the songs.

Its just too bad that the producers & directors of this film made light of such a serious issue/subject/problem exemplified by the fact that in September of 2013, Sushmita Banerjee, the author of the true-story book that this film is based on was abducted from her home and murdered by Taliban militants for, among other things, her book critical of the Taliban, and  for her activism, fighting for women's rights & equality! :(

** 2 STARS for the movie + **** 4 STARS for the songs= a rating of *** 3 STARS overall!!",1426464000,,7984,5.640833333333333
7985532,3,B00008N73V,"This Bollywood version of a serious story---it cost the author her life at the hands of the Taliban---begins rather well. OTT, in the best Bollywood style, it tells the true story of an Indian woman who impulsively runs  away from her educated family to marry an
Afghani man. She is soon shocked by the isolation, poverty, and illiteracy of the tribal society she encounters. Further surprises await her. Some family members are kind to her and help her in acclimating.  Her adaptation to her new life is soon shattered by the growing influence of the Taliban. The serious story is interspersed with the typical Bollywood sequences of lavish daydreams, OTT performances of wedding rituals, etc., which are great fun, if jarringly out of place to Western tastes. The story then drags on, again much too long for Western tastes, but interesting. The movie was filmed before the author escaped, returned to her Indian family, decided to return to her husband because she truly loved him. In September of this year, she was kidnapped from her Afghan home and murdered by the Taliban.
