8424308,4,B004D0000I,"When I was a kid I loved the Jungle Jim series from Columbia. I actually knew Johnny Weissmuller as Jungle Jim before I knew him as Tarzan. He actually portrayed Jim more times than he played Tarzan. In 13 movies and a syndicated TV series. When Johnny got too old to realistically  portray the King of the Jungle,Sam Katzman hired him to portray the Jungle Jim character based on the King Features comic strip character created by Alex Raymond. All the films from the series were good juvenile fun and as you got older they became good camp fun. Katzman let the rights to the character lapse and so in the last 3 films from the series Johnny Weissmuller played Johnny Weissmuller. Sort of like Roy Rogers and Gene Autry playing themselves in B-Westerns. Which kind of made sense. Especially after two decades starring in jungle movies. This one was fun with a She-like ""blonde goddess"" ruling over a tribe of pygmies. Just where did all these blonde goddesses come from anyway?It's not great art. It was produced by Sam Katzman and starred Johnny Weissmuller on a budget of what seems like $5000 for goodness sake!!!But it is entertaining. If you like potted plant jungle movies you'll like this one.",1397174400,6,1201,4.719047619047619
