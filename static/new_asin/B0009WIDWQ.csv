8068245,4,B0009WIDWQ,Amazon is incorrect to say that Harry Kupfer is the director of this production--it is Graham Vick as you can read on the box.,1444521600,,126,4.291666666666667
8068246,5,B0009WIDWQ,Possibly my favorite of Richard Croft's filmed operas.,1414540800,,54,5.875
8068247,3,B0009WIDWQ,"Musically this is my favourite of all the Pellass our their, but the revisionist setting in a kind of Edwardian mansion, also serving as a forest, a grotto and so on, is just too much of a distraction, as is the fact that sometimes the action doesn't go along with the text. And Mlisande, beautiful as she is, looks to be in her forties.

But who says you have to watch it? Turn your video screen off and you'll have a beautiful experience. The singing is exquisite throughout, and Andrew Davis's conducting brings a lucidity that you don't often hear in this opera.",1378944000,,566,4.495145631067961
8068248,2,B0009WIDWQ,"It is quite well known that Debussy's Pelleas et Melisande has received, on the surface of things, equally and in way of being all set in a mansion, updated settings for its action as the dvd under review here - almost much to do about nothing to mention it.

The strong disrespect toward Debussy's score here, in favor of what seems to some extent a tradition that trumps everything where it happens and where this indeed did, that is, at the Glyndebourne Festival of 1999, is utterly repulsive. The highly cluttered nature of Graham Vick's production is a serious liability. The singers in this, I found, most of the way through, except being made to follow Vick's demands closely as how and where to move on stage, are pretty much on their own, in terms of being so little supported by either Vick or Andrew Davis in any meaningful way.

We first see Christine Oelze a very coquettish Melisande (as cock-tease), seemingly almost incapable of holding sheets over her naked breast, not to completely expose herself to Golaud and all the rest of us.  She sings the part just reasonably well and has some of the best diction of anyone in this cast, but her tone tends to spread around the middle and her pitch turns juddery for her Act Three chanson. She, from point on of the second scene of the opera, becomes prim housewife and even sports a few facial expressions maybe worthy of Hyacinth's friend Elsiabeth, but that do not really fit Melisande. It is just simply a repulsive joke and Vick's way of feeling he has to over-explain everything and give just about every character in Pelleas back stories, that he makes a big deal of Melisande being pregnant, and then as no more than snide humor,have us guess whether it could  belong to Golaud, Pelleas, or Arkel.

Richard Croft, for most of the way up until the final love scene, sounds a little remindful of George Shirley on the old CBS Boulez recording. Hs attitude toward dynamics written in the music and diction, up to this point, is casual.  He also tends to make little of so many lines that give his part so much opportunity for nuance; pitch at times becomes unsure as well.  He is capable of more than this, as evident on the best and possibly only worthy nine minutes of the entire dvd, which are in Act Four.  Any physical interest in Melisande, to put it nicely, is understated, but due to the utter straitjacketing of just about all the acting on this dvd as much as anything.  Right before starting `Je les nous' in his second long scene with Melisande, something is heard to creak while she is extending her stitched-on hair down from her position in an increasingly phallic looking chandelier.  The handling of all this is outr, it is so visually and pointlessly ugly.

Pelleas's gazing at the chandelier swinging low, together with Golaud, in the next scene, is a new low, almost turning Golaud into Fernando Rey in Bunuel's Tristana (with Catherine Denueve) with the very phallic looking church bell. Vick may have not completely read the libretto, where Golaud speaks of something potentially hitting the two men in the face, and following Golaud's line about the stench of death, which obliquely reminds of a line toward the end of Bergman's Silence, about how one female lead's own orgasm makes her smell like rotting fish.

Making more effort, in terms of diction than either Croft or Howell, is John Tomlinson as Golaud. He is entirely up to the part, vocally, but makes something less than dignified and entirely believable as Pelleas's half-brother.  Emotionally and psychologically, one in essence gets a torso with what by way of lack that implies, of the part of Golaud instead of the real thing.  Tomlinson, from so much of his work in Wagner, even up to the year he participated in this, is capable of so much more.  Jose Van Dam is vastly preferable in the part, especially on dvd from Lyon. He is walked on for the long middle scene of Act Two, and looks like he has staggered in as typical hippie from a drunken brawl, and then looks almost ready to get off the couch to dance a jig nearly halfway through the scene.  His open display of frivolity toward Pelleas and Melisande at end of Act Three, Scene One is ridiculous.

Gwynne Howell is the adequately resonant Arkel, not better mindful of dynamics than most everybody else in this Pelleas, and constantly unsure of pitch. His famous line about `une grand innocence"" of Melisande starts and ends (quite badly) out of tune;  other lines in Act Four seem to completely dislodge from any sense of tonal center whatsoever. Worse, he kind of stumbles onto stage as kind of a twitchy layover from the 1960's and almost resembling as much as an Arkel a geriatric parody off Monty Python,  Arkel has then at first practically more (unintentional) humor than Howell's fine cameo portrayals in Houston recently as Benoit and Alcindoro.  We do not care that Vick has watched Bunuel's L'Age d'Or for how he has Arkel embrace Melisande right before Golaud (with newfound mania for cutting himself) starts in on her in Act Four. Jean Rigby, except for having to follow stupid stage direction, at least sings Genevieve very well.  Jake Arditti seems reasonably able to sing in tune, but tends to tense up quite a bit for this production and very frequently not do so as Yniold.

The close camera on Yniold's crooked teeth reminds me of the libertines in closely examining the teeth of their prospective slaves/victims in 120 Days of Sodom by Pasolini.  Golaud is at least turned into a virtual pedophile, the way the stage is set up for Yniold to spy on the two lovers at the end of Act 3. Stripping such a complex, even so beautifully conceived creation as Golaud or any character of his or her dignity - reducing such a character to something perfectly two-dimnensional - seems here to be just fine with Vick. All the extra noise and carrying on over a box of toy sheep in his solo scene of Act Four is just more clutter, more abuse.

The ultimate blame for the utter desecration, without adequate explanation in the least, lies at the feet of Andrew Davis, who could have insisted otherwise. True to Glyndebourne tradition but only casually so to Debussy, he draws sound out of the London Philharmonic deficient in grasping overtones and harmonic depth.  Pacing is good, except for being a little too fast in the last scene of Act Four, but any sense of life within such pacing, is missing, and that is most apparent, in leaving his cast pretty much on their own - without the type of adequate support they need. Attempts at nuance for woodwinds, such as with oboe a little into Act Two, arrive as maudlin, kind of palm court approximation of verismo.  He injects the most insipid form of scherzoso into numerous more animated passages, also denying them of any life, except for how flaccid his sense of any existing life must be.  Winds and brass are seldom terrible in intonation, but frequently unsteady nevertheless. Briefly getting to watch Davis implies his being mildly deficient in technique or at least in good aesthetics for Debussy.

The sets for this production are lavish, with central spiraling staircase, and glass floor with visible right underneath, hothouse of flowers.  The lighting, which is very expert, is best when dim and throwing shadows.  Its suddenly coming on bright numerous times, especially in the closing scene of Act Two, is both garish and insipid.  Vick's production shows at best lackadaisical interest in the characters of Debussy's Pelleas, and really seems just to be more about Vick - including need to over-explain everything - what could be highly unrsolved Oedpial crisis in his life than anything to do with Pelleas et Melisande.  Having the entire cast of characters on stage for the final scene of the opera, at visitation for Pelleas as much as vigil for Melisande, does not compensate, but only further shows for such undergraduate caliber stage direction how far directorial ego can extend itself.

This Pelleas, to paraphrase a line from Fanfare on a new Tristan dvd, is merely a bauble for the wealthy patrons of Glyndebourne, more absurdly expensive of course than would ever go to Yniold. The best antidote for such a Pelleas would perhaps come from who gave us La Scala's Trittico so recently - Luca Ronconi and Riccardo Chailly.  In fact, with how Chailly has grown as a musician over so many years now, one could stand to hear, see a revisionist-stance Pelleas, it would serve as perfect antidote to this. For now, until I can report on TDK's Zurich Pelleas, the expertly cast, abstractly staged Lyon one  - staged with far greater simplicity and meaning than here - conducted by Gardiner (since WNO is not technically up to it and Boulez's cast of singers is incompetent) should be mostly satisfying enough.

8068249,4,B0009WIDWQ,"I saw the excellent Pierre Boulez production of this opera, loved it and wanted to see another.  When I saw this and Golaud appeared in a 19th century parlour sitting on a wing chair remarking that he is lost in a forest ... And then shortly finding Melisande lying on a table covered by a cloth ... Whew!  What a stretch of the imagination this production demands!!!  It only gets worse, with Melisande eventually hanging out of a huge chandelier, which is supposed to represent a tower.  Etc.

The performances were fantastic in spite of the setting.  All deserve five stars.  Even so, I thought Richard Croft as Pelleas and Christian Oelze as Melisande were too ""normal,"" compared to Neill Archer and Alison Hagley, who somehow managed to portray an ""other-worldliness.""

If you already know the story, then you will enjoy this production, too, in spite of the setting.",1202428800,7,872,4.805369127516778
8068250,3,B0009WIDWQ,"This DVD is peopled with a wonderful cast of English singers.  They could hardly be bettered. But the direction works against the music at every turn.  Instead of the various scenes indicated in the score it all takes place in an Edwardian living room.  Melisande is discovered on the dining room table clothed in a sheet! (who left the front door open so that an unknown naked woman could wander in?) In a later scene she appears smartly dressed in an Edwardian ""day"" outfit.  This only begins to enumerate the inconsistancies with the libretto.  The net result is that all of the mystery associated with the characters is gone.  Melisande has no mystery at all.  She is a smartly turned out English lady. When will be be free of directorial ""creativity?"" The austerity of the sets in the Boulez set are not always attractive but it gives a much better feel of the piece than this mess. Too bad.  These wonderful singers deserve better.  So do opera lovers.",1201564800,3,958,4.654761904761905
8068251,5,B0009WIDWQ,"Its incredible to witness a performance that comes so close to the magical Karajan recording with Von Stade, Stillwell, Van Dam and Raimondi. The young lovers are completely convincing and even if the more lyrical moments are beyond Tomlinson, his gruff singing provides a good contrast to this extremely lyrical score. Gwynne Howell seems born to sing Arkel. His portrayal is every bit the embodiment of nobility past its prime. The murder of Pelleas provides a musical and dramatic climax that is nearly overwhelming in its emotional intensity
The updating to the turn of the last century provides the story with more relevance to our time and the single set of a winding staircase on a flowery floor isn't as limiting as you might expect.",1193875200,3,741,4.936
8068252,5,B0009WIDWQ,"Many years ago I listened to Pelleas Melisande on CD, and almost fell to sleep. But I liked Graham Vick's directing(Lulu), and tried this DVD,  trusting his mastery. The result was satisfactory. First of all casting was excellent. Richard Croft and John Tomlinson played their roles earnestly and passionately, Christiane Oelze was very beautiful and subtle. Though for singing I prefered Maria Ewing's, her singing was also remarkable. I however liked the stage most of all. The romantic but authentic set seemed to represent the rigid atmosphere of Arkel & Golaud, and the pressure Pelleas, Melisande & Ynold might suffer. I feel his stage directing is not too conventional, not too modern, but visually delicate.",1167696000,8,715,5.217391304347826
8068253,5,B0009WIDWQ,I have seen and heard hundreds of operas and pride myself that I have liked nearly all of them. However I have always considered Pelleas et Melisande to be a colosal bore! I am also a tradionalist when it comes to staging operas and am furious with the way that many operas are staged today. The previous reviews intrigued me - so I decided to gamble. I am now a convert! I now have a real appreciation of the opera which receives an excellent performance and  magnificent staging!,1156896000,12,481,4.465909090909091
8068254,5,B0009WIDWQ,"In his production for Glyndebourne Graham Vick exchanges Debussy's murky forests and casts for a massive Edwardian mansion dominated by an enormous curved staircase and a glass floor under which seem to be millions of chrysanthemums.  Despite the lack of traditional locations, the story works beautifully and some of the symbolism is astonishing and visually stunning, e.g., the final scene with flames quietly engulfing the massive staircase.

I love Vick's work with singers and the singers seem to respond to him in the manner one expects only of the finest stage actors.  Richard Croft's remarkable performance as Pelleas begins barefoot and in short pants establishing, for once, this character's youth and aimlessness.  This image is further enhanced with the introduction of Yniold almost from the start as the two with toy boats by the water's edge.  They are uncle and nephew, one, much older than the other, but both still boys.  Croft plangent tenor offers the role an absolutely gorgeous, youthful sound, warm and bright making case can be made that this role is now best suited to a tenor, thus making the distinction between the brothers even stronger.  Croft's facial expressions, his ability to swing between ecstatic exhilarated joy to crushed devastation is sensational.  That voice combined with the physical intensity of his actions make him today's Pelleas of choice.

Christiane Oelze is a stunning, complicated Melisande; a bit of a natural born troublemaker.  The famous ""Tower scene"" finds her hanging upside down from an immense chandelier, endless hair cascading from it, beneath her a supine Pelleas.  As the chandelier lowers Pelleas covers himself with her hair and the scene nearly erupts into an almost unbridled show of eroticism, Pelleas barely able to control himself and Melisande leading the way.  As sensual as she is physically, Oelze's voice throughout is liquid and exquisite, capturing nuances the best interpreters of this role find in it.

John Tomlinson is a rougher than usual Golaud, his bent towards violence portending trouble early on.  His using Yniold to spy on the couple is chilling theatre as violently he kicks, smashing one of the glass tiles of the floor.  He is nothing less than brutal in his handling of his young son.  It is a terrified Yniold who flees him, hopelessly banging on the doors for someone to release him from this nightmare.  Golaud's violence, of course, extends to both brother and wife, yet following each episode his remorse seems genuine and heartbreaking.  Tomlinson presents a Golaud who unravels before our eyes, a man who simply cannot cope.  It is chilling.

Glyndebourne Music Director, Andrew Davis moves things along to a good, flowing tempi and the London Philharmonic responds with breathtaking sound, alternately dense and diaphanous.  This is, quite simply, one of my favorite performances of any opera and haunting, tragic lyric theatre at its very best.",1121817600,40,2949,5.192389006342495
