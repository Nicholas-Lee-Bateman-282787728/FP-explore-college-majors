8668274,5,B00LUUSASI,"Karen Black was one of my all time favorite actresses. If you have only seen her in one of the schlockfest horror films that she did in the second half of her career than I would suggest seeing her in Day of the Locust (Oscar worthy acting along with Donald Sutherland) or Five Easy Pieces with Jack Nicholson.  A notable later work, little known but arguably one of the best indie films of the 1990's called Red Dirt is a must see with stunning locations and cinematography.",1451174400,,475,4.459770114942529

8668276,5,B00LUUSASI,"An interesting, intimate and inspirational interview with one of the most fascinating, versatile actresses of our time. I have always been a huge fan of Karen Black ever since I was very young. I had the pleasure of meeting her back in the 90's and telling her how much I had admired her. I must say that her death saddened me deeply, and there wasn't a dry eye in my home at the end of this film. Well done and highly recommended for any fan. Thanks for making this interview happen. RIP Karen...",1409097600,4,497,4.354838709677419
