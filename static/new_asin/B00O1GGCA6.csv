6701641,3,B00O1GGCA6,"It's more than a little sad to see Bob's condition here. He's not in peak form, but then you'd expect that, since less than three months after this show he collapsed while running in Central Park and the Uprising tour was scrapped. Six months later Bob would be dead from the cancer that had spread through his body. He was worked to death, really, but how much of that was people around him and how much was his own determination to work as often as possible is hard to say. But it's clear that those close to him, who he should have been able to rely on, didn't always have his best interest at heart.

Ah well, on to the performance here. Bob puts on his usual lively, leaping show, but his voice cracks in several places, and he honestly looks like he's just going through the motions much of the time. Of course Bob running half-throttle is still more mesmerizing than most other performers at the very top of their game. The Wailers aren't as tight here as they were on many other live recordings and the Live! and Santa Barbara DVDs. It was relatively early in the tour, and who knows what was going on offstage. But they were usually better than this.

Unfortunately a terrible mix way too heavy on Wire's Hohner Clavinet (which sounds like it's run through an envelope filter to supply the rhythm guitar ""skank"" that was missing from the band when Bob wasn't playing) makes much of this painful to listen to. A bad mix isn't unusual for a TV show soundtrack, but it really doesn't help here.

The thing is, for as famous and influential as he was, there are very few officially released live DVDs of Bob and the Wailers, so you take what you can get. But there are probably 100 hours of Marley show bootleg videos, and in many of those you can see him and the Wailers give shows that are borderline transcendent. This isn't one of those, but for the casual Marley fan, I'm sure this will not disappoint.",1417392000,19,1912,4.426136363636363

Most of the Rockplast shows are well done and this is no exception.  Even though I have had the video of the show for sometime, having this restored version is a great gift for what happens to be a Thanksgiving weekend.  While I think a little more upgrading to the video quality might have been possible, this version is very acceptable.  Best of all the audio is considerable improved and the end result makes it one of the best Marley converts available commercially.  Particularly nice is the I-Threes opening that is included.  If you never to to see Bob Marley in the flesh, this will give you a great chance to feel the PositiVibe!  This production is worth it for the encore performances of Coming in From the Cold and Lively Up Yourself alone.

Maybe one day we will get a similar restoration and release of Gabon.",1416960000,7,1073,5.233918128654971

It sounds like an audience recording, or that the audio was from a microphone mounted on one of the video cameras, sound is muddy, no clarity, fuzzy vocals. I wonder if a soundboard recording of the show exists, if so it would be a major improvement.",1436572800,,324,4.603448275862069

6701650,5,B00O1GGCA6,"This is an incredible concert.  This is the very last concert Bob give. It was in Germany before he went to the clinic in Switzerland.
The band does amazing things not found on the album versions and Bob speeds up some of the songs that makes them even more forceful and transcendent, conveying a kind of urgency.
This DVD would be worth it just for the I Threes doing some of their best individual compositions in the first four songs prior to the main concert.  So what if the video quality is grainy and the sound a little distorted occasionaly.  I will take it anyway because there aren't any real HD DVDs out there of Bob's concerts.  I love the Santa Barbara concert however and the sound is better.  It didn't precede this one by much.  Bob was skeletal and weak in both but strong in spirit.
Over two hours here of great music.  Quality is still very listenable.",1425513600,6,870,4.433962264150943

6701653,5,B00O1GGCA6,"Yes , when Bob comes out , in time , feeling the love from this crowd (which is insanely into every move and lyric from Bob ) one does see as his face comes into the light how gaunt he looks . However , his energy was at a 10 for most of the show , a result of him knowing he was being filmed for history as well as album sales . For me , He looked as if a magnificent unseen Bible was opened and this biblical figure , the man who had transcended a human presence to appear as the Prophet many believe his is , was and forever shall be ( You can guess how I feel about this man ) . I could write all night so I'll be concise. ""I shot the Sheriff "" is thunderous , watch Bob's every move . It was said he never moved the same way twice. It is such a powerful version , goosebumps throughout . The last verse , the camera missed the patented , way too cool for any fool to copy, passing of his beloved gibson to his guitar tech in ""riddim"" but thanks that the entire last verse was on close up of bob. The humidity of the very hot venue had made his amazing dreads puff up to twice their size. Family man must have made an unseen que for just the bass and his brother Carly to lay the back beats that rocked Europe that night and my iPod very often while Bob Marley , 'BIBLICAL""  , magically so , told us how his reflexes had the better of him and with his right arm and hand , three fingers showing because he was still holding his pick waving into another world and this world at the same time sang with visceral power and passion from deep within him , from country to Kingston to Babylon  that 'what is to be must be - yeah-rah-eah eeaahh-eeeaaahhh"" with Aston filling perfect 8.5 bass lines when Bob brought it down , not a pin could be heard dropped between the aston brothers "" I'll Tell You What !!"" ..........'One day the bottom ( his patented  left arm going down to simulate that the bottom of the bucket will drop out and he meant , one day the bottom ah will drop out "" agh , Read it in the news !!! Dreads fly throughout  this show. Look for him telling us that "" Don't care what da worl say "" .........you know the rest . I love Bob Marley forever , toujours , Bob everywhere man",1421366400,9,2193,3.9547511312217196

6701662,4,B00O1GGCA6,"Review for 3 Disc (2CD/1DVD) Edition. Having read the not so great reviews here on Amazon, I put off buying UPRISING LIVE! for quite sometime. Then one day I was in Best Buy and this CD appeared in front of me and practically jumped right off the shelf and into my arms! (1 copy left) So I took that as a sign to take a chance and buy it. My opinion of this 2cd/1 dvd edition varies. Let me start with the DVD. I am a person who appreciates good sound (who doesn't?), it matters to me. The dvd is in my opinion is too compressed which leads to distorted, muffled sound quality. It does however have some moments of clarity, but those incidents are few and far between. I found it to be very irritating. But I would say that most people,(like my wife) will find the sound satisfactory. The mix is really bad, no matter how many times I tried to justify it. Bob is in pretty good form here, there are however better shows and sound quality available. Now for the CD's. In the end, the MUSIC is really all that matters to me. I primarily wanted to buy this to have another live cd of Marley. I wish there were ALOT MORE, but sadly there are not enough. I found the CD sound quality to be more up to par. (an improvement over the dvd) - While still not the greatest mix, I enjoy the cds much more than the dvd. It works for me. This is just my opinion. It is good enough that I welcome it into my collection. I Dig It and I am pleased to have bought it. 21/2 to 3 stars for the dvd, and 31/2 to 4 stars for the cds. I Hope my opinion helps you in your decision making in buying this edition. As far as Bob goes, I got to see him 3 times at the Tower Theater in Upper Darby, PA USA in the early 1970's. Before he reached Mega Star status. There was so much smoke you could barely see him or the band on the stage, as I recall. Anyway, I love Bob Marley and I miss him. I thought and still do think, that he was GOOD FOR THE WORLD and his voice was meant to be heard. I am glad I own it and I will take anything I can get to remember him by. Thanks for reading my review.",1419292800,9,2065,3.9425837320574164
6701663,1,B00O1GGCA6,"I have ALWAYS HATED with a passion music CD's that have the LOUDNESS WAR jacked up volume, I NEVER before had an example of that with a DVD until now! This DVD plays so LOUD, its like 10 times louder than any other DVD and it makes everything sound like CRAP!! Distorted loud thumping bass, total garbage! Unwatchable! They took a GREAT video from 1980 and utterly DESTROYED this!
There is just NO EXCUSE, none at all! You have a DVD that is capable of delivering the BEST audio and video and they come up with this rubbish! Its ruins the Bob Marley name! It was produced by Ziggy Marley so there you go, his CD's suffer from the crap ""Loudness wars"" and he over sought the Bob Marley Legend - REMIXED CD that was a absolute disgrace!
The ""Video"" of this was to be from the best sources, but it looks really no better than the DVD that has been selling this same concert now since 2009 called ""Marley in Germany 1980"". I would say just get that DVD but for $10 I'd say get this one. This DVD could and SHOULD have been awesome, its horrible! The show though by Bob Marley is awesome!",1417564800,3,1083,4.262135922330097
6701664,3,B00O1GGCA6,"I was quite disappointed with this new release. The overriding problem is a really poor audio mix with none of the crucial reggae-style monster bass lines one would expect. The opening numbers by the I-Threes are particularly tedious and really, it never quite takes off after that. I was hoping for something that would replace my Santa Barbara DVD which is, unfortunately, marred by a very annoying tendency to focus on the crowd, or should I say, on one or two individuals in the crowd, but it still remains a vastly superior performance.",1417392000,,541,4.827956989247312

8681455,4,B00O1GGCA6,"This was recorded for 'Rockpalast', a German television program, you've probably seen many of your favorite bands do shows and even release shows recorded by them.  They usually do a great job, and these days they ALWAYS do a great job.  But, in 1980 maybe they weren't at the peak of their powers so-to-speak.  Still, I've had this show for years and it always sounded good to me.  Now that it's been officially released, I think it sounds even better.  1980 was a great year for Bob Marley and The Wailers (and the I-Threes), and worrying about what are really VERY minor problems with the sound is really unnecessary.
