591520,5,6303192254,I found this movie too be a good character study for the duke.  It made a conserted try at bridging the gap between the white/settlers vs. the native americans/plains indians on how they related on a one to one basis instead of the enmasse scenarios which usually occupy the screen.  It made for a more entaining surprise that what was available for the times in the treatment of our native americans.  I highly recommend it for its simple format and good character study over any of the fight scenes that were shown.  A fine simple approach which is missing from the current lot of movies.,1026691200,2,590,4.59047619047619
591521,5,6303192254,"This is an overlooked John Wayne movie. Because of the unusual 3-D format, many people seem to forget this one. Wayne is at his best as the tough/tender Hondo Lane. I would recommend this to all John Wayne fans.",1026000000,3,211,4.435897435897436
591522,4,6303192254,"This movie was much better than I expected, in that it has some real human beings dealing with some genuinely touching issues, mainly about honesty.  Hondo is primarily a character study, focusing on John Wayne, Geraldine Page, and an Apache war chief, and their bizarre triangle of friendship and honor during the Indian wars.  Hondo is one of the Duke's most macho roles - he's tougher and more unbending than I've ever seen him before.  Countering this is Page's terrible performance in a typically sexist role for a 1950's western (""A woman should know how to cook,"" booms the Duke like a commandment).  As their love grows, they argue about honesty... Wayne in typical Duke-ish fashion refuses to tell even a white lie.  Yet, in the end, 3 lies are told, one to save Wayne's life, one to save their love, and another to prevent Page's son from growing up with the true knowledge of his scoundrel father (which we today know is a bad idea).  Still, Hondo's unbending honesty also saves their lives from the Apaches, so we are left with a well-rounded, *adult* view of honesty that still holds its relevance today.
I'm not sure why people complain about ""realism"" in these old movies - the Duke shoes his own horses right on film, no detail missed, as if he'd been doing it for years.  You'd never see that from an actor today!  The Apache indians are all played by Apache indians (including the leading roles) and their characters are all faithful to history.  Perhaps our modern ""notion"" of realism has changed.  The film has that washed-out nostalgic look in its coloring, but that was due to the technology of the time.  Of course, bad actors from the 1950's all seem to perform with the same annoying pace and vocal style, but I'm sure our modern equivallents will become apparent in 50 years, too.  A fine Wayne film.",1014508800,5,1826,4.671875
591523,3,6303192254,"I am an avid fan of Louis LaMour's writing, and I was disappointed in this film's inaccuracy to the book.  (What movie has ever followed a book accurately?)  Someone please tell me.  John Wayne plays his part well, and Geraldine Page is OK, but if anything, Ward Bond as Buffalo Baker might have been the most true-to-life performance of the film.
As a huge John Wayne fan, I automatically have to rank this movie higher than it probably deserves.  I mean, who does westerns better than the Duke?  Nobody.  It's just too bad the western didn't hang around longer.  I don't suppose it's coincedence that when the Duke died, for all intents and purposes so did the western.  ""Unforgiven"" and ""Dances With Wolves"" are really the only two exceptions.
In short, if you're a John Wayne fan, this movie is for you.  If you're not, I really don't think you'd like it.  For the Duke it's worth seeing (hey, isn't any movie with the Duke in it?), but other than him, no.",1013299200,,960,4.52906976744186
591524,4,6303192254,"Customer reviews of Hondo seem to bounce from ""great"" to ""poor."" It appears that most of the criticism, other than some editing, is caused by the fact that this is an early 1950's western. Come on folks, of course the Duke is freshly shaven all the time, Page's cabin looks spotless, etc. It was made in the 1950's!!! This sort of ""lack of realism"" complaint could be directed at virtually every western made up to the time and of many others after. .... The action is excellent, even for a Wayne action movie, certainly better than some of his higher profile ""Indian"" westerns such as Ft. Apache and even Rio Grande and She Wore a Yellow Ribbon. The tension and suspense waiting for the Apaches to come over the rise is palpable thoughout the movie. .... Acosta succeeds in this film as one of the most convincing of evil villains ever to appear in a western. .... If you don't have it, get it. You'll enjoy it a lot.",998870400,11,918,4.437869822485207
591525,5,6303192254,"Hondo: The movie is my personal favorite western of all time, out of my personal western movie collection of over 550 titles, Hondo stands above most of them and it can be compared to other ""classic"" westerns  like: Stagecoach, Fort Apache, Rio Grande, The Searchers, Winchester '73,  but to name just a few of many. I first saw Hondo when H.B.O. played it  about 20 years ago, I fell in love with that movie, I watched it over and  over again; you just can't get enough. Hondo is supposed to be a solo type  character, a loaner, it is easy to appreciate the morals that Hondo  teaches, and the lessons learned.

591671,5,6303192254,"Think Ralph Taeger is one underrated actor. He was shy man overcoming it, but he still has it in the series which is cute I think. Anyway - the story don't fall off the plot in the original book of L'Amour. There IS hint of developing love story between Hondo Lane to the girl at the shop(I am only on disc 2, so forgot her name in the series) played by Kathie. Just little amount of violence but it's all done in taste. Hondo claims the dog is free, and in a way that's a reflection on him, too. That was a brilliant idea by the series creator the make the cavalry man Hondo as a lone ranger, one without obligation, but you know where to find him and the serie is in good taste, really. Can't say more because I am still on disc 2. Ralph played in the short lived Klondike that was a hit in the 60's. I think series playing in the wrong time of day has a lot to do with their being cancelled. 1968-1980's Hawaii-Five-0  has change airing time and since then the series took off, and I think Hondo would have the same fate, if t.v minded it.

591706,3,6303192254,"Hondo: The Complete Series is based on the Louis LAmour story and the 1953 John Wayne movie derived from it. Ralph Taeger plays cavalry scout Hondo Lane, an embittered loner in the Arizona Territiory in the 1870s. Once a Confederate Cavalry captain, he had lived with the Apaches for a time under the protection of Chief Vittoro (Michael Pate), only to see his Indian bride  Vittoros daughter  slain by the army in a massacre.

Now he travels with a dog named Sam, troubleshooting for the army and trying to avert further bloodshed in the campaign against renegade Indians, land grabbers, gunmen, and bandits around Fort Lowell. Capt. Richards (Gary Clarke) is the young martinet commander of the fort, Buffalo Baker (Noah Beery, Jr.) a scout, and Angie Dow (Kathie Browne), Hondos romantic interest, a widow who runs the general store with the help of her nine-year-old son, Johnny (Buddy Foster).

Hondo Lane is from a familiar Western hero mold  quiet, dedicated to law and order, no family ties, with a preference to avoid violence but unafraid to stand up for the defenseless. Traeger doesnt have the stature of John Wayne, but does a credible job of channeling LAmours creation. The show has a number of parallels to the long-running Gunsmoke.

Guest stars include Robert Taylor, Nick Adams, Annette Funicello, Robert Reed, Claude Akins, John Carradine, Farley Granger, Iron Eyes Cody, Michael Rennie, Gary Merrill, Alan Hale, James MacArthur, Forrest Tucker, Charles McGraw, and Jack Elam.

The show originally ran for only a half season, from September to December, 1967. Only 17 episodes were aired. The shows early cancellation had more to do with its time schedule than its quality (it was up against Star Trek and Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.). All 17 episodes are contained on the 4-disc DVD release.

591816,5,6303192254,"Just finished watching this excellent series. It was as good as I remembered it from its 1967 original screening. John Wayne made the memorable film version back in 1953, and how great it would be if the 3D version of that one was released on blu ray.  The Duke's on screen charisma and western macho has resulted in him being generally regarded as the definitive ""Hondo"". It is possible that this probably worked against the TV series at the time of its original release. That, coupled with the fact that it was screened opposite two well established and popular series, and a general adverse reaction to violence on television, resulted in Hondo lasting for only seventeen episodes, and then virtually disappearing. This is a great shame, and unfair to what I consider to be one of the really great adult TV westerns. Louis L'Amour's early western heroes (eg Hondo, Shalako,The Tall Stranger etc) all tended to be cut from the same cloth. Physically, they were described as broad shouldered, lean-hipped, and with angular, ""bony"" faces. Despite their star status, screen charisma and western credentials, very few of the actors selected to portray them (ie John Wayne, Sean Connery, and Joel McCrea) could reasonably have been described as lean-hipped, with angular, bony faces: certainly not the Duke who was always beefy - even in his younger days. For the series, Ralph Taeger is a much closer physical match to L'Amour's Hondo, and he avoids playing the character as a pale imitation of Wayne.  Instead, there are clear echoes of Bogart in there, and it works really well for the laconic and ""bad-tempered"" character. Hondo's canine companion, Sam, is also a much closer equivalent to L'Amour's ugly, yellow cur of a dog, than the dirtied-up collie that accompanied Wayne in 1953. In 1967, it was almost  inevitable that Hondo's fellow scout, Buffalo,  would have been played by either Slim Pickens or Noah Beery Jnr. Pickens was busy doing virtually the same role opposite Wayne Maunder's ""Custer"" at the time, so Beery Jnr got the gig and does well in his own patented style, without emulating or erasing the memory of Ward Bond from the original film. Michael Pate is impressive as always as he reprises his Apache chief Vittorio from the feature film.  The rest of the cast are more than adequate, and there are enough links to the plotline of the Wayne film to make this a very acceptable extension of the story of Hondo Lane.  Some episodes are stronger than others, but make no mistake, all are enjoyable and this is a true adult western: with cowboys, cavalry (good and bad), indians (good and bad), hard riding, hard fighting and the occasional torture scene (often implied more than shown).  This is not one of those saccharine, family-oriented folksy westerns along the lines of so many episodes of Bonanza, Big Valley, High Chaparral and Lancer. It is the genuine article. Add in great location shooting, supplemented but not significantly undermined by indoor sets from time to time) and you have one of the great TV westerns that never achieved the appreciative audience figures that it deserved. If westerns are your thing, give this one a go, it's well worth it.",1497484800,27,3184,4.896103896103896

591820,5,6303192254,"I don't remember much about Hondo when it premiered on ABC on September 8, 1967.  It only lasted for half a season because it was airing opposite Star Trek on NBC and Gomer Pyle USMC on CBS. If Hondo had been scheduled opposite some weaker shows, it might have lasted long enough to catch on with television audiences.

Hondo, the TV series, was created by the legendary Andrew J. Fenady who also created The Rebel, another classic TV Western that starred Nick Adams as Johnny Yuma.

Like Johnny Yuma, Hondo Lane was a former Confederate soldier who drifted West following the Civil War.  There he met and married a beautiful Native American woman who was later killed in a massacre conducted by the US cavalry. This horrifying experience led to Hondo wandering the West with his faithful dog Sam.

There were times when Hondo worked as a scout for the US Army, with the objective of trying to heal the wounds between the Indian Nations and the military. This goal was often met with varying degrees of success.  At other times Hondo dealt with Western themes such as fighting outlaws, fortune hunters, and other spoilers of the frontier.

Hondo was based on the landmark Western novel by Louis L'Amour, and also on the classic John Wayne 1953 hit motion picture.  But Hondo the TV series has a personality all its own. Much of it is easy going with some swatches of humor thrown in.  So everything in this series is not always bleak and bloody.

Ruggedly handsome Ralph Teager is the amazing actor who perfectly portrays the character of Hondo Lane. His sidekick is Buffalo Baker portrayed by the well-seasoned character actor Noah Beery, Jr.

Beery appeared in countless Western motion pictures and television episodes in a very long career.  Both Hondo Lane and Buffalo Baker make a memorable team; and that team, of course, also includes Sam the dog.

This Warner Archive release has been greatly anticipated for years and is long overdue.  But now this obscure, and very entertaining family-friendly series from the 1960's has finally arrived on DVD and is a cause for celebration.  And, best of all, the complete 17 episode series is presented in glorious color.  ABC was the last of the three major television networks to provide 100% color programming in the mid-1960's, and the color production values in Hondo are outstanding.

So grab your hat, put on your buckskin jacket, and saddle up for some good, old fashioned Western adventure. Rest assured Hondo Lane, Buffalo Baker, and a big yellow dog named Sam will see to that.",1496793600,38,2535,4.804147465437788

It never really clicked as a love story, and the Apache Uprising story never took off either, as it was mostly off screen. there wasn't the usual humor you find in Wayne's films, or it was lacking true drama, but either way, it came off as merely an ok viewing experience.

Wayne is enigmatic has Hondo Lane, who stumbles upon a suspicious woman (Geraldine Page as Angie Lowe) who cant tell friend from enemy even when they point it out to her.  She has a son (Lee Aaker as Johnny Lowe) who is in desperate need of a strong role model (he ends up with two).  As with most westerns, theres the expected friction between the US Army Cavalry and (in this case) the Apaches.  As these hostilities are increasing, the military is called in to move local homesteaders to a safe area.  Wagons end up in a circle, there are chases, and shootouts along the way and the ever increasing affections between Mrs. Lowe and Hondo develops rapidly.  James Arness (as Lennie the scout) shows up late as a would-be blackmailer wanting Hondos prized rifle.  Also on hand is the always reliable Ward Bond as Buffalo Baker.

592133,5,6303192254,"""Hondo"" presumably meaning ""bad temper"" in Mescalero, it's no cause for startlement when you see our main man gettin' ornery in a saloon. Hondo Lane (John Wayne) most of the time holds fast to his rule: ""I let people do what they want to do. But there are limits. Hondo is a plain-spoken man, part-Apache and a cavalry scout and a notorious gunman, at ease in his own company. Who knows what he sees in Angie Lowe (Geraldine Page), that homely homesteader's wife whose no-good husband (Leo Gordon) had deserted her some time ago. Well, actually, in frank fashion, Hondo breaks it down to her face what he sees in her. The storyline ain't much, it's to do with Hondo's attempts to keep Mrs. Lowe and her 6-year-old son (Lee Aaker) safe even as the Apache war drums rage in the distance - 's what happens when the White Man goes back on his word and treats a peace treaty like so much snot rag.

1953's HONDO may well be Al Bundy's favorite movie, but, me, I'd like some wiggle room because, even though I really like HONDO, it's probably not even in my top ten favorite John Wayne movies. Another thing what's got going for it, it's based on Louis L'Amour short story, ""The Gift of Cochise,"" that published in Collier magazine way back in 1952, L'Amour being my most preferred western author. The book HONDO is the novelization of the film.

Much of it is a thoughtful character study, and that's when Wayne and Page shine best. By 1953, rumors of Wayne's solid acting chops have been confirmed, what with FORT APACHE (1948), RED RIVER (1948), SHE WORE A YELLOW RIBBON (1949), and THE QUIET MAN (1952) having showcased the Duke's emoting mojo. In HONDO, Wayne holds his own against his method-trained stage acting co-star. The plot evokes a pleasing simplicity that reflects the spirit and temperament of them old pioneering days. Set in New Mexico territory, the cinematography makes great use of the desolate landscapes to create these stark, vivid images, none more memorable than those of the lone scout navigating the hardy terrain. My favorite image surfaces early on as Hondo closes distance on Mrs. Lowe's modest homestead, Hondo all dusty and on foot and tailed by his independent ragamuffin dog.

HONDO abided in my mind for a while after I first saw it. The two leads' acting performances and the arresting visuals were the obvious hooks. But I was also struck with how progressive this movie was for its time. It impressed me that the Chiricahua Apache Chief, Vittorio (Michael Pate), was portrayed so sympathetically and honorably. The action sequences crop up sporadically, but things truly heat up in the thrilling third act. Note that this third act, comprising the all-out Indian attack and circling the wagon sequence, was directed by John Ford as a favor to Duke. The movie's director, John Farrow, faced with warring contractual obligations, had to amscray. It's nice of Ford to refuse credit for his temp gig.

Water cooler talk has it that Geraldine Page did not have a cushy time of it. She had to endure three days of emergency dental work as her teeth were deemed not good enough for close-up shots. John Ford, while visiting the set, remarked how she wasn't good-looking enough for John Wayne to fall in love with. Well, check this out, Page would end up nabbing the movie its sole Oscar nomination, one for the Supporting Actress category. And she deserved it, boy. I love, love the scene in which she tears into Wayne for his being a stickler to his principles, for his willingness to disclose an awful truth to her son because it's the right thing to do. ""You and your silly ideas,"" she scoffs. And then comes the movie's best-delivered line: ""A woman only has the man she married. That's her truth. And if he's no good, that's still her truth."" I tell you, she scorches the screen with that bit of dialogue. Y'know, come to think of it, let me revise. Let me put HONDO in my top ten favorite John Wayne movies. Geraldine Page does justice to her craft, and each time I get to eyeball that scene, I get why Al Bundy was so mad he'd missed catching the movie on TV. After all, it's aired only once every seventeen years. That's a lot of no HONDO.",1464998400,,4173,4.635135135135135

592192,3,6303192254,"Three stars, but a solid three stars.  This movie has some issues.  First of all, there is a white woman (Mrs. Lowe) and her 6 year old son living in Apache territory (Arizona circa 1880) and none of the army scouts have ever heard of them.  And in the movie, she tells John Wayne's character that she has lived there her entire life!  And these Apaches are a bit too nice to a lone white lady and her son.  I wasn't sold on this part of the story.  It was clearly for the purpose of the movie's plot (well, everything is, right?).  But I didn't feel it.  The closing battle scene didn't seem too realistic and overall, the movie was a bit too formulaic and Hollywood.  I also thought it was odd that most of the Apaches didn't have guns, but were charging all over the place with lances (several times throughout the movie).  No doubt, Hondo was pretty good for its time -- 1953.  Overall, I did like the movie, I just wanted to believe it more.

592245,4,6303192254,"When Army dispatch rider Hondo Lane (John Wayne) loses his horse and finds himself seeking a remount at an isolated ranch, he doesn't know that his life is about to change.  The ranch--made viable by the large spring and pool beside which the house is built--is the home of Angie Lowe (Geraldine Page), whose father established it, and her young son Johnny (Lee Aaker, best remembered as ""Rusty B Company"" in ""The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin""); Angie's husband Ed (perennial heavy Leo Gordon) is, as usual, not at home--and, despite her protests to the contrary, Hondo soon sees that he hasn't been for quite some time.  Hondo's no innocent when it comes to women--he once had an Indian wife and loved her dearly, as his reminiscences of her show--but he's not a poacher either; at first all he does is try to persuade the Lowes to leave the ranch and take shelter at the fort from which he rides rather than risk the Apaches.  But Angie and her father before her have always enjoyed good relations with the Indians, and she refuses to go.  Then Chief Vittorio (Michael Pate, who years later played the same role in the short-lived TV series based on the film) presents Angie with an ultimatum: impressed by Johnny's courageous attempt to defend his mother, he makes the boy his blood brother, then declares that it's ""not right for Apache brave to have no father,"" and says she must choose one of his warriors as a husband.  Meanwhile Hondo is forced to kill Lowe and takes from his body a tintype of Johnny--which, when the Apaches capture him and find it, understandably persuades Vittorio that *he* is Lowe, and thereby saves his life, as they drop him off, wounded and exhausted, at the Lowes' house.  Slowly Hondo finds himself bonding with both Angie and Johnny, although Angie's not sure of him--he has a name as a gunman.  But Vittorio keeps his word and leaves the family alone--until he's killed in an engagement with the Army.  Now his successor Silva (Rodolfo Acosta), who has a bone or two to pick with Hondo, decides the gloves are off, and it's up to Hondo, his old friend and fellow scout Buffalo Baker (Wayne's long-time buddy Ward Bond), and rival Lennie (Wayne's protg James Arness, who two years later would find fame as Matt Dillon on ""Gunsmoke"") to save both the brave but inexperienced Lt. McKay (Tom Irish) and a clutch of local settlers from the Apaches' wrath.  Filled with the kind of good interrelationships that drive a story and closely following Louis L'Amour's original (still in print 60-plus years later and available on Amazon), this is one of Wayne's best mid-career movies and one that should be in the collection of everyone who enjoys his work.",1451433600,,2682,4.713675213675214

592346,4,6303192254,"This film has all the elements you could want in a mythic western, along with the people to do it. These have been detailed very well by other reviewers. What it lacks is direction and pacing.

You have two films here: a gently evolving love story and a war. The former feels awkward and proceeds in jumps and starts but perhaps it was meant to and may ring true to many. Everything seems to fall smoothly into place toward the end because John Ford directed that portion of this movie.

High points are Geraldine Page in an odd but wonderful debut for an accomplished stage actor. The other is the soaring main music theme by Hugo Friedhofer, easily the most underappreciated composer in movie history.",1442188800,2,703,4.616

The story of the film's being shot in 3D and 2D, its very short-lived and limited release in 3D theaters and its subsequent absence from the film canon makes this issue particularly welcome. Sound and video are both excellent, with lots of detail in the picture and very clean dialogue on the soundtrack. 5 stars for the excellent extra features that are included on the disc.

I recommend reading the various reviews at BluRay.com, which provide a good overview of the film and its history.

It is interesting to see all the intricacies of these plots coming together to fill in all the developments into the main story.  It is a great offering in Blu-Ray.

593095,4,6303192254,"One of the final 3D films of the ""golden era"" of cinematic 3D, ""Hondo"" is a Western starring John Wayne in the title role. Hondo is an Army dispatch in the Southwest who comes upon a woman and her boy living on a neglected ranch in the wilderness amidst warring Chiricahua Apaches, led by Chief Vittorio (Michael Pate). Why did the woman's husband leave them? Will he ever come back? Why don't the Apaches massacre the mother & son like they do scores of other white settlers? Will she and Hondo fall in love?

Wayne was 45 when the film was shot and was still lean and mean. Geraldine Page is effective as the woman because she lacked typical Hollywood starlet looks and has a sweet feminine spirit. Their relationship arc is well done. Leo Gordon appears as her delinquent husband. Gordon co-starred in ""Gun fury"" with Rock Hudson, which was released the same year and is arguably the better film.

What's most interesting about ""Hondo"" is the significant role the Apaches play in the story and the amount of screen time Vittorio and his subordinate have. With old Westerns like this, this can be either good or bad depending on how authentic the Natives are depicted, but I was somewhat impressed with their portrayal here, especially for a Western from
the early 50s. They appear as wild and potentially dangerous, but to some degree noble. I say ""some degree"" because the story reveals that they've massacred hundreds of white settlers, which - no matter how you slice it - definitely ISN'T noble. Nevertheless, the movie refuses to paint the Indians as all bad. In fact, Hondo has Native blood running through his veins and laments the passing of free-roaming Indians at the end (if they were able to learn to live-and-let-live with the settlers they would've never been put on reservations).

On the downside, certain aspects of the storytelling don't flow well and strike me as boring, which is the case with a lot of old Westerns. On top of this, what happens to Hondo's faithful (but kinda mean) dog is unforgivable. But the two leads, the prominent role of the Apaches, their wild depiction and the magnificent Southwest locations (shot in Chihuahua, Mexico, and Utah) make ""Hondo"" rewarding.

The film is short and sweet at only 83 minutes.

593382,4,6303192254,This is one of the best movies that John Wayne ever made.  A really good story about life in the  old west where men were totally dependent on their skills and what ever weapons they could get.  In this case the Indians were friendly to the western family that had the only water hole within many miles. The Indians took water for themselves and their horses on occasion and for that gift they did not take advantage of that family.  John Wayne fans will like this movie.  I have seen it several times and I recommend it to all.  You will definitely enjoy this movie.,1418860800,,567,4.352380952380952

593389,5,6303192254,The reason that John Wayne's movies are still so popular is because he was a great actor.  When you add the story for Hondo that was written by Louis L'Amour you get one of the best western movies that is always fun to watch.  If you have not seen it before then break out the popcorn and settle in for a fun western movie that you can watch with everyone in the family.

594237,5,6303192254,"This relatively short 1953 film was made in 3D at the late end of the first big 3D craze. The short running time was necessitated by the need to physically change double 3D film reels in the theater for which an intermission was planned. It was a very popular film in its day. Afterwards the film was retired from the public until 1991 when a restored version made a special 3D broadcast for which viewers purchased special Polaroid 3D glasses. The film received a frame by frame digital restoration in 2005 for its DVD release. Now, it's finally here in 2D Blu-ray and it's looking good.

Could it look better? Yes, there's room for improvement but given the limitations of the the. Existing film stock and less than ideal storage, this may be it. The good news is this is the best I've ever seen it on home video -- it's a significant upgrade on the DVD issue. Since it's 2D Blu-ray release the question regarding a 3D release has been answered with unfulfilled rumors. If it happens, It'll be a day one purchase for me. ITM, I'm delighted to have this release. The image and sound quality is very good.

Hondo is a very good, taunt story, well acted with John Wayne in the title role. One of his better roles actually. Geraldine Page, Ward Bond, and James Arness all acquit themselves well in this WarnerColor, 1.85 widescreen film. The film still plays well and holds your interest throughout its length.

Ward Bond also appears in great fashion but no where near the screen time he had in ""The Searchers"".  This movie was premiered in 3D and I believe some of the fun gets lost with out that effect?

594577,3,6303192254,"Hondo, 1953 film

A lone man approaches a water hole. Johnny warns his Mom. The man says he is a dispatch rider who lost his horse. Can he buy another one? The Apaches are restless. Hondo Lane will look at the two horses. [Would there be curtains in this lonely house?] His dog Sam is independent. Most people need someone. [Was that a stunt double?] Honda chose the wilder horse. Johnny learns to not pet a strange dog. Hondo shoes Mrs. Lowe's horses. He advises her to leave with her son, the Apaches are angry because the Whites broke the treaty. Hondo speaks about sensations, like smelling. Night falls, the wind rises. Hondo will sleep inside. He warns against an unloaded pistol in the house. [This dates this film!]

He saddles up the next morning to leave. Hondo talks about his deceased wife. Is character more important than looks? [Usually.] Later Mrs. Lowe finds Apaches in her yard. Her boy is brave, like an Apache boy. The Apaches don their war paint. Hondo arrives at a town. He tells them C troop isn't returning. There is a disagreement in the tavern, ""his name is Lowe"". [Stirrups on an Indian horse?] Mrs. Lowe is offered a choice of husbands, her boy needs a father. Hondo returns to the Lowe ranch. He is followed by two white men, who are attacked by Apaches. Hondo continues to ride until he too is attacked by Apaches. Shots are fired, men fall. Hondo escapes but is pursued and captured! Is he a cougar or a coyote? Hondo will be tortured to death. But a photograph causes a change in plans. There is a duel with knives. [Was this movie originally made in 3D?] Hondo does not lose. The planting rains fall. Hondo is returned to Mrs Lowe (as her husband). The Apaches also return Sam.

When Hondo recovers he offers advice on fishing. Can he teach Johnny to swim? Yes. [Don't try this at home, real life is not a movie.] Vittorio arrives to warn them about a battle. ""I love you"" says Mrs. Lowe to Hondo. A cavalry troop arrives to stay the night. [Is that lieutenant a relative?] They will escort the settlers to safety the next day. One men tells about finding two bodies and admires Hondo's new rifle. [A Winchester `73.] The cavalry troop continues on their mission, they follow orders. [What can settlers raise in this desert land?] Mrs. Lowe learns about Ed's death. She tells Hondo about Ed. The cavalry are retreating, they were beaten in a battle with Vittorio's Apaches. Vittorio was killed, his assurance of safety is no longer valid. The Apaches attack, the cavalry and settlers form a circle. One wagon breaks out successfully. Shots are fired, men fall. Hondo acquires another horse from a man who no longer needs it. The Apaches halt to select a new leader, this lets the cavalry and settlers escape. General Crook will arrive next month with a large force to pacify the Apaches. Hondo and Mrs. Lowe will move to southern California.

This is an interesting movie for its treatment of native Americans. While still shown as an enemy, there is an attempt to humanize them and explain their actions. The classic Westerns often showed how a big landowner wanted to oppress homesteaders. There is no mention of any land grab in this movie, or the reason for the war on the Apaches. Was if over mineral rights or land? Or to protect friendly Indians? Any good history book will tell you more than fictional entertainment.

594820,5,6303192254,"There's a lot of Western packed into this relatively short, 83 minute movie...there are absolutely no wasted scenes; no wasted frames for that matter. Starring a still slender, athletic and young looking John Wayne (he was 47 at the time) and relative unknown, Geraldine Page, in only her second film and first of several Academy Award nominated performances. This was among the first of the ""revisionist"" Westerns, where an attempt was made to tell the real story of the pioneer West, warts and all: realism versus romanticism, stronger roles for women, and a more sympathetic portrayal of Native Americans. You will find all of that in this film and you will find the Duke in one of his best performances as the part-Indian ""breed"", Hondo Lane, who has spent part of his life w/the Apaches and is torn between his life as a white man and his life as an Indian. Page is the quintessential strong frontier woman, who has been abandoned by her weak husband in the midst of Indian territory, with a young son, but perseveres through it all. Page in this film looks like what most pioneer women probably looked like after living a hard life on the frontier; but Wayne's character is strongly attracted to her and there is great on-screen chemistry between them. The Indians (in this case Mescalero Apaches) are portrayed in a refreshingly realistic manner and while the chief, Vittorio, is played by Australian actor, Michael Pate, it is a convincing portrayal and Pate actually looks the part. In addition to Pate, look for some superb support acting from Ward Bond and James Arness. This DVD also has some great special features you'll want to watch involving the making of ""Hondo"", and informational films on the Apaches, Ward Bond and screenwriter, James Edward Grant. A classic Western from an era (the 50s) when many were made...don't miss this one if you like John Wayne and the Western genre. -",1361577600,8,1899,4.828220858895706

594934,5,6303192254,One of the very best.  Hondo captures all the elements that define what we look for in a Western.  Wayne presents a character that embodies a full and rich range of strength and humanity in an environment that challenges everything.  The acting is superb and balanced.,1353196800,,268,4.782608695652174
594935,5,6303192254,"How can anybody resist a western in which John Wayne's character says such a thing to a lady (and, even more important, a married one)? I certainly couldn't. I liked almost everything in this great western, which, all John Wayne's big fan as I am, I discovered only recently.

The story happens in the time of Apache Wars, but history is very much mistreated in this film, so it is not possible to say anything more precise. A half-Indian civilian scout (and a renowned gunfighter) working for US Cavalry, Hondo Lane (John Wayne) is dispatched with a message and after losing his horse is forced to travel alone on foot through Indian territory. There, to his surprise, he discovers an isolated little farm, in which lives a woman, Mrs Angie Lowe (Geraldine Page) and her six years old son, who seem to be left alone by the overwise extremely aggressive and cruel Apaches commanded by Vittorio. This film describes a surprisingly complex romance which will ultimately develop between Hondo Lane and this mysterious married woman, when in the same time all around rages a murderous, merciless war...

The dialogs are the greatest treasure of this film. John Wayne's rough and tough as nails character delivers pearl after pearl, in principle very seriously but in fact with tons of humour. Geraldine Page plays magistrally a very civilised and gentle woman suffering in an extremely unhappy marriage and inexorably attracted by the forbidden fruit personalized by the taciturn and straight speaking ""barbarian"" who used to live long years amongst ""savages"" and even was married to an Indian woman - and who is widely known for having killed many men in gunfights (and knifefights)...

Dialogs between John Wayne and his best friend, another civilian scout named Buffalo, are also great. Even better are exchanges between Mrs Lane and Indian chief Vittorio, who tries to marry her to one of his braves, as he hates to see a ""good woman wasted"" by living without a man...

The weaker thing in this film is the portraying of the Apache and the violence made to history.

This film being an adaptaion of a bestselling western novel, the Apache are portrayed here with all the cliches necesseary to this kind of works - they always capture alive people who killed many of them and then they always give them a chance to fight for their lives, and therefore a chance to kill even more of them... Although being essentially warlike early neolithic farmers in transition from nomadic paleolithic hunters-gatherers (and therefore very behind their times), the XIX century Apache were certainly not stupid - in fact they were very pragmatic people and in time of war any captured white settler or soldier would never receive any second chance, but would be slowly tortured to death, for the amusement of braves... And a single white woman found on their territory would be simply gang raped and then tortured to death, or, if she was really lucky, taken away as slave/concubine - but certainly never left in peace...

It is also good to remind that the real famous Chiricauha Apache chief was called Victorio (and not Vittorio) and his real fate was to die in a fight against Mexican Army (very different from what happens in the film). Also, general Crook cited all the time in this film was in reality nowhere near Apache territory in times of Victorio War (1879-80) - in real history American commander who fought Victorio was general Sheridan. Finally, the character of Vittorio in the film is almost a kind of a white knight - when in reality he ruthlessly slaughtered dozens of American and Mexican civilians and he earned a particularly nightmarish reputation with the infamous Alma massacre...

But those weaker points notwithstanding, watching this film and especially the wonderful interactions between John Wayne's and Geraldine Page's characters was such a pleasure, that I simply can not give to this western less than five stars. Enjoy!",1351123200,,3939,4.932126696832579

It was a big deal, and being a kid who loved Westerns, I begged my dad to take me to 7-11 where they were selling the 3D glasses. Well, the big night came and I loved Hondo! After that, I didn't see it again until its recent release on Blu-ray. This is a great Wayne film! I had forgotten much of the movie in the twenty-plus years since I had seen it, so it was basically like watching it for the first time. The picture looks great, and the sound is better than it had been in past home video editions (I saw two or three minutes of it on DVD once, and the sound was not so great).

As for the film itself, the story moves along at a brisk pace and is never boring. There are shoot-outs, chases, plenty of suspense, and even a knife fight! Even though I just bought and watched my Blu-ray a few weeks ago, I already want to see this film again!

The movie is very clean and is suitable for almost all ages (I have no problem with my seven year old son watching it). As a bonus we get an introduction by the always wonderful Leonard Maltin. In addition, there is a commentary track with Maltin and Frank Thompson (Frank has a very good podcast called The Commentary Track that fans of classic films should love-look it up!).

594987,5,6303192254,"I know some of the purest hate the Blu-Ray release because of it being released in Widescreen, and I do understand their point of view. I do feel they should have released both versions Blu-Ray certainly has the room for it and I am sure they already had a usable print of the film they could have used so I don't understand the decision not to include both. However, I already own the DVD of this great movie and I found the Blu-Ray to be well worth the purchase the picture in comparison to the DVD in my opinion it looks amazing, and I thought the DVD already looked pretty good. Again for me the upgrade in picture and sound on Blu-Ray was well worth it to me. I know some of the picture is missing and for some they can't get past that, but with this being the 1:85 ratio I didn't really notice. To me I really notice the picture loss the most going from a movie shot with an aspect ratio of 2:35 being shown in Pan n Scan and it would drive me crazy and bug me so I do get it. And if I did a side by comparison with 2 screens running each version yes I could probably tell the difference, but for me with Hondo I honestly couldn't tell what I was missing so for me it didn't distract or take away the enjoyment of the movie.  I know some folks disagree, but this is just my opinion and 2cents:) For me Hondo rates a 5 star for not only being a great movie, but for also a great Blu-Ray release. Bob

""I stand corrected I just read several reviews and one by Gretchen Wayne clearly states Hondo was originally shot in 1:85."" This explains why I didn't notice any loss of information, and I still disagree with those who think the picture looks crowded, blurred and out of focus due to quote stretching. I think the picture and the sound look amazing a clear upgrade from the DVD. Yes, it's not perfect, but for a movie shot in the 50's it looks really good! It still amazes me how they can take a movie as old as Hondo and restore it to the point of looking almost as good or better than when it was originally released. I know my opinion is just one of many, but it's mine nevertheless and maybe it will help someone with their purchasing decision. Bob",1339804800,10,2158,4.147971360381861
594988,3,6303192254,"The Weary Professor is right. I'm no western movie expert, as evidenced by the fact that I rank Hondo just below The Searchers in John Wayne's western canon. Some of the exchanges between Wayne and Paige are the most memorable ever to appear in cowboy cinema, and Sam the dog stands as one of the more memorable devices ever used to define a main character. That said, the film was compromised during shooting by the unfortunate 3-D process, which results in one shot being razor sharp and the next being out of focus, alternating throughout. It makes Hondo a bigger challenge to bring to Blu than How The West Was Won turned out to be, and, unfortunately, they blew it.

There was never going to be any cure for blurred 3-D compositions, but having just viewed the Blu-Ray, I don't think this film really was composed for widescreen. It may have been composed in such a way that widescreen projection was possible, but seen in that aspect ratio the compositions are obviously crowded and cramped. The lost vertical information in this case includes necessary head room and landscape that feels 'missing', and figures cut off distractingly around elbow height, leading to a claustrophobic experience. Westerns are often the best argument in favour of widescreen presentation, restoring the grandeur of landscape vistas lost in pan and scan vhs transfers, but in this instance the top and bottom information we have lost to the imposition of a matte letterbox is absolutely as destructive. Those who continue to take issue with the Weary Professor's opinion on this matter should get out their old fullscreen dvds and simply have a look: I don't think there's any doubt that what we've been given here is a badly compromised Blu-ray that cries out for a replacement edition. The proof is that THE COMPOSITIONS LOOK BAD in widescreen, and look right in full frame. And given the amount of space available on a Blu-Ray, there's no excuse for the fullscreen print not having been made available on the same disc. We've lost picture, but not only that, by zooming the image we've lost resolution, the latter being something this movie really can't afford.

In short, you aren't alone Professor. This release is a screw-up, and a bad one. I love widescreen, but this new trend toward shoehorning everything into widescreen just to fit our new TVs is every bit as destructive as the old practice of shearing the periphery of prints in order to get them to fit our old TVs. The fact is, in this case, rather than cutting out the grandeur of the vista, they've crowded the sky out over John Wayne's head. The effect is the same: to shrink the wide open spaces, and it really hurts the experience here. The framing is so tight that if the letterbox were any narrower the disc would go from disappointing to unwatchable.",1339459200,4,2809,4.777777777777778
594989,2,6303192254,"this is a review of the DVD and not the film. I don't think I could add any more to what has already been said about one of John Wayne's best but seldom seen films until it was released on video. It was made in 3D in 1953 before movies were made in wide screen. I was really looking forward to the blu-ray release. Unfortunately, they letterboxed a movie that was not made in wide screen. They simply cut the bottom and top of the picture off. If you have seen the film as it was meant to be seen you can tell. Starting in 1956 the studios told their dirctors that if they were going to shoot a film in standard 1.33 to 1 ration that their movies would be cropped in the theaters and to shoot their films accordingly. This lead to a number of films having some dead space at the top or bottom of the film. manyd films such as ""Support Your Local Sheriff"" and ""The Devil at 4 O'Clock"" were filmed that way. Hondo was made before this practice was started. For me this is unforgivable and I will be returning my blu-ray. This is the same as releasing a widescreen movie in pan and scan.",1339113600,5,1084,4.14218009478673

One of John Wayne's best movies has at long last been released in 1080p and returned to it's glory as such a classic deserves. Originally filmed in the 50's 3D format this blu-ray brings out a wondrous depth of field that simply could not be seen in older formats. Even in 2D the opening titles seem to jump off the screen. Having said that there are some scenes that seem somewhat more blurry than others. Maybe it is due to the then 3D process, I don't know, but maybe someone who is more familiar with the process at that time could explain. Most of the scenes are sharp and the color is brilliant as one might expect from a major movie studios (Paramount/WB)release of a timeless classic such as this is. It's grand entertainment that simply is not made any more. Like ""The Searchers"" it is a proud addition to my library.

595043,4,6303192254,"Action-packed John Wayne western receives a Blu-Ray release that debuts, for the first time on home video, a proper widescreen presentation of ""Hondo.""

Wayne plays a half-Indian Cavalry rider named Hondo who finds himself playing guardian angel to a frontierswoman (Geraldine Page, who garnered an Oscar nomination here in her first film role) whose husband has left her and their young son alone to fend for themselves in the New Mexico desert, where warring Apaches roam the landscape. Wayne favorite John Edward Grant adapted a Louis L'Amour story for this effective western, efficiently directed by John Farrow, with Ward Bond, Michael Pate and James Arness appearing in supporting roles.

Out of circulation for many years, ""Hondo"" was originally shot in 3-D but hasn't reportedly been screened in its native format in years. While it's disappointing that Paramount's Blu-Ray edition isn't in 3-D, ""Hondo"" nevertheless makes an impressive debut in high-definition despite highly varied elements. When the image is at its best, the transfer is spectacular, offering strong colors and fine grain. There are stretches of the picture, however, where the image is notably blurry and seemingly processed with noise reduction, likely a response to opticals and/or damaged source materials. That said, despite its occasional visual discrepancies, the image is exceptionally good on balance. The audio, meanwhile, is much less distinguished, being presented in either a 5.1 Dolby TrueHD track that sounds too airy and lacks power, or a superior 2.0 Dolby TrueHD mono track that enhances the dialogue. The score, credited to Emil Newman and Hugo Friedhofer, comes off well, but there's a thinness to the dialogue that makes the 5.1 track in particular quite unappealing.

A variety of insightful features are carried over from Paramount's prior DVD Special Edition, with an introduction from Leonard Maltin, commentary with Maltin and fellow Wayne experts, multiple featurettes and an HD trailer included. The original Intermission sequence has been retained as well.",1337644800,6,2063,5.460815047021944

It's a pretty typical L'Amour story, which is to say a good western adventure. Geraldine Page plays Angie Lowe, a wife who has been abandoned by her no-good husband, but refuses to accept that he won't come back. Her young son, Johnny, likes Hondo at once when he stops at their remote ranch to get some water and a horse after loosing his running from Apaches. Mrs. Lowe finds this hard to understand, because her family has always gotten along with the Apaches.

Vittorio, the Apache warrior who shows up next, explains that the whites have violated the treaty, and threatens Mrs. Lowe. But Johnnie, only six, stands up to them bravely, and Vittorio makes him a blood brother, calls him Small Warrior, and agrees to protect him and Mrs. Lowe.

How Hondo meets and eventually kills Mr. Lowe, helps the cavalry hold off the Apaches, and wins the heart of Angie, is a nice story but not all that unusual. One interesting side-line in the story is the dog Sam, who travels with Hondo but is independent of him.",1337385600,,1136,4.563725490196078

A typical John Wayne movie, full of action, some romance, adventure and some sadness. Also shows that the Indians were just as human as the White Establishment, of that time. I am so glad that I bought it and added it to my, not only collection of good Western movies, but my John Wayne collection as well. ""The Special Features"" was good on this DVD also. The little boy in this movie, tells of his (Lee Aaker) experience of working on this movie with John Wayne. Also, is very detailed of how the Apache people were treated when Geronimo surrendered. It is heartbreaking to know how the Native American Indians were and are treated, even today. The Apache and The Lakota Sioux tribes were the ones who fought so valiantly to keep their land and way of life, only to be demorialized by the white people who wanted to exterminate them. Change their whole lives because the white people wanted them to be what ""they"" thought they should be. It makes me quite Happy today to see that the Native American Tribes are relearning their own language and customs once again.

595094,3,6303192254,"""Hondo"" is a 1953 3-D western. Westerns were extremely popular at the time, and 3-D was the studio's answer to the challenge of TV. The ""golden era"" of 3-D started with Bwana Devil in 1952 and ""House of Wax"" followed. Even Disney produced a 3-D cartoon (""Melody"") and the first 3-D western was released by Columbia (""Fort Ti""). 3-D faded as quickly as it began, and Hondo was also released in the 2-D version. You'll notice, when watching the film, that many of the scenes cater to the 3-D experience, including being stabbed by a knife and stuck with a lance.

Hondo stars John Wayne with Geraldine Page, Ward Bond, Michael Pate, James Arness, and Paul Fix.

Wayne was a major box office draw at the time, having appeared in such hits as ""Stagecoach"" (1939), ""They Were Expendable"" (1944), ""Fort Apache"" (1948), ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"" (1949), ""Rio Grande"" (1950), and ""Flying Leathernecks"" (1951). He was nominated for Best Actor for ""Sands of Iwo Jima"" (1949). ""Hondo"" was Wayne's 135th film.

""Hondo"" was made at a time that Wayne was feeling his oats as an actor and a producer. He formed Batjac in 1952 and ""Big Jim McLain"" was his first film, made with Warners. Hondo followed shortly thereafter, and among Batjac's Wayne films were ""Cahill"" (1973), ""Big Jake"" (1971), ""McClintock"" (1963), ""The Green Berets"" (1968),  ""McQ"" (1974) and the only really good Batjac film, ""The Alamo"" (1960). Batjac also did the 1967 TV series ""Hondo"" in which Michael Pate resurrected his role as Chief Vittorio, and Batjac made several non-Wayne films like ""Cast a Giant Shadow"" (1966) with Wayne's buddy Kirk Douglas and ""Seven Men From Now"" (1956) with his friend and occasional co-star Gail Russell. ""Seven Men"" was originally intended for Wayne, but he was too busy and substituted Randolph Scott: together with Budd Boetticher, Scott made a whole slew of memorable B westerns in the 50s.

Hondo comes at a time when artistically Wayne was at his peak. Some of his finest films were made at  this time, including ""The Quiet Man"" (1952), ""The High and the Mighty"" (1954), and ""The Searchers"" (1956).

Geraldine Page made her screen debut in this film. She had been a popular stage actress, famous for working in ""the method"" and trained by Lee Strasberg. Just prior to making Hondo she appeared with James Dean on Broadway. For her work she would receive an Oscar nomination as ""Best Supporting Actress"", the only nomination the film would earn.

Ward Bond plays a scout and long time friend of Wayne. Bond was a football player at USC with Wayne, and together they appeared in nearly a dozen films including ""They Were Expendable"" (1945), ""Fort Apache"" (1948), ""3 Godfathers"" (1948), ""The Searchers"" (1956), ""Wings of Eagles"" (1957), and ""Rio Bravo"" (1959). Without Wayne, Bond was also a staple in John Ford's stock company and appeared in ""Young Mr. Lincoln"" (1939), ""Drums Along the Mohawk (1939)"", ""My Darling Clementine"" (1946), and ""The Grapes of Wrath (1940) among the 25 films they made together. He's probably best remembered for his role as Major Seth Adams on the TV series ""Wagon Train"" (1957 - 1961), based on the 1950 film ""Wagon Master"" in which he appeared (along with James Arness). Bond was in more  Top 100 AFI films (7) than any other actor, and appeared in 11 films that were nominated as Best Picture.

James Arness was Marshall Dillon on TV's ""Gunsmoke"" from 1955 to 1975 and subsequently has returned every so often for various Gunsmoke TV movies. Before he put on the star for Dodge City, Arness was a film actor, appearing most notably as the monster in ""The Thing"" (1951). He got his big break from John Wayne who cast him in four films in the early 50s. In fact, the original role as Marshall Dillon was offered to Wayne who turned it down and suggested Arness.

Paul Fix is best remembered as the Marshall in the TV series ""The Rifleman"" (1958 - 63), but he made more than 100 films and appeared on hundreds of TV shows. Fix was a teaching coach for the young Wayne and Wayne included him in 26 of his films, including ""Big Jim McCain"" (1952), ""Island in the Sky"" (1953), ""High and the Mighty"" (1954), ""The Sea Chase"" (1955), ""El Dorado"" (1966), and ""Cahill"" (1973).

Michael Pate appears as an Indian chief. Born in Australia, Pate was a busy actor who made more than 50 films. His role as an Indian in Hondo was his first entry into this character, but it soon followed with many more such roles, including a spot on the TV series made in the 60s. Later in his career Pate was very busy in TV, appeared in more than 300 shows, often as a villain.

Lee Aaker plays Page's son. Aaker is best remembered as Rusty from the TV show ""Rin Tin Tin"" (1954 - 9). At the time of ""Hondo"" he was a busy child actor with roles in ""The Greatest Show on Earth"" (1952), ""High Noon"" (1952), ""Atomic City"" (1952), and ""A Lion is in the Streets"" (1953). After his TV series he had trouble getting adult roles and retired from acting.

John Farrow directs. Farrow was the father of actress Mia Farrow with Margaret O'Sullivan (Jane from the Tarzan films). Farrow was twice nominated for an Oscar, winning for ""Around the World in 80 Days"" (1956) and nominated for ""Wake Island"" (1942). Farrow worked with Wayne again in 1955 on ""The Sea Chase""

The film will not disappoint John Wayne fans, and in fact it is one of his more romantic roles with lots of passionate kissing, a rare event in most Wayne films, especially in Wayne westerns. The photography is excellent although the action sequences are not impressive.",1282435200,8,5521,4.68904958677686

595096,5,6303192254,"If you've seen ""The Searchers,"" then John Wayne's portrayal of Hondo Lane will remind you in some ways of Ethan Edwards, the angry, ""racist"" lead character in his later, better-known movie.

 But they're different -- ""Hondo"" gives its own spin on life in the Old West, unlike the latter movie of Wayne's. Ethan Edwards of ""The Searchers"" is an enraged, hating man; Hondo Lane is calmer, more observant of life in general, given to wise, laconic comments about how to survive as a loner in the West to Geraldine Page's well-meaning but often flighty ranch wife, who is ultimately his love interest in the film.

 Ethan Edwards knew the Indians and their ways, and hated them. Hondo Lane knows the Indians and their ways -- he is candid about being part-Indian himself -- and makes no secret of his respect for them. As a result, the Apaches who menace the settlers and fight the Cavalry in ""Hondo"" are portrayed more sympathetically, and with more nuances, than Edwards' despised Comanches. On the other hand, ""Hondo"" tends to idealize the Indians as ""noble savages"" -- Hondo Lane claims in a couple of scenes that the Apaches never lie. In ""The Searchers,"" one might say, the Comanches are at least portrayed as more human and flawed.

 Edwards had no pets that we are made aware of -- but Hondo has Sam. That is, Sam consents to travel with him. The fiercely independent, don't-pet-me-or-I'll-bite-you dog, who forages for his own food (I don't need no humans to feed me!), tags along with Hondo, once drowning an Indian who had tried to kill his human friend. The film resists the temptation to have Hondo grieve or sentimentalize when Sam is speared and killed later by another Indian. This seems harsh on first viewing -- but wait. Hondo has made it clear that he is an unsentimental, practical loner who takes care of himself. Sam was the same way. Now Sam is gone, and Hondo doubtless hurt for him in his innermost soul. But we are shown no manifestation of it. Somehow, that's the way it should be in this Western.

 The action sequences in ""Hondo"" are even better than those in the later, longer ""The Searchers."" Wayne appears to have done a lot of -- but not all of -- his own stunts in ""Hondo."" But he was three years younger than when he made ""The Searchers"".

 Last but not least there is Ward Bond, playing Hondo's long-time trail pal. Bond portrayed only one part -- if you've seen one movie with him, you've seen all his roles -- but he played it superbly. Also, look for a very young James Arness in a small but key speaking role; a year or two later he would rocket to TV fame as Matt Dillon in ""Gunsmoke."" Wayne reportedly helped him to land the plum role.

 ""Hondo"" is an exceptional Western which never got the attention it deserved because the same year, Alan Ladd made ""Shane."" Here's your chance to see it for the first time, 56 years after it was made. It's well worth it.",1259539200,6,2896,4.558766859344894
595097,5,6303192254,"Most other John Wayne westerns show the Indians as faceless attackers. Not this one! Cavalryman Hondo Lane (John Wayne), himself part Apache, has a working relationship with one of the Apache chiefs. He alludes to the fact that the US government had broken a treaty with the Apaches.

Hondo gets to know a solitary-living pioneer woman, Angie Lowe, and her six year-old son Johnny. The absence of her husband leads to problems, such as an Apache chief wanting to take her as his wife. At one point, the six year-old shoots an Apache in defense of his mother. The plot unfolds in more ways than one, as Hondo and Angie develop feelings for each other, and Hondo has to acknowledge what he knows about her husband's death. For her part, she has to realize the fact that the Apaches will soon kill her if she does not flee, and deal with the fact that her husband had been a lout and cheat, and how her little son is to remember his father. Dying an honorable death is paramount in that culture.

There are several savage battles shown between the Apaches and the settlers. Only the death an Apache leader will cause the Apache warriors to disperse.

WARNING: Some of the scenes are quite violent, even by the standard of westerns, which may upset sensitive viewers. There is a scene of Hondo's faithful dog impaled by a pole.

595149,4,6303192254,"Thirty years after his death, John Wayne remains an enigma. Many books have been written about him, none of which I've read, and so I know little of his personal life other than he has been both praised for embodying traditional American ideals and reviled for his archconservative bigotry.

Yet he remains today perhaps this country's biggest movie star. Today's actors - Tom Hanks, Russell Crowe, Liam Neeson, Jack Nicholson - are more accomplished actors with greater range; while from Wayne's era, Clark Gable was more handsome, James Cagney more talented, Jimmy Stewart and Henry Fonda more eclectic. But for sheer screen charisma, I can't think of another actor from any era who brings more to the screen. Whenever Wayne is onscreen the viewer is simply compelled to watch him. Often described as ruggedly handsome, his face isn't particularly expressive. Some of his mannerisms, particularly his walk and some of his posturing, one suspects are contrived, yet a generation of men in the 40s and 50s aspired to be just like him. Heck, I knew some women in the 60s who patterned themselves after the Duke.

In Hondo, based on a Louis L'Amour novel and directed by John Farrow, Wayne plays a half-breed Apache. His sidekick is Sam, a dog as surly as Hondo. Hondo befriends Angie Lowe, a New Mexican farmwoman and mother of a young son whose husband deserts her for extended periods of time. Geraldine Page is well-cast as the ""handsome"" Angie, and was nominated for an Oscar for her first starring role, despite a performance that can best be described as wooden. Character actor Ward Bond and a young James Arness ably lend support.

Setting aside the rather clich depiction of the Apache and several historical inaccuracies, Hondo can perhaps best be described as a morality play, a study of the power of lies and when, or if, it is beneficial to tell one. Hondo laments the lies the white man tells the Apache and tells Angie that the Apache language contains no word for ""lie."" Page's soliloquy on the subject of lies - those she endured at the tongue of her husband as well as those she told herself - near the end of the movie is a telling moment. Although delivered somewhat mechanically, the words speak for themselves.

595153,4,6303192254,"For 1953 Hondo was a brutal portrayal of the West. Hondo was based on a Louis L'Amour novel, in fact, it was the first novel that L'Amour had published & was also his first property to be transformed to the silver screen. The film was directed by John Farrow (father of Mia) & shot in Mexico. The screenplay was written by James Edward Grant, Wayne's favorite screenwriter.

Hondo is a Western much in the classic vein but with an added realism that was unusual for 1953. In the opening scene we see Hondo (John Wayne) walking toward the camera, rifle in one hand, scabbard & saddlebags in the other hand. Near him is the dog, Sam, basically a wild dog who is in the company of Hondo. He happens on a ranch that has only Angie Lowe (Geraldine Page) & her son Johnny (Lee Aker). Hondo is a scout for the cavalry & is returning to to report on the state of the Apaches who are preparing for war. Hondo stays around the ranch for a short period fixing up things for her. It's obvious to Hondo that Mrs. Lowe's husband hasn't been around for a long time. She continually lies about her husband but Hondo, straigt forward & honest, tells her she's lying. Later, Hondo meets Ed Lowe (Leo Gordon) & they take an immediate disliking to one another. Later Hondo kills Lowe in self-defense. This complicates things because Hondo & Mrs. Lowe end up falling in love.

All of this is set against the backdrop of an Apache uprising & the Lowe ranch is in the middle of it. She has been on peaceful terms with them but Hondo warns her it's time for her & her son to leave. She chooses to stay. The Apache chief Vittorio (Michael Pate) is a significant role in the movie. He befriends Johnny renaming him Small Warrior. Vittorio wants Mrs. Lowe to pick one of the Apache warriors for a husband so that Johnny can be taught the Apache way. The movie features Ward Bond as Buffalo Baker, a scout like Hondo. James Arness has a small role as Lennie, another scout whom Hondo doesn't like. It all leads to the inevitable cowboy & Indian showdown.

Some of this was shot in 3D but it's a very minuscule part. The movie has an introduction by Leonard Maltin who also appears in the rest of the special features. There's a feature entitled The Making of Hondo that features interviews with Michael Pate, Lee Aaker & western historian Frank Thompson. This feature reveals that the final parts filmed of Hondo were actually directed by John Ford. There's a feature on the writer James Edward Grant. There is an interview with Michael Wayne that reveals material from the vaults of Batjac, Wayne's production company. There are a couple of other features that makes this a great value.",1215907200,2,2659,4.50103519668737

595156,5,6303192254,"This had been among one of the least seen of Wayne's best films because it had been locked away for a decade and a half.  I remember the ""Married With Children"" episode when Al wanted to catch a rare showing of this movie and, of course, his desires were thwarted.  Now you can see it any time you wish on this really good DVD.  The extras provide a good commentary on the film, some shorts on the making of the film and on Ward Bond.

The film has a couple of really different aspects to it.  The most famous is that it was made in 3D, which was a big fad the year it was made.  This version of 3D was more sophisticated than the red-green glasses we get every now and again today, but I have never experienced this technology and have no idea what it is like.  For this film, very few people have seen it in 3D because it was only shown that way for the first week or two it was in very limited release.  The rest of the world saw it as it is presented on this DVD, in beautifully presented 2D.  One of the reasons this 3D film still works so well in 2D is that despite all the problems of filming in 3D (and they are explained in the extras), Farrow and Wayne only have a couple of concessions to the usually 3D gimmickry (the titles, the knife fight coming right at the camera, an arrow being shot, and maybe a couple of others).  Most of the time the extras explain that they used 3D to add depth to the shots which still work well when flattened.

The other odd part of Hondo is casting Geraldine Page as the female lead.  She isn't particularly beautiful and in some way this makes her more believable.  We learn some things about her from the other cast members that add to the strangeness.  Apparently, she went to great lengths to stay in character including not bathing or brushing her teeth.  She was also very liberal and appalled by the conservative views of John Wayne and Ward Bond.  All this aside, what gets on the screen is very good and quite convincing.  That she was nominated for an Oscar(tm) for this role does seem a bit odd today, but not completely crazy.

The story is set in Apache lands when the whites have yet again broken a treaty and the Indians are pushing back.  Hondo (Wayne) walks into Angie Lowe's (Page) ranch where she lives alone with her son, Johnny (Lee Aaker).  She won't leave her ranch even though the Army is evacuating all whites living in the Apache lands because too many are being killed.  She claims her husband will return soon, but Hondo is suspicious.  In return for a horse, Hondo does many domestic chores that need doing around the ranch.  One of the more famous scenes is his teaching Johnny how to swim and then finds out Angie can't swim either.  He and Angie quickly develop a strong affection, but she is married after all so he leaves and heads into town to report to the military.  He meets Angie's husband in the local saloon and learns that he is not what Angie portrayed him to be.  In fact, he has betrayed and abandoned her and is an all around bad individual.  Wayne's friend, Ward Bond, also has a very good role in the film as Buffalo Baker.

I won't bother explaining how the plot develops, but there is a lot of interesting action with surprisingly sensitive plot developments.  The Indians are presented very sensitively for 1953 and we sympathize with them (except when they are after Hondo).  Their chief, Vittorio, is played quite convincingly by the Australian actor, Michael Pate.  The key action sequences at the end were, we learn from the extras, directed by John Ford and they are quite good.  This is a very good Waynestern and you should see it.  And if you have seen it recently, well, find an excuse to enjoy it again!

Lane is received by a young courageous frontier woman Angie Lowe (Geraldine Page) and her 6-years old son Johnny (Lee Aaker). Angie tries to convince Hondo that she is not alone, that she lives with a husband, and that she is not worried about apache uprisings, because there is a peace treaty, and the apaches will not ""bother"" her at all...

During his 24 hours stay, Lane knows that Annie is an abandoned woman, and after kissing her, he learned much more...

Lane leaves the place, but after finding out that the Indians are killing and destroying all around the land, decides to return for the young woman and her boy...

Under the lead of a stylistic director, ""Hondo"" may be very likely the finest Wayne psychological Western not directed by John Ford... With long tracking shots and interesting camera angles, ""Hondo"" is far better in the way of capturing the abrasive solitary man manifested in ""Red River."" There is nothing really surprising about Wayne's part, but I think it does stress something that's a real Wayne attribute, and that is his honesty and straight forwardness...

With a kind of short, curly, blonde hair, Geraldine Page is excellent in her Oscar-Nominated debut, specially in the scene of her confession to Lane about her late husband: 'He was a liar, a thief, a coward and a drunker... He only married me to get the ranch.'

This movie contains classic Western scenes - like the horse chase scene where Honda tries to outrun the Apaches, or the final battle scene where the Army ""circles the wagons"" to defend against the vicious attack. The characters are memorable, and the dialogue is quite entertaining. John Wayne is perfect for the role of Hondo. His real man approach to problems is refreshing.

Many other reviewers have provided the plot details. Needless to say the story is entertaining, and even includes a love story subplot. I highly recommend this class movie to any John Wayne fan, or those who like Westerns from the 50s. You will enjoy this one.",1159142400,2,956,4.823170731707317
595275,5,6303192254,"John Wayne stars as Hondo Lane, a half-Indian message carrier and gunslinger in New Mexico. He first shows up at the ranch of Mrs. Angie Lowe after getting away from Apache attackers. This takes place in the ending days of the ""Indian round-up"" years, when only a few bands of Apache were left. Hondo takes a liking to Angie and her young son, but soon heads out to deliver the message.

In the meantime, the Apache have always been fond of Mrs. Lowe and had a good relationship with her - and the chief takes a personal interest in her son. He tries to convince Angie to choose a new husband from amongst his braves. She insists that her husband will be back soon to stay on the remote ranch with her.

Hondo runs into the wayward husband in a bar, only learning his name after punching him out. In an attempt to get the husband back to his wife, Hondo takes the man's horse and says that Mr. Lowe can retrieve it at the ranch. Angry, Lowe pays a guy to go with him after Hondo. Apaches attack and kill the paid bodyguard, and Hondo shoots an Apache to save Lowe's life. Lowe repays Hondo by attempting to shoot him in the back. Hondo is forced to kill him. He takes Lowe's tintype of Lowe's son to bring back to the mom.

Along the way, the Apaches find Hondo and are about to torture him to death when the Apache chief recognizes the tintype. Hondo still has to fight - and triumph over - the brother of the Apache he killed. The Apache chief brings Hondo back to Mrs. Lowe, who claims Hondo as her husband in order to get him in away from the Apaches. Hondo tries several times to tell Angie what happened, but each time she doesn't want to hear it. She does end up hearing the truth from someone else, but when Hondo then attempts to tell the boy, Angie refuses to let him do it. She scolds Hondo that his need for the truth is so great that he'd damage the boy's sense of well being and security to achieve it.

The movie is a rather complex story, based almost exactly on the story by Louis L'Amour. John Wayne loved the story so much that he specifically hired a favorite script writer to adapt it into a movie for him. It was filmed to be watched in 3D, so there are several scenes with knives poking at the screen and people standing in the foreground. You might think this would make the movie look cheesy, but really you're normally lost in the storyline or the gorgeous landscapes.

This movie came out in 1953 and for an era that saw many ""slaughter the Indians"" movies, it's pretty impressive in its even handedness. Angie likes the Apaches and has been friends with them since childhood. Hondo is a half Indian, and had an Apache wife while he lived with them for 5 years. You get treated to many scenes with Apaches speaking in their native Apache tongue. Hondo makes it pretty clear that the only reason that the Apache are rising up are that the US government has been actively deceiving them and betraying them. He explains that the Apache are very much against lying, and that he is the same way.

Compared to many other westerns, this does a reasonably good job of showing shades of grey, not just 'Good' and 'Bad'. The Apaches were pushed into the war, but they're prepared to kill an innocent woman who has lived on this land from birth. The settlers are sometimes obnoxious about their desire to get rid of the ""natives"". In the end, Hondo says that he imagines this will be the end of the Apache way of life, and that it's a shame.",1152662400,75,3457,4.327160493827161

595278,5,6303192254,"It was altogether appropriate that John Wayne should make a film in the briefly popular stereoscopic process that Hollywood adopted in the early 1950's to compete with television...and it's all the more appropriate that the one 3-D film he made was a western.  Of course, the popularity of 3-D only lasted about a year and by the time this film was released (in late 1953) it was only shown in 3-D in a few theaters; most people saw it in conventional 35 milimeter.

Anyone who has seen surviving 3-D prints of such films, including this writer, can attest to their incredible visual impact, particularly the ones that didn't rely on the usual gimmicks of throwing or pointing things at the cameras. ""Hondo"" has a few instances of pointing knives or guns at the cameras, but the film generally avoids the gimmicks that may have contributed to the demise of the 3-D fad.  Of course, there were always those who complained about having to wear special glasses to watch 3-D movies.

Overall, this is very impressive production throughout.  It is tightly paced and has numerous exciting scenes, along with more tender and even humorous moments.  Based on a Louis L'Amour story, adapted by John Wayne's longtime friend James Edward Grant, this is one of the more intriguing westerns that Wayne made.  Director John Farrow, actress Mia Farrow's father, was able to keep things moving during the film's 83 minutes.

One of the more remarkable aspects is that the film is more sympathetic toward Native Americans than in most films of the time, perhaps because John Wayne's character is admittedly part Apache.  One is intrigued and even amused to discover that the Indian chief is played by an Australian actor, Michael Pate, but makeup and his effective acting make his portrayal effective and believable.  Pate is among the living actors interviewed for ""The Making of Hondo,"" one of the special features included on this DVD.  He recalls the decision to cast him as the chief and his own amazement that it worked.

Filmed mostly in the the state of Chihuahua in Mexico, the color photography is vivid and impressive.  One marvels at the fact that Warner Brothers was using the bulky, cumbersome stereoscopic cameras, which often had to be hand-carried by several men from location to location.

John Wayne produced the film through the company that he named Batjac, enjoying a good business arrangement with the legendary Jack Warner.  Leonard Maltin, known for his books on Hollywood and regular appearances on ""Entertainment Tonight,"" notes in his excellent introduction that Warner believed that ALL movies should be made in 3-D.  Given the periodic return of films in 3-D and the realistic effects of such productions, this writer has often thought that it would be a good idea to continue making films with the stereoscopic process.

The film features appearances by two of John Wayne's closest friends, Ward Bond and James Arness.  John Wayne and Ward Bond played football at the University of Southern California and were discovered by director John Ford, who gave them part-time jobs during his productions and sometimes used them in bit parts.  (Ford even directed a few of the scenes in ""Hondo"" because Farrow had to return to Hollywood to work another film.)  There is a special tribute on the DVD to Bond, who became known to millions of Americans as the beloved wagonmaster on NBC's ""Wagon Train"" in the late 1950's.  Bond died suddenly in late 1960 from a heart attack, after appearing in hundreds of motion pictures.  He was often a crusty, rough character who, nevertheless, could be loveable and entertaining.

James Arness also worked with John Wayne in ""Island in the Sky"" and when Arness debuted on CBS television series ""Gunsmoke,"" Wayne introduced the very first episode in 1955.  This came after Wayne had declined an invitation from CBS to star on the show.  They remained friends for many years.

Long unavailable, ""Hondo"" remains a thoroughly entertaining and exciting film and it has never looked or sounded better than in this digitally restored version.",1150156800,19,4078,4.977876106194691

One of the better John Wayne westerns according to ""LIFE AND TIMES OF THE WESTERN MOVIE"" (and myself) is now available in DVD format. This Batjac production had been a collector's dream for a long time. Years ago I bought a VHS tape that did not satisfy me, but this DVD has got all it takes.

In Hondo, John Wayne plays a cavalry dispatch rider who helps a lonely woman (Geraldine Chaplin) and her son (Lee Aaker) through an Indian uprising. Not a run-of-the-mill, cowboy versus Indians, this western shows a sympathetic view towards the Apaches who are gradually losing their way of life as the white men settle in the Southwest.

Wayne's character, Hondo, who is part Indian is caught in a crossfire when he has to defend the woman and her small boy in a conflict between Victorio's Apaches and the Cavalry.

Hondo is based on a novel by Louis Lamour and written by James Edward Grant. Director John Farrow had to quit his directorial assignment due to another engagement, so John Ford finished the movie unaccredited.

This DVD is loaded with extras, such as interviews, trailers, commentaries, the making of Hondo in the Camargo, Mexico, desert. In one of the extras John Wayne's son explains how they cleaned each frame of the movie prior to transferring it to DVD.

Wayne plays the part of Hondo Lane who is first seen carrying dispatches for the cavalry in Arizona. His horse has been shot out from under him by Apaches and he wanders into a farmstead inhabited a woman and her young son. She is justifiably worried about the strange man and tries to maintain the fiction that her husband will be back at any time. Hondo sees through this but his direct, forthright and honest character makes an impression on her. It out that her husband has been gone for quite a while and she has no idea if or when he will return.

After Wayne leaves, the woman, played by Geraldine Page, is visited by the Apache leader Victorio. He is impressed by the bravery of her young son and has no personal animosity against the woman but warns her that she cannot stay without a husband to care for her and the son. He tries to set her up with some of his warriors but she manages to resist for a little while. Still, he warns her that her husband must return soon or she will be provided with a new husband.

Wayne, in the meantime, delivers his dispatches and the news is grim. The Apache are ready to rise. He gives the warning and then has a few run-ins with Page's absentee husband. They do not get along. Eventually, it is up to Wayne to save the day for the cavalry, the homesteader, Arizona and goodness and decency. It's a bit pat but it is fun.

The Indians are treated respectfully in this western. Along with Wayne himself, they are portrayed as the only completely honest people in the film. It is fun and exciting and well done.",1131494400,4,1676,4.328025477707007
595346,4,6303192254,"At first glance, John Wayne's 1953 western, ""Hondo"", bears a remarkable similarity to another 1953 release, George Stevens' classic, ""Shane"". Both films open with an iconic stranger appearing out of the wilderness, spotted first by a young, impressionable boy. Both title characters arrive at homesteads in need of an 'extra pair of hands', and form unspoken bonds with the women of the households. Both Hondo and Shane have survival skills the families desperately need, even as the families fill a void in their own lives. But while Stevens' film
moves at a slow, deliberate pace, meticulously creating a near-mythic vision, ""Hondo"" director John Farrow, working from a script by longtime Wayne scribe James Edward Grant (from Louis L'Amour story), cuts the exposition down to basics, giving the film a much leaner 'look', with a climax (actually directed by John Ford, as Farrow had scheduling problems with another film) that is so fast-paced that it can leave a viewer in 'midair', expecting more. As a result, ""Hondo"" isn't held in as high esteem as ""Shane"", but is certainly a rewarding, entertaining experience, with one of Wayne's best pre-""Searchers"" performances, and Geraldine Page earning an Oscar nomination in her film debut.

Filmed in the broiling summer heat of Mexico, utilizing massive,
cumbersome dual cameras to create 3-D (which both Wayne and Warner studio head Jack Warner felt was the wave of the future, but would be pass by the film's release), the production was grueling, yet formed lasting friendships. Australian Michael Pate, playing the key role of historic Chiricahua Apache Chief, Vittorio, was stunned to find Wayne, during a dangerous riding sequence, running along, off-camera, to protect him if he fell (Wayne, impressed by the actor, would cast him, ten years later, as another Indian chief in ""McLintock!""). Several of Wayne's 'Stock Company' (Ward Bond, Paul Fix, James Arness, and Chuck Roberson) have roles (Bond's bearded, crusty 'Buffalo Baker' is a standout). John Ford, between films, vacationed in Mexico to visit Wayne and Bond, and was recruited (unbilled), to help direct.

The only discordant note on the set was stage actress Page. Wayne had hoped to get Katharine Hepburn for the role of Angie Lowe, but the liberal actress wasn't comfortable working with the politically conservative Wayne at that time (during the ""Witch Hunt"" for suspected Communists in the film industry), and passed on the project (as would her long-time love, Spencer Tracy, in ""The High and the Mighty"", Wayne's next production).
It would be 22 years before Hepburn and Wayne would finally team up together (in ""Rooster Cogburn""). Geraldine Page, picked by Farrow for her fresh, 'natural' look, carried her stage training and 'attitude' into the filming, which did little to endear her to the cast, and Wayne felt little chemistry between them (although her performance would be the most honored, by the film industry).

With colorful characterizations, a chaste romance, plenty of action, and little of the obvious '3-D' gimmicks (only noticeable in the titles sequence, and two Indian fight scenes), ""Hondo"" was a HUGE hit when released, and has endured as one of John Wayne's most popular westerns.

Best of the Special Edition DVD 'extras' is a wonderful ""Making of"" documentary, with comments by Pate and the film's juvenile lead, Lee Aaker; brief bios of writer Grant, and Ward Bond; and a revealing, VERY balanced Apache overview of both the film and the REAL Chiricahua Chief Vittorio.

With nearly pristine image and sound quality, the ""Special Edition"" certainly lives up to expectations!",1130457600,4,3628,5.216123499142367
595347,4,6303192254,"No wonder 3-D never took off.  ""Hondo"" has the makings of a really great film but the makers of the film are so concerned with projectile images emanating from the screen(""Watch the Duke shod a horse!"" ""Wonder at that Apache spear that whizzes at you!"") that they compromise a great story.  John Wayne though does a terrific job as Hondo Lane, the half-breed with the ambiguous past.  The film suggests a dark side to Hondo's character that is not fully exploited here but in a scant few years Wayne would tackle Ethan Edwards in ""The Searchers"" who was a fully developed morally complex individual.  Geraldine Page, deserving of her Oscar nomination for her work here, assays a non-stereotypical account of the frontier woman.  The film also offers an enlightened view of the Apaches.  I give this film a pass but it's a shame that it compromised story for the sake of faddish technology.",1129420800,3,889,4.777777777777778
595348,5,6303192254,"""Do what you want to do"" was cavalry scout Hondo Lane's philosophy of life for dealing with people. Lane (John Wayne)held to the notion that showing was better than telling where human interactions were involved, and that lessons learned first hand tended to stay with you longer than did advice given.

Hence he'd give up telling a boy (Lee Aaker...later ""Corporal Rusty"" to tv's Rin Tin Tin) not to try petting a feral dog and let him ""do what he wanted to do"". He did, and he got bit. And learned his lesson. Lane figured if you did what you wanted, you'd either end up right or wrong. If you ended up right, good for you. If you came up wrong you took the consequences, learned the lesson (hopefully), and wouldn't make the same kind of mistake again. A bit of a spin on Nietsche's ""That which does not kill you makes you strong"" philosophy.

  A tough philosophy, but one that would serve one well in the

1880s desert southwest during the violent Apache wars.

  This film is one I have long adored, but haven't seen in many years until this new DVD release from Paramount. I remember when I saw it first, where I saw it first, and under what circumstances. Saw it as a first grader when it came out in '53. My dad picked me up from school on his day off and took me to an afternoon matinee at the Plaza Theatre in Greenville, SC. I ate this movie up and, despite some of the info given out by Leonard Maltin and others on this new disc to the effect that the 3D version only showed in NY and LA and maybe one or two other big cities, I know for a FACT that I SAW it in 3D here in Joanne Woodward's home town because I was chattering for

DAYS about arrows and spears flying out at you from the screen,

and about horses almost trampling you....and weird little green and red plastic glasses you had to wear to see it. Sorry Mr. Maltin, I love you as a movie critic and I know you have good sources on your film histories...but you're just WRONG about THIS one!

  Great film this, 3D OR 2d. Great performances,great cinematography, great stunt work, great story, great dialog, and...beyond just performances...great CHEMISTRY between the principles. This is one of the best Duke westerns; right up there with Red River, the Searchers, Rio Bravo, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, and The Shootist. As a six-year-old at it's release I carried away from it two burning images: a steely-eyed Hondo walking slowly up to an apprehensive Angie Lowe (Geraldine Page)and son at the beginning of the film, and the fatal spearing of Sam the dog by Rudy Acosta's evil Chirachaua sub-chief later on in the movie.

  Was glad that Acosta ""got his"" at the end, but was sorry that Vittorio(Michael Pate) died. Didn't Pate play a cowboy vampire in some B-grade horror movie? I'd swear I could put his face to such a thing. Also find it interesting that the Hondo Lane character was deemed so popular in the 1950s that Warner Brothers re-worked him a little bit and put him forth (albeit a lot less hard-edged) a few years later as ""Bronco Layne""...with a ""y"" added...in the person of actor Ty Hardin (who looked a bit like PATRICK Wayne). And then in the 60s ABC did a straight (but short-lived) series version of Hondo starring Ralph Taeger. Okay...but NOT the Duke.

  Glad to recommend ""Hondo""...the DUKE'S Hondo...to any and all fans of the western genre.",1129420800,2,3350,4.4983498349834985
595349,5,6303192254,"The Movie

Not your typical 1950's western, when most most 1950 westerns were almost always racist this one was respectful and ads to a feel of realism in the this tale of one mans sense of duty to protect a woman and a boy just cause they need it. In all the westerns that have ever been made this one holds a special place for alot of western fans. the cast isn't really that special though its solid no one will make u go i didn't know they were in that, but if you are a fan of westerns this is a must have

The Audio

You get 2 mixes on this disc a 5.1 surround sound mix and the standard mono. THe 5.1 is acceptible after all this movie was made in 1953. The gun shots are loud and clear no noise at all. The mono is unbearable its very quiet and there some noise in it.

The Video

Unfourtanly this movie is made in full screen i beleive that is because at the time screens weren't 16x 9 so it was made that way if i am wrong i apologize it gives it that saturday western feel which ads to the feel of nostalgia. Its a good transfer not perfect it has soem grain and shows its age seems they rushed it just to get it on dvd. It clear for 90% though so acceptable for a 10 movie. The original was shot in 3d which they are now trying to bring back (they think it will bring people back to the theater..haha lowering the prices so i can not bye the dvd cheaper would do that) by the time it was released the 3d craze was dying.

The Extras

Commentary

by Lenard Maltin, Frank Thompson, and lee asker. Its a descent commentary worth a listen once

A Special Introduction by Lenard Maltin, a very pointless adition to the john wayne collection. Very annoying to anyone who just wants to watch the movie.

The Making of Hondo, a very good look into the process of making the movie

Profile:

James Edward Grant, frankly boring to watch and just thrown in cause they could i guess.

The John Wayne Stock Company:

Ward Band....all i can ask is why cause its really nothing to do with the movie

595350,4,6303192254,"One of John Wayne's most-loved films is available on DVD for the first time. 1953's HONDO Special Collector's Edition (Paramount) is a sharp-looking transfer; shot on majestic locations (it was originally filmed for 3-D) and loaded with extras. Besides vintage production footage there's an amiable, fact-laden commentary from fan and critic Leonard Maltin.

This solid adaptation of the Louis L'Amour short story ""The Gift of the Cochise,"" was given the Wayne touch with a screenplay by James Edward Grant, who was a master of the laconic dialogue that Wayne made his trademark.  (L'Amour expanded his short story into a novel.  It became a bestseller and he became a household name.)

The story, reminiscent of Shane, stars Wayne as the titular hero, a bitter half-breed cavalry scout, a loner whose sympathies lie more with the Indians than the White man whose only friend is a mean spirited dog.  That is until he falls into an uneasy friendship with a lonely New Mexico farmwoman (Geraldine Page in her film debut) whose husband disappears for long periods and whose son is a blood brother to the local Apache chief.",1128038400,10,1121,5.005376344086022
595391,5,6303192254,"HONDO is a solid Western in the best tradition of the genre. Based on the story ""The Gift of Cochise"" by Louis L'Amour, John Wayne brings the character Hondo Lane to the screen juxtaposed with his familiar screen presence yet true to L'Amour's spirit of the literary ""Western."" James Edward Grant's script is impressively sympathetic to the American Indian given the period when this film was produced. Geraldine Page as Angie is perfectly nave as the homesteader living alone with her son in the open wilderness of rock and dust (artistically captured by Robert Burks' cinematography). However, it is John Wayne's portrayal as the enigmatically tough yet unemotionally tender survivor of this barren country that is the strength of this film. The music for HONDO is credited to both Emil Newman and Hugo Friedhofer and their impressive melody for HONDO majestically reflects the honorable and brave stature of the man.",1109635200,69,919,5.133333333333334
595392,5,6303192254,"I supposed to any John Wayne fan, this movie have to be one of his best ever. To an non-John Wayne fan and you haven't seen this movie, you will be very pleasantly surprise. It proves to be a finely crafted film, well directed, scripted and fill with interesting characters. John Farrow directed this film and he did a good job. The movie was based on Louis L'Amour novel and having read the book, I thought the movie did great justice to it.

John Wayne played his role well although most people will never believed him to be ""half-Indian"". His support of Indians' position proves to be quite enlightening considering when this movie was made. Wayne managed to bring out his character with skills which often belied many critics who only believed that Wayne can only be Wayne. Geraldine Page is perfect as Wayne's love interest. She's supposed to be ""homely"" looking and I supposed she had to ""downgrade"" her looks to play the part. The movie proves to be well supported by a good cast such as Ward Bond, James Arness and Michael Pate.

The movie initially came in 3-D effect and the VHS tape I owned is in that effect. So everytime I played the movie, I have to put on those silly 3D glasses which create some eyestrain after a while. Good thing the movie is only 84 minutes long. The 3D effects isn't that bad but I thought the movie could have gone without it. Some of the scenes were made for the 3D like the knife coming toward you and such things you see when you go and watch Terminator 3D at Universal Studios. Without the 3D, these scenes looked pretty awkward and weak.

Despite of that, Hondo Lane would be one of the greatest characters played by Wayne. Its too bad that DVD release on this movie haven't been done yet and if it does come out someday, it should be release in its original 3D format with the 3D glasses enclosed inside the DVD container.

Movie come highly recommended for anyone who likes western.",1108166400,10,1927,4.481481481481482

595394,4,6303192254,"I have certainly seen much worse Western movies all ready out on DVD. I wish this great one was available on DVD (When I wrote this it wasn't). I caught it on TV this weekend during a John Wayne marathon of movies. The acting, sets, directing, scenery, and music all stand out on this one. Many critics think ""The Searchers"" is great but although I think it is a wonderfully shot movie I don't think the interaction is as believable as ""Hondo"". The cast here does a wonderful job of making me believe what is happening and that I'm with them in that time period. John Furrow must have worked hard directing to get such results.

The attitude towards Indians is much more appropriate as well. The camera work is excellent. Especially good with wide scenic shots and close-ups of the actors. The directing as I said before is excellent, and the scope of acting in this movie is some of the best I have seen in a John Wayne movie or any Western for that matter. Geraldine Page is great as the Duke's love interest. She does a magnificent job portraying a pioneer woman. Ward Bond, Michael Pate, James Arness, and the rest the cast do a fine job supporting. I hope you get the opportunity to see it. I'm sure you will agree it is a top notch Western and it should be on DVD.

As an addendum I want to thank the studio for finally releasing a wonderful quality DVD with several extras. This is a personal favorite and I want to thank those of you nice enough to vote for my review. It is people like you showing an interest in these classics that prompts the studios to do a proper job of restoring the movies and releasing them on DVD.",1091491200,169,1631,4.344262295081967

This is one of Wayne's best performances and I believe his line at the end where he calls for the wagon train to move out became a favorite of impersonators (something like ""wagon, ho!"").  Along with ""Shane"", this is one of my favorite westerns, and the plots are similar.  However, these are two very different films.  ""Shane"" is a sweeping epic of values and moral dilemmas, beautifully filmed and acted, patiently paced.

I disagree with the reviewers who believe this is a ""typical"" or ""formula"" western. The fact that Hondo had killed the heroine's husband (and felt great trepidation over it) ;alone sets the movie apart.
