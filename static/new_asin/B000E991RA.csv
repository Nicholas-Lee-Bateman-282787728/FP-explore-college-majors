8107702,4,B000E991RA,"Informative DVD, talking you through the advise from professionals and parents. It doesnt provide specific exercises or programs for you to implement but discusses the importance of communicating with your child day to day. It covers topics including: hearing issues, encouraging speech, making speech understandable, talking begins, building vocab and grammar.",1337299200,,361,6.098039215686274
8107703,5,B000E991RA,"As a parent of a young child with Down syndrome, I am so glad I have this DVD.  It provides many different perspectives on language development for children with Down syndrome.  It is an excellent companion or follow-up viewing for the DVD ""Down Syndrome:  The First 18 Months"" by the same director/studio.

This video describes communication issues in many areas, such as signing, physical development, speech therapy, and other supports.  Libby Kumin is an oft-present expert, as are many parents and their children with Down syndrome.  I especially enjoyed the perspective pieces which showed children's growth over time (""Horsey!!"") and also the unique connections children make with letters (""Snowman"").

I have lent this video to my son's caregiver, and she also appreciated the ideas and suggestions in this DVD.  I recommend it for parents as well as therapists and caregivers.",1267833600,4,885,5.271428571428571
