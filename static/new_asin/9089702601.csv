The pace is perfect and it will loop over again on it's own.  Love it.",1468627200,,248,4.326086956521739

7901487,5,9089702601,"I am a big fan of the Ambient Collection DVDs.  The photography is always beautiful and there is a wide variety of subjects to choose from.  This DVD is a widescreen version in HD.

I am giving the DVD 5 stars because it has beautiful scenery plus natural sounds of the sea or you can choose Zen type music to another two selections which many viewers may like.  I would not discourage anyone from buying this DVD if you love being at the beach and enjoying the sounds of the waves coming in and have patience enough to enjoy a beautiful sunrise or sunset.  This is a DVD that starts out with the dawn and goes through the day ending with sunsets.  Think slow pace in a fast paced world!  The sun rises and sets S-L-O-W-L-Y.  You need to get in a meditative mood to thoroughly enjoy the simplicity of style that this DVD presents.

I have my favorites from the Ambient Collection which always includes more piano music than not.  For that reason, on my personal scale this DVD would get 3 stars because it only had piano music on one selection which was called Tropical Afterglow and it was beautiful both in scenery and music.  I was very much in my happy place with this selection!

So, this is a 5 Star for those who like natural sounds or Zen type music and a slow paced DVD.  Its 3 stars if you are looking for piano music and want it to be included with most of the scenes.  Since I couldn't put a rating of 3-5 stars, I choose to put 5 to be fair to those who are looking for this type of DVD.  There is not a flaw in it  just personal preferences.

If it is what you are looking for, buy it now and start building your collection of amazing DVDs!  If this isn't exactly what you are looking for, there are many more DVDs from the Ambient Collection to choose from and you will be able to build yourself a nice collection fit to what you like the best.

I received this DVD free of charge for my honest review.",1447632000,,1917,4.188524590163935
7901488,5,9089702601,"Virtual Walks Paradise Beaches DVD is my 1st DVD purchase from Isis Asia Limited and Im VERY HAPPY about it. With my busy lifestyle, I can say that this is the perfect DVD that suits my needs.

I love treadmill exercises and living in a city makes me miss walking on the beach. Just the trailer itself already grabbed my attention. Paradise Beaches includes 3 stunning virtual walks. You can see different beaches at different times of the day. The beauty of the surroundings, including that long stretch of soft sand makes you want to walk longer on your treadmill.

I really enjoyed walking on the beach right next to the peaceful water and whenever I keep on going, the more things I am able to see and explore. It is really enjoyable seeing the tall coconut trees, the boats, the crystal clear water and the gorgeous sky. I have never seen such beautiful rock formations and shapely mountains at the background.

My all time favorite is the sunset on the beach. The colors of the sky are truly breathtaking. You just want to keep on walking. It is very relaxing as it comes with the natural sounds of the ocean, including the soothing breeze.

I can almost feel the water in my toes and it made me feel like I am actually there instead of my exercise room! I liked ALL three virtual walks, and it is difficult for me to choose which one I should play first, but whats great is I can all play them in loop individually or all of them.

Exercising has never been this refreshing for me. It really transformed the way I exercise. I can definitely say that Virtual Walks Paradise Beaches DVD is truly a GREAT BUY!",1388880000,,1613,4.454237288135594
7901489,5,9089702601,"I found ""Paradise Beaches"" to be an absolutely stunning DVD with breath-taking views while listening to the soft relaxing sounds of the waves.  The sound alone makes you feel like you are at the shoreline.  As the dawn breaks into day ... then day into dusk, the sunrises and sunsets are something to behold!  Will most definitely watch this DVD over and over again!",1382659200,,366,4.6875
7901490,4,9089702601,"From the soft ripple of the sea at sunrise, into the anticipated crashing of the waves during the day, ending in the breathtaking vivid colors of the sunset, the PARADISE BEACH dvd is a delightful evolving experience.  The stunning colors of the sand and the sea could not be more beautiful, and, while the relaxing sounds of the ocean are ever present (and in sync) the changing panoramic views of the beach are equally wonderful and interesting. The beach views and ocean angles are exceptional and significant to the total presentation.  The dvd sets a perfect mood to entertain or be alone . . .",1382486400,,599,4.695238095238095

7901492,2,9089702601,"This DVD has two options .... Relaxing Beaches Film or 3 choices under the Natural Decoration (Paradise Beach, Sunset Beach or Tropical Beach).

The relaxing beaches starts out at sunrise, then daytime through sunset.  The camera focuses on a specific beach and then moves on to other beach scene.  The scenes are realistic looking (clear images/great colors) but the downside is that the scenes do not move or flow.  They just sit there for awhile before any movement happens and then it switches to another scene.  There also is no option to allow music (which would be nice for a yoga practie where flow/movements are being done).  This option only allows the beach/water sounds.

The natural decoration selection allows you to have the beach/water sounds or music.  This is nice; however, the images pretty much are still shots and are boring.  The water in the images moves a bit but the background/sky looks fake (digitally created and not realistic).

BEWARE OF THIS SELLER ... I ordered 4 DVD's ... 2 were favorable (good production/quality) and 2 were not.  When I returned the 1st DVD that was beyond horrible, the seller hit  me with a 50% restock fee (which was not disclosed when I went to process the return).  I was not too happy to find this out.  I reach out to Amazon for assistance and Amazon took care and refunded the 50% restock fee.  I ended up returning the 2nd unfavorable DVD a week later (first opportunity I had to view since I received in the mail) ... this DVD was boring and not the best quality produced DVD and surely not worth the price.  Amazon allowed me to generate a mailing label but the seller refused delivery from the post office and requested that the DVD to be sent back to me.  Seller again, hit me with a restock fee for the return.  I contacted Amazon and asked for assistance with this seller (again).  Amazon did not understand why seller would allow a return label to be generated and then refuse delivery of the return.  Amazon pulled through (again) for me and refunded the restock fee and emailed me a mailing label to return DVD to their distribution center. I would like to order/try another DVD but unfortunately this seller does not give an exchange option for returns (I would have not opted on the refund and rather did an exchange instead). This seller is the only distributor for these types of DVDs. The quality of the DVD's this seller distributes is a 50/50 (positive/negative) so you really are taking a chance of whether or not the DVD will be a quality produced DVD or not.  I cannot afford to pay for DVDs just to sit around and use or like. I guess you really have to depend on the customer reviews before you place an order from this seller.  The way this seller does business is unfortunate.  This is the only return and bad experience I ever had with any seller on Amazon.",1358208000,4,2844,4.588118811881188
