8127895,5,B000FZF08M,"Because there is so little market for strongman-related items, and strength athletes in general, there is almost nothing for fans of the sport to enjoy. This DVD set is a rare find and well worth becoming a part of your collection. The two-DVD set covers the 2005 IFSA world championships and the IFSA team competition in thirteen episodes.

If you're looking for a high-budget endeavor, good luck. This set is not it.  There are a few spelling errors in names and there's no extra content if you're looking for it. That aside, it's still a great product.",1201910400,6,555,4.711340206185567
8127896,5,B000FZF08M,"This 2 DVD set is a condensed version of the major strongman competitions of the 2005 season of IFSA, the International Federation of Strength Athletes.  It starts out with coverage of the 2005 IFSA European Championships in Riga, Latvia, and culminates at the 2005 IFSA World Championships in Quebec, Canada.  Along the way there are world records broken and very exciting performances by all of the world's top strength athletes.  I highly recommend it for all fans of strength sports.",1190332800,11,487,5.0625
