Nature runs amock from man's incessant tinkering with it, and a group of hikers are conveniantly cught in the middle.  No gore, no  surprises, no scares, just complete boredom.

1004196,3,6305280665,"If the ozone layer vanished,many scientists have  theories about how this would effect life on Earth.  I guarantee that none of these theories comes close to the one put forth by this movie. Turns out that when the ozone  goes, all the animals on the planet go ICKY-BINGO and band together to wipe  humanity off the face of the planet. It's not really dynamic but it is fun  watching cougars running through Denver's suburbs scaring crossing guards,  mailmen and dogs out of 10 years growth. The best part though, is when  crazed hiker Leslie Neilsen goes kamikazee against a murderous grizzly  bear. He actually tries to bite the beasts ear off! Needless to say this is  a very short,but entertaining scene. There is also an attempt at drama and  inter-personal tension, but luckily the creators never try too hard with  that part of the film.",950140800,6,844,4.751724137931035

I found the acting to be extremely corny, I'm a huge fan of Leslie Nielsen but his role as Jenson was simply not one that was meant for him. I hated Christopher George's character Steve. Steve is such an arrogant, thinks he knows it all prick that I simply could not stand. Why build a character with those kind of traits in the beginning of a film and then try to change it around as if he's some natural born hero? I didn't see him as a hero at all. He was always a prick in my eyes, simply from how Steve was introduced into the story. As for the special effects, don't expect much being that this film was released in 1977. Then again A New Hope was released that year as well and it wasn't merely that bad. All in all, I hated it.

I would bet that this Eco-movie had a few animal rights violations because there are numerous scenes of main characters punching dogs and other stunts which could have terrified or injured animals.  So while the movie endeavors to promote awareness of Ozone layer depletion, it takes a step backwards in the other eco-activist pursuit of animal rights.

1004569,2,6305280665,"DAY OF THE ANIMALS

Take a deep breath, stop drinking and eating, and let me lay out the premise of Day Of The Animals for you: big-haired women of the mid-70's have depleted the ozone layer with all their hairspray, and now UV radiation is turning animals into vicious kill-bots bent on human destruction.

My impression is that they meant for this to be an ecological-horror. Quite contrary! Though it reunites producer Edward Montero and Christopher George- whom I've only just yesterday finished ripping a new one in my review for Grizzly- there's another star, the true hero of the story, who just so happens to be playing the villain: Leslie Nielsen.

And yes, for you younger people, that is the guy from the Naked Gun series, and yes, he is freakin' hilarious. Which is how Day Of The Animals, quite unintentionally, put me in the correct mindset to receive it as comedy gold. Before we dive into the nitty-gritty, accept that reality.

Montero and his buddies wanted to make another Grizzly, which was them making another Jaws, and as South Park taught us, If you french-fry when you should have pizzad, you're gonna have a bad time. But if you accept the accidental comedy, you might actually enjoy it.

I've never reviewed a comedy, but I'll do my best!

Christopher George resumes his roll as Chiseljaw from Grizzly, which is to say his beautiful jawline probably drew in more women than would otherwise ever watch this garbage. I forget his character's actual name, but the comedy starts right off the bat with his overstated, quasi-country accent. He's leading a group of hikers out into wild high-country, despite the fact that his boss has been getting weird reports of crazed animals. Montero & Co. had a helicopter left over from shooting Grizzly, so they go ahead and pile all the tourist in those  that's my theory anyways  and we're really running with a few unintentional caricatures right off the bat targeting Native Americans and New-York accented whining women (come on, people, I thought the seventies were better than that).

But all is not well in Camelot. Somethings rotten in the state of Denmark. Theres been a disturbance in the Force (and this one goes to 11). Birds of prey surround the hikers at their very first stop as they hoof it up the mountain, squawking and screeching and generally reminding me more of Bigbird than serial killers. Being something of a raptor aficionado myself, I cant help but oogle at the cute little condors, redtails, and turkey-vultures. Back at base-camp... or town, or wherever it was the ill-fated hikers departed from... a mangy-looking dog growls menacingly, to add to the growing sense of unease (or in my case, the growing sense of amusement).

Oooh! Now the hawks are stalking the hikers? Sweet! Weve got a regular Jeffrey Dahmer here.

Id based my expectation off Grizzly, so I was actually surprised at how long we go before the first fatality. Youll have to wait nearly half an hour for the first animal attack. Not to worry: once we get the first body, the hilarity ensues in rapid succession. Leslie Nielsen moves to center-stage, rapidly evolving into the human antagonist with racist jokes and venomous one-liners.

Is this an actual plot element I detect? Is it possible that the ozone-radiation induced madness turning the animals into murderous gangbangers is also going to turn the humans into raving lunatics?

Weve got hawks dragging people off cliffs, complete with Wilhelm scream. Weve got Lone Wolf attacks- no, not that kind, literally a lone wolf- which somehow turns one victims face not into hamburger meat, but rather leaves the attractive starlet with superficial red streaks. Meanwhile, solitary cougars have formed hunting packs, which has my inner naturalist guffawing at the reversal. Weve got viking-inspired rats pillaging pantries, and then, faces! Supposedly vicious dogs, tails a-wagging out of lovable glee as they sew havoc and destruction.

By now its 10PM and Im a little drunk. Which is how I discovered Day of the Animals true value: as a drinking game. Going forward, Ill highly recommend the film and the drinking rules as follow:

Drink whenever

1) You laugh at Chiseljaws ridiculous accent
2) Leslie Nielsen calls the Native American guide hotshot, makes fun of another hiker/delivers a one-line zinger, or does anything remotely racist (careful, youll be drunk by about mid-film)
3) The supposedly menacing critters make you ooh and ah at their adorableness
4) You spot a fishing line attached to a leaping critter
5) The totally not a Jewish stereotype mom flips out

You can imagine how my night ended. Maybe the movie was hilarious, maybe I was just three sheets to the wind. I lasted to the credits, at least, at which point I proceeded to worship the porcelain throne face-first.

Was this movie a good horror film? Absolutely not. Was I too drunk to objectively determines its quality as a comedy? Probably. Was it the films constant glare or my bargain-bin vodka responsible for my pounding headache afterward? God knows. Are the women- including the lead- there as anything but eye-candy, damsels in distress, and gore-fodder? Not really, but it was the seventies. How is it that the animals only target humans, but never each other? Come on, folks; were talking about the people who made Grizzly. Dont go dragging logic into this equation!

I cant in good conscience recommend this movie to anyone who isn't ready to down a fifth of bourbon  while watching. If interpreted as intended  as an eco-horror  it misses the mark entirely.

But if you watch it as an unintentional comedy, and you're the sort of person who gets off on truly horrible film, this ones right up your alley.",1471737600,2,5705,4.90134994807892

1004701,4,6305280665,"The first thing that came to mind when I inserted this Blu-Ray of the PG-Rated ""nature gone amuck"" horror film into my player was that how many of the main stars are no longer with us (Only two are still alive!). The director also passed away in a helicopter crash (he was only 30 years-old) after making one more film (THE MANITOU - 1977), which was released theatrically in the U.S. three months after his death in January 1978. This film was very sad for me to watch; not that it is a bad film (far from it), but because I always was an ardent fan of the director and all of the deceased actors (who appeared in many of the director's films). The premise for this film is very 1970s: Because of the abundant use of fluorocarbon gases in aerosol spray cans, the Earth's protective ozone layer is severely damaged, letting dangerous amounts of ultra-violet rays reach the surface of our planet, starting with high-altitude areas. The opening on-screen scrawl says that this motion picture dramatizes what COULD happen in the near future IF we continue to do nothing to stop this (A mere two years later, in October of 1978, the FDA would order the phaseout of ""non-essential"" uses of fluorocarbons in spray products. Could this film have helped this happen? Who knows?). The film opens with Steve Bruckner (Christopher George; GRIZZLY - 1976; R.I.P.) leading a group of hikers on a two week trip down a 5,000 foot mountain, not heeding the warnings of Ranger Tucker (Walter Barnes; PIGS - 1972; R.I.P.), who tells Steve that there have been many reports of ""accidents"" at that high altitude. The group of hikers and Steve take two helicopters to the top of the mountain and we are introduced to them and their quirks: Bossy and racist advertising executive Paul (Lesiie Nielsen, who would become a comedy icon in AIRPLANE - 1980; R.I.P.); Native American tracker Santee (Michael Ansara; IT'S ALIVE - 1973; R.I.P.), the brunt of Paul's racist remarks; former football player Roy (Paul Mantee; WOLF LAKE - 1978; R.I.P.), who blew out his knee and was forced to retire; cheating husband Frank (Jon Cedar; LITTLE CIGARS - 1973; R.I.P.) and his unforgiving wife Mandy (Susan Backlinie), who are on this trip to try and save their marriage; Professor MacGregor (Richard Jaeckel; THE DARK - 1979; R.I.P.), who is on this hike to study nature; divorced mother Shirley (Ruth Roman; IMPULSE - 1974; R.I.P.) who has brought her inquisitive young son John (Bobby Porter) for some bonding time; young couple Bob (Andrew Stevens; THE TERROR WITHIN - 1988) and girlfriend Beth (Kathleen Bracken); and TV reporter Terry Marsh (Lynda Day George; PIECES - 1982; who, like Stevens, is still with us at the time this review was written). As soon as our group starts their hike, they see such unusual sights as buzzards and eagles perching together in trees and when they camp out for the first night, Santee says to Steve, ""There's something strange in the woods and I don't know what it is."" Steve asks Santee to keep it between themselves for now because it won't take much to panic the ""city folks"". That night, a wolf attacks Mandy, so, the following morning, Frank takes her up the mountain to the nearest Ranger station to get her medical attention, while the rest head down the mountain on their hike. Paul keep making racial epithets of Santee's ancestry (stupidly calling him ""kemo sabe"" and other Native American insults) and generally making himself a pain-in-the-ass to the rest of the group (even challenging Steve's role as leader). Frank and Mandy continue to fight about his adultery while they head up the mountain, until Mandy is attacked by a flock of buzzards and falls to her death over a cliff to the boulders below (an awful optical effect), even though Frank tries to save her. Frank finds a young, dirty mute female child (Michelle Stacy) and when he gives her a slice of an orange, he is attacked by an eagle, so he grabs the young girl and heads for the nearest town (he just lost his wife, so he has a new purpose in protecting this young girl, since it's apparent that her parents have been killed). When the rest of the group discover that their first food drop has been raided by animals, Paul blows a gasket and wants to be the new boss, but the rest of them vote him down, preferring to stay with Steve. Meanwhile, Ranger Tucker gets a call from the main Ranger station telling him that animals are attacking people at 5,000 feet, so the Army is called in to evacuate the town and then the hikers on the mountain. Tucker is attacked by a pack of rats in his home (a very good and bloody scene that could never be shown in a PG film today), but he escapes after pulling a rat off his face and cutting its head off with a knife. He sends his wife to safety and then heads to town to help with the evacuation, but there a rabid-looking, scroungy dog that seems to follow his every move (more on the dog and Tucker later). Steve and his hikers are attacked by a pack of cougars that night and everyone chips-in to help one another, except Paul, who looks out for himself like the selfish jerk he is. Paul, once again, tries to assert his authority, only this time Shirley (and her unwilling son John), Bob and Beth stupidly aligned themselves with Paul (thinking it will be easier to hike 15 miles uphill to the Ranger station than 30 miles downhill to the town). Steve tries to tell them they are making a big mistake, but Santee tells him, ""You can't save fools from themselves."", as the rest head down the mountain with Steve. Paul shows what a bad guy he is to his four new recruits by violently abusing everyone (including repeatedly throwing young John to the ground) and trying to assault Beth. When Bob tries to intervene, Paul impales him in the stomach with a homemade spear, killing him. As a raging thunderstorm hits, Steve and his group find and abandoned mine for shelter, while Paul and his remaining three scared-to-death prisoners are exposed to the elements. The now quite-mad Paul curses God (""You see what you want and you TAKE it!"") and tries to assault Beth again, only this time he is interrupted by a grizzly bear and decides that he is strong enough to kill the mighty beast, so he charges the bear (they both put each other in a bear hug, in a winking moment to the audience), only for Paul to be mauled to death (How's that for cursing God?). Frank and the young mute girl make it to town, only to find it abandoned (except for a whole lotta rattlesnakes and that pesky mangy mutt). Frank puts the young girl in an abandoned vehicle for safety while he goes looking for a car that works, only to be bitten by rattlesnakes and attacked by the dog, killing him while the little girl watches horrified. Beth is bitten by a pack of wild dogs when she, Shirley and John discover a destroyed helicopter (the dogs are making a meal out of the helicopter's pilot nearby), so all three lock themselves in the copter and wait for help. Steve and his group find some abandoned, windowless cabins and are immediately chased by another pack of dogs. They try to keep the dogs at bay in one of the cabins, but Roy and the Professor are killed, while Steve, Terry and Santee use a small dock as a raft and head down the rapids with two angry dogs as passengers. The following morning, everyone wakes up to find all the animals dead, thanks to our Government using an experimental virus on them. Some people are immune to the virus, but others, like Ranger Tucker fall victim to it, and the Army wants to know why some people survived it, so I guess it won't be smooth sailing for our survivors! Terry says, ""It's finally over!"", but we all know that it won't be for them.  Directed by William Girdler (ASYLUM OF SATAN - 1971; THREE ON A MEATHOOK - 1973; ABBY - 1974, GRIZZLY - 1976 and others), who would tragically die in a helicopter crash of his own while scouting locations for a film in the Philippines, doesn't give the large cast much to do (except for Leslie Nielsen, who get a chance to show his acting chops), except act scared while being attacked by various animals. But the attack scenes are well-filmed, using actual animals, building suspense, and Nielsen really does come across as a violent racist bully. The screenplay, by the late William Norton (I DISMEMBER MAMA - 1972; NIGHT OF THE JUGGLER - 1979) and his wife Eleanor Norton, is nothing but scenes of animals attacking people, but it is strangely satisfying all the same, since all of the effects are old-school and it is filled with great genre actors who are no longer with us. That's what surprised me most: for a film made in 1976, very few of the actors in it are alive today. For that fact alone, it is a great time capsule for seeing all of these actors collected together in one film. It also makes me realize how old I am since I originally saw this in a theater. Also starring Michael Andreas, Gil Lamb and an uncredited appearance from FRIDAY THE 13TH's (1980) ""Crazy Ralph"", Walt Gorney.  Originally released on VHS by Media Home Entertainment (also released theatrically and on VHS [by Applause Productions, Inc.] under the title SOMETHING IS OUT THERE), it then got a budget fullscreen DVD release from the now-defunct DVD, Ltd. before being released in a beautiful anamorphic widescreen print on DVD & Blu-Ray by Scorpion Releasing, the preferred way of watching the film. William Girdler should have become one of the premiere directors of genre films if it wasn't for his tragic death, so to get any of his films on disc looking this good is a blessing. Now if only someone would release ABBY on home video in the U.S. officially for the first time (The injunction by Warner Bros. for copying THE EXORCIST too closely [it doesn't] is no longer active and Warners has gone on record saying so.), I will be a happy man.

1004703,5,6305280665,"This was a great film and very prophetic.
The film (back in 1977 of all things!) correctly predicted the global climate change epidemic and depletion of the Ozone Layer. Well, that's where factually correct scientific analysis ends, or does it?

In the film, radiation from ultra-violet light from the Sun causes wild animals and household pets alike to go bananas and attack folks without regard. In that way, its sort of like MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE from the 1980s (but with animals replacing the machines).
Anyway, the animals have now turned on their former masters, and the terror that results from this really is frightening.

I watched this with small children, what a mistake. They wouldn't go to bed after!

We know Climate Change has been devastating in the decades since the film debuted. However, as far as I know, it has not yet caused animals to turn on humanity. We still have time to change our ways. We still have time...",1415664000,2,932,4.8125

What a highly dramatic public service announcement/environmental dissertation.  Caution, the watching of this film can cause the depletion of the ozone layer.....which in turn increases ultraviolet light subjecting animals (and some people) to deadly solar radiation turning them into mad dogs (as the case may be).  But, be that as it may, this is still a fun little pseudo-horror flick in the animals running amok genre.  The story begins, amusingly enough, as a 'survival hike' is about to take place.  Survival being the key word.  The intrepid Christopher George (as Steve Buckner) is the leader of this motley crew.  He has his hands full dealing with malcontents, complainers, and a variety of neophyte hikers.  Every step of the way they are watched by animals in abundance (this is the only part that didn't really work as most of the animal shots had too much of a National Geographic look to them).  Meanwhile, in the real world, people are warned to stay out of the sun and stay away from angry mutts.  In no time at all, the animals resort to guerrilla warfare and begin specially arranged sneak attacks.  Coincidently, Leslie Nielsen (as crazy Paul Jenson) abruptly turns manic, begins sniping at everyone, eventually becoming a cold killer, and would be rapist.  I guess radiation at 5,000 feet will do that to some actors (it's easily the most bizarre performance in any film).

Quintessentially, the best reason for not having pets or for going hiking in the wilderness.  Camping, never a good idea.",1411344000,,1583,4.9245283018867925

1004709,4,6305280665,"The theme of man vs nature in film was pretty much a genre unto itself in the 1970s and Day of the Animals is a prime example of that genre.  Completely underrated and doomed at the box office, (opening the same weekend of Star Wars didn't help matters); Day of the Animals finds a group of hikers stuck in the woods with a variety of animals who have more or less declared war on mankind.  It is the typical ozone layer ploy that has these beasts turn savage.  If one can get passed a few cliches then there is much to admire in this film.  For starters, the photography of the woods and animals themselves is outstanding.  You can smell the fresh pine just watching.  There is surprisingly a good deal of character development among the hikers that is rarely found in such films.  When the animals attack it is truly terrifying and for the most part damn realistic,(save Neilsen's character taking on a grizzly bear), but hell, even that's entertaining in of itself.  There is a slew of seventies regulars among the tribe, Linda Day George, Andrew Stevens etc, and they all handle there parts well.  It was so refreshing to see actual animals instead of a ton of obvious CGI effects.  How the heck did they get those birds to swoop down and attack?  All in all Day of the Animals is no Jaws, but it is a lot more than other man vs. animal pics.  Highly recommended for fans of this genre.",1395964800,,1390,4.407843137254902
1004710,5,6305280665,"While more could have been done to make this a better science fiction story construct, ""The Day of the Animals"" is an exciting, funny, and bizarre movie that probably holds a special place in movie goers' lives for what the script did to Leslie Nielsen. When he attacks a giant grizzly bear and yells ""c'mon, you bastard,"" I almost lost it. This was the most ridiculous performance I have ever witnessed in a movie. The extra feature on this DVD has the cast of the film recalling what a super guy that Girdler was, and they were being honest; anyone who can make films like this has a special outlook on life. I, however, enjoy the films of this neglected director, neglected because he worked along the margins of American cinema, attacking the B-movie and horror film markets in earnest but making a mark almost nowhere else. I gave ""The Manitou"" 5 stars as well, because it was equally entertaining and absurd, but in a way that we just won't find anymore. This DVD is quite good--you get both versions of the film (including the release version entitled ""Something is Out There"") along with some good audio commentary. While this isn't the kind of film that animal rights campaigners can use to further their case against human bungling, I sympathize with the animals in this movie--and they do wipe out a great deal of idiot people in this. This plot is very absurd but fun in an old-fashioned, 1970's drive-in way. If you don't like this title, then you've no business being here. There's no way to damn it or defend it really. I have to add a word about Schifrin's music score, though--I think this is his best score since 1971's ""The Hellstrom Chronicle"". The man obviously had an ear for eerie natural horror music writing, and here he has allowed his imagination to soar. His music sets the tone for this picture in a perfect way.
As for the picture and sound transfer, the print is pretty clean, and the sound comes across clearly--the overall presentation is a bit grainy, but this is to be expected from a drive-in title. Whether or not I am going to eventually spring for the new BluRay print will depend upon how annoying this old DVD print gets--if I find myself watching it very often.

Although, this bluray did not have the alternate title or tv master of the movie, it is still worth getting. All the actors did a great job for the script that they were given. The Ozone layer is being depleted because of the over use of spray cans and the chemicals going into the atmosphere. Yeah, we've heard it all before, right? Yep. Now, it's Global Warming.  A group of thrill seeking hikers go into the mountain for adventure, but soon find themselves in the fight for their lives! One by one and as a group, they are stalked by all the animals of the air and land. Soon, frustrated with their progress, they split into two groups. One led by the character played by Leslie Nielson(Hey Hotshot!) and the other by Christopher George. One group decides to press on to higher elevations and the other goes back down the mountain. I have to say, by the time Nielson's character gets under my skin, here comes a huge bear to the rescue! They don't make them like this anymore where a character literally goes after a bear and tries to take it down ""bare handed"" lol.

But wait, it's not just the higher elevations on the mountain, it's the city below that is effected as well. Soon, the Army or National Guard is on the scene to ""mop up"" the situation and the radio declares the dangerous ozone has moved on or shifted out of the mountain city. All will be returned to normal within 24 hours as if the animals want to play nice again to mankind. lol

The recent depletion of the Earth's ozone layer causes the sun to shine powerful ultraviolet light carrying some kind of solar radiation that somehow causes all animals above the altitude of 5,000 feet to run amok and kill, which is very unfortunate for a group of hikers (including Christopher George, Lynda Day George, and Leslie Neilsen) who get dropped off up there by helicopter just before a quarantine is announced for all the surrounding towns. This has a dramatic effect on the rest of the nation, turning common household pets and pests into vicious attackers.
Over the course of the movie, multiple wild and dangerous animals stalk and attack the hikers, and eventually start picking them off. These include a Mountain Lion, a Grizzly Bear, a pack of Wolves and several Birds of Prey (Hawks, Falcons, Eagles and Owls).
One of the hikers, Paul Jenson (Leslie Neilsen) goes mad as he is one of the very few humans to be exposed to the solar radiation making all the animals mad, and he eventually attacks the group, killing one of them. He finally takes on a grizzly bear and is killed by a bite to the neck.
The others manage to get below the 5,000 foot ""radiation zone"" area until they are trapped by several German Shepherds in an isolated cabin. Two of the hikers are killed by the vicious canines and the last three of the group members escape on a raft in a nearby river. They are rescued the next day as they float down river to a Park Rangers station.
The next day, groups of U.S. Army troops, wearing radiation suits and armed with flame-throwers and various automatic weapons, arrive to secure the areas. By then almost all the animals that went mad are killed by the very same solar radiation that drove them mad in the first place.

1004833,3,6305280665,"<strong>Day of the Animals</strong> (William Girdler, 1977)

Girdler's silly I-can't-believe-this-wasn't-a-TV-movie ecohorror showcase ended up being his penultimate film before his untimely death (he was killed in a helicopter crash in the Philippines, at the age of thirty, on the set of what would have been his next film). Like the film that followed it, an adaptation of Graham Masterton's novel <em>The Manitou</em>, it works only because despite being a B-movie maven, Girdler and his team had a way of picking out incredible-but-underused talent, either has-beens who were on their way back up, A-listers who were on their way down, or rising stars. That's a talent that requires incredible timing; a lot of casting agents get actors who are six months too late or six months too soon, or something holds up production and the star's career has already crashed and burned with a check into rehab, or what have you. Making this kind of flick, and making it work, requires a lot of luck, a lot of talent in selecting your cast, and a good, solid technical base doesn't hurt. Girdler had all three here, and while the inherent silliness of <em>Day of the Animals</em> keeps it from being what it could have been, everyone involved did a fine job with the material presented.

The plot of the movie involves a group of hikers led by good ol' cowboy Steven Bucker (<em>The Exterminator</em>'s Christopher George). Along on the trip are a stressed-out Madison Avenue type, Paul Jenson (Leslie Nielsen back when he was still playing the heavy in everything), a glamorous reporter just a bit past her prime (George's real-life wife Lynda Day George, fresh off <em>It Happened at Lakewood Manor</em>), a professor with a birdwatching habit (<em>Spenser: for Hire</em>'s Richard Jaeckel), a mother and son having bonding problems, Shirley and John Goodwyn (<em>Strangers on a Train</em>'s Ruth Roman and <em>Night of the Comet</em>'s Bobby Porter), young lovers on a weekend getaway (Paul Mantee and Kathleen Bracken), and another couple on their way out Frank and Mandy Young (Jon Cedar, who would return for <em>The Manitou</em>, and Susan Backlinie, the memorable first victim of <em>Jaws</em>), who spend much of the movie sniping at one another. Just after the group leaves via helicopter, the residents of the town start hearing news reports that the depletion of the ozone layer is causing animals above five thousand feet to go nuts. Yes, really. So our intrepid band, who have just been dropped off on the side of a mountain, now have to fight off homicidal animals.

Yes, it's that stupid, but disaster-of-the-week movies were sometimes done reasonably well; people still watch <em>The Poseidon Adventure</em>, and the cast here is no less awesome. Nielsen, one of the great heavies of the fifties and sixties, had been relegated to TV character actor obscurity for well over a decade by this time (in 1977, he would actually make two big-screen appearances, the other being the execrable <em>Viva Knievel!</em>, which I am ashamed to say I saw on the big screen way back then), but three years after this, his career would explode with <em>Airplane!</em>. Jaeckel was known as a character actor, and had steady work for years, but it wasn't long after this that he would become one of the most beloved police lieutenants in television history. Porter, while he never found success in acting, has become one of Hollywood's most dependable stuntmen. Michelle Stacy, who plays a traumatized little girl Frank runs across, was in the prime of her child-star career, a two-year stretch with appearances in <em>Logan's Run</em> and <em>Demon Seed</em> and a voice lead in <em>The Rescuers</em> (if she had a good agent, she's probably still able to live off those royalties alone, despite having retired from acting in 1980). You get the idea. You know this is going to be a cheesefest from the second you see the poster art, and the movie succeeds in that regard beyond your wildest imaginings (check out the ""grizzly"" Leslie Nielsen wrestles!), but solid acting makes it slightly less onerous than it otherwise would be. I grant you, I'm a fan of bad seventies ecohorror movies, and the worse the better (<em>Kingdom of the Spiders</em>, <em>Frogs</em>, and <em>Night of the Lepus</em> are all in my ""you don't sell this till after I die"" collection), but I think this has some appeal, however slight, beyond the confines of diehard fans of ecohorror. ***",1307664000,,4460,5.057065217391305
1004834,2,6305280665,"Day of the Animals: 4 out of 10: Filmed in glare-o-vision (either to emulate a world without ozone or to give me a headache) Day of the Animals ask what if all the animals went crazy and decided to work together to kill B-movie actors. Hmm.

Most nature gone wild movies focus on one deadly animal (Deadly Scorpions becoming giant deadly scorpions; industrious ants becoming giant industrious ants; cute bunny rabbits becoming Giant Cute bunny rabbits.

Day of the Animals, like its predecessor Frogs, takes a different tack. It throws every living creature at the cast. (Though in Day of the Animals defense unlike Frogs it at least sticks to animals, no one gets killed by the Spanish moss.)

It doesn't work. It really doesn't work. The animal attacks are laughable. Rats and snakes on fishing lines are thrown at actors. A shirtless Leslie Nielson who gets attacked by a bear rug in a scene right out of that killer carpet movie The Creeping Terror. And, most laughably, are the so called attacking dogs. Whom are downright lovable complete with wagging tails. (I've seen Benji look fiercer than those German shepherds whom looked every bit like they were chasing a miniature chuck wagon.)

As for the acting, well you get a shirtless Leslie Nielson hamming it up (years before he did Airplane and ""went"" into comedy) and Jon Cedar channeling a third rate William Shatner singing Barry Manilow (you won't be able to get that Mandy tune out of your head.)

The film in fact has plenty of cannon fodder (even that old comedic and anti-Semitic stand-by the overprotective Jewish mother played by Ruth Roman like she was directed by Leni Riefenstahl). It even has the Poseidon Adventure scene when one pig-headed group splits off from the other.

Day of the Animals also has the worst DVD transfer ever. A third rate pan and scan picture and no chapters or even a title screen. And unlike its companion piece Grizzly it needed a good transfer. After all it's filmed in glare-o-vision.",1268870400,,1984,4.803519061583578

The kind of movie you put on a Sunday afternoon with a box of popcorn and have a few laughs with. It is a shame William Girdler died so young , I do believe he would have become a major Hollywood director in time as can be seen in some of the shots done in this film and Grizzly.",1267833600,,819,4.1572327044025155

Animals and advertising executives will both go crazy, at elevations of 5000 ft. or higher for about 3 days.

I love these 1970's cheesy drive-in nature gone crazy flix as much as the next guy. ""Kingdom of the Spiders"", ""Night of the Lepus"", ""Grizzly, ""Frogs, ""The Pack"" and so many more rest upon my DVD shelf. I remember watching ""Day of the Animals"" on my local Creature Feature growing up, but outside of the title I couldn't remember the film so I picked it up.

The good news is that ""DotA"" features a huge cast of 1970's B-movie stars; Chrisopher George, his wife Linda Day George, Leslie Nielsen, Michael Ansara, and Richard Jaeckel. The bad new is that they are given very little to do. Basically we get to see them hike through the woods for about 90 minutes, they occasionally run, but for the most part they simply hike...and hike....and hike. The film's premise is that a group of hikers gets stuck on a mountaintop just as the animals go into kill-the-people mode. Did I mention that the film consists of LONG segments where we get to see the hikers....hike?

""Day of the Animals"" is also hampered by the fact that the animals rarely attack our hikers. One camper gets ""attacked"" by a coyote, and suffers two scratches...which somehow disappear during her next scene when she is attacked by birds??? One star gets so fed up waiting for the animals to attack, he decides to attack a bear instead of waiting for the bear to make a move. So the animal attacks are few and far between and when an attack finally takes place it's kind of tame (the exception is one snake bite scene).

As a fan of this type of film, I can't recommend this movie, when there are so many other great B-movies available instead. Pick up ""Grizzly"" or ""The Legend of Boggy Creek"" is you want your 70's schlock, but give this one a pass.",1267401600,,1995,4.502762430939226

There are some scenes where hungry animals hit some residences of a town, while not an everyday thing, it's not unheard of.  And now I find out the base of why these attacks some thirty-two later and my memory is jogged somewhat to recall some sort of radiation of such that makes the animals go crazy.

So do we have animals bent of getting their revenge for all the garbage they have been putting up with, or are they unsuspecting victims of some chemical imbalance that causes them the go amok?  In the end as things ""return to normal"" I see a large pack of dogs that were pursuing a family now dead right in the path which the had been charging down.  In other places the animals ""return to normal"" or die off.

You would probably get just as much out of the movie itself watching it on one of the cable channels that have commercials since there's hardly anything that would be cut out.

1004903,4,6305280665,"As far as ""when animals attack""-type movies go, this one's actually pretty good. If ""Grizzly"" was William Girdler's ""Jaws"", this is probably his ""The Birds"". There are probably more shots of staring owls and vultures and other birds of prey in this film than any other in memory. But wait, there's more: a generous serving of tarantulas, snakes, big cats, bears, wild dogs, rats ... basically this film is Dr Doolittle's worst nightmare.

The plot (animals driven crazy by cosmic rays attack hikers) may sound simplistic, but at least Girdler cross-cuts between the different disaster-movie-type characters and their various subplots to maintain interest. (There's even a Shelley Winters clone.) He even manages to give a SLIGHTLY post-apocalyptic scope to the film, which is quite cool, with scenes of an abandoned town a la ""The Andromeda Strain"" and a deserted campsite whose occupants have obviously become lunch.

Media Blasters have done a very nice job with this DVD. While it lacks a commentary, it does at least offer a ""making of"" doco featuring interviews with surviving cast members (including Susan Backlinie, who became fish food at the start of ""Jaws""), an original trailer, and TWO versions of the same film, one a 1.85:1 television master, and the other a 2.35:1 theatrical reissue under the title ""Something Is Out There."" The latter version is a fairly beaten-up print, but there's a kind of grindhouse beauty to its dust, scratches and splotches, and the aspect ratio is my personal pick over the cleaner, yet cropped 1.85:1 version. Which version you choose to watch comes down to whether you prefer a cleaner print or the proper OAR. However, the 2.35:1 version is missing some snippets of dialogue in which Leslie Nielsen's character insults a Native American character, one of which seems to have been edited out with a chainsaw, so jarring is the jump cut.

William Girdler's composition and widescreen camerawork are excellent, and the editing's pretty good, too, especially in the frenzied animal attack scenes. The wilderness scenery is beautiful, too. Girdler could have gone on to become a solid genre director like Peter Hyams if he'd lived past 30. We can only imagine what he could have done with modern filmmaking equipment and visual effects, but alas, his career was snuffed out just as he was starting to hit his straps.

The acting is adequate for a film like this and while the dialogue is not exactly William Goldman, it's serviceable.

* Spoilers *

There are some pretty wild scenes in this film that you probably wouldn't see if a similar film was made today. Without giving too much away, expect leaping rats, Leslie Nielsen going ""Lord of the Flies"" and turning into a homicidal rapist/bear wrestler (an UNFORGETTABLE scene), and a scene in which several characters are being attacked by savage German Shepherds WHILST ON A RAFT FLOATING DOWN WHITEWATER RAPIDS. I watched that sequence wondering how on earth they filmed it. One poor character is attacked by wild dogs AND rattlesnakes SIMULTANEOUSLY. When you see stuff like that, you can't quite believe what you're seeing, but it's very entertaining nonetheless.

Gore-wise, this film is nowhere near Eli Roth-level, but it does have some claret splashed around here and there. Young kids probably wouldn't cope with it too well, but anyone over about 13 should be fine.

Overall, a good effort, and a movie worthy of sharing shelf space with other '70s/'80s creature features like ""Squirm"", ""Piranha"", ""Alligator"" and so on.",1182211200,22,3523,5.062068965517241

  Now almost 40(and proud to have made it past the atomic wars, bio-hazards, alien invasions,and the attack of the Bee Gees) I find that this little slice of environmental nightmare still holds a strange hold on me. Christopher George(the poor man's Charlton Heston) never looked tougher than he did here leading hikers down a mountain as the missing ozone(remember that) allowed cosmic rays to fry animals and human brains if you were to high up(talk about a rocky mountain high). Long before his rebirth as everyone's favorite goofy actor Leslie Nielsen gives us his turn as the jerk who wants to take over and becomes power mad(he even fights a bear)and it's so over the top that you can see why they cast him in ""Airplane"".

A group of hikers in the mountains have to fight to survive against the ozone crazed wildlife.  This time it's not just one species of animal that's pissed off(Frogs, The Swarm, Squirm, etc.), all the animals are pissed off!  Disney's Animal Kingdom's got nothing on this mountain for the true hardcore animal experience, though to it's credit,  Disney does have gorillas and the Dinosaur ride.  Unlike most films that feature a cast of annoying folks you'd love to see eaten by animals, there are actually a few characters here you grow to like.  Alot of them are familiar faces.  Richard Jaeckel from the Dirty Dozen, and of course, The Green Slime, Christopher George(who keeps his brains inside his head this time), Andrew Davis(the guy who's always screwing around with Shannon Tweed in those Night Eyes movies), and Leslie Nielsen.  What's cool is that the director gets live animals in the shot with the actors for the attack scenes instead of the old trick of animal stock footage intercut with an actor screaming.  One of the highlights is Nielsen.  This guy's been typecast since 1988, and it's nearly impossible to picture him as anything but a zany klutz.  The man can act when he wants to though.  It's a trip to see him as a psychopath and all around jerk.  He's actually convincing.  Of course anyone who's seen Creepshow knows that Leslie can be serious as a heart attack when he wants to.  I actually liked this movie more than I probably should have, so my high rating of the film might be a bit exaggerated.

Montoro. Premiering on May 13, 1977, the movie reunited stars Christopher George and Richard Jaeckel, director Girdler and producer Montoro from the previous year's hit film Grizzly.

SUMMARY: A nature-loving group of hikers set out on a two-week survival mission in the Sonora Pass area of California's High Sierras. As the group begins its trek, the animal population of the Sierras slowly congregates around them. One of them hears a news bulletin that scientists believe the earth's ozone layer has been depleted to a critical level with a warning of possible danger at higher altitudes. Therefore, begins the pursuit by the animals of the humans. The high drama and frightful tension will have you on the edge of your sea.

QUESTION: Can anyone survive The Day of the Animals?

It's not really dynamic but it is fun watching cougars running through Denver's suburbs scaring crossing guards, mailmen and dogs out of 10 years growth. Pity the poor hikers trapped in the woods when all this goes down. The best part though, is when crazed hiker Leslie Neilsen goes kamikazee against a murderous grizzly bear. He actually tries to bite the beasts ear off! Needless to say this is a very short,but entertaining scene.

Directed by William Girdler (Abby, Grizzly, The Manitou), the film stars, as I've already mentioned, Christopher George (Dixie Dynamite, Grizzly) and Leslie Nielsen (Airplane!, Prom Night, Creepshow).  Also appearing is Lynda Day George (""Mission: Impossible""), wife to lead actor Christopher George until his death in 1983, Richard Jaeckel (The Dirty Dozen, Grizzly), Michael Ansara (The Manitou), Ruth Roman (A Knife for the Ladies), Jon Cedar (Foxy Brown), Paul Mantee (The Great Santini), Susan Backlinie (Jaws), Walter Barnes (Pete's Dragon), and Andrew Stevens (The Fury, Death Hunt), certainly no stranger to the world of craptacular cinema.

The film begins with the display of text stating in 1974 some scientists discovered how the depletion of the ozone layer is allowing dangerous levels ultra violet rays to reach the Earth...and that the story about to be laid on us could actually happen if something isn't done to stop us from further damaging the protective shield surrounding our fragile planet.  Next we see a group of people preparing to go on a hiking trip, lead by Steve Buckner (George)...let's see...there's an ad executive named Paul Jensen (Nielsen), television anchorwoman Terry Marsh (George), Professor Taylor MacGregor (Jaeckel), a Native American named Daniel Santee (Ansara), recent divorcee' Mrs. Shirley Goodwyn (Roman) and her son, married couple (slightly estranged) Frank (Cedar) and Mandy (Backlinie) Young, ex-football star Roy Moore (Mantee), and Bob Denning (Stevens) and his girlfriend...quite a diverse group...anyway, the group are taken to an area up the mountain and dropped off, but little do they realize the brutal nightmare that awaits as the animals are mad as hell, and they're not going to take it anymore...oh yeah, it's go time...will they be able to get down the mountain without getting killed by the animals (or themselves)?  Even if they do, will there be a town left to escape to?  Let the fanged/clawed/beaked mayhem begin!

I'm no scientist (but I play one on TV), but this particular scenario in terms of the effect of ozone depletion seems pretty far-fetched...all the animals brains being cooked so that they turn on humans?  But, since this is a movie, I went along for the ride...and quite the boring one it was...we don't even get our first attack until about a half hour into the movie...and even then it wasn't fatal...bah...the first human death occurs about 36 minutes in, and was the result of Ms. Backlinie's character being attacked by birds...a side note, she was the first victim in the films Jaws (1974)...you know the one, the skinny dipping girlie?  As I said, the movie was fairly boring primarily because just when things would heat up, the flame would fizzle as the filmmakers subjected the audience to some lame and excruitiatingly pointless character development, you know, the touchy/feely crapola inherent in cruddy movies like this...the constantly complaining Jewish mother played by Roman was probably the worst...'Already my feet are killing me...a Danny Boone I'm not!'...oy vai!  And if Christopher and Lynda Day George were married in real life at the time (they were), you certainly wouldn't know it on the screen as there wasn't any chemistry...his character did try to put the make on her a few times...rather poorly.  I'm no Casanova, but heck, even I have better pick up skills than this goofus...oh, by the way, smart move taking a tour group deep into the woods and not carrying a weapon of some sort.  There was just too many characters to try and flesh them out they way they did, resulting in cumbersome sequences of relatively dead screen time between actual events.  Leslie Nielsen's arrogant, belligerent, antagonistic, racist character was fun to watch (count how many times he calls someone `hotshot'), especially once the stuff hit the fan and he began challenging Buckner over leadership of the group.  Eventually the group splinters into two, Buckner leading one and Jensen leading another...what's even better is when Nielsen's character really begins to lose it, heaping aggressions onto his meager band of followers until a large bear shows up...to which a bare-chested, deranged Nielsen proceeds grapple with the hairy beast (guess who wins?).  Overall the film is pretty much a mess, as it breaks down into three, separate stories for no reason whatsoever, causing a feeling of annoyance and unfocused direction, like someone was `winging' it...I wouldn't have minded it so much had the characters been interesting, but that wasn't the case.  There is some bloodshed and violence, but not as much as I would have expected.  The most worthwhile sequences feature, as I mentioned before, the ones that involve Nielsen (especially later on in the movie), but there was one other scene involving a man and flying rats in his kitchen...the man went to the kitchen in the middle of the night, removed a tray of food from the refrigerator, put it down for a few seconds, and when he came back it was covered in rats...and then the rats began jumping off the plate and onto his face...it looks pretty funny because it was obvious the rats were manipulated, perhaps with a string tied around them, to get the height the did...they appeared to fly.  And then there's the ending...what a fizzle, my nizzles, fo schizzle...there was one superior aspect about this film and that was the original music by legendary composer Lalo Schifrin.

The picture quality, presented in fullscreen (1.33:1), on this Nutech Digital Inc. DVD release isn't great, but it is watchable...the colors are a bit flat, and there's some aging evident.  The Dolby Digital 2.0 mono audio is about a good as the picture in that it is serviceable, but there were a couple of times I had difficulty in discerning the dialog.  There are no special features, not even a menu, as the film begins once placed in the DVD player, and it is comprised of three chapters.

1004981,4,6305280665,"A great cast of familiar faces make this above average viewing. It is great to see the talented Paul Mantee in one his best screen roles since the 1964 classic Robinson Crusoe On Mars. Likewise Michael Ansara, Richard Jaeckel and Ruth Roman.
For those used to seeing Leslie Nielsen the comedian, beware.
Also good are Christopher George and Lynda Day George.",1003536000,6,358,4.885245901639344
1004982,3,6305280665,"The plot: ozone deplition causes every animal in the world that lacks the ability to reason to go rabid and band together against humans-everything from rats and house pets like dogs to snakes and bears. This is especially bad for a group of hikers that have gone for a trek up in the hills, who happen to be out in the wilderness miles from civilization when the s--- hits the fan. First a woman is attacked and injured by a vicious leapord, and she and her lover split off from the main group to head back to town for medical attention. (This is before they've figured out all animals in the world are on the rampage.) Then we get two parrallel stories about what happens to the man and woman and what happens to the rest of the group. There is also a third story about what happens in town, as soldiers come in to evacuate the town in responce to the animal revolt. Meanwhile, the man and the injured woman are attacked by berserk birds, (can you say, ""Hichcock""?) and the woman is killed. The man escapes and later finds a little girl who seems to be the only survivor of her camping group. So then the rest of the film is about what happens to the main hicking group, what happens in town, and what happens to the man and the little girl as they desperatly search for help. I thought the latter story was particularly suspenceful, as I really cared about what happened to those two. Also, kudos to the film makers for including a charecter who is native american, but not steriotypical. Also I liked Leslie Neilson as a guy who starts out as a standard thorn in the side, but as the situation gets worse, begins to snap and become something of a menace himself.",981936000,,1666,4.377419354838709
1004983,4,6305280665,"I give the disc itself no stars. The distributors simply slapped Media Home Video's old transfer onto a disc with no chapter encoding or trailers or anything. Fooey. Also the film itself is not letterboxed, which is infuriating because it was shot in aspect ration 2:35:1, so you know what that means? People constantly talking to the edge of your television screen and painful moments where you watch an empty set while something is going on on the half of the screen image you can't see. The movie itself is an entertainingly silly drive-in ""disaster thriller"" about a group of hikers besieged by animals turned homicidal by the thinning of the ozone layer. A few of the animal attacks are actually quite nerve rattling while others are giggle inducing. Directer William Girdler fared better with his JAWS clone GRIZZLY (his previous film) and THE MANITOU (his next and, sadly, final film before his tragic death at age 30).",956707200,3,926,4.867088607594937
7886754,5,6305280665,"I remember this film when it came out in 1977 just a minute before another minor sci-fi film called Star Wars was released so all bets were off on this well made William gridler film that not only gives a legitimate reason for animals going berserk but ups the ante by throwing in just about every creature in nature forest. Wolfes, birds, rats, big cats all formidable foes introduced in earlier films as Ben, the birds, track of the cat etc corralled in one lethal army...classic! And not an easy task to take on as a movie maker as the included documentary talks about. Dvd version comes with both
The full screen television print and widescreen original rough print under the something is out there title.  I know its weird but Im a sucker for that
2:35.1 format and frankly even with all the clicks and pops it just adds to the true grindhouse experience for me.

7886759,3,6305280665,"So you bought Day of the Animals and now you have to decide which version of the film to watch. It's all a matter of personal preference.

Day of the Animals: Aspect ratio 1.85:1 (Television Version). By far the most pristine picture and sound of the two versions of the film. The downside: This version has been modified for TV, about 30% of the sides are cut off and you don't see the entire film. One example: At the beginning of the movie, two guys are talking in a close up shot. With the crop, you only see one of them on the screen the entire time, even when the other person is talking, he is now out of sight.

Something is Out There: Aspect ratio 2.35:1 (Original Theatrical Version). The picture and sound in this version is very poor in spots because of the original negative that was used for the transfer and there are even a couple of scenes where the picture jumps ahead a few seconds. After a short while, you get use to the quality of the film and it is enjoyable to watch. I prefer this version even though the picture and sound has not been remastered. Why? Because when you're viewing ""Something is out There"", you get more of the feel of watching a film in a 1970's movie theater. And I would still rather see the entire film with pops and scratches vs. only seeing 70% of the ""Day of the Animals"" version in a clean transfer.

It should be considered a crime when someone comes along and crops someone else's work just so it will fit on old TV sets that are no longer the standard aspect ratio. I hope this stupid practice ends!",1499558400,,1551,4.304794520547945

7886763,3,6305280665,"1976 brings us this predictable but still fun at times addition to the (at the time) popular genre of the world striking back at the horrible humans that are destroying the planet. This attack is being led by a hawk and his job is to pick off a group of 11 mountain hikers. He uses mountain lions, bears, birds etc. This is fun enough but the story is, as I said very predictable and the worst thing about this is the acting! And I mean by everyone...Christopher George and by extension his wife Linda Daye George both awful by themselves even worse together. And yes all the others are equally bad but the standout worst was (I hate to say this) Leslie Nielsen as the belligerent and wants to be the alpha guy who takes off with a group and then does terrible things to them.",1491436800,,776,4.321917808219178
