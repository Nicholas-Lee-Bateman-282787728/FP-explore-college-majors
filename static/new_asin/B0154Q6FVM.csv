8732631,3,B0154Q6FVM,"The video describes three work scenarios: I. a fret level with no fret crowning on a bolt-on neck II. a total refret on a bolt-on neck, and III. a refret on an acoustic guitar with binding on the fretboard. The video is from 2003 and all three scenarios use nickel-silver frets. There is no information about working with stainless steel fret wire, cutting a nut, or doing a setup.
You have to watch each section through and take careful notes because information is sometimes presented out of sequence when the instructor adds information that was omitted. Example: Hes sanding with a radius block using 400 grit sandpaper. Then he switches to 800 grit paper. After hes done with the 800 grit paper, he says that he reapplied marker ink to the top of the frets before he switched from 400 to 800 grit.

Mistake: At minute 13:40, Dan says hes using the fret leveling beam to sand *along the center line of the fretboard*, NOT along the string path, because its not a compound radius. Then at minute 15 hes sanding with a finer grit on the the same neck and says hes staying in line with those strings when he meant staying in line with the center of the fretboard. That mistake is confusing, doubt-inducing for beginners, and should have been edited out of the audio but wasnt.

In scenario I, he says that not much was taken off of the top of the frets in the leveling process, but in a close up of the frets at the end you can see that the tops are really flattened and square. I think those frets needed major crowning, but it could have been skipped because of the customers budget.

I found scenario II most informative for my immediate and long-term goals, with the best advice being to level the frets *before* you flush cut the fret ends against the edge of the fretboard. Otherwise you might run the leveler over the edges of the frets and round them over too much.

Scenario III is an acoustic refret and has good information on adjusting the tangs and barbs of nickel silver frets to fit fret slots well. It also tells you about protect the binding when using chemicals like acetone and when filing.

There are many different approaches to pressing in frets: (A) wet the slot beforehand with water or Naptha so the wood is softened and doesnt chip when the fret goes in (B) use white glue or hot hide glue in the slot as both a lubricant and an adhesive (C) press the fret into the bare wood and wick cyanoacrylate (CA) under the fret or pour it into the slot from the edge (D) apply CA to the bottom of a fret before pressing it in (E) use 20-minute-set epoxy in each slot before pressing in the fret. In this video, method C is used.

I recommend this video instead of the Fret Work Step-By-Step Erlewine book. That books small black and white pictures don't show you whats going on compared to this video. That book devotes a lot of space to esoteric examples (e.g. side-insertion of frets on old Fenders) at the expense of basic setup and other information which it explicitly and cheekily tells you to find in another Erlewine book: the Guitar Player Repair Guide.",1514592000,,3080,4.481283422459893
