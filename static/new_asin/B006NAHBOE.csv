8501312,5,B006NAHBOE,"As a Nanny, this set has proven to be a VALUEABLE tool! The programs repeat each word in different voices, have the word written on the screen, a sign language guide, and action scenes to describe each word. There is a silly pirate, whom really gives the litte girl I take care of ( and myself ) the giggles. I strongly reccomend this to help your children develop their vocabulary!",1452816000,2,382,4.4714285714285715
