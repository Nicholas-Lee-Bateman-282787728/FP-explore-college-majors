8296800,5,B001E6RDVI,"This is a snapshot of dinosaur fun 'facts' which is suitable for 7 year-olds.  The children enjoy it immensely and never tire of having it repeated. The graphics are humourous and compelling. It is brilliant for the beginning, middle or ending of any young children's project on Prehistoric Animals.  A good find and well worth the money.",1251590400,,338,4.912280701754386
