8615729,4,B00FGYIK7K,"Beyond the very clean prose, the author develops clear relationships among the characters.  Some good guys, some bad guys, and some both like most of us.  One hated reading the tragic sections, but Crayola portrays the inevitability of these outcomes very sympathetically, not just efficiently.  I really enjoyed this book and was disappointed at not getting to see the film.  I'll order it on Netflix soon.",1397606400,,407,5.121212121212121
8615730,4,B00FGYIK7K,"I have read many books about WWII and the Holocaust. I like that this one is told from the perspective of a German who did not stand with Hitler. I also enjoyed ""hearing"" death speak so compassionately about its victims.",1396137600,3,220,4.525
