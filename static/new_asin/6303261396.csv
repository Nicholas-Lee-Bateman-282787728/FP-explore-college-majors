617951,2,6303261396,"This video was poorly filmed with either the camera being too low on the coaster train, the lighting too dark to even see the coaster track, and two coasters, Wild Thing and the Great Nor'easter were filmed with a special  color and in slow motion which ruined the effect.  What were the producers  or film makers thinking?  If they make a third coaster video, I hope they  do not film it like this one, otherwise I will not buy it.",919814400,,432,4.35

618064,4,6303261396,"Well, since it is the 2nd of this series (as far as I know)I think they were still trying to work out the 'bugs' from the first video, ""Roller Coaster Thrills"" (which I thought should've been 'cut' a LOT better BTW & assuming these videos are related too of course). This video was great as far as having a great number & variety of coasters plus background info on them as well. I thought the hosts did a fine job except for the stupid supposedly 'humorus' parts where Eric was 'teasing' Lisa, it really took away from the video--if they would've left that out it would've been better, also, on virtually every coaster was the SAME scream track--it was SOOO annoying, just having a good music background would've been fine. The ""special effects"" on Nor'ester & Wild Thing--VERY annoying & unneccessary! I, apparantly, rec'd different 3D glasses (mine have lenses different colors than other posters stated) so the 3D effect was pretty good but still looked fine w/o. All in all, it's a good video having 2 views of every coaster except The Beast. It shows 2 coasters, Drachan Fire & Steel Phantom (RIP)  which I never got to ride so I'm glad to at least have this to experience them. All in all, it's a great video to have for the coasters (for me anyway). I watch it a LOT! (I have VHS btw.)",1150675200,,1293,4.502127659574468

It is very disappointing!!!!",1148774400,4,53,4.3
618066,2,6303261396,"What can you say about highly touted 3d effects from a coaster video when the best 3d in the whole show comes form the swings and the carousel? You got ripped,that's what. The Show itself is a pleasant enough kid friendly account about the fastest and tallest coasters at the time but it rarely goes in depth about anything especially the 3d. The Pulfrich system of grey and clear lenses makes anything that moves from left to right 3d to a degree so save the glasses for sports shows and what not untill your bored with them but the coaster film to be shot in true 3D has yet to be made.

Dukey",1125273600,3,595,4.265486725663717
618067,3,6303261396,"Fourteen of America's best roller coasters (at least one is now defunct). I mainly bought this because it has my all time fave coaster on it, The Beast. I found several things wrong with it however.
The hosts are very annoying. If you've ever watched the ""Dinosaurs"" documentaries, you will remember Eric Boardman. I thought he sucked as a host for the Dinosaurs shows and he sucks even worse as a roller coaster show host.
The cameras did not carry you all the way through the rides on several of the coasters. Like, the car would go down the hill, and just as it was coming out of the tunnel (ie The Beast) they pulled the camera away and showed it coming out. Way disappointing.
The non exsistent 3-D. Like several other reviewers have said, there was barely any difference between with the glasses or without the glasses.
Annoying guys who seemed to be on EVERY SINGLE COASTER FEATURED who screamed non stop throughout the entire ride and cheesy music playing in the background.
Now the good things:
Interviews with Ron Toomer, one of the designers for Arrow Dynamics, the company who built alot of these coasters.
Interview with Ray Eubrough(sp?) the president of the American Coaster Enthusiasts (at least he was at the time this was filmed)
The statistics of all the coasters featured and, if it didn't show the ride all the way through, an idea of how the ride goes.
At least during the winter I can still watch this and attempt to pretend I'm riding my fave. Overall a good documentary if you can't get to an amusement park anytime soon to REALLY ride and good to tide you over through the winter months.",1088553600,6,1613,4.604166666666667
618068,1,6303261396,"I was anticipating a 3D experience with the roller coaster rides and I was disappointed.  The commentary by the presenters before the coaster ride was irritatingly long.  The 3D effects were minimal and sometimes not noticeable at all.  I put the glasses on my mother, and she couldn't see any difference between 2D and what was supposed to be 3D. There were some wildlife shots which proved to be more effective in 3D.  If one is to compare this 3D movie with something like IMAX, then don't. I tried the CD on a wide flatscreen 32"" TV and also on my computer monitor.  Neither gave the 3D effect I was expecting. A waste of money.",1034035200,5,632,4.460869565217391
618069,2,6303261396,"This video brings you fourteen Roller Coasters from all over the United States. The film had its drawbacks and some good features but not many. The good qualities: excellent car-mounted picture quality of the front row of most of the coasters, wide range of coasters shown, and interesting narrative. The bad qualities: Why anyone would want to film an indoor Roller Coaster (in the dark) is beyond me (if you want to see the exact same coaster, but outside, see the third video in this series), two of the coasters had post-production movement shadows added, which really [messed] up the entire trip, Mantis never really had the front-car view, and the ?3-D? features are non-existent.",1014940800,6,686,4.973913043478261

The quality of the video- and adiosignals on that dvd are definitely not worth to be mentioned at all; are they even digital??? The technology is much farer than this dvd offers, and the rides in the front cab aren't even full-length, only too often there are cuts, so that ""america's greatest roller coasters"" are NO thrill to look at, at least not on that dvd. By the way, is there ANYbody out there who could frankly say the 3d-effect works???

618110,5,6303261396,"This video is just too cool! I got it from a library and I didn't care that I never saw it in 3-D. IT IS COOL! I really love watching Magnum XL-200. I don't like riding coasters, but I like watching coaster videos. Only one thing is bad about it, and that thing is, like in every coaster you hear a man say ""ye hee!"" I just don't get it. I do think they put to much videotaping of Viper. I've always wanted to go to Busch Gardens and I like Kumba.
It is so real, my sister said she felt sick watching it! She has a pair of 3-D glasses she snuck from KSC but she couldn't find 'em.

618111,3,6303261396,"I watched this video for the first time over a year ago, and I have to say that it could have been a LOT better.  I'd like to state a couple disavantages to this DVD that could have been prevented:
1)  I don't know which TV the glasses included work best for.  They didn't really work for mine.
2)  The sound editors used the same sound effects over and over on almost every ride.  I say, that can be irritating.  You'll know what I'm talking about when you see this.
3)  The quality of the video isn't quite perfect either, at least on a few coasters.  At least they didn't show the whole ride on Kumba from front row.  Overall, the video is average.
Overall, this DVD is OK; still recommended for hardcore coaster fans.
Well, God Bless!",983750400,,738,4.2898550724637685

618113,4,6303261396,"For anyone who enjoys roller coaster rides this is a must. Apart from the hosts overacting in some scenes, this is an enjoyabe video. The use of 3D is great as far as the pulfrich system is concerned and, great to watch in  2D. The sound is good and the view from the inside of the car is good. The  choice of roller coasters in the video is excellent. More attention could  have been given to the start and end of the rides. Overall this is an  excellent addition to anyones video collection and really worth buying.",961113600,4,517,4.298969072164948
618114,3,6303261396,"This DVD will probably be of most interest to folks who are already roller coaster enthusiasts.  The 3-D effects are limited, however: the Pulfrich 3-D glasses which are provided achieve their optimum effect when foreground  objects move horizontally.  When the viewer climbs on board in this video  for a ride with a subjective point of view, the movement is forward, rather  than from one side of the screen to another.  The effects are much more  striking when the camera takes an objective point of view, watching the car  from an observer's point of view.",960076800,2,560,4.882978723404255
618115,4,6303261396,"In my newfound fanaticism of rollercoasters, this is the first rollercoaster video I bought. I have to say that I am satisfied, but people who are not coaster enthusiasts will not be pleased with the video.
The  video quality is very inconsistent. When the lighting is right, the  resolution of DVD really makes the coasters look good; however, the  lighting is far too often lacking, such as when they filmed a coaster at  sundown or night, or when they decided to add The Outer Limits to the video  (an indoor dark coaster just doesn't show up very well). There also appears  to be some glitches (more specifically, a thick line at the bottom of the  screen-this could be limited to my copy though), but they are not  distracting.
The sound in this video is merely mediocre. It is in  stereo, not Dolby Digital, so if you are buying this video as a showcase  for your surround-sound system, you will want to pass. The music is decent,  and doesn't detract from the experience. The actual sounds of the coasters  rolling and the people screaming are well done. Overall, the sound isn't  bad, but I would love to hear a coaster roaring by in Dolby Digital  5.1.
The 3D glasses added a little to the video, but not much. They don't  really make a difference either way, so it's your call.
The best part of  this video is its selection of coasters (I will use brackets [] to separate  each coaster):  The Comet at Great Escape, Lake George, NY [] The Great  Nor'Easter at Morey's Pier, Wildwood, NJ [] The Great White at Morey's  Pier, Wildwood, NJ [] Grizzly at Paramount's King's Dominion, Doswell, VA  [] The High Roller on the Stratosphere Tower, Las Vegas, NV [] Jack Rabbit  at Kennywood, Pittsburgh, PA [] Loch Ness Monster at Busch Gardens,  Williamsburg, VA [] Mantis at Cedar Point, Sandusky, OH [] Montu at Busch  Gardens, Tampa, FL [] Outer Limits Flight of Fear at Paramount's King's  Dominion, Doswell, VA [] The Phoenix at Knoebels, Elysburg, PA [] The Raven  at Holiday World, Santa Clause, IN [] Timberwolf at Worlds of Fun, Kansas  City, MO [] Wild Thing at Valleyfair, Scakopee MN.
As you can see, the  selection is excellent.
My main complaint with this video is the computer  effects added to The Great Nor'Easter and Wild Thing. They detract from the  experience to the extent that these two on-ride videos are unwatchable.  Notwithstanding, the rest of the coasters on the video make up for this  flaw and as long as Goldhil doesn't do this again, they are forgiven.
In  summary, this DVD is for rollercoaster fans only.",954892800,7,2541,4.650900900900901
618116,3,6303261396,"This is a fun documentary to watch..... once. Don't expect IMAX or so. Nevertheless, the final chapter (Front car center) brings you the whole tour summarized as 18 or so rides from the passenger's view, which will  surely delight your kids every now and then. The 3D effect works only  sometimes and the video quality is irregular. Be aware that this is not  stuff for dvd maniacs but for kids.",949881600,2,395,4.614285714285714

Aside from the great first- and third-person coaster footage, there's not much to recommend.  The hosts are idiotic, the fake  ""speedometer"" is insulting, the fake screams are irritating, the  music is awful, and the interviews are boring.

618193,4,6303261396,"This is a great video.  I own it.  This video shows rides like Raptor, Drachen Fire, Viper, Kumba, and even Steel Phantom.  The video comes with 3-D glasses that aren't very affective.  Before each ride it shows you all  of the statistics.  It has an interview with the amazing designer Ron  Toomer.  Most of the coasters in the video are made by the greatest  designers Bolliger and Mabillard.  I have ridden 5 of the coasters featured  and I love them all.  I suggest you get the second version of the video  because it has newer coasters like Mantis wich is one of my personal  favorites.",945907200,,591,4.504761904761905

I would have liked it more if they had shown more cockpit shots instead of filling it up with mostly shots from  the ground.  The soundtrack is actually the worst part about this disk.  I  actually turned off the sound and turned on some Chemical Brothers while  watching.  Pretty fun, but not worth buying.",944092800,2,416,4.527027027027027
618195,1,6303261396,"I was prepared to enjoy this title, having wanted something like this for quite some time. There is very little here of interest to me, though. I was  looking for first person footage of some interesting coasters. There was a  little of this, and the rest was simply set-up and background dribble. I  assume most viewers are looking to experience the coasters. Not the parks,  not the scenery. Just the thrill of being in the first car.
The other  major problem is that the equipment used to shoot this video blacks out for  two seconds when going from very dark (a tunnel) to very light (sun) and  vice versa. This is the result you or I would get with our home video  equipment -- not what you would expect from a professional production. My  search for a good, first person coaster video continues.

Instead, you will get a decent, though now outdated, documentary on various top coasters of the early 1990s.  I do agree the hosts are not all that great, being that their dialog is clearly scripted instead of free-flowing on-the-moment acting.  But, putting that aside, you do get a good doco on the coasters with on-ride views.  First of the host and passengers, then a forward view from the first car.  Sadly, for a DVD that claims to have ""Thrills in 3-D"", there isn't any.  You get two sets of Pulfrich glasses, which rely on fast movement to give the dimensional affect.  There is plenty of that, but no depth whatsoever.  You get a better, and much more enjoyable, Pulfrich 3D in the relaxation film, Pure Pleasure 3-D.  It can be found here: http://www.amazon.com/Pure-Pleasure-3D-Thomas-Blakeslee/dp/B00015YWA8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1328401841&sr=8-1.  Also, the picture quality of this coaster disc is not DVD worthy in clarity.  Looks more like a VHS-to-disc conversion, which is probably what it is.  In short, if you want a decent coaster documentary for your archive, then this DVD is worth having since some of the coasters on it are gone now.  But don't buy this DVD for any 3D and image clarity viewing.  For the best in coaster DVDs, get the six Theme Park Review discs called ""Coasters In The Raw"".",1328313600,,1446,4.99581589958159
