8672764,5,B00MJDE6C4,"I love The Avengers, and Diana Rigg. It is awesome to be able to get this on Blu Ray. The quality is excellent. If only I could figure out how to turn off French subtitles, although I am using them to expand my French vocabulary. Be sure to buy a code free Blu Ray player. I wonder why so many excellent Blu Ray titles are not available here. Now I have the complete season 4 and 5. I wonder if Diana Rigg was in season 3 and if that will become available on Blu Ray.",1452556800,,467,3.9263157894736844
