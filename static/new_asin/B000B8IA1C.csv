2408695,5,B000B8IA1C,My husband has been looking for this movie for years.  I found it on Amazon and he is thrilled.,1199664000,,95,4.0
2408696,5,B000B8IA1C,"I bought this DV sight-unseen from Amazon. I certainly got my money's worth of laughs. The acting is great, the costumes are great -- I just love every minute of it and have watched it a number of times and shared it with friends.

The hypocritical self-appointed guardians of other people's morality should be afraid -- very afraid. There's nothing like the sheer pleasure of making your enemies look ridiculous.

You'll laugh for centuries!",1190419200,,442,4.95945945945946
2408697,5,B000B8IA1C,"the dvd was in excellent condition and the movie was so funny,it started out funny and ended funny. you didn't want to get up in case you missed something.",1168473600,,155,4.379310344827586
2408698,4,B000B8IA1C,"I looked for this movie for years on dvd and bought it the minute I saw it had been released.  There are many lessons to be learned in this seemingly lowkey farce.  Let's just say that Barbara Carrera could show some current ""religious leaders"" a thing or two about hypocrisy and forgiveness.",1168128000,,292,4.596153846153846
2408699,5,B000B8IA1C,"Very well written and acted campy take on the early salem Mass. witch trials. Using the as of yet untested talents of some promising unknowns including
""police acadamy's ""tackleberry"" and also the mayor a star on ""saving grace"" . Bawdy raunchy comedy at it's naughty best.",1022112000,9,272,4.934782608695652
2408700,5,B000B8IA1C,"This is probably the funniest movie that I have ever seen.  One laugh right after another and array of characters as unique and hilarious as could be imagined.  Never have the Salem Witch hunts been explained in such an irreverent manner.  One of those  ""wait,wait, rewind it, I have to see that again"" movies.
It will have you laughing long after the movie has ended and it will be one that you watch over and over and never get tired of seeing.  Buy this movie and you will be glad you did.  Laugh a minute belly laughs.  Share it with your friends.",1020470400,9,551,4.3431372549019605
2408701,3,B000B8IA1C,"If you like silly, zany, 2nd city type laughs, then this movie is for you.  The comedy was relentless.  Everywhere you looked, there was a subplot that was almost as engaging as the main plot.  The part that got to me the most was when Ann Ramsey did her brief cameo at the end.  She appears as the real witch and tells the Salemites that they are idiots.  Her point was that a real witch would never have allowed the type of treatment that the town became famous for.  The irony was rich.",1018656000,6,489,4.204301075268817
2408702,5,B000B8IA1C,I had rented this sleeper movie decades ago and came across it again online.  My brand of humor.,1425859200,,96,4.333333333333333

2408705,4,B000B8IA1C,This is a fairly humorous look at the Salem witch trials with a good cast. The film does have an adult theme to it so be aware before allowing kids to watch it.,1374969600,,160,3.878787878787879
2408706,4,B000B8IA1C,"One of those buried ""video treasures"" of sorts, this wacky, ribald parody of the Salem Witch trials was initially produced by DeLaurentiis Entertainment Group before o'l Dino's fledgling DEG Studio went belly up. Like ""Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure,"" ""Love At Stake"" -- originally titled ""Burnin' Love"" -- had to find another home, and that it did thanks to Hemdale Film Corporation and Tri-Star Pictures, who bought the picture and released it to theaters in April, 1988.

Autumn, though, is the better time of year to get into the crazy shenanigans of this little-known gem: a Mel Brooks-ian parody appropriately produced by Michael Gruskoff, who also produced Brooks' classic ""Young Frankenstein.""

""Love At Stake"" is a movie very much in the vein of the Brooks/Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker school of comedy: a sight-gag filled affair set in 1692 New England. Patrick Cassidy plays Miles, a divinity student who returns home to find his childhood sweetheart (Kelly Preston) and his hometown of Salem in seemingly fine Colonial condition...that is, until incompetent mayor Dave Thomas and scheming judge Stuart Pankin opt to steal land -- and create the first-ever ""Puritan Village Mall for over-sexed teenagers"" -- by accusing innocent townspeople of witchcraft. Little do they know, however, that a real witch has arrived in town in the form of curvaceous Barbara Carrera, who sits idly by (for a while at least) and watches the shenanigans ensue.

Former Saturday Night Live writers Terry Sweeney and Lanier Laney collaborated with Gruskoff and director John Moffitt (a long-time TV comedy vet) for ""Love At Stake,"" an inspired lark that's ridiculous from the opening and proceeds to reach actual heights of hilarity at various spots throughout the movie. I first saw the picture in high school and recall laughing so hard that I had to stop the tape once or twice. Obviously, the movie's humor can be juvenile at times, but even now, as an adult, ""Love At Stake"" still tickles the funny bone: the inquisition sequence (with its cameo by Dr. Joyce Brothers) is uproarious, the court-appointed jester who sounds like Don Knotts is consistently amusing, the antics between Pankin and Thomas are often riotous, while the church-going flatulence scene with the late David Graf (aka Tackleberry from ""Police Academy"") still ranks as a classic moment in unseen comedy cinema history.

Also adding to the fun is the movie's anachronistic tone, including a first-ever Thanksgiving between the colonists and the local Indians, and numerous references to old movie cliches. Technically, the film is surprisingly polished: the production design by Roy Forge Smith and cinematography by Mark Irwin seriously evoke the real-life Sturbridge Village of old New England. Charles Fox's pleasant orchestral score, meanwhile, adds just the right amount of seriousness for the comedy to bounce off.

This Thanksgiving, if you're looking for an irreverent comedy to counteract the sentimental offerings on the tube, do yourself a favor and pick up ""Love At Stake."" MGM/Sony's DVD offers a 16:9 enhanced transfer that looks lightyears better than my ancient, worn-out laserdisc, plus a modest Dolby Digital mono soundtrack. Extras aren't on-hand, but I can't believe at long last that I'm typing an actual DVD review of ""Love At Stake"" in the first place -- so no complaints from these quarters. Highly recommended!",1346371200,2,3395,5.256457564575646
2408707,1,B000B8IA1C,I have not purchased this product. Don't know why Amazon says I recommend it. I can't recommend something I haven't seen.,1318118400,,121,4.809523809523809
2408708,2,B000B8IA1C,"What an odd comedy, lampooning the Salem Witch Trials...a bit late in the day for that type of social commentary (so they tried to tie it to a picture of Nixon briefly shown during a trial sequence?).  Not funny by half: crotch jokes and manure jokes are for the desperate.  There's a reason this movie didn't last long in theaters nor did it become an underground cult favorite.  Its humor is old and forlorn.
Not a keeper.  (But I'm not sorry I watched it this once.  I did laugh a couple of times but I can't remember at what.)",1300492800,,530,4.313131313131313
2408709,1,B000B8IA1C,"Yikes. Not so fantastic. The addvert for Monty Python's Holy Grail before the feature came on was better. Spent my time amusing myself with the vague notion the lead was a young David Hasselhoff with about as much acting cred as demonstrated (which was zero). Kept waiting for them to break out into song for some reason: maybe a musical would have helped it along? Or possibly another movie? Probably not though. Had to watch a repeat of something on TV with addverts afterwards, just to lift my mood enough to go to sleep.
Out of five, half. Of one. That's 0.5/10

The second reason... some of the old cast from SCTV put a laughable spin on the situation. Who's paying attention to the real cuplprits behind the madness?",1449273600,,296,4.60377358490566
