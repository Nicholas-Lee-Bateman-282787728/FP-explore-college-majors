8336500,5,B001QV6KL0,My daughter and I just love this version of A Midsummer's Night Dream.  It's what got my daughter hooked on Shakespeare at the young age of 10,1525305600,,142,4.2592592592592595

8336502,4,B001QV6KL0,"I have seen at least six productions of ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" on film, and unlike the earlier reviewer, I revel in all the different interpretations people have made of the play, from the lavish 1935 Hollywood version to a long, virtually amateur production made in the arid southwest. Each seems to emphasize a different aspect of the play, and reveal something about it.

Even thought the ""Mechanicals"" sub-plot is just that, a diversion from the main action, what people may not realize is that Bottom the weaver has more likes than any other character (22% of all lines). So, if Bottom is not played well, it will color the whole play. And, in this production, Bottom is not realized as well as others have done, especially the remarkable performance by James Cagney in the 1935 release.

This is unfortunate, since I believe the opening scenes, which send Hermia and Lysander into the woods, are done better than in many other productions, even the recent Hollywood version with Kevin Kline as Bottom. But I also think this scene's version of Puck is weak, compared to the two Hollywood extremes played by a very young Mickey Rooney or a very wise Stanley Tucci, with horns.",1374019200,4,1185,4.803921568627451
8336503,5,B001QV6KL0,"Of the many versions of ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" I have seen, this wonderful production  is the one most true to the spirit of Shakespeare's beloved comedy.
 I want to compliment the director of this play. So many directors take silly liberties with Shakespeare and let their oversized egos override the script they have in front of them. They feel required to present their  ""unique vision"" of Shakespeare. What then becomes important is the director, not the play. The results, almost always, are bad productions being extolled as a ""new and daring interpretation"" of the Bard.
The director of this fine production, to his everlasting credit, stays true to the play, and the result is a magical production I know William Shakespeare would be proud of.
Performed with Elizabethan costumes, beautiful sets, and wonderful lighting, the actors have the perfect environment to bring to life the magic, beauty, and mystery the play evokes.
The acting is superb, and all performers are to be complimented for their fine ensemble work. The lighting is hauntingly beautiful, the music weaves its own fairy magic, and the beauty of this most performed of Shakespeare's plays is presented in all its glory.
I hope this DVD will become available again, as it deserves to be seen and enjoyed by as many people as possible. It is what excellent theater should be.
I have directed four high school productions of ""Dream,"" and I have always used this show as a guide and inspiration. It never let me down.
The play is currently available as part of the BBC Shakespeare boxed set series. The five play comedy set contains ""Dream."" I have only watched one other production in the set and that was ""The Tempest."" It was an outstanding production starring the magnificent Ralph Richardson as Prospero. His performance is another reason it is worth buying the set. So, you might think about purchasing it if you're a lover of Shakespearean theater.
If you want Shakespeare at his best, give this marvelous production a chance. These ""shadows"" won't offend; they will give you a sterling show.",1243123200,9,2076,4.9426934097421205
