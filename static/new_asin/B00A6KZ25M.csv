8547001,5,B00A6KZ25M,I am partial to workouts by Virginia Nicholas because she truly gives some of the best verbal cues in the industry and this DVD is no exception.  Such creative use of a barely used prop for anything other than sitting on.  This is a nice change from the classic Pilates routine.,1399852800,2,278,4.431372549019608
