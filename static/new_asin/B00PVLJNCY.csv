8689466,5,B00PVLJNCY,The subtitles were great. I would rate it PG-13.  The main character is a descendent of Ciel Phantomhive. And there is also a descendent of Mey-Rin. But not the other servants. But Sebastian is the same Sebastian as the one in the anime and manga.,1464912000,,247,4.488888888888889

8689468,5,B00PVLJNCY,"I love this movie! I watched it with my husband, and now he wants to watch the anime with me! <3 It's not a perfect match to the manga, or anime, but what live-action film ever has been? It does a great job with the Kuroshitsuji concept, and is overall really good! We liked that Shiori is a female descendant of Ciel, and a couple of the servants are implied to be descendants of the manga's characters, as well.",1443571200,3,413,4.2405063291139244
