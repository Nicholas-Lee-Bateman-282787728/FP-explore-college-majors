Many of these Universal Hammer titles are available on Blu in the UK, or are coming soon over there, so get yourself a region free player and order from overseas since Universal dropped the ball in the States.

6453525,5,B00KXQL6CW,"There are two editions of THE HAMMER HORROR SERIES floating around.  I bought my edition about two years ago; it does NOT say '8-Film Collection', nor does it list the eight on the front (even though it does have the SAME films listed on the reverse side), including one of my favorites, THE BRIDES OF DRACULA, which, I'm happy to report is in the correct 1.66 theatrical ratio, with narrow black bands on a 16:9 wide-screen telly, and looking like a very good transfer -something just a bit short of a good Blu-Ray disk (and, let's face it, all Blue-Ray disks DON'T deserve to use that title!).

My DVD set is also for Region 1, but it has two disks, NOT four!  Two films per side, and all of them, excluding BRIDES, are either 1:85 or wider (2:00 or 2:35).  I suppose that the quality of each film MIGHT have been slightly better if each movie had the the full use of one side of a DVD, but even most film buffs, I'm certain, would have difficulty spotting the difference.  Sorry, but I didn't have the time to re-check the quality of the other titles, but I see no reason why Universal would've skipped on them.

P.S. The region 2 Blu-Ray is excellent, but has been cropped a little.  Just a little.  The 1:66 film has been cropped to 1:78 to fit a 16:9 TV without any black bands.  Although I, personally, prefer films to be released in their theatrical ratio, this cropping was, strangely, not objectionable to me.  (perhaps, because it was replacing a 4:3 cropped DVD?)",1489622400,,1475,4.470149253731344

6453549,4,B00KXQL6CW,"It's difficult to imagine a Hammer collection of this size with no titles featuring Christopher Lee, but the presence of Peter Cushing and Oliver Reed in many of the films included makes up for this omission. The color films in the set look very good, with the colors crisp and penetrating in the Hammer style. I mention this because I have several other Hammer titles released at different times that appear somewhat washed out.
While these are not the films one tends to think of at first blush if one is a Hammer fan, the stories all feature interesting plots that are well carried out. I have always thought Evil of Frankenstein to be given less credit than it deserves in the Frankenstein series. On the other hand, the climax of Paranoic plays as forced and happens suddenly without providing a clear resolution.",1451779200,6,818,4.7272727272727275
6453550,4,B00KXQL6CW,"I saw all of these as a kid in the 1960s, as afternoon TV staples.  About half of these are monster films (various vampires, one frankenstein, one wereworf) and the rest are kind of suspense horror films (Phantom of the Opera was the only one I remembered).  WHile the vampire films were second tier - not a single Christopher Lee one and based on abruptly ending formulas - I hugely enjoyed the frankie and werewolf ones, which had interesting variations in them, e.g. the werewolf's origin was not getting bitten, but a combination of a violent impregnation and the birth on Christmas day.  I have a soft spot for the Evil of Frankenstein, which I saw with my dad and remembered vividly, though objectively, it is relatively weak.  Finally, I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the  suspense horror films, all of which kept me guessing to the end.  In particular, I found Paranoiac to be especially fun - I had no idea how it would turn out (i.e. who was bad, who was controlling things, what their agendas were, etc.).

One of the reasons I got this collection is to see a young Oliver Reed, who is in 3 of the films.  His acting was wonderful (he is even a good guy in one), though of course Peter Cushing is also excellent.  I particularly enjoyed Cushing as the mysterious vicar in a period piece, which didn't stop him from belting an intruder and facing down some rough sailors from the King's Navy (loosely based on Dr. Syn resisting impressment).

If you are a Hammer fan, this is a wonderful collection, if only for nostalgia's sake.  Of course, my kids didn't grow up with these and think they're stupid and crude, which in a way they are.  Warmly recommended.",1449360000,11,1673,4.54

The discs are single sided (four discs with two films per single sided disc) and both films on each disc fits on a DVD-9 quiet nicely (instead of the older double sided two disc set) and the images are somewhat better too (still bad shimmering on ""Nightmare""). I had to chunk the old two sided set because three of the movies were freezing up or pausing and it just got frustrating trying to get them to play. This new set is the way to go.

This 4 DVD set to me is excellent , The Brides of Dracula and Curse of the werewolf look great in picture quality . Night creatures has a snowy light grain when it starts in the beginning but goes away and the remaining movie looks very good . The Evil of Frankenstein is a very nice picture as well. I have not watched the other films on this set though I am happy with the picture quality of this new release . These are older movies and they look very nice in this new DVD collection. I know there are perfectionists out there on picture quality but I had Blu-rays that look like VHS like Clash of the Titans and others than any of these films.

As far as the content, this is an excellent collection of Hammer films.  Each one has a compelling story and displays that signature Hammer atmosphere and sensibility.  There are no special feature, but the transfers look fine and the video and audio quality is strong in each of the films.  I hope more Hammer titles get released in a similar fashion.

BUT let me be clear:  these are different transfers and totally LACK the razor sharp images and deep, lush color saturation the previous edition had.  And unfortunately, the 2 features that looked the best on the older set, BRIDES OF DRACULA and KISS OF THE VAMPIRE, fare the worst, suffering from muted, off color and a softer, less sharp image.

So if this is of less consequence to you and the stories and content and the classic status of these films overrule, then by all means dive in.......",1411171200,10,682,4.697478991596639

I have the old DVD18 set and both EVIL OF FRANKENSTEIN and CURSE OF THE WEREWOLF are unplayable.  At least that was about 2 years ago when I tried to play them.  Now, who knows if any will play?
I would like to think that Universal would be willing to replace that set with this new set.  If they would set up such a program, I would change this to a 5 star rating.  If they had put this out on Blu Ray, I would not even have mentioned this.
Unlike another poster here, I think there are some very important Hammer Horror films in this set.

8662520,1,B00KXQL6CW,"I ordered this set on June 2 and received it today.  First I realized that the product cover (front and back) are completely different than what's advertised in this listing.  The front may look similar but look closer.

Also, the product I received was released in 2005, whereas the one listed here is 2014.

Also, the product listed is 4 discs that are ONE-SIDED.  The ones I received are 2 discs that are FLIPPER discs.

It seems Amazon still stocks and still ships the outdated version that so many complained about due to skipping/freezing/pixelation issues common to flipper discs.  WTF?!?

Also - and this is partly due to my own ignorance - only three of the eight movies are in their original aspect ratio (OAR).  I say my ignorance because I thought these were all 1.66:1 OAR movies but they're all different.  What matters most though is that five out of eight are wrong.

Brides of Dracula: OAR is 1.85:1, this disc is 1.66:1 (boo)
Curse of the Werewolf: OAR is 1.85, disc is 1.85:1 (yay)
Phantom of the Opera: OAR is 1.85:1, disc is 2.0:1 (boo)
Paranoiac: OAR is 2.35:1, disc is 2.35:1 (yay)
Kiss of the Vampire: OAR is 1.66:1, disc is 1.85:1 (boo)
Nightmare: OAR is 2.55:1, disc is 2.35:1 (boo)
Night Creatures: OAR is 1.85:1, disc is 2.0:1 (boo)
Evil of Frankenstein: OAR is 1.85:1, disc is 1.85:1 (yay)

So there you have it.  Very disappointing.  The silver lining is that the disc case with its cardboard foldout and great artwork is very attractive, and at least none of the aspect ratio discrepancies are egregious (i.e. a 2.35:1 OAR shown in 1.85:1).  Better close than butchered completely.  But STILL!!!

Can anyone confirm the aspect ratios of the 2014 release I was supposed to get?  If those are all correct, I definitely want a refund AND the proper product.  If they're all the same as mine, I should still seek a refund because of the flipper aspect but would probably just accept it.

I've tried to swear off Amazon as much as possibly, buying direct when I can and through other retailers when I can't.  If anyone knows where I can get the correct version at a reasonable price, please let me know.

FWIW all the audio tracks are 2.0 mono as advertised (192 kbps) and the video bitrates come in at healthy 5.6 Mbps.  I wasn't worried about their being two movies per disc because the run times are shorter than today's movies and the lossy audio gives more room for the video.",1528070400,2,2407,4.585480093676815
