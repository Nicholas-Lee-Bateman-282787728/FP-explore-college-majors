It covers the rainbow of fruits and vegetables, including the types of nutrition you can expect from each color in the spectrum.  It's good to have on hand when you want to cover other topics, and gives people something to review and learn at their own pace.  Good product!.",1362441600,2,349,4.421875

8248809,4,B00132FDHY,"I am probably a bit bias as I'm an IIN alumni but this DVD should be watched by everyone.  And make sure you include your children.  If you teach them early, you will be providing them with a basis for a happier, healthier life!
To make the most of this DVD, you should take notes when you watch it so you can refer to them each time before you shop until you get it down.  I give these DVDs to my clients and I have not had a bad review yet. The only criticism I've heard is that they are not crazy about one of the presenters - but trust me, you need to overlook this, it's worth it.
Note:  You probably will have to watch this more than once due to the amount of content.",1344470400,2,674,3.9338235294117645
