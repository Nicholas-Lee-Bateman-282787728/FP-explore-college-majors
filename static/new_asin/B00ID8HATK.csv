6258855,4,B00ID8HATK,"Well acted drama from the German WW2 perspective. It lacks the intensity and existential dimension of Das Boot. Not a guilt driven epic, nor a Band of Brothers spin-off, but more a collective ""Big Chill""l- like war film. Highly recommended.",1520812800,,240,5.025
6258856,4,B00ID8HATK,"I watched this series on Netflix and liked it. It has been called the German Band of Brothers, although BOB is far better than Generation War.  Don't get me wrong, this is still a great series and it is so nice to have a break from the usual Allies hero worshipping narrative of World War II.
This series revolves around 5 young friends in 1941 Berlin, although the actors playing these roles are all in their 30s, when they are supposed to be about 20. Wilhelm and Friedhelm are brothers who are sent to fight in Russia. Wilhelm is by far the character to root for, as he tries to save a Jewish child from being shot and quickly wants nothing to do with the horrors of the war. It is nice to show that not all those who fought for the Axis were the bloodthirsty monsters they are portrayed to be. Friedhelm, on the other hand, soon becomes hardened and shoots civilians on several occasions. Viktor is a Jew who escapes from a train taking him to Auschwitz and he joins the very anti-Semitic Polish resistance.
Charlotte becomes a nurse and takes care of wounded soldiers. Greta is a singer who is executed when the series ends. There are few battle scenes, with Kursk being the most focused on. Most fighting that is shown occurs between German troops and partisans. Wilhelm eventually deserts but is recaptured and sentenced to hard labor, and is beaten by the sadistic officer. Friedhelm is killed as the war comes to an end.
The series was good and worth watching, although if you believe that every person fighting for the Axis was an evil monster and not human beings like the Allies, then you may not like it. But if you can look at history from an unbiased viewpoint, you might enjoy this.",1519776000,,1698,4.495145631067961
6258857,5,B00ID8HATK,"This is a film about a group of idealistic German youths of military age drawn into Hitler's army in 1941 who promise to meet back in Berlin on a predetermined date. They all end up on the Russian front, except for one.. The film depicts realistic scenes and the effects of the conflict on their personalities,  It apparently is based upon a true story. The film is German with English subtitles.  That means you'll have to watch it a couple of times--once to read it and once to watch the video when you understand the story line.  I find it an excellent addition to anyone's library on WWII from the German perspective. It gives you a sense of what the German youth experienced in the War Years, hence the title.
I recommend it. It is similar to Enemy At the Gate, except all the characters speak German, not English with British accents.",1518912000,,840,4.5131578947368425

Don't expect a Band Of Brothers size budget (this is German television after all) but this miniseries is very well made and it's a great way to see the German perspective of fighting World War 2. There isn't a lot of action in this (almost) 5 hour series, but the characters and setting are very engaging and you won't get bored. Better than 90% of American tv.",1503446400,,440,4.378048780487805

6258878,5,B00ID8HATK,Can't say enough good about this movie.  Well acted.  Action feels very realistic.  Basically you get to see how war changes the 5 different personalities.  This movie does a really good job of showing tragedies of war without coming off as an anti-war movie.  Lots of brutal and terrible things that happen in war were depicted.  A lot of what was shown could have and probably did happen somewhere.  Absolutely excellent job making it feel very believable.  Good balance of action and emotional love story too.,1501113600,,512,4.872093023255814
6258879,5,B00ID8HATK,"I purchased this movie just recently and found it jaw-dropping and hard to turn away from, despite what some other people have said in their reviews.
Basically, 5 friends meet in a bar in Berlin, two of them brothers and another of them Jewish, which is hard to believe, but not unheard of, right before the start of the German invasion of Russia in June, 1941, and pledge to meet back there again after the final victory is assured by Christmas. Almost immediately, their little farewell party gets unwanted attention from a Gestapo officer, who comes in claiming he's been complained to that they're dancing to swing-dance music, which is now considered forbidden by Germany's laws, and also dancing with a JEW, the unholy crime.
One of the girls, aspiring to be the next Marlene Dietrich, and who is dating that Jewish guy, who is a second-generation tailor, kinda warms up to the Gestapo officer and even sleeps with him, hoping she can suck up to him enough to get her boyfriend legal papers getting him out of Germany and to the USA before the final roundup of Jews begins.
That doesn't do the trick at all, and her Jewish boyfriend is rounded up in December, 1941 to be sent to a concentration camp. But he and one other manage to bug out of the train taking them there by prying up enough of the floorboards in their car and dropping down across the tracks, a risky move when you think about how fast the train is going.
The two brothers witness a lot of action in the Eastern campaigns against Russia. Each scene marks their advance as they get closer to Moscow, and while the older brother is a lieutenant commanding a platoon, it's not lost on him that his younger brother, an enlisted man, is not well thought of by the other men in their unit, with a poor attitude regarding soldiering, and accused of being a coward. After that brother seems to deliberately give away their position by freely lighting up a cigarette in the dead of night and marking that position to an attack by Russian aircraft, he gets jumped by several of the men in the platoon and badly injured as a result. One of their friends, Charlotte(Charly, as she is called by others)is a field nurse located not far from them, and still getting used to the multiple wounds of soldiers from their side that she has to treat daily.
Part 2 seems to skip through quite a bit after that, going from January, 1942 to right before the beginning of the Battle of Kursk in the summer of 1943. The older brother, Wilhelm, is still a lieutenant, which is questioned by some people in the reviews as to why he isn't a captain by then, like many would be promoted to considering the time he spent in the field and the mass casualties the Germans are taking. Considering that this lieutenant has several times DOUBTED their ""final victory"" right in the presence of his superiors and looks like he's leaning towards defeatism, I guess his superiors wouldn't have promoted him for that either, regardless of their losses and needs for experienced officers. The Gestapo has been known to give such officers a fate ending at the end of a firing squad if they spouted defeatist remarks.
Their ""Marlene Dietrich"" visits the front lines as well, performing songs for the German soldiers before they're to be sent against the Russians at Kursk as fuel for the meat-grinding machine of war. Kursk goes badly for the Germans, and this singer knows it since she was too late to catch her own plane out of there before the battle began, and is temporarily working alongside Charlotte as a nurse and stretcher-bearer. Once back in Berlin, she makes the ultimate mistake by chiding several soldiers in a bar loudly enough to voice her opinion that ""the Final Victory has been cancelled, so you better go back to fight while you still can."" In my observance of this scene, some of the soldiers were a rowdy lot, looking at her as if they wanted a piece of ass, got angry at her speech, so in no time flat, they turn her in to the Gestapo as a defeatist. In 1943 Berlin, flapping your gums out loud in public about how Germany was losing the war could only have ONE consequence of your actions, and sleeping with a Gestapo officer and threatening to tell his wife about their affair doesn't make it any better.
Wilhelm nearly gets killed at Kursk, and seems to stumble in a daze away from the fighting and takes up refuge in an abandoned cabin before he's found and arrested by the local military authorities some time later. His younger brother mows down a squad of Russians single-handedly, gets cut off from his unit, and has to put on Russian military clothes to get through the trap even though his fellow soldiers mistake him for a Russian and shoot him. He nearly dies, and clings to life thanks to Charly and her skills. When coming home on leave, his father treats him like dirt, as if blaming him for still being alive while the Favorite Son is still missing and presumed dead. He coldly tells his father, ""I'm sorry the bullet missed by two inches"" and cuts his leave short to be the soldier he hadn't been in the beginning.
Wilhelm is sentenced to death, but the powers that be change their mind and sentence him to a penal battalion of defeatists and other questionable soldiers, where their task is to be thrown in where the fighting is fiercest as cannon fodder for the war machine. Around this time, the Jewish former tailor that escaped the Train of Death is now working for Polish partisans for the Home Army. The partisans have opinions that are strongly anti-Jewish, so he keeps his true origins to himself until that identity is given away after his fellow partisans ambush a German train that is packed with Jewish inmates heading to a camp. The partisans are agreeing to the fate of leaving the Jews locked inside the train while they make off with everything else of value. He unlocks the doors and lets all the inmates out to give them a chance at staying alive. Thereafter he is banished from his fighting group, and led into the forest by the leader at what appears to be a personal execution, but the leader tosses the gun down at him and turns away back into the trees.
Reviews have complained about the Polacks' so-called anti-Semite opinions, and how the Home Army had units that even saved Jews, but this movie is not far from the truth. Many parts of Poland even before 1939 were having anti-Semite laws that limited the numbers of Jewish people from attending universities. Jews were not very well thought of by the general Polish population, some of which collaborated with the Germans gleefully to help get rid of the ""Jewish problem"". The Home Army even questioned why they should try to supply the Jews with their limited weapons for the '43 Uprising in the Jewish ghettos of Warsaw, since ""Jews don't make good fighters."" The facts are, even though many Poles bent over backwards to help rescue Jews during the war, there was no shortage of Poles who didn't care about the fate of Jews in any way and some stated that ""they're getting what they deserve."" There definitely was no future in Poland for those Jews who survived once the war was over. That fact was well-documented.
All in all, it's a great movie, and really has a way in showing another part of the war which wasn't revealed in any other WW2 movie. Well done!!!",1500249600,3,7312,4.582442748091603
6258880,5,B00ID8HATK,"I love history, and I specialise in WWII history. What I loved the most about this film (cut into three parts for TV) was the attention to detail and the director's decision to make it as accurate and as real as possible. There is no whitewashing here. The film is seen mostly from the eyes of the five German friends who are thrown into Hitler's experiment. Everything begins on the evening of 22 June, 1941. Superb acting by all five main stars. The music and the sound effects absolutely brilliant. Combat scenes thoroughly researched and performed. Outstanding. I experienced the Blu-Ray version with 5.1 channel sound. Generation War is a masterpiece and has made it to my personal top ten WWII films of all time.",1499817600,,718,4.752
6258911,1,B00ID8HATK,"i give one star only to get people to read my reviews- actually this movie deserves 5 stars- it is that good- there was another movie where the evil german soldier shoots a young girl- what was it? any way- the movie presents many shades of grey- particularly in german characters we usually see only portrayed as demons-
I think the wolf scene in the forest is also in another film? maybe ""The Revenant""?
The plot is so convoluted- this is one of those movies where you have to read the wikpedia article to figure out what happened, Especially with the character of Victor. But you gladly do it- the movie is THAT GOOD.
The Polich anti semitism? It still exists!!!
I would like to have seen more re resistance to the nazi filth- say the ""White Rose""- but the movie does show how ordinary p;eop;le- like trump supporters- can be seduced into demonic evil.",1498608000,,855,4.52258064516129

6258948,5,B00ID8HATK,"As a WWII history buff, I found the movie quite interesting. I binged watched it all night. I saw some similar themes in the book, ""Enemy at the Gates"" (not the movie), where the eagerness of the Wehrmacht was a replaced by disillusionment for some soldiers. Of course, many, especially on the home front, remained more fanatical than those on the front lines.

It feels realistic that the common soldiers would feel repulsed by murder at first and would even protest.  It is hard to imagine what you would do if you were in their shoes. Short of deserting against a seemingly invinicble army, along with potential negative implications for your family at home, tgere doesnt seem to be an easy option for the lower ranked Wehrmacht soldier.

 Of course attitudes amongst the senior officers varies. When he became head of the 6th Army, Paulus stopped the wanton killing that was prevalent under Von Reichenau.

I do find it hard to imagine that the Armie Krajowa would be so anti-Semitic to the point of shooting any that they find. It is a bit of a dirty secret that much of the Western world was anti-Semitic during that time. FDR refused entry to the S.S. St. Louis, sending Jewish refugees back to Europe. However, there is a difference between having prejudices and killing. Additionally, in times of war, the enemy of your enemy is your friend.

It may be a bit of a stretch that Lt. Winter has the same rank in 1945 (pre arrest) as in 1941, and along with his superior Hauptmann (Captain). Given all of the casualties, competent officers should have easily gotten a couple promotions.",1485993600,,1591,4.705035971223022

Since it is subtitled, you have to keep an eye on the screen, but regardless, it's riveting! I don't know what they call the method in cinematography, but combat scenes are shot with that same, grainy, nearly stuttered method that was used in Saving Private Ryan, and it really adds to the gritty, raw, real feeling while watching it.

6259012,3,B00ID8HATK,"NAZI Germany has been the ever-reliable villain in thousands of films since the Forties.  Could there possibly be anything further to say about them?  Well, yes: The Germans haven't weighed in.  There have been cautious takes on certain theaters of the war - Das Boot comes to mind - but we've all been waiting for modern united Germany to address its NAZI past.  While interesting, Unser Mutter, Unser Vater - oops, Generation War, isn't definitive.  I guess we'll have to wait a little longer.

The film tiptoes between our hopes and fears.  Some had hoped that the film would be a giant mea culpa, a two-hour apology to the world for the atrocities committed by Hitler's Reich.  Others feared that it would be a two-hour excuse:  ""Meh, everybody committed atrocities; we were no worse than others.""  And some feared that the filmmakers would use the ""Italian Strategy"" of portraying themselves as victims of Fascism rather than the perpetrators of it.  The film couldn't possibly satisfy all of these demands, and doesn't.  Its main flaw is that it is too P.C.  While showing the violence and brutality of the war (and a bit of the brutality of the regime), it strenuously tries to be apolitical.  Given the subject, that was the most improbable goal of all.

The film is based on the wartime experiences of a group of young German friends.  The clumsiest element of this ""band of brothers (and sisters)"" is the inclusion of a Jewish member - in 1941.  While it is almost convincing that the Jewish youth's father deludes himself into believing that his military service in the Kaiser's Army in WWI would shield him from persecution, the inclusion of the Jewish member in this representative group feels like a crassly calculated move.

Except for the Jewish member, all of the young men and women in the film make immoral choices, but none of them beyond our capacity for understanding.  That also has frustrated some viewers, who wanted movie monsters, unalloyed with sympathetic qualities.  The cowardice of the filmmakers is to portray all of these protagonists as disillusioned with the NAZI regime by the end of the war; there are no true believers among them.  Critics were wrong however to criticize the filmmakers for not starting the film with NAZI rallies and Swastikas flapping in the breeze.  Post war Germany does have a Neo-NAZI problem.  It prohibits the use of NAZI symbols for good reason: it doesn't want to encourage nostalgia for the Third Reich among its citizens.

The film is not without its excuses.  In a snipe at the U.S. and the Allies, the secondary character who represents the purest evil of the NAZI government becomes a highly-placed official in the post-war government.  ""He was SS!""  a protagonist cries to an American officer.  The officer simply stares at him while lighting up another Lucky Strike.

Generation War's producers also had to tread lightly concerning the legacy of the Soviet Union and Communism.  There are still many people in the former East Germany who look back fondly on the old Communist regime.  They are uncompetitive in modern Capitalist Germany, and want to revert to the ways of their youth.  The producers have therefore portrayed Soviet characters as wise and queerly paternalistic.

In the end, it is sadly true that historical accounts tell more about today's sensibilities than those of the past.  In that sense, as an encapsulation of the German mind c. 2013, this film has value.",1464307200,,3452,4.905008635578584

6259024,5,B00ID8HATK,"How many WWII war films show the German soldier---Wehrmacht or Waffen SS, it makes no difference---as a murderous robot?  Needless to say, almost every American-made film falls into this category; even the best of them like, SPR, Band of Brothers, Fury, When Trumpets Fade, fail to escape this well-worn formula.

Recent German TV mini-series, Generation War, is a brave attempt to show how ordinary Germans---men and women---endured or didn`t, that morass of their own making, the Third Reich.  Generation War is an extremely well-crafted production, tackling the knotty questions of culpability for the horrific and mind-boggling atrocities that were daily fare on the Eastern Front from 1941 onwards.

The arc of the story follows the lives of five German young people---three men and two women---from the eve of Barbarossa to the final annihilation of Nazi Berlin in May,1945.  We know little about Wilhelm, younger brother Friedhelm, both drafted into the Wehrmacht for Hitler`s monumental ambition, the invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941.  Their friends are Greta, an aspiring starlet, Viktor, her Jewish boyfriend, and Charly, a nurse ready to help with Germany`s Drang Nach Osten.  They celebrate their last days together like any other young people would do, blissfully unencumbered by the murderous threats of the Third Reich.  The film breaks the mold by suggesting the existence of relative freedom of movement for German Jews and even shows German-Jew socialization on the eve of Barbarossa.  The film suggests that the wearing of the Star of David was made compulsory only after the invasion, and that the machinery of deportation and mass murder began shortly after.

While historians might quibble with such liberties, the rest of the film series stays admirably accurate to the realities of the war on the Eastern Front.  What is most commendable is how it shows how average soldiers---Wilhelm, Friedhelm and perhaps most of the Wehrmachters who walked into the Soviet Union on June 22nd, 1941---were transformed by the murderous, pitiless ideology that fueled the whole endeavor.
Wilhelm strives to be the model NCO, serving the men entrusted to him.  Things go awry as his honor is put to the test when ordered to shot a captured Soviet commissar.  Upon witnessing his brother in this conundrum, the idealistic Friedhelm turns away from both his brother and the loutish Wehrmachters around him. Yet, as the war drags on, its increasing barbarity pollutes even Friedhelm.

Behind the front lines, Charly`s childish delusions are irrevocably shattered as the first casualties start coming in.  She too has her conscience tested when she discovers a local nurse`s aide is Jewish.  Greta flirts with a SS official to further her starlet career.  Still, she manages to finagle an exit visa for Viktor, who is almost free before nabbed and on his way to Auschwitz. He makes a miraculous escape and joins the Polish partisans, where he must hide his true identity.  As 1944 arrives, all five characters are pressed to their limits, both morally and emotionally.  Charly befriends a Russian nurse, while Greta is imprisoned and learns firsthand what the Third Reich is all about.  Wilhelm attempts desertion, fails and finds himself impressed into a penal battalion.  Friedhelm trudges further into the abyss.

Generation War spares nothing of the brutality of the conflict.  Both Jews and Russian peasants are summarily executed for being enemies of the Reich.  The Final Solution is hinted at when a mortally wounded Einsatzgruppen trooper arrives at Charly`s hospital and hints at the horrors he has committed.  The battle sequences, while not as polished as in a high-dollar American production, are all the more real for their gritty and understated grimness.  The steppes, forests and shattered cities of the Ukraine and Russia are brought to life with an unerring accuracy.

Generation projects something original into the cinematic history of German participation in World War II.  It shows how similar Germany`s youth were to young people in Britain and America.  Yet,  as the veils became lifted and the reality of Nazism exposed, the unquestioning youth of Germany found itself caught in a trap of its own making.  Furthermore, the abject nature of the Eastern Front made the Nazi lies seem real, that Jews and Bolsheviks threatened the very existence of Germania.  Generation War does not excuse the actions of its deluded protagonists but rather explains them from a new angle.  A war brought to life through unimaginable hatred became a monster that devoured all.

Generation War is necessary viewing for anyone interested in understanding the Second World War from the German perspective.  Only when Germany`s central role and culpability for this apocalypse is better understood can America`s involvement be honestly appraised and appreciated.",1457654400,6,4877,5.249032258064516

However, it is a very moving show that will make you realize all the good and ugly that is in people, and comes out magnified during war times or any other times of hardship.  I watched this show with my husband and adult daughter, and days after I still think about it and the events portrayed.  I will most likely watch it again to catch stuff I missed.  I grew up in Germany, and my father fought in the war, never telling us kids much about it.  He was a child himself at 17 when going out with the Navy.  My parents met during the war, and married several years after it ended, but they still lived through a lot of hardships into the sixties, when things started to turn around economically.  I never realized as a kid, how difficult and scary times had been, until I read about it as a teenager.  And my parents were the kindest, most tolerant people I knew, opening their doors to everyone and anyone in need.  Living in a town with an American base, they welcomed anybody my brother and I would bring home as friends, regardless of color, background or faith.  I  think that a lot of Americans don't realize the state Germany and Europe was in during and after the war.  Mostly, all Germans are depicted as Nazis, and mean and bad people.  And a lot of them were taken in by the promises of jobs, well being, prosperity etc.  However, there were many kind people that risked their lives to help others.

Finally a movie and I hate to only call this a war movie because it is a romance too that shows good German soldiers and bad ones too of course.

Yes, they were human too...The German mother of the young soldiers crying at the thought of her sons going off to war. All American films are bulls*** compared to this one...Will the truth ever come out as to why they were fighting in Russia? The answer is to stop the Russians from invading Europe first. Martin .Borman that  piece of s*** turned out to be a Soviet spy giving military information to Stalin. Rumor has it that the orders to committ attrocities  against the Russian people came from him in hopes of tying up German soldiers and keeping them from the front. That did not happen right away. The Germans were at first  treated as saviors from Stalins evil regime and they also treated the population well. Trading with them and even paying some elderly Russian women to wash their clothes. Germany could have won the war against them if not for  Borman being a spy though.... The cold war answered what happens with a Russian invasion until the great U.S.president Reagen forced the wall to come down in East Germany.

6259035,4,B00ID8HATK,"Finished watching the German miniseries, Generation War (Unsere Mtter unsere Vter) tonight. They have called this ""the German Band of Brothers"". It's an interesting comparison. Band of Brothers was certainly one of the best depictions of Allied involvement in WW2. Tragic, of course, but with a happy ending. We one. The final episode of that series is one that I watch a few times a year because I find it so incredibly uplifting and inspirational.

Watching Generation War left me with the complete opposite feeling.

There is no happy ending. It lets you know that in war there are no ""winners"". This series was a big deal in Europe, for understandable reasons, but seems rather unknown in America. I think this may be because . . . we don't really care. It's just ""history"" . . . and who cares about history anyway when you've got The Kardashians?

Sure, that ancient war may have destroyed American lives, but it never destroyed our cities and thus, it is so distant as to be almost a fictional event for my generation (I'm 47) and an altogether non-event for those younger than us.

Not so for Europe. Germans of my generation and my parent's generation, who's parents and grandparents were responsible for that war and all of the incomprehensible horrors that accompanied it . . . haven't had the easiest time coming to grips with their history.

If you read many of the European reviews for this series you may understand why. Any attempt to humanize anyone who fought for the NAZI regime is called ""PC"". This, in itself is PC, from my POV. Yes, this series does attempt to humanize those people. They were human after all. Humans can be made to do inhumane things and war brings out the worst in everyone.  Personally, I thought the series did a very good job of depicting just how de-humanizing the experience of that war was for the people who were caught up in it. Indeed, ALL war is de-humanizing and I truly believe that this is forgotten by ""patriots"" and politicians who still believe in the recruiting posters.

While this was a work of fiction and at times quite implausible (poetic license in order to weave a long story together), the soul crushing events depicted in the series did occur. Every day. Hundreds of times. For years.

Indeed, there are people alive even today who are dead inside for the things that they lost so many decades ago.

Never forget that. Never take the good things you have for granted.",1451952000,7,2433,4.679156908665106

I make no claim to have seen all (or even some) WWII movies as that genre is not particularly attractive to me (although I am well read in military history of WWI and WWII). However, there are scenes in this film that are unforgettable and haunting beyond belief. I totally disagree with the reviewer who complains of stereotypes. There are none (a few of the plot devices are a bit predictable unfortunately, but they don't really take anything from the movie). And in any case, it's fiction, not a documentary. Also, I had just finished watching the German move Dresden, so the lack of footage of burning German cities and carbonized corpses did not really bother me.

I have never seen a war film that so effectively portrays the feeling of overwhelming, grinding entrapment and the sense of black despair had by soldiers who are caught up in an unwinnable war and forced to undertake senseless, futile actions with no way of escaping. The final scene in the film is impossible for me to forget.",1448755200,2,1138,4.573529411764706

It captures the daily lives of the German soldiers during combat and shows how hard it was for them being under the strict rule of the Third Reich. It also shows the horrible cruelty that the Jews endured. There is romance, suspense, and tons of action, also a true story. It is a very well made movie.

This history only happen 75 years ago and their are people still living, who experienced these events. In our own time we are seeing the re-building of the City Palace in Berlin.

Its been said that defeated countries make the best war movies and the handful of German war movies Ive seen, especially those of more recent vintage  GW, Lore, Rosenstrasse, Aime & Jaguar,  Downfall, Eine Frau in Berlin, Sophie Scholl  have been pretty darn good. Another thing I liked about GW was that the actors were mostly unfamiliar (to American audiences).

Anyone with any level of intelligence has to realize that the vast majority of German's that went off to fight the Second World War were motivated by love of country and the belief that they were protecting their way of life from those who would destroy it. The fact that, as with most Governments, the youth of the Nation were but mere pawns in the hands of Industrialists, War profiteers and megalomaniacs is an old tale that is well represented in this three-part series. The acting is very good, the war scenes are as good as anything in ""Private Ryan"" and the honesty with which the story is told is heart-breaking. The only thing that does not allow me to give it a fifth star is that the War is portrayed as a ""German Crusade"" when in fact it was a continuation of the past policies and Empire-building desires of a small group of Individuals that ruled Europe and which was fueled by the disaster of Versailles, the World-Depression, and the Anti-Semitic compliance of an entire World.",1433721600,2,1004,4.646067415730337

There are similarities here between this movie and Band of Brothers but also such films as Holocaust (1978), Hitler's S.S. portrait of Evil (1985). However this movie is no rehash of any of those. This film is original in its story and its characters. This is not kid stuff. It deals with very gritty and nasty subjects. Its not gratuitous or exploitive but its there and there is no glossing over of any of it. The story revolves around 5 people who are friends and have known one another all their lives. There are 2 brothers, 2 girls and one Jewish Kid. The movie starts just before the invasion of Russia. Everyone goes in optimistic thinking the war would be over by Christmas and they could all celebrate together. What they get is horrifying. Their lives, their hopes and dreams are ripped asunder. Their fates are bitter and cruel. Now don't get me wrong its not all dreary and depressing but if you are human it will leave a mark on you and make you think. I Highly recommend this the acting is first rate and the production values are tremendous. The equipment and uniforms are all correct.  I think it is an absolute must as a historical piece as well as war flick. Its even more than that but you should watch it to get the rest of the story and what it has to say.",1432252800,2,1346,4.341269841269841

6259083,5,B00ID8HATK,"I discovered short clips of this German mini-series on YouTube, having never heard of it previously. I was immediately hooked and purchased a copy of the series on Amazon. Although I'm a huge WWII buff and an amateur armchair historian, I'm not going to comment on whether or not it accurately portrays the attitudes and feelings of the average young German living and serving in Nazi Germany. And to be honest, I don't necessarily think that was the intent of the filmmaker. Rather, its a snapshot in time of five young German friends living at that time and taking very different paths and what they experienced. Regardless, I thought the film was well written, well made and thoroughly enjoyable upon viewing. Someone described it as a ""German Band of Brothers"" and that is an apt description, although I think in this film, their was bit more drama than action compared to BoB. However, the battle/action scenes were excellent and very realistic in the same vein as the previously mentioned Band of Brothers. Also, since this is German film, shown on German television, it goes without saying that the entire film is in German (with English subtitles). I only point this out for two reasons: 1.) Some people may not know and some may not like watching subtitled films. 2.) I personally liked it, in the sense that it just added to the authenticity. It was nice hearing German soldiers without English accents for a change! Anyway, if you enjoy WWII films, especially Band of Brothers and The Pacific, you should enjoy this film and is a worthy addition to any WWII film collection.",1431216000,13,1585,4.809523809523809

It clearly indicated the truth of war and the many murders and killing ordered by Officers who never saw the front except on a map. The author escaped to America and is sister was caught and beheaded by the Nazis.

This film also shows the truth of war created by the lies of murderous world leaders.

The statement WAR IS HELL just touches the tip of the iceberg. Thank God this story was told and produced for all to see the other side of war.

As one of the characters states near the beginning,  war brings out the worst in people.  The film is supposed to show the present generation the forces that pushed its grandparents into involvement in the onerous deeds of Germany in World War Two. The downhill spiral in these five lives is documented in the film,  as outside influences force them into situations which they would prefer to avoid.  The ruthlessness,  the brutality,  the destroyed ideals of a generation;  the hate,  the suffering and desperation;  the suddenness of death and a second chance at life for some of the characters provide a vivid insight into life in The Third Reich.  I heartily recommend ""Our Mothers,  Our Fathers"",  as the film is titled in German.",1429488000,4,834,4.829787234042553

Now I have a in depth knowledge of WW2 from the German perspective, it was my area of specialty while I pursued my history degree.  So I have to admit that many things were predictable, but there were also many things that happened that caught me completely by surprise.

This was not an effort to glamorize the Nazis, Germans or demonize the Russians.  It was merely a story of what happened to a group of friends in the Second World War.

Why? Fury is new, and gives use the perspective of the tank crew members. American Sniper gives use a whole entire family's perspective on war. And then Generation War gives us what it was like to be on the other side of the battle field. Not only does it have an amazing store to it. But it is extremely realistic, dramatizing, and action packed. We never get to hear the Nazi's/German's perspective of WWII, this flick shows us the heartache, pain, and dread these soldiers went through. Additionally it shows that we are all human.

Level-headed, highly decorated officer Wilhelm is off to the eastern front with his younger brother Friedhelm, a sensitive dreamer more interested in literature than warfare.

While Greta is a talented singer who longs to become another Marlene Dietrich, her Jewish boyfriend Viktor still cannot convince his parents to leave Germany... Valor and courage come to the fore, but also betrayal - of values, beliefs, humanity. If you're not a fan of ""subtitles"" then steer clear.

It is most often overlooked from May 1941 until the end of World War II, on the Eastern Front, the German Wehrmacht lost 60,000 personnel per month?!  This movie demonstrated how Germans in the trenches - and efforts for morale and medical support began to fail with the loss of personnel as they were pushed back into Germany and Berlin.  In addition, how the Jews were persecuted and survived; the Resistance movements fought on under incredible circumstances.  No one was spared the acrimony of the SS Gestapo.  This movie dared to portray the fact some Nazi administrators were used by Allies after the war was over.  This movie was produced by Volker Bruch and others of Germany and points East, plus with their perspectives I gained tremendous insights of matters during the War that were not as clear in other productions.  As a former USAF Officer with a M.A. in political science, this DVD movie is valuable and worthy of your DVD library.  I have it in mine now and recommend to others to gain more understanding of that culture of unquestioning obedience in that era.  Every Generation has its own history and it was told in a superb manner by their descendants.",1422057600,,1482,4.75390625
6259137,5,B00ID8HATK,"I ordered this Blu Ray on Friday Jan. 16. With two day shipping they said delivery on Sunday Jan. 18. To my surprise I received it on Saturday Jan. 17 about 36 hours after I ordered it. Now for this item. It's a story of five friends in their early 20's in World war 2 Germany. Three guys and two girls. Three parts about 90 minutes each. The sound is German speaking with English Subtitles. If you can accept that setup that's half the battle. The Subtitles keep up with the talking and is accurate with the translation. Another point is the movie jumps between the five characters so you do need to be patient and pay attention. The Military Scenes of the German Army are some of the best I've ever seen as far as look and detail. The action scenes do have a ""Saving Private Ryan"" feel to it. I do recommend this for war movie and history fans. I would also compare the vibe with the movie ""Downfall"" another good movie of the time. One little detail about the movie I did notice (no more spoiling after this) is the SS personnel do wear the skull emblem on their headwear but no ""SS"" on their collar insignia.

6259166,5,B00ID8HATK,"Growing up as a young child during WWII, and with several relatives serving in the Military during that time, World War II has always been a source of interest and fascination for me. My large collection of books and DVDs dealing with this period attest to my continuing interest.
I came across this DVD while looking at other WWII movies on Amazon and was intrigued that it was a German film (actually a 279 minute mini-series on German TV) about Germany (following the lives of five friends) during the war. I wondered how forthright the  makers would be about some of the more distasteful (mild word, I know) dimensions of Hitler's Third Reich. The short answer is ""very."" Atrocities, exterminations, the crushing ""War in the East"" and it's impact on morale (and decency) are all portrayed unsparingly. No sugar coating here, just a grueling portrayal of how war (as one of the main characters notes early on) ""brings out the worst in us.""
The technical quality and production values are first-rate, comparable to those of other expensive recent war DVDs. Thus an important story is accompanied by a quality production. And, for those interested, interviews with the producer and director are included. They give background about their purpose in making the series and its impact on the German public.
I strongly recommend this DVD as a thoughtful and vivid portrayal of the varied impacts of war in general and Hitler's Third Reich in particular.
I just wish the DVD had been longer.",1417651200,,1487,4.900793650793651
6259167,5,B00ID8HATK,"Plenty of people have said this is a German ""Band of Brothers"". I would say it is more like a German ""Saving Private Ryan"" because you really only follow a limited number of characters. That aside, I think it is excellent. As I understand it, the film was somewhat controversial in Germany, but that makes sense given the nature of the war and the memory of it there. I know that some have criticized the movie for only focusing on the Eastern Front, but given the fact that the majority of German soldiers fought on that front and not against the Americans, British, or Canadians, I don't see why the movie should include something not essential to the story. It does portray some of the Polish partisans as being ant-semetic, but some were. History is gray, not black and white and sometimes an unflinching portrait of a subject such as this makes people uncomfortable.

The combat sequences are well done. The story line is a bit stretched at some points but not to the point that it defies logic. It does show the Russians as committing what can only be considered war crimes, but again, the historical record bears this out. Yes, it was in revenge for what was done to the Russian people by the Germans, but that doesn't mean that it didn't happen. If anything, the movie is tragic. Gut wrenching at times. Some may prefer to see German soldiers in movies portrayed as unthinking, unfeeling, and robotic characters. You don't see that here. The viewer will feel themselves feeling sympathetic towards the characters and that may be an uncomfortable feeling.

This is really the story of a group of young people, caught up in something larger than themselves that they have no control over. All they can do is try to survive. It is sad. Very sad. I highly recommend this film to any World War Two enthusiast.",1416614400,2,1812,4.641744548286605
6259168,1,B00ID8HATK,"This is a thoroughly dumb movie, yet I read that it caused quite the sensation in Germany. They are calling it The German Band of Brothers, but I assure you that this is the farthest thing in every category (especially the script) you can possibly get from BofB. It is supposedly the true story of one of the character's grandpap's...but I don't know. I found the story lines of these Deutschkinder to be laughable.

The stock characters are the sweet nurse, the cabaret singer moll, two German brothers (one of whom is a complete f-up to his dad and is kind of batsh*t crazy, too)a Jewish guy who is somehow friends with this group. Who will survive? It's amazing anyone survives as they were all on the Easter Front.

Generation War asks you to believe that four or five German pals keep meeting up on the Eastern Front. That we are to believe these kids run into each other during the war, on the battle field, on the Eastern Front is just a bridge too far (see what I did there?)

Also, interesting choice to place all the action once the war starts on the Eastern Front. Thus, you don't run into any of those heroic American boys--and the enemy becomes the loutish, nurse raping comrades of the Red Army. Please.

The people who made this movie did not intend to pull any punches when dealing with the Nazis, the war, Genocide, and the German people. The story, however, is just so threadbare it feels like they are pulling punches. In Germany, this made for television (perhaps this is the whole problem?) production was called ""Our Fasters, Our Mothers"".  I found this kind of problematic because the kids depicted in this movie are actually Our Great Grandparents and Grandparents and Maybe our Parents, but ok, whatever.

The big issues they skim over for the genertion watching and learning about WWII from the German side of it were the genocide in Eastern Europe, bad SS men using Caberat singers, a not so noble Resistance in Eastern Europe that had no problem exterminating Jews as well, and a couple love stories in our little group. Again, improbably, the Jewish kid ends up running with the Polish resistance. They were just as happy to kill him, but somehow he is allowed to live with them after escaping a transport train presumably on the way to Auschwitz.

Meh and Meh. Try again, German folks. This wasn't your movie and doubt that this was actually your greats, grands, or your parents...",1416441600,16,2411,4.645539906103286

6259170,4,B00ID8HATK,"Any attempt to represent the Russian front impartially is almost certainly going to alienate one or other of the various participants descendants. And so it is with this production, which does have its fair share of controversy! It tells the fictional story of 5 twenty something friends, all of whom are native Berliners, as they each in their own way prepare to deal with the looming crisis of the drive to gain Hitlers Lebensraum. The need for this living space was outlined in the infamous Mein Kampf dictated to his lackey, Hess, when both were languishing in Bavarias Landsberg Prison following the failed Munich Beer Hall Putsch in 1924.

Two of the friends are brothers, the eldest, Wilhelm (Volker Bruch), who is a junior army officer, and his pacifist brother, Friedhelm (Tom Schilling), a private in the army, are shortly off to participate in Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of Russia, which begins on June 22nd 1941. Two are girls, Charlotte (Miriam Stein), who is in love with Wilhelm, and Greta (Katharina Schuttler), an opportunistic, somewhat cynical would be singer, working as barmaid. The final member of this group is Viktor (Ludwig Trepte), who is Jewish and therefore, perhaps, the most unlikely. Some critics were left open-mouthed at the improbability of any twenty-something Germans, having had nine years of Nazi indoctrination, enjoying friendly relations with a Jew. However, Viktor and Gretas relationship is a little more than friendly and in the opening scene during which the group assembles in the bar for the last time before they all have to go their own way, Greta establishes a fateful relationship with an SS officer who interrupts their party, in order to save Viktor from discovery.

Other critics have poured scorn on the production for seemingly ignoring any aspect of the holocaust, for depicting ordinary Germans as victims of Nazism rather than more than willing participants and portraying Polish partisans as rabid anti-Semites. Nevertheless, the series is brilliantly acted and does succeed in illustrating certain aspects of Hitlers War of Annihilation on the Russians. As such it represents a welcome addition to other similar series such as Band of Brothers also, with some justification, not without its critics, which serve to educate succeeding generations about the satanic nature of Nazi Germany.",1416096000,2,2363,5.2321899736147754
6259171,5,B00ID8HATK,"This series deserves some attention and acknowledgment. It is nice to see a WWII film that isn't all about D-Day and the American soldier hero, but the part of the war that was really the biggest and scariest one - the war in Russia.
Also, it is very interesting to see the German point of view and to imagine young Germans and how they dealt with the situation and how it changed them.

Yes, the movie has its flaws. Some moments seem a bit too much coincidence. But then again, it is fiction and it is trying to make a point. And it makes it very well. The acting is great, the emotions are there. The production is very well done.

I do completely disagree with the the negative critics that say it tried to shift the blame for the Holocaust and other atrocities by showing antisemitism in the Polish resistance. The Jewish Partisan Educational Foundation has conducted numerous interviews with Jewish partisans from Poland who routinely spoke of antisemitic actions directed at them and other Jews by the AK. Abe Asner reported that the AK often posed a greater threat to the Jewish partisans than the Nazis. The survivor testimonies of the Jewish Historical Institute in Warsaw also contain a number of references to the danger the AK posed to Jews in hiding, and of a prevailing air of antisemitism in the group. The AK holds a near-sacred position in the hearts and minds of many Poles, representing their national counterpart to the Allied struggle. Questioning its treatment of Jews undoubtedly assails its credibility as a national icon, resulting in the failure to acknowledge this chapter of the AK's history and the outright refusal to admit that many of its factions were not only antisemitic but engaged in the persecution and killing of Jews.

The Germans have come to terms with the horrors they committed during WW2, they are owning up to it. Other nations should too.",1414540800,5,1886,4.7439024390243905

For me it was interesting to see the German point of view but sadly the characters portrayed were in the end as I said before dissapointing.  Lets start with Wilhelm the professional officer of the Wehrmacht, he starts well full of optimism at the start of Operation Barbarossa but when things turned sour he deserted his company in an hour of need, then reprieved from capital punishments and in the last months of the war when the German Army was fighting to gain some time for German Civilians to scape from the Red Army he deserts again after murdering his commanding officer.  He was supposed to represent the honorable German officer corps but his behavior was so disgraceful that he does a great disservice to the memory of those brave men.  Then comes Friedhelm portrayed first as a sensitive man that was too soft to carry on his war duties as an enlisted soldier but after several battles and negative experiences hardens himself and starts to behave as an unscrupuled assassin, after murdering his Commander to save a Jewish friend we find him leading a band of Volksturm and at least he takes the high road sacrificing for his comrades so they can surrender to the Russians, this last act at least makes him somewhat symphatetic.  Then we have Greta the singer that uses her ual sexinfluence with a Gestapo officer to accomplish anything she wishes such as career advancement and supposedly saving the life of her Jewish lover, in the end betrays herself and ends up being executed in a concentration camp after saying out loud to a group of soldiers defeatist remarks, lets not forget she was touring the Eastern Front entertaining troops before.  Then comes Charlotte the nurse which becomes a noble character helping the wounded troops but after betraying her adjudant for being Jewish, she is captured by the Russians and ends the war as a nurse for the Red Army being saved from rape and murder by the same Jewish nurse she betrayed to the Gestapo before.  We have also the token Jewish character that undergoes the stereotypical ordeal scaping from a prison train, fighting for the partisans and returning to postwar Berlin to find out he has lost family and possessions and even Gretta his lover.  After too many coincidences, seems the Eastern Front is such a small affair that all these character have a chance to meet repeatedly in the battlefield the survivors meet again in the same bar they started thier particular odissey.  So with these sometimes hateful characters and some unbelievable coincidences the series becomes soapy and unrealistic and ultimately unsatisfying and after you don't learn more about the war than watching any other Hollywood production so the German perspective ends up being the same stereotypical point of view we are already familiar.",1410480000,7,2902,4.870182555780933

Starting in May 1941, these young people undergo a series of events that force them to make moral choices that in the end leave them compromised and complicit in the system that they are defending. Viewers watch them experience a spectrum of emotions beginning with triumphalism and optimism toward their bright futures due to The Third Reich's victories, to alienation, to fear, and ultimately to shock and oblivion. Almost uniquely among war movies, this miniseries allows viewers to imagine what it was like to be one of the five main characters who experienced World War II in Europe on the losing side.

 In this production of a deep seated introspection of life in Germany during the Second World War as told from the German perspective, we see life from the beginnings of WWII to the prologue of the Great War from the eyes of Wilhelm Winter.  At the start of the war Wilhelm is honor bound to do Germany proud and is the paternal pride of his family.  He is a Wehrmacht officer commanding an infantry platoon and proves to be a great leader and inspiration to his men.  In his platoon, ironically is his brother Friedhelm Winter who was indeed no true Nazi and a pacifist in attitude and demeanor.  As the war proceeded Wilhelm sees the errors of his ways.  On the other end of the spectrum Friedhelm as an enlisted soldier seeking basic survival melds into the attitudes of the German right wing and becomes a callous warrior seeking only survival and not believing in the Nazi mission.  In the end Wilhelm survives and Friedhelm dies.  Wilhelm changes and Friedhelm in turn also changes in a different way and in fact saves many lives by his actions.

 Adding to the eclectic troupe of characters who will proceed down the long and tragic trail of historic significance are a Jewish man living in Berlin and two women who seek different and divergent ways of serving the German way of life during WWII.

 Victor Goldstein was the unfortunate heir of a very talented and successful Berlin tailor who served Germany in WWI as a soldier.  Victor was in fact in love with a German Aryan woman by the name of Greta Muller.  The other woman in the party of five friends is Charlotte who is secretly in love with Wilhelm.  In fact in 1939 all these five met for a final reunion of friends before departure into the realm of the actions of what was to transpire to what all would see as the fall of the Third Reich.  Greta Muller tries with her seductive powers and singing talents to save her lover Victor Goldstein.  The efforts would be tragic in the end for Greta.
 Without giving away the context of the plot we find Victor trying to avoid capture at the hands of the Nazis, Charlotte is a healer extraordinaire who in the end saves many lives but in doing so realizes the total futility of war which does not meet up with her prior youthful German idealism.  At the end of the war when she meets up with Wilhelm and Victor it is realized that they have all changed.
 Friedhelm and Greta are non survivors who have learned the truth the hard way.  This series of episodes bring to one and all a youthful German perspective on the tragedy that was the German Third Reich.",1408665600,,3016,4.422101449275362
6259197,3,B00ID8HATK,"This 3 part series had much to recommend it and overall it's a worthwhile effort but though it's been compared to Band of Brothers, it falls far short of it for several reasons.
First off, the series was not long enough to go into the details of the events happening at the time, to allow the viewer to fully appreciate the deteriorating situation as the war progressed, and the evolving of the characters, in particular Charlotte.
Second, as a history biff,  I would one too many anachronisms such as for instance, Leutnant Winters' unit being the 60th motorized infantry regiment of the ""Windhund"" division, which initially was the 16th motorized infantry division, which went on to become the celebrated and elite 116 Armored division. This unit spent much of the war fighting on the western front from the allied invasion of Normandy to the fighting in the Ruhr pocket. I wonder if the director was afraid of not appealing to the western audiences by showing German soldiers killing and winning against western allies and decided somehow to transfer the two main male characters magically to the 292 infantry division which fought primarily against the Soviets? Is this a ""politically incorrect"" time for Germans to be proud of their army's achievements against the western allies?
Third, the German army helmets had the Swastika and eagle on the left helmet, but not tricolor national shield on the right side, which would have been black, white and red.
I found it a bit PC also that the majority of the casualties shown were German, since the Germans had a higher kill to loss ration than their opponents, especially the Russians who lost more than three to one in favor of the Germans.
Four: the characters were not real, which was a MAJOR turn off, especially considering the birth and death dates given at the end, in a manner reminiscent to Band of Brother's final episode upon war's end.
Five: the unbelievable reunion of the Jewish Russian nurse with Charlotte at the end was straight out of a Disney story especially the very fantasy-like fairy tale comment by the escaped Jewish nurse, now a decorated Red Army officer who mentioned ""Red Army are the liberators, not rapists"". Yeah, right, especially considering that the savage, beastly red army soldiers not only raped millions of women in the Axis countries of Germany, Hungary and Croatia, but also ""allied nations"" in Poland, Serbia, and the Czech republic.
Six. I just couldn't imagine the slightest mathematical chance of Friedhelm and his Jewish friend meeting in the middle of the Belarussian forest when the latter is just about to be killed with the former arriving in the nick of time to save him. No way.
Last but not least, it was unimaginable to see Leutnant Winters simply walk into the bar at the end to meet with his surviving friends at the end of the war. More than likely, as a prisoner caught in the eastern zone of Russian occupation in Germany, he would have been kidnapped, sent to a Gulag and made to slave in uranium mines until 1955 when the last Germans were repatriated thanks to the please of Konrad Adenauer, not to mention the tens of thousands who were shot en route, tortured or died of disease, malnutrition or starvation AFTER the war ended.

Overall, the series were good but could have been much, much better if they had only concentrated a little more on the transition at home and at the front, the changing fortunes of battle the bloody battles of the east (Kursk was skipped altogether) etc..
I also noticed that all the fervent Nazis were blonde, while all the ones doubting national socialism were brunette. A bit odd since the majority of Germans are in fact blonde and that had nothing to do with their political affiliation. Is the director trying to depict Germans as a not so blonde, not so national socialist and just a regular ol' nation? Well why not, they are just that, and it's time to put away the guilt and the shame that many other warmongering nations never confessed up to, and allow more discourse and less censorship, which this movie begins to do (just as the German woman and Stalingrad did). It's up to the next generation of German filmmakers to push the envelope further and dig in deeper when the PC censorship of Germany's self portrait in WWII erodes once and for all.",1408320000,11,4304,4.760374832663989

Band of Brothers has always been my top pick, but this film is not just about combat and the gruesome truth of war, its also about love, friendships and pride in your country, but more than that its about deceit. This is an eye opening film that shows that Germans in general weren't evil. Like Darrell ""Shifty"" Powers said in his Band of Brothers interview to make that Mini-Series, ""We might have had a lot in common. He might've liked to fish, you know, he might've liked to hunt,"" Powers said. ""Of course, they were doing what they were supposed to do, and I was doing what I was supposed to do.

This series is amazing so far i am so glad i brought this. If anyone is looking for some world war 2 films to add to their collection generation war is a must have.

Film wise it looms great playing on a hdtv though a ps3 or blue ray player. The set and battle scenes is amazing to watch. (In a small way i think the battle scenes may be better than band of brothers. ) The acting is nice it draws you into how the germans felt back then.

Next i want to explain is the historical aspec . (I haven't seen all of it yet so my review is based off the first part.) I love world war two this film so far is historically accurate.  The events between the five friends are true to what some individuals went through durng the time.  And they show quite alot of detail during tactics that german soilders did during battle.

Im going to.stop my review here because i can go on and on even though ive only seen one out of three parts. Dont hesitate buy this if you want something to watch or if your a history lover their are drama, funny, action and adventure throughout this film.",1407542400,2,1142,4.103139013452915

6259204,5,B00ID8HATK,"Excellent movie series depicting the Second World War through a German lens. The group of 5 friends is a bit contrived with two gung-ho brothers serving the fatherland, one gung-ho nurse, one narcissistic actress, and one German Jew in the group. We watch this group of friends lose their idealism as they harden to the stark realities of war-torn Europe and Nazi Germany.

The combat scenes are first rate and extremely well done. I was most impressed with that particular side of the story. The German Jew in the group also has a very interesting story that pulls some small glimpse of the Holocaust as he experiences it. Optimal word is small. We are not treated to a concentration camp experience, but rather his experiences with a Polish Resistance Group. Overall, I thought the telling of his story was fairly well told.

I was less drawn to the story of the nurse and of the actress, but both are equally well done and give the viewer a different look at activities apart from the battlefield.

The story of the two soldier brothers is where this series shines and gives us a fair look at the common German soldier. Some moral dilemmas are presented to these men, most notably a scene where Ukrainian Auxiliaries are gathering up the Jews in a village alongside German SD men. The scene is contrived and feels such, but pointing out that the Germans were aided in the Holocaust is important to tell. The real horror of the Holocaust is that so many people participated across all of Europe.

Overall, a very enjoyable movie series to watch.",1407196800,4,1547,4.697416974169742

At the end it tells when the people died and two died in  1997 and 2003,  Certainly there isn't a story here that couldn't have happened. This is a very realistic show and the effects are outstanding. The gore is kept to tv levels though. NO ultra realistic scenes of people being blown to bits , although many people are shot and some hung and such. The show moves fast as it follows our five young people as they leave for war and then must survive. One is jewish and he has to fight with partisans in Poland.  One is a singer, and she stays in Berlin and one is a front line nurse.  The other two are soldiers,  it also follows one of their brothers stories as he too is a soldier with his older brother.  This is well acted and it does give you a idea of how the war shattered that generation of Germans.  Many ended the war with no skills other than warfare,  and no prospects. Thankfully the allies rebuilt Germany using germans and that was quite wise.  Anyways this is in German with English subtitles.  Yes you read them!.

6259208,4,B00ID8HATK,"I was really looking forward to this miniseries, and I appreciate its intent, but I think it's wildly overrated as a cultural event.

Cinematically, it may resemble a ""German 'Band of Brothers',"" what with its excellent action sequences, attention to historical detail, cinematography, and acting, but it also resembles a German 'Pearl Harbor' with its maudlin (and wholly unnecessary) soap-opera plot devices. The recurring motif of The Photograph is as cloying as the various romances. Were they afraid that German teenagers would otherwise not watch this?

Sociologically, this is not at all profound, as some German press reviews would have it. It largely avoids the basic, maybe unanswerable, questions of what really motivated these characters throughout their experiences (and the various average Germans they represent.) I sympathize somewhat with those critics who suggest there's more absolution than reflection here. Isn't the point to try to understand how this horrifying insanity infected individuals, not just how it affected them? I mean, if it could happen in sophisticated, cultured, scientific Germany, we're all always in danger, aren't we?  But I digress.

If you're hoping for the character and plot development of, say, ""Das Boot"" or ""Stalingrad,"" you'll be disappointed. If you're looking for the historical realism of those films, you'll find it here too, but amidst some schlock.

I find its virtues far outshine its vices, it's absolutely worth seeing (even if just for the acting), and I'm probably more annoyed by the fawning flattery and self-congratulation surrounding this miniseries.",1406678400,3,1616,5.5

That is not to excuse those responsible for the war and this film makes very clear who that was. But I cannot imagine (I don't know how to say this strong enough) how it was to live under almost continual bombing. And I cannot imagine the bravery of the men who manned the bombers and those who tried to shoot them down. It was horrible for all involved.

I was a little disappointed that the allied bombing of Berlin was not covered but again with the limitation of only 3 parts it would have been difficult to cover all aspects of the war. The frustration of Lt. Winter knowing that Germany could not win the war as far back as 1943 was well done.

6259223,2,B00ID8HATK,"I think calling it a 'German band of brothers' is misleading, as it focuses a whole lot less on the war than on the dramatic situation involving the several young persons.

It glosses over the war crimes of the Nazis, usually depicting the average German as mere victims and it understates the participation or indifference to nazi crimes that most Germans had during this period, which i think better reflects reality.

You can't help but feel that they just made one of the friends a Jew to make a political statement rather than reflect the reality of the period for most Jews and Germans.

I find it entirely ahistorical and i dare say revisionist. If you're looking for a German band of brothers, move on. It's just a poor drama that takes fanciful and ridiculous liberties with the historical reality of the period and fails to reflect the lives of the men of the Wehrmacht.

as a drama, Ultimately it focuses so much on the friendship between them that it fails to accurately portray war-time Germany, it's motives or historical reality of the period(that is unfortunately so under-visited in American media) but on the other hand it focuses too much on the circumstances of the war as it relates to the individuals that it fails to develop the characters or the underlying friendship that is the basis for the movie's plot.",1404345600,6,1331,4.748917748917749

6259226,5,B00ID8HATK,"***MINOR SPOILERS***

Contrary to the other reviews, this is not Germany's answer to ""Band of Brothers,"" although the combat scenes are strikingly similar. ""Generation War"" is a production somewhat reminiscent of the German film ""Stalingrad"" if it were crossed with ""Doctor Zhivago"" (the latter for the way circumstance plays out and how the characters run into one at opportune times.)

To give a basic summary, we follow five friends on the eve of Operation Barbarossa, 1941. We are introduced to: Charly, who has just joined the German Red Cross; Greta, who is destined to become a famous singer; Viktor, Greta's Jewish boyfriend who is deeply concerned for the welfare of his family; Wilhelm, an officer in the Heer and his younger brother, Friedhelm, a reluctant enlisted soldier under his brother's command. What transpires over the course of this three-part miniseries is a glimpse of how life under a totalitarian government -- and the war it has started -- irrevocably changes these five individuals. All of them are tried in harrowing ways, and almost none make it through their personal war without having committed a regrettable or grievous act.

Nonetheless, at some point, the viewer will have no choice but to sympathize with each and every one of these characters and how the war shattered their dreams...and their lives.

What really sets ""Generation War"" apart from other WWII films is that no belligerents involved come out with clean hands. The SS, SD, and Einsatzgruppen are depicted as brutal, but the regular German soldiers are shown engaging in heinous acts as well. Civilians are used to clear a path through a minefield; homes are destroyed; suspected partisans lined up and executed. Speaking of partisans, a group of Polish Home Army resistance fighters don't come off as squeaky clean heroes -- Viktor joins them and must hide his religious convictions because of vicious antisemitism among them. Red Army soldiers are shown following the orders of the NKVD to commit ruthless atrocities. Ukrainian collaborators are seen helping German police battalions round up Jews at one point.

Even America doesn't get a free pass -- a former member of the Gestapo is seen working in an administrative capacity for the US Army during the postwar occupation. And if anyone thinks this kind of clemency wasn't granted to Nazis, look up ""Operation Paperclip"" -- or consider the slap on the wrist given to Joachim Peiper, one of the most notorious war criminals who ever lived.

The uniforms and weapons are 90% correct...much better than Hollywood has ever done in costuming the cast of a WWII film. I spotted a few gaffes, but nothing that really ruined my viewing experience.

Although not quite on par with Band of Brothers (not much is), this is an absolutely jaw-dropping cinematic accomplishment and makes for a riveting watch. I bought this on Blu-Ray based on word of mouth alone, and am glad I took the leap of faith. I'll watch it again and again.",1404259200,3,2974,5.008097165991903

As a young person she wasn't overtly interested in WWII history but she impressed upon me how the film got her attention and caused a number of her peers to discuss the War with their older relatives.  Her enthusiasm immediately captured my attention and a deep desire to see it.  I waited patiently and kept checking when it would be shown or available in the United States.  As soon as it became available I ordered it and immediately watched it the day it arrived.  I was very pleased with the storyline, the characters, the filming, and the general look of the film.  It has been compared to the German version of Band of Brothers, and I am not sure if I would totally agree with that assessment simply due to BoB having more hours to develop the characters.

The story line, character development, cinematography, as well as the acting were all outstanding. You forget you are reading subtitles - always a good indication of a compelling story. While it is unrealistic and unlikely that the five close friends and major characters of the series would encounter one another at various times throughout the war; that nonetheless did not detract from the overall narrative - it had to be done to maintain continuity, etc.
Gaining insight into Nazi Germany from the German perspective was eye-opening and allows you to at least begin to understand why they did what they did - i.e. wage war on their neighbors. The propaganda machine was in full operation. It was fascinating to watch all of the main characters become disillusioned with the cause and face the many moral dilemmas they all had to endure. They all suffer their own form of hell.
I can believe this story was controversial in Germany. Generation War is unapologetic towards Germany and lays bare the atrocities of their aggression.

6259239,3,B00ID8HATK,"Generation War is the latest in a line of German films attempting to put the experience of the Second World War in perspective for the current generation of Germans.  The three-part mini-series is blessed with high-quality production values and a straight-forward plot with multiple story arcs that begin and converge upon the same point. The five characters were intended to convey how the experience of what it meant to be a 20 year-old Berliner in 1941, as the Third Reich was about to invade the Soviet Union.  Overall, the mini-series is well worth watching both for historical and drama/entertainment value, although it is not particularly fresh in terms of content and tends to employ stereotypical elements. My critique of the series will mostly focus on the military aspects, in order to provide greater situational awareness to those viewers more interested in Second World War historiography.

 The narrator and main protagonist of the mini-series is Oberleutnant Wilhelm Winter, who serves as a motorized infantry platoon leader in Infanterie-Regiment 60 (mot.) in the 16. Infanterie-Division (mot.). It is stated that he previously served in the Polish and French campaigns and is a capable, veteran officer. In the first episode, which covers Wilhelms progress during Operation Barbarossa from June  December 1941, the series depicts the initial advance toward Kiev, a small-unit attack on a factory, some partisan activity and a Soviet winter counterattack.  Wilhelms attitude begins to go south during the Winter battles when it becomes clear that the war will not end in victory. The series failed to really depict the impact of the Russian winter on exposed German troops, particularly widespread illness and frostbite, as well as retreats. In the second episode, the narrative leap-frogs over 1942 (a major mistake in my opinion, since it skips Stalingrad) and lands squarely at the Battle of Kursk in July 1943. Now Wilhelm is mentioned as being in the 292. Infanterie-Division, which was part of the 9. Armees attack on the northern part of the Kursk bulge. Amazingly, even after four years of front-line combat service, Wilhelm is still an Oberleutnant  he should at least have been a company commander by this point. Most viewers will probably like the opening attack of Zitadelle, with Wilhelms platoon attacking alongside a platoon of Tiger tanks. However, Wilhelms platoon is quickly annihilated in a hopelessly one-sided fight at a factory and he walks off, shell-shocked by an explosion. Yet after gathering his wits, Wilhelm opts to remain at an isolated cabin in the woods until rounded up days later by German military police. He is forthwith tried and sentenced to a punishment unit, where he spends 1944-45 until he deserts again and walks back to Berlin in May 1945.

 Wilhelms character is not particularly fresh or credible and appears similar to Leutnant Hans von Witzland in the earlier German war movie, Stalingrad (1993). Like von Witzland, Wilhelm starts out as a good soldier but becomes disillusioned by Nazi brutality and ends up rebelling and ending up in a penal unit. This type of portrayal of front-line German junior officers is very atypical and at odds with numerous extant memoirs, like Gottlob Bidermanns In Deadly Combat or Wigand Wusters An Artilleryman in Stalingrad. Very few German combat officers deserted and it is clear that Wilhelms character was designed to show that he rejected the Third Reich. It would have been far more honest  but dangerous for modern audiences  to show that most German officers remained loyal until the end and did their best to win. At no point do we see Wilhelm interested in promotion, awards or recognition, even though that was quite common in a system that heaped praise upon its best warriors. From the beginning, Wilhelm seems rather apathetic.

 Throughout the mini-series, Wilhelms sidekick is his younger brother Friedholm, who serves as an enlisted soldier in the same platoon. I have never heard of this kind of odd situation in the German Army, particularly early in the war, and think it was only set up this way so that the two could regularly interact. In the first episode, Friedholm is a terrible, apathetic soldier until re-educated by a blanket party. Thenceforth, he becomes a cold-blooded killing machine while his brother moves in the other direction. Taken together, both brothers do not paint a very accurate or flattering portrayal of the German fighting man in the Second World War  apathetic, indecisive and always uncertain. These are not the men who knocked the Red Army back on its heels and reached the Volga.  The real German 20 something who served in the Wehrmacht of 1941-43 was a much different character  certain of what they wanted and certain that they had the right stuff.  It was a generation of over-achievers  pointed in the wrong direction. Most Germans felt victimized by the 1919 Treaty of Versailles and endorsed Hitlers foreign policy, yet none of these characters sympathize with national objectives. Even Claus von Stauffenburg, who tried to assassinate Hitler, believed that Germany had a right to retake Polish land. In short, the characters in this mini-series are fakes, intended to convince modern audiences that their predecessors back in 1941 didn't support Nazi goals and only went along unwillingly. This is patently false.

 Another military aspect of the mini-series that bothered me was the complete absence of Allied bombing of German cities. In reality, German soldiers on the Eastern Front were always affected when they heard about their home towns being bombed. It was the Allied bombing  which killed over 500,000 Germans and laid waste their cities  - which was the definitive experience for the German wartime generation, not the Holocaust. Yet, the series producers had to include a German-Jew character, Viktor, as one of the five principals, even though his character was heavily reminiscent of Rudi Weiss, as portrayed in the US miniseries Holocaust (1978). In the end, Generation War is a carefully packaged and sanitized depiction of the war.",1402876800,166,6108,5.148484848484848

6259244,4,B00ID8HATK,"The story is about five friends in Germany that lead their young lives during the event-filled era of 1939 to the end of the war.  It is a good, well-done presentation.  For a person with substantial interest in the period, including the social impact upon the people of Germany/Russia; this is a good, interesting presentation.

But, it ain't ""Saving Private Ryan"", or ""Enemy at the Gates.""  That can be both good, and bad depending upon your particular tastes/interests.  The five friends; two brothers headed to the Wehrmacht, a girl seeking to be a frontline nurse, and aspiring actress, and a young Jewish man, embark upon their lives as the period permits.

It has the ""feel"" of ""Woman in Berlin"", or ""Dresden"", but without the continual overbearing omnipotent ""darkness.""  The accompanying soundtrack is perfect, and the emotional circumstances of each scene can stretch from the joy of young adulthood, the singular devotion of infatuation between a man, and a woman; to the tenseness of twentieth century warfare.  There are not really much battle action depicted, and certainly no global special effects as witnessed in the latest ""Stalingrad"", but the story alternates between the events experienced by each of the five characters in an interesting manner, keeping the viewers interest.

I had no problem with the English subtitles.  I like to hear the German words while reading the printed English.  I gives the presentation an authentic perception that I like.  I never have been enthusiastic about movies with characters such ""Goring, Himmler, Eichmann, or Sitting Bull speaking perfect English in an historical setting.

This show is mostly historically accurate in the ways I am familiar with, (though I am no expert on the contrasts of a T-34, and a 1941 Panzer.) It is the social aspects, the phycology of the various characters, and the decisions made by each at various crossroads that makes this show stand out.

Three of them survive to keep a date once promised in a time long lost, but none returns the same.

The movie itself is both spectacular production and formulaic soap opera. Many reviewers praise the realism of its battle scenes and others decry the script's many preposterous subterfuges (the escape from the Auschwitz train, for instance, would've been more believable if the Fairy Godmother herself had opened the door!). Yet, I give it four stars, for in the end it tries to be an honest reckoning with Germany's collective guilt (the movie's original German title is ""Our fathers, our mothers"").

To much guilt perhaps, for I  also denote a trace of ""Ostalgia"" in the way the Communists are portrayed. Germans see themselves as misguided decent folk, Ukranians are depicted as stooges, Poles as anti-semite bigots, and Americans as Nazi abettors, but the Soviets get a free pass as ""liberators"". A German nurse is about to be raped only to be saved by a sympathetic Jewish doctor, now Red Army official, who not only forbids the abuse but lectures the soldiers on their moral superiority, and forgives her betrayer in the name of ""the new Germany we're about to build"".

6259253,5,B00ID8HATK,"Not wanting to mirror what others have already said, this production is nothing short of absolutely epic.  The details, large and small, were painstakingly reproduced, and that's the kind of thing that usually drives me crazy with WWII movies, but not here.  They got everything right with this one.  The production quality is as good as, or better than, Band of Brothers or Saving Private Ryan, and the story line is extremely well done and knitted together perfectly.  You will feel like you know these people and you're right there alongside what's going on.

I have only two complaints with the film - one is that the English captions are not entirely accurate to what's actually being said, even to the point of changing the name of the series from ""Unser Mutter, Unser Vater"" to ""Generation War"" because they thought that would appeal to an American audience more (I suppose).  Aside from the title, knowing a bit of German, the sub-titles and translations aren't quite right in a number of places.  Still, nothing major is lost due to this and it's not something that should keep anyone from buying this movie.  My bigger complaint, which occurs in virtually all films made by Germany dealing with either war, is the seemingly irresistible urge to apologize for being the ""bad guy"" and painting themselves as ""the bad guys"" in virtually every situation.  This film was largely escaping that until the final hour (or so), when the Reich falls apart.  Then, we see an unbelievably kind female Soviet officer who steps in to save the day, and well disciplined Soviet troops who follow her orders, and Soviet troops at the end of the war behaving honorably, taking prisoners, and generally seeming to be all-around nice guys.  That did bother me a bit, but I have watched this three times now and I would HIGHLY recommend this film to ANY WWII history buff.

I know that this film deserves an intelligent review but I am unable to do so, having just drenched my emotions in 4 captivating hours of this amazing work. Excellent direction, editing, sound, cinematography, acting, and screenplay. This film is so important toward understanding the basic premise that war kills humans on both sides, that all involved suffer, that politicians espousing war generally lie about its necessity, (except in self-preservation defenses) every high school student should see it. Instead of video games that glorify war, social science educators need to show young people that war is not the lovely heroic adventure army recruiters and history books paint. It is graphic, brutal, destructive, painful, and horrible in every sense. Clint Eastwood produced a film years back that took us into the Japanese soldier's psyche, and this so perfectly expresses the complexities of the lives of German soldiers and citizenry. What makes Generation War stand out is that it also looks at anti-semitism from every conceivable angle-the Germans who stole their apartments and cheered The Fuhrer; the Ukrainians who joined the SS as prison guards; the Poles who hated Jews more than Germans despite being thrust into war because of them. It showed duty to country as machinated by informing on Jews, and then facing the karma of being the victim in the same game, which was symbolic of how we are all victims even when we think we are waging war for some bizarre vision of a nationalistic utopia. War like death makes cowards of us all, makes losers of all involved.",1401062400,91,1611,5.037453183520599
6259258,4,B00ID8HATK,"There is both good and bad here, but I think the good outweighs the bad.  Some reviewers have commented that the show lets Germans off the hook by showing them as basically good guys screwing up.  I did not see that.

Hannah Arendt frighteningly, but brilliantly talked about the banality of evil and this show tries to show that concept.  There are lots of other shows where Germans are seen as uniquely bad . . . over there, those guys.  This show tries to explain how evil can come to any group.

One of the five leads is an opportunist who nicely compartmentalizes her life and avoids unpleasantness; one is naive like a little child and dutifully refuses to think for herself until it's too late; one is gung-ho about manliness/war until he truly understands it (and this theme is echoed by young ignorant teenagers at the end of the show); one is a gentle, intellectual who bucks the system until he just can't, then becomes more monstrous than he could have imagined and refuses to take the monster home; one is the face of victimization from so many angles (parents' denial and wishful thinking; Nazi and Polish anti-semitism; the desire of people to forget or minimize and move on; etc).

The worst Nazi offenders find a soft landing and do it with tacit approval of the rescuers; common German families are seen as struggling in poverty and only too happy to have a scapegoat they can abuse as a way of venting frustration and anger; military leaders are seen (mostly) as clever sociopaths who bring out the worst in men and consign them to the dirty details of war.  Really, there are so many themes here worth discussing.  And that's the point of the film: it was made for German families to discuss WWII, bring the generations together and make them more resilient against such forces in the future.  Having said all that, the ending was jarring for me and I wish they had simply ended without doing the before and after comparison (joltingly jolly when one needs to be reflective).",1401062400,4,1995,4.642045454545454

6259260,5,B00ID8HATK,"As a WWII history buff, I was eager to view this series, but I did go into it having read the negative reviews about how it paints the Germans as victims (to an extent) and offers a rather unfavorable depiction of the Polish. Having watched it now, I have to strongly disagree with a lot of the criticisms of this series. The brothers are in the Wehrmacht, not the SS, so to me, it is more than reasonable not to see them portrayed as mindless, zombie-esque Nazis. Certainly, there were vehement Nazis in the Wehrmacht as well, but there are many accounts of men fighting due to loyalty to Germany rather than Hitler and Nazism; there are accounts of men such as this being resentful of the SS and their arrogance and preferential treatment. If one or both of the brothers had been in the SS and the series focused on their internal battle between right and wrong in regards to Nazism and anti-Semitism, then I would have found it much less realistic.

As far as the portrayal of the Polish, I don't find much to pour scorn on there, either. A lot of people like to look at the war with a straight line down the middle with the Germans on the ""bad"" side and everyone else on the ""good"" side. Generally speaking about WWII, that may be fitting, but when you break it down to an individual perspective regarding every single person as a human being, it just doesn't work. Not all Germans were bad; not all of them were good, either. The same can be said for all of us, including those in the Polish resistance. I didn't walk away from this taking the main Jewish character's encounter with the Polish resistance group as a rule-of-thumb. The anti-Semitism was not representative of every partisan (take the Bielski brothers, for instance), just with the group he happened to fall in with. It's plausible.

There were plenty of Nazi-compliant Germans portrayed here. Perhaps not to an excessive degree in our heroes and heroines, but with them being the crux of the story, they were presented to us in a way that would make us want to root for them and pity their circumstances, or understand their reactions to certain situations, whether we agreed with them or not.

- Great production values: excellent battle scenes and photography throughout, though not nearly as much action as Band of Brothers.
- Depicts German perspective.  Surprise: the Germans weren't zombies, they were human beings just like us.
- Reasonably good drama as far as characters and story lines go.  Enough to keep you interested.

Cons:
- A bit slow at times; leaves you yearning for more combat scenes.
- Ridiculous resurrections of multiple dead characters.
- You get the feeling they struggled to find snow; very little of this even looks like Russia or Ukraine, and more broadly they don't really depict many of the horrors of the Eastern front--the starvation, the freezing, the wounded left to die in the cold, etc.  See Beevor's Stalingrad for a sense of what it was really like.

Philosophical babble:

I noted the fact that this show depicts the German perspective as a Pro, and it is.  But there is controversy about (a) how sympathetically it portrays the Germans, (b) how little it shows of German atrocities, and (c) how it makes the Polish partisans into anti-semites.

(a): The show portrays the Germans as basically nice guys even while they invade Russia and kill millions of people.  It is like Das Boot in that it portrays ordinary Germans as victims of an evil elite that they despise.  This is a white wash of history.  Although it's true that the Nazis never won a majority in a popular election, it's just not credible to pretend that ordinary Germans by and large hated their regime and were ignorant of or unwilling to abet atrocities.  If anything, the Nazi leadership--basically a bunch of beer-tent Bavarians--were the ordinary Germans, and those who resisted them were old-guard Prussian elites, especially high ranking military professionals.  It's absurd to portray the Germans as the real victims of WWII.

Even the soundtrack is disturbing-it tries to keep an upbeat, modern, fun vibe while depicting the Nazi war machine.  Obviously the Nazis were people too, made jokes, fell in love, etc., but this movie makes many of them heroes, and downplays what was obviously raging anti-semitism.  The main characters all share a Jewish friend.  A major subplot involves a central character trying to save a Jew.  When another character turns in a Jew, she doesn't really mean to, she wallows with regret, and even then nothing bad happens to the Jew.  I'm sure stuff like this happened here and there, but the overall effect is deeply misleading.  It's just not true that significant numbers of Germans were trying to help the Jews-just the opposite.

Meanwhile, (b), there is hardly any mention of the death camps, or even the Einsatzgruppen that would have been all too easy to show in Russia.  There are just one or two brief references--no display at all of ordinary Germans shooting tens of thousands of innocent men, women and children in the back of the neck at point blank range.  (See Browning's Ordinary Men and Goldhagen's (slightly unhinged) Hitler's Willing Executioners.)

As for (c), the show makes a point of emphasizing the anti-semitism of the Poles, to the point of showing them indifferent to Jews being sent off to death camps.  This is historically true of many WWII era Poles, so that's not the problem.  But there's a disturbing subtext, something like, ""See everyone?  We weren't the only anti-semites around; we weren't really all that bad by the standards of the time.""  But this is, again, absurd.  Polish and American anti-semitism of the 1940s was bad, but only the Germans built death-camps, which, apart from some train rides, never figure here.

German commentators have noticed the frosty American reception of this show, and have replied that we have our extermination of the native Americans, slavery, and Vietnam.  All true.  But then we don't make movies in which the real victims of slavery were the poor white people.  Obviously slavers were people too, fell in love, etc., but that doesn't make it a good idea to produce movies about how fun and loveable slave owners were while carefully avoiding any serious portrayal of the horrors of slavery.

6259267,5,B00ID8HATK,"I wasn't sure they would release it here in the States. I was able to watch it on YouTube without subtitles before they pulled it. The music, the cinematography, the battle scenes and acting are top notch. If you are a fan of quality WWII movies this one should be at the top of your list.",1398297600,64,289,4.178571428571429
6259268,5,B00ID8HATK,"The one star reviews which bring down the overall rating are by people who bought the French version which will only run on a Region 2 DVD or Blue Ray player and only has French subtitles to the German (and some Polish) dialogue of the film, so were naturally unhappy.  Amazon should have weeded those out from the yet to be released in 2014 U.S. version which has all 5 star reviews best I can see.  Having read Anthony Lane's review in the New Yorker and A.O. Scott's in the NY Times, I ordered the German version (with only German subtitles) and watched it at least twice, as it moves at a fast clip and was hard to absorb fully in one viewing.  (I am American but fluent in German.)  The film was a major hit on German TV (7 million viewers) and the BBC2 aired it in January as only the 2nd foreign language series since 2001, to similar enthusiasm.  Some Poles objected and some others that it was not Schindler's List or a holocaust movie and some that the Russians are portrayed as just bad, but I didn't get that at all:  it is also not justified by the story.  These criticisms seem based on a lackadaisical viewing or incomprehension that they are artistically unmerited because beyond the scope of this drama, which was to show how a group of young Germans who had been 12 or 13 when Hitler came to power become progressively disillusioned, indeed shocked and brutalized at and by the barbarity of their country.  And as one of the 5 friends is Jewish that aspect is hardly ignored.  Some reviewers have said it has the best combat sequences of any WWII movie, but it both is and is not a war movie.  Thought the young German actors and actresses were very fine.  I thought it superior to Saving Private Ryan (which is a favorite of mine) and Band of Brothers, ti which some parts are similar.",1396656000,190,1804,4.403614457831325

8641065,5,B00ID8HATK,"Wonderfully compelling, a real history lesson told with artistry and fairness.  Nice to see the other side shown with some balance.  No excuses presented for Germany's horrible contribution to the central event of the Twentieth Century, which is as it should be.  But also succeeds in showing human beings making choices, some good and some bad, and the consequences of those choices.",1529971200,,384,5.161290322580645
8641066,5,B00ID8HATK,Best mini-series I've seen in years. It is German WW2 by Germans with no punches pulled. The subs were really good which I much prefer to having it dubbed.,1528675200,,155,4.379310344827586
8641067,4,B00ID8HATK,A very good mini-series if you do not mind plot twists. Told from the German side which was interesting. The enthusiasm in the start of the Russian war is amazing on the German. Then they realize they are going to lose their lives change. The most amazing thing is that even when losing they continue to fight.,1527552000,,310,4.456140350877193
