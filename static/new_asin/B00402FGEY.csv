4237737,2,B00402FGEY,"I bought this set for the Bette Davis movie, and didn't expect first-rate reproduction for the other two early films, but had seen an excellent version of this title, available on DVD. However, what I got was garish color, with an unpleasant graininess which made watching the movie painfully uncomfortable after having seen a beautifully produced copy. What a shame, to ruin such a fine film classic. The Bishop's Wife, on the other hand, was quite acceptable, so the purchase was not entirely a loss.",1322611200,22,502,4.91764705882353
4237738,4,B00402FGEY,"This is a good set- especially for the price.  I would hope that ""March of the Wooden Soldiers"" would either have or BE the colorized version, as this is what Stan Laurel wanted in the first place- to be in color or filmed in color, according to his daughter Lois.  I doubt whether ""The Bishop's Wife"" is in color.  Turner colorized it and for what it's worth, just about all black and white movies about Christmas should be in color, not for the sake of it, but because there's color in Christmas anyway.  In regards to the ""Bishop's WIfe"", ONLY one scene is worth it for the color.  It's the scene where Cary Grant as the angel decorates a Christmas tree in roughly one minute.  It's NOTHING in black and white, but in color it just reigns the Christmas spirit.  That's all.  ""Pocketful of Miracles"" is a good fun movie where once again, Bette Davis shines as Apple Annie.  She's the main reason for owning that film.",1322179200,,919,4.455089820359281
4237739,5,B00402FGEY,"I bought this collection for ""The Bishop's Wife"" with Cary Grant, Loretta Young, and David Niven.  This movie is so much better than the remake!  I haven't viewed the other movies yet.",1319241600,7,184,4.71875
4237740,5,B00402FGEY,I received this video very quickly and in perfect condition.  My 8 year old granddaughter has become bored with my current crop of kids videos so I tried this one out on her.  She likes The Bishop's Wife but lost interest in the other two films.  I like them though.,1315440000,,266,4.28
4237741,4,B00402FGEY,"This holiday collection features two bona fide classics ('March of the Wooden Soldiers' and 'The Bishop's Wife'-- 5 stars each) and a curiosity (Frank Capra's overblown 1961 remake of his own 1933 classic 'Lady for a Day'-- 3 stars).  All three are worth owning and, as individual releases seem to appear and disappear with some frequency, this is an easy, economical way to have them.  Note that Amazon's specs are incorrect, however, in that this set actually features two discs, one containing 'Pocketful of Miracles' and a flipper with the other two films.",1302912000,37,560,5.010752688172043
4237742,5,B00402FGEY,"I bought this DVD in order to get The Bishop's Wife, which is a great movie with a stellar cast. This is a great DVD!",1294876800,18,117,3.72
4237743,4,B00402FGEY,"Hey you can't go wrong with these movies all three are top notch movies that can be watched anytime.  L&H movie is still funny but it does drag on when they decide to add ""musical Merryment"" to the movie.  Bishop's Wife a soft movie with Loretta Young and Cary Grant and a great supporting cast who do a wonderful job in making this a feel good Christmas movie with a nice message included.  Pocketfull of Miracles is a good movie probably made three times before, but I just can't remember what the names of this movie are. Those of us who have hear or seen other movies of Damon Runyon's stories will appreciate the old New York when the crooks were named ""Dave the Dude"", ""Horse face Harry"", ""Broadway""  Mr. Runyon's stories brought insight in to the class warfare in the 20's, 30's and probably into the early ""40's"".  I.e. making fun of what was though by many to be the thing.",1365292800,,882,4.419753086419753
4237744,5,B00402FGEY,"Loved these movies!
Good old fashioned movies, that leave you will a light heart, and a smile on your lips.
They just don't make good movies like this any more.",1361664000,,160,4.366666666666666
4237745,5,B00402FGEY,The Bishop's Wife is one of the best Holiday movies there is.  And it's cheaper with the 3-pack than by itself.,1356912000,,111,4.285714285714286
4237746,5,B00402FGEY,"These three movies are favorites of mine, except that the Laurel and Hardy is a lot dated.  You should enjoy tthe other two and this collection makes a great inexpensive gift.",1356566400,,175,4.645161290322581
4237747,5,B00402FGEY,My 4 year old granddaughter came over while I watching it. She loved it! We bought it and watch it together!,1329004800,,108,4.190476190476191
4237748,2,B00402FGEY,"I bought this mainly for Pocket Full Of Miracles, which has always been a favorite film of mine.  This version has been butchered.  One whole scene is missing (where Ann-Margret asks Betty Davis to come live with them in Spain), others are shortened, and many are just snippets, badly edited.  Don't waste your money.",1327968000,,317,4.833333333333333
4237749,5,B00402FGEY,"I bought this movie collection for my elderly Mom for Christmas. Last count over the past two months was that she's watched The Bishop's Wife about 15 times. When she finds something she likes, she will wear it out. I also enjoyed watching the movie with her and thought that the picture quality was great quality on her HD TV. I am always glad when I can buy her something she will enjoy and this one was a plus. This is a great holiday collection and the quality appeared very good. You can't do better than Cary Grant as the angel in the Bishop's Wife, all performances in the movie are great. The other movies included are just icing on the cake.",1327276800,2,650,4.336065573770492
4237750,5,B00402FGEY,"I bought this threesome for The Bishop's Wife.  It is a favorite holiday movie with an all star cast: David Niven, Cary Grant, Loretta Young, Gladys Cooper, Monty Wolley, Regis Toomey, James Gleason, Elsa Lanchester. Getting two more holiday classics with it was an added Christmas gift.  It would be more than worth it at twice the price.",1327104000,,339,4.827586206896552
4237751,5,B00402FGEY,"Our family has a long tradition of always watching a particular set of movies whenever the Christmas season arrives. As such, we've slowly been trying to acquire digital copies of all our holiday favorites to replace our aging VHS collection. One of those movies is The Bishop's Wife. While looking around for prices on a DVD copy of the movie, I was surprised to see listed on Amazon the DVD of that single movie for about three times the price of this box set. Not being one for special features, I thought it looked like an excellent deal, and it was. I can't speak for the other movies in the set but I have no complaints as to The Bishop's Wife. I'm sure that there is sufficient room for improvement, but after being used to the VHS edition, I'm more than happy with this version, especially when considering the price and that it will most likely only be enjoyed around the Christmas season. This single movie alone makes the collection well worth the price.

Also, the only special feature for The Bishop's Wife is the inclusion of the theatrical trailer, which I am quite glad for as it was also included with the VHS edition I'd enjoyed for so many years.",1326844800,2,1165,4.521327014218009
4237752,4,B00402FGEY,"I purchased this MGM Movie Collection to get 'The Bishops Wife (with Cary Grant, Lorrett Young and David Niven PLUS a bunch of supporting actors).  To me its the best of Christmas past and a great story.  The CD shipped on time and even arrived a day early.  No issue no problems.  The other two movies were OK.  March of the Wooden Soldiers is really a Laural & Hardy vehicle with some big name stars of the day.  And Pocketful of Miricles is a very predictalbe story that is meant to pull at your heart strings with Betty Davis and Glenn Ford.

All in all its a great Christmas CD.",1326499200,,583,4.245454545454545
4237753,5,B00402FGEY,Always a pleasure dealing with Amazon.  Products usually arrive before date listed on receipt.  Price very good.  movies are classic.  Thanks.,1326326400,,142,5.619047619047619
4237754,3,B00402FGEY,"I was surprised, and dismayed that the March of the Wooden Soldiers was not on the disc.  To the credit of those who I got it from, they refunded my money.",1326326400,,155,4.0
4237755,5,B00402FGEY,I enjoyed these Christmas movies and viewing them brought back some childhood memories.  The content is wholesome and family oriented.,1326153600,,134,5.7
4237756,4,B00402FGEY,Bought for 'Bishop's Wife'. Carey Grant is a hunk & funny. Nice perk to get 3 movies. Rec'd quickly & in terrific condition.,1325894400,,124,4.434782608695652
4237757,5,B00402FGEY,"If you like classic movies, you will really enjoy this collection. My favorite is The Bishops Wife, but I am a huge Cary Grant fan.",1325462400,,131,4.28
4237758,5,B00402FGEY,"I'd been looking for quite sometime the dvd version of: 'The Bishop's Wife'. The movie I'd seen years before, and was again a delightful experience all over again. It's a Christmas story within a story, and as with most contain an angel sent there to help with the realization of Christmas, and the true meaning of it. This dvd, also contains two other movies that only add to the pleasure. ""March of the Wooden Soldiers' starring Oliver & Hardy is a great family classic that's endurred throughout the years, as is ""Pocketful of Miricles'. I give this collection - a three thumbs-up!",1325376000,,584,4.735294117647059
4237759,5,B00402FGEY,dont know bought as a gift for a friend did not watch this video so i can not review it at this time,1324252800,,100,3.391304347826087
4237760,1,B00402FGEY,"As I bought this collection primarily for ""Pocketful of Miracles"", I was very dissappointed in the quality from MGM to say the least. I bought this collection over the single copy available due to a more recent year of release. I was hoping for anamorphic widescreen (No side bars). Not only was it the old widescreen edition (not adapted for Widescreen TVs), but the extreme graininess, and I am not exagerating when I say EXTREME, as well as the overall poor color made it unwatchable!! It hurts to see a Billy Wilder classic with Bette Davis that deserves better distributed like this. Please, If anyone knows of a good quality pressing of this movie let me know. Don't waist even $6.99 on this collection!! You've been warned!",1323561600,9,730,4.755905511811024
4237761,4,B00402FGEY,This great DVD  pack was purchased as a Christmas gift.  He loved it and watched Pocketful of Miracles Christmas night!  We were only looking for that movie but found this great three for one DVD pack that included three classic movies for an unbelievable price.  As described and shipped fast!!!,1323388800,,296,4.86
4237762,4,B00402FGEY,I bought this DVD because I wanted a colorized version of The Bishop's Wife.  The only movie colorized was A Pocketful of Miracles!  This really should have been in the item description.  I am keeping the DVD because of the price and the fact I can't find a color copy of The Bishop's Wife anyway.  I had called MGM directly from the phone number on the back of the DVD and they said they don't have a colorized version of The Bishop's Wife.,1322956800,4,441,4.27710843373494

8411781,4,B00402FGEY,"Bought this specifically for The Bishop's Wife. I love Cary Grant and David Niven. Loretta Young is a plus. Watched A Pocketful of Miracles and enjoyed that show. Not really a Christmas movie in the sense that I would think of one, but good movie nonetheless. Also, I love Babes in Toyland. Very long, though. But a good video to have in my library.",1417219200,,349,4.46875

8411783,5,B00402FGEY,"This is a great collection.  Everyone's talking especially about THE BISHOP'S WIFE and yes, that is a Christmas classic.  But the Laurel & Hardy MARCH OF THE WOODEN SOLDIERS  is a marvelous film also, being a version of BABES IN TOYLAND.  A POCKETFUL OF MIRACLES is a good film to fill out the trilogy.  All in all, this is a good buy.",1384560000,,335,4.338709677419355
