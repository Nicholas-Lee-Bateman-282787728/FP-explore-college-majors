8733667,5,B015I145WO,"At its best, which is often, this series rivals 'The Defenders,' which set the standard for courtroom drama without the Perry Mason cliches. I'd recommend not watching the first TV movie that launched the series until getting through the rest of the episodes, as it is not representative of the quality of the show, or of the relationships between the trio of attorney at Nichols, Darrell and Darrell (not to be confused with Larry, Daryl and Daryl). Heavyweight topics (abortion, immigration, depression) are explored with insight and eloquence. Picture quality is far below what we'd prefer from a DVD but it won't mar the viewing experience all that much. Highly recommended.",1501718400,,678,5.117117117117117

8733670,4,B015I145WO,I just received my copy and it appears that the shows are edited. The original length was 50 minutes plus and these episodes are running 46 minutes. The picture quality is comparable to the syndicated episodes that were shown on COZI TV. The main reason I bought it was to see episodes not shown in syndication but I was disappointed in the overall product.,1449964800,6,357,4.59375

8733672,4,B015I145WO,"Let's grant the complaints of previous reviewers about the visual quality of these ""Bold Ones"" series sets. While I'm still waiting for my copy to arrive, based on the two previous sets (""The Senator"" & ""The Protectors"") I can guess that there'll be scratches, artifacts, fading, etc. But since these are likely to be the only version that viewers will ever get, what matters here is a review of the stories themselves. As with the previous sets, I'm basing this on what I saw on one of those retro-TV channels recently, as well as memories of when the series first ran. When I do receive my copy, I'll amend this review.

Like all of the ""Bold Ones"" series, ""The Lawyers"" dealt with contemporary issues, often in ways that previous TV shows hadn't. The lawyers were decent men, but more realistic as lawyers -- they represented clients they didn't necessarily like, or even knew were guilty -- but their job was to provide the best defense for those clients. And in doing so, many thorny questions about the law, justice, morality & ethics were raised -- not always with neat, satisfying conclusions, either.

For example, what does a lawyer do after defending a man accused of murder & getting him acquitted, only to have him drunkenly reveal afterward that he's indeed guilty? Double jeopardy protects him from being tried again for the same crime, and the lawyer is bound by confidentiality to say nothing to the police. But what about the moral obligation to the community?

Sometimes the courtroom scenes were the merest pretext for a deeper examination of changing mores, as this was the end of the 1960s & the beginning of the 1970s. Race, sexuality, class, money, power -- all were grist for the mill in this program. To modern viewers, some of the acting & writing may seem a little formal, since it's from another era of TV. But for the times, the show was pushing the still-very-thick envelope of what was then permissible on network TV. Viewers should keep that in mind, as it'll allow them to view the show as a valuable time capsule of then-current social attitudes & the immense changes in progress throughout the country.

And all that aside, these are simply well-written, engaging stories that both entertain & make the viewer think a little bit as well. If you can adjust to the inevitable so-so quality of the available prints -- something probably easier for an older viewer, I'll admit -- then you may find yourself engrossed in some very good storytelling. It's a touch more mainstream than the rare brilliance of ""The Senator"" but it's solid work.  With that caveat about the visual aspect, highly recommended!

Edit - 1/7/2016 - Having received & watched the DVD set, the two pilot films are indeed the worse for wear, with artifacts, scratches, and occasional washed-out color. The stories themselves, however, are quite good, particularly the first pilot, ""The Sound of Anger"". I'd always thought of Lynda Day (not yet Lynda Day George at that point) as a pleasant but lightweight actress. Here's she's given something to sink her acting teeth into, and she makes the most of it. And the overall story is taut, with twists & surprise along the way, right up until the last scene.

The second pilot (""The Whole World is Watching"") isn't quite as strong, but it is fascinating to see as a snapshot of the times, with campus unrest & a Governor of California (a fictional stand-in for Ronald Reagan) who precipitates needless tragedy by his hardline tactics. But the story doesn't hesitate to indict the sort of protester who welcomes & encourages police violence, either. And in both pilots, we see the lead characters engaging in some morally gray actions on behalf of their clients, all justified as doing their best to win their case -- whether they believe their clients are innocent or guilty. This was a jolt for audiences then, who were used to spotless, crusading defense attorneys as the heroes of TV series. This makes them much more interesting to watch.

The series as a whole is well-written & well-acted, with the characterization of the leads maintained throughout. Burl Ives is especially good as the wily older attorney who's pretty much seen it all, and suffers fewer qualms than his younger partners. Oh, they all want to see justice done -- but their first job is always to get their clients acquitted, and some of them clearly don't deserve it. All in all, a thoughtful, often visually striking series, well worth watching!",1447286400,18,4470,4.81877444589309
