8735100,4,B015YCPMSS,it takes about a month or more for it to deliver with standard shipping. I got it and was super excited!! If you are going to buy this product please know that the case is the only decoration and that the dvd is put in a secure box inside of the case. I honestly think it was worth the wait though,1472688000,,297,3.8852459016393444

8735102,5,B015YCPMSS,"Beautifully packaged! I got what I expected. Even on a tiny DVD player the quality was great and subtitles match up with the dialogue perfectly.
I also got Season 3 apparently which I didn't know was included with it, so that was a great bonus! Thanks so much! Unless I got something different for some random reason, the pics do not match up to what I received, but this isn't a negative comment as what I got exceeded my expectations :) Also says there is only 1 disk, but I received two. The pics are of what I received. Hope this helps anyone looking for a great deal!",1456876800,3,572,4.305555555555555
