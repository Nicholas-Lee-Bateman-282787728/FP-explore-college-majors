3957760,5,B002N695VY,"I bought this because I was burned out on Zumba. This DVD has refreshed my exercise routine. It's great for beginners. After having my second child 5 months ago, my hips would lock up. I couldn't sit down for long periods because of them. This DVD has helped with that problem. It has a great warm-up routine that works the abs really well. I sweated buckets during this workout. I plan on buying more from this artist.",1278460800,5,419,4.454545454545454
3957761,3,B002N695VY,"I have participated in parades during carnival in the West Indies. I had expected more of a workout of soca, reggae, etc similar to what is done during the road march portion of J'ouvert.  None the less, for a novice, the dvd would be ok. I probably will not watch the dvd again.",1270512000,,279,4.264150943396227
3957762,3,B002N695VY,"I love Quenia Ribeiro and her beautiful backup dancers.  The first DVD is my favorite workout DVD, I do it 3-4 times a week.

Unfortunately this second one is nothing like the first one.  Differences:

1) Where's the band? It was so fun to watch the drummers while dancing.
2) No more 'From the top! *pats top of head*'. You learn a couple moves, link them together, then never go back to them.
3) In the first DVD, there was a 'From the top!' after every new step. Not only did this make it better for learning, but seemed like better exercise to me.
4) Probably related to #3, this one seemed more advanced.  I was lost a whole lot more than I was in the first DVD.

In my opinion, the music was a lot worse in this one.  And, without the men there drumming, there was nothing at all to see, just the three dancers and a blue drape behind them.  Compare that to something like Island Girl Dance Fitness Workout: Tahitian Cardio & Hip Hop (which I bought at the same time as this one) and the difference is amazing.  Plain blue drape vs beautiful Hawaii background.

I'll probably use this DVD again, but not too often. With the first one, time flew and I never checked my watch.  This one I was glancing at it every couple minutes, seeing if I had done enough to be able to stop.

And as a minor point: The DVD cover is horribly photoshopped. She looks nothing like that.  She's a normal-sized, wonderful looking woman! No need to make her appear twig-thin!",1269907200,9,1459,4.319852941176471
3957763,3,B002N695VY,"I like the mix of yoga moves, hip action swivels, etc. but the MUSIC...this is supposed to be a samba reggae...what it is, is somebody banging on a drum with the same beat the whole way through the DVD. Samba music is vibrant and upbeat. I think the music should be changed to what the title of the DVD implies and I think all of us who have bought this DVD should get a free copy of a new one with Samba music in the background.",1268611200,5,429,4.0
3957764,5,B002N695VY,"Created by the dynamic Quenia Ribeiro for beginner and intermediate students, in her ""Welcome"" portion, Quenia says that even if we are just starting out, we will learn by repetition, and if the movements are too difficult at first, to ""...modify them to suit your needs.""

The 2nd part is a super-stretchy, extensive (approximately 20 minutes) and effective warm-up. Beyond learning the samba on this DVD, this warm-up would serve as a superb workout for those who just want to get in some daily yoga based stretches and poses for agility and strength building.

Quenia then takes the choreography in sections, repeating until it becomes familiar, and then, when putting it all together, steps up the tempo bit by bit. The steps themselves are simple, but you can get a fantastic aerobic workout by the time you're done. Only the most athletic will survive the final top speed version, but it's great to watch Quenia and her 2 assistants, Nao Yamada and Lisa Green, move with such blazing gusto. There is a lovely cool-down at the end, to catch one's breath, and savor the enjoyment of dance. Well produced and with percussive music by Nick Birmelin to keep us going, I like that this DVD can be played straight through, or be used with the menu by sections.

Quenia has so much energy, charisma, and Brazilian charm, that she makes working up a sweat a delightful event. She is both at the same time incredibly strong and as limber as a rubber band, and watching her is a joy. She is also extremely knowledgeable, so you know you're learning to dance from the best of the best, and most of all, as she says, ""Have fun!""",1266969600,10,1621,4.660839160839161
3957765,4,B002N695VY,"I loved the previous Samba Reggae workout and was excited to receive her new dvd.  I will say that it was a great workout and met my expectations.  The reason I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 is because of the format.  In her previous dvd she would teach a step and then you'd do the routine and after each new move you learned you would put them all together....With this workout she teaches all the steps in the beginning and at the end you put everything together.  While I am not saying the moves were difficult, it;s hard to remember which moves come next, especially at such a fast pace. I found myself thrown off at times trying when doing the entire routine trying to remember which step should follow the previous.  Had the instructional followed the same format as the previous dvd, this would have been a really good video.",1263340800,19,833,4.4183006535947715
3957766,5,B002N695VY,"Quenia Ribeiro returns just in time to help us all shed some holiday pounds or simply join in the fun of ""Brazilian Carnaval"", a sizzling samba reggae dance work out which lives up to everything a work out can be. Samba is a popular Brazilian dance.
To initiate the program, Quenia welcomes the viewer to her Bahia style samba and a brief history. This program is open to beginners and intermediate dancers or those looking for fun, exercise,or in search of modifying weight issues.
The warm up is superb and rich in length with variations of yoga poses, seated and standing forward bends, down dogs, quad and hamstring stretches. This lady is amazing and energetic, her warm up sequence is so detailed which any dancer can benefit from. This section alone is a great work out if you are just beginning to dance and desire a structured strength and flexibility program. I loved it so I decided to move forward.
Next, get ready for the choreography. Three sections with impacting non-stop dance combinations, so pick your pace from the menu. The dance tutorial section is first, and combined with the slow pace section, but every step is illustrated at a slow pace. Quenia elaborates the Bahia basic samba step layered with various arm movement, earthy triple steps, circle step variations in turns, hip rotations, level changes.  When you are ready, turn it up a notch and change the pace to the medium and accelerated tempos, all the more challenging especially during weight transitions, hops, and front and back steps. I suggest practicing the combinations at great length before changing tempos as you can get lost in between if you don't follow closely. The combinations are easily attainable, the challenge: put it all together and try to keep up with Quenia and her dancers!
To finalize the program a brief cool down follows with similar poses and stretches from the warm up.
If you are a beginner to samba or just beginning to exercise, this is simply fun aerobic dance instruction and total body workout program. The hour and fifteen minutes  will pay off on the dance floor, or simply help you get into those ""all of a sudden tight jeans,""  which seems to be my goal these days.",1260057600,3,2188,4.783068783068783
3957767,5,B002N695VY,"This dvd is the second in the Samba Reggae dance series.  It is an excellent cardiovascular workout as well as being a lot of fun.  It is quite different from her first samba reggae workout as such there is no problem in owning both of them.  Here is a breakdown of the dvd:

Warm-up - this is a 25 minute thorough warm up from head to toe.  If you have her samba cardio workout dvd, the warm-up is very similar.  Standing stretches, abs, seated stretches and back stretches. Very nice. Quenia is accompanied by two dancers who I believe were in her last dvd.

Step by Step instruction + workout.  This is the longest of the workout sections. About 25 minutes.  The tempo is at a slow pace. The music for the workout sections is different from the previous dvd.  It is all percussion with a senuous swing to it. Hard to describe, but I loved it.  In the step by step instruction, Quenia goes over the choreography in sections. There are 5 sections with easy to learn steps in each section.  She goes from the top a couple of times in each section.  Here is the difference from her previous dvd.  Once you learn a section, you move on to the next one.  You don't repeat from the top from the very beginning of the previous sections. Once you have learned the choreography in a slow temp she moves on to the samba reggae transitions steps that are in between each workout. If I had one complaint is that she doesn't repeat the slow tempo workout from the top without instruction at least 1x through.

Medium tempo-  After the slow tempo, the choreography is repeated 1x through at a medium tempo.  To me this was fast. The section is followed by the samba reggae transition steps at a medium pace.  About 7 minutes long.

Fast tempo - Same choreography repeated 1x through at warp speed, followed by the samba reggae transition steps at warp speed. About 7 minutes

Cool Down - About 5 minutes, neck, arm, back stretches.  Seated hamstring stretches.  Very nice.

I liked this dvd a lot.  What makes it challenging  is not the choreography; I got it the first time through.  It is keeping up with the speed of the dance.  Progess is being able to do it at the medium and fast pace AND keep up.  The first I did the dvd, I just did the wam-up and the step by step workout and I was sweating bullets.  The second time I did the warm-up and the medium and fast workouts only.  The workout didn't seem as complete to me AND I wasn't able to keep up.  So unless you are in great cardio shape, I suggest that you do all of the workouts, even after you learn the choreography. Which leads me to the cons.

Cons:  As I said earlier my only complaint is that the step by step was not separated from the slow pace workout.  It should have been. The step by step should have had its own section. If you are not ready for the faster tempos, you are left with going through the step by step over and over again.  My suggestion is to keep moving and do the steps as she is explaining them to keep you heart rate up.

Overall: Great choreography and music.  Quenia is a delightful teacher. If you love Brazilian dance, then get this dvd.  Your heart will thank you. Obrigada Quenia",1258934400,35,3164,4.325383304940375
3957778,5,B002N695VY,"This is a fantastic workout. The warmup segment is a great ""get ready for the day"" routine even if you don't have time for the whole workout. It's the most thorough stretch I've done in a while. I've been trying to follow the notion that ""the best exercise is the exercise you will do"". I will do this because it is fun.

3957843,5,B002N695VY,"I'm over 60 and out of shape and was just looking for something - ANYTHING - that would make me want to stand up for longer than 10 minutes and MOVE.  I purchased this DVD as well as her other DVD called Samba Reggae Workout in the hopes that it was something different and would at least get me off the couch.  And I hit the Mother Lode.  Both of these DVDs are wonderful.  I'm not a dancer.  The reviews stating it's too hard to follow or she doesn't spend time teaching - who cares?  I'm not dancing in front of judges on Dancing With the Stars.  I'm not trying for perfect 10 scores.  I just want to move a bit.  What I do love more than anything is that there is no ""music"" to get bored with, no annoying backup dancer saying ""Whoo"" every two seconds.  It's strictly percussion/drums and her voice is soothing and not something you just want to mute instead of listen to.  I could put the sound track on ""repeat"" and leave it on all day and it would be fine.  So anyone looking for something a little different, I'd say go for it.  At any age, any level of dance (or not) and any fitness level.  I discovered I was winded quickly - and I should have been.  But I was having fun and that is what is inspiring.  Great products, great lady.",1347753600,4,1242,4.133891213389122
3957844,5,B002N695VY,"This DVD is great. I wanted a workout that would be enjoyable enough for me to do everyday because if it wasn't, I wouldn't do it. When I was younger all I did was dance but since going to college, I didn't have any time to do it anymore so I love a good dance workout. She starts out with a warm-up that lasts a little while, so if your not used to dancing or have ever been in a dance class it might seem a little long. But it gets you ready for the dance part later. And if you don't have a dancer's background,it's OK because she breaks down each step. And she even tells you to do everything at your own level. There is the break-down part, then she does the whole sequence of all the dances at a medium pace, and then at a fast pace so...pace yourself. You can even stop and watch her do them until you get the hang of it...that's the beauty of not being at a gym or going to a class with a whole bunch of people! I also love that she incorporates core exercises before you get stared dancing. In my opinion, this is a great workout that is fun enough for me to stick to. And since I'm not big on going to the gym,it's just perfect for me. Unlike most dance workouts, the Brazilian dance moves she teaches are really fun, and they really are dance moves you can use while going out. I can't wait to get her other DVDs, and I recommend this one.",1335657600,,1350,4.022304832713755

I think the audio quality of the music is also better than the first, making it easier to get into the mood.  I have her Cardio Samba workout as well, and liked this one much better.

I did sweat some, and my calves were on fire from the constant repetition of the basic samba move. The choreography was cool- had some really cute moves plugged in to make a lady feel sexy, hot! But the choreography was a bit more challenging (I suppose because there wasn't enough repetition of the segments as a whole- you learned a segment, and then another, and then another. They were combined at that the end only which would probably work for those with professional dance experience, or those with a keen memory, but this took away from the enjoyment of the workout for me.) I don't see this dvd ever being a staple in my collection...I will however, keep at it until I learn the entire choreography. I felt really good dancing, and know I will feel amazing after I've mastered the moves.",1482278400,,924,4.505952380952381
