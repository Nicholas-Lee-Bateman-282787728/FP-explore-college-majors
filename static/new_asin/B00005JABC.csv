8324687,4,B00005JABC,"Completely fascinating. I recommend this to anyone interested in space or the Russian space program. Filled with beautiful mixed media footage. I would give this documentary 5 stars if it weren't for the odd ""2001"" computer animation in the middle of the movie. I found it distracting from this otherwise wonderful movie.",1259712000,2,321,5.1923076923076925
