8320641,3,B001M8YL36,"When Johnny Briggs played Mike Baldwin on the British serial, ""Coronation Street,"" he created an unforgettable character for over thirty years. He had been entangled with many of the leading characters on the street especially the Deirdre and Ken Barlow, the street's iconic couple. In Britain, ""Coronation Street"" had only expected to last thirteen episodes according to Tony Warren, the creator and writer. The series has lasted over 50 years and counting. Johnny Briggs would leave the street in a memorable fashion with his character dying from Alzheimer's disease.

Johnny Briggs deserved a longer tribute. The DVD only lasts about twenty two minutes and no extra specials like clips from the past. Johnny Briggs would get a Queen's Honour when he was awarded the prestigious MBE (Member of the Order of the British Empire) in the Honours List for his services to television drama. It was a well-deserved honor. He joins other cast members like William Roache, Elizabeth Dawn, Betty Driver, Doris Speed, Tony Warren, Julie Goodyear, Jack Howarth, Eileen Derbyshire and Barbara Knox in the cast. I enjoyed listening to his castmates from the series like Amanda Barrie, Elizabeth Dawn, William Roache, Deirdre Kirkbride.

Mike Baldwin was the first character from the South to venture North for business and pleasure. He was definitely a welcome addition to the cast of this established series. This DVD would be perfect for the ideal Coronation Street fan. Johnny Briggs played Mike Baldwin well and beautifully. He will be sorely missed on the show's canvas.",1494720000,,1563,5.198412698412699
