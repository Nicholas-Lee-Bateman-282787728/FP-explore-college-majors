5558355,5,B00B5AP7NY,Great video....NOTHING LIKE THE GAME. But great video. we have already watched it 10 times. It is a good video if you are also into Legos.  goes hand and hand.,1368662400,4,159,4.3
5558356,4,B00B5AP7NY,"I like this movie.  Its funny, witty, full of action, just a little too short.

To start off my review, let me clear up that this film is NOT the cutscenes from Lego Batman 2: DC Superheroes.  This film is based on that game, but the entire film has been re-animated from the cutscenes and great action scenes replace gameplay.

Now that the cutscene controversy is cleared up, let me tell you about the film itself.

Firstly, the animation is brilliant.  LEGO did a great job on animating this film, especially in HD.  If you have a Blu-ray player, then buy this on Blu-ray for sure.

Secondly, the voice acting is very good.

Lastly, the story.  Based on the video game, the story for LEGO Batman is funny, witty, full of action and flows quickly.  Just a little too quickly.  At 71 minutes, this movie is barely a feature-length film.  Just when I was getting to this film, it was almost over.  LEGO should have made this film at least 90 minutes.  Then, my review would be five out of five for sure.

My other problem with this film is that it is not theatrically released.  This film is too good for a direct-to-DVD/Blu-ray release.  This film would have been great in 3D.

In conclusion, LEGO Batman: The Movie DC Superheroes Unite is a film well worth seeing.

I recommend this movie.",1365897600,26,1291,4.482758620689655

5558422,4,B00B5AP7NY,"Having seen The Lego Movie, I expected this to be similar but found it to be a more serious rendition of the Batman tale, and probably nothing like the more recent Batman Lego Movie which I've yet to see.  Beginning with the titles sequence in Legos copying the opening of the live-action Batman the Movie, and the use of the Batman and Superman themes from those films, the intent is immediately obvious that the story is going to proceed along those lines and not the more lighthearted and satirical tones of the latter.

It's enjoyable and the Lego constructs are interesting, and a good precursor to the later movies.

This movie was viewed as a DVD and no remuneration was involved in the writing of this review.",1498867200,,717,4.6299212598425195

5558424,5,B00B5AP7NY,"This is a different movie than the more recent Lego Batman- but still great! This is in the group of a couple of other Lego DC Super Heroes movies, which I also think are great.

It is a different story (not a remake (premake)), and excellent in its own right. Yes, there are superficial similarities, but it's not the same at all. [obvious spoiler alert] Sure, Batman and other superheroes fight Lex Luthor, Joker, and other villains; there's an escape from Arkham; villains interrupt a gathering and try to find the Batcave, but many other times does all that happen?

It's a few years older and doesn't have the flagship moviestar voice talent as the recent one, but they do a great job.

Its absolutely insulting however that this movie cost me $20.00 and somehow, this is the first time in my many years and many dollars spent that I am actually upset with Amazon. I can't even find a place to try to return this or dispute the purchase. No one in their right mind should pay $20.00 for a digital copy of a movie that is four years old. Unbelievable.

Perhaps one of the great things about the Lego Movies is that they manage to stay true to the Silver/Bronze Ages of DC comics while never, never taking themselves way too seriously.
In ""Batman The Movie - DC Super Heroes Unite,"" Lex Luthor decides that in order to win the upcoming presidential election, he needs to be more popular and likable like Bruce Wayne - who beat him out for the Gotham City's Man of the Year Award.  Fortunately for Lex, the Joker decides to crash the party, and this give old baldy an idea.  The Joker has a mind control gas that Lex must have if he wants be become President of the Untied States.
So Lex convinces the Joker to become his partner, only Lex forgot something very important - never trust the Joker.
Yet in order to defeat the new Lex/Joker teamup, Batman and Superman are going to have to dodge and defeat a giant robot and Lex's deadly new toy - the Deconstructor!

I was expecting something similar to The Lego Movie, but with 'Batman' as the main character instead of ""Emmet"".
My family found the quality to be less than desirable.
Couldn't keep my kids attention for more than a few minutes.

Pros:
None really.  Was a total waste.  My kids refuse to watch it again.

Additional Comments:
After re-reading some of the positive reviews for this, I cannot fathom we have the same movie.  Maybe our expectations were just too high, since we absolutely LOVED the Lego Movie, and Batman in that was great!  We've probably seen the Lego Movie 30+ times.  This just fell so short.  Maybe if we played the Lego Batman video game, we'd have liked the movie more?  Who knows.  Definitely wouldn't recommend this to anyone.  I'd rather see the Lego Movie 30 more times than see this once more.",1439942400,4,825,4.659722222222222

5558816,3,B00B5AP7NY,"Acting as a slight animated adaptation of the Lego Batman 2: DC Super Heroes, this also was its own separate direct-to-video movie. It features some footage from the actual video game, but largely contained original material. It was directed by Lego regular creator Jon Burton, no relation to Tim Burton, even though the movie features an opening similar to the first Batman movie from 1989. There's also music from this and the original Superman played throughout the film.

After an homage to Batman '89, Batman and Superman walk right into Lex Luthor's rotating pyramid HQ, and are flat out bested by him after using some Kryptonite on Supes and crashing a load on Bats. The story then jumps back to two days prior where Bruce Wayne wins a Man of the Year award over Luthor, when Joker and a few other Gotham City baddies crash the party. Batman and Robin round them up, but Luthor busts Joker out of jail to help him win his campaign for President. Luthor uses a special Kryptonite-powered device called the Deconstructor which works on black Lego products only, making most of Batman's gear inoperable. Joker-Luthor Incorporated leave a piece of fake Kryptonite for Batman to take back to the Batcave, and actually find the place! They trash all of the Bat-toys, steal all of his Kryptonite stash, and leave a big hole above the cave. The stupid part though is that they see that the Batcave is right next to Wayne Manor and for some reason don't figure out Batman's secret identity! Anyway, Superman shows up to help save the Dynamic Duo, and the World's Finest head to Luthor's place like at the beginning of the movie. The strange thing is that this reshot of the opening is sort of a ""director's cut"" with completely different material and lines added in, either that or the original opening was a Cliff Notes version. Joker and Luthor use a Kryptonite-powered Joker-Mecha to seemingly kill off the World's Finest, but it turns out Bats and Supes traded outfits(Captain Action would be proud). Luthor had Joker use his patented Joker Gas to spray a handful of Gothamites into voting for him, although Joker doublecrosses Luthor by making them want to make Joker the Prez instead, which isn't how the Joker Gas is supposed to work. The rest of the Justice League is called into to stop the Joker-Devastator, but not without wrecking a good part of the Wayne office building. For some reason, Martian Manhunter just stays up on the Watchtower eating cookies while the rest of the League put their lives on the line. After stopping Lex and Joker, Green Lantern for some reason shoots a blast of energy into the sky which gets the attention of Braniac several light years away, thus setting up the third video game.

This was a decent flick for kids, with some fair animation that ranks a little better than what Lego used in Ninjago and Legends Of Chima, although it could've used some better writing. This is a somewhat separate storyline than what was in The Lego Movie, but is connected to the Lego Batman: Be-Leaguered TV special that aired on Cartoon Network, although no word yet of its home video release. If you want to have something from DC to entertain the children to, this is worth a spin, although it could've totally stood to have Adam West make a cameo!",1421798400,,3275,4.723776223776224

5558902,5,B00B5AP7NY,"Amazing that this movie packs more story and entertainment in it's 1 hour/11min than in some the other live action superhero hero movies that run 2-3 hours. It's too bad that DC/Warner Bros don't let the same creators that do this/these LEGO movies produce their live-action movies. It doesn't make sense. The key here is that there is no need for exposition in which the creators are aware that the audience knows who these characters are and no need to give any back story and the characters are ""matter-of-fact"". So, when Superman & Batman (w/Robin) call the rest of the Justice Leaguers (Martian Manhunter, Wonder Woman, The Flash, Cyborg, & Green Lantern) for help against Lex Luthor and a The Joker's evil team-up, it goes straight for the action and adventure. This is how comic books used to be written. Now everything are long drawn-out multi-issue story-arc soap operas! The joy here (at least for this reviewer) is having Hal Jordan/Green Lantern in action with 'constructs' that were more imaginative than the ones in the Ryan Reynolds Green Lantern film. Currently, in DC Comics/New 52 comic-book continuity, Hal Jordan / Green Lantern is not on Justice League Roll Call and has an antagonistic relationship with Batman which has been beaten to death. Not in this movie. This is a what the future Justice League movie should be if only the suits at Warner's live-action film division would wake up! I hope [they] make more of these DC Comics LEGO movies because this one was so much fun (only bring in some of the other Roll Call JLAers)!!!!",1408320000,,1554,4.823970037453184

So, it's OK. It features a Robin who acts like a younger person than normally seen, but that provides some humor. It does make use of being a Lego film.

Perhaps, after watching both halves of the /Batman: The Dark Knight Returns/ on the same afternoon, my standards for these films has been elevated to an unreasonable level.",1404345600,,475,4.710843373493976

It was fun for an adult and older teen to watch, jokes for kids and adults to get. Because Batman and his world are meant to be dark, I'm not sure about adequacy for younger children.  I think Lego captured some of the darkness with the Joker character, so parents might want to gauge how their younger children will react.

The feature that is also included is a nice explanation of how the movie was made and uses kids to do some of the stop action work.  I would think it will inspire a whole new generation of film makers to come.  Perhaps even a whole lot more Lego amatuer films will show up on YouTube.",1402185600,2,742,4.23404255319149

The movie is a bit dark, but then again, it's Batman so that is to be expected. My 4 year old is a big fan of batman and all the other superheroes, so the combination of that plus Lego was ideal for him. He's getting a little more aware of what's ""scary"", so he wanted me to sit with him. It's perhaps a little violent for those who want to shield their kids from everything, so maybe check out a trailer or soomething if that's a concern.",1395705600,,693,4.0583941605839415

I fast forwarded the movie to see if it was going to play the right way but all the way to the end it was BLACK.  I had my grandson over for the afternoon and this was a movie he really wanted to watch.  Thank goodness, we had ROKU on another TV in the house and we finally got it to work after a while.

I know $2.99 isn't much, but I really hated to pay that and not be able to have him watch it on the big screen TV in our den.  If a movie isn't going to play correctly, then I think the money needs to be refunded or a credit given for another movie.

If you've played the game then you've seen the movie but it's nice to sit down and watch the show without having to play the missions. I wouldn't pay more than $10 for it unless you have to have all of the LEGO movies out there.,1388448000,,345,3.942857142857143

I was fully expecting nothing but a feature-length cut-scene but was surprised at how cinematic it actually is.

Opening with Danny Elfman's brilliant Batman theme (no offense to Zimmer but Warner knows that fans prefer this version), we learn that Lex Luthor and Joker have teamed up and have gained the upper hand over Bats and Supes. If only Bats had the humility to ask the rest of the Justice League for help. Skipping back a couple of days, the story of their dire situation unfolds. It's not an original framing device, but it was better than I was expecting.]

Director Jon Burton (no relation to Tim) uses many atmospheric locations that look wonderfully photo-realistic, while building as much of the world as possible with actual Lego bricks. Builders will get lots of ideas when watching this movie. Rob Westwood's score, while very entertaining, does get a little overbearing at times though. He should have let a couple of scenes speak for themselves, but it's still good enough to warrant a release on CD.

There is a fun sense of humor permeating each scene, meaning that if the vivid sets and cute action don't entertain you will still be smiling. It does suffer a little bit from the ""smashing skyscrapers"" clich that is common in many comic book movies but it's not too much of a distraction.

Far better than I expected. I will certainly invest time in a sequel.

The Blu-ray looks wonderful in 1.78:1 1080p with decent DTS HD-MA 5.1 sound. There are a good bunch of extras including some standard definition episodes of Batman: The Brave and the Bold and Teen Titans, and a short featurette.",1387929600,,2122,5.681388012618297
5559033,5,B00B5AP7NY,"Purchased this movie for my son's 3rd birthday and he LOVES it! He's watched it countless times already and continues to talk about it.

If you have ever played the Lego Batman game this movie is exactly the same as the game (only you are not playing of course).  They say the same things throughout the movie and go through the levels you would play in the game.  He didn't seem to mind it was the same or that he knew what was going to happen but for me it was a little repetitive as I play the game too so it wasn't so much of a movie for me.

5559046,5,B00B5AP7NY,Cute and my kids love it.  Who ever thought up the idea is laughing all the way to the bank.  I liked it too.,1383782400,,109,3.5
5559047,3,B00B5AP7NY,"This movie is for children, pure and simple.  It takes talent to create a movie for children that is also enjoyable for adults, and in my case the movie succeeds, but obviously your mileage may vary.
Lex Luthor wants to be President.  He figures his main obstacles will be Batman and Superman, so he breaks the Joker out of jail to help him defeat the two heroes.  The main focus is on Batman, with Superman as a supporting character.  In the final battle sequence, the whole (well, most of them) Justice League (Wonder Woman, the Flash, Green Lantern, and Cyborg [Martian Manhunter just does monitor duty]) joins in.  Other Batman villains the Penguin, Two Face, Catwoman, Bane, Poison Ivy, and Harley Quinn appear in brief cameos.

If you're a comic book geek, you might overthink this and say ""Luthor doesn't really need the Joker to help him,"" and as an adult, common sense would leave you wondering ""how would Luthor become President just by getting the votes of Gotham City?""  So don't overthink it and you'll be fine.  There's nothing much here that would go over the heads of a 10 year old, other than a possible reference to ""The Dark Knight Rises"" about 2/3 into the movie.

Batman's voice is provided by Troy Baker, who's provided the voice for numerous US animation and anime characters, including the second Greed from Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood.  The voice of the Joker is provided by Christopher Corey Smith, but my untrained ear thought it was Mark Hamill.  The voice actor for Superman/Clark Kent is Travis Willingham (Fullmetal Alchemist's Roy Mustang.)  Lex Luthor is by Clancy Brown (who provided Luthor's voice for the animated Superman series )

I don't think the film has anything parents need to worry about: there's no blood, no deaths, and Catwoman and Wonder Woman aren't particularly sexy because they're, ya know, Legos.  The film has the nicest, sweetest version of Superman I've ever seen on film, even nicer than Christopher Reeve, which makes it a little creepy that Batman has a stockpile of kryptonite ""just in case Superman goes bad,"" but that's about the most ""objectionable"" thing I can think of.

Rating is based primarily on age of the viewer:
4.8 stars for 5-9 year olds*
3.8 stars for 10-12 year olds*
3.4 stars for teenagers still capable of enjoying this kind of thing
1.8 stars for typical teenagers
2.9 stars for adults still capable of enjoying this kind of thing
1 star for typical adults
0 stars for people hate CGI.  (I don't believe the film contains any actual Legos.)
*Caveat: these ratings are only a guess and should be confirmed by actual children

I should have guessed it was just a straight rehash of the game - right down to using in-game cut scenes as the movie.

The characters have a real personality and the plot is a little bit meatier than one would expect from an animated movie with toys as the focus.

The minifigure that comes with this movie is a great addition to their LEGO collection. Since our car DVD doesn't play Blu Rays, we will keep the standard disk in the car for entertaining the kids and the Blu Ray version will be kept at home to watch on the tv. I can't add the digital movie to my iTunes collection, but the price for 2 disks is still good. The Amazon price went down a couple of days after it arrived, as prices sometimes fluctuate on Amazon.

A must have for the little super hero/Lego fan in your life.  There are a few words (""idiot"") that aren't the best choice for youngers but it creates a good learning opportunity as a parent to talk about appropriate language.

They took the animated parts from the game and made a movie out of it. Kind of like ringing the water out of that towel to get every last drop out of production cost if you ask me... I still give it a 5 star because it's funny and great for kids of all ages... (my age being 35.)",1373414400,,455,3.8

I found my self chuckling at some spots. A lot of inside-ish jokes for DC comic book fans. Pretty funny actually. Got me and my son started on watching other lego stuff. The Yoda Chronicles are pretty funny too.",1373328000,,385,4.216216216216216
5559156,5,B00B5AP7NY,"What an awesome little movie this was!  I wasn't even aware it existed until I stumbled upon it one day.  The LEGO animated characters and ""playsets"" are beautifully done, and the storyline is very entertaining, for both adults and children.  DC Comics may not do live action movies that well, but they put out some fantastic animated ones.

This movie brings some ""fun"" back into the DC Universe.  It reminds me of being a kid again. Fans of the original Super Friends cartoon series (and its many incarnations) will really enjoy this LEGO Batman movie.  Batman is serious and Robin is kid-like and sometimes clumsy.  Superman rushes in to save the day occasionally.  When he does, Robin is in awe; Batman less than thrilled that Superman is stealing his thunder.  Classic!  Although I wish there were even more DC characters that made appearances, we do get to see some of the main Justice Leaguers and numerous Batman villains (plus Lex Luthor).

Give me LEGO DC superhero movies any day over any current animated superhero shows.",1373241600,,1033,4.845714285714286

As a longtime DC fan, you can't help getting into the storyline and cute characters in the film which some reviewers have said is just bonus content from the game, which is no concern to me. The voice acting and script are sufficient for both kids and adults. I enjoyed Batman and Robin's interactions. Superman was funny too. An even greater part was the discovery of the included three bonus cartoons ""Triumvirate of Terror"" and ""Scorn of the Star Sapphires""(from Batman:The Brave & the Bold and starring the Justice League and Green Lantern respectively) and ""Overdrive"" (from Teen Titans).

Anyway, 5 minutes into this movie the complaints stopped because we were dying laughing. This is a great movie for kids, but even adults can enjoy it. The creators even stayed true to the comic book canon.

It's time for the Man of the Year Awards in Gotham City. The contenders? Bruce Wayne and Lex Luthor. The winner? Well, you guessed it: Bruce Wayne. When the Joker crashes the party, Lex sees a potential ally in his fight against not only Superman, but all superheroes. They forge an uneasy alliance and Lex uses Joker's expertise in chemistry to create not only a gas that would make everyone vote for him in the upcoming Presidential election, but also Kryptonite. In exchange, Lex would provide Joker with a special brick dismantling device that is able to take apart shiny black objects, something Joker's all too familiar with thanks to the Dark Knight.

Meanwhile, Batman and Robin have their hands full with an outbreak from Arkham Asylum. Superman shows up to help and eventually the Dynamic Duo and the Man of Steel discover Lex's and Joker's partnership. However, team ups aren't Batman's strong suit but after a little coaxing from Robin, he learns that sometimes you need outside help to come to victory.

Just when Batman and Superman think they've got Joker and Lex right where they want them, the sinister duo unleash a powerful force that will take the entire Justice League of America to stop.

If you've played LEGO Batman 2, then you're familiar with this story. This movie even uses clips from the game, but then fills in the gaps with fresh animation. So while it's kind of a rehash, it's a well-done rehash and, hey, it's LEGO. LEGO animated movies are few and far between and I hope LEGO Batman: The Movie - DC Superheroes Unite is the first in a move to bring more and more brick superheroes to the small screen. Perhaps even to the big one one day.

The animation is crisp, flawless, and well-thought out. The graphics are amazing and convey a plausible world made of LEGO, every detail somehow made from LEGO bricks. No small feat from a design standpoint, creating something to believable yet so . . . LEGO-y.

With a solid story filled with the right amount of action and humor, I'm glad I added LEGO Batman: The Movie to my superhero movie collection. Besides, the exclusive Clark-Kent-changing-into-Superman LEGO figure that comes with it is not too shabby either. Glad to have him as part of my Superman figure collection.

LEGO Batman: The Movie - DC Superheroes Unite is recommended for all ages. I loved watching it with my kids and I know you will, too. And if you don't have kids, then it's still worth checking out. Again, LEGO? Batman? Superman? DC superheroes? Yes, please!",1370995200,3,2525,4.712018140589569
5559199,4,B00B5AP7NY,My 4 year old loved this movie because it followed along the lines of his video game!!!  Would watch over and over.,1370995200,,115,4.2272727272727275
5559200,5,B00B5AP7NY,"My 4 year old son and I love the games and now we love this movie!

Getting it in HD was definitely a major plus.",1370908800,,113,3.52
5559201,4,B00B5AP7NY,"If you have played the Lego Batman 2 game, the plot of this movie will be very familiar to you.  In fact, its almost as if Traveler's Tales figured they could throw a game together on the cheap by re-using the cut scenes from the video game.  Although its not a complete clone of the game, some scenes are re-edited and re-cut so they aren't exact, but they are close enough.

If you are over the age of 12, then there isn't a ton of stuff in this movie to interest you.  There are some references to past Batman movie and TV incarnations and the recreation of the 1989 Tim Burton Batman movie opening from LEGO bricks is a classic.  My kids watch the scene and yell out ""The bat-symbol!"" every time they watch it.  There is also a scene where Superman hears the Richard Donner Superman film's theme and says ""That music sounds familiar.""  To which Batman replies ""I don't listen to music.""  I just about fell over when I found out that my kids don't instantly equate that tune with Superman!  (a travesty that I will have to straighten out!""

The attention to detail is something else that is impressive in this movie.  The recreation of the models out of LEGO bricks would be impressive enough.  But you can actually see where the minifigure's joints rub together creating scratches on the body.  Also, if the light hits them just right, you can see fingerprints on the minifigs that must be left over from whoever built this LEGO Gotham City and is imagining the story.

Its easy to imagine that this story was thought up by some 10 year old.  Its not too deep, full of silly humor, and the majority of the violence is off-screen.  This movie really is geared toward the younger audience and there is not anything in it that I would not feel comfortable letting my kids watch.  The message of teamwork runs throughout the movie and even Batman learns that its OK to ask for help when he calls in the rest of the Justice League in to help the threat posed by Lex Luthor and the Joker.

The movie is called DC Superheroes unite, but it could have easily been called the Batman/Superman hour.  About 90% of the movie focuses on those two heroes while The Flash, Wonder Woman, Martian Manhunter, Green Lantern, and Cyborg get a quick guest appearance in the final moments of he movie.  So if you are stoked for the TV screen debut of the Flash don't blink because it will be over in a flash!

My kids (a 6 year old son and a 7 year old daughter) have watched this movie at least 5 times in the week that we have owned this movie.  They love LEGO and they love Superheroes so this movie is a good fit for them.  The fun doesn't stop with the feature though.  There are 5 stop motion shorts made out of LEGO that were part of an online contest, 3 episodes of WB superhero cartoons (Teen Titans, Batman: The Brave and the Bold, and Justice League), and a featurette on building LEGO Batman.  My kids have to watch all of the special features each time they watch the movie and have discovered Batman: The Brave and the Bold because of this.

Lastly, the movie comes with an exclusive Clark Kent turning into Superman LEGO minifigure.  Its a really neat piece that LEGO probably won't release anywhere else (though I wouldn't put money on that) so if you are a minifig completeist, you need to get the movie.  I can tell you that this LEGO Clark Kent has watched this movie a few times along with his pal LEGO Superman.  At least on the days my son can figure out where he left them.",1370908800,27,3478,4.373831775700935

Since the video game didn't have a replay theater option like in Lego PoTC game, I got the dvd to watch all those funny scenes in their entirety.

5559226,4,B00B5AP7NY,"Not content to just be plain old building blocks, the LEGO brand has grabbed up licenses to create products based on everything from ""Star Wars"" to ""Harry Potter"" and competitors Marvel and DC Entertainment. What was once just a toy has transformed into an animated phenomenon that simultaneously lampoons and pays homage to the biggest franchises in pop culture.

There have already been a couple LEGO ""Star Wars"" movies and a new TV show entitled ""LEGO Star Wars: The Yoda Chronicles."" Anyone who casually keeps up with the world of children's programming and toys knew it would only be a matter of time before the super hero industry got in on the LEGO animated action. DC Entertainment beat Marvel to the punch with ""LEGO Batman: The Movie - Super Heroes Unite.""

In a plot to get himself elected president, Lex Luthor joins forces with the Joker to build a Black LEGO Destructor Ray and incite fear in the citizens of Gotham City and beyond. Batman reluctantly teams up with Superman to take on the destructive duo.

Things get even more complicated when Two-Face, Harley Quinn, the Penguin, Catwoman, the Riddler, and Poison Ivy join the fight. Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, and the rest of the Justice League storm into town to help the Dark Knight and the Man of Steel battle the super villains and stop their devious plan.

""LEGO Batman: The Movie - Super Heroes Unite"" is the sort of self-referential entertainment that reaches out to both children and their parents. I can't necessarily say it's easy to sit through seventy minutes of this type of humor. However, it still provides some light chuckles and a few smiles. It doesn't take a brain surgeon to figure out this is targeted at kids.

The high-definition audio and video transfer for ""LEGO Batman: The Movie - Super Heroes Unite"" will keep your child's attention. There are plenty of stimulating explosions and other exciting noises circulating through the 5.1 surround sound mix. Just like the comic books, the vibrant and contrasting colors will have their eyes glued to the screen.

There are a few extra features which kids will enjoy. Their parents might find the bonus material more intriguing than the movie itself. ""Building Batman"" is a fifteen minute featurette consisting of DCU Lego Video Contest Grand Prize winner Garrett Barati taking us on a tour of his LEGO studio. He also provides a behind-the-scenes glimpse at the making of his Batman short film.

We also get to see the top five contestants in ""Winning Shorts: DCU Video Contest."" ""LEGO Batman Jumps Into Action"" is a promotional clip with some stop motion thrown in. Lastly, we get nearly seventy minutes of episodes from ""Batman: The Brave and the Bold"" and ""Teen Titans"" dragged out ""From the DC Comics Vault.""

You'll find ""LEGO Batman: The Movie - Super Heroes Unite"" will get a lot of repeat viewing from your children. Just like the LEGO ""Star Wars"" ones, my sons never seem to get enough of it. I highly recommend this for anyone looking for a kid-friendly super hero gift that won't just get tossed to the side after one watch.",1369872000,,3076,4.823529411764706

Animation, music, sound, and voices were really good. Vehicles and character themes were straight out of their Lego sets. Movie is good for all ages young and old. The only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is that pretty much most the movie is based from the cut scenes from the Lego Batman 2 video game. I've already beat the game so I feel like I've seen most of the movie. They just remastered/remixed and extended the cut scenes. I wish it was straight from scratch. The early reviews here were mixed so I wasn't sure so I bought it anyways. You can watch video game cut scenes on youtube for free although it's not exactly the same as watching this movie. It comes with an exclusive Clark Kent Lego mini figure which you can't get in any Lego Set.",1369353600,,931,4.4186046511627906
5559246,5,B00B5AP7NY,"I'm not sure where to begin -- the animation is EXCELLENT! This isn't just a ""bunch of cut scenes from the video game"" and most/all of the animation is completely ORIGINAL to this movie. FABULOUS STUFF!!!
The humor is just great -- very well-written dialogue that kept my kids & I giggling. My wife even bellowed out a huge laugh at a couple scenes, and she's generally not much into ""comic book-y stuff"", as she calls it. This is terrific, and worth every penny. Bought one for a friend's son, too. He's gonna love it!

As for the negative reviewers, I have only this to say to you: ""You clearly HAVE NOT seen this movie if that's your view. It is FULL of ORIGINAL scenes, dialogue, and story that DIFFERS from the game while maintaining the same general plot. The animation is PHENOMENAL, and I know you'll come back and tell me how you've seen it, blah-blah-blah, but I have been playing the game with my son, and just finished watching this with my entire family, and can say without a doubt that it is NOT 'just made up of a bunch of cut scenes from the video game'. NEXT!""

5559247,1,B00B5AP7NY,"This film is a good film IF you haven't played the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/LEGO-Batman-2-Super-Heroes-PS3/dp/B00BUSNS0U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">LEGO Batman 2 Super Heroes PS3</a>&nbsp;video game. Of course, I am speaking about this from the perspective of an adult. I'm sure younger viewers will enjoy it. The film is comprised of the cut-scenes from the video game edited together with some new footage so it becomes a coherent story. But that's my take on it, it is a rehashing of video game footage. This is far different than past Lego films we've seen such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Wars-Lego-The-Padawan-Menace-Blu-ray/dp/B006JIL20Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Wars Lego: The Padawan Menace [Blu-ray</a>] or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/LEGO-Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Out-Exclusive-Minifigure-DARTH-VADER-with-Medal/dp/B00AXFK96M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">LEGO Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Out (Exclusive Minifigure DARTH VADER with Medal)</a>. These films were entirely new footage and a new plot-line not associated with the video games. I, as an adult, would much rather have seen a brand new storyline and not a collection of cut-scenes from the video game.

The release comes with a Clark Kent Lego Minifigure that, I think, shows how little effort they put into the movie. With ""The Padawan Menace"" we got a figure of Ian, the protagonist of the story. With ""Empire Strikes Out"" we got a Darth Vader with medal as seen in the film. This time we get a Clark Kent with exposed Superman S. Correct me if I'm wrong, but shouldn't a Batman film have at least a Batman character? I know, I know Clark/Superman is in the film quite a bit, but it's Lego Batman! At least they put out a figure not available with any set.

Some commenters in response to my original review said the film did not deserve a 1 star, because it entertained kids and featured new material. I'm sure this is true. However, when comparing it with the previous releases we got robbed. A conservative estimate is that 60-70% of the film is game footage, that means we're only paying for 30-40% of a new, unseen special. It does feature several references to other Batman works such as Tim Burton's title sequence from the 1989 Batman film, which was not used in the game. But the majority of the references, again, were used in game.

It might provide some laughs, but I don't think it's worth the money, effort, or time IF you've played the game and if you are familiar with the previous Lego movies.",1369180800,7,2644,5.7055837563451774
5559248,5,B00B5AP7NY,"My family has enjoyed the previous Lego movie releases for Star Wars, but considering the superhero obsession in our household I had to pick this film up.  The movie itself runs 71 minutes, almost a feature length which is quite a bit more than we've gotten with the previous Star Wars specials.  The movie begins with Batman and Superman taking on Lex Luthor and flashes back to the ""Man of the Year"" award ceremony which quickly gets out of control when the Joker leads a group of villains (including the Penquin, Harley Quinn, Riddler, Two-Face and Catwoman) to crash the party.  And what better way to stop a villain team up then by getting together a few ""super"" friends like Superman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, Cyborg and The Flash.  There are plenty of other characters that show up along the way as well.

While this film utilizes the spirit of the cut-scenes from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/LEGO-Batman-2-DC-Super-Heroes/dp/B006ZPAYGE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">LEGO Batman 2: DC Super Heroes</a>, it is not a straight repackage of them.  Many scenes have been added and the others reanimated and re-cut and improved upon for the release, all for the better.  If you've played the game, you get the gist, but this is a much higher quality of animation and gives you the story in a much more cinematic way.

The film itself is fun for all ages, with enough Lego humor for the kids and plenty of jokes that will probably be over their heads including references to the Batman films going all the way back to the 1960s.  Kudos to the design team for their parody of the original 1989 Batman film opening, as well as the use of that iconic Danny Elfman music and the John Williams Superman score. The voice work is solid and though I prefer the voice cast of Arkham Asylum, this group of actors does a wonderful job portraying these characters in a more kid friendly way.

The bonus features are great as well and include a short feature called ""Building Batman"" behinds the scenes in the Lego animation studio with a few kids getting to work with the resident animator, 2 episodes of The Brave and the Bold and one from Teen Titans, a Lego Batman stop-motion short, and 5 winning shorts from the Lego DC Universe Super Heroes Video Contest.  There are various languages options but unfortunately no commentary which I would have loved to hear from the director or lead animator about the production.  The pack-in of Clark Kent with the ""S"" exposed is a nice add on for Lego collectors as well.

Ultimately this is a great release.  It's a fun film for all ages and a worth a look.",1369180800,76,2637,4.831111111111111
5559249,5,B00B5AP7NY,"At first I thought this movie would be kind of like ""The Avengers."" The movie turns out to be very different! All the Marvel superheroes and everything else are made out of Legos. It is more focused on Batman as a man and other heroes like Robin, Super Women, Super Man, the Green Lantern and many others.

This move has a mix of comedy which I've noticed is in every Lego movie. It has action, adventure, great actors and even a lifelong lesson - sometimes you can't do things all by yourself, you need help. There are some pretty cool structures and machines. All these structures are built out of Lego bricks so you can really build them yourself if you knew how!

The adventure begins when Bruce Wayne wins the ""Man of the Year"" award. If you don't know who Bruce Wayne is, he is Batman undercover. Then, the Joker commits a crime and Batman and Robin have to capture him once again. As they are trying to achieve their goal, Superman helps him. Batman gets annoyed with Superman but, at the end they work together and call in all the superheroes to defeat the Joker! If you want to know what happens at the end you must watch the movie.

What I love about this funny, action-packed film is how it shows the relationship between Robin and Batman as somewhat difficult. This isn't very good for a side-kick and a hero. At the end though, they become good friends. Also, it shows all the heros' powers like Superman's strength and Batman's throwing skills. The best part for me is how everything is made out of Legos. And, as in most Lego movies, there are cool animations, good actions and great voiceover actors.

My favorite scene is when the bat cave gets destroyed. It's action packed and shows Joker's ""funny"" side with his strange humor and his pie bombs. Superman helps them. But, the Joker and his partner Lex, who is running for president and using Joker to win election, gets away. Would you like to know how he was able to defeat Superman's power? Get a copy of this wonderful film and find out!

I recommend this film for ages 3 and up. There's really no violence or harsh language in this movie. ""Lego Batman the Movie"" is extremely kid-friendly. I give this movie 5 out 5 stars. You can find it on DVD everywhere now.
