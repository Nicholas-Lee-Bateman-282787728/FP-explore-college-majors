I love these and my 3 year old loves these more. They feature 3 very life like puppets in a ""natural setting"" as uncle balzac (a chamelion) teaches 2 young animals who about different animals of the world. With beautiful national geographic footage of animals in nature (no animals in zoo's here) they cover different aspects of animals. With fun sing-alongs, funny puppets, and beautiful animals your child will be learning what a ""mammal"" or ""nocturnal"" is, which animals can fly, how animals find their food, different habbitats and more. In this particular video the young animals learn about animals that ive in holes-who/what/why/where/how's are all covered. They also dip into fun facts about cats and animals at the watering hole.",1137628800,2,974,5.012345679012346
