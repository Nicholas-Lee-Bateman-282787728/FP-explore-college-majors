7908051,5,B00000F4ZW,"A fantastic and harrowing film exploring the oppression of women in West Germany in the early '80s. Directed by Austrian video artist Valie Export, the film concerns itself with four women- the wife and three mistresses of Franz, a journalist. Each is introduced through an imaginative dream sequence that allows the film examine the frayed, destructive relationships of its characters beyond the confines of strict New Wave realism. Though the story is still deeply grounded in gritty drama and remarkably fraught performances from all of its actors. The situation becomes more frayed when two of the women become pregnant and Franz, shirking any responsibility, encourages them to terminate their pregnancies.
Though short on solutions for its tormented characters, MENSCHENFRAUEN does suggest that some semblance of hope may be found in facing hardships together, rather than facing an indifferent world alone. Those interested in German New Wave, Feminism, and the roots of American independent cinema of the 1990's would do well to see this film.",1291939200,4,1051,5.414634146341464
7908052,4,B00000F4ZW,"(from the back of the Facets Video box): ""Valie Export's daring film about relationships, MENSCHENFRAUEN (loosely translated, 'humanwomen'), focuses on Franz S., a journalist, and his relationship with four women: the kindergarten nurse Petra, the teacher Gertrude, barmaid Elisabeth, and his wife Anna. Franz 'doles out honorary pieces of himself to the ""human women"" in his seraglio, whispers the same assurances. Eventually, everyone catches on and makes some effort toward independence' (Gary Indiana, East Village Eye). 'A landmark film...Valie Export achieves in MENSCHENFRAUEN what Godard strove for but failed in his Every Man for Himself - a human view of a woman's place in a man's world...From credits to close, MENSCHENFRAUEN eludes conventional cinematic vision...Valie Export shows the talent rare among makers of film: the ability to think cinematically' (Seattle Film Festival)",1170028800,,893,5.7727272727272725
