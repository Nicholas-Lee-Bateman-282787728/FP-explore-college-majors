Great show, but they should have kept the packaging the same as seasons 1-3.
I hope when season 5 becomes available they go back to the packaging from before.",1381276800,25,273,4.074074074074074
4492639,4,B004X83UHA,"I was very disappointed when I received my set from time life the only episode problem was the soundtrack to the return bigfoot part 2 was badly muffled, I just saw the syndicated version running currently on that new channel and the soundtrack was perfect other than being horribly edited why can't universal fix this track. Obviously there is a episode out there with a decent soundtrack. Poor music of Joe Harnell created just for this episode is not the way it was broadcast the first time you can't even hear the tinkle bells used in so many b/w episodes,even a sci fi channel version has a perfect soundtrack once again just heavily edited not only that Jaimie's jumping noised are badly muffled too what a shame this was an exceptional episode and my favorite. I doubt they will fix it. UPDATE: OTHER THAN THE LOUSY PACKAGING THE SOUNDTRACK WAS DEFINITELY IMPROVED THAN TIME LIFES VERSION.",1379376000,,896,4.75
4492640,5,B004X83UHA,"I have the complete Six Million Dollar Man set from Time Life. I got it for $140. Worth every penny. The season 4 from the Time Life set has a Bonus Disc that will NOT be included on this release. Why it is not included is beyond me.

Here is what you are missing compared to the Time Life Release:

--Full-color booklet with a message from Lee Majors, an essay from D.C.-based writer Brendan Slattery, photos, and a listing of episodes, credits and bonus features

--The Six Million Dollar Fans featurette
--Season 4 VIPS: A Celebration of ""The Six Million Dollar Man"" Guest Stars
--OSI Mission Debriefing: Actor Richard Anderson (Oscar Goldman)

The Richard Anderson Interview is fantastic. If you buy this release you will not get it...

As far as Season 4 goes, its TOP NOTCH! Even if Lee Majors does have the Famous moustache...

You get the 2 part ""Return of BigFoot"" and the 3 part ""Kill Oscar""! Top Notch stuff for sure..

Really sad that you will not get the bonus disc with this set. I would assume that Season 5 will not contain the bonus disc either..",1378339200,3,1063,4.534031413612565
4492641,5,B004X83UHA,"The Six Million Dollar Man is a great Fun TV show. And well worth getting on DVD. This was when TV was worth watching..
I hope they put SDH/Closed Caption on it as they did on seasons 1-3.. Looking to get season Four.
They don't make great fun TV shows like this any more......
Its great to go back and watch it over and over.
The Six Million Dollar Man can put 95% of trash what is on TV today. To shame.",1377302400,7,405,3.951219512195122

4492643,5,B004X83UHA,"I have consistently buying each season of The Six Million Dollar Man as I can afford it over most of the last year or so. I now have only one season to go. The most recent being season 4. Season 4 is one with a lot of different episodes that I still remember watching as a kid. It still contains heat stopping, on the edge of your seat suspense that only Col. Steve Austin (Lee Majors) can deliver. So for bringing back some much loved childhood memories and making me ecstatically happy again, I rate this season a whopping 5 stars! Thank you for making these shows available again.

Sincerely,

Robert Cockerham",1361577600,,613,4.464285714285714

4492645,4,B004X83UHA,"This 1976-77 Season of THE SIX MILLION DOLLAR MAN was probably its best season and ran on ABC for 4 years along with the fact that this show was based on a novel Cyborg by Martin Caiden regarding a former astronaut Col. Steve Austin(Lee Majors)who nearly dies after being severly injured on a mission who gets saved by Agent Oscar Goldman(Richard Anderson)from the Office of Scientific Intelligence and gets rebuilt by Dr. Rudy Welles(Martin E. Brooks)with surgical bionic implants similar to his love-interest Jamie Sommars(Lindsey Wagner)on its spin-off series THE BIONIC WOMAN which debuted on ABC in January of 1976.

As a result of Steve's bionic powers, Steve had a bionic infrared left-eye just like Jamie had an amplifying bionic right-ear and Jamie and Steve would occasionally team up together in crossover episodes between THE SIX MILLION DOLLAR MAN and THE BIONIC WOMAN.

Lee Majors had also opened the minds and hearts of audiences across the world to an era when we were starving for super-heros especially when we had a knack for being able to help mediate problems to a point where the only resolution was by the hand since THE SIX MILLION DOLLAR MAN introduced a new concept to our world of robots and cyborgs in order to enhance his ability to combat everything that was evil since Steve inspired us with hope along with the fact that the premiere of THE BIONIC WOMAN was inspired by THE SIX MILLION DOLLAR MAN as well.

Unfortunately THE SIX MILLION DOLLAR MAN had cancelled in the Spring of 1978 just before THE BIONIC WOMAN was, due to a big nose-dive in ratings when creator(Ken Johnson)brought THE INCREDIBLE HULK to CBS in March of 1978 and was an even bigger smash and even bigger success than THE SIX MILLION DOLLAR MAN and THE BIONIC WOMAN were too.

It was also interesting seeing guest stars in this season like
*Sports celebrity Frank Gifford doing a cameo in ""The Bionic Boy"" episode

*Stephanie Powers in ""The Return of Bigfoot"" episode before her co-starring days on the detective drama HART TO HART

*Joan Van Ark in ""The Bionic Boy"" episode before her co-starring days on KNOTT'S LANDING & THE YOUNG & THE RESTLESS

*Farrah Fawcett in the ""Nightmare in the Sky"" episode during her co-starring days on CHARLIE'S ANGELS

*Charles Cyphers known for his role as the safety-cautious, but skeptical Sheriff Brackett in John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN

*Jack Ging in the crossover episode ""Kill Oscar"" before his co-starring days as the hard-nosed Army nemeis(Gen. Fulbright)on THE A-TEAM

*Dana Elcar in the ""Nightmare in the Sky"" episode before his co-starring days on MACGYVER

*Comedian Flip Wilson in the ""Double Trouble"" episode

*Greg Evigan in ""The Bionic Boy"" episode before his co-starring days as B.J. McKay on BJ and THE BEAR

*John Houseman in the crossover episode ""Kill Oscar"" before his co-starring days as Edward Stratton II on SILVER SPOONS

*Ray Walston in the ""A Bionic X-Mas Carol"" episode after his co-starring days on MY FAVORITE MARTIAN

*Bernie Kopell in the ""Vulture of the Andes"" episode before his co-starring days on THE LOVE BOAT

*Dick Sargent in the ""A Bionic Christmas Carol"" episode after his co-starring days as Darren Stephens on BEWITCHED

4492652,5,B004X83UHA,"This TV series is a favorite for decades for science fiction and spy warfare fans of all ages. Lee Majors stars as Steve Austin(not the pro wrestler) who was nearly killed in an aircraft accident. The U.S. government likes his military skills and pays for the surgery to replace his permanently injured limbs and eye(not both) with bionic technology that exceeds all human capability. Now he has super speed(60 mph running), super strength,(app. 1 ton lifting), super punching and kicking power, and super leaping height(dozens of vertical feet). Telescopic vision is another honorable mention. In this season Steve teams with his girlfriend Jaime Summers(Lindsay Wagner) who is also bionic to defeat a group of super robots with similar abilities. Other favorites are when Steve must fight the Death Probe, a military tank like vehicle designed for space travel with armor that Knight Rider would be proud of! My personal favorite, included in this collection, are the Bigfoot episodes. Steve meets an opponent even he is not stronger or faster than. His fights with Bigfoot, often played by the late Andre the Giant of pro wrestling fame, are science fiction legend. If you like X-Men or other ""superhero"" style action with a slight James Bond twist, this is an all time favorite amongst fans of the genre. Enjoy!",1491955200,,1315,5.064516129032258

This is the 'mustache' season, I think it was Lee Majors weird way of protesting the show at the time, he ended up shaving it off near the end on the last episode and there was never any mention of it at all. I think they were getting tired of doing the show by this time, although, this is the ""Fembot"" and Ted Cassidy Sasquatch season and that alone makes this one worth watching!

A nice feature that seemed to go out of fashion in the 1980s only to be revived in the late 1990s.

they were awesome. One of my favorite episodes were A Bionic Christmas Carol.

4492714,5,B004X83UHA,"The best of the episodes in this set are the Bigfoot ones. What I like about these collections other than the terrible packaging....the discs are all on one spindle....that there are so many good guest stars. Elkie Summer, Vince Van Patten and Bigfoot portrayed by Ted Cassidy (Lurch on Adams Family)...there is good roster of fantastic guest stars.  You can't go wrong with a set like this because the guest stars are properly utilized and aren't just walk on roles for stunt casting purposes.

If you like Six Million Dollar Man, you are in for a treat because this set has crossover episodes from the Bionic Woman too.  The shows crossed over for episode arcs and it makes the set complete when the stories are presented uncut without having to purchase the Bionic Woman DVD's.

If you don't want to pay the 300 plus dollars for the Time Life version of this set of DVD's, getting them at this price is much more economical.  I have been purchasing the sets separately on Amazon and it's much cheaper. Now if only they would have US versions of the Bionic TV movies, I'd actually have a complete set.  Anyway, be prepared to get DVD holders for this set.  The spindle they are packaged in isn't the best and will not last over time. I'm surprised that the manufacturer hasn't changed it by now.

One, the packaging (see other reviews which tell it all just fine, and they are accurate!) and the fact that these eps were clearly taken from videotape masters and NOT original film elements. These days that's unacceptable. You can see the evidence of this by noticing the rainbow-like artifacting on almost every scene in some spots. The eps are watchable and are better than VHS copies, but NOT up to the standard of modern DVD mastering. Very disappointing in that respect.

""The Return of Big Foot"" sees the Bionic Woman helping out Steve and Big Foot well its cheesy but he gets more acting time.

4492776,4,B004X83UHA,"I have wistful nostalgia for the 6MDM and my childhood: I was allowed to watch syndicated reruns of 6MDM if I was well behaved and this privilege was revoked on occasion.  To lose both 6MDM and ""The Incredible Hulk"" watching privileges meant I was a particularly awful child.

As a grown man, I revisited the series and was surprised at how well the program was done, given the budget, production, and technology limitations of 1970's television.  By season four, The Six Million Dollar Man had hit its stride and the crossover Bionic Woman story arcs were well written.  All the familiar hallmarks were there: Sasquatch, Fembots, the Venus Death Probe.  I've now watched the first four seasons.  I shudder to think how the fifth season went, most likely with budget cuts and ""The Fred Silverman touch"" that afflicted many NBC series and drove away writing talent.

Highs:  Venus Death Probe

The show was great and I loved it very much and glad it is now on DVD finally. I also grew up watching it and it was great with both the crossover episodes and the two partners and the movie length episodes and you could tell that they didn't like the moustache cause it was very noticeable in the first part of the season then towards the middle the end of the season it started to get smaller then at the end of season it was totally off.

Fire the person responsible for that decision! 0 stars for the packaging,1382054400,18,396,4.438356164383562
4492802,5,B004X83UHA,I have all season 1 to season 3 of the six million dollar man.  So last week I went on amazon.com and bought season 4.  I just finished watching disc 1 to 3 and there are a lot of interested cases and couple is espoise cross over of bionic woman.  I really enjoyed Steve Austin and Jamie summer's cross over ospoise. They really made good couple in the movie.,1381795200,,359,4.173913043478261
4492803,2,B004X83UHA,"Who ever thought it would be smart to go from single disc packaging to a stack of discs on a spindle must have been on drugs. How am I supposed to play anything other than the first two discs over a span of, say, a few weeks? Just toss the ones I watched, bare on a table?  Or am I supposed to remove the entire stack of discs after I complete each disc and put it on the bottom?

Cheap, very very cheap.

5 stars for the show, deduct 3 for the worst packaging I've ever seen.",1381708800,6,476,3.88659793814433
4492804,3,B004X83UHA,"Season 1 of 6 million dollar man has a bonus disc, take that out, add season 2 disc 1. Then, at the end of season 2, add disc one of season 3, and at the end of season 3 add disc 1 of season 4, then season 4... Buy Dr. Quinn Medicine woman, season 2, 7 discs, not stacked, place the remaining 6 million dollar man season 4 discs 2-8, in dr quinn's set.

What I did was put cheaper priced $15 at Target.  Dr Quinn discs in 6 slim cases and the seventh disc in the stacked 6 million dollar man season 4's case, with Dr Quinn DVD art Sleeve and will give them to my sister for Christmas.  She throws away boxes and puts them in DVD books...

So now every episode is protected in 4 six million dollar man sets.  The bonus disc to season 1 sucks, it has mainly one man talking... It will go in a slim case.  I hope this review is plain and simple and helps... From what I hear, Season 5 will not be in a hard to replace box set and will be 6 discs which is easier to find.",1381276800,2,967,3.8341708542713566
4492805,1,B004X83UHA,"How cheap can they get?  When I first opened the box, a DVD dropped out.  Thankfully I caught it so no damage was done.  I figured it just came loose from its spot.  No, I then found that the discs are stacked on top of each other.  For all of the DVDs I have purchased through the years, I have never seen a commercially produced television season packaged as such.  All I can say is that I'm glad I don't store DVDs with the case; I remove them and store my collection in individually marked sleeves, so I can save space.",1381276800,28,523,4.128712871287129

8446429,2,B004X83UHA,I loved this show as a kid in the 70s. This season has The Sasquatch episodes which have stuck with me. Sadly after watching I realized these were not well made or acted. The noise we all loved when Steve used his powers became annoying after the third episode. This show has simply not stood the test of time as shows like Star Trek have. Lee Majors was a handsome actor and its easy to see why we tuned in back in those days to watch this show. But Im no longer interested in these outdated and poor quality shows.,1526083200,,516,4.17
