5665148,5,B00BQ1D7WK,"Once again typical Andrae Rieu

After so many DVD'S it is hard to find/get something  different but nevertheless I enjoyed this DVD

Particularly liked the rendition of Amazing Grace

5665149,5,B00BQ1D7WK,"Excellent, lively concert! Very enjoyable with many favorite songs performed. Andre was super with the crowd.",1466467200,,109,5.875
5665150,5,B00BQ1D7WK,What is there not to love about his music.  Just can't hear and see enough of him.,1466294400,,82,3.823529411764706
5665151,4,B00BQ1D7WK,Great  as usual but too much audience.  I prefer to see more of Andre and his fantastic audience.,1464393600,,97,4.333333333333333
5665152,5,B00BQ1D7WK,"If someone still wonder why Andre Rieu is so popular around the globe, He should watch (and ear) this hilarious DVD. The answer He will reach will be very simple: the Dutch maestro has found the secret to his audience heart! I know its sound too simple, yet many artists are still chasing that hidden treasure - in vain.
Rieu with his well trained orchestra and carefully selected soloists, capture the hearts of a huge Brazilian crowd in Sau Paulo. The enthusiastic Brazilians refuse to let him leave the stage, despite a half dozen anchors.
The well-planned program  - giving so much justified place to the rich Brazilian music - will warm your hearts, especially with that excellent sound of the DVD.
No wonder so many inter-cuts, reveal us pictures of people in tears. How could You stay indifferent listening to ""Little Captain of my Heart"", performed by the unique Manoe Koning with her magic bag-pipes?
And last but not least: Try to think of a another place with so many beautiful girls in the crowd... well. thats not exactly music, but just a lovely bonus.",1463616000,,1066,4.731182795698925

5665173,5,B00BQ1D7WK,On the holiday weekend we had family over. We watched 5 of Andre's DVD's. On Sunday evening we watched two and on Monday we watched three more. All different and all entertaining.,1402099200,,179,4.625
5665174,2,B00BQ1D7WK,I bought this DVD to watch and listen to Andre Rieu and the Johann Strauss Orchestra. I was extremely disappointed that there were so so many photos of the audience. In fact there were probably more photos of the audience than of Andrei's Orchestra. I have several of Andrei's DVD's and I was very sorry that I spent the money on this one. I would NOT recommend this DVD to anyone unless you want to look in the audience and see what they are doing.,1398729600,,449,4.294117647058823
5665175,5,B00BQ1D7WK,"I received my Blu-Ray this afternoon.  ..It was great, great and more GREAT The  the picture quality  and sound were great  The only problem was that is was too short, only 90 minutes long.  There were old numbers and some new ones.  The Platin Singers, Carla and Carmen were wonderful as always .  All in all it was a very good video",1398643200,,334,4.290322580645161
5665176,4,B00BQ1D7WK,Little less than hoped for but very good. The group is still very entertaining even though they are getting in years.,1394409600,,117,4.619047619047619
5665177,4,B00BQ1D7WK,"Andre Rieu presented his usual stellar concert in Brazil, but some of the classical selections seemed stiff for the setting.  The Brazilian audience was very responsive to the music, especially the Samba-esque songs ""Manha de Carnival"" (featuring two Brazilian sopranos -- a huge hit with the audience) and ""Brasil Medley"".  And the audience especially responded to Andre's thoughtful inclusion of the current national favorite: ""Ai Seu Te Pego"".  Still, it would have been nice to see even more songs with Latin roots included in this concert.",1394409600,,544,5.3023255813953485
