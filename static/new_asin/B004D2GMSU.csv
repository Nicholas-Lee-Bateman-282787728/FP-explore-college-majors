4331209,5,B004D2GMSU,Easier to buy these then collect off cable. Getting them in order helps the series make more sense. Looking forward to getting the rest.,1355788800,,136,4.708333333333333
4331210,5,B004D2GMSU,"Ash and company continue their adventures in the Sinnoh region in the third season of the Pokemon DP series, with the first fifteen episodes collected in this box set. Things start off on a fun note with the amusing episode ""Get Your Rotom Running"", with the cast being spooked by a mischievious Pokemon. From there, Ash challenges a new gym to win his sixth badge and Dawn enters another contest and meets a new rival in a snooty girl named Ursula. Then Team Galactic returns to make trouble in a two-parter episode, and Ash and Dawn both have one of their Pokemon evolve. Even Team Rocket gets their own episode which finds the trio possibly splitting up forever (yeah, they seem to do that every season, but it's still amusing).

The episodes are presented as they aired on television, albeit without without the obnoxious ads on the bottom of the screen. It should be noted that these were the last episodes produced for the full screen format, and therefore are presented as such. The episodes themselves are crisp and clean with very little, if any, artifacting. The discs are barebones, with no bonuses to be found, but each episode has logical chapter stops, which is welcome. Overall, a great addition for a Pokemon fan's library.",1306108800,4,1239,4.7627906976744185
4331211,4,B004D2GMSU,"Very good for those who like Pokemon. While it is not my personal favorite of the series, it is still very good. It has several funny parts, a gym battle, and a pokemon that evolves. I am not sure what else as I have not finished watching the box set. Fans of the series will probably want the box set to complete their collection. The episodes on the box set are:
1 Get Your Rotom Running!
2 A Breed Stampede!
3 Ancient Family Matters!
4 Dealing with Defensive Types!
5 Leading a Stray!
6 Steeling Peace of Mind!
7 Saving the World From Ruins!
8 Cheers on Castaways Isle!
9 Hold the Phione!
10 Another One Gabites the Dust!
11 Stealing the Conversation!
12 The Drifting Snorunt!
13 Noodles! Roamin' Off!
14 Pursueing a Lofty Goal!
15 Trials and Adulations!

Any pokemon fan will probably like this. People who like action with some comedy without having to much violence also might like this.",1300492800,5,893,4.478527607361963
