8228076,5,B0007759A2,"This is what documentary making is all about.  The process of creating a mechanism that enables you to witness the true craziness of our country.  To experience the passion that most people only dream of (perhaps in nightmares) being played out on a daily basis by those who truly 'live their passion.'  This is great entertainment and Scott Herriott delivers another fine piece of work.  I can't wait to see what he comes up with next.

Go ahead.. order yourself a copy - and extras for gifts!  Christmas is never far away you know..",1111968000,,534,4.627659574468085
8228077,5,B0007759A2,"I loved this DVD of interesting people and roadside attractions such as The Concrete Field of Corn, FridgeHenge (Stonehenge but with fridges instead of stones) and the taxidermist!!!! I loved being along for the ride visiting 17 places in America that are truly one-of-a-kind...and fun! These places don't visit themselves people so go buy the DVD, grab a map and roadtrip to adventure!

I've never been disappointed yet with Mr. Herriott's documentaries, especially with his wonderful take on each his subjects and his story-teller eye. It's been a great pleasure to let people know about his latest DVDs as I watch them; they're really fun and ""edumacational"" too. Double yay! Well, what are you waiting for, people? Tell a friend. Tell a stranger. Tell a talking parakeet. GO! GO! GO!",1110412800,,787,5.053846153846154
8228078,5,B0007759A2,"An interesting and funny look at traveling the United States, and the unique people woven in its fabric. Herriott is an informed and skilled filmaker with an open and unique perspective. The film's enthusiasm for the ""everyman"", no matter how odd or disturbed he and his interests may be, invites the viewer along for the ride. Highly recommended.",1108771200,,347,5.0
8228079,5,B0007759A2,I really enjoyed this movie! I've watched several times. It's fun and quirky. It made me want to hit the open road and check out this great land of ours. There are a lot of interesting characters that reminded me about the importance of living your passion...even if that means taxidermy with road kill. Dugout Dick was my favorite! This movie is a must for people with wanderlust in their soul.,1104710400,3,395,4.577464788732394
