8592169,5,B00DDHFKW0,"Terrific movie. Story and script are excellent with a lot of humorous moments despite the fact that this is basically a melodrama. Its very human and emotional as well. Barbara Stanwyck's performance is exceptional- so real! It would be worth getting the movie just to see her. That said, the supporting actors are all excellent. Its hard for me to believe that Barbara wasn't even nominated for the academy award that year. It was one of the absolute best performances by an actress that I've ever seen! Highly recommended. By the way, this the movie that made her a star.",1507680000,,573,4.74
8592170,5,B00DDHFKW0,"Excellent movie, in a pre-code vein, but still not even as racy as what you can find on prime time networks today. Barbara Stanwyck is electric and  heart-warming as a tough-talking social hostess who is inspired to dream a little bigger and open her heart by Ralph Graves privileged and principled artist.",1486944000,,306,4.884615384615385
8592171,4,B00DDHFKW0,"See Barbara Stanwyck and what made her such a popular leading lady.  The story is very good and the acting great, characters believable.  Saw this movie in our local theater that plays the old time films ... and I am always surprised by how great they are.",1391817600,6,256,4.425531914893617
