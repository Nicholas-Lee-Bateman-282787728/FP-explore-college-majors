8110088,5,B000EHT4U6,"Although the first review gave this only one star, I still bought the DVD. I'm glad I did. The audio and visual are excellent. This is a great overview of blues solo piano styles. It's good just to watch and listen to, and also get some general instruction. But it would be difficult to mimic what Kenny Wayne is playing as there are no over-hand shots, he plays fast, and there's no sheet music. Nevertheless, I don't think those are necessary. I take this DVD as sitting down and watching a great musician play. In other words, it's more inspirational than instructional. If you're aware that's what your getting, it's worth five stars. I can see just having this one playing while I cook.",1258588800,,691,4.580645161290323
8110089,1,B000EHT4U6,"If you're looking for instruction, keep looking.  This guy can certainly play the blues, but the instruction is limited.  There is almost no slow motion of the fingering and not a mention of what notes are being played.  Video quality is excellent, but it is filmed from the right and left sides of the keyboard (no overhead shot) and the keys are often obscured from view.  Add to that frequent switching of the viewing angle and it's almost impossible to follow what's being played.",1202169600,2,484,4.726190476190476
