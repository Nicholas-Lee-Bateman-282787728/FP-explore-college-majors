1406858,5,B000059LHG,"Pioneer does really good jobs with these DVDs.  The quality can be seen by its clear lines in the previous volumes.  The episodes that appear on this volume are:
9) Sakura and the Mysterious Brooch (Sword Card) 10) Sakura and the Flower's Athletic Meet (Flower Card) 11) Sakura and Tomoyo's big house (Shield Card) 12) Sakura and the never-ending day (Time Card)
Sakura catches a card in each episode.  She's slowly coming closer to getting all the cards back.  Each of these episodes tell a little more about the pasts of each character.  Especially episodes 10 and 11.  You learn more about Sakura's mother and about Tomoyo and her mother.  Another great DVD that should be in anyone's collection.",982886400,11,699,4.823529411764706
1406859,5,B000059LHG,"Many things are revealed in this volume, especially concerning relationships - Li's reasons for running away from Yukito in the pervious volume are shown, the relationship (and something of a love triangle) of Sakura's parents and Tomoyo's mother is detailed, and there are some priceless moments contained here... While the episodes on this volume aren't as ""action packed"" as the ones on some of the other volumes, this volume develops the characters very well and is quite appealing.  The art continues to be above average for a TV series, the music is suiting and cute, and the seiyuu (voice actors) are really top-of-the-line, especially Sakura Tange, who plays Sakura Kinomoto.  If you're a Cardcaptor Sakura fan, you owe it to yourself to buy this!  If you've only seen that Cardcaptors junk on TV, then you're in for a real treat if you buy this, as this product is *far* superior to what they air on TV.",981072000,24,912,4.833333333333333

1406909,5,B000059LHG,"I LOVE CARD CAPTOR SAKURA!! And the main reason why you will too, is if you perfer Digital Quality imagery and Sound.

If you use your imagination, it sounds like they are speaking in English!(To me anyway)Li-Kun is kaiwaii too! I'm a crazed anime otaku(basicly obsessed), and have seen many animes.

1406911,5,B000059LHG,"The third volume of Cardcaptor Sakura has some of the best episodes in the Clow Card arc.  There's alot of character development in the four episodes on this DVD, and less plot develpment, but IMHO, CCS's strong point is it's wonderful characters.  ^_^

1406912,5,B000059LHG,"I love Cardcaptor Sakura. I used to be a long fan of Cardcaptors, but that was until I found the original uncut DVD at my video store. My opinion sure changed!
This is a great vid to start out on, with some wonderful dialogue.
Sakura, Tomoyo, and a Mansion is one of my favourite episodes on here, especially after Kero gets his cake ^^!
Pick this up... I trust you won't be disappointed.",1000684800,,388,4.328767123287672
1406913,5,B000059LHG,"Now for those who want to see a review; skip this part and go right to the last paragraph. I need to vent a little. I don't really care what the guidelines say. I understand about not trying to disagree with someone else's opinion, which I did not, but other than that, there's no reason why we shouldn't be about to say something about other reviews. :p
First of all, I wanted to respond to this ""viewer"" from tx...I know it's just better to ignore such unintelligent blather, but he/she has DEGRADED this archive with his so-called ""review."" Not only has he/she brought down the overall score of what is considered by nearly all who watch it to be a wonderful anime, but also, as can be seen by his/her ""review,"" has done so without even actually SEEING it, and therefore DISCARDED his/her right to pass judgement upon it! What's next, are you going to go and review a movie based strictly on what nationality the star of the movie is? I mean, I really WOULD understand if you had seen the show in this form to begin with and just didn't like the fact that they are speaking Japanese......almost. You see, they DO have a dubbed version of this anime(I'm sure you knew this), so what exactly is the point of coming in here and disgracing us with your inane whining of this particular title's not being in English? For crying out loud, go watch your precious dub and let us, people who are fans of the ORIGINAL, SUPERIOR show(I guarantee you'd agree if you actually had the willpower to ""brave"" such an intrepid undertaking as watching the show in Japanese with subtitles), have our peace.
Gomen nasai(I'm very sorry). I really dislike it when people try to make heard an opinion of theirs that doesn't even exist. People review what they have seen, not what they THINK will be bad. That's how reviews work, so if you're going to write them, do it by good merit. For those of you who know exactly what I'm talking about, again, gomen ne for having to put up with this. That is all.
This is a great story, with great(and kawaii^^) characters, great(and kawaii! ^_^) music, and great(and kawaii of course!) just about about everything else! It would be a real shame for you to miss this stuff, so hear my opinion and don't! For those of you who have never seen anime in Japanese with subtitles, this would be a terrific place to start. And if you're a big anime vet, you won't be disappointed, especially if you like an anime that focuses a bit more on the characters than the plot. Ep. 9-12 are some of the best out of the 6 volumes that have been announced so far, so make this one high on your priorities list.",999475200,,2611,4.453027139874739
1406914,5,B000059LHG,"And once more we enter the world of Cardcaptor Sakura! And this time we learn more about Sakura's mother, and that Sakura and Tomoyo are second cousins!
First up, the battle for the Sword card. This one was in the dub, so I doubt there's anything I can say you probably don't already know.
Next, another episode missing from the dub, the capture of the Flower card at a school track meet(they call it a Athletic Festival, but, whatever!). Here we also meet Sonomi, Tomoyo-Chan's mother, for the first time.
Third up for perusal, the Shield card turns up in Tomoyo's house! I have only one thing to say: I WANT THAT HOUSE!! Tomoyo's got her own film screening room CONNECTED TO HER BEDROOM! GIMME, GIMME, GIMME!
Finally, we end with another ep. that made the dub, the challenge of the Time card. Can you say ""Time Loop""? Sure, I knew you could!

7933617,5,B000059LHG,"The grand original! Sweet and compelling, this is the saga of a little girl who finds herself enmeshed in a magical world of cards! Magical cards which have escaped their bonds, and now flash about in many different guises, wreaking havoc. Young Sakura must re-capture the entire deck, using the powers of the cards she already has: with a little help from her magical sidekick, Kero-chan. His name is a bit of a joke; it's really Cerberus (""Keroberos""), but Sakura calls him by an affectionate diminuative construction of it.

The Americanized version,released as ""Cardcaptors,"" was heavily edited and even had dialogue re-written to make it more of a boy/girl show instead of primarily a ""Magical Girl"" series, even ""dumbed it down"" a bit in some ways. Appropriate for any age, the stories are easy to follow but tense and dramatic. Parents, you can enjoy watching them with the kids! In fact, I'd already been an anime fan when my kids got me into this! The stories and characters really drive this series, and put it several cuts above the average ""monster of the week"" anime in the Pokemon model.

The only thing I could list as a possible downside are the obligatory ""transformation"" scenes which turn little Sakura-chan into Cardcaptor Sakura. You do get them every episode, occasionally twice, if I recall. But this is standard for the genre and I think an ""anchor point,"" especially for the younger viewers. I don't mind it, but other older viewers might find it tedious, especially if you are watching a few eps at a time, and not just once a week, as originally intended.

Just a cautionary word -- Japanese culture has its own set of mores and taboos, as does the Western world. Sometimes the characters seem to express affection for each other in a way that Western ears might find suggestive. Remember, the main cast are only ten years old! For example, Sakura's friend Tomoyo who videotapes her adventures seems to have quite a crush on Sakura, although Sakura herself seems rather puzzled by this,and Syaoran Li, Sakura's classmate and rival Cardcaptor, seems to have a crush on the same teenage boy Sakura does! Not too much should be inferred though, as this in part reflects another convention of anime, showing that a character (the older boy) who seems to be secondary is actually much more important than he seems at first. There is no suggestive activity at all, just the occasional expressions of fondness. This is further complicated by the fact the Japanese word ""suki"" (pr. ""skee"") can be translated as either ""like"" or ""love,"" depending on the context or even on the translator. In any case, I doubt it anything startling enough that a younger viewer would even pick up on it, but if it is a concern, watch through the eps first and decide what bits (if any) you need to FF through! I'll say this, I AM a particular parent regarding this kind of thing, and I have NO problem with this series. It never even occured to me until I saw remarks about it elsewhere, and I was like, ""Surely you can't be serious!""

But bottom line -- this is a terrific series, full of heart, one of anime's real landmarks. It's a cliche`, but this really S a ""must-see.""",1369180800,,3176,4.717117117117117

7933621,5,B000059LHG,"Just like the two DVDs before it, FRIENDS FOREVER is a wonderful set of episodes.  Sakura is just as adorable as ever and we start to see even more of the relationships - Li, for example, along with his interactions with everyone else.  After all, he didn't join us until the last episode of the second DVD.

On this DVD, Sakura is faced with challenges such as saving the life of her friend while trying to capture the card controlling her and battling a card that turns back time!  There are also two adorably sweet episodes that address the relationship between Tomoyo's mother and Sakura's mother and Sakura gets to learn more about the mother she never knew.  No shortage of moments to 'Awww' over on this DVD!

Also, as a nifty bonus, there's an art gallery in the extras.  Included are about 25 pictures of Sakura and her friends - concept drawings showing different poses and facial expressions, along with the occasional battle costume.  It's not a whole lot but it's cute to flip through once or twice.  Like the rest of my Sakura DVDs though, I buy for the show, not the extras.

I was just as thrilled to see this one as I was the previous two - Sakura is still just as darling as ever.  The artwork is gorgeous, the voice acting wonderful, and you'll find yourself laughing and smiling in no time.",1032220800,8,1310,4.485232067510548
