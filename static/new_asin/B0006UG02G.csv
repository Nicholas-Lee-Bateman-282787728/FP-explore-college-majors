2196251,5,B0006UG02G,"This is one of my all time favorites. It is the series attempting to be more relivent to the issues of the day; in this case it is pollution. It is also one of the few times where Godzilla and man got along and worked together, these are always my favorite",1394928000,,256,4.03921568627451

This was a transaction that was far beyond 5 stars....I would give it 10 stars if I could! The film is classic A DON'T MISS!!",1392163200,,510,4.4361702127659575

It is not one of the easy ones to find, but your collection won't be complete without it. Just go to Amazon and type in Godzilla movies, Amazon has them all of coarse. This movie arrived at my door in 2 days and it is in english and it works perfectly. Thank you Amazon!",1377302400,3,426,3.9651162790697674

2196274,4,B0006UG02G,"The Movie--The weirdest Godzilla film ever, complete with annoying small child. Godzilla is in superhero action against a smelly entropic blob, doing Woodsy Owl's job of taking on pollution head-on. The 4 rounds between G and Hedorah make for big monster rumble action, interspersed with anti-pollution messages. the music is strange, but fits.
The DVD is Pan and Scan, and this film deserves widescreen, though--otherwise, very watchable.",1371168000,5,439,5.567164179104478
2196275,5,B0006UG02G,"Quality isn't good, its not as bad as the alpha video Megalon but its still like watching a VHS. But the casing is very cool, it says to be a Korean import but there isn't any mark of which company put it out, it looks too good to be a bootleg though. The korean writing on it will make your collection very cool and for under 20 bucks its definitly worth having. The film itself is very cool, the concept of a monster created by pollution is very good, it is still relevant today. Defintily 5 stars overall and worth getting despite the picture quality.",1349136000,10,554,4.285714285714286
2196286,4,B0006UG02G,I want to thank the people at thebookgrove for taking my feelings into concern. The item I had ordered was not in as good of shape as they had thought it was and they decided to refund my money rather than keep it and send me the bad DVD. I truly appreciate that and I will definitely recommend them in the future.,1287273600,,314,4.080645161290323
2196287,2,B0006UG02G,"Just to point out that this set is dubbed. Quite the opposite of the earlier reviewer; as a true Godzilla fan, I have no interest in dubbed films. Stay away from this set and pick up one of the other packages that have the ORIGINAL Japanese language only, or at the VERY least, as a choice.",1253404800,2,290,4.196428571428571
2196288,3,B0006UG02G,"The video duplication for the dvds is so-so.  Both movies are English-dubbed.  However, if you are a true Godzilla collector, you will want to own this dvd, especially if you watched the dubbed movies on tv in the 1970s.

On this dvd, you will find the English version of the song, Save the Earth, used in the introductory credits in Godzilla vs the Smog Monster.  When the movie was re-released in the original Japanese language with optional English dubbing (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Godzilla-Vs-Hedorah/dp/B0002V7OEM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Godzilla Vs Hedorah</a>, the English-lyrics of Save the Earth song were eliminated from the English dubbed movie; the Japanese lyrics were retained.",1253318400,7,740,6.086538461538462
2196289,5,B0006UG02G,"I like this two disc Godzilla set, too. The 2 movies are really cool and VERY enjoyable if you can overlook splices, etc..Get this one if you can and enjoy some great 1970's monster madness!",1242777600,4,190,4.457142857142857
2196290,1,B0006UG02G,"If your a Godzilla ""super fan"", you'll want this disc. It has the original American Internation Pictures dub for VS. Smog Monster. The only other way to enjoy the AIP dub is to own the hard to find Orion video tape or laser disc. (I'm lucky to have both).
Be forwarned: The prints of both movies are the worst ever. They're scratchy and are full of splices.
If you have a multi-region DVD player, (which are sold on amazon.com, I recommend the Oppo brand)their is a Austrailian reg. 4 DVD of Godzilla Vs. Megalon that is letterboxed. Its also very inexpensive to ship, thanks to  the U.S. dollar being worth more than the Austrailian dollar.
Just remember the prints on this budget disc are horrid!!!!",1231113600,5,701,4.608
2196291,5,B0006UG02G,"What can I say...if you love Godzilla, and collect the movies you have to have this.  My sons are such people, and this is one of the Christmas gifts for them.  They'll love it!",1225238400,,177,4.176470588235294
2196292,1,B0006UG02G,"This is a horrible repro made on someone's home pc.
The movie I got was in some widescreen format that was converted from full screen so all picture was stretched (sort of like the jacket on the dvd case)!
DONT BUY IT!!
P.S. I think that this cheezy flicks company has taken their company name a little too literally. Ten bucks is also a bit much for a movie that appears like it was reformatted by a person who had gone right outta their tree.",1222128000,,444,4.235294117647059
2196293,4,B0006UG02G,"I'm a godzilla fanatic, the movies on this dvd has very poor quality in both audio and video. Both films are in full frame as well, not wide screen. Your better buying godzilla vs. hedorah aka; godzilla vs. the smog monster on dvd from columbia/tristar in widescreen and both in english & japanease versions in widescreen & full frame as well. Godzilla vs. Megalon is only in VHS & recorded in long play version, full frame. The audio & picture quality is a lot clearer to watch. Like I said I'm a fanatic and they cost a little more, but it's worth buying.",1176595200,,557,4.41747572815534
2196294,3,B0006UG02G,"If you are buying this for anything other than because you want the very hard-to-find AIP dub of ""Godzilla Vs. The Smog Monster"" then save your money. If you look at this as a solo feature with just that movie and its cheesy ""Save The Earth"" theme song, then you'll get your money's worth. The picture isn't very good and it is full screen but for those looking to reclaim that Saturday morning nostalgia then you really can't go wrong.

As for ""Godzilla Vs. Megalon"", it just isn't worth even including it on the disc. I say that not as a Godzilla fan who finds this childish entry an insult to the series. Oh, it is. Don't get me wrong. But the problem here isn't the quality of the film but of the transfer. Despite the cover's claim of the movie being ""Digitally Remastered"" with ""superior picture & sound quality"", it is anything but. Even the least disgrminating DVD fan will more than likely find this transfer unwatchable. For starters, the movie skips all over the place for several minutes. I couldn't tell you how long as I chose to turn the DVD off after about five or six minutes in. And no, this is not a problem with the DVD itself. Clearly whatever bargain-basement laserdisc the good folks at DDC chose to transfer it from had a few scratches on it. I have checked on more than one disc and the problem remains so it's not a defect. But wait there's more. For some odd reason, the picture is even more cropped than in the original full frame version. Picture what a movie would like if you hit the ""zoom"" button on your DVD controller while watching a full-screen movie and that's pretty much what the picture looks like. Now, keep in mind that the original aspect ratio to start with was 2.35:1 and you're getting a good idea of just how awful this movie looks like. In other words, if you're buying this movie for ""Megalon"", save your cash.",1172793600,,1859,4.451612903225806
2196295,3,B0006UG02G,"There are a couple of reasons to buy this DVD and one of them is NOT Godzilla vs. Megalon. It's cheap. Very cheap. Don't pay more than 3 or 4  bucks for it. This contains the original theatrical release of Godzilla vs. the Smog Monster, including the English version of the song, SAVE THE EARTH! I still remember that refrain some 30 years after first watching the movie & when I watched the far superior quality of GODZILLA VS.HEDORA (Sony's release of the movie), I was disappointed to find it did NOT include that translation. The other odd thing to me was that in the Sony  version, the little boy's voice does not seem like a little boy's voice (in English). It sounds like a woman trying to sound like a little boy -- an annoyance more than anything else. In Smog, he does sound like a youngster. So you buy this version, really, because you are haunted by SAVE THE EARTH and it's cheap. If Sony releases Godzilla vs. Hedora with the English lyrics to the song, you have no reason to buy Godzilla vs. Smog Monster (other than the title.) I ignore Megalon. I won't suffer through the poor picture quality and not even have a cool song to listen to!",1168646400,,1153,4.408450704225352
2196306,4,B0006UG02G,"This Godzilla double feature includes the following two movies:

2196309,1,B0006UG02G,"This company, Digital Disk, should be reported to Toho and Tristar.  First off, Tristar holds all the American rights to Godzilla vs Hedorah and no company in America holds rights to Godzilla vs Megalon as far as I know.  Godzilla vs Megalon isn't a very good movie either.  I just want to have a good quality one, like Tristar's other G-DVDs, but I wouldn't pay a buck for this especially since it's a bootleg!  And I can look at the cover and see that this company is trying to rip you off by putting the newer Godzilla suit from the Millennium Series on it.  These two films were made in the Showa series.  I advise anyone who likes Godzilla to go buy Tristar's Godzilla vs Hedorah and wait until an American company gets the rights to Megalon.",1124755200,2,747,4.416058394160584

Purchase ""Godzilla vs Hedorah"" from Sony/Tristar for the best DVD release of this film.  Languages are the original Japanese w/ subtitles and the Toho International English dub.  To get the AIP English dub, which was the version released to American theaters years ago, find a copy of the Smog Monster/Megalon Double Feature cheapie DVD on eBay.

8043394,1,B0006UG02G,"This one star rating, and bad review is NOT for the movies themselves, but for the quality of this DVD. I love these movies, and have since I was little. I must be stricken with writers block as I'm writing this review, because I simply cannot find words to adequately describe how absolutely terrible the quality is. It looks like someone took a VHS tape that was dubbed from another tape, which was dubbed from yet another tape, that was dubbed from the original 16mm film roll that was left to mildew and deteriorate in a hot garage somewhere. Yeah, it's that bad. And the sound, forget it. It's like watching it at a drive-in theater. I find it very hard to believe that this company digitally remastered the movies. If anything, it was just a VHS to DVD copy they semi-mass produced in Canada. I've seen better video quality on YouTube with a slow internet connection. The copyright notification is vague and shady. It reads as follows...

""AUTHORED AND REMASTERED BY DDC LABS. MADE IN CANADA.
WARNING: This digital video is licensed for private home use only.
The copyright providers prohibit any other use including, but not limited
to rental, duplication, or public performance in whole or in part. Violators
will be prosecuted under Canada Copyright Law (Public Law 94-553)""

Okay, great. Who holds the license? Where did they get the license from? There are also grammatical errors that I can't help but be entertained by. I don't have the best grammar, but I'm not the guy doing a synopsis for the back of a DVD. The description for Megalon has things like ""Thieves steal a Robot, Jet Jaguar, from a local inventor, Goro and program it lead Megalon to destroy Tokyo."" Why is robot capitalized? They didn't do that for the word Kingdom. The synopsis for Hedorah (which they misspell as Hedora) is just bad. Bad enough I'm going to show you the whole thing! It reads...

Godzilla must defeat the environmentally dangerous smog-spewing monster called Hedora. Hedora was created from man's own industrial waste. This movie is from an era when Godzilla was a hero to man instead of the original dangerous monster. Godzilla is a type of dinosaur that somehow survived to modern times and was mutated by atomic radiation. The first Godzilla movie, GOJIRA was released in 1954 in Japan. Over 24 Godzilla movies have been made since then.""

The first sentence is the ONLY mention of the movie you're reading about. The whole thing seems to have been written by a child who read the back of a few DVDs. My final gripe is the cover art. The picture of Godzilla used on the front is from a more recent movie, somewhere between Godzilla 2000 and Final Wars. But definitely NOT either of these. There are 3 pictures for each film featured, placed next to the movie synopsis' on the back. However, the pictures for Megalon are next to the Hedorah synopsis, and vice-versa.

In closing, the only thing about this DVD that could be a reason to buy it, is that (supposedly) the versions presented are some kind of English dub that was exclusive to TV in the 70s. Well, I wasn't alive back then, so I can't justify the $50 - $100 price tag I've seen this listed for. I only paid $4 for it and I feel totally ripped off. However, some collectors have to have EVERY version of whatever it is they collect, and they might want to pick this up. Other than that, I recommend you avoid this at all costs. Not only are these movies available on DVD and Blu-Ray from companies who really did RESTORE the films, but they're much less expensive, and 100% authentic.",1464480000,2,3547,4.64171974522293
