8182070,4,B000NVHWCK,"When was the last time you spoke to your partner about your secret desire to have your anus appreciated and loved? Why do dogs instinctively know that a friendly posterior sniff is truly the very best way to get to know another fast, no smalltalk?  What can we learn about social graces from our canine friends? Anyway, back to the core of the matter...Like my Grandaddy Lovelace used to say, ""Son, there comes a time in every man's life when he must step up to the task at hand."" This fun DVD will give you pointers on the delights of rectal romance even YOU (you know who you are if you are reading this) could never have imagined! So, get the movie, crack open a bottle, get a can of Crisco and start practicing on your partner or, if you are pathetically single and alone, dig in on your own fat posterior. Don't wait; bowel movements don't!",1256256000,4,845,4.382165605095541
8182071,5,B000NVHWCK,"While writing ""Anal Sex for Couples,"" I watched all of the anal-instruction videos. I believe this to be the best of the bunch and I recommended that my readers study it. The techniques shown are unique, easy to master and feel great.

The negative reviews are probably based on the fact that some of the techniques are demonstrated by same-sex couples. This should not influence your decision -- the anus is the universal pleasure center and gender-phobia has no relevance.

I also recommend the techniques taught in ""Anal Pleasure and Health"" by Jack Morin.",1227484800,28,559,4.9361702127659575
8182072,1,B000NVHWCK,Waste of money. Didn't really show you anything you don't already know as an adult. Very disappointed in this product. Would not recommend.,1224115200,,139,5.086956521739131
8182073,2,B000NVHWCK,this could have been a great video but instead was just a mix of fat ugly gay people.  I was misled but the advertising and would not recommend this for anyone who might be heterosexual and just looking for something a little different.  I felt this was something that should have been tagged as GAY ONLY.......,1199836800,4,311,4.535714285714286
8182074,5,B000NVHWCK,"Unlike the above gentleman, I was really pleased with this production. It gives relevant, explicit instruction on the topic without lapsing into dippy mysticism or leering smut. I have recommended it to other sex educators as one of the best DVDs in the field of sex instruction.",1174435200,56,279,4.957446808510638
