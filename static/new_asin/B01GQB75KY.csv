8763301,5,B01GQB75KY,These cartoons are phenomenal! They remind of classic Disney cartoons and others that didn't have voice acting. The animation is clean and each episode has a coherent story.,1484179200,,173,5.214285714285714

This DVD is funny and awesome!",1482451200,,126,3.7037037037037037
8763304,4,B01GQB75KY,"Its crazy that this DVD is Season 3 Volume 1, I didn't even realize there were so many mini-episodes! I've only seen a few episodes before. This collection features 13 mini episodes for a total of 31 minutes.  The episodes are super short but fun to watch and short enough to watch ""just one more."" There are also some silly Special Features included to watch.

I received this to review in exchange for sharing my honest opinion.",1472601600,2,430,4.571428571428571
