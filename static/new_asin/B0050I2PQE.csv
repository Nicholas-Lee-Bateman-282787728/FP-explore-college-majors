4514176,5,B0050I2PQE,Must have new release for Bolin/Coverdale/Hughs fans. It's even better than I expected. Only wish all the songs played were from Come Taste the Band LP.,1335657600,,152,4.884615384615385
4514177,5,B0050I2PQE,"I have always had a soft spot in my hard rock/metal collection for the Mark IV line up of Deep Purple. Coverdale and Huges I always thought were an excellent fit for the band and created some of the best music that the band had ever done (in MKIII and IV). Tommy Bolin was an excellent player, but as noted by many others, was plagued with health caused by substance use problems. When I learned that this collection was coming out and then saw what it offered when it was promoted on That Metal Show, I knew I had to have it, and put it on my wish list. For the price that it's going for now, it is a steal. The DVD show of Japan is good quality as others have noted, and the CD that comes with it features material from Japan and from Long Beach performances, nicely placed together on this disc. The documentary is informative and I think well done. My favorite part of this set is the 2 books that come with it. One book is of articles and promotional items of and around late mark II, Mark III and Mark IV items. The second is the ""Getting Tighter"" The story of MKIV Deep Purple, which tells the story of how it formed, the hype behind, the reality of it, and the demise. Overall and excellent DVD/CD set with good show, great documentary, and excellent packaging. A must have for any purple fan, and fascinating story.",1325030400,3,1324,4.278884462151394
4514178,5,B0050I2PQE,"A very interesting review of what the life behind the scenes was during the MK IV era. Very impressive interviews with Jon Lord and Glenn Hughes and incredible stories revealed. For all Tommy Bolin's fan nice live takes of him playing.
I'm personally very impressed.",1323734400,,266,4.933333333333334
4514179,5,B0050I2PQE,"Ironically, living in a small town in Wisconsin (I am 49), my first Purple album was a cut out of ""Come Taste the Band"", and I worked back from that.  I also haven't seen much of this footage at all, prior to this DVD.  So, while I was very familiar with the music, I wasn't with the particulars.  This package is an enlightening view into the changes of the band, and its ultimate demise.  The concert footage is the only Bolin era that is available, per Glenn Hughes.  The documentary is fascinating, in its candidness and also breadth of experience.  Be aware, the only two current contributors are Jon Lord and Glenn Hughes, so it is through their very honest eyes, but theirs only.  There may be some disagreement, especially the Indonesia incident, if you do research on your own.  It also ends up having a lot of Hughes' drug issues, and by association, Bolen's.  I did find it fascinating, and as my title says, sad.  A great band, in name, morphs into a different, but very skilled version (face it, Purple was never stagnant when it come to members).  Curious what could have happened, but it would have been different from MK II.  I enjoyed it very much; not everyone may.",1319587200,2,1183,4.528301886792453
4514180,5,B0050I2PQE,"The documentary is very well done and interesting with vintage clips and current interviews with Glenn Hughes and Jon Lord. It is a great account of the Deep Purple Mk IV era and I highly recommend it to any hardcore Deep Purple fans, especially Mk III and IV fans. The concert DVD is also very nice with the opportunity to see pro-shot footage of the highly talented collection of Coverdale, Hughes, Bolin, Lord and Paice together.",1313971200,7,432,4.697368421052632
4514181,4,B0050I2PQE,"I hadn't seen the Rises Over Japan footage since it's brief appearance on VHS tape (which I rented at my local Tower Video store back sometime around the mid 80's).  The performance is everything that I remember it ""not being""... shame it was an off night!  That being said, for the DVD release they've cleaned it up nicely and given it a 5.1 mix and after all, it is a chance to see Tommy with Purple.

The Interviews and documentary footage are priceless... what a dark period for the band.  Crazy times indeed!

Thank you to the powers that be for putting this release together!",1312588800,8,581,4.495238095238095
4514182,3,B0050I2PQE,"I won't recap all of what is on here as others will do that.

For Deep Purple fans of this era it's a good product. You are essentially watching the demise of the band. What struck me on the concert footage was how good the quality was, because all I had ever seen was horrendous quality out -of -synch footage. The sound is really good and the picture is pretty good too.(Considering the era and previous versions) No synch issues. Sound and picture match up pretty well.

Ian Paice is just awesome on this show! If only he would play like this now! He's always been great, but he was exceptionally so on ""Burn"", ""Come taste the band"", and ""Malice in Wonderland"". He is really aggressive on this show. David Coverdale sings really well here too. Glenn Hughes, even when high, is a more dynamic bassist than Roger Glover. The band's core members know the band is compromised and they are trying hard to compensate, but it is what it is....It's a band without a guitarist that night.

 As for Tommy Bolin? He is so bad on this show it is staggering to witness. Hard to believe he was capable of some of the great solos we all know from ""Spectrum"", ""Mind Transplant"", ""Whips and Roses"", ""Ebbits Field"" etc.
Jon Lord covers many of the riffs due to Bolin's supposed ""hurt/numb arm"" during this show. Bolin's stage presence is almost non-existent in comparison to Blackmore too. Just a shame all around as he just doesnt seem vested in the music. One of the booklets has an interesting quote from Lord about how Blackmore maintained a level of virtuosity even when not playing his best, and really didn't fall below that certain level.  Yet he intimates that Bolin sunk deeply at times. I've seen Blackmore on bad nights and nothing compares to this feeble Bolin performance. You will get no satisfaction of Bolin's guitar playing from this footage.

I saw this line-up in Providence Rhode Island later on during the US leg of the tour and Bolin was still only ""adequate"". Again he just seemed uninterested in what he was doing. I am a fan of his playing though, and we have do the great jazz fusion albums he played on!.... The guy could really play when he wanted to :)

 I recommend the product to anyone who likes this era of the band, and especially to anyone who likes the incredible new remaster/remix of ""Come Taste the Band"" (Remix by Kevin Shirley) This DVD has a cool booklet too, which features some pretty interesting quotes and information from some of the peripheral business people surrounding Purple. I like hearing the members discuss the band, so the documentary portion is great to have and does hold up to repeat viewings. I can't wait to see a one-star review from someone saying ""the concert is only 30 minutes man"" (Or, I didn't receive the item"")... :) :)

When you put it into perspective how little there is on this era of the band, it's a pretty cool product. I'll give it 3 stars although I'd like to give it 4. The only thing that would have made it better would be Bolin's actual playing. Perhaps some other personnel being interviewed would have been nice too. Glenn Hughes put it best ""It's a postcard from that time frame of the band"". This DVD illustrates the turmoil within the band over the drug issues of Hughes & Bolin. If you realize that going in you will probably find it a satisfying product.  In summery it's a good DVD if you know what you are buying, but NOT a good place to start for someone new to Purple's output.

Ps. There is an interesting but strange disclaimer at the end of the documentary stating that Glenn Hughes and Jon Lords comments revolving around the death of Patsy Collins are not necessarilly reflective of David Coverdales. Very strange. I wonder what Coverdale thought happened?????",1309305600,37,3746,4.592814371257485

4514186,5,B0050I2PQE,"For some reason, the older I get (45 now) the more interested I am in the less popular eras of bands. Not that the music is usually better, it's just usually better than expected. The Bee Gees early 70's stuff (post pop but pre disco) comes to mind, and the fact that only within the last few years have I realized what a fantastic album Sabbath's Technical Ecstasy is. Likewise with Purple, other than owning a video of their Cal Jam performance I knew only the basics of the Mk 3 band. I still to this day don't own any Mk 3 CDs, but I couldn't resist a chance to own this DVD/CD combo. To me, the live cd was a nice extra but nothing more than that. Don't get me wrong, it's good, just not why I purchased this. Likewise with the live DVD bonus portion from Japan in '75, although that being on here did help seal the deal for me buying this. But mostly what drew me in was hearing the story of the 1973-76 era from the band themselves. Of course, as far as newly shot interviews, it is only from the viewpoint of Glenn Hughes (whose memory might not be great, which when is the case he admits to) and Jon Lord, who I perceive as being a very reliable first hand source. Some archival interview clips of the other guys are in there occasionally too, along with some great footage and stills of the entire story, which begins from the end of the Gillan era. This video was perfect for me, knowing that Who Do We Think We Are kind of sucked even back when I was 12 in '82 and knew that it was the last Gillan album, but didn't know much about what transpired. The next thing I knew Perfect Strangers came out and the Mk 3 stage was less relevant than ever to me. So back to Phoenix Rising, and what a thorough and thoroughly enjoyable film to watch! Man, the stuff these guys went through in the 70's! It's a wonder as many of these guys made it out alive both physically, mentally and financially. Basically held hostage in a foreign country, having a band associate tossed down an elevator shaft, band members being full-fledged drug addicts. Crazy stuff! I just read Iommi's book Iron Man, same insane things there as well. Besides the interviews and still shots, there is video footage of the band in various places: press conferences, album release events, boarding planes and limos, parade footage one country had for them, just hanging out, video clips of various gigs, video of some venues where the band had some real misdealings, etc. Sometimes the Lord / Hughes interview parts are solely them on screen, other times their words are heard while the relevant footage or stills are shown, so the production is smooth, easy to follow and interesting. You can't go wrong with this DVD. The documentary is completely engrossing and informative. The concert footage is of nice quality, and that particular Japan tour is discussed quite a bit in the documentary which gives you a great perspective of it so make sure you watch the doc first. Yes Bolin's playing is bad, but nobody can change that now, and this previously only available on Japanese VHS import concert is now on DVD, and it is apparently the only concert footage of mk4. I've watched this entire disc 3 times now and I'm up for checking it out again. The booklet that comes with it has mini versions of some articles and concert reviews too, as if a documentary, a previously hard to find concert DVD, and live CD weren't enough! Pick it up, you won't be sorry.",1429574400,,3432,4.449206349206349

4514189,4,B0050I2PQE,"Released by Eagle Rock Entertainment, Deep Purple Phoenix Rising (2011) is focused on the Mark IV lineup of the band, which featured organist Jon Lord, drummer Ian Paice, bass player Glenn Hughes, vocalist David Coverdale (Whitesnakke), and newcomer Tommy Bolin, who replaced the legendary Ritchie Blackmore on guitar.  After releasing the album&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Come-Taste-the-Band/dp/B000SQJ2JG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Come Taste the Band</a>&nbsp;in 1975, Purple embarked on a tour, and remained together until Bolin's untimely death from a drug overdose in 1976.

Phoenix Rising consists of ""Deep Purple Rises Over Japan"", a 30 minute live performance from 1975, in Budokan, Japan, ""Coming Home"" an 80 minute documentary, interviews, and an ""electronic press kit"" for Come Taste the Band.  Total runtime is a little over 2 hours.  Also included is a 28 page booklet containing mostly press clippings related to the Mark IV lineup, and a second 36 booklet that is a companion to the ""Coming Home"" documentary.  For those interested in this period of Deep Purple's history, this is a very nice package, that attempts to shine a light on this short lived iteration of Deep Purple.  While this is a noble endeavor, unfortunately there are a few factors that keep Phoenix Rising from being a complete success.

Good quality live video from Tommy Bolin's time with Purple is apparently quite rare.  While the video quality of the Budokan performance is pretty decent, it unfortunately does not feature Bolin or the band, at their best.  Because the guitarist had injured his arm, Bolin was not able to perform as he normally would.  To compensate for Bolin's impairment, Jon Lord's organ assumes a more prominent role.  This is particularly noticeable on Burn, where the guitar should be the dominant lead instrument, but instead Lord's Hammond the carries the main riff.  In general, Bolin's playing seems subdued and not particularly impressive, as this performance fails to provide a true indication of his playing ability.

On the plus side, the rest of the band sounds fabulous.  Coverdale's voice is powerful and huge, while Hughes and Paice are rock solid.  Jon Lord works extra hard carrying an additional load, adding a richness to his playing.

Among the five songs featured in the live set, Love Child, and You Keep On Moving, are slower bluesy numbers from Come Taste the Band, where Tommy Bolin acquits himself pretty well.  The guitarist displays some energy on Smoke on the Water, but seems rather lackluster on Highway Star, and the aforementioned Burn, where he does not come close to matching the attitude and intensity that Blackmore typical brought to those songs.

The documentary Coming Home features retrospective comments from the late Jon Lord, Glenn Hughes, and Ian Paice, while Tommy Bolin and David Coverdale appear in archival footage.  Not hearing from Blackmore is understandable, but Coverdale's absence is like a massive black hole.  The band's adventures in Jakarta, where a member of the touring party tragically died, is quite harrowing, and along with Bolin's subsequent death, and Hughes' drug excesses, helps to give the period a certain dark tone and grim flavor.

There is no question that an earnest and sincere effort was made to take a retrospective look at the Mark IV lineup, and pay them the respect they deserved.  It is just too bad that for various reasons, this admirable goal was not achieved.  While there are some aspects that are disappointing, hardcore fans of Deep Purple, should still find things that would be of historical interest, in this very solid four star package.  In addition to the DVD only release, there is also a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/two-disk-release/dp/B0050I2PQE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">two disk release</a>&nbsp;that features a CD with additional live tracks.",1425254400,,3950,5.48019801980198

the rest of the tracks were written by Glenn Hughes & David coverdale with little input from Ian Paice, Jon Lord
Deep purple's show at the SUNBURY festival 1975 in Melbourne AUS
is told in Great detail from both members, lots of archive footage from the festival
David and Jon being interviewed at the Festival
Glenn Hughes's cocaine addiction is told in Great detail from his words, pretty tragic it's a miracle he got sobered up
Ritchie blackmore quitting is mentioned in Great detail
Jon Lord says that he should've left the band when Blackmore left but for some reason he carried on
Tommy Bolin's into to the band is talked about in Great detail
the Jarkarta show in late 1975 is talks about in Great detail

and Come taste the band press kit

the only surviving concert footage with Tommy Bolin is only this Blu-ray aswell
it's the lost concert from Japan that was pro-shot TV broadcast for Japan at the Budokan venue in Tokyo
this is the concert where Tommy could not play much at all
and Jon Lord had to play twice as hard to for most of the show which only went for 30mins
Tommy was High on Morfiene on the day of the concert which made his arm very Numb
which obviously effected his playing for this Japan concert
obviously fans of Tommy Bolin will love watching this concert
a all new HD transfer this concert has been restored & new 5.1 surround sound so it looks and sounds better than ever

i'm more of fan of the mark II lineup myself although BURN is my favourite Mark III album
i only liked some tracks from STORMBRINGER, the hardrock tracks only
COME TASTE THE BAND is viewed as Bolin, coverdale & Hughes effort only
Ian Paice, Jon lord only contributed a little
i like a few tracks from Tommy Bolin's only deep purple record but that's it

but if you loved albums like COME TASTE THE BAND, STORMBRINGER, BURN
get this Phoenix rising blu-ray
the best and only told Documentary on the mark 3-4 lineup plus you get the lost TV broadcasted concert for Japan

However,the cd stinks. There is that annoying pop or gap between each song ,even if the songs are from the same gig. There must be a way to smooth that out in the mastering. If they take the time to hand pick the songs why did they not at least make it sound like a real show? That aside the sound is vastly improved from any other versions. I am probably nitpicking here,but it is aggravating.",1397606400,2,531,4.267326732673268
4514196,4,B0050I2PQE,"I have delayed watching this because I can remember going to the record shop, putting on the headphones, taking them off again and complaining ""This isn't Deep Purple."" Stormbringer wasn't, either.
It's a sad testimonial to a truly great band. There can be no finger-pointing here. Ritchie leaves after Stormbringer to make the dull Rainbow album. The band, Lord and Paice, struggle on and the rest is history.
This document is a face-dipping into utter misery. Glenn Hughes looks and sounds like he never came off the trip he loudly declaims. On the other hand, the more sober Jon Lord has some more interesting points to make.
What if he HAD left with Ritchie after Stormbringer?
I saw Deep Purple at the Lewisham Odeon in 1974. Hat-wearing Ritchie stayed entirely to the right-hand side of the stage. Shapes of things to come...
So why do I give this four stars? It's because of the comments, mostly Jon Lord's, that reveal such insight into this band's workings.
For what it's worth, I saw this line-up at Wembley in 1976. I remember it for Coverdale saying ""Ian Gillan, he's not here"" after the audience yelled for Child in Time; I remember it for Tommy Bolin breaking a string in the middle of a solo and getting booed; I remember a miserable experience.

The concert footage is pretty bad by today's standards, but it is fun to watch. The documentary is fantastic. It's nice to hear Glenn Hughes and Jon Lord (may God rest his soul) tell first hand accounts of the various tribulations that the band went through.

4514199,3,B0050I2PQE,"This concert video is from the Tommy Bolin era of Deep Purple, which was a much less aggressive version of the band once the pressure of playing with the super uptight Ritchie Blackmore was relieved. Unfortunately at this point, Tommy's drug addictions had started compromising his otherwise excellent guitar playing. The pressure of trying to play Blackmore's parts was apparent on the more classic Purple, but Tommy otherwise was much more competent playing material from Come Taste The Band which was obviously his own jazz inspired style. Unfortunately the concert footage is only just under an hour, but it's just as well for the reasons listed above.

As far as the extra features, if you enjoy watching obviously stoned, aging rockers (primarily Glenn Hughs, to a lesser extent the late Jon Lord) reminiscing about their drug-laden past exploits (it's normal to snort coke off a hooker's butt, right Glenn?), then you are in for a treat!
