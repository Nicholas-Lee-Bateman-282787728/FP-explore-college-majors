8251566,5,B0013KLWXK,The students really like this movie. The other Science teacher and I show the movie in four days usually the last 20 minutes of the period with a set of questionns that we prepared for the students to answer during the Evolution chapter. Highly recommended! Just a little scene that I skip for my students because of mating between lizards.,1435968000,,340,4.683333333333334
8251567,5,B0013KLWXK,Very interesting especially if you are amazed by the history of life on planet earth.  Clearly presented picture of animal life forms that inhabited the planet very early on which have tended to be overshadowed by the story of the dinosaurs.,1434412800,,241,4.878048780487805
8251568,4,B0013KLWXK,"This is another documentary from Discovery concerning prehistoric life. Through computers and models, the production team have given us a look into the life of creatures we will never see outside of a TV screen. Thorough the magic of the storytelling and animatronics, long extinct creatures are brought to life again. This DVD covers non vertabrates, as well as early reptiles and amphibians. The envirement of that time is also re created, so we can see what is no longer viewable in our times.",1363392000,,496,4.916666666666667
8251569,2,B0013KLWXK,"The CGI looks very good to my untrained eye, but I quarrel with the science. No consultants are cited, and I have to seriously wonder whether the fact that Cephalaspis fossils are found both in fresh and salt water can lead to the conclusion that they were anadromous like modern salmon and were hunted above water by their arch-enemies, the giant scorpions.

The film abounds with these nature-program-you-are-there dramatics, but behavior in animals extinct for millions of years must be labelled 'conjecture'. It wasn't. It was sold as 'just-so' by the CGI.
You could almost hear the producer saying, ""Where's the conflict???"", to the writer. And, ""We gotta find some humor here."" Enter the burrowing animals from Permian Mongolia.

Oh, and the stones in the stomach of some extinct herbivores are called gastroliths, not gasterpods.

Still, the giant scorpions were very cool. The film would have benefited from an inclusion of the earlier Ediacaran fauna...before there were predators as we know them.",1228003200,,1006,5.197530864197531
8251570,5,B0013KLWXK,"Before the Dinosaurs takes you back to a time when life first emerged from the oceans, to the first reptile predator. The CGI in this one is utterly fantastic, with little details of realism,(such as water splashing on the camera lens, or a creature's hot breath fogging up the screen!)  Yes, I think this is the best one of Discovery Classics so far.  This DVD would be good for the little paleontologist in your family, but it's not produced as a kiddie educational film.  There are great visuals, and it tells a great story that would be highly entertaining for young and not so young alike.",1219363200,5,594,4.584905660377358
