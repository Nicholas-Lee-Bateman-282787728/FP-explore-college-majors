8364107,2,B002CK595C,"I would purchase DVD and training if he had better examples.
He mentions professional and medical, yet all the examples are just dictated in Microsoft Word.
That is not helpful. Base Dragon can do that. Heck even Windows 7 can do that, for free!
If he had access to a popular EMR, used by many medical pros, such as EPIC, running in Citrix Receiver, and showing macros, and delayed edit, now we're talking. He would probably sell thousands of copies if he addressed just that single specific market for a lot of medical professionals who 'sink or swim' as he describes.
Free advice from someone who is too lazy to take advantage of a market opportunity.",1351382400,,653,4.637931034482759
8364108,5,B002CK595C,"Jim has really helped me progress using Dragon! Without a doubt, MOST new software is difficult to learn and thus most times dropped or used infrequently by the user!

Jim helped guide me thru the intital painful steps in using/learning Dragon thru these teaching DVD's which are easy to understand. In addition, I followed that up w/ Personal Telephone training which can be customized individually based on the customer's needs and wants. He even helped me to learn Word basics. These DVD's are invaluable if you want to use Dragon. Definately a thumbs up!

8364109,5,B002CK595C,"This updated version of the SpeakEASY DVD 11 into the Professional version is completely amazing!  The SpeakEASY DVD 11 is the basic training video.  It provides an easy-to-understand flow of how to use Dragon NaturallySpeaking 11 from using the microphone properly to understanding the importance of the vocabulary editor.  Learn more about the basic training program by doing a search on SpeakEASY DVD in the Amazon search box. It costs $99.

But for only $30 more than the SpeakEASY DVD 11 is the SpeakEASY Professional 11.  This program provides the same video as in the SpeakEASY DVD 11 but with tons more value.  The SpeakEASY Professional 11 should be priced over $250.  The SpeakEASY Professional 11 includes a whole set of custom macros which are efficiency commands for helping with formatting, deleting, using MS Word menus and more.  Then there is a video on how to install, understand and use those custom macros.  There is a CheatSheet in PDF so the user knows what commands are available.  Then there is also a video on how to create your own custom macros!  With lots of examples and with easy-to-follow screen shots the program shows how any Dragon Professional, Medical or Legal user could create their own custom macros.  There are also two PDF booklets included, one is called QuickMacros which provides a written form to creating macros.  This is a super valuable training tool for anyone who wants to tap into the power of Dragon NaturallySpeaking.

Disclaimer:  I am the creator of the program.  The SpeakEASY Professional 11 should only be purchased for those who have Dragon NaturallySpeaking Professional, Medical or Legal 11.",1317340800,2,1652,5.018382352941177
8364110,1,B002CK595C,"This perhaps is one of the greatest deceptions of this DECADE. I have 2 of these. What they DO NOT TELL YOU is this:

A. If this thing is SO user friendly.....then why are they now promoting ""Teaching Techniques"" for such a ""simple"" product???
B. It would be easier to raise the Titanic with a snorkel and finns than to get any kind of ""technical help"" from this company. The ONLY time you get to talk to a REAL PERSON is when you buy and that's it. THEY ARE SIMPLY LYING ABOUT WHAT THEIR PRODUCT CAN AND CANNOT DO.
C.Did you know that if you buy a PC within the last 5 years IT ALREADY COMES WITH SIMILAR SOFTWARE ON IT FOR FREE????
READ THE FINEPRINT ON THIS PEICE OF #*&%! before spending $1 on it.",1301788800,,701,4.154411764705882

It is easy to follow and to understand.  The additional files (QuickNotes.pdf, QuickMacros.pdf, cheatsheet.doc, cheatsheet.rtf) were unexpected bonuses.  Those bonus files alone were worth the purchase price.  It is easy to understand why three different vendor websites list this DVD.
