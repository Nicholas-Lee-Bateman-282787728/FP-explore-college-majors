I seldom watch movies more than once in a short period of time, but this one I watched twice, and enjoyed it just as well the second time as the first.  The first time I watched it was at dramafever online and then I ordered it so I could own it.  The copy I ordered did not play through, so I returned it and watched it a second time at dramafever.",1393372800,2,450,4.137931034482759
8198783,4,B000R4HDVI,"I must say I was very surprised at how good this Korean crime/cop movie was. I was not sure what to expect when I ordered it as there is only one other review of it on Amazon. It was originally produced in 2006. It's very exciting from the beginning to the end with lots of martial arts style fighting and over the top action. A criminal is arrested and charged with murder which he claims he did not commit. He eats plastic plates while in jail and is taken to the hospital for surgery where he manages to escape. He takes a homicide detective hostage but then the two team up to find out who really did the murder the criminal was originally charged with. Gang members and the police are hot on their trail for the rest of the movie. The acting is good, the plot is different and the cinematography is probably just a tad above average. For the price you really can't go wrong with this DVD. I enjoyed it a lot and give it a definite 4 stars. The Audio is in Korean with the English subtitles already on there, so there's no need to try to set up the subtitles.",1337126400,4,1063,4.190243902439025

fantastic martial arts, fantastic story line, okay maybe not fantastic story line, it is however a typical action flick, with a grain of salt and no real expectations, this film will entertain as well as surprise you, it is a fantastic film.",1243900800,5,353,4.363636363636363
