8088614,5,B000BLI190,"I first saw this film in a theatre in Munich while I was statlioned there in the Army (1972).  It was stunning.  Years later, it was shown on the A&E channel (about 1992).  Since then, I have tried to track it down on VHS or DVD, but no luck (I want it NTSC with English subtitles as I do not speak French).  About five years ago, Costa Gravas was interviewed and he stated that its anti-communist message was not welcome in Hollywood, and that the film was being repressed.  A bit of research that I did brings out the fact that the film is based on the experiences of Rudolph Slansky, and it is quite accurate as to Stalinist methods of repression.  As a movie, it cannot qualify as ""entertainment;"" just too gripping and horrifying.  It has been compared to the quasi-novel, ""Darkness at Noon,"" which was loosely based on the tragedy of N. Bukharin's liquidatilon by Stalin in the 1930's.",1245024000,6,891,4.496894409937888
8088615,5,B000BLI190,"L' aveau is a manifesto; a historical truth and powerful allegation that claimed by being known. It spans historically since Benel a pro-Soviet , Gottwald (1946) until Novorny (1953-1968)

The film carves in relief the horror of the political purges masked under the sophisticated term. ""special People's Courts"" in which the wrought confessions behind stage being the accused forced to memorize them, word after word.

The movie begins with the expected detention of the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, and the well detailed process of horrid reconstruction of the sinister and abominable methods of psychological oppression, the prisoner is forced to walk hours and hours, obligated over and over to repeat his code number, obligated to wake up just minutes after his deserved right to sleep, and obligated to confess after a very unpleasant bucket of cold water, in order to get the gradual mental and physical crumbling of the presumed implied.

Our main personage is released in 1958, so he decides the e4xile to publish a book, telling the whole truth of the abuses false testimonies and nasty methods of deformed legality, including the executions of many colleagues who worked with him in the same ministerial cabinet.

But when the wisdom experience defies all the recommendable prudence (the vice of the old people) and returns to his beloved Czech Republic in 1968 the same day of the Russian besiege.

Only the courageous of Costa Gavras supported on a zealous and well elaborated script of Jorge Semprum made possible this bold and brave testimonial for all those who still believe in mermaid's song or pregnant birdies of the Socialist utopia

One of the most memorable performance of Yves Montand's prestigious career; as well as Simone Signoret as his beloved wife in the film (and in the real life). Claustrophobic environment, superbly directed by Costa - Gavras. .",1189468800,8,1885,5.1237785016286646
8088616,5,B000BLI190,"Grim drama starring Yves Montand in a depiction of a victim of the 1951 Prague Trials.

The pointlessness and cruelty of Stalinist ideological repression gets a good airing here.  The victims are all stout communists, but are made to confess to fabricated charges.  This was to crush any hint of independence in the satellite republics, the better for Stalin to keep them at heel after Iosip Tito's break with the Soviet Union.  During his interrogation, Montand's character is made to wear rope sandals and pace, confessing all the while.  He sneaks in a rest after his interrogator nods off.  There's also a bit of Stockholm syndrome, when the prisoners, just before their show trials start, anxiously ask where their interrogators have gone.

It ends with Montand's character walking in a state of shock in the streets of Prague in 1968, witnessing the Soviet crackdown on the Prague Spring.

This film's continuing unavailability in the U.S. is a crying gap in Montand's released filmography, as well as in the thin shelf of serious anti-communist films.  (I know, this is supposed to be only anti-totalitarian in a general sense, really just a bookend to ""Z"", but I'll take whatever anti-communism I can get from the film industry.)  One can only hope that it will receive a big studio re-release some day soon.",1129075200,14,1316,4.9409090909090905
