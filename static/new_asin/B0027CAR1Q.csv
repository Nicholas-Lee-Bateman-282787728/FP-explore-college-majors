3864125,5,B0027CAR1Q,"I've been a fan of this opera for more than 40 years and even put together a performance of the Prologue while a graduate student. I've seen a number of live performances, and own many CDs and DVDs of performances dating back to the 1960s.

This version is stunning in terms of the singing and the production. First, they got all the voice parts as Monteverdi had intended: Nero is a mezzo, Ottone is a countertenor, and the two nurses are travesty roles (here, sung and acted by men). Emmanuelle Ham is a gem as music director. I've been a fan of hers since her recording of the Handel ""Delirio"" Cantata with Natalie Dessay.

The performance of the singers and the orchestra is of the highest quality, the scholarship is first-rate, and both the staging and music direction are imaginative and fun! Here's an opera where evil triumphs over good, and the audience leaves smiling. Highly recommended.",1253750400,34,899,4.719745222929936
3864126,5,B0027CAR1Q,"Claudio Monteverdi was in the final year of his life when this brilliant amoral operatic masterpiece was first presented in the city of intrigue, Venice. With what may have been intended as ironic commentary on the state of Europe's ruling aristocracy in 1643, Monteverdi concentrates his genius on the opera's two most loathsome creations - Poppea and Nerone - as the severely flawed central characters. Although we are initially presented with a contest between the mythological characters Virtue, Fortune and Love, this is merely the opera's 'MacGuffin': Hitchcock's phrase for a malleable plot device that facilitates the telling of a story. L'incoronazione di Poppea, despite its surface obeisance to the world of myth, is an opera with a human heartbeat. The corrupt humans who infest this Baroque equivalent of a Hollywood action film are essentially evil, selfish and disturbingly goal-oriented. But what rings most modern in this production is that we identify completely with its odious central characters. We applaud their most depraved actions and revel in their final success. It is like the WWF with recitatives.

Glyndebourne's modern dress production stars the beautiful and seductive Danielle de Niese as the beautiful and seductive Poppea. Following her stunning debut in Glyndebourne's production of Handel's Julius Caesar, those of us who predicted stardom for the young singer were hardly crawling out on a limb. It has come to pass, of course, and the very qualities that have raised her high in the operatic firmament are all present on this two DVD set. Her melliform voice is lyrical and resonant, with a marvelous ability to convey emotion without attracting attention to her underlaying technique. Her engrossing stage presence acts as an adjunct to her singing, conveying a three dimensional characterization in her role that heightens the opera's ironic drama. As her actions become increasingly cynical and as her life is threatened by those who plot against her, we as a modern audience used to indeterminate morality identify with her plight and applaud her ultimate success. Whether a Baroque audience responded in the same way is an open question.

Alice Coote singing Nerone is suitably unpleasant. We don't identify with her but we admire her ability to remain so untroubled by evil. Athough the interaction between Nerone and Poppea didn't strike me as particularly erotically charged, they make excellent plotters and the drama is well served. Coote's singing is good though she occasionally struck me as a little bland. The rest of the cast is good. Especially strong is Dominique Visse as Nutrice. Emmanuelle Haim is a superb Baroque conductor and she does an especially good job conducting the splendid Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, still my favorite name for a band.

The modern production and set design is rather spare. The first act is confined to crimson colored bedchambers and the rest of the opera occurs mostly on a bare stage with few props. It is Monteverdi's brilliant music that carries the day and here it is well sung and acted. The moral ambiguity of this opera makes it relevant, the composer's artistry makes it enjoyable. With Danielle de Niese's undeniable star power as an added incentive this production of Monteverdi's somewhat problematic opera (much of the last scene was probably completed by Francisco Cavilli) is worth adding to your Baroque opera collection. The sound both in stereo PCM and DTS 5.1 is superb as is the high definition video. The opera is spread across two DVDs and it should have fit on one but this practice is now fairly common as recording companies attempt to recoup (or maximize) their investment (or profits).

in  The Enchanted Isle. Her performance here is likewise of top caliber, but I have deep
reservations about the overall conception of the production. You may call me a hopeless
traditionalist, and I plead guilty. But fidelity to the performance style of the period  from

8354477,3,B0027CAR1Q,"I have been challenged with providing a fair rating of modern opera productions.  I have often found the singing and acting excellent but the production itself questionable.  I have no inherent objection to a modern setting with the exception that rarely performed operas deserve to be immortalized in the setting and style the composer and librettist intended.  I believe this is a duty for the art world because these productions are now digitally eternal and, in time, the producer's interpretation will back out the original.

Perhaps all this is driven to bring people back to the opera.  Opera is expensive and minimalist settings are more affordable and often quite appropriate especially in older works where the audience was required to use their imagination and knowledge of the events and characters portrayed in the opera.  However, I am seeing shock factor, especially of the sexual nature, that is being used like a cheap Hollywood sex scene.  Is this what opera has come to?

The notes accompanying the opera make a compelling case for the staging and ""acted"" drama evidently not portrayed in the original intent.  Citing the social, political and religious milieu in which the opera was staged the producers see fit to complete the fate of many of the historical characters.  Though historically correct their deaths are telescoped by time back into the action of the opera.  I can accept this interpretation given the explanation provided.

It is no mystery that the composer's intentions is to turn virtue on its head wherein lust, greed and all things evil are distorted and rewarded while what little true virtue (and there is little if any - save perhaps Seneca) is punished.  All of the characters display a degree of lust, selfishness, covetousness, vileness and a dark, violent heart.  There is no hero in this opera.

Nero is obviously the most perverse and as history well records he out perverted the horrid society surrounding him.  I must say that the producers succeed in putting on full display the sexual and violent perversions of this time.  Little is left to the imagination as blood flows freely and collects into the center of the stage that resembles the plate my sushi was served on last night.  Fortunately I ate last night.  But there is a point to the blood letting and demonstration as a counterpoint to any impression that Poppea and Nero are heroes to live happily ever after.  Indeed, the parts of the libretto where the virtues and possibilities of moving up in society, of Nero welcoming Poppea into the royal world, as his hand sweeps over the stage, blood draining into the center and the dead strewn around the concave-like white dish is poignant and drives the message home.  But you must wait till the end.

The overt sexual gyrations, heterosexual and homosexual, were excessive and unnecessary.  Nero and Rome's sexual depravity are well documented and do not have to be put on vulgar display in an opera house.  I was embarrassed when my daughter came in and was thankful she did not see these things.  The producer can argue that such perversions are historically accurate and necessary to bring out the fullness of the story.  I say otherwise.

When such sexual perversion and even violence is displayed so graphically one alienates the audience from imaginatively interacting with the opera.  It becomes a monolog and not a dialog.  In the latter the audience is engaged with their mind and heart, taking in the words and music and the action in a way the formulates in their mind a creative process of its own.  When things are so plain and graphic they shock, take over the production and suppress the audience's engagement thus producing a one way communication.  This is the great error in this production.

In the end I came away insulted that the producer thought so little of me that I lacked the resources to imagine the evil and irony in this historic work.  Surely, it requires work - a little research, reading the notes, having a basic working knowledge of history and a correct moral compass.

Sadly, art tends to reflect the society in which it is created.  This production was from Northern Europe.  It can be fairly argued that the milieu in which this production was created is a modern version of Rome with the excesses of Nero.  If the intent was to awaken the moral consciences of the people attending the performance then one can argue some value.  However, I doubt this was the case.  Hence the lukewarm reception and puzzled looks I saw on the faces of the audience.

I would like to see a production of this opera wherein the full message can be brought out and not drowned in graphic excess.

And sadly, such antics will eventually fail to revive opera but rather be its death.  Hollywood does a much better job exploiting sex and violence for monetary gain while calling it ""art.""  The opera should remain apart, a bastion of true art in a world that is continually being bombarded by graphic images of sex, violence, crime, drugs etc.",1418428800,,5020,4.82903981264637
8354478,5,B0027CAR1Q,"Once again a review of mine seems to have disappeared - this time three years after the fact.  Let's try this again.  (Warning . . . long review follows!)

When Robert Carsen's new production of Monteverdi's final masterpiece ""L'incoronazione di Poppea"" opened at Glyndebourne last June, critical opinions were being thrown out fast and furious, each critic seemingly trying to outdo the next in a race to either laud or loathe the thing. Early on, Carsen had made no bones about, nor attempt to hide, how he and his production team were creating a Poppea ""specifically for Glyndebourne"" - and some critics took umbrage with it, variously accusing the director of ""navel gazing"" - ""appealing to the lowest common denominator"" and creating something worthy of no more than a ""yawn and sneer at."" These critics were, if not all morons, at least moronic in reducing such a fiercely integrated, well thought out production into something too casually dismissed as unworthy of their time. Such reviews are worthy of less than a yawn or a sneer, for they, ultimately tell us nothing than we could have gleaned on our own by the headline (which often they didn't write in the first place). This new 2 DVD set from London (attractively priced around $20-$30) is more than worth the price of admission and allows the home viewer a glimpse into what the controversy was all about (plus several interesting extras, including interviews with some of the cast, Mr. Carsen and an appreciation of Maestro Leppard by Ms. Haim).

So, is this new Poppea perfect? Nope, but that doesn't matter. Michael Levine's set was, for the most part, little more than miles and miles of red velvet drapery, covering nearly every square inch of the stage - at times even the floor - grew a mite wearisome and unrelenting. Carsen's usage of it seemed predicated on several ""wow"" type of special effects, but I think (strongly) that the ""wow"" factor could be achieved, even more so by relieving our eyes of his perpetual crimson tide. Having said that, nearly every other aspect of this show bordered on the revelatory (and so in hindsight my complaint of ""seeing too much red"" - is somehow soften or diffused), giving us lots of meat to chew on in a tale most of us think we know well.

In the title role, opera's latest ""It Girl,"" Danielle de Niese came under much fire for less than glamorous vocalism. Personally, I found her Poppea to be so well thought out, so uniformly excellent and complete that any vocal shortcomings (e.g., a wispiness/breathiness in the lower range) excellently employed into her assumption of the aspiring empress. She breathes a certain life into this woman and becomes a Poppea that is, for all her manipulative ways and ambition, the most vulnerable creature of the opera - which is a first for me. By her coronation scene and the final duet, de Niese's face and body language register a woman who has made a long journey mostly of her own devising - and yet who appears fraught with terror at what should happen next, leaving the audience (or at least me) sympathetic to her plight.

The performance of the night (next to Maestra Haim) belongs to Alice Coote. She (and Carsen) have saddled this Nerone with a dangerous edge I've never witnessed in a female Nero before . Only Richard Croft (in the excellent, if chopped up production for the 1993 Schwetzinger Festival) has the same swaggering menace and sense of complete abandon of morals or care. Coote goes him one better in her handling of the last scene with Druisilla and Ottone, which here in Carsen's hands plays out with a near Shakespearean theatrical quality.

Coote makes a terrifying Nero: her eyes as shifty as a feral cat, her body language a nearly amorphous assumption of androgyny - alternating a faux butchness that belies her sex one moment, and then going all alpha male on us the next. Her turn as Nerone is so complete, so fully integrated into a wholly believable character that in many reviews her vocalism went nearly unmentioned. It should not as the evening's highest vocal honors are all hers. The voice is an amazingly beautiful one with an evenness throughout the ranges - capable of sending out a barely audible ""che . . . che"" one minute and full-throated, glorious singing, employing all manner of vocal tricks and tossing off difficult coloratura as though it were nothing at all. This is a Nero both conceived and executed with brilliance and Coote is amply rewarded at her curtain.

Tenor Andrew Tortoise beautifully captures both Lucan's infatuation and nervous misgiving of his leader. The love scene between the two - beginning with words celebrating Seneca's death - offers some of the score's most beautiful music. Carsen, however, has cooked up something new and grim for us here as homoeroticism turns terrifying and deadly, Nerone's cronies drugging the poet, stripping him and placing him into a tub where he's joined by Coote's fully clothed, wild-eyed and insatiable Emperor. It all plays out with a graphic horror that had me squirming and barely able to watch - no longer fun or erotic but rather dangerous and threatening. Some (plenty actually) might (and will) object to such dramatic license - but I found it made for gripping, intense theatre.

Paolo Battaglia brings an oddly wooly - yet ultimately gorgeous sound, as well as a sincerity and nobility to Seneca and his scene with his disciples begging him to reconsider his suicide, makes for sensational, and gripping theatre. (I disagree with the decision, however, to have him die offstage.)

It's tough to single out the ""drag"" performers here, but pride-of-place probably goes down to Wolfgang Ablinger-Sperrhacke's delightfully absurd - and yet ultimately moving, Arnalta (also the only cast member to receive applause during the actual performance). Dominique Visse cannot be left out either, as his nurse/smartly turned out as more of a secretary/aide - provides genuine comic relief being both goofy and elegant.

Christophe Dumaux (who as Tolomeo stole every scene in the Giulio Cesare three years earlier) is less enthralling as Ottone, though his scene following Nero's forgiveness is, fittingly, moving.

Tamara Mumford is given the thankless(?) task of turning Ottavia (usually the most sympathetic character in the opera) into a bitter, vengeful shrew. She does it well, though I felt the odd staging of the usually powerful ""Addio Roma"" (sung quietly in front of the slumbering Poppea and Nerone) shifted the drama in the wrong direction, ultimately reducing one of the opera's most powerful scenes of conflict and emotion, to a mere ""number.""

Marie Arnet shows off a voice of remarkable beauty (I kept thinking what a fine Poppea she might make herself) is radiant, racy and ultimately a most potent presence as Drusilla.

In an interesting stroke, Carsen has the drama play out all as a story told by Amore, who raises the curtains, turns out the lights, and essentially runs the show. He is delightfully played by Amy Freston in a (surprise) blood red suit, that makes her both cupid and devil - the perky soprano making the most of both.

When the production opened, I found I was rather amazed by how many critics complained about the pared down orchestration and openly pined for the days of Leppard's ""vulgar excesses"" which once employed the whole of the London Philharmonic, several even calling the contributions of The Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment ""thin gruel"" (or worse). I'll take it both ways, thank you very much. Personally, I adored Maestro Leppard's fleshing out of Monteverdi's bare-as-bones scores, and it is to him we principally owe the debt of gratitude for resurrecting some of the earliest - and most important - contributions to the lyric stage. Nonetheless, for this production I found Emmanuelle Haim's sparkling with a life and energy I don't think I've ever before quite witnessed.

The vast array of sounds emanating from the pit were alternately spare and full, wistful and harrowing, and making some of Monteverdi's strange harmonies sound so modern they could still be waiting for the ink to dry. Haim is absolutely in love with this score, and goes at it hammer and tongs, playing the harpsichord herself. She also has a little fun giving us her own fashion show, appearing in a different gown and hairstyle for each act.

All told, Carsen and his team give us a fresh, unflinching new look at one of opera's oldest hits - and that is, in my opinion, always cause for celebration.",1339545600,5,8499,4.8991655076495135
8354479,5,B0027CAR1Q,"For all the wonders of this DVD of production of Monteverdi's L'incoronazione de Poppea - and they  are plentiful - there is a hidden treasure in this performance.  Not that the other reasons of purchasing this DVD are unworthy - quite the opposite.  Beginning with the extraordinary conducting of Emmanuelle Ham who brings her intuitive musicality to the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment and a cast that is close to perfect, and continuing to the staging concept of Robert Carsen's contemporary style of sets and costumes and sets and direction, this is a Monteverdi opera performance for the ages.

Danielle De Niese is resplendent as Poppea and her portrayal of this strange character is perfectly balanced by the Nero of Alice Coote.  Their singing is involving as well as perfectly compatible with the flavor of the drama and the writing of Monteverdi.  The beautiful and enormously gift Emmanuelle Ham proves once again that in this repertoire she is queen.  The cast of supporting singers is excellent but the unrevealed secret is the discovery of the extraordinary singing actress Sonya Yoncheva in the relatively small role of Fortune.  She is still very young and very beautiful and will likely become the next great star of the opera.  She is currently performing with the Los Angeles Philharmonic under the guest direction of Emmanuelle Ham singing the Handel 'Il delirio amoroso': given the center stage opportunity to display every aspect of her gifts - a combination of physical beauty, magnetic stage presence, and a glorious soprano voice that fills the hall with complete ease - she simply has it all.  Perhaps that is the reason so many of us in attendance stood in line at the gift sop to buy this luminous DVD souvenir of Monteverdi, Emmanuelle Ham, AND Sonya Yoncheva.  Watch her rise!

8354481,5,B0027CAR1Q,"""L'Incoronazione di Poppea"" is an outrageous piece of work! The libretto by Francesco Busanello is morally ambiguous, as cynical as Machiavelli's 'The Prince' or as Webster's 'The White Duchess'. The music, by Monteverdi/Cavalli, is coyly lascivious throughout. Libretto and music combine seamlessly in an opera of shockingly 'modern' sensibilities, a tale of unbridled lust and cruelty, darker than ""Lulu"" or ""Lady Macbeth of Mtensk"", without the slightest whisper of sanctity though it was composed at the apogee of the Catholic Counterreformation in Italy. The 'lovers' are the tyrant Nero and the beautiful 'commoner' Poppea. Nero's misdeeds are famous enough so that even 21st C Americans remember him as the vilest of the vile, the mad perverted sadist who 'fiddled' while Rome burned. In this opera, dramatized within the classical unity of a single day, Nero orders the suicide-death of his previous favorite, the philosopher Seneca; repudiates his wife Ottavia and sends her afloat in a ship without a rudder; and elevates Poppea to the 'throne' of the Empire. Opera-goers in 1643 would have known, unquestionably, a good deal more of the history; they would have known that Nero stomped Poppea to death after a matter of months; they would have been aware of Seneca's sycophancy and yet have revered him as an ethical philosopher; they would have recalled that Ottone, Poppea's previous lover, survived Nero to become, however briefly, his successor as Emperor. In short, an audience of 1643 would have had every reason to be even more shocked by this opera than we blissfully naive music-lovers of today, for whom it's really just the music that matters. Were they then properly outraged by the 'triumph' of Love over Virtue in Busanello's drama, or were they cynically receptive to evil in high places?

This 2008 Glyndebourne production of L'Incoronazione is suitably outrageous. Unlike various stagings which depict Poppea sympathetically, the portrayal of Poppea by Danielle de Niese is of a cold-hearted sexual adventuress, one who WILL get what she wants... and deserves. Nero is a sadistic sociopath, and Alice Coote is, I think, the first singer/actress to make his perversity totally plausible. There are moments in this production, as there should be, when Poppea and Nero each betray their true feelings, where Poppea's sensuality is exposed as false, where Nero's paranoid cruelty displays itself to her, where each of these conscienceless manipulators lets her/his mask slip, to reveal the dangerous game they are playing. Alice Coote's subtle portrayal of Nero sets this production apart, dramatically, from any other I've seen; she is a convincing Nero, an odious beast. Danielle de Niese's Poppea is likewise dramatically several notches above any other I've seen; she is a sexual predator. Thus there's tension -- drama! -- in their passion; the opera is a struggle between two 'principals' for dominance.

Nerone and Poppea do dominate this staging, but the secondary 'tragedies' of Seneca's suicide and Ottavia's downfall are also made vivid by fine acting, particularly by basso Paolo Battaglia as the philosopher. Seneca's advice to Nero, about public morality, and his stoic acceptance of Death, embracing it as a deliverance to a higher realm, MUST be portrayed with sublimity. Seneca may have been a courtier but he is not a clown. His voice is the counterweight of Busanello's drama; he is, after all, the chosen favorite of Athena, the Goddess of Wisdom, as proclaimed by Mercury. The smile on Paolo Battaglia's face as Seneca consoles his disciples, before his death, is Oscar-worthy.

There's another counterweight in Busanello's script. It's 'low' comedy: the two old-lady nurses, acted by two aging men in drag; the sarcastic young Valletto; the disaffected soldiers guarding Nero's tryst with Poppea while the Empire goes to the dogs. Every passionate scene in the drama is countered with scurrilous satire. It's the grave flaw in the famous Harnoncourt/Ponnelle production, the pioneering revival of three decades ago, that passion and comedy are not effectively juxtaposed; in Ponnelle's opulent costume staging, Nero is a gaping goofball and all passion is reduced to absurdity. Such is not the case here. Nero and Poppea are deadly serious in their dire affairs. Their lust is no laughing matter, and the ecstasy of their triumphant 'union', expressed in their sublimely beautiful duet at the end of the drama, has to be done 'straight'. Otherwise, our implicit awareness of the transitory nature of their passion and of ever-fickle Love is irrelevant.

Glyndebourne gives us this electrifying drama without much visual ""distraction'. The stage is nearly bare throughout -- just a backdrop of scarlet plush curtains -- and the modern costumes are nothing one couldn't buy at a local department store. There's a plethora of lingerie, of languid bedroom behavior, of crotch-rubbing and such. One of Nero's guards 'urinates' against the curtain. Nero sadistically murders the poet Lucan, with the help of his henchman, by drowning him in a bathtub after a scene implying a homoerotic relationship. That's an 'outrageous' interpolation in the libretto, not an interpretation supported by any previous performances. In short, this staging is boldly 'outrageous' -- precisely what conservative opera-goers in the USA deride as ""Euro-trash"". Right as rain, there is a previous amazon one-star reviewer who expresses that judgment.

But if there is any plausible ground for outrage, to my mind it's not the staging, which is brilliantly coherent and effective. It's the 'liberty' that the singers and the orchestra take with Monteverdi's music that at times seems outrageous.  All the singers, but especially Danielle de Niese, stretch and squeeze their phrasings, bend their pitches, wrench their timbres, in order to 'milk' the passion from their sung words, all of which in the score are essentially just ornamented recitativo over basso continuo, interspersed with instrumental ritornelli. No other recording of Poppea, on CD or DVD, makes so free with the music. No other recording prolongs the pauses, the silences after cadences, as this one does. Conductor Emmanuelle Ham is well known, by now, for her expansive approach to ""historically informed"" performance. Her style is brash and big, sometimes to the point of coarseness. In this performance, she 'exaggerates' every possible contrast. There's no denying that her interpretation of the music is deliberately subordinate to the drama of words. And it's successful on that footing. The music drives the drama of passions. Any other production of Poppea on DVD, by comparison, will seem to be merely a concert with minor visual enhancements. Whether other listeners will be pleased or outraged by Ham's manneristic musical results ... well, that's going to be a matter of taste. Personally, I wouldn't choose a CD of Ham's Monteverdi for purely musical pleasure, but I find this DVD FILM of the opera magnificent and compelling.

Given the froufra about soprano Danielle de Niese, in reviews of her performances of Handel and Mozart, I suppose I have to register some impressions. She is gorgeous, and she brings an intensity as an actress to the opera stage that 'raises the bar' for all other actress-singers. She also moves with the grace of a dancer; her physical presence is so vivacious that any 'stiffer' singers had better beware of getting painfully upstaged. Is she as good a singer as an actress? That is the question. Is her voice as beautiful as her face? I think the answer is no, though I was fully captivated by her voice in her opening scene with Nero, until I heard the next scene, with Tamara Mumford singing the role of Ottavia. Mumford's ""instrument"" - her sheer voice - was noticeably richer. Pure ""voice"" isn't the whole issue, of course. Countertenor Iestyn Davies, in the role of Ottone, uses a smallish voice with such expressive control that he holds the listener even against voices of fuller timbre. Danielle de Niese is no slouch, however, at expressive control; her vocal technique in the role of Poppea is quite adequate for the essentially 'dramatic' uses she makes of it. She's perfectly responsive to the conducting of Emmanuelle Ham, warping and stretching her phrases more to suit the words than the notation. I have to say that I enjoyed her singing, purely as musical noise, in her performance as Cleopatra in Handel's 'Giulio Cesare' at Glyndebourne. But Handel is ""all about"" entertainment - musical virtuosity - while L'Incoronazione di Poppea delves into deeper themes. I've seen every other DVD of L'Incoronazione on the market -- Harnoncourt/Ponelle, Les Talens Lyriques, Les Musiciens du Louvre, Concerto Kln under Rene Jacobs, and the older Glyndebourne with Maria Ewing as Poppea -- and I'm willing to crown de Niese as the Poppea of our lifetimes.",1285632000,10,8895,5.220433869839049

8354484,4,B0027CAR1Q,"I don't enjoy being the first voice of dissention with regards to this product; however, I have to state that as much as I loved the conducting and singing, as well as all the technical aspects of the DVD, I really disliked the production.  For me, it simply did not work.  The modernization of a work that is so entrenched in so specific a time period just came across as positively jarring.  I couldn't reconcile the text with the visual.  Costumes would suggest 1940's anywhere, a far cry from 1st century Rome.  Nerone might as well have been a captain of industry or politician rather than an emperor.  Poppea, a screen siren clad in a slinky negligee forever seducing him.  Seneca, wearing a suit and carrying a briefcase, comes across like Nerone's attorney or all around lackey.  The color red plays a very prominent role in Act One and though I understand the symbolism behind it, it grew rather tiresome after a while as did Amore's constant skulking about.  I don't question anyone's commitment because it's evident throughout and as far as singing and acting are concerned, I can't find fault with this production and the same is true of Emmanuelle Haim's conducting.  Danielle de Niese's Poppea is a sight to behold.  You can definitely understand why Nerone would utter ""I care nothing for the Senate and the People"" for the opportunity to have her as his queen.  Make no mistake, de Niese's is more than mere window dressing.  Her Poppea is a beautifully nuanced characterization; lusty, ambitious, conniving but ultimately doomed.  We know from the moment we first see her that she will stop at nothing to get what she wants, even if it means putting herself in grave danger.  Alice Coote's Nerone is also marvelously sung even if he does come across, at times, like a petulant brat determined to have his way, regardless of what it may mean to anyone else.  The rest of the cast is on par with the stars, especially Paolo Battaglia's Seneca and Tamara Mumford's Ottavia.  For a textbook example of how to ""modernize"" a work without disfiguring it, I highly recommend William Christie's ""Il Ritorno d'Ulisse in Patria"" from the Aix-en-Provence Festival.  Flawless in every respect.  To summarize:  Production: 1 star - Musicianship  - 5 stars - Audio/Video quality - 5 stars.",1260748800,23,2291,4.823076923076923
8354485,5,B0027CAR1Q,"I was fully prepared not to like this recording of Poppea. For years I have enjoyed this masterwork in the radiant production of Nikolaus Harnoncourt done with Jean-Pierre Ponelle. I feared that this ""modern"" production would be an empty and horrendous mess as the director-driven ""eurotrash"" productions of most Handel operas and all Rameau works so far done as ""modern"". What a great surprise is this Glyndebourne gem directed by Robert Carsen and conducted by Emmanuelle Haim! First the voicing is as written by Monteverdi with a Mezzo for the Nero to compliment the Soprano of Poppea. The brilliance of the final ""pur ti Miro"" duet attests to that validity. I admit understanding Alice Coote's Nero took several listenings before I appreciated her artistry here.  Rather than a gruff, supermacho tyrant, this portrayal is of a petulant wily weasel, a totally corrupt being that picts his teeth with his fingers after having snacked on Ottavia's chicken and in one of the most scarrilous scenes ever seen on stage, has Lucano drowned after a homoerotic encounter while the two of them sing of Poppea's love.
This is the last will and testament of a consummate composer and artist that had for decades provided lofty masterpieces as the 1610 Vespers and numerous choral and operatic works all attesting to man's highest values and morals. Yet this work is arguably even greater as it reflects the human race as it is rather than what it might be. Perhaps Poppea realizes this as she, in the end, wraps herself in the royal robes(or shroud) and fear is on her face.",1257984000,11,1566,4.887218045112782
