This flick takes you into Stephen's sci-fi world.  It's fun, scary and corny...but a good kind of corny.

790486,2,6304113404,"Stephen King (as every fan already knows) gave us great dramas like 'Shawshank Redemption' and other classics like 'Cujo' and 'Pet Sematary'. So how could this same writer pen this terrible story? It does show one thing...King needs to stick to novels and get as far away from the director's chair as he possibly can. Some people have put this film into the category of 'It's so bad, it's good'. I just have to say 'Its bad' and leave it at that. This story is also meant to be a comedy. Good drama writers like King should not try to write comedy. They are very different styles and serious writers can rarely write good comedy. I know that King was in the director's chair for the first time (and hopefully last time) and so it had to be a simpler story. But putting him in that chair ruined what could have been a decent drama. The idea of machines taking over is not new but it could have made a very good serious film with interesting subplots. Instead, we get trucks circling a diner. I also really wish he could try to get away from using the 'F' bomb word so often. It's sad for him to think that it adds comedy to anything or even that 'everybody' says it. Anyway, I was disappointed in it on many levels. Writing novels and directing films are two extremely different things and few people (Proved here by Stephen King) can be good at both.",1466208000,,1350,4.361111111111111

790548,4,6304113404,"Cokehead 80's acting at its finest.  Its even edited like a cokehead edited it.  You may think this is a detractor... but it actually encapsulates a section of Hollywood that somehow got things done in an era where tinseltown skidmarked on a lot of things in a post Star Wars hot MTV time.  ACDC soundtrack somehow fit it like a glove.  But is it excellent? No. Its good, very good.  Even better during an after party late at night.  And... its Rated capital freakin R.

However, his crossover into film forgets some basics - primarily humans are afraid of what they don't know.  Hence darkly lit scenes in almost every scary movie ever.  This movie is shot primarily in broad daylight with wide shots that let you see how not scary things are.  He should have called in for backup on this project because he can do great film crossovers like Creep Show 1 and 2 with George Romero, but this movie falls completely short of those great short films.

791991,4,6304113404,"This is not a good film in a traditional sense.  You have to walk into this one expecting a ride rather than a legitimately well executed story and film.  Though a lot of Steven King movies tend to benefit from the same mindset.  This is a film where it helps to expect what the film crew thought was cool and put into the movie to be the bulk of the movie.

It's a movie where cars come alive.  It's a bit like Christine, also written by Steven King.  But on a more global scale.  And more personality is given to the killer vehicles (and appliances, and pitching machines).

It's basically a zombie outbreak movie with cars.  But it's less about the survivors knickers, and more just about the evil cars who keep a group of humans live to keep fueling them up.

The movie plays out as cheesy as it sounds.  And it benefits from it.  It's just a charming and entertaining movie from start to finish.  And as I compared it to Christine earlier, I would say this movie is the polar opposite of that film adaptation.  There's no creepy stalker element or tension to it.  Just angry looking and sounding motor vehicles terrorizing people.

And to that end it works very well.  As an entire package, the movie is an entertaining little romp.  That's all I really asked from it, and I'm happy to say that's what I got from it.",1460246400,,1321,4.366255144032922

791997,5,6304113404,"This is one of those movies that is so bad it's good.  I saw it in the theater back in 1986 and I have it on DVD.  It's based on a Stephen King short story called ""Trucks"".  It's also directed by King who makes a cameo appearance in it.  The idea is that the Earth passes through the tail of a comet which causes most of the machines (18-wheel trucks, in particular) in the world to go on a homicidal rampage.  It stars Emilio Estevez (when I first saw it I had no idea who he was but I thought he was doing a good impression of Martin Sheen - doh!, wonder why) and also has Yeardley Smith who has some of the most memorable lines (""Curtis, are ya dead?"" only she pronounces it as ""day-ed"").  Marla Maples (Donald Trump's second wife) makes a brief appearance.  It has the soda machine from hell that shoots out cans of soda at a high velocity.  It has a strange army vehicle that has a steering wheel and a machine gun mounted on a post.  The soundtrack of this film cannot be beat.  It's by AC/DC and it rocks!  Here's another review:

792198,4,6304113404,"Maximum Overdrive is still great!! It's been a good while since I sat down and watched this and I was not disappointed. AC/DC still rocks out the soundtrack to this 80's Stephen King directed and written horror film. So I always wondered how that happened. How did Stephen King, who is a writer of course, talk a studio into letting him helm a multimillion dollar project? I mean what credentials did he have for this? Obviously it was a risk that failed because the film originally flopped both financially and with audiences. Thank god for Video though as this saw a second coming and developed a fan base over the years.
The film borders on camp without being overly campy and sports some pretty good and frequent gore effects, though they all seem to be pretty quick shots. The cast of characters are fun to watch from the crazy bible sales man to the newly wed married couple. Everyone in the diner seems to have something interesting about them and that always makes for good entertainment. Some of the acting, especially the lead girl, is questionable but it doesn't really hamper the viewing.
Iv always thought that Maximum Overdrive has one of the best beginnings to a horror film. The credits rolling over the scene of the drawl bridge lifting up while cars are still on it And AC/DC's music to boot while watching the chaos, perfect!! For a one time shot, King made a flawed masterpiece of machines uprising to conquer the world asking the question, Who Made Who!",1433721600,,1474,4.673076923076923
792199,1,6304113404,"By his own admission, writer-director Stephen King was ""coked out of my mind"" during the production of this film. Maximum Overdrive was never going to be great, given King's first time behind the camera, not to mention his inability to recognize a quality adaptation of his writing (see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Shining/dp/B002VWNIDG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Shining</a>), but Maximum Overdrive is even more disjointed and stupid than I feared. The tacked-on title card--trying futilely to explain that the entire plot was in reality an attempt by an alien race to take over our planet...WHAT?!--is just one example of the horribleness.

Emilio Estevez is watchable because he has natural machismo, but this ain't Breakfast Club, and Stephen King ain't no John Carpenter. Maximum Overdrive offers a maximum overdose of stupid plot and bad acting. Ironically, the high point occurs in the second minute, when King (in a cameo) is called an ""asshol"" by an ATM machine. Unfortunately, it's all downhill from there. The only reason to watch (or rather, listen to) the entirety of Maximum Overdrive is the AC/DC&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/soundtrack/dp/B00008WT5J/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">soundtrack</a>. 1986 also saw Queen's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Highlander/dp/B00005RYL2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Highlander</a>: a banner year for epic rock soundtracks.

Maximum Overdrive is a total turkey.

It's not ""so bad it's good"": it's worse. Nor is it campy enough to be funny on that level. Perhaps the only way to enjoy this is coked out like Stephen King.

A 28-year-delayed retrospective of Maximum Overdrive

A PROMISE IS A PROMISE.

Of course it is. Something simply IS what it is, so that much is obvious. But what is important about this oft-repeated phrase is the intrinsic meaning it conveys; an acknowledgement of obligation, an assurance of dependability, a binding vow that an expectation will be fulfilled.

But what is equally inherent to a promise is that it can be broken.

Broken, broken, broken!

Welcome, dear reader, to my rant about Maximum Overdrive.



In July of 1986, the film Maximum Overdrive, Stephen Kings directorial debut (and to date, only directorial outing) was released to a wholly deserved negative critical reaction. Featuring wooden performances, stilted dialogue, poor pacing, and plot holes large enough to drive a goblin-grilled freightliner through, the film earned nominations for 2 Golden Raspberry Awards. It was a dud.

Not bad enough to be considered infamously bad, nor good enough to be especially memorable, Maximum Overdrive should have been relegated to a completely forgettable footnote in box office history.

But time has a way of sprinkling gold dust over memories, and for some, Maximum Overdrive has been thusly graced. In later years it has attained the sparkle of a fun, schlocky 1980s era campy horror favorite with a corresponding devoted fan-base, of which I am decidedly not a member.

I do not begrudge this latter stage fandom.  A great many cult film favorites gained their infamous notoriety years after a poorly received initial release. In the case of Maximum Overdrive such fandom appears to consist of viewers younger than the initial target audience (mid 1980s R-rated viewing age) who discovered the film in yard sale VHS bins, late night cable channel filler, or online streaming video, occasionally cataloged as parody horror. In their minds Maximum Overdrive stands proudly among a class of notorious contemporaries that typify the sub-genre, perhaps due in large part to an overdose of cheesy one-liners, one-dimensional clichd characters, and a comically uninspired performance by Emilio Estevez. With these factors alone, I completely understand why fans of horror schlock have embraced Maximum Overdrive with such enthusiasm. But it is a perspective in which I simply cannot share.

Why?

Because I was there.

I was there when Stephen King himself, genius storyteller, master of horror, and director of Maximum Overdrive looked me directly in the eye and told me, PROMISED me, that it was supposed to be different. It was supposed to be better.  It was supposed to be terrifying.

He PROMISED!



By 1986, Stephen King had already made quite a name for himself. (Actually two names, but whos counting?) Having enjoyed a string of literary knockouts for well over a decade, as well as a number of wildly successful film and television adaptations, any opinion that King would offer regarding the horror film genre in general, or about his adapted works in particular was sure to garner attention.

But things were different then. We didn't have the always-on internet treasure trove of perpetual information, feeding us layers-deep analysis of every topic imaginable  and certainly no dynamic, openly accessible digital databases through which film fans could track every detail of filmmaking from pre-production to opening night reviews. During the 80s most fans of Stephen King had never seen, nor knew anything more about him than what was provided in the author bios at the back of his books. The most personal connections that most of Kings readers felt were developed through the Introductions and Authors Notes with which he would frequently bookend his novels, detailing his creative process, or describing events of his life that may have contributed to, or otherwise inspired the events of that story, and always, ALWAYS thanking the reader for having taken the time to invest in the life stories of his beloved characters.

There was a connection there. It stemmed directly from the most notable characteristic of Kings own novels. He understood people, and he wrote about their most heartfelt personal struggles. Sure there was blood, gore, savage violence, fear and screaming, but at the heart of his stories you could always find people.trying to come to grips with challenges inherent in the human condition; isolation, self doubt, betrayal, regret, oppression, depression, a sense of purpose, longing and belonging. Through their experiences Kings protagonists and antagonists would grow and evolve, or sometimes devolve through their character arcs. Even if these crucial elements were couched in narratives of demonically possessed cars, evil curses, vampires and werewolves, or even telekinetic combustion, Kings stories were written in such a way as to compel readers to understand, and even empathize with the characters. For devoted fans each book became a symbol of trust between author and reader. And it was with that trust that Stephen King finally stepped in front of a camera to address his fans directly, and more personally.

Early in 1986, several months before the July release of Maximum Overdrive, I sat in a darkened theater awaiting the feature presentation when the curtains parted and the screen lit up with a preview of coming attractions. Although I am sure several such attractions were presented, only one of them still sticks in my memory to this day;

Against a darkened background stands a silhouetted figure who steps into the light and announces himself.

Hi, my name is Stephen King.

This becomes the very first representation of a moving, speaking, living Stephen King that most of his fans will have ever seen. He explains that he is there to introduce you to his new film, his first directorial effort. Its called Maximum Overdrive.

And then he lays down the gauntlet.

A lot of people have directed Stephen King novels and stories, he says.
and I finally decided if you want something done right, you ought to do it yourself.

Woah..wait..what?

Did I just hear Stephen King, the HORROR MASTER HIMSELF, throw those other Stephen King films straight into the crapper? Films that up to that time included undisputed classics like Carrie, The Shining and the groundbreaking television mini-series Salems Lot? Or even the less well known, but still highly lauded Christine or The Dead Zone?

Wow. Those are fighting words.

I just wanted someone to do Stephen King right. he added for clarification. Which is to say that with regards to previous Stephen King films, directed by the likes of Stanley Kubrick, David Cronenberg, Brian De Palma, John Carpenter, and George Romero, King had decided to take the directorial helm for his next film outing, and despite it being an inaugural effort, he was going to do a BETTER job.

With eyes fixed on the camera in a cold hard stare, Stephen King stretched out his arm, pointed his index finger directly at the viewer and proclaimed, Im going to scare the HELL outta you! And thats a PROMISE!



As I left the theater that night, my mind was still buzzing with that short film preview. Sure, now its common knowledge that Stephen King had always been very vocally dissatisfied with Stanley Kubricks interpretation of The Shining. But this fact wasn't as widely known in 1986. Certainly it was obvious to any of Kings readers that filmmakers had oftentimes taken significant creative license in bringing those stories to the screen. And of course not all such efforts were well received, even by Kings most loyal fans, with films like Firestarter, Cats Eye, and Silver Bullet scoring somewhere between fair and decent at best.

But to have Stephen King himself stand before me and state that ALL of these prior cinematic adaptations were outright failures of his true vision, and that it would be up to him, the Master of Horror, to step up to the plate and show me what a REAL horror film is supposed to be.well, that was some pretty big talk. And I believed him. I trusted him. And I fully expected that come July I was going to have the hell scared outta me.

The rest, of course, is history. Maximum Overdrive was released. It bombed. I don't need to retread what I wrote at the start of this rant.

So we can chalk it all up to a collective learning experience. We ALL learned things:

-  Stephen King learned that the singular effort of writing a novel is not the same as the communal effort of making a film. Its typically supposed to be a balance of flexible control and shared vision. He later admitted that his own directorial effort through Maximum Overdrive resulted in the absolute worst representation of his vision.

-  As filmgoers we learned a little bit about sacrifice. Kings use of AC/DC to write and perform the soundtrack for Maximum Overdrive was a genius move, and the results of this powerhouse pairing is nearly perfect, as far as film soundtracks go. Having watched this movie in a first-run theater I can attest that where the music is concerned, hearing this soundtrack burning through speakers of a large auditorium Cineplex was the very best way to enjoy it. But such enjoyment came at significant cost, for this highly amplified musical gratification also corresponds with the very worst way to suffer Yeardley Smiths incomprehensibly incessant shrieking bride, Connie, a character who is mysteriously granted an overly gratuitous amount of screen time, but who is also screaming at the top of her lungs for every moment of it. By the halfway point of Maximum Overdrive Ms. Smith had already taken the record as the most insufferably annoying incessant screamer in film history, a record previously held since 1971 by Jessica Walter in Play Misty for Me. And though Ms. Smith was nearly unseated by Dakota Fanning in 2005s War of the Worlds, she still manages to retain this infamous crown of notoriety to this day.

-  As fans of Stephen Kings writing we were affirmed in something we had already known about what makes his work so personally resonating and successful  namely, character development. This was affirmed through our realization that Maximum Overdrive was entirely devoid of it. It could have used some.

-  And as for me? Well, I guess I learned that sometimes a promise just might not be much of a promise after all. Especially when its broken before its even made. Because what you have then is a lie. And in the case of Maximum Overdrive, a stinging, somewhat visually arresting, AC/DC infused, silly, campy, cardboard flat, 10 million dollar lie.

In the words of Yeardley Smiths franticly shrieking character, I DONT LIIIIIKE THIS!!!

If that would have been in there it would have made a five star rating. It's a fun movie, the effects are dated; but then so is Emilio Estevez.

I will admit that I actually like this movie. I know a lot of people hate it and think it is the worst King adapted film but I still enjoy it. I don't know if it is my love for King, Estevez, or more likely my love for the Green Goblin but I do like this flick. Of course I recognize its flaws and will never put it in a top ten list or anything. This was the first and only time King has directed a film which I think is a mistake because I feel he can make a great film. This was also the film in which DP Armando Nannuzzi lost one of his eyes.

On June 19 1987 a comet comes in contact with Earth or at least its trail which causes machines to operate on their own. This of course leads them to kill their oppressive human owners and launch a mechanical revolution. The biggest threat are the trucks that have taken over a gas station trapping several people inside. As time goes by the humans have to figure a way out of the situation before the trucks come for them and stop waiting.

Now you would think that nobody could adapt and then direct a Stephen King story better than Stephen King himself. As it turns out it is really a mixed bag of sorts. Sure over all the film is not a classic but King does show that he knows how to direct action as we get plenty of it here. This is far from a horror flick but it is a good action/Sci-Fi movie on the B level. Trucks, guns, and explosions make for an entertaining time when the brain is shut off. Of course the acting could have been better but I thought for the type of film it is they were good.

I honestly would love to see this rereleased with a commentary and such added, maybe some behind the scenes stuff. This is the film that lead to the DP of the film loosing an eye and then suing King. Any way over all I do enjoy this flick and find it fun. There are some very unintentionally funny moments in this flick. Plus AC/DC did the entire soundtrack, gotta love that.",1399593600,,1947,4.0625
793420,4,6304113404,"This movie is about trucks that become all ballistic and self-aware like terminators, but they aren't that advanced since most of them are 1970's Peterbilt tractor trailors.  I guess you can say they're bottom-line terminators.

That being said, there is a scene where a baseball coach tries to buy a soda from a vending machine and it shoots it out and hits him in the stomach then as he bends over it tags him in the face with a Dr. Pepper - pretty rad.

793647,5,6304113404,"If he was alive today, I'd like to ask the director of photography, Armando Nannuzzi, if this movie was worth losing an eye for.  While some might give up a body part for art, would they be equally as willing to lose something for crap?

Be that as it may, I love this turkey because it couldn't get off the ground.  It is unadulterated trash, made by someone who didn't know what he was doing but had the gall to go ahead and do it anyway.  That's either verve or folly.

It took me forever to find a copy to call my very own.  Yes, this is a guilty pleasure.  And I'm happy to note, from the tote board present, that the pleasure isn't all mine.

The story, such as it is, is more about stunts and gags than actual plot.  A rogue comet is blamed at first, then a ""large UFO,"" for machines turning on their owners ""we made you!""  A bit of a rogue himself, director/screenwriter King confused himself with Hitchcock and did a walk-on (following by a rude remark, severing forever any connection with the great director).
This movie staggers clumsily from slapstick (involving a drawbridge) to the horrific (a boy and a steamroller).  Too puerile to be consider macabre humor, it nevertheless provides enough irrationality to be constantly entertaining (not that I'd admit to that in public).  Take that variation on the old water hose gag only with a nozzle used for pumping gas, not original but it works.  As for the characters, each and every one of them is an aching clich&eacute; (from the redneck yahoo Bubba Hendershot, played by Pat Hingle, to the underplayed ""boy"" hero Emilio Estevez, nominated for a worst actor Razzie Award).  There's also an irritating screamer (Yeardley Smith) and yes, the mandatory slur against Christians, a two-faced Bible salesman (Christopher Murney).  All are in a race against time to escape being mangled by a machine.  Get onboard if you dare.",1369094400,2,1884,4.663636363636364

Packed with a heavy hitting soundtrack by the Australian thunder from down under AC/DC (ironic I know), Maximum Overdrive despite it's cheeseball story will delight gorehounds and headbangers a like.

Much like a mechanical version of George Romero's Night of the Living Dead, machines big and small begin revolting violently against people. Loaded with more dead bodies than an action movie and seriously dark humerous moments, this is a perfect movie for those saturday nights when nothing is on and you're so bored staring into space hurts. Hands down my favorite scene is the incredibly well shot chase sequence, where a huge and seriously ticked off Mack truck chases down a newly married couple down a deserted highway. Awesome. Though I still love the scene with the lawnmower, classic.

More so, the quiet moments of the film are usually slow but well accented with AC/DC's earlier blue's style motiff filling in the despair and desparation. So if you're looking for ninety minutes of bad B-movie to help you escape the day, look no further than Maximum Overdrive and enjoy Stephen King's hilarious cameo.",1241308800,,1305,5.009216589861751

Heck, even Emilio can't do it out of a paper bag. Still, the movie/disc has some redeeming qualities, the trucker riggs, especially the Green Goblin-faced one, are cool to watch run over people again and again, the AC/DC soundtrack has me screaming ""Who Made Who!"" all throughout my house, and the OOP Anchor Bay cover is probably one of the goriest ones ever to grace a Superstore shelf. Another plus is the Hitchcockian trailer featuring Stephen King himself saying rants like ""I've seen others direct my stories before, but if you want something done right, you gotta do it yourself"". Really Steve, ya sure about that? Definitely needs to sit by your copy of ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"", it's so bad at times it's wonderful.

I gotta admit, though: the new cover is an improvement over the abortion they used in the theaters and VHS cover, though I do miss the body hanging out of the grill as in an earlier version.

This was adapted and directd by my fave, Steve King.

The first time I saw this I wasn't as impressed but over the years this has actually aged well. The more I viewed it the more I appreciated that it is fun like the George Romero Undead movies. When a Alien controlled Comet's tail turns the sky green all the machines turn against humans. So anything from a electric carving knife to a Semi-Trailer Truck is deadly. The worst of all is a tractor-trailer with a big green goblin face on the front of the grill and toys in the back. Emilio Estevez and the rest the cast do a fine job making this horror come to life. Good quality DVD with decent replayability. If you enjoyed this catch ""The Thing"" (1982) and ""Dawn of the Dead"" (2004). - C. Luster",1215993600,,797,4.32
794178,3,6304113404,"I probably never would have watched or heard of this movie if it wasn't for my boss.  He warned me that the movie is pretty cheesy, but in a good way.  Sometimes I'm into cheesy films, but the premise of this film just seemed too goofy, so I was prepared for quite a flop.  Much to my surprise I ended up rather enjoying this movie.

Basically a cosmic anomaly interferes with Earth and all the machines start coming to life, including vehicles and so forth, and start attacking people.  The story is set in a very small town and despite the fact this problem is happening everywhere, this is about how those specific people tried to survive the horror.  It's kind of a ridiculous concept, but it's written by Stephen King and usually he has a pretty creative take on such things.  I'm not sure other writers would have been able to make this concept interesting, but King sure does, he really makes you wonder what's going to happen and there's plenty of dark humor to be had... in a sick and twisted way of course.  I may not be much of an avid King reader, but I do enjoy the movies that are taken from his library.

This is sort of an a-typical mid-80's film, so those in my age group will probably know what it means.  It means the cinematography isn't going to hugely compete with newer films, which will always have newer and better technology.  The acting is a little over acted in many scenes, which seems to be another common thread for under produced films in the 1980's.  Regardless of budget, I thought they put together a pretty interesting story and made it fun to watch overall.  It's got a lot of bad qualities which make it funny, but the way it plays out, its kind of obvious that it's intentional, so can't knock them for that!  I mean, it's kind of obvious this is supposed to have a degree of dark humor and fun to it when you see the soundtrack is done by AC/DC.

Overall this was definitely worth the watch for me.  It's just a fun movie, regardless of how stupid some of the scenarios are.  It's not overly gory and it focuses more on the people struggling to survive and how they plan their escape.  So it does have a bit of that campy horror quality to it.  It certainly won't be the greatest movie you ever see, but it sure is fun when you watch it.",1212537600,2,2277,4.315294117647059

794244,4,6304113404,"Maximum Overdrive has earned a place in movie history as a dud, both critically and commercially(my memory's not too good on this, but I do believe it did so-so at the box office).  I guess expectations were high considering Stephen King was taking on writing and directing credits himself.  People had been complaining for so long about how other directors and writers had botched King's works when adapting them for the big screen that it seemed like a great idea to have King himself have free reign over one of his stories.  The results?  Not what people were expecting.  I think a big reason this movie failed is because people were expecting a truly frightening film from King.  I mean, Stephen King is a household name and is synonymous with some of the most well known horror stories of all time.  Even someone who's never read a book in their lives knows this.  One can only assume that expectations for this film might have been a little high.  Much to everybody's shock and disappointment, King turned out, not a nail biting tale of terror, but a campy drive-in B movie!  Stephen King is a man with a sense of humor.  Even in his scariest novels he can't resist cracking a joke wherever he can.  His black humor can be found in practically everything he does.  He's even described himself as the ""literary equivalent of a Big Mac and fries"".  When this film came out he described it as a ""cinematic equivalent of a Big Mac and fries"".  Now, you take the subject matter of Maximum Overdrive(kind of a cross between Night of the Living Dead and King's own Christine) and you gotta think to yourself, ""could this really be scary?""  Of course not.  No director could make such a ridiculous concept rise above the level of B movie status, not even Stephen King.  A story like this plays out a bit scarier on the printed page than it does on the screen.  King isn't a moron, and seemed well aware of this.  Obviously his intent wasn't to make a scary film , otherwise he would have chosen a totally different story to make a film out of.  The first few minutes of the movie set the tone as King tries to get money from a profanity spewing ATM machine.  Then, during a pileup on a malfunctioning bridge, what appears to be a human head flies through a car's windshield, but you soon see it was only a watermelon.  It's all camp, folks.  And I'm not sure audiences knew exactly how to take this.  So this was horror master Stephen King's directorial debut?  Was he making a comedy??  Or was this just a really bad attempt at a horror film?  Most people thought it was the latter, and just filed it away as a miserable failure.  King has since disowned this movie and hasn't made one since, probably never will.  Hey, if he's unhappy with it, then he's unhappy with it.  I like it personally.  It's certainly not perfect.  It's a bit slow at times and alot of the characters are kinda blah, but it is a fun B movie.  It's got some over the top gore, some hilarious lines, some catchy tunes, and of course, no redeeming value whatsoever.  Big Mac and fries indeed.",1187568000,,3065,4.471119133574007

794315,3,6304113404,"In 1986, I was still a Steven King fan, but those days were coming to a close, and this movie helped me lose interest in King.

Was it because of the quality of the movie as a whole?  No.  This movie was based on the short story ""Trucks"" from his collection ""Night Shift"".  Actually, ""Trucks"" proceeded ""Christine"" in writing, and ""Christine"" was actually better as a movie.

This movie, as a lot of Steven King's story, has a scientific explanation for the horror.  In this case, the tail of a comet brought machines to life.  Yet they had an intelligence that is unexplained.  Also unexplained is why it didn't effect the cars of some of the people who ended up at the truck stop.

One person criticized the acting, but I thought the acting was decent.  The problem was the scripting; it came across like an amateur screenwriter, who could learn from better writers like the popular horror writer Stephen King  . . . Wait!  King is that amateur screenwriter!  One thing I didn't like was a boy asked about his father.  The lead characters were going to lie to him, and the truck stop owner coldly told him the truth.  The lead characters acted like the problem was telling the truth, not the manner of telling that truth.

Included was an early cameo of King, but it came across in his first scene that he was looking behind him to make sure the camera was working; it did not seem natural.

The item I really despised was a religious hypocrite in the movie.  By that point, I was beginning to see Christian hypocrites were common in his stories.  The one here corresponded with a character in the short story, but the religious aspect of the short story character was absent.  This was what helped me get over my King fandom, and I hadn't read a novel of his since seeing this movie.",1169164800,,1786,4.470588235294118
794316,3,6304113404,"""Maximum Overdrive"" (1986) is what you would get if you crossed ""Duel"" with ""Night of the Living Dead"" and significantly amped up the parody component of each film (there is a little ""Temors"" here as well). Not exactly highbrow, it is considerably more entertaining than its rating score would indicate; especially if you can connect with the parody element.

Written and directed by Stephen King on a very modest special effects budget, the story shifts between idyllic small-town and redneck truck stop somewhere in North Carolina. A UFO has somehow gained control over most machines (insert ""Metropolis"" here) which proceed to slaughter a considerable number of people.

Neither the film nor King's original story seem to have anything profound to say about aliens, humans, or machines. That is probably for the best as deep philosophy would only get in the way of the entertainment value of this thing.

Like the farm house in ""Night of the Living Dead"", those who remain alive take refuge in a nearby truck stop. Pat Hingle gives an over-the-top performance as the greedy owner who just happens to have a small arsenal of weapons concealed on the premises. Yeardley Smith as a stressed-out newlywed provides additional comic relief. Emilio Estavez and Laura Harrington provide the story's romantic element. Music is by King's favorite band AC/DC. Although everything from lawnmowers to blow dryers get into the act, most of the focus is on the eighteen-wheelers which besiege the truck stop around the clock.

794318,5,6304113404,"I love this movie, and refuse to apologize for that. No it's not a first rate horror movie, but it is a first rate science fiction fun fest. I will tell you that when I first watched this movie, back in the 80s as a child, it scared me. Not the ""monster in the closet"" or ""ghost in the attic"" or even the ""zombies outside my window"" scare, it was a whole new tingly kind the ""I am afraid to go on the highway or plug anything in"" scare. What Jaws did for the ocean, Maximum Overdrive did for outlets and I-75. I remember that before I saw the movie, I saw a Fangoria article about the makeup and effects and I was so excited to see it all in action, there is a good deal of blood and gore, and although its very tongue in cheek and there isn't any Oscar worthy performances I enjoyed all the interactions and dialogue anyway. The AC/DC soundtrack is awesome, and fits the whole killer machine storyline, the sounds of the trucks, and airplanes, and ice cream trucks and lawnmowers and electric knives add their own musical horror throughout.  I also have a soft spot for Emilio Estevez, he has such a presence on screen, his laughter is infectious, and him being in a bloodstained white t-shirt was enough for me to form a lifelong crush on him that still resonates to this day, sick I know but he is just hot. So don't go into this expecting a Horror movie, after all its about aliens who come in the tail of a comet and try to wipe out the human race with the very things we produced with our own hands.

It is a bit campy, but the acting, by the professional actors, for the most part is good.  King has a way of directing that allows us to see the humorous errors of our ways.  Pat Hingle as the over confident red neck owner of the Dixie Truck Stop is wonderful.  Estevez as the punked out underpaid dish washer fits the bill.  And, you get the annoying whine of the voice of Liza Simpson, Yeardly Smith, thrown in.  When the self propelled endless convoys of tractor trailers zones in on the Dixie Truck stop to feed their insatiable appetite for more fuel one cannot help but make the connection to our own gas guzzling addiction in 2005.  This film is about 20 years old, but is still fresh.  AC/DC did all of the soundtrack, and while I am not a fan of theirs, their music adds great mood to this Sci-fi classic.  If there is a down side to the movie it is that there seems to be a loss of continuity in the story line.  I think in the beginning of the movie it is a comet that turns the night sky green and sets the machines against the humans, but at the end of the movie their is a post script saying it was a UFO.  Well that is little price to pay for an otherwise great flick in the tradition of cheesy 1950's horror movies.

794369,4,6304113404,"I have been watching this movie since I was about 7 years old and still never get tired of it.  I have probably seen it about 150 times and continue to find enjoyment.  There is a review posted that completly bashes this movie and basically tells readers not to waste their time.  Well, I have to disagree.  While the mvie is not nearly as good as the book(are they ever???), it still has strong entertainment value.

First, it humorous and not because it's cheesy, but because it is funny!  The dialgoue between characters, the situations they are put in and the reactions some have to the machines taking over; are all reasons to watch this movie.

The acting might not be the best, but by no means, is it bad.  Emilio Estevez is our main character, and does a fine job as Bubba, an ex-convict, short-order diner cook.  His boss(who's name I can't remember), plays your typical Texan in charge of his business, who amazingly has a secret stash of bazookas and guns below the diner(perfect for antagonizing the trucks outside).  I also love the newlyweds in this movie.  I believe their names are Curtis and Connie and they are a ball of laughs.

Honestly folks, this movie is very entertaining and suitable for younger kids to watch.  There really aren't many scares(I was never afraid to watch this movie as a child), but there is mild gore and a few thrilling moments.

Great job Mr. King!!!",1101427200,58,1395,4.5951417004048585

He had belly-ached for years about the low quality of the film versions of his horror stories, claiming that he could do it better himself. Well, MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE (based on S.K.'s excellent short story ""TRUCKS"") is a serious monument to ineptitude! Don't get me wrong, I love Steve's books and have spent many sleepless nights reading them. However, King directs movies with all the finess of a gorilla tossing a salad! Scenes of ""horror"" are hilarious, and humorous lines sink like lead life-jackets. I think the main problem lies in the fact that the short story is about 10 pages long, leaving Steve with WAY too much time to fill. Emilio Estevez and Pat Hingle lumber through their roles like logs on the way to the mill. Estevez as an action hero is like Arny Schwarzenegger as King Lear! The trucks and other machines that come to life are utterly un-terrifying (putting a plastic 'green goblin' face on the grill of the main truck was no help, as it just wobbled along looking stupid).

794464,3,6304113404,"This 1986 Stephen King film (he directed the movie and wrote the screenplay) is possibly his worst film. The cheesy 80's is written all over it and it's not the mature work of Stephen King, who has come up with scarier material than this. Stars Emilio Estevez as the leader of a group of truck stop diner who have to band together to defeat possessed trucks. A comet that passed through the skies left an eerie green cloud over the town and has made it possible for human's inventions, electronic or otherwise, to rebel against humans. Soon, all the trucks come to life and drive themselves, killing off their drivers. This film is really nothing exciting or even scary. Stephen King has created more frightening horror films. Even if he was trying to go for a science fiction type of horror genre, it didn't work. Maybe because it was the 80's and this is just one bad apple in the bunch.
Yeardley Smith, best known as the voice of Lisa Simpson from The Simpsons is part of the cast. It's refreshing to see her in person and in movies outside from the cartoons. She was also in the short lived early 90's series ""Herman's Head"". This is definately not Emilio Estevez's best work. About a year earlier, he had performed in The Breakfast Club in which he did a much better job. He would do the same later in the 90's with the Mighty Ducks movies. The trucks are funny to look at and the humans being killed by them is not as frightening as it should be. Especially comedic is the truck with the Green Goblin head on it. This movie, which is a sort of camp classic, is more enjoyable if it does'tn take itself seriously. This movie DOES try to be serious horror. The ending implies that the survivors made it possible for the aliens in the green cloud to be defeated and it is supposed to be a sort of serious film about survival. But it's not really a good film for that type of plot. I feel this movie would be better to look at in Mystery Science Theatre 3000 where they showcase old camp, bad movies with ad lib jokes. Then maybe this movie would be better to look at. But if you're into the 80's, Stephen King (no matter what he does) and Emilio Estevez, this is the film for you.

794467,3,6304113404,"Beeing a big AC/DC fan I will actually give you a review that dosent have anything to do with the great sound track!
I give this movie about 3 and a half. This was the very first movie that Steven King did himself, and I think it might have been the last? In the trailer, Steven King says somthing like ""if you want it done right, you have to do it yourself, and I will scare you"" but i gotta honestly say, he failed at that unfortunalty.... I remember when it first came out it did scare me, but i was about 6 years old at the time and the big boys and grown up's where watching it.... but years later when I found out that AC/DC had done a soundtrack to a movie, i went and rented it.... And was plesently suprised to see it was that movie that scared me all those years ago. But the second time around did nothing to scare me. Overall, the movie i don't think is that bad, its definitly not scary, its not the best acting, its not totally suspensfull, and it has some weird twists and turns... but to quote AC/DC's rhythem guitarist Malcolm Young ""It's not all that great of a movie, but its still better then alot of the crap you see these days!"" And I fully agree with him!
Sure, yeah, the soundtrack is mostly 95% AC/DC and the album soundtrack to this movie is AC/DC's ""who made who"" but that isn't what makes me have a liking to the film.... actually, infact, I don't quite think AC/DC's music blends in with the picture to be honest! well, some do... but one that puzzles me is ""For those about to rock"" beeing played when they sneak over to the showers and then into the sewer pipes.... I don't understand any conenction with the song, music and scene to be quite honest... and a few others i could point out just don't match the moment or mood with the music thats selected, or mixed in at wrong moments... if you know what i mean?
But apart from that, The movie as you shoudlve read by now is about a comet going over the world, and the machines come to life....and then the story goes into a group of people who are strandard in a gas station ...yadda yadda yadda.... my one question about the plot is, why don't the cars come alive? but anyway, the performance from the actors is not spectaculer.... but don't get me wrong, i hate award winning perfromances... so im ok with it, ive seen a hell of alot worse! The movie is allright... but i don't recomend you pay alot for it... i was able to pick mine up pretty cheap.
The bonus features arnt anything to praise. Theres a trailer, and a bio of Steven King which lists all the movies he has had cameo's in and it's intresting to find out where he actually is in this movie!! ""Honey, this machine just called me an (...)
I don't consider trailers and wide screen to be any kind of bonus feature. those should and pretty much are, standard features. So this DVD basicly only comes with a bio on Steven King and nobody else... I think Emilio Estefes shoudlve gotten a filmography... and there should be more bonus features :( Maybe the ""Who Made Who"" video clip? that would make it worth the price alone for what it is at the moment! but unfortuanlty theres nothing... it might come in widescreen and surround sound, but i serisloy think the movie shoudl have had a bit more added to it in the bonus department to make it worth the while to purchase!

794521,5,6304113404,"Anyone caught in the Blackout of 2003 must surely have thought of this movie.  When the T.V. stopped working, the familiar drone of the fridge was eerily gone and trucks kept rumbling by on the unlit streets... all that was missing was the psychotic roar of a lawnmower springing to life and chasing you down the street!
I have two confessions to make.
1) I hate almost all Stephen King adaptions except two.
2) The two I like are Carrie and Maximum Overdrive.
Maximum Overdrive is a great film (hear me out before clicking on the ""Unhelpful review"" button!).
First of all, it is set in a situation that we can all relate to, everyday life in an urban environment, compare this with an empty hotel at the top of a mountain for example.
It preys on one of our biggest 21st Century fears, that we are no longer in control of our environment.  Humankind has become so detached from the everyday rigours of surviving that our ancestors went through that we have no idea what we would do if our civilization broke down. No electricity, no fridge, no food, no machines, no information, no phones.  Maximum Overdrive brings these fears to life, and then adds the horrific twist, that the machines then turn on their masters, although slightly after the Terminator franchise had started rolling.  Surely this fear is easier to relate to than that the girl you bully at school may turn out to possess supernatural powers she can deploy for revenge purposes...
The movie also deals with alienation while in an urban environment.  Like the group stuck in the mall in George Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead"", the people isolated in the truck stop are at once in a familiar environment, and at the same time stuck in a totally foreign world, making it easier for the viewer to relate, and amplifying the horror felt watching it.
The best bits of the film occur in the opening sequences, when the machines go crazy, decimating the world's humans.  The middle section deals with the increasing tensions between the people caught in the truck seige and the final part deals with their escape and eventual triumph over the machines, culminating in Emilio Estevez's final, hilarious quote...
Maximum Overdrive is a fantastic modern horror movie, bringing terror to familiar situations, and Post-Blackout, I recommend you watch this movie again and allow yourself to think ""What if...""",1062460800,3,2361,4.802955665024631
794522,4,6304113404,"This was King's one and only stab at being at hollywood director (so far), and the trailer has him saying he will ""scare the hell out of you, and that's a promise."" That promise wasn't exactly ""kept"", but that didn't hurt the movie too much. It involves a comet that will be real close to the earth for the next eight days. In fact, too close. It causes machines all over the planet to function on their own, and they appear to be fed up with be the slaves of mankind. Next thing you know, we've got everything from drawbridges to vending machines going berserk and attacking humans. At the Dixie Boy truck stop, about a 12 big trucks come to life and encircle the resturant full of people inside, like Emilio Estevez, Pat Hingle, one VERY dumb waitress, who takes every chance she get's to shout at the trucks, ""We made you!"", and alot of others who meet quite gruesome ends. There's something here for everyone; there's horror, comedy, action, suspense, romance, etc. Even the soundtrack is cool, since it was done entirely by AC DC",1053993600,2,1034,4.53475935828877
794523,4,6304113404,"In 1987, a comet will pass close to the Earth, and the planet will be enveloped in its tail. During the next seven or eight days, all machines go wacky, and rebel against their human masters. The patrons and workers of a truck stop must band together to fight off the killer trucks, electric knives, arcade games, vending machines, etc. to stay alive and find out what is causing this mess.
Finally, a not so rare version of the cult classic! Anchor Bay has done a splendid job with this box-office bomb (yet one of my favorite films), from the disc (that looks like the front of the toy company truck),The chapter card/poster replica, the menus(the main menu and extras menu include the two main AC/DC songs from the film, but the main menu is the only place on the disc where you will hear the entire ""Shook Me All Night Long"" instead of just music snippets like on other discs from big-name companies), video, sound, and extras, which is my only gripe: NOT ENOUGH! Sure, a trailer and King bio are good, but what about commentary (I'm sure that Emilio Estevez, Yeardley Smith, and Stephen King would have been up to it, don't you?), still galleries, TV spots, behind the scenes,interviews, the whole nine yards? Anchor Bay should consider doing a special edition of this title(along with My Science Project, Condorman, and any title that doesn't have extras. Sure, I'd like a DVD of my favorite movie as much as the next guy, but I'd like my movies with at least a trailer and commentary, or just a trailer would be fine). Anyway, they did a good job on a (critically) ... movie.

It would've been interesting to see more of the carnage caused by the machines in other places{You do, but not for very long}. It seems that only the trucks are coming to life and not the cars. You see a steamroller in one scene and a lawnmower later but Stephen must be very fond of trucks. He must also be very fond of truck stops because by the time all the main characters arrive that's all we'll see until they escape. It's quite obvious they're going to make it because lo and behold, there is an armory under the truck stop! They get away on a boat at the end. Wouldn't the boats be coming to life too?

-Beware, there may be some spoilers here.-
Everyone at the truck stop knows that Mr. Hendershot has a truckload of weapons and rocket launchers in the basement. So why don't they just use them against the trucks? Duh?
The dialogue [is bad] too. There is not one memorable line in the entire movie. And the acting is sporadically bad. The girl who becomes Emilio Estevez's girlfriend is very beautiful but she cannot act her way out of a linen closet. The pointless AC/DC soundtrack is totally worthless and contributes ZERO to the film.
For Spiderman fans (like me) there is a bonus tho, as there is a huge face of the Green Goblin on the toy truck. But that's still no reason to watch this farce. The reason these trucks are coming to life is because the earth is caught in the tail of a comet (which we never see) and all machines are rebelling against mankind. We don't see many other machines other than the trucks but it turns out that it was all just a plot by aliens to sweep us off the planet. This is unseen also, we are simply told this from words on the screen at the end of the movie. COME ON!
Stephen King should stick to writing as he has handled this film VERY badly and this is very strange as he should know how to transfer his book to film. There is another movie version called TRUCKS. Perhaps you should check that out instead as I cannot imagine anything being worse than this. I do think that if John Carpenter directed this film it could have been cool, but let's just forget about itquickly.

This movie neither intelligent nor scary is about killer machines. In the first scene we see appliances such as a lawn mower take control of themselves and attack innocent victims.

Emilio Estevez is the mastermind of this bunch and out of nowhere comes up with a scheme to save the day. The entire movie is drawn out and plain dull. Acting is sub par and did not impress me.

Of course the very handsome Emilio Estevez truly helps the movie.  Though that shabby love scene with im could have been left on the cutting room floor.

Stephen King always has excellent thrillers, even though this movie isn't the best quality it still is a good movie. And the fact the AC/DC did the Whole soundtrack to the movie just makes me like it more. I love this movie and it's a good thriller if your not in the mood for the Matrix.",996192000,,412,4.098765432098766

If it was an option, I would give it negative 6 stars. If you want a good action, get The Road Warrior. If you want a good car horror movie, stick with Cristine at least. But all can say is, it's a waste of time, money, and space on your movie shelf.",994377600,5,378,4.121621621621622
794599,3,6304113404,"There is hardly any quality whatsoever in this film, but that's exactly what King wanted.  A junk movie.  This one will shock you, it will gross you out, it will make you laugh, it will even scare you if you let it.  This movie is fun!!
The film is partly based on King's short story ""Trucks""...a few years ago, another movie was made partially based on the same story...the movie even holds the title: Trucks.  But if you thought Maximum Overdrive was terrible (why you'd think such negative things, i don't know why) Then definately stay away from the movie 'Trucks'...one of the worst movies i seen!
This is King's only directing job, and I gotta take my hat off to his work.  Direction and composition, etc. are great!  Looks very much like the style of John Carpenter.  My only beef is that King declined to do a commentary for this DVD.  He already recorded one for the Laserdisc release...I guess Anchor Bay couldn't get the rights to use that one...King is a master of his craft and is a genius...His commentary and insight would have made this DVD worth buying.",992390400,3,1070,4.56544502617801
794600,4,6304113404,"This movie rocks so hard.  Emilio Estevez is just a bad @$$, plain and simple.  He's the hero that knows exactly what to do at any given time.  This movie has the greatest story.  The title cards at the beginning and the end of the movie are key.  The ending summing up everything is perfect.  The head truck, aka the Green Goblin, is menacing and is the greatest bad guy.  The explosions are just plain awesome.  Of course this movie could have ended as soon as they find the weapons if they just blew up the Green Goblin, but hey not every movie is perfect.  My only question is where is the director's commentary on this DVD?  I want to know all the juicy details of this fine, fine film.  ""WE MADE YOU!

Just to clear this up. Its not a comet, It was a UFO hideing behind the comet. So insted of the aliens coming on earth to wipe us out they turn our man made devices on us.
Any thing with power.
Over all its a great thrill ride. With plenty of action. Its not a movie to be looked at to seriously like small solders. Its a great movie but its not possible. So when you watch it don't think of how much it cant happen just let your mind go and enjoy the ride. Stephen King is the man!
the only problem I have with the DVD is that its not the fully uncut virson :-( and they need other stuff like behind the scenes and stuff.

This looks fabulous, and the sound isn't all that bad either, considering it's a digital 5.1 remix of the original soundtrack.  Very heavy in the center channel, but hey Stephen King writes books, we can't expect him to do everything as good!  I suggest the chapter ""squashed by the steamroller.""  If you haven't seen it, you can probably just imagine.  I highly recommend a good buzz and a few buddies to boot with this one.",988588800,,577,4.345794392523365

794648,5,6304113404,"MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE is a funny, gory, end of the world thriller from Stephen King (who directs for the first time from one of his published short stories). The story is about a comet that flies across the Earth, and after that, machines all over the world begin to come to life and take on a life force of there own (cars and trucks run down innocent people, electric knives cut there victims, soda pop machines shoot soda cans out like grenades, etc.). The main part of the story takes place at a gas station where the machines have people trapped inside, fighting for there lives, and figuring out a way to escape. The music to this movie is nothing but memorable songs from the great rock band AC/DC.",985910400,17,701,4.484375

794650,5,6304113404,"I saw Maximum Overdrive on the big screen back in the day of July 1986. I loved it then and, for the longest time, had thought a widescreen transfer of this goofy, gory end of the world thriller would never happen. Thank God the people at Anchor Bay have pulled through AGAIN.
The movie? A rogue comet zips past earth and, for the next seven days or so, it's glowing tail will be enveloping our planet. Minutes after this happens machines of all sorts begin to get uppity and start trying to wipe humanity of the face of the earth. Several people become trapped in a truck stop and have to fight for survival.
What lifts Maximum Overdrive is a whole lot a goofball humor and some truly great set pieces involving soda machines, bulldozers, a cursing ATM machine, and a bridge that raises up while traffic is still clogging it.
Maximum Overdrive is a hoot, filled with gross outs and funny potty humor. It also has a rocking good score by AC/DC.  Recommend for the trash b-movie lover everywhere.",982886400,3,995,4.527777777777778

794682,1,6304113404,"There's one thing I've learned about Stephen King films- they're either  pretty good, or pretty bad. It's a hit-and-miss affair. In the case of  `Maximum Overdrive', The bullet never even made the distance to the target.  The only reason I was even attracted to it in the first place was the  soundtrack by AC/DC, and even that didn't improve the movie's quality.  Although I gotta admit that the ATM teller machine insulting the character  played by Stephen King himself at the movie's opening is pretty hilarious.  And King even drawls a pretty good Southern accent in response. Or was that  dubbed in? I'm not too sure. Either way, it's one of the few high points in  this whole sad affair.
If you want to take a look at a good Stephen King  flick, I suggest you pick up the theatrical version of `The Shining',  `Stand By Me', or `Misery'.

It is by no means a great movie - even it's director states he wanted to make a junk film - and he has succeeded admirably.  The whole premise and situation are stupid enough to make the  view realise what the film would be like so forget about enjoying a  dramatic tour-de-force and just enjoy it.  Top marks simply go for the  films whole attitude and that Steven King has had the guts to make a film  where the dog and the kiddies actually die!

By far the best thing about this movie is the stunts and mayhem created by the killer trucks surrounding the diner, not  to mention the rockin' AC/DC soundtrack! The plot is silly - very similar  to a 1974 TV movie called KILLDOZER actually - an alien comet possesses all  machines on Earth to rebel against humans. So we are treated to drinks  vendors killing kids with Coke cans, ATMs calling people names, killer  cars, killer trucks and a crazy kitchen knife, not to mention a demonic  video arcade. Stephen King sure proves he has a warped imagination(it also  shows in a lot of his books.) and delivers a fine piece of pure mind candy  entertainment.
