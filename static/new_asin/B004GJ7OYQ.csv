8428809,5,B004GJ7OYQ,Very good!,1428969600,,10,4.5
8428810,5,B004GJ7OYQ,"This DVD is full of useful knowledge. From massage techniques to one of my favorite vinyasa flows I make time for this yoga everyday and often re-watch different segments. It does come in a sleeve, but I have no problem conserving material. You are paying for the knowledge of these individuals and I think the DVD is worth the price.",1395878400,,334,4.583333333333333
8428811,2,B004GJ7OYQ,"This isn't necessarily a negative, but the photo of this item makes it appear that it is a regular-size DVD case, but it actually comes in a small, square, paper sleeve.  Just a head's up.

The massage section was very nice, and Randine's explanation of the techniques was superb.  I'm going to be the outlier here and say that I DID NOT like the yoga section at all.  Jennifer talks for several minutes at the beginning, and says that this is a beginner's vinyasa flow.  I am by no means a yoga expert, but I have taken a class and have been following various yoga DVDs for many years, and this is not a beginner's practice.  One reviewer found the pace to be too slow; I found it to be too fast.  Many of the poses are quite difficult for a beginner, proper posture and positioning are very rarely explained, and very few modifications are offered for those less experienced or less flexible.  Some examples: Jennifer spends a large chunk of time in Downward Facing Dog, which for a beginner can be a challenging pose to master.  She does suggest bending the knees, but then goes on to hold Downward Dog for several minutes (certainly not easy for a beginner), and introduces some difficult variations, such as lifting one leg behind your head and swinging it around.  Other times she tells the viewer to drop into Chaturanga and then Upward Facing Dog. What these asanas entail is never explained, so a beginner may not understand what exactly to do with their body.  Same with Reverse Warrior, Warrior III, Triangle Pose, etc.  At the very worst, someone could injure themselves pushing their body incorrectly into a posture they are unfamiliar with.  More likely, they will not get the intended benefit from those postures.  Speaking of...I would love to know what each posture is doing for my body and my fertility!

I have a couple other yoga for fertility DVDs that I like MUCH better.  I would highly recommend ""Yoga Practices for Fertility"" from Pulling Down the Moon.  Explanations are better, modifications are offered, and there is an AMAZING visualization section.  I would also strongly recommend the book ""Yoga and Fertility"" by Jill Mahrlig Petigara and Lynn Jensen.  Some people may find the pace too slow, but there are beginner and intermediate practices for the first and second half of your cycle, as well as for ART cycles and during your period.  After a thorough explanation of how to perform each posture, the benefit it provides to your mind and body is detailed.

As much as I appreciated the massage portion, I don't think it was worth what I spent on this DVD, especially considering that there are better resources out there, particularly for someone who is a beginner.  This may be a great practice for someone very experienced in yoga, but it really shouldn't be marketed as good for beginners.",1385424000,,2827,4.738241308793456
8428812,2,B004GJ7OYQ,I was expecting more voga poses versus the main host just speaking for 1/2 of the dvd.  The flow is slower than I expected and I found I was bored.,1376438400,,147,3.9
8428813,5,B004GJ7OYQ,"My best friend struggled with the stress of infertility. She enjoyed doing yoga with this DVD. She is pregnant now! (I don't claim that this DVD caused it...we all know a bit more is required, but the stress relief definitely helped!)",1369094400,,234,4.7317073170731705
8428814,5,B004GJ7OYQ,Fertile soul yoga dvd is very helpful with good advice and also a little hope to help with infertility issue and give us some method to relax!,1337558400,,142,4.296296296296297
8428815,4,B004GJ7OYQ,"This is another great supplement to the book the Infetility Cure.  The book itself has a lot of information, but if you are not familiar with yoga and accupressure it is difficult to follow in the book.  The video provides much more detail in where and how to apply the accupressure and the yoga is also very informative.  I would recommend this to anyone following Randine Lewis' fertility plan.  Good luck to you.  I pray for all of the women struggling with infertility every day.",1314748800,5,483,4.635294117647059

8428817,5,B004GJ7OYQ,"This DVD contains a wonderful, hip-opening vinyasa flow routine which would be good for anyone (and adaptable to any level). In addition, the lecture info regaring stress along with the meditations and femoral massage information is truly invaluable for anyone struggling with infertilty and beyond that, for anyone looking to lead a ""fertile"" life!  Jennifer Burgemeister and Randine Lewis are such incredible experts - I feel so fortunate to have the opportunity to learn from them!",1299715200,10,484,5.368421052631579
8428818,5,B004GJ7OYQ,"This is a great yoga for fertility dvd, and has lots of extras like meditation, abdominal massage, and even some of Dr. Randine Lewis' retreat work.
