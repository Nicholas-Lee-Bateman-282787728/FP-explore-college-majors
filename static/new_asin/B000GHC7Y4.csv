8668270,1,B000GHC7Y4,"I was really disappointed with this DVD.  It opens with an explanation of the ""Grove Approach to Fibromyalgia.""  The speaker speaks very slowly and methodically in a monotone voice.  It's hard to listen to.  When you get into the actual exercise part of the tape, the ""relaxing"" background music is so loud that you can barely hear the narration, which leaves you craning your neck to watch what she's doing, so you can copy it.  The whole experience left me feeling tense and annoyed.",1189814400,91,485,4.726190476190476
