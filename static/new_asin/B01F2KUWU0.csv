8759974,5,B01F2KUWU0,"I've ordered several of the Raimund Theatre (Vienna) productions and have never been disappointed.  Mozart was beautifully produced-not as wonderful as the live performance but the best we can get on this side of the Atlantic.  MUCH TO MY SURPRISE, this PAL (Region 2) disc DOES contain English subtitles!",1466985600,,305,5.204081632653061
8759975,5,B01F2KUWU0,"I was so happy they filmed this amazing musical.  The staging is beautifully done and the acting and singing are A++.  There is no translation on the DVD, so best to do a little research about the story. The DVD may not be compatible with all U.S  DVD players. However, you can play it on your home computer or laptop just fine. The film is a FSK 0 which means no age restrictions. A wonderful DVD to add to the other German musicals filmed at the Raimund Theatre: Rudolf - Affaire Mayerling and Elisabeth.",1466380800,,506,4.361702127659575
