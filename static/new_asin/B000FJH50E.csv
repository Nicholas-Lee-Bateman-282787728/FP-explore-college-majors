8426627,1,B000FJH50E,Absolutely abysmal!  Has none of the finesse or production values of Girls Gone Wild nor none of the rawness of Girls Going Crazy.  Even worse it has none or very little (I'm not sure as I fast forward the entire tape)girl coverage.  It seems all he did was spend the entire shoot in one spot of the beach and all you have is really a lot of guys drunk.  Very very little of good quality bikini girls and no nudity unless I missed a few seconds worth during fast forward.  Yet another DVD where I am fortunate that the case isn't broken so I can use it to replace a broken case!  Shuck this sucks!  His other film Spring Break the Movie does feature some fairly decent nudity but from memory the film quality was poor.  I suggest that you try that one but not this one and only if it is available for well under $10.,1158192000,2,816,4.1528662420382165
