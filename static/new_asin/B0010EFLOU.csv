8237753,5,B0010EFLOU,"A great show from the San Francisco Jazz Festival, a radio interview, a chat with George Shearing, and a few takes from Torm's rehearsal with the Mel Lewis Orchestra for the show - this is the complete program of this VHS that has not seen a deserved issue in DVD media until today.

Mel Torm is splendid. He is surprisingly introduced to the stage by Jon Hendricks who returns in the middle of the show to perform 'Down for Double' with Torm: Simply Spectacular!

The Mel Lewis Orchestra is specially inspired under the conduction of Maestro ... Mel Torm. Total command!

Torm singing is superb in the jazz uptempo numbers like 'Bluesette' and in top standards like 'Here's That Rainy Day' and 'Blues in The Night'.

Great Torm! This is a must-have video for people who loves good singing with great musicians, being Jazz fans or not.",1303862400,3,835,4.659863945578231
