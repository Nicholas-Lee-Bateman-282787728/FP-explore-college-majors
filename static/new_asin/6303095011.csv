564838,5,6303095011,"When eight year old Barbara Barry, the daughter of a wealthy, widowed soap manufacturer, sneezes three times at the dinner table, the strict servant Collins (Sara Haden) sends her off to bed. Woodward, (Jane Darwell) another servant - who has a kinder approach - suggests that little Barbara be sent to a school in the Adirondacks where she can be happy with many other children her own age...A thoroughly delightful Temple vehicle, this colorized video will please children from 5-95. The picture bears little resemblance to the 1912 Eleanor Gates novel because many of the incidents in the movie come from a Ralph Spence story entitled BETSY TAKES THE AIR. A highly successful version - which was much truer to the original book - was filmed as a 1917 silent starring Mary Pickford. Amusingly, Shirley sings the song BUT DEFINITELY in a manner a'la Crosby singing WHERE THE BLUE OF NIGHT MEETS THE GOLD OF THE DAY. By 1939, this movie reaped a $2.5 million profit. One of Shirley's better films, to be sure.",1041984000,18,1009,4.804597701149425
564839,5,6303095011,"Shirley Temple is charming in this darling story of a young girl named Barbra going on her idea of a vacation.  She meets new and exciting people like Tony, an Italian papa, and The Dolan family, radio stars that invite Barbra into their radio act.  The story is heart-warming and filled of surprises, but ends happily.  Shirley sings and dances consistantly throughout the film, but my favorite song at the radio program is ""You've gotta eat your spinach baby!""  My mom always use to say that to me as a little girl!  If you are a big Shirley Temple fan, you will of course enjoy Shirley in this enchanting film.  The movie also contains other excellent actors and actresses like Alice Faye, Jack Haley (the Tinman from ""The Wizard of Oz""), and Gloria Stuart in her early years before ""Titanic.""

564988,5,6303095011,"""Poor Little Rich Girl"" is TRULY a Shirley Temple MASTERPIECE. It is my all-time favorite Temple film. I don't understand why 20th Century Fox has not released this on DVD yet....same with ""Our Little Girl"".....is there a way to contact 20th Century Fox to demand this classic film be released in DVD format? An another thing: Does anyone else out there ever wonder/hope they will put Temple films on Blu-ray? Imagine those wonderful old films of hers in 1080p!

""Poor Little Rich Girl"" is a MUST HAVE for any classic musical film fan, and of course, Temple fans!",1389571200,9,563,4.744897959183674

565120,5,6303095011,"Actresses like Gloria Stuart and Alice Faye were all too aware of the pitfalls of sharing screen time with Shirley Temple. There's that concern of fading into the background because, frankly, the cuteness of Shirley Temple is a dazzling, upstaging thing. On the other hand, back in the Depression era, a Shirley Temple feature received massive exposure, and to be in one is to soak in the residue pub. Gloria Stuart would go on to co-star in REBECCA OF SUNNYBROOK FARM, again playing second fiddle to the marvelous moppet. But first she co-starred in POOR LITTLE RICH GIRL, another successful morale booster in a time in which morale boosters were sorely in need. You think this current recession is bad...

Barbara Barry (Temple) is the coddled young daughter of a soap magnate. But while adored by the household and by her widowed father, Barbara is often lonely, not having anyone her own age to play with and her dad away on business much of the time. As a fix to this, Mr. Barry arranges to have Barbara attend a boarding school. But en route, Barbara's stuffy governess is fatally run down - a tragic scene that is quickly glossed over and never again mentioned - and Barbara ends up wandering the urban streets.

Because this is a Shirley Temple vehicle, Barbara rolls with the flow, doesn't get scared. She's taken in by a kindly organ grinder and, later, by Jimmy and Jerry Dolan, a struggling husband-and-wife vaudeville act. Jimmy and Jerry (Jack Haley & Alice Faye) are trying to make a splash on radio and Jimmy figures this little girl who he learns can sing and dance is their ticket to the big time. And Jimmy's right. Dolan, Dolan & Dolan becomes a featured act on a new radio hour show being sponsored by a soap company. It's just not Barbara's dad's soap company, but his rival's, an old, bushy-eyebrowed, sour-pussed curmudgeon named Peck. Peck has absolutely no shot against the supernaturally cute Barbara. Moments after their initial meet, he's giving her piggyback rides. Later on, when Mr. Peck vehemently rails against Mr. Barry's peace offering, Barbara beamingly instructs him: ""I don't know what that means, but why don't you do it?""

So we see Shirley Temple playing ""Barbara Barry"" playing ""Betsy Ware"" playing ""Bonnie Dolan,"" and I don't even think this was a problem for her. Apparently, Shirley was so precocious that she ended up memorizing the lines of each character in her movies. ""Betsy Ware,"" by the way, is another guise Barbara assumes in honor of a favorite book character. Gloria Stuart comes in as Peck's secretary, and to insert some grown up romance, her character is avidly pursued by Barbara's father (Michael Whelan).

It's all agreeable fluff, of course, the only disturbing element being the occasional incursions of the neighborhood stalker, not that we really think he poses a threat. In a Shirley Temple movie, creepy asshats like him just don't exist.

POOR LITTLE RICH GIRL has other things going for it, besides Shirley Temple. Jack Haley's hoofing and Alice Faye's warm contralto are two more reasons. ""When I'm With You"" is a grand song, and I love the climactic number, ""I Like A Military Man,"" which features a fantastic extended tap sequence from Dolan, Dolan, and Dolan. I'm used to Haley and Temple being light on their feet, but it's a delightful treat to see Alice Faye execute the steps with so much panache. So, see, sometimes, you DON'T get upstaged when in a Shirley Temple film.",1308960000,4,3450,4.830795262267343

565122,5,6303095011,"This is one of Shirley's best movies. Why it is not on DVD; I will never know.

With Jack Haley, the Tin-Man from the Wizard of Oz.

Little Shirley becomes separated and lost from her nanny in the big city; with a sinister, crook trailing her.

Jack Haley is a poor, down on his luck entertainer, who is humorously and mercilessly needled by his wife, Alice Faye.

Shot on some nice locations, especially the beautiful home.

Humor, suspense, and some song and dance in an interesting story. Charming.",1286668800,4,501,4.6477272727272725
565123,5,6303095011,"Poor Little Rich Girl is a charming Shirley Temple vehicle with superb performances by Jack Haley and Alice Fay, too. Filmed in glorious black and white, the plot unfolds at a very good pace; and the musical numbers are so well done it's impossible to feel bored watching this film. The choreography and the cinematography are excellent and the script was well written. There's a fair amount of character development but the song and dance numbers really take the spotlight.

When the film starts, we quickly meet little Barbara Barry (Shirley Temple), who lives a rather pampered but solitary existence in her wealthy workaholic father's mansion. Barbara's father Richard (Michael Whalen) is very busy with his soap company and he keeps up to date with all the latest advertising tricks including radio shows to promote his brand of soap. However, one day Richard Barry is persuaded by a household servant to let Barbara go to a school her late mother attended; and Richard agrees. He wants Barbara to be with other children.

What no one knows, however, is that these plans are soon to be scuttled by unanticipated events. Barbara's nurse is accidentally killed by an oncoming car just outside Grand Central Station in New York; and Barbara, not knowing this because she has stayed inside the train station, walks away innocently and decides she will go on a ""vacation."" She then meets an organ grinder and his family; and it isn't much longer before she then meets vaudeville performers turned radio show hopefuls Jimmy Dolan (Jack Haley) and his wife Jerry (Alice Faye)--and Barbara, now referred to as Bonnie Dolan, joins their act for what the small child thinks is the pure fun of it.

There's even more to the story up to this point and--afterwards--but I won't add too much to spoil it for you. How will Barbara ever be reunited with her father; and how do things go after Barbara joins Jimmy and Jerry? Sure, parts of the story are a little bit contrived but it's very enjoyable to watch this film anyway.

Look for fine performances by Gloria Stuart as Margaret Allen, an assistant to Barry's rival soap manufacturer, Simon Peck (Claude Gillingwater). Henry Armetta is just great as Tony the organ grinder; and John Wray plays the mysterious and threatening Flagin, a man who for some unknown reason is following Barbara rather closely, probably with bad intentions.

I recommend this film for fans of Shirley Temple and the other actors in it; and people who enjoy classic musicals from the 1930s will not be disappointed.",1279929600,,2534,4.883720930232558
565124,4,6303095011,"Why haven't Poor Little Rich Girl and Our Little Girl been released on DVD? For those of us who have grown up watching these movies and are trying to complete our collection in DVDs, I'm afraid we might be dead before somebody decides to finally release them. It's no wonder people resort to burning their own DVDs or buying them from overseas to complete their collections.
Come on MGM, please release these last two movies so we can complete our collections. If you were smart, you would have worked out a deal with Paramount and released their two and your last 2 in one set. As it is, I've already purchased the two from them and am just waiting for these now.",1264636800,10,664,4.450819672131147
565125,5,6303095011,"Here is another very nice Shirley Temple film, one of the above-average ones for her (and most of hers were above-average to start with!). This one featured really nice characters, downplayed the villain, and had a lot of songs.

It didn't have as much tap dancing as I would like to have seen, but it did feature a prolonged dance at the end with Shirley, Jack Haley and Alice Faye.

The villain was some mysterious dude who was either a child molester or a kidnapper. It was never really explained. Thankfully, he had a small role. Otherwise, it was all good people and fun ones to watch. I like seeing Gloria Stuart in her early days, too.

And.....where else but a Shirley Temple movie, would you have a song called ""You've Got To Eat Your Spinach, Baby?""",1239321600,,759,4.525547445255475
565126,4,6303095011,"If you feel silly watching Shirley Temple films without a child, watch this one. Jack Haley and the wonderful and sexy Alice Faye are superb. There's a dark aspect with one character stalking Shirley (rather unsettling). Everyone is terrific in the film and I believe it to be Shirley Temple's best movie. I agree with one reviewer about the cruel dispatching of the nurse Collins. It was either the result of clumsy writing or editing. Otherwise this is one enjoyable, bouncy film.",1192665600,,482,4.890243902439025
565127,4,6303095011,"THE POOR LITTLE RICH GIRL is one of Shirley Temple's most delightful offerings.  She plays Barbara Barry, the daughter of a rich soap manufacturer (Michael Whalen).  While being taken off to boarding school, her governess is run down by a car and in the confusion Barbara wanders off into the city.  Taking on the persona of her favourite storybook character Betsy Ware, she moves in with a pair of vaudeville hoofers (Alice Faye, Jack Haley) and joins their act.  Hilarity ensues when the troupe is employed by a rival soap company, and Barbara's other life is exposed.

This movie is a real charmer.  Shirley sings ""Oh My Goodness"" as her dolls come to life and dance for her, as well as her classic ""Spinach Baby"" and ""When I'm with You"".  The finale dance of ""Military Man"" is another highpoint.  Alice Faye sings the delightful ballad ""But Definitely"".

With Gloria Stuart, Jane Darwell and Sara Haden.",1123200000,10,907,4.8
565128,5,6303095011,"This in my opinon is a hidden Temple gem and even if your not a Temple fan and enjoy watching movies with your kids or grandchildren this one to rent or buy.

A good cast and a happy ending make this movie worth buying. Of course, there is a lot of cute music, cheerful dances, and lovable moments. The cast in this one is perfectly cast and I fell in love with Shirley's widower father--for you feel that on-screen chemistry that many of hollywood's leading men had with little Shirley. Shirley's ""debut"" dad does a great job and Hayley does a good job as what becomes Shirley's foster dad. You also see the old grump from Bright Eyes make an apparence in this movie. So, you have a great cast in this corner.

Lots of good songs and dance numbers make this movie so charming.

Temple is simply charming and captiviating in this one- once again you see all that on-screen charisma. This Shirley movie is not to be missed a great treasure and a must-see for any temple fan.",1106697600,6,973,4.394444444444445
