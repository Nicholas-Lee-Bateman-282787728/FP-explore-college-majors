1222806,5,B00000ILEA,"Not much to say that hasn't been said in the above reviews already; Waking Ned Devine is THE best movie I've seen in about 5 years, better than Titanic in some respects, and I really liked that movie, so I gladly give  it 5 stars!",928454400,2,230,4.111111111111111
1222807,5,B00000ILEA,"Funny and wholesome movie that features fine acting and breathtaking views from the Isle of Man,which is located between Ireland and England.  The interaction between the two main characters, who live in a tiny village and  the ""lotto man"" from Dublin is priceless. The villagers are hard  pressed to use all their cultural traits to work their way out of a  difficult situation.",924998400,,379,4.968253968253968
1222808,5,B00000ILEA,It's very refreshing to go to a movie and be so pleasantly entertained.  The music and scenery were wonderful and the story line very enjoyable.,923270400,,144,4.76

1222814,5,B00000ILEA,"Watch it - you will love it or hate it!  Listen closely as the Irish brogue is the real thing and there are many times we have to ""rewind"" to catch some of the funniest quips. It's a story that starts as one of slight greed and becomes one of sharing and compassion - with lots of funny twists along the way. It is a timeless piece of work!",1519084800,,340,3.927536231884058

1222816,5,B00000ILEA,"Waking Ned (titled Waking Ned Devine in North America) is a 1998 British black comedy film.  The start is a little slow, but it is worth the wait to see what happens to Ned's (a dead man) lottery winnings and how it effects the whole village.  So if you enjoy British black comedies, I think you will enjoy this film as well.  The film is actually filmed on the Isle of Man, not Ireland, but the scenes and village of Cregneash are charming.  The music in the film is also very nice, although I have read that some people have had sound issues on their DVDs, however my DVD did not have this issue.",1517356800,,598,4.219298245614035
1222817,5,B00000ILEA,This is a very funny movie - but one has to watch it all the way to the very end to totally appreciate the clever humor. My 13 year old and his 11 year old friend laughed so hard at the very end.,1516924800,,195,3.558139534883721

1222820,5,B00000ILEA,"If you've been to the Irish Countryside, this is a must see.  Truly heart-warming.  Makes you want to slide into a seat at the local pub with your pals.",1511913600,,152,4.206896551724138

1222826,5,B00000ILEA,"This is one movie that you do not want to dive into the detail as it is fun to be surprised as it unfolds. Basically it looks as though some lucky sod in the village has won the lottery. The trick is to find out who it was. Then if found what chain of circumstances will it trigger.

I about died laughing before the beginning credits and could not contain my self to the end. One thing led to another the snowballed out of hand. I could not believe the actors could keep a straight face.

Now before you get the worn idea and thing this is some slapstick comedy or some Monty Python script. You would be wrong. This film give you the feel that you are there experiencing a small snippet of real live in a small village. This has depths like ""Ladies in Lavender""; there are many underlying stories of the individuals and you want ton see how they play out. You will not be disappointed.",1507248000,2,886,4.236686390532545

1222829,5,B00000ILEA,"Quite funny! Good casting. Plus it's clean...no sex, violence, cursing. ""Jesus"" and ""God "" are each said several times, however. And there is one shot of some elderly backsides.
Just wish there were more like this out there!!",1504915200,,225,4.947368421052632

1222835,5,B00000ILEA,"Real conversation on the phone with my bf when we were trying to decide what movie to watch later:
Me: Have you ever seen ""Waking Ned Devine?""
Him: I don't think so; what's it about?
Me: This old Irish dude who wins the lottery, but then before he can collect, he dies. ...It's a comedy.
(Later, after we watched it, he told me he thought I was being sarcastic, and he was surprised it was actually a comedy.)
This movie is hilarious. A real gem :)",1503446400,,448,4.22093023255814

1222844,5,B00000ILEA,"While I agree with the negative reviews that this film takes a long time to get going and that the Irish brogue is nearly impossible for an English ear to follow, this all changes for the better soon enough.

The main star in this one is Ireland, the people, the humor, the music and the scenery.  The plot is simple and straightforward - like the Irish themselves - so the devious element is all the more charming.  No fist fights or drunken brawls, tho there's a lot of drinking.  In fact one leaves the film wondering if most of the jackpot will be spent at fitzgerald's pub.

The acting is superb and best of all there is nothing of the American crap that has pretty much destroyed film.  The crime , the jealousy and the sex are all quite innocent and best of all the Irish eyes are smiling.

Highly recommended.",1500336000,,817,4.370860927152318

But the sound was terrible!!! (And I have a pretty good sound system.)
I watched with my sisters and they could barely make out the dialog.

1222880,5,B00000ILEA,"Loved this movie! It certainly brings to mind the old adage of ""oh what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive."" My only criticism is basically one that cannot be helped. Those of us who watch the movie who are not Irish might have a hard time understanding the conversations. For me the first 10 minutes of the movie might as well have been spoken in an alien language. I could only catch a few words here and there. But eventually my ear tuned in to the rhythm and structure of the Irish brogue and I thoroughly enjoyed the rest of the movie. It is study of human nature; the foibles, friendships and fierce devotion of a small Irish village inhabitants.",1486252800,3,674,4.4

1223643,5,B00000ILEA,"This DVD was released in 2001, before 16x9 TVs became commonplace.  Therefore it is letterboxed, meaning you will have black bars on all 4 sides of the picture if you watch it on a widescreen TV.  The result is a relatively tiny picture.  You can, depending on the capabilities of your DVD or Blu-ray player, adjust the aspect ratio to fill the sides of the screen.  In my case, I set my player to ""Full"" mode.  Luckily the transfer is pretty good, so the picture looks OK when you do that; it isn't washed out, like other letterboxed movies are when you change the aspect ratio (sometimes called ""Zoom"", depending, again, on your player).  An oddity is that the main menu is in 16x9 format!

It's time for Criterion or someone to re-release this terrific film in true widescreen format, since the movie is so beloved.

I won't get into the movie itself much, other than to say it is one you will likely watch more than once, more than twice.  The other reviews here explain very well just how wonderful and charming this film is.  I just wanted to point out the one glaring flaw with this old DVD transfer.

1223782,4,B00000ILEA,"This is a delightful, short (one and a half hours), whimsical little tale that seems like it very well could have been based on a true story (a part of me hopes that it was!).  Some moments are typical dry British/Irish wit whilst others are sheer hilarity - imagine a scrawny geriatric Irishman racing as fast as he can through the Irish countryside on a motorbike wearing absolutely nothing save for a helmet and goggles plus his boots, for example!  Although the main surface subject regards how this very small, quaint Irish town (Tullymore) collectively deals with lottery winnings, THE STORY REALLY IS CENTERED UPON THOSE THINGS WHICH TRULY MATTER IN LIFE (not money).  Plus, if you're somewhat the musical type, it has a very nice soundtrack (not ""excellent,"" but ""very nice"").  The movie opens dramatically with The Waterboys' 1988 ""Fisherman's Blues"" (which, if I recall correctly, was more of a 90s hit?).  The rest is filled with more traditional tunes.  Give it a try if you haven't already!",1474329600,6,1003,4.905325443786983

1223811,5,B00000ILEA,"A classic.  I love this gentle, clever comedy.  It is a welcome antidote to the current fashion of snarky, seven-layers of irony comedies, where none of the characters have ever loved anything.  Fifty souls in a quiet village, given a chance to make some of their dreams come true, seize it in the quirky way that seems natural to them.",1473638400,,336,4.566666666666666

1223844,4,B00000ILEA,"Delightful Irish farce with some standout performances. There are mistaken identities, car chases, comically bad fashion choices, many pints hoisted, and a classic eulogy.

The scenery is gorgeous. I loved the music and the actors - especially the one who rode his motorcycle stark naked. For that, the plot should have come true for him in real life.

The one scene that impressed me starts with an abrupt cut to somebody slamming a chicken on a table. I had the idea they were going to read its entrails, perhaps to interpret a dream? I don't know. The fluffy white feathers on the dark wood table made a pretty picture.

It seems to me like a fairy tale, too, but with a twist. In fairy tales, the witch dies at the end to punish her for doing evil.",1463961600,,589,4.104347826086957

If you liked My Big Fat Greek Wedding, you'll like Waking Ned Devine, and for pretty much the same reasons.  Intelligently well written, wonderfully acted, the characters are rich and fully engaging, feeling like real people you could meet in real life, become great friends with, and never want to lose.  And the two main characters are comedic geniuses, mastering everything from subtle visual humor to snarky comebacks.  And if you love Ireland, the old-world village will keep you dreaming of your next vacation.

This is one of the movies where I'm always surprised people haven't seen it and find myself telling them ""you HAVE to see this! Watch it this weekend!""

It's definitely highly recommended for a romantic comedy movie, and if you don't mind some tasteful bits about a skinny old man driving a moped, I'd say it's safe for the whole family, lol. Amazing movie.",1455235200,,599,4.486238532110092

I mean, who wants to watch a movie about a bunch of old people and the lottery?! But this film really won me over with its charm and heart. Since my first viewing it's become one of my favorites, a film I find myself returning to whenever I'm down or even just bored.

In this case, it's the power of friendship and laughing together. I first saw this film in my ""Comedy, Tragedy, and Religion"" course in undergrad, and it remains an all-time favorite because all of those themes are touched on.

I was told by you to go ahead and open it because it would play in English. Just last week I opened the DVD and tried to play it. A message appeared saying ""THIS DISC CANNOT BE PLAYED IN YOUR REGION."" I live in Salt Lake City, Utah

I rented this movie last year from Netflix and was able to play it just fine. ""Waking Ned Devine"" is a great movie. That's why I wanted my own copy. If I return it, would you be able to find and send an English version that can be played in the United States?",1428451200,,627,4.016

1226128,5,B00000ILEA,"Waking Ned Devine is hilarious.  It is an Irish movie about the shenanigans of Ned Devines fellow villagers during their frenzy to cash in on Neds windfall after he dies of shock with the winning lottery ticket in his hand.  The aerial shots of the countryside and quaint village are delightful, and the gaunt motley actors are fantastic in their portrayal of the townsfolk.  The Irish accent was sometimes a little difficult for our American ears to decipher, but thankfully, we were able to back up and replay the few problematic scenes.  The segment of Neds naked friends racing on bicycles to cajole the rest of the villagers to agree with their devious plan and the segment of the final hurrah of the villages female curmudgeon are rib ticklers for the ages.",1426896000,,763,4.757575757575758

Whatever it was it that led me to it, Waking Ned Devine has become one of those movies I watch on a regular basis. It has become like a member of an extended cinema family of sorts. It has a cinema warmth and internal light to it of sorts in common with movies like Groundhog Day and It's a Wonderful Life.

1227045,4,B00000ILEA,I liked this movie as a lighthearted story.  It was not credible but it was entertaining.  It took me a while to watch  because I cannot sit and watch a movie all at once due to other activities I have to do.  I  would recommend to anyone who needs a smile from behavior connected with a lucky lottery ticket.,1397606400,,309,4.169491525423729

Finally, two old best friends set out to find just who amoung the village's 49 adults was the winner, as no one is speaking up. What follows is a hilariously funny and touching story of how the winner is discovered and how in the world the winning check can be claimed. The two best friends have a big problem on their hands as they must enlist every person's help--except for a zany, cranky old lady nicknamed 'the witch' b who tries to foil the 'happy ending.' Be sure to watch at least the first third of the movie because you will not see the twist in the movie's story coming, then you will really be hooked to discover how it all will end!

You will not soon forget the sight of an eighty-plus year old man riding a motorcycle starkers, as the locals might have said, except for his helmet.

Everyone  hopes they have the winning combination as they anxiously watch the drawing. By the next morning everyone in the tiny fishing village knows one of their neighbors is the winner.  The gossip train starts and so do the antics.  Along the way we get glimpses into the lives of friends, acquaintances and even those who tend to make life challenging.  Hopes rise and you'll find you have been drawn into the story as if you were one of the townspeople.  The undercurrent of the movie makes a statement of what community can be about...of what people can do when they band together with a common cause.  More than that, it shares a subtle statement of the value of friendship.",1396224000,,803,4.612676056338028

Their schemes to represent the no longer living Ned to secure the winnings for initially their benefit tines to the towns as well. Humorous and quaint, the film captures much of a small town Irish tradition. The scene of the two older men going into the cold ocean reminded me of seeing elderly folk swinging in the Atlantic 8 miles south of Dublin near the James Joyce tower. The ending is quite a surprise and dramatic. A far fetched story but all the more fun.",1395446400,,657,4.529411764705882

1227159,3,B00000ILEA,"The movie was worth my time, though I wouldn't (and didn't) go in expecting major laughs.  The premise, in my opinion reads funnier than it plays out on screen.  But I also imagine there are people who would laugh out loud (maybe even myself in another mood)... as well as those who, like me, saw enough to like that we didn't depend on hilarity to sustain it.

The characters, if not exactly models of integrity are (mostly) likable, with one rather over-the-top exception who was necessary for the all-important conflict element of a screenplay. This character, the main *unlikable* one, ironically seemed also to be the only honest one, a point over which some viewers may object with chants of ""glorifying liars and cheats"". But I didn't see the liars and cheats as evil or malicious, so if one needs a moral message in their entertainment, this won't necessarily get in the way. The relationships between them is at times touching, the plot is clever and the acting is fine.  I just couldn't get excited about the package as a whole.

It's a simple and pleasant film, set in a small Irish village with some beautiful scenery, and isn't like any movie I'd seen before... those are +s.  On the downside, I had a little trouble understanding some of the character's lines because of the fairly heavy Irish accents, and it was a bit slow for me. But I did laugh a number of times, and smiled a lot.

I suspect it won't appeal to younger audiences, as most of the actors have probably seen at least some of the 1940s. And do not look for action here! Well, except for one darkly amusing scene that sets up the movie's happy ending -- if you like that sort of thing.",1395100800,,1665,4.53

1227162,5,B00000ILEA,It was a cute show. It showed a community coming together. Though it showed fraud to government they all were poor and needed help. Most likely what they did is what Ned Devine would have really done anyway.  Too much wealth can corrupt a person but giving in the end is what's needed.,1394841600,,285,4.377358490566038
1227163,5,B00000ILEA,This a charming Irish tale told in a family way. The music alone is a haunting rendition of old and new irish tunes that make the sound track alone worth buying it.

These days it seems that straight comedies aren't made anymore.  For instance, My Cousin Vinnie and City Slickers were not really romantic comedies.  They didn't revolve heavily around the relationship of a man and  a woman.  I realize Waking Ned Devine is not new, but if you haven't seen it and you want to view a comedy that isn't just a romantic comedy, this is the one for you.  Yet it's still a great date movie.

1227410,5,B00000ILEA,"This movie remains one of my all time favorites and I enjoy it each time just as much as the very first time I saw it. It combines the elements of comedy, death, love, the inquisitiveness of human nature, and the spirit of community in the small Irish village of Tulaigh Mor (Tullymore).

When it is announced that the winner of the Irish Lottery is from this tiny village, curiosity gets the better of its inhabitants, especially two older fellows - Jackie and Michael - and they are determined to find out just who the lucky person is. They embark on a comical attempt to find just who has won by serving a chicken dinner with plenty of whiskey. By the end of the dinner, everyone is well fed and feeling garrulous from drink, but it becomes apparent that none of the villagers is admitting to holding the winning ticket. When one piece of chicken remains, it becomes obvious one resident of the village was not in attendance - Ned Devine.

A late night visit to take Ned his chicken dinner reveals that Ned has died of a heart attack with the winning lottery ticket still in his hand. This starts a ruse to pretend that Ned is still alive and Jackie and Michael begin to spin their story that will enable one of them to claim the prize and share it with all of the village's inhabitants. All goes well until one of the villagers, a crabby old woman that no one likes, decides to report the sham and claim a huge chunk of the lottery winning for herself for reporting the scam. The lottery winnings total nearly 7 million pounds, enough to provide each villager with a nice nest egg if only the village residents unanimously can agree to the ruse, but the one crabby old crone proves to be the proverbial fly in the ointment.

The ensuing story is clever and witty, offering up a charming glimpse into the life of a rural Irish community. There is also a love story that offers a most unexpected twist at the end, leaving the viewer with a surprise about Ned Devine that even his closest friends never knew. There is also a twist of fate that leaves the village's would be tattletale in an unexpected but delightfully funny predicament. I can't say what, but it is hilarious.

The final scene always brings tears to my eyes as the villagers stand together raising a parting glass to their departed friend while the Irish song ""The Parting Glass"" is delivered in a rousing and emotionally powerful rendition.

This movie is one that offers up a clever story line without the profanity and vulgarity that seem to permeate most films, so it is one that can be enjoyed by the family. An endearing comedy that is sure to please. I give it two thumbs up!!",1380412800,,2651,4.480331262939958
1227411,5,B00000ILEA,"If someone told you to make a movie about a small town, a lottery, and with no special effects, could you shoot it & sell it? Cause Kirk Jones did, and created a classic. Theo Logos wrote a great description/review of this movie, and said many of the things I wanted to, but in a much better way, so read his.

1227464,1,B00000ILEA,"Predictable plot, fairly canned humor, and contrived story about dishonesty winning out in the end. Pretty lame movie, actually.  Ireland deserves better.",1377907200,3,154,6.0
1227465,5,B00000ILEA,"Like most things the Brits produce, this is a wonderful movie.  The acting, use of music, and the humor are all vastly superior to anything coming out of Hollywood today.

A thoroughly enjoyable movie.  There is a bit of nudity as an old, wrinkled man, rides a motorcycle.  I thought it a humorous commentary on the gratuitous nudity and sexual titillation in American films.",1377907200,,375,4.8125

1227471,2,B00000ILEA,I just couldn't get into it probably because it was non-American.  It didn't keep my interest so I didn't watch the entire movie as it was boring to me.  It was old fashion as well. I'm sure it probably was an uplifting story; just not for me. The acting was not all that good either. I cannot recommend this film to anyone.,1377734400,,324,4.209677419354839
1227472,4,B00000ILEA,Not perfect or compelling but quite enjoyable.  You have to buy in to the somewhat unbelievable premise.  We enjoyed it.,1377734400,,120,4.95

But that's the thing about this movie...these folks embrace life and death as a natural part of the human story that we're all in together. And there would be no greater group of people than these that I would want to share that story with. You'll find moments in this movie that you will be certain you've never seen before and will be falling off your seat laughing, then ten minutes later will suddenly have a catch in your throat at a bittersweet moment that you wouldn't have missed for the world. So don't miss ""Ned Devine."" It's just what the doctor ordered.",1377734400,,697,4.453125

1227477,5,B00000ILEA,"Great story. Great for the whole family. Complex relationships in a small village dealing with a very unusual situtiation.

I especially like that the characters look ""non-Hollywood"": They look like ordinary people, young, old, in between, not overly ""pretty"" or Hollywood ""picture perfect"".  The actors look and act pretty much like normal people might, wrinkles and all -- while telling a very engaging story.",1377734400,,411,5.40625

1227494,5,B00000ILEA,"Excellent movie in all aspects: storyline, acting, production: and the soundtrack is one of the all-time greats. This movie is best watched with closed-caption because of the thick Irish brogue (you don't want to miss any of the simple humor).

1227519,5,B00000ILEA,"I had heard of this film quite a while ago. But chose to ignore it because it didn't catch my attention. Now as a more mature adult who had zero idea of the true tale. I loved it start to finish!!! I wasn't looking to laugh as much as I did! Also a lot of nail biting and for once good guys win. It takes a lot to get to the finishing line but they get there! now im going to add this new go to movie in my collection! If it weren't for amazon prime I think I would still be Ned Levineless! Awesome! actors great believable , scenery amazing great story telling! it is pushing to be in my top 25 movies! don't take it seriously but seriously enough to enjoy it! you will see what I mean as it goes on. for those who didn't like it...Its a tale truth woven in a lot but whimsical ideas are in there too.  awesome! or as we Bostonians say ""oh my Gawd that was wicked awesome!""",1376870400,,874,3.937853107344633

1227521,4,B00000ILEA,"I liked this movie, because it is different then the usual same old, same old movies. I actually enjoyed it more the second time (when I was watching it with my husband), and noticed things I didn't notice first time.
If you want to retire to a small Irish town, this movie is the must, so you will know how your life will look like (minus the Lotto excitement).",1376784000,,362,4.260869565217392

1227530,5,B00000ILEA,"When American movies have nude scenes, they are with beautiful people with body doubles or digitally enhanced to make them perfect.  But this isn't an American movie.  When you put two old men, one chubby, the other painfully skinny, naked on a beach, it's funny.  But if you put the skinny one on a motorcycle with goggles riding through the countryside, still naked, now that's really funny.  I suppose this is an Irish movie, but it's pretty much like British comedies.  Not as silly as Monte Python, but still British.  It's a feel good movie that doesn't take up the whole night, and it will make you laugh.",1376524800,,612,4.62037037037037

1227551,5,B00000ILEA,"A beautiful, subtle yet very funny look at what a group of people can accomplish when they work together.
With the heavy burden of how to handle coming into a large amount of money, a couple and their good friend progress through stages of possibility while enduring some hilarious circumstances and come out the other side with a selfless solution which considers the perceived wishes of their deceased friend and the community as a whole.
The way they play the system - and one obstinate member of the community - is a victory for the 'little guy.' Yet part of the moral of this story is also that though money is necessary and grand to have to alieve some of the hardships of life, there are indeed things that are more important than having it all.  Having enough along with friends, family and character are quite sufficient and most likely better.

1227750,5,B00000ILEA,"'Waking Ned Devine' is the gold and diamonds of the film world, It is gentle, heart warming, heart stopping,and screamingly funny by turns. It never stoops to the crude, so you can enjoy with your six year old or your granny. It has a touch of Irish magic, and more than a touch of beautiful haunting Irish music. 'Waking Ned' is a phenomenon that stays in your heart long after you have seen it, and maybe even stays  for ever. It thoroughly explores the gamut of human emotion from stunting greed to to incredible soaring generosity and of course the ancient wonderful joys of human love and friendship.

'Waking Ned' is set in rural Ireland, but filmed on the Isle of Man, and the breath taking Manx scenery is used to wonderful effect. Everyone should have this film on their 'bucket list', and everyone should give  themselves the opportunity to witness  the something truly wonderful and awesome, that is 'Waking Ned'",1360022400,,923,4.714285714285714

1227931,5,B00000ILEA,This movie is fun time after time. I liked it more the second and third time watching. There are some classic comic moments that had me hooting with laughter. It's very authentic - Irish actors are cast rather than English or American with bad accents. The story is different with some interesting twists. The characters in the village are deliciously quirky.,1352764800,,359,4.901639344262295

But it's a must-see for all of us, with the chance of a life time within reach. The story of a village in the middle of nowhere, where out of nowhere, the jackpot has been won. By who ? The search for this lucky sod is the start of hilarious film, with a deep true undercurrent. Ned Devine takes a sharp look at greed, temptation and gossip. It has a double barrel ending, that will make you smile afterwards and make you wonder what you would do, if...
Besides, you should not miss this, if only for the sight of  David Kelly stark naked speeding on his motorcycle !

It's so hard to pick my favorite scenes, although the pnone box falling over the cliff was great, not to mention seeing David Kelly riding a motorcycle in the ""all-together"" was pretty hilarious also.

It's one of the very best I've ever seen, and I tend to be easily critical of most efforts in this art form. Of particular note is the casting. Brilliant, simply brilliant. I can't imagine anyone else playing the characters we are so lucky to meet in this Irish village. Likewise, the musical score was absolutely charming.

Lots of lovely, funny, human performances. If you're looking for a warm, gentle film you can settle down and watch with a nice cup of tea, this is it!",1346889600,,467,3.978723404255319

Its plot could apply to any contry and any small town where people know each other. So as not to reveal the clever story line, I'll just say that it deals with how newfound wealth affects a tiny community on a seaside corner of the Emerald Isle.

Then, I let a co-worker borrow the movie.  She made the mistake of watching it late at night.  She laughed so hard she woke her mother, who almost called the cops.

The sight of an old naked man on a motorcycle emotionally may be too much to handle.  Beware.

This is a film you can watch over and over.  It is very funny and also poignant.  I've probably watched it 15 times, and I still gasp-for-breath laugh at the scene of the seventy-something Michael O'Sullivan (played with brilliancy by David Kelly) tearing down the muddy road on his moter scooter wearing nothing but his helmet, socks and shoes.

And then there's the touching eulogy Jackie O'Shea (the equally brilliant Ian Bannen) gives for his best friend Michael - while Michael sits in the congregation listening.

There is a distinct guilty pleasure at seeing the end of the despicable Lizzy Quinn. Really, one shouldn't cheer at the awful accident that happens to her near the end of the film  -  but I don't know anyone who doesn't.

And the thing is, what the townspeople do is wrong  -  cheating the lotto?!!  -  but I so love the rogues, aging but they still have it, that I can't hold it against them. This is PG family entertainment for the whole family, but it is not dumbed down, sophomoric or simple.

The one that comes to mind for Waking Ned Devine is a senior citizen riding naked through the countyside on a motorcycle, but, strangely, it makes perfect sense in the context of this very funny, quirky film.

In other words, we responded exactly as we did when we first watched it in the initial theater release.  Ned wanted his town of 49 adults to have his lottery winnings and the scheme launched because of a dream, amoral and contrived though it is, remains a pleasure to watch unfold. I spent a fair amount of the movie trying to place Fionnula Flanagan, wife of the chief architect of the fraud.  Only as the closing credits ran did it come to me -- Daniel Faraday's mother Eloise Hawking in Lost.

1228206,2,B00000ILEA,"A small town of 49 adults has a lotto ticket winner amongst them but who could it be? When the first-act concludes we find out who our winner is and therein lies the premise: Will 48-adults go along with a scheme so as to ensure that the ""winner"" and the rest of the town folks can collect?

I ended up disliking the majority of this small town community and became convince that this ""slice of life"" plotting was nothing short of Irish bashing! Every single sequence has somebody drinking and acting very ""rural"" so to speak.  An example using AMerican cinema would be to compare the way African AMericans were portrayed in 1970's cop shows; nothing but cliches and stereotypes.

The premise was strong but the writing was weak. So many plot twists and conflicts could have been played out but instead it simply march down the road through both the second and third acts making this film nothing more than a rural slice of life with only one over-the-top ""bad guy"" instead of myriad of self interested characters.

Imagine the plot twists and the ""game theory"" politics that could occur between 49-people when over 6,890,00 are involved? Obviously the writer couldn't for he just made one antagonist.

To my horror when the ""bad guy"" gets their ""just reward"" attempting to take the self-interested moral high ground, the town folk are drinking away celebrating that the end of their scheme and the rewards it brought played out. I am not Irish but I was convinced this movie was simply made to hold the Irish up as both cute and stupid!

I commend the actors for making such anemic dialog work, but the writing lacked, and the director and producer should have demanded more from the plot.",1298073600,8,1690,4.6925675675675675

I even believe that the Water Horse is still there in the lake, bigger now no doubt, but still pleased to come whenever a boy whistles.

The scenery was breath-taking; the music was hauntingly beautiful. The funeral scene, the final song, oh, just everything about it was so solid and good. Lots of little treasures, too: like when the main character is giving a speech and his wife silently steps through the door into the back of the room. The change in him while he continues the speech - the quiet love in his eyes - it is a lovely thing to experience. And let me just add that the experience is so worth repeating.

This simple tale of likeable folk who conspire to commit grand larceny is a real feel-good comedy.  Bannen and Kelly are irresistible and had me under their spell from the beginning.

It's safe for kids and even the famous naked motorcycle ride was innocent enough to elicit a hearty laugh by my grandmother.

1228265,5,B00000ILEA,"I first saw this movie back in 2000, when I was a lad of twenty. Having become fixated on Irish music and culture, a passion I still have to this day, I was encouraged to watch this movie by a lady friend. It ended up on my Christmas list. At the time, however, I didn't have a DVD player, so the movie was still on VHS.
  The story of Waking Ned is at once simple and at the same time complicated. It takes place in a small village off the coast of Ireland, one of those places where everybody knows just about everybody else. Reminds me of my parents' home town in Wisconsin, though considerably smaller. This Irish village, however, seems composed largely of elderly folk with a few youngsters thrown into the mix. They live simple, easy lives, playing the lottery without necessarily expecting to win.
  Things get complicated when it's discovered that the winner of the most recent lottery is a member of this small community. Lifelong friends Jackie O'Shea (played by the late Ian Bannen), and Michael O'Sullivan (David Kelly), decide to find out who the winner is and make sure they're that person's best friends when they go to claim the money. Things become much less clear-cut, however, when Jackie discovers that the winner, Ned Devine, died of a heart attack brought on by the shock of discovering he'd become a millionaire. Not to be dissuaded, Jackie persuades Michael to help him in a scheme to impersonate Ned and claim the winnings. Rather than keeping it all for themselves however, Jackie decides to divide the money among all the residents of the village in response to what he believes is a vision from Ned. Ned, a kind and generous man in life, would probably have done exactly this had he lived to claim the money, so Jackie decides to go ahead with the scheme. The tricky part of course is convincing the entire village to go along with the whole thing. Matters are almost put to rest before they really get started when the man from the lottery shows up much sooner than expected, forcing Jackie, who had originally intended to impersonate Ned, to lay the burden on a reluctant Michael's shoulders. Michael, with no other options, rides his motorcycle, buck naked, from the beach where the two were rehearsing for the interview, all the way back to Ned's place while Jackie delays the man from Dublin.
  All in all Waking Ned is definitely my idea of what a commedy should be, not too heavily reliant on crude jokes and profanity. In other words, true humor. Add to it the potential stumbling block of Lizzie Quinn, the village's resident grinch, and the subplot of the romance between Pig Finn, the local pig farmer, and Maggie, the farmer's daughter, and what you have is a delightfully lighthearted Irish tale of tragedy and triumph mixed liberally with humor. The musical score is particularly fitting near the very end of the film, which details the opposite fates of the villagers and Lizzie Quinn simultaneously. The film ends with a triumphantly beautiful rendition of The Parting Glass, one of my absolute favorite Irish tunes.
  So all in all, I found this to be an excellent film and can't wait to own it on DVD.",1246406400,,3148,4.669675090252707

Jackie & Annie O'Shea, and the rest of the village of Tullaigh Mhor, dream of a better life.

The church coffers could do with some fillin'.

When their beloved friend, Ned Devine, passes suddenly, a chance for all their dreams to be realized.  Mean, nasty, rotten Lizzie Quinn -- and a sneezy lottery agent from Dublin -- stands in the way of their dreams.

Waking Ned Devine is clever, funny, and extremely charming.  It is a first-rate comedy.  Incredibly, it is both hysterical and kid-friendly.  It's is one of my favorite little movies of all time.

1228391,5,B00000ILEA,"This is a truly delightful story, with so many little gems that make it worth while watching - more than once.  The acting is so real and natural that you soon start to feel that you know the characters personally.  They come right into your living room, sit beside you, tickle you and make you laugh.  If not an outright loud laugh, it is often a good chuckle (which is often more satisfying anyway).  Apart from the dialogue, just the wink of an eye or a shrug of the shoulder brings so much pleasure.  It has just a touch of the old Irish sentimentality; and quite apart from the hilarious plot, the underlying themes of genuine friendship and community gives you the feeling of nostalgia for the old days when people had time for that kind of thing.  Yes, there is sentimentality, but it is of the quiet, self-deprecating kind and never threatens to take over and smother the story.  And there are some stereotypes - fiddlers and lots of Guinness flowing.  My favorite character - well, that's hard, but I do love the young pig farmer (who starts using fruity soaps in an effort to win the love of his life).

The dialogue rings true even when the film is mildly slapstick, the plot is simple but brings out many emotions and foibles and much hilarity. The humor never lets up, from the classic opening joke to the last shot. Even the black humor seems harmless enough; there is no malice in this film, only joy and love.

If you haven't seen it and don't know the plot, stop reading these reviews and any plot summary on the box before seeing it; it's way more fun if the story is unexpected.

However, I actually ended up really liking this movie, both for the way it intelligently used the very interesting science of game theory as well as the movie itself.  Waking Ned Devine is an independent film from Ireland (it was actually shot on the Isle of Man) about two friends in a very small Irish village (population 52).  After the town finds out that someone among them won the Irish national lottery, Jackie O'Shea (Ian Bannen), and his friend Michael O'Sullivan (David Kelly) try to find out who it was and hit them up for some of the cash.  Jackie is a bit of a slick player, who knows just how to get what he wants, while Michael is a more subdued guy who is kind of along for the ride.

Jackie soon finds out that a man from the village named Ned Devine won the money, but dropped dead from shock immediately after the announcement of the winning numbers.  He and Michael then devise an elaborate plan to collect the winnings.

The movie is surprisingly very funny, and while many Americans won't get all of it, seeing how a lot of it is very Irish-based humor, those that do are in for a treat.  The plot, while simple, is very well executed.

All in all, this movie may not be for everyone, but it is an enjoyable alternative to the big-budget films for a while.",1130803200,7,1364,4.338582677165355

The only hitch is that he is dead, and no one knows but his two chums. The antics of the two guys, along with the rest of the town's colourful characters, are the basis of the movie's humour and fun.

The characters and the actors portraying them are really what make the film, and make it something special. At times, the humour is quite slapstick, but mostly situational and carried by the actors themselves.

""Waking Ned Devine"" is a charming movie deserving of every praise. It is a great night's entertainment, and wonderfully crafted.

1228496,5,B00000ILEA,"In the tradition of movies like The Full Monty, comes a very funny story of lotteries, winners and losers in a small town in Ireland.

The small villa of Tully More, population 52, hides in the huge Irish hills; but a national event -the state lottery- takes this town out of anonymity when one of their residents buys the winning ticket.

Two old friends, Jackie and Michael, discover the good news. But now, they want to know the identity of the winner to convince him to share the prize with them.

Searching for clues and proofs to unmask the millionaire, these two get involved in hilarious situations. Until they finally find the only possible winner, still mysteriously quiet: Ned Devine.

But the surprise is, Ned has died of emotion when he finds out the News. Lottery certainly changed his life.

And before his body gets cold, a conspiracy is formed in Tully More to reclaim Ned's prize.

Joyous and picaresque, this movie smiles at optimism, celebrates friendship and provide us with sincere entertainment. The characters are a little cartoonish and eccentric but with a good heart, not an usual treat these days.

I can't say enough how refreshing it was to have a movie made for adults that did not involve a never ending stream of bloodshed, profanity, gratuitous nudity, and explosions.  It's a movie for grown-ups, but could be watch infront of your kids.  You also don't have to be beat over the head with the movie star of the month.

The signs are all there, and if you are sharp, you will soon start to catch them. First to make its appearance is the pot of gold, disguised as a winning lottery ticket held by some lucky neighbor in the tiny village of Tulaigh Morh. Next, you will discover that the two old men scheming for a piece of the action, blarney filled Jackie O'Shea (Ian Bannen) and his expressive faced scarecrow pal Michael O'Sullivan (David Kelly), are but thinly disguised mischievous leprechauns. You will meet a hog keeper (James Nesbitt) waiting for the kiss of a fair maid (Susan Lynch) to reveal him for the prince that he is, and an old hag so black hearted and malevolent that all know her as a witch. And when Ned Devine, the neighbor with the winning ticket, dies from the shock of it, his ghost appears to old Jackie in a dream, setting in motion a plan fanciful as any Puss in Boots ever dreamed of that has the whole village working to outwit the vigilance of the lottery board and the malevolence of the witch, to all claim a piece of the fortune at rainbow's end.
`Waking Ned Devine' will enchant you and make you laugh. From its opening scene until the last verse of The Parting Glass is sung, it will charm you and leave you with a smile, wanting to watch it again.

1228522,5,B00000ILEA,"The Brits are fantastic at making comedies populated with interesting, likable characters that you wouldn't mind sitting next to in a pew at the local church or tipping a cold one with at the local pub, depending on your preference. ""Waking Ned"" comes from a film tradition that delighted us with ""The Full Monty"" and more recently with ""Calendar Girls"".

This delightful story takes place in a small Irish village (population 52) and is enacted by a cast of actors that I previously wouldn't have been able to pick out of a police line-up.  But these are characters that you quickly come to identify with and care for, and despite the fact that they plan to pull off a small defrauding of the Irish Lottery, you not only want them to pull it off - you don't feel like they're engaging in particularly criminal behavior.  Particular Kudos go to Ian Bannen as the twinkly-eyed Jackie O'Shea who is scamming pretty much the entire movie, but doing it in such a way you almost wish you were there with him.  David Kelly is wonderful as the scrupulous Michael who ""never told a lie in his life"" but becomes central in the plot to impersonate dead lottery winner Ned Devine.  Fionnula Flanagan is also fantastic as Jackie's wife, Annie, who is the voice of ethics and morals to the scheming Jackie.  I'd say it's practically worth the price of admission just to see the opening scene between Jackie and Annie, and I enjoyed every minute after spent in the company of these wonderful characters.",1093305600,9,1489,4.66412213740458
1228523,5,B00000ILEA,"It's not often that I find a comedy that is both clean and entertaining, _Waking Ned Devine_ was one of those rare finds.

The story is about  a major lottery winning in a small Irish town. Two of the townsfolk; Jackie O'Shea and Michael O'Sullivan, after finding out that someone in their small town of 54 (If I remember correctly) has won the lottery, set about trying to find the winner and hopefully to cash in on the luck.

Unfortunately, the winner; Ned Devine, died from the shock of winning and so Jackie and Michael decide to claim the prize and share it among the whole village. Two obstacles stand in their way; the village 'witch' and the lottery official. There is also a subplot involving a local pig farmer and his sweetheart, who would marry him were it not for the stench and is about to get married to someone a lot less malodorous and richer.

Fortunately, this movie isn't as corny as one would expect, it really is funny without trying too hard to be. I rarely buy DVDs usually deciding to rent them first, but this one is definitely going into the collection because it's one of those feel-good movies that make you appreciate life even more.

1228569,5,B00000ILEA,"A not-to-be-missed movie about the collusion of the residents of a remote Irish village into getting the national lottery money to divide among themselves. Trouble is that the holder of the winning ticket died of shock with the winning ticket in his hand when he heard his numbers called off, so someone must pose in his place when the detective comes to verify the ID of the winner. Things get stickier and more problematic as layer upon layer of inventive Irish complications are added to the stew. The most memorable scene is probably the skinny old guy who plays the imposter, stark naked except for a helmet and boots, racing into town on a motorcycle to meet up with the lottery man to verify his bogus identity.
My favorite story about this movie has passed into family lore. I told my somewhat deaf mother she would surely enjoy it, and she persisted in mis-hearing me when I gave her the title.

1228570,4,B00000ILEA,"Waking Ned Devine is one of those charming and funny movies that you just can't help liking.  Surely everyone has pondered on what life would be like if one won the lottery. . . . . . . . . .  In the quaint Irish town of Tullymore, an elderly pair of jokers, Jackie and Michael, discover that one of the villagers has won the National Lottery's First Division.  There's a problem though - the villager in question is dead.  And so Jackie and Michael embark on an increasingly complicated scheme to convince the lottery scrutineers that Ned Devine is in fact still alive and well, and eligible to claim the 7 million winnings.
It's a refreshing change to watch a comedy where the protagonists are largely - to put it bluntly - old.  The late Ian Bannen and David Kelly turn in marvelous performances as the irascible duo.  Not only do they manage to create and capture the humour of the film, they also touchingly portray the affection each character has for the other.
But it is its own unique brand of humour for which Waking Ned Devine will most likely be remembered.  The motley collection of villagers should raise a few chuckles, and the sight of a naked scrawny old man tearing along the Irish byroads on a motorbike will leave the viewer in stitches.  However, the rather macabre method of dispatch dealt to the story's 'villain', while it is funny at the time, doesn't bear thinking about too closely.
Interestingly, the movie was filmed in the Isle of Man, rather than Ireland; nevertheless, the scenery is beautiful, and is complemented by some stirring Irish music (although this is a little loud in comparison with the dialogue).  Overall though, this is a great film to watch to unwind a little.",1071878400,5,1708,4.629139072847682
1228571,4,B00000ILEA,"This film is a bit like the Ealing Studio comedies of the 50's. It is character-based film whose jokes depend on situational comedy. The nub of the plot is that the main leads do something a little bit wrong, but not so wrong that they stop being lovable wags. It is set in a village that is on the Isle of Man and in real life is preserved as a tourist attraction. The actors are almost all old comedians and character actors. The movie creates the feel of an Irish village that lives only really in people's imagination. However in dealing with a film such as this one is not concerned with anything else but whether the elements come together as an entertainment.
This film does succeed and was a great success when it was released. The plot is centred around a village trying to get the prize that would have gone to one of the villagers if he had not died on the night of the announcement of his win. They have to convince a not to sceptical lotteries inspector that Ned Devine is still alive and well.
The cast is impressive although apparently a number of the actors have died. The film is good in that it depends on cast of people in their 70's to propel the story rather than a number of 20 year old models. One of the funniest scenes in the film  in fact involves a nude motor bike ride by one of the older male actors. Well worth watching.",1067126400,3,1350,4.2734375

My favourite scene was at the funeral of Ned Devine, where the lotto man shows up and while making his speech, Jackie pretends it is Michael O'Sullivan who has died. He states, ""Michael O'Sullivan was my great friend. But I don't ever remember telling him that. The words that are spoken at a funeral are spoken too late for the man who is dead. What a wonderful thing it would be to visit your own funeral. To sit at the front and hear what was said, maybe say a few things yourself. Michael and I grew old together. But at times, when we laughed, we grew young. If he was here now, if he could hear what I say, I'd congratulate him on being a great man, and thank him for being a friend.""
This was a really cute movie, and it always kept me laughing. I'd recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of international movies. It's definitely one of my favourites!",1059436800,4,1097,4.253588516746412

1228574,5,B00000ILEA,"This film, written and directed by Kirk Jones III, is one of my all-time favorites - and it's only 5 years old.  Telling the story of how unimaginable riches can affect the lives of people in a small Irish village, the writing and the characterizations here are absolutely perfect.  Without making fun of the people who live in the village, Jones manages to find the humor in their lives - and in this situation - and he lays it out before our eyes in a very loving, respectful way.  When I first saw this in the theatre, I laughed until I had tears running down my cheeks - not at mindless slapstick, but at real, deep humor.  Some of the tears were from pure emotion as well - these are characters who will get into your heart and stay there for years to come.
The two main protagonists here are lifelong pals Jackie O'Shea (Ian Bannen) and Michael O'Sullivan (David Kelly - fans of FAWLTY TOWERS will remember him as the bumbling carpenter O'Reilly) - there is nothing in the world they would hesitate to do for each other, with the honesty and love that a long, deep friendship breeds.  Jackie is married to Annie (Fionnula Flanagan) - Michael is a widower who is obviously still very much in love with his departed wife (much to the consternation of a precious widow who lives in the village).  An inanimate character in the story is the Irish Lottery - many people in the village are regular players, each with his/her own dream of what to do with the winnings, should they fall their way.  One morning after a drawing on TV, Jackie discovers that there is a winner in the village, unidentified.  He and Michael hatch a scheme to find out the identity of the lucky party and make sure they are fast friends with them - when they discover that their old friend Ned Devine is the winner, they assume their job will be an easy one.  There's a small catch - Ned died of shock when he realized that he had hit the jackpot.  The rest of the film revolves around Jackie's newly-revised scheme - sure that he's doing what Ned would have wanted, he is determined to convince the man from the Lotto that Ned is alive.  Let the shenanigans and general hilarity begin - along with some genuinely touching emotional moments, and more than a little drama and suspense.
We are treated to a wonderful cast of characters the likes of which is rare in a comedic film - each and every one of them is so very well-developed, and even the ones that display humorous aspects are never presented as caricatures.  This is where the respect held by Jones for his story and characters becomes valuable to the point of being a rare, precious thing.  The interplay between the various characters is extremely well-drawn.  Annie's attempts to coax `the boys' back from a `life of crime and prison' are from her heart - it's easy to see that she loves Michael almost as much as her husband.  The on-again-off-again courtship between Pig Finn (James Nesbitt) and Maggie O'Toole (Susan Lynch, who played the Selkie in THE SECRET OF ROAN INNISH) is sweet but never cloying - and Eileen Dromey is absolutely perfectly detestable as `the witch' Lizzy Quinn, whose greed and contempt for her neighbors threatens to throw a spanner into the works for everyone.
If you've managed to miss this gem - don't wait any longer.  Since it wasn't a huge box-office smash, it might be a little hard to find for rental - so go ahead and take the plunge and buy a copy.  I guarantee you won't want to watch it just once.",1053648000,2,3477,4.493650793650794

In contrast to essentially ALL comedies I have seen in recent years, this one holds up wonderfully to repeated viewing.  It was even better than the first time.  Every part, from the stars O'Bannon and Kelly to the smallest walk-ons, is wonderfuly acted.  I particularly liked the old sourpuss who rode the motorized cart, the pig farmer, and the young priest.  They are all so multidimensional that you can imagine what they are doing when they aren't on screen.
The screenplay is wonderful, and the direction is expert.  I especially liked the love scenes between Maggie and the pig farmer who smells so bad that she has to stay yards away from him at all times.  Imagine an affecting, humorous, and believable love scene where the participants don't even touch each other!
Another plus is that this is actually a great family movie.  Although it is in no way designed for kids, my 8-year-old laughed all the way through it.  He especially liked the famous naked motorcycle ride!
Definitely worth owning (not just renting)!",1036281600,88,1160,4.731343283582089
1228601,4,B00000ILEA,"""Waking Ned Devine"" doesn't have Julia Roberts or Adam Sandler in it, and that's an automatic sign of good quality. But it's the winking Irish cuteness, widespread fraud, lovable characters and tight plotting that make this movie ""Devine"" fun.
One of the few thrills in Jackie O'Shea's (Ian Bannen) life is the lotto. And so when he and his best buddy Michael O'Sullivan (David Kelly) discover that someone in their tiny Irish village of Tullymore (population: around fifty, not including animals) has won, they go to absurd lengths to find out. After a few dead ends, they find out: kindly Ned Devine. The problem is, Ned is dead of the shock, with a lottery ticket in his hand and a silly grin on his face. That night, Jackie has a dream about Ned offering to ""share the chicken,"" and becomes convinced that his dead buddy wants him to cash the ticket.
Jackie and Michael call the lotto and claim that Ned wants to claim his money. The lotto officials duly send out a friendly representative to Tullymore -- and Michael, who has ""never told a lie in his life,"" finds himself in Ned's house, in Jackie's clothes, pretending to be Ned. The problem? The representative plans to ask some of his fellow villagers to confirm that ""Ned"" is who he says he is. And so the conspiracy of lies begins to spread.
That's not the entire plot, needless to say. There's a love triangle between single mom Maggie (Susan Lynch), loving pig farmer Pig Finn (James Nesbitt), and wealthy wild boy Pat Mulligan. Maggie loves Pig, but she doesn't love the smell he brings with him. There's the question of who the father of Maggie's stoic kid Maurice (Robert Hickey) is -- and be forewarned, there are some red herrings flung toward the audience. Jackie's wife Annie (Fionnula Flanagan) is less-than-pleased by these extralegal activies. And the local creepy old lady Lizzy Quinn (Eileen Dromey) is waging a one-woman war on the village of winners, because they didn't give her more than her share.
The thing that makes this film work is its charming lack of seriousness. You don't really care that the people in it are committing fraud -- after all, it's what dear ol' Ned would've wanted. You merely want Jackie and Michael to succeed, for Maggie to marry Pig, and for everyone to retire rich, fat and happy. The lack of seriousness is shown in the constant jokes about fruity soaps, alcohol, nude octogenarian motorcyclists, and the funniest almost-love-scene ever.
Ian Bannen is truly lovable as Jackie -- he's not perfect, he has plenty of flaws, but he's charmingly generous and honest. David Kelley is solemnly cute as Michael, whether it's tearing up at his own eulogy or biking for his life with no clothes on. Fionnula Flanagan is fully believable as his wife, showing a steadfast fire and concern for her husband, just in case he bites off more than he can chew. The main problem would be Robert Hickey. The late Ned shows more animation than this kid. Parents can probably allow their kids to watch this -- there's no sex, profanity or violence, although there is some unsexy male nudity (of the skinny-dipping variety).
""Waking Ned Devine"" is a comedy for people who are sick of comedies. With genuine wit and charm, this rises head and shoulders above gross-out or romantic comedies. Outrageously funny.",1035504000,18,3295,4.782456140350877
1228602,5,B00000ILEA,"Call it the luck of the Irish.  Or not.  This jovial fare is definitely about some kind of luck, but whether it's good or bad depends upon which side of the lottery ticket you're standing.  For the title character in ""Waking Ned Devine,"" directed by Kirk Jones, let's just say his was the kind of luck you wouldn't wish on anyone.  But like a vast amount of energy floating around the cosmos looking for a place to land after leaving somewhere else, the luck that runs out for one can become the good fortune of another, at least if it happens to light in the right place and in capable hands.  Which in the case of this story, could be any number of hands, all grasping wildly for that same elusive butterfly, or more precisely, as it turns out, for that fickle fly of fate.  At any rate, the bunch of characters assembled here are the kind Billy Wilder or Frank Capra would've had a field day with, and they are hereby proffered by the filmmakers on hand for your, without a doubt, considerable delight and approval.  And whether you're Irish or not, consider yourself lucky-- because you've just won the ""Laugh Lottery,"" that'll leave more than just your Irish eyes smilin'.
In the small (make that VERY small) community of Tulaigh Mohr (Tullymore), someone is holding the winning ticket from the last Lotto game, but of the fifty-eight or so good souls currently residing in this picturesque village by the sea, no one has yet come forth to claim the substantial prize.  And, of course, it's led to speculation by the keenest minds from amongst the population, at the forefront of which is none other than himself, Jackie O'Shea (Ian Bannen), along with his good friend Michael O'Sullivan (David Kelly), who are determined to get to the bottom of it all.  The raging question issuing from the Blarney Stone and flowing over into the local pub where it remains adrift like a raft of mystery atop every pint, is why hasn't the lucky sod come forward?
Well then, it's up to Jackie and Michael to find out, isn't it?  `Tis.  And so, in the spirit of ""community,"" they set out to find the winner, and the sooner the better; all the quicker to latch onto whomever it is and convince him (or her) that better friends than Jackie and Michael the Maker Himself never put on the good, green earth.  But who could it be?  Maggie (Susan Lynch)?  Pig Finn (James Nesbitt)?  Or even old Ned Devine (Jimmy Keogh), who come to think of it hasn't been seen lately.  And when Ned doesn't show up to a get-together at Jackie's house, catered by wife, Annie (Fionnula Flanagan), for the most likely winning-ticket-holding-suspects, Jackie decides to pay old Ned, good Ned, a visit; it just may be that there, at Ned's, Jackie will uncover the secret of this mystery.  Or so he hopes.
Kirk Jones has put together and delivered a film that is fun and funny, but more than that, it's a story filled with Puck-like spirit that comes at you with a twinkle in it's eye, a wink and a sidelong glance.  More than anything, though, this is a character study that penetrates to the very heart of the human condition, with all it's flaws, foibles and peccadilloes; but it's permeated with a warmth and generosity of spirit that enables you to fully embrace these rascals, even as they're poking you in the ribs until your sides are sore from laughing.  Overall, it's an assemblage of memorable characters and unforgettable scenes that Jones serves up on a silver platter of good will, harmony and, most importantly, a sense of everlasting hope.
In one of his final roles, Ian Bannen absolutely shines as the rascally Jackie, a ""character"" of a character, who underneath it all has a heart as big as they come.  Bannen lends a bit o' the devil to Jackie, but never lets you forget the true nature of the man within, which may not be of an entirely altruistic bent, but neither is there a drop of malice to be found in his veins.  And it's what makes his portrayal so convincing; what we see is a man who is human, not a saint, maybe, but one who definitely won't be turned away from the Pearly Gates when the time comes.  It's a lively performance in which Bannen exhibits a love of life and living, and it makes Jackie O'Shea an honest and very real character.
And once you've seen him, you're never going to forget David Kelly as Michael O'Sullivan.  He's a lovable, Capraesque kind of character who is what he is; with Michael, what you see is what you get, and Kelly brings him vibrantly to life.  His ""motorcycle ride"" alone is worth the price of admission for this one, a scene that will be emblazoned in your memory forevermore.  It's a first-rate performance from a terrific character actor, and along with Bannen's, it makes O'Sullivan and O'Shea a real pair to draw to.
Adding to the merriment, as well, is the always delightful Fionnula Flanagan as Annie, a woman Irish to the bottom of her soul, a kind of kindred spirit to Maureen O'Hara's Mary Kate Danaher in ""The Quiet Man.""  She gives her Annie spunk, and a nature that complements her Jackie effectively.
Also giving noteworthy performances are Susan Lynch, as Maggie, and James Nesbitt as Pig Finn; two more characters you're not likely to forget anytime soon.
The supporting cast includes Maura O'Malley (Mrs. Kennedy), Robert Hickey (O'Toole), Paddy Ward (Brendy), Eileen Dromey (Lizzy) and Dermot Kerrigan (Father Patrick).  A refreshing comedy filled with some real insights and genuine humor, ""Waking Ned Devine"" is like a breath of fresh air in a world often choked with L.A. smog.  It's a rare, entertaining treat to be savored and enjoyed again and again.  And that's the magic of the movies.",1031184000,3,5641,4.629889669007021

Taking place in an Irish village of 52 inhabitants, the movie deals with the very human reactions to winning a lot of money in the lottery, yet takes unexpected turns that bring it to a new dimension, where the people of the village all end up agreeing with a plan that reminded me of the plot in Brazilian writer Paulo Coelho's most recent novel, ""The Devil and Miss Prym.""
I don't want to spoil the movie for you... Suffice it to say that from the first minute this charming Irish production will grab you and won't let you go, by stirring up emotions that go from deep laughter to sadness.

1228647,4,B00000ILEA,"There is something very appealing to me about the humor that comes from the British Isles. Its comedies often do not seem as self-conscious as American ones sometimes do, and what they find amusing often comes from the unlikeliest sources. I realize that some people are loathe to watch a movie of any type from England, Scotland or Ireland because they have difficulty understanding the dialects. I admit I've seen some which I wish had had subtitles. I did not find Waking Ned Devine, which is Irish, hard to understand, but then I've seen a heck of a lot of movies in my time.
Clever and quite charming, Waking Ned Devine is a simple tale about a tiny village whose residents suddenly find themselves faced with a very big event. A small article in a Dublin newspaper states that the week's winning national lottery ticket was purchased in their fair county. Since the village is the only one in the county, life-long friends Jackie O'Shay [Ian Bannen] and Michael O'Sullivan [David Kelly] decide to find out who won by getting a list of names of people who bought a ticket. They reason that the winner will want to share in his or her good fortune. The list contains 52 names. They to throw a dinner party for the ticket holders, ply them with good Irish whiskey and try find out who got lucky. No one seems to have won, but afterwards, they realize that one person, Ned Devine, did not show up. Jackie decides to visit the elderly man, and upon entering his house, quickly finds out that Ned has died from shock. The winning ticket is still clutched in one hand. Ned still has a smile on his face.
What follows is a madcap plan to claim the prize, which is worth nearly $10,000,000. The money cannot be paid to a dead man, and Ned had no living relatives. You will have to see the video to discover who, if anyone, gets the money. It is certainly a merry pursuit.
The cast is uniformly excellent. The village is peopled with folks who appear eccentric, but I am not sure how different they are from many people I have met in small towns. I think when you live in such a place, there is a camaraderie you don't find in big cities. Because everyone knows so much about everyone else, there is perhaps less pressure not to be yourself. After all, most people's true personalities are more interesting than the facades they wear.
All the beauty that is the Irish countryside is lovingly and exquisitely photographed. If the village is a set and not a real place, it is authentic, down to the thatched roofs and low doorways. The Gaelic music used throughout seems especially beautiful here, because the setting is the source of the music.
Much of the humor in Waking Ned Devine comes from looking at a group of people try to handle a situation which is, for them, unchartered waters. The naive way in which the villagers rationalize their actions by thinking it's what the beloved Ned would have wanted is utterly charming. These are dreamers rather than schemers.
First time director Kirk Jones has achieved a rare feat. He has created a place and a group of people so seemingly real that you wish you could go to visit them one day. For such a relatively short movie, he has created a great number of interesting characters, including the spry but elderly Jackie and Michael, the jolly tavern keeper, the local pig farmer, the resident witch, the bemused priest, and the young boy who's wise beyond his years.",1016841600,8,3412,4.576797385620915

1228653,4,B00000ILEA,"I enjoyed watching this movie very much, but it was not what I expected.  I was looking for something to make me laugh, and I didn't find it here.
Waking Ned Devine is a very amusing-heart warming felt story of a man that wins the lottery, only to wind up dead.  Doesn't sound very heart warming now does it, but it is.
Ned's two friends are the ones that find the ticket, and that's when it all comes together.  This is actually a story of two very close friends from a very small town that would like to hit it rich, and find out that money isn't as important as friendship and community.  Don't get me wrong, there are a few parts that brought out a chuckle, like the naked motor cycle ride, and...
Overall, I really enjoyed this film, and I'd watch it again, but it doesn't belong in my collection because it isn't something that I would be compelled to just pop in the DVD player on a moments notice.  Just watch it on TV, `cause you know it will be on sometime, and when it does come on...watch it. It's worth your time.",1002067200,5,1026,4.214285714285714

The delightful shenanigans of the two central characters as they attempt to involve an entire Irish hamlet in a scheme to cash in on the winning lottery ticket of a deceased friend was almost as classic as a keystone cops routine.  The plight of a small dying community in a world of big cities is hardly unfamiliar to me having spent some of my earlier years in a similar community in southern Minnesota.  The formulaic activities of the elderly, left behind by the flight of the younger generation to the cities, is definitely illustrated, as are the narrow choices available to those young people who have chosen to remain in their native town.  My favorite scenes are the motorcycle ride by the two elderly comrades through the backroads to beat the lottery agent to the winner's home, and the race of the village grump to the phone box to report the fraud.  The scenery was totally gorgeous and almost makes me want to board an Aer Lingus for Ireland.",1001894400,,1010,4.620111731843576

1228698,4,B00000ILEA,"WAKING NED DEVINE is a delightful Irish film sure to tickle your funny bone in one way or the other. The story revolves around two old friends who figure out someone in their small village (population 52) has won the national lottery. After several failed attempts at uncovering who the lucky person is, they discover the winner to be the big-hearted Ned Devine. The only problem is that Ned is dead; dying from the shock of winning such a fortune. A plan is put into action, that eventually involves the entire town.
The humor in this film speaks on many levels from dark comedy (the tragic death of the town witch) to physical sight gags (naked skinny old man on motorcycle). There is a little bit of romance, but nothing that takes away from the film's playful structure. Not only that, there is also a moral to the story, one of family and friendship; no man is an island. But I bet John Donne never imagined his message this way.",986774400,,934,4.5

This is such a charming movie that its a surprise why it wasn't as big as Full Monty. With such lovely photography and very good characters its almost sinful if one doesn't get involved. A movie full of heart and soul, a great example that for a film to be good, big stars and bang bang fast plots aren't necessary.
Micheal and Jackie are two old down on their luck irish sods who live in the small irish village of Tullmore( pop 52). a rumour in town of a local lotto winner sets these two on their feet and off to heartwarming journey to get the winnings. A cute subplot on the side, the romance of Pig Finn, a local pig farmer and another farmer's daughter is also a delight to watch.

Leonard Maltin's movie book calls this a ""slight"" film but I find it huge on charm and heart.  It's a well-paced, old-fashioned caper story in which all but two residents (approximately 52 to begin with) of an impoverished remote rural Irish village conspire to collect the big lottery when their old pal, Ned Devine, has died in the excitement of learning he's won.  Of the two exceptions, one is the head priest who is conveniently out of town when the story is set in motion and the other is a humorless old crone who threatens to tattle.  You can't help but cheer on the chicanery in a film where the humor ranges from the black to the silly to the sentimental.  Seems to me the only person who will not be won over by this movie is a humorless old crone.  The scenery is stunning.",979516800,22,892,4.311377245508982
1228701,4,B00000ILEA,"The  lush, rolling green fields of Ireland and its lovely villages provide the idyllic setting for this warm, humane  little comedy, which is about what happens when an old man wins nearly eight million pounds on the Lottery and then dies from the excitement with the winning ticket still in his hand.
Two old villagers, Jackie O'shea (Ian Bannen) and Michael O'Sullivan  (David Keller) learn from the papers that someone in their small village of only 52 inhabitants has won the Lottery; and their efforts to find the winner occupies the first part of the film. When they eventually do so and call on Ned and find his dead hand still clutching the winning ticket, they have to decided what to do; to be honest and hand the ticket back or to take advantage of the situation and pretend one of them is Ned. The temptation is irresistible.
But, not being selfish, they want the whole village to share in Ned's good fortune. And so they hold a village meeting and put forward their plan; provided that each villager will sign a form committing them to secrecy, the money will be shared out and each will receive 150,000. But some quick thinking is required and many lies and evasions follow when a representative of the Lottery comes to the village to verify the claim and the claimant's identity and arrives in the middle of Ned's funeral service and Jackie O'shea's funeral oration. And their plan is under threat from another quarter; the evil-minded witch of the village demands 1000,000 in hush money!
There is a nice little love interest in which James Nesbitt as Pig Finn is excellent as as pig-man, too poor and smelling too much of pig to be thought at all desirable by his beloved. 150,000  would see them both right.
But it is Ian Bannen as Jackie O'Shea, still full of his usual energy and Joie de vivre, who is central to the film and raises it so well above the average. How sad that he should die so soon after the film's completion. At least he went out on a high note and left us with a memorable performance.",978739200,3,2023,4.549450549450549

1228776,5,B00000ILEA,"I must admit that I bought this movie because of where it was filmed rather than because of the plot, although I was not at all disappointed with the latter. I found the combination of impeccable performance, gentle  wit, occasional hilarity, evocative soundtrack and stunning scenery  harmonised perfectly into a highly enjoyable whole. DVD audio and video  quality is excellent although there is little otherwise to choose between  VHS and DVD formats. Extras are limited to ""text and photo""  biographies of the cast and a Theatrical Trailer which gives away too many  surprises - DO NOT WATCH THIS BEFORE WATCHING THE MOVIE.
Many people may  be surprised to discover that not a single frame of the movie was shot in  Ireland, the filming actually taking place on the Isle of Man. Although  more famous for its tail-less cats and the annual TT motorcycle races, tax  concessions by the (Independent) Manx government have recently made the  Island something of a haven for movie makers. The Isle of Man (which is  almost exactly at the geographic centre of the British Isles) is in many  ways an ideal location ; within its 220 square miles it possesses much of  the landscape scenery found in the United Kingdom and Eire and enjoys a  more favourable climate than either of its near neighbours.
The dramatic  cliffs of the Island's south-west coast are used to wonderful effect in  Waking Ned Devine as are the beautiful, secluded bays and the narrow  country lanes - the naked motorcycle ride has to be one of the most  memorable scenes in any recent movie. The village of Tullymore in the movie  is actually Cregneash, at the extreme southern tip of the Island. A large  part of this village, with its thatched farmstead and cottages, is a living  museum, part of Manx National Heritage. I would urge anyone who loved the  scenery in this movie to visit and explore the Isle of Man should the  opportunity arise. It has been a favourite haunt of mine for many years and  is certain to feature in an increasing number of productions as its  reputation as a film location grows.",952473600,81,2080,4.772471910112359

This film  experiments with the human desire to have, and the desire to(even when  pressured in to it) give.
