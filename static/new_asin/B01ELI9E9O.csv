I'm disgusted by the endless cheap tactics used to squeeze more money out of movie fans.

7738256,4,B01ELI9E9O,"The original Theatrical release of the movie was a solid 4.25 stars, IMO. The added 10 minutes in the Extended Edition did not add enough substance to the movie, IMO. Take the extended editions of Lord of the Rings, now those added in a lot, not all, of the missing details that were in the books. However I can't say that the original edition of The Martian left me with a lot, if any, unanswered questions about the movie. Definitely don't see a sequel coming from it.

The quality of the 4K is amazing. I'd say even enough so that it's worth upgrading from the blu ray edition. My girlfriend says it looks too realistic to the point it comes off as looking fake. Which technically it is, but the detail is... Wow!

Okay, now on to the headline of my review. The Extended Edition of the 4K disc suffers from audio sync problems. This is a known problem among the folks that have received a bad 4K production of the movie. The 4K Theatrical Edition does not suffer from the audio sync problem. This also seems to be isolated to the US (region 1) produced discs. Apparently the UK discs don't have the issue.
I called Fox, their toll free phone number is listed on the back of the movie case, to see if they had a disc replacement program in place for this and Vivian stated that she did not see where this was reported as an issue, or reported enough, to have it investigated. Vivian did say that she would log my call and if they start receiving more complaints, they will definitely investigate. She said if I decided to keep the movie, to check back periodically to see if Fox is offering replacements.
Those of you that have encountered, or are currently encountering the audio sync problem with the 4K extended edition, I encourage you to call the toll free number to Fox Connect and complain. Otherwise folks will keep receiving defective discs that will likely be returned to Amazon and the movie will get negative reviews on behalf of the audio issue.",1531612800,,1960,4.487394957983193

7738304,4,B01ELI9E9O,"The Martian
Four stars.
There are very few feel-good movies around.  This is one; and its a good one. I love science fiction, including the dystopian variety. But I was in the mood for something with a bit of old-fashioned inspiration and optimism.
There are a lot of things I like about this movie. The main character, Mark Watney is an astronaut/botanist, played by Matt Damon.  Watney is stranded alone on Mars when his crew, thinking that hes dead, lifts off without him to escape a storm.  And  to add insult to injury - hes stranded with only a collection of disco music to listen to. Well, thats about as far up a creek without a paddle as anyone can get.
I completely related to his work the problem and get on with it attitude as he improvises his way from one problem to the next.  Watney is an appealing character; hes resilient, determined to nerd his way through his situation, hanging on to humor in spite of set-backs and increasingly debilitating privation. Meanwhile his crew is headed home to Earth and on Earth, NASA is learning that a survivor has been left behind.
Damon does a great job portraying Watneys determination to focus rationally on the problems at hand, while emotions, desperate hope and despair alternate below, surfacing in vulnerable moments.  I was really rooting for this guy.  A large cast included Chiwetal Ejiofor, Jeff Daniels, Jessica Chastain, Michael Pena, Kristen Wiig, Sean Bean.  I enjoyed watching the portrayals of the interactions between the entire cast as the NASA and JPL scientists and the Ares III mission crew.
I liked the subtle humor blended in without undercutting the drama.  Scenes cutting back and forth between NASA and JPL scientists problem solving on mock-ups in the lab while Watney mirrors them on Mars, following their instructions and adding ironic comment on the solutions that the collaboration of the greatest minds on Earth came up with
 dismantling a multi-million dollar landing vehicle with careless abandon as if it was a jalopy in a junkyard while Abbas Waterloo blares exuberantly  Perhaps my profession has warped my sense of humor but I found scenes like that relatable and funnier than contrived comedies. (Not an astronaut and never been to Mars of course, but Ive Been There and had to laugh out loud. ;-) )
This movie is almost old-fashioned in its feeling of optimism; the comradery of the crew, human beings uniting behind a common cause, the will to survive, courage, ingenuity, the refusal to quit in the face of the odds. Even though the outcome may not have provided many surprises, it was a satisfying, enjoyable 2 hours. I loved the visuals of the Martian landscape. The original movie score was lovely; both the visuals and the score capturing the sense of immense, spectacular Martian vistas  and the isolation of one tiny human being, alone on an entire planet.  The story and message is inspiring, family-friendly, and doesnt have embarrassing moments for anyone if you see it with a date. Its the type of story that caught my imagination and hooked me on science fiction as a child.  As an adult, it still does and I wouldnt mind seeing it more often.
After seeing both the theatre and extended versions, I favor the extended version. It's only about 10 additional minutes, but in those minutes, it captures character moments that enrich the story.

I picked up the book, and finished it in time for the theater release. Now, the book has way more detail, and a few events more than the movie, the extended edition adds a couple of nods to the book that were left out of the theatrical release. As I have only seen the original cut in the theater, I can't be sure, but it seems like they changed a few scenes, in addition to the added ones. Spoiler ahead, One of the things they deleted from the book, was the pop out emergency shelters. Prior to his journey to the Ares IV MAV, he takes the two and turns them into a spare room so he could escape the confines of the rover. One of the added scenes is a nod to this.

7738366,5,B01ELI9E9O,"I loved the theatrical release of The Martian, so when I got a 4K Blu-ray player the extended release was my first ultra HD disc.  I didn't think I would notice a lot of difference compared to the regular Blu-ray version but I was pleasantly surprised. I didn't realize the potential of my 4K TV till put this 4K disc into my new player. I am very impressed with the 4K video quality!

Of course there are lots of other reviews that cover the story line about leaving Mark Watney on Mars thinking wrongly he had died. From there it's a tale of survival with lots of twists and turns. along the way.  I'll focus on my experience with the extended edition differences.

So, the extended edition adds about 10 minutes and I read 11 scenes. Having seen the theatrical  3 times I picked out 6 of these pretty readily. Trying not to be a spoiler... Mostly I noticed scenes providing more story detail on Mars, at least one on Hermes and a couple on earth.  If you turn on the commentary the longer scenes are obvious by their absence of commentary.

Speaking of commentary - I thought it was quite interesting with the tie-in to Lawrence of Arabia and discussion of how the laws of physics were compromised in the name of theatrical expediency. The commentary is by Ridley Scott and author of the book and the screen writer. Listening to it seems clear to me that Scott's commentary was recorded separately from the writers and interleaved with the writers' voices. Seemed a little strange till I caught on to it.

I can see why some of the extended scenes were not in the theatrical release as they affect the pacing of the film. BUT, I'm glad to have them to see. I was already a fan and happy to get any more of the movie I could. Add to that the excellent quality of the 4K/UHD version and my expectations have been well exceeded.  I think it should be pretty obvious I think the 4K extended edition of the Martian is definitely 5 stars.",1508630400,5,1935,4.412921348314606

The book has such an amazing character build up, with witty jokes. Also, they've added scenes that are entirely unnecessary.

7738397,5,B01ELI9E9O,"I just watched this movie yesterday and if you have ever wondered whether Ultra 4k HDR  or Dolby Vision/Dolby Atmos is a gimmick I can say unequivocally it is not!  Yes Ultra 4k is higher resolution than HD (1920x1080) but if your TV is 50 inches or less it may not be noticeable.  Where this technology really comes into it's own is with very large screen TV's.  Higher resolution is nice but where these movies really excel is when you couple that higher resolution with a broader range of colors.  HDR and Dolby vision add a whole new dimension to the cinema viewing experience.  Not only are the colors freaking awesome but the sound tracks in this movie will rock your world.  You really need a 5.1 or 7.1 speaker system layout to fully appreciate it.  This movie makes fantastic use of bass so if you have a sub-woofer prepare to be amazed!  The acting is fantastic from everyone.  Matt Damon is the star of course but Sean Bean, Jessica Chastain and all the other actors just hit it out of the park.  The plot is fantastic and interesting and the imagery is just gorgeous.  So why did I give it 4 stars?  Well at the very end I noticed that the audio dialogue became out of sync with the video.  Not by a whole lot but noticeable.  I can't really fault the movie or the encoding for sure because I have an A/V Receiver in between my OPPO UDP-203 player and my Sony HDR TV.  It could be the A/V receiver or it could be some buggy software in the OPPO player or finally it could be caused by defects in the encoding on the disk.  I am not sure which is the problem but I will give the vendor of the benefit of the doubt and most likely blame my OPPO UDP-203 blue ray player.  It would not be the first time I've had a problem with an OPPO player.  The audio problems at the end notwithstanding the movie is a joy to watch and should definitely be part of your collection.
------------
I am changing the review and giving the movie 5 stars.  I just watched the end of the 4k disk again and this time the audio and video were in perfect sync.  My experience with the first viewing of the film was probably due to a glitch in the OPPO player software.  Anyway I wanted to make sure I updated the review because it would not be fair to the studios who produced such an excellent product.  You can buy this movie with confidence.

HOWEVER, I seem to have found an Issue with the 4K Extended Edition: The Audio Track slowly goes out of sync with the Video; everything starts out great, all nice and neatly-synchronized, but by the end of the movie, the Audio is about .6 seconds Early. Yes, I realize that's not much, but it's Noticeable and MADDENING.
The film is BEAUTIFUL in 4K - all the Martian terrain is absolutely LOVELY, and the 4K Format goes a long way toward showing off all the beautiful details on a 65"" S-UHD TV, making it well worth the money, in my opinion, but the Lag as the movie progresses is pretty noticeable by the time Mark gets rescued...
Unfortunately, the only 4K Edition in the box is the Extended Edition; there's no 4K version of the Theatrical Edition included, so I don't have a 4K Theatrical Edition to compare it to.

They kept the science howler exception from the book but added one of their own, but like I said even with those two exceptions, they still did way better than any other movie in telling a good story while getting the science right.

So within BS category I have sub sections. believable and entertaining BS or BS of BS. The Martian fall under believable and entertaining BS. You know, nobody ever went to Mars. It is a fact. But this movie, if you pass that fact and assume, we did go there. It is almost real. Such as living conditions, harsh realities of Mars. Space travel time and conditions we travel. Like new movie passengers, in my view fall under BS of BS. Nothing was believable and story line, and flow of the movie was bad. Anyway, The Martian is a great movie to watch. It is a bit slow, not much action. Nothing really blows up or space invaders etc. If you enjoy realistic sci-fi ( to me space odyssey 2001 was realistic until the last 20 min. of the movie-believable BS) you will like this movie.",1494288000,,942,4.4508670520231215

(Such as, what else was Mark Watney doing while he waited for the rescue plan to be put in action?) Some scenes were very short--a second or two--and others were many minutes long and much more detailed. Most were seamless, and it took several seconds to register, ""Wait. This is new.""

In addition to the added scenes, several cut scenes are also included as features that weren't put back into the Extended Edition (a couple of which should probably have stayed, IMHO).

I'm not sure if the new scenes themselves were worth what amounted to a double purchase for me, but the special features certainly did. There were some closer looks at The Martian special effects, sets, story development, science, etc. that were amazing. Also included were several science panels, with the one facilitated by Andy Weir (the author of the novel) about the efforts to send a manned mission to Mars being the most entertaining of the lot.

If you're still thinking about purchasing a copy of The Martian for your collection, I'd recommend buying this version. It also contains the original released version to round out the entire package.",1489795200,,1257,4.947867298578199

7738468,5,B01ELI9E9O,"This will be a review of this particular edition and contents, not the movie.  Movie, stellar, loved it.  Saw it at an Imax and was blown away, got the book the next day, loved it as much, and waited patiently for the Blu Ray to be released.  Got it when it did, and then saw the 4k UHD version after they released their extended version.

I already had a 4k TV, that was just about 18 months old.  But it didn't do HDR, so I literally purchased a new TV so I could get this version of the Blu Ray...

And I have to say, as beautiful as the movie was to watch in 4K, it's even more so with the HDR...

This is now my go to movie when someone wants to see just what HDR does for a movie.

The extras are nice, although I wish the ""extras"" had a few more bits that were in the book, but overall I won't complain.  There's just a little bit here and there, a couple short things that were cut, but no major scenes, to add the content.

Watching it on a 2016 Sony 65"" 4K HDR set using an Xbox One S as the player - just jaw dropping.  There are some things that the 4K looks great in parts, and in other parts the 4K is a distraction for what it can do to CGI.  But the CGI in here is so insanely well done, it just looks dazzling.",1485907200,2,1227,3.8446215139442232

7738477,1,B01ELI9E9O,The lack of logic in the science for this thing is so distracting that I would think even an English or philosophy major would be taken out of the story by the lack of basic science fact and safety measures. At the beginning these people don't have options to tie themselves together in the event of a storm on a planet to get back to where they came from? The main character  removes  shrapnel  without checking to see if there is any more and a mirror is just  coincidently set up ready for him to try to sew self together without any washing of the wound or inspection of it for further debris? During the rescue some astronauts are just free flying outside of the ship untethered. Perhaps all of the many other science indiscretions in between these events at beginning and end of this movie can be overlooked for a good story but all I can do is hope that in the book this sort of thing did not occur. Most of the very trite dialogue was annoying as well and the Disco was the final nail in the coffin. Some of the casting was a bit strange. This movie was annoying,1485043200,3,1070,4.25615763546798

7738565,5,B01ELI9E9O,"I've watched, read, and listened to 'The Martian', and now I've watched it again with this extended edition.

How is the extended edition of 'The Martian'? I basically have the movie memorized and could tell which scenes were the added scenes. In my opinion, the theatrical is the preferred watch. The ten extra minutes you get here helps with fleshing things out, but I can see why they were cut in the first place. They are unnecessary and don't really add anything to it that we didn't already get. I might agree with two or three of the additions, but the majority wasn't needed. It still doesn't change the fact that this is still a great movie experience either way.

If you're looking for a well-paced, science-based journey, with lots of humor and lots of heart, along with a thrilling conclusion, this is the movie for you, in either its theatrical or extended cuts. Recommended.",1474502400,17,888,4.72258064516129

Yes, 4K is the only rendering in which to enjoy this masterwork starring a master actor.  When James Stewart passed away I was sure his place in the acting firmament would never be filled, however, then came the plum supporting performance in ""Courage Under Fire"", then the leading role in ""The Rainmaker"".  His presence in film has been nothing but phenomenal as he is the one actor who can  paint pictures with nothing.  The scripts he has been involved with may be wonderful, however, most have minimal dialogue and he is capable of conveying so much with it.  I could go on blathering on and on about this actor so I will stop now.  Suffice it to say, he is my second favorite actor, James Stewart being my first.  He proves it in ""The Martian"".  Mr. Stewart proved it in ""The Flight of the Phoenix"", ""Vertigo"", and, of course, ""It's a Wonderful Life"".",1474416000,,899,4.53416149068323

7738569,5,B01ELI9E9O,"My family watched the 4K Ultra-HD version of The Martian last night, and it was absolutely breathtaking.  We had seen this movie in the theaters when it was initially released, and enjoyed it then.  I purchased the 4k version primarily as a test-drive of a new home video setup that I recently established.  I viewed this on a a 65""  LG OLED B-series television, connected to a Samsung UBD-K8500 true 4k player, and Sony DN1060 amplifier, powering 4 ceiling mounted speakers plus Polk center and sub-woofer (5.1) speakers.  Honestly--the picture was so crystal clear that several times during the movie my wife thought it was in  3D (it was not).  The scenery was really spectacular, and I was particularly struck by the (surprisingly few) outer space scenes, with the blackest of blacks contrasted against stars, spaceships, etc.  This is NOT a movie that will showcase your surround sound very much, but there are occasional scenes where having 5.1 or better is nice.

Now I do enjoy the experience of going to the theater, with their huge screens and superb audio.  I'm not keen on large or noisy crowds, but I will continue to go to the theaters occasionally, which is all our busy family schedule can ever accommodate.  I'll even splurge on the crazy priced popcorn now and again too.  But with the latest 4K media finally making its way to the market, I'll be equally happy to purchase the media for my personal library and pop my own corn at home!",1473638400,36,1454,4.726190476190476

The Extended cut is very much worth it. Even if one doesn't go through every minute of the film to find the extra bits of scenes that add up to the bonus ten minutes, the other extras are well worth it.

The additional ten minutes flesh things out some, by and large in very appropriate places and ways.  I'm very glad I purchased the Extended Version, and I thank the producer/director/whomever for making it available.  I am sorry, though, that the Extended Version didn't include one incident that was in the book.  In the book, as Watney is just entering the crater where the MAV is located, he accidentally flips the Rover and its trailer.  In the book he gets the Rover right side up, figures out a way to hook up the trailer after getting it right side up, and then completes the journey to the MAV.  Also, in the book, the final rescue of Watney is somewhat less dramatic than the one in the movie--Dr. Beck gets to the MAV more or less as planned, grabs Watney, and then returns to the Ares, with, I think about 5 seconds to spare.  I found the book's ending more satisfying than the one in the movie.  I also think the movie should have use the line in the book where the NASA media spokeswoman, Annie, when they're discussing the Mitch Purnell rescue plan, says, after all the male NASA bigwigs use names from The Lord of the Rings, ""none of you guys got laid in high school, right.""

7738621,1,B01ELI9E9O,"To those that may complain about this review and others similar to it: this review is specifically for this edition of the Bluray/4k Bluray release.  If you want a review of the movie itself, you can go to IMDB or other similar movie review sites, and for the record, I gave this a 10/10 on IMDB as far as the movie goes.

But I am giving this edition a 1-star review because it is poor and unethical (read greedy) practice what the studio did.  Like many others, I was unaware of a special edition ""in the works"", and I follow movie news very closely, especially films that I like and would like to own.  I bought the disc and I have not even had a chance to unwrap it, and this extended edition with all sorts of goodies comes out, AT THE SAME PRICE just a few weeks later.  The studio obviously knew that this edition was in the works and should have made it clear, but they chose a money grab.  I am very tired fo studios exploiting their customers, especially the ""early adopters.""

I am therefore giving this specific edition a 1 star in the hopes of discouraging others from purchasing the disc and encouraging the studios to continue this practice.  Call it a very public ""picket in front of the studio"" effort.  Great movie, terrible practice, and the more people that vocally complain about this product, the better chance we have of stopping unethical corporate greed, no matter where we see it.",1468800000,14,1406,4.482352941176471

While not publicized as such, the film is a kind of Modern Robinson Caruso story, without Friday; instead there is NASA that comes to his aid.

An astronaut is struck by some kind of projectile that pierces his suit and body while he is on Mars with some others during a violent Martian storm, when the spaceship must take off to avoid being killed in the storm. They cannot find him and feel assured that he is dead, but he is not. When he struggles back to the NASA property that his associates left, he realizes that he has some severe problems: insufficient oxygen, food, and water. But he is resourceful. After all he is a botanist. While food has not grown on Mars for centuries, if ever, he feels that he can find a way to do so.
Another problem is that everyone thinks he is dead. Even if they knew he was alive, they could not come to get him before he would die of lack of food and water.

He tries to distract himself by listening to the commander's discos, but he cannot stand her music.

The film shows his ingenuity. It shows what the people of the US and of China do when they find out that he is alive. We see the feelings of the people around the world about this abandoned man. It tells about the sacrifices that a half dozen people make to try to bring him home.",1467590400,,1448,4.239130434782608
7738641,5,B01ELI9E9O,"It has been a long time since my opinion of a movie changed a 2nd time seeing it so much for the better from the 1st time I saw it. This extended movie version of Andy Weir's rollicking novel is definitely worth seeing although the added footage wasn't very apparent to me. I remember LIKING it a lot when I caught its initial theatrical release, but now I LOVE this movie. My two favorite jokes from Weir's novel still did not make it into this longer cut (I was a bit let down by this when I saw it the 1st time), but the performances --apart from Matt Damon's stellar work-- jumped out at me a lot more on this viewing.
 Another big plus is the commentary track by Weir, screenwriter Drew Goddard & Ridley Scott although it's clear that Scott recorded his separately from the writers. Weir & Goddard are having a lot of fun whereas Scott is very earnest. All 3 voices are very insightful.
 I haven't got into the other extras yet, but the commentary track is worth the purchase price alone plus seeing one of last year's very best movies again.

7738650,5,B01ELI9E9O,"Film director Ridley Scott is well known for releasing direct-to-disc Extended Editions or Directors Cuts of selected movies, usually several months after the completion of their theatrical runs. His most notable Directors Cuts, which are usually vastly superior to their shorter theatrical releases, include Kingdom of Heaven, American Gangster, Gladiator, and now The Martian.

Ive already reviewed the theatrical release version on Blu-ray disc (BD) of The Martian here at Amazon. I think its a nearly perfect blend of drama, high adventure, suspense, comedy, and realistically futuristic technology. Starring Matt Damon, Jessica Chastain, Jeff Daniels, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and Sean Bean, and based on Andy Weirs novel of the same name, it tells the story of how an American astronaut, presumed killed in a violent sandstorm on Mars, is left behind to fight for his survival against incredibly long odds

The Martian Extended Edition is a 2-BD set, with one disc containing both the theatrical release and extended edition of Scotts feature film, and the other containing a wide variety of excellent special features  most of which are brand new. The extended edition is 151 minutes long and adds about 10 minutes of footage to the theatrical release. Most of the extra footage shows astronaut Mark Watneys heroic efforts to survive on Mars long enough for someone to come and rescue him. A few minutes are added to various scenes back on earth at Mission Control.

I didn't see any significant differences between the extended and theatrical versions of the film, so Im a bit undecided as to whether or not my purchase of The Martian Extended Edition was worth the extra money I paid for it. However, if there were anything that does make my purchase worthwhile, it would have to be that supplemental Special Features disc included in this 2-BD set. I thought the bonus features were all very entertaining, interesting, and helpful in enhancing my enjoyment of the feature film. Highly recommended for both the feature film and the outstanding bonus features.",1466553600,91,2061,5.161676646706587

7738658,5,B01ELI9E9O,"This review is for the EXTENDED EDITION Blu-ray. The five stars relate to the movie itself and the quality of this Blu-ray edition.

I had purchased the original Blu-ray when it was released. I doubt I would have purchased this again for only ten additional minutes of content except for the Amazon credit I needed to burn. Of course this is a no brainer if you are upgrading to Blu-ray or haven't purchased yet. I was unable to find an explanation online as to the actual extra scene content, so I have provided a synopsis here.

Spoilers Follow:
Most of the additional screen time relates to Mark Watney on the planet. Otherwise, there is a scene between Vincent and Annie after his press conference where she is unhappy with his performance. There is also a scene where the NASA group are discussing what Mark wrote in response to finding out they hadn't told the crew he was alive. This was supposedly changed for the movie to get the PG-13 theatrical rating. There is also a little more of Rich Purnell.

On Mars there are a number of scenes which just have a few seconds added on. This also relates to showing the lag in downtime with both Mark and NASA waiting for responses. There is a scene showing Commander Lewis letting Mark know they were coming for him. A couple of scenes where Mark decides to finish the work and experiments the crew were doing, and him doing that. A little additional time in the rover, and a section showing how he lived during the time it took him to get to the rocket.

There is four minutes of deleted scenes on disk two.
*Mark calculates rover time distances
*Hermes crew discuss sleeping arrangements
*Mark looks at Earth from Hermes with final VO

A good movie and an excellent looking picture. One of the few lately where the CGI doesn't look overdone.",1465862400,250,1794,4.559006211180124

7738662,1,B01ELI9E9O,"I do love this movie, but I'm going to chime in here on this issue and rate accordingly:

It's a shady practice to release an extended edition of a film so soon after the theatrical release hits video. Period.

Some here are saying it's wrong to give a film one star because of this studio practice. I'm not giving the film one star: I'm giving this edition release one star. I won't buy it. I won't spend another $20 for an extra ten minutes of footage. Another reviewer said this was rumored to be happening while the film was still in the theater. I follow a lot of film news and never stumbled upon said rumor, so pointing a finger at me for my ""lack of patience"" is wrong. I didn't jump on this release, I jumped on a good price not knowing when that proce would come back around and not knowing an extended edition was in the works.

So, yes, I'm complaining about this. However, I won't begrudgingly buy it when I'm done. I'm not the sort to constantly upgrade my film collection as I rarely even upgrade from DVD to BluRay without a compelling reason.",1465516800,43,1059,4.338383838383838

To whom it may concern: Money grabbing is what studios are going to do. Stop acting surprised when they do it to the ones you liked. Stop complaining about not getting to see bonus footage you clearly didn't expect to receive (when buying it the first time) unless you pay some extra money. And please stop acting like you're actually making a difference when you express your anger.
