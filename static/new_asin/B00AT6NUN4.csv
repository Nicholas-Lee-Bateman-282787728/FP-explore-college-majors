5508290,5,B00AT6NUN4,"For me, it's between ET and Raiders. This is just a great film. I saw Super 8 last year, which made me think of ET and how superior a movie it is, in my opinion.",1344988800,,161,3.6285714285714286
5508291,5,B00AT6NUN4,"This is very confusing to have reviews for the 2002 release clipped onto the blu-ray release.  You can't read the reviews to see if the blu-ray is the original, not CGI E.T.

The reviews should be separate for different releases, this should be common sense.",1344988800,15,258,4.711111111111111
5508292,5,B00AT6NUN4,"ET the extra terrestrial is one of the all time greatest movies in my book besides Jaws. The fact that they are restoring this movie from it's original film elements makes me want to praise Steven Spielberg. I am so happy that the original film version of this movie will live on and hopefully push the 2002 crap version into a deep dark hole where it will never see the lights of day. Hopefully somebody will burn that hole and turn it into a gaping crater with no parts of the 2002 version left. I remember when I was a kid a couple of years ago and my Uncle brought a whole box of old Vhs tapes to my house for us  to watch. I watched it so many times the film wore out and I had to dump it. Ever since then I wanted a new better looking original upscaled print of the 1982 version. Go to hell 2002 version. Sorry for my language for a few of you out there who don't like hearing swear words. But, anyway this film is a masterpiece. It racked up ticket sales for the rest of the summer and became the biggest box office hit of its time. Until Jurassic Park came out 11 years later. Here is some trivia; Mars candy company was originaly asked to put there M&Ms candy into the movie for promotional reasons, but they declined that offer and the hershey candy company got to put in there candy called Reeses's Pieces. There sales shot up by 65 percent. I bet who ever declined for the Mars company was banging there heads for years to come after that. I cannot wait for this blu ray release. I want October to come right now! I love this movie to much to wait until then. For a restored picture and sound and hours of bonus features this blu ray sure looks like it will fly off shelves and be talked about for a while. I feel the same way about the jaws blu ray coming out on August 14th. ET the extra terrestrial is a masterpiece that will live on for many generations!",1343088000,,1870,4.151515151515151
5508293,5,B00AT6NUN4,"The reviews on every ET video are exactly the same which obviously is screwed up, after searching the internet for 30 minutes I found that the 30 year anniversary Blueray actually has the original 82 version, not the remake that everyone is bashing here because even spielberg hates that one: [...]

Please fix this set of reviews Amazon and stop wasting everyone's time!!!",1341878400,3,373,4.920634920634921
5508294,5,B00AT6NUN4,"I am so stoked that Spielberg has kept his word and restored the original film. The guns are back. The original lines are back. All the stuff he screwed up in the 2002 release is gone. This is the movie I loved and that's why I am buying this 2012 Blu-Ray edition.

If you want details on what this Blu-Ray edition fixes, go to the Slate.com web site and search for ""Original E.T.""",1341792000,4,381,4.219178082191781
5508295,5,B00AT6NUN4,"I am so excited for this movie to finally come onto blu-ray and only this time the 2002 version has put its guns back into the movie without those absurd cgi walkie talkies that partly ruined the classic and now this movie will be a whole lot better than the one that came out on DVD. Not only we get the guns back but we get a perfect hi-def crystal clear picture too with a 7.1 surround sound! E.T. will be the one to watch when it comes out in October. I will be getting this blu ray movie to see a better 2002 version with two added scenes still enforced into the movie.

I remember watching E.T. back in 1982 when I was a kid and how much I really enjoyed the movie and now it's gonna bring me back those memories I grew up watching. I think it also includes the 1982 version of E.T. and I hope it does so I can see the original without the added scenes and the added cgi movements of E.T. I'll be looking forward to it.",1338595200,7,925,4.0
5508296,5,B00AT6NUN4,"I love this movie! When I was a little girl this scared me, but It changed my life when I watched it on t.v. Last year and I bought the movie and I'm fixing to get the doll like I use to have. This is a classic, clearly no one thought that when making this. I have fallin' in love with E.T. And it's a beautiful made movie and fun and so sweet. WARNING little children my find this scary and there is light cussing.",1338508800,2,415,3.8941176470588235
5508297,5,B00AT6NUN4,"I give the movie E.T (1982 version) a 5 star rating. I wish Speilberg didn't have to add CGI effects to this film on the 20th anniversary release of the film in 2002. For me, it ruined a childhood classic.  Every time I go on to Amazon's website to see if E.T has a release date, it just says ""Sign Up to be notified when this becomes available and we will send you an e-mail"".  Considering that this 2012, and E.T is one of the best movies ever released in the history of cinema, why on Earth is it taking Universal so long to release E.T onto the Blu-Ray format?  It doesn't make any sense to me if they can release junk like Cobra and Tango & Cash out on Blu-Ray, but E.T. has yet to be released onto Blu-Ray with state of the art audio and picture quality.  The folks at Amazon need to remove the E.T Blu-Ray from their website if it is not going to be made available for the public.  Blu-Ray has been around for about 5 years now.  I would think E.T. would be one of the first films to be released out on to the Blu-Ray format.  When E.T. finally makes it to Blu-Ray, I sure hope Universal just includes the 1982 version (NOT the 2002 edition) and Universal pictures doesn't include all the extras that were released on the DVD Ultimate Gift Set (which I Own).  It would be nice to see brand new documentaries and featurettes on the making of the film, as well as deleted scenes (including the one with Harrison Ford as Elliot's principal), Teasers, Trailers and TV Spots all from 1982. The movie I give 5 stars, the Blu-Ray no stars.  Come on Universal, get your act together!  I know there are many fans of this film who would like to own this film on Blu-Ray, with a 7.1 digital surround sound audio quality and prestine picture quality.",1334102400,,1745,4.276595744680851
5508298,4,B00AT6NUN4,"I'm glad this exists.  It took long enough.  The 2002 DVD edition had a terribly designed case and went out of print in 2004 or somewhere around there...I did buy one from a media (CD/DVD) library club whose name will go unmentioned to prevent the ire of Amazon Inc., but I for some reason sold it...I've gotten more rational about which items I sell and why I sell them, but there's still some ""soul searching"" to go...I don't watch the same movie over and over and over again, so if owning a DVD collection isn't morally wrong, I always need to set forth criteria for which DVDs to own.  I don't believe personal taste can be a defense for some of the junk that production companies put out.  However, I also agree that many people just don't know quality when they see it.  I HEART HUCKABEES (2004) was a good movie, but so many preconceived notions were shattered and instead of people going with the flow, they became confused and dismissed the film.  It was more dramatic than comedic, so those who were expecting a laughter inducing 90 minutes can't be expected to endorse the film...some people don't have time to watch a movie they've already seen merely for the sake of giving other people an accurate and fair account of their experience with the film.  So, where does E.T. fit in after I've bought and re-sold it several times?  Well, I haven't watched it in a long time.  During the early-mid 2000s (I was born in '83), I got a lot of satisfaction watching this movie, repeatedly.  I like the wooded areas shown in the film and housing complex etc...it somewhat reminds me of my time in Ft. Ord, California.  It's got a very unique look and feel to it.  I've spent over half of my life so far in southeast Missouri, and I sometimes feel like I'm dreaming when I recall some of the landscapes I walked on or near during my time in Monterrey County, California.  I also like the quiet-ness of many scenes in the film.  Some of the scenes are deliberately noisy, but in a sentimental way, meant to express the nature of having lots of company and enjoying it.  You get the sense that Elliot, the protagonist, is kind of a loner, or at least feels like one...
Storywise, there isn't a whole lot to say.  The summary on any of the home video editions may be inaccurate, but that's what happens when trying to cram a 2 hr movie into two paragraphs using the English language.  Especially when most English speaking folk have very little knowledge of their own dictionary.  The gist is there though.  Amazon might have one posted on this product page.
One thing I've been hitting the roof over is the change in the cover-art graphics that took place in 1996 and stayed that way until this digibook blu ray/dvd combo pack was released in June of 2013.  It was originally a BestBuy exclusive, but no longer.  I don't know when or if I'll ever enjoy this film again.  As I started to indicate, there's not a whole lot to gain by watching it after seeing 20 times, give or take, and for an analytical person like myself, it's hard to really put one's finger on why this film comes off as being so damn good.  It's pretty much a children's film, meant to be watched with parents (hence the PG rating), but adults can find themselves lost in it if they aren't foul people with no hope of salvation.  This fact alone makes it a marked achievement as a work of art.  As product, that just depends on how much that fact impresses you (or doesn't).",1303430400,,3444,4.454545454545454
5508299,5,B00AT6NUN4,"I first saw E.T. back in 1982 right before I turned 6 years old so I could barely remember the movie. Back then I did however have the official book which came with a record that was told by the very young Drew Barrymore. I used to just let my imagination run wild as i listed to the record and read the book with it. When I went to see the 30th anniversary at the theater last week I have to say once again I was so blown away. Watching it at the theater was one of the most amazing movie experiences of my life, cause it was as if I had never seen it and it brought out that little kid in me again. I remember back when this movie first came out in 1982 I had to have my E.T. cereal LOL. When Elliot and E.T. both got sick I had tears coming down my eyes and that happened more than once during the movie and Im a 35 year old guy, but this just touched me again and made me feel like I was the one loosing my new found best friend. If you saw this movie when you were a kid check it out again because it is truly one of the BEST Movie Experiences. Special thanks to the director Steven Spielberg for bringing E.T. back to us 30 years later and allowing me and the new generation in 2012 to feel like a care free kid again because it was well worth it. With the amazing quality and sound of blu-ray and the new digital copy we can now experience E.T. In the best way possible in our homes. Also this is the original unaltered version and not the one that upset so many die hard fans in 2002 with the 20th anniversary edition. The blu-ray looks the best it ever has spectacular and natural conidering it's a thirty year old movie. The sound has never sounded better and just makes the movie that much more engaging.

Updated  October, 2012

I was also pleasently surprised that the iTunes edition included a 1080p edition and regular Standard definition of the digital copy.. The ultraviolet copy I downloaded via vudu also has the 1080p version and is in 5.1 surround sound. This is the way they should release all digital and ultraviolet copies.",1024099200,,2047,4.164141414141414

5508340,5,B00AT6NUN4,"This blu-ray edition is really, really gorgeous.  They did away with all the weird, silly computer animation that mucked up some of the original DVD edition some years ago.  This is a splendidly re-mastered version of the original film.  I agree with other reviewers who have commented that this reminds them of seeing it in the theater 4,000 years ago.  On our relatively cheap, no-frills HD 1080p 43"" screen the blu-ray version really is perfect - colors are super warm and vibrant, instead of faded and flat or artificially harsh - really a treat (this is not necessarily the case for other blu-ray versions of films from this era). The DVD packaged with this is also the newly-remastered, no-nonsense edition.  I haven't tried that disc out but I'd say even if you don't have a blu-ray player, I think this newer DVD will still be an upgrade.  The extra features are certainly  fun for us older fans, although I think they have been included in previous releases.  If you are a big fan of E.T., and you have a blu-ray or DVD player, I would highly recommend this version.",1514937600,4,1075,4.650793650793651

5508395,3,B00AT6NUN4,"I purchased this Blu-Ray edition because it was advertised as being the original 1982 Theatrical Release.  For the most part it was with the rifles instead of walkie-talkies and the Halloween costume scene terrorist vs. hippie, but what still made this different than the original 1982 release was the omission of the bathroom scenes with E.T. and the toothpaste and the bathtub scene with E.T. under water in the tub.  Also not included was a Halloween scene with eggs being thrown at the car just before Elliot is found to be missing.  So, if you anticipate getting the COMPLETE 1982 theatrical version this release still is NOT there.",1496275200,,637,4.87962962962963

5508402,1,B00AT6NUN4,The new dvd I purchased needs to be replaced because it is defected. Halfway threw the movie it has no sound. The entire last part of the movie sputters out sound for ten seconds. What the heck? This is the se one d d I have bough ten from Amazon that has had problems with the sound. I have new DVDs from Disney and they never have a sound problem. Very frustrating.,1493424000,,367,4.111111111111111

5508404,1,B00AT6NUN4,"Right before I started watching this movie, my wife told me she had ""seen it before"" and ""it doesn't make sense"" and is ""unrealistic.""  After seeing it, I similarly conclude that it is far-fetched, to put it mildly.  An alien with magic powers comes to Earth on a spaceship and makes friends with suburban children.  The theme of friendship is the only (slightly) redeeming feature of this film.  Even though I started watching it at 6 pm, I couldn't stop yawning and feeling sleepy--the film is ennui-inducing.  I was repulsed by the repeated use of profanity by little children in the dialogue.  The film is full of Hollywood clich&eacute;s: the repetitive use of the phrase ""oh my God,"" the use of the superstitious word ""miracle"" twice, the tympani-roll at the end of the musical score, and not one but two car-chase scenes.",1493164800,,828,4.795774647887324

The movie itself is great. My kids both love it, with my youngest requesting to watch it again and again.

Picture quality is great. I watched on a self calibrated Panasonic plasma set and didn't see anything that made me think this isn't a good transfer.

I don't have a proper surround sound set up yet so I can't fully rate the sound. But using the sets built-in speakers it sounded great.",1480204800,,539,4.479591836734694

5508530,5,B00AT6NUN4,"With the release of George Lucas' original ""Star Wars"" film in 1977 (later re-titled ""Star Wars: Episode IV: A New Hope"") and Steven Spielberg's ""Close Encounter of the Third Kind"", the genre of Science Fiction film was reborn into the mainstream. Previously it had been primarily marketed to adolescent boys as either b-films or cliff-hanger series in matinees from circa 1935 to 1970. For about 5 to 6 years from circa 1977 to 1983, the entertainment industry cranked out tons of Science Fiction based films and television shows, most of which were of marginal quality, such as ""Buck Rogers"", ""Battlestar Gallactica"" and ""The Black Hole"" which were simply trying to mirror the success of Star Wars. A few were superb standout's, such as ""Alien"", ""Blade Runner"" and ""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan"". At the end of this short period when the studios were saturating movie theaters with just about anything with space ships, Steven Spielberg and company produced and released ""E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial"".

Unlike most of Hollywood's Science Fiction offerings from the release of Star Wars in 1977 to its third installment ""Return of the Jedi"" in 1983, ""E.T."" didn't rely on space ships and galactic battles. Yes, there's a space ship in a couple of scenes, and even a few technological miracles, but that's not the main point. ""E.T."" is primarily about how children see the world as opposed to adults. In a strange way, ""E.T."" probably has more in common with ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" than ""Star Wars"", the former being injustice as seen by children in a similar way. The themes of ""E.T."" are so moving because we see the alien through children who don't quite fear things the way adults do. Not to say that children don't have fears, but sometimes wonder can overcome fear, which is I think at the heart of ""E.T."" The alien is also very childlike, often exploring and getting into things he shouldn't be. ""E.T."" is thematically opposite from ""Alien"" released just two years earlier in which an horrific alien creatures infiltrates and attacks a galactic space ship. So although ""Alien"", ""Close and Encounters of the Third Kind"" and the original ""Star Wars"" films are in more or less the same Science Fiction genre, the similarities end there for the most part.

The story-line is deceptively simple but allows for the development of not only the characters but their relationships. A spaceship has landed on Earth and some beings from another solar system have been exploring our planet in a wooded area not far from a suburban community. For them, our planet is an alien world. One of the explorers was so curious about our planet he wandered far away from the space ship. Government men became aware that something was going on, and when they made their presence known, the ship was forced to leave, causing their companion to be stranded on Earth. Throughout the film are the government men who are investigating what's going on, and they become somewhat adversarial to the alien being and the children. Intensely curious about us and our planet, he wanders into the suburban community and hides in a shed of a house where a single mom and her three children reside. He is discovered by the younger son Elliott (Henry Thomas), the middle child of the three.

One of the most effective sequences is how Elliott and the alien meet and find common ground. Elliott leaves trails of Reese's Pieces which are picked up by the alien. But instead of eating them, the alien places a handful of them on Elliott's lap as a gesture of friendship and goodwill. Some kind of message has passed between them, not of spoken language but based on friendship gestures. Interestingly, the alien is not afraid; the alien has to persuade Elliott that he has nothing to fear. As events unfold, Elliott is vaguely aware that the adults in his life won't understand the alien, and he keeps him a secret. Eventually he introduces him to his siblings, who he has nicknamed ""E.T."". In one of the most interesting scenes, E.T. communicates that he needs to contact his race and let them know they can come for him. ""E.T. phone home"" becomes the line of the film. And he helps them build a kind of intergalactic telephone made of electronic toys. However, the adults finally catch up with Elliott and intervene between him and the alien. In one of the most disturbing scenes of the film, the government men infiltrate Elliott's house, and they are dressed in space suits, as if they are the invaders.

One of the most striking aspects of ""E.T."" is that nearly every scene is shot from the height of a child, just above the waist of an adult. E.T. is short and he relates to the children but seems much less interested in the adults, as if he has a sense the adults will be too quick to judge who and what he is before he can give them a chance. When the mother finally is shown E.T. she freaks out. This is the essence of E.T. about the wonder of childhood and how children, even if they may be inexperienced, are sometimes more open to new possibilities than adults. The children exhibit love towards E.T. whereas we get the sense the adults are operating more out of fear.",1466380800,,5149,4.724137931034483

A talented film maker. The cast in the movie all do a great job. The movie I feel as aged well. I loved the score in the movie too. I got to see the movie when it first came out and it is was I felt a great movie back then as it is now. I am glad that  Stephen Spielberg decided to release the original version of the film and not the altered version he released dvd. For the movie has a special place in my heart and didn't really like the idea of the film being changed. The special effects back were great for their time and they still hold upto today. He added digital effects in the dvd version he had released a few years back and I felt it took away from the charm of the film. I am looking forward to showing this movie to my son.

Invite your friends who are way pass their 40's to come over and see it. Then have a party for your kids and grand kids. Compared to what's available on the market today, this film may appear a bit lame. But appreciate it for the impact it had on our generation and the manner in which it influence all films in the genera to come. ET, where are you?

(Look at the cord coming out of that phone! Look at that old flashlight! Did all the doors look like that in the 80's? Their hair looks ridiculous! Can we lash plastic crates to the front of our bikes?)  It was such a fun flash-back for me to share with the kids!

If you're going to get the movie, go ahead and buy a big bag of Reese's Pieces as well for the movie night because trust me, you're going to be craving them after watching Elliot throw them all over the woods, trying to lure in ET!",1447286400,,673,4.1692307692307695

5508646,5,B00AT6NUN4,"One of my absolute favorite movies of all time.  It came out when my kids were small and we watched it together over and over on VHS. I didn't get tired of it like so many ""kid"" movies. I believe there are as many adults who love this movie as children. I was very happy to find it in an updated format.
The story is more complex that first meets the eye.  It includes some teenage issues, divorce's effect on kids, and of course the hope that if we ever do have and extraterrestrial visitor that someone that is kind and compassionate will be our representative.
ET is a Halloween staple in our house to this day and yes, I still cry a little when ET says ""come"" and Elliot says ""stay.""
Introduce it to your kids or grandkids.  You won't be sorry.",1446768000,2,748,4.216783216783217

When I opened the case the DVD and Blu Ray discs were inside along with the Digital Copy redemption code. This disc contains the original 1982 version of the movie. I was VERY glad to see the CGI ""enhanced"" 2002 version is NOT included, but there are a few of the deleted scenes that were on the 2002 (25th anniversary ed.) included here that were enjoyable. I can't say anything that hasn't been said already- ET is magical, wonderful, and I'm very glad it is still available so my kids can enjoy it as much as I did 30 years ago",1435708800,9,629,4.478260869565218

5508749,5,B00AT6NUN4,"This not just a great film but this time they did the packaging properly. The discs themselves are securely placed in trays and are EASY to remove. The Blu-ray disc is in the front and the DVD is in the back; In between is a very interesting bio of how the movie was made and also information about the actors. In other words it's a Blu-ray/DVD book. Over the years I have purchased many collector editions of movies with similar packaging but the packaging for this version of  E.T. is probably the best because it was well thought out and quality made. Amazons price of 14 bucks and change is a very good deal, I know because I always do comparison shopping.  .",1430265600,2,663,4.382113821138211

Finally, after about the 6th freeze up, the kids asked me to turn it off.  Now when I try to return it, it says it's too late.  Well, all I can say is, this was a very expensive one time viewing movie.  Will be much more careful when ordering videos.  No movie, no money back, no exchange, gee, thanks. I would give it a 5 star for the first viewing and a 0 star for everything else.  Boo, ET definitely went home.",1424304000,,679,4.122137404580153

I was warned about how bad Ultraviolet was. Regrettably, I ignored the warnings.  I could find no way to get the movie into iTunes.

Getting these movies onto your computer is a giant, time-consuming hassle.  It is much better to have a TRUE digital copy, on a physical disk.

I have purchased many other movies that come with a true digital copy.  In just a few seconds I have it in iTunes.

5508866,5,B00AT6NUN4,"What struck me most about this movie after re-watching it recently is Spielberg's treatment of the old Man vs. Nature theme. Typically, Nature is portrayed as spiritual, brutal, or a combination of both. Society is shown as being largely bad and shallow. Artists blame this shallowness on modern society's distance from Nature or its attempts to pave over forests and swamps with suburbs and shopping malls.

Spielberg's movie is special because he shows that our current human society is not so bad. Unlike other dour intellectuals such as John Boorman and Terrence Malick, Spielberg actually likes pop culture. He admits that we have lost some kind of deeper sensitivity in our transition from Nature to Society, but he shows that these two entities cannot live together for long. Each must respect the other but remain in its own space. Thus Elliott and E.T. break their telepathic connection; thus they both must part at the end. They can't inhabit the same body, nor can they inhabit the same world.

Spielberg's message is that we can't return to Nature, nor should we try to if we could. The belief that we can return to Nature is more of a fairy tale than this movie. His admonition that we should stay in society because Nature has no place for us is nothing new. What is new is how he tells us it's OK to embrace pop culture. Yoda, Jaws, Reese's Pieces, pizza, and Dungeons and Dragons are not just acceptable to him--they're a source of joy and wonder equal to the Heavens that fill the night sky.

P.S. I own the version of this movie with all of the digital tinkering and the most unfortunate removal of the rifles from the agents and officers at the end of the movie. I agree Spielberg and his buddies at ILM should not have made those changes. Fortunately, the movie is so excellent that it withstands those little tarnishes and nicks.",1419724800,,1850,4.686153846153847

A little tid-bit of information: Mars Candy Company was approached to use there M&M candies in a scene and turned Steven Spielberg down. Reese's Pieces were then used. Since the movie was a box office smash, I wonder if Reese's Pieces also became a smash that year?

5508914,4,B00AT6NUN4,"So many years ago we had purchased E.T. on VHS tape. Somewhere along the line I copied the movie onto a DVD, as I did with many VHS based movies. Unfortunately the quality of those old blank DVDs were not good and one by one the movies failed. We've had to buy those that we wanted in our library over again. So it is with E.T.

It had been many years since we watched E.T. our four-year-old son (third set of kids spread over 40 years!!!) was old enough to watch it. The quality of the old DVD movie was poor but watchable - until the last 10 minutes which failed to play. So out with the old and in with the new.

The quality of this video is stunning compared to the old VHS movie that even lost more in the copy process.

E.T. as a movie actually passed the test of time well. I actually enjoyed it more this time than ever before. It's a fun fantasy / action / thriller for a for-year-old, and for me. It's fun to see Drew Barrymore, now 39 years old and quite attractive, as a cute little one.",1416009600,,999,4.060913705583756

5508937,5,B00AT6NUN4,"This review will appear in two forms: in the original, with adjectives, and in a revised form in which the adjectives have been replaced by walkie-talkies. At this point in time, ""E.T."" is unassailable as a heartwarming classic, a label with which I happily agree. This comment is strictly about the Anniversary edition Blu-Ray and DVD. The DVD has a special feature that is unusual and fascinating: the musical score played LIVE at the Hollywood Bowl under John Williams' baton. It appears as an alternate audio track. Unless I've blown it, the Blu-Ray does not have this alternate track, just a featurette backgrounding how the event took place. But the overall experience of the high-def transfer is evocative of the original theatrical experience, and for that reason alone this is worth archiving.""

5509007,5,B00AT6NUN4,"What is there to say about one of the most popular films ever made? To keep things brief, E.T. deserves the praise. In many ways, it is the ultimate kids movie. Spielberg and Co. could turn even the most cynical viewer viewer into a teary-eyed baby by the end of this film. It perfectly captures the essence of childhood, the wonder, the shenanigans, the laughs, the hardships, the love, and it does so with such a fun and effortless quality. The story flows and excites and doesn't let up until the final goodbye. In terms of sheer storytelling, E.T. is flawless. It hits all the right beats and cements its content with memorable shots and set pieces that have become a part of the American subconscious. It is arguable that the film is a little too polished and calculated when it comes to story structure, but it's predictable nature is overshadowed by it's genuine heart. E.T. was beautifully shot by Spielberg, expertly melding together the subject matter with shots that belong in a film 101 textbook. The score by John Williams is soaring, dark, and cheesy, everything that the film needed it to be. The performances are all fantastic, especially Henry Thomas as Elliott. His bonding and love for the horrid-looking alien is what makes the film what it is. Robert MacNaughton, Drew Barrymore, and Dee Wallace round out the great family cast. Simply put, this movie is nothing less than iconic. It's dark, fun, captivating, and one of Spielberg's best.",1402358400,2,1459,4.816733067729084

5509014,5,B00AT6NUN4,"If there was one movie I've been begging to see on Blu-Ray, it's Steven Spielberg's ""E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial"". Most of all, if there was one movie I wanted to see in its original, unedited version, it's Steven Spielberg's ""E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial"". After sitting through that dismal 2002 version where walkie-talkies had replaced shotguns as the new weapons of mass destruction and ""hippies"" replaced ""terrorists"" as a dirty word, I stopped watching ""E.T."" and vowed never to watch it again until it was digitally restored AND restored in its original roots.

Well, I am very delighted to say that this Blu-Ray achieves both goals. The 2002 version is gone and the original version is back in its proper place. Most of all, the original ""E.T."" looks like a godsend on Blu-Ray. The movie presents the original with a beautiful high-def transfer and phenomenal soundtrack, using the high restoration 35mm elements as a guideline. ""E.T."" has never looked this gorgeous and is most likely to never be improved after this. In addition, the Blu-Ray contains two new bonus features, both of them worthwhile viewing. The first is a short interview with Spielberg, talking about the history of the film. The second (and easily the best) is the on-set production footage of how the movie was made, similar to the on-set feature in the ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" Blu-Ray. This Blu-Ray edition is so good that I completely forgot about that 2002 travesty.

Now onto the movie:

""The story of a boy and his dog"", snickered a wiseass critic from Village Voice. ""Close Encounters for kids"", snarls another critic. A far more hyperbolic movie writer from Jump Cut refers to it as a parable of sexism. ""E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial"" is none of these, but all of the following: a heartwarming family film, a delightfully funny comedy, a touching fairy tale with unintentional messianic connections and, from Spielberg's perspective, a heartbreaking coming-of-age story about broken families and the need for emotional healing. It is also a cinematic masterpiece.

Almost every phenomenon is guaranteed a swift backlash: we see this in music, books, TV shows, paintings, poetry and, most of all, movies. Because cinema is a deeply visual and emotional medium, movies are forever judged not just by their quality, but by the passage of time. Many of the supposedly great movies lose their luster, if not their charm, and some now look like relics of their time. But more often than not, it is their popularity that determines their fate. When a movie becomes hugely successful, there is guaranteed nitpicking, even if such nitpicking is invalid, and that affects the movie's stature in history books.

That is not the case of ""E.T."", which at the time outgrossed ""Star Wars"" as the most successful movie of all time. With its blend of wonder, emotional honesty and poignancy, subtle humor and warm-spirited (if satirical) perspective of American suburbia, ""E.T."" couldn't be more different from the big-budget special effects extravaganzas that are still the norm today. We are so used to the explosions, the special effects and the ADD-induced pacing of movies that watching ""E.T."" today will come across as a shock: the pacing is deliberate, there are no heart-stomping action sequences, the special effects are mostly composed of a puppet and some matte shots, and the observance of its child and adult characters will strike many viewers as protracted. But it's that ""protractedness"", along with the purity, innocence and simple beauty of ""E.T"", that continues to endure, while these blockbusters (as well as the gloom-and-doom independent dramas and the crassly crafted exploitation fare) will relinquish in obscurity, appealing only to a cult following.

But what makes ""E.T."" resonate is its story: an alien from outer space is left stranded on Earth and befriends a lonely boy named Elliot, abandoned by his father, and they form a strong friendship. The story couldn't be any simpler, and yet we are drawn to E.T. and Elliot and the bond they share, as well as E.T.'s interactions with Elliot's brother Michael and sister Gertie.

Under Spielberg's superb direction, what could have been a maudlin family movie turns into a profoundly magical experience, something that rarely happens these days. The child actors are absolutely impeccable, as they feel less like movie kids and more like ""real"" kids. Drew Barrymore made an impression as the adorable Gertie and her scenes with E.T. where she dresses him in a weird costume and teaches him how to spell have a cuteness that doesn't feel cloying. Robert MacNaughton convincingly plays the mean but ultimately caring older brother Michael, who starts off as Elliot's tormenter but ultimately becomes an ally in helping E.T. get home.

But it's Henry Thomas who holds your attachment as Elliot. His bond with E.T. is the emotional anchor that gives this movie dramatic weight. When Elliot and E.T. soar to the skies on the bike in that famous scene, you could feel his excitement. You sense his heartbreak when he fears that E.T. is dead and confesses that he doesn't know how to feel. And you feel Elliot (and E.T.'s) pain when they bid themselves a melancholic farewell at the end of the movie.

E.T. himself is a marvelous special effects creation. An endearing alien combining the personalities of Albert Einstein, Yoda, Bambi and Benji, E.T. provides both some of the movie's most moving sequences (the healing finger, ""I'll be right here"") and the funniest (getting intoxicated on soda, following a kid wearing a Yoda costume). You become so attached to E.T. that he ceases being a special effects and becomes a lovable character.

Many of the popular and critically acclaimed movies of 80s feel dated and artificial. Some try to evaluate those movie's ""merits"", but to no avail. Not ""E.T."" ""E.T"" could've been made today and feel just as relevant. ""E.T."" is about wonder, loss, love, childhood, innocence and growing up, themes that strike a chord to young and older viewers alike, themes that seem depressingly scarce in light of today's hip gross-out comedies and noisy action blockbusters. It is one of the most moving cinematic experiences ever made and it's a movie that is mandatory viewing, even if you dislike the movie (and there are very little people who do) or Spielberg himself. But to everyone else who has seen it, to revisit it again is to revisit something that has been lost, something that we hold deep in our hearts and wish could be re-produced again on screen.

5509044,5,B00AT6NUN4,"This movie ranks as one of Steven Spielberg's greatest creations and it still holds up to this very day!  It is one of those movies that just shows the magic and wonder, while also giving a little bit of something to everyone.

This is a movie to bring home!",1389571200,,258,4.244897959183674

5509048,5,B00AT6NUN4,E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial (Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy + UltraViolet)  Excellent classic movie. I buy it for me and my kids enyoy so much.  Thank's,1388534400,,149,4.6923076923076925
5509049,5,B00AT6NUN4,"It really doesn't matter what types of movies you prefer.  Every now and then most of us like to 'revisit' our favorites.  This was one of the reasons why ""ET--The Extra-Terrestrial"" sat on my AMAZON Wish List for awhile. In spite of constantly listening to John Williams' excellent score, I wanted to give myself plenty of space before watching the movie again.

This BLU-RAY+DVD+DIGITAL+ULTRAVIOLET package is a High Resolution Masterpiece.  And for the first time---7.1 Audio.  So if your living room, den or mancave is state of the art, the DVD specs are considerably better than what was available at your local movie theatre.

Most of us know the story by heart, but in this anniversary edition many of the behind the scenes questions are answered. For example...how many of you reading this knew that Steven Spielberg was constantly pressured to do a sequel to ""Close Encounters Of The Third Kind?"" While 'Encounters' was focused on adult alien encounters, ET was targeted toward children. The fact that most grown-ups quickly dismiss the thoughts and words  youngsters utter became the perfect set-up for a wonderful fairytale.

Best of all...most of the surviving cast members are still alive and have reunited to express their thoughts about the picture.  Spielberg makes many comments and observations as well. Also included are deleted scenes, on-set footage, original designs about creature imagery and several other fascinating facts for film geeks like myself.

Overall...the DVD is great and this gentle story still makes me smile.",1388448000,,1547,5.201612903225806
5509050,5,B00AT6NUN4,"I enjoyed this movie years earlier, remembered it, and bought it for my grandsons, ages 6 - 8, although I think my grand daughters my grand daughters, when old enough, will enjoy it too.  This movie offers lots of suspence, action and fun.  It illustrates the power of kindness to overcome fear and how children can be very courageous in protecting a friend.",1388188800,,358,4.666666666666667
5509051,4,B00AT6NUN4,Bought it for 5 year old grandson.  He liked the E. T. ride at Universal Studios. He loved the movie!,1388016000,,101,4.05
5509052,5,B00AT6NUN4,Just gave my vcr tape to the library they where happy to get it. Great movie a classic. obviously I have owned more than one copy. hope this is the last one I buy. and that if near death my daughters will not run off with this copy the way they have a lot of my things.,1387843200,,269,3.736842105263158
5509053,3,B00AT6NUN4,"Okay, so I've shown this to several different kids at different times thinking they would enjoy a classic. The movie is too slow for children in today's age. The hospital scene where ET and the boy character is the part where children started to become interested.  On a side note, children also enjoyed the part where ET learned how to speak English words, such as ""ET phone home"". We might have enjoyed this as kids, but I've found (with my experiences) that kids today just aren't that interested.

Pros:
1. it's a classic
2. I enjoyed this as a kid.

Cons:
1. Movie was filmed mostly in low light, so projection quality isn't up to par. (I've seen older movies on DVD that were much crisper)
2. The movie doesn't stand up to the test of time for today's youth to stay focused. (well at least the ones I tried to impress)",1387843200,,824,4.407894736842105
5509054,4,B00AT6NUN4,"This must have been just a remarkable movie when it released decades ago.  I can't believe I missed this in my youth.  Without that sentimentality attached and watching this movie in adulthood, it loses some of the charm I'm sure holds dear to other viewers.  The effects are very outdated, the camera direction is amateur-ish, and the blatant brandname throw-ins are kind of distracting.
But take a step back, and watch the film through the eyes of a young child taken in by the magic of E.T. and the adventure he brings, and it's hard not to love this movie.  It's so simple, but yet so magical.  I feel like I lost a part of my childhood after watching this movie, as it would have been so much more amazing if I'd have watched it when I was young.",1387843200,,751,4.374100719424461

That I wish I could see more of.
The Video transfer is excellent. As well as the sound.
And it offers the original mono sound track for purists/but I find the DTS-HD master audio 5.1 surround sound to be a big improvement.
And the Special features are also excellent.
And the documentary the shark is working is the full length version as well

Others articulate far better than I can that the remade version tainted the original in many ways, but you get both here and you can decide for yourself (I'd give the remade version 3 stars, it's still a good film).

I loved it, the kids loved it but old sourpuss Mom didn't like it. Don't ask me why, I haven't any idea. But the kids really loved it. A couple of weeks later I took my son with me to the mall to J.C. Penney to get some new tires installed on my car. It was gonna take a couple of hours so I thought about what to do in the interim. I asked what time it was (I didn't have a watch on for some reason) and the store clerk told me and I figured we could catch the movie again. I quick walked to the theater on the other side of the mall with my little guy behind trying to keep up and asking me ""Where are we goin' Dad?, Where are we goin"" Dad?"" and me saying ""You'll see when we get there, come on hurry up now!"" Got to the theater in time, got tickets, walked down the long hall, had the guy take the tickets and give us the stubs and got in line for some snacks (popcorn, drinks, candy etc.). My son looks up at me and asks ""Are we goin' to see a movie?"" I said ""Yeah! I thought you might like to see E.T. again!"" With that he jumped up and I picked him up in my arms and hugged him! Some guy looked at me like I was some sick pervert. I looked at him and said ""Hey! He's my son!"" I will never forget my son's face that time. You will never see happiness like that in your life!

Eventually this little alien becomes a foster member of their family, drinking soda, watching television, and taking part in trick-or-treating during Halloween. However the secret gets out and the government takes E.T. away. Elliot feels helpless as he slowly sees E.T. begin to die. However, miraculously he is revived again and Elliot with his brother and friends make a break with E.T. When it looks as if they will be caught their bikes take off allowing the peaceful extraterrestrial to escape and head home.

5509132,4,B00AT6NUN4,"Let me just say that E.T. is one of my favorite movies from my childhood.  I owned it on VHS, I went to the theater to see it when it was released in 2002.  I got it on DVD with the original release and the 2002 version.  Let me just say I really enjoyed the extra stuff they added in 2002.  When E.T. was running in the woods they used C.G.I. to make him look like he was really running with those long arms and short stubby feet.  It made it look more realistic.  Because when that was filmed it it was just an E.T. figure on a track, so i just looks like he's running perfectly straight, no movement.  I'm not usually a big fan of C.G.I. but what little was used in the revamped version I really enjoyed it.

To get to the point of my review.  The 2002 release is not an option on the blu-ray.  It's just the original 1982 release.  For the 30th Anniversary, you would think they'd go above and beyond, and pack it with more bonus features and whatnot.  My daughter really enjoyed the bathroom deleted scene that is actually right in the movie in the 2002 release.

In this Anniversary Edition, not only did he put back the guns, but also kept some of the enhanced scenes from the previously issued Special Edition. HE GOT IT RIGHT folks!

Lets's get to the blu ray, Universal really knocked it out of the ball park with their anniversary blu rays in 2012 this keeps that trend going, the transfer is stunning it looks like it could have been made last year (a 30 year old film) The special features are great some of them new and some carried over from previous releases.

They must have spent weeks on each and every frame of the original print/negative.

The movie, of course, is incredible. I grew up loving E.T., and it's wonderful to see my children loving him, too. The CGI E.T. made me irate, transforming a realistic looking E.T. into a goofy cartoon, so I was extremely happy that they released the 30'th anniversary addition in the original form. The bathtub scene was an adorable idea, but definitely not worth the cost of buying a ruined movie rather than a timeless classic. The bathtub scene can still be viewed in the ""extras"" section of this set.

I remember being freaked out by certain scenes in the movie mostly because the video quality was so blurry that I couldn't really tell what I was looking at and my perception was all distorted (i.e. the ""hearts"" inside of their chests was confusing because I couldn't see the detail of the translucent skin and it just looked like a hole in their chest that magically disappeared. Also, when E.T. is ""spoiler alert"" zipped up in the bag his face was all distorted and it just looked creepy weird disturbing). Watching it in HD (HDX via an ultra-violet compatible media player) was AMAZING. I'm not sure I'll be able to describe how great the quality is. It looks better than some movies made today.

My husband was in the Navy and overseas at the time.  Going to see ET was inexpensive for myself and 2 very active, easily bored little boys.  They loved ET.  The couple hours in the theatre was the only time during the day they would be quiet and sit still.  I have sinced introduced ET to my grandchildren and they love it too.

This blu-ray version was off the chart there are no words to describe how beautiful and remarkable the picture and audio was.  They remastered it in 1080p and I gotta say it was most impressive seeing every spec of detail and the colors were so vibrant.  Also when they redid some of the scenes of the movie you could tell it was ran through a computer instead of a puppet they used CGI made ET look very real.,1352851200,,502,4.05050505050505

5509225,4,B00AT6NUN4,"ET could be Steven Spielbergs crowning achievment. A perfect film from start to finish. Fantastic combination of acting, special effects, comedy, tear jerker all wrapped up in one. I first saw it on it's initial release and always loved it. Now on it's 30th anniversary, Universal and Mr. Spielberg have fully restored the original 1982 version. The film was rereleased in 2002 with altered effects, which were later dismissed by the director himself as simply wrong. The guns by the agents were replaced with walkie talkies, and some footage was also altered. Now the original version has been fully restored and remastered for optimal HD video and sound quality. Wisely the reissue version has not been included here. As far as the sound and picture are concerned, you will never see ET look better than this. The video is just a tad soft in a few spots, but for the most part, the video hits the mark. Abloutely no blemishes or artifacts are noticeable, beautiful color and detail, just the right amount of grain, a beautiful video to behold. I can't picture it looking any better than this. However, because of some slight softness, it gets a 4 our 5 stars. The 7.1 surround sound audio however is absolutely perfect. All 7 channels are used subtly but effectively. John Williams score sounds clear and full, a nice amount of surround effects, clear dialogue. Perfect. A 5 out of 5 there. The package includes a couple of brand new features, plus a good amount of older extras carried over from the previous Dvd version. The steelbook is a limited edition, and it carries the blu-ray, plus a regular dvd of the movie. This is a must for movie lovers, and a beautiful addition to any blu-ray collection. Once again, not 100% perfect, but very close. I highly recommend this blu-ray.",1352160000,,1785,4.7799352750809065
5509226,5,B00AT6NUN4,We wanted our grandchildren to see this movie and I had been waiting for Amazon to offer it.  I pre-ordered and it's a hit.  I think it's a classic.

5509228,5,B00AT6NUN4,"Steven Spielberg is rolling out his classic blockbusters on Blu-ray finally and I can't help but think to myself, ""What's the point in reviewing these things?"" Will anything I say positive or negative keep someone from making their own decision to purchase these in the newest high-definition format? Who doesn't want ""Jaws,"" the Indiana Jones films, or the latest upgrade in the legendary director's collection, ""E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial"" in the best possible version they can get it?

I hate to keep asking hypothetical questions, but do we really need a synopsis for this movie? A group of aliens leave behind a member of their landing party. The short creature finds his way to the suburbs of California, where a little boy takes him in and names him ""E.T."" The alien soon becomes sick and must contact his home planet to be rescued before he dies.

The high-definition transfer is beautiful and obviously a step above any past release of the movie. The picture is cleaner and clearer, however it still doesn't look as good as the ""Jaws"" transfer we received earlier this year. I know I said the same thing about the Indiana Jones Blu-ray versions, but it's just the way it is. It's still provides the ultimate viewing experience for those who love this emotionally heartwarming and visually stunning 1982 masterpiece.

A 7.1 surround sound mix enhances the visual experience of seeing this film in high-definition. The spectacular score by John Williams, the dialogue, and the sound effects all blend together seamlessly. It's an upgrade you can tell Steven Spielberg toiled over to get just right.

All new bonus features are included in this Blu-ray edition. ""Steven Spielberg & 'E.T.'"" has the director reflecting on the making of the film and the effect it had on his career. ""The 'E.T.' Journals"" takes viewers behind the scenes with original footage from the set of the movie. There's also deleted scenes, ""The 'E.T.' Reunion,"" featurettes, designs, photographs, and marketing materials. A digital copy of the movie is included as well.

The ""E.T.: The Extra Terrestrial"" Blu-ray is packed full of great bonus material and an impressive digitally remastered feature taken directly from high resolution 35mm film elements. It's a must-own for any science fiction or Steven Spielberg fan. Those who haven't seen the movie in a long time will be overwhelmed with how exquisite it looks and sounds in high-definition.",1351728000,,2427,5.072681704260652
5509229,5,B00AT6NUN4,"I've always loved E.T. and watching it now on blu-ray is wonderful.  The clarity is amazing, and shows what can be done when the studios and film makers take their time and do it right. An unexpected bonus I discovered when redeeming the Ultraviolet digital copy is that a second digital copy through Amazon was also included!

5509230,5,B00AT6NUN4,"I think everyone born after 1970 knows (and loves) this movie, so i want to talk about the blu-ray release. I'm a firm believer that Success should be discussed as much as Failure. With so many posts about what companys do wrong with what's left out of blu rays/DVDs and the Ultra-violet plague (i'm guilty of this as well), i just want to thank Universal for actually putting the customer first. I was always going to buy E.T. on blu ray because it's one of those movies that just demands HD viewing, but i had pretty muched resigned to double dipping and buying the HD version on iTunes as well. Imagine the pleasant surprise when i downloaded the INCLUDED digital copy and realized it WAS both HD and SD!!. Also included were the iTunes extras that Apple loves to use as bait to get us to buy a movie twice. Then if that wasn't enough, Universal has the foresight to actually give us both iTunes AND the young upstart Ultra-Violet copy (which i have NO love for but sincerely appreciate the inclusion). I think when you pay $20+ for a movie, it's nice to actually feel you got your money's worth.
.
So far, Universal and HBO are the only studios (that i know of) that are providing HD digital copies when you buy an HD copy of the movie via blu-ray (it actually makes perfect sense). So, to the blu-ray division of Universal Studios...THANK YOU very much for actually going the extra mile and providing a customer valued product. Other studios should take a long hard look at your business model. Nothing favors the bottom line like customer loyalty. And you've got mine.",1351036800,,1574,4.545774647887324

5509232,5,B00AT6NUN4,"E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial(1982) is a seminal 1980's classic. It grossed over half a billion dollars worldwide. It was remade in Turkey as Badi and remade in Spain as Pod People. Starman(1984) and Mac and Me(1988) were made in a similar vein. E.T. has been spoofed countless times. E.T. was also released in the same year as John Carpenter's remake of the sci-fi/horror film
The Thing(1982). There was also E.T. for the Atari 2600, the video game flop that caused the Video Game Crash of 1983!
In E.T., Elliot(Henry Thomas) gives food, shelter, and warmth to an alien botanist after his people leave him behind on Earth by accident. A young Drew Barrymore plays Elliot's sister. Robert MacNaughton plays Elliot's older brother. Dee Wallace plays Elliot's mother. Peter Coyote plays a government agent simply known as ""Keys"". Carlo Rambaldi designed the E.T. animatronic puppet. John Williams' epic, tender, upbeat music score for E.T. is a classic.
 E.T. was re-released in 2002 with new CGI footage of E.T. The word ""terrorist"" was censored as were the guns in the FBI agents' hands. E.T. is similar to Spielberg's 1977 film Close Encounters of the Third Kind. E.T. also has references to Star Wars(1977) and The Empire Strikes Back(1980). Spielberg produced Poltergeist(1982) while he was busy directing E.T.
Melissa Mathison wrote the script for E.T. E.T. is solid on a technical and artistic level. It's one of Spielberg's best.",1350950400,,1432,5.093617021276596

I'm thrilled that it's now on Blu-ray and that the guns that were taken out and replaced with walkie talkies are back restoring it to the version I saw, with a few digital additions.

5509234,5,B00AT6NUN4,"It looks like the finest 35mm print of E.T. you've ever seen, with Allen Daviau's cinematography of images straight from Steven Spielberg's imagination and heart lush and crystal-clear.

John Williams' out-of-this-world music is astronomically, extraordinarily spectacular!

On the sound track, there is the occasional added sound-effect...a cricket here, a bird chirp there, the pizza guy (Get it?  Huh?) driving off down the street exactly in surround left after delivery, the sound of the gas-guzzling government van's engine running when we're inside with Keys, who is listening to Elliott and Michael discuss ""What WOULD make a radar?"" for E.T. to phone home...subtle touches that add just a little more atmosphere to completely immerse you in the story we've grown to know and love!

Watching this classic cinematic gem brought me right back to 1982, to a time when my family (I'm the oldest of 3, formerly 4, siblings; my younger brother, sadly, died of cancer in 2007) was intact and together...when my brother and I used to ride BMX bikes, like the boys in the film...and when our sisters were little, like Gertie.  Pure delight.  Pure Spielberg!

Thanks a million, Steven, for going back to the 1982 version...the print that shows the government guys carrying GUNS (yes, government agents carry guns, and, pray tell, perish the thought, sometimes have to use them; they would certainly be brandishing firearms during something so monumentally earth-shattering and such a potential threat to national security as a visit from an extra-terrestrial!), that shows E.T. in all his superbly-operated anamatronic rubber puppet glory, for allowing us to hear Mom telling Michael ""You are not going (for Halloween) as a TERRORIST!"" comment, and Michael saying, uncensored, in his shoulder pads, at the fridge, ""...nothin' but hell-shIt!""",1350518400,9,1838,5.339100346020762

This film is even better than my memories of it as a child and the remastering done really couldn't be better. If it weren't for the dated electronics and vehicles in the film you could easily mistake this for a film shot with the latest tech. I'm not a huge user or fan of most films bonus features but the bonus features on E.T. are a fantastic addition that should not be overlooked.

I hoped the new scenes and digital enhancements would make me love the movie even more. But, the 20th Anniversary edition was kind of a let down for me... too many ""creative"" changes that seemingly took away from an already awesome movie.

The new anniversary release is what I wanted 10 years ago; new packaging, same great movie. It's finally here and I'm thrilled! This is the movie we fell in love with. It changed childhood for many of us. It changed theatrical releases forever. Some movies are better with digital enhancements - E.T. doesn't need that superficial crap.",1350432000,2,722,4.68503937007874
5509237,5,B00AT6NUN4,"Thanks, Universal, for this release

...I am also a big fan of this movie-

-I remember being a kid who just finished 5th grade and started Summer vacation, and going to see this movie with my family, and how excited the whole audience was to be watching the film...We really don't see this kind of excitement and fun in movie theatres now the way we used to.

To me, this movie was really what made the 80's a great time to be a kid at the movies, as the innocence and what I call ""Spielbergian sense of wonder"" that Spielberg created with this movie had a big influence on many of the other Sci-Fi and kid's films that followed it (The Last Starfighter, Explorers, Goonies, Flight of the Navigator, etc). Spielberg himself said that he really feels ""ET"" as a film encapsulated what he really set out to do as a filmmaker.

Like many others, I am also glad that all of the early 80's ""practical/in camera"" special effects were left in this blu ray release...

Example- E.T. running to his spaceship in the beginning of the film while the government scientsts are in pursuit.

This original ""special effect"" was a VERY simple setup of a red light on a small pole put on a dolly track and quickly pulled with a cable...SIMPLE- but it worked perfectly... In my opinion, there was no need to show a ""galloping"" E.T. in full CGI...the simplicity of that little red light sort of summarizes how simple creative filmmaking effects can add a lot of heart and sense of wonder.

Glad to see this classic movie on Blu Ray and looking forward to watching it",1350345600,2,1546,4.480427046263345
5509238,5,B00AT6NUN4,"This is the first thing I want to say about the 2012 Blu-ray Release of ""E.T., the Extraterrestrial:"" it's back, in its original form. Yes, every frame, the terrorist gag, guns back where they need to be, the musical score in the farewell scene restored to its original grandeur, and no digital shilly-shallying. What a delight! Big thanks to Mr. Spielberg for finally recognizing the deliciously imperfect perfection of his original creation.

I've seen this film approaching 70 times, and I know where the beats are, top to bottom. I was looking for changes, and could detect not a one. Even the slight jump-cut as ET indicates the closet as ""home"" is restored. The original ILM animation of the bikes in flight is back. The string passage during the final embrace is right where it should always have been. All the terrible tampers have been removed.

The transfer, from original 35mm elements, is as flawless as can be. The look and feel of the theatre experience fills the eye and the ear and, as always, the heart. Welcome ""home,"" E.T., and thanks, Universal, for a job well undone.",1350172800,179,1088,4.781914893617022

It was very difficult to validate beforehand, but these BluRay and DVD Anniversary discs appear to have the entire original theatrical release movie and all related dialog.  No more ""erasing"" of guns in favor of walkie talkies, and wiping of certain dialog.  Even the DVD is much better done, better resolution and colors, than the previous ""chopped"" widescreen DVD release.  A nice transfer to BluRay, and highly recommended if you like the story.",1350172800,8,468,5.038961038961039
5509240,5,B00AT6NUN4,"Man, Spielberg does a good job remastering his movies. It's beautiful, with DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 surround track. Spielberg has listened to his fans and has returned the guns instead of walkie talkies, and E.T. no longer looks like a blob as it did 10 years ago. The extras are pretty much the same with the addition of two new ones--Spielberg reflecting on the movie's success and how it impacted his life, and 60 minutes of on set footage going into the filmmaking progress. The feature with on set footage is fantastic for those of us obsessed with filmmaking. Watching Spielberg direct the kids is super interesting.

5509246,5,B00AT6NUN4,"The Jaws Blu-ray was pretty good, but E.T. is just about as well done as you could hope for!  It actually looks like film for a change with beautiful, natural looking grain and no apparent DNR scrubbing or overt contrast pumping.  The detail and color are outstanding, considering the 80's film stock that was used.

And YES it is *only* the 1982 theatrical version... including the bad government agents wielding guns around innocent kids, the terrorist line left intact, and most importantly... NO CGI'd E.T. at all.  Your childhood memories remain safely intact.

Hurray!  Now if only Lucas could see the light.

The 7.1 re-mix, encoded in 24 bit DTS-MA lossless audio, isn't too shabby either.  It pays homage to the original sound design while spreading the sound effects and John Williams' epic score around the room better.

Unfortunately, Universal continues to skimp on the deluxe treatment.  If they had placed the video extras on a separate Blu-ray (which they should have done on Jaws as well), they could have included the complete making-of documentaries, rather than edited versions.  There is also a wealth of extras from previous video versions, like the special edition laserdisc, not included here.

I also highly recommend the 5.1 channel Super Audio-CD of the superb E.T. score by John Williams released for its 2002 anniversary.",1349654400,27,1350,5.086363636363636

If my brother was still with us I'm sure he'd want to get himself a Blu-Ray copy this year. I've watched it countless times on VHS & then DVD. This movie represents a time that I miss too...when life wasn't as rushed as it is today. It's a funny, scary, sad, intelligent, honest, perfect family film. I loved watching E.T. with my own children and we started watching it every Halloween or Christmas Eve. I will always have a copy of E.T. in my home...in any version.",1349568000,3,639,4.423728813559322
5509248,5,B00AT6NUN4,"E.T.: The Extra Terrestrial is an instant classic. It is one of Steven Spielberg's best movies. An adventure about a young boy named Elliot and his new alien friend E.T. trying to get E.T. back to his planet. It is a heartwarming journey full of memorable scenes and incredible lighting and photography. This quirky family classic is a favorite of mine and is a part of my childhood.  E.T. had some of the most amazing music I have ever seen in film. Turn On Your Heartlight by Neil Diamond is the main theme of this movie, and a good one at that. The storyline and character development was extremely well done. By the end of the film you had an emotional attachment to the majority of the characters. The scene where Elliot and E.T. are riding bikes and then suddenly start to float into the air over a silhouette of the moon is fantastic photography at it's finest. Overall, I give the movie 5 out of 5 stars. I find this movie suitable for all ages. Check this flick out in its 30th Anniversary Edition with loads of extras.

5509249,5,B00AT6NUN4,"I still remember seeing this movie for the first time when I was young, and completely falling in love with the characters and of course E.T. This was a skillfully done Blu-ray/DVD pack that has so many extras. For a true fan of the movie, you will love all of the bonus features that will bring you behind the scenes and let you see how they really made this movie come alive. It is hard not to be enamored with this movie, as it has a bit of everything from humor, to adventure to drama, really something for all. For me I loved the deleted scenes and the behind the scenes, making of the movie bonus features, as I always learn so much more about the movie but also about what was going through the minds of the creators when I watch these.

5509251,5,B00AT6NUN4,"The old clich that you cannot go home again happily doesn't apply to Steven Spielberg's E.T., the 1982 classic that hits Blu-Ray for the first time on October 9th. Right off the bat I can say that the film's HD transfer is beautiful, boasting clear detail, no overt use of DNR, and no color scheme ""retweaking"" that I could detect.

The last time I had seen the film theatrically was in 2002 for its 20th Anniversary re-release -- the ninth time I had seen the movie in theaters, but the first viewing I had on the big screen since E.T. first opened in 1982. At that point, I was not quite eight years old, and my lifelong love for the movies was about to take hold during that magical summer of genre favorites.

Watching the film again, as an adult, in 2002 was fascinating - not just because of how well the movie holds up, but in how it captivates children as well as adults, who can watch the film from a different perspective and yet be every bit as moved and spellbound by the story as kids are. I was finally able to see what critics had described in 1982, about how Speilberg's movie works for grown-ups in profound yet subtle ways. Whereas kids primarily identify with Elliott's plight to help E.T. get home, on this viewing I carefully studied the reaction of the other characters in the film, and was in awe of how Spielberg carefully painted every character's nuance in seemingly small background detail so effectively. Specifically, I was moved by how Elliott's older brother (an underrated performance by Robert McNaughton) aids his younger brother and gains his uncompromising trust, and how Peter Coyote's initially-villainous, ultimately sympathetic ""Man With The Keys"" is essentially Elliott as a grown-up, understanding his emotions and wanting to help the abandoned alien but not knowing how.

The movie is told with beautiful economy -- each scene creates and sustains an emotion integral to the characters, or serves to propel the story forward. The sequences with Elliott showing E.T. his room, his Star Wars figures, are so genuine, feel so real, that you forget you are watching a sci-fi fantasy that tugs on your heartstrings. It's the kind of movie that cynics love to bash because it makes them feel emotional, but E.T.'s cinematic virtues are plentiful. The movie is anything but saccharine emotion. It makes you care about Elliott and his family because Spielberg and writer Melissa Mathison make them seem like real people. There aren't any moments early in the film that don't feel like real life, and this timeless quality makes one get past the occasional '80s staple like an Atari 2600 camping out on the top of the family TV.

We all know and love the film's operatic ending, but there are scenes throughout E.T. that are subtle and yet every bit as sublime. This is illustrated perfectly in the sequence in which E.T. watches the mother (Dee Wallace) read ""Peter Pan"" to Gertie (Drew Barrymore), with the creature almost as interested in studying their interaction as he is in Elliott's plan to help him return to the mothership. Henry Thomas' performance is still the greatest juvenile performance I've ever seen, and the sequence in which Elliott says goodbye to E.T. -- whom he believes to be dead -- is as moving as any moment in the entire film.

Making all of it work, of course, is John Williams' music, still arguably his finest score for not only its outstanding lyricism, but its unforgettable, symbiotic relationship with the movie itself. From the quiet, poignant cues underscoring Elliott and E.T.'s scenes together - to the glorious finale that says every word in musical terms that Spielberg happily didn't feel the need to spell out with dialogue - Williams' music is E.T. It's another character in the film, punctuating every emotion in a fashion that's as restrained at times as it is powerful at others.

It's a marvelous, wonderful film and its Blu-Ray release, coming up early next month, adds to its legacy.

Universal's 1080p AVC encoded transfer of E.T. (in its 1982 original release version) is crisply detailed without any obvious noise or DNR filtering; overall, the presentation is sterling, enhancing Allen Daviau's cinematography in a transfer that does justice to the film's '82 theatrical cut. The DTS MA audio is effectively rendered as well, boasting a broad stage for Williams' masterful score.

For extra features, the disc adds one new interview with Spielberg and more of John Toll's behind the scenes footage, as well as recycles other extras from the 2002 DVD releases. This unfortunately means that, once again, Laurent Bouzereau's unedited 1990s laserdisc documentary hasn't been included (just a cut-down version is on hand), and it's a strange, notable omission since it contained the only full release of Harrison Ford's deleted appearance as Elliott's school principal - as well as the film's excised ending coda. That those particular scenes have never been screened again outside of that documentary sadly remains a mystery (just a few shots of the Ford scene are included in the ""Evolution & Creation of E.T."" documentary, with Spielberg talking over them).

Here's a specific breakdown of what is included:

-Steven Spielberg & E.T. (12 mins., HD): A new conversation with Spielberg on the production of the film, its genesis, the essential component of Melissa Mathison's involvement, and a nice anecdote involving his screening of the film to President Reagan at the White House.

-The E.T. Journals (53 mins., SD): This release's other noteworthy new extra is a longer assembly of behind the scenes footage from the production of the picture, much of it shot by future ""Braveheart"" Oscar winner John Toll. Some of this was included (in various forms) on prior releases, but there's more of it here, presented uncut and without new ""talking head"" commentary, thanks to Laurent Bouzereau.

-Deleted scenes (3 mins., HD): Two deleted scenes, added to the 20th Anniversary re-release, are presented here in HD. Neither is essential to the film and the CGI does seem out of place given the rest of the picture (though it's subdued and well executed), but the brief Halloween bit sets the scene nicely. None of the digitally ""reworked"" scenes involving the government agents' guns are included - although Spielberg said 10 years ago he wanted the guns removed, apparently he's had a change of heart and prefers to let his original version speak for itself.

-A Look Back (37 mins., SD): Retrospective doc compiled for the 2002 home video release, which is essentially a cut-down version of Laurent Bouzereau's '90s laserdisc documentary (which ran more than twice as long).

-The Evolution and Creation of E.T. (50 mins., SD): Previously available in the three-disc, more expensive 2002 DVD box-set release, this recounts the production in a lengthier manner than ""A Look Back.""

-The E.T. Reunion (17 mins., SD): The cast reunites with Spielberg in this 17-minute piece from the 2002 DVD package.

-The Music of E.T.: A Conversation with John Williams (10 mins., SD): Williams interview from the 2002, three-disc DVD box-set.

-The 20th Anniversary Premiere (18 mins., SD): Another previously-released featurette showing John Williams conducting the L.A. Philharmonic at the Shrine Auditorium for the movie's special 20th Anniversary screening. (Note the prior DVD had an isolated audio track of this performance that ran during the film, which is not included here).

-Designs, Photographs and Marketing: A series of previously released still galleries

-Trailer (SD): The full 2-minute theatrical trailer (offering some unused footage of E.T.'s ship landing) in non-anamorphic standard def.
