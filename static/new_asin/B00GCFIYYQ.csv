8622166,4,B00GCFIYYQ,"This British B-movie from the late '50s is a lurid story that is very well acted.  The hero is the expatriate actor Eddie Constantine of Godard film fame, playing a taxi driver swindled into a quickie marriage to a young French girl for her green card, so that she can begin call girl work for mobster Herbert Lom (Pink Panther).  Sexy Diana Dors has a good role as one of the hookers whose sister was scarred by Lom and has a score to settle.  Brief cameos by Michael Caine and author Jackie Collins.  Good jazz score and clear sound for an old B&W film.",1466467200,3,555,4.3076923076923075
