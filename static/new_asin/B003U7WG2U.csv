4194642,4,B003U7WG2U,"This vdeo educas-te me very much about how to ride and understand a bike, now my F800GS look like more simple and controlabilidade, the only concern about the video, Is that the video is not a Professional quality video, and this make it a little boring.",1421193600,,254,4.543478260869565
4194643,5,B003U7WG2U,Great product. Exactly what is expected.,1416614400,,40,5.833333333333333
4194644,5,B003U7WG2U,"I bought both to make sure things they teach on disc 1 isn't prerequisite for disc 2. It isn't.

While 1 does have some good stuff, disc 2 is light years better in communicating what you MUST know to turn a motorcycle with skill.

Disc 1 has a really goofy narrative and it almost seemed they wanted to make a comedy rather than an instructional video.

Disc 2 also has a narrative but that takes a back seat to the tsunami of super solid turning knowledge and instruction.

Disc 2 has made me a better and safer rider.",1397347200,7,519,4.26530612244898
4194645,5,B003U7WG2U,If you haven't seen or heard of these videos by now and you're thinking about riding; don't. Find em...watch em. Watch em again & again.,1376352000,,136,4.48
4194646,5,B003U7WG2U,Love the second of the two DVDs. It's funny and full of useful information. I notice a big improvement in my techniques after watching these DVDs.,1363737600,,146,4.653846153846154
4194647,5,B003U7WG2U,"I recommend buying these two DVDs, because I bought the first one back in 2001 and it helped me a lot and when I found out that Keith Code, had made a second more up to date DVD, I had to have it. I have let other riders borrow my older one, so it isn't in that good of shape. These two will stay in my collection and only the older video will be shared outside my house. Lol
Ride safe!!",1360195200,,387,3.7901234567901234
4194648,4,B003U7WG2U,The 2nd DVD is really god and helpful for me preparing for my first track day.  The first one is pretty old and the production quality is not so good but still has some good information.  For sure these helped me be a better and safer rider.  Will watch them many times to pick up new things.,1357257600,,292,4.087719298245614
4194649,5,B003U7WG2U,"I had seen parts of the twist of the wrist videos before, but watching them start to finish is really awesome. It doesn't matter how many times you watch them, there's always something more to learn.",1341878400,,199,4.555555555555555
8405697,5,B003U7WG2U,Great material to have in your motorcycle collection.,1528588800,,53,5.75
8405698,3,B003U7WG2U,"Not exactly a high production quality video. I have been riding a long time, but no real desire to ride on a track. Recently, got talked into going on a week+ plus back roads bike trip in Italy. I was the only one in the group that hadn't been to the California Superbike School. I couldn't keep up with them. Signed up for the course just to improve my road riding. I found Volume one somewhat of a philosophical approach to riding and not sure that it has any practical value. Volume 2 is more practical although not sure I learned anything from it. I don't claim to be a great rider, but perhaps a new rider might get more from it.",1524268800,,634,4.204918032786885
8405699,5,B003U7WG2U,"Loved this ""ancient"" bit of tips to keep you safe on a two-wheeler. Entertaining and helpful. I learned a lot even though I've been riding for four decades.",1504742400,,156,4.607142857142857

8405704,5,B003U7WG2U,Excellent videos. Perfect.,1485475200,,26,8.0
8405705,4,B003U7WG2U,"very nice read and videos, but I am sure would be much better to go to the school. though a ""little' more expensive....
the DVDs actually give some tips but is mostly dedicated to promote the school which you could access investing a good 10 grands ?",1469059200,,250,4.340425531914893
8405706,3,B003U7WG2U,"DVD 1 is useless. It offers generic and vague advice without concrete actions or items to work on. Like: ""know your limits""... or: ""have a plan""... albeit without listing anything tangible that you can address.

DVD 2 is very valuable. The opposite.
It offers items send concrete things ""to do"" and how to do them. For example it lists 7 specific limits to look out for and how to address them. It describes how s plan should be conceived, what are the objectives and how to structure the plan to achieve them.
However, having owned the book too I must stress and add that the video is way less detailed and complete and, I'm comparison to the book, the video feels more like entertainment while the book feels like a lesson or even a full riding course.

I think the best is to buy only DVD 2 and the book twist if the wrist II.

Hope it helps!",1467244800,10,845,4.3354430379746836
