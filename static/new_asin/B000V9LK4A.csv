2934045,5,B000V9LK4A,"I have to admit that I have a sibling in the tech field, so I find the characters very endearing, but this show is so hilarious.  I imagine some people would find it dry or not gritty enough, but if you are looking for comedy that finds humor in silly little things and good physical comedy, this is it.  It probably does help to find the IT genre easy to mock even though it deserves much respect.  The chemistry of the actors and the timing of the jokes are very funny.  Give it a couple of episodes if it does not get you right away, it is so worth it!",1253059200,,555,4.0181818181818185
2934046,5,B000V9LK4A,"A friend told me about this TV show and she had nothing but great things to say about it.  I approached it with skepticism, believing that it couldn't live up to that hype.  But it did!  This is a cleverly written and humorously acted program.  It is quite refreshing and fun.  If you work with technology, you can certainly understand many of the jokes in here.  The only downfall is that each season is only 6 episodes long.  I am left wanting more!",1252800000,,451,4.36144578313253
2934047,5,B000V9LK4A,Each episode is funnier than the last. I can't wait for season 3. Pity there's so few episodes.,1252800000,,95,4.333333333333333
2934048,5,B000V9LK4A,"The first season of the Britcom geekfest ""The IT Crowd"" was absolutely brilliant, technonerdy, and gutsplittingly funny. Guess what: the second season is actually better than the first -- it introduces a new insane boss to make life difficult for the IT department, and has them grappling with the difficulties of dinner parties, funerals, gay musicals (""It's a gay musical called 'Gay'... that's very gay"") and assorted other problems.

Jen is annoyed when a possible date with the attractive Philip is turned into a ""work outing"" to a musical, and further annoyed when Roy pronounces Philip to be gay. Except the musical turns out to be a gay extravaganza, and Philip is well-acquainted with every gay person associated with it. In the meantime, Roy and Moss's efforts to find a bathroom without an attendant lead to a disastrous pair of mistaken identities.

Then when Denholm (or Reynholm, I'm not quite sure) walks out a high window, the IT department is threatened with doom at his disastrous funeral, and Roy becomes convinced that he's about to die. Then Roy becomes obsessed with watching a Korean zombie movie (with a twist!), while Moss's efforts to see new people (""We're stagnating, Roy! You're my wife!"") have him signing up for a cookery course... except it's not really a course, but a personal ad run by a German cannibal.

Then when Jen has a dinner party for her friends and her new boyfriend's friends, she ends up having to invite Roy, Moss and Richmond... and her friends turn out to be a twittering nervous flake, a mummified model, and a drunken randy divorcee. Hijinks ensue. And when Jen complains about her bad bras, Moss creates the ultimate  bra (which he calls the ""Abracadabra"") and plans to patent it... but as Jen finds out during a vital meeting, there are downsides to this bra! Finally, the new boss Dougkas makes Jen his new P.A., despite her reluctance to leave her nerdy friends -- but of course it's all a big clumsy attempt at seduction. With naked pictures and suggestive commercials.

Living bras, dead flies, really mean anti-piracy ads, German cannibals (""He WANTED to EAT YOU!""), the ultimate cell phone vibrate setting, handicapped bathrooms, gay musicals and a guy with the unfortunate name of ""Peter File"" (say it fast and out loud). ""The IT Crowd: The Complete Second Season"" piles the increasingly bizarre sitcom problems on our already overburdened, underappreciated IT personnel, and it actually is funnier than the season that came before it.

Part of this is from the brilliant writing, which is riddled with surreal situations (Moss's bra bursts into flames... on Jen's body) and weird dialogue (""If two grown men can't make a pervert happy for a few minutes in order to watch a film about zombies, then maybe we should pack up and move to Iran!""). And while the IT department's social awkwardness is still the main theme, their problems have become even stranger with time (Jen finds that the smoker's area looks a lot like a downtrodden Communist country, complete with Eastern European accents).

The three main actors are still utterly brilliant --  Katherine Parkinson's Jen struggles to avoid Douglas' ridiculously blatant come-ons, and falls prey to an old addiction; Richard Ayoade's twitchy Moss remains socially inept and jerky, but turns out to have some brilliant scientific skills; and Chris O'Dowd's Roy remains a bored slob who ends in over his head more than once. And Noel Fielding has some fun with mellow goth Richmond, who finds an unlikely girlfriend, contemplates evil omens (""I trod on a piece of Lego""), and turns out to have Spiderman-like powers.

And Matt Berry joins the cast as the very dramatic Douglas Denholm (""SPEAK, PRIEST!""), whose main goal seems to be to have sex with Jen. He's as crazy and out-of-touch as his dad, but way more lecherous.

More potent in its surreal comedy and awkward hilarity, ""The IT Crowd: The Complete Second Season"" is an absolute must-see for comedy fans.",1252454400,13,3974,4.953453453453453
2934049,5,B000V9LK4A,"This season continues the awesome tradition of THE IT CROWD. If you have never heard of THE IT CROWD, then you owe it to yourself to indulge! I was introduced, and HOOKED!

Even after REPEATED views, I still laugh my butt off at the crazy antics of those 3! What a blast!

Laughing is good for the soul, and THE IT CROWD has the right stuff..... watch it today!

Brilliant... Simply Brilliant.......",1249776000,,449,4.717948717948718
2934050,5,B000V9LK4A,"The laughs continue in Season 2 of The IT Crowd, which spends most of its time putting the show's three central characters -- Roy, Moss and Jen -- into outrageous situations and pushing those situations to hilarious, politically incorrect extremes. The first episode of the season sets the stage as Roy and Moss join Jen and her allegedly straight date to a performance of ""Gay - The Gay Musical.""  Midway through the show, Roy makes the mistake of using the handicapped person's toilet.  As with every episode, the situation plays out in a brisk, satisfactorily resolved 23 or so minutes.  Episode two sees the suicide of corporate malfeasant Denholm Reynholm and the introduction of his son Douglas (played by Matt Berry) as the new head of the company whose lecherous ways introduce an ongoing theme of workplace harassment.  (The switch is a good one, shaking up the dynamic of a show before Denholm's manic corporate energy started to wear out its welcome on viewers.) Those easily offended should be warned that this series also finds humor in cannibalism, exploding bras and date rape drugs. But if you're looking for laughs, you'll find plenty of them in The IT Crowd, a geek-character-based show that only gets stronger in version 2.0.",1246665600,7,1244,4.937799043062201
2934051,5,B000V9LK4A,"This is one of the best shows I have ever seen!  I caught part of season 1 online when it first came out, and I was busting out laughing through the whole episode!  I was hooked from that point on.
Being in IT myself, I guess I can relate to it in a way.  ""Have you tried turning it off and on again?"".  Well, that's pretty much the first thing I ask when there's a problem!
I do wish the seasons of this were longer than a handful of episodes, but I guess they do things a little different overseas.  I guess they shoot for quality, not quantity. :)",1246060800,8,550,4.009174311926605
2934052,5,B000V9LK4A,"I came across this show on IFC after watching another movie on that channel and being too lazy to turn just thought I would take a peek then turn if it wasn't interesting. Like the other reviewer, within minutes I was laughing so hard my neighbors came up to my unit asking what in the world was so funny as they could hear me through the ceiling. It was the episode where they were doing the geek calendar! The thing about british humor is that you eiter get it or you don't. I haven't laughed this hard since Ab Fab. I can't wait for my copy of season one arrives. I feel myself laughing already.",1245715200,18,598,4.208695652173913
2934053,5,B000V9LK4A,"I caught an episode of this show one weekend on IFC not too long ago.  I saw an ad for it shortly before it was on, and thought, ""looks kind of lame""  but I was lazy, and left it on.  Within the first couple of minutes, I was laughing harder than I have at a sitcom in a long time, it was the episode where Roy tries to fit in with some ""manly"" men at a pub, and ends up their getaway driver on a robbery.  I searched around online, to see if I could find more eps, and was pleasantly surprised to see it was offered on Amazon.  Having seen the first series, I'm just shocked that the writers were able to cram as much hilarity into each episode as they do.  Then as I looked into it, I discovered it was created by the guy who wrote Father Ted.  That explains it all!  :)

Can't wait for series 2 to be released.",1245196800,9,813,3.908536585365854

2934085,5,B000V9LK4A,"The absolute worst thing I can say about The IT Crowd is that the season lasts only six episodes.  IT dweebs Roy (Chris O'Dowd), Moss (Richard Ayoade) and hapless boss Jen (Katherine Parkinson) are all denizens of the lower levels of Reynholm Industries.

The great thing about this program is it seldom requires more than one or two other people other than the original three to flash out any episode.  With few exceptions, most stories take place in their office.  Another exceptional shift from the norm adds Richmond (Noel Fielding), a full fledge Goth man who lives/works behind the green door.

IT Crowd is a hoot.  Anyone who enjoys British humour will certainly appreciate this gem of a programme.",1422230400,,705,4.882352941176471

And it's one of those shows where you don't have some bad episodes - every one is funny. It's just that some episodes are *extremely* funny, while other episodes are *lethally* funny. There's usually at lest one moment in every episode that is potentially life threatening in the depth of laughter that will ensue.

It's bitter-sweet though - because just as you're getting very comfortable binge-watching the series, you realize that there are only 4 seasons and one additional episode and that is truly a shame.",1418688000,,631,4.842592592592593

I work in IT, and this is especially funny to those of us who live this life.  My entire office is now quoting this show on a daily basis.",1361750400,,288,3.864406779661017
2934125,5,B000V9LK4A,I love this series!! So awesome! Very funny and a real find. I was thrilled to find this DVD! It is a perfect nerdy marathon!,1360195200,,125,4.04
2934126,5,B000V9LK4A,"If you've already seen the first season of The IT Crowd you'll love the second season. Personally I think the second season is the best. Every episode is really funny, but some people who don't care for British or tech/geek humor may not like it. The menu system of the DVD is also really cool. It looks like the old pc game Lemmings. It just adds to the whole geeky feeling of the show. I recommend checking this show out!",1359072000,,423,4.3
2934127,5,B000V9LK4A,The actors are great their all funny in their on ways . you'll recognize Chris O'Dowd from bridesmaids. The only set back is that in British series is only six episode.,1357862400,,168,4.451612903225806

2934130,5,B000V9LK4A,One of the  best shows I have watched in ages and after watching all seasons online I couldn't help myself but buy the actual dvds so I can watch over and over again. Huzzah!,1356825600,,174,4.117647058823529
2934131,5,B000V9LK4A,Awesomely funny series with hilarious episodes. Highly recommended for all to watch. British humor is so much fun to watch.,1356220800,,123,5.2
2934132,5,B000V9LK4A,My sister and her husband recommended the IT Crowd--and season two starts off with one of the most hilarious shows I've seen. I was laughing so hard and so loud that I couldn't see for the tears in my eyes or hear because of how loud I was laughing. I highly recommend this series if you like quirky characters and well written stories.,1355097600,,336,4.349206349206349
2934133,5,B000V9LK4A,"I hate to pick a favorite season because The IT Crowd is just so great, but I think this season is the best. The first two episodes alone make it all worth it.",1352678400,,159,3.8484848484848486
2934136,5,B000V9LK4A,I love this show!! This is quality British comedy! I just need them to make more seasons than four. I need closure. Plus I miss my Mossy poo :p,1350000000,,143,3.9655172413793105
2934137,5,B000V9LK4A,One of my favorite episodes! A couple of buddies and i wanted to watch this episode so i bought it up and watched right then,1346284800,,124,4.0
2934138,5,B000V9LK4A,"I love this show. This is a must see comedy. The actors are incredibly talented and they have great chemistry. Brilliant writing. All episodes are funny, but the two that made me laugh so hard were ""The Work Outing"" and ""Return of the Golden Child."" I'm still laughing about these episodes.",1339372800,,290,4.705882352941177
2934139,5,B000V9LK4A,Delivery of the video was fast and it arrived in perfect condition. I could not wait to get the second season as I had purchased the first season and it was absolutely hilarious! Season 2 did not disappoint! This is the best show ever created!!!,1338595200,,245,4.466666666666667
2934140,5,B000V9LK4A,Hilarious show & a must-see for anyone in a tech field. The characters and the stories are absolutely brilliant. Highly recommended.,1335744000,,132,5.333333333333333
2934141,5,B000V9LK4A,The IT Crowd is better than the Brit-Coms that get shown on local PBS stations.  It is too bad there is such a small number of episodes.,1335052800,,136,4.037037037037037
2934142,5,B000V9LK4A,"How can you not LOVE Moss, Roy, and Jen?  They are down-to-earth every day people just like the rest of us.  I appreciate British comedies for their subtle witty humor - more like the old I Love Lucy - rather than stupid in-your-face stuff like Jack Black or Jim Carey's Pet Detective.  I laughed out loud the whole time - you will, too! :-)",1323475200,,341,4.296875
2934143,5,B000V9LK4A,"I don't understand the people that don't find this funny.  Apparently, they don't have a sense of humor, or they are the IT guys.  This is very different than American humor.  There isn't a constant soundtrack playing over the top of everything.  The humor isn't always drinking or sex related.  There aren't really any story lines that follow from episode to episode making it so you're glued to your ""tellie"" every week.

The characters are exactly what you'd expect to find in an IT department: odd.  One is a complete nerd who is ""too cool"" for everyone while the other would probably be labeled autistic.  They play off of each other fantastically.  They are managed by a woman who knows absolutely nothing about computers, but pretended to so she could get the job.  They are visited from time to time by the company recluse that is housed in a back room of their department.  His job is never really explained, he's just there.  Finally, the company is owned by a person who knows nothing about running a business, yet manages to keep things afloat.

If you like British comedy, like to laugh and understand the humor of computer nerds, this series is for you!",1309392000,,1167,4.661764705882353
2934144,5,B000V9LK4A,"Heavy on the nerd culture references, but still really funny if you don't get the inside jokes.  The cast is brilliant, their timing is dead on, and everyone's is so likeable!!!  If you like Big Bang Theory you should really check this out, I highly recommend it.",1300924800,,263,4.574468085106383

2934146,5,B000V9LK4A,"A non-techy freind of mine made me watch this show on netflix. After the first episode I was laughing non-stop. I totally loved the humor, writing, acting, and just every little component of it. I do think it's very realistic to what IT people have to endure in non-IT environment. I have often told people myself have you tried to turning it on many-a-times! It's kind of sad that a sitcom made a joke out of it.  Love the show and highly recommend it to anyone.",1299542400,,463,4.383720930232558
2934147,4,B000V9LK4A,"If you are considering purchasing the second season of the IT Crowd...Then chances are you have seen the first season.  The second season is funny with some classic moments. It is not the best of the 4 seasons, but the addition of Noel Fielding's Richmond character in several episodes is always a welcome sight.  I highly recommend this series to anyone that can appreciate geek chic.",1298937600,,385,4.818181818181818
2934148,5,B000V9LK4A,"As the wife of a ""standard nerd,"" my husband and I really appreciate the humor of IT crowd.  My husband's office looks just like the basement full of vintage computers and nerdy posters.  This would be a funny show in it's own right, but for the techies and those who love them this really tickles the funny bone.",1296518400,,313,4.379310344827586
2934149,2,B000V9LK4A,"there i've said it. if this is a five star show then father ted must be a billion star show. you can see the jokes coming from so far away you'll think your eyes have been replaced by telescopes in the middle of the night. agree with the guy who said the theme tune was good though. what else, what else, oh yes: Chris Morris, what where you thinking? this must have been a personal favour to someone connected with the show. the end.",1295827200,,434,4.178571428571429

2934151,5,B000V9LK4A,"I am usually not a fan of British humor, but this show is FUNNY!  The episode I fell to the ground in hysteria was the one where they go to a gay play.  I literally laughed out loud.  If you want a true belly laugh, rent or buy this.",1283817600,,233,3.7142857142857144

We have been showing to our friends and family and all of them are not necessarily IT people, but they are all laughing over it.  Great entertainment with a  price you cannot beat!",1275350400,,253,4.1020408163265305
2934154,5,B000V9LK4A,Our daughter introduced us to the IT Crowd.  We had never heard of it but watched a few episodes at her house.  We were hooked so we bought a set of them.  We always laugh ourselves silly when we watch the videos.  I love all the characters but especially Moss.  He is so literal thinking and I think that sets up the sketches.  I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys laughter.,1271203200,,387,4.232876712328767
2934155,5,B000V9LK4A,This series is so addictive.  We had to be very disciplined to keep ourselves from watching all the episodes at once.  The writing and the cast are superb.  Such clever story lines!!!!  Fantastic direction.  I wish more of our friends were watching this series so they would understand our new catch phrases!!  Have to start hosting IT parties.,1267574400,,344,4.844827586206897

2934157,5,B000V9LK4A,"Once they added the crazy son as the new boss, this show became even funnier, ""FATHER!""  The plots are insane (in a good way), and this and the third season had a stream of more developed and sophisticated plotting and loop backs to initial themes.  My favorites, the German Cannibal, the Dinner Party, When Jen is the new P.A., the Charity Calendar, and when Roy is involved unknowingly in the implementation of a crime. This is a great show and I want Season 4 already.",1264809600,,471,4.529411764705882
2934158,5,B000V9LK4A,"The IT Crowd is one of those comedy's that you can keep watching over and over again it is so hilarious. If you like the Office you'll love this show.

2934160,4,B000V9LK4A,"From the very first episode of this season to the last, they really hit their comedic stride. I thought this season was more developed and funnier than the first. I like that Noel Fielding was featured a bit more and that we got to see the characters out side of the work place and of course hilarity ensues.",1260921600,,308,4.327586206896552
2934161,5,B000V9LK4A,"I was told about this show by a friend who's opinion I generally agree with when it comes to TV/Movies.  I checked out the 2nd season from my public library.  The Gay Musical episode is so funny that my wife and I had to watch it twice the same night.  (and no the Gay Musical episode is not pro-gay or anti-gay, it's just a launching pad for humor)  I have since purchased the second season.  The first season is really good, the third season started really slow, but the last two episodes are great (loved: friendface)
My only complain is that there are only 6 episodes per season.  Give me more!",1259366400,4,598,4.342342342342342
2934162,5,B000V9LK4A,"Season 2 of the IT Crowd continues the witty insanity of Roy, Moss and Jen (and the Goth guy living in the server room).  The first episode is perhaps the family favorite:  Roy gets caught using the handicapped bathroom and plays ""disabled"" for the rest of the episode.  Whenever any of our ""crowd"" does something odd, they just roll their eyes and say ""I'm disabled"" and it's a funny running joke.  Just for those who have not seen this, there is no disrespect at all to handicapped people; it's Roy's personality that's ""disabled"".  This is ensemble comedy at its best.  Each person's quirks come out in new and surprising ways; the episodes all seem fresh and not rehashed at all.  You just have to leave all sanity at the door and come along for the ride.  There is just enough real world situations and context to set off the antics and each key cast member is a master of comedic timing, facial expressions and vocal expression.  Highly enjoyable!",1254787200,3,953,4.625
2934163,5,B000V9LK4A,"IT Crowd is likely the best show ever made. It is seriously very funny. Only 6 episodes per season, but they're all gems, so it's worth it. Really, it's brilliant stuff.",1254614400,,169,4.483870967741935

The only letdown was the special feature about the taping of the show--it kept messing up!!!  grrrr

There are some excellent episodes in Season 2.  Gay the gay musical is a HOOT! Those boys are such trouble.  So inept.

The dinner party one kills me too! HAR HAR HAR :)",1253232000,4,449,4.337349397590361
