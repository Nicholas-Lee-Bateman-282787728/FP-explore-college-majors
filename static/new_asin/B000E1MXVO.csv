2480207,1,B000E1MXVO,"Full House is the corniest sitcom on earth. The people in the show say the corniest lines and then the studio audience is laughing like crazy. Sometimes they just laugh for something thats hardly even funny. The show a donkey moving his mouth and the audience is laughing like Mr. Bean made the funniest joke. But actually, if you have money to spend then get this horrible sitcom and laugh at what a sad attempt to be funny this ""Full House"" show makes. Also, I counted several times that ion 30 seconds, the audience laughs at least 3 times. That a minimum of 1 laugh every 10 seconds! Usually its 5 laughs every 30 seconds. Thats one laugh every 6 seconds!",1140825600,8,659,4.454545454545454

2480211,5,B000E1MXVO,"This is the season where one of the greatest sitcoms of all time really took off. All the characters are clearly established now. Becky (Lori Laughlin) appears in the opening credits for the first time and remains there for all the remaining seasons. Becky and Danny (Bob Sagat) are firmly entrenched as hosts of ""Wake up San Fransico"". Jesse and Joey (John Stamos and Dave Coulier) are still in the adevertising buisness and doing well. Donna Jo (Candence Cameron), Stephanie (Jody Sweetin) and Michelle (Mary Kate and Ashley Oslen) are just as funny and cute as ever. This is the first season where Michelle is old enough to have a real role, and she excels at it. We also see more of Kimmie (Andrea Barber) DJ's best friend who is basically bad news for everyone. It is my belief that with this season coming out there is a good chance all 8 seasons will be out soon. I truly hope so.

I was the same age as DJ and went through some of the same things she did.  It's a shame there aren't more family shows like this on tv now.

She's a witch!) and John Stamos (as usual) just oozes all that sexiness. I would...Anyway, back the review.

If you don't remind me I'll always trail off into a world of bittersweet dreams filled with awesomely-charming Men such as John Stamos! b^_^;;

I actually like DJ (Deej) and I saw a decent episode just today; her and her painfully-attractive boyfriend were having relationship troubles (although I think it was ALL in her pretty little mind): He was going off to college to leave her fending on her own with only a few calls and visits every couple of months. Trust me when I say I totally appreciate and bought her pain; I would feel the same if I had a life partner (or a boyfriend) who decided he wanted to go out-of-state (or wherever it was he wanted to go to attend schooling) and leave me lonely. I'd be a flipping mess!

I don't think thing did work out in the end. He goes off and she just has to bite her lip and deal. The twins were cute but terrible, terrible actors. No one was outstanding although the adults in particular were decent David Coulier, funny.

2480509,5,B000E1MXVO,"Season 3 of hit sit-com Full House continues the fun and laughs as the family continues to grow.

This season, D.J. (Candace Cameron) enters Jr. High.  Naturally, the adjustment is hard not only on her, but Stephanie (Jodie Sweetin), who still wants to hang with her old sister, and Danny, Jesse, and Joey, who don't want to let her grow up.

Uncle Jesse (John Stamos) seems to have plenty of trouble with his girlfriend Becky (Lori Loughlin).  They seem to fight as often as they get along.  My favorite of these is ""Breaking up is Hard to Do (in 22 minutes)"" which finds the couple trying to work through their various hobbies.

In other developments this season, Michelle (Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen) turn three and start pre-school, Danny (Bob Saget) takes the entire family to Hawaii, Stephanie backs Joey's car into the kitchen, and Joey (Dave Coulier) makes one more desperate bid to become a famous stand-up comic.

While Jesse and Joey are still working in advertising, that seems to be an side note and is only the focus of one or two episodes this season.  We also suffer the first signs of tainted timelines when Doris Roberts shows up to play Danny's mom and Becky and Jesse celebrate the one year anniversary of the day they met around Christmas (in an episode that aired in January originally.)

Those quibbles aside, the jokes are still great and the cast still does a great job acting.

This season does contain the first episode I truly didn't care for.  ""Our Very First Telethon"" is basically a talent show for the cast with no real plot.  That's one episode I won't watch much in the future.

This set contains 24 episodes on four discs.  The only extra is a montage of Joey's impersonations over the course of the season.  Frankly, it's funny, but not worth watching more then once.

While I would love some real extras, the show itself is still very funny.  This is certainly worth owning for Full House fans.",1170720000,5,1931,4.648967551622419

2480517,5,B000E1MXVO,"I'm a 23 year old Microbiology grad student, but I am not ashamed to say how much I love this show! Aside from a lot of nostalgia for my youth, I think it's great on its own merits. People say it's corny - and it is - but so what! I'd rather watch something corny but actually emphasizing positive values and the importance of family (something that is very important to me especially now that I've moved to another state for school) than the crap we have on TV now that glorifies cheap sex and sends terrible messages to kids - especially girls - about their worth.

My 10 year old sister loves this show too and we like to watch it together...and it makes me feel good that not EVERYTHING she watches is full of terrible messages (I have a bone to pick with the music she listens to but that's another issue)...

Maybe it is a little over the top, but I don't think there is anything wrong with showing the way a family CAN operate if they choose to - with love, respect, acceptance, loyalty and discipline that comes from the heart, not some arbitrary power trip - and also that family isn't neccesarily who you are related to, or a traditional family.  I think people that say it's unrealistic are just trying to justify the dysfunction they are steeped in.  No family is perfect, obviously (my own family, close as they are, certainly had its issues!) and this is an idealized portrayal - but that doesn't mean we can't always be striving for something better.

This is also one of my favorite seasons becaues the kids start to grow up and diverge and go through the struggles that I think a lot of kids (and even adults on some level) can relate to.

So whether you're a nostalgic twenty something, a kid, or an adult looking for something to enjoy with your whole family, I think the Full House DVDs are a great choice.

I do think the special features on this particular one sucked though.",1151798400,9,1897,4.402857142857143

My daughter believes it's the way the family works together to solve problems that makes the show a success. In fact, she often tells me that she learns a lot from the mistakes the girls make.

2480531,3,B000E1MXVO,"Don't get me wrong I love Full House- it was the only show as a kid that I would drop whatever I was doing at the time to watch- the show in itself is one of those rare US sitcoms that will go on forever and in history. The country in the 80s and early 90s would come to  a hault to watch the Tanner family enjoy life's ups and downs.

The best part of the multiple personalities of the youngsters and the comic antics of stand in dads Joe & Jesse. As well as neat freak Danny who was the ""true father"" figure type in that he always wanted a neat house and was more reserved than stand in dads Joey & Jesse. The best part was we saw the kindness emerge between Jesse & Joey and their relationships/ themselves grow as people through their interactions with the kids.

With many memorable moments in the series from Joey & Jesse changing Michelle's diaper for the first time to the time Stephanie drives a car into the kitchen it's hard not to enjoy this series. It's heartwarming and endearing because we all want our family's to be like- filled with love and understanding that problems are viewed as minor or unimportant... and are considered so small they can be solved with a simple talk and hug.

This season however is not the best- it is okay- but, no real meaningful or memorable episodes. The kids are cute (as always) but as endearing as future & past seasons. All in all this is a great series but, this is simply just not the best.

Let us HOPE when the 4th season is released on DVD there will be some extras worth watching or listening to.",1144454400,8,540,4.257425742574258
2480537,5,B000E1MXVO,"Ok first, I want to say that Full House is a very underrated sitcom and definitely deserves a lot more credit than people are giving it. People keep saying that Full House is corny and very uncool. Well, you know what I say to that? I'm 27 years old and I would give anything to have grown up in a family like the Tanners versus the families of sitcoms today!! You know why? Because the Tanners have good morals and are there for everyone in the family the way families are supposed to be.

You watch sitcoms of today and it's always about sex, drugs, just stuff that's making children of today not respect their parents and doing abusive things. Full House is a very family friendly sitcom like The Brady Bunch, The Cosby Show, Growing Pains, and many other shows from the 80's and even 70's.

I can't understand how shows like Friends already has it's 10th season on DVD but a great quality show like Full House, which was on long before Friends, only has it's 3rd season released. I'm sorry but I hate Friends, every episode is the same. Full House is just so funny, and unique. I love how when you watch Full House, you get to see The Beach Boys, Disney World, Hawaii, and many other cool things. I love how they feature children in this show unlike many sitcoms of today. That's one thing I've noticed in sitcoms of today. Friends, Everybody Loves Raymond (once a week doesn't count), and some others don't really have children in them. Shows like Full House and The Cosby Show has both adults and children are all shown in every episode. For some reason nowadays, it's all about the adults. What happened to the children? And what happened to shows like Full House and The Cosby Show that had parents teaching their children lessons in life?

It's a shame that the only way I can see quality sitcoms today, I have to watch my DVD's. I encourage everyone to buy the Full House series on DVD because one day, because of the decline in society, you may never be able to see even the re-runs of this quality show on TV!",1144195200,33,2021,4.412868632707775
2480548,5,B000E1MXVO,I pesonaly think Full House is the best show ever. All seasens including this one are great. I would rate all seasens with 5 stars!,1143936000,12,131,4.28
2480549,1,B000E1MXVO,"There is nothing that can be said about this show to reveal how awful it is. This show represents the beginning of a new era in television that falls into the ""unwatchable"" category. Full House is Small Wonder without the robot maid.",1143849600,6,233,4.571428571428571
2480550,4,B000E1MXVO,"To this day, I still watch Full House.  The show lasted eight seasons.  It is still quality family entertainment, with reruns still in syndication TEN YEARS after the show was cancelled.  That says a lot about what the show meant to a lot of people.  I was 9 when the show first aired, and 17 when it was cancelled.  I am almost 29 and still love watching the reruns!  As the show ended in 1995, it was still in the Top 30 on the Nielsen ratings scale.  Say what you want about Full House.  Everyone has a right to their opinion.  However, in this day and age where sex, crude humor, and vulgarity are common place, it is nice to know I can put on Full House and know my children will be taught good morals mixed with a little humor.  I hope to own all eight seasons of this corny show.  Long live Full House!!!!!",1143504000,25,813,4.147435897435898
2480551,5,B000E1MXVO,"I am 26 year old, and I grew up watching Full House.  To this day, it remains my favorite show, even though I've seen every episode a zillion times, to the point of knowing the lines to every episode.  I guess I might be bias to the show, since I grew up with it, but I think no other show came close to Full House.  I'm extremely glad the 3rd season is coming out, and I can't wait until I own all 8 season on DVD.  Full House is by far the best show ever.",1142726400,21,457,3.778947368421053
2480552,5,B000E1MXVO,"IF FULL HOUSE WOULD'VE BEEN A CORNY SHOW IT WOULD'VE GOT CANCELLED INMEDIATELY,& IT DIDN'T!! IT LAST TILL 1994 OR SO RELEASING MORE THAN 4 SEASONS OR SO,I DON'T HAVE A GOOD MEMORY OF HOW MANY SEASONS WERE AIRED,BUT IT GOT FARTHER THAN ANY REALLY CORNY SHOW.

THE POINT OF THE SERIES WAS 3 GUYS LIVING IN ONE HOUSE, 2 OF THEM HELPING A WORKING WIDOWED DAD TO RAISE HIS 3 CHILDREN,SOMETHING LIKE ""3 MEN & A LITTLE BABY"".

WERE THEY GAY CAUSE THEY WERE SHARING THE SAME ROOF? NO!!!

WAS THERE ANY SCENE WHERE THEY SHOWED THAT THEY WERE GAY,NO!!,NEITHER IN FULL HOUSE.

SO WHY INVOLVE SOME HOMOPHOBIA COMMENTS IN A NONE VULGAR SHOW? WHAT'S THE POINT IN BRINGING A SUBJECT LIKE THAT FULL OF IGNORANCE & PREJUDICE TO A SHOW WHERE NOT EVEN AN EPISODE DISCUSSED SOMETHING LIKE THAT OR CLOSE TO IT?

THE FACT THAT PEOPLE THINK IS CORNY IS BECAUSE IS A FAMILY,INNOCENT & CLEAN ENTERTAINMENT! & HONESTLY,SHOWS LIKE THIS ONE NEEDS TO BE SEEN MORE OFTEN CAUSE WHO KNOWS IN THIS WORLD IS THERE REALLY A FULL HOUSE IN YOUR NEIGHBOR & DON'T WANT TO ADMIT THAT THERE REALLY IS!! TV SHOWS THESE DAYS ARE VERY ROTTEN & VULGAR & POSITIVE MESSAGES ARE VERY NEEDED.

LIKE I SAID,FULL HOUSE IT'S A VERY ""CLEAN"" NONE VULGAR ENTERTAINMENT FOR THOSE WHO LOVES WATCHING A NICE SHOW LIKE FULL HOUSE. & ANYBODY WHO LOVES THE SHOW WILL AGREE WITH ME.

HAVE A NICE DAY!",1142640000,11,1338,4.414634146341464
2480553,5,B000E1MXVO,"so people, does anyone who wrote a negative review allude to the fact that this show began in the LATE 80s- EARLY 90s? First of all, everything that was on tv, in the movies and written in songs during this time was completely corny! I think some people forget the age that this was written in and realize it was appropriate for then, and basically everyone who buys this is reminiscing on the fact that they used to watch and they once enjoyed it. There is NOTHING wrong with that! Fake laughter has been used for centuries, and if you can't appreciate the corniness go watch a modern tv sitcom and stay away from full house it never did anything to you.

ok thats all.",1142380800,12,670,4.36
