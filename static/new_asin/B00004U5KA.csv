8653622,1,B00004U5KA,"This is bargain-bin anime that's gone through every process as cheaply as possible. A poorly produced 80's-era anime, entirely out of place in American culture (not that I pretend it was a shining perfect example of the East as well), that would've been hilariously awful if it had worked.

As such, the VHS transfer is literally so poor the tape runs out before the movie. I hope this is merely a physical fault in my copy, but I'm not about to spend more than another dollar to try and find out. I'll soon try and hunt down some of the other episodes to find out.

Otherwise, well... it's definitely in the level of ""so bad it's good."" Entire scenes made up of three scenes, totally six to eight frames of animation, shamefully mirrored to give the illusion of more action. Absolutely stock characters, caricatured over American translations. Ripoffs of every giant robot or fast-car style anime of the time. One of the three pilots of the robo formers, (a set of three flying vehicles who can become one of three different giant robots, depending on which car-and-pilot are ""on top,"" as it were) is a fat coward I believe was named Tip, who--unlike his well-dressed compatriots--chose to fly into battle with an umpire's pad and mask. The others, a standard hero and a standard ninja-like Falco-esque cool guy, round out our heroes.

But the villains... you may have noticed on the cover that there appears to be a hitler with giant horns.

This character's name is Fuhrer.

So much time is spent shouting out plot points that one doesn't get to spend enough time with Horny Hitler here, but between the King of the Underworld (of which Fuhrer is a demon, however that works, Japan) that I wish there was more to enjoy in its rank awfulness. I recommend this to a a party of enthusiasts, somewhere between a screening of Monster a GoGo and a reading of The Eye of Argon.",1325808000,2,1873,4.629518072289157
