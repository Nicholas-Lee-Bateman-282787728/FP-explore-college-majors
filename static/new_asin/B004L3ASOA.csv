8433776,4,B004L3ASOA,"I have found the Miami Piano festival recordings to be somewhat variable at times - lighting consistency being a main problem. The settings can be very dark and this is probably to do with the very basic setting.

Not in this case however as the pianist and the piano are well-lit throughout.

This is a very satisfying recital with a nice variety of music ranging from Bach/Busoni through Mendelssohn, Chopin, Debussy, Schumann, Elgar and one of Onay's teachers, Saygun. All of this matches the disc's sleeve descrition as illustrating `energy, lyricism, delicacy, charm and virtuosity' etc. The main attraction lies in the quality of the recital as a whole rather than providing first choices of each individual item and as such will give considerable pleasure. I shall look forward to further playings on that basis.

The recording was made in 2008 but is only presented in 4:3 ratio and stereo, cut at quite a low level. The sound does not approach that of the stereo releases in the Roque d'Antheron series from 2002 and should surely have been presented in 5.1 for a better spread. The 4:3 image is a disappointment as well and a widescreen format should be the default presentation these days. Musically it is easily worth the 4 stars however.",1342656000,,1250,4.859154929577465
8433777,5,B004L3ASOA,"A friend asked me to attend a recital by Gulsin Olay (whom I had never heard of), a Turkish female pianist who had been highly recommended by knowledgeable acquaintances in Paris.  I agreed.  And meritorious of all recommendations did Gulsin Onay proved to be.  As luck would have it, the recital we attended is the one recorded in this splendid VAI dvd.  Since Amazon does not furnish it (they hardly ever do), here is a listing of the contents:

R. Schumann: Abegg Variations Op. 1
F. Mendelssohn: Variations Serieuses, Op. 54
F. Chopin: Variation Brillantes, Op. 12
  Ballade #3
C. Debussy: Images Livre II:
  Cloches a travers de feuilles
  et la lune descent sur le temple qui fut (such a delicious title!)
  Poissons d'or
E. Elgar: Smyrna
Adnan Saygun: Sonatine Op. 15
Encores:
Bach-Busoni: Chorale Prelude in G Major, BWV734
Chopin: Nocturne Op. 48, #2 in f# minor
Saygun: Preludes Op. 45, #4 and #12

The pianist chose a varied program with relatively short individual pieces which showed her virtuosity over a wide spectrum of the repertoire from the early romantic era to our day.  She chose well.  All pieces were beautifully executed, most musically indeed brilliantly.  It was a pleasure to hear the Chopin Variation Brillantes, Op12, certainly not major Chopin but not worthy of the neglect which afflicts it.  Together with the Ballade it shows Ms. Onay as having the flair and temperament for engaging Chopin playing.  Edward Elgar's Smyrna proved an interesting and lovely find.  I don't know if this piece was ever popular.  I had never heard it and Ms. Onay lavished noticeable tenderness in its execution. But to me the jewels of the program were the Debussy.  Ms. Onay made every tone convey musical emotion, moving beyond color for the sake of color to a more musical expression of Debussy.  I wish to hear her in more Debussy.  Ahmed Adnan Saygun (1907-1991)is as close to a modern Turkish national composer as one can find.  The eclecticism in his Sonatine and the Preludes reflects the century in which he lived (except Darmstadt) with some nationalistic inflections.  It seems to speak to Ms. Onay who gave it obvious care and sensitivity in execution, bringing out the angularities with virtuosic precision.  It is certainly listeanable music and full of opportunities for a pianist to display technique and coloristic ability.  In general, it eluded me.  Of the encores a standout was the Bach-Busoni Chorale Prelude..... indeed, Bach on acid.
The piano sound on this VAI dvd is superb, as indeed is the quality of the image.",1328659200,,2553,4.913348946135831
