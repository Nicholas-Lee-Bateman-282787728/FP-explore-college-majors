4987155,5,B006GL8NII,"We have owned horses for years, we are avid trail riders and attend many clinic's & expo's,
if it involves horses, we're there. We felt that this was a excellent series with much to teach.
The host did a perfect job of guiding the viewer through the different type of horse activity &
training steps. Anyone that likes horses would find much to be interested in watching these
episodes. I'd give it 10 stars if it was possible. Hard to find good clean, interesting entertain-
ment to watch with your family, this fills the bill.",1408924800,5,528,4.568421052631579
4987156,5,B006GL8NII,I found this series on Amazon and had not seen it before when it aired on TV. The season one and two version is loaded with nearly every type of horse imaginable from the wild ones to those bred and trained for specific tasks with a very well narrated description of each that does not dominate the program but rather enhances. It is Canadian with most filmed in the Alberta area and contains beautiful scenery besides the gorgeous horses!,1399939200,4,439,4.569620253164557
4987157,5,B006GL8NII,Great information movie alot about horses to teach and understand its nice to learn about horses of the past and present,1392336000,,120,4.761904761904762
4987158,2,B006GL8NII,"This DVD promises a wide variety of areas of horsemanship, and they are there, but the production values are low-budget, the host --while clearly a bona fide rodeo hero--doesn't seem to know much about other disciplines and areas of horsemanship, and is a poor interviewer with superficial, bland interviews.  I have no doubt that the experts in hunt, cutting, racing etc really are experts, but they do not have much to say, the content is not even remotely deep or informative...There are lots of beautiful horses in many different venues--this is more a horsey greeting card than a DVD.  Cheap in all ways--but only if all you want is pretty images.",1391731200,2,652,4.864864864864865
4987159,5,B006GL8NII,"This DVD set came within a few days. It is amazing. It goes into detail on all equine disciplines. I cannot believe the price
and the length of the DVD set. A true value.",1390780800,2,170,4.029411764705882
4987160,3,B006GL8NII,"It was more than a little repetitive, and focused mostly on Western/Rodeo disciplines.  I would have liked a little more attention to the show horse .",1354924800,2,150,4.769230769230769

8497669,4,B006GL8NII,"This is really a must-see for horse-lovers. Lots of information, but I think too much stress was put on certain areas. I realize that it was a Canadian undertaking, but it could have been improved by incorporating some American aspects of the horse.",1437609600,,249,4.813953488372093
8497670,4,B006GL8NII,"Great overview of a number of horse breeds and the jobs they do and loved the shows, but loses a star because the quality of the video is pretty much like watching VHS tapes - and that is a shame because there is a lot of pretty scenery.",1435017600,,237,3.9583333333333335
