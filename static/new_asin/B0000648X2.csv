1706338,5,B0000648X2,"This is a must-see film for everyone.  Jan Sverak (Academy Award winner for ""Kolya"") again shows his skills and excellence - no wonder he is called ""smaller budget Spielberg"".  But don't be mistaken, this is byfar the most expensive movie project done in this country EVER.
Dark Blue World is a movie about Czechoslovak fighter pilots in World War 2, who escaped to Britain to continue their fight against Hitler, after German army has occupied their country.  It is a story of war, friendship, love, and the cruelty of fortune, wonderfully entwined to produce a fantastic film.  The film is a great drama, yet contains a lot of Sverak's humanity and humor at the same time...
Among other things Dark Blue World is arguably the best World War 2 aviation movie I've seen - the aircraft are beautiful, historical background well-researched, and most of all air combat scenes are thrilling but very realistic (modern computer graphics possibilities finally allow these things to be done, and this movie avoided all of the ""comic book"" effects that todays' directors often get dragged into - see Pearl Harobr).  What is really good though is that you can take your girlfriend or wife with you, and she will enjoy herself as well!
Finally few important things to mention:
For all its seeming similarity to Pearl Harbor, this is a much, much better movie.
Considering that roughly one third of dialogues in this movie are in English, it isn't really a typical ""strange foreign subtitled movie"", either...
And finally DVD features many excellent extras, including an excellent ""The Filming Of"" documentary, storyboards, edited scenes, documentary about special effects, and others - lots of goodies.
Be it whether you liked Pearl Harbor or were disappointed by it, this is a film you should see.
Do get this DVD, you won't regret it...  or even better, go see it in a movie theatre before you buy it, while you can!",1019260800,26,1908,4.891640866873065

Now I am stuck with is DVD unless I want to pay shipping to return it for a DVD refund that would not even cover the cost of shipping. Buyers need to be aware of this Region 1 and Region 2 situation.

1706380,4,B0000648X2,"The British actors, and the parts of the film that are in English, are a sweetener for what is actually a superbly made Czech film with excellent production values (particularly the flying scenes).  The romantic triangle isn't really explored that much, it's just there to provide an only-girl-in-the-picture role for Tara Fitzgerald (there's a lovely Czech girl too, but she's only at the beginning and end, and her part is one-dimensional) and complicate the bromance between two extremely winning male Czech actors.  It's a very bittersweet film, but a believable and humane one, and it really is like being there, whether ""there"" is prewar Czechoslovakia, wartime Britain, the dangerous skies during the Battle of Britain, or a bleak prison which provides the frame for the hero's flashbacks.  It's a frustrating film ultimately, because it records a stunning injustice it's too late to do anything about (other than make a movie about it), but it's GOOD frustration.  When you believe in characters enough to want to do something personally for their happiness, or to save their lives (and you do), a movie is working.",1381708800,3,1123,5.120218579234972

1706385,5,B0000648X2,"Upon reading of the movie being aired in two different languages with sub-titles I shied away from the movie. I'm really not much into sub-titles but of course being a self-proclaimed aviation history buff especially dealing with Spitfire A/C I decided to buy a used copy through Amazon.com for $17.98 delivered. I thought for that price if nothing else I'll get some nice A/C scenes , etc. Being a Pilot, I too am a stickler for authenticity, being an ex-member of a present day War-bird Association & other A/C organizations. THIS DVD MOVIE WAS A VERY PLEASANT SURPRISE !  Even my wife enjoyed it & believe me she shy's away from A/C movies as one of the main topics where-ever we visit is usually A/C as Pilots tend to talk about one subject in my circle of pilot friends but once we got into the movie with the love triangle building the wife was hooked, even hoping that the two characters in love with the same woman would safely return. And "" NO "" in our view it wasn't quite the same as the love triangle in the DVD Pearl Harbor. This is also one of the few movies that portray the way it really happened during that time frame of WW2 in the Royal Air Force. It's a movie with lots of surprises as well as tears: "" VERY,VERY,REALISTIC "" !
Great action scenes, you're there in that Spitfire giving as well as receiving ! And also the sad truth of a country being taken over by communist rule treating their war heroes as slaves with no recognition for helping to defeat Nazi Germany.  A splendid & moving movie but it just might be a "" HISTORY LESSON "" as well !  5-STARS !",1340064000,3,1580,4.349152542372881

1706387,5,B0000648X2,"I really love this film. I watched it at the cinema and bought it when it came out on DVD. The lack of Hollywood action scenes makes it all the better. Simply put, this is tale of a group of Czechs who fled to the UK to fight with the RAF. The aerial combat scenes are few, which in my eyes gives them more impact, and there are no mega aces as depicted in some other similar films. In the UK the role of the Czechs, Poles, ANZAC and of course the Canadians is well understood which perhaps made this film more meaningful for me. The only thing I could have done without was the love triangle, but I did not dislike this enough to lower the rating.",1319760000,,648,4.0703125

1706389,5,B0000648X2,"We heard of this film and then had to wait quite awhile to find it available, but it was and is definitely worth the wait.  This is a wonderfully made story about an area of WWII with which I was previously unaware.  It is beautifully written and acted and while it deals with a sad and difficult time, it still manages to celebrate the human spirit.

1706390,5,B0000648X2,"This is one of the best War Movies in later days and shines where others have failed. It goes a long way to show that a big budget does not always produce the best results. A good story is always better.

In the main it is a story of Czech airmen, once driven out of their home they end up flying for the RAF. It has plenty of human interest and is well told on many levels, there is humor to be found and great sadness. There is also a love story and a triangle but this time it is very well done. It is like watching how horribly Pearl Harbor failed.

The Spitfires are wonderful to watch and there is great attention to detail, like falling cartridges from the planes.

I recommend it on every level.",1276819200,2,703,4.116788321167883
1706391,4,B0000648X2,"There's a compelling story here, that hasn't been told before, of the Czech pilots who fled Czechoslovakia to join the RAF at the beginning of WW II.  A collection of warm and convincing performances by the leads show the bond between men during war time, intercut with aerial scenes which are surprisingly and convincingly authentic.. these are real planes up there, and one of the films key strengths is it's feeling of how tangible these planes are, both on and off the ground.  This is done by some clever photography, but also by re-using some of the skirmishes shot for `Battle of Britain' back in 1969... seamlessly done so you'd never know it.  The end result is you don't have that aftertaste that computer generated flying scenes leave you with of watching a photo realistic cartoon where the physics is not.. quite.. right.  Indeed, when real planes are used as they are here, they feel like one of the characters of the movie, so evocative they are of the time.  They genuinely feel you can reach out and touch them, and when you hear them, you just know it is real, not some sound engineer's creation.
On the other hand, the bond between men has been illustrated with a somewhat hackneyed story line- two men fall for the same lady during war time, and this aspect, though sweet enough with characters we care about, feels like an overused plot device.  Tara Fitzgerald is the weakest of the main leads, let down by a script which fails in this key romantic thread of the story to feel organic and real, contrasted by the way it succeeds so well in the rest of the movie at illustrating  the experience of Czech pilots in the RAF in an authentic and uncontrived way.  The themes of the movie and sensitivity of the direction mean this is by no means a fatal flaw, merely a quibble in an otherwise satisfying and well balanced movie.
The main story in this central part is contrasted by scenes from 5 years after the war, in a Czech labour camp.  To the unititated this is certainly the most surprising part of the story, how the heroes of the Battle of Britain returned to Czechoslovakia as outcasts and jailed out of fear they could rouse the same fervour against the Soviet regime that they did against the Nazis.  One feels there is almost a whole other movie that could have been made out of these few scenes which leave the fate of the main character hanging.  Indeed, the contrast of the ending to the warm camaraderie of wartime is refreshingly un-Hollywood, but an integral part of telling the experience of these brave men.
So it's not an absolutely perfect concoction, with a rather trite romantic thread framing an altogether more interesting and relatively untold story of the Second World War.  Stunning cinematography and a clutch of memorable performances should win you over however and bump this up to 4 stars.  Don't be put off by the Czech language - indeed, much of the movie is in English anyway.  This does not mean this is your typical Euro-picture smorgasboard, but rather it is a coherently  presented vision superior in many ways to much larger budgeted wartime movies of the last couple of decades.  The tangible reality of the Spitfires and the dewy morning `Scramble!'s are worth it alone.",1273795200,,3231,4.671957671957672
1706392,4,B0000648X2,If you don't mind subtitles you will enjoy this movie. Way  better than Pearl Harbour. The story lines are similar but this one has a better storyline and acting.

1706393,2,B0000648X2,"DARK BLUE WORLD
[Tmavomodr Svet]

(Czech Republic/UK/Germany/Denmark/Italy - 2001)

Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Hawk Scope)
Theatrical soundtrack: Dolby Digital Surround EX

1939: Two Czech fighter pilots (Ondrej Vetch and Krystof Hdek) flee the Nazi occupation of their homeland and travel to England, where they join the RAF and are torn apart by their mutual love of a lonely young woman (Tara Fitzgerald).

Despite its ravishing widescreen visuals and glorious aerial combat sequences, Jan Sverk's wartime melodrama is a little too restrained for its own good, even when the two main characters become divided by Vetch's unethical behavior. Performances are solid, but Sverk's intimate direction works against the film's epic sweep, and the result is neither one thing or another. Hdek looks like a Bel Ami porn beauty, which is a huge plus, and Charles Dance makes a brief appearance in the role of a pompous RAF commander.",1255046400,,922,5.294520547945205
1706394,5,B0000648X2,The DVD was ordered for a Fathers Day gift & since my dad speaks fluent Czech he really enjoyed watching it....great story line. The fact that it took 26 days & numerous emails to get the movie to me is another story. Vendors need to provide customers with a shipping company & tracking # - when I finally got one out of this company---the USPS said it was invalid. I ended up having to overnight it to my dad for him to rec. it on time....costing me that much more cash.  DVD itself....great!!,1245801600,,494,4.311827956989247
1706395,4,B0000648X2,"This is a very well written, directed, and acted film.  It is gripping, entertaining, and engaging all throughout its length.  The characters are real, the fears and hopes are  real, and I just really enjoyed this movie.

The film follows the course of several Czechoslovakian pilots who cannot reconcile themselves to Nazi occupation of their homeland.  They relocate their squadron to England and wait out the drudgery of inactivity until they are finally called upon to fight for the allied war effort against Germany.

The film shows very good aerial combat with accurate airplane (Supermarine Mark IV Spitfires, a B25 Mitchell - though this was mainly a Pacific theater plane, Messerschmitt Me 109) depictions.  There are enough closeups so to think there is an entire squadron of these vintage planes still around, and my guess is computer graphics played a large role in these scenes, but the effect comes across as quality and not cheesy.

The lives of the piolts is the main theme of the story.  They love, dream, hope, and struggle to survive.  Life expectancies of pilots was measured in weeks, not years.  Life had to be taken on the run.  This film shows all of this.  Its actors are capable and portray believable characters.  The irony of the love story is kind of heart wrenching at the end.

I recommend this film on many levels.  It is a good romance.  Not graphic and raunchy, but tasteful and affectionate.  It is a good war movie.  It shows a side of the war most Americans are not familiar with.  Czech pilots?  What are those?  Anyway, I really liked this movie.",1222214400,2,1585,4.771217712177122
1706396,5,B0000648X2,"Dark Blue world is a surprisingly good movie that is touching, tender , and bittersweet at the same time. Yes, it's war movie, But actually it is more than imbecile ""War Entertainment""(sorry, but I did not like majority of so-called war movie MANUFACTURED from Hollywood . e.g Pearl Habor) It is a story of friendship and heroism that forgotten by majority of people who are directly or indirectly benefited from it.

Some viwers may think ""Love Triangle"" is very cliched part influenced by Hollywood,but I think differently. Unlike other cliche ridden movies, in this movie Susan is just one of the huddles Franta and Karel have to prevail, not their ultimate goal.

The last scene is very bittersweet ,but clearly conveys a glimpse of hope  for Franta. Overall, well-done movie.",1217462400,,780,4.984615384615385
1706397,4,B0000648X2,"If you like WWII movies and want a little history with the entertainment, this is a great movie to watch - even with subtitles (first 1/3 of film). Wonderful photography!",1197590400,,170,4.7
1706415,5,B0000648X2,"The other reviwers did a good job describing the love triangle, the tragic story of the Czech pilots treatment by thier own countrymen under Communism after the war, and all the other human elements to this very human, beautifully filmed melancholy film.

But I would also like to add, for aviation buffs, particularly fans of flight sims such as Il2, this is one of the best portrayals of air combat in all it's excitement, thrill, elegance, danger and FEAR, that has ever been produced.  The flight scenes are breathtaking, and unusually for films dealing with world war II aviation, very effectively bring you into the cockpit, into the clouds and both behind the guns and in their lethal path...  Anyone who loves WW II fighters, flying, spitfires or warbirds in general should watch this film.",1172620800,12,798,4.896296296296296
1706416,5,B0000648X2,From the very beginning Dark Blue World is an excellent film.  It follows two Czech pilots who join the RAF to fight the Germans during the Battle of Britain and the consequences of what their passion to defend their country brings upon them.  They flying scenes are wonderful.  You become attached to the two main characters and at times it brings a tear to your eye. It is a story of friendship and love born out of war.  In the end one loses everything.,1168732800,3,456,4.392857142857143

1706419,4,B0000648X2,"Even though you probably haven't heard of this film it is exceptionally well made. The Battle of Britain from the eastern european pilot's perspective--but it really centers on the friendship of two pilots, a Polish and a Checkoslavakian flying in the RAF to defeat the Germans who over ran their homeland- who fall in love with the same English woman---a married woman at that. The aerial scenes are spectacular and seem more real than any fighter combat scenes I have seen in other WWII fighter combat films. Not a ton of money but you get a visceral feel for being in one of those old fighters--spitfires, hurricanes---and having to take on another fighter in mortal combat and at harrowing speeds. I highly recommend this film but I will warn you it is told through the 1950 perspective of the pilots who returned home after the war only to be jailed. So although there isn't a great deal of time spent in their prison it casts a sad net over the entire film that I wish wasn't there because so much in the heart of the story is light and beautiful and about the power of friendship.",1162512000,5,1087,4.551020408163265
1706420,5,B0000648X2,"This tells the story of a heretofore unknown piece of history.  While this film focuses on two Czech pilots, it should serve to remind all of us that there was a significant involvment by soldiers from occupied countries in the epic battles against facism and nazism.

This film is well put together and has excellant cinematography.  The special feature aboout the making of the film is good as well.  I especially liked the part about the director debating with his father on whether to shoot one more scene with the $1000/hr Spitfire.  One more flypast was the decision - If you've ever witnessed one of these fabulous machines in action...you'd understand!",1150588800,3,660,4.90990990990991
1706421,4,B0000648X2,"All the positive reviews are accurate. One aspect that especially struck me, however, was the restrained yet powerful use of digital special effects. For the most part, everything looked real -- mainly because the director didn't overdo it. In fact, I didn't even realize how much digital imagery there was until I watched the special features on the DVD.

If digital effects are done right, WWII has a great future in the movies. If they're overdone, or done shabbily, then those of us who want the brave men who fought the war to be honored have nothing to look forward to except Bruckheimerized garbage.",1149120000,2,606,4.826923076923077
1706422,5,B0000648X2,"To take a slightly different tack, I think this is the best anti-war film in a LONG time! It is sad in that the hero loses everything he Loved: his girlfriend, his beloved dog, his best friend and finally his freedom! It is even sadder in that he could have avoided all these losses if he had just had the intelligence to avoid the military. It does have a funny scene at the beginning, after he has taken off his girlfriend's dress and made Love to her in her lovely lace slip! He asks if her parents know they are in Love? And she says ""I think so but they don't know I let you Love me SO DEEPLY!!""

Sorry but he is not a hero, just one more loser in a war that should never have been fought. In war there are NO winners, just the walking wounded. I feel for him but he made his choices. And Never volunteer for anything!",1142035200,,823,4.049079754601227
1706423,4,B0000648X2,"Near the beginning of this film, on Czech radio, we hear this announcement: ""At six a.m. on March 15th the Armed forces of the German Reich will begin occupying our country.""  Upon this news a Czech airman reasons, ""now we can go home and take off our uniforms.""  But before that sentiment registers with you, he inquires of his compatriot, ""How long will it take you to pack?""  And off they go, our Franta and Karel, headed to England.  They are pilots and are supposed to be representitive of the hundreds of Czech pilots like them who ""fought with the British against the Nazis;"" flying RAF aircraft.  That's what this film is about; something to give one the flavor of this Czech contribution to the Allied war effort.  It's a Czech film and a darn good  war film by any measure.  Akin to the film ""The Battle of Britain,"" but unlike that British made picture,  ""Dark Blue World"" has a certain vibrancy that the former lacks.  (You're best bet actually would be to watch both of these films in tandem.) Initially the Czech pilots don't fare too well, of course---trying to learn English, as well as how to fly Spitfires simultaniously.  (Incidentially, the first 20 minutes of this film are all in Czech, but thereafter the pilots' native language and English are almost equally present in the balance of this film; the Czech's speaking in their own vernacular amongst themselves and English to all others.  All in all, it's an effective compromise since in this manner you never forgot where these guys hail from, and thus the sad mistake the Brits & (more accurately) the French made which necessitated these Czech pilots leaving their own country to battle Hitler.)  There's a romantic angle to this film as well, as young Karel falls for an older British woman making for a bit of an awkward love triangle (the details of which I won't go into for your---the prospective viewer's---benefit).  Remember what this film is entitled.  ""Dark Blue World"" doesn't just refer just to the skies; for the film addresses the personal side of war that is just plain painful, hurtful, sad, and unjust.  Franta, for instance (played by Ondrej Vetchy who gives a stand-out performance), almost loses his best friend; the friend loses the woman who he loves.  One officer loses a fiance to the circumstances of war, and all the Czech pilots who make it back to their homeland after the war (most of the film is told in flashbacks) were shortly thereafter imprisoned upon the Communists' seizure of power there; held thusly ""until 1951 in labour camps"" then treated as ""outcasts for most of their lives.""  Not until 1991, the film informs us at the end, were such survivors ""rehabilitated and recognized for their wartime service.""  ""For they [the Communists] feared these heroes would once again fight for freedom.""  It's a story that needed telling and it's done with panache in ""Dark Blue World.""  Do try to see it.  Cheers!",1137456000,5,2918,4.782435129740519
1706424,5,B0000648X2,"The director develops his characters well and creates a lovely complex story against a historical back drop.

1706435,5,B0000648X2,"Years ago I collected and read many of the ""Bantam War Book"" Series. Each was a non-fictional first-hand personal story about ""A World On Fire"" - World War II.

I was especially fascinated by the RAF pilots and their incredible Battle of Britain stories.  They were extraordinary men, like Douglas Bader, Stanford Tuck, and Pierre Clostermann: the brave Frenchman who, like the heroes in ""Dark Blue World,"" fled his occupied homeland to fight for the RAF.

This movie is an undiscovered treasure - resurrecting still again the emotions of authenticity those books once evoked.  While many films are ABOUT other times, this one seems more like a genuine window into the past.",1120348800,7,674,4.991071428571429
1706436,3,B0000648X2,"Dark Blue World is an interesting and unique story about Czech fighter pilots flying for the RAF during the Second World War.  Certainly for the war movie buff who's tired of plrthora of gung-ho American films in this genre, it is a welcome relief.  Unfortunately, I didn't find the movie to be all that great.  While the combat sequences were great, and the day to day experiences of the Czech pilots insightful, the love triangle the is the central aspect of the movie kind of ruins it.  This aspect of the film is just not developed enough to make the movie and moving and powerful as it could have been.",1119571200,4,607,4.490909090909091
1706437,5,B0000648X2,"This is a great movie and I would concur with the reviewer who said that it would have been phenomenally successful, if weren't a ""foreign"" movie.  The story of the friendship between an older man and his younger protge is wonderfully handled.  I was struck by how this movie explores what it is like for men to be platonically intimate in a way you almost never see in American movies.  This closeness between the two main characters, makes the later tension between them much more powerful as well as much more believable.  The woman's character is multilayered.  Her complex feelings for these men as well as her missing husband, is messy, which is the way in which man real-life relationship can be, particularly in the context of the trauma of war.

While this is a war movie, it is by no means just a war movie.  It really is a movie about mature human relationships, with all the nuances and complexities that they bring.  It's a story about characters that I come to like and believe are real and their struggles with love (both platonic and romantic), loyalty, and loss.  This might be one of those ultimate ""date"" flicks: enough action for most guys, but not too much for most gals; enough relationship stuff for most gals, but not too mushy for most guys. A nice balance and a great movie.",1113782400,5,1300,4.593073593073593
1706438,4,B0000648X2,"Dark Blue World depicts the story of Franta (Ondrej Vetch), an officer of the Czechoslovakian air force, that has been imprisoned after having served for the British Royal Air Force (RAF) in their fight against the Nazi's during World War II.  When Franta returned to his motherland after the war the Russian communists had occupied the country and fear that those who fought with the Brits would once more fight for freedom lead the communists to lock them all up in prison, or so called labor camps.  Franta was confined to one of these labor camps where the prison captain was a rough thug that seemed to take pleasure in tormenting and beating up the inmates.  The prison captain was uncaring of any health issues as he merely demanded the men to work while encouraging them to work by letting them know that the only way of escaping his presence was by the cart that carries out the dead.  Delirious in a high fever, Franta ultimately passes out as he is brought to the infirmary where he recovers under the hand of a former SS-officer while pondering over his past transgressions.

In flashbacks the audience is brought into the past where Franta's memories begin with the moments before the Nazi's occupied Czechoslovakia without bloodshed.  The only fighting that Franta faces is from one of his younger flyers, Karel (Krystof Hdek) , who displayed his resentment to the Germans while handing over the keys to the hangar with the planes.  Offended and saddened by the event Franta decides to travel wherever he can to fight the Germans as he brings the young Karel with him on a journey that brings both of them to England.  In England Franta is assigned a group of Czechoslovakians that spend more time learning English and practicing flying with bicycles as the learn how to fly in group formations than they do flying.  This ends up being a little demoralizing as they were in high spirits to get up in the sky and shoot down German Messerschmidts.  However, the day arrives when they are allowed to take to the sky, but soon they realize the painful nature of war as people die, people fall in love, and people get hurt.

War brings agony to everyone as people are left in a twilight unknowing whether someone dear is dead or alive.  Jan Sverk captures this moment in this film through several characters and their personal lives as they must find a way to continue to strive for something better: peace, freedom, and happiness.  In this struggle, which is tremendously wearing on the emotional aspect of mankind, people must grab affection when it is given and nurture it with the best of their ability.  One scene that brings the essence of affection to the audience is where Karel mentions that he liked one of the fallen pilots, but never told him.  Franta responds that he probably knew as men do not openly display their affection.  However, Karel insists that the fallen friend did not know, as he was more annoyed with the dead man's idiosyncrasies, and now he wishes that he would have told him before he died.

Dark Blue World is a poignant cinematic experience much like Jan Sverk's previous film Kolya (1996), which won an Oscar for best foreign film in 1997.  However, Dark Blue World does not have the warmth as Kolya did.  It is also missing uniqueness as this film has aspects comparable to previous war films such as Battle of Britain (1969), English Patient (1996), Pearl Harbor (2001), and Enemy at the Gates (2001).  Nonetheless, the film succeeds in standing on its own feet as it it offers a film event with a wealth of character and wisdom.",1104192000,6,3575,4.6896
1706439,5,B0000648X2,"Courage, friendship, wartime heroism...all the finest qualities of mankind are contrasted with the cruelty of the Nazi and Soviet occupations of Czechoslovakia in this WWII story of Czech fighter pilots who escaped the Nazi invasion to serve in England, and it is told in flashback from an airman who returns to his homeland, and is jailed and tortured by the Soviets, who took over and finished the job of crushing the Czech people when the Nazis were defeated.

The aerial photography is superb, and anyone interested in early fighter planes will love this film; cinematographer Vladimir Smutny is also masterful in the interior shots, with their ambiance of the late '30s-early '40s, and in capturing the picturesque English countryside. There is a gentleness to the story despite the violence of the war, and director Jan Sverak manages to touch every emotion during the course of this 112 minute film. It is brilliantly directed as well as acted, and the two male leads, Ondrej Vetchy (Franta) and Krystof Hadek (Karel), make their parts into living beings, and we laugh and cry with them.

Others of note are Tara Fitzgerald (Susan), Charles Dance (Commander Bentley), and Linda Rybova (Hanicka), and in the small part of an English teacher, Anna Massey puts in a memorable performance.

1706440,4,B0000648X2,"This is a movie that tells the tale of Czech fighter pilots during WWII.  The movie opens prior to France and England giving Czechoslovakia to the Germans and we get to see the tension of the people.  We also see the main character (Franta Slama) training some pilots.  With the capture of Czechoslovakia, Franta and his best student leave for Poland (the movie skips over Poland and France to get us to England).  In England, we get to see the Czech's being taught English (something that the air controllers had a real problem with the Czech and Polish pilots with) and demonstrating their use of English thru mock intercepts while riding bicycles (very funny because the bikes had mock wings and a transmitter on them!).  Later we get to see some aerial combat between the Czech's and Germans (some of the best aerial combat I've seen.  They had Spits, He-111's, and Me-109's, I believe the 109's were actually late war ones though).  The movie does have a love story and does a good job with it.  What's arguably the best piece of the movie though is that all of this is told as a dream because Franta is in a forced labor camp in Czechoslovakia (Czech troops who fought for the Western Allies that came home were put into forced labor camps to let the Communist take control of the country).

1706443,5,B0000648X2,"How do movies as impeccable as this miss the radar of critics and pop studios? Are people so averse to subtitles?
Some reviewers (very unfairly) compare this movie to the insipid Pearl Harbour because of a love triangle plot, but that is about all I can think of in terms of parallels. Yes, broadly speaking, this masterpiece pivots around a close relationship that develops between a flying instructor Slama and his junior protegee Karel during the 1940s -- mentor and mentee -- a bond that even a shared love interest fails to break. This could have easily gone down the trodden path, ending up in a hackneyed mushy lovestory with bereaved hearts and skipped beats. Not under Sverak's aegis.
For one thing, unlike Pearl Harbour, the love angle is integral to the movie and tightly intertwined with the narrative. A la ""The English Patient"". The woman in question happens to be married (with a husband who's MIA) and this makes it just that bit more interesting. The cinematography is breathtaking, including some of the best fighter-jet combat sequences you'll see on screen with vintage aircraft (there should have been more of these!) and some in-prison ruthlessness that may leave you squeamish. British accents are occasionally suspect (reminder: Czech movie) but easily glossed over. The splendid soundtrack itself begs a special mention -- if you have seen Kolya, the music is comparably moving.
But what makes this marvel of a movie immemorable is its non-Hollywood ending. Without giving away too much, it is a stirring close that confirms that the basic tenets of humanism run deep even amidst the throes of war. Nothing melodramatic, but deeply moving.

It would have been nice to see some different German aircraft besides HE 111s.  Since it seems they were using computer generated aircraft for the special effects it seems they could have included some JU 88s or ME 110s for variety sake.  Of course this is just a minor point and does not take away from the quality of the story.  The saga of Czechs, Poles and others who fought in the RAF or in the British army  deserves to be told as it is an aspect of WW2 that is not well covered.  So much has been done on WW2 that anything different is welcomed!  Overall a very good foriegn movie, without any of the over the top Hollywood stuff that often trivilizes the subject.

DARK BLUE WORLD is a fantastic film on the level of Amadeus or Kolya.  The dogfight action looks real unlike the star wars computer over-aided nonsense of Pearl Harbor in which planes routinely take right angle turns and perform aerobatics violating all laws of physics.
Beside that, of course, DARK BLUE WORLD has a story in it and an awesome set of real-life characters.  This is something Hollywood has never attempted as the LA bimbos mistake personality with heavy makeup, frizzy hairs, and revealing uncomfortable jump suits for their ""lovely"" world-saving heroines.
People that make this comparison don't deserve this movie and should go back to their Terminator sequences and films in which Bruce Willis saves the planet from the evil bad guys.  That's the level of entertainment these people can fathom.
Dark Blue World is perhaps one of the best movies ever.  It ranks up there with Amadeus, Some Like It Hot and stuff like that.
If you wanna see action, slo-motion explosions, bucketful of gore and sleazy sex scenes, you'll have to buy something else, something Hollywood.  This movie is for people with minds and hearts.

On paper this movie is a sure winner with those aerial fight scenes (not as splendidly done as ""Pearl Harbour"" but that's dependent upon the budget given), the bond between the Czech pilots (reminded me of a better offering from yesteryears, ""Memphis Belle""), betrayal & eventual reconciliation of friendships, international cast.  A movie that is commended to bring to our attention a little known fact about Czech pilots that fought chivalrously in World War 2 & yet, got to suffer the humiliation & torture of forced labour camp when their country fall under the Communist regime.

1706459,5,B0000648X2,"Nostalgia aside, the Czech film  ""Dark Blue World"" is a period piece set from 1936 to the present. Europeans really do know how to make good films and  ""Dark Blue World"" is one of them.  It is about a group of young Czech pilots who, after the Nazis waltzed in to their country in typical Nazi-invasion style, flee to England to fly for the RAF. The film uses a set of flashbacks (combining pre-World War II occupation by Germany and then later the ""occupation"" by the Soviets when the war was over) to run parallel themes and plot lines.

It is a story, too, of two pilots, best friends,  who have a different agenda--they both get involved with the same (married) English woman. These three ingredients already forecast tragedy.  As the war (and relationships) continues, the heartbreaks-to-happen seem to go unabated. While the theme of romantic love is explored, the nature of the friendship between the pilots is also examined, and, notwithstanding, the film's political agenda is also realized.  After all, occupation by both alien forces deserves to be a theme in any free-loving and free-living film!

One doesn't have to be much of a historian to know what happened to both the Nazis and the communists, but that doesn't lessen the pain of the suffering of those directly involved (Following the War the Czech pilots returned home, only to be arrested and imprisoned by the communists as Western collaborators, and it wasn't until the fall of the Iron Curtain in l991 that they were released--to the honor of their true countrymen).

""Dark Blue World"" is filmed ""in the old fashioned way"" that is, without Hollywood's predilection for computerized everything and for American fans' obsession for films with more than a plethora  of extreme violence, incredibly awful language, explicit sexual scenes, an overbearance for drug related (and inspired) scenarios, and simply barrels of melodrama or gratuitous everything-in-bad-taste (smile!).",1039910400,20,1948,5.09748427672956

See a different take on WWII flyers with the central story a love triangle with two pilots in love with the same woman, only this one made with some adult sensibility.
The story of Czech pilots who fled their Nazi occupied country to fly for the RAF in England, the technical aspects of the film are done with care, and the flying sequences accurate and rendered with excellent special effects.  Portrayed with a deliberate absence of ""heroics"", these courageous men are shown to be normal men doing extraordinarily brave things with a workmanlike and professional attitude.  They master their fear and fly and die with understated dignity and strength.  Watching them felt like witnessing the real deal.  Men die by accident and just plain bad luck; and, their friends have little time to grieve, but must suit-up and go up against the enemy again.
The love story develops accidentally and with the logical ""illogic"" that is love.  It is told simply without histrionics, yet the feelings, though muted, are real and powerful.
Told in flashback from the horror and ultimate injustice of these heroes having been imprisoned by the Communists on their return to Czechoslavakia after the war, the film ultimately is about friendship and comradeship that survives all the tests that human relationships can be put through.  It is an excellent film, but it's low key tone and telling dictates that it misses that final emotional tug that would have made it a classic.  4-1/2 stars.

Combining first rate special effects with real planes, it does to flying what ""Saving Private Ryan"" did for infantry combat, setting a visceral standard of sight and sound (especially sound) that everything else will have to match up to.  The tracers, the battle damage, the sounds of cannon shells whistling by, it's just amazing.

1706475,5,B0000648X2,"If you read lukewarm reviews of this film, ignore them; they were just blowback from Pearl Harbor.  Apparently (I've not seen Pearl Harbor), there are some surface similarities between the two movies--the WWII setting; two friends who are a fliers; a shared love interest--and I suppose that scenario could be considered cliched, but it seems as if critics, who uniformly hated Pearl Harbor, were unwilling to judge Dark Blue World on its own merits.  Their reviews are mostly petulant complaints about having to sit through a Czech version of the prior Hollywood flop.
The fascinating story here, based on historical events, involves a veteran Czech pilot, Franta (Ondrej Vetchy), and a fresh-scrubbed young farm boy, Karel (Krystof H&aacute;dek). >As this too simple description suggests, there's ample ammunition here for critics who wanted to dismiss the film as cliched.  But what it's not possible to convey here is how affecting the film is, especially the great love portrayed, which as in all war movies is not the physical love between Franta and Susan but the comradely love of Franta and Karel, who share so much, but ultimately too much.  And the point is that their relationship works and it draws us in.  They are very likable--the one eager and innocent; the other more experienced and reserved.  They're something of an odd match but we can see what they provide to one another, especially in such trying times.  We care about them.  We ache when they hurt each other.  We want them to patch things up.  We feel ennobled by the sacrifices they make for one another.  We can fathom how beautiful yet painful Franta's memories must be to him and why they would remain so close to the surface of his mind.  Indeed, Ondrej Vetchy is especially good as Franta, with his soulful, mournful eyes and the rare gravity he brings to the character.  By the end of the film he's experienced so much loss--to the Nazis, to the Communists, of his friends, of lovers--but there's still a calm dignity that compels our attention and earns our respect.
We're a couple years on now and maybe folks have forgotten about Pearl Harbor.  Heck, I don't think anyone saw it but the critics anyway.  So pick up Dark Blue World and watch it for itself, not in order to compare it to some other film.  It is a lovely movie.

1706476,4,B0000648X2,"Dark blue world is one of the finest foreign war films I seen to date. Everyone involved really seemed to care about the project they were involved in and the result is a very entertaining and for the most part accurate depiction of the side of WWII we very rarely get to see. What we have here is a story of two Czech pilots, Franta and Karel, who upon the occupation of their country decide to jump ship and head for England to enlist in the RAF. Just how they get to England at the end of 1939 remains a mystery, but it suffices to say that many Czechs, Poles and French crossed the Channel to England, in time for the Summer of 1940. The two pilots leave behind their families and loved ones, actually one of the most endearing scenes is where Franta has to leave his beloved dog behind, and are accepted into the foreign ranks of the RAF, where they undergo a series of training scenes, including a brilliant section on learning English and formation flying, on bicycles! They have to contend with sitting around waiting to be called into the Battle of Britain after their training is complete as the RAF were very reluctant to let the Czechs and Poles get involved in ""their finest hour"". Only when things heated up, where the foreign contingent called in. This leads to the meat of the film, the superbly done battle sequences. This is where the films producers have outdone Hollywood easily. One can feel the cramped condition of the cockpit, the desperate nature of aerial combat and the horror of being shot down. When bullets and cannon fire strike a spitfire in this film you know it. For the most part the two combatants aircraft are represented well. Although the spitfires are mid-war and late-war models and the 109's are Spanish built buchons. But both are effective. The computer animated heinkels are also very well done as are the out-takes from the 1969 film ""Battle of Britain"", cleaned up and inserted seamlessly into the finished movie.
It's during one of these ""shooting down"" sequences that one of our pilots, Karel, meets Susan played by Tara Fitzgerald. The obligatory love interest. Fitzgerald is a potential war widow, whose husband has been feared lost in the Atlantic, with the Navy. The pilot, the younger of the two, falls instantly for the older woman and becomes besotted by her. This is where the friendship of the two Czech pilot's is severely tested as later the older pilot, Franta, falls for Fitzgerald too who in turn falls in love with him. Complicated.......yeah?
The love distraction doesn't really interfere with the run of the film too much and the action sequences more than make up for there lack of pace, but I'm I the only person whose sick of filmmakers dispersing petty love stories into war movies? They usually don't work very well.
There are flaws though. I would have liked to see more of the Battle of Britain section and the hardships endured by fighter command in the summer of 1940 and the later war years are inserted without any real knowledge of what period of the war we're in. Another technical flaw is the camouflage of the spitfires doesn't change throughout the war, they remain in the 1940 pattern of green and brown when they should have been painted green and gray after 1941. The flashback sequences of Franta, from a Soviet forced-labour camp after the war, doesn't really work as a framing device, but it does introduce us to some interesting characters such as an SS doctor which Slava shares his prison with. The SS doctor is presented as a man and not the usual cardboard nazi monster of Hollywood movies. It's quite refreshing to see. Also at the beginning, the Czech pilots talk about flying to Poland and helping them. However, I very much doubt that any Czechs would have flown North to Poland as antagonisms between Poland and Czechoslovakia were still very strong from the polish seizing of the Teschen region of Czechoslovakia in the late '30s. But the flaws are small when placed into the whole film and only someone with an above average interest in World War II will notice them. There is one problem with DVD presentation of the film though. It's to do with the subtitling of the movie itself. The DVD will allow you to have the subtitles either on or off, in other words the English captions are onscreen even when the English speaking characters are speaking English. This can be very annoying and very distracting. Its also quite lazy of the DVD's manufacturer as the English captions can easily be turned off when English is being spoken onscreen.
Overall, if you like war movies and especially war movies based on aircraft and air warfare, then you will like ""Dark blue world"". It certainly blows some recent war movies out of the water and is entertaining in its own right. The subject matter is one you will probably not see onscreen again and the 1940 atmosphere is presented perfectly, as is the difficulties in trying to blend foreign volunteers into a generally mono-ethnic combat force. The acting from everyone concerned is spot-on and Charles Dance fits in as an airfield commander.",1028160000,5,5085,4.714606741573034
1706477,4,B0000648X2,"Lately, I have been drawn to war movies filmed from a point of view distinctly not American. This film can serve as a helpful primer to historical fact as to Czech involvement in the allied war effort during WWII. And that effort was heroic indeed. The production values and especially the cinematography of this Czech produced film are every bit as good as anything American audiences are accustomed to, but one must adapt to subtitles unless of course, you speak Czech. But it was the humanity of the characters that made this story so compelling. For instance, the Czech wing commandeer, upon returning from a training mission with his young pilot officers did not display the slightest hesitation in eagerly seeking out his dog for a gentle romp on the ground in full view of his subordinates. You would never see John Wayne or Gregory Peck display such affection for a dog in similiar circumstances. Another altered perspective had to do with allowing the engineer and fireman of a rolling supply train to evacuate before aerial straffing began. As a long time aviation buff, I purchased this movie because of the promise of airplanes. The movie does not disappoint. Some details were noted by this viewer for the first time, such as the distinctive thud of landing gear doors slamming shut on a departing Spitfire, even a tail wheel casually rotating about its axis upon a grassy landing. From an action point of view, the flying sequences were excellent and Spitfires were plentiful. But to me, the real draw came to be the bonding of men in perilous times, and for the Czech pilots who fought with the RAF in WW11, I learned this process did not realize full closure until the early 1990's.",1026777600,,1698,4.77891156462585
1706478,4,B0000648X2,"This little European film is great!  This is by far a better war movie than ""Pearl Harbor"" or ""Saving Private Ryan.""

I think they could have told the story without flashback mode, but just in present-day mode.  Great characters, story, action scenes, and languages - English, Czech (almost like Polish), French, and German.

The attention to detail was quite admirable.  I loved watching the basic aircraft training - on bicycles!  I can't think of a single cliche in this flick, and the characters were all original and complex.  Overall, a very well-made film, and probably the most expensive-looking European film I've ever seen.  Let's hope more like this come from the Czech Republic!

1706479,5,B0000648X2,"Speaking as a war film buff; I can say that this is about as perfect a movie as you are ever going to see.  The characters are deep, not stereotyped and completely believable.  The acting is top notch, the directing is brilliant, and the cinematography is breathtaking.  It is a very real movie with no ""ulterior motive"" behind it other than telling a powerful story behind the backdrop of WWII.  As the director says ""it's about men who live by their conscience...about heroism.""  This is a very multi-faceted movie; not mono-dimensional at all, and produces genuine emotion through characters you can care about and relate too.  If that weren't enough, the atmosphere is the best I've seen short of a Spielberg movie.  The uniforms, planes, and equipment are all authentic and the characters speak their own language, be it Czech, English, German or French.  If you do not choose to buy this then I strongly urge you to rent it--it is the best film I have seen in ages...",1024617600,2,973,4.715976331360947
1706480,4,B0000648X2,"I watched this film last night (VHS) and found it to be most interesting and well done.
Even though it has a series of flashbacks, from 1950 to 1940, it is pretty easy to follow the storyline and the characters.
The subtitles won't slow you down either.
It mainly follows the adventures of a group of Czechs who flee German occupied homeland and seek to fight with the British against the Germans.
It starts a bit slow, but picks up with some very good scenes that are handled by a gifted director. Once the group begins flying against the Germans, a change takes place in the film. There are more Spitfires than you can shake out of a birch tree. Some stunning and incredibly intense action sequences that are on the level of any other film of this type. The air to ground attacks are top notch and will get your attention.
The Czechs speak Czech, the Germans German and the British, of course, the Queen's English - some touching scenes when the pilots are being taught English.
Worth the time to view and enjoy this little Czech gem.

1706481,5,B0000648X2,"I'm quickly realizing that there are some unbelievably good foreign films out there (I own about a half-dozen now). My wife and I watched Dark Blue World on DVD this weekend. It is one of the best epic war movies that I've ever seen and a very fine DVD release. The cinematography was amazing and the Dolby Digital mix was stunning. I felt as if there really were Spitfires and BF-109s flying through my living room!
In case you haven't heard of it, Dark Blue World is about Czech fighter pilots who fought for the RAF during World War II. In addition to an amazing history lesson, it was one of the best war screenplays I've ever seen and was wonderfully acted and directed.  This is the first movie in a long, long time that I really felt connected to the characters. It makes me want to see more from this director and these actors.  Jan Sverk should have been nominated for Best Director.  Ondrej Vetch (as Frantisek Slma), Krystof Hdek (as Karel Vojtisek), and Tara Fitzgerald (as Susan) were all outstanding.  It is rare that you see a movie so well balanced with stellar performances.  Even the dog was perfectly cast (you'll know what I mean when the tears are rolling down your face as the main character has to leave her behind)!
Most of the movie is in Czech with English subtitles, which is refreshing.  Hearing everything in the correct language sure does make the experience so much more fulfilling.  It has the best aerial combat scenes in any film, ever.  You'd think that you were seeing very high-quality historical film of the real thing.  I'm a pilot and, as such, I'm extremely demanding in this area for accuracy down to the last detail.  Let me tell you that the production staff for Dark Blue World didn't miss any detail.  The combat sequences will take your breath away and really leave you with an appreciation for the sacrifices made by these pilots.
Even though I just saw it a couple of days ago, I'm gonna watch it again really soon.  You won't be disappointed!!! I think that this film is the sleeper hit of 2001. It has my unqualified recommendation.",1023148800,50,2083,4.56989247311828
1706482,5,B0000648X2,"Not having heard of this film when it was overshadowed in general theatrical release by the usual Hollywood offerings, I discovered the joys of DARK BLUE WORLD from the DVD version.  What a revelation!  Not only is the story fine and more than worth telling (based as it is on fact), but the simple technique that director Jan Sverak uses (and further explains in the enhanced information on the DVD)makes this small movie innovative on many levels. Paying homage to the fact that the story reports the interplay and codependence of the Czech pilots with the British RAF, the film is very naturally told in a combination  of Czech and English.  So natural is the total presentation that we forget we are watching a ""foreign film"" and just explore the sensitivity and genuine tale of love and friendship and companionship all heightened by the presence of WWII.  The musical score is enchanting, the photography is beautiful, the acting by all the cast is superb (Czechs play Czechs, Brits play Brits and Germans play Germans).  Some viewers are putting this little jewel down as a sudsy soap.  I am sorry for them.  What is so wrong about addressing issues so heart friendly as these in a simple and honest manner?

1)  Better action than Pearl Harbor (which I thought was a weak movie, action wise)
2)  More realistic.  I can count the amount of times I knew it was computer generated stuff on one hand.
3)  Excellent plot.
4)  The ending.  I don't want to ruine it, but it sure as heck isn't as predictable as Pearl Harbor.  This ending actually brought tears to my eyes, and revealed a message of how deep frendship goes.",1022544000,3,539,4.205882352941177

7960552,4,B0000648X2,"Dark Blue World is a beautiful and historically significant film that deals with the persecution of the Czechoslovak pilots who escaped to England at the beginning of WWII and flew with the RAF against Nazi Germany.  After the war when Czechoslovakia became a Communist country these war heroes were persecuted by their own government ""for flying with the enemy"", that being the British now that the Cold War was in full swing.  The film's imagery, emotion, music etc. are first rate as is often the case with films made in Czech.  Also, the director's comments and ""the making of"" special features add significantly.  I recommend this film to anyone interested in history and stories of wartime romance.",1453507200,,704,4.9914529914529915
7960553,5,B0000648X2,"This is an outstanding film. It relates a story that deserves far more recognition than it has ever gotten, namely the vital role played by Czech pilots serving in the RAF in the early days of WW II. The film is beautifully photographed, and of course it's a very great pleasure to see Spitfires in action at this late date. The flight sequences are very convincing and effective. Purists might object to the amount of time the Spitfires spend flying in the treetops, as well as the appearance of a natural metal B -25 over the English Channel in 1940, but in the overall context of the film these seem like minor objections. As a pilot with a longstanding interest in aviation history, it is very gratifying to me to see a film maker take such care to get the technical details right.
I thought the cast was outstanding, and very believable in the roles chosen for them. The friendship that forms the core of the film is portrayed with warmth and realism and not a little sadness.
. Fellow dog lovers are likely to agree that Barchka steals the film, classic warplanes notwithstanding.
This really is the best performance by an animal I've ever seen in a movie.
This film fully justifies any extra effort required to locate it. A good friend of mine found it and made sure I watched it. For this I am very grateful.
Very highly recommended.",1449360000,,1341,4.545454545454546
