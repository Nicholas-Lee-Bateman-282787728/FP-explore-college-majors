2831046,5,B000Q677CC,"I was prepared not to like this movie version of that Queen of the Irish familial tale, Maeve Binchy's TARA ROAD, but I was totally, amazingly surprised.  First, the photography is exquisite.  Both homes are simply gorgeous and the scenery, whether Connecticut or Dublin (in all probability both filmed in South Africa!) is just lovely.  This isn't Binchy's long, complicatedly rich novel, but then it doesn't have to be and yet it still remains faithful to the story's essence.  Binchy's books always have me sniffling and tearing up at some point; the movie did as well.  Andie MacDowell is aging well --- a mature actress in a plum role; Olivia Williams also as a maturing colleen is fine and captivating.  The rest of the cast is sublime and provide superb performances.  So refreshing to see a great movie based upon an even greater book.  Highly recommended.",1190937600,,864,4.86986301369863
2831047,4,B000Q677CC,"This movie begins with a pair of startling tragedies: a Connecticut woman's son dies at his 15th birthday party, and an Irish woman's husband announces (also at a child's birthday party) that he is leaving her for his pregnant girlfriend. The two women, strangers, decide to swap houses for reasons that are probably clearer in the book.
Indeed, there are probably lots of things that are clearer in the book. It really doesn't matter, though, because this movie is a parade of human relationships. Friends, parents, spouses, romantic partners, business partners, siblings, and all the possible permutations of these relationships are explored.
There is enough plot to make the movie satisfying, and it is a visually rich and beautiful film. The people in the movie are of different ages, ethnic backgrounds, sexual orientations, and physical types. There is plenty of scenery and lovely interiors, but not so much that it overshadows the actors. Thge sound track is very nice, with Irish and American music, and songs selected to suit the plot.
There are touching moments, and thought-provoking ones, and I ended up wanting to go read the book (by the fine Irish storyteller Maeve Binchy) this is based on.",1190851200,3,1207,5.0703517587939695
2831048,4,B000Q677CC,"Never heard of the movie Tara Road? It was released in Irish theaters two years ago, but is going straight to DVD in the U.S. The packaging, which strongly suggests ""Chick Flick""!, looks like a cross between Love, Actually and Four Weddings and a Funeral. The only reviews I could find (other than on Amazon.com) were in Dutch. In spite of all these warnings, and my short attention span, I gave it a try.

And I quite enjoyed it. Perhaps low expectations made it possible, but it was pleasant to watch a low-key movie about (mostly) believable characters. Andie McDowell has made a successful career of playing tightly-wound women, and she's perfect in Tara Road. The movie is based on a Maeve Binchy novel, which I haven't read. After watching the movie, I think I may just have to sample Maeve Binchy's novels.",1190851200,,813,4.685314685314685
2831049,3,B000Q677CC,"I am a fan of Maeve Binchy's books and was surprised to see one of my favorites, Tara Road was made into a movie.  I will say, that if you are a fan of the books, that this will not have the same detail of the book.  The characters are well casted, but not fleshed out as they are in the book, but nevertheless, I enjoyed the movie.

The movies two main characters are Marilyn Vine, who lives in Connecticut with her husband, and is grieving over her son's recent death and Ria Lynch, who lives with her two children and husband in Dublin, Ireland and has just found out that he has a pregnant mistress.

Through an interesting turn of events Marilyn gets in touch with Ria and they agree to swap houses over a two month period.

I found that although the movie was somewhat different from the book in the detail, it was still satisfying watching the two women get used to their new surroundings and understand that even though they were out of their normal lives that they still needed to deal with their problems so that they could heal and move on.  For Marilyn, this means reconciling with her husband and through her insite into Ria's life she becomes grateful for what she does have even though she cannot replace her son.  For Ria, she has her children, and she comes to appreciate them even more when she sees what kind of pain the loss of Marilyn's son has brought her.

The casting was excellent, with Andi MacDowell as Marilyn and Olivia Williams as Ria.  Also putting in a good performance in a supporting role is Stephen Rea.

Definitely a rainy day chick flick.  Not a 5 star, but definitely worth a watch.",1190678400,,1620,4.402684563758389

2831083,2,B000Q677CC,This movie could have been called Maple Street. Maeve Binchy wrote lovely stories with fully developed characters.  This movie was such a hack Job.

2831087,3,B000Q677CC,"I watched it with my wife to keep her happy. But the movie lost me when the supposed New England house was landscaped with tropical plants. I thought is was Southern California but found out in the credits it was South Africa.

But I do have to say that I 'liked' it better than 'The Holiday' which had a way too similar story line with a different ending.",1351209600,,356,4.235294117647059
2831088,1,B000Q677CC,"I've been a fan of Maeve Binchy's books (the early ones, at least) for some 20 years now, and ""Circle of Friends"" is still one of my favorite movies - so I was pleasantly surprised to see that one of her more recent works had been turned into a movie.

Then I *watched* the movie.

I came out of it wondering who it was that I was supposed to be rooting for. You'll know the premise from reading the Amazon description: a jilted wife and a grieving mother exchange houses so that they can get away from their sorrows for a while, which is similar to the premise of the more light-hearted (and far more enjoyable) ""The Holiday."" The two women in this story came across as stupid and rude. I found it annoying and unpleasant that both of them were so willing to invade each other's personal space (on arrival, one on them even rifles through the other woman's underwear drawer). Annoying, too, that it takes more than half the movie for the Irish woman to ask WHY the American was so upset.

They're both surrounded by supporting characters who are stereotypes at best, almost all of them unlikeable to the point where I wanted to throw expensive vases at them (as the Irish woman finally does to her ignorant boor of a husband).

I read the novel ""Tara Road"" some time ago, and I honestly don't remember disliking it, probably because the length of the story allowed for some fleshing out of the characters, making it understandable why they act the way they do. If you've read the book and are considering watching (or buying) the movie - I'd recommend you stick with the book. I sat through the entire movie only so that I could give it a considered review. Really, it's not worth the two hours of your time.",1344729600,,1709,4.4504792332268375
2831089,5,B000Q677CC,"This is a great movie, and I had been waiting for a long time to order it.  I was very pleased with the packaging, and the condition was new.  I was very pleasantly surprised when I received this movie before the estimated date of arrival.",1341446400,,239,4.288888888888889

The Irish woman, Ria Lynch, is played by Olivia Williams; she assumes her life is going well, but then at the most inopportune time, her husband leaves her for his pregnant girlfriend.

In Connecticut, Marilyn Vine (Andie MacDowell)is tragically bereaved by the sudden death of her teenage son.  Unable to move past the grief, she sees the opportunity--of trading houses with the Irish woman--as a solution to her problems.

Each woman finds more than she bargained for, as the lives each of them take over offer the chance to see the world with a fresh perspective and to bond with unexpected friends.

While the movie was a treat, in that it's always good to see Andie MacDowell, and the addition of Stephen Rea as the Irish restauranteur added a colorful note, I found the novel superb--a hard act to follow.

2831101,1,B000Q677CC,"Although the synopsis of this movie sounds like it would be a good study in grieving, it is a huge disappointment.  From a traditional values point of view, it is virtually a total waste.  My wife was even shocked to discover that the Irish woman's youngest 'daughter' was actually a boy.  If there is ever a time in a person's life when they feel a need to turn to God, it is after the death of a loved one; even more so if the loss is a child.  It doesn't seem to even enter either parent's head.  The mother even seems bewildered when two kind ladies gave her a sympathy card along with asking the parish priest to say a Mass for the repose of the boy's soul.

Instead, it seemed that everyone involved was more interested in sexual or quasi-sexual relationships with most everyone they met.  [At least it seemed so.]  When the movie finished, my wife said simply, 'I'm confused.'  If there is any message to this movie, it would be that money solves everything.  There are so many more realistic and moving movies to watch, I'd suggest watching one of them and forgetting this one.",1212969600,3,1085,4.434343434343434
2831102,3,B000Q677CC,"I'd like to be perfectly candid with you: this movie is more deserving of two than three stars, but I cannot bring myself to rate it so lowly. Why? It's a question of expectation, and my hesistance to subvert it (for a very similar situation, see my review of _The River King_ DVD).

One's expectations are rightly high upon reading the back cover of this DVD. We have a screenplay based on a best-selling Maeve Binchy novel; an all-star international cast including Andie McDowell, Olivia Williams, and no less than Stephen Rea; a cutesy if gimmicky transatlantic house-swap premise; and a capable Scottish director. So, by the time you've popped this in the player, your expectations are or should be fairly high.

That's why the let-down, when it comes, is a blow. The acting abilities of almost every actor are severely tested here. Olivia Williams comes off the best; she is believable, at least, as a woman whose philandering husband turns her cozy world upside down. Andie MacDowell--well, I have few words to describe how disappointing, unsympathetic, and emotionally unresonant her performance here is. A real pity, because she is lovely to watch, with a beautiful face that is naturally expressive but which, here, is bafflingly blank, even after her character's warming ""catharthis"" points.

A bevy of fine, veteran Irish actors (Maria Doyle Kennedy, Brenda Fricker)are given short shrift with poor characterization and dialogue. Ah, the dialogue--wooden, clunky, and full of pregnant pauses. I do not include in the ""fine"" category the teenage actress playing Ria's daughter Annie; her scenes and dialogue are amongst some of the least believable, most poorly delivered in the film, and the movie suffers for it (she's an important character).

The director erred--grossly--in using *these* Irish/British and South African actors to play Americans. The characters are caricatures, one-dimensional and with poor American accents to boot. (The accent and acting of pan-Euro Jean Marc Barr alone are disorienting in the extreme). The choice to try to get wide panoramic shots of the ""New England"" neighborhood mystifies me, given that the scenery in the background is so clearly southeast African (it screams ""safari"").

And the ending--that deus ex machina ending that is straight out of a situation comedy, not the emotionally layered scenarios Binchy is capable of creating in her better novels.

I am smacking my head against my forehead, wondering ""Why?"" Why was a movie with so much potential given such painfully poor treatment? Why were the actors not on their game (and these actors are not exactly C-list)? Why were the situations treated with so little nuance as to come off as absurd and hackneyed--the cheating boss, the cheating husband, the Waiting to Exhale wronged-wife moment, the Other Woman subplots...?

So, it is with a heavy heart that I cannot recommend _Tara Road_ to people who, like me, had reasonably high expectations of it. What I *can* do is recommend it to people who expect no more than a transatlantic/Irish ambience, scenes--but not thoughtful explorations-- of family dysfunction, and a mild revenge-of-the-wife vindication sub-plot.

If those are your only expectations, you may just like this film, and more power to you; I really hope you do.",1206576000,2,3290,5.182674199623352
2831103,3,B000Q677CC,"Based upon a novel by Maeve Binchy that was selected as part of Oprah's Book Club, TARA ROAD is the story of two different women living continents apart.  Fifteen-year-old Dale Vine (Christ Jaco Olckers) is tragically killed at his own birthday party while riding a motorbike given to him by his father.  Dale's mother, Marilyn (Andie MacCowell), can't cope with the death and goes into a deep depression.  She decides she needs to get away and makes a phone call overseas to find out about a possible house switching.  Meanwhile, across the Atlantic Ria Lynch (Olivia Williams) is informed at her son's birthday party that her husband Danny (Iain Glen) is leaving her for his pregnant mistress, Bernadette (Heike Makatsch).  Ria is attempting to deal with this news when she receives a phone call from Marilyn.  Deciding to take things into her own hands, Ria agrees to the house-switch.  She goes to America and Marilyn comes to the house at Tara Road in Ireland.  Though separated by thousands of miles, the women become connected as they bond with each other's friends and family, learning the secrets that each one holds, and gaining strength from the kindness of their new surroundings and the strangers that become friends.

TARA ROAD is a chick-flick without much romance.  Marilyn goes to Ireland to figure out her life and falls more in love with her husband.  Meanwhile, Ria comes to America and realizes what a jerk her husband has been.  The movie doesn't offer any deep messages really and isn't a tear-jerker.  It can best be described as an ""adult coming of age story"".  The acting is solid across the bar.  It's also incredibly short with a run-time of just over ninety-minutes.

The DVD includes a trailer for the film, an interview with author Maeve Binchy, and some other trailers.  The Maeve Binchy interview is rather short, but also informative.  As a bit of trivia, you can see Maeve Binchy and her husband in a cameo role as a restaurant patron at the bar where Rose Maria takes Marilyn.",1201910400,,2012,4.799418604651163
2831104,3,B000Q677CC,"Trading lives with somebody else is something a lot of people wish they could do. Just take ""The Holiday,"" for example.

And in ""Tara Road, it becomes an important event for two women. This movie, adapted from Maeve Binchy's novel, is basically just an Irish/American chick-flick -- a determinedly sugary finale, but with fairly good acting and some truly gorgeous scenery in Ireland.

Three thousand miles apart, two women suffer horrific personal tragedies -- Marilyn's (Andie McDowell) son dies in a birthday motorcycle accident, and Ria (Olivia Williams) loses her hubby to his pregnant girlfriend. Given the chance to temporarily switch homes -- and lives -- they both jump at the opportunity. Ria heads for a quiet New England house, while Marilyn heads for Ireland's Tara Road.

No, I have no idea why they would swap houses with a total stranger, but still. Both women settle into the other's lives, and as they mourn for children and marriages alike, they begin to bond with new people, and discover new things about themselves. Unsurprisingly, they also get a bit of new closure (especially Ria).

I personally have never read a Maeve Binchy novel -- my tastes are funnier, more dramatic, more avant-garde or more fantastical. But ""Tara Road"" will probably appeal to those who liked ""The Holiday"" -- easy labels, charming settings (hey, that's not New England!), and okay acting on all fronts.

But director Gillies MacKinnon seems a little confused -- is he making a women's weepie or a cuddly comedy? The plot has some elements of both, being sentimental one minute and wryly funny the next -- sort of a Lifetime comedy. The main weakness is the ending, a rather absurd showdown between various characters that magically fixes all that is still wrong.

But along the way, you do get some very beautiful Irish scenery and pretty little looks at the title location. The New England scenery was kind of weird, though -- that obviously isn't New England at all.

Olivia Williams gives a lovely performance as the wronged wife, who struggles to heal from her problems; Andie McDowell gives a steady, rather ordinary performance. Most of the other characters are easy cliches, though -- the caddish hubby, the mistress, the quirky friends, the gay guys, et cetera, et cetera. But the actors do well with what they have.

""Tara Road"" is a sentimental, pleasantly laid-back movie with a weak finale, but fans of Binchy -- and ""life-swapping"" stories -- will probably enjoy it all.",1199750400,,2484,4.954326923076923
2831105,4,B000Q677CC,"I was thrilled to find this released on DVD in the US.  Although it had played in theatres abroad, it was never released for big-screen viewing in US.  Too bad, as I found it most enjoyable and a reminder of how great Maeve Binchy's ""Tara Road"" was as a novel.

Although the movie only recounts about the final half of the book, the director has been able to lay open the characters of Marilyn and Ria and expose their deepest hurts in this engrossing tale of crumbling marriages.  Andie McDowell gives an excellent portrayal of the emotionally frozen Marilyn, a Connecticut mother, reeling from the death of her fifteen-year-old son on his birthday.  The surprise gift from his Dad, a motorcycle, leads to his death and causes a wide rift between the parents.  Across the Atlantic at another birthday party in Dublin, the content Ria Lynch (Olivia Williams) learns from her husband Danny (Iain Glen) that he is leaving her for his pregnant girlfriend.  Both women are at the end of their emotional ropes and through a midnight phone call are connected and arrange a house swap.  Believing no problem is so big it can't be run away from, the two women each slip easily into the other's life.  Each learns in her own way that life will never be the same but that doesn't mean it is over.  Binchy's wonderful tale of healing transfers to the screen thanks to outstanding casting, lush scenery, and heartfelt situations.  ""Tara Road"" is a most enjoyable movie to curl up and entertain yourself with for a couple of hours.",1197936000,16,1518,4.669172932330827
2831106,3,B000Q677CC,"Maeve Binchy's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tara-Road/dp/0385341814/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tara Road</a>&nbsp;was an amazingly complicated plot. Binchy wove two sets of friends on either side of the Atlantic throughout the story.  I wondered how it would ever be brought to the screen.  The film deletes the early years of Danny's rise to hard-sell real estate tycoon, the way Ria first captured his fancy, their marriage and joy over getting their dream house on Tara Road, and the extensive description of Rosemary's business methods.  Many of the book's detailed subplots like Danny's boss' affair receive just a glancing blow in the screenplay due to time.

As a film, the casting was much different from how I imagined the characters.  Director Gilles MacKinnon helmed numerous European television productions; and ""Tara Road"" has a made-for-TV feel.  Andie McDowell won the Los Angeles Film Critics Association award for Best Actress in 1988 for ""Sex, Lies & Videotape.""  She was nominated for Golden Globe Best Actress awards in 1990 for the romantic ""Green Card"" & in 1994 for ""Four Weddings & a Funeral.""  As Marilyn Vine, she didn't have the depth of grief I saw in the character, more of a nervous energy. During her most emotional moment of grieving by the pool, MacKinnon sets the camera far back to frame the moment from her husband Greg's perspective, keeping us at a distance from her.  If you compare that scene to Marcia Gay Harden's similar grief scene in the film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Invisible/dp/B000TAN904/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Invisible</a>, that director brings us close in to what is a wave of pain and sorrow.  The bottom line is that McDowell comes across in this film as more of a plot point than an engaging character whose emotions grab us and drag us into her world.

Olivia Williams was in ""Peter Pan"" in 2003,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mood-Swingers/dp/B00005OCLO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mood Swingers</a>&nbsp;in 2001, and ""The Sixth Sense"" in 1999.  As Ria Lynch, she seems like a vulnerable house frow who's lost most of her attractiveness.  The change that occurs in Ria from the shattering experience of divorce to finding inner strength seems more described that portrayed.  As with McDowell, we observe her circumstance, but are never fully grabbed into her frightening uncertainty of change.

Iain Glen won the Silver Bear award for Best Actor at the Berlin International Film Festival in 1990 for ""Silent Scream.""  He appeared in ""Gorillas in the Mist"" in 1988 and ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"" in 2001.  This is a guy who is supposed to be an exceptional salesman that is so attractive to the ladies that he can be married to one and conduct affairs with two others concurrently.  Glen just wasn't that man.  Therefore, all of the craziness that swirls about him seemed staged rather than emotionally possible.

Stephen Rea played Colm who owns the neighborhood restaurant on Tara Road.  He was nominated for an Oscar in 1992 for ""The Crying Game.""  Here, he's a sympathetic guy, but he's not who I pictured as the attractive man that peaks Marilyn's interest and almost makes her cross the line away from her husband from which there'd be no turning back.

Maria Doyle Kennedy played the best friend Rosemary.  The screenplay does not embellish that she is the successful businesswoman.  Kennedy worked with Jon Voight in the 1998 film ""The General.""  Here, she does a nice job at the end, but really isn't eye-shatteringly lovely enough to make all the other girls jealous.  She has a hard edge to her face with an unflattering hair style that was totally wrong for the part.  Her eye makeup in the restaurant scene looked like Yvonne DeCarlo in ""The Munsters.""  This critical role was so mishandled that it's hard for the story to really have the emotional impact it needs to work.

Heike Makatsch as the Danny's pregnant girlfriend Bernadette could have phoned in her performance.  Sara Bolger as Annie and Jean-Marc Barr as Andy turn in nice performances.  Brenda Fricker who won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for ""My Left Foot"" in 1989 does a good job as Mona, the boss' wife who salvages the Tara Road real estate company.

I very much enjoyed seeing the cultures of Dublin and New England.  The story was interesting much in the way you wonder how a puzzle will come together.  As a film, this was emotionally chilly, but still worth viewing.  Enjoy!",1197936000,2,4571,5.29126213592233
2831107,3,B000Q677CC,"When they define the term ""chick flick"" in future dictionaries, Tara Road will likely be cited as a perfect example of the genre.

The film, starring Andie McDowell, is well done. As usual McDowell turns in a workmanlike performance as Marilyn, whose son dies in a motorcycle accident, in front of friends and family, during his birthday celebration. She becomes depressed and blames her husband for their son's death.

Olivia Williams also turns in a fine performance as Ria,  Irish housewife whose husband is cheating on her. These two clearly have communication problems; in the beginning of the movie, she tells him she wants to have another child; he in turn tells her he has been having an affair.

So what happens? The two women  hook up by phone a decide, in about two minutes, to switch residences and rebuild their lives. Marilyn  acclimates herself to the Irish countryside, and Ria moves to Connecticut, loosens up and meets Marilyn's sassy friends.

The film is very formulaic. I did not read the book but some of the dialogue is sophmoric and I was surprised the actors were able to deliver their lines with a straight face. If you have some time to kill, and it's raining outside, go ahead and watch it. Otherwise, read the book. You'll probably find it more entertaining.",1195084800,6,1287,4.796380090497737
2831108,4,B000Q677CC,"It is a fascinating plot, well executed, with excellent character acting, well worth a watching.

The plot is about two hurting women. The first lost her son in a motorcycle accident on his birthday, on the motorcycle his father gave them.
The second has just found out that her husband's girlfriend is pregnant and he is leaving the wife for the girlfriend.
both women hope that a change of scenery offers a chance to fix what ails them. so they exchange houses for the summer.

What happens with each reflects partly the conditions, partly each woman's desire to heal and be whole again. The Dublin house is on Tara Road, it is the center of a large family with lots of social connections. The New England house is private, not surrounded by neighbors but isolated from all but 2 or 3. In a believable and understandable way, each woman adapts to her new surroundings, adopts the others house along with all of the other woman's attachments and begin to fix what ails them.

It is cute without being maudlin, you cheer for each, sharing their pain and hopes for a better life. You grimace when she takes the stupid husband back into her bed one last time, you love it when she tosses the vases and the bust at him. It is a tear jerker of a movie, with about equal amounts of tears and cheers, an upbeat ending where the bad guys suffer at the hands of their long suffering wives. All in all a decent movie.",1194048000,21,1408,4.449612403100775

Perhaps I would have enjoyed the film more if I had read the book.  At any rate, I felt that  Tara Road was a bit of a slow starter, and some of the performances fell flat for me (in particular, Andie McDowell), with the exception of Stephen Rea.  The DVD has only one extra -- an interview with Maeve Binchy herself, which I found superfluous, as Binchy summarizes the plot and I had just watched the film.

If you're looking for a good chick flick, Tara Road might fit the bill for you.  It was not, however, my cup of tea.",1193961600,5,1098,5.89873417721519

For the most part, the movie was believable and I really cared for the characters involved.  The acting was spot on and the actors involved give a stunning performance.  Though it is not usually a highlight of mine, but the camera work was fantastic with all of the scenic shots of New England and Ireland.  It was just beautiful.  The pace of the movie was pretty good as well in that it wasn't going to fast but it kept the story rolling fast enough that it wasn't putting me to sleep either.  The right balance was maintained for this movie from beginning to end.  All in all, the movie was entertaining.

My only negative comment on this movie was how I felt after watching this movie.  Instead of feeling inspired or enlightened I felt depressed instead.

Despite the fine acting, this movie is definitely a chick flick so if you are into that type of thing then this is a movie you need to rush out and pick up.",1193097600,6,1090,4.373134328358209
2831121,3,B000Q677CC,"Quickly, I'll get the DVD features out of the way - there are next to none, at least on the advanced copy. The special features have some previews and an interview with Maeve Binchy - that's it. There are subtitles for closed captioning and Spanish, but no other audio choices - no Dolby choices or DTS.

I have to go on also by saying that I'm not a big Andie MacDowell fan. She always seems a little stilted and plastic to me - this movie is no exception. There's just so rarely any emotion in her face, and it's disconcerting for me. Maeve Binchy's novels are generally OK for me, but she's also not my favorite author, so that may have something to do with it. Olivia Williams as Ria, however, is neatly luminous and a high point for the movie.

The beginning of the movie is pretty slow. I understand that we need to know why there's a house exchange, but... Much of the set up just seems somewhat unnecessary. I am a reader and nearly always prefer books to movies - I feel that this slow set-up would have been fine in the book, but movies by necessity have to go faster or they'll end up boring.

I just can't help but feel that this was not a book that should have been made into a movie. The cast is good enough, my dislike of Andie aside, it's probably a lovely romantic novel - in fact I have several friends who've told me how much they loved the book - but there's just not enough action to warrant a film. I would say that it reminds me somewhat of ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" - another fine book that didn't translate well to the big screen. However, if you enjoyed that movie, well, this one might be right up your alley.",1192752000,5,1633,4.227564102564102
2831122,2,B000Q677CC,"""Tara Road"" is a mildly enjoyable, ""TV chick flick"" sort of movie. You know the story by now--two women going through emotional turmoil exchange houses and end up changing their lives, in both cases for the better. But for some excellent acting, I would have given this film one star. I've always liked Andie McDowell's classic but unconventional looks; no longer rail-thin and with a few wrinkles, I thought she was quite good here. There's a scene where she literally howls her grief by the side of the pool where her son died that was very powerful, as is the scene when she describes that death for the first time to others. I also liked Iain Glen as Ria's husband--a nice enough seeming guy at the outset, his character becomes sleazier by the minute, and his looks and manner reflect it. But the plot is weak, and the supporting actors don't ring true--Ria's Irish neighbors are stereotypes, and Marilyn's crazy friends are improbable for such a buttoned-up sort of woman. And the ending is a deus-ex-machina wave of the wand--a minor character comes out of the woodwork to solve all. Life isn't so simple, and if we could transform our lives by changing houses for a few months, we'd all be doing it regularly. This was a good movie for me to watch when I was too tired to concentrate on anything serious, but I'm glad I didn't ask my husband to join me!",1192665600,3,1361,4.581967213114754
2831123,3,B000Q677CC,"I actually read the book of Tara Road so I'll be ranking this movie in three ways-qualities as a move, faithfulness to the book plot and storyline and appeal.

On the first-this isn't a bad movie. It has good acting, a lovely soundtrack and a nice story. Two women, one who has just lost her teenage son, the other whose husband just left her for his pregnant mistress, switch houses in New England and Ireland to get away and do some healing. If it sounds like a chick flick that's because it is one. But it isn't bad as chick flicks go.

This is actually surprisingly faithful to the storyline of the book ""Tara Road"", even though t only covers the last third of the book. The details are right on and some of the lines were strait out of the book. Minor things had been changed (like hair color, type of death, some stuff about the Irish mistress) but the overall theme is the same as in the book. Fans of the book will most likely like the movie.

So-is this a movie I would watch on my own? Well, I wouldn't go see it in a theater but being as I read the book I might have rented it or watched on TV. If you're a die hard Maeve Binchy fan like my mom then you should watch it. If you like lifetime movies (yes they're bad, but so chick flickish that sometimes you can't resist) then you'll like it. And I really liked the soundtrack.

  This is what I would call a small, but intriguing, little film, not likely to change your life in large ways but one that shows the ripple effect of chance meetings on people's lives as well as how they cope. I found it  had some flaws with plot structure and plausability in some parts but still was entertained and it held my interest.

A few of the sets in NY at the end look staged, but overall getting a look a Dublin and watching the always affable and effective Stephen Rea work his charms make this a nice little rainy day cuddle up on the couch with the wife movie.  Not as maudllin or morose as it may appear at first this is actually a bit uplifting and life affirming.  The Holiday without the goofy, ungrounded and forced humour.

True, the script leaves much to be desired, but Andie McDowell and the rest of the cast does an excellent job of resurrecting the emotions of the characters. I can't say much about the story - a mother in Connecticut loses her child in a motorcycle accident (on the day of his 15th birthday and right in front of her eyes), while another mother in Ireland gets the cold shoulder from her husband of over 10 years. Each of them is looking for something new in her life and so they connect and swap houses (this reminds me of the movie 'The Holiday').
The movie waivers between sad and comic as it progresses through the experiences of each mother's new experiences with culture, emotional transformations and eventually leads to the average Hollywood's SWEET'N SOUR ending where each discovers herself in her own way.

An okay-movie to spend a weeknight, but not good enough for much more than that.

Two women from across the pond who have never met each other somehow come part of each others lives.  Andie MacDowell and Olivia Williams star as the two main characters who touch each others lives.

The film does not try to be something it is not; it is a story about two women at a crossroads in their separate lives and how friendship can move them past tragedies in their lives.

The two lead characters are interesting in that you have an American lady who has closed herself off from everyone who wants to help her after the death of her son.  We also have an Irish lady (Ria) who after finding out about her husband's infidelity looks to friends and family for support, only to find they blame her for his affairs (or at least that is how she feels). By switching lives for short period of time they both hope they can find the answers they need.

The story is entertaining and I enjoyed the performances by most of the supporting actors.  Unfortunately I did not enjoy the performances of the leading actors; Andie McDowell and Olivia Williams.  Andie's performance just did not seem to fit this character.  There were moments when her character would look into the camera and you would expect her to convey the emotion of the moment, but it was not there.

I think part of the problem may have been with the directing or the storytelling.  Their seemed to be pieces missing, especially in Ria's life in America.  I have not read the book so if there are parts of the story missing they were lost in the movie.

Neither of the lead women seemed to capture the tragedies that happened in their lives, they just seemed odd.  I see this movie mainly appealing to those who like romantic comedies.  If you do, or you are an Andie McDowell fan, then you will enjoy this movie.",1192147200,3,1817,4.3982035928143715
2831129,3,B000Q677CC,"Tara Road, based on the Maeve Binchy novel of the same name, follows the parallel lives of two women, one Irish and one American, as they come to terms with loss.  American Marilyn (Andi McDowell) has lost her beloved fifteen year old son to a motorcycle accident, and the all-consuming grief of it drives her from her husband.  Irish Ria (Olivia Williams) faces the devastating news that her husband is leaving her for his pregnant girlfriend despite the family and household he and Ria have built.  When a spontaneous phone call results in a house swap, the two women temporarily slip into the life the other has left behind.

The film unfolds in scenes alternating with the same themes, starting with the two birthday parties that each end in loss.  The duality of these scenes works well since the characters and their circumstances are different enough to hold viewer interest and each moves the plot along.  Andi McDowell puts in a competent, if at times overly pinched, performance, while Olivia Williams is radiant and convincing as the transforming Ria.  Stephen Rea stands out in the supporting cast as the charming, sensitive Colm who helps out Ria by planting a garden in her absence and who gives Marilyn the undemanding support she needs.

For the first eighty or so minutes, I was surprised by how much I liked this film, with its Irish and New England scenery, telling camera shots, and solid acting.  The drama had none of the syrupy feel-good moments that often accompanies this kind of film, and instead developed gentle moments that nudged the plot forward.  Unfortunately, the end, with its inexcusable deus ex machina, throws all the good out with an improbable--and yes, saccharine--resolution.

The DVD has only one special feature, an interview with Maeve Binchy, the author of the novel from which the screenplay was adapted.  Binchy starts off with an involved plot summary even though the viewer most likely has just finished watching it.  Even her account of how the idea came to her is mundane.  She offers no insight, no illumination, nothing that adds to the viewer's appreciation of the story.  I know DVDs are expected to offer more than just the film, but in non-special effect, simple dramas such as Tara Road, there is no point.

2831141,3,B000Q677CC,"TARA ROAD is a thickly populated movie that reaches for the female audience and succeeds in addressing old problems of infidelity and marriage conflicts.  The problem is the story by highly published Irish author Maeve Binchy (adapted from Binchy's novel for the screen by Cynthia Cidre) is 'used goods' and while there are many moments of touching dialog there are equal moments of sham resolutions that in the end prove disappointing despite the cast of actors portraying these only occasionally interesting characters.

Two women, each bruised by life events, trade homes (Dublin, Ireland and Connecticut) to find the space to recover. In Connecticut, Marilyn (Andie MacDowell) is recovering from the accidental motorcycle (a birthday gift from his father Greg - August Zirner) death of her young son: grief has made her withdraw and lose her feelings for Greg.  In Dublin, Ireland Ria (Olivia Williams) is blissfully happy in her beautiful home on Tara Road  which she shares with her two children and her newly discovered unfaithful husband Danny (Iain Glen) - a lothario who has had affairs with Ria's best friend Rosemary (Maria Doyle Kennedy) and now confesses to the pregnancy of his current mistress Bernadette (Heike Makatsch).  In too quick an instance Ria and Marilyn decide to swap homes with the hope that separation form their families will give them room to readjust to life. Each woman encounters the friends and neighbors of the other: Marilyn meets restaurateur Colm (Stephen Rea) among Ria's odd assortment of acquaintances while Ria encounters the brother of Greg and some intrusive and over the top friends of Marilyn.  Gradually it all comes to a very predictable conclusion that simply solves too many problems too easily.

Director Gillies MacKinnon seems to have difficulty deciding how to maintain a tone for the film - a tearjerker versus a situation comedy. There are moments when the audience connects with some of the characters, but these are too few and separated by far too many stretches of weak writing.

2831143,3,B000Q677CC,"Having been a long-time fan of Maeve Binchy's works, I was pleasantly surprised to see Tara Road made into a movie. For those fans of Binchy's detailed plot and in-depth storytelling, you'll be disappointed for the movie [with its inherent time constraints] is not altogether cohesive in telling the story , but it does a fine job of entertaining nonetheless, thanks in large part to the strong cast.

The story examines the lives of two women - American Marilyn Vine [the stunning Andie Macdowell] who is grieving over the tragic loss of her 15-year-old son in a motorcycle accident at home [on his birthday]. Marilyn is unable to come to terms with her loss and feels a desperate need to get away. Then there is Irish Ria Lynch [Olivia Williams] who seems to have a wonderful family, but is shattered when her husband Danny [Iain Glen] reveals that he is leaving her for his pregnant mistress Bernadette.

The two women connect over an inadvertent phone call and decide to swap homes for two months, and during the course of this time, they learn to come to terms with their circumstances. But Tara Road is not merely about coming to terms - there are so many sub-plots involving the other characters in the story, such as Colm, the gentle restaurant owner who tries to help Marilyn whilst she is in Dublin. Ria's best friend, who seems genuine and sincere, but is she really, and a whole host of other characters.

Though the book was a tightly-woven plot that explored the various characters in detail, the movie fails to deliver in that aspect. Don't get me wrong, it is interesting enough, and makes for a pleasant afternoon viewing - but, it does not give us tremendous insight into the main characters, perhaps with the exception of Marilyn Vine [in part due to Andie Macdowell's acting skills]...even Ria's wronged wife doesn't elicit that much sympathy, in part because of her forgiving nature towards her cad of a husband for most of the movie.

To be fair, the novel was quite intricate and that takes a lot of work to translate onto the big screen. All in all though, I would suggest reading the novel to enhance one's enjoyment of the movie, and to discover more about some of the minor characters, and how they all interconnect in the story.",1191888000,3,2256,4.6893939393939394
2831144,3,B000Q677CC,"Tara Road is very much a chick flick. Themes are facing reality, empowerment, surviving tragedy and heartbreak, and moving forward with courage and hope. There are some very nice moments in the film; unfortunately, they are countered by equally lackluster scenes. Moreover, the secondary characters still almost every scene they're in. They may be the best part of the movie, other than the payback scene.

I always want to like movies with Andie MacDowell, but in this case, she shines only when she gets takes a stand for her new Irish gal pal. For the rest of the movie, she's sad, dull, and rarely interacts with the other characters. She and her movie husband have the thankless task of portraying boring people. And there is NO chemistry between her and a would-be Irish suitor.

The other female lead, Rea played by Brenda Fricker, while alarmingly naive, is a much more endearing character. Her healing moments, as well as her painful ones, come across as much more genuine than do MacDowell's. I found myself sometimes chiding her penchant for trusting the wrong people, but also cheering her recovery. With Andie, I just wanted to move on--yes, a horrible situation, but she left me cold most of the time.

The film also suffered from some unrealistic situations, or unrealistic to me, at least. Andie's husband, an English teacher, spent two months in Hawaii? For what? How? Ireland is deep into fall (with most characters wearing short sleeves outside) while Connecticut is still having summer weather. Connecticut? Not an autumn leaf in sight? This lack of attention to detail can possibly be overlooked, but when added to an uneven script and characterization, it's a noticeable nuisance.

Again, the movie isn't terrible and has some scenes that are quite good. They're just too far apart to avoid mediocrity. If you're in the mood for this type of movie, go ahead. Just don't expect a fabulous movie. Generally, I though Under the Tuscan Sun, while playing on different themes, was a better movie.",1191801600,2,2013,4.946745562130178

Each woman is dealing with recent terrible, life-changing events.  One has just lost a son.  The other has just learned her husband has been having an affair and that their marriage is over.

I was afraid Tara Road would be depressing and melancholy.  Instead, I found it to be warm, engaging, and even sometimes amusing.  Yes, the two women deal with grief, but not so much that it drags down the movie or the viewer's mood.  I felt for these women and cared about them very much.  The acting of the leads is spot-on and superb.  The supporting characters were everything from sweet to creepy to hilarious -- rich, detailed individuals.

Tara Road rated PG, but I think it's safe for older children.  The plot deals with talk of affairs and death, but there is nothing graphic to be found.

If you're looking for a character-driven, slightly-sentimental movie to watch with your friend, sister, daughter, or mom, this would be a fine choice.",1191628800,2,1055,4.673913043478261
2831146,4,B000Q677CC,"While there are a few problems with this film, Tara Road is a good depiction of two women recovering from unfair, painful experiences.  Marilyn (Andie McDowell) is an American mother who lost her son to a motorbike accident on his fifteenth birthday.  Meanwhile in Ireland, Ria (Olivia Williams) has just been left by her husband for his pregnant mistress.  Andie McDowell does a terrific job as Marilyn is not an easy character.  Realistically, Marilyn seeks solitude and she's less than friendly to Ria's friends and neighbors when she switches houses with Ria.  McDowell manages to make Marilyn winning anyway and shows her transformation in a nuanced performance. The rest of the cast also did a fine job.

What's a bit off about this story is the unrealistic extent to which Marilyn and Ria exchange lives instead of just homes.  Of course, there wouldn't be much of a plot if this didn't occur, but it still rings a bit false that neighbors take up with the women immediately.  There are two occasions where the Irish treat Marilyn as sort of a rare bird because she's American.  However, this takes place in Dublin where in reality visiting Americans aren't exactly scarce.  Furthermore, the movie doesn't shy away from stereotypes as every Irish male in the film is presented as being lecherous, and the two minor gay characters are somewhat flamboyant.  One other odd point is that a minor, undeveloped character who hardly shows up until near the end of the film turns out to be pivotal when it comes time to resolve the major conflict.

So while I didn't feel this movie was perfect, there are moments, particularly when Ria's rotten husband, Danny, (played by Iain Glen) was on the screen that I felt very caught up in the story.  Overall, a satisfying experience.  (Note to Americans who have trouble understanding Irish accents:  They aren't at all a problem in this film.)",1191283200,,1887,4.853125

While in Dublin, Ireland, Ria Lynch (Olivia Williams) experiences infidelity; her husband, Danny (Lain Glen), admits to her to having an affair with Bernadette (Heike Makatsch), a woman who is pregnant with his child.  One evening Marilyn makes arrangements with Ria to swap homes, and their journey begins.

The movie moves quickly, but shows viewers how both women slowly overcome their grief.  The women are not alone, and in the process, they do not live paralyzing lives.  The interesting aspect about the film is that none of the women revealed why they felt the need to swap homes.  However, it is only when Marilyn and Ria spend time with both of the women's respective family and friends, that they slowly discover the truth of their circumstance.  Ria gets a job as a cook at the local bakery, and Marilyn befriends Colm (Stephen Rae), Ria's neighbor, works in the garden, and finally opens up to Ria's children and talks about her son's death.

TARA ROAD is filled with a mix of emotions.  There are subtle scenes of drama as well as humor, which may be similar to a ""Terms of Endearment"" type of film without the melodrama.  It is an inspirational and uplifting film where the characters overcome their obstacles and move forward with their lives.",1191283200,,1556,4.80827067669173

THE STORY:

The movie is based on the novel by Irish author Maeve Binchy by the same title ""Tara Road"" back in 2000.  It tells the story of two women, Marilyn Vine, an American played by Andie MacDowell, and Ria Lynch, and Irish played by Olivia Williams, whose lives cross paths as they seek answers in their own tragic events.

Marilyn's life is almost perfect and almost picturesque in a wonderful Connecticut, New England home with a loving husband.  Their relationship falls apart as their son dies in a motorcycle accident caused by his best friend as they are all celebrating his 15th birthday in their backyard.

In the meantime Ria's home at 16 Tara Road is falling apart as her husband has announced that he is leaving what she thought was a peaceful home with their two kids together as he is expecting a baby with another woman.

As Marilyn struggles to cope with her emotions she makes a haste decision of telling her husband, Greg, that she can't love him the same way.  Greg goes on alone in his trip to Hawaii, while Marilyn shuffles of things to do, she finds the business card of Ria's cheating husband, Danny Lynch - a property consultant - which her husband met years ago in Ireland.  Thru that chance phone call they agree to swap houses for the Summer.

As each of the two women were expecting to find solace in a foreign place, they instead find the help and more importantly the inner strength they needed to survive their own tragedies as they interact with the characters they meet along the way.

In the end, the truth comes out as everyone faces each other as the good people get their way and the others get their Karma.

REVIEW:

The first 30 minutes is typical of a European film - slow as it establishes not only the characters, but the two settings as their homes become a character in itself.  Once you get used to the pace of the story, your mind will settle and you will become involved in their lives.

The whole story is like a small roller coaster ride.  There are ups and downs along the way until the end.  There are no major dips that are too heavy to handle apart from the set-up.  And there are delights in humour as the quirky supporting characters lend themselves to giving shape in the women's lives.

If I have to find fault in the movie (not the novel) is that there are a too many characters who come in and out and not everyone of them is essential in resolving the 100 minute running time and just leave themselves as loose ends.  While the squable at the table near the end of the movie may be a little bit silly for my taste.

THE DVD:

The transfer from film to DVD is beautiful and almost perfect.  I was trying to find compression artifacts, but it's even better than transfers done by other big budget movies.

There is only the movie and a single special feature of the interview of novelist Maeve Binchy.  The interview is obviously a treat to Irish folks who recognize her fame (she and her husband has a cameo at the restaurant scene - they are the couple sitting at the bar as Marilyn and Rosemary enter).  However, I would love to see more special features such as cast interview, director commentary, ""making of the movie"" featurette and even blooper reels which will be a real treat in light of the dramatic story.

Because of this, the price may be steep.  But I hope this will not discourage the others in wanting to find a wonderful story and movie such as this.",1191110400,,3650,4.3898809523809526
2831149,3,B000Q677CC,"Tara Road is a perfectly pleasant movie.  Nothing bad, nothing great.  When I see a movie at a theater I always put it in one of two categories - will I buy it or won't I.  I wouldn't consider this a keeper.  I'm satisfied seeing it once.  The acting was all great.  The scenery, both in Ireland and the US, was beautiful.  The characters were believable enough.  Some parts were sad to watch, both the death of Marilyn's son and the shameless philandering of Ria's husband, Danny.  But overall it is an uplifting movie about how both women are able to move on with their lives.
It is rated PG because there's nothing too risque in the movie, but the subject matter of the cheating husband is rather mature.  This would make a great movie for Lifetime or WE.  Overall, I guess I would recommend it to someone who likes a nice chick flick.",1191024000,,838,4.376623376623376
8194309,3,B000Q677CC,"It is somewhat a depressing film at times. Andie MacDowell and Olivia Williams play Marilyn Vine and Ria, respectively. Marilyn Vine suffers a tragic loss when her son died on his fifteenth birthday in a bizarre accident in Connecticut. It is shown in the first five minutes of the movie. Ria learns her husband is having an affair with her best friend. Both women connect by chance on the telephone. They decide to swap their homes and lives as well without the husbands. Marilyn's marriage has fallen apart as well. Their friends help them cope in their new environments.

Ruby Wax OBE played eccentric Carlotta, Marilyn's friend and neighbor, in their Connecticut suburb. Stephen Rea and Brenda Fricker help Marilyn in Ireland. The DVD comes with a fifteen minute interview with the author, Maeve Binchy, who has a cameo. This film is more for the Hallmark and Lifetime film channels where it would gave an appreciative audiences. I am a fan of Ruby Wax so I wanted to see it. Other than Ruby's performance, the film was satisfactory and adequate.

What bothered me is that they substituted Cape Town, South Africa for Connecticut. I wished they actually filmed the Connecticut scenes in the states especially Connecticut itself. There were unfamiliar faces in the film as well. They also shot the Ireland scenes in Ireland. Maeve Binchy has become one of Ireland's most celebrated novelists and rightfully so. I was happy that the interview included her cameo in the film as a restaurant patron. She comes across quite lovely and warm in the interview as well. She talked about Oprah Winfrey when she chose her novel as Book of the Month Club.",1516233600,,1647,4.857651245551601

8194314,3,B000Q677CC,"It had very good actors. The movie is apparently based on a book by the same author as Circle of Friends, which I loved.

I didn't love this so much. It's cute but I not only didn't find the story believable, and it used a lot of cliches, not I found it heavy handed as a morality tale about retribution.

Life doesn't happen this way. It stretches credulity in my view. So I had trouble enjoying it as I'd hoped to do. It's okay but not a favorite.",1469145600,,449,4.090909090909091

Instead it begins when the lives of two women are falling apart for different reasons. I have been a great fan of Maeve Binchy's books and I think that the Tara Road movie captures nicely the flavor of her stories. She was a great story teller and I would probably really enjoy movie versions of some of her other works.",1448064000,,456,4.252873563218391
