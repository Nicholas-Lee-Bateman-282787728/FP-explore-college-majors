This movie tells a story about criminals and their fate. Those who commit crimes suffer their deserved fate. Its like a sociological study of urban life, the obverse of the Westerns that were popular then. Notice the wet streets and sidewalks at night? That was done for the photographic effects. The description of Martin as someone who uses people and then discards them suggests a psychopathic personality.",1508198400,,2884,4.466793168880455
