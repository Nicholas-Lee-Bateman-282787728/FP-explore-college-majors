1353702,3,B00004U28P,"Fairly decent adaptation of the classic Greek saga, ""Jason"" tries to find an even balance between special effects,  dialogue and pacing - and succeeds for the most part. The CGI FX are actually impressive  to a degree as the winged Harpies look very menacing. With the inclusion of  an African and a women, the sailors of the Argo reflect todays Politically  Correct environment, not the actual historical world of Greece (I'm  surprised they didn't include a Hispanic, Asian and Homosexual). Anyway,  director Nick Willing (""Alice in  Wonderland"") and writers  Matthew Faulk and Mark Skeet establish the journey's  purpose very  quikly, never allowing subplots to interfere with the quest.
  And  the voyage itself is exquisite. From rich Turkish locations, fertile  landscapes and  crystal bodies of water to elegant sets at London's  Shepperton Studios, ""Jason""  takes nothing but lush routes  and vibrant paths. As the  maniacal monarch with an evil past,  Hopper is electric; MacFadyen and Williams  are naughty as the gods  who display ulterior motives; and the rest of the  supporting  players, especially Thompson, shine. Jason London is  tough and  handsome, but he often seems out of his league, sparring with vet  thesps like Jacobi and Cirian Hinds. Still, his boyish charm goes a long  way in  establishing sympathy for a motivated ruler-to-be.
All in  all a pretty decent film for Television.",966816000,6,1406,5.230769230769231
1353703,2,B00004U28P,"I've always loved sword-and-sandal flicks, so last night I rented a copy of Jason and the Argonauts hoping for some mythological mayhem.  What I  ended up with was a poorly-paced and tedious bowdlerized waste of video.  The acting is terrible.  The worst of all is Dennis Hopper's role as  Pelias.  Sometimes, acting is so bad it's funny.  In Dennis Hopper's case,  the acting is so bad it is not funny at all--it's just plain awful.  I  think he could have done a better job if he'd been reading lines off a  teleprompter.
Another problem I have is with the casting for the part of  Jason, played by Jason London.  He is referred to as having a handsome face  and being a hero throughout the movie, but this is a case of wishful  thinking.  Although Jason London is not an ugly man, he is decidedly plain.  And his appearance certainly doesn't inspire paeans of heroism, either.  He's rather spindly, and, to top it all off, he sports a mullet!
The  bowdlerization is quite annoying.  Someone castrated a perfectly-good tale  for the sake of a PG-rating.  Where is the blood, gore, and sexual tension  of the original story?  It's certainly not in this waste of a miniseries.  According to legend, Medea is a frightening, cold-blooded, black witch.  Although she does fall in love with Jason, her love is marred by obsession  and cruelty.  In order to help Jason make his grand escape from Colchis,  she slows down her father's pursuit by murdering her brother (still a child  in the myth, and not the hale and hearty admiral of the video), rending him  into small pieces, and throwing the bits overboard from the Argo.  The  father, in his grief, slows his fleet to gather up the body parts of his  beloved son.  In the movie, Medea is portrayed as selfless and good, hardly  the sort of woman she ended up being in legend when she tortures the  philandering Jason's new wife and father-in-law to death and murders her  own children.
Another problem is the treatment of Hercules.  Although I  almost smiled at his braggadocio regarding the twelve tasks he had earlier  completed, the joke soon became old.  What is lacking are his prodigious  amorous achievements.  This is hinted at chastely in the matriarchy of  Lemnos when he sits in a pool surrounded by a bevy of gorgeous women, but  the real reason he disappeared from the Argonauts isn't even hinted at:  the handsome young Argonaut Hylas went missing at Cios.  Hercules was  passionately in love with this boy, and chose to stay behind to find him.  I don't know why the Lemnians are portrayed so negatively.  According to  legend, the Argonauts stayed there for a year and had a whole nursery-load  of children with these women.  There are plenty of scary adventures in the  mythos which aren't even touched on.  I guess this scene of Amazons, er,  Lemnians, is included for titillation.
The only thing that saves this  movie from being an utter disaster are some of the special effects.  The  harpies of King Phineus are imaginatively done, if more bloodthirsty than  legend has it. Instead of killing whoever eats, they instead stole the food  and defecated on what was left.  I guess this is just a little too  scatological for modern-day audiences.  Ah well.  As I was saying, the  harpies are wonderfully-done and are formidable enemies.  Similarly, the  taming of the fire-breathing bull (only one, opposed to the two in legend),  is done rather well.  It's too bad the rest of the movie doesn't measure up  to these fine scenes.",966556800,11,3497,4.729096989966555
1353704,3,B00004U28P,I didn't enjoy this remake of the original film; I felt it lacked the pure fantasy of Ray Harryhausen's magical touch and the haunting musical score by the brilliant Bernard Herrmann.  What were they thinking?,963878400,3,209,4.9714285714285715
1353705,4,B00004U28P,"This is the newly revised NBC miniseries now being released onto DVD.
With improved visual effects and more details into the actual storyline.
The story tells of Jason and his band of heroes on their quest  to find the Golden Fleece.
The monsters and deities were reconstucted  using CG imagery and even though posidon wasn't your expected trident  weilding god, the story still holds.

1353737,5,B00004U28P,"First off, I want to point out my 5 star rating is strictly for Merlin alone. I'd been trying to find Merlin for such a long time on DVD because my old copy I record on VHS when the movie first aired on TV was worn down and badly in need of replacing. I'm glad I found it finally and it was well worth the money. I had such a great time watching the movie again after all these years. While the effects are kind of corny now, the story is still amazing and the actors did such a good job in their parts.

I had never seen the Jason and the Argonauts one (although I do know the story). I watched it also and was pretty disappointed with it. If I had to rate it all on it's own I'd give it probably only a 2-3 star rating. The main actor looked stoned or something for the full 3 hours and the overall acting and dialog just didn't feel right. I felt myself getting pretty bored watching this one. So, like I said, my rating of 5 stars is strictly for Merlin and it was the only reason I bought this DVD set.",1438387200,7,1007,3.9362745098039214

1353773,4,B00004U28P,"Jason & The Argonauts is a great piece of historical fiction that should be shared. There are many (any?) movies out there that tell this story so I was glad to be able to share it with some kids who recently got turned on to Classical mythology through the Percy Jackson movies. It paints Jason as a purely good guy and ignores the Medea tragedy. I think it makes a better story to leave that in. It's still an enjoyable, rated G show though. It looks a bit dated, but is still delightful. The acting is tv acting (meaning a bit over the top). Jason is the weakest link, but even with that it's still entertaining.

Merlin also has a dated, made-for-tv look about it. It has a stellar cast and a lot better acting than Jason, but still a bit over the top. The story includes many of the elements of legend so I think fans of King Arthur, the Knights of the Round Table, and Camelot will be pleased. It's rated G and suitable for kids.

1353789,3,B00004U28P,"Jason and the Argonauts had everything going for it- great special effects, terrific production team (Many Of Whom Had Worked On The Odyssey), an experienced director, a solid supporting cast, a beautiful damsel and a locations that were breathtaking. Unfortunately what it did not have- where it fell flat- was that it did not have a true lead actor. Had Jason London been able to carry the weight of the character, this would have been a Four or Five Star movie. Unfortunately due to this major flaw, I cannot give the production more than Three Stars. To do so would be to insult The Odyssey, which had Armand Assante, an actor with the experience and precision to carry the weight of a big budget production on his back (See My Four Star Review For That Great Mini-Series).

This review is for the show I taped from television in 2000. I do not claim to know what the DVD contains. Are there deleted scenes and/or extras that might add a Half Star to my rating? I do not know. When I get around to seeing the DVD I shall comment on its pros and cons.

As far as Jason's crew: They were an elite bunch! Although not soldiers themselves, they came together and jelled at the right time. I liked that they were cosmopolitan group. Orpheus was supposed to represent a black African who had contact with the Greeks perhaps from Axum and/or Meroe (Although According To Ancient Greek Sources He Was Of Thracian Descent). The others were from Turkey and Italy and Greece & Greek Islands. They were sheperds and stonemasons, farmers and archers. I liked this crew more than I did the so-called ""professional"" crew of Odysseus. Odysseus's men seemed to be a more selfish and ignorant lot than Jason's crew, whoose loyalty and devoition to him only grew and grew. I liked Argos and Hercules the most--followed by Orpheus, played wonderfully by Adrian Lester.

The CGI effects were quite impressive to me. For television they were quite spectacular. As I've said before, if only they had gotten a better lead. Brendan Fraser would have been perfect for the role; at that time he would have been the right age.

I give this a marginal recommendation if only because I so love Greek Mythology. I next plan to buy Clash of the Titans-- the original and the remake.

1353797,3,B00004U28P,"A legendary tale of great heroics, Jason and the Argonauts is the story of one man's journey to find the legendary golden fleece that will grant its owner anything his heart desires. It is an adventure, a romance, and authentic mythology from beginning to end.

After the kingdom is stormed and its ruler (Ciarn Hinds) slaughtered by his evil brother Pelias (Dennis Hopper), the heir to the throne, young Jason, is taken by a temple guard far from the city. Raised among the impoverished of his nation, with his true heritage kept a secret from those who would wish to destroy him, Jason (Jason London) soon wishes to discern the truth. He returns to the homeland of his fathers and on the way gives aid to a crippled old woman, who promises him that a great journey lies before him.

Little does Jason know that the old woman is the goddess Hera (Olivia Williams), who toys in the fates of men for pleasure. Jason's mother has long invoked Hera's name as a guardian over her son's fate and because of her loathing for Pelias, Hera has chosen Jason to succeed him to the throne. Her emotionally distant and mischievous husband Zeus becomes jealous of Hera's love for Jason and determines to make his trials difficult. Jason is captured and taken as a prisoner to the palace, where Pelias offers him his life in exchange for the theft of the golden fleece, a mystical object he has long sought. If Jason does not return in six months' time, his mother's life will be forfeit. Determined to persevere, he gathers together an intrepid group of sailors willing to take on a great adventure, among their ranks the legendary Hercules (Brian Thompson). Together they encounter many trials and dangers, from enraging the sea god to fighting demons, following a mythical star chart, and finally the epic battle with the fleece's keeper, a dragon.

The fleece is in the guardianship of King Aertes (Frank Langella), whose daughter is a sorceress chosen to protect its powers. Medea (Jolene Blalock) foresees the approach of Jason and predicts it will bring their downfall. Rather than setting out to sabotage him, with a little help from Hera and the god of love, Medea will compel him to succeed. The result is a tale that is well transcribed to the screen and beautifully filmed. A story that has enraptured audiences for thousands of years is treated with decency, given strong dialogue and intriguing characters. While the gods wage war in the heavens, Jason forges forth with a gathering that become likable as time wears on. The thief who wishes to be reformed, but not quite enough to keep his hands off other people's property. The young woman who has always loved Jason but cannot seem to draw more than brotherly affection from him. Hercules, who never fails to amuse the audience by spouting off one of his legendary victories. ""And, as always,"" he says with a less than modest shrug, ""I saved the day!""

From evil princes to mythological creatures such as sprites, demons, dragons, and sirens, to an old blind prophet banished to endless hunger for displeasing the gods (a cameo by Derek Jacobi), the story is highly engaging and enjoyable. There are some production flaws. It's evident the filmmakers have never observed a bull ride. Their supposedly monstrous and terrifying supernatural bull appears to be hopping around the arena. Its animation is also shoddy, odd when you consider that they do a fantastic job with all the other elements, including the dragon and demons. There is some wooden acting involved, particularly on Jason's part.

Because of the violence, conflicting religious aspect, and implied sensuality, children should not be allowed to view this film, but for older audiences it's an amusing and creative interpretation of the classic myth.",1332374400,2,3766,4.878125
1353798,3,B00004U28P,"Better actors than I was expecting. I was surprised to see some of them there. Other reviews have covered it thoroughly enough. Horrendous if you are looking for accuracy to the original myths. Or cool CGI. The dragons' teeth soldiers/Jason were pretty bad. Clearly you had Jason ducking, jumping, etc. and these CGI animations drawn in around him as a reaction to him instead of vice-versa. Which is really sad since I am sure it ate into their budget and it ended up just not looking very good. The lizard non-hydra hydra was a bit more nicely done. Almost forgot the smashing rocks scene was kind of uneven (how far exactly are they from the end?). Nicely done CGI I thought, but the various perspectives in the scenes (focus on them rowing and the end is still far off and the rocks are now coming together) don't work out to them getting through there fast enough (and all of a sudden they are coming out).

A few things I enjoyed was Hercules as the 'uncle at get-togethers' relating tales of past exploits to anyone who will listen... and roll their eyes and shake their heads when he's not looking. The bull jumping fellow, as this was an actual sport (Minoan?) usu performed by children/teens I believe, was unexpected. There was a really nice twist in a squik scene implying Medea had a closer than usual relationship with her brother Aspyrtes. A few scenes had me going hmmm, like the god Poseidon coming up out of the water. That made me wonder if was a god, a zombie or a Titan.

The guy who played Jason (Jason London) can't act for toffee. He scarcely gave the impression that he was the fearless, decisive leader that one would have to be on such a quest. 'Born to reign' he said of himself. I don't think so. Mind you, he had a weak script to work with (I understand that some time back, the scriptwriters were demanding more money. They should have sacked them all).

The credits were also poorly done. The main actors were listed at the start, but their characters weren't named. Then, at the end, they don't name the entire cast; only the secondary actors and their roles.

I really prefer the older version, this was is way too long and boring.  The action is pretty lame as well.  The special effects are very ""SyFy"" channel, and that isn't a compliment.  The story itself doesn't really follow the original.  The pace of the original was much, much better.  Everything looks too clean.  The biggest foe of the first one was ""Talos"".  Which the men found on an island.  Hercules stole a giant gold pin he found in a treasure vault.  That caused ""Talos"" to come to life and attack them.  This one doesn't have ""Talos"".  The first one had Skeletons that came out of the ground to attack the men and there was a big battle.  This version, these ""Weeds"" with armor come out of the groupnd and fight with Jason.  They don't move from their root, so Jason could've ran away.  Instead, he ducked, rolled, and the plants killed themselves.  Very, very bad.

1353810,5,B00004U28P,"Although the 1963 film version of this greek myth was more tightly scripted (and with a stronger lead), bear in mind this one in question was a 2-part TV movie or ""mini-series"", so necessarily longer, but it filled its running time with solid story.  Originally, my expectations were low, but I ended up pleasantly surprised.

As this will inevitably draw comparisons to Harryhausen's version, let me start out by saying the FX in this, though computer graphics, was top-notch for the time, as good as the graphics in some major motion pictures.  These are definitely 2 levels above the rather featureless, robotic computer models as seen in the ""Hercules"" and ""Xena"" shows.  The Harpies in particular were well done, and overall the animation superior to that seen in the rather lackluster TV remake of ""Mysterious Island"" with Patrick Stewart.

Because of the longer running time than the original, this version has more story derived from the myth.  This gives the excellent cast room to shine and I feel the characterizations are what makes this movie.  Dennis Hopper was surprisingly good as Jason's evil uncle, Orpheus has his moment at the clashing rocks with his pet seagull, Hera is particularly beautiful and godlike, Hercules is well cast, Langella is regal and tragic as King of Colchis......its a pleasure to see a production like this give equal attention to story as to spectacle.

The musical score is passionate and humanistic but lacks the heroic majesty of Bernard Hermann's soundtrack from the 1963 version.  Some reviewers felt that the actor in the lead was flat as Jason.  Perhaps, but if you look at what this character is actually doing, you may find that the only way to bring Jason to life is to paint him as a scoundrel.  I mean, here's a guy who sailed to the end of the known world to steal a precious artifact from a people who welcomed him.  Anyone who knows the actual myth knows that it was actually Medea who repeatedly made Jason's successes possible.  It was Medea who hypnotized the serpent guarding the golden fleece so Jason could steal it, Medea who killed her own younger brother so Jason could escape while her father stopped to pick up the pieces of the body, Medea who tricked Jason's uncle's daughters into murdering their father.  And how does Jason repay all of this?  He dumps Medea for a younger woman. Jason ends his days badly as a result of this, but this is an ending Hollywood never wants to show.  It would be interesting to see a truly faithful version but face it, this guy isn't exactly a role-model, and even in the movie versions some of this comes through.

At any rate, this is a well-cast, spectacular remake that can be very entertaining as long as the viewer keeps an open mind and doesn't get hung up over it as being some kind of ""threat"" to the original.",1201219200,,2823,4.716904276985743

The effects in this version are outstanding. I really enjoyed the gods up in the clouds bickering and messing around with the lives of mortals. Exactly how they are portrayed in mythology.

I only happened across this movie when it was on SciFi channel, after Kull the Conqueror. If you really want to see the worst movie of the 20th century...check out Kull. Not even watchable. But when Jason and the Argonauts came on, I was immediately taken by the depth of the acting. I think the choice of Jason London was done on purpose...he obviously is portraying an ""innocent"", not established in any way as a man, and at the whim of the gods.

And I happen to believe that Baron Munchausen is one of the most glorious scifi/fantasy movies ever made (along with Dune), so I consider any comparisons a compliment to the new Argonauts.

1353820,3,B00004U28P,"When I saw this latest version of the story of Jason and his search for the fabled Golden Fleece was scheduled for broadcast on the Hallmark channel I was intrigued. Not only did the movie feature not one, but two of the most beautiful women in Hollywood today - Natasha (`Species') Henstridge and Jolene (`Enterprise') Blalock, but it also promised four hours of grand entertainment.

Why then was I, about an hour into it, looking wistfully over at my DVD collection and in particular the classic Harryhausen version of the tale and contemplating what could have been.

Essentially put, this new adaptation of the Greek legend is a dud. Not only is the lead actor wholly unconvincing throughout but the action is tired, the narrative too drawn out and the pace sluggish. It does not help either that Henstridge's part (although top billed) is essentially nothing more than an extended cameo and that Blalock is unrecognizable (after watching her in a scene it was only her voice that clued me in to it being her).

Also why is it that the set design and effects looked cheaper and less convincing than they did four decades earlier?

All in all this was a huge disappointment and something Hallmark should have done better. For an example of the channel getting these made-for-television features/mini-series right check out the simply superb and very entertaining `La Femme Musketeer.'",1101254400,14,1388,4.944206008583691

It jumps around from challenge to challenge almost as quickly as Baron von Munchausen...

It also seems to be intentionally doing some things differently from the tale that I remember.  Instead of a Hydra with multiple heads, we are given something more like a giant Iguana.  On the other hand, the bull was a very neat touch.

Jolene Blalock is as beautiful as ever, and Dennis Hopper is a great villian, even if he probably should have worn brown contact lenses to fit the ""Greek"" look better.

Overall it was a good movie, and left me wanting more even after the long showing, which is a good sign.

1353822,4,B00004U28P,"Let's forget the 1963 version and Ray Harryhausen's incomparable stop motion animation, and look at this Hallmark made for TV version on its own merits.  Handsomely filmed and epically proportioned, JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS is a rousing, sometimes outstanding, version of this classic Greek myth.  Nick Willing keeps the action moving fairly quickly, although at times it seems to outstay its welcome in terms of length.  A surplus of padded shots including the hull of the Argos traipsing through the waters.  Most of the special effects are very good:  I particularly liked having Zeus and Hera in the heavens; it was not only metaphorically neat, but it was visually beautiful as well.  Angus McFadyen as Zeus and Olivia Williams as Hera looked divine.  The special effect that was below par was the mechanical bull; it seemed not only anachronistically out of place, but it looked cheesy.  Also, the skeletons were nowhere near as frightening as those in Harryhausen's version (oops, I slipped and made a comparison!).  The others, however, particularly the Harpies and Poseidon were ingenuous.

Brian Thompson's Hercules was the best performance; he seemed not only gigantically strong, but his bragging about his historic seven deeds was a nice addition.  Dennis Hopper was basically boring as the evil king, and Frank Langella wasn't strong enough either.  Natasha Henstridge's bit as the Amazon queen was fetching.  The main problem with the cast was Jason London, who did not have the maturity or strength to carry the role.  He seemed like a weak leader, one I would have been remiss to follow.  London just doesn't have the chops to play such an integral role.

Overall, though, it's an entertaining version of the myth and looked sumptuous.  Simon Boswell's score was also a highlight.",1097971200,12,1796,5.095890410958904
1353823,5,B00004U28P,"This movie is based on the classic Greek myth. As it begins, Iocles is being invaded by King Pelias(Dennis Hopper) and his soldiers. He defeats the defending army and marches into the palace, where he tricks his brother and murders him. He tries to kill the king's son, Jason, but a soldier of the king rushes in and saves him just in time.
Some years later, Jason(Jason London) awoke from a dream. It was a dream that he had many times before. It was the memory of the day Pelias invaded. He asks the centaur Chiron, who had been raising him ever since the day his father was murdered, what the dreams meant. Chiron told him that they were a memory, that the man who was murdered was his father, and that the man who murdered him was his uncle, and that the woman present was his mother, the queen, whom Pelias had taken as his wife. So with this information in minds, he goes to the capital of Iocles to meet his mother. Along the way, he loses one of his sandals.
The court seer sees Jason, and informs Pelias that a dangerous threat  to his throne has arrived at Iocles, but that all he knew about him was that he only had one sandal. So, Pelias orders Jason to be brought to him. He speaks with Jason, and is about to have him killed, and asks Jason for one good reason not to, and Jason says that he will find the Golden Fleece, which Pelias wanted above all other things. Now, the Golden Fleece was said to be the Gods greatest gift to man, for it brought it's wearer his hearts desire. And Pelias's desire is to live forever, so that he may rule Iocles forever.
Pelias has ordered a ship to be built for Jason by the famous shipbuilder Argos. The ship is named the Argo, in homage of it's builder, especially as seen as Pelias had ordered Argos to travel with Jason under pain of death. Jason goes off to look for a crew. First, Jason recruits a former soldier named Mopsus, whom Jason recognizes as the man in his dream who saved his life. Then, they hire two blacksmiths named Castor and Pollux. Then, Jason hires a shepherd named Laertes, who happens to know how to bulljump. Jason also goes to the mapmaker's house, where he gets a map that will take him to the Golden Fleece. The unusual thing about the map is that it is not an ordinary map, but a map of the stars. Jason also recruits the musician Orpheus.
Jason finds the rest of his crew, but as he heads for the Argo, a thief steals the map. Jason chases him, but the thief is caught by the famous Greek hero Hercules,(Brian Thompson) who requests to be let a crewmember. Jason readily agrees.
Just as the Argo is about to set sell, four unexpected things happen. Jason finds his half-brother Acostes stowing away. Acostes wants to travel with Jason, for their mother's very life is at stake. The thief who stole Jason's map requests to be let a crewmember, claiming he has reformed his ways(the thief's name was never mentioned), the mapmaker's son Zetes hopes aboard offering his assistance, which is invaluable(he has eyesight tens times greater than an eagle; a gift from the gods, of course), and the great huntress Atlanta also requests to be let onboard. Jason agrees to all of  the requests. At last they set sail for Colchis Along the way, Zeus, King of the Gods(Angus MacFaydon), and his wife Hera(Olivia Williams, help and hinder Jason and his crew as they sail across the seas in their fantastic search for the Golden Fleece...
Also starring Jolene Blalock, Frank Lagella, Natasha Henstridge, and Derek Jacobi. As an adaptation of the classic myth, this story is incredibly. The real myth was hokey and boring-definitely a myth-but this movie is fantastic. The special effects are great, the acting is great, the storytelling is great, and the movie in and of itself is great. It's one of the best movies I have ever seen, and an excellent version of a classic myth.

1353824,3,B00004U28P,"As someone who teaches Classical Greek & Roman Mythology it is impossible for me to sit through something like the 2000 mini-series ""Jason and the Argonauts"" without constantly thinking about its fidelity to the myths of antiquity.  Certainly this new version works in more members of the Argos crew than the 1963 film version with its Ray Harryhausen stop motion animation that is one of the beloved films of our youth.  This time around there we have not only the mighty Hercules (Brian Thompson) aboard, but also Orpheus (Adrian Lester), Atalanta (Olga Sosnovska), Castor (Omid Djalili) and Pollux (John Sharian).  We also have Jason (Jason London) and the Argo visiting the land of the Amazons and other details from the epic poem written by the third-century poet Apollonius of Rhodes, as well as the relationship between Jason and Pelias (Dennis Hopper) taken from Pindar.  There is also a hint of the Medea (Jolene Blalock) that Jason will get to meet in the tragedy by Euripides.  The only complaint is that unless you know the background on most of these characters you have no way of appreciating who is sailing with Jason.  A prime example is when Orpheus mentions losing Eurydice but does not tell of how he almost won her back from Hades.  Meanwhile, Atalanta seems to be interested in Jason (what would Artemis say?).

But while Matthew Faulk and Mark Skeet get credit for working the ancient sources into this telling of the tale, the problem is that the end result misses the magic of the Harryhausen version.  The problem is twofold.  First, the tenor of the story has contradictory impulses.  On the one hand we have the active participation of the gods, with Hera (Olivia Williams) and Zeus (Angus MacFadyen) aiding and hindering Jason in his quest as they work out one of their frequent marital spats.  But on the other hand there is an effort to make the story more realistic, in terms of the politics and relationships, which works against the idea of being the playthings of the gods.  None of the actors strike heroic poses or speak in grand phrases and even Dennis Hopper is remarkable restrained in his performance.  ""Jason and the Argonauts"" tries to reconcile these two by having the gods work behind the scenes for the most part, but then Poseidon stands up and that idea is quickly dispatched.

Second, Jason London as the title character looks too young.  I know the actor was 28 when he made this mini-series but he seems like a youth.  One of the problems with the story was while the greatest heroes in Greece would come to sail with Jason, a callow youth, which Apollonius solved by having Hera make them all want to go.  Instead Faulk and Skeet have Jason make up have the crew with undesirables, some of whom provide comic relief, helped because of the aid of the guard who saved him from death as a youth.  In other words, Jason leads the Argonauts because that is what was written in the script.  Granted, this is consistent with the tone of the mini-series, but you cannot help but think that when Jason meets Medea that she is going to eat him alive (of course, she does much worse, but that is another tragedy).  The end result is a production of ""Jason and the Argonauts"" that lacks the sense of heroic adventure that the tale personifies in classical mythology.  It was okay and it should have been fantastic.",1056326400,11,3353,4.705479452054795
1353825,3,B00004U28P,"True to the story, good cinematography, and nifty transitions however the acting by Jason and Pelias was downright painful to watch. King Pelias couldn't even pronounce Queen Hera's name correctly. Other actors were good.",1054684800,6,221,5.529411764705882

I thought it would complement the *Odyssey* nicely by expanding the students' understanding of the Greek concept of the hero while exposing them to another Greek myth, *Jason and the Golden Fleece*, on which this is based.  (It takes liberties, but....)  The special effects are not up to the standard kids have come to expect from movies nowadays, but they're passable, and the kids really did get into the story line and the characters.",1054425600,3,553,4.924731182795699
1353827,4,B00004U28P,"I was pleasantly surprised to find this version of JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS as a worthy successor to the original film starring Todd Armstrong.
I admit I was expecting some cheesy, low budget, badly-acted made-for-tv series but was pleased to find an entertaining film that stays faithful to the original myth. Add to that a strong cast, good production values and impressive special effects and you have a film that you will want to watch again and again.
The story centers on Jason (Jason London), who returns to reclaim his kingdom from his uncle, Pelias (Dennis Hopper).  In order to regain the throne and save his mother's life, Jason agrees to sail to Colchis and obtain the golden fleece. With a crew that includes Orpheus, Atalanta, the mighty Hercules and the shipbuilder Argos, Jason faces many dangers on his quest for the fleece.  The argonauts encounter the bronze giant Talos, the women of Lemnos (led by their queen Hypsypile - Natasha Henstridge), blind Phineas (Derek Jacobi) and the frightening harpies, the clashing rocks and more. When Jason arrives in Colchis, he falls in love with the lovely Medea (Jolene Blalock) but must face more challenges (including its ruler, King Aertes - Frank Langella) before he can leave the island with the fleece.
This version is more faithful to the myth than the 1963 film. For instance, Orpheus, Atalanta, Castor and Pollux make their appearance here.  Also, this version shows what happens when the argonauts return home and has a better, more tightly woven ending than the original. The special effects are impressive and I enjoyed the behind-the-scenes bickering between Zeus (Angus MacFadyen) and Hera (the lovely Olivia Williams). I also thought that this version's Hercules (Brian Thompson) was a lot more convincing than Nigel Green from the original. This film also does a great job of portraying the role of the gods in Jason's quest.
However, there are also a few weaknesses. For one, I certainly miss the Talos of the original. Watching Talos first come to life on the 1963 film still gives me goosebumps up to this day.  That Talos was definitely one of Ray Harryhausen's greatest creations.  I also preferred the many-headed hydra to this version's giant lizard-like creature.  Jason London is a passable lead but I believe the filmmakers could've picked a stronger actor. He certainly is nice to look at and the supporting actors more than make up for his shortcomings.
All in all, I enjoyed this film and would recommend it to those who enjoy mythological, fantasy or action/adventure films.  For those who enjoy Greek mythology, I suggest you also check out the 1963 version of JASON OF THE ARGONAUTS if only to see the fantastic Talos and the army of skeleton soldiers as well as CLASH OF THE TITANS (starring Harry Hamlin) and upcoming film TROY (starring Brad Pitt).  Edith Hamilton's book MYTHOLOGY: TIMELESS TALES OF GODS AND HEROES is also a great introduction to the wonderful world of Greek and Roman myths and legends.",1048204800,104,2999,4.960159362549801
1353828,4,B00004U28P,"Along with ""Merlin"" and ""The Odyssey"", ""Jason and the Argonauts"" is one of the greatest fantasy mini-series ever made by Hallmark Channel. It also had to fill very big shoes: the classic 1963 movie was too good to forget, specially because of the incredible stop-motion work by Ray Harryhousen. This version rises up to that challenge and goes all the way. Without trying to top the magnificence of the previous version, it gives the story a much more ""serious"" approach, by giving special atention to the production. This 3-hour long miniseries was shot on location in Turkey, where the actual myth is set in!! Also, the production design deserves five stars. I can assure you that the wardrobe, the weapons, the ships and the buildings are almost 100% accurate! (they really did their homework with those soldiers storming the village in the opening sequence) The cast is supreme, specially the actor who plays Zeus, the king of the Olympian gods. Many interesting characters also make appearances, even though they are not quite exactly like they are portrayed in Greek Mithology (Hercules, for example, serves the Goddess Hera, and Castor and Polux are a couple of clowns). The special effects are great too, even better than they were in ""Merlin"", and you know that's pretty hard to do. One thing: if you've watched the Harryhousen version, check out the scene were Jason fights the warriors born from the dragon's teeth (they were skeletons in the 1963 version). This part is definite proof of how cautious were the producers of this miniseries when they decided to stand up to that fantasy-classic.
Unfortunately, for such a good movie, you'd think they could've come up with a better edition. There are almost no features at all, and there aren't even subtitles of any kind. Even so, if you are a fantasy fan, or a Greek Mythology fan, or an adventure fan of any kind, don't hesitate with this movie. You can't go wrong! In fact, I didn't give it five stars only because I can't give six to the Harryhousen version.",1027728000,5,2023,4.8328530259366
1353829,4,B00004U28P,"No matter what anyone says, this film is by far & away superior to the 1962 Todd Armstrong movie.  I own both on DVD and watched them on consecutive nights for comparison.  There was no comparison.  The 1962 film is full of very stilted acting and the story is incomplete [plus, the ending is rather ""sudden""].  The acting in the present version is better (although not always perfect - more on that later), the script is smoother, and the storyline is more inclusive of the Greek myth.
One of the best features of the present film is its presentation of the Gods.  They are seen as being both awe-inspiringly powerful, yet at the same time full of petty emotions and childish jealousies.  These anthropomorphic tendencies infused into almost all-powerful entities is precisely how they are depicted in Homer's ILIAD.  JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS picks up on this aspect more than any other film on Greek mythology that I have seen.
For the most part, the casting of this movie is superb.  Although it becomes readily apparent that Jason London was picked due to his good looks rather than his acting talents, he is nonetheless adequate.  Jolene Blalock is terrific as the sultry, mysterious and exotic Medea.  Dennis Hopper plays a wonderful ruthless & whacked-out Pelias  (of course, whenver you give Hopper a character who is whacked out, you can be sure that he will deliver).  Likewise, Frank Langella is perfect as the manipulative king of Caucaus, and seeing the legendary Derek Jacobi as Phineas is a treat.  Brian Thompson plays a good Hercules, and has a far superior physique to Nigel Green, who played the strongman in the 1962 version.
A nice plus for this film is that it adds a few other characters from Greek mythology to the crew of the Argo, such as Atalanta and Orpheus.  What is even better is that they actually made them both into major contributing as opposed to being merely ornaments.
Although there are a few holes in the plot @ the end of the movie, where they never really engage Pelias' army (or perhaps they simply forget about it......hmmmmm....maybe Aristotle would call it DEUS EX MACHINA?), this is a very good effort and well worth watching.  Highly recommended, especially for those who are interested in the archives of Greek mythology.",1020470400,11,2269,4.811855670103093
1353830,3,B00004U28P,"Jason and the Argonaunts is probably one of the best-known Greek myths, and this movie tells it adequately. Jason London plays Jason, the son of King Aeson and Queen Polymele (Diana Kent) whose kingdom is overrun by Aeson's evil brother Pelias (Dennis Hopper) who kills Aeson and marries Polymele. Jason however, manages to escape, and is brought up by the centaur Chiron in a peaceful enviroment where he has no memory of his violent past except for images that appear to him in dreams. When Chiron finally tells him the truth, giving him a necklace of his mother which displays the sign of Hera, queen of the gods, Jason sets off to reclaim his destiny. Once home he finds his kingdom downtrodden and poverty-stricken as Pelias sends more and more men to their doom in the quest for his greatest desire - the Golden Fleece. When Jason appears, Pelias strikes a deal - Jason will fetch him the Fleece, or else his mother's life will be forfeit.
And so the journey begins - on board the ship The Argo, with a hand-picked crew that includes the musician Orpheus, the huntess Atalanta, the mightly Hercules and eagle-eyed Zetes, Jason and his men face dangers such as harpies, the sea-god Poseidon, man-killing Amazons and rocks that crush anything that sails between them. But they are being watched - the sorceress Medea, the protecter of the Fleece has her eye on 'the boy with the pleasent face', and her father and suspicious brother are concerned for the safety of their precious Fleece.
The first half of these movie is exellent, and very accurately portrayed in accordance to the myths, (ie Jason's missing sandal, Chiron, and Hera's disguise). I was especially impressed that they called the love god by his Greek name - Eros, instead of the Roman Cupid, which is a mistake that many people make. The second half however changes a little - it is Jason and the crew attempting to snatch the Fleece on enemy territory. They are more liberal with making changes to the original story (for instance Hercules describes himself as being sent to protect Jason by Hera - however, Hera hated Hercules in the myths!). I also felt there was an unsatisfactory ending with two many loose ends that weren't tied up.
However, the battle scenes were good (though I'm sure I spotted someone being killed with a javelin that never touched him), as were the special effects, sets and very historically accurate costumes. Some people claim Jason London wasn't very good as Jason, but he could have been worse, and Jolene Blalock made Medea an interesting heroine (though they understandably cut down on Medea's original bloodthirstiness). All scenes that involved Zeus and Hera in Mount Olympus were wonderful, with the clouds reflecting their moods, as was the scene in which Zeus attempts to seduce Medea. Also watch out for Natasha Henstridge as Hypsipyle, Queen of the Amazons.
So overall, this is a good enough movie to watch more than once, though in my opinion the first half is much better than the second, and they could have done a better job of completing sub-plots (such as Atalanta's secret love for Jason) to make it a more rounded-up ending.",1016668800,7,3143,4.811460258780037

When I first got it, I was expecting something like the ""Xena""and ""Hercules"" TV shows. During the first moments, I was pleasantly surprised. The costumes and background fits with what the ancient Greeks were supposed to be like, judging from urns and other relics and artifacts. The storyline goes closely to the ancient myths and the special effects are decent. Some inaccuracies are present; i.e. Hercules in Hera's service, but it's expected in similar movies.
The actors: Derek Jacobi, Dennis Hopper, Frank Langella need no introduction, there are magnificent. The actress who plays Medea is very good as well, enchanting and mysterious. However, the leading actor in Jason's role is not good. However, for those of us who consider the ancient Jason a useless stud who happened to be in the right place at the right time, he fits in perfectly. And a brilliant casting decision: Brian Tompson as Hercules. I loved every scene he was in.

1353836,3,B00004U28P,"This made-for-television film based on the Greek tale never quite seems to know where its headed. It is visually exciting, however, and it seems almost certain that this is exactly what the filmmakers were looking for that they might be able to hide the films flaws behind a morass of half-naked Amazon women, computer-generated dragons, harpies, and gorgon bulls.
The story revolves around the vengeance-seeking young man named Jason (played in a very cardboard manner by Jason London) who finds himself setting sail on a ship called the Argo (with the hand-picked crew known as Argonauts, of course) to fetch the Golden Fleece. Along the way, of course, in the tradition of such tales, there are many adventures and encounters with gods, men, and unnatural beasties. There is a love story of sorts hidden in there somewhere as well, but its quite unsympathetic. ...
The acting in Jason and the Argonauts ranges from shoddy to pretty good. Even the respectable actors acquired for the film sometimes manage to turn in pretty unstable performances. Dennis Hopper plays the villain of the piece (not surprisingly), the arch-enemy of Jason, and he seems to have a thing for embracing people and then stabbing them in the back. Frankly, it is a silly role, and played just so. There are other characters even more absurd  - one who has the keenest eyes in the land and shouts I see it! every five seconds which is both annoying and laughable. But on the other side of the coin, there are characters that manage to keep Jason and the Argonauts interesting, such as Hercules (a very non-Kevin Sorbo performance that is pretty fun), the minstrel, and the bodyguard of Jasons father who seeks redemption. Anguss McFadyen (who played Robert the Bruce so beautifully in Braveheart) also stars briefly as King of the Gods, Zeus. It is nice to see Anguss again.
Jason and the Argonauts fails in many ways, but usually compensates in others to round out the experience somewhat. After all, a movie based on a Greek myth such as this does not have to be believable all the time, nor does it require the best actors ever assembled. This is a good thing, since the acting and the writing is so hit-and-miss. Fortunately, the adventure elements of any Greek tale such as this are here, and with them in tact there is entertainment to be had. I for one enjoy watching and waiting just to see what the Argonauts will stumble upon next - will it be a god or a monster, or a feud with men over the Golden Fleece? The battles and creature effects may not be cutting-edge, but they have impressive moments. The dragon who guards the Fleece is the creature highlight, and at times looks strikingly real, and the battle against Hoppers troops at the end is climactic enough.
All in all, Jason and the Argonauts is an enjoyable, if sometimes silly, fantasy with fairly high production values for a film of its type - complete with a wide range of adventures that any adaptation of a Greek myth should have. Its not as good as the earlier production of The Odyssey, but its a voyage to consider.",998265600,18,3069,4.704460966542751

He had no charisma, no sense of leadership...I can't be bothered to go on about him. He just spoiled the movie from the start. Apart from him, I have no problem with the rest of the cast, more with the script. Sure there are plenty of encounters with monsters and the like, but  no sense of danger of excitement. Half the cast never use swords, they just walk around and hope large clumps of rocks will fall on their foes. I think I can compare the movie to someone who has just woken up in the middle of the night and is dreamily performing functions like making a drink, but not really aware of what they're doing. I think my faith in Hallmark Entertainment is waning after the dire Journey To The Centre Of The Earth and now this...
So why three stars? Well for Tv, its watchable enough. It could have been so much more, that's all. Jason's search for the golden fleece is classic storytelling and has everything from action to drama, personal tragedy to triumph...but in the hands of Hallmark it has been reduced to great looking scenary and some nice props...
If you liked the original 1963 movie, you'll still prefer it and leave this movie feeling like you've been cheated. Please someone tell Jeremy London to start acting when the director yells ACTION. I don't think the director ever yells WALK AROUND LOOKING MISERABLE AND BORED...not unless he is making a movie about people who saw this one.",984355200,3,1575,4.526315789473684
1353841,4,B00004U28P,"This recent NBC mini-series covers the classic Greek myth of young Jason, who sought the Golden Fleece in his quest to be king.

1353843,2,B00004U28P,"This new version of the ancient story of Jason's quest for the golden fleece appears to have everything going for it: spectacular production design, gorgeous set decoration and costumes, and a cast of first rate actors, including Frank Langella, Adrian Lester, Derek Jacobi, Dennis Hopper, and many others.
Unfortunately, Jason London is cast in the title role, and appears to have absolutely no acting ability whatsoever.  He delivers his lines in a lifeless monotone, and his closet approximation to real emotion could be charitably called ""looking Concerned.""  True, he is hampered by a tepid script, but it's interesting to note how almost every other performer manages to inject some note of drama into his/her performance, whereas Our Hero wanders about like a zombie in a daze.  You wonder why anyone would get on a boat with this guy, and when he does perform a heroic feat, it's hard to believe that he would be capable of such acts of valor.
Ultimately, in spite of impressive visuals and some very enjoyable performances by the supporting players, London's listless, zombie-like trance drags the production down, and this rather long movie (close to 3 hours) is flat and uninvolving.  (I got through the first two hours; long enough to see the Golden Fleece recovered.  I decided to pass on the voyage home --- another 45 minutes.)",976752000,36,1342,5.0

The combination of American and English accents is distracting, and much of the dialogue sounds like recitation instead of performance.

It was a rather corny 2-nighter tv movie, especially compared to CGI effects nowadays, but I've always liked this storyline and acting but couldn't find a reasonable dvd copy until now. DVD works fine so thanks for keeping my memories alive. Haven't watched the other movie yet but will eventually.",1492128000,2,423,4.888888888888889
