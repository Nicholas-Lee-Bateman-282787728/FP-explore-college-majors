1905946,1,B0000AGQ2M,"We were very disappointed in this movie and wonder why is it not rated yet. For family friendly we give it an F. We were astonished and chagrined by the quite unnecessary and free use of profanity, and would not have purchased it if we had known. There were more than 6 infractions...one (1) should disqualify a film from the Family Friendly, clean, etc, group. So sad that they (like many producers) choose to ruin what could be a good story by adding profanity. No, ""everybody"" does not talk that way!",1250812800,3,503,4.538461538461538
1905947,4,B0000AGQ2M,"I saw Gentle Ben on the Animal Planet one night 3 or 4 years ago and was happy to know that they had made a second one. The movie has good, clean, wholesome values that I like my kids to see good examples of. It is also an interesting, fun movie that my kids like watching. (My 17 year old son watched it with me). If you haven't gotten Gentle Ben 1, I would recommend buying and watching it first because this one continues where that one left off.",1216252800,,449,4.056179775280899
1905948,4,B0000AGQ2M,Gentle Ben 1 made you want more.  Gentle Ben 2 makes you want even more.  It's nice having the same actors continue in the second movie.  Acting is great.  Plot is great.  It's exciting.,1168905600,2,186,4.352941176470588
1905949,5,B0000AGQ2M,"This movie surprized me being it was on a DVD by Good Times...usually they are not that clear and sometimes hard to understand but this is a shining example of how well they can do if they want...this DVD was super clear and the audio was super too. The only thing I wish is that for us harder of hearing folks that they would put the CC on the disc too. The movie it self is very good and I enjoyed the show alot. The acting was good and the story line was also very interesting as well. The animal actors did such a great job and as I said before the clarity of the DVD makes the scenery come alive in Alaska. I am glad I picked this one up and if you have kids there is also some good messages on convervation in it. I would buy it again now if I knew what I know now. At this price you owe it to yourself to pick up this disc, why not get extra copies for gifts too...LOL I hope ""Gentle Ben"" which I also purchased is just as good..well done Good Times...",1089244800,10,959,3.923076923076923

1905957,5,B0000AGQ2M,It's just as good as the first one.  This one teaches us not to rush to judgments along with showing us it's ok to change our negative feeling of someone to postive ones.,1371686400,,170,4.151515151515151
1905958,5,B0000AGQ2M,"This is a good family movie where you gather the kids, make popcorn and sit back and enjoy.  It is clean and basically about  pollution of the animal preserves and protecting them from mans carelessness.",1362096000,,203,4.771428571428571

1905960,5,B0000AGQ2M,This is a wonderful family movie.  I knew I had to add to my DVD collection after seeing this on the Hallmark Channel.,1315094400,,118,4.130434782608695
1905961,5,B0000AGQ2M,Kody's parents are still missing and Dean Cain is still getting used to the parenting life.  There's another plot to ruin things this time from someone from Dakota's past.  Dean's character is finnally starting to get teh message that it would be a good idea to go after Dakota relationship wise before it's to late.  Another great family movie but I wish they had or would make a 3rd to tie up a few loose ends they leave at the end of this movie.,1295049600,2,448,4.309523809523809
1905962,5,B0000AGQ2M,"I love Dean in this movie, he plays a park patroller with a kind persona...I mean he can act...and I like other cast members too like Corbin Bernsen (Celebrity Mole; LA Law). Overall any movie with Dean Cain is awesome!",1282003200,,219,4.5
1905963,4,B0000AGQ2M,Nice family movie. Bought this so my young neices had something appropriate to watch other then the movies my teenager get. Plus Dean Cain is easy on the eyes so I didn't mind watching.,1252713600,,185,4.470588235294118
