8680214,5,B00NTY45NC,This was such a terrific show. I saw it in London in 2014 and was thrilled that this DVD truly captured the feel of the stage.  I am waiting for this to come to Broadway.  There was great music and excellent staging.,1459728000,,216,4.119047619047619
8680215,4,B00NTY45NC,"First of all, do be aware this is a REGION 2/PAL DVD - I have a region free player, so had no problem playing it, but if you don't - don't purchase!  I missed it when the movie played a one night only theatre engagement here, so was thrilled to be able to purchase it on DVD (and even with shipping, at less than half what they charged for the viewing).  As for the musical and DVD itself- there is good and bad news.  The good: the music is excellent, and for the most part has been staged and recorded nicely.  The two male leads are both terrific singers and decent actors.  The staging of the attack on Pearl Harbor is actually quite well done for a stage work.  The bad: does it do justice to the Jones' novel?  of course not, but neither did the 1953 movie or the 1979 TV miniseries.  Obviously the story had to be condensed, so feels rushed,, but some of what was included (especially Bloom's suicide) is so poorly staged and unnecessary you have to wonder why.  The actress playing Karen is both too old and brittle for the part, and has a weird enunciation/accent (...several of the accents are 'off' - Gavlovich sounds like Boris Badenov).  It would have been nice if it were subtitled or close captioned, as some of the lyrics are impossible to decipher, especially in ensemble numbers.  The main office set is basically Venetian blinds, and those 'strobe' whenever filmed, so that's annoying in those scenes.  And there is often some inappropriate 'humor' that attempts to lighten the mood, but is misplaced.  However, it's great that this was created, and nice to have such a well done documentation.",1433721600,,1613,4.539792387543253

8680217,4,B00NTY45NC,I was dismayed at first to see this was a PAL recording although advertised as able to play on American players. But I was told by the seller that it would play on my laptop and it did so I kept it. I see they now post a warning before your order.,1425859200,3,247,3.769230769230769

8680220,5,B00NTY45NC,"NTSC/Region Pressing. Tim Rice's epic musical FROM HERE TO ETERNITY was released in UK and Ireland Cinemas in July 2014 for a limited period giving fans the opportunity to experience the critically acclaimed stage show in their local cinema.  The production was filmed across two nights at the Shaftsbury Theatre in London and directed by Nick Morris. Adapted from James Jones' classic 1951 novel, it is a gripping tale of illicit love and army life set in 1941 Hawaii, immediately prior to the attacks on Pearl Harbor. The title is best known as the iconic major motion picture that won eight Oscars, including Best Picture, at the 1954 Academy Awards  ceremony.  It has been interpreted by Tim Rice, Stuart Brayson and Bill Oakes into a breath-taking, romantic and excitingly original  show. Tim Rice is one of the world's leading lyricists having partnered with Andrew Lloyd Webber on productions of JESUS CHRIST  SUPERSTAR and EVITA before going on to work on the international smash of the screen and stage THE LION KING.  This DVD also includes an exclusive behind the scenes tour of the Shaftsbury as well as an interview with Tim Rice.",1415750400,5,1143,4.927083333333333
