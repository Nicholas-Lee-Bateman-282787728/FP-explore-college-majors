8432937,5,630599093X,"Finally a DVD that takes you down memory LAINE. As a teenager growing up to Frankie's music in the late forties and early fifties this DVD brings it all back. As a former president of the ""Laine Islanders"" out of Montreal you know immediately that this is the voice you remember. Gentle, yet powerful even at the age of 86 when this DVD was shot. The body sure has aged but the chemistry is the same, ie, half closed eyes, wide spread of arms, no sudden moves etc. It's a shame the musicals that Frankie made during those early days are not available on any kind of media (video etc) with so many important stars of the day. The orchestra has changed from the early days but this DVD offers Big Band Sound. The picture is sharp and clear and the many flashbacks are incredible.
Do yourself a favor and indulge in this DVD as I'm sure there are some hits you'll recall and the new ones are worth the price of admission.",1087516800,7,918,4.312138728323699
