7924932,2,B00004W5WP,"My advice is to skip this French movie musical and get Jacques Demy's ""The Umbrellas of Cherbourg"" and ""The Young Girls of Rochefort"" instead.  This movie is clearly an homage to the Demy films (to the point of casting his son as the leading man, even though he doesn't really fit the type), but ""Jeanne and the Perfect Guy"" lacks the charm and the visual inventiveness of the Demy films.  The best thing about the movie is Virginie Ledoyen, who is as beautiful and appealing as the young Catherine Deneuve was in Demy's most popular films.  The worst thing is the music.  It's downright awful and the mediocre songs only made me aware of how important Michel Legrand's score were to Jacques Demy's films and the importance of a good score to any movie musical in general.  I'm sure the filmmakers heart was in the right place (especially in their efforts to bring topics like immigration and AIDS to the musical genre), but their musical and visual execution falls short.",1159142400,3,972,4.694117647058824
7924933,5,B00004W5WP,"Wow.  I've never seen a musical that covered so many issues: AIDs, Sex, Gay-Issues, Love.  ""Jeanne and the Perfect Guy"" is a wonderful French musical about a woman who really loves sex, but finally falls in love, only to find that the object of her affection has AIDs.  This musical is not only a splendid tale of love and angst, but is also a beautiful musical, with a moveing score and a lead actress who is beyond compare.  Virginie Ledoyen matches an incomparable beauty with a lovely voice and a superb talent.  She makes this musical the Perfect Movie.",993254400,12,558,4.595959595959596

7924935,4,B00004W5WP,"I caught about 1/3 of this movie on the Sundance channel one day, and have been obsessed with seeing the rest ever since. I can't say I know how good  it is, since I haven't seen it in it's entirity... but what I saw  absolutely enchanted me.  A foreign musical about sex, love, AIDS, irony...  who could resist? The cinematography is gorgeous, brilliant use of RGB  colour. Deffinately one I'd preffer in DVD.",966988800,5,410,4.561643835616438
