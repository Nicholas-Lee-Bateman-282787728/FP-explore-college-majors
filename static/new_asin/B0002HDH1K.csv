2098452,5,B0002HDH1K,"I have loved Alex Grey's work ever since I was blessed enough to have come across his book, the Sacred Mirrors. In that magnificent book are several paintings that ""speak"" volumes about the spirit, the soul, and the inevitable evolution of the being that is human. I use it in a lot of the classes that I give because there is something about Alex Grey's art that really knocks things into place regarding the Truth that we are spiritual beings now.

Of course, there are those people who don't want you to think that this is true. They want you to think that you were created out of sin...that you're anything but Love, Life, and Light and when I first ""got on"" this spiritual path, I used to try and defend my belief as to why we were primarily spiritual, but now I don't care. People are entitled to their delusions. Besides, I don't believe that we are all on a spiritual journey, any more....

I know we're on one.

This DVD really goes straight into the mind, down into the heart, straight into the soul. After watching this, you actually remember that your Source is the Great Light...that you are within this Light now...that you are this Light. The only reason why most of us have a hard time accepting this is because we have a vested interest in these identities that we created. We forget that our personalities, our behaviors, our egos have been totally manufactured, but our True Identity was created in the ""beginning"". When God said, ""Let there be Light..."" You and I were born with everything else. We're One with God now. Instead of balking at this, try and get silent within yourself...try for one hour just breathing in and breathing out without your ego trying to intrude upon your attention to your breathing...forget the hour, try just five minutes of clear, intentional breathing in and breathing out...put a dent, a break in the cycle of thinking that you're just this clod of biodigradable matter. You are Spirit. You are Life. You are what you call God. You are God's breakthrough. You are an Inlet as well as an outlet to all that is Holy...

This DVD is a must for your transformation toolkit. I really can't put into words how valuable it truly is...but know that behind these words is the Same Living Spirit that guided us to being here and now with each other...

Peace & Blessings,
john 'the Light Coach'",1167523200,36,2337,4.58133971291866

Highly recommended!",1146096000,10,152,6.238095238095238

2098455,5,B0002HDH1K,"If sacred art is new to you, or you're already familar with Alex Grey's work, Artmind is an essential foundation to your library.  Inspired by a health expert (Psychiatrist), Artmind and two of Alex's books (Sacred Mirrors and Transfigurations) are used as ""assistance"" for me to describe different dimensions of my healing process that are difficult to put into words during my sessions.  Artmind is fascinating in that Alex reveals intimate details about how he became a visionary artist, and opens his heart as a renowned teacher to educate the viewer about different spiritual traditions and how sacred art can empower your body's innate healing processes.  Also included in Artmind is a gallery of Alex's paintings that the film maker displays with sensational animation design and music.  When watched carefully, ""magic moments"" happen, where the room fills with a luminous light, and an effable Presence.

I thank Alex, and his wife Allyson, for having the courage to be initiated into sacred art by participating in years of research, and safely unveiling it to the world in a co-creative process, which comes from a place of peace and light that flow through them.",1134000000,22,1173,5.088541666666667

8028008,3,B0002HDH1K,I very much enjoy art and this is uplifting and beautiful. It is nice to hear about the process of the artist. Part of his process involves the use of illegal drugs though and therefore the content may not be suitable for certain families with impressionable and curious pre-teens and teens or young adults.,1389052800,,307,4.703703703703703
8028009,5,B0002HDH1K,"I really enjoy viewing this particular DVD.  The detail of the paintings is amazing.  Fun piece to review immediately before taking an Anatomy class - helped me out a bit.  I watch the DVD after a stressful day at work and find it incredibly soothing. Yes....Alex has been inspired via LSD trips but art is art, no matter how you interpret where his particular gift arose from.  Worth every penny spent on it.  There are wall posters available via the internet as well that are absolutely breathtaking.  I can feel the energy of the paintings every time I view his work.  The word I would use to describe Alex Grey's artistic style would be 'profound'.",1313020800,,652,4.6173913043478265
8028010,3,B0002HDH1K,"I was disappointed to learn that the inspiration for Alex's art comes to him through LSD trips. I have seen the walls breathing on an LSD trip and it doesn't mean that they really do, or that it was sacred. Still, his artwork is amazing and the DVD is really well produced. And maybe, as I thought on my LSD trip, that THAT state was reality, and normal mental state is not.",1208822400,2,374,4.208333333333333
8028011,5,B0002HDH1K,"I was somewhat familiar with Mr. Gray's work before viewing this DVD.  I found it a great experience to become more familiar with Mr. Gray's art and commentaries.  Mr. Gray's technical skills seem finely tuned from a lifetime of creating his art.  I think he can't be considered a ""master artist"" in the technical sense.  His art transcends realities.  What makes him unique is his prospective"" modern day thinking modality brought forward to a plane full of light and life.",1191110400,4,474,4.875
8028012,5,B0002HDH1K,"Artwork accomplishes more than the eye can see, it motivates intentions, and activates emotional ideas into action. It all started with cave paintings and has continued to escalate from those days forward.

So we hear about this energy field and what can become accomplished by utilizing its energy, but now with this DVD- you can see what it may look like. This is very helpful for everyone-- you have to have some sense of what it may look like in order to take those next important steps...

Altering Reality!

A visual effect of Quantum energies, how much more motivating can artwork become?

Oh he didn't...

Did he really create such a large painting of the energy grid?

Yeap, he sure did, it's all out in the open now, and I agree with what he said, he's been getting all kinds of responses from others who claim they saw the same thing he did in this re-creation of a vision.

When you think of the word ""Sacred"", don't consider it as ancient artifacts, change your definition to encompass the sacred of the here-and-now. His paintings are a source that is removing the dust from the once hidden knowledge that is now resurfacing, and if you want to see what it looks like, get this DVD!",1173916800,5,1196,4.5607476635514015
8028013,5,B0002HDH1K,"For anyone familiar with Alex Grey's inspiring images and the messages encoded in them, this is a wonderful way to experience his artwork and hear him speak on his process as an artist. Somehow, the DVD presentation of those images appear almost animated (I'm sure this is an optical illusion created by the contrasts of the rich colors, and multi-dimensional-ness of his work, but WHAT A TRIP!) I'm so glad that Sacred Mysteries Productions has made this available to the public...I only wish it were longer than it's 79 minutes running time, but those are well worth the price of admission.  I have shared with many friends.",1173312000,6,626,4.850467289719626
8028014,5,B0002HDH1K,This is just awesome.  If you are a fan of Alex Grey or Tool this is a MUST BUY!!!,1171756800,,82,3.3157894736842106

8028016,5,B0002HDH1K,"the artwork of alex gray is finely crafted and conceptually intruiging.  as an art teacher i was interested to share his art with my students.  thankfully they are college level artists so the references to lsd and ""tripping"" were amusing to some yet I did have to make a disclaimer to state this was not the opinion of the teacher!",1167868800,,332,4.516666666666667
