2857193,5,B000R349JS,"I'm an American, fortunate to be able to receive CBC.  When I see Chris Haddock's name on anything, I know it will be quality.  The minute I saw the second season of ""DaVinci's Inquest"" was available, I bought it.  I've no idea how it is possible, but this series just gets better every season.  The mixture of humor, pathos, mystery and drama is perfection.  The only flaw I've seen in either season is the attempt to make DaVinci's mother seem more Italian than she is.  I can't tell whether the problem lies with the actress or the director, but when she uses an Italian phrase, it comes off as clumsy and amateurish.  This character doesn't spend more than 15"" on the screen in all the episodes together, and that's a good thing.
Season 2's episode of ""Sister's Light"" will break your heart and is flawless, as are most of the episodes.  In the first season, the writing had Leo (Donnelly Rhodes) as an irritating grump, but by the second season, they figured out what to do with him and his gruff humor, sadness of a husband with a wife losing her mind - fit the character beautifully. You know when he comes on the screen he will either make you laugh or break your heart.
Wish I knew how to reach the team that put this series together and ask them why they don't just put the entire set on sale?  I didn't find this series until just before it was shot down by CBC, so was at the mercy of the commercials/reruns until the first two seasons came available on DVD.

I'd like to comment on CBC and their treatment of this team, as evidenced by what they are currently doing to ""Intelligence"", but that's another show and a separate issue.  When Canadians find something as perfect as ""DaVinci"" and ""Intelligence"", they have systematically sabotaged them for what I call milk-toast shows that I wouldn't turn the TV on for. If any of you want to catch DaVinci reruns, they are currently in the first season on ABC, Monday mornings, at about 12:04 a.m.  CBC stopped the reruns years ago but ABC is putting it through a second set of re-runs.
Set your VCR and watch the magic happen.

Come on, Mr. Haddock - get ALL your shows on DVD.  It would be a crime to bury them in rerun land, chopped up and butchered.  You wrote a series that matches or tops most everything American.  Make your programs available for your fans to view and enjoy over the years.
Just because CBC didn't know what they had, doesn't mean the people  don't appreciate your shows, the actors and the amazing writing.",1203984000,8,2490,4.4613686534216335
2857194,5,B000R349JS,"The second season of Da Vinci's Inquest is as good the first season was, and it still has everything one can wish for :
Strong characters supported by excellent actors, fascinating stories, competent direction.
What is amazing is the overall coherence of the sum of those parts : this show clearly has its own personnality, this is not the average crime drama but an unique work of art.",1195257600,8,386,4.6911764705882355
2857195,5,B000R349JS,"Applause to whomever finally decided to get off the stick and release subsequent seasons of this phenomenal TV series, based on the exploits of Vancouver's legendary coroner-turned-mayor Larry Campbell. Nicholas Campbell's Da Vinci ranks with James Gandolfini's Tony Soprano as one of the greatest sustained performances in television. Charismatic, principled, cranky, witty and deeply flawed in so many interesting ways, Campbell is surrounded by a deep and appealing ensemble cast of characters(Ian Tracey, Venus Terzo, Alex Diakun, Kim Hawthorne, Sarah Strange, Sulekha Mathew, Gwyneth Walsh and especially Donnelly Rhodes as the equally crusty Leo), all buoyed along on writer-producer Chris Haddock's fast-paced interwoven storylines. A textbook example of how to create an ongoing storyarc along a spine of individually satisfying episodes. The series loses its way a bit in later seasons, and builds a long meandering plotline that never satisfactorily resolves itself, but it's still a completely addictive ride along the way because the acting, directing and character writing are of such a high level. In this season, look for a particularly chilling guest shot by Matt Frewer (""Max Headroom"") as a weirdly self-confident serial killer.",1195084800,21,1246,5.704301075268817

2857209,5,B000R349JS,"Despite the fact that the actresses are impossibly pretty for any police force, this is one of the best detective type shows ever piut on the airwaves. No one is perfect(or even honest) all the time, but in spite of the right and wrong, the stories come out usually in favor of good. I could drone on about it, but if you're looking for saints, this one doesn't have them. Just people trying to make things balance out ... sammy",1468540800,,428,4.3625

2857217,5,B000R349JS,Top notch show from Canada.  Acting is great and premise is refreshing.  It shows the sometimes seedy underside of one the most beautiful cities in the world.  It is too bad the producer of the show will not release other seasons.  I would buy them all.,1434499200,,253,4.434782608695652

2857228,4,B000R349JS,"I've always liked the feel of Canadian television.  The entire series is intelligently written (with many story lines taken from contemporary events--e.g.,the Pig Farm serial killer), and the characters, especially Da Vinci, are real and very likeable, so that you want to get involved in their lives.  Also has a great Canadian cast, many of whom you see often on Amercican television.",1394323200,2,386,5.209677419354839
2857229,5,B000R349JS,"I'm on my second go round of this amazing series from Canada.
Chris Haddock's name should be a household word for creating the wonderful characters in Da Vinci's Vancouver! The cast is truly spectacular, from the the perfectly cast Donnelly Rhodes as an old school cop, to Ian Tracey's outstanding portrayal of new breed detective: we see in these two how policing changed in the late 90s and trust me, it is brillaint!
I also can't say enough about the mix of single episode plots as well as multi-episode arcs.  They co-exist really well here and that's not always the case!
I could go on and on about this show, but suffice to say, if you try an ep or two I guarantee you'll be hooked on this classic series!
One small beef, and it has nothing to do with the show and everything to do with Amazon. Why isn't this a free offering for Prime members!?  It's certainly been around long enough to be offered for free!",1377043200,,915,4.440476190476191
2857230,5,B000R349JS,Fell in love with the characters and the series while watching TV late at night when I could not sleep.  Glad to have bought all of three of the seasons.,1372032000,,153,4.1
2857231,5,B000R349JS,"This is one of the best tv police procedurals I've seen and is in the league of Homicide Life on the Streets.
The show is set in Vancouver, BC, and we see a side of  this tourist city, one would never expect.  DaVinci is a coroner who is passionate, liberal and forceful and although he appears to be outside the good ole boy network, he uses it when needed.
The show is old and started in the late 90s and went on for eight seasons, but for some reason only seasons 1-3 are available.

The main characters are diverse and good looking and are Indian, Hispanic, black and white.  And the bad guys are not always minorities, so it's pretty inclusive.  I can watch an entire season in two days - by just sitting in front the of the tv.  Can't get enough and wish they make available seasons 4-8 soon.",1364083200,,798,4.251655629139073

Two: Stories are VERY HARD to follow, kind of mixed up even!! I don't know, maybe its me being used to all the American Crime dramas, but I also watch ALL the Brit detective stories and procedurals! Sure the stories are gritty and dark, but still confusing to watch! Still on the fence about getting set 3!!!!
Never feel that way with Midsomer, Poirot, Marple, and all the CSI's, Castle, Mentalist, The Closer, you name it I've got it!!!! Oh well!",1342051200,,551,4.52
2857234,4,B000R349JS,"This series is different from American Detectives. More gritty and realistic.  I thought about the stories in series 1 for a long time.  Sometimes hard to watch for the subject matter, but very true to life.",1337126400,,207,4.722222222222222
2857235,4,B000R349JS,This series would be much better if the writers would not have taken thier personal scewed political agenda as the normal and excepted by everyone.,1325635200,,147,4.92
2857236,5,B000R349JS,"I got hooked on this show just by watching the re=runs on ABC at 130 am Mondays... I ordered the first three seasons, since those are the only seasons that so far are available on DVD. the first season was fine.... it had Closed Captioned... since I def need this since I am a bit hard of hearing.. However, the second and third seasons are NOT.closed captioned, even though Amazon is advertising it that it does have CC.  Im so frustrated. Tried to watch season 2 but its really not enjoyable, since I really cant understand what  is being said. I called amazon to complain about this and they told me to return and I will get a full refund and would not have to pay for return postage. Im so disappointed. Im not interested in returning. what I want are seasons 2 and 3 in closed captioned. but doesnt look like Im going to get my wish. So back to amazon they are going.",1313366400,,872,4.278787878787878

2857238,5,B000R349JS,"With the further development of subplots, Da Vinci's Inquest's second season is aging like a fine wine.  Led by Actors Nicholas Campbell and Donnelly Rhodes, this fast pace gritty narrative set in Vancouver B.C. continues to impress its faithful following.
 As stated in my review of Season I, all the characters are delightfully flawed and all contribute to a riveting and believable fast paced Police drama.  As in the first season the plots are not predictable, you never really know what's coming up next.  In many ways it's much better than the standard "" who done it"" scenario.  The interplay dialogue between characters is both biting and caustic.  This language scenario adds to the realism of this incredible Police drama.
 Look for the last two episodes to chill the back of your spine.  Matt Fewer plays a chilling and unstable serial killer that makes Norman Bates look like Theodore Cleaver.  As in all of Da Vinci's seasons they are limited to 13 episodes.  Unlike the set normal TV Series in the USA which is normally 22 episodes, you will only see the limited 13 shows.  So you'll have to savor each episode in the short season.
 This fast paced series is absolutely the best of its genre.  7 Stars!  No Problem!!",1247616000,,1229,4.76303317535545
2857239,5,B000R349JS,"I got hooked on this after the first episode - called the parents and they got hooked too.-then it was gone.
This aired a couple times in the US and switched to late night where it aired out of order all over the time slots-even daytime.  I'm so sad that there are only three seasons released on DVD and that it was ever cancelled at all.  At least if it was still running in Canada I would hold out hope that there are more releases to come.  Bravo to Canada for airing it for 6? years but where's the rest of the series?  What about Davinci's City Hall?

Since there are some really terrific shows that come out of Canada I would have thought that they had more sense than the US TV producers and networks.  Our networks seem to re-arrange and cancel shows willy-nilly-with what appears to be corrupt ratings systems and shows that get juggled to the point that they are hopeless or cancelled after two or three airings.  Unfortunately, the really great shows from Canada that I have bought on DVD (didn't know they were Canadian at the time but have recently realized the common factor in some of the great crime shows of recent is that they are Canadian) - but they've all been cancelled already and none have all season released on DVD.  Apparently it's no different in Canada than here - the quality of the show means nothing-in fact, the better it is, the sooner it goes.  UGGH

LOVE THIS gritty crime show-all the actors, all the characters, all the storylines, criminal and personal.  LOVE IT!!!!!!!11",1235520000,,1510,4.514705882352941

2857243,5,B000R349JS,"Da Vinci's Inquest Season 2 was just as good if not better than season 1. I love this show!! The DVD set was awsome! For the person who commented on the DVD being in French, it is formated in English. However, you can go in and select it to be tranlated/subtitled in French at the beginning of the set up. There was only one of the shows that had a French subtile running (like you would see for closed caption for the hearing impaired) and I could not figure out how to get it off. To me it was worth it once you get into the show who cares about a subtile on one show? The quality of the DVD's for season 1&2 was fabulous.
