6963493,4,B00S7155KY,It was truly a pleasure reviewing  this with my family. I received the package while my husband was out of town but I did not want to wait for him so I enlisted the help of my 11 year old. I had no idea what to expect so we watched and within minutes we were both up dancing. #dancelessons,1425081600,,289,3.8983050847457625
6963494,5,B00S7155KY,I love these dvd's. instructors make the dance so easy to learn.,1424995200,,64,4.416666666666667
6963495,5,B00S7155KY,"When my bf and I started dating almost 7 years ago, we used to take regular dance lessons in salsa.  Since having our little one, those have gone by the wayside unfortunately.  I thought it would be fun to bring back those times, and have a nice night in of learning to dance something new, so I got this starter kit.  We gave it a go a few days ago, and it was a lot of fun.  If you are just starting out, the pace is slow, and the instructors make sure that they explain all the steps well.  It is easy to follow along with, and we had a great time learning a new type of dance.  If you are looking for a dance lesson dvd, I would definitely recommend this one for beginners!

I did receive this for review purposes, but all opinions are entirely my own.",1424908800,,756,4.033557046979865
6963496,5,B00S7155KY,Very good beginner dance lessons. I would recommend this t anyone who wants to learn the basics of these dances. Fun to learn.,1424649600,,126,4.521739130434782
6963497,5,B00S7155KY,"This starter kit contains four DVD's for the beginner.  There's the Salsa, the Swing, The Merengue, & the Bachata.  Each dance is unique and very fun to try.  You won't get it on the first try.  These dances will take time to learn and practice to get to the level you want to get to.  How good you get is up to you but the one thing that these all teach is that you take it at your pace and you'll get out of it what you put into it.

6963499,5,B00S7155KY,"What could be better than a weeknight session of drinking wine and binge watching your favorite TV series???... Staying in, drinking, and binge learning how to DANCE! Seriously, getting ready for the weekend never had it so good!

Learning to dance out there at the packed salsa clubs can be frightening! And potentially embarrassing! Or heck, maybe it's a long drive and that hot girl you want to take out dances better than you do... Shoot. How to keep her attention? Here's your solution: Get your A Game On with This Series of AT HOME DANCE LESSONS. It covers all the dances that those sassy dj's like to scroll through, so you won't miss a beat. Salsa, merengue, bachata... and bonus! They include swing dancing too! This series helped me to polish my basics and learn at my own pace.

Also, its great to pull out when friends come by as it also lends itself nicely to become a DRINKING GAME! Okay, here's the rules I use (but you can make up your own): *I* drink every time they say the word ""Again"", my partner drinks every time they say a number (""5, 6, 7, 8""), everyone drinks (social style) every time they say ""Basic"". If you happen to have more people practicing in your living room with you, I suggest adding in the words, ""Cross Body"", ""Turn"", or ""Right Foot"", ""Left Foot"" for each person playing. Pairs well with gin and tonic's, rum and coke's, beer of any kind, and the morning after hangover pairs nicely with some SalsaCrazy Bloody Mary Mix (hopefully you have vodka leftover...). Happy Dancing and ENJOY!",1423526400,3,1524,4.599264705882353
6963500,5,B00S7155KY,"This 4 DVD pack is the perfect gift for someone who wants to learn how to a different type of dancing, They provide step by step instructions on how to dance. They will teach you how to do a simple dance and teach you how to be better and add some spunk into it. I am not a great dancer but I learned how to do it. I would have to say it was so much fun to do it along with my husband. We had a latino night and brought out this dvd and some enchiladas and danced out little hearts out. I had such a fun time doing this with him. It is so much better with a partner. If you do not have a partner doing it alone can be fun. Have some friends over,pour some margaritas and learn to dance with these simple steps.",1423440000,,710,3.804054054054054

6963512,5,B00S7155KY,"Just got started with this. I am starting with the swing lessons and am working on the first two steps. I'm a 74 year old guy learning to dance for the first time since square dancing in seventh grade PE class. So I need the equivalent of ""Dancing for Dummies."" The instructors are able to narrow the gap in ability and demonstrate in a proper slow sequence that fits me perfectly. I know I have a ton of practicing to do, but I am confident in my ultimate success.",1448150400,8,465,4.235955056179775
6963513,5,B00S7155KY,"This was a fun DVD that really helped me as a beginner to learn some great dance steps. I cannot say that I am an expert, but I at least have a few more moves that I can now call my own. This DVD looks at 4 dances on 4 discs (Salsa  Merengue  Swing  Bachata). Each disk gives you a ton of content and you leave knowing a ton more than what you started with (that's an understatement).

I liked the format of the disks and each are consistent so you know what to expect. The coaches are good and you can easily watch them and then repeat what you are seeing. What was nice was that because this was a DVD you could easily move forward or backward if you needed.

On each dance you gain a better understanding of the men's movement, the women's movement as well as how you have to flow together as a couple.

Like I said I am not an expert, but I am learning and this DVD is really one that helped me to start my journey and it can for you too!

6963514,5,B00S7155KY,"This is a great way to learn how to dance 4 of today's dancing styles! I don't mean the bump and grind in the ""club"" but when you actually want to dance and enjoy the evening out. This set includes lessons for Salsa, Swing, Merengue and Bachata.

I think once you start learning one of the styles and get used to the teaching method, the rest will come easier. You will need some room to practice (I had to push the couches back) and still be able to see the screen! Keep the remote handy too in case you need to go back over a part. But don't worry, you'll have a lot of step by step practice too.

I think this is great for those nervous folks who would rather learn the basics before attending a club or social event OR want a change of pace for an exercise routine at home. And these make for great gifts, for a ladies night or for an inexpensive date night!

6963515,5,B00S7155KY,"I got to try these Dance Lessons Starter Kit (4 DVDs) by DanceCrazy and I actually love these. The videos are fun to watch and they really break down the steps and make it easy to learn. This set teaches you how to do the salsa, swing,  merengue, and bachata dances. I like that it shows you a lot of fun and relevant moves as well. It's easy and more fun to learn in your own home without the awkwardness of going to a class. Whatever level of dancing you are at, beginner, or pro, these videos will teach you to the same level. I love the music and I loved dancing to it. I know a little bit of swing that I learned in school but haven't done much dancing in a long time. But these were very fun to watch and my kids all want to learn too.
I did receive this product for free but the experience and opinions are my own.",1447372800,,821,3.9757575757575756

6963518,5,B00S7155KY,"My daughter is hitting the age where there are formal dances that require a bit more than just swaying to the music. This set of dances are a bit more ""hip"" than your standard ball room dancing so I think she's going to enjoy these more.

Plus when we watch the dancing shows on TV we'll be able to spot the different styles. The videos/lessons seem like they were created a few years ago, but it's classic dance moves that aren't really going to change.

Very excited to see if she's dance worthy at her next formal. :)

I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion.",1441411200,,638,4.389830508474576
6963519,5,B00S7155KY,"Ive purchased several of the dance lesson videos from DanceCrazy, and been happy with them.  SalsaCrazy is the same company  from what I can tell.  After trying ballroom, we wanted to try the Latin dances that are so popular.

These are fairly simple videos  obviously made be people who really know how to teach.  They break it down - just like they did when we took dance classes.  Mens parts & womans part are broken down  then they show you how to put it together.  There are 4 CDs in this set (Salsa  Merengue  Swing  Bachata)  and there is a LOT of material.  The listing doesnt show it, but I have included the table of contents for each disk as pictures accompanying this review.

They break it down so well  it is very easy to learn the steps by watching and repeating the steps.  The format of the teaching is very similar to what was done when we took classes. In order for each step:
 Introduction of step  why/when you would use it
 Mens Breakdown of the step
 Womans Breakdown of the step
 couple dancing together  no music, talking you through it
 couple dancing together  with music, talking you through it

Conclusion: Great way to learn to dance without fumbling your way through trying to learn at a club.  This will get you proficient enough to enjoy the clubs.  Much cheaper than lessons. It is great bonding time with your partner. I purchased this product at a discounted price and was asked for my honest review based on my actual use of this product. This is such a bargain compared to the dance lessons we took. Its less than signing one of us up for the community classes. Please let me know if this review was helpful. I will always update if I get additional insights after further using the product, and I try to answer any questions left in comments.",1436313600,21,1781,4.464174454828661

My hubby...isn't a dancer.  I thought this would help get him over that...issue.  Well, when I received it I had just tore my knee and was on crutches so my kids and husband used it to learn.  We all laughed and had fun.  I watched and laughed my butt off.  The kids made ew faces at my hubby and I while we ""danced"" with me on crutches.  I think this was the best thing I've received this year.  It was absolutely awesome.",1436140800,,577,4.117117117117117

I had a blast learning the different dances! The only problem that I had with the DVD's is that they had an old feeling the them. Everything just looked so old and outdated, like it was filmed in the 90's. Other than that, it's great!",1429660800,,389,4.2
6963529,5,B00S7155KY,I loved it! My 6 year old loves it too! He gets in on the action! I'm using this dvd to help my daughter (who is 13) learn how to dance. We are hispanic (from Puerto Rico) and she doesn't know how to dance that good. This does a great job in teaching technique and the pace is also slow enough to help but fast enough to not bore.

8697465,5,B00S7155KY,"Great DVD set at an awesome price to save you hundreds on those private dance lessons. I would personally take a few group dance lessons to get a feel of the styles, then use the DVDs until you got to the level where private instruction would truly be beneficial (maybe go through each 1 of the DVDs from start to finish maybe 5-10 times).",1475625600,4,339,4.3125
8697466,5,B00S7155KY,"I wasn't expecting the instructors in this video to explain all the salsa steps you need to learn look so easy. They obviously know what they are talking about and get how to teach a class.

I like how they go step by step vary slow so it's easy to understand and keep up. They literally start from understanding the beat itself to the timing of your steps then to dancing with a partner.

I'm looking forward to learning salsa and be able to apply what I've leaned to the dance floor, but that's not all they have in the DVD set. There's Merengue, Bachata, and Swing. A DVD set that's definitely going to get you ready to empress.

8697468,5,B00S7155KY,"Wow! All I can say is wow. This is much easier than I thought it would be. I thought that it might be a little bit like dance workout videos where you just stare at the instructor and hope that you get it right before they move on. I did musical theatre a lot when I was younger and took several dance classes in college so I am not entirely inept when it comes to dancing, but I have never danced with anyone who really knew what they were doing when I was out before so any attempt at swing or salsa has been less than awesome. I also have the problem that I am a control freak, this means that I have a hard time letting someone else lead. My mum is a pretty good swing dancer and she has tried to teach me, but she couldn't explain it in a way that made sense. Anyway, I was really skeptical that this would work, but it breaks things down in a way that is really easy for me to follow. I am going to have to bully my husband into practicing with me, but I think he will have fun once he sees that it is fairly easy to learn and we are ideal dance partners because we only have about an inch difference in our height. I am super excited! My brother and my cousin are both getting married within the next year and I want to feel comfortable dancing at the receptions. I will definitely try some of their other lessons if I can get my husband into learning as well!

Now, I did purchase this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, but I depend on reviews just as much as anyone else when I shop on Amazon and I am always honest, no point in writing reviews otherwise. If something doesnt work for me, I say so, if it is a good product, then I get excited about it and want other people to try it as well",1468281600,,1742,3.991404011461318
8697469,4,B00S7155KY,"This Dance Lessons Starter Kit comes with four DVDs - one for each type of dance it teaches.  Packaged with the four DVDs were 25% off coupons for the videos following this one in the series.  I began with the swing DVD.  Scene selection is optional at the beginning, so it is easy to pick up where you left off.  It was very apparent that the instructors knew what they were doing, though the acting was a bit cheesy and the video seemed to be made in the 1990s.  There is both a male and a female instructor. The video begins with the two instructors introducing themselves and informing the viewer of their dance backgrounds.  Next, the two demonstrate at full speed the dance they will be teaching the viewer.  After that, the male instructor breaks down the lead steps for the dance.  He does them at full speed first, before slowing them down and reviewing each one step-by-step.  Then, music is added and the steps are sped up.  If you don't have a partner present, you can always skip straight to the next scene or rewind back to the previous one if need be.  When the male instructor finishes teaching the lead, the female instructor comes on and teaches the follower's steps in the same way that the man did - full speed before teaching step-by step.  Once both instructors have gone over their part the to rejoin one another to demonstrate the steps together.  If your partner is not present this is another good opportunity to practice your part for a longer period of time with the music.  The instructors' steps were fairly easy to follow for a person with little to no dance experience, but if you have absolutely no rhythm like me, you may have to watch the videos on repeat to really get it down.  I cannot wait to move on to the other three DVDs and to practice with a partner instead of twirling my terrified puppy around the living room.  That reminds me, you really don't need a huge space cleared to participate while watching the lessons, especially if you're practicing alone.

8697470,5,B00S7155KY,"Learning to dance can be very intimidating and scary and many people get defeated before they even start.
Taking one dance class here and there is also not enough because depending on the class, you do not full grasp what the teacher is trying to teach.
Thats why a dvd set is perfect so you can go at your own pace and stop and start as much as you want.
You can learn and be sure that you know what you are doing when you go out on the dance floor!

This is a very comprehensive compilation of 4 dance styles, compiled into a box set. These styles are different so the information offered is great.
I am a dance instructor and I am not so proficient in these styles and I found these dvds great to brush up on some techniques.

The talking is clear and there are multiple camera angles that show exactly what your feet should be doing.
They do the routines and steps solo, then add partner with music so it is very easy to follow.

Weather you are starting out or you want to just touch up on some dance styles, these a dvd are perfect.
There are many wedding couples that want to dance, but do not have the time to take lessons, but this set will help them out a great deal.

In there dvd case, there are many brochures and additional information.

This is my honest opinion and I do think that this is a great product.
