3412405,5,B00188XHFI,"The second season of NYPD Blue is just as good if not better than the first. Sherry Stringfield who appeared in the first series had left the series by this stage and had joined the first season of ABC's rival network NBC's new medical drama ER. Personally I felt that Sherry was much more suited to this role than her NYPD Blue stint.
We also see the departure of David Caruso (Det John Kelly) who I was glad to see the back of. In his place, one of the leading males from LA Law, Jimmy Smits takes his place and seems to fit in very well at the precinct.
With a decent array of guest stars and good quality storylines throughout, it does seem strange that this series is never repeated on TV in the UK these days.
After buying the third and fourth seasons back in 2006, it seemed that the end of the road had come for DVD releases of this fine series. However a UK company has managed to acquire the rights to the remaining serioes 5 - 12 and is to release two ever few weeks over the coming winter and spring starting in December. It's made me very happy as there are many many more fantastic stories and performances ahead to be seen.
Can't wait!",1351728000,,1150,4.2318181818181815
3412406,5,B00188XHFI,"NYPD Blue had a lot of questions to answer going into the second season.  Could the show withstand the exit of David Caruso, whose star power drove Season 1's popular and critical success?  Could Dennis Franz take the lead and carry the show?  Could Jimmy Smits step in as the new partner and capture the same magic as Franz and Caruso?

The answer to all those questions turned out to be an easy yes.  Franz continued his work of making Andy Sipowicz one of the most compelling characters ever on TV.  Although Caruso did the first four episodes of the season, he gives way to Smits in the fifth show.  And as a viewer, I never looked back.

Smits made the character of Bobby Simone one that was always interesting to watch.  He exhibited so much emotion and heart as the new guy on the squad that no one could resist being pulled in by him.  His chemistry with Franz was easily on par with that of Caruso, and in some ways had more depth.  Simone allows Andy to become more and more human, giving Franz more chances to let his acting skills shine.

Season 2 also introduces one of the show's longest-running and most liked characters, Kim Delaney's Diane Russell.  Her relationship with Bobby became a huge part of the overall storyline, and her portrayal of Russell resulted in one of the best female cop roles ever done.  While the storylines week after week were plenty enough to keep viewers interested, the stellar work of the lead actors, as well as excellent supporting characters like James Martinez, Greg Medavoy, Arthur Fancy, and Donna Abondando gave the series its place in TV history.  It was a bona fide classic.",1341187200,,1628,4.58477508650519
3412407,3,B00188XHFI,"It's hard to imagine that it's been over a decade since this terrific series began. Re-watching the first season really reminded me what a terrific beginning the series had, and although I've since become a big Jimmy Smits fan since his work on this series, I now find that there really seems to be a lot missing from NYPD Blue since the departure of David Caruso. While the show seems to maintain the visual quality and energy of the first season, it seems to settle into a predictable pattern very quickly after the departure of the JOHN KELLY character. In fact, if I was to describe what the first season of NYPD BLUE is about, I would say two things: a crisis of conscience for an Irish NY cop, and the friendship and training of a young Latin Cop ( James Martinez) and his relationship with a solid veteran detective ( John Kelly). I think the best parts of the first season are many of the moments of friendship and training between the Kelly and Martinez characters, and while there is definitely chemistry between Kelly and Andy Sipowitz, there are as many (if not more) finer moments between the weary Kelly and the up-and-coming Martinez. And it's ultimately the Kelly/Martinez hasty and emotional 'stairwell farewell' that touches the heart at the beginning of Season 2, reminding viewers what a rare treat the previous 26 episodes were. Season 2 really takes a LONG time to get moving once Kelly/Caruso departs, and it isn't until 8 episodes later, well into the introduction of the Bobby Simone character (Andy's Ride into the Country) that we start to enjoy the new combination of Simone/Sipowitz team-up. SMITS goes on to deliver some of the finest moments later in the series, but by mid season of 2, we're already seeing the convoluted stories begin, and well as the standard cop cliches start creeping in. These problems become more evident in Season 3 as well (one of the main cast is SHOT and almost dies in a by-the-numbers shootout). SOLID CAST and terrific performances remain though, but overall, a couple notches below that impossible-to-follow SEASON 1.",1283385600,5,2080,4.796657381615599
3412408,5,B00188XHFI,Admittedly I did not find the David Caruso year all that compelling...as I believe many felt.  Can't really say much about the show itself...it is always great.  My complaint is about the dvd....I hate hate hate the menu..it's slow navigating and just very poor.  I hope it improves from season to season.,1279756800,,305,4.826923076923077
3412409,4,B00188XHFI,"I knew I would enjoy these episodes more if I had subtitles to fill in the hard to hear lines. And I got them. The only thing I would like to suggest is that the advertisement should offer that information, that subtitles are an option.",1277596800,,236,4.266666666666667

3412412,5,B00188XHFI,"I got into NYPD Blue thanks to a recommendation from my son. I'm now watching it 15 years late! The first series was brilliant, with Kelly and Sipowiz making an unmatched team. So when Kelly leaves shortly after series two started, I was anticipating the worst. Forget it -  new cop Simone is terrific and the second series has just the right balance of gritty New York cop stories, a bit of love interest to keep thinks moving along, characters with real depth and acting of the very highest order. It has also stood the test of time very well. I bought my DVD used from an Amazon recommended supplier for a very low price. It is indistinguishable from new. Sorry I came to the NYPD party late, but it's well worth waiting for. I've already got Series 3.",1232496000,8,755,4.431654676258993

3412416,5,B00188XHFI,"For some reason we didn't watch this show when it originally aired.  Recently a neighbor lent us Season 1, and we were instantly hooked.  Sipowicz (Dennis Franz) is the main character to me, and he has the best lines in the show.  But in season 2 Simone (Jimmy Smits) is terrific as well (and better than David Caruso).  This show is beautifully written, excellently acted and directed - a classic.  An everyone-should-see.",1440547200,,423,4.819444444444445

3412439,5,B00188XHFI,"Season two was a fantastic follow up to their breakthrough first season.
I remember when season 1 and 2 aired,, and I wondered,, how will the show last without David Carueso?
Well, the introduction of Jimmy Smitts did the trick. I think season two is the beginning of the real foundation of the show.
Besides Smitts,, we see the introduction of Justine Micelli ( Adreian Lesniak), Kim Delany (Diane Russle) ,Bill (John Irvin).
Gordon Clapp (Greg Medevoy) and Nick T (James) become part of the main , regular cast,,, and stick around for the long haul.
If ur an NYPD Blue fan,, this season is a must have!!",1376092800,,605,4.611111111111111

8268863,5,B00188XHFI,NYPD Blue is one of the best shows ever to be seen on television. It's far better than what's on TV these days. What a pleasure to sit down and get reacquainted again with the group of strong willed police characters from long ago (especially Sipowitz Kelly and the up and coming Simone to name a few) and their dedicated commitments to fight crimes and uphold the law of justice. Together with excellent screenplay directing and superb acting it's no wonder NYPD Blue will always remain a classic for a long time. Great product prompt delivery and a must have for any collector or devoted fans. Highly recommend !!!!!,1461024000,,618,4.678899082568807
