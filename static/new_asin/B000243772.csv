2060724,2,B000243772,"The video covers bonsai basics, but in general seems rather amateurish and poorly done.  I certainly did not find it worth the money ($24.95) I paid.  Segues are poor, videography is fair to poor.  Perhaps it was my copy?  No, I checked with a friend, who also purchased it and was as equally disappointed.  My friend is less ""vocal"" than I.  This has no comparison to some of the other videos I bought in the U.K., from a televised garden show, which covered bonsai as a topic.  Those were excellent and at the US equivalent of $14.95, were far better value.

  I would suggest that the word ""banzai, or bonzai"" would fit better, as it would more signify a bomb.",1140566400,4,663,4.45
2060725,5,B000243772,"Frankly, I do not think this video was made for entertaining purposes; although it has some entertaining elements such as beautiful background music, some beautiful trees, interesting clips in the introduction and the bonsai history topics, etc.  This video focuses more on how to keep bonsai alive and thrive like its title has stated.  It covers most of the general bonsai care topics such as placing, repotting, watering, feeding, shaping, etc.  If ones have no prior knowledge of these techniques, this video is definitely a good place to start.  In fact, as a bonsai hobbyist for many years, I still find this video a good place for reference:  I live in Minnesota; the cold temperature from the North region has been a threat to my outdoor bonsai collections.  Every year prior to the cold winter season begin, I would humbly looked into my basic bonsai book or watched video like this one just to ensure that I have done sufficient protection to my trees.  I would simply recommend this video because of its usefulness.",1138060800,5,1026,4.862068965517241
2060726,5,B000243772,"I would believe there are many bonsai learning materials available to choose from depending upon your level of knowledge.

I would strongly recommend to those who are looking for a good place to start your bonsai journey; it is certainly a material that can be easily understood by all.",1137888000,4,441,4.556962025316456
2060727,1,B000243772,"An interesting, even somewhat inspired attempt at an introduction to bonsai, this DVD is disappointing due primarily to the distracting errors in pronounciation (""deciduous"" as ""dessidus""), and amateurish video editing (dropouts, missing transitions, and ""jerkiness""). Its primary drawback, however, is the emphasis on romantic verbiage and music as a background for endless scenics of woodlands and nature vistas -- a poor substitute for helpful information on the art and science of bonsai horticulture.",1137801600,6,505,5.931506849315069
2060728,5,B000243772,"After my first bonsai (bamboo) plant faded away after a few months, I came across this DVD.

The nicely ordered format for the instructions, the relaxing background and a story-like narrative on how to nurture a bonsai plant are some of its best features.",1100563200,8,357,4.95
2060729,5,B000243772,"This film is a perfect Bonsai Learning Media for Dummies!  With this film, I have had a down-to-earth guide to the overall understanding of bonsai.  It gets started right away with an intro to the basics; it is an ideal reference for first-time bonsai buyers like me.

8021653,3,B000243772,"This DVD contains good information for bonsai enthusiasts, especially the beginners, and beautiful images. But the production is not so good. Bad audio, and doesn't follow a sequence of the videos from the menu. At the end of each chapter, it returns back to the menu, making it harder to watch the full movie. Anyway, great material for nature lovers.",1236211200,,352,4.883333333333334

8021657,4,B000243772,"This is almost an end of winter in the North Country. My first bonsai has survived through the cold winter in my garage - yes, in the garage! Thanks to Thriving Bonsai video instruction.

Here is the story: I am an absolute beginner and just received my first juniper bonsai this past Christmas. I really did not know what to do with it after the holiday's display in my living room. Until one day, I had a chance to watch the DVD with a friend who bought this video; its instruction suggested that I placed my tree in my unheated garage that was cold, dark and damp. I wondered at first but finally decided to give it a try. This is what it has happened, after a long cold winter, there are now new fresh buds showing up on almost everywhere!

I understand it is an independent, low budgeting film and I do not anticipate the best video's quality; it does gain me a new level of confidence to begin my bonsai journey. My conclusion is that this video has definitely served its purpose.

I give it at least a 4 stars and I think it is fair.",1140652800,3,1040,4.242424242424242
