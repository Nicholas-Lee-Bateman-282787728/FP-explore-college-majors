It is a great overview of the whole Yellowstone area, including lesser-known portions of  the park, such as the petrified forests.  These days, a lot of people seems to think that if something is not ""cutting-edge"" that it lacks value, which is certainly not the case with this film.  It is also extremely child-friendly.  While I do educate my children about the realities of life in the wild, my 5 year old doesn't necessarily enjoy watching animals eating each other, and this film contains nothing at all that would be disturbing to younger children.  If you like Yellowstone and enjoy old-style documentaries, you won't be disappointed.",1294617600,,775,4.746268656716418

  The picture was weak, grainy, and the sound lacking for a DVD. The information was OK. If you want to enjoy the sounds and sights of Yellowstone in your home, spend your time and money elsewhere.",1048204800,8,314,4.216666666666667
