7800005,5,1598030507,"I was very pleased with the product that arrived in excellent condition a day before the targeted delivery date.  I am a student of history, and I am especially interested in ancient Greece and Rome.  The study of battles is most important as war has played a preeminent role in shaping our history.

I checked out this lecture series from the New York Public Library first a year ago.  It was so popular that I could only obtain it after waiting in a long queue of holds.  And I could only hope to keep it for three weeks at a time.  It comes in two parts; 12 lectures on each disc and an accompanying booklet by the learned Professor Garrett Fagan, who I have a lot to learn from. Unfortunately, Part ll disappeared from the library's catalogue, just as I was looking forward to the lectures on the Roman legions.  I was told that another borrower either lost it, or it was destroyed.  I was devastated.

But Amazon has come to the rescue once again. Although the product is used, it is just like new -- and I have wonderful hours ahead to enjoy these lectures; whenever I wish I can just pop one in my DVD player.",1349740800,6,1116,4.326923076923077
7800006,1,1598030507,"I ordered this product (and I would assume most people order it for the same reason) so I could play it in my car and listen to this while not taking up any additional time. But when I got it I noticed it is NOT on CD_ROM, but rather is a video on DVD!!!! So, it will not play on any CD player, including all cars!

Apart from this major problem, the material is excellent, which is why I ordered it. Watching the professor speak while he runs thru the entire set of lectures is nice, but not worth all the extra dedicated time it will take to watch it, versus making the driving go ever so quickly while listening.

I consider this to be an Amazon mistake!",1221436800,6,657,4.125
