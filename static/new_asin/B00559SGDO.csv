4572659,5,B00559SGDO,"I have only recently became aware of the Disney World Cinema brand, I can't believe that I missed this for so long. ""Trail of the Panda"" is a wonderful Chinese movie in the great tradition of Disney family films, about a child and a animal. In this case it is a ten year-old orphan boy who hasn't spoken since the loss of his parents, he comes to the aid of a baby panda being hunter by a pair of greedy fortune hunters, one of them his guardian.

The subtitling is good, but all audiences, especially the kids, will identify with the boy (who rarely speaks) and the panda (who doesn't speak at all). This makes the reading a lot easier to handle, the story is easily explained through it's visuals. I can't recommend this movie high enough, and I look forward to checking out other titles in the Disney World Cinema. Fun and often funny, adventuress and uplifting, this is the kind of entertainment that Walt Disney himself used to describe as  ""movies kids won't be embarrassed to take their parents to.""",1338768000,6,1006,4.521978021978022
4572660,5,B00559SGDO,"Our children are part Chinese and have been taking Mandarin for a year or so.  Beautiful story, great for kids who have a bit of Chinese knowledge, and for adults that love wildlife.  Pandas are adorable - incredibly cute in real life, too.",1328313600,4,240,4.558139534883721
4572661,5,B00559SGDO,"This is an amazing movie set in the mountains of China about a boy who finds a panda cub and tries to return him to his mother.  The movie is in mandarin with english subtitles.  My kids are 9 and 4, both loved it.  My 9 year old is taking Chinese but only says a few words here and there.  I thought this was a great way to hear the language as well as practice her english reading.  The movie is filmed beautifully, well written, and wonderfully acted.  Frankly I think it puts some american disney movies to shame it is so well done. I would recommend it for anyone who loves pandas, who loves disney, and who wants their kid to work on their english reading.  If anyone in your family is taking chinese I'd recommend it too. Enjoy!",1319155200,15,735,4.207142857142857

4572676,5,B00559SGDO,"Made in 2008 and released in 2009 this is one of those films that are guaranteed to leave not a dry eye in the house. It is about a young boy called LU who has been orphaned but a poor bamboo farmer, Chen, takes him in and uses him as a helping hand in his run down house.

Then one day they spot a mother panda with two twin cubs and both are fascinated by the beautiful creatures. However, Chen is a bit short on cash and he knows a man who wil pay handsomely for a live baby panda  and you can guess what happens next.

This is an amazing film and they used real pandas. This has drama, heartbreak, love and a nice eco massage too. I was moved to tears on one occasion it was so gut wrenching but I simply enjoyed this as if I were achild. Hopefully films like this will help in spreading the message of how important it is to stop these wonderful animals from becoming extinct. It is in Mandarin and the sub titles are good, this is for those who still have an inner child and need to let it out once in a while or just if you like well made films.",1464220800,,1052,3.952830188679245

4572678,5,B00559SGDO,"A great film about a boy who lost his mother and his love and friendship toward a baby panda who also, although temporarily, lost its mother after the boy's uncle and a scientist almost killed it through their failed (panda)napping event. This film was even made greater by the awesome beauty of the mountains of the Sichuan province of China being used as the film's backdrop. There were some tense moments in the film once when the uncle and scientist learned what the boy was doing, but during the darkness of the night the boy, once again, was able to take the panda away from their grasp and then proceeded in the wilds in search of the panda's mother. It appears this film was based on a true story as the film begins and ends with the boy as an adult discussing his involvement with pandas and we do get to see the results of his, and others, work in keeping the panda population alive and prospering.",1463875200,,908,4.4431137724550895

4572697,5,B00559SGDO,"Language is in Mandarin Chinese despite the choice of English. Subtitles are in English or Chinese. Actors and pandas are real, not animated.

4572700,5,B00559SGDO,"This movie is fantastic! All too often, we're disappointed by the films we see, but this one is worth 10 stars. Apparently it's based on a true story, and the youngster in it, grew up to be a very important scientist and panda conservationist. At a time when cubs were routinely dying in captivity, this youngster was the very first to figure out how to make bamboo milk from bamboo root, and was able to save a young cub's life. It's a very sweet and touching story. And it's definitely worth seeing. Kids of all ages would love this film. It is sub-titled, but there really isn't much dialogue; this is a very visual film, and the story is told with emotion, between the boy and the panda cub. They really had a good chemistry, and the baby panda is adorable, naturally. You'd have to be a pretty cold person to not have your heart warmed by this. The child is actually an excellent actor, and really plays well against this panda. It truly is a fantastic film. The cinematography and the landscape of China is beautiful as well. We'd rather watch this film multiple times than be disappointed by any new release. Check it out; you won't be disappointed. Panda love forever!",1356998400,6,1176,4.525821596244131
4572701,5,B00559SGDO,Beautiful but sad.  The mother panda featured in this film was killed in the 2008 Sichuan earthquake.  I have been waiting for years for this film to be dubbed in English or have English subtitiles.,1356652800,,198,4.628571428571429
4572702,5,B00559SGDO,If you are a fan of Pandas (Pandaholic) this is a must see DVD that Disney Films did in China... I only wish that they would have dubbed it in English as they waited a long time before releasing it in the USA.... This was filmed right before and after the tragic Earthquake in China and shows the biodiversity of this little seen area of China... It actually is the true story of how China decided to honor International Treaties and WWF and make the Panda a Protected Animal...,1349913600,3,478,4.382022471910112

8457699,5,B00559SGDO,A cute little tail about a boy and a panda. You find the basic levels of simplicity and kindness shown in a journey about a boy and the panda he finds and rescues. There are moments that will make you be in awe while you inadvertently find yourself cheering on the unlikely duo. It would be fantastic to see an American version of this film thought the subtitles in someway actually add a level of realism. The director is careful in his delivery and the plot is an easy going and easy to understand digestible format.
