FACADE

Imagine a head on collision of El Mariachi sensibilities and the subject matter of a film like Requiem for a Dream, and you get the gnarly wreckage that is this film.  Bedard has poured his heart into this picture and it shows.  His multi-hyphenate duties to bring this picture to life, as well as some superb ensemble acting by Patrick Adams (Old School, Jack and Bobby, and LA's recent production of Edward Allbee's ""The Goat""), Scott Cushman, and Shannon Coltrane.  The commentary is especially telling, and proves that you really don't need much money to make a solid movie.  In the tradition of do-it-yourself-ers and films like ""The Brothers McMullen"", ""El Mariachi"", and ""Clerks"",  this movie follows the path and then takes a sharp turn off the trail and burns a new road with seering drama and dark humor.

I can't wait to see what the cast and crew of this film do for their next projects.  Imagine taking this kind of talent to the next level...I fully expect this film to be a staple of film festival programming around the country for the next couple years.",1119830400,2,1368,4.522448979591837
2349074,5,B000A1BM2Y,"This film is raw and intense; its shockingly honest dialogue was extremely well-acted (especially by lead, Patrick Adams), and I found myself simultaneously loathing and sympathizing with each character.  At the end of the 89 minutes, I felt as drained and hopeless as those in the film, but that is the beauty of a well-made film: total absorption in the moment.",1119830400,2,363,4.950819672131147
2349075,5,B000A1BM2Y,"What a lovely, difficult, sad and funny film.  Although it deals with very controversial issues and extreme circumstances, the characters come alive and seem very real, due to great writing and performances.  With such a small cast and location, the actors get to stretch their muscles and fill the movie with their intensity and talent.  I was very moved by the film, but still found myself laughing.

8071960,1,B000A1BM2Y,"Holy crap. This is a terrible movie. It's so terrible that my last review was not approved for language that was a direct quote from this movie, but I really feel like people need to know how awful it is. So here goes. Obviously, spoilers ahead.

The plot is meandering and utterly pointless; any tension that might have been built by watching this young man struggle was blighted by a video description that blows the ending. The intended emotional apex, aside from the suicide disclosed from the outset of the film, seems to center around the dramatic reveal of a sexual assault that occurred some time ago, followed within 20-30 minutes by the victim of the assault engaging in a scene depicting coke-fueled rough sex / I'm so weirdly unclear if I'm watching another rape unfold that I went back to rewatch it in the middle of writing this review and I'm STILL not clear if I'm watching a consensual act or not. The act is completed with a character who repeatedly challenges the truthfulness of her sexual assault and apparently had been holding it over her head for a while? I don't know. I'm so confused. I'm not even certain that *she* didn't rape him, as he said ""no"" and ""stop"" at least as many times as she did. Did she *want* him to rape her? If she wanted to be raped, is it still a rape? Seriously. What. Is. going. On. Here.

The only thing I'm completely sure of is that the sexual assault side bar is insulting and was shoehorned in to give the viewer some modicum of artificial drama that wasn't revealed in the film description. Holy crap is it bad.

Also, prior to that confusing sexy time, the same girl spent so much time trying to convince her boyfriend (who is the only one who DOESN'T get laid in this cluster of a movie, so no wonder he killed himself, amiright?) to have sex with her that, were their roles reversed, it could literally be a scene in an After School Special about how you can be raped by an acquaintance, a friend, or even your boyfriend; and that not all rapes include physical violence. Her disrespect of his clear and enthusiastic ""No!"" is so complete that it triggers a severe asthma attack in a character for whom (1) it is implied that panic attacks / asthma attacks / anaphalaxysis are a regular occurrence, (2) it is demonstrated that he does not know the difference between the three, but that's okay because neither do the other six people or the writer, and (3) it is clear that, in spite of the implied regularity of these attacks, dude doesn't keep an inhaler in his room. Or his pocket. Or within arms reach.  Really, Harold? It's cool, though, because his bestie who later might rape his girlfriend (sorry, guys, I rewatched it but I'm still really not sure what is going on in that sequence of events... although seeing how Shannon disrespected Harold's consent here, maybe that has bearing on that later scene? Probably not. I don't know.

I cannot stress enough how confused I am.) runs to the rescue with his emergency kitchen inhaler and brings him drugged tea, which he takes credit for making except SURPRISE he didn't really make the tea, their drug dealer did and it's (spoiler alert!) DRUGGED!!! Dun dun dun!!! With FUNGUS!!

And before you ask, yes, a parenthetical can last for over a paragraph. My resumption of that sentence was totally fine and I won't hear another word about it!!!

But, yeah, speaking of things in this movie that really need to be addressed but aren't because no one has watched it, I also cannot stress enough that if Harold had been pressuring his girlfriend for sex the way she was pressuring him, everyone would be like ""not okay, man"". But since Shannon did it and she's supposed to be hot, I guess he's just a sucker for not hitting that. So there's a great lesson for you. Standout line: ""Don't go to Europe. Stay here and have sex with me!""

Go to Europe, Harold. Just go to Europe.

Also, full disclosure, I watched this about a week ago and I'm still recovering, but in the one sex act that is depicted as consensual, both members are on drugs, but I'm pretty sure that the female either doesn't know she was drugged or with what substance. I could be wrong. But if I understood this correctly, it was her female friend who drugged her / misrepresented what drug she was administering, so the guy in the scene might be having sex that would not be considered to be consensual (due to the drugged person's inability to give consent), but he is unaware that she has been drugged. Or she drank some drugged tea without knowing it was drugged, but the dealer who drugged it (and later had what he presumed to be consensual sex with her) actually prepared it for other people who intended to consume it but did not because, you know, they had to burn furniture and make weird sex drama and stuff. Wait, wait. I actually think he meant to drug *those* people without their consent, with magic ""clairvoyance tea"", but he wasn't going to date rape them, though. He has standards. He doesn't put his penis in people without their consent, just drugs. Oh my L-rd these people are the worst people ever. But anyway, back to the Super Sexy Basement Adventure. He can't be aware of her compromised ability to give consent, and if she was slipped a date rape drug by someone else then he may be raping her, too, but while being legitimately unaware that he's commiting an assault. This is another scene that I'm trying to rewatch, but I couldn't find it while fast-forwarding/rewinding to locate it and I can't put myself through watching the whole thing again. I just can't, oh G-d in Heaven, please don't make me.

*edit* okay so I found it, and can i say that Shannon is genuinely the worst? So the drugs got there by Shannon mouth-raping her friend. She was legit taking a street drug in the bathroom, and *standard sweet virginal girl who's 'bout to get corrupted up in this piece, y'all!!* comes into the bathroom, so Shannon is like ""Wait, I haz a ideas!"" and tells her friend (who I'm really sorry, but I legit cannot come up with her name. I want to say ""Katie"", but only because I feel like that's what all blonde, innocent sidekicks are called.) ""Open your mouth and close your eyes and you will get a big surprise!!"" Now, her friend is the most home-schooled person to ever be home-schooled in the history of home-schooling, so she complies. Oh, you poor dear. If only you'd gone to public school, this whole thing could have been avoided. But, no, her over-protective parents are paradoxically so overprotective that they clearly won't let her go to high school, a totally true fact that I just made up, and yet still let her hang out with Shannon. For those of you just tuning in... Shannon is the worst. If you looked up ""Worst"" in the dictionary, there would be a concise definition of ""Worst"" because the dictionary is older than this movie and also rarely has pictures of people unless a word was created in homage to them. That whole phrase makes no sense if you really think about it. That's not how dictionaries work. It would make more sense to say ""If you looked up 'worst' in a *thesaurus*, there would be a picture of Shannon, becaue she is synonymous with the word 'worst'. You could also find her listed under 'best', but only becaue thesauruses also contain lists of antonyms, and Shannon is the exact opposite of the best. Shannon is the worst.""

*Edit: My sister has informed me that thesauruses also don't have pictures and I should have said ""Encylopedia"" even tho those aren't things anymore. Thanks, sis. So... Wikipedia?  Edit out*

So her parents weirdly let her hang out with Shannon, who is just an awful human being. And Shannon says ""open your mouth and close your eyes"" and Katie, dear Katie, of course complies! And then Shannon takes the pill OUT OF HER OWN DISEASE-RIDDEN, PUS ENCRUSTED TALK HOLE, and puts it in poor, sweet Katie's mouth. And then in a scene that's played off to be really cutesy, with Katie (Yea, I'm sticking with Katie. In case that's not her name, I mean the blonde one, but you would know that if you watched this scene.) being all ""I don't do drugs!"" And Shannon being all ""You do tonight!"", but really if you take away the adorable dialogue it amounts to Shannon putting a probably H1N1-infected pill, or at least strep-infected, I mean Shannon *does* go to public school so she's got some kind of germs that we all pick up in school on her, into this young girl's mouth and then clamps her hand forcefully over the girl's mouth, refusing to allow her to take a breath of air until she submits and swallows the pill. Where's your inhaler now, Harold? We may have someone having a respiratory emergency AND NOT A PANIC ATTACK (well, probably AND ALSO A PANIC ATTACK seeing as how she's being assaulted by a friend right meow) in just a few short minutes. For someone who has disclosed that she was sexually assaulted multiple times less than a year ago, Shannon sure is hazy on the issue of consent. I mean, you'd think she'd be hyper-aware of respecting someone's boundaries with their own bodies, but whatever. And poor, dear Katie responds to this violation of trust and mouth by going back to the drug dealer, adorably saying ""I think I need a sitter because Shannon is The Worst and she forced me to take a lightly-used pill of some sort, it might have been ecstasy but I'm not terribly certain as Shannon has now violated my trust in such a way that I no longer feel I can be confident in the truthfulness of what she claimed the item she forcibly inserted in my body is! So anyway, I need a sitter and also can I have some moar drugs, preferably those imported from another country and which have been deemed so dangerous that the government just spent a ton of money and investigative time to pull 150,000 of them off the street the other day? I'm clearly able to make this decision for myself, having never taken a drug in my life, since I was just robbed of my bodily autonomy and forced to take SOME KIND of drug just a few short minutes ago!""

And the drug dealer, being the cool and scrupulous dude that he is, was like ""Let's see, you've never taken a drug. This drug was ingested orally in the last five minutes, so neither you nor I yet have any possible way of knowing how it is going to effect you and you might be in for a terrifying night that may include fatal hyperthermia if your body is not one that cannot process MDMA properly. And you've just expressed to me, hidden behind the cutesy facade that inexperienced girls who want to appear more cool or experienced have a tendency of slipping on, that you have some fears about what is going to happen to you; you have fears serious enough that you have come to me, a stranger who is a drug dealer and who was creeping on your feet a few scenes ago, to ask for supervision, guidance - basically for help. You probably feel like I'm the only one you can trust because you're with two guys who have treated you like you shouldn't even be here, you're ""best friend"" who invited you here just violated your sense of safety and bodily autonomy, and you probably assume that because of my experience as a... let's say my experience as a pharmaceutical rep... I have seen many intoxicated or out of control people and, therefore, you feel safe that I will set safe boundaries and will work to keep you from doing something you might regret tomorrow. Hmmmm.""

And then he was like ""Yeah, here, have some more drugs and then join me, alone, in the basement on a dirty mattress.""

Literally every person in this movie is a creeper, except for Harold. But Harold's screen time is limited because he is legitimately less interesting than the snail that is followed around like an eighth cast member. If you've only counted five, it's because Harold's mom and the dude who's banging her - by this point in the movie, we can only presume that they are currently joining the mile high club like the aging swingers that we know they are - are in the movie for the first 3 minutes.  So that brings us to seven plus Snaily McSnailsen.

Now on to the whole reason I had to write this review. I rarely write reviews, but after reading all of the ones included here I was appalled at the lack of disclosure by any reviewer of a certain bit of emo indie lyrical expression, accompanied by two guitars because ""Bro, if I gotta do this, I'm not doing it alone."" It's a song about the state in which Harold Jr. found *SPOILER ALERT* his father's body after the elder Harold's own suicide by hanging. Which we also refer to a heart attack. Or which we refer to as nothing at all BECAUSE IT'S IN THE PAST AND IT'S BETTER FOR EVERYONE IF IT STAYS THERE!!! Ugh, Shannon. You really are the worst. But yeah, we don't talk about Harold the First's death because it so royally screwed his son up, but, hey, let's make the hilight of said son's birthday party a forced performance of a song he wrote about the state of his father's dead body. After he said he didn't want to sing the song at least twice. But guess who just wouldn't take no for an answer because she lacks an understanding of what ""clear and enthusiastic consent"" means!

You really are the worst.

So I went back and wrote all of this to give context to what is my actual review, written below. If you're still here... well you've already spent 90 minutes reading this review, so you don't really need to watch the crappy movie. Also, if any of your friends watched this movie and then decided to click on ""customers who enjoyed this also liked"" tab thing, please drop those friends immediately. Because NO ONE liked this move and NO ONE wanted to see anything that had any similarity to this horrible, horrible, confusing April Fool's prank of a movie. So I will now direct my attention to the 20 or so reviewers of this movie who reviewed before me:

Can I just say for a second, guys, seriously, REALLY, other one-star reviewers, NO ONE brought up the song? Seriously? A full twenty-seven percent of you gave this terrifying Willy Wonka Boat Ride horror of a movie a one-star rating, and I suspect many of you clicked that single star because you couldn't get Harold's swan song out of your head. You, like me, couldn't forgive their choice to play it TWICE - not only did our old boy Harry play this awful, awkward silence inducing cluster of a song for his friends, he later returns to his room and plays it for HIMSELF, a sickening soundtrack to his own play date with autoerotic asphyxiation. How did he choke himself out with his father's very own belt - a masturbatory, self-congratulating bit of sycophantic cinimal acheivement in the category of ""shoving symbolism down the audiences' throats harder than Shannon (who, in case I've failed to mention it, is seriously the worst) shoves pills into the throats of unwilling, anime-eyed dear children"" - whilst simultaneously performing the disturbing ode to his father's hanging? Oh, he didn't have to. No, no.

Because he made a recording of it.

Harry was so proud of his ode to liver mortis that he made a recording of it. I wonder if he gave his mom a copy. I wonder if she listens to it while getting all up on the dude Harold Sr. freed her up to get all up on. Oh no. This movie has permanently damaged my thought processes! I'd never have had such a thought before Blueish Green. Well fantastic.

Five-star reviewers, don't think I'm letting you off easy. For real, if you so enjoyed this movie, did you step out during Harold'a performance of said song, in which case your omitance of such a detail could be forgiven, or did you actually ENJOY ""Blueish Green""? I feel like there's more to say to y'all, but there's a part of me that hopes that every one of you worked on this movie and are just trying to get some stars so you don't end up like that lady in Nosedive. No one wants to be a 1.6. What kind of sociopath is a 1.6? You know what? Instead of watching Facade, you should've gone to stream Nosedive at a competitor I'm apparently not allowed to mention instead. It really is a brilliant piece of work.  Do it.

Anyway. At this time, there are no three star ratings. I suspect this has to do with the song, because it feels to me like such brilliant lines as ""Is Daddy blue, or is he green?"" must certainly evoke a passionate response from people, whether positive (oh, please, seek some help) or negative (Actually, you might still benefit from talking to a professional. Hey. None of us are so perfect that we can't use a little help sometimes.) I'm a bit confused by the two-and-four star ratings, because it seems like this song should've tipped the scales to ""awesome!"" or ""what did I just watch for real tho?"" There's not a lot of room for measured indifference in this one. I'm really concerned about your lack of ability to *feel* things.

So, yeah. I guess, you know, you're welcome. The time you spent reading this review saved you from hearing the most disturbing song ever. If you must hear it, it's in the final third of the movie while they're all sitting around the campfire, so fast forward and watch for five people and two guitars. If you get to Shannon having possibly non consensual sex with White Guy with Dreadlocks, you've gone too far.

Perhaps the filmmaker was too close to his subject, but FACADE suffers from a lack of clarity, direction, empathy, or understanding of the main character's plight and subsequent suicide.  The characters of this film circle each other with murky intent, and a lack of forward motion in the film makes this a very long 89 minutes indeed, and the result, for me, was alot of guilt for being bored and frustrated in the face of obviously grave subject matter.

The low-budget film's tech credits are admittedly a bit shakey, but not so much that if the acting, writing, and direction were working they would be a problem.
