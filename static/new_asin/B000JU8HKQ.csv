2679499,5,B000JU8HKQ,"I love this video.  It is something that I don't mind doing everyday.  I haven't gotten sick of it yet.  I feel like it is working the muscles that need to be worked and stretches what needs to be stretched.  It gets my heart rate up and sometimes I break a light sweat.  The instructor is great.  It is also very easy to modify the workout to your comfort level, or pregnancy stage.  I'd recommend this video highly to any pregnant woman.",1208908800,,439,4.280487804878049
2679500,5,B000JU8HKQ,"I ordered Buffs Mom's to Be at the end of my first trimester and it has been great! I have had a very sick pregnancy, with severe vomiting and nausea, but couldn't stand not working out as I have always been an active person. I think that this workout is terrific to get some weight training in. A person might want to walk in addition to keep your heart rate up on the days you don't do the dvd or even on days you do depending on your fitness level. Overall though, I think that this dvd is very, very helpful and simple to do compared to some! :0)",1207440000,2,550,4.055045871559633
2679501,5,B000JU8HKQ,I am not a fan of video/dvd workouts.  in fact... I am not a fan of group workouts- i like to go in my basement in my makeshift gym and exercise.  needless to say I was very skeptical about buying a dvd workout but with a toddler running around i couldn't get to a gym or class.  i loved this workout- it wasn't too over-the-top- where I felt like I was tripping over my feet in my bedroom trying to follow some elaborate dance routine between my bed and the wall- it was more weights intensive. Very easy to follow.  I actually liked the instructor.  i exercise regularly and did not think i could get a good workout following a dvd- i was wrong.  i strongly recommend this and i even bought her post-natal dvd too and at 3 months postpartem some of my prenatal jeans are even loose!!,1195603200,9,785,4.23489932885906
2679502,4,B000JU8HKQ,"I didn't really know what to expect with this video, but since I had the Buff Brides book from a while back and enjoyed it, I thought I'd give it a try.  It's a really great video for any expectant moms - if you've never worked out before or if you work out all the time.  I worked out a lot before trying this video and it still made me feel pretty sore the next day.  But as I've gotten used to all of the squatting and other moves, it's very easy to do and quite enjoyable.  It's a soothing video and really does wonders when my back is hurting or I'm just generally feeling uncomfortable.  It helps to loosen me up and provide a lot more flexibility and stability.  I am 32 weeks now and will continue using it for as long as I can.  And I plan to buy Buff Moms once the baby is born!",1187136000,11,788,3.949367088607595
2679503,4,B000JU8HKQ,"I bought this DVD without the benefit of a review, so I felt a little vulnerable about it.  I am 20 weeks pregnant.  I searched for DVDs that allowed me to do Pilates while still pregnant.  Something about the reviews of those videos caused me to NOT want to get one.  So I got this one, and I am VERY happy with it.  It definitely works your muscles, but I never felt overly strained or exhausted.  It's about 40 minutes, which is great.  There is a warm up, a cardio portion, and then a warm down/strengthening portion.  What I like about it is the instructor is not pregnant, but she has 2 pregnant women doing the exercises with her--a woman in her 2nd trimester and a woman in her 3rd trimester.  And these women will show you the modifications that are recommended for women in those stages of pregnancy.  I would definitely recommend this video for someone who is interested in staying fit during her pregnancy.  You need weights, a chair, and some pillows, but all can be done in your home easily.",1167782400,37,1005,4.437158469945355
8153224,3,B000JU8HKQ,"This workout is ok, but not my favorite. I've only don't this one once, I didn't really like it all that much its kind of boring.",1367193600,,129,4.0
8153225,2,B000JU8HKQ,"I am NOT in good shape. I am pregnant with baby #6 and never quite lost the extra 20lbs with baby #5. I want to workout with hopes that I can take the weight off faster this time. I was doing Jillian Michaels' 30 Day Shred but got to the point that there's too much I couldn't do anymore considering I'm 22 weeks along. I tried Buff Moms To Be and first I had to get past the very annoying women on it. First the woman who comes on in between sessions then the actual instructor. Even the 2 backup ladies seemed bored. I didn't even break a sweat and I did about 30-40 minutes of it. I can do Jillian's workout for 20 minutes, sweat & KNOW that I got a great workout in. If you're the type that wants a laid back, fairly easy workout then this is for you. But if you want something more intense I wouldn't recommend it. I'm going to try the Perfect Pregnancy Workout with Karyne Steben along with some others.",1334016000,,909,4.112359550561798
8153226,2,B000JU8HKQ,"The title of the pregnancy DVD is enticing, but it doesn't deliver (no pun intended.) I had exercised quite a bit before I became pregnant and expected a more challenging workout. Unfortunately I allowed myself to get lazy and pulled this DVD out in my 3rd trimester when I was as big as a house and having sciatica. It seemed better then, but still not a challenge. The stretching segments are nice. I probably wouldn't buy this if I had to do over again. If you don't exercise much before you're pregnant this is a great DVD. It will at least get you up off the couch.",1245801600,,570,4.336448598130841
8153227,4,B000JU8HKQ,Alternated with another video. It was easy. It was a good exercise routine to help keep me moving - flexible and strong.,1243555200,,120,4.5
8153228,4,B000JU8HKQ,"I would recommend this workout video.  It allows for a good warm-up and also gives modifications for the second and third trimester.  I did not feel like I over did it, but still felt like I got in a good workout.",1239667200,,213,4.170731707317073
8153229,4,B000JU8HKQ,"Overall I do like this video.  The 'host' is not the most engaging person, but you do get used to her after a few runs through.",1238716800,,127,3.8846153846153846
8153230,3,B000JU8HKQ,"I used this DVD during my first pregnancy.  I thought it gave a great upper body/ arm workout, but lacked in the other areas.  I used this with the Leisa Hart Prenatal DVD as well and alternated between the two daily.  Both videos are just alright.  I will try something different- more challenging, for my future pregnancies.",1237593600,,326,4.666666666666667
8153231,4,B000JU8HKQ,"I like this DVD for the first trimester, because it was easy. Sometimes though, it was too easy. I think I would do this one on my lazy days, just to say I worked out. It was low impact, and enjoyable. There is one flaw that I only noticed once I was in my third trimester-- the third trimester ""variations"" are really just not doing the exercise being performed. The model is seen just walking in place or barely doing anything as her ""variation"" and personally, I could do all the moves even through the third trimester with ease.",1234656000,,532,4.383838383838384
8153232,3,B000JU8HKQ,"To me, this workout is just ok. I haven't been working out for the first four month of my pregnancy, because I had problems with bleeding, but my doctor finally gave me the ok to exercise again. I shopped around for a pregnancy workout DVD, and I ended up buying this one and ""The Perfect Pregnancy Workout"" based on the good reviews for both. I hate those workout DVD's that make you follow silly dance steps and have an overly perky instructor. I was looking for something to sculpt and tone my muscles all over. Well, I tried this DVD today, and I was not blown away. It starts with a warm up section called ""Jump Start Stretching"" which is not too bad. Then, it moves into the ""Cardio Breeze and Total Body Toning"" segment. That's where the problems started. Silly dance moves and perky comments from the instructor! Just what I hate. Also, even though I worked up a sweat, I really didn't feel like my muscles were getting toned at all. And, I felt really silly hopping around in my front room and was hoping the neighbors weren't looking in. The workout closes with the ""Re-energizing Floor Work and Flexibility."" This section wasn't too bad. One good thing about this DVD is the background looks very inviting and cheerful. I also liked that they had two girls showing the modifications for the second and third trimester, although the girl doing the third trimester modifications doesn't really move a lot and seems slightly uncoordinated at times. I really have mixed feelings about this workout. I might go back to it very late in my third trimester, when I need a more modified workout. For now, I will continue to use ""The Perfect Pregnancy Workout"" which is great.",1209513600,6,1677,4.630872483221476
8153233,5,B000JU8HKQ,"I was a gym rat before I got pregnant. My obsession is lifting weights. Earlier this year I had a miscarriage (WHICH HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH MY WORKING OUT) so when we successfully got pregnant again, my hubby forbade me to go to the gym and lift. I explained that working out during pregnancy is healthy, my midwife allowed it, yada yada...but he wasn't and still isn't trying to hear it.

So, I ordered this DVD to show him that it is OK to be preggers and lift weights. Well, let me tell ya, this DVD gave me a great cardio & strength training workout. The plank/leg work is awesome.

Even hubby gives it the thumbs up. He calls it the ""Baby Got Back"" video. LOL!",1209513600,,665,4.228346456692913
