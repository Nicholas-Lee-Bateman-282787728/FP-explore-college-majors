8462088,1,B0058OR3RG,"First off I want to make it clear the performance is 5 Star.

My problem is that I have two copies of this Blu-ray and both have died.

My first copy purchased in May 2015 was basically Dead On Arrival. First couple times I could only watch a couple tracks and then it died altogether.

Second copy purchased in February of 2016 lasted about 1-1/2 years and now it does not play. Two in a row can't just be a coincidence ???",1509494400,,424,4.146341463414634
8462089,5,B0058OR3RG,Never thought I would see Iggy and the Stooges playing the album Raw Power in its entirety!  Excellent performance great line up.  This is great.,1483833600,,145,4.76
8462090,5,B0058OR3RG,Iggy and The Stooges put on an amazing show in this performance of Raw Power Live. It was great to see and hear the guitar riffs from that album being played live in modern times by James Williamson as only he can play them. Video quality is excellent.,1355529600,,252,4.270833333333333
