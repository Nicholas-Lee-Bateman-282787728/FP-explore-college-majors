7741465,5,B01F0XP4GQ,"If David Lynch had directed ""Rear Window,"" that movie would have been Observance. Observance is extremely well acted, well directed and has the best sound effects of any recent horror movie.
While the film does not have many jump scares, those it had knocked me out of my chair.
The film chronicles a descent into madness and contains a whiff of the Lovecraftian supernatural. I couldn't take my eyes from the film.
For serious fans of knife-sharp psychological horror, I highly recommend this terrifying movie.
Outstanding horror filmmaking here, folks.",1476835200,6,554,5.166666666666667
7741466,1,B01F0XP4GQ,"I had heard good things about this movie, and was waiting for it to come to Amazon. I was very disappointed in it now that it has.

There is no real plot. Guy is watching hot girl. He starts seeing weird things. He losses his mind. He does something bad. Movie over.

Not worth your money.",1476144000,3,289,4.142857142857143
7741467,4,B01F0XP4GQ,"A man whose life is falling apart after his sons death takes on a private investigation job where he sits in a derelict apartment building in order to watch a woman who lives across the street. But theres something about the job, and the building itself that threatens to consume him. I love it when a movie isn't so cut and dried, when you're forced to think, where the imagination blooms. This is one of those movies. Its pretty Lovecraftian in that respect. Theres this constant feeling of dread and something ominous at play, but not very much unexplained. This vibe put forth brilliantly by the director is enhanced by some pretty gorgeous and often dark cinematography and also some startling shots to rattle up some tension. The acting is pretty good too. Its really well done, and I appreciate the heck out of the effort, but I was left with wanting more. In a good and bad way. Maybe the movie was a little too vague and it seems incomplete, or maybe that was the intention. Either way I greatly enjoyed it.",1474156800,2,1016,4.557377049180328

7741469,4,B01F0XP4GQ,"Both disgusting and beautiful, this harkens back to Lynch films in many ways with the stylized cinematography and ambiguous plotting as well as pacing.  Didn't know where this was going which isn't a bad thing.  I'll keep an eye out for this filmmaker.  A surreal arthouse romp for sure though I hate to sum this up in just those few words, those that DON'T appreciate these types of films may appreciate the heads up.",1472083200,,418,4.621621621621622
7741470,2,B01F0XP4GQ,"Following the death of his son and wife's refusal to talk to him, Parker (Lindsay Farris) takes on a task as a private investigator. He lives in a dump of an apartment as he watches the blonde (Stephanie King) across the street. He descends into madness (or whatever was happening) as he spies on the woman who has an abusive relationship with her fiance (Tom O'Sullivan). In addition to weird occurrences happening in his apartment, Parker becomes physically ill as he discovers there is something else at play...an offering? Does it relate to the past? the doctor?

Who the heck knows, the film didn't give me closure. Almost as confusing as that Jake Gyllenhaal thing (Enemy).

Guide: F-word, brief sex. Nudity? Ummm...she lived in apartment 126. He is across the street in 128. Shouldn't one side be an odd number? Just observing.",1470528000,2,834,4.866197183098592
7741471,3,B01F0XP4GQ,"Observance is the type of odd movie that I feel if moviegoers gave it a good shot, they would be very entertained. If you took the style of Brian De Palma mixed it with Alfred Hitchcock, then threw in David Lynch you would have the overall feeling of Observance. On paper, this film sounds easy, you have a man who is hired by an unseen employer to spy on a woman. Parker is told by this employer it will only be a couple of days, his one and only job is watch the woman across the street. At first, Parker is doing his job without asking too many questions. As the days go by, the unseen employer informs Parker that he needs him to stay longer than originally expected and watch her some more.

This causes Parker to start becoming overly paranoid. This paranoia may also be one of the signs that this job may be getting to him. In a interesting little twist and backstory, we watch as Parker is still recovering from the death of his son and trying to pick up the pieces of his life. In this mind, he views this job as a way to get back into life again. Soon enough, Parker starts seeing shadows, hearing voices and vomiting this gloppy black liquid. The film is a slow burn, but as the film is burning, the tension is building. You never quite know what is truly going on.

The film goes flashbacks, images and reality in a way you are not really sure at times what part of the spectrum you are on with this story and character. The ending has more questions than answers, which was so smart to utilize that thinking. This is one of those films that you are left to figure out the puzzle once it ends. I felt this film was very much a modern day take on Rear Window with horror elements thrown in for extra impact. From start to finish, this film was a brave journey that I feel will mess with people long after you get off the ride. Better yet, I feel there may not be a way off of this ride. A day after I watched it, I am left trying to sort it all out and figure out what they were trying to manipulate me to believe. This film does the job it is supposed to do and will have you wanting to tell your friends and see what they get out of this film.",1470528000,2,2156,4.106635071090047

7741473,4,B01F0XP4GQ,"Private investigator Parker is at the end of his rope, problems in his personal life and financial woes has lead him to  accept, what on the surface looks to be a routine surveillance job. Parker is to keep tabs on a mysterious woman living across from the abandoned and dilapidated apartment complex where he sets up shop. But events take a dark turn and the newfound occupancy seems to have an ominous and sinister mind, all of its own.

Joseph Sims-Dennett micro-budgeted creep-feature offers an impressive showing of restraint and understanding of the Polanski inspired tropes he employs throughout, to successfully craft an ambiguous nightmarish homage that works in its own right.

Still, I must stress that this isn't a film for everybody. If you prefer your horror spelled out for you ala the studio financed romps that haunts your local Cineplex. Then the film isnt, I repeat ISNT FOR YOU!
Contrary, if you enjoy a deceptively vague and atmospheric chiller that offers no clear narrative resolution you should have a grand old time, I know I did.",1470355200,,1055,4.915730337078652
7741474,3,B01F0XP4GQ,"Well if you were ever actually on a surveillance job sitting in an empty apartment watching your victim through a camera lens, I'd imagine it would be pretty boring.  The hurdle therefore, for a movie about someone doing this is to try and ensure the audience isn't as bored as the character would be.  This one has a paid stalker where he and the audience doesn't really know who his boss is, is it the man who visits the beautiful blond woman and delves out domestic violence whenever he's there or someone else.  The run down flat has also seen better days, the shower can burn you one second and be freezing cold the next, but is there something else living (or dead) there, or is the paid stalker actually sick or have mental illness?  None of these questions are really answered by the end. Does it jump that hurdle of the audience being bored, slightly at times but overall no.

This one also has an annoying grating music sound on the DVD menu screen, usually you can just leave the menu up until everyone is ready to watch but this one is so annoying you just can't.  Also being this is a film shot in Sydney, for some reason characters seem to be trying to talk in American accents, which lets the film down as well.",1468022400,2,1226,4.378854625550661
7741475,2,B01F0XP4GQ,"While it exhibited some interesting possibilities, and kept me interested to find out what happens, it never pays off or explains anything, just becomes more confusing as the movie drags on and on and leaves you unsatisfied. Still, I'm a fan of Hitchcock and Lynch so I stuck with it but it just threw every bit of logic out the window. I think it could have been a good movie has they structured it so the clues were explained and had given it a resolution but the way it ended up left me asking what the point of the movie even was? I give it two stars for at least the camera angles and sound design were good and definitely created a spooky atmosphere. There was a behind the scenes clip but it reveals very little and is short and not really worth the price of the DVD.",1486771200,3,774,4.236486486486487

7741479,1,B01F0XP4GQ,"I'm an avid horror fan, so I tend to watch a lot of them. This movie blows in my humble opinion. The creepiest thing about the whole movie is the lead actor having weeping 2nd degree burns and sleeping in that dirty apartment. This movie makes no sense whatsoever, and it tries too hard to be an arty, high concept thriller. It fails miserably in so many ways. The middle sags, we have characters that are flat and one dimensional, I'm 3 quarters of the way through and I literally don't care if any of them die or go crazy. In fact, I'd actual prefer for someone to die so that this film would finally make some damn sense and get interesting.",1484179200,,644,4.286885245901639

It has some very atmospheric moments, sustained tension and some good scares. The film evokes dread and the editing is clever. Some atmospheric photography and effects. It really seems like everyone who worked on this film gave it their all. Lead actor is great. Sure, there are loose ends and the story doesn't altogether make sense, but hey, you show me a story that makes 100% sense and has its ends all tidily wrapped up and you'll be showing me a very dull and unadventurous horror movie.

7741483,4,B01F0XP4GQ,"Nicely filmed minimalist micro budget psych thriller about surveillance, murder, madness.

""there is no plot"" some viewers complain.
Well it's an atmospheric piece, but it does have a very strong premise and it keeps you guessing.
Great nightmarish surealistic imagery here.
The suggested back story is a little too hackneyed and maudlin, but the lead performance is strong enough to make up for it.

One reviewer mentioned Lynch and Hitchcock.
It's also reminiscent of Coppola's 1947 masterpiece The Conversation. It has the same level of paranoia.
Like the earlier film, it's about a PI who is supposed to be watching other people but it turns out he's the one being watched.
Also retains a similar abstraction when it comes to plot.

Will impress fans of indie horror who like subtle, surreal mood pieces will love this film.",1481414400,,828,5.029197080291971

7741488,1,B01F0XP4GQ,"Trust the low ratings on this one.  It's an unmitigated piece of crap.  If there is a story here, it could have been told in 5 minutes.  I have no idea what the story is.  There's a guy who's spying on a woman.  The guy has personal issues.  There's blood.  There are many scenes that are supposed to make you jump out of your seat, but you don't really care.  It's been compared to Hitchcock, Polanski, and Argento.  Try Ed Wood.  Then there's the ""ending"" that's continued through the credits.  Nothing is explained and quite frankly, it will put you to sleep with the horridly slow pacing.  The acting is great, and the directing isn't too bad.  But learn how to tell a story.  There's a beginning, middle, and end.  Oh, you're supposed to watch it over and over again so you can come to your own conclusion.  BS.  That's just lazy storytelling because you didn't flesh out the story you wanted to tell.  You want a great Australian movie?  Go rent ""The Babadook"".

7741492,1,B01F0XP4GQ,"A disorganized mess. The director has discarded the best of the conventions of plot, narrative, and cohesive writing to focus instead on artsy camera angles, heavy-handed color grading, and over-the-top sound design. The film mistakes pretentious navel-gazing for brooding. Observance attempts to drown the audience in dread, but instead succeeds in drowning us in boredom, making us slog through tedious film-school reveries, only to reward us with an amputated ending and a lack of any form of resolution or even platform for discussion. Resolving none of the questions raised throughout your film does not make you artistic, merely lazy. Character motivation is beyond paper thin and inconsistent. Sensible plot points? Forget it! Who needs those when you have random s*** you found in the basement and a tub of black goo? Snore.

Just to make sure there isn't something being missed. For this movie, I think the rotten tomatoes paid reviewers were sufficiently impressed with the style, the horror glitz, the terror glamor, the camera work, the sound design, the individual creep moments, and did not require information of any kind. The film doesn't give information and doesn't give resolution. As one review said that I do agree with, this film is entirely about mood.

8759915,5,B01F0XP4GQ,"I haven't felt so unnerved since watching ""The Wailing."" Observance got under my skin so much so that I had a very difficult time sleeping after watching it. And while watching it I had a genuinely violent reaction, which involved me uncontrollably screaming several times during the duration of a scene. This has never happened to me before, that level of physical reaction. This film is a PERFECT slow burn, meandering it's way to to a satisfying conclusion that left me feeling dirty and like I needed to wash myself clean. The plot is solid and simple, and executed fantastically well. The acting/writing was great. The sound mixing and editing was exceptional. The cinematography fuuuuuuuq, just gorgeous. Just an absolutely refreshing film! Please do yourself a favor: buy and watch. I cannot recommend this gem enough, this film does horror like very, very few others.

**This is however, as I mentioned before, a slow burn, and definitely screams for multiple viewings to understand some of the visual exposition stitched throughout the film. If you're a casual movie-watcher you should probably take a hard left and avoid this film.

The characters are barely there - you get a pretty decent idea of the mental anguish the protagonist is suffering but every other aspect is washed out.  All of the other roles are skeletal.  The viewer is left grasping at straws.  I personally do not feel the need for the director and writer to connect the dots for me in most cases but here the dots are way too few and way too far apart.  I was able to watch the entire film and make connections here and there but the conclusion left considerable confusion.  A film, perhaps, for those who like theorizing.
