7880547,1,6305020035,"If you were looking for the highly praised Chang Cheh directed film (aka Unbeatable Dragon), this can't be it!  The director listed on the box is a different name altogether, unless it is some sort of translated name.  My recollection, in fact, is that the ""other"" film was named  ""North Shaolin vs. South Shaolin."" The production quality here is poor and choppy.  In one sequence, in fact, the film frame is offset vertically where you see a thin strip at the bottom of the screen representing the very ""top"" of the film frame (how sloppy is that!).  The fighting throughout is mundane.  The final lengthy fight is reasonably entertaining, but it comes after 85 minutes of torture.  The fact that this was a subtitled film, with cramped truncated subtitles, and not a dubbed film made whatever plot existed impossible to follow.",970444800,2,829,4.836879432624113
