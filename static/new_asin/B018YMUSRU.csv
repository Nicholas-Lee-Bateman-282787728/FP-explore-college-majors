7560813,5,B018YMUSRU,"I stumbled on to Essentrics at my local Y and was hooked. It is a combo of barre, stretching, and toning.
I don't partake in any kind of high level cardio or zumba, but this dvd really got me pumped up. It states that it's for beginners but unless you are an advanced beginner, I would recommend starting with their actual beginners level toning dvd and work up to this one which has a much more faster pace.

Two 30 min sections: one emphasizing standing work and the other mat work.
I usually do both which is a challenge, but after that hour every muscle in your body will be fully worked and you'll feel loose and conditioned.",1454198400,19,630,4.338983050847458
7560814,5,B018YMUSRU,"I just did this new dvd  today, I loved it, it was so light and bright, I have almost every other essentrics dvd made, and this is a wonderful toning and stretching workout, I have not been exercising lately, and this was an awesome total body routine, I liked the music choices she used as well, not maybe as driving or upbeat as previous dvd music she has used but was really nice and she works to the beat most of the time which I love. when I have done this routine at least 10 times for me I should be able to flow really well with her and be much more mindful of my stretching out and engaging my muscle's, I am a little slow to catch on and be consistent, but I really loved how loose my shoulder area and my neck was after the final stretch, and I have felt my quads all day going up and down our stairs, I still love the Sculpting one the Very best, this one is definitely my 2nd choice now,  I will now be super satisfied in my rotation choices, she says she does boot camps , an advanced routine would be awesome for the future. I love working out with Sahra, she is calm and confident I do not get tired of her personality, which is awesome for the home exerciser. Thank you Sahra",1449705600,21,1192,4.068085106382979
7560815,2,B018YMUSRU,"After watching this tape, with expectations it would help me, I found that the person was so limber, but for a beginner there's no way, it's possible to follow the movements, routine with any beginners instructions.  It's not a tape for someone who's never done this, and I'm a yoga teacher.",1489795200,6,291,4.705882352941177
7560816,5,B018YMUSRU,"After I tried it  I found the music is not that distracting and while she does talk more than usual for the benefit of those people who constantly need to be told to tuck in, or squeeze abs, it is actually a great, wonderful workout. She still has the sweet personality she did in the 2012 video only she's naturally slightly more authoritative. Great workout for loosening and stretching all limbs and creating a calm mind. Update: the more you do the work out, the more you get out of it. You are able to focus your mind on your muscles and proper alignment and you sweat much more. I am loving this work out and I find Sarah a very very pleasant person to work out with! (I do shut the sound off as I find the noise of the music distracting-- I'm a classical music lover and hate modern noise). I also need to point out: I think I've lost a 1/4 inch in doing it for about 7 times in 11 days! You really sweat when you are doing the moves properly and it leaves one feeling renewed and refreshed. UPDATE: IT'S ABOUT A MONTH LATER AND I'VE LOST 2 INCHES FROM MY ABDOMEN, MY HIPS AND THIGHS!!!!!!!! MY ARMS HAVE LOST ABOUT AN INCH OR MORE AS WELL!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE YOU FEEL SO SO GOOD SO GOOD SO GOOD AFTERWARDS*********************

SARAH: I need a more advanced essentrics workout! I can't keep doing the same one day after day. All of the others are too slow for me. Can you please put together a CD with two ADVANCED 30 minute workouts please??? Thank You!!!",1482192000,26,1467,4.254480286738351
7560817,5,B018YMUSRU,"Amazing. I recommend this to anyone who is trying to relearn or rehabilitate their posture and awaken dormant muscle groups. This is one of those workouts where you learn something new about your body each time you do it. It's not impactful, either, so you can simply focus on your form and the proper use of your muscles. Sahra is calm, personable, and provides helpful, descriptive instructions. I originally saw an infomercial for the Essentrics workout and proceeded to price-compare and review-compare Essentrics DVDs. I'm so glad I picked this one. It's my new favorite workout and it's helped me feel muscle groups that my body had long since forgotten. I'll be in the market for more of Sahra's Essentrics workouts soon.",1482192000,10,728,4.975409836065574
7560818,5,B018YMUSRU,"Great workout! I normally do a yoga or Pilates workout to get in a nice stretch, but ordered this last week and tried it out yesterday. I was pleasantly surprised at how great I felt after trying out one of the shorter workouts (floor exercises). Enjoyed it so much, I decided to order the ESSENTRICS Body Sculpting Series too.

I'm looking forward to doing the other two workouts on this disc, as well as trying out the sculpting workouts.",1481673600,5,440,4.569620253164557
7560819,5,B018YMUSRU,Never knew stretching and toning could make me sweat and kick my butt!,1477612800,,70,4.461538461538462
7560820,5,B018YMUSRU,"I enjoy Essentrics--and its parent workout, Classical Stretch--for the combined toning and stretch benefits that it provides.  Essentrics Full Body Toning is definitely the most intense of the series that I've tried to day.  Instructor Sahra Esmonde-White notes that this routine is a favorite, and one of the first ones that new Essentrics teachers learn.

The Main Menu of the DVD offers the following options:
*Play Workout, 60 minutes
*Standing Exercises, 30 minutes
*Floor Exercises, 30 minutes

The times are a little off, as the total time for the DVD is only about 56 minutes.  I have provided actual times for each segment as well as some additional details below.

Standing (33 minutes)
Sahra, instructing live on her own, begins here with about a 3-minute warm-up.  This is a typical CS/Essentrics warm-up and includes moves such as reaches, kicks, and knees set to upbeat music.  This is followed by a shoulder blast segment to thoroughly stretch the upper body.  Next, Sahra moves to the lower body, first for side-to-side lunges, adding in arms work, then to Tai Chi plies, also adding arms work to the end.  A pure arm toning segment follows, about 3 minutes.  Sahra then performs windmills, first to the front, then side-to-side, adding reach-and-pulls.  She finishes the standing work with airplanes, calf/Achilles stretches, and hamstring stretches.

Floorwork (23 minutes)
Sahra begins on the floor with side leg lifts.  She performs double leg lifts first and then works inner thigh, outer thigh, and glutes.  Next is a series of abs crunches.  Sahra continues with some seated toning work by doing leg lifts for the quads.  Finally, she finishes with about 10 minutes of final stretches, including both lying and seated.

I really enjoyed this workout.  It's great to have the option of doing a full 56-minute workout or easily breaking it into two separate segments.  I would highly recommend it for fans of Essentrics or anyone interested in a non-weighted toning workout.",1469404800,20,1995,5.098765432098766

7560822,5,B018YMUSRU,"Very pleased ! This video will change your life ! It amazing how this low impact video will strengthen and tone your muscles and increase your flexibility . Try it , you'll love it, and save on gym memberships !",1464048000,7,211,4.3
7560823,5,B018YMUSRU,"I love Essentrics and this is  the third DVD that I have purchased.  My only criticism of the teaching style of both Miranda and Sahra, is that they don't talk enough about what different parts of your body should be doing while some parts are being worked on. For example, when doing plies it should be pointed out that your back should not be in a C-curve, and there should be more verbal reminders about thrusting one's chest out and not sinking into your spine when doing the arm movements, etc. This DVD does have an abdominal toning  section which is much appreciated as it is simple and effective. In general, the Essentrics DVDs would be better if they just  had another person doing a modified version of each exercise, and better yet if Sahra herself did not exercise during the whole DVD but would stop and point out what the model is doing wrong or right. Sometimes the camera angles can be unhelpful too: Usually every move is shot face on but sometimes a side view is more appropriate, depending on the move.",1459900800,31,1022,4.538043478260869

8743410,1,B018YMUSRU,"Im familiar with Essentrics and feel they are valuable in concept. I am not happy with this work out because there is too much explanation. She slows down the exercise by exhaustively giving way too much direction for first timers. By the second viewing, her explanations interfere with the work out. I get so frustrated by her explanations I no longer use it.
The solution would be to provide an introductory explanation that could be skipped once you understand.",1517875200,,464,4.886075949367089
8743411,5,B018YMUSRU,I love these workouts and its great to see Miranda's daughter taking her classical stretch to another level.  As a mom of young ones this workout is perfect to fit in at home and the results are amazing!  You move around a lot more than in say yoga and pilates (i'm a runner and like to move!) and you really feel every muscle being stretched and worked.  It's been over 2 years of doing these and her mothers workouts and I'm still challenged every time.  I look forward to seeing more essentrics video from all the trainers down the road and hope there is more to come soon!,1516060800,3,576,4.305555555555555
8743412,1,B018YMUSRU,"I put this into my computer and the computer immediately died.  unable to recover.  I think it has malware or a virus.  Took me so long to get another machine up an running, then it is too late to return or replace.  Addendum:

The company wrote to offer a refund or replacement. Kudos to them for trying to make it right.",1510012800,,322,4.213114754098361

8743416,5,B018YMUSRU,"I really enjoy this workout.  I feel stronger and more flexible.  The only thing I think would make it better is another person on the video, so when Sahra is explaining the moves and the mistakes to avoid, we could be watching someone else do the exercise.  It would help to keep it flowing.
This is my favorite Essentrics workout.",1491177600,3,332,4.5
