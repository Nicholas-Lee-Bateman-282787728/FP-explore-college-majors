8433074,5,B004KLE38A,"Beautiful in blu-ray, the result of stunning restoration, which one of the extras explains in detail.
It is a very interesting historical record, part-documentary, part-art film, and is appropriately slow-paced!",1456790400,,211,6.066666666666666
8433075,5,B004KLE38A,"An INCREDIBLE film and I was truly humbled by the incredible exploration of such brave men lead by the self-effacing and courageous Captain Scott.  A must see if you want to see how it really was for them back then and what they achieved without any modern transport, warmth or comfort.  An incredible tough voyage of discovery for the benefit of all mankind.",1423180800,,359,4.682539682539683
8433076,5,B004KLE38A,"It's an awesome film . Probably better than a  milllenial account of Scott's ill-fated South Pole Expedition  disaster . ...  . It combines raw nature, sweeping photography for 1910 or any time.  The score is wonderful and carries along the joys and sorrows of the human beings among the crystal ice formations and seas  .",1420070400,,322,4.781818181818182
8433077,4,B004KLE38A,I've been working my way through 1001 must see movies. THis was really cool.,1416960000,2,76,4.5
8433078,1,B004KLE38A,"I didn't see it as you only offered it in Region 2 format, which we can not use in the United States. The US is a Region 1 format. There isn't anywhere on the product page that states what format it is in. Why don't you offer it in a Region 1,(one), format. You are losing the whole US market for sales, or at least , offer it to rent online. Contact BFI and see what they say. Films were meant to be SEEN ! why the difficulty in this day and age to limit WHERE it's seen !",1414972800,2,473,3.787878787878788
8433079,5,B004KLE38A,What these fellows went through to explore the South Pole is just unbelievable. Worth watching.,1413417600,,95,5.4
8433080,5,B004KLE38A,"During 1994, I was glued to PBS in order not to miss an episode of ""The Last Place on Earth."" That's a miniseries about the race between the Norwegians and the British to be the first team to reach the South Pole.  The loser was Captain Scott - on the British side.  Yes, he did make it to the South Pole (second) but never came back alive; his team was engulfed in a ferocious ice storm. To the English, his courage is legendary.

I did not know that there exists film of parts of the actual journey.  Restored using different tints, this restoration is among the most breathtaking footage on screen.  This is the real deal - as exciting as the footage of the exploration of the moon. I don't think I can ""ever"" forget some of the moments captured on film 100 years ago such as the picture of an ice cavern called ""Aladdin's Cave"" and the wolf pack attack of killer whales on a lone seal who was saved by the explorers.

Superlatives are the only way I can describe this DVD/Blu Ray. Although some of the music chosen for this silent film is a strange choice, it is the image and the history that counts.",1328313600,14,1105,4.288461538461538
