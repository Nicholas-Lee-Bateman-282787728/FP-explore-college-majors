8169176,4,B000GDECYQ,"Voyeur Beach is the unrated version of Watchful Eye, containg more scenes than the ""R"" rated movie. Sure it's still softcore, but Voyeur Beach does have some full frontal nudity, and if you like Renee Rea (Fast Lane to Vegas/Malibu) she's one of the sexy women in this film. The movie is basically about this house on the beach where couples are being watched as they have sex. There's some suspense at the end but not enough to make it a major thriller. So if you're into movies like Digital Sex, or any of those ""Cinemax-type"" late night movies you may want this one.",1158969600,9,569,4.480769230769231
