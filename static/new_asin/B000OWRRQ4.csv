I found this DVD at a pawn shop for $1 in the bargain bin. Having watched one of the original Bibleman series (NOT Powersource) episodes on YouTube and loving it, I just had to buy it because it was only a buck and I knew from the episode I saw on YouTube that it would easily make that purchase worth it ten times over

And oh man, it was. The campiness that's worse than the 1960s Batman TV series, the cheesy writing and special effects that could be made with templates and even MSPaint (See the WBIG employee's rays. It's the spray can effect in MSPaint). It was all there in all of it's beauty.

Buy a small pizza and get some friends together. This is truly a fantastic experience of zealous so-bad-it's-good propaganda, right up there with Sharknado and Garbage Pail Kids The Movie.",1485561600,,889,4.408536585365853

8187119,5,B000OWRRQ4,"I love Bibleman movies.  He always shows the kids what you do when you are in trouble, you go to the Bible and speak what God says about the situatiion!  Novel idea, amen?  Anyhow, my children's church class loves Bibleman, and I love that he loves the Bible.  So many Christian movies seem to be produced by folks that have never read the Bible, or may be just read part of it, as they ad lib so much.  Bibleman helps kids deal with real life situations.",1336521600,5,455,4.244186046511628
8187120,4,B000OWRRQ4,"This DVD was a bit cheesy in my opinion, but my kids love it.  They really like the action.  This is a good alternative if you don't want to go the normal super hero route.  I liked it because it uses scripture to solve problems.  The heroes in this go to the Bible for their answers.",1319328000,3,284,4.017857142857143
