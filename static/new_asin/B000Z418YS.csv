8234733,5,B000Z418YS,"Any Sherlock Holmes fan or ""who-done-it"" devotee will love this particular Sherlock Holmes film! Completely restored and digitally remastered, this version shows Holmes' softer side with Watson instead of his usual amount of disdain. Maybe it is because all of the mystery and intrigue taking part aboard a whizzing train, but I found that the air of claustrophobia and mystique that such an element (as a train) lent to the film was sheer brilliance! There is also the many twists at the end that leave any viewer breathless aboard the train of mystery.  The basic premise is as such, when the Star of Rhodesia diamond is stolen on a London to Edinburgh train and the son of it's owner is murdered, it is all up to Sherlock Holmes to discover which of his suspicious fellow passengers is responsible. With a wonderful cast, superb writing and oodles of intrigue, the only thing I did not like about this Sherlock Holmes installment was how short it seems to be!",1429488000,,962,4.7604790419161676
