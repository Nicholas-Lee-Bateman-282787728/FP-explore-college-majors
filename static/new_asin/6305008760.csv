7880464,4,6305008760,"The half-dozen shorts in KINO's seventh volume of SLAPSTICK ENCYCLOPEDIA contain some incredible non-stop action.

CONTENTS--

TEDDY AT THE THROTTLE--  Features real life couple Wallace Beery and Gloria Swanson. Bobby Vernon, who courts two ladies, wears more eye makeup than both of them combined. If Beery can prevent Vernon from marrying Swanson by doing so himself, she will get Bobby's inheritance (as will Wallace, by marriage). Gloria is later rescued from the railroad tracks by a dog named Teddy.

CIRCUS TODAY--  Sepia-toned short stars Aussie Billy Bevan and Scotsman Andy Clyde. The circus ringmaster encourages Bevan to perform some dangerous stunts. Billy even pilots a runaway wagonful of caged lions. After crashing, the cats escape; what follows are some of the most unusual interactions between actors and a lion ever filmed.

WATER WAGONS--  Racing boat captain Andy Clyde's daughter is a roadster speed demon and stunt motorcyclist. These two plus a ""correspondence school sailor"" named Percy attempt to win a water race. Their efforts are hampered by a cheating competitor. Clyde also cameos as a jug-swigging fisherman.

OUT BOUND--  A Jack White ""Cameo Comedy"" starring Sid Smith and Cliff Bowes. Matthew (Bowes) collides with his ex-boss's touring car and is brought to the man's home. Mortimer (Smith) is a newly hired trucker who accidentally hooks Matthew's sick bed on his rig's forklift. Some truly inspired sight gags follow.

CHASING CHOO CHOOS--  Monty Banks short was edited from his feature, ""Play Safe."" Monty rescues a girl from a gang of thugs; she and the pursuing bad guys hop a freight train. Monty catches up to it by using a fruit peddler's horsecart and a racing car; the gang chases him across the tops of the cars. Includes some impressive stunts by Banks (and others).

DANGER AHEAD--  A Hairbreadth Harry short--  After Harry retrieves Beautiful Belinda's bag of gold coins from Ruthless Rudolph and his trio of goofy goons, he must battle them atop a moving train. But the chase doesn't end there! Film utilizes witty intertitles and clever split-screen photography.
