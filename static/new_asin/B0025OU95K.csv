8351160,4,B0025OU95K,A decent video dealing with a subject most people would shy away from.  This movie could easily be expanded and remade into a longer version and would be equally if not more interesting.,1354838400,,186,4.636363636363637
8351161,1,B0025OU95K,"This video is perhaps the shallowest and silliest story that I could imagine, delivered by unskilled actors who clearly were not interested in what they were doing.  There is no plot.  There is no believable character development, dialog or circumstance.  It is not erotic, it is not interesting, and it fails to accomplish little else than to waste the time of anyone viewing it.  The cliches and stereotypes are only dulled by the presumption that there will finally be something in the video that couldn't have been written by a 12-year old, but alas, like Godot, meaning never comes to this hackneyed excuse for a ""story"".  The one aspect that I enjoyed was the woodenness of the actors and the way in which they delivered their lines that was so amateurish that I felt re-assured that someday I, too, might be able to have a movie career.",1267056000,8,843,4.707482993197279

And a good ending.",1251158400,2,89,3.736842105263158
