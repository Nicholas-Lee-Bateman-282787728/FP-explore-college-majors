8416108,5,B0044LYRFK,"Boys Life 7 is pretty much like the other Boys Life DVD's. There are 4 short films, a given. Just like the rest there really is nothing special about each film. I am a person that likes to collect DVD's so I purchased this one. Was it worth the purchase. Really no. I watched it once and will more than likely not watch it again. Of course was the purchase of the other Boys Life DVD's worth it not really, I have watched them once and will not really watch them again unless I am hard up to watch something on DVD.",1298246400,3,515,4.0588235294117645
8416109,3,B0044LYRFK,"On the latest compilation of short gay films from Strand Releasing, there are four films, which I'll rate individually:

In THE YOUNG AND EVIL (2008), a sexually aggressive and troubled African-American young man seduces an HIV educator in hopes of being infected by him.  Obviously, very dark and not a crowd pleaser, but well done, for what it is.  (4 stars out of 5)

SPOKANE (2004) is perhaps the most mainstream of the four films.  A gay man comes home to be in his brother's wedding, and spends the rest of the evening hanging out with one of his brother's straight buddies. They do a lot of drinking, get high, go to a strip club and end up at the gay man's hotel room. Uh oh.  (3 stars out of 5)

FIRST DATE (2006) is a rather disturbing (There is no other word to describe it) film about an ex-con who steals a car to keep a date he made online with a 16 year old boy.  (1 star out of 5)

The only foreign film in the group is RAW LOVE (Amor Crudo) (Argentina, 2008), a rather innocent look at two teenage boys coming of age, finishing high school, and dealing with a crush one clearly has on the other.  Spanish with English subtitles.  (3 stars out of 5.)

With just four (and rather dark) shorts, with a combined running time of only 80 minutes, this is recommended only for avid fans of gay shorts.",1293667200,6,1311,4.284552845528455
8416110,5,B0044LYRFK,"I am happy to see that ""Spokane"" will be in Boys Life 7.  I saw it a few years ago at Sundance.  It was very tense!  I was able to see the sex scene quite well, and all I can say is that it was pretty hot, especially that guy from the t.v. show ""Worst Week"".  It wasn't your typical gay film.  I can't wait to see it again, along with all the others.",1286064000,7,350,3.675675675675676
