1920411,4,B0000D0YXT,"Yes, this movie isn't for everyone.  Anyone who knows Bruce LaBruce, knows these are the kind of movies he makes.  You don't watch this particular film for its cinematography or stunning dialogue- frankly, you watch it for the porn.  And if you have skinhead fetish, this will definitely satisfy it.  It IS hardcore and rough, and I really did enjoy it (many times).  It sounds like some of the people that reviewed this film were expecting something more ""indie"" or ""low-budget"" kind of movie.  Well, it is indie and low-budget, but it's a porn movie, NOT a regular movie (though I think it is masked as one from the descriptions).

This is LaBruce's first hardcore porn aside from the other ""softer"" ones.  There is one particular violence scene where the group of skinheads break into a salt-and-pepper couple's home and torture them.  That did make my jaw drop thinking ""can they really show that?""  But then you realize what you're watching and not take it too seriously.

All in all, it was really campy, bad dialogue, bad acting, but fantastic looking men, and steamy scenes, with an actually decent soundtrack behind it.  So, if you're into skinhead sex, this is for you.",1136246400,27,1179,4.782178217821782
1920412,1,B0000D0YXT,"This isn't LaBruce's first film by any means, but he certainly hasn't learned anything along the way.  A potentially interesting concept is ruined by laugh-aloud acting, purile dialogue, and absolutely no sense of pacing or development.  The scenes of brutality are jaw-droppingly amateurish.  These punks are supposed to be threatening?  Good grief, I can get more rage out of my high school theater students.  How this man manages to keep finding backers is the most intriguing thing about the 71-minute ""film.""",1131235200,4,513,5.283950617283951

1920445,4,B0000D0YXT,"This movie was very interesting. I thought the story line was okay, some of the scenes were very hot, but the director really guards against showing the completion of the sexual act, i.e. the money shots. Other than that, it was an interesting movie. I wish you could have a moment to actually focus on the sex but there are so many cut aways from the sex scenes and then cuts back to the sex scenes that it can be a little disorienting sometimes. Maybe that's what was intended. I hope this director, although he wants to be known simply as an artist, realizes that profit for his work is also important and he will begin to incorporate extended scenes that actually show the beauty of the bodies colliding and allows the artistic viewer to actually see the completion, in its entirety, of the act between the actors.",1256515200,4,818,4.533783783783784

1920449,3,B0000D0YXT,"I honestly had no idea what I was getting when I got this movie, reccomended to me from someone else, I went on that and bought it, I was absolutely shocked when I started watching it.

Very graphic sexually, and the slurs are a little hard to hear constantly but some of the scenes are pretty darn hot and the music in it is actually pretty good..

If your into the more obscure cultish flicks, and like Bruce La Bruce and Steve Masters, then you'll probably think this movie is ok.

thats all I can really say about this flick..

Worth owning? No...

Worth watching at least once? yes...",1172448000,8,589,4.36697247706422
1920450,3,B0000D0YXT,"I rented this film, thinking it was a bad-ass kind of gang film.

Therefore, I was extremely surprised when all the gay sex started kickin' in.

The sex scenes were awfully realistic and long; I would classify this film as a violent porn film.

For a straight person like me, it was an eye-opener--really intense stuff.

I felt like I took a peep into the world of gay sex.

The film was good, as an experience.",1143244800,11,411,4.355263157894737

7999718,5,B0000D0YXT,"This film is hot. I have been a long fan of Bruce La Bruces films for a long time and this may not be my favorite but my god is it one sexy film. There is a story and they do argue about politics...the kind skinheads seem to like to talk about ; of hitler loving silliness but i am sorry it went over me the me the skinheads were so hot and the graphic sex scenes were so e=xciting that i didn't care about anything else. There is a clockwork orange scene wear the break into a place with a gay couple that lives there to mess them up , one back one white but it just turns into an orgy.
Like i said I am a big fan of Mr Labruces films, so lets get to that. Like i said before there is a Clockwork Orange feel to it which is fun. The skinheads just hangout talk silly politics and follow Hitler to suck silly extremes that its not offensive its fun. They jerk off to Minkumf (sp). One of the skin heads have a back off with a man in a public bathroom the skin follows him home and decides that his house is the next place they are going to attack. Once there they see he has a black boyfriend and they will fight back so lets have an orgy. It doesn't happen =exactly like that but you get the idea. If you enjoy Mr Labruces films this is a must.  And to all the boys out there i have to say this is a sexy film.",1443139200,2,1311,3.837638376383764

7999722,5,B0000D0YXT,"""Skin Flick"" is another of Canada`s own (and proud of him!) Bruce LaBruce's low-budget, high interest films, unpredictable and funny-savage at the same time. The movie, a less hardcore, less gritty version of ""Skin Gang"" (but still quite tough!) is about skinheads (as, indeed, several of LaBruce's films involve skinheads or punks) and their conflicted love-and-loathing for themselves and for each other as well as for ""non-skins"". There are rough tensions, violence, and even murder; the lattermost occurs when two non-skinhead gay mixed race male lovers get the upper hand in the scene of their struggle with the skinheads who have been bashing both (and raping the black one while hurling racist insults at and about him), thus ""turning the tables"" on their assailants. For all of that, and as part of it all, there is much entertainment and quirkiness, too (the latter the more so since, at film's end, the black dude of the two lovers who had been bashed, despite his traumatic experience, still dangerously is ogling skinhead and otherwise toughly proletarian boy-flesh whom he encounters along the way, in passing, on the crowded sidewalk).

The film`s action can be difficult to follow at some points as the camera changes views quickly, especially in the scuffle which results in the murder, where it can be hard to tell who does what to whom. It is recommendable to read the synopsis of the film (with a substantial, but really misconceivedly too-negative) review by Jos Arroyo, as they appear on the B.F.I.'s (British Film Institute`s) WWW site, either before seeing the film (if one does not mind having the action ""given away"" beforehand) or afterwards (to clear up questions that might occur while having watched it).

The guys in the cast are physically attractive, each in his own way, and they most surely know how to look good buck-naked (and exceedingly ""well endowed"" in rising and full tumescence) to copulate with considerable vigour and flair. The rough (and sometimes a bit cheap) film-making does not compromise any of that, one may rest assured!

NOTA BENE (added July 2013). At the time of writing this review, I had not seen Bruce LaBruce's ""hard-core"" (i.e. uncensored) version, titled ""Skin Gang"". Until recently it was only available from Europe, thus on DVD encoding the PAL format. Now, however, ""Skin Gang"" is available, since 2012, in all of its hard-core grit and glory from Channel 1 Releasing (mostly a outright porn outfit) as part of its ""All Worlds Premium Collection"". The difference between ""Skin Flick"" and the much grittier, more intensely but very roughly sexy ""Skin Gang"" is far more marked that ever I would have guessed. Frankly, to such marvellously, erotically ""hot"" effect, with so much supercharged, orgiastic energy, ""Skin Gang"" is a ""mind-bendingly"" transgressive and powerful film in a way that ""Skin Flick"", by comparison (although alone that), could seem only to imply! The sex scenes in ""Skin Gang"" (always with condoms used, even for rape) are much longer; they comprise an higher percentage of the total playing time than the corresponding bits in ""Skin Flick"" do so.

The degree to which ""Skin Gang"" portrays the bonding power of the skinhead gang's now rough-and-tumble, now tenderly submissive gay bouts of lust, and even love, creates a sexually more powerful (as well as, of course, more explicitly raw) bond between the young men portrayed that ""Skin Flick"", by contrast, only implies, compared to the hard-core version. On the other hand, the action of ""Skin Flick"" moves along more smoothly and quickly, with superior narrative pacing, not being bogged down in so much raw ""XXX"" footage, thus telling the story more directly and efficiently. The two versions really are quite different works of art, ""Skin Flick"" being more akin to alternative cinema and thus perhaps of more interest to the wider heterosexual public, ""Skin Gang"" (which exerts a magnetically primal appeal to gay men) being more nearly a specimen of gay pornography (except that Bruce LaBruce, a consummate artist, achieves a level of inspiration and of emotive and yet still narrative power from which very little porn tends to benefit).

Alas, Channel 1 Releasing provides no subtitles, in English or otherwise, but the British working-class accents and the feigned neo-Nazified German one, to the extent that they even are present, are not likely to be a barrier for most North American viewers; after all, bear in mind that Bruce LaBruce is a loyally Canadian director! Get both ""Skin Gang"" and ""Skin Flick"", now that it is so much easier to have the two films for home playback in the Dominion of Canada and in the U. S. of A.",1315094400,2,4670,5.0206451612903225
7999723,4,B0000D0YXT,"Actually tried to order Skin Gang, which is apparently unavailable. This movie has hot, heavily edited, HEAVILY edited, sex scenes with skin head types, with each other and an inter-racial couple. This dvd is hot, but always pulls back or ""lower screens"" out the best parts, i.e. the money shots. Heavy foreplay, as opposed to the actual act.",1296432000,,342,4.913793103448276
