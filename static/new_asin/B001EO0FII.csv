3556468,5,B001EO0FII,"For those of you that like FMP, you'll love Fumoffu. It is pretty much just a high school love comedy. It's FMP minus the mecha and evil dudes. It's pretty over the top, but way fun. The animation is just as good if not a bit better, and the soundtrack is also great. In Fumoffu there are also some new and colorful characters introduced. We also get the pleasure of seeing new sides to some of the old ones. I simply love FMP Fumoffu and I hope you do too.",1353888000,2,457,4.088888888888889

3556475,5,B001EO0FII,"These cartoons are like the ""further adventures of Sosuke and Kaname"".  These stories expand upon Sosuke's time at Jindai high school and are very funny.  The rugby episode is one of my favorites.  :-D

If you haven't seen the first complete series, do that first, then come back to this one.  Otherwise, this one won't make a whole lot of sense.

This set has both blu-ray and DVD discs.  The blu-ray discs have the cartoons in 1080p format, but the cartoon was originally in 4:3 so it centers the video with black bars on the right and left sides of the frame.  I ended up using Handbrake software to convert and save them to my computer in mp4 format.  This crops the video and removes the bars.",1453161600,4,698,4.433070866141732

3556478,5,B001EO0FII,"One of the most beloved animes of the 21st century.
This was a spin-off of the original Full Metal Panic, which was a much more somber affair.
That series(highly recommended as well) follows a futuristic militaristic setting - all action and seriousness.
It became so popular that fans wanted more, and many asked for something a bit more light-hearted.
So the decision-makers complied, and this was what became of it.
It is a lampoon/slap-stick side to the characters and storyline.
I don't want to spoil too much, but it follows the story of an adolescent boy, who grew up in the military, so all he knows is a command and conquer way of life, which bleeds to his personal life when he is ordered to infiltrate a high-school and go under cover as a normal boy, while secretly trying to protect a girl in that school, and thus mishaps and hilarity ensue.",1440720000,3,855,4.631578947368421

8299002,5,B001EO0FII,"Fumoffu is arguably one of the (if not) best slapstick comedic anime of all time and I dare someone to argue with me about it. It is a short and sweet 13 episode long show starring Sousuke Sagara and Kaname Chidori from the original FMP show, going through their high school shenanigans. For those who loved the feel and tone of the first season, Fumoffu will not satisfy your needs as far as mech-action and story, because they are non-existent in this show. This anime focuses on comedy and I must say it is genuinely funny. I am not one that is particularly fond of high school romance anime mainly because at times it comes across very cheesy and predictable, but what I love about Sousuke's and Kaname's  relationship in the show is that they are clearly meant to be together but they don't need to engage in romantic situations for the audience to feel their connection towards one another. They're friends who simply care about each other and you don't need anymore than that.

The comedy in this show ranges from slapstick, to satire and situational humor. What fumoffu does is make everyday high school situations, like studying for tests, relationships with teachers, joining after school clubs, and of course dealing with crushes and spinning them into how an anti-social military case like Sousuke would deal with it. Another thing I would have to praise this show for is the English dub. Back in the early 2000's ADV originally casted the dub and every character is wonderfully represented here. And just to keep things consistent, everybody from the first season reprises their roles in fumoffu. All I can say is that if you're a fan of anime, comedy or both you should definitely check it out!",1505692800,,1708,4.747474747474747
