3644181,4,B001HUHBB8,"You are about to witness the second and final season (1967-1968) of Quinn Martin's sci-fi series ""The Invaders"", produced by Alan Armer and whose new associate producer named David W. Rintells revises the series' original concept by introducing a team of experts called ""The Believers"", led by financier/industrialist Edgar Scoville (played by Kent Smith) who support the struggle of architect David Vincent (played by Roy Thinnes).

A new team of composers popsup under the direction of jazzman Duane Tatro who writes six scores. A fine writer named Laurence Heath (former ""Mission: Impossible"" writer and story consultant) puts to pen four scripts: the mind control intrigue ""Condition: Red"" (guest starring Jason Evers, Antoinette Bower and Mort Mills), the Soviet-oriented plot ""The Captive"" (guest starring Fritz Weaver and Dana Wynter), ""Counterattack"" (guest starring Anna Capri and Lin McCarthy) and perhaps' the season most challenging story ""The Life Seekers"" (guest starring Barry Morse and Diana Muldaur) in which David Vincent meets a couple of pacifist  invaders willing to reform the politics of their society.

Find a selection of shocking episodes dealing with mental cruel acts as ""Valley of the Shadow"" (an entire town is reprogrammed to forget the presence of the invaders, guest starring Nan Martin, Harry Townes and Joe Maross), ""Dark Outpost"" (in which four students are brainwashed to see one of them executed in different ways, guest starring William Sargent, Andrew Prine and Whit Bissell), ""The Possessed"" (in wich an alien conditions the brain of a scientist to kill at will as a Pavlov's dog, guest starring Michael Tolan, Michael Constantine and William Smithers), ""The Pit"" (in which the invaders fashion a dream machine to turn scientists into madmen inside a Research Center, guest starring Charles Aidman, Joanne Linville and Donald Harron) and ""The Pursued"" (the unofficial sequel to ""The Mutation"" in which a female invader is the victim of a failed experiment and cannot control her wild impulses, guest starring Suzanne Pleshette, Dana Elcar and Will Geer). Two episodes try to depict the true form of the invaders: ""The Spores"" (guest starring Gene Hackman) which makes a veiled reference to alien seed pods from Don Siegel's ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" and ""The Enemy"" (guest starring Richard Anderson).",1225411200,23,2348,5.375

Roy Thinnes stars in the second and final season of the excellent science fiction drama series developed by Larry Cohen called The Invaders.  For those of you not familiar with this franchise, the premise deals with one man's discovery of and subsequent battle with malevolent aliens who appear human on the surface.  The show combines elements of Quinn Martin's chase series The Fugitive with concepts developed in prior films like I Married A Monster From Outer Space and Invasion Of The Body Snatchers.

There are 26 episodes on 7 DVDs to be released in region 1 January 27, 2009.  Extras at this writing most likely will include individual show introductions recorded this year by Roy Thinnes in New York City.  Roy is a New Yorker now and working on matters to do with his artwork.

Some major character actors appear in the second season of the series, including Gene Hackman as an alien ""seed salesman""; Fritz Weaver as an Iron Curtain ambassador; Carol Lynley as a collaborator with the aliens; R.G. Armstrong makes his second appearance this time as a cop; Diana Muldaur as a ""good"" alien; Michael Rennie makes another appearance as an alien posing as a Scandinavian ambassador; Ed Asner appears once again, this time playing a corrupt father; Richard Anderson of Perry Mason and Six Million Dollar Man fame stars as an alien who learns about human emotions and pain; and Suzanne Pleshette of The Birds and Bob Newhart fame reprises her role (of a sort) as an ""emotional"" alien. Many other key actors of that classic era of television make appearances, including Ed Begley, Wayne Rogers (who later found fame in M*A*S*H) and Laurence Naismith to name a few.

The show is known for having prioritized drama over special effects, with adult, plausible scripts.  As with most, if not all Quinn Martin productions, the show took itself very seriously, with little humor and much melodrama.  The music, primarily fueled by Dominic Frontiere's enigmatic theme, often propelled the show.  The special effects were sparse, but intelligently done.  The most famous visual elements were the alien immolation death scenes and the somewhat rare but trademark classic flying saucer appearances.

Season 2 is also notable for more adult themes, specifically some politics (""Summit Meeting"" Part 1 and 2) and revealing banter in a court case (""The Trial"").  Some scenes might be considered humorous by today's audiences.  An example would be a scene in ""The Pit"" where a group of aliens bang their famous unbendable fourth fingers on the glass of a phone booth.  Nevertheless, the show is solid drama with an interesting mix of science fiction elements.

The price for this set is VERY reasonable compared to most other classic series being released.  In fact, the price in Amazon's current pre-order (as of this writing) is $2 less than Season 1's 5 disc set.

The colors are rich and somewhat ""technicolor"" in appearance.  While the mastering is from electronic sources as opposed to the original 35mm film elements, the episodes are clean intact as originally broadcast, averaging 51 minutes each, unlike many hour-long series of today, which range from about 42 to 44 minutes on average.

All in all, an excellent investment for a great show that met a premature end in 1968.",1225152000,75,5392,5.200923787528868

3644201,3,B001HUHBB8,"The Invaders - Season 1 [0574 - 11-11-2014 - TV show - SF]
Summary:

Although these comment were written for Season 1 they apply to Season 2 which I had purchased and watched in it's entirety 09-16-2015.

  First off this is a 1960's Science-Fiction TV series concerned solely with the apparent clandestine invasion by alien beings from outer space - which look - talk - dress and behave like middle class folks you would encounter in any town in the 60's. Architect David Vincent (Roy Thinnes) is apparently the only person in the United States who truly believes the space aliens have invaded and travels from coast to coast and points between to frustrate the invaders depraved goal of world domination. In each episode David encounters and put a stop to their shenanigans - with the help of local folks who, after encountering the aliens and witnessing them turn a glowing red and disappear when killed still doubt their existence.

Content & Packaging:
5 disks - 17 episodes - first shown on ABC from 1/10/67 to 5/9/67. Season 1 is packaged in the standard, snap case - episode summaries are printed in the reverse of the cover insert - not very handy since you have to jimmy the disks to read the text. - The most interesting ""extra"" is the Roy Thinnes introduction to each episode.

Positive Comments:
 The show features many 1960's TV stars in supporting roles.
 Some of the locations are visually interesting but there is not mention in the credits where it is.
 The video quality is very good - colors are true and vivid.

The Cast:
Even with the farmiliar faces in supporting roles none stand out in these dramas. Roy Thinnes is very good in a most difficult role - he had to convince us viewers that the aliens were real but ""somehow"" could not convince anyone else - think about that for a moment.

Negative Comments: (honestly there are so many but here are a few)
 The major failure of this show is that the creative talent - writers - producers - directors never bothered to even attempt to convince the viewer that David Vincent's efforts are credible and even marginally believable. I see it as contempt by them for the intelligence of their target viewer.
 Here we have an unemployed architect traveling all over the country - one week in Florida - next New England - then the mid-west (all suspiciously looking like southern California) - clutching a newspaper article about a strange event - finding the exact persons causing the mischief (aliens of course) defeating their nefarious scheme and musing that no one still believes him.
 How does he obtain the funds to travel all over the country? - He has no employment or benefactor and is not, by appearance or life style, wealthy. Also how does he obtain the newspaper items with the oddball occurrences from all over the United States?
 The aliens are fully aware that David Vincent is their sworn enemy - in fact Vicent has had many conversations with the space people and even was taken for a ride one of their saucers.
 Since he is such a thorn in the alien's side and they are aware that no one believes him why not just eliminate him - Vincent's efforts have resulted in the death of numerous aliens just in season 1 - so payback would be only fair.
 We have been informed in several episodes that the aliens have no pulse. All Vincent has to do is capture one of the aliens and bring him to a hospital or doctor to get the attention that he so desperately desires - of course that never happens.
 Let us assume that Vincent can travel everywhere since he is independently wealthy and can afford a super efficient service that reviews every newspaper in the country looking for those quirky news items that hint at the alien's schemes. If so then why doesn't Vincent hire some muscle to help him. In many episodes he get pummeled by several aliens and can hardly fend them off.
 If you watch all the episodes you will see the same light blue Ford pickup truck in several shows - I mean to say what the heck those stupid viewers won't notice.
Recommendations:
Watching these shows I learned a lesson about wishful nostalgia. You see in the winter of 1967 I viewed some of the """"Invader shows are a nave teenager. Fast forward almost 50 years and I was startled to see the shows were released on DVD - well so much for what I thought was entertainment as a teen. I did watch all 17 episodes hoping for redemption but, alas, there was none to be had.
I could only recommend this show to dedicated fans of early TV series and/or SF shows.",1442361600,3,4513,4.563118811881188

3644208,5,B001HUHBB8,"Season two had some of the best stories of the series.  One high light was The Spores, with a misplaced suitcase of alien young. It was the funniest of the series. My husband loves suspense and paranoia.  This was his all time favorite TV show.  Some of the guest actors used in this show were Peter Graves, Gene Hackman, and Susan Pleshett.  Season two was better and more satisfying to watch than season one because sometimes David Vincent got to be the hero and didn't have to keep convincing people he wasn't crazy.

3644216,5,B001HUHBB8,"This show made its premier in the January 1967 when I was a mere lad of 11. Having quickly tired of Lost In Space which in my young mind had taken a complete dip from reality and had turned into what my mother referred to as ""getting wackier by the week,"" this show was refreshing to say the least! The drama was serious and the acting stupendous! Even my mother who was not a big fan of science fiction was drawn to this show. As she would say to me: ""When is that David Vincent show coming on again? I really like that show! It's very interesting."" Irwin Allen eat your heart out! You had good ideas to be sure but somehow all your shows quickly lost both their quality and credibility. Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea became known by 1967 as being ""the new monster of the week show."" Not so with the Invaders. The plots were always intense and interesting. This show kept you guessing what the Invaders would try next. In many instances David Vincent had as much sometimes to worry about from fellow humans as he did with these alien invaders. And sometimes a friendly alien or two would come to David's side.
I always thought the special effects were far superior to the original Star Trek. And the moody music was very chilling by that same guy who wrote the music score for the original Outer Limits.
What more can one say then enjoy a show that is timeless in itself!",1363305600,,1374,4.329457364341085

The stories are great and the acting is great with many top guest stars of the day. And when the effects are good enough that even though they were created in 1968-69 they are quite effective even for modern audiences. OF course it helps that the storylines usually are about David Vincent trying to stop the aliens who look like us till they die from some plot.

But in Season Two everything simply got still better. Scripts, pacing of the stories, attention to plot and drama. Still was a show devoid of any humour (after all, the survival of human kind is at stake!), but the adrenalien and sense of doom permeating each episode make the 50 minutes of each of them to pass by on a fly.

The remastering is good (although not as good as the job done on the Irwin Allen shows) and makes for a pleasing viewing experience.

I find the show always has a certain kind of ""eeriness"" about it that keeps me glued to the episode.  In fact, some of the episodes I find downright scary.  It is this kind of emotional juggling that keeps me wanting to watch episode after episode of this series.  Roy Thinnes plays the main character David Vincent.  He is the perfect guy to play this character. He is a no-nonsense type of investigator who is usually battling the skepticism of the locals as well as the aliens.  For those who haven't seen the show, the aliens look like humans minus some of the normal characteristics (such as they don't bleed and have no pulse). Because the aliens look like humans, Vincent has a tough ""sell"" to the local residents that they are endangered by the presence of these aliens. The back and forth between the local residents and David Vincent and his confrontations with the aliens make this show one of the most suspenseful I have ever seen!!

Nice, bright colour-not filmed in a dungeon like most modern stuff-terrific stories, a chance to marvel at those spacious gas guzzlers, and guest star lists to die for.

Some have said that maybe the stories would have been more suspenseful if there had only been one alien per episode; that's a valid criticism but this is still 4-star entertainment.

3644229,5,B001HUHBB8,"Season two is the only full season of The Invaders, picking up where season one left off--Vincent is still fighting a one-man crusade against the seemingly insurmountable aliens. The first episode, ""Condition Red"", has Vincent out to prevent the beautiful wife of a NORAD bigwig (she's really an alien) from infiltrating NORAD headquarters. It's followed by two suspenseful episodes in ""The Watchers"" (a defense bigwig is being spied on by aliens at a remote Virginia lodge; in a clever bit of casting, he's played by Kevin McCarthy, who played a character similar to Vincent a decade earlier in ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"") and ""Valley of the Shadow"" (where an entire small town witnesses an alien burn up upon death; the town is then targeted for annihilation by the Invaders unless Vincent can pull off a big coup and turn back time to before the incident).

While the writers were able to come up with some decent stories for this season, the big innovation to the series comes at the midway point of the season, when Vincent meets a group of monied, high-powered people who share his belief and offer help in any way they can. They are ""The Believers"", and one of them, Edgar Scoville (played by distinguished character actor Kent Smith), appears in the series' remaining episodes.

As with many other '60's sci-fi series, The Invaders couldn't resist the urge to do topical episodes, such as ""The Captive"" (a Cold War polemic where Vincent is held hostage in the Russian Embassy with an alien), ""The Vise"" (a story about racism featuring a Black invader, played by Roscoe Lee Browne, who is about to be named to a very important government post) and ""The Peacemaker"" (a thinly-veiled anti-war story, in which a demented Air Force General, played by James Daly, appears to be more dangerous than any alien). Also, being a Quinn Martin production, a couple of episodes are set squarely in the QM crime milieu (""The Trial"", in which Vincent must clear an old friend of murdering a co-worker who may have been an alien, functions as one of the series' best stories; ""The Organization"", in which Vincent forms an uneasy alliance with the Mob, plays more like a bad FBI episode).

The special effects, as always, are spot on--the aliens still glow when they need regenerating and burn up upon death, there are some nice flying saucer effects, etc. In the episode ""The Enemy"", we even get to see an alien revert back to his original form.

One major problem with the series was that it ended very abruptly...at the end of the episode ""Inquisition"", Vincent manages to get a McCarthy-esque government attorney to join the cause (quite unconvincingly, I may add)...and that was it. No wrap-up episode, a la The Fugitive, just a lot of unanswered questions. Martin obviously grew to like the show, as he remade the pilot for his short-lived Tales of the Unexpected series (""The Nomads"" with David Birney), and did a pilot for a similar series (""The Aliens Are Coming!"") that didn't sell. George Romero's 1995 Invaders mini-series (which featured a cameo by Roy Thinnes) managed to solve the issue.

As with the first box set, Roy Thinnes introduces each episode, giving anecdotes and info about the guest stars, and also gives an interview. Again, I recommend this series.",1276732800,2,3273,4.868940754039497
3644230,3,B001HUHBB8,"I always enjoyed this show even as a boy but now, in retrospect, I can see why The Invaders was cancelled after only its second season.

For some reason, the writers decided to change the show's overall, and critical, premise - that of a man alone, persecuted, laughed at battling not only alien invaders but sceptics and disbelievers who would rather see him thrown into an insane asylum - to a new season where this same man, David Vincent, not only has a circle of co-believers around him but allies willing to collaborate in the battle.  Some of these allies are even people like Edgar Scoville, who is wealthy and well placed with many connections in both military and industrial circles and who uses these connections (without much difficulty) to assist David Vincent in the struggle.

Unfortunately, this change undermines the whole spirit of the show, for the desperation the main character had to get people to believe him is pretty much negated.  Just why the writers chose to do this I have no idea.  In addition, there are several episodes where Vincent and his allies actually collaborate with the aliens to achieve mutual ends.  One episode even has the aliens bringing a dead Vincent back to life after he is accidentally electrocuted.  Credibility is definitely stretched to the limit here.

Probably the worst episode is one featuring black aliens along with a black investigator David has managed to convert.  Inspite of some measure of obstructionism by his socially conscious black wife - who suspects reverse racism on her husband's part - this investigator remains undaunted as his suspicions about a well respected and famous black scientist continue to grow.  To his credit, he has discovered one important and distinguishing feature of this interesting new type of alien that he quickly shares with David Vincent.  He has realized that these black aliens are easily discerned from human blacks because, of all things, the palms of their hands are black too!  It almost borders on the hilarious, not to mention the stilted, unconvincing performance of the socially conscious wife and several of the black extras which can only leave viewers shaking their heads.  An obvious attempt to make the show 'socially relevant' stumbles badly.

There are also a number of actors who return to the series after appearances in the first season however none of them, if they weren't first killed off, reprise their original roles.  I consider this a mistake because opportunities to present viewers with some measure of continuity are needlessly thrown away.  The example of the alien 'leader' played by Alfred Ryder is worth noting.  In the first season he was the sinister Mr. Nexus who ruthlessly kills the human collaborator he suspects has turned against him.  In the second season he still plays a leader but is portrayed as a completely different, yet virtually identical, character and an opportunity to develop an on-going nemesis for David Vincent is, accordingly, lost.  Perhaps the writers later realized their mistake for Mr. Ryder was brought back to portray this same, new character in a subsequent episode.

Nevertheless, there are still an overabundance of good moments throughout the second season, especially the first episode where the aliens have managed to infiltrate NORAD through the wife of an air force major.  It makes for some really gripping moments.

All in all, I would still recommend this collection for interested viewers and I certainly don't regret purchasing it.",1260576000,10,3511,5.069565217391304
3644231,5,B001HUHBB8,"I enjoyed The Invaders, The First Season and
The Second Season.  This was a great TV series
which lasted for two season.  I was rather surprised
The Invaders didn't last longer. I thought it was
a great adventure seeking out the Aliens.
The Second Season was fantastic. The last episode
indicated there would be a third season.
Unfortunately, it never come to pass.

One night, David Vincent worked late in the hours
of the morning.  He decided to take a short cut
home. He was tired and took the wrong turn.
David came upon a space ship.  He contacted the
police department, they investigated, but found no
evidence of a space ship where David claimed it was.

David Vincent knew what he saw.  He took it
upon himself to investigate Aliens from another
planet.  David is looking for proof they are here,
living among us,  in human form. One problem,
they can't breath our air and need to be regenerated
back to human form, otherwise, they will incinerate.
Aliens are trying to take control of the planet by
wiping out the human race.  Their own planet is dying.

An excellent TV series in the late sixties, but the
series were all new to me.  I am astounded that the
series didn't last longer. It was exciting with a lot
of adventure not knowing who the Aliens were,
because they looked no different than the rest of us.

I recommend The First Season and The Second Season

The show is known for having prioritized drama over special effects, with adult, plausible scripts. As with most, if not all Quinn Martin productions, the show took itself very seriously, with little humor and much melodrama. The special effects were great, but intelligently done. The most famous visual elements were the alien immolation death scenes and the somewhat rare but trademark classic flying saucer appearances.

3644238,5,B001HUHBB8,"It's the second season of the show and those poor aliens still have to deal with their inability to shoot the broadside of a barn with human guns, that little problem with the finger, those fashion-challenged ugly teal-blue jumpsuits, and the relentless pursuit by that architect with obvious deep pockets, David Vincent (Roy Thinnes).  This DVD compilation of the ABC series' 1967-68 season sports some nifty intros from Thinnes, along with stunning color and sound, and an easily navigable menu, with or without introductory comments on each episode.

In the second season, Vincent is joined by an evergrowing number of ""believers,"" people that learn of the alien invasion and join him on his quest.  But those are not the only changes in the story lines: the aliens themselves expand their own human images; this season, as opposed to the predominately white males of season one, there are black aliens, more females, and even a couple of kids sporting those tell-tale extended ""pinkies.""

The stories reflect the Cold War atmosphere of the time of the show's production, along with commentary on race relations, the ""make peace, not war"" outcries of the youth, and the changing politics of America.  Though most sci-fi of the period was aimed at a younger audience, ""The Invaders"" didn't dumb down its stories, even tackling pre-marital sexual relations in one episode.

Best episodes: ""Valley of the Shadow,"" ""The Enemy,"" ""The Trial,"" ""The Spores,"" ""The Prophet,"" ""Labyrinth,"" ""The Captive,"" ""The Ransom,"" ""The Possessed,"" ""The Pit,"" ""The Organization"", ""The Miracle,"" ""The Pursued,"" and the final one of the series, ""Inquisition.""  The only complaint about the latter is that it has a bad audio transfer, resulting in a slight ""wavy"" sound.

Unlike other sci-fi shows of the decade that were dependent on elaborate sets, ""The Invaders"" added a touch of ""realism"" through its use of location shots, ranging from countrysides to shipyards to amusement parks and others.

But, a true plus is the use of a stellar cast of guest stars, which could be divided into several categories.

There are the episodic television actors and ""return players"" (those that made more than one appearance on the show): Michael Tolan, Fritz Weaver, Nancy Kovack, Andrew Prine, Pat Hingle, Ford Rainey, Don Gordon, Susan Oliver, Booth Coleman, Linden Chiles, Laurence Naismith, Katherine Justice, Harold Gould, Ed Begley, William Windom, James Callahan, John Zaremba, Susan Oliver, R.G. Armstrong, Joanne Linville, Barbara Barrie, Ian Wolfe, Janet McLachlan, Ross Elliott ( in two episodes,with and without a toupee), Ken Lynch, Roy Poole, Chris Robinson, Phyllis Thaxter, Larry Gates, Frank Marth, Charles Aidman, Lin McCarthy, Joel Fluellen, Ron Hayes, Simon Scott, in addition to James Daly (father of Tyne and Tim) and J.D. Cannon who were both featured in the '67 pilot.  Veteran Kent Smith has a recurring role as millionaire and fellow alien hunter Edgar Scoville. Alfred Ryder, himself a first-year guest star, has two turns as the alien ""leader."" Gene Lyons, John Milford, and Robert O'Brien, each, appear in two episodes in this compilation.

Then, there are the ""up-and-comers,"" those whose star would shine brighter in future film and television roles: Gene Hackman, Sally Kellerman, Dabney Coleman, Wayne Rogers, Richard Anderson, Lynda Day, Karen Black, William Smithers, Ed Asner, Ted Knight, Michael Constantine, Diana Hyland, Suzanne Pleshette, Barry Atwater, James B. Sikking, Louis Gossett, Jr., Barbara Hershey, Diana Muldaur, Will Geer, and Barry Williams, a few years shy of his debut as one of ""The Brady Bunch.""

Then, there are the ""inspired casting,"" which includes Kevin McCarthy and Dana Wynter, who themselves had battled aliens in the classic 50's ""Invasion of the Body Snathers; Michael Rennie of ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" fame; Whit Bissel, who made Michael Landon a ""teenage werewolf; Roscoe Lee Browne and Raymond St. Jacques in a landmark episode; and Dawn Wells and Russell Johnson, who managed to leave ""Gilligan's Island"" to find their way in an ""Invaders'"" tale.

Finally, there are the actors that are probably known more for their voices than their faces: cartoon voiceover actor John Stephenson (""Mr. Slate"" on ""The Flintstone"" for one); Ben Wright, heard in numerous films and television shows; Barney Phillips, another famous voice; and young Christopher Shea, who provided the voice of ""Linus"" for many of the early Charlie Brown specials.

Like the first in the series, this DVD also features an interview with Thinnes.  This time, however, the actor provides a fascinating look at the making of the series, as well as other aspects of acting and celebrity.",1238025600,7,4692,5.252673796791444
3644239,5,B001HUHBB8,One of the best Sci - FI  series on TV in the 1960 era. Ideal DVD box set for your collection.,1237420800,,94,3.4761904761904763
3644240,5,B001HUHBB8,"This was a great television series.  As a child in the late 1960's, when THE INVADERS aired in prime time, the opening credits images, narration, and music from this series continually scared me into another room.  It was not until 16 years later that I stumbled onto re-runs of the series, sadly with solitary episodes broadcast on sunday afternoons, when I rediscovered the show.  When the DVD series was released I was able to get down to some serious INVADERS mini marathons.

Season two is a full season of THE INVADERS.  As such there are a full 24 episodes against Season One's 17 episodes.  Essentially David Vincent was the Carl Kolchak, THE NIGHT STALKER, of his day.  Vincent wandered around the country painfully spreading word of the alien invasion to anyone who would listen.  In the episode, THE WATCHERS, Vincent describes himself as a crusader.

In Season Two Vincent faces many of the same obstacles he encountered in Season One with most people writing him off as a kook, while others passively support him.  With Vincent's travels around the United States one wonders how he was able to financially support himself, though in one episode we see Vincent still employed as an architect.  One of Vincent's allies is multi-millionaire industrialist Edgar Scoville.  The assumption is that Scoville is Vincent's source to finance his travels, as well as his daily existance, while pursuing the Invaders.  Vincent also has a substantial intelligence network in that he is somehow tipped off to obscure alien activity and arrives by car shortly thereafter. In each episode the aliens are generally foiled in their attempts to further their control of earth.

Unfortunately, as this was the last season of the show, there is no climactic concluding episode.  The final episode of the Season Two finds Vincent and Scoville in Washington DC only to be indicted for murder on flimsy circumstantial evidence.  As you would expect the murders are actually that of aliens who incinerate upon their deaths thus leaving only ashes.  In a special features interview Roy Thinnes explains that his character lost much of its Richard Kimble, THE FUGITIVE, similarities once David Vincent became associated with a larger organization.  If so the last episode was an opportunity to dissolve the organization and return to basics when false information implicates the believers, as they are called, and wealthy Scoville is shot.  However, by the end of the episode Vincent and Scoville are cleared of all charges and the end narration verifies that Scoville will recover from his injuries.

Essentially nothing is resolved by the unplanned final episode.

As with the first season, you can choose an option to view Roy Thinnes' introduction to the episodes.  With few exceptions these introductions offer very little in the way of insider information.  In this I do not fault Thinnes as there is a separate interview section where Thinnes does get to talk about his experiences working with Quinn Martin productions.  My disappointment with a majority of the introductions is that poor Mr. Thinnes appears to have been made to sit in one place and offer a few seconds of introduction for two seasons worth of episodes -- all in one afternoon.  His intro's are little more than a brief plot synopsis, mention of particular guest stars associated with that episode, and the original television air date of the episode.

There are some very familiar faces in terms of guest stars in Season two including Gene Hackman, William Windom, Michael Rennie, as well as Dawn Wells and Russell Johnson of GILLIGAN'S ISLAND fame.  Also look for Ted Knight both as a supporting actor in one episode, and as a control room voice in another.

THE INVADERS makes no attempt to explain much about the aliens and their plans for the earth.  We never see their true form and their technology, including saucer control panels, are very earth-like.  It is also amusing to see that an alien command post on earth is equipped with a rotary telephone.  The stories are the strength of this series.  Yes, it is great to see the aliens glow red and disappear when they are killed or seriously wounded, but the special effects are basically a byproduct of the great stories.

Without keeping too sharp a lookout you will recognize familiar shooting locations around Los Angeles including Lone Pine, a location very familiar to westerns, Star Trek, and The Rat Patrol, as well as the concrete culverts along the resevoir road at Franklin Canyon.  Franklin Canyon was a favorite location for Sergeant Saunders and his squad in COMBAT!, as well as for the opening title sequence of The Andy Griffith Show.",1237161600,2,4670,4.983225806451613
3644241,5,B001HUHBB8,"I was 10 years old when The Invaders was on TV. I wasn't really allowed to watch it - too dark, too violent, too serious for an impressionable young mind. But all the kids in school talked about it - the cool way the aliens died, the crooked little fingers, etc. So of course I had to sneak a peek a the show to see what all the fuss was about. And it was great, of course.

The Invaders never went into syndication, so that unlike a lot of the shows produced in the 60's, it was never re-run, never ended up on the ""UHF"" channels as a regular program. It remained this elusive, almost magical childhood memory of this really cool show that almost nobody I know today has ever heard of.

This DVD set of the second season, and the first season set, finally let me see the show in it's entirety. My fears about buying these sets were, ""Will the show still hold up today compared to the impression it left on my 10 year old brain? Will this ruin a childhood memory?"" Luckily, the answer to those questions are ""Yes - it holds up really well"", and ""No, the childhood memory is not ruined.""

Watching the entire series was a delight. Yes, the effects are hokey - even for it's day. Yes, sometimes the serious suffers from a loopy lack of logic (but not often). Watching the shows back to back will reveal the same props - paintings, lamps, radios, etc, used over and over again in the same sets, rearranged to look like different locations - the budget for the show must have been razor thin. But out of all it's impediments, a great, entertaining show emerges. It has a crazy, grim atmosphere of paranoia, and a deadly earnest seriousness and a complete lack of tongue-in-cheek ""camp"" that makes it rise above it's low-budget roots and makes it rock-solid entertainment.

One of the things that makes the series great for me was the guest stars - Susanne Pleshette, Ed Asner, Ed Begley, Gene Hackman, Dabney Coleman, Anne Francis, etc. Even Canadian comedian Don Harron (Charlie Farquharson) was on an episode as an alien. And the cars that David Vincent drove were always cool - mostly a parade of Mustangs and Chargers.

Roy Thinnes brought a rugged seriousness to this series. He's been criticized for being unemotional and humorless on this show, but given the character's circumstances, anything else would have read as ""camp"" or false. I have a lot of respect for Roy as an actor, and this series represents a lot of solid, hard work that he rightly remains proud of. The DVD has Roy, now in his 70s, introduce each episode, plus he has a bit of an interview on the last disc of each season set. These interviews are terrific, especially the one on the second season set. My only regret is that they could have been longer. Roy brings a great deal of personal warmth to these interviews, and when he gets on a topic that he really likes, his face lights up and you can still see the young man he was on the series shine through.

If you are new to this series, I'd have to say, take caution and ""sample"" the show first before laying out cash for the set - you'll have to see if it is to your liking. But if you are, like me, an older customer and have fond memories of the show, you can buy this set without fear that it's going to ruin your memories of the show. It really was as great as you remember.",1236470400,3,3306,4.3762214983713354

For its time, this '60s TV show is still captivating today. Although obviously produced on the cheap, it is the writing and story lines that is the back bone of this TV show. As with so many shows like ""The Invaders"", this one was produced to offer thrills not to be ignored - one man against the world - in this case one man against an alien world. Perhaps the lasting calling card of the show today is the alien's spacecraft, and the sound effect associated with the craft, which has become an iconic figure over the years by taking its place alongside all the other famous ""flying saucers"" of the '50s and '60s. The model, first offered by a Aurora, and now periodically released under the Monogram label, is still a popular seller - another example of the hot rod art direction that populated all these types of shows back then.

I am enjoying viewing these DVD's on a modern large screen HDTV played by an upward compatible DVD player. This is a much better viewing experience than watching THE INVADERS on an old B&W set in the late 60's. The picture is crisp, the colors are vibrant and the sound is excellent.

I was an addict of the THE INVADERS TV series during my third year of engineering school and felt that STAR-TREK was just another of the popular TV fads with the college crowd. Consequently, I was loyal to THE INVADERS during its first season and almost never watched STAR-TREK which was in a competing time slot.  During that first season, however, I found that the story was always going places but never really getting anywhere. Week after week we saw similar plots and after a while it started to become a bore because nobody ever believes David Vincent!.

This convinced me to abandon the series during the second season of THE INVADERS and become a STAR-TREK viewer. I am now enjoying the second season of THE INVADERS and am happy to see that the plot is permitting people to believe David Vincent! Individuals from local law enforcement, Air Force Intelligence, the US State Department and even the old Soviet Union are starting to believe THE INVADERS are here, opening up the season for much greater possibilities than the first.

3644252,4,B001HUHBB8,"One of the many great and memorable series I grew up with in the 1950s and '60s.  When I think of how many of the classic action and sci fi series I watched and loved during this period, it is mind-boggling.
CBS/Paramount has actually done a pretty good job on this set which, like season 1, includes Roy Thinnes introductions for each episode and an in-depth interview.
Now for my main complaint: I cannot understand how CBS/Paramount can do such great jobs on some shows and such poor jobs on others.  I know they can use the excuse that with some series like The Fugitive, The Untouchables and Hawaii 5-0, almost all of the cast members are deceased.  However, there have got to be some people still around to contribute to a retrospective on these series.  (We know James MacArthur of 5-0 is still around.)  However, what is the excuse with Mission:Impossible?  The entire cast, with the exception of Greg Morris, are still alive.  How can there not have been several retrospectives on this all-time classic?  CBS/Paramount added much material to the 1st. seasons of Wild, Wild West and Mannix (Robt. Conrad and Mike Connors intros, interviews, etc.)  From the second season on, nothing.
As stated, they have done a very good job with The Invaders.  But no extras on The Fugitive, Mission, the 2nd-4th seasons Of Wild Wild West, 5-0 etc. is disgraceful.
Finally with the release of such QM series as the Invaders, Fugitive, etc., when will they release one of my all-time favorite QM series, 12 O'Clock High?",1234828800,,1512,4.758620689655173
3644253,4,B001HUHBB8,"Season two of ""The Invaders"" has finally touched down at Amazon. It's with a heavy heart that one realizes that this was it,the curtain was ringing down on such a good show.
The years of 1965 and 1966 had seen a peak of interest in UFOs as they were in newspaper headlines around the world(remember Allen Hynek's famous""swamp gas"" explanation?).So while the subject matter The Invaders dealt with was a ""hot"" topic,the demographics of the folks who had the most say when it came to its'ratings(30 yrs.and up),didn't exactly warm to its'content at all. And so its' demise was rather swift but not unexpected given the times.
For those of us who ""got it"" though, this was a series to savour all the way through. A main component of this show was the paranoia factor;one man believing in and fighting against a terrible enemy,that no one else would believe in. The only other show I can compare it to in that era was ""The Fugitive' with David Jansen;an innocent man accused of something he didn't do,trying to clear his name and constantly on the run from the authorities. In The Invaders though the paranoia factor goes up a notch because it is alien invaders set to conquer the world and only he knows it and no one will believe him.
That was the case in Season One especially. In Season Two the paranoia factor lessens considerably. He finally gains allies now,either through his own work or meeting others that have also stumbled onto the alien menace. In fact he forms a cadre of believers with an industrialist Edgar Scoville,played by Kent Smith. Vincent now has friends and resources to help convince the authorities that the threat is imminent and real. And in Season Two this is just what he does. It's a slant on the theme of The Invaders that I could have seen developing naturally over two or three more seasons but it is possible that the staff of the show saw the writing on the wall very early and decided to give it everything they had for the remaining season.
Whatever the case,season two is still very entertaining and has much to recommend it. Along with the newer story line came alot more guest stars this season than last. The production values of the show remained top notch as was the acting.
Technically even though this series has not been remastered for DVD,season two is definitely of higher video quality than season one(see my review on season one for specifics).There is graininess present here(as in season one)and there are a couple of eps here with signs and book titles in a rack smudged out electronically. Other than that it isn't too bad over all. The DVD set is seven discs long this time and comes with the nice episodic commentaries by Mr. Thinnes that we've come to expect and a commentary on one ep by Alan Armer. There is also an approximately 40 minute interview with Roy Thinnes(which I look forward to seeing right after I finish this review!).Finally,a really nice and classy touch to this set is Mr. Thinnes' intro for the last ep""Inquisition"".On top of his set up,he personally thanks the fans for their support over the last 40 years.
In conclusion I would recommend this set to all of those interested in good Sci-Fi on TV.The Invaders was one of my top five favourite shows during the 1960s. I was so glad to see it come to video but have been disappointed in the series not being remastered,especially evident in season one. But the show is consistently good throughout and while season two loses a good deal of its' original paranoic ""flavour"",it still keeps you on the edge of your seat.
And while Mr. Thinnes will never read this,I just wanted to say to him,thank YOU, for doing such a wonderful job during the series run and giving me and all the fans of that wonderful show some fabulous entertainment memories that we'll never forget.",1234828800,2,3793,4.6626865671641795
3644254,3,B001HUHBB8,"It's great to now have the whole series. You get more glowing aliens in the second season as they upped the ante on the action. And just about every episode has a ""payoff"" where unbelievers are treated to the crimson demise of the invaders. It's also fun to spot b-movie actors in almost every episode who had a history in the genre (50's sci-fi movies). Whether that was intentional, or if these were simply available actors, I don't know.
I would also like to comment on the jitter problem. Yes, it is there. They could have fixed this darn it. It is totally lame that they released this set with such a glitch.",1234051200,4,613,4.433628318584071
3644255,5,B001HUHBB8,I waited patiently for season 2 to be released and it was worth it. The intros by Roy Thinnes are priceless as are his memories of filming the series. The prints are superb and the price is very good. Enjoy this fantastic set and don't forget to buy season one as well!,1233878400,2,269,4.1923076923076925
3644256,4,B001HUHBB8,"In the episodes THE ENEMY, THE POSSESSED, COUNTERATTACK, and THE VISE (which is as far as I've watched) there is noticeable ""jitter"" in the transfers, with the entire picture skipping upwards in a rhythmic fashion like skipping a film reel sprocket. It's most noticeable in act 4 and epilogue of THE POSSESSED. Another person on a DVD forum who has the region 4 DVD set says his does the same thing. I've pointed this out on several forums and got this response from someone who knows the DVD's producer:

""I was told the restoration was done to the electronic version of the show, meaning the original telecine transfer must have had that flaw, which could only be corrected if the 35 mm prints were accessible.  Unfortunately, the prints apparently are not available.  No one can tell me what happened to them, let alone the original 75 minute pilot.  From what I heard from the production executive for the DVDs, the source material they worked from was electronic, so it's most likely U-matic or 1 inch master reels of magnetic tape.  They cleaned up what they could, but apparently could not correct the jitter situation.""

I would think Paramount would've noticed this and since it's only present on a few episodes might have spent the extra coin to fix it. This flaw doesn't ruin the whole set for me but it IS annoying. Most of the shows look pretty good.",1233619200,5,1363,4.682008368200837
3644257,5,B001HUHBB8,"I have bought both seasons of the Invaders.  Isn't it funny that with 26 HOUR long shows in the second season that the ENTIRE season fits onto 7 dvds, when Paramount can't fit FULL seasons of Gunsmoke, The Untouchables, The Fugitive, and all the other half season dvds out there?",1233446400,2,279,4.58
3644258,4,B001HUHBB8,"When you heard that announcement if you were a kid in the mid-60's you knew you were in for an entertaining hour of television.

The second and final season of ""The Invaders"" features 26 episodes from the season presented in a very nice transfer from the original 35mm prints. Although there are speckles and occasional bits of dirt/debris, the show looks extremely good with a sharp looking transfer with vibrant color.

The second season arrives with introductions from actor Roy Thinnes who played architect David Vincent who accidently witnesses the landing of aliens from another planet with an agenda to terra form our planet into one for them. We also get an audio commentary from writer Alan Armer on ""The Peacemaker"", a second round of interviews with Thinnes.

As with all Quinn Martin (""The Fugitives"", ""The Streets of San Francisco"" among other shows)productions ""The Invaders"" has top notch production values, a strong group of guest stars including Fritz Weaver. The series had a paranoid vibe missing from many other shows of the era that set it apart and clearly was an inspiration for ""The X-Files"".

The second season changes the plot a bit with Vincent able to bring on board a millionaire and others to his cause. He's no longer alone which actually increases his chances of success.",1233273600,4,1303,4.963302752293578
3644259,5,B001HUHBB8,God I love this show its about time I was too small to remember all of them and very rarely aired in syndication every episode is a real treat. GREAT COLOR AND SOUND LOOKS LIKE IT WAS MADE YESTERDAY!GOD BLESS YA ROY THINNES!,1233100800,4,224,4.232558139534884
3644260,5,B001HUHBB8,"The Invaders would definitely be at or near the top of the list of television shows that ended way before their time. That list has many science fiction series on it (the original Star Trek being one among many), but this series stands out because of its great production values (for the time), great performances, and the air of paranoia that shows like this must have to be believable.

Roy Thinnes played David Vincent, an otherwise ordinary fellow, an architect by profession, who happens to make the horrible discovery that we have been invaded by beings from another planet who have taken the appearance of being human, and whose intentions are to take over the planet. This sets in motion Vincent's initially lonely quest to root out and thwart the invaders' plans for world domination. In the second season, Vincent discovered that he was not alone, and that there was an underground network of human rebels that he joined in the fight against the aliens.

This was a wonderful show, and now it will be seen and loved by a much wider audience.",1229040000,5,1051,4.737704918032787
3644261,5,B001HUHBB8,"Another favorite from way back when.  I'm not sure what ingredients were used to make those classic sci-fi's, but this one had them all - suspense, innocence, 60's directing, and a low voice narrator.  So, round up the family and get ready for part two.",1227398400,16,253,4.6
3644262,5,B001HUHBB8,"The Invaders, starring Roy Thinnes was, and still is, an excellent production.  The script was written intelligently.  I missed the ending of the series, and if it was ever rerun I missed it.  I have been waiting for years for it to become available on DVD.  When I viewed Season 1 was was not disappointed.  It was as good as ever.  I'm pleased that Season 2 has become available.",1227225600,5,381,4.449275362318841
