8254750,4,B0014A1ZLS,"I already owned all of Steve's studio albums, plus the Limelight concert album, but the first videos of his I had seen were from Squint. Some of the costumes look a bit dated now, but watching this VHS tape, I can remember hearing and imagine seeing the excitement when a young, radical, energetic Steve Taylor burst on the early '80s Christian music scene, which had been mostly middle of the road, plus a little soft rock until then. I would give Steve's music and innovative videos five stars, but this tape only includes four songs, plus a few interview clips, for a total of 22 minutes. It appears to have been released as a promotional video for his early albums: two of the songs are music videos, including Meltdown, which made the breakthrough to MTV, while the other two are simply live concert footage. Still, if you can find a used copy for a reasonable price, like I did, This tape is worth it. Maybe some day Steve will do what Al Yankovic does every few years, and release a compilation of all his videos to date on DVD. I know I would buy it.",1360713600,,1058,4.430769230769231
