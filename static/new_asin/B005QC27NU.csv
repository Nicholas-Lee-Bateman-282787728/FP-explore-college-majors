4858246,5,B005QC27NU,"As one who prefers older movies to today's trash, it is always nice to see yet another release of a Loretta Young movie.  In Kentucky, she can be seen doing what she always did best, that is giving a great performance and always being a gracious LADY.  The story was intended to be about horses and a long standing feud between two families that after years evolved into one from each family falling in love and questioning why the feud had been perpetuated for so long.  It was not intended to be categorized as portraying any one peoples in a detrimental way. As other comments relative to this movie reflect, that's just the way movies were made back in not only 1938 but other years as well.  Times and people change.  Sometimes for the better, sometimes not.

To the reviewer that gave their laughable opinion about this being a racist movie, you need to get a life.  You must be one of those people who like to try and keep fueling the idea of racism in this country.  You must also be one of those people who think all white people ""owe"" black people since our white ancestors owned slaves.  Well let me tell you something, all my ancestors, as well as millions of other white people's ancestors came here from Europe and other places and never owned a slave in their life.  It wouldn't surprise me if you are also one of those people who still want to keep the Walt Disney Studios from releasing Song Of The South.  It was alright to splash such movies like Roots all over the TV but Heaven forbid we ever get to see Song Of The South made available.  I'm pretty sure everyone, white or black, associated with the making of this movie would be very much offended if they knew someone, some seventy-six plus years later, was publishing a review of this movie calling it racist thus inferring its' stars, white or black, were also racist.  Shameful.",1398988800,30,1855,4.4851190476190474
4858247,1,B005QC27NU,"I saw this movie on tv. I watched in horrified fascination because of the incredible depth of racism depicted in it. All the black people in the movie worked on the plantations, as if it were slave days and they were slaves. They called the white men 'Boss Man'. There were mammies in the kitchens who wore long skirts and big blouses with white head scarves. The one who worked for the leading lady called her 'honey chile'.

The beginning of the movie takes place at the start of the Civil War. The Yankees are depicted as bad guys who murdered and robbed the poor plantation owners. The slaves all seemed to appreciate being slaves.

I know you have to take movies like this in their historical context, but this was really the worst I have ever seen. I watched for a little while and finally was so disgusted I had to turn it off.

The only good thing I can think of about this movie is that it gave a bunch of African American actors some work.",1375488000,2,949,4.320224719101123

4858249,3,B005QC27NU,"Kentucky, 1938 film

This movie begins in 1861 Kentucky. Will they support Lincoln or Jeff Davis? They are bound by culture and economics to the Confederate states. The Union army arrives to confiscate all horses belonging to those who haven't sworn allegiance to the Union. Goodwin resists this confiscation, and is shot when he draws his pistol. ""They killed my father!"" cries a young boy. The foals must be fed without their mares. Next it is 1938, and we are told about race horses from Kentucky. A Packard convertible speeds along the road, driven by a Dillon. He notices the Goodwin girl. We see life on a horse farm in those days. One man from the Goodwin family has plans to buy cotton now and hold it until the price rises. [A bet or speculation.] One old man comes looking for a meal and a job. [No Social Security then.] The bank will not lend money to the Goodwin's, they already have a mortgage, and the money will be used for speculation. [A lesson in economics.]

Young Dillon gets emotional over the failed loan. [Isn't he totally wrong in backing a loser?] The Goodwin horses are auctioned off to pay their debts. ""Old pictures hardly bring a thing."" Young Dillon, no longer a banker, applies for a job as a trainer. Later, Sally Goodwin tries to get a doctor by riding a racehorse. Running on a concrete road will damage the legs of a racehorse. The Goodwins have to let their servants go, they can't be paid. But the Goodwins go to collect a two-year old horse won in a bet. ""A horse race is not a beauty contest."" Uncle Peter picks a horse by the look in its eyes. Later, we learn about the correctness of his decision. ""Bluegrass"" will ride in the derby. There is a conflict about the jockey's role. Hand ride or use the whip? Sally makes the decision. The race begins, people cheer, the horses gallop. ""Bluegrass"" is the winner. [Was this race fixed?] ""We won!"" But Uncle Peter can't join the
 winner's circle now.

This provides an example of the horse racing business, the background to a gambling system that provide business across the nation. Note how betting on other sports has displaced horse racing over the past decades. ""Never bet on a sport where the animals can talk"" said Arnold Rothstein. The book ""Eight Men Out"" will educate you about these activities. Have you ever wondered why a team favored to win will lose by a slight margin? Who benefits? Gambling is a human flaw, it is known to all societies for thousands of years. It is like the belief in magic, doing some ritual to create good luck. You can ""knock on wood"" for that.",1343347200,5,2568,4.539956803455723
