1675857,4,B00005Y7DD,Others have already detailed this film better than I but I enjoyed the rental and am purchasing the DVD. If you like Albert Brooks then this is one of his best.,1022198400,,160,4.193548387096774
1675858,5,B00005Y7DD,"This is a movie you will be telling everyone to see. It is about friendship, how people from two different worlds are more alike than they seem. The script, performances and direction are superb.  It's funny, sad and profound.
Shame on the Studio for not promoting this life affirming film.",1021420800,2,290,4.8
1675859,2,B00005Y7DD,"The first two-thirds is very good (4 stars): story, characters, visual presentation and effects.  Then gag, the whole thing becomes atrociously contrived and dishonest, insulting and irritating with its ""heart-warming"" conformist message.  Sobieski is very very good though, the rest of the cast nice as well.  Worth seeing once, or maybe just two-thirds.",1021334400,3,355,5.660377358490566
1675860,5,B00005Y7DD,"What a wonderful little gem of a movie, full of depth and heart and more than a few surprises. Leelee Sobieski plays against her blonde and generally beautiful stereotype in this film, appearing as a rather dark and depressed 17 year old teen (nicknamed J), complete with tattoos, black makeup and pierced skin.  She is miserable at school, doesn't feel understood by her mother (Carol Kane in one of her best roles), stepfather or father. She has no friends. In short, she is alienated, desperately in need of someone she can relate to.
 That someone turns out to be the last person you'd expect, a 49 year old men's clothing store owner named Randall (played by Albert Brooks). Although he is reluctant to hire her, he eventually gives in and the two become friends after a shakey start. Not that it is all smooth going. The two are so different that there's bound to be a few rough patches in their friendship, some occasions where they test one another (I don't want to give details for fear of spoiling the surprises).
  Luckily this doesn't turn into another ""older guy, younger girl"" romance. Director Christine Lahti is too smart to things get so stereotypical - thank goodness. And she is also wise enough to let viewers discover the hidden depths in Randall and J, depths that might not surface if sex muddied the waters. Lahti also adds the special touches that make this movie a standout - humorous bits, personal details and an understated style that charms without being overwhelming. If you're looking for a movie that will touch your heart and leave you with a good feeling after watching it, you can't do better than this one.",1021075200,34,1643,4.714285714285714
1675861,5,B00005Y7DD,"There's so much to say about this film. It shows that despite life's ups and downs, curves and bumps, we all have it within us to find our way. What it boils down to...
I laughed, and I cried.
This is the best film of the year.",1020902400,,227,3.851063829787234
1675862,4,B00005Y7DD,"After Tom Reynolds' well-written review of this movie, there isn't much left to be said! His is a hard act to follow.
Almost every critic seemed to hone in on the last third of the movie, and I thought that their almost-rabid reaction was overdone ---the sequence of events was surely undeserving of this kind of intense dislike.
I thought this was a very well-done movie, sweet, gentle, fairly uncomplicated. The casting was excellent and the portrayals of an insecure teen Goth, an emotionally repressed clothing salesman, a ditzy and clueless mother, a hippie father, and an uninvolved step-father were right on the mark. The main characters were fully fleshed out and the unlikely friendship between the two vulnerable loners, J and R, was touchingly rendered.
Despite their age and lifestyle differences, the two have much in common and discover this as the movie progresses and they discover that they need each other. It is a film about acceptance, compassion,  forgiveness, and love, no matter where or how these are found.",1020470400,3,1031,5.029239766081871
1675863,5,B00005Y7DD,Leelee S. not only looks fantastic even as a moronic goth but she is years ahead of her age in her screen presence and acting abilities. She is a gem. I recommend any film that she is in.,1020297600,,187,3.9473684210526314
1675864,5,B00005Y7DD,"Among the many and myriad young actresses making movies today, there has unequivocally emerged a Fantastic Four, and they are:  Natalie Portman, Anna Paquin, Kirsten Dunst and Leelee Sobieski.  And the one who is arguably the leader of the pack, Leelee Sobieski, takes on the starring role here, in ""My First Mister,"" a story of two very different people, of different generations, both of whom are alone in the world (though in different ways and for different reasons), and who ultimately find what they need in one another-- and without even consciously looking for it.  Directed by Christine Lahti, It's a study, not only of human nature, but of the expansiveness and resiliency of the human spirit and of the heart, and how it is possible for two people to defy category and definition, and intuitively reach out to one another by allowing fate, or destiny-- or whatever you want to call it-- to take them beyond the parameters set by society, where-- as in this case-- they are able to find fulfillment in it's purest sense.  It's a revised chapter taken from the age-old book of The Human Comedy, updated to a contemporary setting to illustrate that now as much as ever, no man is an island; that everyone needs someone, that there is someone for everyone and, moreover, that one will instinctively seek out that kindred soul, often finding him in the most unlikely of places.
 Jennifer (Sobieski) is an unhappy teen; she's adopted a goth look and lifestyle, embraces her autonomy, but in so doing has alienated just about everybody around her, including-- or perhaps especially-- her immediate family.  she simply cannot relate to her mother, Sylvie (Carol Kane), who seems perpetually mired in the `50s (her appearance and attitude part of her own defense mechanisms and survival tactics), or her step-father, Bob (Michael McKean), a nondescript individual who is just...there.
 What Jennifer longs for is a place of her own, which she equates (albeit subconsciously) to independence, and toward that end she begins looking for the gainful employment that will enable her to achieve her immediate goal.  And it is during her job search that she encounters Randall (Albert Brooks), the manager of a men's clothing store.
 Necessity may be the proverbial mother of invention, but here it becomes the driving force that makes the connection between two people who-- if not for that necessity-- would never have known the other existed.  As it turns out, however, due to some quite personal circumstances and reasons of his own, Randall is something of a singular individual, and is able to see beyond Jennifer's outward appearance and attitude, and agrees to give her a job on a trial basis.  And it's the beginning of a unique relationship that will ultimately change both of their lives forever, and in ways that neither of them could possibly have imagined.
 This is the first feature film that Lahti-- a fine actor herself-- has directed, and she does an exemplary job with it.  She knows her characters and the emotional terrain with which she is dealing, and subtly fills the story as it unfolds with pathos and poignancy, which she delivers with care and sensitivity.  Lahti has an eye for emotional detail and, perhaps due to her own extensive acting background, knows how to extract the precise sentiment she's endeavoring to express from her actors.  And because of the way it's presented, when the story takes an unexpected turn, the transition is so seamless it comes across as entirely real and convincing, which of course gives it credibility, and makes it believable.  Lahti has a gentle touch tempered with a restraint, and it gives her film a natural flow and a rhythm that draws in the viewer and makes for a satisfying and involving experience.
 Complementing Lahti's style, and assuring the success of this film, are the wonderful performances by Sobieski and Brooks.  Sobieski runs an emotional gamut in this film, and she does it with a poise and maturity beyond her years, making her journey from disenfranchised goth at the beginning of the film, to the individual she is at the end, plausible and convincing.  She manages to convey all of the emotional layers of her character, which enables the viewer to relate to the complexities of who this young woman is and what she's feeling, which-- since this is a character driven story-- is integral to the overall success of the film.  And Sobieski makes it so, with a memorable performance.
 A big part of the credit for the film's success has to go to Albert Brooks, as well.  As he does here with Randall, Brooks has an innate ability to create a character that is so normal, so average-guy-on-the-street, that it adds that total sense of reality to the film.  It's the little things that Brooks does so well, and that make all the difference; he gives the audience someone with whom they can truly empathize and identify, because he so succinctly manages to express all the affecting elements of everyday life-- the minutiae of day-to-day existence, as well as the corresponding emotions-- through his characters, and it's why you're going to remember Randall for a long, long time.  Like Ben Stiller, Brooks has a straightforward, often wry delivery that works so well, and which he uses to great effect.  And it certainly serves him well here.
 The supporting cast includes Desmond Harrington (Randy), Mary Kay Place (Patty), Kevin Cooney (Doctor), William Forward (Customer) and Lisa Jane Persky (Sheila).  An entertaining, well crafted and delivered film that promises one thing and ends up giving much more, ""My First Mister,"" in the final analysis, is an engaging story that goes deep and touches the heart, and without any maudlin sentimentality attached.  Ultimately a transporting experience, this is one that will take you to a place you'll want to be, and you'll be glad you took the journey.  And that's the magic of the movies.",1020038400,35,5921,4.928571428571429

Caution:  During the beginning of the movie don't be put off by the frequent use of the ""F"" word.  Avoidance of the use of that word develops as one theme of this story.  Surprise:  John Goodman appears in a major uncredited role and gives a delightful performance.

There is a lot of that, but this movie examines the hearts of the characters, and different kinds of love and the impact those different kinds of love have on people's lives.
It is a 'coming of age' for the middle-aged man as much as it is for the young girl. I like how it deals with their relationship and her changing feelings toward him, and how they deal with each other.  This story has depth of character.",1416182400,,519,4.40625

1675932,5,B00005Y7DD,"Jennifer Wilson sticks a safety pin in her palm to draw blood onto a typically morose diatribe on parchment paper as she watches a cheery Partridge Family re-run on television (David Cassidy singing ""I think I love you...""). Her bedroom would make The Addams Family proud. Plastic skeletons hang from the mirror, black and silver skull murals adorn the wardrobe, decapitated girly toy dolls stabbed with safety pins and needles sit beside naked shop mannequins covered in black eyeliner and blood. This is the kind of doom-filled bedroom ""Game of Thrones"" set designers would wander around looking for good ideas.

Jay is miserable to a degree that is hilarious and pathological (the lovely and talented Leelee Sobieski). She's alienated everyone at school with how she acts and looks (tattoos, piercings, hoodies, everything in black), hasn't had a boyfriend, her mother's a hyperactive re-married wreck and her wig-wearing step-father seems absent to the world from the waist up (fabulous work by Carol Kane and Michael McKean). Jay looks at people through binoculars - backwards - because they seem more fun that way. She also enjoys lying on graves feeling the 'energy' of women who have passed and sees her beloved dead grandmother sat opposite her at the dinner table as mother serves up yet more leftover Brisket. Jay throws a paper-glider from her bedroom window each day to the uncaring World outside with her latest eulogy statement. She even self-inflicts on her arms when she's in real pain. You could say the young Californian lady has her 'issues'...

One day Jay heads into where the real money is at - the Century City shopping mall in Los Angeles. Having been chucked out of every clothing store for looking like Edward Scissorhands on a Goth tip and scaring the Bejayzuss out of the customers - she ends up outside a high end clothing store called Rutherfords. Inside she sees the cardigan wearing, oversized-slacks owning Randall unsuccessfully trying to dress an armless female mannequin in the store window. For some reason Jay takes a shine to this slightly odd and sad man. However it turns out Randall Harris is not such a drip - he's witty, just as quick with the retort and although he's a guarded soul too - Randall is older, wiser and somehow more kindly (a fantastically effecting Albert Brooks).

So in a moment of olive branch and spurred on by her obvious intelligence and initiative - Manager Randall offers the crazy-looking brat a storeroom job colour-coding the men's shirts. It isn't long before Randall's goodness starts to rid her of those dark-world trappings and from underneath all that black make-up emerges something pretty - even loveable and fun. Soon they're hanging out, visiting her drinking haunts, having laughs, playing records in stores and both slowly opening up to a world of possibilities that isn't so isolated and alone anymore. They may even be slightly in love, as she gets jealous of older women and their attention to Randall. Jay even hooks up with her pot-smoking freewheeling Dad again (typically funny and great work from John Goodman) and things seem good for a while...

A relationship between a pretty seventeen year-old and a rotund 49 year-old male with a moustache, curly hair and no dress sense might descend into farce and even become pervy - or simply be on screen for the sake of audience shock value. But long-time Actress and Director Christine Lahti is careful to keep their time together on an even keel. But better than that - there's a genuine chemistry of affection between actors Sobieski and Brooks that fills every scene with a tenderness and admiration that is rare. These are two lost souls helping each other come out of their darkness and loneliness - and each scene they're together in bristles with that lovely hopefulness that probably made the Director want to make the movie in the first place.

The burgeoning love between them is never consummated (not that kind of tale) but Jay soon discovers that Randall Harris is keeping a secret about a wife that left decades back, a son he never knew and a medical condition he's kept hidden from everyone (the woman who visits at the shop is a nurse - Mary Kay Place as Patty). And on it goes to Jay desperately trying to get back to a hospital in time with a young man in tow (Desmond Harrington) who is just as moody and morose as she is...

I loved Christine Lahti in ""Housekeeping"" (a 1987 film that's long forgotten and criminally so) and I figured her ""My First Mister"" would be touching - and it is. ""You communicate with articles not humans..."" Jay says to neurotic Randall in a probing moment. She honestly calls him ""anal dude"" in another and he doesn't mind because deep down he knows she's right. He jokes back in the early part of their relationship ""We'll keep her in the store on a temporary basis in case she tries suicide!"" - while he later confesses on his home porch ""I'm afraid of everything...going to bed...waking up..."" Astutely and beautifully observed by Jill Franklyn (the Writer) - there's a dance of truth and expression between the two lead characters that is both profound and warm and not easy to get right.

Perhaps because of its slightly naff title this 2001 film never seemed to get noticed - and to this day (2014) the HD version is only available on a download (there's no BLU RAY). But this is one little tattoo on the buttocks I suggest you get down and dirty with...

A tender and life-affirming movie - maybe one day ""My First Mister"" will make it onto the new format. I will look forward greatly to that...",1396137600,,5587,4.788381742738589

Such a refreshing look at friendship and the ability we all have within us to change someone's life and make it better.  Friendship and love know nothing of age or social status or gender.  True friendship and love is transformative and can change the world!

This story was unique, it's characters dysfunctional and lovable and the actors did a fantastic job.  Certainly this film has one of those happy/sad endings, much like life in general.  Most everything is a mix of good and bad, happy and melancholy, and this film shows us that even in the midst of sadness, joy may be found.",1285718400,,683,4.557377049180328
1675953,4,B00005Y7DD,"My First Mister is a film about a 17-year old goth girl played by Leelee Sobieski who develops a strong (and touching) friendship with Al Brooks' character.

Her life is apparently crappy (well not really, but according to her it is) because she has no friends and feels like a total outsider.

As soon as she gets a job at a clothing store, the friendship she develops with Al Brooks' character can best be described as humorous, adorable and interesting.  At first the two of them hate each other because they're so radically different personality-wise, but then things change as they get to know each other better.

Without spoiling too much, the storyline eventually shifts into a different direction where we find out about Al Brooks' son, and at this point My First Mister (for me, at least) becomes a bit boring since the amount of actual laughs stop becoming so frequent, and the storyline turns very serious.  This happens about 60% of the way through.

I especially like how Leelee Sobieski's mom has a personality that is TOTALLY different from her daughters, haha.  The mom is very perky and excited all the time, and some very funny moments take place such as when the daughter tries getting her mom to listen to rap.

Overall, don't expect the best storyline imaginable- instead just expect a quality and simple storyline involving a friendship between a young girl and an older man.",1284163200,,1397,4.791666666666667

Two people who are as different from one another as you can imagine discover common ground, and provide the friendship to one another that they both need so much.

I've seen other reviews where people think this movie is unrealistic, as if two such people would not find common ground, but real life is filled with all sorts of unpredictable relationships. Who is to say what one sees in another?

The pretentious title, which emerges from the final eulogy, is a box office killer. It is mystifying before you see the movie, and almost as mystifying afterwards.

The actors are so good that you want to like what you're seeing, but there is no logic. A daughter this troubled does not result from parents this untroubling. The friendship between R and J is made believable, but the backstory is not. So you enjoy its progression, but while not knowing any reason J is like she is, the story ultimately feels hollow and contrived.",1247529600,3,738,4.625954198473282

Albert Brooks and John Goodman are 'lock' actors for good performances, but who really surprised me was Leelee Sobieski.  She shows surprising range of emotion and ability for someone who is very hit-and-miss on film.  Case Comparison: ""Joan of Arc"" vs. ""The Messenger"", produced pretty close together in time, in which she is outperformed by Milla Jovovich by an embarrassing margin.  It is for this very reason that you should buy ""My First Mister""; it is a ""Monster""-like moment for Sobieski that really departs from her thin, blondie-mannequin archtype all too prevalent in many of her films.  At least rent it; you won't be disappointed. Four stars only because of Carol Kane(over the top) and Michael McKean(surprisingly diluted) showing weak performances.

Today i ordered the dvd for me to keep. The last i bought was ""Million Dollar Baby"" which when tv listing doesnt agree with me i watched many times. What people thought about the above movie to be an extremely depressing story, i found it extremely inspiring instead.

1675975,4,B00005Y7DD,"I was not ready for such a powerful, intelligent, and intricately detailed film.  I had read several glowing reviews for Christine Lahti's official directorial debut, but I had just assumed this would be another Hollywood schlock-fest featuring the dry humor of Albert Brooks (which I find grows on my with each new film) and Leelee Sobieski attempting to reconnect with a teenie-bopper audience.  I was wrong.  To be perfectly frank with you, I was dead wrong.  This was such a strong film that dedicated itself to developing strong characters, to giving us honest emotions, and providing us a story that is not unfamiliar in the ""real"" world that it nearly left my jaw hanging on the ground.  From the opening moments in which we are focused directly on the life of Jennifer (aka ""J"") to the unrecognizable change to following Randall (aka ""R"") My First Mister will make you laugh, make you cry, and make you realize that friendship is stronger than the clothes you wear or the amount of piercings on you face.  Through the use of Brooks' ""every man"" persona and Sobieski's attention to detail with her character, this film gives us a rare glimpse into Lahti's near-perfect film.

What initially pulled me into this film was the untraditional Hollywood story that scribe Jill Franklyn unfolds before us.  I assumed, prior to watching the film that this was going to be a sexual film mocking the taboos of age in our society.  From the completely baffling byline, one could only assume that we were about to experience an early version of Thirteen, but Lahti and Franklyn do something rather unexpected.  The idea of sex is placed in front of us early in the film and prior to the climax, but it isn't the central focus.  By building this film around the premise of friendship instead of sex, Lahti creates a unique and poignant film about other cultural taboos in our society.  She eliminates the idea of sex and gives us two strong-willed characters that, perhaps in another life, may have had a sexual relationship, but now are just seeking companionship and comfort.  What brings a smile to my face with this story is the way that it is developed.  Lahti nearly teases us with the idea of a sexual story several times, but instead builds a solid foundation around friendship.  She makes us, the audience, feel as if we are meeting two friends for the first time.  By eliminating sex, she pulls us deeper within the characters allowing us to see the true ""love"" that is obviously between these visual opposites.  I use the word ""visual"" because we do not believe their connection at first because of the clothes that they wear.  Lahti uses this technique to trick us.  A Goth girl befriends Mr. Rogers?  Society would tell us that this could never happen, but the Lahti persuades us by giving us two of the strongest characters to play against each other in modern cinematic history.

I realize that others would argue that there have been stronger matching in Hollywood long before Brooks and Sobieski, which I would agree of classic Hollywood, but recently (basically 80s to present) it is hard to find two actors that seem to compliment each other like a great cheese and aged red wine.  Brooks and Sobieski took me away from them, as the actors, and gave me a whole new viewing experience.  Sobieski dove, head first, into her character giving ""J"" mannerisms and characteristics that seemed pure and researched.  I felt as if Sobieski was one of those misunderstood Goths that I had class with in school.  From the poetry, the eye movements when speaking, and the overall self-abusive negativity that she has against herself as well as those around her.  She patiently waits for the right person to enter her insane life and finds that with Brooks.  For those seeking his typical sarcasm and wry attitude, My First Mister may disappoint.  Albert Brooks contains himself in this film.  He does so to the point that midway through the feature I forgot that it was funnyman Brooks.  He amazingly transforms himself into an older version, in a khaki color, of ""J"".  Odd to say, but that is why these two ""opposites"" attracted so well.  The two play so well off each other that as an audience member you have the chance to enjoy both the acting as well as a very strongly developed story about family and friendship.

I have talked about the story, I have talked about the characters, but none of this would have been possible if it were not for the brilliant direction behind the camera and the talented eye of minimal director Christine Lahti.  At first I was unsure of how well she would be able to handle such a deeply emotional topic, if she would clich? the characters and fill their mouths with remedial dialogue that would be painful to both the eyes and ears, but instead she remained calm, cool, and completely collective throughout the entire film.  It was obvious that she had done her homework prior to each scene and before each take.  She had the control of her actors, which developed into some great on-screen chemistry, as well as she knew how to tactfully take us to the next emotional level.  Sure, it wasn't perfect (the ending seemed a bit tattered), but Lahti remained focused and even cleverly changed the focus throughout the film with the greatest of ease.  We began with ""J"", moved to ""R"", and went back to ""J"" for the final tearful moments.  Other directors would have had our minds in a fix, but Lahti was delicate and truthful to the foundation that she had just set.  I was surprised to see that Lahti has not directed more after this project, because it was obvious that her talent was behind the camera (as well as in front).

Overall, I thought My First Mister was a sensational film.  This was the epitome of the ""diamond in the rough"" cinema.  We had a superb cast that complimented each other so well that we could easily forget that we were watching a film.  We had a story that spoke emotionally and socially about friendship and family on more than just a ""June Cleaver"" level.  Finally, we had a director that was not afraid to take risks and do her homework.  This story works on so many levels that to begin to unravel it would take more time than allowed.  I suggest this film strongly because it will make you think twice about passing judgment on someone due to their clothes or piercing habits, who knows where friendship could erupt!

1675977,4,B00005Y7DD,"I admit it:  I'm a fan of Leelee Sobieski.  She just looks *interesting*, but unlike some actresses who use that kind of appearance to simply look pretty while talking in a monotone, she uses it to create great, memorable characters.

In My First Mister, she tosses out her usual good-girl image and instead portrays a multiply-pierced, deeply melancholy teenager who has spent most of her life wanting to escape from everything -- and everyone -- around her.  She's a virgin and not particularly happy about it, and she doesn't have a friend in the world ... until one day, purely by accident, she runs into Randall at a local department store.  He's much older than she is, but (as is unsurprising in a movie like this) they develop a close, curious friendship.  It's not quite sexual, but never quite asexual either; the actors strike just the write note to remain believable without ever becoming creepy.

About midway through, the wheels of the plot begin turning, and we discover some long-buried secrets resulting in an imminent crisis.  This stuff is typical movie-of-the-week material, and I found it a little disappointing after the masterful buildup.

Still, having seen thousands of friendships portrayed in books and movies over the course of my life, it's always delightful to discover something genuinely new.

Goth girl and uptight clothing salesman make a gentle connection that proves enlightening and life-affirming for both of them. Directed to great effect by Christine Lahti, this is a film that could've been a sweetly sickening confection. Instead, its potentially saccharine moments are salvaged by surprising nuggets of truth and humor. We have the privilege of watching these two characters grow and evolve into finer versions of themselves. Ably assisted by Carol Kane (as J's ditzy but good-hearted mother) and Michael McKean (one of the exceptionally versatile regulars on the great Tracy Ullman show) in a toupee that's so terrible it deserves a special award.

1675993,2,B00005Y7DD,"Seventeen year-old Jennifer (Leelee Sobieski) is a parent's worst nightmare. She dresses in black leather, is obsessed with the linked themes of pain and death, locks herself in her room to listen to music of the Acid Reflux genre, is disinterested in school, sports large (albeit fake) tattoos, and has had her faced multiple pierced by shiny metal studs (nose, eyebrows, lips). Her chief hobby is writing tortured self-eulogies. Her distracted mother (Carol Kane), completely alienated, is not so much unaware of her daughter's condition as left feeling completely helpless in the face of it. Jennfer's stepfather spends his time watching TV game shows. Welcome to a typical Southern California family unit as imagined by small town residents of the Midwest.
Enter Randall (Albert Brooks), the forty-nine year-old, divorced, and supremely square manager of an upscale clothing store in Beverly Hills that reluctantly offers Jennifer a job as a stock clerk if only she'll remove the hardware from her face so she won't scare away the trade. Things progress from there, and the two are soon on a first initial basis, ""J"" and ""R"" respectively. And ""J"" is out front, conservatively wardrobed, selling. Mom is thrilled.
Sobieski is actually quite good in her role, and one hopes she'll find better material. She effectively portrays Jennifer as a young woman adrift without an anchoring father figure. It's certainly not her stepfather, a Complete Zero who should have been eliminated from the plot entirely, nor is it any male teacher or her biological father Ben, the latter an aging hippie played by John Goodman. Randall fits the bill, though he himself is a loner who's unable to establish relationships because of a little problem that eventually reveals itself. If the scriptwriters had left it at that, it might have been fine. But then they also try and ameliorate the dysfunction that exists between Jennifer and Mom, between Randall and his ex, between Jennifer and Ben, and between Randall and any woman his own age. By the time ""J"" is offering a toast to the ""F"" words (Friends, Family, Fate, Forgiveness, Forever) at a family dinner, and a tuxedoed ""R"" is dancing with her while dragging along an IV pole, the viewer is almost smothered in the ambient warm fuzziness of it all. And Jennifer's last scene with Randall's long-lost son (What, that too?!) was so corny I was almost moved to tears.
About forty-five minutes into MY FIRST MISTER, the direction the film seemed to be heading reminded me of BREEZY, that forgettable but straight forward 1973 movie starring Bill Holden as a fifty year-old divorc&eacute; who has an affair with a seventeen year-old free spirit played by Kay Lenz. The good news is that MY FIRST MISTER veered off from going there. The bad news is that it didn't continue straight on. While MY FIRST MISTER is a trendy, touch-feely film about isolated people reaching out to connect with each other, it tried to hard to be believable, and then just wasn't.",1036886400,7,2991,4.972055888223553

1676009,5,B00005Y7DD,"Christine Lahti hits her directorial stride with My First Mister, the story of goth chick J's precarious friendship with her wry middle-aged retail boss Randall.  Proving the old adage that cliches are cliches because they're true, Lahti guides Leelee Sobieski (think Drew Barrymore's geeky math team friend in Never Been Kissed) and Albert Brooks (Taxi Driver, Defending Your Life) through Jill Franklyn's warm comedy that misses sappiness through its edginess and wit. ""I like chocolate.  It's dark and warm, like I imagine a hug would be"" is just one of the lines written by Franklyn, who has contributed several scripts to the Seinfeld show.
J's perspective, like that of Winona Ryder's Roxy in the '80's movie Welcome Home Roxy Carmicheal, is dark and miserably self-centered but enormously entertaining.  Her chemistry with Randall requires no suspension of disbelief--Brooks and Sobieski have just made my list of Top Ten Most Watchable Onscreen Couples.  The movie's set up is absorbing, and the somewhat formulaic rise of action doesn't deter from its entertainment value as the last third of the movie veers from the predictable and into the deeply satisfying.  Cameos by Mary Kay Place, Micheal McKean, Carol Kane and John Goodman add color to the screen as well.

1676010,3,B00005Y7DD,"With superior performances by Leelee Sobieski and Albert Brooks as the two leads, this should have been a much better film than it is.  Carol Kane as well turns in a terrific performance as an overly middle class-ified Mom--bourgeois to the max--and John Goodman, in a smallish role, is very funny as a way overgrown hippie.
The first half of this film is absolutely perfect.  The comedy is witty, sharp, and simultaneously touching.  As ""J"" (for Jennifer), Sobieski really shines; she's a Goth-obsessed teen who, true to the Goth spirit, writes eulogies and haunts graveyards. One might think this sounds much too trite, but the dialogue (and J's monologues) are very smart and lift this portrayal far above the cliched.  When J meets Randall (Brooks)--her polar opposite--the inspired mix of antagonism and curiosity is brilliantly done.  He becomes her ultra conservative boss in an equally conservative clothing store where she's the backroom clerk responsible for keeping stuff in order. Told never to venture out onto the floor, she does so anyway and typically scares away the customers with her purple-dyed hair and single nose ring (this, after shedding the other four or five facial piercings at Brooks' prompting).
So far, so good (in fact, really good).  Then the entire course of the film changes with the revelation of Brooks' true condition and we are faced with yet another Hollywood film meant to teach us the value of life and the true nature of us all and the importance of humanity and there's a lesson to be learned here for everyone, fellow earthlings.  Of course there is.
With such great characters, as revealed by the first half of the film, why not expand upon that foundation and go for the gusto?  Move the characters into situations that sharpen their differences more and bring them together based on those differences.  By introducing an enormous element of bathos, the momentum of the first half is shattered, to be replaced by an extremely forced convergence of souls rather than a natural one that could easily have been developed, given the intelligence shown earlier in the film.
The three stars are for the excellent performances and the great first half of the film.",1026432000,6,2204,4.967391304347826

Both Sobieski and Brooks deliver solid performances, backed up with a great cast. I heard someone compare it to Ghost World, and believe me, it is way better than Ghost World. Hell, I didn't even laugh in Ghost World... and this one has a real message.
This movie really deserved a 5, but since the disc is bare bones it takes the rating back one star.",1025740800,,593,4.2105263157894735

1676013,5,B00005Y7DD,"Sadly My First Mister basically went unnoticed in the theaters and quickly came to video where it sadly will sit on the shelves and gather dust like so many other smaller films but it is usally those smaller films that have the most heart and soul put into them but sadly some studios don't feel they will rake in the money and they don't release them to more theaters but with the word of mouth for this one I feel it would've been a hit! I saw Ebert and Roper review this film earlier this year on their show and both had so much great things to say about the film and eventually gave it two thumbs up, which is rightfully deserves. I rented the movie just the other night, not expecting that much from it but just a dark little comedy or something because that's how the reviews made it seem but by the end of the film I was totally blown away and in tears because it's such a great film. I think i'm even more saddend by the fact that not many people are going to pick up on this film and would rather rent one of Leelee Sobeski's other films like the Glass House and pass this one up because they never heard of it. Leelee has given us her greatest work in this film and truly shines in the role of J, the gothic loner who has nothing but eventually has more than she thought in her life. Of course the whole thing on the cover about the ""new odd couple"" really in my opinion makes this film seem more of a comedy than a drama but like the back of the box says...the movie is unpredictable, which it truly was to me because I didn't expect this film to blow me away like it did! Please to anyone that's reading this...go rent, buy, or steal (just don't tell them who told you to steal it you get caught!)this film because it truly is a wonderful piece of work that needs to be noticed and it's just far to good of a movie to collect dust on the video store shelves.",1024876800,4,1870,4.112021857923497

7956861,5,B00005Y7DD,"Let's just say that this independent piece (if it's not, it ought to have been) deserves more viewers than any of the mediocre teen flicks that have been and are being dished out. Albert Brooks and Leelee Sobieski really get down to business as Randall ""R"" and Jennifer ""J"". Plus, the latter character got me thinking outside the stereotypical box in regards to the Goth subculture. [Goth girls are gorgeous, not gory.] Furthermore, MY FIRST MISTER is a coming-of-age story that shows the growing pains and subsequent lessons without the games: from one-night-stands to phony ""liar revealed"" moments. The two principal figures really grow to know and bond with each other; not just cure each other's boredom or insecurity. And it's not just ""J"" who is growing but ""R"" is growing too; especially when forgiveness (of self and others--present and absent) gets involved. As a comedy, no need for screwball antics or triple-X dreams reminiscent of 80s teen films. As a drama, forget the useless bawling and long-winded, peel-off-the-skin dialogue. And ""J"" is right in her habit: the dead teach more lessons than the living, and gives us more room to listen--and imagine. This flick may not be a pictured movement, but it is the opposite of a mere moving picture.",1511308800,,1258,4.966824644549763

This movie is very poignant, potent and powerful. In its subtle little interactions between Sobieski and Brooks and his son, its beautiful I fell in love with the movie and characters so much, It just pulls you in. And its so great to see staple hang out places in hollywood in the film. I just love this combo of the two completely opposite characters finding common ground even love! whatever kind of love it was, it was love. It works so well and its simply a beautiful coming of age story... NO scratch that..its so much more, its magic! I find everyone can relate to this. And all the little twists and randomness of it make it a classic on its own. Its a must have, you will enjoy this movie over and over as heartwarming funny (Carol Kane can do no wrong!) and real to life. Please buy this and spread that honest to goodness love we are missing these days with social media and everyone becoming so willfully disconnected to one another. ( My Tangent ) Before it was cool to work up your nerve to go talk to someone you see in public, friend or more. These days you don't even notice anyone around you because you are so sucked into your smartphones, nothing else matters. If you are walking or standing around without a phone in your hand looking at it, or doing something with it. Its become a Faux Pas to just be standing waiting or sitting without looking at your phone. WTF has become of our society?? I urge teens to be different and cool and put the phone away and experience reality, run around, sit there and think about life, do something else. I urge parents to encourage their kids and teens to be different and be present, set rules to put the phone away between a certain time of day, a cut off. Its literally harming your children, all that texting and bright lights on their feeble little minds cannot be good. Though THIS MOVIE is good for them. Buy it.",1494633600,2,2040,4.3569553805774275

7956868,3,B00005Y7DD,"We might as well still have our movies being made under the rule of the late unlamented Hayes Code that used to impose absurd ""moral"" rules (e.g., no couples to be shown in bed together, even if clothed). This movie about a May-December friendship / almost-romance is beautifully acted, believable, and very moving in its first half. Then the second half introduces a plot twist that ensures the romance is never to come true, thus suddenly truncating what had been beautifully set up to be a potential groundbreaking story.

I should have known. The American Puritan heritage will apparently never die.

It's back to European and Japanese movies for me.",1456272000,,654,4.9363636363636365
