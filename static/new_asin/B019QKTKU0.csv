7580732,4,B019QKTKU0,"I first saw this film years ago and when I learned it was coming out on DVD, I decided to see it again.  During the late 1980's, I was not a metal person (Stevie Nicks was more my speed), but The Decline of Western Civilization II is a great overview of that lifestyle and its people.  It is a film that inspires both a sense of humor and sadness.  There is the decadence and eccentricity of the scene (I can't help but think that a transgender studies professor will propose a course on what some of these performers wore) as well as the often self-indulgent interviews.  But it gives a viewer pause listening to the young people with big dreams and having the hindsight of knowing in just about four years, heavy metal will implode as grunge hits it big.  You might say that what Penelope Spheeris caught was heavy metal's Weimar moment.",1462492800,2,839,4.457516339869281

It brought back a lot of the memories, as I haven't seen it quite some time.  I am happy to be able to add this to my DVD and Blu-ray collection.  If you love 80's hair bands. you will love this.  Although I wish more 80's bands were on this, it still is great Blu-ray.",1480896000,,434,3.7142857142857144

8745832,5,B019QKTKU0,A classic look at the 1980s metal scene. I love this movie! The scene with Chris holmes in the pool is just amazing.,1530489600,,116,4.086956521739131

8745835,5,B019QKTKU0,I saw this in the theatre back in the day and had it on VHS. Knew a few of these people. Fun and nice to reminisce about my misspent youth haha.  Crazy times! So glad it was released on DVD.,1518480000,,190,3.75
8745836,4,B019QKTKU0,"Bought this because I saw it when I was younger and it was interesting to see all the stuff about a lot of my favorite bands growing up.  Some of the interviews with unknown people trying to make it were good, some of them you can just tell that they were never going to make it.  Obviously there were a lot of people trying to do the same thing and there's a lot of 80's metal clones here.  I wonder how many actually succeeded in making it big as there were so many trying to do the same thing.  The 80's were definitely a time where people were influenced by music but there was just too many bands doing the same thing.  Oversaturated the scene.",1515801600,,649,4.16
8745837,1,B019QKTKU0,"One star because this Blu-ray is not ""All Regions"" like in Amazon's description. Junk in Europe.",1501372800,,96,5.0625
