3945322,5,B002L5GQMI,"In 2006, Swedish criminal defense lawyer and author would write the noel ""Snabba Cash"", as part of the ""Stockholm Noir"" trilogy.  The novel would become the fourth best selling novel in Sweden in 2007 and it caught the interest of Swedish filmmaker Daniel Espinosa (""Safe House"", ""The Fighter"", ""Outside Love"").

Because of Espinosa's upbringing in Skogas and his Chilean roots, he understood how it was to hang out with Yugoslavians and also hanging out with the upperclass in Sigtuna.  So, he can identify with the story of ""Snabba Cash"".  And the first film adaptation was released in theaters in 2010 and would received critical acclaim and become one of the best selling films in Sweden.

Filmmaker Martin Scorsese helped give the film recognition in America and the film was also part of a major bidding war in which the Weinstein Company acquired the rights to the film but also for a remake which will star Zac Efron.

With a sequel of ""Snabba Cash"" having been released in theaters in Sweden, the DVD for the first film titled ""Easy Money"" will be released in America courtesy of Anchor Bay Entertainment.

VIDEO, AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Easy Money"" is presented in Anamorphic Widescreen, 2:35:1 aspect ratio) in Swedish Dolby Digital 5.1 with English/English SDH subtitles.  I'm a little surprised that there is no Blu-ray HD release of this title (considering it was released on Blu-ray in 2010 in various countries) but for the most part, the DVD looks very good.  Colors are warm, I saw no artifacts or major problems with picture quality.  Cinematography by Aril Wretblad  (""Jalla! Jalla!"", Kopps"", ""Zozo"") is well-done and he does a great job in capturing the elegance of the high society parties but also the world of the criminal underworld.

Dialogue and Jon Ekstrand's music score are crystal clear and there is surround activity mostly during the action sequences towards the end of the film.  Otherwise, ""Easy Money"" is primarily a dialogue-driven film.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Easy Money"" comes with no special features.

JUDGMENT CALL:

A brilliant crime thriller from Daniel Espinosa, based on Jens Lapidus' best selling novel, ""Easy Money"" wins you over by the lives of these three men, who are different in lifestyle and their involvement in the criminal underworld and how these three men come into contact with each other.

Actor Joel Kinnaman as the main protagonist JW, is an intriguing figure in the crime world.  By looks alone, he looks like a metrosexual who wants to be a male model, but in truth is a man who just wants the opportunity to know life of the wealthy and be part of that circle.  He manages to infiltrate and befriend these individuals but despite coming from a poor upbringing, he has found a way to live this lifestyle by working with Switzerland's notorious drug syndicate.  And with more responsibility, means more money and it's what he wants... a lot of money to live the lifestyle that he enjoys.

Jorge has lived a criminal life, having a terrible upbringing and bringing brought up with his sisters.  Unfortunately, his problems brings his family problems and as much as Jorge wants to see his sister deliver a baby and help financially support his family, being a wanted man by the authorities and enemy syndicates, brings trouble all around him.  But he just needs to do one major job, so he can use the money and leave Switzerland.

As for Mrado Slovovic, the trained hitman who gets the job done but unfortunately, his life is changed upside-down, when he is forced to care for his eight-year-old.  And because he is often busy with his duties in the underworld, he ends up having to bring her around as well.

But for each of these men, each want to do one final job that would bring them money and that is to ensure a major cocaine delivery takes place.

But what happens when JW learns that there is no loyalty with the people he hooks up with.  That he is just a person that can be used anytime.  What happens when his thirst for money now leads him to a path of death and possibly his own, early demise?

Filmmaker Daniel Espinosa was able to bring life into his film adaptation of Jens Lapidus' novel and a big part of that is through the performances of its actors.  Joel Kinnaman is right for the part of JW.  With his slicked back hair and expensive clothes, you see how JW is able to get himself into the social elite, but also see him crack under pressure when he finds himself responsible for people getting beaten or killed.  He just took the job for easy money but now he learns that he got himself into something, far worse than he would ever expect.

Dragomir Mrsic also does a great job of playing a hitman who now has to deal with his daughter.  For his young daughter, her father is the world to her but for the character of Mrado, he sees it as an inconvenience of having to drag an 8-year-old girl around with him.  But also knowing that his life and how he was raised, it was not great.  So, he wants to at least be there for his daughter.  The scenes with Mrado and his daughter are interesting because you can tell that he loves his daughter, but yet does not like his daughter interfering with his life or job.

The cinematography of the film is well-done as it tries to capture the brutality of the underworld but also the elegance of high society.  Using warm colors, picture quality looks good on DVD but I was hoping Anchor Bay Entertainment would have released a Blu-ray release of ""Easy Money"" like it was in Europe.  While picture quality and audio were very good on DVD, unfortunately there are no special features at all.

Overall, Daniel Espinosa's ""Easy Money"" is one of the better underworld crime thrillers to come out in the last decade.  From its strong performances, writing and cinematography, ""Easy Money"" is an absolutely thrilling film that I highly recommend!",1364601600,11,5861,4.702941176470588
3945323,4,B002L5GQMI,"A big hit in Sweden, this twisty noir crime thriller is about JW, a poor economics student who falls for a pretty rich girl while leading a double life among Stockholms upper class.  Too maintain the deception, hes seduced into a brutal world of criminal activity that involves Jorge, an escaped convict on the run from both police and the Serbian mafia enforcer Mrado.  A massive cocaine deal promises a new life for all but delivers death for some.

Beautifully acted, directed, photographed and edited -- I was surprised by this movie's slick style and tight pace.  Paying close attention to the layered plot offers big rewards in this extremely tense, finely-crafted thriller.",1362873600,6,680,4.991150442477876
3945324,4,B002L5GQMI,"What is it with those crime dramas and thrillers out of Scandinavia? There is of course the Millenium trilogy out of Sweden a few years ago, and earlier this year an equally enthralling ""Headhunters"" out of Norway, and now we (finally!) get this movie out of Sweden.

""Easy Money"" (2010 release from Sweden; 124 min.) brings the story of JW (played by Joel Kinnaman), an economics university student in Stockholm who is driving a cab on the side to earn extra money. His Serbian boss in the (black market) cab company is also dabbling in the underground drug scene, and soon JW is given the opportunity to make extra money there too. JW needs the money as he really wants to fit in with some of his (upper class) university friends, where he also meet Sophie, whom he talkes a crush on. The movie then takes its time to lay out fractioning Eastern European drug gangs in Stockholm (as small as they are), and at one point JW is approached by the rival drug gang, to snitch on his own. Will JW take the bait? To tell more would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see how it all plays out. The movie has a LOT of characters to follow, and, to great effect, takes time to develop those characters. There is, just to name one, Mrado, a really bad guy, who all of the sudden has to deal with and care for his 8 yr. old daughter due to her mother's drug addiction. The scenes between Mrado and his young daughter just break your heart.

What a movie this is! The tension hardly lets up in the entire movie, and it all builds towards the devastating last 20 min, just wow. Joel Kinnaman is excellent as the lead actor. When I mentioned earlier that we now ""finally"" get a chance to see this movie, I have no idea why it has taken more than 2 1/2 years to reach the movie theatre here in Cincinnati, where I saw it just this week (the movie credits show this as ""presented by Martin Scorsese and The Weinstein Company""). But better late than never I suppose. And guess what? The remake rights have been picked up by Hollywood (sounds familiar?), with Zac Efron (!) slated to play the JW character. That aside, if you are in the mood for an outstanding foreign crime drama, ""Easy Money"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1350950400,23,2215,4.41320293398533

The movie is long (about two hours) with many periods where little is happening. This is not an action film. There were few funny moments in this movie.

Like a well crafted and picturesque Fellini film, or ""The Go-Between"" (Losey) it is well made and a pleasure to view, but it did not draw me in like ""Replacement Killers"" (Fuqua)  or Headhunters (Tyldum). The lead, Joel Kinnaman, was tapped to portray the Alex Murphy character in the new Robocop (Padiha) reboot. Kinnaman, who is a shoe-in for Keith Carradine, has a very nice love interest in the lustrous Lisa Henni.

3945427,5,B002L5GQMI,"First let me just say that I am a huge Joel Kinnaman fan and would watch anything he's in. He's just so beautiful to look at.  It's in his eyes. If you haven't watched The Killing, you should ASAP.  I love this movie for a few reasons. One is watching the whirlwind display of emotions being played out on Joel Kinnaman's face. This movie was gritty suspense done the Swedish way. There is a vast difference in story telling and delivery between American and Swedish cinema. I'm impressed with both styles AND I'm American. This was my first time hearing Sweden born and lead actor Joel Kinnaman speak his native tongue. It felt strange to me.  A little awkward. Not sure why.  Another reviewer mentioned talking to the television at times due to the characters actions. I agree and did the same. The movie is good entertainment. I would and have recommended Easy Money as a must see and was happy it became a Prime selection. The sequel is next on my to watch list.",1419292800,,966,4.502857142857143

And the story, well even Headhunter is a better movie. The reviews which suggest this is this amazing action movie are indulging in some strange hyperbole. This movie has some action, but no suspense, no build-up kind of ambles along to it's conclusion.

3945460,5,B002L5GQMI,"15 out 10 stars-

I'm buying this.

First, editor is like inhuman. There are no drops or wasted footage. Often I watch a movie and see a poor editing decision and wonder if the editor just didn't care enough.

Second, director. I prefer no named actors to known. A known star often overshadows their role with their achievements. Also, it tends to make series of cookie cutter films where the obvious intent is making money- not making sense. The  director of this film is someone to watch in the future. What he got from every single actor is incredible.

Third, actors. I think facial expressions and how one's body is held is more, or often as important than line delivery. I want the actors to BE. I don't want to be distracted by their obvious beauty or charm or roughness. I want to be distracted by their embodiment of complex characters. The lead is phenomenally good looking, but his acting is better than his looks. All secondary characters are throughly true to their roles and where did they get such a talented child actress?

Score, music should NEVER take from the story. Often times I will love a score, but wonder at the reasons for certain segments. Musical scores should be like vanilla beans in pound cake. There. Clearly, but understated or it ruins the whole cake/movie. Music was understated and never drew me to listen for certain melodies.

Writing, the singular difference between a phenomenal writer and okay writer is editing and ability to tell stories that are complex and faithful to their idealized mental version that they pre-wrote in their mind. Knowing the arch of their characters and not considering feelings of their demographic audience. Fidelity to the story is all that matters. Audiences are self-selective.

I bought the DVD. I'll watch it again. This is really timeless and the overall experience is enthralling. I never minded reading subtitles!",1368576000,2,1891,4.869158878504673
3945461,4,B002L5GQMI,"""Easy Money"" (""Snabba cash"") is a Swedish thriller and character drama based on the novel of the same name by  Jens Lapidus. JW (Joel Kinnaman) is an economics student in Stockholm who dreams of a glamorous lifestyle. He drives a taxi to make money, while he struggles to fit in with rich friends. Jorge (Matias Padin) is a career criminal from South America who has just escaped from a Swedish prison. JW's employer Abdulkarim (Mahmut Suvakci) and Serbian crime lord Radovan (Dejan Cukic) both want to find Jorge, as he is well-connected to a cocaine supplier in Germany. Radovan gets his enforcer Mrado (Dragomir Mrsic) after Jorge, and Abdulkarim offers to pay JW to find him. Abdulkarim wants to import cocaine, and JW sees an opportunity to insinuate himself in the financial community by having Abdulkarim buy a troubled investment bank to launder the drug money. But Radovan doesn't want the competition, and JW doesn't understand what he's gotten into.

""Easy Money"" is a much darker film than Sweden usually produces. This is a fine script by Maria Karlsson, but much of the credit for its success is due Joel Kinnaman, who conveys JW's insecurities and his ambitions so well. JW is a bit of a dandy, replacing the buttons on cheap shirts to make them look more stylish, pasting pictures from GQ on his dorm room walls. He's convinced that his rich girlfriend Sophie (Lisa Henni) won't want anything to do with him if he isn't rich too. Joel Kinnaman is a tall, blonde, handsome man, a Nordic vision among the many immigrants in the criminal underworld. I don't know if ""Easy Money"" is trying to make an anti-immigration statement or if it is true that the overwhelming majority of organized crime in Sweden is carried out by immigrants. But the criminals are all Serbian, Arab, or Armenian. Or at least the violent criminals are. The film tends to equate criminals and bankers, who are Swedish.

The crux of the story is JW's descent into a trap of his own making. He's a bright, capable man who abandoned a fledgling career in finance, because he felt the need to get rich quick. His insecurities over his socio-economic status and humble roots consume him. He is thankfully not a talkative fellow, rather his predicament shows in his actions and his quiet expressions. My only criticism of director Daniel Espinosa concerns the handheld camera. The camera wobbles all the time. It's distracting. Most scenes would have benefited from a tripod. Apart from that, this is an affecting, dark portrait of ambition on the part of some organized criminals and a Swede who went astray. The authors and director don't seem to care much for material ambitions, but one can't help but be sympathetic to JW at some point, tanks to Kinnaman. In Swedish, Serbian, and Spanish with optional English, English SDH, and Spanish subtitles on the Anchor Bay 2013 DVD.",1367884800,8,2859,4.842535787321063

It was hard to follow since there is not always transitional material between day/night and Jorge/Mrado storylines in the beginning. I also had trouble distinguishing voices of who was on the other end of a phone call. This might be because I was reading subtitles and don't understand the language of the speaker. There are at least three languages, probably four in this movie: Swedish, Spanish, and English, likely Serbian is the fourth, but I'm guessing.

Subtitles are all in English.

8372396,5,B002L5GQMI,"This movie is the proof that in some -though rare- occasions the film adaptation of a book is better than the novel itself. ''Snabba Cash'' is based on the trilogy of crime novels written by one of the most successful criminal defense attorneys in today's Stockholm, Jens Lapidus, so there are two more films (Snabba Cash 2-''Hard To Kill'' and Snabba Cash 3-''Life Deluxe''). The writer's invaluable professional experiences and communication with real criminals benefit the realism element in the book and is reflected both in the wonderful descriptions of Stockholm's ugly side as well as the ''natural'' dialogues. As far as the film is concerned I believe that the first one is the best of the three, directed by Daniel Espinoza (''Den frdmde'', ''Child 44'') and starring a wonderful cast with Joel Kinnaman (JW), Dragomir -''Gago''- Mrsic (Mrado) and Cristian Varela (Jorge) as the three main protagonists. The movie is a penetrative look at Stockholm's underbelly nowadays, following the lives of JW, a young lad from Sweden's countryside who uses his bright mind in order to invade Stockholm's aristocrats' social circle, Mrado who is a Serbian mafioso and enforcer with a little daughter and finally Jorge, a Latin immigrant who manages to escape from prison and frantically search an effective way in order to make easy money. The lives of those three intersect and a well-crafted plot, which remains faithful to the book, is beginning to unfold in front of the reader's eyes. This is a fast-paced film with some action and really great characters: Mrado is more than convincing as the Yugoslavian thug causing pain and disaster as Dragomir Mrsic (who was himself a bank robber, arrested at 1990 and sentenced to three and a half years of incarceration in Hall prison) delivers a totally brilliant performance which shows that the Bosnia and Herzegovina born actor has a lot of potentials. His acting is one of the -many- highlights of the film while both Kinnaman and Varela deliver more than satisfying performances of their roles. I would also like to mention Dejan Cukic who is terrific in a rather brief appearance, incarnating the Serbian mob boss Radovan.''Snabba Cash'' is a fast-tempo modern-day film which proves that Europeans can produce great films of the crime genre. This is an absolute must-read for all crime fiction addicts.",1527552000,,2353,5.082687338501292
