2417675,5,B000BITUVG,"Homing pigeons get to be the heroes in Disney's VALIANT, a charming and entertaining addition to the Disney library.  Valiant is a young pigeon who wants to join the Royal Homing Pigeons Service to help the Allies in WWII.  Despite his diminutive size and relative youth, Valiant heads off to London and meets the cunning pigeon Bugsy, who signs up to avoid a confrontation with two of his marks.  They all go through the rigorous training with expected hilarious antics and then they are called upon for a very special mission by General Gutsy himself.  The pigeons must face the deadly falcons, headed by the notorious General von Talon, but all comes out for our side in this enjoyable movie.  The voices are all fine from Ewan McGregor as Valiant to Ricky Gervais as Bugsy and fine support too from Tim Curry as the villainouw Talon and John Hurt, Hugh Laurie and Jim Broadbent.  The animation is marvelous with each bird having almost human faces and the colors are vivid and alluring.  Kids and adults both should find VALIANT princely fun.",1136246400,5,1046,4.745856353591161
2417676,5,B000BITUVG,I thought this was a cute movie with charming characters. People who gave it a negative review need to lighten up.,1134777600,7,114,4.476190476190476
2417677,5,B000BITUVG,"Finally they made a movie that REALLY is for KIDS! I thought that this movie was SO cute and kept my 4 boys entertained - without the VERY inappropriate ADULT content that is usually in ""kids"" movies.

to the other reviewers who that that this movie was dumb-

No, this movie is probably not a movie that adults will want to watch over and over again- but I am sure that your kids will - and that's who the movie is for right?",1134345600,26,426,4.120481927710843
2417678,3,B000BITUVG,This movie was ok for adults but my 3 year old son loved it.  Will definately buy when it comes out on DVD.,1134345600,5,107,3.652173913043478
2417679,5,B000BITUVG,"I sat down to this DVD with no idea what it was about other than my husband thought it looked cute. I was dubious and doubtful, but it ended up bringing tears to my eyes (although I cry easily anyway!).

This is the story of a brave WW II British homing pigeon, named Valiant, and his quest to get his message back home despite difficult situations. He is part of Squad F of the Royal Homing Pigeon Service, and after one of his comrades is trapped by enemy falcons, notably General Von Talon, it is up to Valiant to get the message home.

I had no idea that over 50% of all the medals awarded to animal war heros in WW II went to homing pigeons. I didn't even know that animals were given medals during the war, and I can tell you that I was happy to see 2 or 3 cats had received medals as well.

A feel-good movie. The French mouse Charles La Girl is a fantastic secondary character worth the price of the DVD alone.",1133395200,8,918,4.11731843575419
2417680,1,B000BITUVG,"The problem is not that this movie isn't a joint project between Pixar and Disney. It was pretty good in animation, but it was hollow! it made no sense! there is no plot. of course there is a plot but an extremely ridicolous one! If I were disney, I would not distribute this freak and would bury this freak for my own reputation. Dont even try to watch it. its totally waste of time and money.",1132876800,5,394,4.197368421052632
2417681,4,B000BITUVG,"I am a huge fan of British humor. As a Canadian, I feel a little more in tune with the British way of life, and I think that's why Valiant was so funny.

Firstly, Ewan McGregors performance in Valiant was a thousand times better than his lacklustre performance in that peice of Fox trash, Robots.

The inclusion of Ricky Gervais, still hot off his BBC series ""The Office"", which is now a successful NBC program, was a good choice. His attitude for the supporting role was just what the film needed. Add in John Cleese, Jim Broadbent and Tim Curry, and you have a grade-A BRITISH film. I feel it didn't hit well with ""foreign"" audiences, as much as it did in the UK.

Top that off with a pathetic marketing campaign, it's no wonder it didn't do well.

Now, as for any dissident critics? Meh, they're de-sensitised by Dreamworks and Fox right now, who feel they can just pop out a CGI movie every 6 months and still wow an audience.

Valiant is a good family film dealing with subjects that children never can grasp though film without being horrified.",1131494400,12,1050,4.476439790575916
2417682,1,B000BITUVG,"What a stinker!  The writing is on the wall with this one.  Disney tried to show Pixar it could do CG movies without them, and what a failure!  And from the reviews Chicken Little is getting, it looks like 2 bombs in a row for the Mouse House.  They seriously need to think about sticking to 2D animation, and leave the CG stuff to the professionals, or risk ruining their reputation.  Maybe they shouldn't have been so greedy with Pixar's contract, & Steve Jobs could've saved them, oh well.",1131062400,5,492,4.48314606741573
2417693,5,B000BITUVG,A wonderfully imaginative story that introduces children to the vital role played by pigeons during WWII. I like the fact that it is a story told from the bird's point of view.,1482451200,,176,4.53125
2417694,5,B000BITUVG,my son loved this movie,1477267200,,23,3.8
2417695,4,B000BITUVG,good,1476576000,,4,4.0
2417696,2,B000BITUVG,"I'm a fan of Disney, but even I'm forced to admit that they've made their share of missteps over the years, especially in more recent years.  And sadly, I have to say that ""Valiant"" is one such misstep.  It's not that it's a CGI movie made outside the Disney/Pixar partnership -- Disney has had some fantastic non-Pixar CGI movies, such as ""Wreck-It Ralph,"" ""Tangled,"" ""Big Hero 6,"" and others.  But in comparison to those films, which strive for excellent animation, story, and characters, ""Valiant"" doesn't even try.  It's certainly not the worst movie, or even the worst Disney movie, I've ever seen, but it's pretty mediocre anyhow.

The titular Valiant is a young pigeon (voice by Ewan McGregor), small but spirited and longing to join the war effort during WWII -- namely, the ranks of the carrier pigeons who ferried information back and forth during the war.  He signs up, and alongside a ragtag group of fellow pigeons -- a scruffy con-bird named Bugsy (Ricky Gervais), an uppity intellectual named Lofty, and oafish twin brothers Tailfeather and Toughwood -- undergoes rigorous training... and falls for a sweet nurse dove named Victoria.  Eventually they're sent to retrieve a vital message under the command of Wing Commander Gutsy (Hugh Laurie), which is being safeguarded by a group of mice working for the French Resistance.  But the German forces have their own bird soldiers -- a band of falcons, led by the sinister Von Talon (Tim Curry), who hunt down and kill messenger birds.  Can Valiant and his ragtag crew escape the falcons and transmit the message that will change the course of the war?

The animation of this film looks a bit dated, but I can give that a pass seeing as it was released in 2005.  While not up to the standards of the Pixar and Dreamworks films that came out around the same time, it's competent enough, and even quite good when it comes to giving the birds personality and facial expressions.  Some of the scenery shots, such as the French town and the English countryside, are beautiful.  There are quite a few scenes of fog and darkness, however, which make me suspect these were added to cover up shortcomings in the art and animation.

The voicework is also decent, though not exceptional.  The film has a LOT of big-name British actors among its voice cast, including Ewan McGregor, Ricky Gervais, John Cleese, Jim Broadbent, Hugh Laurie, and Tim Curry.  I do appreciate the film making the effort to find actors with the appropriate accents instead of just relying on American actors and having them fake their accents, and while some of the British colloquialisms can fly over younger viewers' heads, for the most part I appreciate the authenticity.  (The French and German accents sound horrifically fake, though...)

My major complaints regarding the film are that the story and characters.  The story, despite taking place during one of the most infamous wars in history, is exceptionally juvenile.  I know this is a film aimed at kids, but it's still very jarring to see such a light-hearted romp taking place during a war that took millions of lives and uncovered such atrocities as the Holocaust.  I'm sure even kids can appreciate the seriousness of such a time period, but this film treats it quite lightly, almost as an afterthought.  Plot holes and weird attempts at humor that fall flat don't help matters either.

I could have been a little more lenient on the story's shortcomings if the characters had been memorable at all... but here they're just annoying cliches and stereotypes.  Valiant is pretty much every ""short but spunky young fighter"" trope ever (and frankly, ""Captain America"" does the trope much better).  His teammates are pretty much idiots (even the supposedly intellectual Lofty), the officers uniformly gruff without any additional characterization, and the female characters, with one single exception, make absolutely no impact on the plot.  Seriously, Victoria plays no role in the movie save to provide a love interest to Valiant when he comes home.  The only other female characters of note are Valiant's mother, who serves only to fuss over him in the beginning and end, and a female mouse who works for the Resistance and provides some rather uncomfortable interspecies ogling at her appearance.  The only really memorable character is the second mouse, a pyromaniac saboteur, and even he gets annoying after awhile.

The film does take a moment toward the end to acknowledge the carrier-pigeons that aided the war effort, and the fact that falcons were trained to take down said birds has some grounding in historical fact.  But I feel the subject matter deserved a better film than ""Valiant.""  It's harmless enough, I suppose, and kids will probably enjoy it, but I feel it's a waste of 75 minutes.  At least it's fairly short, and not overly obnoxious like ""Chicken Little"" or Dreamworks' ""Madagascar"" movies.  You could certainly do worse in your movie purchases, but you could do far better too -- CGI Disney films like ""Wreck-It Ralph,"" ""Big Hero 6,"" and even ""Bolt"" are far superior choices.",1475020800,,5088,4.934272300469484
2417697,4,B000BITUVG,"Not everything has to be clever enough for adults to ""tolerate it.""  It's a good, simple story about courage, determination and the ""little guy"" doing just as well as the big, tough guys. I don't think this movie gets the credit or views that it should.
Wonderful movie to introduce kids and adults to parts of WW2 they might not know about.  Many Americans don't know about the British end of the war and very few even know about carrier pigeons and the incredible work they did during the war.  I thought it was fun and well-done. It had some definite scary moments (but not TOO scary for little kids) and was, all in all, very enjoyable.  For an adult who knows their WW2 history, especially the British military, the characters, especially the Sgt. Major will ring true.  I hope it did better in the U.K. I think this movie could be a great bridge for anyone to learn more about WW2.",1473379200,,887,4.450617283950617

2417801,4,B000BITUVG,"A full-length animated film produced and distributed by Walt Disney, VALIANT is a WWII movie about messenger pigeons made for kids.  The title of the movie refers to two things.  The first is the film's central character, a smaller-than-average pigeon determined to make a difference in the war for his country and queen.  The second is the characteristic that each of the pigeons featured in the movie have, despite deceiving appearances.

After seeing a propaganda recruiting film and being visited by his hero and the most decorated of all pigeons, Gutsy (Hugh Laurie), Valiant (Ewan McGregor) decides to join the Royal Homing Pigeon Service.  He sets off for London where he encounters and befriends a con-pigeon named Bugsy (Ricky Gervais).  Using Valiant as a shield from two other birds he has duped, Bugsy helps get Valiant into the RHPS and unwittingly signs up himself.  The two birds are shipped off for training.  They are joined with three other birds and are told by the instructor they are Squadron F.  As it turns out, the German falcon attacks have been brutal on the RHPS and Squadron's A-E have either been decimated or completely eradicated.  Squadron F is sent before their training is complete to accompany Gutsy on a top secret mission: to retrieve a message that could change the course of the war.  Trouble ensues when Gutsy goes MIA and Squadron F has to figure out exactly what their mission is and how to complete it without getting eaten by the German falcons.

The animation in VALIANT is well done.  It's all CGI, but not the type of CGI where everything looks more real than reality.  Instead, the filmmakers have created a classy and colorful retro-style animation.  VALIANT is a cartoon, but one that is clean and crisp.  The overall story is formulaic and kind of short, but it's a movie that children will have no difficulty in following.

The very end of the movie has a short note about the Dickin Medal, a medal awarded to animals for ""displaying conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty whilst serving with British Commonwealth armed forces or civil emergency services.""  The medal was awarded to 18 dogs, 3 horses, a cat, and 32 pigeons for their ""service"" during WWII.  After watching the movie, I did a little researched and was pleasantly surprised to discover there was an actual National Pigeon Service in England during WWII.  So, though VALIANT is a fictional animated film, it is actually rooted in some historical facts.

I really enjoyed VALIANT.  The story was formulaic and could have been a bit longer, but it entertained me the entire time.  I particularly enjoyed the style of animation in the film.  The movie is aimed at children.  There are some historic and cultural references that might be lost upon children, but they aren't thrown in as jokes.  The references are integral part of the film's setting and plot.  There's enough info hear that can provide several teachable moments for youngsters about history and England.",1292198400,2,2986,4.896414342629482
2417802,4,B000BITUVG,"Unknown to many, the middle of the decade represented a very rocky period for our pampered friends at Disney in terms of their market share in the highly competitive arena of computer generated animated feature films.  It turns out that much of their prior success in the category was thanks in no small part to the efforts of Pixar.  Well when the two companies couldn't come to an agreement of terms, it was looking like ""the Diz"" may have to seriously consider a Pixar-less future!

What resulted in those turbulent times were a few less-than-stellar Disney branded CG-features like 2006's The Wild, 2005's Chicken Little and of course the film being reviewed here, 2005's Valiant.

While in no danger of being mistaken as the next massive budget Pixar blockbuster, Valiant was able to attract some179 modelers, animators, shaders, and texturers at Ealing Studios in London. Valiant, a product of Vanguard Animation has the distinction of being the first CGI film to be made in Britain.

With a budget of $35,000,000, Valiant had a conspicuously low cap when compared to most other CG-animated features of the era (especially for those with a major studio attached to the project).  106 weeks in production, it was finally released to the UK in May of 2005 then enjoyed Stateside release August of that same year.  It was released on DVD in December of 2005 and at the time of this review's writing, has grossed nearly double its initial budget, making it a studio success (despite totals that still look only like a small fraction of most CGI feature's initial budgets).

Inspired by true-to-life stories of carrier pigeons trained to carry vital information for the allied forces across the English Channel during World War II, this film's story centers on the life of a young pip-squeak pigeon named Valiant (voiced by Ewan McGregor), who volunteers to fight for his country from German oppression.

Despite being physically unsuitable, he manages to join the Royal Homing Pigeon Service (RHPS), an elite group of heroic carrier pigeons. Because the RHPS has been nearly depleted of reserves, they are desperate for new recruits, and as such Valiant and his ragtag group of flunkies find themselves on nearly-immediate assignment as F-Squad.

The mission they embark upon after minimal training is to fly to occupied France and deliver a message from the French Resistance back to London. They meet with French Resistance mice Charles De Girl (Sharon Horgan), master of sabotage Rollo, and the head of Resistance to retrieve the important message.

However, this is no flight in the park, as they soon discover, when the evil German Nazi falcon General Von Talon (voiced by Tim Curry) and his group of enemy falcons intercepts the message in transit back to England.  The mission changes from high-risk couriering to simply surviving the Second World War.

In all, especially considering the film's setting, Vanguard managed to pull off a pretty impressive effort of capturing the scale of war without violence or gore of any kind.  The characters are well done enough (especially that of the title character, Ricky Gervais as dirty-bird Bugsy and Hugh Laurie's heroic Gutsy) to keep even the younger viewers enthralled without the benefit of the subtle historical charm.

The visuals are certainly passable, even now, with the only complaint coming in the form of rather bland backgrounds (especially compared to the modern trend of 3D integration).  However the character models are unique, requisitely adorable and very well animated.

Pacing can best be described as brisk, as after all, a 76-minute runtime places this one on the shorter end of the spectrum.  Further disappointing the DVD's entertainment value is that the disc contains virtually no extras.  Expect the total experience to last a hair over an hour and fifteen minutes.

Scoring is also passable without instances of praise or complaint.  The mood and feel is always set era-appropriately and the sound effects are nice and crisp (especially when enjoyed on a modern surround sound system).

In all the critics have been fairly harsh with this film since its inception and I too went into it expecting a bleak, dolled up attempt at a history lesson but came away pretty squarely entertained.  It's true that the film does nothing to totally blow audiences away, it can just as honestly lay claims to do nothing overly offensive either.

At the end of the day, viewers looking for a pretty fun romp that actually integrates just enough historical setting to separate it from the rest of the pack, will likely come away with something to appreciate.  The fact that it pays tribute to the efforts of real-life animals that have made a difference in the outcomes of human wars is just an added bonus in the film's investment value.",1290902400,2,4805,5.006281407035176
2417819,3,B000BITUVG,"""Valiant"" is a serviceable film with a serviceable premise filled with serviceable characters on a serviceable escaped with serviceable danger that's serviceably fun for the serviceable family, made in service by Disney and a British company.  How incredibly boring, this is nothing but manufactured animation being made for a direct-to-rental shop, with little soul or care given into the promise.  But to be fair, it's better than ""Shark Tale"" on two regards: no one in the film has made absurd pop-culture references and it didn't have Missy Elliott doing a REEEMIIIIIIIIIIIX.  Give the film credit for that.

I cannot, however, give credit for its ho-hum production.  For a 2005 movie, its art design is of low-quality and the character animation is stiff and wonky like an episode of ""Penguins from Madagascar"".  It doesn't seem to care about the plot development either, because it spend so much time making the characters do silly things instead of fleshing them out and make them wholesome, likable creatures.  There's no suspense, thrill, intrigue, tragedy, or enlightenment happening in this adventure.

For having such a stellar cast of British comedic talents and celebrities, none of them rise to the challenge of making their 3-D characters more than one-dimensional.  The main character is idealistic and valor, but nothing else defines him as to why he's brave or did selfless things, making him dull; just because he's called Valiant doesn't mean he has to live up to his name.  His love-interest has more depth than a sticky note, was about as important as bird poo and has the screen presence of a cigarette burn, no actual personality whatsoever.  The buttpigeons of the movie are silly for their own sake rather than the audience's and the villains are no more threatening than a hangnail when their 'cunning' intimations are pathetic. These characters are so uninteresting, I can't remember their names besides Valiant's...and it's because of the title.

Here's a thought: this is a G-rated animated film about birds, being made by a British company.  Did that remind you of something?

2417823,4,B000BITUVG,"I can see where this Disney animated feature film really never made it big-time. It offers some really good things but overall, it just isn't funny enough to be a hit.

It certainly has the visuals to be a smash. Man, this is a beautiful film. The colors are bold and brilliant, scene after scene. It's a visual feast. For that reason alone, I give it five ""stars.""

Some of the humor is funny and very clever, but not enough of it. The story is a takeoff on old World War II films which kids will never ""get."" Too much of the gags involve slapstick as one of the pigeons flies into a wall or falls down, making a loud noise or that ""Bugsy"" belches and farts a lot. That happens frequently and wears thin fast. The laughs come more with the subtle stuff.

Story-wise, it's the usual little guy or misfits-being-heroes story, so common in films. Valiant is the little pigeon who really shouldn't even be in the Royal Homing Pigeon Service because he's too little, but he gets in, along with his aforementioned smelly friend ""Bugsy"" and then inspires everyone while also wooing a pretty nurse.

2417827,4,B000BITUVG,"This is an animated adventure comedy about heroic homing pigeons who are fighting for freedom during WW2.

Because the standard of animated films is getting so high, these films have to be very good indeed to impress adults. I thought it was OK the first time I watched it with my children, though no better than that. However, as I write this review my children are currently watching it for the third time at their request. Holding the attention of a pair of five year olds for the length of even a short film (it's about 76 minutes) is quite an achievement.

The title character is a tiny pigeon, voiced by Ewan McGregor, who is determined to be a hero. He joins the Royal Homing Pigeon service, and finds himself serving with a band of misfits who have to get messages through in the face of the german falcons.

The cast and plot takes the mickey out of many war stories, and fans of British wartime comedies such as Blackadder goes Forth, 'Allo 'Allo, and especially ""It ain't half hot, Mum"" will recognise characters from these shows reincarnated as pigeons. If you've never watched any British comedies set in World War II, think of the stock characters in Hogan's Heroes or even serious American war films and the same point will still largely apply.

The voice cast, which also includes Hugh Laurie, Ricky Gervais, Tim Curry, and John Cleese, do a professional and sometimes very amusing job of recreating all the wartime film stereotypes.

Yes, of course they're stereotypes - that's the whole point of the joke, in taking the mickey out of the stereotypes.

At the very end of the film shows a short written statment is displayed about the true history of animal bravery during world war 2, which I found strangely moving.

I don't think this film would have been great value for money if bought at the original full price. However, having initially rented it, and then on establishing that my children liked it, put it on the list to buy when it became available cheaply, I'm happy that the pleasure they gained from watching it did justify the relatively limited outlay.",1170806400,2,2084,4.6775956284153
2417838,4,B000BITUVG,"I often wonder why some people automatically assume that if a computer-animated Disney film isn't done by Pixar, then it's no good.  ""Chicken Little"" was trashed by the critics, but it was a wonderful family feature that was fun to watch for young and old alike.  ""The Wild,"" though not as good as ""Chicken Little,"" was a solid family film that took a lot of flack for being similar to ""Madagascar.""  And here's ""Valiant,"" an animated tale that never had a chance in the realm of Pixar vs. Disney.

It's really a fun tale that's short, to the point, and full of wonderful voice talents.  Critics say that it's too formulaic and downright boring at times and yes, the tale of a small, seemingly insignificant person stepping up to do heroic things isn't original, but it's delivered here in fine fashion.  Young Valiant wants to do his part to secure the freedom of his country during WWII.  He signs up with the Royal Homing Pigeon Service to deliver secret and urgent messages to the Allies from the French Resistance.  He heads up a bungling line-up of brutes, well-to-dos and Bugsy, a smelly but heartfelt friend that Valiant picks up along the way to join the service.  The evil Nazi falcon, Von Talon, and his interceptors have picked the homing pigeons clean, leaving only Valiant and his buds to retrieve a crucial message for the Allies.  Can Valiant and his friends overcome the odds and save jolly ol' England?  You have to watch to find out.

As stated before, there are plenty of wonderful voice talents in this film.  Ewan McGregor provides the voice of Valiant, and does so with youthful exuberance.  Hugh Laurie voices Gutsy, champion of the homing pigeons.  Tim Curry is devilishly fun as Von Talon.  Ricky Gervais (Bugsy), John Hurt (Felix), and John Cleese (Mercury) head up the rest of a fine cast of voice talents.

The animation is great.  Though nothing groundbreaking is found here (excepting the chase scene involving Valiant and Von Talon, which I thought was wonderful), the animation holds up very well to most other computer animated flicks of today.  The music is fun as well.  There are a few deaths (offscreen) that parents might have to explain to their children, but they are brief and do not happen to the main characters.

One thing that I really enjoyed about this film is that it gives youngsters a brief bit of history about World War II.  Granted, it doesn't flesh out the actions at Normandy, but it might trigger your child's interest in history, which can't be a bad thing.  The mention of the Dickin Medal at the end of this flick is also an interesting fact to know.

This isn't the greatest Disney flick ever made.  However, there's plenty here for both children and adults to enjoy, and you'll be kicking yourself for not checking this movie out earlier.  It's a nice family film and will easily earn its spot on your family DVD shelf.  I highly recommend it.",1169942400,6,2905,4.678500986193294

2417840,4,B000BITUVG,"Here a question, that I would like to know, will Disney ever pul them selves out of this slump, and return with really great animated movies, that will live up to such classics like The Lion King, Aladdin, The Little Mermaid, Tarzan, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, and Beauty and the Beast. And could you get any better then casting Tim Curry as the voice of the villian? It does seem to me, that when ever he has a voice in animated movie, it is also a role as the villain in the movie, no matter if it is a person, animal, or a musical insterment. But if you were to make an animated movie with British characters, then Tim Curry would be a peferct choice to do one of the voices, and that is what he does here, and once again he voices another villian. Does he have just the right look for a villain, or what makes studios that decide to get him to voice the villian in thier movie? Valiant takes place in London in 1944, during World War II. Valcons that live in Gerrmany, are taking prisoners, piegons that are serving Royal Homing Pigeon Service (RHPS). Which leads them, to put out the search for more piegons, including new recruirts. And they put out the search call during a propaganda film, which gets to the title character Valiant's (Ewan McGregor), but even through he is a galf pint piegon, even through others don't think he will last out there, decides to sign up. He lives with his Mother, and even through she is against the idea, she still lets him go to a tryout that he is directed to in London. There he meets Bugsy (Ricky Gervais), who is shell-game hustling pigeon, he joins him to the headquarters. And he ends up signed up by mistake, and they had off for trainning, but has to end quicky when Wing Commander Gutsy (Hugh Laurie) returns that brave bird, Mercury (John Cleese) has disappeared, and now squad F who is the best they got, have to report for duty. He was kidnapped or should I say bird napped by a falacon named General Von Talon (Tim Curry). Who not only taken Mercury, but also has orders to get the message, that his squad has to bring to headquarters. Squard F's ordrs which include Valiant and Bugsy, is simple, track down the message, with barely any info of the whereabouts.",1166400000,,2218,4.399026763990268
2417841,2,B000BITUVG,"One word to describe this movie is, Dissappointing.  Truly this movie even more so than Chicken Little is proof that Disney really lost it's touch for the animated movie.

You have to remember that this movie was made during the limbo time when Disney decided it did not need Pixar pictures, and believed they could make a better picture than anything Pixar had made.  So they produce Valient and Chicken Little.  While Chicken Little is a far superior movie to Valient (which isn't saying much), at least the story, music and character development in Chicken Little was ok.  In Valient all of those things are missing.  The story intially sounds great, homing pigeons in WWII, fighting the nazis, and all, but when you get down to the meat of the script it is so bad, only the most glassy-eyed child can sit through the whole movie.

The characters are underdeveloped, and the soundtrack is very forgetable.  But what makes this movie so bad for me is that it was a great idea.  A great idea that Disney took in completly the wrong direction.  In the movie ""Hook"" a grown-up Peter Pan comes back to Neverland and the lost boys make a revelation that Peter had forgotten everything.  The master of all the tricks and games had forgotten how to play.  Well after watching this movie I couldn't help but think the same thing.  The master(disney animation) had forgotten everything.

The only good thing I can take from this movie is a memory of a time in the early 80's when Disney was in a similar slump.  They changed direction and came out with some of the greatest animated movies ever made beginning with the Little Mermaid.  After Valient and Chicken Little Disney changed direction again and bought out Pixar and now Pixar is making all the animated movies for Disney.  And after watching Cars and the trailer for ""Meet the Robinsons"" it looks as if history is about to repeat itself.

In short about Valient, Skip it!",1161388800,2,1923,4.655786350148368

2417843,4,B000BITUVG,"I've read some of the worse reviews here and frankly I'm tired of those people who expect every animated film that comes out to live up to the adult-friendly nature of Shrek or The Incredibles. If you want that kind of film then by all means go put your Shrek, Shrek II or whatever you love the most in the DVD player and watch it over and over again because you'll never be happy with anything else.

The animation here is actually quite good, the plot is simple and easy to understand: young go-getter wants to make good for his country and he and a motley crew of fellow homing pigeons go to enemy lines to retrieve information that can change the outcome of the war. Yes it's formulaic and easy to predict what will happen, but it's enjoyable nonetheless.

Ewan McGregor is a little vocally hyper but acceptable as the pipsqueeky, small-in-stature but but tall-in-character Valiant.  John Cleese does his usual brilliant, dry British humor shtick as a senior homing pigeon caught behind enemy lines. Tim Curry hams it up as usual as the evil ring-leader falcon. But my favorite characters were the highbrow, putting-on-airs humor of Hugh Laurie's Lofty and Ricky Gervais' hilarious, ill-bred but heart-of-gold Bugsy. I really laughed out loud with their lines, more than any other point in the movie.

I read a review elsewhere that says this film is aimed more at ""older folks"" and spoofs WWII movies of years gone by, but my 3-year old daughter loves this film!

And some have said it's too short, but I think it's the perfect length for youngsters to watch.  Having seen it about 20 times in the last two weeks I'm not bored with it at all.

I enjoy the cultural references to England and the WWII era, and I also appreciate that, in a way, this is exposing my kids, young as they are, to a very important time in our history. Perhaps someday they will correlate their history lessons with this film and something will gel because of seeing this version of history, because the fact is, homing pigeons were really used in WWII.",1152057600,43,2034,4.617728531855955
2417844,4,B000BITUVG,"I don't really understand the lukewarm reaction to this film, as I found Valiant to be an excellent animated film.  The story is both interesting and compelling, the voice actors do a great job, there's plenty of comedy from start to finish, and I thought the animation itself was quite good.  There's too much emphasis these days on high-tech, fancy animation - sure, it can be very cool, but a cartoon with a good story and wonderful characters doesn't need the fanciest new animation.  In fact, a good story can get lost in too much CGI wizardry, and I for one like a more traditional look.  I don't mean to say the animation here is simplistic because it's not; it's just not as fancy as some viewers apparently wanted it to be.  This isn't The Matrix; it's a movie-length cartoon.

The setting is 1944.  With World War II still raging, the Royal Air Force Homing Pigeon Brigade, having suffered extensive losses delivering important messages to and from enemy lines, is looking for a few good pigeons.  Valiant (voiced wonderfully by Ewan McGregor) is determined to leave the nest and prove himself, especially if it means serving alongside heroes such as the celebrated Gutsy (Hugh Laurie).  No one thinks he can make it (he's not even ""yea"" high, for one thing), but he's determined to prove everyone wrong and do his part in the fight for freedom.  Arriving in London, he meets up with a smelly old con pigeon named Bugsy (Ricky Gervais), who sort of accidentally signs up for service alongside him.  They both fit right in to the band of misfits who make up Squadron F (Lofty, the intellectual, blue-blood and two brothers sporting more brawn than brain).  Unfortunately, it falls to this lot - even before their training is complete - to take on the mission that, if successful, may well win the war for the Allies.  It will be highly dangerous, though, as they must avoid the enemy's deadly falcons, led by the formidable Von Talon (Tim Curry).

Is it predictable?  Yes, of course it is.  It's a family-friendly, G-rated cartoon, after all.  Any young child can understand the story.  The only problem I had with the film was its rather short running time of 76 minutes.  The big scenes at the end do feel a tad rushed, and one can only wonder why they couldn't add in a few more minutes to round things off a little more effectively.  This, however, is a small complaint on my part, as I found this movie immensely entertaining.

I was especially pleased by the note at the end of the film acknowledging the important contribution different animals actually did perform in World War II - especially carrier pigeons, who won 24 Dickens Medals for their heroic service.  I would encourage Valiant fans to read a little about such avian heroes as GI Joe, who saved the British forces occupying an Italian town from American bombing, Cher Ami, who (despite being shot in both the chest and the leg) delivered a message that saved forces trapped behind enemy lines from devastating friendly fire, and many other unsung non-human war heroes.",1144886400,23,3047,4.709433962264151

This is the kind of movie that I want my children to see, not some pointless, thoughtless film like Madagascar, Finding Nemo, or some other highly ridiculous Disney movie.  I am rarely impressed with animated films nowadays, but this one was different.  I actually liked how the film did not try to cater to an adult's tastes just for the money it might generate.

2417847,3,B000BITUVG,"The problem with ""Valiant"" is that it doesn't really break any new ground.  It's saddled with a strictly by the book ""Little guy proves he's got the stuff"" storyline.  This could've been overcome if the script was a little more lively, the animation a little more creative, the action a touch more compelling.  But these areas don't pick up the slack.

There's nothing really wrong with the film, but there's not a whole lot right with it either.  While I liked the characters, they never transcended their simple intent (snooty bird, slob bird, battling brothers, evil falcon leader, etc.).  And never once did I have the slightest moment of suspense over the outcome.  Of course, I knew our hero wasn't going to be killed.  That's a given.  But usually the unpredictability of the story keeps me involved.  Not in this one.

Okay, so I'm not a kid.  A kid would probably like it.  But in this new age of animation, the bar has been raised exceedingly high, and Valiant falls wells short.  On the plus side, I thought much of the quieter animation and character design was excellent.
