374953,5,6301805429,"This has got to be the very best Christmas Movie in the world. I have a taped from TV version that I watch every black friday while I wrap my Christmas gifts. This is a tradition I have followed for about 15 years. The only problem is that it is a horrible copy. I have alot of static and I paused thought the comercials but it is a very bad copy. I have been looking for it on tape for years and I haven't been able to find it anywhere.
If anyone wants to see a good down to earth holiday movie this is the one for you. I rate this movie as high as I would rate ""It's A Wonderfull Life"" I feel this movie is in the same caliber and I wish it was shown on TV again.
If there is anyone who reads this and knows how to get a copy of this video, I would be forever in your debt. Please contact me at: duvallsb@aol.com with any information you can give me. Thanks",978480000,,859,3.8587570621468927
374954,5,6301805429,My wife and I both grew up on a steady diet of The Waltons. I loved it then and I still have a longing to see it every day or I just feel like it wasn't a good day period.  I am happy to say that my 4 kids enjoy watching it also.  I can see it in their eyes while they're viewing it.  They have that wonderful amazement to their faces and are full of question afterwards.  It's the same way it was when I was a kid.  We always looked for the moral of the story and I pray that my kids live by those words of wisdom that are so often passed on during each episode. I know I have and I haven't regretted one day of it.  No TV show has withstood the test of time the way this series has in  my opinion.,976579200,4,699,3.6824324324324325
374955,5,6301805429,"Please ignore all the homophobic ""wholesome traditional family values""  bull that some viewers have chosen to write.  That throws  people off of some things that they shouldn't miss and this is surely one  of them.  If you were lucky enought to see this as a child you will never  forget the beautiful visuals used for Virginia mountain life.  Patricial  Neal is heartbreaking as Olivia Walton, a role that Micheal Lerned made her  own on the series.  This is a must for me at Christmas to get me in the  proper mood.  It is like magic.",967593600,,536,4.526315789473684
374956,4,6301805429,"When I was ten, my family did not have much money. I remember switching around the dial of our black and white TV and watching this movie for the first time. The feeling I had was of having a warm blanket wrapped around  me.  The story was written so well that it spurred a the series that lasted  for many years afterward.  I strongly suggest this movie for the holidays  as well for everyone in your family to enjoy for many years to come.",945820800,8,441,4.2023809523809526
374957,5,6301805429,"As long as I can remember, I have watched the ""Homecoming"" each year. When I got married and began having children, I wanted them to enjoy  the refreshing closness of a family working together and experiencing love  for everyone around around them. So I taped the movie one day from  television and each year my family would watch it together as we decorated  our family tree. We then moved to Panama as missionaries and that first  year was extremely difficult to celebrate Christmas in 100 degree weather.  We went to watch the movie and the video was damaged and we were unable to  locate another to purchase. This is our first year home from the mission  field and I thought I would take a chance to see if Amazon had the video. I  should have know that Amazon would come through for us as in the past. Now  this year will feel more complete for us as we now go to our next mission  in Maryland.",940982400,17,899,4.355421686746988
374958,5,6301805429,"Although those of us from Central Virginia can tell that the outdoor scenes were shot elsewhere, the cast and crew do an outstanding job of recreating Depression-era life and reinforcing family values. Watch this  film with your kids.",934156800,2,234,5.157894736842105
374959,5,6301805429,"SINCE AS FAR BACK AS I CAN REMEMBER, CHRISTMAS HAS ALWAYS MEANT LOVE, HEART-WARMING JOY AND THE CLOSENESS OF FAMILY...AND JUST BY CHANCE THOSE ARE THE BASIC ELEMENTS OF THIS WONDERFUL FILM.  RECENTLY I HAD THE HONOR OF  MEETING FILM STAR RICHARD THOMAS (JOHNBOY WALTON) AND THANKED HIM FOR  BRINGING ALIVE SUCH A WONDERFUL FILM FOR GENERATIONS TO COME.  I MENTIONED  TO HIM THAT I COULDN'T SIT THROUGH A SCREENING WITHOUT TEARS COMING TO MY  EYES.  HIS RESPONSE TO ME WAS ""THEN IT LOOKS LIKE WE DID OUR  JOB.""",924393600,3,509,4.640449438202247
374960,5,6301805429,"Patricia Neal leads a familiar cast of characters who wait pensively for the delayed arrival of their father on Christmas Eve on an icy evening on Walton's Mountain.  Although the family remains cheerful and excited about  the impending holiday,  moods wax philisophical and a young boy mustquicky  become a man as he goes in search of his missing dad.  Patricia Neal is  unforgettable as Olivia Walton and her fans must agree that this is her  finest performance since ""The Subject was Roses"".  Richard Thomas  also shines as the restless adolescent, John-Boy Walton who is reluctant to  let on that his hearts desire has led him not to a practical trade, as his  father desires, but to acadamia where he can write.  Notable performances  by Edgar Bergan as the grandfather and by Ellen Corby as his wife along  with a nice job by William Windom as a depression-era Robin Hood and  Cleavon Little as a preacher man who works for two old ladies who make and  sell bootleg whiskey make this a holiday treasure that will will not be  soon forgotten.",913766400,16,1047,4.727777777777778

I know a few fans of the TV series have a hard time accepting that there are some cast differences between this and the TV series. However, Patricia Neal is terrific as Olivia Walton and gives a truly wonderful performance along with the rest of a top-notch cast.

375295,5,6301805429,"One of the best television movies ever made, this Christmas delight is the film that really started it all.  Although, Earl Hamner, Jr. had written a memoir based on his family that had been developed into a feature-length theatrical film called SPENCER'S MOUNTAIN (starring Henry Fonda and Maureen O'Hara), THE HOMECOMING: A CHRISTMAS STORY was the first to use the name of Walton and was the main basis for the beloved and long-running television show.  And although the adult performers (except for Ellen Corby as Grandma Walton) are different, the kids are all played by the same actors.  Successful upon it's first telecast, it was reshown many times over the years to much acclaim.  Beautifully acted and written, it should be on everyone's list of favorite Christmas movies.  It is presented here on DVD in superb form.  If you haven't already, treat yourself to this holiday classic!",1458950400,,891,5.0272108843537415

375297,5,6301805429,"A long-lost Christmas favorite of mine. I saw it on its TV premiere ""back in the day,"" and never again till I got this DVD. The movie is wonderful--a really classic Christmas tale of faith, family, and courage-- and the cast pleases me more than the cast of the spinoff TV series ""The Waltons."" (Nothing against Ralph Waite, but Andrew Duggan is fantastic as the Thomas Jefferson lookalike father, long awaited but only seen in the final minutes.) Patricia Neal is thoroughly convincing as a Depression-era mother, too edgy for the TV series but deeply relatable. It amazes me, decades later, how many of these scenes had stuck in my mind, instantly installing themselves as part of my permanent holiday furniture without my realizing it. Really happy to have this back. I watch it every year, more than once.",1457395200,2,809,4.827338129496403

375459,1,6301805429,"I am sorry to write such a review but I want to be truly honest in my opinion of this DVD.  We had already seen the full 9 seasons of the Waltons when we saw this one. Perhaps I would not be so harsh had I seen this first. Alas, that is not the case.  My husband and I both wanted to just turn it off as it was not a good story in any sense of the word.

I have not idea who write the plot or who picked the actors. The children were all great but the adults were a poor choice.  The mother seems to scare everyone and the father when he came home was a big huge man that scared me as I looked at him.  I guess I am comparing him to John Walton who we have come to love as the father of the children.

So glad that the ladies who make the ""recipe"" are who they are in the real series as they are perfect in every way.  The Godsies are perfect in the series but not much of added help in this DVD Just no comparison.

I am thankful that someone took a good look and changed the characters as it never would have lasted a month if they had not done so.",1430870400,,1050,3.7194570135746607

375507,5,6301805429,"I have seen the Walton's TV series for years, but never knew of this incredible FIRST Walton movie. The children appear to be about 2 years younger than the first Walton TV shows. I bought it (The Homecoming), about 7 years ago. (2007)
If you are remotely a TV series 'WALTON' fan, and haven't seen this DVD, which certainly appears to be a 'pilot' for the entire Walton TV series, you will absolutely LOVE this movie. All of the children are the SAME actors, with all of the TV adult series actors different, except for Grandma, (Ellen Corby). Patricia Neal is fantastic as the Mother, Olivia Walton.
After I saw this, and later re-viewed the TV Walton series, I then realized that there are (2) great scenes from this Pilot movie that were edited into Season 5 of the TV Walton series. One is with Richard Thomas, on the last show of season 5 (The Achievement), when his book is finally accepted in NY for publishing, and he and his parents know he is soon to leave home for good to live in NYC. The scenes go back through his life of always wanting to become a writer, and what lead up to this final show when he actively becomes one. It is so sad to view his life long journey, that led to this moment. And the best of these scenes, comes directly from this 'Homecoming' DVD, where Richard Thomas's original scene are shown of him, and they edit in Michael Learned as his Mother in place of Patricia Neal's performance. It is GREAT. They do the same thing with Mary Ellen, (when she is married in 'The Wedding' show). Again, they edit in from this original 'Homecoming' movie, (Ralph Waite for Andrew Duggan), a scene with Mary Ellen as young as you ever saw her, while showing a summary of her life that led up to her getting married.
This is a Must have DVD, if you are a Walton fan.",1424131200,3,1789,4.375375375375375

It may be due to the fact that Patricia Neal's overacting is cringe worthy. Seriously, it's almost as funny as the old Saturday Night Live sketches with Johns Lovitz and Lithgow. She sticks out like a sore thumb in a crowd of other actors who seem to understand they're playing rural family members in the depression, not thespians at the Globe Theater.",1421625600,,467,4.7073170731707314

375624,4,6301805429,"This is the movie that started the Waltons series so you'll notice different casting for Mom, Dad and Grandpa Walton as well as store owner Ike, but taken on their own, this is a highly enjoyable and emotional movie.  I give it four instead of five stars because 2/3's in the story loses a bit of its momentum and tone so it falls below the perfect mark but as soon as those two long scenes conclude, it's right back to form for a great ending.  The interaction and dialog between the Walton kids is fantastic, real and not the least bit ""Hallmark"".  I should also add that those two aforementioned scenes are not bad on their own -- they both contain great moments -- but a bit of editing would have kept the entire movie better balanced and made it perfect...for this viewer, at any rate.",1419811200,,790,4.397260273972603

It was very well received.  It talks about perseverance and humility.  Good old time Christmas story not based on toys air present or commercial Christmas.

375690,4,6301805429,"I have loved the Waltons since childhood and am still watching them from time to time.  I think I saw this original pilot of the show back in 1971.  I watched it again last evening, Thanksgiving Day, and enjoyed it very much.  However, I have always recalled Patricia Neal being called a superior actress and I reckon she was in some roles.  In this particular one however, I found her acting to be tedious and overdone.  She looked much too old to be the parent of such a young family and her acting was painful to see.  The story was wonderful, and Mr. Little, who played Hawthorne, stole the show! Maybe Michael Learned, Ralph Waite, and Will Geer are just too ingrained in our minds to see outside that box after all these years.  All in all, though, it's still a wonderful, heart warming story of a boy's search for his Daddy on Christmas eve, and Daddy coming through for the family.",1417132800,,889,4.450617283950617

Although there is a big deal made of Patricial Neal playing the Mom in this movie I feel she was really miscast, she is too old for the part. At one point she talks to the children about her wedding day, she was so young the preacher needed to know if her parents knew what she was doing, and then went on to say they had now been married for seventeen years, this seemed silly since Patrical Neal was 45 when she made this movie in 1971 and looked every bit of it.

376269,5,6301805429,"I remember seeing this for the first time when I was just a teenager, and I loved it from the start.  It was then and still is one of the best Christmas stories I have ever seen.  It's well written, exceptionally acted, dramatic and poignant, and above all for me personally, inspirational. (It gave me the idea of perhaps writing for a living, which I do indeed do). It was such a memorable and touching story that though I was happy to see it become ""The Waltons"", I have to admit that I was dubious of its chances for success.  So many times over the years a movie has inspired a TV series only see it fail miserably.  But of course anyone who has ever seen or heard of The Waltons knows that this was one glowing exception indeed.  It's wonderful to have this on DVD because for some reason it disappeared from television many years ago as a Christmastime staple.  I have watched this every Christmas on disc for the last half dozen years, (and even sneak a peak at it at other times), and it has lost nothing as to its magic and nostalgia for me.  I do believe that it could be just as popular today if it was to appear on TV again during the Christmas season as it was in the 70s...

Not only do I highly recommend this to anyone that has ever seen or loved the Waltons, but I also feel that anyone that loves Christmas stories will be enthralled by this movie.  It is a beautiful tale that will touch you again and again with every new viewing.  One last thing I have to say about this story. With all the reality shows and violence that inundates television today, I can't help but feel how much this old time poignant story of love, warmth, and family values could really be of great worth today.  I have nothing against the action series and suggestive sitcoms that are so popular now.  I only feel bad that all of the family sitcoms and shows like ""Little House"" and ""Waltons"" have all but disappeared along side them.  Pardon me if I hold onto the hope and idea that sometime soon this beautiful story will be shown once again at some future Christmas time, and the whole genre of wholesome family entertainment will make an encore appearance.  Oh how we all could really use them again...:)",1360713600,,2203,4.354523227383863

All of the children in the movie went on to do the television series, as did ""Grandma"". The rest of the characters on the movie did not go on to play in the series, but it doesn't take away from the movie at all. It's nice to be able to sit down and watch a movie that I don't have to worry about the little ones hearing bad words.

376357,5,6301805429,"This DVD is standard viewing for me every Christmas Eve.  I saw this back home with my family the first time it aired on TV, 40 years ago.  My mom seemed quite taken with the way it reminded her of her childhood during the Great Depression, especially the way the Waltons always closed their shows with, ""Goodnight, John-Boy.""  The story reveals a succession of characters and situations that viewers will identify with to one extent or another as tension develops over the delayed return of father John Walton, who is away from the family to earn money in a distant town.  I was reminded of times in my own childhood when we waited for my dad to get home from work on Christmas Eve to complete the family unit, usually with an armload of presents he had gouged out of merchants he visited along the way at last-chance sale prices.  This program portrays some of the hardships that people living through the Depression endured.  However, one hardship I can't understand is why was the barn, which contained not only the cow but the family's firewood, located half a mile from the house?  And in one scene the kids are shelling walnuts out in that barn without their coats on while it's snowing outside.  Barns are cold and smelly!  But why nit-pick?

376466,5,6301805429,"I am a big fan of the Hamner books, and the ensuing TV series.  I didn't particularly enjoy Spencer's Mountain with Henry Fonda and Maureen O'Hara.  I found that film didn't capture the spirit of the Waltons:  it was more Seven Brides for Seven Brothers.

I have to say I really liked this TV-Movie though: Grandpa, Olivia and Ike Godsey are played by Edgar Bergen, Patricia Neal, and Woodrow Parfrey respectively, different actors, than those who appear in the later TV series. This movie was done before the series was in the works.  This was a one-off, a Christmas special based on the book, ""The Homecoming""

I enjoyed all the outdoor scenes, the attention to detail, the feel of Depression-era West Virginia, and Hamner's vision of Christmas in the Blue Ridge Mountains.

One of the recurring complaints by reviewers (and certain family members) is Patricia Neal's interpretation of Olivia:  She comes off rigid, unyielding, and angry:  That was the way Ms Neal chose to play it.  In the story, she is so worried about a certain situation, that she seems to come off the rails once in a while; and poor John-Boy is usually the target of her wrath.

Saying all this, the movie only enriches the entire Waltons canon.  There are plenty of versions of the Waltons out there:  the Hollywood movie, the series, the TV-movie and the books.  If you want a bit of a shock, try reading what mischief John-Boy, or Clay-boy as he is called in the books, gets into.  As for me it all adds to the Waltons saga.

Just try to see the story of 1933 West Virginia Christmas with an open mind and enjoy it for what it is:  a thoughtful and special movie.",1354579200,,1641,4.584192439862543

John Boy is supposed to be 15, so figure his mother to be in her mid-thirties, and Ms. Neal looks at least 55. Michael Learned was better in the role and much more believable as the mother.

I get such a warm feeling when I watch this (which has become a holiday tradition for me since purchasing the DVD 8 years ago).  There is so much more going on in the story than just what's on the surface.  Even though only Ellen Corby & the actor's portraying the children continued on in the network series I still love this film.

This movie was made in the days before video/dvd and VCR's.  If you missed the showing of a movie you were just out of luck and there was no guarantee the network would dicide to air it the next year.  I'm so glad I own a DVD and can enjoy it whenever I choose!

The mother is played by the late, great Patricia Neal.  If you know her films, this alone should make you add this movie to your collection.

All of the children actors are from the series, but the Mother, Father and Grandfather are played by different actors.  It's one of those classics that the networks dropped because well it just don't fit into the politically correct society that frowns upon family values that CBS, ABC, and NBC have adopted.

376535,5,6301805429,"I can not say enough of how much I love this movie.  I was a young girl just starting high school when I watched this the first time it aired and it made me a fan for life. The older members of my family (the elders) always talked about ""The Great Depression"" and how it was for them at that time as children and this movie captures what they talked about perfectly.  There is a darker edge to this movie, not to say depressing, but more real life to me, to the Christmas tree decorating and to the gifts.  I felt more in tune with this movies edge and the actors that were in it.
  Patrica Neal was amazing in her role as Mother Walton.  She made the roll believable, for me, on how things were at that time.  The home and furnishings were even more believable. The house on the TV show was much to grand for those times to be believable.  The one character from the newer Waltons TV series that defines that role is the Grandpa, played by the late Will Geer.  He was amazing and reminded me so much of my Grandpa and the Grandma (the first and only grandma) played by the great Ellen Corby was amazing and depicted women of that generation perfectly.  Women had to be tough as nails in those days and much to admired.
  I hope that everyone will add this movie to their Christmas movies list if they never watch anything else from the series.

I had watched every episode of the Waltons ever made but hadn't seen The Homecoming until recently. It made sense of the time John Boy went to New York to make sure his novel had been received and he was thinking back to the time when his mother first found out his interest in becoming a writer. In the episode I noticed that John Boy had red hair and it was a scene I had never seen before, that's because the scene was from The Homecoming. In the episode they obviously redid the scene with Olivia, because that actress was Michael Learned instead of Patricia Neal. It was great to see all the children at such a young age and just starting out in their careers in The Homecoming. It was strange seeing different actors portraying some of the other leading roles. It was winter time in The Homecoming and the ground was covered with snow, which we never saw in the series. It made things look different.

376578,5,6301805429,"Finally picked this one up after not seeing it for many, many years. I remembered having fond memories of this movie and seeing it around Christmas many times when I was young.

When I saw it here on Amazon, I figured it was probably nostalgia and it would not be nearly as good as I remembered. Sometimes you watch an old movie and wonder ""Why did I think this was so good""? Not in this case. The movie, the story, the acting (where it counts), and the Christmas sentiment all hold up perfectly well in this made for TV movie. In some ways, its hard to believe the quality of a made for TV movie.

The Homecoming was good enough to be thought of as the pilot of The Waltons even though it was never intended to be a pilot. But much of the cast did go on to act in The Waltons series based on the same Earl Hamner, Jr. book Spencer's Mountain which was also made into a movie years earlier. The Homecoming is a simple, touching tail of a family dealing with hard times. It can really put things into perspective when you see how different and tough life was during the depression. But the story never feels like its trying to be sad or pull at your heart strings. But it will. Of course in the end, like most Christmas movies, its very uplifting.

After a viewing this year, there is no doubt in my mind that this belongs right up there with my other annual Christmas favorites, Miracle on 34th, Its a Wonderful Life, and the similarly titled but vastly different A Christmas Story (you'll shoot your eye out kid). And of course all the claymation classics. But you don't see this one run for 24 hours straight like some of those others. So, its well worth picking up and making it part of your traditional holiday viewing.",1324944000,7,1723,4.328173374613003

376609,5,6301805429,"Off all the wonderful Christmas movies to choose from, this one is my favorite. I watch it many times during the holiday season and occasionally throughout the year as well when I just want to relax and enjoy a heartwarming and uplifting story about family and what is important in life. I suppose I am drawn to it because it so closely mimics the stories my mother used to tell me about life in the country during the Depression of the 1930s. That is the setting for this movie.

This is the pilot for the TV show ""The Waltons,"" and all of the actors who played the children, as well as the grandmother, went on to play their characters in the TV show.  The Walton family included the mother, father, grandmother, grandfather, and seven children; all living together in the home, much like life used to be. The setting centers around the family anxiously waiting for the father to come home from his job a good distance away.  Word of a bus accident with injuries and fatalities creates the concern. The children, on the other hand, are excited that it is Christmas Eve, and each has his or her wish for the perfect gift from Santa.

This movie carefully and gently shows what life was like for families who struggled during those years, how little it took to bring joy and happiness, and most importantly how love of family is what carried them through those hard times. Watch this movie with your children or grandchildren if you would like to share with them the joys of a ""simpler time"" when family meant everything.",1315440000,4,1521,4.56043956043956

I purchased this DVD to show my two small children 10 & 12 years old.  They were not excited about my ""Waltons Christmas Theme"" until they sat and watched it with me, without ever taking a break, totally engaged.

Recently this movie was voted ""Most Annoying Christmas Movie"" by a local news station in the town where I live. Really? How? When you compare movies like this to pathetic projects like ""Bad Santa"" which was nothing more than a filthy ode to holidays that catered to bottom feeders in Hollywood, how does one justify trashing ""The Homecoming?""

376665,5,6301805429,"Although I can remember seeing trailers on the CBS network before the December 19, 1971 air date, I didn't see ""The Homecoming: A Christmas Story"" until the following year after the spinoff television series ""The Waltons"" began it's lengthy run.  This made for television movie clicked with me, since I was already familiar with the characters from watching ""The Waltons"", and it is in my pantheon of favorite Christmas movies that I watch at least once during the holiday season.

 It's Christmas Eve 1933, on Walton's Mountain, in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia, a snowstorm is raging, and the entire Walton family is impatiently awaiting the return of its head, John Walton (Andrew Duggan).  With America still in the grip of the Great Depression, John like many others is forced to seek work away from his home.  He is travelling a considerable distance to spend Christmas with his family, which comprises his wife, seven children and his parents.  John is running very late in returning and his wife Olivia (Patricia Neal) is becoming worried.  On the radio, she overhears a possible reason for his delay; a bus that he might have been on has crashed, with several passengers taken to the hospital.  With no telephone in the house, all her in-laws and she can do is pray and wait, hoping for the best, trying to keep the news from the children.  As night closes in, an increasingly anxious Olivia hears a radio update that there has been at least one fatality from the accident, which decides her, she can no longer be passive, and she must act.  Summoning her oldest child, fifteen-year-old John-Boy (Richard Thomas), she tells him about the situation and then sends him out into the snow to try to see if he can locate his father in the borrowed car of a family friend Charlie Sneed (William Windom).

The pivotal performances around which the story revolves are those of Patricia Neal as Olivia Walton and Richard Thomas as John-Boy Walton, they both are the heart and soul of the film.  Though not Ms. Neal's first USA film appearance after recovering from a series of near fatal strokes in 1965, I believe it was her network television comeback.  She was perfectly suited to the role of a rural Southern woman being born in Kentucky and raised in Tennessee.  One factor that motivated her to accept the role of Olivia Walton was that ""Olivia"" was the name of her oldest daughter who had died tragically of complications from measles in 1962 when she was only seven years old.  Ms. Neal wanted her performance to be her own tribute to her child and it was.  Her Olivia is a strong earth mother holding the family together in her husband's absence.  Though careworn and ravaged, her face has it's own kind of beauty, she may seem stern and implacable at times, but the loving nature is always there close to the surface.  The husky voice with its soft Southern cadences is richly expressive, all in all a lovely portrait, her daughter would have been proud.

Most likely John-Boy Walton is the role for which Richard Thomas will be remembered, due to the popularity of the long running television series ""The Waltons"".  Aged nineteen when he filmed this, Thomas has an awkward grace reminiscent of the very young Jimmy Stewart.  He effortlessly captures the essence of this sensitive fifteen-year-old adolescent struggling to become a man his father will admire, while retaining his own individuality and dreams.

The supporting cast is wonderful, starting with the six young actors who play John-Boy's siblings; they have a rustic look to them, and aren't cloying in the manner of some child actors.  All would be retained for the television series, and America got to see them grow up.  Ellen Corby played the crotchety old biddy Grandma Walton in both as well, but she was never one of my favorite characters.  As Grandpa Walton, Edgar Bergen was an improvement over Will Geer who played the role in the series, Bergen gave the character a dignity and gravity Geer lacked.  Better casting also was Dorothy Stickney and Josephine Hutchinson as the genteel bootlegging Baldwin sisters, they brought novel little quirks to the characters, making them much more amusing and interesting than the two actresses who played the same roles in the series.  The final cast members I want to applaud are Cleavon Little as the pragmatic, larger than life preacher Hawthorne Dooley who loves God but realizes a man has to feed his family as well, William Windom as the good-natured Robin Hood, Charlie Sneed, and last but not least Andrew Duggan as the rugged, hearty John Walton.

As many probably know Earl Hamner Jr. who wrote the excellent screenplay, and also is the narrator at the teleplay's beginning and end is John-Boy grown up, the Waltons are based on his own family.  One of television's finest directors Fielder Cook and renowned composer Jerry Goldsmith with his evocative score made key contributions to the drama's success. This is beautifully photographed with the outdoor scenes filmed near Jackson's Hole, Wyoming, and evokes the rural atmostphere faithfully, the sets look comfortably worn and lived in, are not prettified with the exception of the elegant home of the Baldwin ladies.

What draws me to this film is the strong feeling of family and just how important it is to life. Despite the hardships of poverty, the Waltons are able to love, respect and support one another even if they sometimes get on each other's nerves.  Also this is a nostalgic reminder of simpler, more innocent era when a family actually sat together to listen to the radio.  In these tough economic times, I think the viewer can get some solace and comfort as the Waltons endure and even thrive as individuals in the midst of the worst depression this country has ever experienced.  Finally, without being preachy or sanctimonious, the true spirit of Christmas shines through, this is a holiday treasure to savor.",1291161600,4,5918,4.86839481555334

376704,4,6301805429,"I was ordering some DVDs as Christmas gifts and decided to get 2 of THE HOMECOMING...one for them and one for us. It's a wonderful, heart-warming story (which went on to become a long-running TV series) of a family who worked hard to survive during a dark, difficult time in this country's history. Even though it's set 60+ years ago, the message is timeless.  My husband and I often quote our favorite line from this movie. Patricia Neal says to her children (while having waited all day for her husband to show up in a blizzard): ""The only thing I want to see right now is your daddy, walking through that door.""  I think this should be run every Christmas, right along with Charlie Brown, The Grinch and Rudolph.",1262995200,,715,4.534883720930233

376708,5,6301805429,"I love watching ""The Homecoming"" and watch it faithfully each Christmas on dvd.  I think that the storyline set against the backdrop of the Great Depression, has much to offer each of us in this day and age... for as much as things appear to change, things really stay the same: worry over loved ones missing; lack of money; squabbles between siblings; self-reliance; but MOST importantly the message that LOVE and hard work combined will get us through anything.  I watched a grown up, but still charming, Richard Thomas in the move ""Taking Woodstock"" last weekend, so it was fun to see him so young here.  Patricia Neal makes for a strong-willed, yet emotional mother, and provides a nice counterweight to Thomas' sensitivity.  It really is a delightful movie which one should share with one's family.",1261958400,,803,4.882352941176471
376709,5,6301805429,"Several reviewers here are big fans of The Walton's TV series, and have knocked Patricia Neal in the role that Michael Learned made famous, Olivia Walton.  They say she's too harsh in the role.

If you can separate the film from the series (which came later) you can see what an amazing performance she gave.  In Patricia Neal's hands Olivia is a different character -- a strong, care-worn woman, battered by the times and poverty, but tough enough to endure all that life given her.  She is the heart and soul of this film, and captures the era and the earthiness of this character far more realistically than in the later series.

Don't get me wrong -- Michael Learned was lovely and warm in her role and I love the show, but this wonderful little film is something different.  It's rougher, grittier and much more true-to-life than what was to follow.  This is a real family that has seen hard times and made it through on the strength of love.

And Patricia Neal is the glue that holds it all together.",1261180800,6,1006,4.519337016574585

376712,5,6301805429,I first saw this movie when it premiered on CBS in 1971.  I was 7 years old then and it instantly became and has remained my favorite Christmas movie.  I wanted to be a Walton so badly!  Our family never missed it when they replayed it each year.  It was something we looked forward to all year long (because this was of course way back in the day before videos and dvd's).  It's been a Christmas Eve tradition in our home since it first came out on vhs.  I love this movie because it reminds me of a simpler time in this country when family values weren't just something politicians lauded in order to get votes but rather a deep and meaningful part of our culture.  This was who we were when times were hard but people were still good.  It's a time that sadly we will never see again in this country... except the Depression part perhaps.  It's a wonderful visit to a simpler time and the story will touch your heart.,1260748800,,919,4.265895953757226
376733,5,6301805429,"This is my favorite Christmas film I suppose in part because it is not played to death on television like 'It's a Wonderful Life', 'A Christmas Carol' and 'Christmas Story' are; I like to watch this every year.

Set in the depression, the film really provides a huge contrast between those deprived years and our overindulged lives now.  Not having a lot, or everything you want, makes you appreciate what is really important in life, that is, family, friends, and relatives, good food and good conversation.

The film paints an excellent picture of the fear that accompanies a missing family member, who is supposed to be home by now, but isn't, and with the weather so frightful, one can just imagine all of the serious trouble that they might be in.  Finally, the wait is so long, you send out the oldest boy to see if he can find his father.

Patricia Neal, especially, is the center force of this movie.  She always seems to play a serious, determined woman with perhaps even an edge to her.  Richard Thomas plays John-Boy, as he did in the years following on the television drama ""The Waltons"".  He is also very good, as the other principle character.  His interaction with friends and relatives are very well done, including the very funny engagement with the Baldwin sisters and their potent libation is not to be missed.

Highly recommended.  The acting is excellent, the setting is seemingly very accurate, and the longing for that special Christmas present, together with the tension of the story, makes this very enjoyable fare indeed.",1259625600,2,1547,4.8

As bad as it was, I still had to ""watch"" it, if only to hear most of it !! As it's been said over again, I searched for it every year on TV, but never found it being shown, even at Christmas-time. As all the lovers of this movie, I can remember EVERY scene with detail & loving kinship. As poor as this family was, there was always a coziness and bonding throughout the entire household that I always longed for in my own. This movie is and will always endure as a True Classic !! I also watch it several times a year, especially if I need to be reminded of what true hardships are, and how we can rise above it. I would not have thought of it if Amazon hadn't recommended it.( Thank you Amazon ! ) I hope other parents will share this with their families !! A must see ! But it is a mistake to watch this with the "" series "" in mind. Although this film starts the series, it stands apart.

376769,5,6301805429,"For years my wife and I have promised each other that we would find the ""original Walton's movie"" for Christmas. This year we finally did locate the DVD on Amazon and curled up with the children on the couch. The Homecoming: A Christmas Story is a memory worth reliving--a beloved TV classic from my childhood.

The Waltons was more than a tv show to most of us who were glued to the tv nightly during the 1970's. The Waltons were part of the fabric of the decade itself. To this day, I'll bet families still call out ""goodnight John Boy"" occasionally, spoofing the corny close to each Walton's episode.

Before the expansive Walton clan became household names there was The Homecoming: A Christmas Story. December 19, 1971 to be exact. That night Patricia Neal as Olivia Walton was  at the helm of a tense, yet tender hour. Taking us to Christmas Eve in 1933, Neal and the Walton Children (most of whom made it to the weekly series cast) spent the afternoon and evening hours waiting and worrying that their Daddy might not come home. John Boy Walton (Richard Thomas) is sent out looking for his father. He takes us to a traditional African-American church service being conducted by Pastor Hawthorne Dooley (Cleavon Little), the home of the Baldwin sisters (the sweet old moonshiners) and over the river and through the woods in a one-horse open sleigh.

The most memorable scenes of the film for me are that of a missionary giving away toys to any child who can recite a passage from the Bible. Mary Ellen feeds lines to the children. Mary Ellen's sister Elizabeth asks for a passage and is given, ""Jesus wept."" Upon hearing this once again, I realized that the depth of the Christmas season has shallowed since.

Another is the tearful climax, when Olivia Walton (Neal) exclaims, ""Flowers! Flowers in the dead of winter!"" reflecting the true nature of Christmas.

Lo, how a Rose e'er blooming
From tender stem hath sprung!
Of Jese's lineage coming,
As men of old have sung.
It came a flow'ret bright,
Amid the cold of winter,
When half spent was the night.

Patricia Neal won the Best Actress Golden Globe for The Homecoming: A Christmas Story, and was nominated for an Emmy. Edgar Bergen was delightful as Zeb Walton (Grandpa) and in the film is drawn to the radio to hear President Roosevelt and Fibber McGee and Molly (which didn't premier until 1935-two years later than the year in which the film is set!). Ironically, Bergen was a pillar of the radio era with his ""Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy Show"" debuting in 1937.

Like a visit to the house I grew up in, or my old elementary school, a hauntingly familiar feel accompanies the watching of this classic TV special. Meanwhile a few new tidbits are noticed and enjoyed, making The Homecoming: A Christmas Story an absolute must-see for those who were lucky enough to grow up along with the family that lived on Walton's Mountain.

The children today do not have the family oriented shows that we were raised with.  I also bought this movie for my sister who lives in NJ.  We watched it at the same time (in different states) then called and reminised about our holidays growing up.  All in all a great holiday movie!!!!",1231200000,2,449,4.2976190476190474

376772,5,6301805429,"I grew up watching the Waltons as a kid, and have been watching this film either on VHS or DVD for many years now.  It's become a tradition with our family to pop the DVD in multiple times at Christmas.  Even my 6-year old daughter has started memorizing some of the lines.  There are so many moments in this film that stand out, with fantastic character actors in every role, including Edgar Bergen (Grandpa Walton), Ellen Corby (Grandma Walton) and Cleavon Little (Hawthorne Dooley).  Some of the lines are classic...I especially love the one from the (apparently well-off) Charlottesville missionary that brings toys to the children in exchange for a bible verse recitation.  According to her reasoning, why go preaching to heathen overseas ""when the Blue Ridge Mountains are full of them.""  I find that particularly amusing considering I have relatives that lived in the Blue Ridge.

The film gives you a wonderful perspective on what it was like to live in a big family in the Shenandoah during the Depression.  People today that talk about this country going into a Depression have no idea what a real Depression is like.  Mom spending her last dollar buying some sugar to make a Christmas cake, or knitting a scarf for each of your kids and telling your eldest ""that's all the Santa Claus there was going to be this year"" would certainly open the eyes of our video-game obsessed children of today.  The movie re-enforces what is truly important in life...family, friends and high moral values...also the theme of living off of cash, not credit -- what a concept in today's world.

John Boy's Christmas Eve adventure searching for his snowstorm-stranded father is some of the most fun 30 minutes in film.  From Ike's store where poor ol' Charlie Sneed has finally had his Robin Hood escapades terminated by the Sheriff, to Hawthorne Dooley's church where the kids put on a classic Christmas Eve Nativity performance, to the Baldwin ladies' house where John Boy and Hawthorne participate in a bit of ""recipe"" sampling in order to finagle some gasoline from the ladies, and eventually end up on a jingle bell ride in a one-horse open sleigh out in the snow...it's classic stuff.

I dare you to not feel some kind of emotion at the end of this film...something you will not get from most modern Christmas productions.  It's sad that films like this are not made any more...hopefully the day will return when they are.  For now, thank goodness for DVD so we can relive high-quality family shows like this any time we want.  Some day the networks and studios (including Disney) will realize that there is still a large untapped market for live-action productions such as this that celebrate families and good story-telling.

376783,4,6301805429,"THE HOMECOMING was probably the first Christmas movie, apart from A Charlie Brown Christmas, that I can recall watching as a child.  For nostalgia alone, I love this movie, but watching it as an adult, I am always struck by the depth of Patricia Neal's performance as Olivia Walton, and Richard Thomas as John Boy.  Also, I always loved Cleavon Little as Rev. Hawthorne Dooley (he died far too young).

The only thing that ever bothered me about the movie is the hairstyles --the younger boys' are a little too 1970's.  Aside from that, I think the producers really caught something of the Depression era.

This is a classic Christmas story, and a classic television presentation -- the kind of television that should be made, but just isn't anymore.  Just compare THE HOMECOMING with something of recent Christmas vintage, like, Drake & Josh's Christmas movie on Nickelodeon, and you will see how far standards have fallen.  If producers would only concentrate on quality productions instead of fads and giving airtime to teenybopper stars, we wouldn't all have to rely on DVDs so much!",1230681600,2,1087,4.907103825136612

Although he promised to return from his work in time for the festivities, it's now Christmas Eve and there's no sign of him.

Patricia Neal plays the hard-luck, tough mama Olivia (later replaced in the tv series by gentler Michael Learned), trying to hold together a homefront of seven children and her in-laws singlehandedly. Eldest son John-Boy (Richard Thomas) privately yearns to become a writer -- a dream he guards within his soul, lest it be mocked or discouraged as impractical by his poverty-stricken, trade-embracing parents.

The mother had a smoker's voice which was rather comical considering the wholesome family values she was supposed to stand for. She looked to be simply a Holywood actor without an ounce of motherliness to her. Her husband fitted about as ill in his role.

It is fun to watch after having seen the series...to see the many changes that occurred between the original movie and the series. It's especially fun to see the Walton kids grow up! Michael Learned started out as being a so-so replacement for Patricia Neal, who played the rough-edged but tough-loving mother in the movie. Patricia Neal was perfect for the part right from the start. It would take Michael Learned awhile to make it her own, which she achieved before very many episodes had passed, so my hat's off to her for doing a stupendous job in the series. Edgar Bergen was a sweet little ol' man who didn't make a very strong imprint on the movie. His replacement for the series--Will Geer--started out small but grew in the part as Grandpa in leaps and bounds. He and John Boy (Richard Thomas) would work extremely well as a team--each with a sparkle of life in his eye. Grandma was Grandma (Ellen Corby) in both the movie and series, God bless her! The father in the movie had a tiny but poignant and sensitive role. The series father (Ralph Waite) expanded on the sensitive aspect while adding a powerful dynamic to the series. And the kids acted like kids all the way through, jumping directly from the movie to the TV screen without batting an eye.

I have a particular soft spot for The Homecoming because my parents are from Appalachia, albeit the Alleghany Ridge (not the Blue Ridge, which is where this little drama takes place). Having spent every summer of my childhood in Pennsylvania near the West Virginia line, the nostalgia of The Homecoming is delicious--I invariably laugh, cry, and allow myself to float along on a cloud for an hour-and-a-half. It's hard to believe that so much can be contained in  a mere 98 minutes--the result of the excellence of Earl Hamner's craft, based on his writing what he knows. He means us to know it too, and he succeeds in spades.
The image looks fine--a bit soft, but this was shot for TV, after all. ALL performances are stellar--you'll meet wonderful, colorful characters--people you'd like to know in real life.

376948,5,6301805429,"This superb film premiered in December of 1971 and no other television movie  has surpassed it since. (Most theatrical films haven't, either.) The story of the Walton family's vigil for father John Walton, on his way home from work on an icy night with treacherous roads, has been detailed here, so no need to go further.

The acting from every cast member is superb, although Edgar Bergen's Grandpa pales beside Will Geer's full-bodied portrayal of the role in the subsequent series. Patricia Neal presents us with a very different Olivia than the one in the series: a woman who has had to accept the burden of raising seven children in difficult economic times while her husband is away providing the money they live on. Richard Thomas shines as the oldest boy who feels he must live up to his father's image of him rather than follow what he wants to do in life. The kids act like real children, bickering, loving, playing. The supporting cast is also a treat, especially Cleavon Little as the struggling black minister and William Windom as Charley Snead, who just wants to help his neighbors.

THE HOMECOMING has a grittier feeling than the later WALTONS series (especially later episodes); you really feel as if the family is struggling to make ends meet in the film. The set dressings make you feel as if you are actually in a 1930s mountain home. In addition, the cinematography is absolutely beautiful: shots of characters against backgrounds that become true works of art--the children silhoutted against the sky in the opening scenes, for example, or the sleighing scenes, or John-Boy framed by the moisture-dappled back door window. The score by Jerry Goldsmith accompanies the action wonderfully. This is a true Christmas treat.

(Trivia: the Waltons have a time-travelling radio in this film, which takes place in 1933. The Fibber McGee and Molly series didn't start until 1935 and the episode they are listening to was broadcast in 1947. Does it matter to the film? No. It's just an interesting fact!)",1159228800,11,2016,4.903225806451613
376949,4,6301805429,This in itself was a good movie. Once the series came and the TV cast came into place it was obvious what worked. The story itself is a heartfelt tribute to the American spirit and American family as t once was. Maybe America needs another great tragedy that affects us all to get back to that American spirit that once claimed and made this nation so great. This takes us back to a time when American's cared for each other and cared about the surrounding world. Earl Hamner should have been a politician and then maybe those American values would mean something to modern America.,1149206400,4,582,4.552380952380952

The time is Christmas of 1929. The country is in the grips of the great depression. John Walton has had to take work out of town in order to support his family in the Blue Ridge Mountains. He is trying to get home for Christmas and is overdue. There is a blizzard and the radio tells of a bus crash. All are worried as they await the return of the father.

This movie gives a taste of what it was like to live in a simpler time, when people were happier even though they had less. I didn't live then, but I assume it is true. I've been overseas to countries that had lower standards of living, but judging from the profuse smiles, and bright eyes I would say the people in those countries are happier in general than people in this one.",1138665600,3,657,4.140625

376984,4,6301805429,"Though never planned as such, this is the original pilot movie for ""The Waltons"" TV series. As with most pilots, most things are much the same, but some things are very, very different.

In a nutshell - the kids are all the same as the subsequent TV series. Mom and Dad and Grandfather are all different; Grandmother is the same. The house is on a snow-covered plain, rather than in a forest as in the TV show.

The mother, Olivia Walton, is the biggest shock to the system here. Patricia Neal's portrayal is approximately one light-year different to Michael Learned's, which is very strange because after all both Neal and Learned were playing the same real-life character (Earl Hamner's own mother), so how could they have ended up with such a different 'take' on things?

Neal's version of Olivia sounds like she spends most of the time in her kitchen knocking back the sherry that she is supposed to be putting in the trifle, while chain-smoking cigarettes.

In general, the movie benefits from being a little sharper, racier and less cosy than the TV show. The kids are a bit naughtier, especially in a hilarious scene where they persuade each other to offer up very ambiguous biblical phrases to a visiting lady preacher. Judy Norton (as Mary Ellen), in particular, seems to be much more at home in this more believable scenario (""Jesus wept!"" exclaims the character at one point), indicating that she probably found the later TV series strait-jacketed her, acting-wise. I almost spat out my TV dinner when both the kids and mother made repeated use of the word ""p*ss"" (as in ""p*ss ants"" - apparently some sort of insect of which I am not familar!)

376989,5,6301805429,"As you may already know, this was the pilot for The Waltons t.v. series.  Patricia Neal stars as Ma Walton.  She does a fine job of it as well.  Sometimes, it's a shock to see another person in a role you know so well but that's not the case here.  In fact the whole cast did a splendid job.  The Homecoming was so well cast that all of the child actors remained in their roles for the televison program.  The roles of Ma, Pa and Grandpa Walton (played by Edgar Bergen)were recast along with the owner of the general store and the Baldwin sisters.  Grandma Walton (Ellen Corby) continued the in role even after suffering a stoke a few years later.  I give the producers high praise for not casting her aside like an old shoe.

If you think a Christmas t.v. show should be heartwarming, then you can't go wrong here.  Set in the time of the depression, somewhere in the blue ridge mountains, lives a large family trying to make ends meet.  There will be homemade gifts for Christmas but the children don't really mind.  A far cry from kids of today.  Here, people still attend church, look after their neighbors, children mind their manners and don't talk back to elders.  It's the kind of place we older folks wish we could bring back, minus the lack of money of course.

The family is in a bit of a turmoil as they wait for their dad to return home for Christmas.  Time passes but there is no sign of him.  Neal is very convincing as the strong loving wife trying to hide her fear of what's happened to her husband from her children.

This is a great film for the kids to watch along with their parents.  Parents, purchase with confidence.  This film is kid friendly.",1099612800,57,1668,4.353896103896104
377010,5,6301805429,"I saw this movie when it was first on in 1971 and have watched it at Christmas most every year since.  Years ago it was usually on TV around Christmas and I taped it in the early 80's and have been watching this tape in recent years.  This year I purchased the DVD (for only about $11! - I think blank VHS tapes were that much in the early 80's).  The quality is outstanding, even when viewed on my 19-inch computer monitor from a couple of feet away.  You can clearly see every detail (1933 on the car license plate, prices on the wall in Ike's store, even snow flakes melting on someone's face).  Picture quality on most DVDs made from TV shows or TV movies is nowhere near this good.  Believe me, this DVD is a real bargain.",1074038400,92,727,4.194244604316546

I ordered the dvd because I haven't seen it in over 15 years because for some reason no network or cable stations will air it anymore. This is totally sad while stations are airing such ""classics"" as Home Alone 3, A Christmas Story,National Lampoons Thanksgiving Reunion and countless others pieces of crap.",1069891200,5,464,4.886075949367089
377013,5,6301805429,"Nothing fails to get me in the Christmas spirit more than ""The Homecoming."" As other reviewers have indicated, this was a pilot for ""The Waltons"" and Patricia Neal is absolutely marvelous as Olivia...I just never felt Michael Learned could replace her. In fact, I am really not a fan of ""The Waltons"" TV series, but this is truly beautiful. I love the backdrop of the Virginia mountains in winter, the characters are lovable as well, and I love the story line.  But my absolute favorite aspect of the movie is Patricia Neal as Olivia...she does a great job and is totally believable as a depression era mother from the Appalachians who is trying to keep up the Christmas spirit  in her family, although she has some heavy burdens to bear. Neal's portrayal of Olivia somewhat ""harder,"" some might say, than Michael Learned's version...but this is really why it adds that extra bit of realism (I always though Michael Learned was a bit too sugary and had the ""wrong"" kind of southern accent for this role.)  In any case,  I *highly* recommend this to put you in that Christmas mood. Truly heartwarming.",1068681600,18,1100,4.7434554973821985

All I would add would be to mention Jerry Goldsmith's excellent score, and to say that this is quite simply one of the finest Christmas movies ever made. It should be on everyone's Christmas viewing list.  If you've never seen it, you have missed something very special. I would also point out that Paramount has been notorious for pulling this title from the market with the previous vhs releases, so I wouldn't wait to add this dvd release to your collection.",1060387200,6,525,4.634408602150538
377015,5,6301805429,"Starring Richard Thomas and Patricia Neal, this made-for-TV-movie was written by Earl Hamner and led to the popular series, ""The Waltons."" The stories were based on Hamner's childhood.
(Note: This movie features a somewhat different cast than did the series. While the Walton children are the same, many of the other adult roles in this film, except Grandma Walton played by the late Ellen Corby, were recast for the series.)
A homespun tale, the movie focuses on rural life during the Great Depression and the anxiety a family feels one Christmas when their beloved Father is overdue after being forced to travel to the city to find work and earn money for his family's survival.
Each of the characters reacts to his departure in different ways. Ultimately, the oldest son, John-Boy, portrayed by Richard Thomas, takes important steps to manhood and toward his ultimate career as a writer.
This film has a harsher, more real feel than did the series, and tackles such difficult subjects as racial bigotry and the economic underclass.
The great Patricia Neal is spectacular in her portrayal of the mother. Tougher than the portrayal that came later by the gifted Michael Learned, Neal's Olivia Walton is a genuine force of nature who rarely displays her softer side. Life is very difficult, but love is always present in the Walton home.
If you've never seen this movie, you owe it to yourself to view a more unvarnished, less ""suburban"" rendition of life in this beloved family. A scene in which little Elizabeth, who desperately wants a doll for Christmas, receives one -- with a cracked and broken face -- from a ""charity"" Missionary only after having to ""perform"" scriptures, is so raw that it hurts. ""It's dead,"" the little girl sobs into her brother's comforting arms.
This film is anything but dead. There is real life in every panel that reaffirms true family relationships and the Christmas spirit without being heavy-handed. Look also for a gifted supporting performance by the talented William Windom, who plays a Depression-era Robin Hood.
If ever a TV-movie deserved to be released on DVD, this is it.",1059436800,246,2114,4.957746478873239

377017,5,6301805429,"""The Homecoming -- A Christmas Story"" (full on-screen title) was made in 1971, and was the start of CBS' very successful series, ""The Waltons"".  And what a great way to start!  Patricia Neal gives a powerful performance as Olivia Walton, the head of the very large Walton clan.

This entire cast, in fact, seems ideally suited for his/her role in this program.  The true feeling and spirit of the holiday shines through in every single scene of The Homecoming Christmas special, with the producers re-creating a quite realistic feeling that it is indeed Christmas 1933, during the height of The Great Depression. The writing, acting, and the atmosphere are all first-rate.

This is one of those programs that deserves to be watched every Christmas Eve, just like clockwork. Who could forget the great scene at the end of the movie, when John (Daddy Walton, played by Andrew Duggan) relays his encounter with Santa Claus. Watching him tell the kids of how Santa's sleigh ""...went flying across the sky and landed right on top of this house!!"", to me, is one of the best scenes in TV history. Watching that scene, you'd swear those kids were not actors at all -- but just wide-eyed excited kids hanging on Dad's every word.

I watch this movie at least twice every Christmas and definatly on Christmas Eve even if it means staying up after every one else has went to bed.
