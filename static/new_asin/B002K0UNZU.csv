8371669,3,B002K0UNZU,"When I was watching this DVD,I thought it was going to be more descriptive and shocking. It's a detective-style account of the Leonard Lake/Charles Ng story. And there's not much sleuthing discussed. There's little talk about who was Leonard Lake and real photos of him. The title sounds dramatic,yet there is nothig bone-chilling about this video. The 'Most Evil' documentary,on Lake,is about a third of an hour and more interesting than this video story. On the front DVD title it states,'Most shocking since the Zodiac case.'.And that's another reason why I was interested in the ghastley story. Maybe there was a possible connection to the Zodiac case. The elusive Zodiac killer had written about collecting and torturing his slaves for the afterlife. Lake was raised in San Francisco and lived in Ukiah. Lake being a little older than the  hippies,took full advantage of the liberal atmosphere around him. Lake obtained a 'unicorn' goat that he used to lure his potential victims in. Leonard Lake was obsessed with a book entitled,'The Collector'.The book is about a cunning pysco,who collects fugitive woman,as his concubine slaves. Very little is disclosed about Lake's victims,only five confirmed and perhaps as high as twenty-five victims. The documentary could have delved into the lives of Lake and his sidekick .Charles Ng was just a follower,yet he is still just as culpable. The DVD is more about the pursuit of justice,and not about the story of the criminals. Leonard Lake was a time-bomb,waiting to implode. I think Lake saw his crimes as a game with the authorities. When he was arrested on a weapons charge,while being questioned about shoplifting incident,he ingested two cynide capsules. Thus ending the game,he now had no control over. There's a lot of 'Zodiac' overtunes about the Leonard Lake case,yet this documentary doesn't even go there. Or into the story itself,and simply focuses on the post-drama legal issues of the case.",1255651200,14,1953,5.160883280757098
