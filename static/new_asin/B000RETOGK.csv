8200173,4,B000RETOGK,To be honest I only bought this for three kings. And I need to watch it again cause I fell asleep. So this review is pointless but amazon keeps sending me mail saying to review things. But it was a good buy and I would like to thank the seller.,1368057600,,244,3.9
8200174,2,B000RETOGK,"I had never seen Three Kings before and it was a fair movie.  I bought this primarily for The Perfect Storm.  The movie was exciting, but just as the action was really getting going, the disc stopped working properly.  It played really slowly and the picture became scrambled.  I tried ejecting and reloading the disc and I tried a different DVD player in our house and the same problem occurred, so it was clearly a defect in the disc.  I never got to see the end of the movie... a big disappointment!",1355961600,,502,4.413043478260869
8200175,5,B000RETOGK,This was a great buy. I love the fact they are both on a double feature. Cheers. Thank you very much.,1353715200,,101,3.857142857142857
8200176,1,B000RETOGK,"Ordered a NEW DVD, when it came it was not new (was not wrapped in plastic) and the case was broken.
Contacted the seller, and was told to send it back to them, which I did.
After about two week, I again contacted the seller and asked when I would get my NEW DVD?
They tell me, ""any day, be patient"".  That was over a week ago!  I guess I've been taken advantage
of and they are going to keep my money and laugh all the way to the bank.  :-(
Wish I could give them less than one star.",1283731200,,484,3.82
8200177,5,B000RETOGK,"I should start by saying that this release is indeed a bargain since you get two full-length widescreen movies on one double-sided DVD disc.  In addition, you get tons of extras like special commentaries, behind the scenes featurettes, and more.  I encourage movie studios to release more double features like this.

I'm not one for sad endings, and unfortunately THE PERFECT STORM ends on a downer.  It's an ambitious movie with fine acting and fabulous special effects, but like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mist-Two-Disc-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B0010X73ZG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mist (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a>, the ending leaves you with an uneasy feeling.

Speaking of special effects, the tremendous storm and powerfully destructive water scenes were masterfully done through digital / computer effects, and it is absolutely impossible to distinguish the real water from the digital water.  In short, this is a breathtaking movie (pun not intended).

THREE KINGS is a fast paced, quirky movie that requires several viewings for full appreciation.  Yes, it's violent, but it never goes overboard on the blood; in the hands of a less skilled director, this could have been a much more gruesome movie.  Luckily, the movie strikes a fine balance between humor and the realities of war.

THREE KINGS also has a unqiue visual style which was achieved through using different film stocks and through digital colorization.  Like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/300-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B00005JPLW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;and the the SAW series,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Saw-Trilogy-Saw-Saw-II-Saw-III/dp/B000UO4F8O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Saw Trilogy (Saw/ Saw II/ Saw III)</a>, THREE KINGS is best appreciated on a flat panel / high definition TV that can faithfully reproduce dark, grainy, and over-exposed scenes.

Finally, I was happy to see that many of the Iraqi extras in THREE KINGS  were actual IRAQIS!  One of the bonus features was about the Iraqi men and women that were used in the movie, and this added an edge of authenticity to the viewing experience.

All in all, a 5-star release.  If you're a fan of George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, Ice Cube, and Said Taghmaoui (he interrogates Wahlberg in THREE KINGS and is the terrorist mastermind in VANTAGE POINT,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vantage-Point-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B0018CWW32/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vantage Point (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;), this double feature release is a must have.",1220832000,3,2738,6.692090395480226
8200178,5,B000RETOGK,"Just received this from a Amazon seller for 2.00!!! What a deal!! Anyway, this is in widescreen(2.41)with all the extra features that was included on each individual DVD. Perfect Storm is in Dolby Digital EX & Three Kings is in Dolby 5.1. Great price for two movies. Thank you Warners!!",1199664000,5,286,4.74
