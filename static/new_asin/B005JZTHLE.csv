8476315,2,B005JZTHLE,this makes no sense why they are reissuing this in pieces.  just very disappointing because the show is so great but they're screwing up the dvd releases.,1362268800,4,154,4.703703703703703
8476316,5,B005JZTHLE,"These 2 discs are from the 4 disc season 2 set. I found this out the hard way. It never occured to me that they were just reissuing some of the second season.  Mainly because it makes no mention on the box what season the shows are from. I love the show, but hate how History is issuing the seasons.",1338422400,12,299,3.9833333333333334
