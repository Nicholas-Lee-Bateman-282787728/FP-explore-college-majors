6282090,5,B00IN3PU74,I am very happy with my purchase.  This was an unexpected surprise to find that it was enjoyable to watch.  Although it was a strange series I continued to watch it and wanted to watch more of it.,1375401600,2,196,4.131578947368421
6282091,5,B00IN3PU74,Great sci-fi series even though it was made over 10 years ago.  Very adult themes.  Good art work and graphics.,1358553600,2,111,4.5
6282092,5,B00IN3PU74,"This show should be a drinking game where every time the robot is creepy you drink.
Whenever the captain is creepy or talks about blowing up planets or actually blows up a planet, you drink.
Whenever the dead guy says ""The dead do not __"", you drink. Get it?
The special effects are just the worst.
The acting is awful. The jokes are lame.
A lot of things don't make sense about this series and it's super repetitive.
For some unexplainable reason I've been watching every episode in just one week.
Somebody save me, I can't stop watching Lexx!
I never knew about Lexx when it was on TV.
Randomly I just found the 4 seasons at Target for $15 and decided to check it out.
I would love to see this show come back or become a comic book series.
I would definitely go see Lexx the movie if they made it.
If you like this, watch ""Dark Star"", That one is pretty Awful/Awesome too!",1354838400,23,874,4.271084337349397

They must be some kind of black market version because of the way they packaged with no way of knowing what disc you are starting with. I had to label and store my disc in blank DVD / CD  disc case, I had bought at Wal-Mart for computer burn CDs.

6282122,4,B00IN3PU74,I love the show and now that its unavailable on Hulu I picked up the series on DVD. Number one problem with the DVDs is that they are not numbered. There's no way to telling whats on what disk or what order to play them without popping each disk in a player and trial and error.,1409961600,2,278,3.982142857142857

Much better cause I have a deeper understanding of things (with age does come wisdom ;))
The only problem is the lack of subtitles.

6282129,5,B00IN3PU74,At first I didn't get it. After a few episodes I was hooked. It's basically a really entertaining series that makes fun of sci fi movies. And it's full of really hot German girls on various episodes. It's exiting and funny at the same time and you never know what will happen next.,1406505600,,281,4.320754716981132
6282130,5,B00IN3PU74,Watched this when it aired and loved it then.  The story line is still good and I'm glad to have them in my personal collection.,1404864000,,128,4.12
6282131,4,B00IN3PU74,"My only complaint is that they could have distributed the number of episodes per disc more evenly: some have as many as 8 while others as few as 2. Now compressing 8 episodes on a single disc is going to degrade the video quality and that is exactly what happened: sometimes it looks fine while at other times I feel like I'm watching a pirated video from YouTube (though, thankfully, there is no buffering).

Also, there are no subtitles or special features.

If you love Lexx but lack money, this stripped down version of the series is a godsend, but if you can afford it I recommend you shell out for earlier 2008 release of the series which has better video quality as well as subtitles and special features",1399939200,7,711,4.503875968992248

6282133,4,B00IN3PU74,"I saw the entire 4 seasons both when it first aired and I own the collection. From the Lich assassin which reminds me of Dr. Phibes but he is my favorite character of the show to Stanley which I hated - his constant whine just got under my skin. The robot I didn't care for but fans of Hitchhiker may like him. The sex kitten I liked but found her to be a bit of a bully. I loved the sets, But mostly what I loved was the journeys. I got a kick out of the music. The show is not always pretty and it can be a bit redundant at times. But love it or hate it. I bet you haven't seen anything like it. But Red Dwarf has the same type of humor.",1397433600,5,639,3.740740740740741

6282136,5,B00IN3PU74,"I truly enjoyed this series.  I was unable at the time to see the last two years of the series as I had moved to Europe.
  I'm back and rediscovered it and was thrilled to laugh my way through two additional years of a dead super assassin, a failed security guard/courier, a sex slave with no prospects for having sex with the dead assassin she is in love with, and finally a sex crazed robot head plotting the destruction of anyone standing between it and it's love interest (first the girl later the dead assassin).
This quartet of adventurers bumble through two universes and basically blow up everything around them with the LEXX.  Endless poke in the eye to hard core Si Fi readers... but if you loved Hitchhikers guide you will get a kick watching this.",1394064000,6,759,4.518248175182482
6282137,4,B00IN3PU74,Nice to see the show That I watched on an old television on my high definition screens and uncensored.  Worth the money if you liked Lexx the first time around,1393977600,3,159,4.3
6282138,4,B00IN3PU74,"Lexx, a precursor of Farscape, is a very odd series, sometimes should have been titled Porn in Space, but the first movie was intriguing and there are moments of creativity throughout.  I got very tired of Stan's horndog routine, especially in the second season, and preferred the first version of Zev, but Kai is awesome and 790 (the robot head) is funny.  Season 3 was terrible, though it had an arc and the awesome Nigel Bennett. I am about a fourth of the way through season 4 and it's picking up in quality.  Would not recommend to anyone who is expecting traditional sci fi.",1393372800,2,580,4.5576923076923075
6282139,5,B00IN3PU74,I have always been a big fan of LEXX. I love the series and the cast. It combines SCI-FI with Humor and makes for a very entertaining viewing. The only other series that challenges it in my mind would be Firefly.,1393027200,,212,4.195121951219512
6282140,5,B00IN3PU74,"How the *beep* isn't this more famous?

ATTENTION TO ALL SCI-FI FANS LOOKING FOR AN EPIC SHOW: This is the ONE show where they don't spend 99% of the time inside the ship, talking. On this one, we actually discover a wide-range of new, strange, bizarre and original worlds and locations. OH YES.

It's ten times more entertaining, creative and imaginative than every other sci-fi series out there, except maybe for Farscape which I also bought the complete series and will begin watching when I'm done with Lexx.

Really though, I know some effects aren't good but if you can get past that then this is by far the best sci-fi series you'll get. With every new episode they dare to go even further instead of spending 99% of the episode inside the ship like all sci-fi series do and it's just so original you can't help but be enthralled by it. You've got so many: they go to The Cluster, to Brunnis, to Pattern, then to Mantrid's Ice Planet, MedStat (space hospital), Luvliner (space brothel), TV World, the space jury, 791's industrial planet, Nook, Ruuma and Woz, and that's only until season 2. Then you've got the BEST season which is S3 with the epic saga between the Fire & Water planets, plus all locations on Earth in the 4th season, like the stylish Transylvania episodes and the tropical beach in Xevivor, to name a few.

Lexx has something going for it that's rare and even exciting: it's just so damn imaginative. The plot can be hard to follow, the acting isn't always great, and the direction can seem pallid at times... but the art direction and just basic inventiveness and originality are remarkable. What Lexx does so well that few others shows can do is introduce you to a completely new world, something so fresh and bizarre that you can watch the same episode several times in different moods and have different experiences as a result.

And again, the art direction is ASTOUNDING: there are many scenes in this show, particularly the first and third season, that if frozen as a still and mounted as a poster would be better than the art in most people's homes. Lexx is like nothing you have ever seen before, or will again. It's very, very hard to describe it. You have to see it for yourself. You'll either hate it or, like me, join thousands who still think this is a series way ahead of its time, and the best & most underrated and underseen sci-fi to have ever graced the little screen.",1390867200,3,2412,4.574074074074074

Flat out this is the most imaginative sci-fi out there.  The crew is quirky, the problems are real, and its just wonderful.  Seasons 1 and 2 are magnificent, no other show has come close to the pure creativity and imagination as this one has.  Seasons 3 and 4 aren't as good, 3 is real still, but a different tone and setting.  While 4 was just junk in my opinion expect the finale, the finale is a must watch for anyone that gets in to this show.

Again I can't reiterate how wonderful this show is!  If you are into this genre at all this is a much watch!",1496016000,,711,4.138686131386861

However, all four disks are NOT marked and are stacked in a single case so you will have to play the beginning episode of each one to figure out which one is which and mark them yourself.",1461456000,3,354,4.318181818181818
8643530,3,B00IN3PU74,"I got seasons one and two from the flea market in a trade. I picked the show up simply because it was a tv show and it was two seasons. I basically paid nothing for the two seasons. First off, I thought the pilot episode was pretty good.  I watched all of season one and now I am in season two. This is about the weirdest sci fi/fantasy show I have ever viewed. The show has ridiculous characters, The Brunongi chracters, a dead guy with a bun on the top of his head, Stanley Tweedles the moron, a robot head and Zed the half lizard sex slave who never changes her clothes. In fact, none of the characters ever seem to appear in a different outfit. I love Zed's mini skirt but it would feel better to me if I knew she could wear another outfit. I mean, I've seen the the moron and the sex slave bathing, not together, but they wear the same clothes all time. I realize this is a low budget show, but still this show isn't Gilligan's Island. The show is simply crazy. It has a plot but it is loosely laid out. The show makes just enough sense to where I can watch it. The show has lots of crazy and masterful images, flying dragonfly transports, crazy worm bugs, all kinds of crazy stuff, talking brains. I'd say the talking brains were taken from Star Trek but I'm sure the idea came before that show. Anyway, I am into season two now. I'm glad the episodes are now only about 47 minutes or so. I can only take so much of this show in one sitting. The first season episodes were one hour and a half long. That was way too much time to waste on this show. I'll watch this show for the Zed the sex slave because she is so sexy. All the girls on this show tend to be hot. The show has a lot of infused sexuality. In this way the show is quite adult and not for kids. Yes, it's a SHOWTIME show. I'm not that surprised that I hadn't heard of this show until 2016. I can see how on many levels the show is not a classic, but still for imagination and monsters, flying bugs, a flying dragonfly ship, on this level the show is a real leap into fantastic imagination. Even if this show leaves you  bored or scratching your head it still deserves some of your consideration. The show is pretty original and it's an experience you can't find in most shows. Yeah, the characters are quite retarded. The adventures of these retarded characters are lame brained. It's just something to watch three retarded characters as they risk their lives, not the dead guy though, from episode to episode. These three characters and the robot head can't seem to help but run headlong into what should certainly be their DEMISE but somehow they don't get destroyed. Why does Zed the sex slave love the dead guy? How does Stanley Tweedle remain a moron from episode to episode? He's really the craziest of morons, think Jim Varney as Ernest. Will the dead guy ever have real LIFE? I watch to see where the adventures take these completely ABSURD characters. Must watch TV? Maybe not. But like a car accident, I can't look away. I just have to see the twisted metal, the carnage, the absurd comedy and drama of it all.",1458864000,,3089,4.2786324786324785
