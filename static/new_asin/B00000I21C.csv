7909492,4,B00000I21C,"""Dedicated to husbands who 'hold out' part of their pay envelope on their wives  and live to tell about it.""

One of the duo's lesser-known shorts, ""Their Purple Moment"" (1928) finds Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy in classic form. The Boys' first domestic comedy is beautifully timed and consistently funny. Stan's ingenious use of a family portrait remains among the great L&H moments. Producer Robert Youngson showcased a memorable abridgement in his 1970 silent-film anthology ""4 Clowns."" Nevertheless, it's preferable to watch the original two-reeler with a vintage score.",1367280000,2,574,5.438202247191011
7909493,4,B00000I21C,"This is not one of Laurel & Hardy`s best silent films, but it`s still a very funny comedy.
Stan has been holding out on his wife and stashing away a little of his pay check. Ollie convinces him that they should take the cash
and have a little fun. They run up a big bill at a night club with a couple of semi-wild women only to discover that Stan`s wife
had discovered his little stash of cash and replaced the cash with trading stamps.",1263600000,,436,4.141176470588236

She takes it out and replaces it with a wallet of cigar coupons.  (This is very similar to the scenario in 'Blotto,' only there it was bootleg liquor that was replaced with a bunch of hot sauce, mustard, tea, and other horrible spicy things.)  Ollie and his own wife have just come over, and Mrs. Hardy is ranting about how her husband thought he could get away with holding out $2 on her.  Stan tells his friend he's smarter than his wife and that he's got a lot of money hidden in a secret stash.  They tell their wives they're going bowling and leave with the coupons, without even checking the contents of the wallet.  Unfortunately for them, a local busybody gossip is coming by to chat with their wives, and she also sees them when they go into a local club, The Pink Pup, with two attractive women.  Having nothing better to do than to stick her nose into other peoples' business, she storms back to tell their wives what they're up to.

They seemingly were planning to go bowling, but when they were walking by the club, these two women emerged, along with their dates, who were getting thrown out for stiffing on the bill.  Stan and Ollie offer to take full financial responsibility for them, as well as the running taxi bill they've got, and go in with them, treating them to dinner.  They also end up treating the impatient taxi driver to dinner when he comes storming in demanding they pay the bill right now.  Then the wives come in (the old gossip fell in a deep puddle on their way there) without letting their husbands know they're there.  The boys have just discovered what's really in the wallet, and are trying to put off having to pay the bill.  However, it is discovered that they have cigar coupons instead of cash, and they begin running through the club, eventually winding up in the kitchen, where a big food fight breaks out between Stan, Ollie, their wives, a cook, a waiter, the cab driver, and the matre d.'

As in many L&H comedies, the wives here are bullying vindictive henpeckers who want total control and don't want to let their husbands have any fun or to do anything they don't approve of.  This might explain why some women don't like this type of comedy, but these are just stereotypes, and are exaggerated for comedic effect and the interest of the story.  It wouldn't be funny or suspenseful if these women were loving doting wives who let their husbands keep their rightful money and didn't have a problem with them having fun away from home without having to be at their beck and call constantly.  Where would the story be in that?  The wives here are particularly brutal and mean.  I'd describe this as one of their lesser silents; it's more plot- than gag-driven, and the story just ends kind of suddenly, giving an unfinished feel.",1139011200,2,3053,4.488245931283906
7909495,3,B00000I21C,"This is among the best of the recent restorations of Laurel & Hardy's silent comedies. The 1928 film has a new synchronized soundtrack, edited from various vintage-1929 musical scores. The music is as funny as the  comedy, as henpecked husbands Laurel & Hardy sneak off for a disastrous  ""night out."" The picture quality is very clear and sharp.",944438400,9,345,4.931034482758621
