2420913,5,B000BKDNTE,"as a muscle car fan you must buy this DVD box. extreme good picture and sound quality. sadly the phrase ""what a blast"" starts to bore because dennis says this to nearly every car or show he presents. i prefer the reminder ""don't crush 'em - restore them."".",1185062400,5,256,4.354166666666667

8087712,4,B000BKDNTE,"A decent set of Muscle Car DVD's for the money. Sound and video quality is OK.

I know this DVD set is titled ""Legendary"" Muscle Cars but here are some cars that could have been added or covered better:

AMX, Javelin, Falcon, Galaxie, Gran Torino, Thunderbird, Thunderbolt, Comet, Cyclone, Barracuda, Charger, Demon, Duster, GTX, Super Bee, Catalina.

Good coverage on Buick and Chevrolet cars. I would like to see better coverage of the late 50's and early 60's muscle cars and their impact on drag racing. The Jay Leno segment was excellent. My wife really loved the steam powered cars.",1310256000,,588,4.86
8087713,5,B000BKDNTE,This is without a doubt the best collection of classic and vintage cars to be seen. I enjoy cars but am no means a petrol head yet this had me riveted. It's clever in that maybe 6-10 minutes is spent per car so it moves at just the right pace. The special features are deep long and plentiful if you crave more than a catalogue browse through automotive history. If you even moderatley interested in cars get this and you won't regret it.,1302566400,2,438,4.289156626506024
8087714,5,B000BKDNTE,"Super fun look at the cars of the ""Golden Age"" of American automobiles.  Some of these cars make you drool and some make you wish you could drive them.  This set is worth every penny it costs.  Buy it and wear a smile for weeks.",1289001600,2,228,4.022222222222222
