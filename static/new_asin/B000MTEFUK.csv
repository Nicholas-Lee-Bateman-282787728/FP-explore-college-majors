Each episode tells the tale of another day in the ER, from the exciting to the mundane, and the joyous to the heart-rending. Frenetic pacing, interwoven plot lines, and emotional rollercoastering is used to attempt to accurately depict the stressful environment found there.

2747099,5,B000MTEFUK,"I have loved ER ever since the pilot and I love every season but season 7 was a turning point in all the major characters lives.  Green was starting the last and best year of his life (with Corday), Carter wss coming to grips with the past and who he is and wants to be. Benton saw his days at county dwindling in the past and a brighter future looming with his son and Cleo.  Weaver came out of two closets one that was obvious and the other that she can be a champion for her patients. Also Romano proved why no one cried him a river with what happened to him in season 8 (some may have even cheered).  Not me though it was too much like seeing a small animal in a trap.

I agree with the other reviewer that Sally Field definately stole the screen when she was on it.  An awesome actress she is.  She was to season 7 what Alan Alda was to season 6.  Although Sally blew Al away despite his great performance.

The best episode was the finale, Rampage, Mark Green went where we thought he'd never go.  No spoilers you'll have to watch it to see what happens.",1430179200,,1060,4.106796116504855

2747128,5,B000MTEFUK,"I gave Season 7 this rating because Sally Field was excellent as Abby's mother, a person with bipolar disorder. I don't think Maggie would have had to be portrayed as having a suicide attempt in order to be believable as a bipolar person, but the character was excellent anyway. I would recommend this season to anyone who knows a bipolar person or has a bipolar person as a relative. Not all bipolar people resemble Maggie in their behavior, however.",1389657600,,451,4.7215189873417724
2747129,5,B000MTEFUK,"Julianna Margulies left the show last season in the best possible way, especially considering her opening appearance as a failed suicide. Season seven begins what seems like a long slow painful arc where several of the opening leads either leave or enter into life-diminishing situations. That all raises the level of drama, but it also reveals that our heroes are not free of failings and not free of some of the very dangers to which they seek to cure.

One of the highlights of this season is the continuing story of Abby Lockhart, played by Maura Tierney, who is the glue which holds the second half of ER's 15 seasons together. As first season headliners Greene and Carter (Edwards and Wylie) encounter serious problems, characters who started after season 1 become more central. I'm especially fond of Dr. Weaver, (Laura Innes) who continues to advance in her career, and continually butts head with Dr. Romano (one of TV's favorite characters you love to hate.)

The series finally takes on an ER doctor who is not a knight in shining armor. Erik Palladino plays Dr. Malucci who is slipshod, Oddly enough, it always seems like the doctors with sterling technique who encounter all the malpractice charges.

Sally Field appears in this season, in the role which won her an Emmy for guest appearance in a drama. Her performances are terrific, but maybe even too good, as it is very easy to identify with her very familiar face in a gut wrenching situation. I was happy when her episodes were over.

A recurrence of Greene's cancer is another downer, but this is balanced by a few episodes which are done for laughs, such as a comedy of errors in Greene's trying to reach the church to be married to Cordray.

This is almost as good as season 6. Any weaknesses seem largely to be premonitions of what will happen with original cast members in season 8. A strong season.",1387324800,5,1873,4.715596330275229

2747160,4,B000MTEFUK,"Season 7 certainly doesn't let up on the drama. Sometimes it feels like it's almost too much, but you'll find yourself eager to see each new episode to find out what happens next. Really there's never been a Medical Drama like ER, and this season still has the majority of the original cast. It's well worth the price, and a great follow up to Season 6.

Abby and Carter support each other in seeking recovery, and Sally Fields dazzles in her Emmy award-winning role as Abby's mom in ""The Visit"".  Greene and Cordray's relationship is satisfying, too.

2747172,4,B000MTEFUK,"I won't counter any review of season 7. All are correct and well worth the whole set.

I'm really drawn to just one episode ""Sand and Water"". It is the most emotional episode for me because of the 4 storylines that are typically running at once. I found it to be the very perfect episode to show a person who doesn't watch ER to experience some of the best writing.

I am gay, I want children, I'm spiritual and I have been surprised before by someone I loved. All of these aspects are probably why I am so touched with this episode. This episode has a lesbian couple going through the legal hassles of health law, another couple is losing their child and want to have him babtised before he dies with the problem being that a priest can't be found for them,  one of the regular characters is having a difficult time proposing. Yeah, it touched me a lot and the music 'Sand & water' just hits home. NOT ONE DRY EYE AT MY HOUSE when I show that episode.

OK..that's my peace..thanks for reading and I hope that ""Sand & Water"" is well worn on your player because of just how well it stands alone.

For me, it's worth the price of the whole set.",1204243200,5,1142,4.244239631336406
2747173,5,B000MTEFUK,"I just finished season 7 of ER and wow was it ever good. I sometimes wonder how they can write great episode after episode but boy can they write them. I wrote a review for season 6 saying that it was the best so far but im rethinking that now and i am going to put 6 and 7 at the top spot. Some favorite episodes for me were: Benton Backwards, Flight of Fancy, Rescue Me, The Crossing, Sailing Away, Where the Heart is and the finale Rampage, which is in my view one of the best episodes of the series with the ending leaving you in absolute shock. A great place to cut it off leaving you wanting even more from season 8.
I could not be happier with season 7, which affirms for me that this is the best show on TV in the 90's and my favorite show EVER.

2747177,5,B000MTEFUK,"With so many seasons of ER and so many great moments as a part of tv history. It's hard to pick the one season to win the title of 'best'. The seventh season of ER wins my title as the best season of ER to date. (Season 12 will replace it when the year arrives.) The reason to give the title to year seven is for the fact that this season has the rare ability, that is hard especially with television, of pulling you in in such a way that you feel as if you have been part of a dramatic experience. Season seven shines even brighter on DVD. Packaged perfectly in a dark gray box set. Season seven may have been more of a 'soapy' season but the story-lines, directing and as always the acting is beyond compelling. Best episodes of the season and possibly one of the best ever 'A Walk in the Woods'.",1197331200,6,798,4.121794871794871

2747189,5,B000MTEFUK,"Season seven of NBC's long-running medical drama ER was an impressive collection of episodes that featured the introduction of one of the best guest star performances in the history of the show.

While she is not a regular cast member, Sally Field stole the show in season seven, guest starring as Maggie, nurse Abby Lockhart's (Maura Tierney) bipolar mother. Field earned an Emmy for her incredible turn as Maggie, a woman desparately trying to reconnect with her daughter and turn her life around, all the while dealing with a disease that can turn her into a totally different person. Most of Abby's story lines in this season revolved around her mother, and through that, viewers got a chance to learn just where Abby came from and how tough things were for her as a youngster. Abby is the only character in this season that is returning for the 14th season as a regular cast member, so it is nice to see just where the character got her start.

Abby began the year as a med student, but her ex-husband's failure to pay a bill puts her back in nurse scrubs for the season, however, as the year draws to a close she is thinking about heading back to med school again. Viewers also get a chance to see Abby's budding relationship with Dr. Luka Kovac (Goran Visnjic), a relationship that has resulted in them having a baby and getting married in season 13. In this season, the relationship is still in its new stage and viewers got a chance to see just what Luka went through in Croatia, losing his wife and children in a bombing. It is through his relationship with a dying bishop (guest star James Cromwell) that Luka finally learns to deal with his past and move on with his life.

At the end of season six, Dr. John Carter (Noah Wyle) was heading to rehab after becoming addicted to pain pills. Season seven finds him out of rehab and looking for his job back. With conditions, he is accepted back to County General and for the most part, is able to blend back in with his fellow doctors. A close call with some pain medication sends him back to square one in his return to work, however. His close friendship with Abby, herself a recovering alcoholic, helps him through the tough times and we get to see the great side of Dr. Carter when he travels with Abby to bring a messed up Maggie back from a hotel room where she was holed up in Oklahoma.

Dr. Peter Benton (Eriq LaSalle) continues his relationship with pediatrician Cleo Finch (Michael Michele) and also has to deal with the fact that he loses his job in the surgery department after a tiff with Dr. Robert Romano (Paul McCrane). Forced to accept a position with no benefits and no stature, Benton is incredibly disappointed, but stays in Chicago to be near his son Reese, who splits time with he and his ex, Carla (guest star Lisa Nicole Carson). Eventually, Benton is hired as the director of diversity at the hospital in what would be he and Cleo's final full season at County General. Both doctors departed near the end of season eight.

Jing-Mei Chen (Ming Na) opens the season finding out that she is pregnant. She hides her pregnancy well for a while, keeping her parents in the dark until it is almost time to deliver. She agrees to give the baby up for adoption after realizing that the time was not right for her and the fact that her parents couldn't handle the fact that the baby's father was black. The pregnancy was Chen's main story line, though she does apply for chief resident at the end of the season, a position Carter also wants, but can't have because of the conditions placed on him after his rehab stint.

Dr. Dave Mallucci (Erik Palladino) has very few large story lines in the season, serving mainly as a character in other people's story lines. It is obvious in this season that the writers were dealing with a lot of main characters, which gave them almost too many stories to tell in each episode and Dr. Dave was one of the people that seemed to fall by the wayside.

Dr. Kerry Weaver (Laura Innes), the head of the ER, confronts her own sexuality, as she enters a relationship with Dr. Kim Legaspi (guest star Elizabeth Mitchell, Juliet from Lost). She hides their relationship well, but when Dr. Legaspi's career is on the line, Weaver steps up and comes out of the closet to her boss, Dr. Romano. This story line was one of the big stories during the season, one that opened Dr. Weaver up to many relationships, including the one that led to her departure from the show in the middle of the 13th season.

But, the biggest story of the year was that of Dr. Mark Greene (Anthony Edwards). The longtime ER doc finds out that he has a tumor in his brain the same day he finds out that his girlfriend Dr. Elizabeth Corday (Alex Kingston) is pregnant. The two set out on a course to find a way to treat the tumor and the removal is successful, but Greene has a hard time returning to work, still dealing with the effects of the surgery and the tumor. The two doctors get married (after a slight delay) and welcome Ella to the world and in the final episode, Greene fears for the life of his wife and baby when a distraught father goes on a killing spree after Greene places his son in a foster home. This tumor marked the beginning of the end for Dr. Greene, as its return in season eight eventually led to the good doctor's death in the penultimate episode, one of the toughest moments in ER  history.

This set features a number of deleted scenes and a great gag reel that shows just how much things can get screwed up on the set of a tense show like ER.

While there could've been more extras, this has been the norm the last few seasons and the episodes themselves make for great television, with or without the extras. If for no other reason, by this set to watch ""The Visit,"" the episode that introduces viewers to Sally Field's Maggie, truly one of the best episodes of the show's 14-year run.",1186617600,43,5891,4.460538532961931

They the third explosion in or adjacent to the ER, yet another original character leaves, and the fifth unplanned pregnancy of a nurse or doctor is a major plot point. Seriously?
