8450449,3,B004ZUKHWC,"You will need an all regions dvd player to see this documentary. Fortunately my DVD player played it but in black and white which defeated the whole purpose of seeing the beautiful Caribbean. The DVD took a long time to receive, but it was coming from across the other side of the world. Otherwise it is was enjoyable to watch. If you like nature and to see the natural parts to the Caribbean then this is a good DVD to get. I really enjoyed the scenes of Dominica and St. Lucia.",1389052800,3,479,4.274725274725275
