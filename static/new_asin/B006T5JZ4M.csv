Even if you are familiar with some of the material included you will mostly likely learn some things you didn't know. If you are not familiar with any of the contents it will be difficult to swallow at first.  It will be a ""rude awakening"" for you. What's included here is true and factual and documented. I highly recommend it

Therefore only with an higher power can these times come to an end.  When one arrives at this conclusion, then you have to take a look at the Bible and its stunning accuracy.  Not to dred the time ahead but to rejoice in knowing evil will not prevail.

5015816,3,B006T5JZ4M,"While I found this program an intriguing and a worthwhile watch for anyone interesting in the topic...I also found the overt to subtle inferences to run to your nearest pulpit, commune, or church to convert to Christianity heavily laid on. Be sure to be in time for the passing of the collection plate, Amen brother. To the point of flatly stating that finding Jesus is a magical cure to everything that threatens humanity, not exactly a new theological ideology there. The underlying premise being intelligence equates to a lack of purity and innocence, free thought and creativity are for God exclusively, as the creator, not for us peons, and technology is bad (all you need is a bible, sticks and rocks optional at best). The de-evolutionist idea that these things are in fact holding back the the human race and/or fueling the NWO agenda is misguided, flawed, and extremist propaganda heaped upon propaganda. Satan is bad, so is abortion, and genetic experimentation is a no-no, throw in nuclear energy (possibly the path to clean unlimited energy as unfortunately vilified by a couple events in our recent past) as all bad...ok. Shall we all roll over under a tree without a serpent, a candle for light and heat, and die while reciting scripture, rushing headlong towards death with assured stairways to the afterlife? Dismiss the age of reason and all that followed as the tea party of the devil? I can call myself a Christian, a Buddhist, a scientist, a skeptic, a believer, a musician, a spiritualist, a realist, an artist, a technologist, an engineer...all without a moments hesitation, doubt, or conflict. Think there is anything wrong with that statement? I'd bet the minds behind the production of this show would with most, save for one: Christian. Ultimately, what concerns me about this approach is a ""Matrix"" like top layer of control in endeavoring to assemble theories of credible minds on the topic into what begins to appear, as the film states itself in making the case, to inadvertently or quite intentionally capitalize on aspects of ""one religion"" as tools of the NWO. In a phrase, beware of false prophets. A quite obligatory bait and switch to what will seem a righteous course against Satanic cultism presented as the foundation of our would be oppressors. Let's pull those on-the-fence religious folks that saw a UFO into the fold. Those that equate ET phenomenon, Pepsi, or virtually everything else with Satan will be an easy sell. Yet, is that light truly salvation as it is being used here, or another form of control. The question I pose to you, producers of this film...How can you be so sure you are not compounding and expanding the agenda of those you seek to expose by simply invoking God as a placebo? OR are you actually part of it and fully sanctioned by the NWO? It can easily be flipped right over and seen as such. Especially with creepily small images and oddly hypnotic use of effects. No doubt abductees can silver bullet an abduction by asking for mercy from God and His son. There is indeed power in that which is as strong as the human will and faith can be. As in they believe they can, so they can. Be careful though...don't gulp that and pass around that cool-aid too quick, just...slow down a bit.",1483142400,2,3252,4.788256227758007

5015834,5,B006T5JZ4M,"How much you like this will depend on the world view (filter) you start with.  If you are a Christian and believe the Bible is in fact the Word of God, you will highly appreciate it.  This especially holds true if you hold the fallen angel view of Genesis chapter 6.  If you do not believe in the possibility of Biblical prophecy actually being true, you will find it silly.  ""For the word of the cross is folly to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God."" 1 Corinthians 1:18

As far as one reviewer stating this had too much to do with the ""devil,""  you cannot divorce Satan from the concept of the so-called ""new world order"" as both Jesus and Paul clearly state the ruler of the age/world/air is in fact Satan. (see just a few verses below)  So from a Christian/Biblical perspective, viewing Satan as being the one behind the NWO and pulling the strings is the only way to view it.  I think this documentary did a great job at building and supporting that case.

""I will no longer talk much with you, for the ruler of this world is coming. He has no claim on me,"" John 14:30
""Now is the judgment of this world; now will the ruler of this world be cast out."" John 12:31
""in which you once walked, following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience "" Ephesians 2:2
""In their case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, to keep them from seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God""  2 Corinthians 4:4",1476403200,9,1589,4.180327868852459

5015841,1,B006T5JZ4M,"The first couple of minutes were oddly filmed and framed.

The best way I can describe the look was to imagine a tissue box discreetly placed on a coffee table with a concealed camera shooting through a pin hole. A small boxy image that looked frayed around the edges and filling only about 60% of my TV screen. The same look, less the fuzzy edge, you get when watching a non-HD movie on an HD Channel.

I found it annoying, so I fast forwarded past the intro stuff to the actual movie, and faster, and forwarder, and more tiny fuzzy boxy picture with poor graphics and people being interviewed in someone's living room in front of the tissue box.

The incredibly high ratings and reference to UFO's sucked me in - the pathetic picture quality and elevator music (because the volume kept going up and down) brought my viewing experiment to an abrupt and unsatisfactory end.

Not sure what it was about; but, the portions I did see were very churchy evil lives scary.

5015847,1,B006T5JZ4M,"This movie is the equivalent of a glorified Christian street tract with it's scary imagery and music. It teaches the antichrist will be a human man or Satan mixed hybrid. Nothing about the fact that the word antichrist translates to false/imitation Christ. Revelation: antichrist looks like The Lamb but speaks as the dragon. A child can understand this. This video has you making sure to choose Jesus over the big, spooky devil...ok, fine, but leaving out the fact that Satan comes posing as Christ just BEFORE the true Christ returns would have you simply worshipping the first Christ you'll see, which is Satan. The Bible states Christ will return when the world least expects it, and of course you'd least expect it if you thought He was already here....but, surprise, it's actually Satan posing as the angel of God. THAT is the deception that will overtake the world and the ""mystery"" of the entire word of God. Satan is not going to have some dude act as ""antichrist"", he simply puts himself in place of Christ showing that he IS Christ as to deceive the world. Satan wants people to follow HIM, not some man in his place. ""Antichrist""/false Christ is simply a role/title of Satan reserved for that time, as he goes by many titles. Duh, hello? Wake up! Because of this simple fact, this film can easily deceive people into directly worshiping the first ""Jesus"" that sets foot on earth. I think the film makers meant well, but not realizing displays like this are part of the actual deception. It misses the most important thing so I'm sure Satan loves it, his mission accomplished.
  Also, how can anyone in this video claim that UFOs are piloted by the fallen angels when Jude 1:6 & 2nd Peter 2:4 clearly state that these angels are currently being held in chains of darkness until the time Satan is released as antichrist (Revelation)? At that time they will definitely be traveling in those vehicles, but right now only their spirits have influence and their souls are locked in the same abyss/bottomless pit that opens to release them in the book of Revelation. Then Satan comes posing as Christ at the 6th seal, 6th trumpet and 6th vial. There's the meaning of your mysterious 666. Pretty complicated huh? The information in this video is taught through fear, but real truth is always taught through love.

The subject of reincarnation was completely misunderstood, and I suggest any serious student of the subject consult the Vedic Scriptures, the oldest scriptures on the planet.  You'll understand that the purpose of life after life is not to ""become God"".  God doesn't BECOME God; He's God in all circumstances...got nothing to do with what we ""become"".  The purpose of reincarnation is, yes, to wake us up--only to wake us up in the right way!

I do not feel Christ wants me to go against anything happening in the world today.  Yes, I vote, but for a candidate who I think fills the position best from a secular position.  I would like to see more peace in the world, more things passed in my local gov't up to the national gov't that will help in the secular role they play towards the betterment of our world, our nation, our individual citizens.

If you are a student of so called ""alternative history"", prophecy or eschatology of Christianity, Islam or Judaism you have likely been exposed to at least some of this material already. The reason I did not give this a 5 star rating is because there was very little original content or research and much of the content is available on YouTube or from popular sources that do research of their own such as Chris Pinto, Chris White and so on.

It is fascinating seeing some Christian groups self-victimising, while they themselves assume some very judgemental points of view. As an author of self-empowering books and theologian, I must express my surprise that the fundamental Christian concepts of 'unity' that Jesus prayed for, and non-judgmental attitude he advocated for, are not reflected upon by those fundamentalist interpretations in the documentary. Of course, it is a choice to embrace knowledge and an open mind.
I am giving four stars for creativity of the film. However, one star is as much as I am willing to give for the theological accuracy of the message. For me one star does not reflect (I hate it) as suggested. It is an actual misinformation.

Similarly I suggest anyone who has ever wondered how on Earth some of the extraorinary events of recent times such as the 9/11 terror attacks, or the creidt crunch could have ever been ""allowed"" to happen by our political, financial and military leaders will find this film fascinating. As the old saying goes, the truth is out there somewhere and each of us owes it to our children (and indeed ourselves) to do our utmost to determine whether the conspiracy theories are just that, or if indeed there is some deeper Orwellian plot being hatched by an evil elite group of powerful individuals to enslave the modern world.

5015948,2,B006T5JZ4M,"""Age of Deceit"" is a Christian fundamentalist and conspiracist film, available for free on Youtube. Its ideas are similar to those of authors Thomas Horn, I.D.E. Thomas, Michael Heiser, Lynn Marzulli, etc. While I found the movie tedious, dishonest and somewhat bizarre, I admit that it does present the views of this particular milieu in a relatively coherent manner.

The main idea is that the New Age and the UFO phenomenon are Satanic deceptions, paving the way for the Anti-Christ. The Anti-Christ will create a One World Government and One World Religion, centred on worship of supposed aliens from outer space. In reality, the ""aliens"" are literal demons. Alien abductions and channelled messages that deny the Biblical view of Christ are the main pieces of evidence for the evil character of the New Age-UFO phenomenon.

The narrator supports the apocryphal Book of Enoch, identifying the fallen angels with the ""aliens"". There are also murkier ideas about our sinful nature somehow being literally encoded in the DNA. I didn't bother watching the entire film, but I've read some of the writers referenced above. They claim that the fallen angels mated with human females, giving rise to a race of ""giants"" known as the Nephilim, who had some kind of alien DNA.

Pictures from the 9/11 attacks, the Bohemian Grove (?) and suspicious quotes from various UN officials suggest a conspiracist worldview, as do references to the Freemasons and the Illuminati.

At several points, the film is either dishonest, or the producers are so ""under the ice"" that they didn't bother checking their facts. David Spangler is quoted as saying: ""No one will enter the New World Order unless he or she makes a pledge to worship Lucifer"". The quotation is a hoax. Nor has Spangler ever been employed by the United Nations - at least not as far as I know. Alice Bailey is quoted as supporting Hitler and the Nazis. The quote is taken out of context, and comes from a piece in which Bailey *attacks* Hitler and the Nazis for the very things the movie claims she is supporting!

The most humorous part of ""Age of Deceit"" comes when the narrator interviews an old Mason who claims to be Lucifer himself. However, it's obvious from context - the narrator's own words and the red fez of ""Lucifer"" - that the old man is a Shriner. The Shriners are a subdivision of the Freemasons specializing in harmless pranks and practical jokes! In other words, ""Lucifer"" was only joking. Yet, the narrator fell for it and posted the sensational revelation online?!

""Age of Deceit"" might tell us something about a particularly extreme fundamentalist subculture, but I don't think it offers any insight into ""fallen angels and the new world order""...",1353801600,8,2718,4.910675381263617

He especially deals well with the spiritual aspect of all this new age and strange phenomenon and he does not belittle the importance and the magnitude of what's going on.

Furthermore, although the narrator describes himself as a ""conspiracy theorist"", he's the type I love with everything well thought out and logically presented without the air of radicalism. He presents it even so that a skeptic will admit it's not something ""off the wall"" but more soundly based. I love the part where alien abductions can stop by mentioning the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and even fellow researchers admitted to this but when asked why they did not reveal this to the public, they 1) did not know what to make of it, and 2) did not want to ruin their credibility.

Myself and my two sons have been doing a long collective study on these many ideas/theories along with the use of Bible scriptures and other well known sources. It has drawn us to those same and similar conclusions as to what has been going on and what will be coming soon in and around our world. Jesus said the end times will be just like it was in the days of Noah when He returns. Well, what was it like on earth during those days of Noahs' time. That requires a lot of study and research which is not often taught in most churches today. My recommendation to those who are not up on Bible study and research is to get on the band wagon and find out the truth about what the Bible teaches and make a decision for Christ. You are either for Him or against Him. The Bible and Jesus Himself made such profound claims beyond any other book written that they demand ones utmost attention.

I don't know why he brings up and discredits the show Ancient Aliens and then turns around and talks about aliens for an hour. Also, he says that ""if these were advanced aliens, don't you think they would help us cure cancer and blah blah blah"" well how would this happen? A species would descend upon this planet and poof all the cancer is gone?

Even if a species did have a cure you don't think the powers that be (the first half of the documentary essentially) would do EVERYTHING in their vast power to stop the cure from getting out? So how do you know that this hasn't already happened? And perhaps the cure is sitting somewhere waiting to be released under the guise of a miracle cure that was given to us with decent intentions and manipulated by the greed of human beings? Again, just a perspective, but I understand where you were going with this.
