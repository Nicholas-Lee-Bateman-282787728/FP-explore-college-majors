6809091,4,B00PJURQAS,"As someone knows a thing or two about BDSM and not a stranger to Kink.com, I've been waiting to see this since the day I knew the project.
I found it entertaining because it got you behind the scene to know how those people work, although I already knew 80% of the stuffs they said in the film. I didn't give it 5 stars because it only addressed how the subs have control of everything, but it didn't address how doms justify that it's ok to spank or humiliate someone on screen (with the subs' consent). I bet most ""models"" play doms are not dominant in real life or don't practice BDSM in their life. We've been taught to be nice to people, and how you act all dominant and doing all mean things to the subs are not easy.

For those who feel lost during the documentary, here is an outline for you (based on my memory):
1. What Kink.com is. The armory.
2. CONSENT. Interviews before the shoot and after the shoot
  2.5 Directors and ""models"" (yes, it's the word they use at Kink) discuss their own BDSM tastes and journey.
3. What BDSM is, and what BDSM is not.
4. Women in porn.",1426464000,,1081,4.237864077669903

6809115,5,B00PJURQAS,"................
There's a lot to be said about this documentary, so I'll try to keep it succinct. First off, if you're looking for porno, look elsewhere. This fascinating documentary takes a look at ""KINK,"" a company that shoots primarily bondage pornography. It is true, if you're squeamish, or have to report to jesus on sunday, this is not ""shades of gray"" or whatever, so you might wanna move on. If you're into bondage porn, although there are women suspended upside down climaxing, it's not an ""arousing"" movie, unless you mean intellectually.
It's a very interesting and uninhibited look into the psychology of what ""KINK"" does shoot wise, but also largely about the concept of consensual sex. They pull no punches, there's some pretty serious nudity, and some really extreme situations, but where this earns 4 no nonsense stars for me, is in the interviews. Whether the director, set designer, or model, the interviews are absolutely riveting, ultimately human, and perhaps some of the most honest, candid and personal moments of people speaking caught on film I've seen since the dinner scene in ""My Own Private Idaho.""
Where the film picks up it's 5th star, is it's courage not to shy away from the more complicated issues surrounding the making of these types of, I guess I'll call it ""consensual violence."" Some models absolutely sincerely love what they do. Others might put themselves through more than they ought to knowing a paycheck is at the other end, but no more so than any physically demanding job. There are so many safeguards against abuse in place it's pretty astounding. One model I remember specifically seemed not stoked, but certainly far from upset. ""I'd rather be on your side of things,"" the model said to the director of the documentary at one point. ""It's all about transition,"" he finishes, far from a desperate soul, (so much as perhaps a slightly lost one). This is were some seriously cool paradigms of human behavior and chemistry come into play. The models are put through the wringer, emotionally, physically, and most are truly enthusiastic.
Even being aware of the safeguards and safe words in place, some scenes are still really difficult to watch. For me there's a bath tub simulated drowning thing at the end that really had my morals ready to launch into outrage mode, but fascination with the characters and the incredible lengths everyone involved goes through to protect the models keeps it from being too much.
My only complaint is that it's a bit short. I could've done another 15 minutes. ......it would've been nice if they showed the whole ""winding down after a scene"" routine a little more, they do document and talk about it at length, I guess really I could've used a few more interviews.
It's really sad that a movie about a taboo subject is bound to remain pretty obscure, but if you're comfortable in your own sexuality, and open minded enough to consider objectively what these folks are doing and talking about, I can't recommend this enough. In fact I think I'm going to watch it again while the rental's still good.
My theory is, shows like ""hoarders"" and ""intervention"" are popular because they examine extremes of human behavior. However, where those shows appear to exploit the subjects, this movie, (first, isn't about sick people) just shows a truly fascinating side of human behavior you don't see everyday, in a really candid, compelling way. I can't do it anymore justice rambling on. I would be surprised if this didn't end up in psychology classrooms. Maybe when America finally gets over trying to corral it's diverse sexual population.
5 stars. Lots to think about.",1427846400,23,3643,4.92520325203252

8688315,1,B00PJURQAS,"As a sexual educator and BDSM educator and personal Dom myself, as well as a personal fan of James Franco's, I was delighted to see this movie in the library.

However when I watched it I was appalled from the beginning, and continued to be until about 2/3rds of the way through when I couldn't continue watching.

This movie can hardly be called a documentary because it is NOT educational.

Nor is it a documentary about the kink community and BDSM.

It is a documentary about a pornography company that films BDSM torture scenes.

And from the very beginning you will see the basic rules of safe, sane and consensual being broken by this company.  You will watch models have things done to them that they are explicitly saying they DO NOT want done to them.

And worst of all you will be forced to watch sexual torture that you do not know you are signing up to watch and makes you feel that your own consent is being violated.

This film is nothing more than the filming of the filming of hardcore torture and rape pornography, with some commentary from the pornographers, that again is non-educational in nature, and is just their own personal thoughts and opinions and feelings and such.

The movie teaches you absolutely NOTHING about BDSM and Kink Culture, lifestyle or practices.  It seems as though its main goal is to shock and appall, which it will for any sensible person who doesn't know that this is not really a documentary, so much as a filming of torture pornography...in which the people are actually being tortured since they aren't even consenting to everything that is being done.

This movie is a great disservice to the kink community.  Far worse than 50 shades of grey.  I never thought I would say this but shame on you James Franco.",1491264000,,1759,4.617363344051447

8688317,4,B00PJURQAS,"""KINK: is a 2013 documentary about Peter Ackworth's KINK.COM internet BDSM site - produced by James Franco and Directed by Christine Voros .

People who are not particularly involved or interested in the REAL ( NOT ""50 Shades of Grey"" ) BDSM scene may find themselves a little 'shocked' by some of the content of this DVD. This is actually the second documentary to focus on the world of intense & interactive internet S/M theater  - the first one being: ""Graphic Sexual Horror"" (2009) from director: Barbara Bell - which told the story of Kink.com's predecessor: INSEX.COM. INSEX was persecuted and prosecuted by the US Gov Dept of Homeland Security for the alleged 'terrorific' BDSM subject  matter. The basic web-based S&M media empire concept was subsequently re-invented under the KINK.com banner... presenting essentially the same sort of bent subject matter to a subscription based public internet following.

The content & format of ""KINK"" is also somewhat similar to the earlier ""Graphic Sexual Horror"" doc. The film-makers wander around Kink.com's impressively massive home base in an old armory building in San Fransisco - interspersing snippets of interviews with the people who work there with brief glimpses into some of the 'scenes' that are being filmed. The latter include examples of both gay and straight BDSM action that appear pretty intense - with some full male & female nudity -. lotsa ropes and clamps and toys - moaning and groaning! What is illuminating and enlightening is the professionalism of the whole situation and the intelligence of all the individuals involved. As the interviewees point out. over & over again, this is not some sleazy abusive environment preying on marginalized individuals - rather it is a very 'responsible' organization that is dedicated to filling a special niche of the human sexual spectrum. Apparently this 'niche' is on the ascendant in a world that is ever more permissive and intrigued with 'intense/extreme' experiences - one scene shows all of the organization sitting around analyzing the sales statistics from each of the company's different 'titles' - all of which show monthly profits in the hundreds of thousands of dollars! Altho the film-makers hint at the potentially corrupting role that money plays in the whole affair - most of 'actors' involved in the painful pleasures seem to be really enjoying themselves.

As is typical of the documentary format - the fragmented aspect of the scenes portrayed do not allow the viewer to really 'get-into' the action but there ARE a wide variety of 'kinks' represented. Male tumescence is shown but not much female pubic action and there are no scenes of 'penetration' - the doc walks a fine line of becoming offensively 'pornographic' while examining its' transgressive subject matter.

Over-all I thot that this was a pretty engaging and informative documentary and enjoyed it. People who are familiar with the KINK product will recognize many of the 'personalities' featured on the website and it is interesting to hear them speak about their lives and motivations, Anyone wishing to immerse themselves more fully in the content alluded to in the documentary will need to look elsewhere to source the actual product that is shown being produced - there are DVD versions available on the internet, as well as the 'subscription' service that is the primary source for the product. A nice clear picture quality throughout - only 'extras' are a couple of 'trailers' for the film. As the people who are interviewed constantly state > ""this stuff isn't for everyone"" - but - this doc does a pretty good job of trying to shed some positive light on a, traditionally, dark corner of human sexuality.

8688318,4,B00PJURQAS,"The first thing to know about this DVD entitled: ""KINK: The 51st Shade of Grey"" is that it is the SAME 2013 documentary about Peter Ackworth's KINK.COM internet BDSM site - produced by James Franco and Directed by Christine Voros  - that is also sold under the title of. simply: ""KINK"".

This appears to be a Euro-version of the film - released in the Netherlands - with a different title and box cover art - obviously referencing the"" 50 Shades of Grey"" book & movie franchise - doubtless to make it seem more 'accessible' to the average viewer.

The DVD is relatively short - this Euro version of the film clocks in at 77 min. and I note that the N. American version is 80 min. long - whether this is a manifestation of the run time differential that occurs between PAL and NTSC formats or represents some 'cuts' isn't evident.  I have actually ordered a copy of the DVD titled ""KINK"" and will report on any disparity between the content of the 2 versions - once I get a chance to watch it!
