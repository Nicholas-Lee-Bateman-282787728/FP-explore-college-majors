8526088,5,B0088FS1FK,"Ross Patterson is a comedy genius and one of the only original thinkers left in the comedic film making world today. Darnell Dawkins Mouth Guitar Legend follows the fictional character Darnell Dawkins as he competes with Jimmy Hendrix throughout his life for women and the title of best guitarist. This movie is so well written it literally had me rolling on the floor laughing. If you are a fan of rock music and rock history DD is perfect for you! Ross Patterson fills his fictional story with legendary rockers and even keeps pretty good historical accuracy. It is filmed in a documentary style, similar to This is Spinal Tap and Hard-Core Logo. This is in my opinion Ross Patterson's best work, but it is probably also his least well known which is a shame. I would recommend this movie to any comedy fan and any classic rock music fan.",1430092800,,840,4.644295302013423
8526089,5,B0088FS1FK,"It's really something to find someone like Darnell Dawkins, someone I knew hardly anything about, and realize how big of an impact he had on the world of music and the relationships he built. This was an unbelievable film, really enjoyed every minute of it",1371513600,2,256,4.711111111111111
8526090,5,B0088FS1FK,"Within the first 10 minutes of this, I was completely enthralled. Darnell Dawkins? Clearly a rockstar. An insane rockstar. I'd watch this movie 10 more times and I feel like it'd never get old",1365638400,2,192,4.676470588235294
8526091,5,B0088FS1FK,"For about the 1st 15 or 20 minutes, I actually thought this was a real documentary until I recognized one of the actors.  The only way I can describe this film is by saying its like watching the craziest ""Behind The Music"" of all time. Appearances by Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Grace Slick, etc. make this feel like it's really real. Brilliant movie.",1360108800,2,351,4.571428571428571
