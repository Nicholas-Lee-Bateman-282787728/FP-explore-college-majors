723559,5,6303916880,"So, they say that the more advanced the mind is, the more it craves mindless play.  I like to think that rather than be known as a moron, but I love this movie.

It's dumb, juvenile, simplistic, glorifies dope heads, has mischievous grade school pranks, features promiscuity and is outright implausible, but it's also genius and entertaining from the script, to the acting and directing.
If you like Cheech and Chong movies, Star Trek parodies, and at least knew of Max Headroom, you will adore this movie even more.  Most people will NOT get it, I am sure.

I wish I had seen it in the theater as my friend did.  She told me that she saw a matinee of it where there was her and some other person in the entire theater.  After fifteen minutes, she was the only one watching it.  While she did not praise it, later when I caught it on satellite for the first time, I told her I felt honored I knew someone who actually paid to see it first run!  She still does not get it though and thinks it's still an awful stupid movie.

Stupid fun it is and I will not go into the story so you just have to watch it!",1393545600,,1103,4.18957345971564

723820,1,6303916880,There is a reason that upon ORIGINAL release into theaters the director had it credited as being directed by the Pseudonym Alan Smithee (for those of you with little to no knowledge of the pseudonum. Film and movie directors/producers/etc use Alan Smithee when they are unhappy and embarassed at the film they have created. Go look it up on Wikipedia) This is just an awefully unfunny movie. There is very little to laugh at or enjoy. Most of the jokes are unfunny or make little sense and fall flat  and most of the time you can tell that even the actors have little faith in the film when they show little effort to act well. I don't understand how anyone can enjoy this film when even the director was embarrassed by it upon its completion.,1249516800,,743,4.503703703703704

723823,4,6303916880,"Before there were teen movie parodies, there was National Lampoon's. I love comedies, but this has to be one of my favorites. This is the tale of the stuff kids can get into that their parents never find out about. My favorite character in the movie is the flamer, a man who believes that he's Capton Kirk with a blow up doll to boot. The only bad thing about this movie is the ending is under climactic, but that's what all are teen years lead up to.",1163376000,,451,4.195402298850575

723825,3,6303916880,"This is one of the last films National Lampoons made that was funny. Not classic funny like Animal House or the Vacation films, but decent enough to make you laugh.

A bunch of kids throw a party in the principals house and get busted. As a punishment they have to write an essay to the presidant of the US about why the education system is failing, and one of the students makes an impression and the class is invited to Washington to speak out with the presidant. Along the way there is partying, sex, booze, drugs and comedy. A weirdo obssesed Star Trek geek is stalking one of the students, the bus driver is Tommy Chong of the Cheech & Chogn fame, he add's some of the best moments of the film. There is a scene thats hilarious, watch for when Eric Edwards (the fat kid) asks one of the students to pull his finger in the park!

Theres no bonus features, it's worth purcasing if the price is right, i wouldnt pay too much for it. It's well worth a rent if you can, and your sure to enjoy these bunch of misfits.",1120262400,2,1016,4.231958762886598

723929,5,6303916880,"You're probably wondering why I'm rating this film so damn high. It's because I have a particular taste for this. I love this film. I'm a huge Kevin McDonald fan and the role he plays is just priceless. So, seeing that this film finally came to DVD, I'm not overjoyed, I'm ecstatic.

The film is simple. Really bad class make a foolish mistake after Principal tells them to, Senator with bad plot to President sees bad class, and wants to bring bad class to Capitol Hill to ruin President. It's simple, see? But, the antics that follow are so golden, so hysterical. Especially Chong's role as the sedated bus driver. Matt Frewer is also classic as well as Jeremy Renner and Rob Moore...both who should be in more films.

The film also boasts a killer soundtrack that I will always listen to, to this day. With rock and a great cast and some hysterical moments, this is a definite to your DVD collection. It's a bit dated, mostly because the times and all, but it's so good. I say this with all honesty, this movie really deserved better than it received, and since I have an opportunity to review this first, I shall put this movie to it's high rank! A ha!

Buy this...NOW. It's...great.

Good comedy for rainy day times.",1090540800,16,1221,4.51131221719457
723930,5,6303916880,"the average Joe on the street has probably never even heard of this movie, and for that they get my sincerest condolences. To sum this movie up in any other words than: 'f***ing hillarious' would mean that you've probably discarded your sense of humour for something else, like say, ice water in your veins. Granted, the ending is cheesy as they come, but after watching two VHS tapes to pieces (litterally!),I have finally procured the DVD!
A MUST see for everyone that thought Van Wilder, Road Trip etc. was funny. THIS movie is the greatest teen comedy ever, bar none!",1088035200,3,571,4.72
723931,5,6303916880,"I'll never forget when I heard that Tommy Chong was going to be in a movie on the previews and I was a Cheech and Chong fan at the time and although I didn't see it in the movie theater cause I wasn't old enough to watch it but we rented it and me and my family were laughing our butts off, and we taped it when it came on Starz movie channel and the tape got destroyed a few months later from watching it constantly, but a few years ago I decided to buy this movie on VHS (not sure if it's released on DVD or not) and I'm glad that I own this movie.
The movie takes place in Fairmount High School somewhere located in Ohio where this persistant principal makes sure that the students show up to class on time, but here we meet the main characters Dags and Reggie who are stoners show up late to class in an old Jeep and they crashed the pole and it lands on the principal's brand new car!! That scene was hilarious, then they cause a havoc at the assembly and the students decide to skip school and go party at the principal's house but unfortunately the principal finds out about it he is MAD!! There are some hilarious scenes at the party where I won't mention, then the principal gives the students a Saturday detention and the students claim that the government sucks and the principal wants the students to write a 500 word letter to the president about how they feel, then the president reads the letter and he really thought well of it and he invites the students to Washington D.C. to express themselves about how they feel about the school system, we then get to meet Senator John Lerman who is a bad guy cause he wants to make the president a laughing stock and he wants to become the president and the students go off to Washington D.C. and there are a bunch of hilarious moments throughout the movie which I'm going to keep for myself, and Tommy Chong plays the stoner bus driver who is really hilarious throughout the movie.
I was surprised to hear that the movie got really bad reviews from the critics and I think that their problem is that they don't have much of an open mind and it bombed in the box office which was unfortunate, if you're in the mood for a comedy where you just want to sit down and laugh, this movie is recommended.",1082678400,6,2253,4.2540792540792545
723932,1,6303916880,"Although I have liked the National Lampoon flicks and have seen them all (several are in my all-time favorite category), this one, except for Tommy Chong is a total waste of time. Tommy plays a minor role but is the only character who does not overact as a compensation for terrible writing. And that is the great flaw here since it is generally well cast. The writing is horrible and trying to find a laugh is not easy... a few smiles maybe... and I was in the mood for a good laugh. Mind you, I do like most comedies... event those the critics do not like. Save your money.",1074643200,,575,4.284403669724771
723933,3,6303916880,"its not that bad, I mean it had a lot of great moments people and tehre were some downfalls but please. MAtt Frewer was good and so was Jeremy Renner as Dags. also note that Jeremy Renner goes on to play Jeffrey Dahmer in Dahmer and also can be scene in season 1 of ANGEL as Penn. Kevin McDoanld as the crossguard/wanna be star trek fan is hilarious. the fat guy played by Eric Edwards(note he was teh fat blob in BLADE) who has a fasination with blonde asians is uproarous. Tommy Chong as Red is awesome and Renner's stoner buddy is great as the stoner who keeps seeing Kevin McDonald and his blowup doll. the part where their taking the picture and Edwards blows a fart igniting McDonald on fire is teh highlight.",1069459200,,715,4.343283582089552
723934,5,6303916880,Senior Trip is the greatest ... movie of all time!!! I remember when I first time I saw it. I saw it w/ my best friend and we started to cry because it was so funny. It was so histarical. No other movie even comes close to how funny it was. There is only one flaw to make it a 100% movie... it should be a DVD it still isn't one... I'm mad a bout that. New Line Cinema should make it a DVD. I don't see why they don't do it. Anyways it's my favorite movie of all time... So I guess thats it so... See it!!! I really recomend you should... I promise you won't be dissapointed!!!,1049241600,3,577,3.857142857142857
723935,5,6303916880,"This movie would be nothing without the brilliance and gracefulness of the young Canadian actor, Kevin McDonald.
His portrayal of the crossing guard is something that can only be compared to Brando in the Godfather.",1027555200,2,215,5.171428571428572
723936,5,6303916880,"The first time I saw this movie, I was rolling on the floor from laughing so hard. The actors, storyline, all perfect, especially Matt Frewer who plays... principal everyone despises. Best part: when Miowski(a fat Cheetos addict) takes a leak from the back of the bus right onto a trailing minivan, and then the driver casually turns on the winshield wipers. That part was a classic. Dopers Richie and Dagastino (Dags for short) are great as well. Overall: this is one high school field trip you'll want to take again and again.",1012089600,,528,4.75
723937,5,6303916880,"I remember the first time i watched this movie, from the scene were the two guys stumble out of an old mail jeep (with an immense smoke cloud  following them) after they just ran into their school's flagpole, i laughed  as hard as i could and i didn't stop until the credits were done.  Its one  of those few movies that actually makes you hurt because your laughing so  much.  Tommy Chong and that guy from the kids in the hall (i cant believe i  can't remember his name, he was my favorite)both do a great job in this  movie.  Tommy basically plays the old chong character, but this time he's a  school bus driver, and he actually reminds me of this one bus driver i had  that let us do anything.  Kevin Mcdonald (I remember now) does a amazing  comic job as a psychopathic, crossing guard, star-trek junkie who somehow  believes that one of the students is a Klingon ambasador and must be  termanated.  The basic story isn't anything special, basically the kids have  to get to washington in a few days to speak at a senate hearing on  education reform.  But the comic brilliance of the scenes that actually  take place in this movie are pure gold.  I can't believe this didn't come  out in theatres (or did it?) because im sure it would be a smash with the  youth market.  It really does rank up there with Kingpin, maybe a little  less funny, but if you like Kingpin then theres no doubt you'd love this.  But please, if you are offended by ANYTHING, then don't watch this movie,  you'll just want to complain about how offensive or mean-spirited it is.  As a side note, I don't understand how people can actually be offended by  something they see in a movie, can't they just forgot their ego for a  second and laugh?  Also there are two versions of the movie, one edited and  one uncut.  I'd say go with the edited, because all of the scenes that were  cut desearved to be cut, they just were not that funny and kind of brought  the whole movie down.  Especially the alternate ending where there is a  final confontation between the crossing guard and the stoner guy, it was a  few chuckles but the original ending was much better.",966816000,,2138,4.401028277634961

It's a very funny film. You can watch it and think, I knew someone like that in high school. It's about a group of students going to Washington. The students range from smart to complete idiot's.
