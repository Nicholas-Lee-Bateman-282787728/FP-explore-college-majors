Out for the team-Papa encourages brother to try out for the Bear Country baseball team. Sister decides to try out too. Brother worries that he won't make the team but Sister and will and fakes an arm injury.

Mighty milton- A new cub comes to town and is picked on by Too Tall and his gang. Brother tries to find a sport that Milton is good at so that Too Tall will leave him alone. After trying all the sports Brother doesn't think Milton is good at anything either but then finds a solution.

green eyed monster-Brother out grew his bike and got a new one. Sister was to get Brother's old bike but when Brother comes home with a shiny new bike, Sister is envious. All she can think about is trying out the new bike but she isn't big enough to ride it.

go to camp- the cubs go to summer camp and have a great time. The last night of camp will be an overnight camp in a tent and sister is afraid of sleeping outside. Lizzie tries to ease her fears by doing a mock sleep out in sister's back yard.

Bonus George Shrinks episode Round up the usual insects - George is doing a project collecting all kinds of insects. His mother is having an art party at her house. His little brother lets the insects loose and George and his friend Becky have to round them up before they ruin his moms party.",1459814400,,1563,4.061688311688312
