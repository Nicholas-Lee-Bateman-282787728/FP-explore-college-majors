7912782,3,B00000JN30,"This movie could have had a lot more going for it. The acting was forced or barely discernable as acting.

Story wise it's different.  A street fighting lawyer in need of money gets a loan from loanshark pal.  The debt is forcably sold to lawyers childhood friend, Luis, now a big time thug.  Luis gets the lawyer to start fighting to pay off debts.

This COULD HAVE BEEN something better but wasn't.",1513728000,2,400,4.5

7912784,3,B00000JN30,"""Street Law"" is the second collaboration between director Damian Lee and former action hero Jeff Wincott, following&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fatal-Combat/dp/B0000049B9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fatal Combat</a>. This one adds a different tone to their association and is a genuinely better film, but it's not a great movie for depriving Wincott of one of his major strengths.

The story: a renegade lawyer (Wincott) is disbarred and blackmailed for his choice of violent extracurricular justice, and finds himself drawn into the cruel web spun by a former childhood friend turned kingpin (Paco Prieto,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Only-the-Strong/dp/B0000DD76R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Only the Strong</a>).

The plot is the film's greatest strength. I like Wincott's character, who punishes a wealthy sadist spared by the court by handcuffing him and allowing a former victim to bludgeon him with a baseball bat. I also like Paco Prieto as a villain: not only do I enjoy the 100% personal objective of his master plan (opposed to making it about wanting to get rich, etc.), but I also love his villainous delivery - being one of the few performers in B-movies to speak with such a thick, cheesy Spanish accent without losing one ounce of menace. Oddly enough, the film makes a big deal about Wincott's character being Native American, to the point of beginning the movie with him running through the woods in tribal gear with a bow, and later showing a penchant for fringe jackets. This is such a weird, meaningless addition to the character - especially since Wincott himself doesn't have Indian heritage - that I can only assume writer-director Lee just wanted to write about a Native American character...but hey, I don't mind it.

The movie doesn't skimp too badly on action, at least not once it reaches its second half, where there are five hand-to-hand fights to be seen. The problem? - you guessed it! - none of them are very good. The biggest sins of these fights are an overuse of slow motion - worse yet, slow motion for no reason, where entire sequences are slowed down without purpose - and the fact that several segments are filmed from underfoot, which I realized while watching is just about the worst perspective to shoot a fight scene from. It also hurts that the only recognizable fighters in the film are Jeff and Paco, and it hurts even more that their expected finale isn't very good. Prieto had created minor magic when he fought Mark Dacascos two years earlier, but here he is fairly uninspired in his physical performance - something I blame on the generally bland choreography.

Two casting choices which are interesting in retrospect: Richard Yearwood would later graduate from sidekick school here to voice&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Donkey-Kong/dp/630555952X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Donkey Kong</a>, and the flashback child form of Wincott's character is played by none other than Hayden ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Anakin-Skywalker/dp/B001EN71DQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Anakin Skywalker</a>"" Christensen. Neither of them adds particularly much to the movie, but that's fine, since it's pretty good on its own...as a thriller. As an action movie it's lacking, but I consider the story strong enough to stand on its own without needing to be bolstered by kicks. Die-hard Wincott fans ought to check it out.",1360972800,,3531,5.758620689655173
7912785,3,B00000JN30,"I found this movie to get a bit confusing at times, unless you pay complete attention.  The story, though a bit original, gets exciting at times, then a little draggy.  Its about a lawyer named John (Jeff Wincott - Mission of Justice, The Killing Man, Deadly Bet) who goes to great lengths to make sure justice is served, even if it means going broke and borrowing money from crazy loan sharks.  When he finally loses his job completely, John turns to his old friend Lewis (Paco Christian Prieto - Only The Strong, Champions) to help him get some money and repay his debts.  Lewis forces John to fight in several ring fights, and John learns of the misdeed his old pal is involved with, forcing justice to once again be served.  Interesting story, but felt inconsistent throughout.

Honestly, I bought the movie for 2 reasons - martial arts fighting and Jeff Wincott.  The best thing about Street Law is in fact Jeff Wincott.  You will most likely come across a better actor in the b-movie action genre who also has exceptional martial arts skills.  He performs well in Street Law, and really creates an individual character, as he does well in most of his films.  There is not much action until the ring fights, and even then they are probably the least exciting ring fights I have seen in any movie.  Jeff Wincott is capable of good ring fights, as one of his earlier films - Deadly Bet - proves nicely.  Its not really his faul in Street Law, it just looked like the creators barely tried to show off any good action.  In the end, Wincott fights Prieto, in only an average fight.  The directing is a little poor at first, then the last part of the fight is ok, but overall its just average, and what I would consider to be below average for these guys.

Street Law is a good b-movie, but its different and not necessarily always with good feeling.  Wincott does the best with what he has to work with, the story is exciting about mid-way through the movie, but action is quite limited.  Its not nearly what I expected, and once you've seen this movie once, you probably won't want to watch it again anytime too soon.",1184025600,,2119,4.490861618798956
