8216709,2,B000V6LTDU,Point de Fuite is a delightful 10-minute film about a nude high school geometry class.  But the rest of the disc contains body dismemberments and other dreadful stuff you probably don't want in your house.  Be content to watch the only good part on YouTube.,1361923200,3,257,4.688888888888889
8216710,5,B000V6LTDU,"I came across this collection on a night of random searching through the internet. I saw a preview of his work on the Cult Epics website. Spiritual Exercises: a great title, I thought.
  Watching this hermetic preview I perceived a strange mix of artfulness and simplicity unfolding before my eyes, a touch of exploitation dissolved in delicate restraint, in lyricism of Baudelairean intensity. Images from the different films were confused with each other, and a line of poetry resonated inside this fragmentary, visual shell. I was intrigued. I purchased.
  A great discovery. The author's words spoke to me, his images enraptured me. A very simple approach to filmmaking, yet very effective. There was nothing really new or original about this work, but paradoxically it was all new and original. Yes, that is the way I would put it. The way I would clarify this is as follows: This is a filmmaker who being an auteur comes through as an amateur, in the true sense of the word. A lover. A lover of cinema, a lover of the image, a lover of the object. I say this because what he loves are objects. One can sense that it is a love of objects and a desire to film certain objects that motivates these configurations and confabulations. One can learn much from the poetry of embalming, of objectifying the living. It is true there are many dangers in so doing, but he who risks little risks little gain.

  I say nothing of the films. They speak for themselves and all attempts to refer to them would be absurd or a task not really intended for a simple review such as this. If you find this comment on the film confusing it is only because it is useless to attempt a description through our language, anything else would merely describe plots and ideas. Five out of five. Or more. Something to be seen, something to own.",1241827200,6,2410,4.7764423076923075
