8050520,4,B0007QA0CU,"It's as important to know about the history of capoeira as it is to learn all the moves and songs. This DVD is a good start to learning what capoeira was, what it is and what it might become, all told by two of the martial art's most respected mestres, Mestre Acordeon and Mestre Nestor Capoeira.",1213833600,,296,4.303571428571429
8050521,5,B0007QA0CU,"I knew a little about Capoeira since I had traveled Rio de Janeiro, and always wanted to learn more but didn't have any resource.  And then I found this DVD and quickly ordered. First of all, I ordered on Tuesday and received on Friday the same week!  That was the fasted delivery I have ever received. Thank you very much Jedidiah.

It's not a high budget documentary film, but  instead you can hear all the deep informative talks and discussion between 2 masters and students, with a lot of interludes showing breath-taking games. You will totally lose your breath once you see their movements!!  What I liked the most was that students show so much respect towards masters. And I finally got to know what Capoeira really is.  I'm waiting for the volume 2!",1142985600,,758,4.619402985074627
8050522,4,B0007QA0CU,It was nice to hear the perspectives of these two well-known mestres.  I only wish that there could have been more jogos.,1141776000,,121,4.5
8050523,5,B0007QA0CU,"This DVD makes a wonderful addition to current resources on Capoeira, both for insiders (or practitioners) of the art and for outsiders interested in the academic and socio-cultural history of the traditions.  Having assigned the two mestres' (Acordeon's and Nestor's) books in my college classes (both to graduate and undergraduate students alike) as well as to advanced high school students in a college preparatory program, I am excited to include this DVD as a supplement for students' learning!  Axe ASCAB!",1125014400,,511,5.375
8050524,5,B0007QA0CU,"I love this DVD. Unlike many capoeira videos, Masters of Capoeira, explores some of the less discussed topics in capoeira like women in capoeira, contemporary Capoeira, the symbolism of the chamada.  All this helps address the philosophical side of capoeira and deepen our understanding of this emerging martial art into mainstream culture.  Plus, the DVD has cutaways to amazing montages of capoeira games with living legendary Mestres.

Whether you're breaking into the world of capoeira or are interested in going deeper into the philosophy and roots, this DVD is a great asset to a thriving capoeirista career.",1124496000,,614,5.309278350515464
8050525,5,B0007QA0CU,"I found the first hand experiences of Both Mestre Acordeon and Nestor Capoeiria to be very informative and insightful, this dvd is a nice intro to the history and development of capoeira in more recent times.",1121385600,,208,4.805555555555555
8050526,5,B0007QA0CU,"A wonderful blend of inspired action footage and historic photos woven in with these two living legends sharing their stories and perspectives, prompted by questions from an informal panel.  The richness of the art and a general sense of good will pervade.  Hungry for a next episode!",1121040000,,284,5.0212765957446805
8050527,5,B0007QA0CU,I just received my DVD two days ago and already watched couple of times. Mestre Acordeon again made a perfect job! The video is 75 minutes but do not wait for a 75 minutes of Roda. Mestre Acordeon and his lovely students talks with Mestre Nestor Capoeira about his 40 years of Capoeira experience. Meanwhile you have chance to watch games and shows of capoeira. What else? for the first time! I saw in this DVD M. Suassuna playing with M. Acordeon. Buy this DVD!,1119312000,,462,4.447058823529412
