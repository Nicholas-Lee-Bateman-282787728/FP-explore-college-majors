There's last second heroics by his airness Michael Jordan along with the Game 5 of the NBA finals where he had a stomach virus, and also spectacular moves by fellow team mate Scottie Pippen. The Chicago Bulls are the team of the 90s and no other team will be able to match that of the bulls. This video is a must buy!!",967507200,4,428,4.107142857142857

158791,4,079398257X,"I have been a fan since 1985, even though I am from NYC. The bulls brought to basketball renewed interest in game with their playing. My only disappointment was that it was only highlights of the games. I would have liked to have seen the entire games. You saw the escalation of all the players, improving their abilities really putting their talents to work. Back then the team's that made it to the finals really were outstanding and the games were just fantastic to watch the moves the skill levels, it was just great. Unlike to day where even the games sequencing was dictated by sponsors, stretching it out so the were more shows about games coming and more sponsors. I guess that's why a lot of original lovers of the game turn to college and even high school to see good games. But the video was well worth it fantastic to relive and enjoy a great sport. The Amazon for providing same. I know of hard core baseball fans who say the enjoy the game above all but as soon as there particular team is eliminated the no longer care to watch if their team is not there.",1403395200,,1070,4.381909547738694
158792,3,079398257X,"Diificult to do it, but quality is not great because of SD. Great to relieve the glory of the Unstopabulls, but could be better!",1400630400,,128,4.375
158793,2,079398257X,"This is a basic bare look back at the 5th championship the bulls won.
Some highlights of the season and then the same in the playoffs/final.
Really no insight to the behind the scenes from the season.",1399507200,,200,4.4324324324324325
158794,5,079398257X,After watching the Chicago Bulls for ten years I haven't watched any basketball since.  How can you compete with perfection.,1397952000,,124,5.2
158795,5,079398257X,This is a great film to watch for any Chicago Bulls fan. The quality of the picture is great too.,1395964800,,97,3.9
158796,5,079398257X,"A special trip down memory lane, as I watched these guys in action.  It was weird seeing a lot of the other players who are now long retired from basketball.  Unbelieva-bull!  Some say Kobe is better than Michael, but I have to disagree and not only because I'm a Chicago-area native.  If you love the Bulls, then you'll love this re-cap of an awesome championship run!",1395100800,,369,4.545454545454546
158797,3,079398257X,"Good video. Captures well the Bulls 5th Championship against the Jazz. Finely shows the performances of Jordan, Pippen, Stockton,
and Malone. Greatly shows game 5 with Michael Jordan, afflicted with a stomach virus, having a great game. One of the best performances in NBA history. Must have if a Jordan fan.",1389052800,,308,5.0588235294117645
158798,5,079398257X,"It's the Bulls in their heyday.  Reseeing the teamwork and the commentary is great.  Steve Kerr, Tony Kucoc(sp?), and of course Pippen and Jordan are always great to watch.",1388102400,,172,4.896551724137931
158799,5,079398257X,"It feels good to get excited about basketball again - and that's what watching MJ and these Bulls does. I hope we can still make it into the playoffs and put up a fight this year... if not, there's always these old Bulls videos. heh.",1388016000,,233,4.2
158800,5,079398257X,"Fresh off a 72-win season and a 4th world title, what was left for the Chicago Bulls to accomplish?  How about 69 more wins and a 5th title.  The Bulls showed that they were not resting on their accomplishments from the previous season, once again dominating the league and breezing into the playoffs.
Facing the Utah Jazz in the NBA Finals, the Bulls, led by Jordan, who's heroic performance in game 5 while fighting a stomach virus will surely go down as one of the most memorable performances by a player ever, the Bulls defeated John Stockton, Karl Malone, and the Jazz 4 games to 2, clinched by Steve Kerr's gutsy last-second shot in the game 6 clincher in Chicago.
This video is loaded with highlights and interviews with coaches and players, but my favorite part was watching Jordan in game 5 willing his team to victory.  Watch this and see ""Da Bulls"" win yet another title.",1081900800,,882,4.6050955414012735
