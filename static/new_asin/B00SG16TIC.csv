I checked every disc and the episodes were correct, despite other reviews saying the discs were incorrectly labeled/duplicates. So I'm definitely happy with this purchase.

My one complaint is that there are only commentary options on a few episodes per season, but that's a super minor problem.",1523318400,,421,4.662162162162162

6982485,4,B00SG16TIC,"Pawnee, Indiana. The Parks and Recreation department of the local government is pulled between two forces: the apathetic director, Ron Swanson, a staunch libertarian who is opposed to government spending, and the over-eager, hyper-confident deputy director Leslie Knope, who believes in the positive potential of government to make people's lives better. When local musician Andy Dwyer falls into a big pit on derelict land and breaks his legs, his girlfriend Ann Perkins inspires Leslie to turn the land into a new park...and starts a journey that will take numerous people to destinies they were not expecting.

Parks and Recreation is an American sitcom that ran for seven seasons and 125 episodes between 2009 and 2015. It started life as a conceptual spin-off from the American version of The Office, sharing writers and crewmembers with that show and also employing the same mockumentary format, but having its own distinct storyline, characters and theme. It was also conceived as a comedy vehicle for comedienne Amy Poehler (Mean Girls, Blades of Destiny, The Ex). After a rocky start, it became one of the most critically-acclaimed comedies on American television.

The show's first season establishes the fictional town of Pawnee, Indiana and focuses on Leslie (Poehler)'s attempts to turn a local waste ground into a park, only to face the slow, soul-destroying gears of local government, apathy from her boss and opposition from those who want to turn the ground to commercial purposes. The first season is the weakest, mainly because it struggles to find a solid direction for the characters. The writers seem tempted at the start of the show to make Leslie well-meaning but bumbling and incompetent for easy laughs, which is sometimes funny but mostly tedious, and also feels like a retread of The Office. By the time the show moves into its second season, the writers have decided to make Leslie hyper-competent and good at her job, with difficulties and comedy arising from the opposition she faces rather than her own weaknesses. This immediately gives the show much more of an empathetic quality, with the audience rooting for Leslie and sharing her frustration at the increasingly ridiculous problems she has to overcome.

However, the main reason Parks and Recreation works is the fact that the cast and characters are simply excellent. Ron Swanson (Nick Offerman), the show's breakout character, is a libertarian who hates government and believes in self-reliance, but he is also a man of honour whose taciturn exterior belies his affection for his frien...sorry, workplace proximity associates. He gets almost all of the show's best lines. April Ludgate (Aubrey Plaza) is a quiet and self-declared lazy rebel who tries to avoid work and emotion, but gradually over the course of the series becomes a committed, hard-worker with an affinity for animals. Andy Dwyer (Chris Pratt) is a dumb goofball who is also a surprisingly good musician. He also enjoys creating characters such as ""Burt Macklin, FBI"" and ""Johnny Karate"", a children's entertainer. Tom Haverford (Aziz Ansari) is a budding mogul who initially falls into a number of get-rich-quick schemes, but in later seasons develops real business acumen and becomes more successful. Ann Perkins (Rashida Jones) is the straight man to Leslie's manic ball of energy, whose bemused reactions to the insanity of Pawnee act as a substitute for the audience. It's worth noting that almost all of these actors have gone on to good things since the show ended (Plaza in Legion, Pratt in the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise and wider Marvel Cinematic Universe, Ansari in Master of None and Jones in Angie Tribeca).

Another way the show succeeds is the way it evolves as it goes along. Each season revolves around a particular challenge, project or obstacle which Leslie has to overcome, helped by her friends. Seasons 3 and 4, arguably the show's high point, sees Leslie having to help bring Pawnee back from the brink of bankruptcy, host a massive Harvest Festival, undertake a clandestine romance with a colleague and then run for the city council. Later seasons see characters leave the department and set up their own businesses or join other organisations, before Season 7 (set three years after the rest of the show) breaks up the gang altogether. Parks and Recreation is a show that enjoys character development and moving people around as they get new jobs and find new interests, contradicting the need of most shows (comedy or otherwise) to create a status quo that works and then milk that for all it's worth. Old characters leave, new ones come in and minor characters rise to major prominence over the course of time. Life can be a bit of a revolving door of experiences and people, and this is something Parks and Recreation celebrates.

Another part of Parks and Recreation's success is the town of Pawnee, Indiana. More than a few critics have said that Parks and Rec is the closest we've ever seen to a live-action version of The Simpsons, not for the core characters or style of humour (which are very different), but for the fact that Pawnee is as insane but impressive a fictional creation as Springfield, Misc. in The Simpsons. As well as the town's geography and businesses, it has a cast of bizarre, minor and regularly recurring characters which gradually accumulate over the course of the seven seasons to such a size that you could populate an actual town with them. These include porn star Brandi Maxxx, reporter Shauna Malwae-Tweep, local fortune heir Bobby Newport, Native American tribal representative-turned casino mogul Ken Hotate (""taking our money back from white people one quarter at a time""), exactingly literal chat show host Perd Hapley and Ron's recurring ex-wife and she-demon from hell, Tammy (Mk. 2). The constant way these characters (and dozens more) flit in and out of the narrative gives the impression of this being a living, real and quite astonishingly dysfunctional town.

There are some negatives. The first season takes a little while to get into gear, and there are a few moments (most notably in Seasons 5 and 6) when it feels like the show has run out ideas and spends a few episodes churning out running gags before hitting on a new direction. The character of Mark - who was set up as a straight man to the insanity of the rest of the cast - feels a bit redundant after Ann took over that role in Season 2 and his departure at the end of that season was a good move. Tom, arguably, doesn't start evolving into a more interesting character than just a selfish jerk until the third season.  But for a show that lasts 125 episodes, it has a remarkably high hit rate.

Parks and Recreation (****) is a funny, thoughtful and warm-hearted show about friendships, the clash of ideology and reality and how people of different convictions can work together for the common good. Brilliantly cast and frequently hilarious, it shows again that Michael Schur is one of the funniest writers working in American television (having previously worked on the US Office and, subsequent to this episode, worked on Brooklyn Nine-Nine and The Good Place).",1521504000,,7163,4.993299832495812

The actors deliver their lines and sly looks into the camera in the manner of The Office, but the difference is this show has heart. Amy Poehler is so very perfect as the naive overachiever Leslie Knope (one of the all-time great character names). In fact, everyone is perfect in their roles. This is so well done, you would never guess it is its first season. I base this review on the first season and I cannot wait to watch the rest. A great set.",1510358400,3,552,4.266666666666667

I wish the DVDs had more bonus feaures, especially more commentary in later seasons, but that's a minor complaint.

The actual product's packaging is nice as well - you get 7 normal size DVD cases that all fit into the box, so it's easily mobile if need be.

Bottom line - if you like ""The Office,"" you'll love Parks & Rec. Ron Swanson may be one of the best TV characters of all-time!",1499904000,,563,4.242990654205608

Almost all of the characters are lovable and the day-to-day situations that they find themselves in are relatable (even though they are ridiculous). Amy Poehler really embraces the character Leslie Knope and brings her to life. Her unbeatable enthusiasm is one of the things that makes the show great.

Lots of fast dialog - listen closely or you will miss some of the subtleties.  And do not bypass the Deleted Scenes - it's like getting a partial extra episode.,1495152000,,321,4.145161290322581

I want more, especially for the infinite jest episode.  I really wanted to here commentary for it but that's just me wanting this show to never end because I've watched it so much and it always cheers me up. Happy The Good Place is on now so I have something else to watch that I enjoy as much!  The show is hilarious, it's impossible not to get attached to the characters.  The last season is incredible!  If you've tried watching it in the begining the first season isn't a good depiction of the show and you should try it from the second because it only gets better.  Every additional major character added or minor character seems so well developed and turns it into its own world you can't help but get caught up in and want to see more.  The cast is so funny.  The writing is smart and sweet.  I love everything about this show.  I could go on and on about it so I'll just leave it at that.",1484870400,4,1058,4.261306532663316

I regret not following up with the second season, as it got brilliant very quickly. This show is filled with huge swings, most of which are big hits, and it has, arguably, one of the funniest lines in TV history. Searching the internet for Leslie's symptoms is all I'll give away. The show is filled with many moments approaching this, and there are very few episodes that aren't laugh-out-loud funny. There are many recurring jokes that really work and aren't overused. I also found myself really caring about the characters, and not as just a vessel to say and do funny things. There is a marriage that I thought would be played for laughs and be over in months, but it lasted, and it was the most natural pairing in the world of Pawnee.

Hilarious, surprising, and heartwarming at times, Parks and Recreation should go down as one of the best TV comedies of all time.",1482192000,,1027,4.4338624338624335

I'm glad I read the reviews because several people said it started slow but got better.  I found that to be true in my opinion as well.  About midway thru the first season is when I started to really enjoy it.  Definitely one of the better shows, and I'm not a big fan of the ""looking into the camera"" as if it's a documentary, but after a while I didn't notice this as much.

The show has a strong mythology that they are remarkably consistent with.  It's really nice to have a show that treats it's characters as people who act in accordance with their beliefs.  And I love the reoccurring side characters.

That means no offline viewing, but more importantly, you can never cancel your Amazon account without losing all of your purchased content. F-U Amazon!
Or, should Amazon suddenly go under, you lose everything. Too far-fetched? It wasn't long ago that MySpace was king of social mediathen Facebook came along.  So yeah, Amazon can bite the dust too.
But on pure principle, when I BUY something, I should to OWN it, and be able to take it wherever I wish.
When the complete series on DVD was offered, ever so briefly, for $51.00, I JUMPED on it.  Yeah baby...they may be on discs, but I OWN them.

6983025,5,B00SG16TIC,"It is very easy to try to compare the series with The Office, given that it takes on the same mockumentary tone and was created by the creator and one of the writers of The Office.  In some ways it did have a feel of The Office applied to community government, but once Parks and Rec found its footing it really stood out as being different creative, and every bit as good as The Office without being a blatant carbon copy.

The show had an ensemble cast of characters centered around Amy Poehler's Leslie Knope, the Deputy Director of the Pawnee Indiana Department of Parks and Recreation and her boss, Ron Swanson, played brilliantly by Nick Offerman.  Many story lines centered around her desire to help everyone and his desire to have government function as little as possible.  Each did a great job playing their bleeding heart liberal, and small government libertarian roles, and some of the best moments on the show came when one of them would best the other.  The rest of the cast was a true ensemble of relatively little known actors (until Rob Lowe arrived in season 3).  Even with all the characters, and personalities the show did a good job of giving all the characters some depth and stories to grow within.  Really the only main cast member whose character did not develop much was Paul Schneider who left after the second season.

The show also boasted a bunch of guest stars ranging from cameos by Washington Politicians to recurring character actors.  Probably the best was Megan Mullally, Nick Offerman's real life wife, who played is ex wife Tammy 2, who was always trying to corrupt Ron.  Her appearances were really the only time Nick Offerman was able to drop the gruff no-nonsense persona of Ron Swanson (aside from when he got to giggle at Leslie's expense) which were really the highlights of any of the seasons.  The addition of Rob Lowe (playing the ultra chipper city manager who incorrectly uses the word literally in almost every sentence) and Adam Scott as Ben Wyatt, really did a lot to round out the cast and gave the show the feel it would have almost to the end.

The show really did track (and make fun of) the ever changing political climate from 2008 to 2015.  It spoofed the various national budget crises, government shutdowns, and sex scandals.  You never got the sense that it took itself too seriously or was being preachy about anything, although it is clear what the political leanings of the actors and show runners were.  And there were enough stories totally outside the political realm (like Tom's many questionable entrepreneurial ventures) that I think it would be enjoyable regardless of your political leanings or if you had no interest in politics at all.

The set itself is just the individual seasons packaged in one decorative box.  Pretty much exactly like The Office's Complete series set was.  All the extras were the original material included in the individual season releases.  In the first three seasons there were commentary tracks on many episodes, deleted scenes for every episode, and the alternate producer's cuts for some episodes.  From season 2 on there was an uncensored gag reel every year.  After season 3, the commentary tracks stopped and they started putting some of the commercials and PSAs that aired in the show in the bonus material, as well as things like the Olympics promos, behind the scenes material and the Mouse Rat performances.  Overall a lot of material, but there are no extras just for the complete series set alone, so there is no need to get this if you bought the individual seasons as they were released.

liking or disliking any show is very subjective, and this is no different.  It was definitely a more adult sit-com, and the show did sometimes skirt the edge of what they could get through the censors.  It was probably guilty of trying to hang on a little too long, but the final season was a short one (only 13 episodes) and I think they did a great job of wrapping the series up.  Most likely anyone reading this would have already seen enough of the show to know what it is, but if you are one who has not seen it and only heard about it (as I was when I got this set), I would definitely recommend it.  Especially if you are a fan of shows like The Office, Arrested Development or anything in a similar vein to those.",1439683200,27,4326,4.6430446194225725

I watched its whole 7-year run on TV and always loved it, and I'm reminded of just how much I love it as I watch these DVDs.  Even the early episodes, which I had previously 'remembered' as not being as strong as later seasons, are wonderful. A truly delightful series. I think the writing is every bit as sharp as NBC's American version of 'The Office', but perhaps a bit warmer and sweeter in tone.  The larger-than-life characters populating the Pawnee, Indiana Parks & Rec Department are played by a super-talented ensemble cast that makes every character hilarious and memorable, but also 'real', and all in different ways... not to mention the funny recurring characters that pop-up time and again throughout the show's run. Now, thanks to this nice box set I can revisit them whenever I want.  I don't think there are any 'extra' features in the box set that the stand-alone season-by-season releases don't have... but there are plenty of bonus features including loads of deleted scenes, commentaries, and some awesome gag reels.",1435190400,13,1168,4.825
