2423083,3,B000BKVLB6,"This is a hard review for me as when we ordered it we had been to H&H prior and had a great experience so we were jazzed to keep up with the place via the show. Unfortunately the show has now become the only thing that the shop is. We went back last week and were treated like s**t. True tattoo artists and those into the scene mock the show and now I understand why. There are some excellent shops in Vegas, H&H is now the cover band of tattooing. Most of the staff that you see isn't there anymore and now watching the show is like finding pictures of your old girlfriend who cheated on you. She's still cute but hard to look at, same with the video. If you like the show get this show, but DON'T go to the shop, it will sour you! Carey is great but his shop is not.",1141689600,11,768,3.9612903225806453
8088221,4,B000BKVLB6,The show itself is good but the dvd isn't very long.,1482883200,,52,3.8181818181818183
8088222,5,B000BKVLB6,"Great price!, wish A&E would come out with the complete seasons of Inked. Sipped fast, would buy again from this seller!",1480636800,,120,4.761904761904762
8088223,1,B000BKVLB6,"It's certainly not a bad show overall-- the premise itself is fairly promising---but it simply caters to a limited audience that I can't identify with. That's not the real issue here, though: even if you enjoy Inked and wouldn't mind having it on DVD, a ""best of"" collection is never a real substitute for actual season sets. Cast participation may have helped round out this release, but The Best of Season One is nothing more than a lazy effort that fans should ignore completely.",1391904000,,482,4.75
8088224,1,B000BKVLB6,Waste of money. I was hoping for more and it was just boring. Really don't want it anymore. But whatever.,1356825600,,105,4.3
8088225,1,B000BKVLB6,"The worst tattoo dvd I have ever watched. I made it through 4 episodes, barely. In what I watched there was very little art work being done. There was so so much drama  there was hardly any room for the tattoos. The show went from one problem to another and it shows the viewer how badly to run a business. If you are looking for pointers on how not to run a business than buy the dvd. But for me, I wanted to see the art of tattooing. I feel badly for H. and H. because the dvd shows just how badly their business is being run. Sorry.",1264982400,,535,3.9537037037037037
8088226,5,B000BKVLB6,"After going to Vegas and visiting the shop..i went and got the season on dvd and now I remember why I liked H&H to start with.

Great Great Show",1258243200,,144,3.9655172413793105
8088227,2,B000BKVLB6,I you can avoid to purchase this DVD you won't regret it. You can find another tv-series with the same type and even better.,1243209600,,124,4.208333333333333
8088228,4,B000BKVLB6,Didn't expect the bleeps but because it was an AE production I understand.  Great content though!,1234656000,,97,5.0625
8088229,4,B000BKVLB6,This was a great DVD. The only thing i didn't like about the DVD was that it wasen't the whole season...it's just a few of the best episodes.  Lots of Thomas and Dizzle on the Disc.,1155945600,3,181,4.027777777777778
8088230,2,B000BKVLB6,"Having stumbled across this title on Amazon and having a passing interest in Tattoos i thought i'd give this DVD set a shot. As a MTV style 'real world' take on life in a Tattoo parlour it succeeds but as a means to learn more about tattooing or it's history it doesn't.

You learn far too much about the personal lives of the staff working in the parlour than you do anything about tattooing which is dissapointing.",1153440000,6,416,4.402597402597403
