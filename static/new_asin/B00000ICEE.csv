1222022,2,B00000ICEE,"Another WWII Implausible Propaganda Film
""Eyes in the Night"" is another example of the power of WWII propaganda to freeze the brains of screenwriters. Adapted from a decent detective novel, the Nazi spy element was amped up to cash in on home front paranoia. Along with the better detective elements went most of the logic, suspense, and character motivation of the original story. In its place is a confused mess that even Director Fred Zinnemann (later to do ""High Noon"" and ""Here to Eternity"") could not salvage.

Along with simplistic motivation you will find a lot of stupid pet tricks as the blind detective's (Duncan Maclain played by Edward Arnold) seeing eye dog can open doors and obey vague fetch commands that confuse his step-and-fetch-it black servant (Mantan Moreland).

Set in the United States, Duncan's long-time friend Norma (Ann Harding) lives on a country estate with her new husband who for unknown reasons stores top secret scientific plans in his small unguarded wall safe. You know they are critical to the war effort because the spies say they are worth ten armored divisions. As the story unfolds it is slowly revealed that almost everyone is a Nazi spy; the entire household staff, a community theatre group, and a few guys of unknown origin. There are almost enough German personnel to fill up those ten armored divisions.

Although they enjoy a huge numerical advantage the spies conveniently wait around until Norma and her husband leave town to make their move on the safe.

A melodramatic back-story concerns Norma's relationship with her new stepdaughter and aspiring actress Barbara (Donna Reed). Barbara is supposed to be just 17 but Reed was in her early 20's and looked about 30. Harding (as always) is quite good and Reed not so good, the talent disparity gives their scenes together a farcical quality. These actually are bad enough to give the movie a certain camp appeal.

Zinnemann does infuse his production with a certain style. Playing off the blindness of his main character with frequent blackouts and generally understated lighting. There may never have been a feature film whose negative had less exposure to light than this one.

Arnold's performance is a bit over the top, apparently compensating for his character's blindness with aggressive flailing (imagine an extremely fat man replacing Patty Duke as Helen Kellor) and a loud voice.

Along with Harding, Katherine Emery (a stage actress in her film debut) gives a great understated performance as the leader of the huge band of Nazi's. She may remind ""Narnia"" viewers of the best performance in that film, Tilda Swinton's White Witch.

There are no extras on the DVD but it is a very good print.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1159833600,,2749,4.958695652173913
1222023,4,B00000ICEE,"This film will provide a good solid evening of entertainment. Yes, it is a Grade B detective film from the 40's, but it contains some distinctive, fun moments.  The detective (played by Edward Arnold) is blind and must employ his own set of tricks to nab the bad guys. His Dog FRIDAY is a hoot. This dog is brighter than most of the humans in the movie! It is worth the price of the film to watch this dog act! Donna Reed at her youngest, is one of the female actresses, she adds a bit of interest in her ""bad girl"" routine.

To sum it up, this is a film that provides a good entertainment. It certainly is different!",1141430400,10,617,4.176470588235294
1222024,5,B00000ICEE,"... in awards delivery, Friday should have got ""Best second role award"", because during the whole movie (until the very last shot) it was not like it was performing tricks, but like it was truly acting. It is really frustrating, especially when you see a di Caprio getting awards, since I still can't see his acting abilities, but only performing tricks (and not above average). I always esteemed Fred Zinnemann, and I'm glad I could at last see his first directed movie, which is not only an original one, but as well a very good one.",1113523200,,535,4.583333333333333
1222025,4,B00000ICEE,"Take the hard-boiled resourcefulness of a wrestling blind sleuth and his canny canine sidekick, stir in a stew of diverse supporting characters, and the result is the recipe for this wartime noir mystery.  Donna Reed is delicious as a precociously hard-edged seventeen-year-old, and Mantan Moreland and Allen Jenkins add just the right dash of comic relief.",1048377600,19,357,5.375
1222026,3,B00000ICEE,"""Eyes in the Night"" was director Fred Zinneman's first feature film after having, among other things, directed some MGM short subjects, notably some of their ""Crime Does Not Pay"" entries. Here he directed a tidy little thriller which is a little slow in getting started but builds tension and suspense as it goes along. The plot deals with a blind detective and his seeing-eye dog who become enmeshed with enemy agents. There is a quiet intelligence to this film which is noticeable in other early Zinneman efforts, particularly ""Kid Glove Killer"", another good MGM ""B"" not on home video and ""The Seventh Cross"". The villains are shrewd and resourceful not given to ""for the fatherland"" melodramatics of so many other films of this period. A solid first feature from a fine director.",984614400,9,783,4.9393939393939394

1222060,5,B00000ICEE,"This film has everything going for it.  The actors and acting are truly fine.  Edward Arnold is one of the ""greats"".  His portrayal of a blind detective is wonderful.  He handles all the tools available to the blind contemporary with the 1930s in the most authentically possible way.  See a very young Donna Reed as a teen rebel who happens to be precocious and classy.

The director captured the best of Arnold and Friday, his service dog.  By some accounts, this was most difficult for the director, and an experience he wasn't anxious to repeat.  Repeat it he did in The Hidden Eye.  I truly wish this were available on DVD.

Technical aspects: The DVD is a good reproduction of the original film.  The sound is good and clear, and all the dialogue can be understood.  Unlike today's products, background music and sound effects don't cover up the dialogue.  The picture is just as clear.  Good product!

Too bad that with cable TV and 50 jillion channels, there isn't anything as good as they made back in the 1930s.  There isn't a slow moment in this movie.  It's all quality with nary an F---  bomb dropped.",1347062400,3,1113,4.591836734693878

1222062,3,B00000ICEE,"Eyes in the Night, 1942 film

This movie begins with some men learning practical skills from Captain McClain. ""Its good to see you."" Norma has a problem with Paul Gerente, who is in love with her 17 year old daughter Barbara. Barbara did not tell her father Steve Lawry about Paul. When she visits Paul Barbara finds a body and her stepmother. Barbara makes a deal with Norma. Cynical? Norma talks to McClain about this situation. McClain visits Paul's place to investigate. A man returns the rug and makes a telephone call. McClain captures him. Back at the Lawry house we see what is going on: spies are trying to steal a secret! McClain asks about the servants, who are new. He acts cranky. Later Vera tries to contact him, but is stopped. Their job is bigger than one person. Does Friday have good instincts? Sodium amytal in the brandy?

Back at the theater we learn more about the plotters, and who is in command. This plot says a powerful force is behind it. A high-tech device is used to detect the combination to the safe. [They must not leave any indication that the safe was opened.] Organ music in the middle of the night? A drunken uncle? The events are heading for a crisis. The villains are not fooled by the drunk act. McClain demonstrates a card trick. Friday goes home. Lawry returns home. The gang demands the combination to the safe, or they will burn it open. Friday won't be distracted! McClain's gambit fails to work. A dark room evens the odds. Friday is a smart dog; he releases McClain's servants so they can notify the police. The house is surrounded, the police enter and capture the villains. They will be flown to Washington for questioning.

This 1942 film plays it cautiously in not referring to the power behind these spies (it must have been produced before December 1941). But this ambiguity makes it less dated. Having a blind man as a detective is an unusual plot device, but not a great one. It works better as a mystery novel [""Bats Fly at Dusk""]. The idea of a theatrical group being used as a front for espionage is clever, but not novel. John Wilkes Booth and Mata Hari were both entertainers.",1296172800,,2135,4.569190600522194
1222063,4,B00000ICEE,"Edward Arnold is most certainly the heaviest ""heavy"" and arguably the busiest (if most anonymous) bad guy in ""B"" pictures of the '30s and '40s.  Frank Capra went to him when he needed someone to personify a nemesis (no doubt Arnold could have easily played Mr. Potter in ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" though the part went to Lionel Barrymore; he did, however, score the villainous roles in Capra classics like ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" and ""Meet John Doe"").

The aforementioned Capra films are hardly ""B"" movies, but ""Eyes in the Night"" most certainly is.  What distinguishes it from other low-budget films of the day is the casting of non-box office attraction Arnold as the protagonist-good guy (if it helps, think of him as the William Conrad of his time).  He plays a private eye without eyes (he's blind but easily compensates for the inconvenience with an astute intellect and heightened remaining four senses plus a precocious guide dog named Friday).  Indeed, if there is a ""heavy"" (and I hope this isn't giving away too much) it's, incredibly enough, Donna Reed!

The film is a delight, playing games with the spectator (to begin with, we don't expect the familiar face of Edward Arnold to belong to the heroic ""good guy""; then it's only after we've spent extended minutes meeting his character that the director allows us to see that he's blind).  The plot is full of Agatha Christy-like suspense, surprises, plot reversals and, ultimately, a climactic drawing room scene in which the real murderer-conspirators are found out thanks to Arnold's heightened faculties and unerring deductions.  Arnold himself is as full of inventive crime-solving techniques, role-playing subterfuges and clever defenses as Nick Charles, Sam Spade and Charlie Chan put together.  Finally, the plot is as contrived and vertiginous as they come, with all of the apparently ""good"" people morphing into Nazis before our very eyes.  (This is where Capra, the director of the famous American propaganda series, ""Why We Fight,"" once again comes to mind: the plot of ""Eyes in the Night"" no doubt profited from the historical context of the war, which in fact helps us today to excuse twists and turns that would otherwise strike us as utterly preposterous if not hilarious.

Even though this film has recently been released in a second DVD edition, the sequel, ""The Hidden Eye,"" remains unavailable, as far as I'm aware.  Double is the pity: first, that this DVD edition doesn't include both films; 2nd, that ""Eyes in the Night"" could not trigger a whole string of sequels.",1294012800,3,2556,4.988235294117647
1222064,5,B00000ICEE,"Very entertaining film of a blind detective.  Alpha's DVD is quite good for this film, splice and logo free.  It would be nice to see the sequel ""The Hidden Eye"".",1267315200,,162,4.366666666666666
1222065,3,B00000ICEE,"This is a Thin Man movie with a dash of Val Lewton hastily thrown in. Not quite your typical film noir, but close to it. Nazi's? Donna Reed behaves like a Nazi, completely against type, even though she is unaware of all the real goings on. She treats her stepmother cruelly, and even accuses her of murder. (Cue the blind detective. Only at the end does she show any remorse. No wonder the characters were so brutal! Two murders, a hostage situation, and a German shepherd guide dog for a rescuer makes for a riot of a film. A little bit of slapstick is thrown in to make this MGM movie from 1942 funny. The print could have been better. Certain scenes are a little murky, inclunding the credits, on my new widescreen Toshiba television. The black and white is not as vibrantly displayed as on a Turner DVD, but for $7.98 or less, this is worth it, until Turner releases it, after which I would recommend an upgrade.

7910492,4,B00000ICEE,"This is a very enjoyable film, well worth watching. Edward Arnold is great as a fat blind man who is unable to see with his eyes at all but compensates by seeing better than others with his mind. A relatively lovely Donna Reed is also good as the daughter of a scientist who foolishly seems to fall for a bad man who is much older than her and who was once linked to her step mother who strongly advises her to drop the older man. The best actor in the show, however, is the seeing eye dog who understands English perfectly and obeys commands precisely and who is very protective of Arnold. The plot of this World War II-time film is that Donna's father has developed something that the Nazis want to take from him before he gives it to the Allies. A half dozen of them come to the scientist's house to steal the plans for the object. The step mother turns to the blind man to protect her and her family.",1503360000,,904,4.23121387283237
