Only the briefest outline of the meaning of the songs is shown in the sub-titles, that disappointed me because I understand the poetry used is very beautiful.  The instrumental music is strong and dramatic and some of it is familiar. There were two things I heartily enjoyed watching; one was the kind welcome given to an enemy and the other was giving a cup of water to that enemy. However I had to look away during parts of the film because I was afraid I would see a beheading acted out and didn't want to witness such a thing even on the screen, so I lost some of the action, and didn't really understand about the day long battle between the few and the many until I read the Goggle explanation. The play takes place in a beautiful building and it is shown well on the film. An incidental part of the drama is the figure of a strong woman sitting silently in the background behind her husband the director, I wanted to know so much about that woman, and she became one of the impressions I carried away from the play.",1193702400,2,1217,4.268398268398268
