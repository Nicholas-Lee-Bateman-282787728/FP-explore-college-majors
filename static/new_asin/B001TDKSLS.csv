3788825,4,B001TDKSLS,"had to order Season 1 because I came on late watching the show...it's a really fun show! you don't get enough of their music by watching the show only, so definitely order the CD with it....they really do rock!",1252800000,,210,4.410256410256411
3788826,5,B001TDKSLS,"I heard of these guys in the summer of 2008 with their song ""Isolate"" from Ain't It Beautiful. Then, I heard from my buddy they have a show on IFC, but I didn't have that channel. I waited for this to come out on DVD and I immediately bought this...watch it so many times...its funny...its very original...so many guest stars...make the show extra funny...I recommend this for a good laugh...ROCK ON ZO2..",1247875200,3,405,4.638888888888889
3788827,5,B001TDKSLS,"My wife and I caught these guys in Houston, Texas when they opened for KISS.  We thought they blew KISS off the stage and stole the whole show.  We became instant fans!!  I don't know why these  guys don't have a recording contract, but if you like to ""Rock"", check out their music.  I was thrilled to find these guys on TV,the show is hilarious.  Z02 Rocks as hard as another three man band from Texas with a ""Z""!!!",1245024000,3,416,4.2025316455696204
3788828,5,B001TDKSLS,"If you like This is Spinal Tap you will love this show.  The difference is this is a REAL band - ZO2 - and you should check out their CDs.  The show depicts their real life with a bit of improvising and lots of humor.  As any musician knows stardom and being discovered does not come easy.  There are many side-jobs just to pay the bills and there is a ton of schmoozing to make the right connections.

All of the guest stars hilariously play themselves and NYC is a character in itself much like it was on Sex and the City.

Jump on the ZO2 and Z Rock bandwagon or you'll be kicking yourself if you lose out on the fun and great music.",1244505600,4,636,4.048
3788829,5,B001TDKSLS,"What happens when a NYC rock band becomes more popular as a kids birthday band than what their real dream is?  Tune into Z Rock to find out :)

The show is hilarious with great guest appearances throughout the season.  Jay Oakerson (Neil) and Lynne Koplitz (Dina) are hilarious and the Zo2 guys shine through the whole season, bringing their sense of humor and passion for music to the forefront.

It needs to be noted too that David Z, Paulie Z and Joey do make up the real band - Zo2... and seeing them live will convert nearly everyone over to the Z Side.  As a fan of Zo2 for nearly 5 years (and Z Rock since the second I heard about it), I believe that anyone who gives the band a real chance will love them.  They are great guys and have amazing music.  I highly suggest anyone and everyone both watch Z Rock and check out their new CD ""Casino Logic""... I doubt you'll be disappointed!",1244505600,5,891,4.267857142857143
3788830,4,B001TDKSLS,"Z Rock is the story of three idiots who happen to be a rock band that everyone loves when they hear them play, yet they can't get a recording contract, partly because their manager isn't exactly Marilyn vos Savant either, but mostly because the 3 guys are so stupid about what they do. So, to pay the bills they play for children's parties, which they are hugely successful at, but they hate the very idea of doing it.

The character writing for this show is excellent, which is why I gave it such a high star rating despite the fact that the plot writing has as much contact with reality as a Betty Boop cartoon. Joan Rivers has a recurring role as herself, and she is hilarious. Dee Snider had a great part in one episode, and John Popper also has a major recurring role which shows the man must have a great sense of humor.

We don't get to hear more than snippets of the band playing, which is just as well because all the snippets sound the same anyway. And spare yourself the pain of thinking too much about what happens. This is just a comedy with some good characters, and it's fun to go along for the ride. Not a classic, but better than most of the rest of the shows currently on TV. The release of this DVD of the first season is timed to match the start of the second season, and I'll be watching.

[Edit: It occurs to me that I should make it clear that my use of the word ""idiots"" above refers to the characters portrayed in the comedy, and not the real-life band members. This clarification was prompted by something somebody said about this show representing ZO2's real life. Never for a moment did I consider anyone would take ""Z Rock"" to be anything more than a TV comedy.]",1244073600,3,1691,4.311320754716981
3788881,5,B001TDKSLS,"Absolutely hilarious, genius show. The first season is a little ""dirtier"" than the second. The writing is just SO fantastic and different. My personal favorite moments are the many containing the constant harassment of Paulie by Neil. The dialog between them will make you laugh & also cringe. I think season 2 may be my favorite, but the whole series is great. Believe it or not...the band actually rocks too.",1408406400,,410,4.871428571428571
3788882,5,B001TDKSLS,I was bummed when they cancelled this show but I was psyched to see it offered on DVD. Snatched up both seasons and have been laughing ever since!,1398729600,,146,4.25
3788883,5,B001TDKSLS,"This show is hilarious!  It's one of my favorites.  Shenanigans abound.  Hope they put Season 3 out on DVD.  Where do I sign that petition?  Seriously, what's the hold up?",1386201600,,171,4.566666666666666
3788884,4,B001TDKSLS,"HOT CHICKS, HOT CHICKS, HOT CHICKS, AND dirty hummor with good music and story line. IF you can imagine what the daily lives of a rock band are like, you wish you chose that as a career, Z-ROCK IS Hilarious, with guest appearances every show and some really chicks, its pretty tight.",1308441600,,283,4.461538461538462
3788885,5,B001TDKSLS,"Z02 is the whole package. They are funny, sexy, beautiful guys that can rock with best of them. Z-rock is a must  for any Z02 fan or anyone that loves good rock music. Language is a bit crude. Some nudity. I love this show & have given this season as gifts to friends who quickly became fans as well.",1298592000,,300,4.084745762711864
3788886,5,B001TDKSLS,"Just when you couldn't get enough of the cd's the Z guys come out with there own TV show. You can't ask for more than that. Well actually a cool Z radio station would be aweomse :) Season 1 of very fuuny with guests stars like Sebastian Bach, Joan Rivers, Dave Nevaro. ETC... Pick this up for when you get the 2nd season you are up to speed. 2nd season hopefully will be coming out soon. I know it's still in rotation on the IFC chan every Sun night at 11pm.",1269648000,,458,4.043956043956044
3788887,5,B001TDKSLS,"Outrageous,clever, and filled with fun facts about being in a band. Add in plenty of great character performances, cool music and guest stars willing to go over the top and you have a must see show. Who else but Paulie would shave a ""Z"" into his pubic hair and call it a promotional tool?",1262995200,2,288,4.351851851851852
3788888,4,B001TDKSLS,"This partly scripted comedy from IFC is reminiscent of other similarly designed shows such as 'Curb Your Enthusiasm'. Featuring handheld camera set-ups, a mockumentary style and plenty of guest stars, the show revolves around the group known alternately as ZO2 and Z Brothers, depending on whether they are playing in hard rock nightclubs or for children's birthday parties. What I find most appealing about the main characters is the juxtaposition of aspiring hard rock star with children's entertainers. The guys actually enjoy performing for children, just not as much as their rock shows. The lyrics for their children's songs straddle the line between sweet & innocent and risque double entendres (their birthday song is called 'Blow it Hard', meaning the candles supposedly). But the guys are not cynics merely cashing in an easy paycheck. The band's manager, Dina is perfectly played by (the BEAUTIFUL!) Lynne Koplitz as a hard-working, affectionate 'den mother' willing to do anthing (or anyone) to get her boys their big break. I myself am not that fond of the Neil character as I find his characterization to be somewhat scattershot and only occasionally funny. I'll also admit that it took a little while for this show to grow on me, but now, you couldn't pay me to miss an episode...",1260403200,,1295,5.05607476635514
3788889,5,B001TDKSLS,I stumbled upon this show by accident and found it to be hilarious.  These guys are something else and their manager is the best!  I love Joan Rivers in this series as she pokes fun at herself as well as others.  Z02 ROCKS!,1258329600,,223,4.1395348837209305

8341039,5,B001TDKSLS,"Pretty funny show. For those who aren't familiar with it, I would not recommend getting it for your kids as it has a lot of swearing and there is nudity in practically every episode.",1507075200,,182,4.382352941176471
8341040,5,B001TDKSLS,Loved this DVD! Reliving the old TV show and songs!!!! It was packaged perfectly and played well!! Thanks for bringing ZRock to DVD,1477440000,,131,4.739130434782608
8341041,1,B001TDKSLS,"Totally unwatchable.  Takes 3 decent guys (Paulie, Joey, and David) and makes them completely unlikeable.  Had to stop after 2 episodes ... there's an hour of my life I won't get back.  And I'm a huge fan of ZO2 AND the band members, which makes it more disappointing.  Did the kids in the episodes write the scripts too?  I won't be able to review Season 2 because I won't watch it.  My intelligence level can't take the hit. Much as I love the Z Brothers in real life, this show makes me want to slap the crap out of all 3 of them. Wish I had not wasted my money on this drivel.",1454284800,,580,4.088495575221239
8341042,5,B001TDKSLS,I bought this DVD thinking it was the complete first season instead I got episodes 7-10 of season one. I'd like to know where I could find the other disc or discs.,1443312000,,163,4.125
8341043,5,B001TDKSLS,Hilarious show; sad it only lasted 2 seasons but that doesn't stop me from watching them over and over again,1436486400,,108,4.45
