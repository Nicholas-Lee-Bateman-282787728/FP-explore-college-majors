In Kung Fu Arts a woman marries a monkey. A real, living one.

Seriously, that's the level of the films in this set. It's not Master Killer-ish, there's very few that are even decent action films, but the level of goofiness is through the *roof*. Master Ninja? Oh yea! Ninja Death? Bring it on!",1156032000,11,357,4.313432835820896

2211395,3,B0007DBJUU,"Some of these films are old classics you would see on saturday afternoon kung-fu theature back in the 1980's but most of them are just low budget old films that were never very popular. For example, the Bruce Lee movie called ""Bruce Lee The Invincible"" is actualy a spoof of Kung-Fu alltogether and although it makes a few refernces to Bruce and shows a few pictures of him its acutaly a VERY LAME spoof of the arts and I found it to be of very bad taste and not entertaining at all. Not all of them are about Martial arts either, some of them are detective or police related but I warn you, they are low budget made in Hong Kong movies. There are a few with Ron Van CLeef and they are okay. The best one of course is the actual movie with Bruce Lee ""Fist of fear, touch of death"".",1136160000,5,781,4.144736842105263

2211397,3,B0007DBJUU,"It really deserves a 3.5...  It's no surprise that most of the movies on this set are extremely bad.  There's also a set two (Iron Fist Frenzy 50 Movie set) which is also pretty mediocre.  However!  Having said that, there are a few really good movies on here.  If you want true 'kung fu', you'll want to skip through the blaxploitation action films that have no real martial arts in them.  The highest IMDB rated film on this list is The Impossible Kid, a movie from the Philippines featuring Weng Weng, a famous midget martial artist.  It has an 8.1 rating on IMDB, but don't let that fool you.  It's so laughable that it looks like something on Tim & Eric's Awesome Show....  I know that people on these reviews are touting Ninja Death as the funniest 'terrible movie', but I raise them The Impossible Kid.  Hilariously bad.  Anyway, I also realize that most people on these reviews are jumping on the Shadow Ninja and saying it's the best movie on here.  It's okay.... Which is good for this set!  But I would argue that Heroes of Shaolin Parts 1 and 2 are by FAR the best movies in this set.  Choreography is actually terrific in this two-parter, because the fight choreographer was none other than Yuen Biao!!!!  He also plays a very minor role in the film - Lo Lieh capably handling the main role.  Most of the other films are terrible, as suspected - but the Heroes of Shaolin parts 1 and 2 are worth the 8 bucks!",1452297600,2,1421,4.407692307692308
2211398,3,B0007DBJUU,"Lots of low budget cheese amongst 50 movies in a pack like this, but there are some gems in it as well. Stunned when I saw a very young Dabney Colman in one of the blaxploitaions ones.",1450137600,,184,4.0

2211401,3,B0007DBJUU,"I've watched around 15 of the 50 to this point and it's a tough set to rate.  A couple of movies are hidden gems and the cost per movie is so cheap, so maybe 5 stars?  Problem is, most are garbage and are not martial arts movies.  I expected garbage, but I expected fun garbage martial arts movies.  Not garbage 1970s semi-action movies.  The cost is only cheap if you don't value your time.  Have the fast forward controller ready and waiting.

That said, they're all ""real"" movies with at least decent production values.  A couple have very good production values and really nice sets (a pair of fantasy martial arts movies on disk 5).  The film quality is ""OK,"" which hurts as for some reason, there's a ton of night fighting scenes that are really difficult to see.

One interesting note - in the actual Asian martial arts movies, all of the bit actors have incredibly bad teeth versus the stars that have perfect teeth.  Not something I usually look at, but talk about contrast!  Says something about the state of those countries in the 70s.",1440892800,,1046,4.53475935828877

Hey! This is before they had dolby, hi-fi and all that! I assume most of the negative reviews come from younger folks who were raised on HD TV! I haven't had any problem listening or watching any of these movies! Sure there are a few places where there might have been a film splice, or the sound may be less than 2015 standards, but it's nothing that's really going to bother anyone except for the spoiled younger generation!

2211416,5,B0007DBJUU,"Having just recently finished all the films on this set, I can say it was actually better than I had expected. There is more than just Kung Fu films on this set. For example the Black Cobra trilogy on this set seems like it got a lot of inspiration from Dirty Harry and Rambo. Films like TNT Jackson and Jive Turkey add to this set by making it feel more like a Grindhouse collection, than an exclusively Kung Fu collection. But if you are looking for completely violent and bloody Kung Fu mayhem, look no further than the Ninja Death trilogy. All 3 films play out like a bloody exploitation epic.

This set is not for people looking for a good clean fun starring Jackie Chan. These films are drive-in exploitation cinema at its best!",1419206400,,734,4.437037037037037

2211435,3,B0007DBJUU,"Mill Creek has become the king of public domain movies. They've done well in getting us movie lovers to buy their different movie box sets by packaging them so the cost versus the amount of material your getting becomes irresistible. I've never been much of a fan of kung-fu movies, or martial arts films, but when Mill Creek decided to put out fifty martial arts films in a box set for fifteen dollars, it was impossible to resist. If I ended up liking even one movie on the set, the price would be worth it. Well, I found some that I liked, some that were so bad they were good, and some that were just embarrassingly bad all around. But needless to say, I have enough martial arts films in my collection now to last me quite some time. So let's take a look at each film in this fifty pack and see what there is for you to enjoy.

Note: All films in this set are in color, so I won't be putting that in the individual synopsis.

And there is another fifty films from Mill Creek Entertainment to feast on. This set had definite good and bad points for me. On the good side, even though a lot of the films audio and video were ""fair"", there was not one movie that was so bad that I could not watch it, unlike several of the other sets. The gripe may be a personal one, but it got under my skin that a couple of the trilogies were on separate discs, or were out of order (i.e. part two, three, and then one). Like I said, maybe it's a personal thing, but all the prints are right there, put them in the right order! Anyway, as I said in the beginning, this will satisfy my martial arts cravings for some time to come, and people should pick this up for some fun, action and unintentional laughs. 6/10.",1366934400,12,29443,4.894905736060971

2211439,1,B0007DBJUU,"I grew up watching great epic Kung Fu(late 80s & 90s, to current) shows & films and also the not so great ones; but, I thought I'd give this collection (of old films) a shot. Some of them are tolerable; some are good; but most are crap with horrible writers and cinematography. As an Asian woman, who's watched a variety of Asian films, I understand the cultural differences in the acting styles between American and Asian acting ""norms""; but I've only gotten through a few of the DVDs (out of 12 total) and I don't think I can continue watching anymore!

I skipped around through the first few DVDs, but I was so offended by the graphic RAPE scene and why it needed to be in the film at all that I just stopped watching it all together. In ""Ninja Wars"", a couple chapters into the movie, a group of men capture a young virgin to collect her tears for a `love potion' but end up RAPING and beating her, just to force her into crying... so that they can collect her tears. By raping her, wouldn't that spoil the essence of her virginity; therefore, making the tears useless in the potion? Nonsensical plot!

I think that I might have given it another try and finish watching it if there was any hint of a plot worth watching, but there never seem to be much logic in keeping with the standards of a decent film. If I wanted to watch porn, I would have gotten it rather than watch a deformed monster raping a young woman. I suppose the rating didn't bother me so much as the lack of effort in capturing the awesomeness (that IS) Kung Fu with it's morality check that it should instill!

Maybe I'm just babbling on, but I thought that I should inform other potential buyers of what trashy films might be mixed in with this collection of movies.",1339286400,8,1741,4.367283950617284

2211443,4,B0007DBJUU,"As other reviewers and commenters have mentioned, there have been a few changes in the lineup. The new movies, from what I can tell, are:

(2.7) The Guy From Harlem ( 86 min - Action | Drama - September 1977 (USA))- Saw this on the 50 Drive-In Classics set. Unintentionally hilarious, but cool. Enjoyed it much more than the rating would indicate.
(3.7) Day of the Panther (84 min - Action) - I also saw this one on the 50 Drive-In Classics set. For me it was only OK, so it's a let down to lose some of the Sonny Chiba movies for this (must have been licensing issues).
(4.1) Jive Turkey (86 min - Action - November 1974 (USA)) - Yet another one from the 50 Drive-In Classics set. This one was fun to watch either way.
(5.6) Ninja Wars (100 min - Action | Adventure | Fantasy - 18 December 1982 (Japan))- I believe this one was renamed from ""Death Of A Ninja""
(6.5) Legend of the Eight Samurai (133 min - Adventure | Fantasy | Action - 10 December 1983 (Japan)) - new for this set

These are no longer in the new lineup:

(5.6) Death Of A Ninja (""Black Magic Wars"") (Japan-1982) - Hiroyuki Sanada/Sonny Chiba (in support) - (Renamed in the set as ""Ninja Wars"")
(5.7) Sister Street Fighter (Japan-1974) - Hiroshi Miyauchi/Sanae Ohba
(6.1) Return Of The Street Fighter (Japan-1974) - Sonny Chiba/Yko Ichiji
(6.9) The Street Fighter (Japan-1974) - Sonny Chiba/Waichi Yamada

Also, I was able to find a rating for Ninja Heat after some searching. It turns out that the movie also goes by Black List (or Ninja Black List), and it's got a pretty good rating at this moment:

(7.4) Ninja Heat (1988) - Chan Sheng/Chan Wai Mang

All in all, I think this set looks pretty good. I have already sampled some of the cheesy Godfrey Ho/Richard Harrison Ninja movies, which while cheesy fun, also have some good coreography. A person could definitely do worse than this set.",1331424000,5,1860,4.488165680473373

IM GOING TO NAME SOME OF THE FILMS I REALLY ENJOYED BECAUSE THE ACTION AND THE PLOTS IN THESE MOVIES ARE VERY ENTERTAINING.

(BLACK FIST) ITS ABOUT THIS GUY GETS RECRUITED BY THIS UNGROUND FIGHT CERCUIT AND DECIDES TO TAKE HIM ON HIS OFFER TO STREET FIGHT AND HE MAKES ALOT OF MONEY. THIS COP STARTS COMING AROUND AND WANTS A LITTLE PIECE OF THE PIE SO LIKE ALL CROOKED COPS DO THEY BLACK MAIL.

SO THE GUY STREET FIGHTS LONG ENOUGH JUST TO MAKE WHAT HE NEEDS THEN GET OUT OF THE STREET FIGHTING GAME. THE GUY IN CHARGE OF THE STREET FIGHTING CERCUIT DON'T WANT TO LET HIM GO THAT EASY, SO WHAT HE DOES IS HURT HIS FAMILY AND FRIENDS, SO I JUST WANT TO SAY REVENGE IS A DISH BEST SERVED COLD & I HAVE TO SAY THIS BROTHA IS COLD.... CHECK IT OUT FOR YOURSELF IT IS REALLY A GREAT MOVIE TO WATCH.

ANOTHER ONE OF MY FAVORITES IS (BREAKOUT FROM OPPRESSION) WOW!!! THIS MOVIE IS SO SWEET. THIS WOMAN GET OUT OF PRISON FOR A FRESH START ON HER NEW LIFE, BUT HER PAST KEEPS HAUNTING HER. SHE WAS FRAMED FOR KILLING HER BOYFRIEND, SO THE STORY GOES LIKE THIS. SHE GETS OUT OF PRISON AND SHE HAS THIS NEW JOB AND THIS GIRL AT HER JOB KEEP HARASSING HER FOR NO REASON AT ALL.

STRANGE THINGS ARE HAPPENING AT HER HOUSE, THERE IS THIS ONE SCENE WHERE SHE IS TAKING A SHOWER AND SHE GETS CUT, IT TURNS OUT SOMEONE PUT A RAZOR BLADE IN HER SOAP. THE SAME THING HAPPEND WHEN SHE WAS IN PRISON, TRIPPY HUH? WELL THERE IS A TWIST TO THIS WHOLE MOVIE. THE WHOLE REASON WHY SHE WENT TO PRISON IN THE FIRST PLACE IS BECAUSE THE GUY SHE WAS DATING, TURNS OUT HE ALREADY HAD A GIRLFRIEND SO THAT MAKES HIM A CHEATER.

TURNS OUT THE OTHER WOMAN IS A PSYCHO AND SHE THE ONE WHO ACCTUALLY KILLED HIM AND NOT THE OTHER WOMAN THAT WAS FRAMED... THE SOUNDTRACK IN THIS MOVIE IS SO KOOL, IF YOU EVER SEEN THAT MOVIE THE FIRESTARTER WITH DREW BARRYMORE MY SECCOND FAVORITE ANGEL THE THEME SONG TO THAT MOVIE IN THE OPENING CREDITS IS IN THIS FILM.

All I can say is that it's absolute genius!

2211453,5,B0007DBJUU,"First thing i'd like to point out is that the listing that amazon shows for this (as far as the movies go) is incorrect. The listing as amazon puts it is the same as the original release (which is NOT to be confused with the new version, of which the picture is shown) with the exception of ""TNT jackson"". Instead of ""TNT jackson"" you get Fist of Fear, Touch of death.

Now since amazon is listing the picture for the re-release of this box set, im going to assume that's the version they are selling. It should be noted that along with ""TNT jackson"", you get four other movies which are:

Breakout from oppression
Day of the Panther
Jive Turkey
The Guy from harlem

the movies they replace are the aformentioned ""Fist of fear, touch of death"" along with

Death Machines
Death of a ninja
Sister Street Fighter
Ten Fingers of death (which to Morgoth, is the Jackie chan movie Master with cracked fingers under an alternate title)

Also the movie with chow yun fat in it is entitled ""the Head hunter"".

The easiest way to tell the difference is that the original (and it should be noted BETTER) version has a non-descript guy on the cover as opposed to bruce lee.

Now that thats out of the way, I can get on to the other thing i wanted to mention.

I'd like to thank morgoth for pointing out Shadow Ninja. I have had this movie pack since at least the time when it first came out, and never bothered to check out that movie until i read his review of this pack last night. When I got home i popped the movie in and was thoroughly entertained. So thank you.

Now on to the actual reivew of the pack itself....

due to the fact that i have seen little if any of the movies featured all the way through, i shall end this review by giving a list of the more noteworthy movies to look out for on this pack.

The aformentioned Shadow Ninja (which should definitly be the first movie to watch as soon as you get this.)
Tiger Love
Kung Fu arts
Chase Step by Step
Deadly Duo AKA Two Great Cavaliers (which is not to be confused with the Ti Lung epic of the same name)
Fighting Mad
The Master: Max and out of time step (which are actually episodes of a tv series)
The heroes of Shaolin 1 and 2
The impossible kid (a martial arts movie featuring A MIDGET! has to be seen to be believed!)
The street fighter, Return of the street fighter (a duo of great movies featuring samurai master sonny chiba)
Ten fingers of death AKA Master with cracked fingers (possibly jackie chan's first starring role and a great movie)
Snake Fist Dynamo (mentioning it only to say look for the brooklyn zu version called dragon snake fist thats uncut)

The movies are cropped so that you only see the middle of the screen, but they didn't go to the trouble to pan the view so that you see the action, so lots of action happens off screen. Also, some of the movies are dark, hard to see, grainy, and just generally poor quality. I guess you get what you pay for in some respects.

The best ones are ""The Street Fighter"" (Sonny Chiba), ""Return of the Street Fighter"" (Sonny Chiba) and ""Shaolin Deadly Kicks"" (Dorian Tan), though I haven't seen the last two discs yet. The bad ones will either make you fall asleep or keep you laughing at how cheesy it is. There are a few non-martial arts films which may be a good or bad thing. All the movies are full screen with VHS quality video and English dubbing. The menu is really basic with just play and scene selections, but that's to be expected. There are no Millcreek logos that pop up from what I hear about the other boxsets.

There are actually two versions of this boxset. The old one was released in 2005 and features a generic guy on the cover. The newer one was released in 2007 and has Bruce Lee on the cover (though there aren't any actual Bruce Lee movies in it). They have 45 of the same movies and have 5 different ones each.

The 45 they share are:

The Big Fight (Roc Tien)
Black Cobra (Fred Williamson)
Black Cobra II (Fred Williamson)
Black Cobra III (Fred Williamson)
Black Fist (Richard Lawson)
The Black Godfather (Rod Perry)
The Brave Lion (Wei Tzi Yung)
Chase Step by Step (Chee Kung)
City Ninja (Michael Chan)
Deadly Duo (David Chiang)
Fighting Mad (Leon Isaac Kennedy)
Four Robbers (Shek Hon)
The Four Shaolin Challengers (Bruce Leung)
The Guy with the Secret Kung Fu (Meng Fei)
Hands of Death (Roc Tien)
The Headhunter (Chow Yun Fat)
Heroes of Shaolin - Part 1 (Chen Xing)
Heroes of Shaolin - Part 2 (Chen Xing)
Image of Bruce Lee (Bruce Li)
The Impossible Kid (Weng-Weng)
Infernal Street (Yiu Tin-Lung)
Karate Kids U.S.A. (Charles Lane)
Kung Fu Arts (Carter Wong)
Kung Fu Kids Break Away (Wan Ye Leung)
The Master: Max (Lee Van Cleef)
The Master: Out-of-Time-Step (Lee Van Cleef)
Ninja Champion (Bruce Baron)
Ninja Death I (Lo Yiu)
Ninja Death II (Lo Yiu)
Ninja Death III (Lo Yiu)
Ninja Empire (Mike Abbott)
Ninja Heat (Chan Sheng)
Ninja: The Protector (Richard Harrison)
The Real Bruce Lee (Bruce Lee)
Return of the Kung Fu Dragon (Sing Chen)
Return of the Street Fighter (Sonny Chiba)
Shadow Ninja (Steve Tung Wai)
Shaolin Deadly Kicks (Dorian Tan)
Shaolin Temple (Shu Feng)
Snake Fist Dynamo (Eric Yee)
The Snake, The Tiger, The Crane (Carter Wong)
Spirits of Bruce Lee (Michael Chan)
The Street Fighter (Sonny Chiba)
Tiger Love (Hu Chin)
Weapons of Death (Eric Lee)

The old version has:

Death Machines (Ron Marchini)
Death of a Ninja (Sonny Chiba)
Fist of Fear, Touch of Death (Bruce Lee)
Sister Street Fighter (Sonny Chiba)
Ten Fingers of Death (Jackie Chan)

While the new version has:

Breakout From Oppression (Lona Chang)
Day of the Panther (Edward John Stazak)
The Guy From Harlem (Loye Hawkins)
Jive Turkey (Paul Harris)
TNT Jackson (Jeanne Bell)

Note that all five movies of the new version are also in the Drive-In Movie Classics 50 Pack:

If you buy directly from Amazon you will get the new version.

If you like this boxset you should get the Martial Arts 20 Movie Pack, also by Millcreek. It has 18 movies that aren't on this boxset and comes in a more durable plastic case:

It's a good deal for getting lots of movies cheaply. This set got me into buying the Martial Arts 20 Pack and the Horror 250 Pack from Millcreek. I just wish they would combine all their martial arts packs, add some more and make a big 250 pack. Speaking of the 250 packs, you should get them while you still can because Millcreek said they are discontinued. They also said there will be more movie packs coming out in January 2009.",1227225600,11,3995,4.930059523809524

2211465,3,B0007DBJUU,"CONTENTS of BORN IN HELL 4 Movie Pack:

THE DEMON-- A string of motiveless and gruesome murders by a person unknown adds to the terror of potential victims targeted for the kill.
.
FRANKENSTEIN'S GREAT AUNT TILLIE-- The mad doctor's descendent searches for hidden treasure in the family castle with his 130-year-old female relative. Instead, they find and revive the monster. Donald Pleasence gives one of his worst-ever performances and Zsa Zsa Gabor's cameo adds nothing to this mirthless comedy.

MACHINE HEAD-- Best of the bunch! For a science project, a nerdy high schooler plants a lawnmower engine atop a stolen corpse and brings his unlikely creation to life. This one's rapidly becoming a camp classic.

UNHOLY TERROR-- Sinister variation of Roger Corman's ""A Bucket of Blood"" doesn't have the panache of the original. Here, a sculptor is possessed by an artistic evil spirit that forces him to kill his models and use their bodies for sculptures.

BRENTWOOD's 4-fers are nicely priced movie bundles. Video and sound quality of these digitally unrestored public domain films is generally fine. Discs are dual-side recorded.

2211466,3,B0007DBJUU,"Even though many of these movies were filmed in the 80's, the film quality is terrible (like from the early 60's in the US). You have to really be a martial arts fanatic to make it through very many of these movies. However, if you are a martial arts fanatic then read on. Many of the stories are of quaint old China before industrialization and have interesting and old fashioned cultural mores and situations that martial artists find themselves in. One of them would have been X rated if it was produced in this country for US audiences because of the naked women. Can't remember the name of that one, you will have to watch them all to find it!!!!

2211471,3,B0007DBJUU,"Some of the titles in MARTIAL ARTS 50 MOVIE PACK are so obscure, very little information could be gotten about them. A couple of selections here are from a long-forgotten American TV series. There's even a few spaghetti-karate films thrown into the mix. The majority however originate in the Far East: Hong Kong, Japan, Taiwan and the Philippines.

Lots of choreography went into the making of these movies; undoubtedly, there were a few unintentional injuries along the way, too. The action and pratfalls are non-stop and the plots mere window dressing for the foot-to-head combat scenes. For all martial arts fans these cinematic slugfests are sure-to-please.

Overall rating was achieved by averaging out viewer polling on 42 of these titles. Based on a film resource website's 1 to 10 scoring system, the current rating for MARTIAL ARTS is: 4.8.

2211472,5,B0007DBJUU,"This collection is well worth every penny you'll spend on it, as long you enjoy this film genre.  Personally, these movies evoke more laughter for me than most of the comedies being currently released.  Some of the movies don't really qualify as martial arts movies - in particular, I'm referring to Black Cobra 1, 2, and 3 - three of the worst movies ever made.  These movies, starring former NFL player Fred ""The Hammer"" Williamson would more appropriately be categorized as action movies, although there isn't a Hell of a lot of action in them.  I digress.  The point is that there are maybe 3 punches thrown in the entire first movie.  It's definitely not a martial arts movie.  Most of the movies in this collection, however, are exactly what you would expect.  In particular, there are three movies, Ninja Death 1, 2, and 3 that are so awful that they border on greatness.  I'm not a film student, so I couldn't tell you what the filming technique is called wherein the ""actors"" fight in slow-motion, and then the film is sped up to make the fights look like they are taking place at a normal speed.  The director of these Ninja Death movies sped the fights up too much, and the result is that every battle looks like an episode of the Benny Hill show.  I put these kind of crappy movies on at night to fall asleep to (spaghetti westerns and cheesy horror flicks work well also), but Ninja Death kept me awake and laughing.  None of the movies in this collection are big budget - they are all old, and the sound and picture quality is poor, but that adds, not detracts, to the experience of watching them.  If you ""get"" these kinds of films, you absolutely can't go wrong spending the money on this collection.",1171584000,80,1716,4.514563106796117

My only real gripe is there wasn't enough of the ""Shaolin"" style films...oh well.

Now not to say that ALL are bad, as there are actually a few really good ones too.
