7922792,2,B00004TJU5,"I was rather disappointed in this DVD. I was really looking for a collection mostly of sketches from ""Your Show Of Shows"" and was dismayed to find that even the old VHS ""Ten From Your Show Of Shows"" has not be transferred. These DVDs are not worth the exceptionally high price-tag and I really wish someone would publish an actual set of the existing remains of both ""Your Show Of Shows"" and ""The Sid Caesar Show"". In short, I want to see the sketches (and more of them) as a main attraction with the interviews as extras.",1445558400,3,522,4.391752577319588
7922793,2,B00004TJU5,"I am fully aware of Sid Caesar's reputation and the history of the Show of Shows, however the sketches on this DVD tended to be overly long by current standards, very wordy and I tended not to find them funny.  The images are good and the sound fine.  There is some introductory material by those involved with the show.",1391299200,,320,4.406779661016949

7922797,5,B00004TJU5,"Watching this collection is a revelation.  This is ""live"" television from nearly fifty years ago and it is still falling-down funny.  The word ""genius"" is overused but it certainly applies to the men and women who created these classics of sketch comedy: Carl Reiner, Mel Brooks, Larry Gelbart, Mel Tolkin, Neal and Danny Simon, Woody Allen, Imogene Coca, Nanette Fabray, Howard Morris, and, especially, Sid Caesar.  The great thing about this collection is that, unlike other compilations which feature only excerpts, all of the sketches here are presented in their entirety.  All of the classics are here: ""The Clock,"" ""This is Your Story,"" the ""From Here to Eternity"" spoof and many others.  If you really feel like having a good time, this is the place to be!",998438400,25,763,4.9763779527559056
7922798,5,B00004TJU5,"Sid Caesar was the most talented comic performer of the live television era with his classic ""Your Show of Shows"" and ""Caesar's Hour.""  Caesar also had the greatest ensemble cast of all time with the late Imogene Coca, Carl Reiner, Howard Morris, and others.  Add to that a writing staff that included, at various times, Reiner, Mel Brooks, Woody Allen, Neil Simon and Larry Gelbart.  The volumes in this DVD collection include some of the best comedy sketches from both shows, digitally remastered from the original kinescopes.  Caesar picked the sketches personally and interviews with the cast members and writers are used as introductions.  Sketches included on this first volume, ""The Magic of Live TV,"" includes ""The Commuters in '7 Dwarfs Bet,'"" ""The Professor in 'Board Rooms of hollywood,'"" ""The Five Dollar Date,"" ""Sid Plays Sax with Benny Goodman,"" ""The Clock,"" ""A Fella Needs a Girl,"" ""The Haircuts--'So Rare' and 'Flippin','"" and my favorite, ""This Is Your Story.""  Thank goodness these priceless shows have been preserved.  They deserve to be as well known as episodes of ""I Love Lucy"" and ""The Honeymooners.""",997920000,7,1123,5.137362637362638
