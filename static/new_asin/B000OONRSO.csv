8325571,3,B000OONRSO,"I was looking for an instructional video that walks you through the steps of QiGong.
The demonstration portion was very limited.",1373068800,7,128,5.142857142857143
8325572,1,B000OONRSO,"This dvd is only 30 minutes, not 60.  It offers very little actual instruction, being mostly just description and almost advertising-like
recommendation of the practice.  The four demonstrations are incomplete and even cut short in places; none are over a minute or two.
And bits of the video, while he is talking, are actually repetitions of previous bits.  Very disappointing and certainly not worth the price.
Terry Dunn dvds are much better,  nicely produced and explained thoroughly.  Francesco Garripoli's also contain well-done full qigong forms.
This dvd is not even in the same category, and certainly not 'essential.'",1279324800,15,627,5.357142857142857
8325573,2,B000OONRSO,"This is not a course to take if you are new to qi gong. He doesn't even mention posture, alignment or breathing. Then at the end of the DVD, it is mentioned that I can buy another DVD for more...more of what? He has better books that I thought were great. However, I wouldn't recommend this DVD to anyone unless they wanted JUST a demo. Try Terrence Dunn or Jiang Jian-ye and many others to learn something. this DVD is advertized as a demonstrational-instructional video so they should call it just a demo or sell it for half price. thanks.
