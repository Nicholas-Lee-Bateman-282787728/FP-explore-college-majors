7937536,2,B00005BGQR,"You know, I have to give Jalal Merhi credit where it's due: regardless of how bad his movies turned out, you can tell that he was at least trying to make martial arts action more compelling than basic storylines allowed. However, the fact that ""Expect to Die"" was actually marketed as something in the same vein as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Matrix/dp/B000P0J0AQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Matrix</a>&nbsp;is bold bordering on insolence (in truth, ""Expect to Die"" was filmed first but not released until after ""Matrix""). Severely outdated computer graphics combine with an underutilized cast and disappointing action content make for yet another example of how mediocre a filmmaker Merhi was at this stage in his career.

The story: detectives Blake (Merhi) and Stone (Evan Lurie,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Martial-Law-II-Undercover/dp/6302468035/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Martial Law II: Undercover</a>) attempt to track down a psychopathic virtual reality developer (David Bradley,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/American-Ninja-4-The-Annihilation/dp/B000AYEL38/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">American Ninja 4 - The Annihilation</a>) exposing kidnapped human subjects to his deadly combat simulator.

Again, I must give credit where it's due: Merhi had previously explored VR-themed plotlines in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Expect-No-Mercy/dp/B00030WW58/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Expect No Mercy</a>, and in comparison, ""Expect to Die"" makes considerably greater use of the idea, with the characters moving through entire virtual worlds to do battle with tangible consequences to their performances. With that said, this movie's decrepit special effects can't hold a candle to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tron/dp/B004KPLVV8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tron</a>, much less ""The Matrix."" The money required for the green-screening sapped the rest of the production values, so the movie in general looks slightly cheaper than Merhi's other fare. Dramatically, there's at least one surprise: though Merhi lives up to his usual unenthusiastic average and Evan Lurie has surprisingly few lines (then again, he's not much of a character to begin with), David Bradley's performance as the villain was a considerable leap from his usual style of the wise-cracking hero type. His performance wasn't award-winning, but I'll admit that during his first scene in the film, I didn't realize that it was him - that's how differently he presents himself.

Apparently another way he's moved away from his norm is by having his character not be a martial artist, leading to two disappointingly sloppy brawls with Jalal late in the film. The action content as a whole is lackluster: the gunfights are drawn-out and uninventive, and the VR setting where most of the hand-to-hand fights take place apparently necessitated uninvolving camera angles, leading to roundly boring brawls. The lone good fight takes place in the second half of the movie, wherein Evan Lurie takes on a gang of kidnappers in an alley: though this is juxtaposed alongside a more lackluster scuffle involving Merhi by a fruit stand, it shows off with passable results how smooth of a physical performer Lurie could be. [SPOILER] It's a shame his character is promptly killed off, afterwards.

The movie also indirectly advertises the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Expect-No-Mercy/dp/B005D2QHIE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Expect No Mercy</a>&nbsp;video game based on the aforementioned movie, and it's pretty funny how excited the wife of Merhi's character gets about such an awful-looking game. The entire film looks similarly awful, and its content doesn't make much of a case against this. It doesn't surprise me that Evan Lurie promptly ceased working with Merhi subsequently, but the fact that David Bradley made&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/one-more-picture/dp/B000059ZTK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">one more picture</a>&nbsp;with him after this debacle makes him a very brave man indeed. Stay away, folks.",1340409600,,4294,6.773550724637682
