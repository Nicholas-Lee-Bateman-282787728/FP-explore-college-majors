2117336,4,B0002S648M,"I first enjoyed Tales in the late 70's and early 80's.  After years of searching I found the recently released DVD version.  Admitedly, the shows are dated (anyone seen Man From U.N.C.L.E. lately?) but like the aforemention, it is still fun to watch.  The Roald Dahl intros are great and the Tales leave you hanging to the end.
For those of you who intrigued by the title, this is not a Twilight Zone or Outer Limits style show.  It is a normal storyline with an ""Unexpected"" twist at the end.
If you don't want to take a chance, go by Dahl's short story book by the same name.",1186704000,,577,4.314814814814815
2117337,4,B0002S648M,"If you are a fan of Night Gallery or Alfred Hitchcock Presents, you will enjoy this macabre set of interesting tales of the unusual and the supernatural.  Dahl is a master storyteller, however some stories are indeed better than the others. ""Man from the South"" with Jose Ferrer and Steve Guttenberg is a gem and, of course, ""Lamb to the Slaughter"" with Susan George and ""Neck"" starring a pre-Dynasty Joan Collins (who personifies the classic ""bitch"" in every role she ever undertook) are superb. With a warning to all of us who make foolhardy bets and cheat at them, ""Taste"" is a lesson in humility and clearly one of the strongest of the episodes. ""The Orderly World of Mr. Appleby"" is a warning to all unmarried fortune seekers laden with satire and humor.  A good set throughout.",1151798400,13,783,4.708029197080292
2117338,1,B0002S648M,I bought this in good faith expecting classic Roald Dahl tales like the BFG and the one where that boy poisons his gran. This was not what I anticipated at all.,1148688000,2,160,4.193548387096774

i liked the episodes, but for people who aren't fans of the show, and are just passersby, i'd keep passing...

the premises are boring at points, definitely not something you'd want to push out to the english, which have a total of 4 channels...

keep on going...",1123113600,4,319,4.56140350877193
2117340,5,B0002S648M,"I remember watching these, as a high school student, syndicated in North Carolina back in 1979 or the early 1980's and really enjoying them.  I've always wanted to see more of these and re-watch the few I did catch way back then.  The stories were quite worthy of the Alfred Hitchcock tradition and are better than the later ""new"" ""Hitchcock"" series that premiered in 1985.  The ""snake-in-the-bed"" episode was the most suspenseful television show I've ever seen and even scarier than the classic black & white Hitchcock episode.  Just when you thought it was safe to crawl under the covers...",1096848000,16,592,4.89
2117341,5,B0002S648M,"Here is a boxed set of four DVDs that is a real treat. Back in 1979 and 1980, British television watchers were treated to an anthology show called ""Tales of the Unexpected."" It was hosted by writer Roald Dahl and featured some of Britain's top stars in 25-minute tales with twist endings, very much in the tradition of ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" and ""The Twilight Zone."" Indeed, one or two of these stories were also shown on the Hitchcock series.

 Now Acorn Media has released ""Tales of the Unexpected, Set 1"" which includes the complete first two seasons. In all, we have 25 tales, 21 of which are by Dahl. (He might be more familiar as the author of ""Charlie & the Chocolate Factory"" that appeared with a similar title as a fantasy film.)

 Along the way, you will enjoy sterling performances by such notables as John Mills, Derek Jacobi, Joan Collins (in a stunning double role), John Gielgud, Julie Harris, Joseph Cotten, and Elaine Stritch. Some of the tales are fantastic (""The Landlady,"" ""Royal Jelly""), some grisly (""Back for Christmas""), some charming (""The Umbrella Man""), and some just a tad disappointing at the end (""The Man at the Top"").

 Still, I greatly enjoyed the 625 minutes of running time, and you will too. The special features are some production notes, cast filmographies of the stars, and a Roald Dahl biography.",1094083200,63,1341,4.808695652173913

8031246,5,B0002S648M,"This is a marvellous collection of off-beat short stories. It has much in common with 'Alfred Hitchcock Presents', which I also recommend. The world can do with more cleverly told short stories, especially those with a sly sense of humour, and that is what is so welcome about this series. Even the more predictable yarns are worth a look. I could mention a recurrent theme in the plotlines, but it's best not to, as this would spoil some of the element of surprise. Although these shows are decades old they still come across as fresh and engaging.",1378512000,,549,4.670103092783505
8031247,5,B0002S648M,"The theme of the stories are great & are presented in the opening by the master himself roald dahl. The only disappointment is that they were done in the 80's & in england. If that is not a problem, then you are in for a treat as the stories deal heavily with payback & just punishment for those who are bad. Each story is short & sweet & will remain with you for a long time, they did a great job of converting a book into a tv show.",1362355200,,434,3.8876404494382024
8031248,3,B0002S648M,"Excellent casting and great stories introducing by Roal Dahl himself. But it's not a great show. The direction and the pace sometimes is not the proper one. So, as i uually say it's the typical show you enjoy on TV when you have nothing else to do but not the one I woud buy on DVD to see again and again over the years.",1308182400,,320,4.015625
8031249,3,B0002S648M,"Roald Dahl is a writer with few peers. His mastery of language, his incandescent imagination, his pacing and plotting--all come together in brilliant, entertaining stories. So, when I heard his tales had been adapted for television, I was delighted. When I saw the results, I was disappointed. The problems vary from episode to episode. In many cases, the writers chosen to adapt the stories seem to lack Dahl's perfect mix of sparkle and cynicism. In others, the actors are simply not up to challenge. Sometimes, both fail. In Dahl's hands, ""Mr. Botibol's First Love"" is a delicate, gentle and bittersweet tale of love and loss. By the time it reached the screen, neither the teleplay nor Jack Weston were able to convey the fragile, subtle emotions of Mr. Botibol. ""Poison"" can't begin to maintain the tension of Dahl's masterpiece: the teleplay simply drags. Elaine Stritch's  performance in ""My Lady Love, My Dove"" is screechy; Joseph Cotton's work in ""Depart in Peace"" is pedestrian. In ""Taste,"" Dahl's ending was terrifyingly ambiguous, almost certainly homicidal. The teleplay ends on a ludicrous note. I could multiply these criticisms several times over, but I think you have enough to go on. Further hampering the quality of the show is the fact that it is shot on video; the transfer to DVD is less than sterling, and many of the shows have a dingy visual quality that makes them feel soggy.

And yet, at times there are scripts and casts that can convey the Dahl magic. ""Georgy Porgy"" is a fascinating little gem, with a brilliant turn by Joan Collins in a double role and John Alderton's utterly convincing descent into madness. ""The Man from the South"" is a faithful, gripping reproduction of Dahl's story. ""Mrs Bixby and the Colonel's Coat"" maintains the giddy deception of the original.

Overall, a mixed bag, and worth the purchase price if you don't pay too much or expect too much.",1267056000,4,1900,4.894409937888199
8031250,4,B0002S648M,"I've loved Roald Dahl's works since I was a child, and read his Tales of the Unexpected as a teenager. When I saw that there was actually a television series based on his works, I knew I had to view them, though they are quite dated (70s). This British television series was hosted by the talented writer himself, and starred some prominent names such as Michael Gambon, Joan Collins, Victoria Tennant, etc. This set contains the first two seasons.

The stories may seem dated in terms of production standards, but what they lack in sophisticated effects is more than made up by well-written dialogue, excellent casting and acting, and the tension that infuses these stories. The stories have more of a suspense theme, and involve murder, art forgery, infidelity, and many other human misdemeanors that reflect basic human desires and frailties. It's a treat to watch good old-fashioned television without the gore and sordid scenes that characterize many shows these days. Recommended!",1254268800,,986,5.08641975308642
8031251,3,B0002S648M,"Accomplishing the ""twenty spine chilling tales"", an Australian-produced five-DVD set presents, according to producers, a cream de la cream of the Dahl's stories-tragic, deceptive, ambiguous events depicted by a strongly hilarious way.

It is good for watching in-between something more educative and mind-broadening.",1251158400,,316,6.348837209302325
8031252,4,B0002S648M,"When used in conjunction with Roald Dahl's written works, Tales of the Unexpected is a worthy collection of macabre videos performed by a surprising cast of notable actors; however, without pre-knowledge of the plots and their details, the stories may be looked upon as dated, ""cheesy"" attempts to imitate more popular series like Alfred Hitchcock Presents and The Twilight Zone.",1240617600,,379,5.333333333333333
