5733219,5,B00CPTUO8W,"As a public service to Amazon customers, here's a break from all the hyperventilating fanboys who are smearing this set without ever having seen it.  Instead, perhaps you might enjoy a review from someone who actually HAS seen it and DOES own it.

""The Big Boss"" looks beautiful and the redone sound is nothing less than stunning.  There are new tweaks of music and sound for these films that were never there before and they add a lot!  I've also now watched ""Fist of Fury"", ""Way of the Dragon"" and ""Game of Death"".  The picture quality ranges from great (""The Big Boss"", ""Game of Death"") to meh (""Fist of Fury"", ""Way of the Dragon"") There's no remastering of these flicks, but they're still a ton of 1080p fun on blu!  Beautiful colors!  The fake blood never looked so good.

So, I'm not going to give you internet rumors, tell you lies about the audio tracks or subtitles, or give you obscure links to copy.

Instead, I'll just say that I am lovin' on this set BIG TIME and can't wait to get to the rest of it.  Indeed, I normally don't post reviews here, much less reviews for box sets that I have not been through yet.  But, when I saw how this set was being flamed so unfairly, I had to put my post up.

This is my Final Version of my review, as I've now had a chance to go through this amazing set:  From what I, and my peeps who have watched them with me have seen so far, this is the best release of these films that we've seen.  The pictures are sharp, the colors stunning, the extras staggering and voluminous.  (I mean, these are 35mm films out of Hong Kong from the early '70s.  I wasn't expecting the restored version of ""Lawrence of Arabia"", and these prints look excellent to my untrained eye.)  And, I've already mentioned the sound.

No matter what the uninformed naysayers are posting, these are no longer your Mom and Dad's Bruce Lee movies.  And, we can all be grateful for that!

Plus, you get a GIGANTIC book jammed with photos and with copy by George Tan.  The only one I've seen that's better is the book that comes with the Collectors Edition blu of ""Lawrence of Arabia""!

As I mentioned, some posters are claiming that there are better blus of the 4 films available and are demanding that Shout do a reboot/reissue.  Who cares?  I've gone through 5--count 'em--FIVE versions of ""Enter the Dragon"", including 2 blu-rays!  So, like ""Enter the Dragon"", if they ever do come out with better versions of these flicks, I'm grabbing them.  As a Bruce Lee fan, that's just how you roll!  In the meantime, you're paying less than 7 bucks a disc here for all THIS!!!  So, anyone who gets between THIS Bruce Lee fan and THIS set is going to get trampled!  ;)

This set is a must-own for every Bruce Lee fan.  Indeed, it's the one we've been waiting for.

ADDENDUM:  Shout! sent me their package of the new Blus, as well as the DVDs with the correctly labeled discs.  The new blus look slightly better than the first package with richer color detail, but let's get real:

I don't know what all the carpers are complaining about, or what they were expecting to get, because you're NEVER going to get the Restored Version of ""Vertigo"" here, folks, much less the remastered version of ""Enter the Dragon"".

What you WILL get is the BEST these films have looked and/or probably ever WILL look.  With enhanced sound and all of the extras I listed in my review.

And, face it, Gang.  For the American market, this is THE release for these films.  There won't be another.

So, the choice is yours, Bruce Lee fans:  Keep looking for a picture perfect box set for these 40+ year old films from Hong Kong cinema that simply DOESN'T EXIST, has NEVER existed and which, in all likelihood, NEVER WILL exist.

Or you can ignore the naysayers and enjoy this one.

Count ME as a Happy Camper in that latter camp! :)",1374969600,11,6428,4.705300988319856
5733220,1,B00CPTUO8W,"This could have been the definitive release of Bruce Lee's films, but Shout instead released it with DVD transfers upscaled to 1080p. The fault may lie ultimately with Fortune Star for providing them with these abominations, but Shout should have known better... Very disappointing.",1374883200,33,282,5.431818181818182
5733221,2,B00CPTUO8W,"PLEASE READ ALL THE ADDENDUM NOTES, BEFORE POSTING A COMMENT. THANKS!

ADDENUDUM 1: As of 1st August 2013, Shout Factory have pulled this set from distribution, and are in the process of doing... something. No one is quite sure what is being done, but something is being done. (Shout Factory seem extremely reticent to tell anyone what they are doing, more's the pity.) The new release date is supposed to be 17th September 2013. I will update my review as-and-when I have further news! In the meantime, do NOT buy this version of the set, otherwise you will almsot certainly regret it!

ADDENDUM 2: The New, Revised Edition of this set, can now be pre-ordered from Amazon from this link here...

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bruce-Lee-Legacy-Collection-4-BluRay-7-DVD-Blu-ray/dp/B00E9JLQEC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bruce Lee Legacy Collection (4 BluRay/ 7 DVD) [Blu-ray</a>]

However, we still have NO DETAILS YET as to what has been done to rectify the previous sets problems. So please be aware of this!

ADDENDUM 3: Okay, Shout Factory have now officially confirmed that the re-release of this set, due out on 17th September 2013, will NOT contain any new, remastered Blu-Ray discs. The ONLY thing being corrected is two mislabelled discs - an extras disc and the ""I Am Bruce Lee"" documentary, which had their labels placed onto each others discs.

As such, I can only say this: CANCEL YOUR ORDERS FOR BOTH (OR EITHER) OF THESE SETS, AND TELL SHOUT WHY YOU HAVE DONE THIS! DO NOT PAY THE BEST PART OF $85 FOR SOMETHING THAT IS NOT WHAT IT CLAIMS TO BE!

ADDENDUM 4: It has been brought to my attention, that as of today, 23rd August 2013, the release date for the ""new"" set has now been put back indefinitely, until some point in October 2013 - possibly.

Whilst it is still possible to pre-order this ""new"" set, no one from Shout is willing to explain what is going on, and why the release date has been put back even further! The fact that they are NOT announcing their reasons for the delay, does not bode well. I'd like to hope, that this delay is so that they can correct all of the Blu-Ray films. However, I suspect, that they won't be doing anything of the sort, and the delay is merely - as first announced - to correct the mislablled discs.

For now though, you'll just need to sit-tight and wait to hear further updates from me, or hopefully some kind of official announcement.

ADDENDUM 5: As of today, 6th September 2013, SHOUT have now announced that they are working on new ""hi-rez"" masters for the re-release of the Legacy Collection Boxed Set. (Their spelling error, not mine!) So, in theory at least, it sounds like we should finally be getting what we should have gotten in the first place. The new release date is 22nd October 2013, though this may change!

If I hear anything more, I'll post updates!

ADDENDUM 6: Okay, as of October 2013, the great news is that the new set DOES remaster the films, and they DO now all appear in proper 1080p/1080i HD format, with the exception of GAME OF DEATH, which has always been an upscaled conversion, even in Japan! Alas, no colour-correction appears to have been done, so the films still don't feel as perfect as they should (could) be! However, the audio tracks and subtitles have NOT been corrected, so may run out of sync with the films, on some Blu-Ray players. So, be advised, that whilst the films will certainly look a LOT better, this set is still flawed, and open to criticism. The set is certainly better, but for the money, it's still not completely fixed and correct. This is the last revision, and no further updates will be added. Therefore, it's up to you to decide whether you want to risk buying this set or not.

ORIGINAL REVIEW FROM POOCHJD:
If you haven't been tracking the details of this set via Facebook, then I'm afraid some of you need to pay attention and quick!

Shout Factory have pretty much admitted to a few other Facebook members, that they are NOT 100% certain that the master materials they were sent from Fortune Star, were true, 1080p/1080i HD prints.

If you take a look at this link...

[...]

.. and then look at the two Screen Caps (one taken from the Kam & Ronson HD Blu-Ray releases from Hong Kong, and the other from the Shout Factory Blu-Ray release) you will see a lot of problems. And I mean a LOT of problems!

Simply put, whilst the contents of the set are fantastic, even though much of it is only in Standard Definition on DVD, the fact that the Blu-Rays cannot be guaranteed by Shout Factory to be 100% true HD is absolutely abominable!

The set is lovely, and although I hate the whole concept of discs in cardboard sleeves, which is what you get with this set, the fact is the Blu-Ray picture quality let this set down immensely, and that's one of the major selling points for most Western Bruce Lee fans buying this set in the first place!

As such, I simply cannot allow anyone to pay $75 dollars / 60 pounds on paying for any Blu-Ray discs in which the content may not be 100% truly HD.

Shout Factory are going to get a lot of complaints about this, and rightly so! If you aren't sure whether the master prints you have been sent are truly in High Definition, 1080p or 1080i, then you double-and-triple check, until you are sure.

What you do NOT do, is go ahead and master the discs, create the packaging and charge a premium price, and then let customers go ahead and buy it. By which time, when they've opened the set up and the Blu-Ray's get played, they realise they've spent $75 on glorified drinks coasters!

This is completely unacceptable, and I hope that other Bruce Lee fans do NOT pay their hard-earned money for a set, in which the Blu-Ray's do not contain true HD material!

Avoid this set like the plague, as it sullies the memory of Bruce Lee!",1374710400,80,5826,4.633980582524272
5733222,2,B00CPTUO8W,"Look I am Not trying to Upset people With my Comments.
I Like most people grew Up On Bruce Lee movies & All I can say the Versions I had years ago on old VHS were out of this world.
Great English Audio & Great English Subtitles were imbedded in the VHS Movie.
I bought about 7 years ago in Australia the Commemorative Edition Box Set. In PAL Video Format.
All of This Box Set Had Excellent Video, English Audio Tracks, & Excellent English Subtitles.
I just Happen to See on Amazon a few weeks ago through a Google search they were releasing the Blu Ray Versions Of These Fantastic Bruce lee's Iconic movies,
After going to Amazon website and seeing a comment Stating there was no English Dubbing,
I thought I will pass till the Blu-ray companies release the Blu ray series that was as good as The Commemorative Edition Box Set Was But in Spectacular Blu-ray HD.

It would be a waste of my money, I maze well keep my dvd collection. Becauze it's in english, they just release the 40th anniversery of Enter the Dragon in english.

5733225,1,B00CPTUO8W,"Obviously, Bruce Lee is a legend and the low rating that I give this box set isn't meant as a knock against him. But the fact that Shout Factory would release this without english dubbing is ridiculous!

I hate reading subtitled kung fu movies as it distracts from what is taking place on screen, and usually the subtitles are as badly translated as the dubbing. Unless you speak Mandarin or Cantonese, there is no reason to desire watching these non-dubbed versions of Bruce's movies.",1374019200,7,485,4.773809523809524

I paid less than $50.00 Dollars for all of these DVDs; I  cannot understand why would Amazon want me to pay more than $82.00 Dollars for their Blu-Ray version?

5733237,1,B00CPTUO8W,"I would give this product zero stars if it were possible. I ordered this set for my husband and just recently gave it to him for his birthday. The way they packaged the DVDs is idiotic. They are basically glued into the slots making them incredibly difficult to remove - once removed after using a butter knife, the crappy cardboard is now damaged and the discs are covered in adhesive. Hopefully they still play after he spent 20 minutes using goo gone to remove it. Terrible terrible product. Wish I had done more research before I ordered and now that my return window is closed, I guess I have to live with my mistake...won't happen again though.

5733241,3,B00CPTUO8W,"I am usually impressed with Shout Factory.  They typically do amazing things with the titles they get.  You usually get an amazing transfer that has had some work done to it. You get amazing features and extras.  This product tries very hard to meet those marks and falls rather short.

The Transfers: The quality is ALL over the place!

A) Big Boss has the most noticeable increase in quality next to Game Of Death. The addition of multiple language tracks is a cool bonus. Each language seemed to offer different background music which was unexpected. I think this blu-rayis the best of the bunch.

B) Chinese Connection (Fist of Fury) is disappointing even though they supposedly recalled their original release and acquire new masters from Japan. The original release were nothing more than up-scaled old masters from Canada.  However, it is worth noting that those masters had been color adjusted. These new masters clearly have not. Yes, you get a little more detail at the sacrifice of color saturation. It is as if it wasn't properly color timed. The first several minutes suffer greatly from de-saturation.  This happens because the first several feet of film are more exposed to air than the tightly packed reels in the inside. This is a film that REALLY needs restorative attention!

C) Way of the Dragon.  OH.....MY.....GOD!  What in the name of all that is holy could they have allowed this to pass as a quality release?!?!  One of the main reasons I wanted to see this show up on blu-ray was the hope of seeing this movie in better clarity.  The first 15 minutes of film are in such bad shape that it's disturbing. Someone turned the noise-reduction algorithm to heights not fathomable, like in Spinal Tap when it is said that their amp ""goes to 11."" Whomever made this master must have sat there and said, ""our noise reduction algorithm goes to 11"" and wiped the detail from the film.  It is like someone took their finger and smeared the film and smudged into oblivion. Not only that, when the figures move they wobble in an unnatural way that is distracting. When Bruce goes into the airport restaurant and tries to order food, the menu is completely blurry. Consider that unnatural blurry images in high definition are a special kind of suck! Sadly, this same problem occurs through out the film albeit on a thankfully minor level. It goes back to being intolerable during the last few minutes of the film. To make my disappointment complete, this exact same issue plagues the Bruce Lee collection on DVD I bought for 9.99 at Walmart. At that time I thought, ""well that is what you get when you buy cheap DVDs.""  I had no idea that this issue is inherent to the source!  PLEASE someone acquire the real rights to these films and track down the original elements and do these movies justice!!!

D) Game of Death receives the best transfer to blu-ray mostly because it was the least popular of all the movies despite being made by a big studio.

In finality, I will say that I love the presentation of this set. Some might complain that the extras are all on DVD format. However, the sources are non-high definition. They probably could have squeezed them all onto 1 blu-ray...but...whatever. The last complaint is the pages that hold the discs.  You cannot get them out.  You can tug on the disk and it will move about 1 quarter of an inch and then stop. You could try forcing it or...you have to dig your finger inside and rip the paper off the raised wedge so you can easily get the disc out without scratching it. Seriously, that is the worst disc holding mechanism I have ever seen since the format was invented!

Sadly, we aren't likely to see these get any better treatment than they have now.  So your options are nil; it is either this or nothing.",1459209600,3,3772,4.640601503759399

5733252,5,B00CPTUO8W,"The best package currently available for the hardcore Bruce Lee collector. If you're one to collect Bruce Lee books and magazines as well as movies than you'll want this set. It comes with a really nice Bruce Lee book with many high quality color and black & white photos on glossy paper, some of which are a bit rare. The Blu Ray movies have all gotten good treatment and include bonus features. The Big Boss is an extra treat as it includes the rare alternate English dub. The set includes previously released  documentaries on DVD which any real collector has already seen, but also a bonus DVD with more documentary style Bruce Lee content exclusive to this set.

True, the discs can be a bit tricky to get out of the sleeves, as they are embedded inside the book case. A design that could use improvement, but thats a small matter compared to what you get here. The casual fan can always get ""The Bruce Lee Premiere Collection"" for the same movies with easier access without the extras, but speaking for myself and other hardcore fans/collectors, the photo book is worth the purchase alone.",1430352000,8,1095,4.639175257731959

Anyway, if you like Bruce Lee at all, you should get this set.  There is some great footage, not only of his movies, but also great historical stuff of his as well.  And in addition to all this, there is a book at the back with lots of pictures and more of Bruce's history.  Another great thing, I was EXPECTING a small, cheap, cardboard case with some disks, but this is a very nice, 11.5"" x 8"" x 1"" hard bound storage for the disks (both DVD and Blue ray versions of his movies) and book.

5733293,1,B00CPTUO8W,"This movie collection is very good.  Big Boss is a good film, Fist of Fury is a good film, Way of the Dragon is a great film, and Game of Death is a good film as well.  You get a Blu-ray and DVD combo of all four films.  You also get a huge helping of special features.  You get three documentaries of Bruce Lee's life.  You get a not needed special features disc that lists everything that is already on the Blu-ray discs.  You get the ""I am Bruce Lee"", ""The Man, the legend"", and the ""The Man, the myth, the legend"" documentaries.  You also get a very stunning booklet that details Bruce Lee's life and acting career.

However, you also get the worst packaging imaginable, which makes your discs completely worthless in the plastic sleeves of the case itself.  The discs are snug in the case and it also has beautiful artwork.  However, what good is all of this if you have to act like He-Man just to get the discs out of the case?  What good is all of this if you have to put your fingerprints all over the discs just to get them out of their sleeve?

I said to myself when I first tried to get these discs out that the discs would not last that long if I had to continue to use the case just to get the discs out.  Hell, I only played ""Game of Death"" once and it already showed signs of skipping just because I put my fingerprints on the disc just to get it out of that case.  I don't mean to be rude to this set of great movies.  Again, this is the worst packaging I have ever seen.

Because of the packaging, I threw this away.  Another thing that ultimately lead to my decision to get rid of everything, is because there's going to be another edition of these Blu-ray Bruce Lee movies that will be released on November 11th of 2014.  ""Bruce Lee Premiere Collection"" as far as I know is just going to have the Blu-rays by themselves and is going to be in a case that it should have been in the first place.  A regular Blu-ray case for the Premiere Collection, instead of a worthless booklet packaging of the ""Legacy Collection"".

You should skip this particular edition of the Bruce Lee movies and just go for the Premiere Collection of the Bruce Lee movies.  Thank you very much.",1413590400,6,2186,4.219277108433735

As for the other Blu-rays; The Big Boss, Way of the Dragon, and Game of Death -- they all look superb! I wish Shout!

5733324,5,B00CPTUO8W,"I have been a huge Bruce Lee fan since the 70's when his movies first started showing.  I had previously purchased BL movies on DVD and was extremely and HIGHLY disappointed.  A total, complete waste of money.  I purchased this collection based on the reviews of previous buyers.  I AM NOT DISAPPOINTED AT ALL.  This collection was well worth the money.  Considering the horrible, horrible picture quality of previous DVD purchases, the picture quality of this collection is absolutely incredible.  The sound quality is still not the greatest, and certainly not at today's standards, however is good, and clear enough to hear and understand.  If the sound quality was as incredible as the picture quality I would give this 10 stars.

The collection book with extra photos and background information is an added plus, plus.  The DVD's are very hard to remove from the pockets, and one would have to be VERY careful not to scratch/damage the DVD, or rip the pocket.  So as not to cause any damage to the DVD or the book, I used a very damp paper towel, which helped to get a good grip on the DVD and be able to give a really good but slow gentle pull to remove.  The abrasion of a dry paper towel may cause scratches to the DVD, so make sure it's damp.

Would I buy this product again?  You darn right I would.  Would I recommend this product to others?  You darn right I would.

5733365,1,B00CPTUO8W,"This set is so out of line in price. If it was around half the price it'd be worth it. I have a very extensive collection, and what bothers me is dvds included with the purchase. I have never once put in the dvd from a blu-ray I bought. If I bought a 1080 release, why would I watch a lesser quality? I don't complain as much about those because you're not paying a premium for the added DVD. In this set, it seems like you're being charged for the dvds here. 4 films for $100??? No Thanks. These are 4 great films too I'd love to have it, but not at that price tag. Most of the extra features can be found for free online, and ""I Am Bruce Lee"" isn't even that great. (I already have it) ""Bruce Lee: The Legend"" is good but that or ""I Am"" is a DVD... not even HD quality.

A good example is the Bond 50 set. 23 good films, good bonus features and fancy packaging for around $125... $100 on a good sale say.

The price on this needs to be cut in half, or release the 4 movies separately on blu for around $12 each. Then Shout! and Amazon can have my money.",1388102400,9,1055,3.948356807511737

5733368,4,B00CPTUO8W,"This set has gone through a lot of issues prior to it's release. The first batch of discs didn't have correct HD masters and some of the discs were mislabeled. Now the updated discs lack corrected color timing, which I have decided is not worth getting too bothered about, because at least the masters are actually in High Definition now. Well, it turns out Shout Factory left off the original mandarin audio for First of Fury. It is instead the Cantonese audio, which is on the discs twice. This disc needs to be replaced and fixed for the set and a replacement disc program needs to be set up for fans to get the film with the original audio.

Speaking for myself, I intended to watch all of these in the original Mandarin audio so it's disappointing that one of the best films in the set is missing that audio track. I am adding this customer review primarily to help make potential buyers aware of the issue, which Shout Factory needs to address for fans who have purchased this set.

UPDATE:

Shout Factory is now offering replacement discs. Here is the Shout Factory statement:

It's come to our attention that on the ""Fist of Fury"" Blu-ray disc the mono Mandarin audio track is not accessible. We regret this oversight.

All of the discs - DVDs and Blu rays, are slammed into cheap cardboard pockets so tight that simply removing them from their slots requires grabbing the edges of the discs very roughly. Best case? Fingerprints. Worst? Scratches. In this set, fully HALF of the discs were scratched straight out of the box. They even managed the near impossible feat of scratching up a Blu ray. This packaging with crap slots is garbage of the cheapest and lowest order. Pop it hubs would have protected these discs. Even a cheap paper sleeve would have helped. But Shout! just went with the worst choice possible - slamming discs with no bottom layer protection into absurdly tight slots. I'll try one more time to see if i can assemble a scratch free set but if that fails its time for the refund. Word to DVD and Blu companies - STOP WITH THE CHEAP SLOTS.

5733370,5,B00CPTUO8W,"Prior to October 2013, there were a lot of negative reviews about this product because early pressings of the set did not include true HD transfers. However, as of October 2013 (roughly somewhere between Oct. 7th and 11th), Shout! Factory corrected the issues which makes all the negative reviews listed on Amazon.com obsolete. As of right now, they are sending replacement discs for those who received a faulty set. Cheers to Shout! Factory for making their customers happy.

I'm going to keep this review short and sweet:

Basically, you will want this set if you're a Bruce Lee film buff, plain and simple. They way they are presented here - high definition, multiple audio tracks (chinese and english), commentary, etc - is the best I've seen them (trust me, I've owned Bruce Lee DVDs and Blu-rays from other countries). You even get a load of extra features, documentaries and a bonus disc that contains even more features!

This collection is decorated with rare photos (I'm a huge Bruce Lee fan and even I haven't come across photos like these) and a nice book with some Bruce Lee history. I'm not particularly a fan of the bookcase-packaging, but at least it goes well with my James Bond (Bond: 50 Blu-ray collection) set.

I always worry when reviewers say should please most Bruce Lee fans! As if Bruce Lee fans don't have any quality standards.

I witnessed all the Bruce Lee films in theaters originally from original prints and they looked spectacular and film like. Yes they all showed low budget production values but also showed good clarity,contrast and color that popped from the screen! In fact many of the prints were IB Technicolor which was an expensive way to make theatrical prints.
It is clear with numerous re-releases over the years that Golden Harvest put a lot of wear on the original negatives and I worry they are not salvageable for true JAWS like restorations but I hope someone with the power does something to save and restore them.

I know that prints or negatives were recently found at a Cathay warehouse in England which started a bidding war to buy them. Not sure who is bidding or what the condition is but it's all the Bruce Lee Chinese Films. Sounds like the condition of the materials is great and perhaps the best material available for true high quality HD masters for the future. I am only speculating though.

I hope the newer Shout Factory set is decent when it's finally released but why include I Am Bruce Lee on dvd when a Blu-Ray exists???

The photo galleries contain never before seen photos from super fan George Tan and poster art to all of Lee's films. The films will never look as good as Enter the Dragon in quality due to the fact that his early works were low budget but they are pleasing and satisfying to me. I recommend this box set for sure.

Though both are supposedly Fortune Star transfers, there was a marked difference in video quality.  While there is always room for improvement when it comes to Fortune Star blu-ray discs, I'm reasonably satisfied with the Legendary Collection, which I purchased from a wonderful Hong Kong internet seller.  Having said that, I must say that I didn't buy Shout! Factory's Legacy Collection for the feature films.  For those customers who bought the set for the films in a blu-ray presentation, you have my sympathy, as they certainly don't look as they should - at least on my LED screen.  The reason I purchased the Legacy Collection and feel the $75 expenditure was worthwhile is for the abundance of supplementary material.  This set succeeds in providing commentary and background data, while Fortune Star often provides little or nothing in this regard on its video discs.  While the identical films in both sets say ""Fortune Star"" prior to the main title, the resemblance definitely ends there.  One can only speculate why there is a difference.

The Big Boss (Passable upscale). Fist of Fury (Print Damage). Way of the Dragon (VHS upscale/Blurry as hell). Game of Death (Usual upscale).

I can not comment on the rest of the DVDs as I lost all interest after the first five minutes of WOTD.

Not sure about the claims that they are just upscaled to HD but the Blu-rays play at 1080@ 24Hz while the DVDs play at 1080@ 60Hz and they all look better than the 2 on a disc movies that came out earlier this year.

5733430,4,B00CPTUO8W,"Well I've redone this review for the 3rd time. I finally compared these versions, DVD and Blu-ray to the only other versions i own which are the Bruce Lee The Master Colletion DVD set. After honest scrutiny this Blu-ray version blows the FOX version out of the water. I've never seen the other HK HD remasters so I can't comment on that, but these versions, both DVD upscaled on Blu-ray players/PS3 and the actual ""supposed"" Blu-ray HD remasters do look far superior to the FOX DVD versions.

The packaging is odd and hard to remove the discs, so I use a micro fiber cloth to grab them and wriggle them out without much trouble. The extras are great although I see no reason for them to not offer everything on Blu-ray. The Return of the Dragon features the famous Jon Been statement that he ran into Chuck Norris in a bar in Manila and he point blank asked him in a real fight who would win ""Bruce or him"" and he said Norris without thought of hesitation said ""Bruce of course"" etc... so that interview is quite an ear full.

I'll say this, if your only copy of these movies is The Master Collection you wouldn't do yourself harm by owning this. You get the alternate original soundtrack to The Big Boss, plus the Mandarin or Cantonese audio for the movies which is great. The extras are bountiful... so after considerable contemplation I'm happy with this purchase. I must add though that the picture booklet is bound into the overall booklet style case and while the photos are fun the montage of photos is cropped horribly with the top of Lee's head being cropped off in almost all the shots... it's just sloppy work to the point of being humorous.

I can't really honestly say that the Blu-ray version are genuine HD remasters but they do look better than what I had before with the Master Collection DVDs.

It is in fact true that the disc art and labeling is incorrect regarding I Am Bruce Lee and the Bonus Features Discs, the content is all there so I've decided to keep it as yet another oddity regarding this release. Worse things have happened in my life, so as long as I get enjoyment from the movies that's all I care about.

I have briefly previewed ALL the discs.  The dvds are typical dvd quality.

The Blu-rays do look better than the set released earlier this year, except for Game of Death, which still looks crappy & is NOT HD - and Fist of Fury, which wouldn't even play, so I've had to email Shout for a replacement.

I'll probably keep this because the 3 main movies do look a little better and something is better than nothing, and the special features are decent, but this set could've and should've been a 10.  Instead, it's maybe a 5.5 or a 6.  Even the box kinda sucks - looks good but you need pliers to get the discs out.

I don't know what kool aid the other reviewer was drinking at the time he or she watched the movies, but these ""blu ray"" copies are not any better in picture quality than the 20th Century Fox standard dvd releases that I bought about 11 years ago. The audio is remastered but now also includes some fake sounding effects as an option.

The only reason to purchase this set if you already have these movies is for the excellent bonus material including a great documentary with one of Bruce Lee's former friends William Cheung. I will probably purchase it just for my collection once the price drops. I can't bring myself to pay the current price just for the extra docus and same quality movies that I already watch.

For those with no other Bruce Lee titles in your library, this would be an excellent and inclusive addition.",1375401600,10,932,4.608433734939759

8584703,5,B00CPTUO8W,"Gorgeous collection.  When I bought this it had slipped my mind that Enter The Dragon wasn't included but that's cool. I don't mind buying it separately.  The photos are great. YES, the cardboard slips that hold the discs in place are tough the first time but once you know how much force to use to get a disc in/out, you get use to it quickly. Besides it works great if you're moving the entire collection around. If you turn it sideways or upside down, the discs won't slip out of their sleeves.

Looks great on a coffee table!",1505260800,3,529,4.377551020408164
8584704,5,B00CPTUO8W,"I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend. Bruce Lee is who he wants to be. Once he opened this, we had to watch all the movies...all. In one day . He got really happy that there was blue Ray disc ,also. The picture was so clear. I'm sure he loves this and I'm glad I got it for him.",1493942400,3,282,3.639344262295082

8584710,4,B00CPTUO8W,"Nice collection and love the book with all the detailed information. The DVD'S are placed in these slits within pages inside the book. Some are difficult to take out as you have to slide them up and the slits are pretty tight. I guess it's a good thing to ensure that the DVD's stay in. Besides that, great collection; great quality.",1481155200,5,333,4.475409836065574
8584711,4,B00CPTUO8W,"The only thing that keeps this set from getting five-stars is the way that the discs are packaged within the ""pages"".  The discs are wedged in the pages so tightly that you can't remove them without getting your fingerprints all over the discs!  I do like that you have the option to watch the films in their ORIGINAL Cantonese language which makes A LOT more sense when watching a movie like ""The Way of the Dragon"".",1475107200,,417,4.473684210526316
