8442940,5,B004V4RU9K,"This is entertainment for anyone who loves the stage,
televison and motion pictures. It provides an intimate
atmosphere with the spotlight on the master professionals at
the highest levels of the industry. Moderator Luke Yankee
has a graceful and fluent style and a sure grip on the
backstories of his guests; he is reminiscent of David Frost.
Michael Learned, certainly an icon to everyone who watches
""The Waltons."" which is destined to remain one of the reliably
seen classics of the 20th and 21st centuries. Ninety minutes
go by too quickly as both Ms. Learned and Mr. Lee have the
physical charm and mental agility to deal with host Yankee's
smoothly probing questions that illuminate craft technique to the
audience and sweetens the anecdotes that humanize the
professions while simultaneously connecting with everyone one who
gets to watch this unique episode. David Lee has established
himself as one of the preeminent producing talents in
television history. Watching him comment about what it takes
to reach that pinnacle is worth the price of the DVD.  Judging
by this first episode the series should be retitled: Conversations
on the Craft by the Masters. It's a must see for professionals,
aspiring professionals and will belong in every public or academic library.",1304640000,,1278,5.144230769230769
