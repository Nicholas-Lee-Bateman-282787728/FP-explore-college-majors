It may not be so good that I'll watch it again, but my daughter is enjoying it now so it was worth the purchase.  I really love the opening and closing tracks, the music is quite good.  The art is very pleasing in this anime.",1519862400,,292,3.8983050847457625
8506228,3,B006XDU82I,"Someday's Dreamers is a 2003 anime based on a Shjo manga (manga targeted to females).  It was originally licensed to Geneon entertainment USA but Sentai recently picked up the defunct license.  The first half of the series has 12 episodes on two discs.

First of all, this is a good, but not overachieving anime.  It is definitely targeted to young female viewers and has a kind of reverse harem feel (one promising young lady surrounded by a horde of attractive male anime stereotypes).  What does get me is that Sora is a rather interesting character but that the entire supporting cast is a mash up of Shjo archetypes.  At least we didn't have the heroine running towards school with toast in her mouth!  (a rather obvious Shjo metaphor).

There are a lot of similarities to Harry Potter, though with a decidedly Japanese setting and story.  I wonder if the author got his idea initially from watching or reading the popular series (the first which had been released in both formats in Japan by the time he started the manga).

The story takes awhile to develop and by the end of the series, the viewer is left feeling let down.  I gave this series three stars based on the aforementioned factors.  What it does have going for it - an engaging heroine; a decent, though slow developing story; and quality animation for the time (2003).  I recommend it for fans of the genre (magical girl or Shjo style), but not really to a broad anime audience.  There are much better magical girl anime series out there.  And the price Sentai is charging is highway robbery.",1402876800,3,1562,4.649635036496351
8506229,4,B006XDU82I,"This anime is really good. It's about a girl that moves to the city in hopes of becoming a great mage, like her mother. She meets many people and makes many memories.

This anime has just about everything. A good story, great characters, beautiful animation, music, and plenty of drama. It's a very well done series. My only complaint is the length. What they were trying to do was accomplish, but it could have been way better if the characters had been developed longer. All the best anime dramas are more than 13 episodes, with very few exceptions. Air for example. The reason for this i believe is that to successfully have a great drama is to develop characters in depth. Someday's Dreamers is a great drama, but only 4 stars for me b/c I wanted to know more about the characters. Don't, however, let that stop you from watching though. This anime is very good. You'll probably enjoy it a lot. I know i did.",1350604800,,912,4.493975903614458
8506230,4,B006XDU82I,"Of all the anime I've watched, this may be one of the more gentle and slow developing that I've seen. And I mean both those as good evaluations.

Someday's Dreamers looks at the lives of a handful of apprentice magicians, chief among them Kikuchi Yume, as they grow into their powers and their place in the world.

There is slow romance and a tender look at how people deal with troubled pasts. While somewhat tired themes in anime and manga, they play out nicely in this series.

Admittedly, this isn't for everyone. Some viewers will find this boring. It has a feel similar to that of Kimi ni Todoke or Blue Drop (the anime, not the manga). If I had to pick one word for it, it would be ""pleasant."" Or, perhaps, ""calming."" But if that isn't your thing, this wouldn't be a series for you.

But if you like cute, sweet stories about courage and love, then this will be rather enjoyable.",1335830400,8,886,4.41717791411043
8506231,5,B006XDU82I,"Finally I have found an anime that has everything! What I mean by this, IT IS AMAZING. Fantastic cover. Beautiful discs, storyline, plots, EXC.

Five stars completely.

Don't turn this down.",1334620800,5,190,5.096774193548387
