8686873,5,B00P8DI36M,"It's a film of breaking down characteristics and environment. An afternoon plays out in a family apartment where people are mingling and interacting. Instead of the film setting up standard boundaries of character introduction, formalized plot that puts into focus one storyline over others, the film plays viewer to everything within visible range. Maybe the title focusing on the cat is telling since it's disposition feels like what the cat has ability to see. Yes, classify as an art film, I guess, because films that make structural decisions get the label, but it's also an excellent filmmaking exercise.",1423180800,,610,5.23469387755102
8686874,2,B00P8DI36M,"A love it or hate it movie. I was confused about why this movie got so much buzz. To me it was like a film-school project. I'd give it a good grade, but I wouldn't suggest my friends go out and watch it. It was mostly just very monotonous. And I love a good foreign film pace every now and then. But in this film the tension was not about a character or a plot, more about the setting and filming. Some tight shots in a cramped apartment. But some people love it. So hard to know.",1421884800,,480,3.9587628865979383
