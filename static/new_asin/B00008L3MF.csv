7985162,5,B00008L3MF,"I'll always love this show.

It shows a lot of the Japanese culture, and keeps that classic genre alive.

Cardcaptor Sakura, to me, is the princess of shoujo manga/anime.

Excellent!",1178928000,,182,5.0

#56 Sakura, Kero and the Sweet Meeting

Let's say this one is very crazy! Sakura's class is having a sweet food bake sale or something. Sakura let Kero eat his own sweets in the school yard. However Kero meets his recreation. Which is Spinel Sun. Spinel Sun looks alot like Kero, only he's purple with blue cat-like eyes. Kero has no clue that Spinel is his recreation. Spinel knows that if he tells Kero his real name Eriols plan will be ruined. He says his name is ""Suppie"". Kero offers Suppie some sweets. But Suppie goes nuts cause he keeps wanting more and more. It turns out that Suppie gets drunk from eating sweets!!!! Loony or what?

#57 Sakura, Shaoran and the Elevator

While having a fun time when Sakura and Shaoran get on a elevator they get trapped! Somehow Sakura falls down this deep thing and Shaoran screams her first name. But Sakura used the Float card. Shaoran said he shall call her Sakura and she can call him Shaoran.

#58 Sakura and the Double Trouble

It's double trouble when Sakura, Keroberos and Yue sense Clow Reeds presence again, yet when they go to check it out there's nothing to be found. They figure to go back home. Keroberous and Yue try to go back in there earthly forms as Kero and Yukito but they can't! There stuck as Yue and Keroberos. One problem is Sakura will have to sneak them in her bedroom. Trouble happens when Keroberos can't fit through the window! And another problem is the next day Sakura is cleaning and Keroberos spills flower all over himself. Sakura uses the Bubble card to give him a bath. But then she figures out to use Sheild to get them back to there earthly forms, it worked!

#59 Sakura, Tomoyo and the Ball Trap

This one is VERY touching at the end!!! To me when it comes with Sakura and Tomoyo its always touching!!! Sakura, Tomoyo, Kero and Shaoran go to the school at night to find where Clow's presence is coming from. They see a Basketball is moving all by itself! And they see that space is being messed up, like when they go to open the classroom door to go out to the hallway, it's another classroom! When they close it and open it again it's the Music room! Then they walk in and the door shuts between Sakura and Tomoyo. Sakura opens it but Tomoyo is gone! Sakura was very upset that she couldn't find Tomoyo. She was about to cry but Shaoran told her nothing will come from crying, she must think. Then Sakura heard Tomoyo's singing voice. Tomoyo was trying to let them know where she was. Sakura used the Shadow card to lead them to Tomoyo's shadow. It worked. Sakura saw Tomoyo and she went over and hugged Tomoyo. Tomoyo said that she wasn't scared by herself because she knew that Sakura would find her.

  There VERY CUTE episodes!!!

  It's worth your money!

7985164,4,B00008L3MF,"Cardcaptor Sakura, Volume 15: Realizations, contains episodes 56 through 59 of the anime series about a young girl who must capture a set of magical cards she accidentally set free.

The four episodes on this DVD are high on cuteness, jokes, and love, and extremely low on action.  I can say, this is the first Sakura volume with NO action.

Eriol, revealed to be the villian in the last volume, acts less like Sakura's enemy here - and more like her matchmaker.  What is this?  Even his supposedly wicked sidekicks only caper about clamouring for sweets.

Episode 56; Sakura and the Sweet Meeting - This is actually a pretty funny episode, as Kero and ""Suppie"" meet.  Suppie avoids sweets, knowing what will happen.  But Sakura's school is having a fair, and Kero forces his basket of sweets on his new friend!

Episode 57: Sakura, Shaoran, and the Elevator - On their way home from a teddy bear exhibit, Eriol causes Sakura and Li Shaoran to be trapped in an elevator.  For the big deal they made about the teddy bear exhibit, it would have been nice to see some of the bears.

Episode 58: Sakura and Double Trouble - Eriol prevents Yue and Kereberos from turning back into their usual forms.  The extraordinary creatures are trapped inside Sakura's house on a rainy Sunday.  Again, Kereberos is quite a magnificent beast when he transforms.  I wish he could act like he looks, and not like a three year-old.

We also learn something about Yue and Clow Reed, the sorceror who created the Clow Cards.  Ooh!  More yaoi!  It seems Yue and Clow might have had a thing going on.

Episode 59: Sakura and the Ball Trap - The ball trap is a basketball rolling through the school - lame.  The best part about this episode is how Tomoyo has Li over for tea and helps him with his feelings for Sakura.  I wish I had a friend like Tomoyo.  Sweet, loving, never expecting anything in return.  She loves Sakura so genuinely that she would want Sakura to be happy with someone else if that is what will truly make her friend happy.

Extras: only a small ""art gallery"" of black and white sketches.  Give me a break!  With a series as long-running and popular as Cardcaptor Sakura, how about some voice actor interviews?????",1131840000,2,2209,4.571428571428571
7985165,5,B00008L3MF,"This is the best! Shaoran Li figures out he REALLY likes Sakura, and Tomoyo finds out on her own that he likes Sakura! Sakura is clueless, but I already know what's gonna happen in future episodes. ^.^ I don't think I should say it or else I'll be spoiling it for all of you! But I know this series is gonna be a good one! ^.~",1054425600,7,326,3.9545454545454546
7985166,5,B00008L3MF,"One thing I have to say about this dvd:
ADORABLE!!
At first I thought the third season was getting dull,but in this dvd it changes my whole thoughts of it being a copy of the manga!
~Ep. 56 Sakura,Kero and Sweet Meeting~
Very intresting episode. What if Kero and Spinel met at Sakura's school bazzar? Would Eriol's fun 'plans' be ruined? What happens when Spinel eats sweets? Find out! ^_^
~Ep. 57 Sakura,Shaoran and the Elevator~
O...M...G!!KAWAII!!!This whole epsiode is about Shaoran thinking about his feelings for Sakura. It also holds something that shocks Sakura that Sharoan does when they get stuck in a elevator...thanks to someone with glasses and dark blue hair.^_~ Will Shaoran find out his true feelings? And will he be able to tell Sakura? Again,this has to be one of my favorite episodes! The song in the episode is so kawaii too(I'm listening to it now! I'm in love with it!)! Shaoran sings!!
~Ep. 58 Sakura and Double trouble~
What happens when Yue and Kero couldn't go back to their disgused forms? This episode is really intresting,you get to see how Sakura deals with them both....its really funny how Kero gets jealous....hehe! ^_^ Poor Kero-chan....
~Ep. 59 Sakura,Tomoyo,and the ball trap~
Okay,there had to be at least one copy from the manga in this dvd,huh? Oh well...this episode is still cute. We actually see how strong Sakura and Tomoyo's friendship truely is when Tomoyo dissapears when they sense Clow Reed in the school. Will she be found? By the end of the episode it makes you wish you had a friend like her.^_^
~~~
I love this dvd!! If you have to choose one DVD to buy from ...,I would recommend this to any Shojuo(sp?) lovers!!!",1053216000,21,1667,4.751724137931035
