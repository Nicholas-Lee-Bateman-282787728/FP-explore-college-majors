957218,5,6304903073,"Rented this documentary initially after being intrigued about 0% THC hemp seed/milk/butter and its health benefits. I learned so much from the documentary regarding hemp's role in the history of agriculture in the U.S. and the beneficial properties and uses of the plant, that I had to buy it to share with others and to also have it for future reference. It's a keeper in my collection.",1250553600,,387,4.791044776119403

957221,4,6304903073,"This was an inspiring documentary as it unearths many of the prevalent lies about marijuana and the non-THC containing hemp plant. I will admit though that the quality of this documentary really is not worth four stars, as the soundtrack is embarrassing and the footage is technically pretty weak, but its central thesis is irrefutable because hemp, and marijuana, have been unfairly and irrationally vilified by the United States government. Marijuana should be de-criminalized at once or, at the very least, moved down to a Schedule II narcotic (just as the drug derived from the plant, Marinol, is).  Mr. Clarke's thorough depiction of hemp as a plant possessing wideranging uses and application was quite valuable.  Here, the director did not rely on emotion alone but presented logical arguments for the way in which hemp is a superior, and sustainable, way to produce paper in the twenty-first century.  Not making use of the non-THC containing hemp plant is ridiculous and it's just another reason why we should downsize the DEA. Hemp is easy to grow in any climate and we now need a leader with a bit of courage to stand up to the technocrats who infest our government.  ""Hemp Revolution"" is a much needed work.  I just wish more people saw it.",1106956800,7,1252,4.886792452830188
957222,3,6304903073,"This is a pretty interesting look at the history and possible future of hemp.  The movie itself is of pretty marginal quality, it's pretty much a low budget documentary, but it has a lot of good content.
There are some interesting facts about hemp and some interesting speculation about why it was outlawed after playing such a vital role in the foundation of this country.  It's a little on the ""Hemp will save us"" side, but a nice balance to something like Reefer Madness which compares hemp to the devil.
I would say watch both movies and eat some Ben & Jerry's!",1067644800,2,565,4.529411764705882
957223,5,6304903073,"If I could only recommend one video ever again this would be it.  This video clearly explains the truth about the cannabis plant.  It includes the history of cannabis prohibition (how and why it began), the plants many extremely beneficial uses (paper, fuel, medicine, food, pesticide-free clothing...) that can save our environment from the destruction caused by industries that care more about profit then the effects of their actions. This very well made documentary clearly shows how cannabis can end all pollution as we know it, deforestation, feed the starving, and heal the sick from many different fatal diseases and ailments.  And for consumption it is one of the safest substances know to man, the stories of brain damage, addiction,etc. are a continuation of the lies that began with the ""reefer madness"" propaganda at the beginning of prohibition in the 1930's. This video contains the information that has been suppressed by the petroleum oil, logging, and pharmaceutical industries and our federal government, who have become economically bound to these companies that would lose billions in profit or even collapse if this plant was free to be used again.  You don't believe it?  Watch this video, research the facts, and then decide for yourself. .  Lend this video to everyone you know and speak out against the lies that continue to be told to our children.",971568000,26,1375,5.088888888888889
7881666,4,6304903073,"This is a well done documentary that advocates legalization for a variety of reasons.  Paper, food, environmentally friendly, and medical marijuana.  Mostly focuses on hemp and why it is not being produced with all of its good properties.  A thorough historical examination.  This could be good documentary to show during a section on marijuana in school or if you are just curious about hemp (but the documentary Grass is so good and in my opinion much better). The movie clearly shows the impact of the War on Drugs and how it shaped not only the government's attitude toward hemp but the general public as well.",1464912000,,614,4.819047619047619

7881668,5,6304903073,"A well orchestrated documentary outlining the economic and resource potential of industrial hemp. This crop has multiple industrial applications and huge potential and is more draught resistant (less thirsty) and requires less fertilizers (less hungry) than corn, our dominant crop. It also requires no herbicides or pesticides. Sounds almost too good to be true.
Hemp is apparently more profitable than corn or wheat as well, and we're not talking drug here.
I am opposed to drug use and legalization of THC will increase that problem. However, industrial hemp, which contains essentially no THC is badly needed in this country.

7881669,4,6304903073,"The video was informative,  the quality of the production was below average (Including the hippy background music).
Most of the documentary was about hemp and not pot, however the last part was mostly about pot.
I'm all for legalizing hemp in this country, I'm not so sure about pot.  However, the pot and hippy aspect of the hemp issue is what will prevent it from happening.
I was not aware of the vastness of products that can be produced with hemp.
Hemp growers, and those that make products from hemp have to distance themselves from pot to gain public acceptance.
If hemp were legal to grow in this country it could be an economic boom.
I did learn a lot about hemp from this video.",1399939200,,688,4.496
7881670,3,6304903073,"I was looking for more definitive information pertaining to hemp in all phases; history, agriculture, uses, products, medicine, etc., which the dvd did more or less. I did come away with more information than I started with. In my opinion though, it spent too much time on the subject of marijuana and its use. all in all, I would say it's an OK dvd.",1391472000,2,350,4.484375
7881671,4,6304903073,"this as all the other hemp docus are interesting. the one done with Woody is great. just don't get too carried away with a set attitude. there is still a lot wring with hemp also. i take a middle of the road attitude. legalization should be done carefully. but it should be done and done without government control. no, i don't know how.",1391385600,,337,4.365079365079365
7881672,5,6304903073,Very informative...Especially about the way hemp is used for other things besides getting high! I had no idea it was used for so many things.,1390867200,,141,4.68
7881673,3,6304903073,"The movie bought out the point of how medical marijuana's SUGGESTED USE is a helper for many people. Yet.oddly enough, just like the earlier decades, it is still considered more dangerous than today's harmfully addictive drugs! Must be the Food and Drug Admins policy of, it something works, time to make changes to the rules.",1387324800,,326,4.945454545454545
7881674,5,6304903073,"The video arrived promptly and in as described condition. It's viewed content are a tale of the battle for a green renewable product vs oil and oil derived plastics.

Hemp can provide a myriad of products in a sustainable way and yet we refuse to discuss it because of the hallucinogenic properties of Marijuana.

For those of us in the US with short attention spans, we have forgotten that hemp has been grown in the US since our founding fathers wrote a copy of the Declaration of Independence on hemp paper (still the finest paper made and much better than that derived from trees). We need this history lesson and it is fully covered here.

Vote for a hemp revival, buy a copy of this DVD!",1277596800,,693,4.484126984126984
7881675,4,6304903073,"I would recommend this film for those viewers who are curious about hemp/cannabis and have little knowledge of the plant's history over the last 5,000 years in various cultures.  The strong points of the film are the numerous examples of hemp's multiple uses:  industrial, medicinal and recreational.  The examples of hemp's potential as a replacement for petrochemicals in the field of fuel, lubricants and plastics; the inherent superior qualities of hemp used for paper and textiles which could supercede the environmental disasterous wood pulp and cotton industries used for paper and textiles.  In addition, the health benefits of hemp seeds and medicinal cannabis/hemp are convincingly illustrated.  The negative qualities of the DVD are it's cheesy psychedlic sequences and the maudlin music background.  The section devoted to the history of prohibition, with the histrionic 'reefer madness"" lies and the industrial espionage used by Hearst to bamboozle the federal legislature into banning hemp along with marijuana in 1937 is well worth watching.  Not a classic source of facts, but a decent primer.",1256947200,2,1109,5.488235294117647
