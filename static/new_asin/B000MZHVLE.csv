8173641,5,B000MZHVLE,"This import DVD film, directed by Luis Puenzo and starring William Hurt, Robert Duvall, Raul Julia and Sandrine Bonnaire is an excellent cinematographic adaptation of Albert Camus' existentialist epic novel. William Hurt plays Dr. Rieux flawlessly, and the performances delivered by Raul Julia and Robert Duvall are spellbinding.

Despite the frequent absurdity of life on this earth, man must do his duty and fulfill his obligation to his fellow man and to the society in which he lives. And, despite the obligatory barbs to Christian theology in general and the personality of the Bishop of Oran in particular, it's an existentialist gem. And yet, it's the Christian virtues of charity and hope just beneath the surface that sustain the inhabitants of the city even if some of them don't recognize it as such.

Arguably, the philosophic and theological undercurrents behind the story's main plots follow the thoughts of Albert Camus (1913-1960)  and Soren Kierkegaard (1813-1855), father of Existentialism, who in part reconciled certain tenets of existentialism and stoicism with Christianity. The DVD insert summarizes the movie as follows:

""Refusing to conceal the outbreak of bubonic plague in Oran, Dr. Rieux sounds the battle cry invoking the government to call in the military and quarantine the city. Joined by a research colleague and two reporters, Dr. Rieux sets up an emergency facility which becomes the heart and hope of a city slowly suffocating. Escape is uncertain; survival of Oran rests on the determination of its citizens to find the solution together. An epic story of courage and personal sacrifice set amid the turbulence and disorder of modern day South America."" I can not cavil with this characterization of the film.

Unlike the setting of Camus' great novel which takes place in Algeria, North Africa, this adaptation is set in a nondescript South American country (Argentina).

Toward the end of his life, Albert Camus refused to sell out existentialism for socialism, or subjugate the metaphysical one to the political other, as was the case with Jean Paul Sartre. Camus' untimely death in a 1960 automobile accident was tragic for literature and philosophy in general and metaphysics and existentialism in particular.

The novel and movie both stress the nature and existence of free will, even if we make no palpable impact in the greater nature of things; and that citizens should lead good lives, in spite of loneliness, despair, and the tragic tribulations of life on this planet  and sometimes the absurdity of it all!

I do not presume to argue that my philosophic interpretation of The Plague is the only valid one, but only one of many. You will need to do your own research. We do know that Camus rejected all philosophic labels during his lifetime. He did not even called himself an existentialist,  and resented his being linked in any way with the political philosophy of Jean Paul Sartre. In his later life, he rejected nihilism, Marxism, and totalitarianism in any of its forms, and firmly denounced the Soviet Red Army crushing of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. He also spoke firmly against the police state repression and suppression of freedom of the Russian people by the Total State of the USSR. This movie is not for everyone and a bit of understanding of existentialist philosophy, human psychology, and the Oath of Hippocrates (taken by physicians) may be the key to understanding the deeper layers of this magnificent film classic.

Personally viewed the film from an original StudioCanal VHS tape for the record.",1323648000,,346,4.982758620689655
8173643,1,B000MZHVLE,"I received this DVD in good time and in good condition. However, I found the disc unplayable with severe ""chatter"" and ""hesitation"" when played on three different machines.  The aspect ratio also was not spot-on.  I also was unable to turn-off the Chinese subtitles.  I am very concerned Amazon/this vendor is selling bootleg copies of films; a practice of which I want no part. I should have been more wary when I read it had ""... interchangeable English/Chinese subtitles..."". Amazon refunded my money promptly once I asked for a return/exchange. My first bad experience with Amazon. Pity.",1308528000,2,591,5.072164948453608

It's only for region 1 :(",1306454400,,114,4.0

Hard to get, and decent vhs-like quality.",1285113600,3,163,4.125
8173646,5,B000MZHVLE,"This movie is one of those gems that was trampled upon by people expecting a verbatim adaptation of the book and left in the dust. It's actually surprising how many Camus fans (of which I'm one) actually seemed to take personal offense at this movie. Anyway, ignore them and appreciate this movie as a work of art in its own right, merely standing on the shoulders of Camus.
Probably unknown to most people now, it could really stand to be revived on blu-ray. Criterion, are you listening?
I think where this film succeeds is with the characters. Their complexity is well portrayed by strong actors. Robert Duvall, William Hurt, Raul Julia, Sandrine Bonnaire - all great actors with strong performances here. The film isn't pretentious with dialogue, and the emotions range from still to unleashed, from joy and hope to reflective sorrow. The human experience and conflicts are on display here and portrayed very well.",1244505600,6,918,4.929032258064516
