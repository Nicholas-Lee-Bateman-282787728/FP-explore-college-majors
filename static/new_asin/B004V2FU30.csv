8442564,4,B004V2FU30,"Dev Anand abhors violence and initially refuses to join the armed forces, but has to bow to his father's wishes. After some time there, he comes back, but as destiny would have it, he finds himself in the thick of things, when he sees the enemy working against the country's interests. Leaving his beloved, Wahida Rehman, behind, he goes abroad to unveil the conspiracy and befriends Zahida, the enemy's moll. Wahida follows him but is dejected seeing him with Zahida. In time Dev also comes back and is engulfed in full scale war to defeat the enemy.

Dev's first official attempt at direction, though it is said that he had a lot to do with the direction of ""Teen Devian"" and ""Gambler"". He did a reassuring job. The lead players were all good. Technically the film was polished. Yet again, Sachin Deb Burman gave excellent music. His own rendering "" Prem ke pujari, ham hain"" was superb. Kishore Kumar's ""Phoolon ke rang se, dil ki qalam se"" was another excellent number, and so was Lata's ""Rangeela re, tere rang se, yun ranga hai, mera man"". Another typical Burman duet was ""Shokhiyon mein ghola jaaye, phoolon ka shabab"", sung by Kishore and Lata. Punjabi folk music came out beautifully in ""Doongi tennu reshmi rumaal"", sung by Lata and chorus. Other good numbers include Manna Dey and Mohd. Rafi's ""Taqat watan ki hamse hai"", the marching song, sung with chorus, and the happy-go-lucky number ""Gham pe dhool daalo, kehkaha lagalo"", sung by Kishore and Bhupendra. Lyrics by the renowned poet, Neeraj, were excellent.",1306281600,,1522,4.831417624521073
