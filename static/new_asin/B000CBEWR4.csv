The Dick Tracy comic strip began when Chester Gould created it for the Chicago Tribune around 1930. Some said Dick Tracy was based on Eliot Ness, the famous Prohibition Agent of the US Treasury Department. Its sought to influence public opinion to support the police in Chicago and elsewhere. Adults liked it because of its clever stories that appealed to them. Its villains were famous for their distinctive features, a belief fostered by some criminologists that is now out of date. It was continued after the retirement of Chester Gould but was later dropped. Comic strips have a limited lifetime.

The RKO film factory ground out low budget movies. Ralph Byrd played Dick Tracy in the 1930s serials. There is more comic relief than earlier movies. Its popularity showed it met the needs and wants of its audiences (fighting crime in the city). There was little mention of corrupt politicians or similar scandals, even in the big city where this originated. The comic strip would also have interesting facts and tips for the general public. Crime dramas continue as a staple for movies and television today. For more details view the individual reviews for each movie.
