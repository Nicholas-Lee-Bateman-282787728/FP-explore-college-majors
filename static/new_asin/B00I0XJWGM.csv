8638157,2,B00I0XJWGM,"Good idea, but bad implementation.  Cumbersome to make use of it. Excellent video recordings. BUT: falls short.. one has to  download the accompanying video files to get for learning. Otherwise, it's just another guitarist demonstrate his own ability. There lies the problem. Files are in a PDF format... they cannot be ""blown up"" to full view on my Gateway desktop PC... all you can see is a small corner window with print images so small cannot be read. The tab image cannot be opened in another app. Sad, the intent and production value is great, but a useless buy unless all you want to do is watch a good guitarist play great.  Again, without the readability of the TAB files to learn with the product isn't very good as teaching method.  Mr Stauffer should just sell DVD's to admire his playing skills... and performing .. I'd pay to see him play blues... but this learning book sucks.",1499558400,,891,4.656050955414012
8638158,5,B00I0XJWGM,"If you wanna learn the blues, there is no better teacher than this man. These licks are explained not only in the notes they contain, but also when in the chord progressions to apply them. The blues is this man's lifelong study, and it shows. Highest recommendation!!",1497916800,,267,4.702127659574468
8638159,5,B00I0XJWGM,"Highly recommended!. This guy is a pleasant character and excellent blues player. The other reviews pretty much say it all. The breakdowns are so comprehensive that I only had to consult the tab on one lick out of 50! Lots of nuance, and detailed explanations of exactly where the particular lick works within the 12 bar blues form. Licks in the style of B.B. King, S.R.V, Clapton, Albert King, Hendrix, and Johnny Winter. A couple of 12 bar rhythms for you to learn as well.",1484265600,,475,4.6
8638160,5,B00I0XJWGM,"I have purchased several of the ""50 Guitar Licks You Must Know"" products and I have been very pleased with every one of them.  My biggest gripe about the vast majority of instructional guitar videos is that they show you the scales/modes and then basically tell you ""Play the scale/mode..."" instead of giving you any practical guidance as to HOW to use the scales/modes.  For less than the price of a single guitar lesson, this instructional DVD has a teacher show you 50 guitar licks -- some basic, some more advanced -- that show you what you can do when you apply what you've learned about the scales and modes.  Many of the licks they show you are based on popular songs within the specific genre, but they're geared toward demonstrating how the scales and modes ""fit in"" with their licks as opposed to slavishly copying what other artists have done.

A word of warning:  You really should know some musical theory to follow along with the instructor on this DVD, so I don't necessarily recommend it for beginners unless you want to simply copy the licks.  But if you're frustrated with teachers or instructional materials where they continue to hammer the scales/modes to death and you want some useful examples of using the scales/modes to create solos in your chosen musical genre, then this video is for you.",1463961600,,1316,4.724890829694323

8638163,5,B00I0XJWGM,"I am enjoying the lessons. Great licks, well presented. Unlike a lot of ""lick"" resources, these I like and will actually use in my own playing.",1426550400,,143,4.538461538461538
8638164,5,B00I0XJWGM,"""Slow"" only refers to the rhythm backings Anthony Stauffer plays over. Lots of flashy fast riffs that are broke down to grammar school level. Emphasis is placed on ending riffs with the chord change in that progression and resolving on a target fret. Mr Stauffer is a blues virtuoso and historian who really pays homage to the legends with his playing. Notwithstanding his guitar chops, Mr Stauffer approaches this music with humility and respect which really inspires you to practice these riffs. Not for an outright beginner, but if you can run the minor pentatonic boxes comfortably you can keep up with the material. My advice is to practice the riffs that grab you a few hundred times (yes...a few hundred...it's not as daunting as it sounds), and you'll have that phrase in your pocket forever. A great DVD.",1416441600,2,813,4.856115107913669
