8039899,5,B00067WTBU,It's not the best animated quality but the kids are engaged and pick it more than other christian films.,1431043200,,104,4.526315789473684
8039900,5,B00067WTBU,"My daughter is barely 2 years old, but I'm on the move to collect Christian books and videos with substance according to the bible.

I just watched this 5 minutes ago. Highly Highly recommended. The 3D is superb and the story concise and clear.

The main point in the story----

If someone doesn't believe in God because He is unseen, how do you explain He exists?

This video will teach you and your children to reflect on God's unseen hand. We are in a world where tangible things is highly regarded. But it is humbling how His creation shows us that there are many things we cannot fathom.",1298851200,4,592,4.453703703703703
8039901,5,B00067WTBU,This was a great story for our Wed Kid's night at church and just the right length for the time alloted. The kids greatly enjoyed it. I will probably get the rest in the series.,1268092800,2,177,4.085714285714285
8039902,5,B00067WTBU,"This DVD surprised me, it was very professional. It has good annimation and my son who is not even a year and a 1/2 loved it. He loves to watch DVDs so I figured this one has good christian moral content. He really likes the animals.",1142035200,2,233,4.086956521739131
8039903,4,B00067WTBU,"Being that I am a Christian who is left of center theologicaly, I was weary of buying a product from conservative-fundamentalist, Chuck Swindoll.  The video does go out of its way to paint scientist and the scientific world view as being non-believing aethists, which leaves Christians who believe in the theory of Intelligent Design out of the loop.  However, the 30 minute video was excellently animated with 3-D graphics and the attack was subtle enough that only a hyper sensitive left of center Christians like myself would notice.  All in all I think it is a great video and a wonderful way to introduce young children to power of Christ.",1103673600,,644,4.836363636363636
8039904,5,B00067WTBU,"This is a kids' video that has no problem saying ""Lord Jesus."" Not only that, it has no problem allowing God's Spirit to work the message into its viewers - that is to say, it's not some polemical children's piece meant to give ""pat answers."" They're cool with letting things get worked out in a heart over time.

Our neice, next day neighbour's boy and another friend's children were each given a copy from us back in November - early Christmas presents. Apparently, and to the chagrin of their captive parents, each of the families watched it at least 3 consecutive times on their first viewing.

It might have something to do with the video being 3D-Animated. Rich, lush eye-candy for the post-MTV kids.

5 stars because there's nothing better out there for the Christian Kids' demographic.",1103673600,8,793,4.773722627737226
8039905,4,B00067WTBU,"From ""America's Pastor"" Chuck Swindoll, and Insight for Living - this is the first in a series of animated videos based on the Paws & Tales radio show.  Our family loved ""Seeing the Unseen.""

The animation is gorgeous.  I haven't seen anything of this quality in the Christian marketplace before.  It's really that good.  But what really impressed me is how the kids responded to the message.  They stayed glued to the TV the whole time and then when it was done - immediately wanted me to start it again.

The story follows Paw Paw Chuck and the kids of The Club (the same voices from the radio show, I think)and a new friend, Wally on a campout.  After watching the group pray before setting out, the friend, Wally confides in C.J. that he doesn't believe in God because he doesn't believe in anything he can't see.

The group gently suggests that there are a lot of things that are real but we can't see them - things like love and wind.  The message that we know God is real because we can see what he does is very clear without ever being preachy.  I also like that the lesson is weaved throughout - not tacked on to the end almost as an afterthought like so many other videos I've seen.

One great thing I love about this video is that the pacing is a little slower and more thoughtful than other videos we have.  Which is not to say that it's boring... far from it.  There's humor, wit, adventure and a great song at the end to tie it all up.  I just mean that compared to all of the zany/jumpy/crazy stuff that's out there, this was a refreshing change of pace.  It had the classic pacing of a Little House on the Prairie episode.

You could tell that the creators wanted the audience to focus on the message and not get distracted by extraneous stuff.  Well, in my opinion, they succeeded.  This is an important lesson wrapped up in a great story delivered with humor, adventure and state of the art animation.  It easily held the attention of a four, six, and twelve year old.  And it's the kind of thing I want my kids learning.  After watching it we had a great discussion about all of the things God created and how God puts his fingerprints on his creation.

If you're interested in building a solid foundation in your child, I highly recommend it.",1101081600,9,2262,4.371702637889689
