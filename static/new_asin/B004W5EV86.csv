8444472,3,B004W5EV86,"This review describes the Dreamline release with UPC #7 62747 00439 9 containing:

1. A music video by Devon Scott Dicker entitled ""ONE NATION"" plays automatically before the menu appears.  A picture of Devon Scott Dicker's album ""I Believe"", along with a review and its availability on iTunes, appears once the song ends.  Neither the music video nor the ad are mentioned anywhere on the DVD case nor the DVD itself.  The menu entitled, ""3 FULL LENGTH FEATURES"" follows allowing selection of ""Diver Dan"", ""The Pied Piper of Hamelin"", ""Little Lord Faunterloy"" or ""play all"".  The first 45 seconds of the credit sequence music from the opening of ""Little Lord Faunterloy"" plays repeatedly the whole time the menu is displayed.

2. ""Diver Dan"" is included, but it is actually a TV series.  It is NOT a ""FULL LENGTH FEATURE"".  The first nine episodes of the series are included in black and white on this DVD.  They are:

Episode #01 - HARD WATER
Episode #02 - GOLDIE THE GOLDFISH
Episode #03 - TALKING FISH
Episode #04 - SKIPPER'S GOLD
Episode #05 - TREASURE SHIP
Episode #06 - SAWFISH RESCUE
Episode #07 - SHELL-O-PHONE
Episode #08 - THE OCTOPUS
Episode #09 - MURDER INK

Chapter stops are provided for episodes 01, 02, 04, 06, 07, and 09.  There is a chapter stop to a spot that is 39 seconds from the end of episode 09 just after the cliffhanger narration begins.

There are six chapter stops in the ""Diver Dan"" menu that play the beginning of episodes 01, 02, 04, 06, 07, and 08.  This menu is only accessible while an episode is playing.  ""The Diver Dan"" theme plays repeatedly while the ""Diver Dan"" menu is displayed.  When the main menu is initially displayed, selecting ""Diver Dan"" starts playing episode 01.

The picture and sound are adequate and on a par with:
- East West Entertainment LLC release entitled ""DIVER DAN vol. one"" with UPC 8 43156 02012 2
- East West Entertainment LLC release entitled ""DIVER DAN Vol. 2"" with UPC 8 43156 02014 6
- Alpha Video ALP 5710 Diver Dan Volume 2 with UPC 0 89218 57109 0

If you have either of the East West Entertainment LLC releases containing the exact same episodes, you won't need to buy this DVD as long as you don't care about ""The Pied Piper of Hamelin"" and ""Little Lord Faunterloy"".  It would have been nice if the episodes had been mastered from full color prints, since that's how the series was originally produced.

The clean, timeless humor will make people of all ages smile.  I give all the episodes a solid B.  The unusual concept along with its execution are nice to experience.  Each episode ends with a cliffhanger that is resolved in the next episode.  Since this DVD doesn't contain episode 10 BOTTOMLESS PIT, the episode 09 MURDER INK cliffhanger is not resolved.

3. ""The Pied Piper of Hamelin"" is a 1957 Hal Stanley musical production starring Van Johnson, Claude Rains, Jim Backus, and Kay Starr.  I have a very faint memory of enjoying this movie as a kid back in the early sixties.  I really didn't care for it as an adult.  I guess the music just didn't do it for me.  I didn't find myself singing along at all.  The lack of having any catchy songs is a problem for this film.  That's why I give this movie a C-.  Perhaps only children will like this.  Perhaps not.  I found myself hoping it would end much sooner than it did.

There are eight chapter stops in the menu for ""The Pied Piper of Hamelin"", but they are only accessible while the movie is playing.  There is silence while ""The Pied Piper of Hamelin"" menu is displayed.  When the main menu is initially displayed, selecting ""The Pied Piper of Hamelin"" starts playing the beginning of the movie.  Curiously, chapter skipping in reverse at the beginning of ""The Pied Piper"" ends up at the beginning of the Diver Dan episode 01 ""Hard Water"".

4. ""Little Lord Faunterloy"" is a 1936 Selznick International Pictures, Inc. black and white production starring Freddie Bartholomew, Dolores Costello Barrymore, with key roles played by C. Aubrey Smith and Mickey Rooney.  It tells the tale of a 9 year old American boy who's English dad has died.  The boys gruff grandfather is an Earl who sends for the boy to train him as his replacement at his English castle.  The grandfather doesn't like Americans, so he allows the boys mother to live in a house nearby with the stipulation she should never enter the castle.  A complication arises when another woman claims she not only married the boys father, but that they had a child together who should be in line to succeed the grandfather.

The picture and sound are adequate although there are a few short jump cuts.  The whole picture is a little jittery throughout.  I enjoyed the performances all around, and I give the story a B-.  It's a quaint, fairly low budget film filled with interesting characters.  Una O'Conner appears in her usual role as a maid offering a bit of comedy relief.

There are eight chapter stops in the ""Little Lord Faunterloy"" menu, but they are only accessible while the movie is playing.  The first 45 seconds of the credit sequence music from the opening of ""Little Lord Faunterloy"" plays while the ""Little Lord Faunterloy"" menu is displayed.  When the main menu is initially displayed, selecting ""Little Lord Faunterloy"" starts playing the beginning of the movie.  Curiously, chapter skipping in reverse at the beginning of ""Little Lord Faunterloy"" ends up at the beginning of the ""The Pied Piper of Hamelin"".

------------------

""Little Lord Faunterloy"" and the ""Diver Dan"" episodes are quite enjoyable.  ""The Pied Piper of Hamelin"" is definitely the weakest of the three.  I imagine it only took top billing on this DVD because its title is much more recognizable than the other two segments.",1478995200,,5706,4.685110663983903
