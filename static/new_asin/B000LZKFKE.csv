Welp before opening it I got an Amazon rep on the phone and they confirmed it is not subtitled in English. So I had to return before opening. Granted my Spanish is good, not great, but it's just not the same if you can't understand exactly what is happening.",1339804800,6,382,4.319444444444445
8165422,5,B000LZKFKE,"Early work of Pedro Almodovar who has shown creativity for a few human beens.  His Divas, Victoria Abril and Carmen Maura, are a key to his movies.  It feels like he had written the character thinking of them.  It took me a while to find Kika in DVD and region 1 under $50.  But not only got it under $50 but with another two classics: Que he hecho yo para merecer esto? (What have I done to deserve this? and La Ley del Deseo (Law of Desire).  Am more than pleased with my 3 DVD Value Pack!",1252713600,2,491,4.020618556701031
