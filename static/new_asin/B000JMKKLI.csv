8152402,5,B000JMKKLI,"Coming from a huge Ringo Starr Thomas fan, i loved shining time station, and the first 5 US VHS's his narration was released on. I even got the original 6 UK Videos. But there was a time, when it was hard for his episodes to come by. For a while i didn't even have Tenders & Turntables and Thomas Breaks the rules untill i was in 5th grade! Recently i decided to finish my thomas collection. Now i believe when this VHS was released with thomas comes to breakfast(which i did purchase back then), it should have had RS US. But anyways you got some episodes that used to be rare, Percy Runs Away, Henry's Special Coal, The Flying Kipper, and Toby The Tram Engine to name a few. With the advent of youtube, and recently with many US DVD releases while Better Late Than Never, Tenders & Turntables and Thomas Breaks the rules still have never been re-released, this DVD still has episodes from them with George Carlin narrating them. Check them out! Great stories from season 1",1399334400,2,974,4.446927374301676
8152403,4,B000JMKKLI,"My 4-year-old son loves this Thomas movie, like most Thomas movies.  My only gripe with it is the Sir Topham Hatt song that includes the line, ""It's the fat conductor's railway.""  Earlier in the song they refer to him as ""stout"" and I wish they would have used that word instead, since in our house we don't describe people as ""fat.""  Since the children's voices are a little difficult to understand I don't think my son has picked up on the word yet, or he might not grasp the adjective yet, so I haven't had to explain it so far.  Other than that it's a fun movie for your Thomas fan!",1193356800,3,586,4.252252252252252
8152404,5,B000JMKKLI,"Remember back in the olden days were Thomas the Tank Engine only had about 7 characters, Thomas, Edward, Henry, Gordon, James, Percy, and Toby. This 5 star Thomas video lets us relive those classic days with these 7 classic stories that include:

A Big Day For Thomas(Vol. 1)  A:

Find out what happens to Thomas when he gets to impatient to pull his very first train.

Percy Runs Away(Vol. 3)  B:

When Percy forgets to whistle at the signal box, he nearly encounters a head-on colision with Gordon.

Thomas Breaks The Rules(Vol. 4)  A:

Thomas gets in trouble with the police because he doesn't have cowcatchers and side-plates, but luckily an engine who fits that profile, Toby, is on his way to Sir Topham Hatt's Railway.

Henry's Special Coal(Vol. 3)  A:

Henry is ill and nothing seems to make him better. But there is a cure for Henry, special coal. It's either that or the scrapyard.

The Flying Kipper(Vol. 3)  A+:

A snow jammed signal causes Henry to end up in a ""fishy"" situation.

Trouble For Thomas(Vol. 1)  A:

Thomas is tired of shunting coaches all the time but, after a dilema with some freight cars, he'll enjoy shunting coaches.

Toby The Tram Engine(Vol. 3)  B:

Meet Toby and see how he gets saved from being shut down forever.

Great Thomas video. I'd recommend it since Vol. 3 is no longer available.=^_^=",1097280000,6,1329,4.637931034482759
8152405,5,B000JMKKLI,"Series 1.........the glory days of TTTE.I love this complemation,as we can see our old favorites dubbed by George Carlin. However,The Flying Kipper blew me away the first time i saw it on Tenders And Turntables,and it fasanated me even more on this video.
Overall,Percy Runs Away and Coal are some of the best episodes on this vid,but The Flying Kipper is by far The GREATEST episode on this vid(And perhaps the greatest in Thomas history(its my second fav tho next 2''A Close Shave'')^_^",1088208000,3,488,4.891566265060241
8152406,5,B000JMKKLI,Let's face it. They made a big mistake stopping the production of four of the five Ringo tapes. James learns a Lesson is a good tape but it is not as good as the others. This tape shows mainly episodes from Tenders and Turntables and Thomas gets Tricked which was a good idea and this is a good tape. I would recommend this one to the Alec Baldwin ones but not to the classic Ringo Starr tapes.,1066348800,2,394,4.12987012987013
