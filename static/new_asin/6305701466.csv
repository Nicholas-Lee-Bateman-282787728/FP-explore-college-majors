7892875,4,6305701466,"Volume 16 in the ""Twilight Zone"" DVD series features three episodes from the show. Two half hour episodes and one 1 hour show. The two half hour shows are very good and the hour episode is decent. All together they make up a great DVD for anyone who is interested in he series to watch.

The first episode happens to come from the first season, ""And When the Sky Was Opened"". Made in 1959 it would be a couple of years before man would actually go up into space. But this episode starring Rod Taylor, Charles Aidman and Jim Hutton as the three astronauts having just returned from their journey into outer space. Everything appears fine at first until things start to happen. First one of the astronauts just disappears. No explanations where he went he just disappears and no one remembers the astronaut that disappeared. It was like he never existed. The other two astronauts remember their missing comrade but everyone else thinks they are just suffering from fatigue. Then a second astronaut disappears again with no one remembering he ever existed leaving Rod Taylor the only one left who was on the space mission. Will the same fate await him? This is I think one of the all time best episodes from TZ.

Next up is ""In His Image"". Starring George Grizzard it is about a man who discovers he suddenly has an urge to kill. He also hears things in his head he can't explain. When he decides to take his fiance, played by Gail Kobe, back to see his hometown he finds just about everything is not the way he remembers things. But he is about to find out what is going on and what the truth is. An interesting story though not one I would call a classic episode from the series. It is the one TZ episode I always feels seems more like an episode from ""The Outer Limits"" rather then ""The Twilight Zone"".

Volume 16 ends with a classic one man performance titled ""The Last Night of a Jockey"". It stars the legendary Mickey Rooney. He is the only person who appears in this story. Rooney plays a jockey who has been banned for life from racing for illegal activities. At the time it happened he was one of the very best jockeys around. All he wants to do is get reinstated. As he is in his room trying to decide how to get back into racing his image in the mirror starts to talk to him, taunting him because what had happened and what will he do to get back into racing. In hoping to get back into racing the disgraced jockey makes a wish to be big once again. And then the telephone rings with the word he will be reinstated as a jockey. But this IS the Twilight Zone and Rooney's character quickly finds out you better be careful what you wish for! Rooney is excellent in this episode. This is one of his very best acting performances in his long career.

This is a very good DVD from the series and one any fan of TZ will want to collect for their video library.",1427068800,,2862,4.3439252336448595
7892876,5,6305701466,"The Twilight Zone Series are my favorites Videos Series. I do no t like the live episodes that be included in some of the twilight zones series. Would recommend, I like watching them on the weekends and definitely when it is cold and raining outside. Got them from Amazon when they were $4.99 per DVD. Thank You.",1387324800,,312,4.491228070175438
7892877,2,6305701466,"Really, the only keeper on this Volume is the first episode, ""And When the Sky Was Opened"" in which three astronauts crashland on Earth and are recuperating in the hospital. Things start to get weird when each in turn begins to disappear, as though Final Destination-like, they were not supposed to have survived the crash, and some force is trying to set things to rights after the fact. Rod Taylor plays the lead and along with his two co-stars give some brillant performances that convey terror without the ham. ""In His Image"" is an hour-long episode and runs an hour too long! Alan Talbot goes back to his small town birthplace with his fiance to introduce her to his family and finds it changed...like 20 years have gone by. And he also has these uncontrollable urges to kill. This episode felt like a rehash of earlier Zone and spirals down to a truly goofy ending that will leave you gasping ""Whatever!"". ""The Last Night of the Jockey"" showcases an aging Mickey Rooney as an aging jockey named Grady who's played with the rules and Pete Rose-like betted on races one time too many. He's been banned from racing and has no idea what to do with his life except drink it away. That is, until a face in the mirror who claims he's his ""alter-ego"" and can grant him any wish he desires starts talking to him! I thought Rooney's performance was great in this one-man show with one set, but the story just wasn't compelling enough to keep me from getting bored.",1154390400,3,1460,4.555133079847908

7892879,4,6305701466,"In Volume 16 of ""The Twilight Zone"" DVD series the common thread is men who discover there lives are taking bizarre twists.  ""And When the Sky Was Opened,"" written by Rod Serling and based on Richard Matheson's short story ""Disappearing Act,"" tells of three astronauts who have just returned from their first space flight.  Harrigan (Charles Aidman) calls home, is told by his parents that they have no son and then suddenly disappears.  When Forbes (Rod Taylor) disappears, only Gart (James Hutton) is left from the crew--but for how long?  ""In His Image."" an hour-long episode by Charles Beaumont based on his short story ""The Man Who Made Himself,"" George Grizzard plays Alan Talbot, who pushes an old woman in front of a speeding train and then goes off to meet with his fiancee (Gail Kobe).  But when they drive to his hometown, Alan discovers that things are not quite as he remembered them.  Mickey Rooney stars in Serling's ""The Last Night of a Jockey"" as Grady, who has been banned from the track for horse doping.  As he contemplates his ruined career, an inner voice asks him for his dearest wish.  Grady knows the answer--to be BIG.  After a nap, he finds out he has been given his wish.  The script is certainly passable, but Rooney's tour de force performance makes this a stand out episode.",991267200,,1305,4.709251101321586
7892880,5,6305701466,"Volume 16 contains AND WHEN THE SKY WAS OPENED, IN HIS IMAGE and THE LAST NIGHT OF A JOCKEY. Rod Taylor, Charles Aidman and Jim Hutton turn in excellent performances in AND WHEN THE SKY WAS OPENED. IN HIS IMAGE is one of the best hour-long episodes from the 4th season starring George Grizzard. Mickey Rooney gets what he asks for in THE LAST NIGHT OF A JOCKEY. When purchasing a DVD on any of the ""Twilight Zone"" episodes, I think it is safe to say that in the majority of cases the buyer knows those stories by heart. The main concern is one of quality. How does the picture measure up? In this case I have never seen better transfers. The images are excellent. They are sharp, clear and maintain consistent contrast. The laserdisc versions had a problem with black & white contrast. That problem has now been corrected.",972000000,7,822,4.486666666666666
7892881,5,6305701466,"""The Twilight Zone"" is finally restored and presented in the way  it was intended to be: clear picture, digitally-remastered sound, unedited  and unabridged. This particular volume is a collection of three episodes  with great premises, acting jobs, and interesting endings. In ""And  When the Sky was Opened,"" astronauts returning from space find a world  where they do not fit in and has no knowledge of them. It is a strange  story with an equally puzzling conclusion that requires careful examination  to comprehend. ""In His Image"" is from the fourth season and in  the hour-long format. From the droopy collection of hour-long episodes,  this is one of the rare, classic category which discusses the story of an  inventor and his invention: a mechanical man who looks just like him.  ""The Last Night of a Jockey"" is a unique episode in that there is  only one person present in the entire half-hour. The basic plot is that an  ex-champion jockey is expelled from horse-racing for illegitamate  activities. What follows is a mental struggle between that man and his  conscience, who appears in a mirror and offers to grant him one wish in the  hope that the jockey can elevate himself from a nadir of shame, humility,  and hopelessness. Any ""Twilight Zone"" fan should get this  collection. This is one of the better volumes of the ""Twilight  Zone"" on DVD so far and opportunities to obtain it should not be  passed up.",965174400,12,1421,4.866108786610878
