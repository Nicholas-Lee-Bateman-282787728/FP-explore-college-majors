8406831,5,B003VI841K,"Excellent coaching improved my biomechanics and game.  I had all but given up on Racquetball because of pain in my shoulder.  Ms. Davis coaching has allowed my to improve my biomechanics so that, when I remember to follow the teaching, I can play without a lot of pain.  Also I can generate more power and better control than before.  I am sure that with more practice following her teaching I could greatly improve my game.  It improve significantly from the most casual use of her techniques.",1444521600,,494,4.6976744186046515
8406832,5,B003VI841K,I am just learning how to play racquetball and found this video useful. Easy to understand and follow instructions. I have watched it several times.,1367366400,,148,4.96
8406833,3,B003VI841K,"Bottom line, this video is worth $19.99. Way too much of the run time is chewed up with transitions between topics and with the same music over and over again (I can hear it in my head even now and haven't watched the video in months). The video ran shorter than the amount of time stated on the DVD cover. YouTube has a lot of better quality actual games to see the strategy and techniques in action. I learned a lot. I will never master all the concepts mentioned in the video, I just feel ripped off on content.

If you are reading this you should probably buy the DVD if you can't find someone to borrow it from. If you are serious about your game you should probably buy it at $50 and learn something new or review your overall game. If you are just beginning to play the game this video will keep you busy for the rest of your life if you try and master all the concepts.

If you buy it just be warned so you don't have the let down I had. I will keep this video and watch it many times so I don't want it to totally seem that the video itself is a dud, it isn't.",1317686400,3,1069,3.9906542056074765
8406834,5,B003VI841K,I have this on VHS format.  Highly recommended.  You will want to watch it more than once and maybe NOT want to share it with your fellow players!,1312416000,,146,4.178571428571429
