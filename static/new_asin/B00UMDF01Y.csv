7052139,5,B00UMDF01Y,"amazing! the actress is so well played in all her roles, the story is exceptionally written and since the first episode i couldn't stop watching, now i am anxiously waiting for season 3!",1427155200,7,186,4.666666666666667
7052140,5,B00UMDF01Y,"I am writing a review on a non-existant product! I consider three series to be the best ever...Breaking Bad, House of Cards (first two seasons), and...wait it...here it comes...ORPHAN BLACK!

My spousal unit and I have been counting the days until this is available. We have it on our calendars! We have purchased the popcorn. We bought a new TV and sound system just for this event!

Seriously, who can't be excited to find out what happens to Sarah, Helena, Alison, and the nerdy one. And Felix! We finally get to see what goes on with weird ""Fee"" as Sarah calls him.

For those of you who have already watched the series up until now, remember that Sarah just discovered the male clones...

Can't wait!",1427155200,2,705,4.616
7052141,4,B00UMDF01Y,"OKAY!!! HURRAH! HUZZAH!! HURRAY!! Only three weeks until the third season of this wonderful show starts (today is March 24, 2015 and the show airs on April 18, 2015) and, ARE YOU READY WORLD, I'm the very first reviewer of the new box set of DVDs!!!!  Oh Kallooh Kallay! Oh frabjous day!! I am so happy. (am I the only one now thinking of the character Aaron A Aardvark in the Judge Dredd comic book story about when the evil Judge Calligula takes over the world with alien Klegg mercenaries and then lines everyone up in alphabetical order for extermination? ""But I changed me name to be the first in line everywhere I went. I didn't know it would end like this!!!"" )

OK, Orphan Black is my favorite show. If you haven't seen it, check out the youtube clips. Great acting, fully rounded characters, convoluted yet interesting story lines, constant surprises that are enjoyable yet not so far-fetched that they take you out of the story. On one hand, it's not for everyone. On the other hand, it is a wonderful show and worth checking out to see if it is for you.

As for the DVD quality, I own the first two seasons and have watched each multiple times. The quality is good, although I do wish they'd packed in some more extras. Extras consist pretty much of a couple of ""making of . . ."" or ""behind the scenes . . ."" or ""focus on . . ."" segments and not much more. No commentary tracks for some reason. no foreign language tracks, if I recall correctly (a shame), but there are English subtitles.

Why four stars and not five? Well, because it doesn't exist yet and I have never seen it. (In fact, I think it's kind of silly that I am allowed to review things before they exist but since I can, well, I must --but non-existent products should not get five stars. After all, that would be silly and unfair to the tangible products that have a corporeal existence at this time.)",1427155200,2,1879,4.390804597701149

I watched all 5 seasons in 2 days.  Cant wait to see more of this directors movies.  But I definatly don't want to leave out Felix..... There are no words to describe how adorable and how great his acting was in all 5 seasons.

While that sounds engaging, the majority of the season feels like fill. The capture of Helena and the resulting war within Dyad in Season 4 are great highlights for a series that has actually worked well. But overall, theres very little memorable for Season 3. Not because the season is bad, but because theres so much smoke and mirrors.",1512864000,,492,4.927710843373494

7052180,3,B00UMDF01Y,"Must watch 1st season with intriguing premise and great acting by Tatiana (all the multiple characters), introduction of more subplots and characters in the 2nd season with plots getting too convoluted and diverted from the main character. The 3rd season becomes a balancing act between all the ""sisters"", further complicated by introduction of ""brothers"" subplot and diluted by "" silliness"" of Allison subplot. Instead of tense drama, season 3 wavers between serious, coy, silly, and just boring by the need to address so many characters and subplots. This is where ""more"" doesn't equate to ""better"". I was so excited about watching this series at the beginning but I'm losing interest in the whole mess. Don't think I'll continue after finishing this season.",1508544000,,760,5.237704918032787

7052187,5,B00UMDF01Y,Orphan Black is amazing.  Tatiana Maslany is one incredible actress.  This show will not only keep your attention from the first couple episodes  but will make you question many things about science and genetics.  It's unreal how many twist and turns the writers add.

I know what/who runs Hollywood and that to get a show produced you have to lick the feet of the LGBT, but come on people. There's a limit right? The vast majority of viewers don't like that stuff, it's gross and you have to fast fwd all the time...

7052615,3,B00UMDF01Y,"Oh man oh man did I LOVE seasons 1 and 2!!  This show was ON POINT and Maslany is seriously one of the best actresses around!  The script on season 3, though, really lost me.  It got more and more convoluted as time went on and in more and more trite ways.  It's like they just looked for the most outrageous things to make happen just to be outrageous, rather than letting the plot develop organically.  The whole thing with the brothers was just unnecessary and over the top.  They had so much to go on in the script without adding this ridiculous ""plot twist"" in for what seems only effect.  And Mrs. S is turning into more and more of a spy-soldier-revolutionary as the season progresses which seems in direct conflict of her character for the last 2 years.  At least take us through a slow transition!  Those are more believable!  It seems the producers/writers got more wrapped up in ""shocking"" episode and season endings than in caring for the story itself. SUCH a shame  I will be waiting for season 4 to be free on prime, rather than paying the $20 after this.",1486339200,,1069,4.430769230769231

The many clones requires heavy doses of exposition, but not much depth to develop each totally different from the other clone. Relationships and histories are a confusing juggle. Most of them are not much likable. The tough, lead, working class hard edged girl we meet in the pilot, somehow morphs into a mature middle class hero with superpowers of faking her way through alternate clone lives.",1486339200,,541,4.827956989247312

7052649,4,B00UMDF01Y,"I fell in love with the first season, such a novel concept. but it seems with season to, then three, they're replacing villains. They build up a character , making them a Machiavellian mastermind, only to find out, when they defeat him, that there's someone lse pulling the strings, behind the scenes, and the show goes on...  Maslany is excellent in this. Her acting skills in creating such different characters, making them three dimensional, is awe inspiring. It's worth watching for her alone. I wish they could change the focus of the show. stop setting up these 'straw men', jut to be shot down by the end of each season.",1486166400,,627,4.7

This is the best program I have ever watched! And I have been watching TV for 64 years!!  There isn't a wasted moment, the suspense is incredible, the humor, especially with Alison and Donnie is as dark and funny as it comes. The science fiction is incredible, as is the police/mystery procedural aspects. And the character development, even of the smallest, minor characters is superb!

7054177,4,B00UMDF01Y,"Pretty good show. It's I think a little better than season one. But it's getting kind of convoluted with the spoiler alert the twins popping up here and there. At least we don't have to hear say Kira Kira over and over again like in the first season. Overall, I enjoy watching it, but my mom really likes it. I keep trying to figure out where they're supposed to be are they in Canada, are they in Europe. It looks pretty cold wherever they are.",1477699200,,445,4.247058823529412

drawn into things like this show. The star is very versatile in playing all the clones. She is really good
and I know she just won a long overdue Emmy for these roles in this show. She did not expect to win
so the video of her accepting the award is funny. She is nervous, but cute and funny at the same time.
I cannot imagine how she does this being one character stepping in to be another in the one episode
where one of her clones must make a speech for another. It is hard enough playing such different
roles and then adding the additional layer of one clone stepping in to be another sister clone! WOW!",1477440000,,710,4.078571428571428

7054432,3,B00UMDF01Y,"WARNING SPOILERS:

I give the show 5 stars for the first season and 4 stars for season 2. After that, it's all down hill. The first season was excellent. It was original, exciting, sexy and had we were able to suspend disbelief without any problem. The Jump the Shark moment was when Leaky got shot in the car and killed. Everything started going down hill from there. The series then became contrived as if the writers were racing to stay ahead of each episode. Leaky is no longer the bad guy, now it's Rachel, oh wait, now it's not Rachel now it's a shadow company, but wait, now there's the military and oh, Paul's an Army Major and is now directly connected to the male clones (even though he bumped into one earlier) and let's not forget the transgender Tony clone. They just make shit up on the fly. Allison, who we loved, suddenly becomes a joke and is a useless character that is called upon now and then to keep the story going. We stopped watching by the time Allison and her husband become drug dealers. We have no interest in her school antics or her play acting or her drug dealing, she no longer contributes. The show we fell in love with that was masterfully performed by Tatiana eventually became a writer's joke of random soap opera cliches mixed with endless, contrived bad guys that are always one more step behind the curtain than the last guy.",1475884800,,1364,4.477911646586345

7054472,5,B00UMDF01Y,"The entire Orphan Black series (seasons 1-4) has been a delight in terms of writing, pace, and style. I think season 3 was the weakest (Orphan Black is series best cold, to paraphrase the Klingons), and the military scenes in Mexico were all shot in the wrong ""green"" hue. Mexico required a fiery orange filter, Orphan Black traditionally is shot green. Trivial though it may seem, I think this was partly what made season 3 not compare well to season 1, 2 and 4.

But I still have to give it five stars, because it simply is that much better than any other series out there.

Tatiana Maslany is excellent as a scorpion.",1475625600,,620,4.477876106194691

Since all of the first 4 seasons are available to watch (first three free through Amazon Prime Membership), once you start you won't want to stop.  We have not encountered such an original and overwhelmingly entertaining TV series like ""Orphan BLack"" many times before.  We watched all 4 seasons experiencing such a compelling desire and interest in each character's' life story that we couldn't wait to continue to the next episode.  As often as possible binging many episodes in one sitting, we were so fully taken in and intrigued by the ""Orphan Black"" series, when the last episode of Season 4 had ended and we were faced with waiting for Season 5 to begin in (April?) 2017 (this is to be the last season),  we just stared at each other wondering...?  That seems so long.

7054643,4,B00UMDF01Y,"Season 3 grows ever more implausible, and even downright silly at times. The introduction of evil boy clones--the most evil one has an evil scar!--and a subplot shamelessly stolen from Breaking Bad are just two of the factors that should make me hate this show. How do Helena's eyes always remain so well-shadowed in sickly circles of red? Does her character really need to stuff her face at every opportunity with Guy Fiero-level enthusiasm? Given that they are all being pursued by armed baddies, why do our heroines insist on always returning to the same houses, in the same town, and getting drunk and dancing with abandon? Isn't there ever summer in Canada? Yet I remain stubbornly addicted, even when reason tells me that I should have more pride.",1474848000,,753,4.844961240310077

If it continues to get worse in season 4, I'll stop watching.  If producers want more gay on TV why don't they show more men-on-men?  The producers of Orphan Black must be men.  There's Felix of course but his flings are few and far between.  You know they're there but they don't show up close and sensual takes of a guy rubbing his butt/ crotch or close ups of tongue kissing... how gross.  Please spare us!  I don't want you to show those kinds of takes on heterosexual couples either.  Leave something to our imaginations.  Can't we just know their preference without having to endure the ordeal?  Kinda cute and sexy without seeing their climax.",1473724800,,784,4.4125874125874125

7054937,4,B00UMDF01Y,"Weaker than the first 2 seasons. Allison gets a subplot that feels like a rehash of ""Weeds"", which basically only ties into the main plot as character development for Helena at the very end. It's played for wacky situations and leaves room for something to ""come back to haunt"" them. But it feels really tacked on, and keeps her out of the primary plot to an even greater extent than the previous season.
Things started to pick up overall by the end, and then the last episode has a truly ""WTF?!?!?"" moment regarding the ""big bad"" elements of the show that leaves you feeling like anything could be next: vampires, zombies, aliens... The writers wandered through this season and ended up someplace interesting. Let's hope they've parlayed it into something better for Season 4.
But on it's worst day, this show is still better than most. Because Tatiana Maslany. Come on.",1473552000,,871,4.774834437086093

Too bad they are only doing one more season but I can't fully disagree that it might be better to bow out before things start to go downhill after the material they have plays out.  So far that has not happened.  Great cast and a VERY talented lead in Tatiana.  Great acting and well done writing.  Cool that they can do the things they do and that she plays such diverse roles so incredibly well.  I feel like I got my moneys worth out of prime last month (for the month) just by finally getting caught up on this one show.  I had only watched the first episode prior to this but fully intended to catch up on it all later but never got around to it until now.  I'm glad I finally did.  One of the BBC's better offerings.

The plot moves and twists at a reasonable pace with interesting side plots and solid supporting characters.
The story advances, with new elements introduced effectively from episode to episode, season to season.  It's not an 'action and special effects' show (my main interest) but I recommend it to anyone who likes suspense and thrillers.  I've followed each season and will continue to do so!",1473379200,,591,5.461538461538462

7055138,5,B00UMDF01Y,"A unique and interesting show.  Think about this: It's all about clones.  A-yup, clones.  Absolutely not a technical discussion (but there are some DNA charts on monitors, some complex formulas, too... but you don't have to actually understand them).  Orphan Black is about how clones live... and die.. and are so dissimilar one from the other.  It's about their families, too.  Big families sometimes.  (And you thought clones where manufactured somewhere... tsk, tsk.)

Each episode provides excitement, adventure, challenging situations for the characters, moments of reflection... and leaves you (well, me) wondering how it was done.  Each episode is genuinely different, that is, the writers do not use the same situations, same boring, repetitive actions, with the same boringly repetitive heroics or stupidity as demonstrated by the boringly same key characters as is done by the Big Networks, NCIS Bismarck (ha-ha) being more or less typical of that genre.

This is the only series in my recent memory that has made me wonder what will happen in the next episode. The acting, all of it--Maslany is pretty darn awesome in all her variations--and photography are excellent... excellent production values, too.  Fascinating characters... real life kinds of characters.  (Canada may be onto something here... Canadian production company.)

A word (several words, really) of caution: This is not a series for the queasy or faint of heart.  There were no staged horrors solely for effect (like the disembodied head on the ME's table) but there were some really, really grizzly scenes where ""the truth was told"" in order to make the situation ""realistic"" (uh, very realistic).  We are not appreciators of Blood and Gore so gratuitous gore is unacceptable to us; the B&G used in Orphan Black seemed ""reasonable,"" maybe ""necessary"" given the story-line.  (You might disagree... I could see your point of view.)

Our new problem is that we've followed this series through the current season three.  Season four has been released but it will cost $25 to see now (but free in a year).  If we pop for the $25 now we'll have two years to wait for season five... and, I'm not sure we will be able to wean ourselves from Orphan Black such that we would be able to endure the two year lapse.  What to do... what to do?

Conclusion:  If you want to be somewhat confounded following many different characters through the twists and turns of a long and involved story, like to do a little nail-biting, like to stay awake for the entire show, enjoy good acting and realistic scenes and have some tolerance for bodies leaking something like (a few bottles of) fresh ketchup upon occasion and a brain-rattling scary scene here and there you might like Orphan Black.  I hasten to add that even if you don't like ketchup you might like Orphan Black.

I'd add, ""We Loved It"" but that's probably not really necessary here... am I right?",1472774400,,2917,4.954732510288066

Very disappointed that Amazon gave me access to the first three seasons of this show for ""free"" as part of my Amazon Prime membership and now they want to charge me per episode to continue watching it.  I am not going to pay $20 to watch one 10 episode season of a show, but I am sad I won't get to find out what happens, because I was really enjoying it and was anxious to watch Season 4.",1472774400,,491,4.0

It's like the adage ""keep it simple stupid"". Regardless don't miss this season because of the congested nature of the season. I know after I finished S3 E10, I wanted to start watching Season 4 immediately. I hope Amazon Prime Instant gets the rights quickly for Season 4.",1472774400,,440,4.5125

7055193,5,B00UMDF01Y,"Amazing writing and acting, especially Tatiana Maslany, but everyone else too. A novel, complex concept, yet relate-able. We can see ourselves in each of the characters and root for them. But does Tatiana ever get any sleep? She plays so many parts in each episode, and each one is completely believable in that they are unique and you see those characters, not Tatiana playing different roles. It's like there are 10 actresses instead of just her. She is as real in each role as her audience is consumed by each performance. From her hair to her accent, to depth of voice, athletic ability, passion, insanity, courage, and love for each character's object of desire. I've never seen anything like it! Each character is as three dimensional as any person would be. Kudos to the writers for giving Tatiana great material to work with and the producers for first-rate styling. I can't even imagine what the directors go through. Nothing is overlooked in any moment in this series. I will miss it after the 5th and last season. But let's face it, how long can they keep it up?",1472774400,,1073,4.712765957446808

I decided to watch an episode or two on Friday before I started my day. I had gotten so wrapped up in this TV show I bought  Season 3 cause I just couldn't wait till it was on prime, I was so hooked. Before I knew it I had binged watched all 3 Seasons. I did not do anything until Monday afternoon. You must watch this from the beginning to the end. Cant skip episode or you maybe lost. I don't much watch TV must cause I don't like to many shows but I loved this one.  BBC truly out did themselves on this show.

Every episode, on its own, continues to be well-paced and intricately constructed.
The plot arch overall, unfortunately, is getting too convoluted.  In order to keep the series going, new players are introduced, and old characters go through perturbations that are difficult to understand and follow.
I still enjoyed the season overall, and continue to recommend it, but less enthusiastically than before.
I will most likely stick with it in Season 4, unless the new group of villains turns out to be too grotesque or unbelievable.",1471824000,,722,5.4375

While I enjoy thinking about this, especially in scenes where she is with one or more of her ""sisters"", I'm usually so caught up in the storyline, that I am unaware of the fact that Tatiana Masanly is one woman.

7055469,5,B00UMDF01Y,"When it comes to Season 3, be ready to sit at the edge of your couch to catch every bit of dialog passing between the characters for clues and traces of foreshadowing. Backstories are revealed and major plot lines are exposed, showing how vastly complicated the actual storyline is for Orphan Black. They steadily maintain the continuity in a refreshing way not often found in other television shows. The amount of science gently sprinkled about in the show is comforting, because it's not overwhelming for those who don't care about the science, yet available to anyone who keeps up with the genetic patent some insurance companies have been fighting for rights to since 2012. I love this show, it's highly recommended on my list of television shows currently on air.

I tried my best not to include any spoilers for this season, but I have to say you find out a great deal about Mrs. S and Sarah Manning's background. It's a huge eye opener. Don't miss it, tune in and get to it! I was watching a few episodes every night because the story kept pulling me in.",1470700800,2,1061,4.613756613756614

Also really enjoy the humor added which is great because it's not something you find in a Sci-Fi drama, the humor adds an extra dimension to the show. I purchased season 4, which I rarely purchase shows.,,.but I really wanted to see what happens next and it was well worth the money. We all have to wait until April 2017 for Season 5, which is the final season. Really wish they'd change their minds and keep the series going!!!

The potential is there fir at least three (3) more seasons. This was my very first TV series I actually bought!! It was a great concept teetering between Sy-fy and reality.

7055534,3,B00UMDF01Y,"I've never before witnessed such a massive, rapid decline in the quality of a tv show. Orphan Black went from brilliant to awful in less than three seasons.

Season 1 was utterly amazing. I was fully engrossed in the story and absolutely stunned by Maslany's performances. The plot twists, conspiracy revelations, character actions all felt properly earned and motivated (with the possible exception of Sarah successfully impersonating a police officer for as long as she did). Season 1 was a joy to watch.

Season 2 displayed a noticeable decline in quality and involved a lot of filler with characters running in circles and looking busy. It started feeling like a soap opera. Character motivation really went out the window late in season 2. How many times will Sarah knowingly endanger her daughter while constantly talking about keeping her safe? How many times will Sarah incorrectly suspect and accuse Mrs. S of being against her? How many deus ex machina endings are we supposed to endure before giving up? Such as Cosima being at death's door for a nice cliffhanger moment but fully recovering by the next episode for no discernible reason.

Then there's Helena, who is apparently an unkillable Terminator who can survive rusty rebar belly stabbings, self surgery, gunshots to the chest. She is also apparently a superspy capable of breaking into any building and escaping from any cell.

The growing list of turnarounds & reversals also sucked a lot of life out of the show. One by one, all of the adversaries switched sides and became good guys. In other words, boring. Paul, Art, Donnie, Delphine, Helena.

The last couple of episodes in season 2 really showed how lazy the writing became. The Sarah gang, which has spent much of the first 2 seasons hiding & running are now so secure & confident that they can hang out at the same house with their enemies fully aware of their location. They even invite their enemies over for negotiations. What?? The writers must have gotten tired of creating yet more running & hiding scenarios.

If the writing quality declined in season 2, it completely dove off a cliff in season 3. The episodes are now infuriatingly stupid and require effort to sit through. In fact, I find myself simply listening to it in the background while doing other tasks.

I have no interest in the subplot of a suburban housewife drug dealer running for school board election. I don't care about religious cult members. I actually don't care about the whole male clone soldier story. But the final straw was when the girl who escaped from the cult suddenly becomes a whole new person overnight. She discovers the joys of alcohol and loses all control. She dresses provocatively and decides to go clubbing. This is a girl who's spent her entire life in a strict, conservative, isolated environment, obsessed with purity & righteousness. But she's suddenly gonna transform into a drunk club slut. So stupid. This is when I finally gave up on the show.

Wow, how far they've fallen. An absolutely brilliant show has become a boring, dimwitted, joyless copy of a parody of itself.",1470096000,,3106,4.88045540796964

I am looking forward to Season 4 being available on Prime but I didn't like Season 3 enough to pay for Season 4.  I will wait for it be available for free.  Most of the reviews praise Tatiana Maslany and those praises are certainly with merit. She is an amazing actress with tremendous talent to convincingly portray each of the clones in such a believable way.  Each clone has a different walk, different mannerisms and Tatiana brings life to each one in such a natural way.

Great script, well-filmed, cool locations and what can I say, a crew of actors to boot. Tatiana Maslany leads the pack with her I-have-stopped-counting number of characters, but all the others from her brother to the cop to the bad guys are equally good. I finished Season 3 not in binge-speed but close to it. Now I am trying to get my wife to watch 1-3 with me so we can start 4 together. Keep on going, BBC, and thanks for Orphan Black!",1469836800,,540,4.201923076923077

7055630,5,B00UMDF01Y,"This has been a fantastic venue for Ms. Maslany to cut her acting chops.  She may have had experience before but in this series she has stretched and built characters that are for the most part distinct and complex.  The story arc has been sustainable and within the range of believability, although I must say the first season or two has too many dangling story-lines.  I came to this show by way of listening to an interview on Fresh Air with the writers/producers.  Intriguing conversation, so I began watching.  This series has many things going for it, good to great acting, intriguing and provocative story as well as some really poignant and thoughtful scenes, well-placed humor, an ensemble of actors that have really gotten tighter as the series moved forward.  I am also very happy to hear they have a final season coming because A) I am happy there is more, and B) I like when writers have a clear objective to the finish because it makes for a more complete script.",1469750400,,977,4.651162790697675

7055637,5,B00UMDF01Y,"It took a while for me to get what was so special about this series; it isn't simply that Tatiana flawlessly executes something like 10 different characters all with distinctly believable personalities, accents and mannerisms.  The true beauty here is how effective she is at creating real relationships between the characters she plays.  I forget that she is acting ""with herself"" and marvel at how she can bring out seemingly real emotions during all interactions.

There is of course predictability in the script, I haven't actually been terribly surprised by anything except perhaps the chimeric nature of the original and the genetic relationship with certain other characters. The standard SF meme of clones being irresistibly drawn to seducing themselves has been bypassed so far, but I suppose that may yet happen. Time will tell.

7055733,5,B00UMDF01Y,"If you like exciting nerve rattling intelligent mystery thrillers, this is it. Tatiana Maslany is very convincing in every role she plays. The film editing is impressive, and the film editing and background music really is an excellent support for the acting.  Top notch. Wish I could watch season 4 on Amazon Prime video, or even rent them, but sadly, that's not yet an option. So I've had to shift to another series. I've never seen anything like this storyline. Very entertaining and edge of your seat excitement.",1469318400,,516,4.863636363636363

It's like the individuals are so real and separate, I have to remind myself that one woman is doing all this!  It took me a while to start watching, but one I started, I binged seasons 1 and 2 back to back.  I'm addicted.",1469318400,,357,4.634920634920635

7055739,4,B00UMDF01Y,"I enjoyed season three, but always find that these series need to introduce so many new facets and characters after two seasons that they lose some of their focus and ability to surprise.  New plot twists, though specifically unexpected, are predictable because they are needed to carry the series into new episodes.  Maybe LOST has made me jaded, but I expect by the time they wrap the series and explain all, it will be so convoluted and so far from where the series started that i will wonder if it was worth the trouble.

We'll see when I get to season four.  That won't happen until it is included with Amazon Prime.",1469318400,,621,4.517857142857143

7055748,3,B00UMDF01Y,"Well, for me it looks like the writers are running out ideas. We're just going down a rabbit hole of one shadowy conspiracy on top of another shadowy conspiracy. Who would of thought there were so many dark ops out there cloning people for.....something? Because clones are cool? I'm sure the army needs these Castor clones because they are bad ass super soldiers, right? Oh wait, not really seeing as they don't appear to have any kind of outstanding physical traits at all: They're not super strong, super smart, or wizards with weaponry. In fact, regular people in general have no problem in dealing with them. I guess they are just super devious because they all look alike; oooo I'm on the edge of my seat now [sarc]. I have to admit I'm kinda getting lost as to what is motivating all this drama over a bunch of clones. Seems this series has mostly been about providing a stage for Tatiana to portray her different method acting skills. Seems that is starting to be played out though since the new characters they bring in for her to play only stick around for at most a couple of episodes. And the ones they focus in on for 3 seasons now are starting to lose my interest. This season I found myself picking up my phone halfway through an episode or just listening to it in the back ground while doing chores. I guess really I'm watching it just because I've made it this far and I'm maybe running out of things to eye guzzle.",1469318400,,1432,4.448669201520913

If you didn't enjoy the first two seasons, you gave it a heck of a go but should probably move on to something else.

If you haven't seen the first two seasons and you're looking here, at season three reviews, to decide whether you want to start the show...you're either lost or putting too much thought into it.  In either case, your time is better spent watching the show.",1469059200,,620,4.4035087719298245

As so often happens in shows with a conspiracy+sci-fi component Season 3 lags:  there's too much explaining and exposition, it gets hard to keep the conspirators straight, even harder to remember who did what to who in the prior seasons and what impact that is having now. Some speeches sound like you've heard them before,  (Fringe's third season anybody?)  Much of the time it seems like they are straining too hard on to us.  BUT, not all of the time!  You've got to hang in their and push the moments you're bored and there'll be a payoff.  Helena. makes. the. show.  Love Alison, too, and now Donny (who knew?!).",1468800000,,747,4.7734375

Then we get the boy clones. Then the genetic origin (and not another word about that - no spoilers here!). There are more chases, explosions, double and triple agents, government conspiracies, murders, torture, assassins, kidnappers, drug dealers, and evil scientists. And Alison runs for the school board. Talk about tension.

The season ends with a Clone Club dinner and enough loose ends and hints (What exactly happened in Helsinki?) to fuel anticipation for Season 4.

In the midst of the third season lots is going on, the central story line is coherent and it's a pleasure to look forward to each episode. While all of the cloned sisters have interesting personalities and backgrounds, my personal favorite is Helena, an albino trained killer who was raised in an eastern European convent orphanage.

7056565,5,B00UMDF01Y,"In 2012 my friend recommended this series to me, but I didn't watch it until 2016. (Thanks Eleana!) Now I'm hooked by the multiple narratives, strong acting and quirky exploration of contemporary ideas about cloning and identity. Bonus cheeky references to other shows I've enjoyed (Dexter, Breaking Bad). I miss Battlestar Galactica, so the ethical discussions about clones and cloning in Orphan Black is great fun. (I'm also waiting for Orphan Black to reference BSG!) While there are some characters of color, the show is comprised mostly of white European-Canadian actors. Still, it's great to have the focus on a female actor (Maslany) and female characters and their experiences with male and female love interests. All the compliments about star Tatiana Maslany, who is extremely talented, are fully grounded. Just finished Season 4 and am eagerly awaiting the next seasons. I hope there are many more!",1466380800,,909,5.232876712328767

7056635,5,B00UMDF01Y,I really find this show engaging and keeps me on the edge of my seat never knowing what twists or turns the directions of the characters lives will go. I enjoy the quirkiness of the people's personalities and still find it amazing how well the main actress is able to shift and assume those characteristics of each clone as a separate being as she portrays them living their individual lives. It is a complicated and sometimes comical show that paints a picture of when science goes a little too far into the creation of life and the ramifications of those actions.,1466121600,,565,4.603960396039604

As of this season, Orphan Black is too closely following Prison Break: Killer season 1, OK season 2 then meh season 3.  The similarities even include being thrown in a central American prison!

The two stars come from the jumpy, confusing, too many twists and turns of the story line! Sadly, the story line has become too difficult to follow, and we are not always sure who is the villain, and who is the hero/heroine. Also, it seems to us that one has to be a genesis's to understand the implications or problems of cloning.

She's cute as can be and totally versatile because the various rolls are so varied in scope. Plus, she was probably the hardest working actor on the set since at least one of the clones appears in almost every scene; several scenes have as many as 5 clones, and Tat plays all of them. Plot is complex full of humor and drama. Too bad Amazon is charging $3.99 per episode for Season 4.

Maslany is impeccable as the clones, an ever increasing set of characters that resemble each other physically but possess such diverse personalities. The other characters are also well played; without these performances the clones would not have the utterly convincing world in which to struggle and search for answers and for their future.

I love this show, and hope it keeps going as long as it can.",1465344000,,465,5.2

This is an amazing cast of actors, led by Tatiana Maslany, who plays several different versions of herself (British grafter, Russian homicidal maniac, New York detective, Long Island soccer mom...)  with great attention to detail.  The most fun is when one version has to stand in for another version, you get to see layers upon layers of character work.

7056993,3,B00UMDF01Y,"same as the other seasons, interesting ideas and some well acted scenes mixed with horrendous plot holes that make one want to go to the writers' houses and pull the flaming bag of sh*t on the doorstep trick.  like a co-dependent relationship, you stay even though you should probably go, lol.  the episode where the drug money payment envelope was mistaken for the campaign materials envelope was as stupid as they come, because (spoiler alert), of course they had to use identical manila envelopes with identical clips, lol, happens all the time!",1465257600,,548,4.945652173913044

7056997,5,B00UMDF01Y,This show has really captured me.  And Tatiana Maslany has to be the busiest actor on any single production to date.  Her ability to play off so many different characters and never breaking the suspension of disbelief is truly amazing.,1465171200,,235,4.85

However, suddenly at Season 4 Amazon decides to charge for the show! I'm pretty sure I paid a subscription fee for Amazon Prime that supposedly included all sorts of movies, shows, e-books, and Amazon originals, but in reality the selection is not so great--and they charge for an Amazon original program, when their competitors, Netflix and Hulu, for example, would not dare to cheat like that.

7057091,5,B00UMDF01Y,Orphan Black is an absolute gem! The twists and turns take you on a fantastic ride. Every season is something new. With a plot such as this it would be so easy for the story to get old and stale really quickly and Tatiana Maslany does a phenomenal job playing at least four different people in every single episode. You have no trouble believing that each clone is someone entirely separate from the other. But as standout as her performance is the show is carried by a fantastic ensemble. You can't go wrong with Orphan Black.,1464998400,,527,4.5

It's got just the right amount of science/nerdiness to keep me interested but then also this has twist of dark humor and girliness (don't know if that's a word but you get what I mean) to let my brain decompress at the same time. I have personally never seen anything like it and having grown so tired of the normal trash TV on these days (don't fret, I seem to love those too I just have a harder time admitting it ) this is the perfect bit of change! Just make sure that whenever you start watching you've planned out a big block of time because if you're anything like me you will not be able to stop!!!! I'll give the same review for Season 1, 2 and I'm caught up now in Season 4 which makes me very sad. Hopefully they come out with another!!!",1464912000,,921,4.209039548022599

Some one from the show had received an award earlier this year so that put the name in my head. This is such  a great show with frantic drama, love, passion, and comedy. Many times you're not aware of shows you may or may not receive through your TV provider. The ability to see who plays the characters and some added extras which are not even in the DVD at times. If you thought the first 2 seasons were filled with action and shock, hang on for this ride. Buckle Up! Janice",1464825600,,568,4.117117117117117
7057162,5,B00UMDF01Y,"My only regret is not falling in love sooner so I didn't have to wait until Prime members got the fourth season, BBC America runs a season 4 marathon, or I impatiently decide to purchase it. Sure, the addition of the Castor male clones was a bit of a stretch and the reintroduction of the neolutionists as ber powerful bad guys as opposed to obnoxious ride alongs was not exactly seamless, the writing is still good and the acting...oh I just can't say enough about the acting and the unique challenges presented to a single actress. I LOVE watching her portray all of the different clones. Tatiana Maslany is an amazing actress, but the other actors do not ride her coat tails. Their performances are as enjoyable and the cast fits together beautifully.",1464739200,,754,4.676691729323308

The ensemble is a joy to watch.  Very binge worthy season for my wife and I. Jordon Gavaris portrayal of Tatiana's adopted brother deserves a shout out this season, too.  His seamless connection with his character is beautifully acted. In the end it's Maslany's uncanny acting ability that keeps you coming back for more.  Highly recommended entertainment.

7057486,5,B00UMDF01Y,"Tatiana Maslany should be nominated 4 times (in the same year, every year) for a Golden Globe for her portrayal of Helena (SESTRA!!), Alison, Cosima, then Sarah. My wife and I watch to admire her acting, if not to enjoy the balance between humour and suspense, joy and pain, that the series offers. I can't think of another actor that will be able to, or willing to, do the kinds of sacrifices that Tatiana has been able to do to bring us the RICH characters in Orphan Black",1463961600,,474,4.3977272727272725

7057488,4,B00UMDF01Y,"Orphan Black is a bit cheesy, but Tatiana Maslany makes the show. She pulls off every character flawlessly. You hardly feel like you are watching the same actress play the various clones. The plot involves a standard ""evil corporation"" that is tormenting these clones who discover that they are carrying a genetic defect that may possible kill them all. There are also questions about the main character Sarah and her daughter because it was believed that the clones could not reproduce. There is lots of drama, lots of creepy characters, and plenty of fun to be had. I can't wait to see more from Maslany in the future.",1463961600,,620,4.75

I could not believe how engrossing it has become.

Sometime when watching pay attention to the small details she has to have down in order to differentiate her amazing number of completely different characters. Next time you hear someone talking about a hard working actor point them in her direction to see what a truly hard working actor looks like.

This is season three so I'm assuming you know the premise. It still blows me away that one actor plays all the female clones (and one for the males).  They each have such distinct mannerisms and voices. Tatiana Mislay is a genius.

If you haven't, go back to season one and start from the beginning. Season three will just confuse you. But be warned, it's addictive and clever.",1463184000,,441,4.419753086419753

7057880,5,B00UMDF01Y,"Tatiana Maslany, playing at least half a dozen distinctive personalities, is an excellent, well balanced ""actress.""  If you like excellent acting mixed with action, a distinctly unusual story line, a reasonable amount of humor and an array of characters that will range from those you love to love and those you love to hate, this Canadian-made thriller will be right down your alley. There are simply not enough kudos for the acting abilities of the extremely acttactive, if not beautiful leading lady.  She's a lady and only PC wackos would insist on addressing her as a male ""actor.""",1463184000,,586,4.969387755102041

However, my favorite character is Felix, Sara's brother! The only stumble was the Transgender clone which wisely disappeared W/O a trace, hopefully, never to be seen again!
With all that said about the series itself, the Amazon streaming process has been horrible: it is constantly freezing & a pop up appears ""video not responding - shut down /wait, contact Amazon Kindle""! I just wanted to scream! PLEASE FIX THIS PROBLEM! I can't wait to watch season 4! Cheryl",1463184000,,683,4.846153846153846

7058270,5,B00UMDF01Y,"I fear that I'm going to sound like a fanboy for saying this but ""Orphan Black: Season Three"" is great television.
I've read some reviews that compare it to some kind of sci-fi soap opera and there are still viewers complaining about the science. They are, of course, entitled to those thoughts and comments.
However, this program is not designed to be an upper-level course in genetics nor is it a Bergman film full of mysterious philosophical ramblings. What it is, in the end, is a program that cleverly brings together some wildly diverse characters who are forced to work together if only to make it through one more day. It also highlights some important issues in the course of the season: The lengths to which governments and massive corporations will go in pursuit of their agendas, the choices that families face when they are up against the wall financially, and the all-too-flexible ethics of scientists who are well paid not to question the consequences of their actions in the laboratory.
Tatiana Maslany continues to amaze me with her ability to portray multiple characters and the rest of the cast - especially Jordan Gavaris and Dylan Bruce - perform their roles to near perfection. The narrative for this season is as full of twists and turns as the previous two as the female clones learn that there was a parallel experiment involving male clones who were raised in a strict military environment. While the ""sisters"" were spread across the globe and placed in different environments, the ""brothers"" were kept together. There were lighter moments in the previous two seasons but in this season the writers have injected more humor  - particularly in the case of suburban soccer mom Alison. A good move on their part, I thought.
Finally, one quick word about the science: ""Star Trek"" had its share of questionable science (dylithium crystals powering engines that were capable of faster-than-light travel anyone?) but its impact on its younger viewers was profound. Female astronauts and scientists have often been quoted as saying that watching ""Star Trek"" inspired them to pursue their own studies. I think that in 20 years we'll be reading the same quotes from another generation of women who have entered a field that has long been dominated by men and they will say that watching the strong female characters in ""Orphan Black"" had something to do with their career paths.
That said, my take on Season Three: Excellent.",1462492800,,2441,4.9391727493917275

7058533,5,B00UMDF01Y,"What an excellent show! Tatiana Maslany is probably one of the most versatile actresses I've ever seen on TV or in the movies. The characters she plays and also plays with really make the show an event to look for... Everyone gives their very best and you are taken into the story, feeling like one of them.
The show can sometimes be brutal, but it's only to carry the message of a particular scene. It can be sexy, but it's not overly erotic. It's nail-biting at times, but it's not made into a horror. It's quite a sci-fi topic, but it's not very far-fetched, either. The reality of the script is actually just a few years ahead of us.",1462060800,,637,4.361344537815126

7058553,5,B00UMDF01Y,"Tatiana does an outstanding job crossing over all the characters, really is one of the most intriguing part of the series. Sadly I could see the story line happening in real life in the not to distant future. I love the Cosima character she plays, some funny moments with her honesty.

Not a lot of ""fillers"", though there afre some scenes within chapters that may feel like it, these are very limited. Above all great writing and storyline and though I did not knew any of the actors before watching Orphan Black, they all seem very talented and do a great job.  Looking forward to watching Season 4 and 5.  I heard the plan was for the show to end after the 5th season but would likely keep watching if they do more and if there is enough material to keep it going rather than just extending it just for profit.

I like them all but definitely am on team Helena if push comes to shoves!",1461974400,,710,4.315789473684211

7058646,4,B00UMDF01Y,"Tatiana Maslany must think she died and went to heaven... what greater way for an actor to show their range of skills than to play so many diverse roles in a single production? She does this superbly. I loved the first two seasons, but as is often the case, an American series will run its course long before the producers are willing to give it up. The Orphan Black acting remains superb and the characters are wonderful, hence the four stars, but the story hasn't managed to hold together. I likely won't bother with Season 4.",1461801600,,528,4.510416666666667

7058693,5,B00UMDF01Y,"After noting the deluge of applause pouring forth from Amazonians--as well as a number of professional media critics, for this refreshingly original sci-fi block buster, I explored the reasons offered by the small but intriguing number of viewers who flat-out dislike it.  ""Too violent.  Too Gory.
Can't watch it with my two-year-old.""  Yikes!  The ""toddler test"" would rule out most Academy Award nominees. Anything directed by Quentin Tarantino would be black-balled from the get-go.

But I wonder if something subtler and, perhaps, more insidious, underlies all the blather about guts and gore.  I wonder if the real spur to revolt is that so much of the on-screen violence is enacted by women.  Or, to be more precise, by one tough broad wearing myriad disguises.

As Sarah Manning, Tatiana Maslany does not play the ""heroine"" of Orphan Black (the opinion of  one ""New Yorker"" reviewer notwithstanding).  Sarah Manning is a female hero, and her improbable yet riveting adventures call for her not to ""be rescued,"" the traditional role of the heroine, but to rescue herself, her daughter, and her ever-increasing ""family"" of sister clones, again and again, and--well, you get the picture.  Sarah, a former con-artist with a conveniently flexible conscience, is shrewdly observant, fiendishly quit-witted, and, where the situation calls for it (as the non-stop action in this series frequently does), violent.  Sarah, and, as the series progresses, her identical ""sisters"", fight fire with fire--at times literally, and they don't apologize for it.  At least, not very often.

The slick, subversive subtext of the series is that being tough enough to save themselves--and sometimes each other--does not make Maslany's
clone characters (for the benefit of the uninitiated, she plays them all) less female, less maternal--or less sexy.  When they want to be, these clones can be downright seductive.  Oh, that's right, anti-fans complain that this series is not only too violent, it is also rife with ""gratuitous nudity.""  Could this latter complaint have anything to do with the series' frank depiction of women loving women? ( Probably not, though.  No self-respecting homophobe would even think of exposing a toddler to LGBT activity.  Da ya think?).

Not to be self-referential, but, where I come from, the display of beautiful naked flesh is NEVER gratuitous. Or almost never.  I do like an actor's nudity to occur within the context of a thought-provoking plot line, and here, too, Orphan Black delivers. Science and religion, in gruesomely twisted
guises, wage war for control of the clones' bodies--in particular, though not exclusively, their reproductive capacity.  And, in this contest, Orphan Black is admirably even-handed.  Neither Newvolution nor the Proleefians holds rightful title to Sarah or her ""sisters.""  The show invariably sides with the right of women to control their biological destiny--and their right to resort to violence in defending that right.  No objection on my part.",1461715200,,3002,5.322717622080679
7058694,3,B00UMDF01Y,"The first season was epic, the second was ok, but this season shows a trend in a downward fashion. I think anytime the writers feel the story is losing its appeal they add another clone. It is not an awful show yet, but it is getting there. I hope they redeem themselves in season 4.",1461715200,,283,4.163636363636364

7058723,5,B00UMDF01Y,"I've now finished watching the first three seasons of Orphan Black on Amazon Prime Video.  This is absolutely the best drama series on television that not enough people are watching.  It's got suspense, drama, humor, pathos, plot twists and fascinating characters.  It's a showcase for an ensemble cast of outstanding Canadian actors that we seldom, if ever, see in the USA.  The star of the show (in every sense of the word) is Tatiana Maslany who has created and portrays five, distinctive regular characters and at least four others who have appeared once (including one who is transgender).  Previews of Season Four revealed the coming of yet another new character.  Tatiana Maslany is an incredible actress who is shamefully overlooked by the Emmys and the Golden Globe Awards.  She displayed even more of her acting skills in the recent motion picture Woman in Gold.  If you want to see the finest actress under 40 working today, check out Orphan Black.

This is not only one of the few truly inventive shows available today but also challenges its audience to pay attention or miss out. Like Sarah, the provocative lead character, the plot line constantly changes direction and the watcher is hard pressed to guess where it will go next. Drama, comedy, action, and the concept of family are artfully ensconced within the framework of SciFi. The exploitation of genetics by big business is so plausible in today's world and to contrast good science versus bad science is at the core of what keeps us fascinated by Orphan.",1461715200,,711,5.033898305084746

7058773,4,B00UMDF01Y,"Episode 1 was brilliant.  I love watching Tatiana play the sestras attempting to impersonate each other.  And I loved James Frain as the incredibly creepy Ferdinand.
  But the season as a whole had too many plot strands to keep up with.  The Castors never grew on me as the Ledas did, and I frankly found Mark and Gracie boring.
  Any scene with Helena is always good, especially when she and Donnie rescued the babies from the drug dealers.  Alison and Donnie wonderful as always.  I loved Crystal and hope to see more of her in Season 4.",1461715200,,539,4.474226804123711

7058780,4,B00UMDF01Y,"This season slipped a little on plot. They started focusing on horror and the Castor story, which I had looked forward to since the show began was really miscast and plotted in a way that took too much away from the core cast. It would have been so much better if they had used the actor that plays Felix as the template for Castor. Adding a new face at this point in the story just took so much away from the plotlines I cared about and I had zero investment in the male clones. They were like...paper tigers. That said, I feel that the show is still one of the best ones on TV. I enjoy the core cast very much and found many of the individual moments worth watching. This is just my least favorite season of a favorite show.",1461715200,,726,4.156028368794326

7058828,4,B00UMDF01Y,"It wasn't was good at the first season and probably had about the same storyline development and continuity as the second. Helena continues to be a bright spot and her character is being filled in little by little. I wish I could say the same for the others. We have nearly no background on Cosima, a bit more on Allison (drug dealers? really?), some on Sarah mostly by way of Felix and Mrs. S. I think the Castors were a weird side trip and am glad they sort of wrapped that up (though I am sure they will come back). The Rachel storyline is bizzaro. I hold out a lot of hope for Ferdinand playing a part against the neolutionists. I am hoping season 4 works on filling in all the story lines of the characters and brings the show back to ground and am glad Helena ate the scorpion, her voice was the worst!",1461715200,,808,4.219354838709678

7058833,5,B00UMDF01Y,"I was really prepared for the pace to slacken and the disbelief to grow, but the show really managed to keep up an incredible level of quality in acting, plot, pacing, camera work. I kept expecting to fall into the melodrama trap, how can they keep up this level of interest, surprise, emotionally affecting content? But callbacks to Beth, nice use of Helena, fantastic dynamic around Cosima, spooky Castor clones, ambivalence about Paul, development of Siobhan kept it all boiling really well. The season concludes with both some satisfying conclusions and also an interesting new avenue to explore.",1461715200,,600,5.13265306122449

The plots get more and more complicated but answers arise frequently (and make you go back to check earlier episodes). I enjoy visiting Canada and to see how similar and different it is from the USA (Alison is bi-national).. The science is sometimes accurate and credible but what are those larvae all about?

The amazing part is so many different characters played by lead girl. She is amazing actor. The story does drag at times but the main part that makes this story hard to follow is the aged old story line of smart people doing dumb things....it takes away from the credibility.

7059150,5,B00UMDF01Y,"If you like mystery and kind of conspiracy all intertwined of things that are so hidden in plane sight you'll love this. Watching it is like putting a jigsaw puzzle together. When you think your just looking at the surface there is always something deeper. And the thing is, this stuff really does go on.
Great Job on the acting. Love Sarah's courage to never give up and keep going. Cosima so intelligent with DNA, she can figure anything out, she's so lovable, Alison in all of her perfection may seem unsure at times but pushes through to accomplish her goal, Hellana, why did they name her that? Just a pure example what that religion that she was raised under, can do to a person. But in all of that she has no fear. Rachel, well shes just mad because she can't have kids.

Then, she became my favorite character I felt that people did not understand her and wanted to see more of her. I am not sure HOW the writers came up with the idea and the script to the point that EACH episode was extremely riveting! When I talk about a show at work.....well, anyway. I need another 'star' up there to fill in.
P.S. I did not even realize I was about to watch sci-fi, I had stopped watching sci-fi. I had no idea what this was about, But, after the first 15 minute (trying to avoid a spoiler alert), I had to keep watching. I stopped watching Scandal and Shades of Blue to watch this!

7059242,5,B00UMDF01Y,I find this show to be very interesting. I haven't finish watching all of Season 3 but the first 2 Seasons are really good. The scary part about this show is that it is too close that it could be to true because people are already cloning animals.  It worries me that people would want to clone humans like this world isn't already special in a crazy way. Then people want to add two or three of the same personalities of some really strange individuals.  I wouldn't want anyone to clone me or any of my family members because we are all unique in a great way. Just leave well enough alone in my opinion.,1461024000,,604,4.243478260869566

7059403,4,B00UMDF01Y,"Complicated,but compelling plot,with a remarkable cast. It's easy to see how the lead,Tatiana Maslany,was named best actress in a series,for her work. It was exhausting just to follow all the twists & turns in the story-line,much less to imagine what this required of Tatiana. Part mystery,part thriller,part science fiction,part ""buddy"" story, Orphan Black kept me guessing & entertained. Warning:graphic violence & suggestive sex scenes (of all varieties)might be off-putting to some & not altogether necessary, in my opinion. My two favorite characters,besides Sarah Manning, were Felix, her best friend & foster brother,played by Jordan Garvaisa,and Helena,a wretched Ukrainian woman,with psychopathic ""tendencies"", a huge & animalistic appetite & table manners, and a fiendish sense of loyalty & desire to protect what she loves. The rest of the cast is stunning. You will no doubt begin to recognize many of the actors without being able to recall names or exactly why they seem familiar. Great for binge watching on a rainy weekend, but by all means do it with a friend so you can try to outwit each other as you effort to solve the mystery, unless of course you're the type who hates it when someone else ruins the surprise for you. I must also applaud the script & dialogue writers for providing a few well-placed,and much needed comic relief moments. Well done!",1461024000,,1371,5.18018018018018

The concept of the series is brilliant. I fill in time between episodes or series breaks by going back & re-watching the previous series.

7059579,4,B00UMDF01Y,"Still wonderfully weird, this show is getting almost too complex to pick up if you watched the previous season and then let 6 months pass before picking it up this year.

Now, with a whole new set of characters played, again, by a single actor, what you get to watch is a comparatively broad performance by the two who play the large range of clones.  Ms Maslany continues to hugely vary her characters and quite impressively.  In particular, the range between Helena, the Russian/Eastern European seeming nut-job and Allison, the suburban soccer mom who seems to be going into the drug business (visions of Weeds come to mind) is almost shocking.  Maslany does have an astounding range of accents and personal quirks she is able to impart to each of her characters.  Ari Millen, while exhibiting some range, either is not called upon by the writers and directors to vary his characters as significantly, or else he just doesn't have it in him.

Zo De Grand Maison playing the oddly damaged Gracie is turning into a complicated and interesting character this season.

All in all, I do enjoy this series and its twists and complexity but I have to admit to having lost some of the details of the various threads over the months since watching season 2.",1461024000,,1251,4.7110091743119265

I've read that Season 4 has stronger writing and the introduction of new characters.  I'm saving the series so I can binge on a weekend.  I hope I'm not disappointed.

The whole episode about the drug dealer running for school board was uninteresting. I also find the devolving of Cosima from brilliant scientist into a horny high school girl disappointing. No way would this intelligent woman be concerned with online dating with all of the tumult going on around her. I just feel like they are losing focus and I hope they get it back soon as I am losing interest.

Taking on as many roles as she does, how does she keep all of her lines and accents straight.  She definitely needs to be recognized in some type of Best Drama Actress Award or something.

Tatiana Maslany is mesmerizing every time I stop and consider that she's one actress playing multiple parts (which is NOT very often!).

I always forget when I'm watching the show that it's not more then one actress playing these roles that's how amazingly talented Tatiana is. This show will make you laugh, and cry. It will make you say ""what just happened"" more times then you count with a new ""OMG moment"" right around corner of almost every episode.

The humanity of the characters is what stands out even if the plausibility of the science is questionable. Nevertheless,the formula is working and we have seen a star be created. The supporting cast is tremendous and fortifies the strength of the show. The writing has been exceptional and the casting has been very precise.

I've watched all 3 seasons now and am eagerly awaiting season 4 on BBC America next month. Tatiana is an amazing young actress. Her portrayal of all the clones as such unique individuals is something to see. They did a great job editing this series as well. Highly recommend OB to those who might be skeptical about the storyline. As far fetched (or is it?) as it might seem, it really works. It can be quite violent, but even with the most extreme of the 'sestras', Helena...well, you can't help but love her. She really grew on me. Felix is the bomb! What a great brother he is; makes me wish he was mine. Oh, and good ole Donnie. Loved him in season 3. Great acting by ALL the actors. Excellent writing as well. Two biscuits and a cup of tea to this series. ;)

I look forward to see Tatiana and the rest of the cast in other shows - including the big screen - very soon.

I find her absolutely amazing and a talent that hasn't been given her due props.  I would love to see her in other projects as well.",1459209600,,438,4.636363636363637

But by the end of the season we see some mysteries resolved, others opened, and meet a new Leda clone.  That makes 12, I think, and I believe another will be introduced in season 4.
These are all virtuoso performances by Tatiana Maslany who earns 5 stars for the series all by herself.  But every aspect of the series is worthy of multiple awards and it's probably only the Canadian/BBC America origin that has limited its audience but it is fast becoming a cult classic.  The first two seasons are included with Amazon Prime, season 3 is well worth the price of admission.",1459209600,,690,4.496

7060023,5,B00UMDF01Y,"There's no way I can't give this 5 stars.  But I did like the earlier seasons more.  I think the first season is the best because you're just so blown away by the acting.  Season two reminded me too much of Dark Angel.  Both in terms of plot and feel.  In season three, they dropped that cyberpunk vibe of season two and it's more of a conspiracy theory thing.  It's kinda weird how the feel of the series keeps changing so much.  Thankfully though, they haven't changed the personalities of the clones.  At all.  By far my favorite clone is Alison, and if not for her and Helena I probably wouldn't even watch the series because truthfully the intrigue isn't all that interesting to me.  I mean, I've seen most of it before but that's just because I've seen so much sci fi.  I think Orphan Black will appeal much more to people who aren't big sci fi fans because some of the plotlines will be new to them.  That maybe sounded arrogant, but I didn't mean it that way.  I just mean that Comic Book Guy from the Simpsons might be unimpressed with Orphan Black but normal people will probably be blown away by it.  Plus, this year Alison's got a bee in her bonnet and goes all ""I'm the one knocking at the door"" Walter White.",1459123200,,1222,4.302631578947368

The plot was all over the place this season, but I enjoyed it a lot.  One question:  What does Mrs. S do for a living??  How can she be available at a moment's notice and also fly everyone to London without a thought to a job or even airfare?  Really liked her turn as a singer in the last episode.  She's a great character.",1458950400,,465,4.215909090909091

We have a finish to the Castor arc (I hope).  Presumably Season 4 will be about the puppet master.

7060131,3,B00UMDF01Y,"This show was very good for the first two seasons.  But I am now 3/4 of the way through season 3 and the plot has become so convoluted that I am having a really hard time following what's going on.  It doesn't help that they have introduced many more very similar looking characters to keep track of.  I am finding that it's not worth the effort.  If I were to rate the seasons individually, seasons 1 & 2 would get 4 stars and season 3 would get 2 stars.  Giving this 3 stars because the first 2 season were very good.",1456358400,,519,4.099009900990099

Completely distinctive personalities that elicit different ""relationships"" with this viewer.

7060168,5,B00UMDF01Y,"I would hope that most people have heard of Orphan Black by now. If you have not seen any of these series called Orphan Black, then you are in for a very pleasant surprise of adventure. Without giving away too much of the plot, this may be one of the better Sci-fi movies out today. Can an orphan, ever find one of their brothers or sisters? Probably, but your orphan sister is more like you, than you could ever imagine. I enjoy movies that are easy to follow, but the plot is deeper and keeps getting deeper and has more folds than a croissant. Such is Orphan Black, and by the end of the first year, you know only a small amount of what our heroine is going to experience, and the same is true in season two and season three. I greedily wait for season four, and then gobble all of the episodes up in one night. Then the next night to only start over; watching all of the episodes over to see what I missed. Orphan Black will be one series in which others will be measured by, one day.",1455321600,,988,4.151041666666667

7060177,5,B00UMDF01Y,"This series gets better with every season, and seemingly every episode. This is one of the very few dramatic/action type shows that I can watch over and over. The acting is incredible, especially on the part of Tatiana Maslany. She has incredible range, and it's hard to imagine anyone playing so many different personalities and characters so flawlessly. I know the show has gotten great critical reviews, but I can't believe that Maslany hasn't been cast in an Oscar-caliber movie by now. I can't wait for season 4 to come out. It seems impossible, but every season is better than the previous. I'm looking forward to seeing what happens next. I also know that Tatiana Maslany has an Improv background, which is especially evident in the behind the scenes footage. I would enjoy seeing how well she could do comedy, especially improvisation. The comedy on this show is quite funny, and partially improvised, but it's more of a drama/action show. One of the best on TV though. Best reason to watch BBC America.",1455062400,,1011,4.8497109826589595
7060178,4,B00UMDF01Y,"Season 3 continues this intriguing sci/fi thriller.  The concept is based in well established scientific fact and theory.  The lead actors are great and the female lead is phenomenal.  Her versatility is remarkable as she plays multiple female parts and also a male part.

I am glad the ""brothers"" were brought in.  There is a whole clone world we still have to explore.  What will season 4 bring?

This is definitely a show that I feel you cannot tune in late and expect to like.  You must begin at season 1 and you won't be disappointed.  I have convinced a few friends join the clone club.  Have always been a fan of British Television.

Helena is my favorite.  I would not want to mess with her.  She gave me the creeps in season 1 but by the end of season 3 I was rooting for her.  All the sisters have me rooting for them. Tune in - you'll be glad you did.  Season 4 where are you?",1451606400,,781,3.9548387096774196

Free seasons one and two hooked me,  I had to buy season 3 and eventually season 4 I guess, and I never buy videos or shows you know you'll not bother watching them again!  Tatiana is one wow actress, taking on such a variety of rolls in one series, what tough work.  but must be fun too.  Alison is one of my favorites, she adds the dark humor to the show in a rather Desperate Housewives sort of way. Felix too, what  guy!

7060332,5,B00UMDF01Y,"Recently finished binge watching seasons one through three. I'm speechless, but I'll try. Orphan Black is the best thing going on T.V. or in the movies. Tatiana is a one-woman show. Orphan Black shows the extremes humanity will go to gain power over others. Yet it also shows how far we'll go to find answers and to protect those we love. As a side-note, the show is not G-rated, but that doesn't detract from the power of its message.",1450569600,,435,4.518987341772152

I love her accent and how she's so loyal (kinda ;)) to her sistras.  But I love all of the characters she plays.  I never buy a season of anything, I just wait for it to be on prime or Netflix.

Helena is now one of my favorites and the development of her character and story-line really brought her home. At first I found her frightening and the source of nightmares. I won't give anything else away. The reason I did not give it 5 stars however is because I found the season dragged a bit. It took some weird turns: some sinister and some attempting to be comical. The season finale is jaw-dropping! It made watching season 3 worth it. Looking forward to season 4!,1449705600,2,544,4.561224489795919

No--make it - How many sisters does she have???---it is a dark and disturbing series, but well acted. Even the weirdo premise that there is a cloning factory is well done. The parts I don't think are done very well---the awful housing complex that looks like nothing in New York, kind of obvious there that it is filmed in Canada) - pseudo-military style bunker full of weirdo robotic demented bad clones, and the religious sect farm.....are even outweighed by the good parts.

In season three, the boy clones were boring, a great villain in the form of Dr. Aldous Leekie or Rachael Duncan just wasn't there, the latest Alison and Donnie Hendrix fiasco was droll, and, Shay was a poor choice after Delphine Cormier as Cosima's love interest.  I watched season three once.

It wraps up a story arc in a satisfying way but still leaves doors open for further exploration in succeeding seasons.

She imbues each of her characters with physical, facial, vocal and emotional uniqueness that makes them totally real.

7060518,5,B00UMDF01Y,"Sarah Manning and her clone-sisters find themselves caught in the crossfire between their very uneasy allies, the Dyad Institute, and a clandestine military experiment involving a batch of male clones. At the same time, Sarah is closing in on finding the origin of the cloning experiments, a mission that will take her far from home, to London and the deserts of Mexico.

The third season of Orphan Black opens and expands the world revealed in the opening two seasons, a world where secret experiments in the 1980s have resulted in the creation of two batches of clones. Now adults, the clones are finding one another and trying to discover the reasons for their existence, and those answers are not happy ones.

The first season of Orphan Black was unmitigated brilliance, a tour-de-force of acting ability as Tatiana Maslanay moved between playing multiple but very different characters with convincing ease. The second season stumbled a little by introducing too many new players, new characters and new factions. Sorting out the Proletheans from Dyad from mercenaries from military groups from Topside could be a little confusing at times.

The third season opens with these elements very much still in play, now expanded with the introduction of a group of new clones played by Ari Millen. What feels like it could become a confusing morass is abruptly reversed by some very, very smart writing decisions. The number of factions and storylines is abruptly slimmed down, some relatively convincing retcons are used to keep the same characters in play without having to bring in too many new faces and, whenever things could get too out of control, the show reels the story back in and refocuses on the core triumvirate of Sarah, Cosima and Alison. Indeed, the show knocks it out of the park with an episode that focuses on Alison's attempts to get elected as school trustee and mixes up the clones pretending to be one another, old-school style. It's extremely unusual to see a series self-aware enough to realise it's running into a problem, and then decisively fix it with both verve and intelligence.

There are a small number of new characters, most notably Ferdinand, an eccentric (but lethal) enforcer for topside played with relish by the always-brilliant James Frain, whilst British acting legend Alison Steadman joins the cast in the last couple of episodes in a pivotal role. Otherwise the focus remains on Tatiana Maslany's typically compelling multiple performances. This time around Ari Millen also has to play multiple characters and does a good job at it, even if the show backpedals a little from giving them the same time and variations that the female clones have.

By the end of the third season, the show has done away with a number of long-running storylines and potential long-term threats, although the finale does open things up by hinting at new dangers. With two seasons remaining in the showrunners' plan, it will be interesting to see where the story goes from here.

The third season of Orphan Black (*****) restores the show to the heights reached in the first season and is compelling viewing, not to mention being genuinely impressive in how it handles a few structural and writing issues that other shows would have simply let fester.",1445644800,,3272,4.983516483516484

7060581,5,B00UMDF01Y,"Orhpan Black with season 3 continues the great acting by Tatiana Maslany who somehow makes you forget she's one actress playing multiple characters as she introduces mannerisms and personalities completely unique to each one.  I found this season to be the most fun of the three so far with the introduction of a Breaking Bad style decision by one of the clones (I won't give away which one) which was just brilliant.  The male clones who unlike Sarah's ""sisters"" have always been aware of each other and share in a creepy way but still with distinct personalities were also acted well by Ari Millen, that you completely forgot they were being played by the same guy too.",1444608000,,671,4.726495726495727

Shows about conspiracies and secret plots typically become contrived and repetitive after one or more seasons. But Orphan Black hasn't gone that way yet, perhaps because the characters lives also play such a large role in the story.

Tatiana Maslany alone, in realizing her various clone sisters, each so remarkably distinct and genuine as if different actresses portray each of them, takes my breath away.

7060674,5,B00UMDF01Y,"Season three of Orphan Black is its most ambitious and intriguing yet. Introducing the Castor Clones at the end of season two ramped up the stakes of the show to an almost ridiculous degree. Ari Millen almost matches Tatiana Maslany for quality as he plays four clones over the course of the season.

The unveiling of a new Big Bad from the ashes of Dyad is a clever and surprising twist - as is an identifying characteristic they share. Also a cool revelation is the identity of the source for the DNA of for both Castor and Leda clones. James Frain steals every scene he's in - here's hoping he's back next season. His mercurial Ferdinand is an awesome character with a variable code of ethics.

7060699,4,B00UMDF01Y,"The premise of this show alone is nothing short of compelling, and the depth that Tatiana Maslany gives to each individual character is always entertaining.

My only complaint is a general frustration with the never ending pile-up of layers in plot. It just seems at times that too many questions are left unanswered while more still are mixed in. It can be daunting at times to think back to certain plot conclusions, or whether anything conclusive happened at all.

All in all, however, this show surprised me in its quality.",1443052800,,527,4.844444444444444

7060708,4,B00UMDF01Y,"OB started out with such a bang AND  would work best if there were an ""Orphan Black Marathon"" because with time spent waiting for the next 'year', memories fade.

The same could be said about the Walking Dead or any other ""WAIT FOR IT"" season of actually wanting to 'wait for it'.

7060768,5,B00UMDF01Y,"Amazing show, although I wish there were fewer scorpion scenes (it's creepy) and a bit less violence.  What I love is the strong female lead(s) and the phenomenal acting.  I was glued to the edge of my seat and wished the season was twice as long.  The science isn't always spot on, but the plot and production are great.  It has a pleasantly obvious feminist perspective that women are equal to men and are capable of being super tough and vulnerable at the same time.  I love Orphan Black.  In season 3 I screamed out loud at least 4 times (once 2x in the same episode).",1441929600,,572,4.349056603773585

7060814,5,B00UMDF01Y,"I thoroughly enjoyed season three. I spent an entire day binge watching all ten episodes and am totally hooked on this sci-fi conspiracy thriller about clones. The entire cast gives first rate performances, with special kudos going to Tatiana Manslany for her amazing characterization in so many different roles. Although the plot is at times somewhat convoluted and improbable, and there are also many twists and turns,  all of which may strain the viewer's credulity, it is still, nonetheless, highly entertaining. I can hardly wait for season four to begin!",1441497600,,560,5.222222222222222

7060847,4,B00UMDF01Y,"Season 3 seems to be losing steam in the clone story as ORPHAN BLACK hits the Season 3 Blues that so many hit shows have had in their third season. The writers are trying too odd to keep the story going with only sprinkling us with an occasional answer or hint. What is going on with the clones and their creation? How do we keep track of all the conspiracies and the conspirators conspiring against the conspirators? It is getting awfully convoluted to the point that I didn't want to care anymore. Yet, somehow the show keeps our interest as we try to sort it all out through some occasionally silliness. Don't get me started on Elena's friend the talking scorpion with the odd voice.
We can all agree that Tatiana Maslany is a talented and lovely actress who can easily portray several characters at one time. She is often in the same room with several versions of ""herself,"" and she does a fine job.
Season introduces several new characters. Yes, let's confuse things even more. Several characters come back in expanded roles and now we have the brother clones played by Ari Millens. Millens' brother clones must have presented a challenge since they were raised together and most have the same personality. Maslany's sister clones were raised in different countries so they may be similar each is unique.
We continue to wonder who can be trusted and who may seem evil but really is a victim or his or her circumstances.
The lovely Maria Doyle Kennedy as the mysterious Mrs. S continues to delight me as her role is expanded this season. Kyra Harper draws attention as a very distinctive looking Virginia Coady, the foster ""mother"" and tormentor of the brother clones.
I did find myself getting tired of all the new characters added and the new conspiracies to the point I thought I could not keep watching, but I did. There is enough of a spark to keep the viewer's interest. I have mixed feelings about Season 4. I have had enough of the clone wars.",1441152000,,1955,4.620689655172414

Tatiana Maslany, as always, does a marvelous series of character acting with each of the 'sisters' she portrays in the series.  I enjoyed seeing each of the sisters characters developing as the series evolves.",1441065600,,408,4.970588235294118

Tatiana Maslany as the female clones is awesome.  She deserves every award she gets and then some.  And, now, as it turns out, the male clone is also accomplished.

I think, however, by the third season, the show is starting to suffer from conspiracy fatigue and the plot is starting to unravel. The mysteries of the first season were suspenseful and intriguing, but by now every time something new happens, I just groan a little and wish for more Allison or Helena. I don't understand when exactly Sarah sleeps; Cosima is kind of boring; I want to slap Delphine and ... am I forgetting a clone? I feel like I'm forgetting a clone. Oh, Rachel.

The show seems to be on a loop and/or stuck in the mud.

The ""sisters"" learn more about their brother(s) and their origins (some of that, to me, had a rushed feel too it I thought), a couple of characters are killed off ( not sisters-  1 or 2 more of them introduced) not much seen of Sarah's daughter Kira or that cop Art.
I didn't like some of the Donnie & Allison storyline this season but like the rest- it had it's worthwhile moments too.

Season 1 introduced a really interesting science fiction/cyber punk world of futuristic technology, self directed evolution, humans with functional tails, serial coded and copy righted  synthetic DNA, etc.

In Season 3 almost all of the science fiction elements have been filtered out in favor of excessive torture and  a way played out government industrial complex global conspiracy story line. The episodes are  formulaic, a character is kidnapped, someone gets tortured,  blank makes a threat against blank by conveniently and instantaneously entering a private home, hospital room, office, etc.,  then ending with a cheap cliffhanger to add to an increasingly convoluted plot.",1439510400,2,763,5.461538461538462

This is an extended version of a very, very specific scene I will not spoil for those who have yet to see the season, but those who have know exactly what I'm talking about.

Sure, it's probably up on YouTube even as I type this, but give the people who produced the discs some credit: they know how to please the fans.

I mean, there's lots of other great bonuses on disc, too, and you already know whether you like the show enough to consider purchasing it at this point. But know that there is a God, and He hath blessed us with this clip.",1438905600,,965,4.440677966101695

7061064,5,B00UMDF01Y,"Sestra - Helena, from ""Orphan Black

Five MESMERIZING Stars. Season 3 of the Peabody Award-winning Sci-Fi drama Orphan Black continues to display the greatness of the award-winning Canadian actress Tatiana Maslany to the point that she should run away with the Emmy (WHICH SHE FINALLY DID WIN THE EMMY against Viola Davis, Claire Danes, and others) and other awards, based simply on the characterization of the amazing, demented towhead Helena', and adding in the rest of her amazing characterizations, it further reinforces her versatility. This is the role of a lifetime and she takes full advantage. Kudos also to the producers, the directors, writers, the mindblowing subtle cinematography and razon sharp editing. Season 3 also finds the storyline expanding and dividing itself with new characters, such as the unique Pupok, as the plot goes into expected areas and storylines. Some of the stories contain subplot sidetracks' that do not push the main storyline along and seem out of place, like the diverting surburban Hendrix subplot storyline. Shocking events abound with the storyline and with characters in this season that could well be a climax to the series. But Tatiana Maslany is the center of the action and she is brilliant in her acting. Highly Recommended. Five CAPTIVATING Stars. (Season 3, TV-MA, L-V for language, violence, gore and some socially-challenging situations, Color, Closed Captioned, 10 episodes (3 additional featurettes are not available from Amazon Instant Video: Season Recap; ""3 Questions , 2 Biscuits & 1 Cup of Tea"" with Maslany explaining the challenges of the roles; and Season 3 Trailer.)",1438300800,,1632,5.301158301158301

7061067,5,B00UMDF01Y,The fact that the actress is the same person and does a fantastic job of actually getting you believe that are all individuals in themselves with such diverse personalities and never even seeing an echo of the other characters portrayed...though I know their is a lot of behind the scenes help in pulling this altogether as well...it is amazing the seemingless transitions between characters that switched back and forth as well as her brother who I am sure is acting by himself having to react to the endless personalities whether in front of him or not.  Awesome team effort as well suspenseful action to drama...very well rounded show in every aspect and though it is Science Fiction it keeps you on the edge because some of the science has already actually being used.

7061090,5,B00UMDF01Y,"I generally am not wild about these government or corporate conspiracy oriented shows. However, this show has an element I've not seen done before and it is done masterfully. Maslany plays five characters and turns each of them into a character who you forget is playing the other four! It is a formidable piece of acting and she is very deservedly up for Emmy and hopefully might win it this time. These five characters are all part of this clone conspiracy. They are all clones who were created by scientists. The government appears to be involved as well. That is the murky part of the story but conspiracy stories are always like that. All of that is what Hitchcock used to call the MacGuffin. He meant it is a plot device to get everything off the ground to showcase the really interesting stuff. In this case that would be Maslany",1437782400,,836,4.58

7061095,4,B00UMDF01Y,"Orphan Black continues to be one of the best science fiction shows made. It actually involves science, for one, rather than just aliens with weird foreheads and strange new age-ism repackaged as far future science that looks like magic to us mere mortals. Biotechnology, ethics, and their intersection with humanity - where does humanity begin? What makes a human being an individual? - are things that concern us here and now, even if some of the plot elements are a little far-fetched.

Tatiana Maslany is probably my favorite actress at this point. We've all seen shows with one actor playing multiple roles, but Maslany plays roles within roles, and this is the first time I've ever seen someone play a character impersonating another character (both of whom she normally portrays) and seen an actual difference. The characters are believable and unique. I buy them as different people, rather than just an actor switching costumes. The writing and editing are great, but I have to give the real props to Maslany here. What a brilliant job!

That said, the shows has a few flaws. There are several characters written in almost solely for comic relief, and that just doesn't fit with the rest of the show's feel. Alison and her husband Donnie are just too corny. They exist almost solely to invoke laughter. It doesn't seem like they could inhabit the same universe as the rest of the characters. DYAD (the evil corporation) imprisons people, and then asks them to sign consent forms, which just doesn't make sense. The show seems to suggest that it is mostly set in the United States, and yet the license plates, the money, and some of the language, just doesn't work. One of the driver's licenses is even in English and French. When Cal is hacking the Internet in one scene, what he is really looking at is the source code for a web page, nothing more. Anyone who has ever designed a web page will spot it in an instant. The Season 3 ending was just too obvious, including the part they haven't revealed yet. Sorry, but the purposeful misdirection was just too heavy-handed. They've still never explained the monumental coincidence of two very important people in the show winding up on the same train platform in the very first episode.

That said, I want much more of this show, not less. Most science fiction these days is lazy and derivative. Orphan Black is smart, original and interesting. If you're interested in biotechnology and genetics, not to mention some fun suspense and action, then you really owe it to yourself to watch.

I'd give this show five stars, but a few of the things I mentioned here pulled me out of the story and I had to struggle to ignore them, which sadly reduces it to 4. Still, if you can forgive the occasional flaw, the rest of the show will have you wishing there were twice as many episodes per season. Give us more!",1437696000,,2859,4.700598802395209

7061139,5,B00UMDF01Y,"Orphan Black is by far the best show on television! The fact that Tatiana Maslany can play so many characters flawlessly, blows my mind. You don't even realize you are watching the same person! Tatiana ROCKS! You have to watch all three seasons of Orphan Black! You will not be disappointed!

SLIGHT SPOILERS AHEAD

This season we are introduced to a new set of clones: The Castor boys. This was an unexpected and at times disappointing twist. The first time I watched this season, I was sad that so much time was taken away from the Leda clones, but the second time through, I totally got it and really liked it! Delphine absolutely blows it out of the water this season! Holy hotness Dr. Cormier! She's tough and in charge, and of course beautiful. There is also the addition of another Leda clone this season who is sunshine, rainbows and kittens all rolled into one. Long live Krystal! That brings the Leda clone count up to 10 that Tatiana has played on screen, and a few others that we have seen passports of who are deceased.

For those new to the show, the characters Tatiana plays all by herself are: Beth, Katja, Sarah, Cosima, Alison, Rachel, Helena, Jennifer, Tony, and Krystal. If that alone doesn't make you want to watch, nothing will!

Orphan Black is a twist of mystery, comedy and a little bit of sci-fi, and the combination of all of those things makes it the best thing ever on TV. Believe me, you will not regret watching this show! :)",1437436800,5,1456,4.5458015267175576

7061142,5,B00UMDF01Y,An amazing show. Tatiana is amazing and has perfectly perfected each clone and her personality. You often forget she plays all the clones. The other casts members are brilliant and do a wonderful job playing opposite of Tatiana. If you like Sci Fi type shows and looking for a show with a lot of depth and a female lead this is the show for you. Cliffhangers in every episode. This show just keeps getting better. Can't wait for season four in 2016.,1437350400,3,449,4.487804878048781

7061188,3,B00UMDF01Y,"I really love the actors and characters in Orphan Black, but the story has really fallen off since season 1.  75% of the show is about the lead character Sarah and the quest to uncover the truth behind Dyad/Caster/etc, but then the other 25% is dedicated to the Hendrix family and their life in suburbia.  It's so random and feels completely disjointed from the main story.  The overall plot was full of twists and cliffhangers in the first season, but the last two have gotten kind of ridiculous (yes... I realize this is a Sci-Fi tv show), and I can't help but feel like they're making it up as they go along.  I'm committed to the series and will continue to watch, but I hope they go back to what made this such a tense and edgy show a few years ago.",1436918400,3,754,4.288732394366197

It is phenomenal and features complex female characters, SCIENCE!, an invigorating storyline, and LGBT characters that are there because they are good characters/whose plotlines are not ABOUT them being bi/trans/what-have-you. Which is awesome. As a queer feminist who has a crush on science, this show is perfect.

7061239,5,B00UMDF01Y,"The first season of Orphan Black was like a breath of fresh air in a world full of boring TV. Each season has posed new ethical and theoretical dilemmas that kept me thinking and made for thoroughly enjoyable viewing material. Tatiana Maslany is an acting savant and plays an increasing number of clones masterfully, and the new line of male clones is also done well.

I give five stars with only one point of apprehension; I don't believe the show needs to be as violent as the creators have made it. The message would still ring clearly without the show being so graphic.

Even with that in mind, Orphan Black is a cerebral show that's been done exceedingly well, and I look forward to season 4.",1436400000,2,697,4.523809523809524

By the second episode I was completely hooked. This season has actually outshone the previous seasons and that's hard to do considering how binge-worthy the first two were! I am completely in love with all of these characters (even the ""evil"" ones) and the storyline, although confusing, is absolutely fascination. The confusion actually translates well onto the viewer though because you will feel like you are part of the story, just as completely desperate and confused as the clones are! This is probably one of the most well casted shows I have ever watched. Not only does Tatiana Maslany shine in her various complex roles, but every other actor has brilliantly created their own unique characters that make for a well rounded, balanced, and absolutely addicting show.  I recommend this to anyone who enjoys an edge of your seat thriller without over the top violence. There's just the right amount of action, suspense, romance, and comedy to suit everyone's needs.

Tatiana Maslany is superb. While many actors or actresses seek to ""immerse"" themselves in one role so as to ""breathe life"" into their character, Maslany makes the seemingly impossible appear effortless with an entire eclectic ""Clone Club"" cast ensemble.

Though not really a part of season 3, Matt Frewer's uber-creepy performance as Dr. Aldus Leekie gives us a idea what would have happened if Randall Flagg (""the Walkin' Dude) had heavily medicated the ""Trashcan Man""  with anti-psychotics and given him an unlimited meta-genetic R&D budget in Steven King's ""The Stand"" ( http://www.amazon.com/Stephen-Kings-Stand/dp/B00BW4S8AC/ref=sr_1_1?s=movies-tv&ie=UTF8&qid=1436040070&sr=1-1&keywords=the+stand&pebp=1436040073197&perid=067RW3AQ14E2F7AVSCRA )

Production not as tight, characters not as sparkling and new twists in story line, are not as engaging. Ms. Maslany's characterization of the central character is great, while other characters seem ""added in"" for prerequisite screen time in a few episodes.

Love Love Love!!!",1435622400,,284,4.9375
7061362,3,B00UMDF01Y,"Still watching and enjoying but far less so than season one.  I have to agree with the other reviewers.  The characters aren't so much being developed as just behaving inconsistently.  Theres ""playing both sides"" and theres constantly turning on one side than the other.  Its confusing and lacks unbelievability.

The male clone story line is a snooze.  I have no idea what Delphine is doing in pretty much all of season three.  The drama with Paul is contrived...which is sad because he is so hot and yet his story line is so grating I can no longer enjoy his beauty.  Bringing Beth back so Sarah could cry over Paul lack of love for her some more......  Weren't we all done with that drama and revelation in season one?  The intrigue has become too convoluted, some story lines are repetitive, and its seems that every time the story line stalls new clones appear.

Still love Helena and everything else Maslany does, but the rest.....zzzzzzzzzzzz......Please make it interesting again.",1435536000,,988,4.8562874251497

While Tatiana Maslany is superb, as is the rest of the cast, it's just getting a little too twisty/trying too hard. Big plot ""twists"" aren't necessarily set up well enough. The whole male clone thing just kind of bored me. It's like taking the most unique and compelling thing about the show and saying, ""that worked well, let's just do it again,"" but none of the males clones are interesting and it's certainly more difficult for one actor to make as many physical changes as a man than as a woman.

I don't like any of the male clones and could care less about their developing lives.  They make you feel dirty just watching them bc they don't have any redeeming character, causing the viewer to lose hope.  Killing off Paul killed the show for me and all redemption was gone!",1435190400,,431,4.283950617283951

Not sure how she manages so much work as she plays numerous roles who are often interracting with one another.  You would swear they're all different actors. Fun series...

7061480,5,B00UMDF01Y,"This series blows my mind.  Tatiana Maslany plays multiple characters so distinctive its hard to believe she plays them all  She is one of the best if not THE best actress working today.  The idea of the show is so layered and interesting, the science well researched and believable, and the story-telling full of surprises.  It mixes comedy with hard-hitting drama, light quirkiness with acts of chilling suspense and brutal violence.  This show is a treasure and I cannot WAIT for season FOUR!",1435104000,,495,4.9156626506024095

7061486,5,B00UMDF01Y,My most fovoret British sci fi series. Love all of the character she places. Love Helena the most the crazy one. She is a trained assissian and loves to kill. She takes care of her sisters. It's all about genetics and cloning. Each character she plays is completely different from the other but all the same in looks in some way. I never miss an epsoide. I purchase the season pass and buy the dvd's.,1435017600,,400,4.346666666666667

7061488,5,B00UMDF01Y,"I have to say, I've stuck with it since season 1--when I became hooked after the first two episodes. Toward the end of season 2, things were kind of wandering a bit, except for Alison and Donny :>) I thought they would probably just kind of fizzle out, repeat themselves or get ridiculous. But, this season 3 is very strong. Stronger than 2 IMO so far. I just finished the 10th episode. Some very powerful stuff emotionally and shows that there is hope, even for the most disenfranchised of dystopia. Has the complexity to bring us beyond mere surface/ 2 dimensions/live-action comic book. It's believable/plausible like the best sci-fi and is very well written. The acting is also very strong. I am soooo pumped that this is getting a season 4, where I hope they keep the level of craft high.",1434931200,2,793,4.631205673758865

7061496,3,B00UMDF01Y,"I found the first season compelling but starting in season two the show lost its way. I think the writers ran out of ideas and had to add the religious cult. In season three they then added male clones. Alison who is I always dismissed as mere comic relief became the most interesting story line for me. There's still hope. The acting remains good and the characters are well developed. If you want to see season three, I would suggest reading plot summaries for the first episodes and then simply watching the last three, which were the best. I hope the writers can recapture the fire of the first season.",1434844800,,606,4.5181818181818185

7061499,5,B00UMDF01Y,"Not exactly high art, but if you're looking to have some fun and escape without anything too heavy weighing down the trip, this show is tough to beat. Mrs Maslany's craft in this series, when taken as a whole, is most admirable. These types of shows have a tendency to implode when they sacrifice good stories to feed our childish lust for a bigger, flashier, and more action packed season then the one before. Let's hope the writers can stay within the realms of reason and wit whilst stretching our imagination by nimbly dancing on the boundaries of real cutting edge science as they have deftly done to date.",1434758400,2,611,4.614678899082569

This show gives you a shot of gore now and again when you least expect it, so be warned. The plot is complex so start with Season 1 or you'll never get the full impact and keep the players straight. Very smart, wide-ranging and complex story line, with twists and unexpected turns, as well as laugh out loud moments!! How many shows can you say that about, right? If you have time read or watch online or here about how they film this series with body doubles, since Maslany, and now Ari Millan, play multiple characters each, often in the same room and very believably, too. Jordan Gavaris is still fabulous in this. mwah! What a wild show. Try to pick out one of the sestras you like more than the others, I dare ya'.",1434412800,,817,4.417218543046357

But this is still powerhouse television, and few actors are an equal to Tatiana Maslany. I honestly think she could have made Joss Whedon's misbegotten ""Dollhouse"" series more enjoyable. With great characters and a playful storyline filled with humor as well as noire-like bleakness, this is a series to cherish.",1434412800,2,528,4.943820224719101

7061559,4,B00UMDF01Y,"I enjoy this series a great deal.  I started watching it because it's Sci-Fi and I'm a complete Sci-Fi whore and will watch pretty much anything that claims to be science fiction.

That said, it's not very science fiction-y.  Yes there are clones.  If you don't know that you probably know absolutely nothing about the series, this isn't a big spoiler.

Some of the characters are put into a science-y setting but there's essentially zero futurism or science involved.

This is why I only give it four stars instead of five.  Don't get me wrong, this is a very good show both on a character interaction and development level as well as the tour de force about Tatiana playing the various clones.

This may be a good thing for many viewers.  I wish the impact of genetic manipulation were a little more involved than cloning for a mysterious project.",1434412800,2,849,4.644295302013423

7061573,3,B00UMDF01Y,"The first two seasons of Orphan Black were thoroughly enjoyable. I would have given them 4 or 5 stars. However, Season 3 seems to be getting a bit ""wobbly"" in the knees. The plot line has become cluttered and confusing. Hopefully, they will pull it out by the season finale which airs June 20, 2015.

Tatiana is definitely an incredible talent. They added another clone this season -- a beautician -- and she nails the performance perfectly. She is definitely holding the show together despite the plot flaws.

You MUST watch the first two seasons before venturing into this bizarre fantasy world. Otherwise, you are likely to be scratching your head and may  bail before the seasons finale.",1434412800,,691,4.838983050847458

7061618,5,B00UMDF01Y,"My wife and I look forward to each new episode every week. As you can tell by the five stars, I think this is great television, and Tatiana Maslany is amazing. Having said that, a few episodes turn out to be duds. The best are the ones where the clones interact in clever ways. Helena is a great wild card (I don't know if her or the wrapped-too-tight Alison is my favorite clone). Was her scorpion too much? Heck no! Those are the kind of touches that put a smile on our faces. What other show works Agricola into the plot, making nerds everywhere happy?

On the negative side, you would think Art the cop would be a useful asset as a link to the ""real world,"" but I guess Art retired to Florida, unless I've missed something. Mrs. S is an intriguing character that I keep waiting to be revealed as someone more than a babysitter with a small collection of firearms. (Maybe next week.) And while I understand the writers have to -- if I may use the term -- ""string us along,"" this is a viewer that needs to see his heroines (and heroes) score a real win once in awhile. Yes, I'm sure loyal viewers can cite big scores for our guys, but I'm mostly remembering frustration and defeat. (Although the promo for next episode looks intriguing!) It's a fine line on these kind of conspiracy shows.

7061679,4,B00UMDF01Y,"First season was fantastic - 5 stars.  Second season I was so bored with I FFW'd through half of it.  The writers have gotten lazy - nothing but panic and very little plot, humor or intrigue.  Hope they pull it out of the dregs soon!",1433721600,,233,4.133333333333334

7061682,5,B00UMDF01Y,Each of Tatiana Maslany's role characters are totally believable as individuals. One is totally immersed with the story line of each of these clones. Great acting on her part. BBCA does it again. Love this series.,1433721600,,213,4.944444444444445

7061692,5,B00UMDF01Y,"I follow several quality series.  This is at the top of the list.  It can difficult to follow (too many plot twists), but when it comes back to the Leda clones working together it grounds itself.  Tatiana Maslany cannot be praised enough for her work.",1433721600,,251,4.533333333333333
7061693,4,B00UMDF01Y,"It has been a 5-star series up to season 3.  It feels like they are struggling to find a direction so far with season 3, but Tatiana Maslany  is their saving grace!  Hopefully,  everything will come together as the season progresses.",1433721600,,233,4.609756097560975
7061694,5,B00UMDF01Y,"One of the best shows I've ever watched! For starters, the storyline. Hooked from season1, episode1- written so brilliantly with so many intricate details, the writers are to be applauded!!! You don't want to miss a moment and you simply can't predict what will happen next.
 The actors. Tatiana Maslany is indescribably talented. Her ability to play so many vastly different characters is beyond impressive. The nuances that she uses to become a completely different person leaves you in awe.  Also later also Ari Millen  does an excellent job at also playing multiple roles, down to the crazy in his eyes one moment,  fear or sustain or respect the next. It's truly truly impressive. (And that is a weak compliment! ) Jordan  Galashiels 'Felix' is a perfect and irreplaceable as the support system to not just his sis  Sara, but basically every person on the show ends up needing a Felix -fix at one point or another. Maria Doyle Kennedy is all grown up from her time with the band The Commitments. Now she is a serious badass mama who will protect her cubs at any and every cost. I could continue but,  no spoliers!!! Just watch it!",1433721600,,1135,4.702020202020202
7061695,5,B00UMDF01Y,"Just when I thought it couldn't get better with more twists, it did.  Tatiana Maulana is the most amazingly versatile actress and I can only hope the ""Castor"" brothers can show as much variety in their personalities as the ""Leda"" clones.  The supporting cast is not bolstering the story, but a show in themselves,  especially Felix and Mrs. S.  The girl who plays Kiera is already superb as an actress who conveys her character's many layers, disguised in innocence and childhood.",1433721600,14,480,4.888888888888889

The writing, acting, production, direction, and design are all top notch and work together seamlessly to create a powerful story. Orphan Black is compelling. It has a strong plot and consistent character development. It builds tension and keeps you wanting more. Seeing Tatiana Maslany transform into all these different characters is truly amazing. It's a quality scifi, suspense, drama, and comedy all rolled into one. And it features badass women in protagonist roles, when, so often, shows and movies only feature men in these sorts of roles.

7061784,1,B00UMDF01Y,"First two seasons were great, season 3 falls terribly short. Boring and inconsist characters, plots and dialog are silly to the point where the acting stinks--Maslany is incredible and she can't even save it.

Seems like the writers ran out of ideas--or handed things off to their interns.

The idea of male clones was intriguing--but seems more like it marks the point where the show jumped the shark. The suspense that kept me wanting more in season 1 & 2 is gone. I'm not going to watch it anymore.",1433030400,7,501,4.617977528089888

7061796,5,B00UMDF01Y,"Unified but complex plot, plus performance by Tatami Maslany, make this one of the best shows on TV. What puts it on top is the application of the notion that, given the nature of humanity, science is likely to create a nightmare future",1432944000,,236,4.511627906976744

Which tells you something about the acting of Tatiana Maslany; many, many people have commented on her brilliant acting, I probably cannot add much to that, other than to say that her body of work in this SINGLE series outstrips 90 percent of totality work of every other actor or actress I have ever seen. Thats probably not the best sentence but really top-notch, insightful phrases escape mehaving spent two months wrapped up in a big project which usurped all of my time and attention and in general made my life miserable; I really needed an escape. I just tripped over this series having seen something on Facebook about itwow just WOW.

Another reviewer compared it to other series she had really been hooked on; her tastes are remarkably similar to mine;

New Battlestar Gallactica (so much better than the original)
X-Files
Fringe
Babylon 5
Lost
Terminator (Sarah Conner Chronicles)
This show is ostensibly sci-fi but its really more about the drama of discovery and the many permutations of understanding as you investigate a mystery.

SPOILER>>>>>

Season 3 Ep 1; the scene between Cosima and Delphine at the doorway to Felix' place; the emotions that play across Cosimas face in the space of 10 secondsthe glimmer of hope, the light of understanding, the pain of knowledge, the confession of love. Perhaps the strongest single scene in the series, perhaps the strongest I have ever seen on the small screen.  I will be a Tatiana Maslany fan for the rest of my life.

7061900,3,B00UMDF01Y,"It seems obligatory to praise Tatiana Maslany at the start of every review of this show - even negative reviews - so I will follow suit. I am not a television scholar but I am not aware of any television show where a single actor or actress was asked to play five characters and bring some degree of individuality to each of them. Maslany does a masterful job. As many reviewers have said - and I will say again - I usually forget the parts are played by a single actress, the individual personalities are so distinct. Helena and Alison are especially well defined, interesting, and funny. Even if there were no plot one could still enjoy watching this show the same way one might enjoy watching a juggler keep five balls in the air at the same time while making it appear effortless. Maslany deserves all the praise she has received and that remains true of her performances in season 3.

But there is a plot to the show (thankfully) and for the first two seasons I found that plot gripping. However, I could see that there was potentially trouble ahead. Any show that begins with the premise of a secret conspiracy tends to fall victim to the same trap: the writers have to keep revealing things to the audience, but they always have to imply that there is more to be discovered, otherwise people would stop watching, and so the conspiracies become ever wider and more complex and ultimately the motivations of the secret conspirators become hard to fathom or ludicrous (Even The X-Files succumbed to this dilemma in its later seasons). The story lines also become much more convoluted and hard to follow. This season is beginning to fall prey to those familiar patterns (Lost anyone?and I don't mean Are you lost? but rather Remember the show Lost?)

One problem I sensed with the show from the beginning is: the conspirators are not really doing anything horrible enough to warrant their extreme secrecy or their brutal tactics. They have created human clones - and one can understand why they would want to keep that hidden. I am willing to go along with the show that far. But the motivation of all the secret organizations seems to be to figure out why the clones are infertile, get sick, and die prematurely, and do something about it. With such good intentions it is hard to understand why they need to resort to kidnappings and strong arm tactics. In Season 3 the conspirators kidnap Helena and Sarah and keep them locked in prison cells. What do they do to Sarah once they get her in their grasp? Well, they take a blood sample. Perhaps there would have been a simpler, and less violent way, to get a blood sampleone might try asking first, for example. If they wanted to kill Sarah and harvest her organs one could understand why they might kidnap her and lock her in a cell, presumably in Afghanistan or some other far away place, but, if they simply wanted a blood sample in order to keep Sarahs genetic twins from dyingwell, like I said, I would have asked first, and made kidnapping and torture my plan B.

I also am really missing Rachel in this season. In order to make up for the loss of Rachel we now have the clone brothers and Dr. Virginia Coady but they lack the spark that made Rachel such an interesting character (they lack Maslany!). As another reviewer here on amazon pointed out: the clone brothers are essentially indistinguishable from each other, except for physical markers that serve as clues, and Dr. Virginia Coady is a bit dull. I am finding most of the storylines to be relatively unremarkable as well. I do enjoy watching Helenas resourcefulness in prison and her interactions with the prison guards and I always enjoy watching Alison and Donnie. Their story-line this season is the one real success in my opinion. It is great fun watching Alison run for office while they both try to start a drug dealing business. Overall, though, this season has been a little disappointing thus far though there is certainly still time to turn it around. To end my review, I will offer one final prayer that Rachel might rise from her own ashes in a brilliant and fiery resurgence! That is all.",1432425600,71,4120,4.618008185538882

Each time I see one of the ""sestra"" (clone/sister), I actually see a completely different person. Tatiana Maslany is amazing. I don't know how she does it.

Season 3:  On the flip side, the male clones are not so convincing and not nearly as entertaining or likeable. All the male clones seem to look and act alike, without much distinction in personality. Except for the different clothing, I usually can't tell who is who.  But I guess it's a nice twist to add male clones, but I would have liked it better if Felix was a clone.",1431907200,,654,4.508474576271187

Season Three has not ceased to please, the thrilling series continues to surprise, awe, and sincerely touch the heart, especially through characters like Kira and Cal who give their hearts and souls to save their family, just as Sarah does to save her troubled sister, Helena, throughout the beginning of this season. Orphan Black never ends an episode without some type of stupefying curveball, and always leaves my mind wondering, questioning, and aching for more the rest of the week. I can't wait to see what type of new chapter this season unfolds (: Tatiana Maslany is a genuinely gifted actress; the clone brothers Mark, Miller, Rudy, and Seth are close runner-ups; and the rest of the cast and crew must work their butts off to make this show what it is, since every episode turns out magnificently.
The scientific biological aspect of this show is incredible, a fascinating touch and basis of all the mystery that provokes viewers' brains to think and inquire about their own genes and natural characteristics, while glorifying the beauty of such a different kind of being as the clones.

We are amused by the Russian sistra.  We just love the show! We think it is even better and very action packed!

7061993,5,B00UMDF01Y,ORPHAN BLACK Season 3 - is an extraordinary ride.  It is full with constant surprises. This coupled with the Virtuoso Performance from Tatiana Maslany - which is riveting in all it's depth and sincere characterizations.

7061995,3,B00UMDF01Y,"the first two seasons were much stronger. I don't see the point of the male clones who are indistinguishable.  the whole power of the female clones was how they are played so brilliantly as distinct characters by Maslany.  i still love Maslany, and like some of the sub stories--particularly around Helena and Allison. but overall a bit disappointing so far",1431648000,7,357,4.933333333333334

7062002,5,B00UMDF01Y,"When I began watching Orphan Black, I was prepared to be disappointed.  The brief description of the series sounded interesting, but also seemed to have the potential to devolve into something unwatchable.  I was more than pleasantly surprised.  Tatiana Maslany is incredible in her multiple roles as clones.  The entire series is simply fascinating.  I very rarely purchase a season of TV; I usually wait until I can watch for free.  I don't subscribe to cable, nor do I normally watch a lot of TV.  I usually watch movies.  But, I have Roku, and with my Amazon Prime subscription, I got the first two seasons, so I did feel it was worth it to purchase this one.  I simply didn't want to wait to find out where they were going with Season 3.

The series is very well done.  By premise, one can classify it as science fiction, but it could as easily be classified as drama, action or suspense. I was particularly pleased with all the very strong female characters. But, without giving anything away, I think the exploration of the nature vs. nurture argument about what makes each of us who we are is fascinating.

I would definitely recommend Orphan Black to others; it's a great series and Tatiana Maslany is exquisite.",1431475200,6,1221,4.654205607476635

7062071,4,B00UMDF01Y,"Darker and more exploratory than ever, Orphan Black plunges into its third season with themes of war and autonomy honed to a knife's edge...and then drops the knife.

I should have expected this after the writer's lackluster season 2 finale, where each of the clones come together after weeks of emotional trauma and dance like no one's watching--but I was watching, and as Helena put the hem of her dress into her mouth, I wished I wasn't. Tatiana Maslany is a legend. She carries this show and its trailing plot threads on her back with the grace of Atlas. Her dedication and emotional aptitude makes even the most boring of writing decisions interesting. (Helena and Donnie, anyone? Watch season 1 and ask yourself: Did you see that coming?) If this show had any other actress carrying it, these writing decisions would be so blaring I would have no choice but to stop watching.

My main interest in the show revolves around Sarah, Helena, and Rachel as I am invested in the emotional bond between the twins and they have the most compelling story line...until the blondes are used for comedic relief (pencil jokes? And again, Helena and Donnie??). So the end of season 3 felt like it was designed for an entirely different audience.

I am thrilled to watch season 4, and I'll hope for a season 5 (as long as Helena's character development isn't massacred too much) because despite it's flaws, this show remains the most unique and compelling piece of media on my computer screen.",1430956800,,1483,4.762645914396887

7062255,2,B00UMDF01Y,"I'm a big fan of ""Orphan Black"", and I think Tatiana Maslany does a fabulous job.  She portrays each of the clones so distinctly that I sometimes forget it's the same actress playing them all.  She certainly deserves an Emmy nomination.

After the great first and second seasons of the show, I couldn't wait for season three to start.  However, the season 3 opener ended up being a big disappointment.  There seemed to be no continuity with the prior seasons.  I'm sure the writers have a plot destination that they're headed toward, but it seemed like they just dumped six or seven new story arcs and a number of new characters into the first episode without any context or tie-back to the previous story-lines.

I'm not giving up on the show yet, but I am hoping that the writers get focused, and start to slowly and more thoroughly develop the concepts introduced. Maybe then, I can finally figure out what the heck is going on :)",1429833600,6,933,4.5843373493975905

their creator company. Tatiana is amazing playing the
multiple roles of all the sisters!",1429833600,,143,5.260869565217392
7062260,5,B00UMDF01Y,"First off, thank you to Amazon for carrying this series since my idiot cable company dropped BBC America from its channel line up this year.

Second, season 3 starts of fast and picks right up where season 2 leaves off. That's wonderful because I hate it when a series skips a lot of time between seasons and leaves you scrambling to fill in the blanks on the missing time. So you flow right into season 3 like there was no break, and 1 episode in there promises to be no let down in the action. (The opening scene does have you wondering what the heck is going on, but once you get through it you'll see that it makes sense and butts right up against the end of season 2)

The real joy of the show comes in the acting of Tatiana Maslany. Well, the whole cast is brilliant in their respective roles, but Maslany is PHENOMINAL in all of her 8+ roles! She plays a variety of different characters (the various clones) and despite them all looking alike Maslany gives each one of them a completely unique identiy. It's incredible how multiple characters with the same face played by the same woman can be so entirely different from one another. The range Maslany shows as an actress is absolutely incredible. It's certainly not just a wig and a different voice for each one. Each character has her own unique personality and identiy, complete with her own quirks. And Maslany never mixes up her characters.

She is so good that you actually forget that the various clones are all played by the same actress! And they are incredibly different. Different backgrounds, different accents, one is completely psychotic...and still you forget they are all the same actress.

Let's just hope the ratings stay strong enough to carry the series. The plan is 5 seasons to wrap up the entire story line. But ratings for the season 3 premier weren't great on BBC America (Likely due to idiot cable companies dropping the channel)",1429833600,40,1912,4.5982404692082115
7062261,5,B00UMDF01Y,"I bought season 3 after watching  seasons 1 & 2 within a week. WHEW!  This is a wonderful show and she's a SUPER actress!  I keep changing which character I like the best but I'm back to Helena (I guess that says something about myself ... but I won't dwell on it).  Surprisingly I like Felix as the top  male role and hope we get to see more of him in season 3.
The only downside to the show is that some of the accents are so ""British heavy"" that I couldn't process the conversations, but I took care of that with CC and I know who to look out for with accents.  Otherwise I look forward a great show and hopefully many more seasons.",1429833600,,635,4.04

Not since Lost's 1st season has there been a show so filled with fantastic ideas and consistently original stories.  But the acting in OB elevates it to the level of classic TV, timeless drama, iconic science fiction.  Tatiana Maslany is so brilliant that there are no words to describe her, and every single cast member inhabits her or his character in a career-defining way. Only 3 more hours to season 3 - just enough for me to finish re-watching the 1st 2 seasons for the 3rd time.",1429315200,2,554,4.421568627450981

7062350,5,B00UMDF01Y,"""Orphan Black is a show that I would be unlikely to watch. Not my choice of viewing fare"". These were my thoughts when the BBCA started promoting OB for the first season. I was running out of shows I do enjoy, and thought I'd just take a chance, step outside my viewing comfort zone and give OB a try. Major score on my part. The show has a nice little plot line that could quickly grow stale if mishandled. The direction, filming and writing have been outstanding from the start. There's no notable difference from episode 1, season 1 than the end of season 2. The cast? I'm sure many have read the reviews, the feedback on the cast and if you think it's all media hype, you're mistaken. And yes, Tatiana Maslany is everything she's stated to be and more. How in the world she's not been nominated for an Emmy is beyond me but her fans and the fans of Orphan Black are all she really needs. She'll do more in the future but please, let's not get too far ahead. We need many more seasons of Orphan Black. Tatiana, if you read this, make sure your paycheck is a reflection of your talent and your popularity. If it's not, send Helena around to your agents office to, well, you know.",1428969600,185,1181,4.300448430493273

Also, I am so pleased that women are actual people in this show for once.
What a casting. Tatiana Maslany is doing an amazing work here. Jordan Gavaris brings so much in his character as well, and it is such a pleasure to be able to love a character without any reservation. I hope that Felix will get an even bigger part in this season. Also, more science please!
Many scenes are daring and bold without shocking for shocking. Many scenes mix the witty and funny with depth.

One topic that wasn't explored in depth and creatively was the characters' feelings and ideas about parenting. We had the stereotypes of ""the women wanting babies"", ""the parents who cherish their children and try to protect them/ be reunited"", the abusive crazy father. But we didn't go sideways, though there were some opportunities with Allison's realizations and Sarah's past shortcomings. The actual children are not much more defined than by ""young and loved"".
The property of one's body is a central matter in this show. Not only being infertile or being used for procreation against one's will, but also being fertile and motherhood itself often threaten or diminish a woman's ownership of her body. The mother is somehow treated as property, her body as biological supply by the fetus then by the child. I think that there might be an interesting direction to explore here.",1428796800,7,1496,4.776061776061776

And I watched, for seven and a half hours straight. The first time. I watched the first season four times in the two weeks before the second season started. It's that good. Tatiana Maslany is amazing as Sarah, Cosima, Helena, Allison, Beth, Rachel, Katya, Jennifer, etc. (Don't worry, you won't have to keep up with all of those characters!) Before she opens her mouth you can tell which of the characters she's channeling, not because of the different hairstyles or clothes, but because she's made them each a different woman. When I watch the show, it's so easy to believe I'm watching different actors playing different characters. When Allison steps in to help Sarah, by pretending she is Sarah, what you see is Allison pretending to be Sarah, not Tatiana being Sarah. The entire cast is brilliant, and they each hold their own against these crazy women, or for them. This isn't a show about clones, but about the relationships,  and the terror the truth brings these women and those that love, and hate, them. Start on Season one now.

8707410,4,B00UMDF01Y,"I just finished the last season and it was very entertaining watching Tatiana play all of the clone sisters though some were much better than others you're never seeing one long enough thats its a problem. The plot is about clones, competing forces, issues and the ever present family and/or domestic crisis. A very good supporting cast keeps it together and if theres a fault it would be the humor is not always present but when it is its a real boost to the show. The last season seemed rushed, over the top and pretty devoid of humor. Its a good sci-fi thriller and through the course of the show it was sometimes hard to tell the same person was playing all the roles because the transformations were so good. Overall, it was a 4-star series but the last one is a real push to give it 3-stars. There are a few characters that I found to be annoying and there was much too much of them toward the end. If nothing else, it was worth it just for the uniqueness of the plot and how well it was done by Tatiana. It took us four years to see the entire series so Im copping out with the same review for each because my mind is too blurry to address each one specifically and if you like the first one you will watch the others despite what anyone has to say about it.",1527465600,,1265,4.209876543209877
