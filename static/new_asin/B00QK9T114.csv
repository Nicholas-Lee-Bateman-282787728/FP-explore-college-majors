8691781,5,B00QK9T114,"This movie is a real hoot.  The producers wanted to make a re-make of ""My Fair Lady"" but how can you possibly do that?  Who makes a remake of one of the greatest musicals ever?  Why would you even try?  Masauki Suo (Shall We Dance?) tries and succeeds.
So they made it so silly that you just can't help but enjoy it.  Haruko is the Elisa Doolittle part.  She is a young girl with a completely incomprehensible dialect that alternates between those spoken in the  Northern and Southern extremes of Japan, who wants to move to Kyoto and become a Maiko: one of Kyoto's celebrated singing and dancing entertainers.  But she has to learn Kyoto dialect in order to do so.  In fact, she has to convince everyone that she was born and raised in Kyoto.  So Professor Kyono, (the Henry Higgins) takes it upon himself to teach her.
The singing and dancing is all for fun and it is a great frolic.
The Japanese subtitles are helpful, even if you speak Japanese, because the film is performed mostly in dialects.  I lived in Kyoto for a few years, so I could follow the Kyoto dialect fairly well, but the other dialects left me baffled, so I turned the subtitles on.
Watch for the tip of the hat to ""Shall We Dance"" in the finale!
