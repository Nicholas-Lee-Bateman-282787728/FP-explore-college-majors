3748133,5,B001PKHS86,"I for one am THRILLED to learn of another volume of the series. Would I prefer the original music? Of course. But I am happy to have the episodes in any form whatsoever. Frankly, I had no idea that the music in the last volume was not original until I later read the comments.

It's fine to be a purist and turn up your nose at the new releases if you've got your little cache of VHS tapes to fall back on. Not all of us do. Music is one element of the show, but it's a supporting element--it's the writing and the acting that are in the forefront. Those are still on display in all their glory, and I can't wait for the next installment of this marvelous series.",1233619200,5,663,4.1
3748134,1,B001PKHS86,"I am going to wait and see the reviews on Season 2 Vol 2 about the deleted music and THEN I will make my decision whether to buy it or not.  If CBS has not got the message by now after all the negative reviews from the previous releases about keeping all the original music in, they never will!  And I will not buy the Fugitive on DVD EVER again and just watch them on my VHS tapes I recorded off the A&E network. Thank goodness I saved my tapes!!!

I read a statement from CBS/Paramount where it will be redone with MUCH? of the music restored.  Not ALL???  For the amount of money they are charging, especially being broken up into volumes, I want ALL of the music in!!!!  They did just fine with Season 1 Volume 1.  Why can't they do the same from here on???  I will sit at sidelines and see what the reviews are from the buyers BEFORE I buy.  If it is not good, I will keep watching the Fugitive on my VHS tapes I recorded off A&E.  At least I can say, THEY did a good job!

Well, I got my replacement discs with the correct music (most not all).  The episode, The Iron Maiden has the synthesizer music on 3/4 of the episode.  I guess CBS tricked me into thinking that if they did the last couple of episodes on this set with the synthesizers and I overlooked watching it, thinking that all the episodes were untouched, then they will think I will give it a good review.  THEY ARE WRONG!!!!  CBS,Paramount ruined the theme to the show by adding this crappy music!  There still are negative reviews about Season Two Volume Two and I CERTAINLY will hold off on buying anymore future episodes until the all the music is put back in!!! I AM SERIOUS!!! If this replacement disc program didn't do anything to wake up CBS/Paramount, then they never will.  It will be business as usual at CBS/Paramount.  All they are doing is hurting themselves because of the much fewer discs that they anticipate on selling to the public! (Including me).  Money talks and BS walks!!!!!!

CBS,Paramount, LEAVE THE ORIGINAL MUSIC ALONE!!!!!!!!!!!!100%",1233273600,10,2031,4.408602150537634
3748135,1,B001PKHS86,"Updated review
The announcement has been made as of February 17, 2009 - Our voices have been heard and it has happened!  The original music has been restored to the wonderful Fugitive series starring David Janseen.  I am changing this review to ***** (5) stars with anticipation that the original Pete Rugolo music has been restored.
Thank you CBS/Paramount!

Old review
I just tried again to watch season two vol one of the fugitive. It was depressing! The person that commented that the music of Peter Ruggulo was half the show was absolutely correct.  The music is wiped out clean on this volume. I would only want to say that I am routing for Cbs to return the original music to the fugitive.  We will be very grateful.",1233187200,10,723,4.6171875
3748136,5,B001PKHS86,"I LOVE the Fugitive and want Paramount to release all 4 seasons. I will buy this release, as it's the show that counts.",1233100800,3,119,4.217391304347826
3748137,1,B001PKHS86,"Since they haven't re-released Season 2 Vol. 2 the way it should have been done I very much doubt they will have properly restored the original music for this one. The cover looks good, and the picture quality will look lovely, but replacing the original music with this fake synthesizer rubbish is an absolute disgrace. Please do not buy this as Paramount have completely ruined this great show, which is now unwatchable.",1233100800,11,422,4.875
3748138,3,B001PKHS86,"I'll buy this item, but only if that awful musical travesty that totally ruined ""The Fugitive Season Two Volume One"" is gone and the original incredible musical score remains.

3748139,5,B001PKHS86,"I can understand all the opinions expressed here concerning the re-recording of the music score...I, too, wish the original score was left intact...but I really don't believe in ganging up on the video companies for doing this when we really don't know the exact reasons for why it's being done. Maybe it just has to be for reasons beyond their control. I was halfway through watching season two, part one before I even realized the music might be different. I thought they at least did a good enough job in creating the same mood and sound as the original music had. I still enjoyed the set very much. At least the original theme music was left in tact at the beginning and the end of each episode and, in my opinion, that's much more important! The theme music is much too well known to change and I think I would have been A LOT more dissapointed had this been changed as well. To me, it just wouldn't be the same ""Fugitive"" without the familiar theme music. The rest of the score being changed I can at least tolerate.",1233014400,8,1022,4.441489361702128

3748184,5,B001PKHS86,"When I first started considering getting this entire series (the Most Wanted wasn't out yet), I agreed with those who complained about the butchering of the music, especially Season 2 Vol. 1. But I thought, ""Oh well, it won't be so bad.""

But after enjoying Season 1, vols. 1-2, I really did have a major problem with that replacement music. So heavy-handed, so over the top in places.....and just so tacky (But I thank my lucky stars I didn't get the synthesizer music!).

Now I've just started with Season 2, vol. 2, and it's like coming home again. Okay, there may still be music cues that aren't original.....but I can more than live with this one. It's a joy to hear Rugolo's music again!

The stories are excellent, acting likewise.......love this show!

While sitting through Season 2, vol. 1, I was seriously considering splurging for the Most Wanted Edition....but so many reviews complain of major problems.....I guess I'll just have suffer bravely next time I sit through Season 2, vol. 1

  It's Good TV! (see my other reviews). The bits of commentary/narration at the beginning and end of the episodes, I just love 'em.  If you haven't seen The Fugitive, you are missing out.

3748194,1,B001PKHS86,"The Season 2 Fugitive DVDs are a complete disappointment due to the replacement music. For a short time, CBS was offering to exchange Volume One for an edition with more, but not all, of the original music.  I had bought Volume One as soon as it was released, and I was not aware of the exchange policy until after the Sep 2009 deadline.  Instead, I bought a second Volume One from Amazon under the assumption that it had the original music. WRONG!  They're still selling the edition with the replacement music.

Volume Two proved to be almost as bad as far as the replacement music is concerned.

Since then, I've dug out my old A&E Network Fugitive VCR recordings from the early '90s. They're a much more enjoyable way to see the series without having to be periodically jarred by out-of-place music.  Obviously, I've given up buying anymore of this CBS reissue. They've made a complete mess out of this series.",1283904000,6,913,4.6397515527950315
3748195,1,B001PKHS86,"I just finished watching The Fugitive - season two, vol. one, which I purchased only after finding out that CBS would offer replacement discs with the original music restored. I am now ready for season two, vol. two. Unfortunately CBS, for some reason, has decided not to release this set with the original music intact. Why? Perhaps it's too expensive to secure the music rights. Perhaps it's because not enough people knew about the altered music or bothered to voice their concern. Perhaps it's because enough people bowed to the studio and wrote 5-star reviews that placed an inferior product high on a pedestal and, in a strange twist of logic, criticized those who sought to uphold the importance of artistic integrity. Perhaps CBS is smiling in the knowledge that their customer base consists largely of the uninformed and better yet, those who are informed, but choose to huddle together like frightened sheep, fearful that if they step out of line they might be deprived of something they think they need.

So for what it's worth, let me add my name to the many before me that are willing to stand up for what is right and do justice to a time-honored television series that deserves no less. There will forever be a gap in my collection because I refused to compromise. I refused to take the easy way out and pretend that it didn't matter.",1259971200,8,1349,4.716101694915254
3748196,5,B001PKHS86,"Have now watched over half of this edition. Although it's a while since I've seen my video collection most of these episodes are instantly familiar, but they come up fresh and are as superb now as they ever were.

One of the strengths of the QM productions was the top notch casts lists and it's pleasantly nostalgic to see all those old familiar character actors again. And of course the wonderful David Janssen.

The transfers are generally very good and bright. The packaging is nice and economical and I can't wait for the completion of this enterprise so that I can trash my videos and free up some space.

Regarding the music, I deliberately am NOT comparing with my videos, but am just viewing these episodes with an impartial ear. CBS have responded to the world-wide protests by including all of Peter Rugolo's specially composed cues, which are marvellous and so familiar to all fans. Other experts have voiced concerns over some replacement cues for non-Rugolo ones but I have to say that to my ears the episodes sound fine.

I was one of those who joined in the protests and complained to CBS, but my view is that we should now be grateful that this series is being completed. ""The Fugitive"" is obviously a problem child for CBS, but we should recognise that they are a commercial operation not a charity and they obviously have to balance satisfying the demand for this series with a hard-headed realism not to pay out large sums to opportunistic copyright holders of obscure music cues.

If another company does eventually bring out a perfect ""night of broadcast"" series then if any of us original baby boomers are around we'll obviously buy it, but I have my doubts as to whether we'll ever see that.

Let's celebrate one of the best dramatic series of all time and omwards to the completion of the two remaining seasons!",1253145600,,1836,4.686335403726708

I am waiting for the additional releases to complete my collection, as they are released in two volumes for each season to squeeze our wallets. Still, this is an important collection and you should add them to your library. Great stories, guest stars and directors who are now famous, make these releases a must have.

3748198,2,B001PKHS86,"One should keep in mind that, CBS is most likely still selling the re-scored DVD copies of Season 2, Vol. 1 in stores, and are ONLY creating enough replacement discs for those who take the effort to mail in a request for one, or actually just burning replacement copies PER mailed-in request!!

So I had assumed that Season 2, Vol. 2 would end up the way it is, since the composers that CBS hired had obviously re-scored the entire season before-hand, and CBS would simply sprinkle back in a few original cues for each episode, just enough to appease caring fans and quiet the complaints (IT DIDN'T WORK!!), while keeping the costs of restoring all of the original cues to a minimum, for MASS distribution of the DVDs.

However, Season 3 Vol. 1 is scheduled for release on October 27, 2009, and all I can say to CBS is: DON'T MESS WITH THE ORIGINAL CUES, IF YOU DON'T WANT TO LOSE ANY MORE BUSINESS!!",1249776000,7,900,4.4817073170731705

3748200,5,B001PKHS86,"At long last, the groundbreaking television series, ""The Fugitive"" comes to DVD. This show, which lasted from 1963-1967, was suspenseful, moving, engaging, and original. This was the first successful television show that took the dramatic formula of putting the hero with new characters and in new situations every week to another level. In previous shows such as Cheyenne, Maverick, and many others, the hero was a wanderer going from town to town to earn a living. In this show, the hero had no choice. He had to run to stay out of jail.

Charged with murdering his wife, a crime he did not commit, Dr. Richard Kimble, played by David Janssen, escapes from the law when the train taking him to his execution wrecks. Tracked doggedly by police inspector Gerard, Kimble wanders across the country running from the law while trying to track down the one-armed man he saw leaving his house the night his wife was murdered. As he wanders the country, he helps many people with their problems, all the while trying to find the one armed man and trying to avoid Gerard.

This classic show had all the goods - great acting by Janssen, Morse, and the many guest stars, fantastic narration by William Conrad, clever, well-written scripts, and taut direction. This show had it all, and made Dr. Richard Kimble one of the most famous and sympathetic characters television history.

I hope CBS is not thinking of not releasing all the seasons due to the music whiners.  Perhaps if you watched the show you wouldn't be so obsessed with the music!,1243468800,3,319,4.266666666666667
3748207,1,B001PKHS86,"Dear Mr. Nemerovski;

I spoke to you by phone on May 13th, stating my displeasure with CBS' treatment of the Season 2 DVDs of The Fugitive series.  My issue concerns the music ""sweetening"" process your company enforces.

As well documented, the first volume of Season 2 from The Fugitive was overwrought with substitute music.  Much of the music was shrill and maladjusted to the scenes which it embodied.  Great writing and acting aside, the music changes made for an extremely unpleasant viewing experience.  In short, true Fugitive fans swiftly discerned where Pete Rugolo's legacy concluded and where entry level type musical inflections began.  Needless to say, the series did not FEEL like The Fugitive.

We fans complained in hopes that you would listen.  Many of us sent back proof of purchase labels for replacement discs.  The discs we received featured a few more Rugolo and Capitol cues, but obvious alterations to the musical score remained.  Among them, the song ""There's Just One Road I Travel"" from the Ballad For A Ghost episode was removed.  Why?  There couldn't have been a copyright issue for a song written by a regular contributor to the series.  I am speaking of writer George Eckstein.  He wrote the song specifically for that broadcast.  The episode had more than a minute of action excised.

In another episode, Escape Into Black, we were led to believe that perhaps all but 39 seconds of music was original.  However, a careful review of this episode with a VHS tape (which I have) compared to the DVD replacement disc, features some 25 music alterations.  Many of these are unnecessary in content.  Without canvassing every episode, ALL of which I have seen some 25-40 times, I'd say about 40 percent of Season 2, Volume 1 features replacement music.  Moreover, there are episodes with scenes in which some music is omitted outright.

I eagerly awaited the release of Season 2, Volume 2 of The Fugitive, convinced that CBS had put the ""sweetened"" music debacle behind them.
And lo and behold, I find out that Fun And Games And Party Favors, along with Brass Ring among others, suffer from the same musical malady.  Once again, I, along with other enlightened Fugitive fans were completely crestfallen and deflated.

How tough is it to secure rights to calliope music you used in the pilot episode of the series?  Background music in ""Party Favors"" was inconsiderably removed.  Other episodes with replacement music in the extremely tense moments of the program are The Survivors, Trial By Fire, & May God Have Mercy.  All told, Season 2, Volume 2 of The Fugitive contains about 50 percent of its original music.

When asked about the reason for the redesigned music, your company's reply is ""well, the ownership of Capitol is in question"", or ""we're trying to avoid a lawsuit"", or ""there are royalty issues which make this very difficult"".

My question is ""Why weren't these things considered and discussed among management and your lawyers before the release of The Fugitive?""  Companies of astute foresight, such as yourselves, usually take every conceivable legal precaution before distributing a product.  And at the very least, a company will set aside a certain amount for potential legal complications.  Apparently, this essential element of business practice eludes Season 2 DVD episodes of The Fugitive.

CBS owns The Fugitive & The Twilight Zone outright.  Many of The Jerry Goldsmith cues used in The Twilight Zone appeared throughout The Fugitive series.  Music stock libraries were interchangeable among shows in the 60's.  If there were no conflicts of interest in 1963, then it is very dubious that one of these recording entities or estates would retrosue 46 years later.  Not when CBS/Parmount is introducing The Fugitive and its musical corps to a new legion of fans.  There is more money for Paramount as well as the estates of those involved with The Fugitive.  Everyone wins.

IF CBS/Paramount was truly concerned about packaging The Fugitive at or near pristine condition, consultations with surviving musical contributors would've meliorated matters.  Peter Rugolo is alive.  He provided some 125 minutes of music for the show.  Was he contacted by your firm?  How about Ken Wilhoit and John Elizalde, the music supervisors of The Fugitive?  Joel Goldsmith, Jerry Goldsmith's son, is a composer.  There were many sources to contact to help detangle the music issue.

Taking the minimal approach to constructing Season 2 tells a customer that attention to detail is sacrificed in the name of mass production and a hurried profit.  Taking the maximum approach to constructing season 2 leads to greater sales, fewer complaints and returns, and satisfied patrons.  Not to mention a concerted effort by CBS to honor The Fugitive's musical and theatrical composition.

As I stated in our phone conversation, products are bought with a trust between a merchant and his customer.  The merchant advertises a product with known or assumed features and the customer purchases believing the product meets their needs or desires.  The merchant trusts that the customer will be happy.  When a customer finds that the product differs greatly from its public billing, understandably, the customer will feel angry, betrayed, pirated, and desirous of a replacement or a refund.

Such has been the case in the recent history of CBS/Paramount releases.  Wonderful TV classics bearing the CBS/Paramount trademark such as Gomer Pyle, Happy Days, Laverne & Shirley, The Odd Couple, and My Three Sons have been sold as merchandise resembling their nights of original broadcast.  Then a customer finds that the DVD they own features SYNDICATED episodes with songs, background music and scenes changed or completely deleted.  In some cases, scenes begin with the remnant of crowd laughter.

A continued indulgence in this glorified bait and switch method of operation will cost you longtime and potential buyers and big money.  The aforementioned shows are relics of a television heritage which will never be equalled or excelled.  That heritage could - and should - be furthered by CBS/Paramount.  PROPERLY.  TV ads (similar to the ones issued by Columbia House) would expose the DVDs likely to garner public demand.

In closing, I will say that we Fugitive fans are a sentimental, nostalgic lot who know that Pete Rugolo's music speaks in a way that Richard Kimble doesn't have to.  By removing the pristine musical properties of this viewing gem, the show lacks the intensity, the emotion, the sympathetic hues, and the sense of foreboding danger which makes it the greatest drama of all time.  The music is the backbone of The Fugitive.  THE MUSIC IS THE BACKBONE OF THE FUGITIVE.

My advice to CBS/Paramount is this:  Either re-release Season 2 Volumes 1 & 2 of The Fugitive with all or nearly all of its original music and cues, or offer your customers a complete refund.  No strings attached.  IF you must edit portions of musical cues, please provide the most minute, indiscernable adjustments as humanly possible.

If doing The Fugitive right is THAT big a problem, then outsource the show to entities such as Time/Life HBO, Image Entertainment, or Canada's Shout Factory.  Their customers are satisfied with their products.  The same can and should be said about your customers.

Thank you for your time.

3748211,1,B001PKHS86,"I wanted to wait a little while before I reviewed the latest release of The Fugitive Season Two volume Two due to I have very mixed emotions regarding the release of The Fugitive on DVD and Paramount/CBS treatment of this classic series.
The series itself, deserves nothing less than 5 stars! I was born in 1970 and never seen the show until A&E showed the series in the 1990's. From the first episode, I was hooked and The Fugitive became, and remains to this day, my favorite TV show.  I was thrilled the day CBS/Paramount announced the release of the show on DVD format! Back then, CBS/Paramount really did put classic TV on a pedestal. The first two releases of The Fugitive are outstanding! There are some minor music changes on the first two volumes, but they are barely noticeable.  The changes are in background incidental music such as juke box and radio music. While this still was unpleasant to me, it is still as I said, barely noticeable and very minute. But when CBS/Paramount released Season Two Volume One, they destroyed the whole feel to the show by doing something no other studio has ever done to a DVD release: They stripped the entire underscore and added new music. This was inexcusable and the fans outrage was tremendous. CBS/Paramount heard the fans and reissued the Season Two Volume One set with, in my opinion, 90-95% of the original score restored. Although I appreciate their effort, they still destroyed some of the episodes in the re-issue and many on this new volume two release.

Most of the scores they replaced on Season Two, Volumes One and Two, they own and there is no reason to remove them.  There are scores used on other CBS/Paramount shows such as the Twilight Zone, which the Fugitive borrowed from heavily, that CBS/Paramount still replaced.  There is no reason for this. And to add injury to insult,  In their statement issued with the exchange program, they promised that Season Two Volume Two would be close to the release of Season One volume one and two.  It is not. To be precise, Volume Two of Season Two shows more tampering with and replaced music than the episodes on the  replacement set of Volume One Season Two.
CBS/Paramount states that they put classic TV on a pedestal. They do but only for certain shows .  I believe that this is not a rights issue but a financial issue in that Paramount/CBS does not want to pay out royalties. To prove my fact, take a look at Star Trek and I love Lucy. Every bit of music on these shows remains intact and complete.  In the  latest (I refer to the non-Bluray issue) release of Star Trek, Paramount/CBS paid an orchestra to re-do the Star Trek score using original instrumental set up and original music cue sheets according to the extras found on the first season DVD set.  And as I mentioned before, I Love Lucy:  Every musical number performed by Desi Arnaz is intact and complete! Why can't The Fugitive fans get the same treatment? Instead we get replaced scores using synthesizers and in Volume One, the episode Ballad for a Ghost,  the song performed by Janice Page was totally removed and replaced by a new song and new singer! This is uncalled for because that song was written for that episode by the show's producer, and is in the script!

Another disappointment for this new release is some of the episodes have music added in places where there was no music initially.  In the episode ""Fun And Games And Party Favors"", there is music added in segments where there is no music originally. Now, not only is CBS/Paramount replacing music unnecessarily, they are adding music where music wasn't originally! And the episode ""Brass Ring"" unfortunately is pretty much totally ruined by the new music that plays in many different portions of it, especially during the chase scene in Act IV.  The climax of Act III also is destroyed by the heavy use of the composer's loud synthesized horns. Also note that all of the ""merry-go-round"" music from the original ""Brass Ring"" soundtrack has been replaced with new music as well which there is no reason for that replacement since that music seems to also appear in the premier episode, ""Fear in a Dessert Town"", and it remains untouched. The `merry-go-round"" music that is used is in public domain anyway and there was no reason to replace it. The episode ""The Survivors"" is also laced with heavy replacement music that ruins the feel of the show.
On the plus side, the picture quality of the episodes on the DVD's of The Fugitive are excellent. CBS/Paramount states the DVD's are being produced from the original negatives and from the look of these episodes, they are. The episodes are appear to be very clean and well preserved. The picture quality is very sharp!  The episode ""Corner of Hell"", like volume ones episode of ""Cry Uncle"" does show some damage to the negative but only in the preview of this episode.  No other damage seems present in the rest of the episode. It is too bad that CBS/Paramount didn't search for better prints. These two episodes were released by Nu Ventures video when they were releasing The Fugitive in the 90's and the episodes they used showed no damage.
The sound (the original, not the CBS/Paramount produced fake sound) is outstanding as well! The clarity for a show of this age is very clear and CBS/Paramount did an excellent job of cleaning up the audio. There are no hisses, drop outs, pops or cracks! Very excellent audio clarity!
I hope that CBS/Paramount listens to the fans of The Fugitive and realizes that there are as many Fugitive fans as there are Lucy and Trek fans and this time really go back and redo Season Two in its entirety with the original music score and performances added back into the episodes and rereleases them. Since they own the majority of the music, there is really no reason why the show cannot be released in its original broadcast form. I hope that Paramount/CBS clears any and all legal and royalties issues before releasing Season Three.  I am sending my Season Two Volume Two back like I did my Season Two Volume One. I believe that this is the only way that CBS/Paramount will hear our outrage and release The Fugitive correctly! Come on CBS/Paramount! Release The Fugitive in its original broadcast form and show us you really do care about your customers and really do put the classic TV show The Fugitive DVD on a pedestal!

If you really care about this classic show, I encourage you to contact the powers that be at paramount and ask that they release this classic intact as originally brodcasted. I will make it easy for you: Here is the address and phone number of the person to contact.

3748212,5,B001PKHS86,"The Fugitive is such a great show!  David Janssen was the perfect actor for the role; there is a ""wounded"" quality to him, combined with a morality and decency, that makes his performance very powerful.  I really wish there were extras in the DVD, but with Janssen being the only important recurring role, and with him dead, I guess it's sort of hard to do extras.  But can't they include SOMETHING on subsequent DVDs?  Even just trailers for the show or director's comments or info on all the many, interesting locations would be fun to see.  Especially the locations; how about a then and now on the many places they filmed?  After all, it was a totally on-location show, and I wish they would include more than just the shows.",1242000000,3,729,4.569230769230769
3748213,3,B001PKHS86,"Thankfully, for the most part, Rugolo's original score seems to be intact for most, if not all of the episodes in this set. Unfortunately though, this is the time in the series when the majority of the music was borrowed from other shows. This has led to a vast majority of the background music being replaced. Although some of the new music is actually pretty creative, and not all bad when considered by itself, the fact that it replaces classic cues fondly remembered by fans of this show is at the very least offensive. However, it does seem that they retained the music used from The Twilight Zone, and this makes sense, since CBS owns that show outright. As per my review title, this volume barely makes it above the original release of Season Two Volume 1, and surprisingly the replacement discs for that volume have more original music than this volume does. It is truly disappointing for fans of this show that CBS seems unwilling or unable to take the time necessary to sort out this debacle and release the show as it originally aired. The episodes in this set are watchable, but astute viewers will find themselves cringing every time the synthesizer becomes obvious. I think everyone can agree that music doesn't make a show, but the whole purpose of the release of nostalgia t.v. is to evoke nostalgia, and that includes every single piece of those shows. I dread the release of Season 4, when the show started using music from The Outer Limits. I can only hope they leave those cues intact. Fortunately they did for the pilot episode of The Invaders, so there might be hope yet. Please CBS, release The Fugitive as it originally aired.

Update 5/19/09: Have noticed while watching the episode ""May God Have Mercy"" that music during the scene when Kimble is transferred to x-ray has been replaced. This replacement was completely unnecessary and pointless. The original music used was kept intact in previous volumes in all instances, but now has been replaced for no logical reason. I'm really beginning to loathe CBS/Paramount and their haphazard way of doing things.",1241568000,7,2083,4.802228412256268

The only exception was the carousel music in ""Brass Ring."" I watched all 15 episodes. I recognized most of the music cues as part of the original. I am a nostalgia buff of Radio and TV, so when I heard music cues that were later used for ""The CBS Radio Mystery Theater"" in the 70's and early 80's, I was pleasantly surprised by it. It looks like to me that Paramount/CBS did listen to the public about Season 2 Volume,1, by offering replacements for it, and doing a good job on this new set. I hope they keep listening and bring out Season 3 volume 1 soon. I really heard the difference. Apparently a lot of people in these reviews disaggree.",1240185600,5,951,4.173913043478261

I bought this thinking that they corrected the music problem, but in the very first episode you can tell right away that it's not the original music. The first episode has many scenes with a carousel. Instead of a calliope sound, you hear and overbearing carnival song that sounds like it was made on a radio shack keyboard with electronic drums. It is mixed so loud that it is distracting.

The whole DVD release of The Fugitive is full of this awfulness. I honestly think the only original music is the Theme itself.

I give the DVD two stars only because it is one of the best TV shows ever made. What CBS did to the music ruined it. In some other shows it may not make a difference, but the music in the original Fugitive was very important to the show.

I guess they figured that no one would remember the music. It is a shame.",1239062400,11,1011,5.072289156626506

I know there are people who hadn't known the show until these discs who say ""what's the big deal about all this music stuff?"" but for those of us who know and love the show, this is a terrible thing. As I said, it changes the show completely. I would also think anyone with half an ear, even if they hadn't seen the show before, would be able to tell the change in mood and character when the replacement music starts to play.  Is this the only way these shows are going to be available? I do pray for the day that the original music will be restored in its entirety. I realize there are legal issues with the music, but can't they be addressed? For myself and many others who love this show, these shows have become almost unwatchable with the replacement music. Some episodes have more replacement music than others. On the first disc, the first episode (Brass Ring with Angie Dickinson) and the last (Fun and Games and Party Favors) had the most music gone. It is really bad. I say again, Don't you people realize how much it changes the show to replace the music? Won't the original versions ever be made available? Could you imagine replacing some of Bernard Herrmann's music in Psycho and trying to present it as the same thing as the original?

3748225,4,B001PKHS86,"With the March 31, 2009, DVD release of ""THE FUGITIVE: SEASON 2, VOLUME 2"", exactly one-half of the 120 episodes of ""The Fugitive"" have been made available on stunning-looking Digital Discs from CBS/Paramount.

Episode numbers 46 through 60 of this distinguished and, in my opinion, peerless 1960s dramatic television series show up in crisp, clear black-and-white on this 4-Disc DVD set.

As far as the music goes for this collection of episodes, it sounds to me as if there's a lot more of Mark Heyes' new music (i.e., the background music that sucks) in this S2V2 set than there is the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Season-2-Volume-1/dp/B0014FAIX4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Season 2, Volume 1</a>&nbsp;""fixed"" set, which was made available to customers by Paramount in February 2009 to replace the horrid original DVD release of S2V1, which had all of the original 1964 music ripped out of it.

Peter Rugolo's original ""Fugitive"" music is in place throughout each episode in this S2V2 set, but there are still many, many places in these episodes where the new replacement music pops up, which is always worse than the original Rugolo/CBS music. But, thankfully, the new stuff doesn't totally dominate each and every episode.

Still, it's a terrible shame, in my opinion, that this exceptional TV show known as ""The Fugitive"" (which I consider to be the best dramatic series ever to air on U.S. television) can't be released on DVD in its complete, unaltered, as-it-originally-aired form.

But I will say this as well -- A slightly-musically-altered ""Fugitive"" on DVD is still better than no ""Fugitive"" at all on DVD.

Perhaps we should try to get Police Lieutenant Philip Gerard to pass a law that requires all ""Fugitive"" episodes to always be released on Digital Versatile Disc in 100% unmutilated fashion....with the penalty for breaking this strict law being -- Having to listen to the totally-ruined soundtrack on Paramount's June 2008 initial DVD release of ""The Fugitive: Season 2, Volume 1"" (the unfixed ""All Heyes"" version).

With a law like that one on the books, there's no way that CBS/Paramount would ever tamper with this one-of-a-kind TV series ever again. :)

===================

SEASON TWO, VOLUME TWO:

Falsely accused and sentenced to death for a murder he didn't commit, Dr. Richard Kimble (David Janssen) is kept on his toes and, as always, on the run throughout these fifteen programs that close out a very successful sophomore year for ""The Fugitive"".

The popular series ended up as the #5 program on television for the 1964-1965 season, garnering an overall Nielsen rating for that season of 27.9, which meant that almost one out of every three homes that owned a TV that year watched the plight of Richard Kimble every Tuesday night on ABC.

""Corner Of Hell"" and ""Brass Ring"" are my two favorite episodes from the second half of Season #2. But several of the other episodes in this DVD set are programs that I don't recall having seen in the past at all. I must have missed taping some of these when the A&E cable network ran reruns of ""The Fugitive"" in 1995.

So this boxed set is providing this writer with some brand-new television programs to watch. And that's kind of a nice experience too, being able to see some of these episodes for the first time, in uncut form (albeit with a few musical alterations), on these pristine-looking DVDs from CBS/Paramount.

Some of the guest stars that pop up during the last half of Season 2 include the following names (many of them making return ""Fugitive"" appearances):

Celeste Holm, Angie Dickinson, Jack Klugman, Murray Hamilton, Telly Savalas, Robert Duvall, Ed Begley, Andrew Duggan, Steve Forrest, Ed Asner, Bruce Dern, Shirley Knight, Pat Hingle, and James Doohan.

Each of the shows in this DVD collection appears to be full-length and uncut, just as they originally aired in early 1965 on the ABC Television Network. The average length is approximately 51.5 minutes per show.

The four episodes on Disc 1 have the following precise running times:

""Brass Ring"" -- 51:37
""The End Is But The Beginning"" -- 51:39
""Nicest Fella You'd Ever Want To Meet"" -- 51:28
""Fun And Games And Party Favors"" -- 51:38

===================

MORE DVD INFO:

4-Disc Set.

Single-sided, Dual-layered discs.

No subtitles.

Closed-Captioning is included.

No bonus material.

7 chapter breaks per episode.

Silent/Static menus.

A ""Play All"" option is available.

Episode information is printed on the inside panels of the clear, see-through DVD case. Two hinged ""pages"" hold all four of the discs inside the standard-size case. The discs do not overlap each other. It's a nice, space-saving case design.

Packaging (Photo) Note -- The picture of David Janssen on the front of the DVD case is a silly one, IMO. An alternate ""wanted"" poster of Richard Kimble has been created for the DVD cover, which isn't a realistic ""wanted"" poster at all.

Why CBS/Paramount didn't simply use a picture of the famous ""wanted"" poster of Kimble that is seen in many episodes throughout the series is a mystery to me. The ""real"" poster would have been a much better choice for the DVD cover art, instead of a newly-created fake one.

===================

THE EPISODES:

This second volume of Season 2 contains the following episodes (I've thrown in a few comments along the way for some of the shows, plus a look at each of Dr. Kimble's fake names that he used during these fifteen on-the-run adventures, and the dates when the episodes were first shown on ABC-TV):

46. ""Brass Ring"" (First Aired: January 5, 1965) .... Alias: ""Ben Horton"". .... Angie Dickinson and Robert Duvall start off the second half of this season with great style, as each puts in a solid acting performance in ""Brass Ring"". Kimble, as Ben Horton, acquires a job to care for the wheelchair-bound Duvall.

The 33-year-old Dickinson (who is supposed to be 26 years old [almost 27] for the purposes of this ""Fugitive"" script) portrays ""Norma Sessions"", a woman who certainly isn't all that she seems to be on the surface.

""Brass Ring"" contains an interesting combination of sad, happy, bittersweet, and poignant moments, and Act IV provides ample twists and turns to keep you guessing (along with a final scene with Duvall that is really quite chilling....and disturbing, IMO).

Unfortunately, however, this episode is pretty much totally ruined (IMO) by the ""new"" substitute music that permeates many different portions of it, particularly during the crucial scene in Act III which has Duvall suddenly sitting up in bed on his own. The replacement music in that important scene just cannot compare to the original 1965 underscore. And the climax of Act III is destroyed by the heavy use of ""new"" composer Mark Heyes' loud horns.

Plus, all of the ""merry-go-round"" music from the original ""Brass Ring"" soundtrack has been replaced with new music too, which is also inferior when compared to the original '65 score. What a shame.

But at least the picture quality shines anyway. All of these shows, in fact, look great on these DVDs. It's just too bad that in several places throughout the episodes the music had to be changed.

I think ""Brass Ring"" bothered me the most when it comes to these occasional music alterations. The slight background musical changes in the other episodes within this 4-Disc set don't seem to annoy me nearly as much as ""Brass Ring"" did/does.

51. ""Corner Of Hell"" (February 9, 1965) .... Alias: ""Paul Hunter"". .... This outstanding episode, originally entitled ""This Place Belongs To Another People"", prominently features Barry Morse as Lt. Philip Gerard. And it's another great performance turned in by Morse here.

In an ironic twist, it is Gerard, while searching for Dr. Kimble, who finds himself ""on trial"" in the backwoods of Louisiana.

Here's some interesting ""Corner Of Hell"" trivia, which comes from Ed Robertson's 1993 book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Fugitive-Recaptured/dp/0938817345/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""The Fugitive Recaptured""</a>:

""[The episode ""Corner Of Hell""] initially focused on the sadistic nature of Tully's police-hating community. In the first draft of the script, for example, Gerard is completely humiliated: not only do Tully's people relieve the lieutenant of his gun, they strip him of his shoes and socks, so that when he is returned from the woods after his escape attempt, his feet are badly cut and bruised.

""The story originally took place at night, which made Gerard's ordeal more harrowing--in the darkness, he is attacked by thousands of cargo spiders, and later runs into a swarm of bees. And before Gerard is ""sentenced,"" he endures a shower of beer, cigar burns on his leg, and numerous kickings and beatings.

""Apparently, the authors realized that the torment was excessive, because [co-writer of the teleplay Francis Irby] Gwaltney made a handwritten note at the end of the first draft to ""emphasize the trial more,"" particularly in the fourth act."" -- Page 98 of ""THE FUGITIVE RECAPTURED: THE 30TH ANNIVERSARY COMPANION TO A TELEVISION CLASSIC"" (c. 1993)

52. ""Moon Child"" (February 16, 1965) .... Alias: ""Bill Martin"".

53. ""The Survivors"" (March 2, 1965) .... No alias used. .... In this unique episode, Dr. Kimble returns to the Indiana town of Fairgreen, where he first met his wife-to-be, Helen Waverley, ten years earlier. He re-enters the lives of the Waverley family, and as a result re-opens the still-fresh wounds left behind by Helen's tragic murder. An excellent episode.

57. ""Runner In The Dark"" (March 30, 1965) .... Aliases: ""Tom Burns"" and ""Phil Mead"". .... For the second time in Season 2, Ed Begley Sr. makes an impressive guest-starring ""Fugitive"" appearance.

58. ""A.P.B."" (April 6, 1965) .... Alias: ""Ed Morris"".

59. ""The Old Man Picked A Lemon"" (April 13, 1965) .... Alias: ""Jim Wallace"". .... Celeste Holm heads the list of guest stars for this ""Fugitive"" entry. Celeste would later also co-star in a Season-Four episode as well.

===================

FINAL THOUGHTS:

Sixty episodes of ""The Fugitive"" on DVD, with sixty to go.

It's nice to at least now be at the halfway point toward the completion of this stellar TV series being released in its hoped-for very deserved entirety on DVD.

And Paramount's relatively quick and timely release schedule for these half-season sets hasn't been very agonizing at all for fans of this impeccable series who, like myself, no doubt have a desire to collect all 120 episodes on DVD as quickly as they can.

So my advice is this (despite a few complaints about the replacement music) -- Race with Dr. Richard Kimble to the 50-yard line of ""The Fugitive"" on DVD by grabbing a copy of ""Season Two, Volume Two"" right now.

NOW, why in the universe CBS-Paramount ever dreamed it was a good idea to cut the key music that identifies ""The Fugitive"" and reminds you every time after just four notes how tear-jerking sad it was to watch ""an innocent victim of blind justice, falsely convicted for the murder of his wife"" - and a doctor for kids no less - being forced to hide his handsome mug from the cops everywhere he went and ""toil at many jobs,"" like washing dishes and doing even worse stuff than that, I just really cannot comprehend.  And then after the music fiasco last year, and the outcry, I'd pretty much figured we'd seen the end of The Fugitive releases during my lifetime, so I started transferring my VHS tapes of the entire series to DVDs.

BUT, CBS-Paramount actually responded and restored most of the music.  I must compliment them for doing this at, I'm sure, significant expense, and I strongly recommend that all lovers of this fabulous TV drama, starring the outstanding David Janssen, along w/some really great guest stars in nearly every episode - like Suzanne Pleshette, Leslie Nielsen, Richard Anderson, Telly Savalas, Beau Bridges, Pipa Scott, Robert Webber, etc., etc., and etc. - to buy S2,V2 so that S3 and S4 will be released in the near future.  (The remastering of S4 - ""The Fugitive - In Color"" - will definitely be a welcome relief for the eyeballs, since the color on those old prints is pretty bad!)

April 3, 2009 update:

I must digress a bit to comment on this release.  After all the hoopla about the ""wonderful"" replacement discs for S.2. V.1, we have been hoodwinked and bamboozled by CBS/Paramount!

All the music I've heard has been ""real"" strings and have had the Fugitive ""cues"" that were missing from the previous volume. The video and audio is crystal clear as with all the Fugitive releases. I just put on one of my store bought Fugitive VCR tapes to check for musical replacement and was appalled at how poor the quality was - The video was so washed out and the audio was unclear and somewhat garbled. The DVD is so Superior! It makes me want to get Season 3 (as one complete set please) even more!

Dear CBS,

I'm very disappointed with your release of Season 2 of THE FUGITIVE, and I'd like to tell you why.

The issue is the music.  Yes, I know that you've heard this before, and you might believe that you've already addressed this issue and put it behind you.

But you'd be wrong.  The music is still being screwed up.

I happen to think that THE FUGITIVE is one of the finest dramatic series ever produced for American television.  Perhaps THE finest.  So I was overjoyed when I first heard that CBS was going to release this series on DVD.

And Season One was great.  Well, almost great.  It would have been perfect if a few instances of background music on radios and jukeboxes hadn't been needlessly replaced in the episodes GARDEN HOUSE and WHERE THE ACTION IS.

But beginning with your release of Season 2 Volume 1, all of that changed.  The music was horrible.  Absolutely horrible.

CBS finally admitted that they had thrown out the entire musical score and commissioned a brand-new score composed of Crap Synthesizer Music.  And all because of a handful of musical cues that had been originally licensed from the Capitol music library, the ownership of which was now in legal limbo.

This was a first-class example of 'throwing the baby out with the bath water'.  --  ""A few musical cues have got to go, so let's just throw out the entire musical score.""  This ranks as perhaps the most colossal blunder in the history of television.

Tens of thousands of Fugitive fans wrote letters, wrote emails, boycotted CBS products, and returned their DVDs for refunds.  The outpouring of fan rage was unprecedented.

CBS recoiled in shock.  Why were the fans so concerned about the music, when CBS had long ago concluded that ""The Music Doesn't Matter""?

Fans were livid because The Music DOES Matter.

Let me say that again, CBS.

THE MUSIC *DOES* MATTER.  Especially to a show like THE FUGITIVE.

Now, I can think of a great many series whose music is unmemorable.  But THE FUGITIVE is different.  It's a film-noir series. The protagonist is a tired, lonely, beaten-down guy who is being chased by the police for a crime he didn't commit.

The music underscores his lonely plight.  It sets the mood, underscores his loneliness, gets the audience emotionally involved.  The music is of primary importance to this series.  Which is why any alteration to the music is jarring, changes the mood, changes the impact of the scene, and totally ruins the experience.  THAT'S why the fans were outraged.

Thousands of fans returned their S2V1 DVD sets for a refund.  This hit CBS where it mattered most, in the pocketbook.  And CBS eventually responded by issuing Replacement Discs for S2V1, with the original music restored, and with only those few Capitol cues replaced.

(Personally, I believe that CBS' decision to issue Replacement Discs for S2V1 was primarily due to the embarrassment that CBS suffered when this issue was made public in an article entitled ""CBS/Par Can't Escape Fugitive Burn"" in the daily film-industry newspaper, VARIETY.)

(CBS has long turned a deaf ear to complaints from fans of other Classic TV shows that CBS has butchered.  CBS probably would have ignored FUGITIVE fans too, if not for Jon Burlingame's VARIETY article.  Thanks, Jon!)

Having issued the S2V1 Replacement Discs, you probably thought that you had resolved this music-replacement issue and put it behind you, didn't you, CBS?

But the S2V1 Replacement Discs didn't REALLY restore all of the original music (save for those few Capitol cues).  A great many of the original cues were STILL needlessly replaced!

As an example, let's take a look at the Season 2 episode ESCAPE INTO BLACK.  CBS has publicly stated that, in this episode, there is only one cue in question, a 39-second Capitol cue composed by Nick Carras.

(For proof, Google ""The Fugitive Music Debacle: Why It Happened"")

So, there is only one cue that had to be replaced in ESCAPE INTO BLACK.  And if you pull out your old VHS copy and compare it to the S2V1 Replacement version, you'll find that the original score is intact, save for that one replaced cue, right?

Wrong.  I made the comparison, and I found 25 instances where original cues have been needlessly replaced by Crap Synthesizer Cues.  Here they are, listed by time index.

02:32 - flashback: Kimble sees one-armed man
02:41 - flashback: one-armed man in headlights

14:01 - Kimble being fingerprinted

47:14 - Gerard recognizes Kimble
47:20 - Gerard chases Kimble
47:45 - Kimble watches train recede
47:50 - (cue inserted where none existed)

The explanation is obvious.  CBS did NOT start with the original score, and then replace that single Capitol cue.  Instead, CBS started with the Crap Synthesizer Version from their first S2V1 release, and then sprinkled a few original cues back in, leaving a great many Crap Synthesizer Cues remaining.

CBS *could* have restored ALL of the original music, save for that single Capitol cue, but CBS chose to cut corners to save a buck, sacrificing quality in favor of cost-cutting expediency.

CBS probably thought that the fans wouldn't notice.  But CBS has continually underestimated the intelligence of the fan base.  First of all, the fans know every note of music, and will notice even the slightest change.  Second, fans are able to communicate this information to each other by means of the Internet.

I have watched every episode of Season 2, and ESCAPE INTO BLACK is a pretty typical episode in terms of replaced music.  I'd estimate that the S2V1 Replacement-Version episodes have an average of 60% original cues and 40% Crap Synthesizer Cues (in terms of number of cues, not necessarily running time).

It's worse for S2V2.  I would estimate that the average S2V2 episode has 50% original cues and 50% Crap Synthesizer Cues.

This isn't remotely fair, CBS.  We're already paying you double for these dvds, because you've split the season into two half-season sets.  And what do we get for our double payment?  We only get about half of the original musical cues!  We're getting ripped off TWICE.

C'mon, CBS, charging us double for only half of the music is low-down and dirty.  You really need to fix this.

Those CBS executives who thought that this music-replacement issue had already been resolved are sadly mistaken.  This is still a huge issue to a huge number of FUGITIVE fans, and CBS is going to continue to lose sales until this issue is properly addressed.

This touches on the broader issue of Needless Music Replacement.  CBS is guilty of editing and replacing the music of several tv series, among them GOMER PYLE, THE ODD COUPLE, and MY THREE SONS.

Why is CBS the only major dvd company that routinely replaces music?  The answer seems to be that CBS is waging its own war against the Music Industry.  Ken Ross, CBS' VP and General Manager, actually BOASTS about saving money by replacing music rather than paying music licensing fees.

With all due respect to Mr. Ross, I'd like to ask him to PLEASE STOP waging this war against what he perceives to be excessive music licensing fees.  Fans of Classic TV would rather have the original music, even if it means that the dvds cost a little bit more.

Listen carefully, CBS.  Waging war against the Music Industry by replacing music only serves to alienate your core dvd customers.  IT'S NOT WORTH IT.

Put your customers first, Mr. Ross.  Just PAY THE LICENSING FEES and give your customers the Classic TV that they're asking for.  PUT YOUR CUSTOMERS FIRST, not your pocketbook or your ego.

If you're still not convinced that replacing music is a bad idea, CBS, let me illustrate with an example.

For my example, let's look into the bowels of CBS/Paramount, where an audio-video engineer is preparing an episode of GOMER PYLE for DVD release.  Our engineer, Skippy, has just deleted a one-minute segment in which Gomer sings a song.

Skippy is proud of himself.  ""If I had kept Gomer's song intact, CBS would have had to pay $2000 to license that music.  That would have driven up the unit price by 5 cents, and we would have overshot our Price Point.  Besides, those stupid consumers will never know that I deleted Gomer's song.""

Wrong, Skippy.  It turns out that the Cost Model used by CBS fails to take two factors into account.  First, consumers are not the stupid morons that CBS believes them to be.  Second, in this age of global Internet communications, consumers can instantly communicate with each other.

So here is what actually happens.  As soon as the DVDs are released, a sharp-eyed consumer realizes that Gomer's song has been deleted.  That person communicates this information to other fans by means of an Amazon review and by postings to various websites.

Many consumers who were planning to buy the DVDs then cancel their purchases, based on these reviews.  CBS loses the sale of perhaps 30,000 units.

Great job there, Skippy.  Nice going.  Give yourself a pat on the back.  By deleting Gomer's song, CBS saved a penny but lost a fortune.

This is the critical flaw in CBS' thinking.  Whenever CBS replaces music, they end up losing more in sales than they save in licensing fees.

It makes no economic sense to replace music.  Anytime that you mutilate the music, consumers will find out and will cancel their purchase of your product.  You're going to lose even more money than if you had just left the music alone.

And consumers would be happy to pay a slightly higher price if it meant that the episodes would be uncut and unedited -- in ""Night of Original Broadcast"" quality.

If CBS continues to replace music, here is what I think is going to happen to THE FUGITIVE.  --  CBS will release Seasons 3 and 4, which will sell in modest numbers.  Overall, the entire series will be a break-even product for CBS, or even a modest financial success.

Then, a few years later, a different DVD company will go back and release the series again, this time paying more attention to restoring the original music.  And they will end up selling TEN TIMES as many units as CBS did.

And the executives at CBS will scratch their heads and say, ""Gee, we only sold one-tenth as many units.  Where did all of that demand come from?  Where were all of those customers when WE released our DVDs?""

I'll tell you, CBS.  Those customers are right here, right now.  Waiting for you to release their favorite show in pristine, un-edited, un-mutilated, night-of-original-broadcast form.  And if you give it to them, they'll buy every last DVD set that you can produce.  But if you tamper with the music, they'll stay away in droves.

The ball is in your court, CBS.  You have an opportunity here to change your attitude and rectify your mistakes.  You can make a ton of money by giving the fans their show in pristine condition, or you can lose it all by continuing your self-destructive practice of replacing music.  The decision is yours.

In the eventuality that you make the intelligent choice, please permit me to give you my Wish List, in order of priority:

(1) Please re-release Season 2 in its entirety, this time starting with the original score, and replacing ONLY those cues as absolutely necessary.  And restore the Janis Paige scene in BALLAD FOR A GHOST.

(And remove that insulting end-credit screen that gives musical credit to the composers of the Crap Synthesizer Music!)

If you're unsure about the legal ownership of some of the cues, go hire Ken Wilhoit as a temporary employee.  Ken was the original Music Supervisor during the series' original four-year run, and can identify the heritage of every single cue.  He's retired now.  If you can't get Ken, there are many other music experts in the Los Angeles area who could do the same job.

(2) Please restore the background music that was needlessly replaced in the Season One episodes GARDEN HOUSE and WHERE THE ACTION IS, and issue replacement discs.

(3) Please release Seasons 3 and 4 with all original music intact.  If you come across any musical cues of uncertain legal ownership, make sure that you exhaust all other options before you take the drastic action of replacing them.

And don't play games with the music of seasons 3 and 4!  It would be very easy for CBS to decide to INTENTIONALLY replace some of the musical cues in S3 and S4 with Crap Synthesizer Cues, for the following reason:

""If we release seasons 3 and 4 with all of the original music intact, then the fans will DEMAND that we go back and get rid of the Crap Synthesizer Music that we allowed to remain in Season Two.  This would bring Season Two's music up to par with Seasons 1, 3 and 4.""

""But we'd have to go back and restore all of the original music to Season Two, and we'd rather not spend the money to do that.  So let's intentionally replace about half of the musical cues in S3 and S4 with Crap Synthesizer Cues.  By watering down the music in S3 and S4, those seasons will be on par with Season 2.""

(4) If any of your executives still have the attitude that ""The Music Doesn't Matter"", fire them or ask them to take early retirement.  This attitude has been the root cause of CBS' problems.

(5) How about including episode introductions by Barry Morse, who played Lieutenant Gerard?  Though he passed away in 2008, Barry recorded episode introductions averaging 3 or 4 minutes in length for the VHS release of Fugitive episodes by Nu Ventures in the early 1990s.  Nu Ventures released 40 episodes on 20 VHS tapes, and though I'm uncertain if Barry recorded introductions for all 40 episodes, I know that he recorded at least 37 of them, because I've got them.

(6) How about some extras?  I'm sure there must be interviews and documentaries out there.  It would be great if some of them were included on these discs.

(7) CBS, maybe it's time that you threw in the towel on THE FUGITIVE, given the fact that you've continually screwed up the music.

How about turning this project over to a more competent DVD company?  Consider Shout Factory and Image Entertainment, for example.  They do great work, and they treat the music with the respect that it deserves.

Look at the excellent job that Image Entertainment did with their DEFINITIVE TWILIGHT ZONE release.  That is how you should be treating THE FUGITIVE -- with restored video, original music, and lots of extras.

THE FUGITIVE has been called ""The Greatest Dramatic Series of the 1960s"".  This should be a Showcase Product for you, CBS.  You should give it the kind of gold-plated treatment that Image Entertainment gave to its DEFINITIVE TWILIGHT ZONE release.

Don't be in such a hurry to ""Get these DVDs out the door, music be damned.""  Take your time and do a proper job.  Give us THE FUGITIVE with restored video, original music, and lots of extras.

If that is too difficult for you, CBS, then maybe you should outsource this project to Image Entertainment.",1233792000,137,15515,4.757223264540338

3748245,5,B001PKHS86,"So this is what is has come to. After many many years of waiting for this timeless series to finally come out (IN IT'S ENTIRE 120 EPISODE SERIES HOPEFULLY) on any kinda media (SINCE THE ANTHOLOGY AND THE FINAL TWO EPISODES AND A FEW MORE SCATTERED EPISODES HERE AND THERE WERE THE ONLY THING PUT OUT PROFESSIONAL) people are rating it before we even know! First of all by giving low stars only hurts the show. So when the younger generation comes here and sees low stars but doesn't read why your giving low stars they think the SHOW stunk! Write letters to Paramount people! I totally understand how important the music score is but these are way better than any bootleg that all the crooks making money on out there are selling where the sound being different? How about that it's not there or if it is it's horrible! The video, menu's, come on people. Now that you have ranked it low and if it comes out and if it's perfect what are you gonna do? I'am a person who always believes in second chances for the most part so the only reason I'm rating it ahead is to try and balance the score until we find out!

Unaware of the music alteration, I DID buy S.2-V.1 but how can CBS/Paramount possibly think anyone would trust them to fix the music bastardization of S.2-V.1?  With all the public criticism, are the CBS suits so demented to actually distribute another debacle like Vol. 1?  I guess the asnswer is YES!

3748247,1,B001PKHS86,"As a fan of this wonderful TV show, one very important and major component of the series was the outstanding music specifically written and masterly matched with each scene.  For Paramount to take such short-cuts to ""save money"" and take out the original music is in my eyes, totally unforgivable.  Under NO circumstance, will I buy a single DVD of THE FUGITIVE with altered music.  The music is equally instrumental in making the series a classic as the writing, directing and photography.  The fans got the shaft, we should return the favor and give it right back to Paramount by refusing to buy their product and hit them where it counts, in the pocket book.",1233705600,19,661,4.721739130434782

Read my comments regarding this Series and then go on You Tube Videos and type:
The Fugitive 1963. The REAL Pilot Episode. A condensed version.  Plus Stills.
Watch this movie on TV via HDMI on your laptop.  it's brilliant.
Apologies for poor quality.
Here we go!
I watched the REAL Pilot Episode the week before  Fear In A Desert City was first aired in 1963!  (I was 22 years old at the time).
I swear to God this is true. I am not lying. Why would I? What would be the point in doing so?
I have joined and edited segments together(14 minutes in total) in their correct order to make a proper movie showing the truth regarding this matter.
(Who's a clever boy, then?).
These segments were taken from The Girl From Little Egypt. Season 1. Episode 14.
These segments themselves were taken from The REAL Pilot Episode and should very much suggest to you that there was, indeed, an earlier story in existence.
Assume, as everybody does, this REAL Pilot Episode doesn't exist.
RIGHT!
So.
It's taken until Episode 14 to find out ANYTHING about Kimble's life before his wife was murdered!
Hey!  Thanks a lot, QM Productions!
We find out NOW that his wife's name was Helen!
We find out NOW that his son was stillborn!
We find out NOW that his wife had started drinking!
We find out NOW that they had started having arguments about adoption!
All this has taken 14 Episodes before we find this out!
This Episode or a similar storyline would have been much better to have started the Series with, wouldn't it?
What on earth was the matter with you lot at Q M Productions?
Well, nothing. Nothing at all!
They did a great job with this! The true fact being that this Pilot Episode went missing!
There are two crucial points here.
a)  Q M Productions were not aware that this Episode was never included in the Series after they sold it.
b)  CBS Paramount  were never aware that it ever existed in the first place.
Both companies.
NOT GUILTY.
This old tape is still languishing in an old film can in the Archives /Basement of a TV Network Station or a collectors shed/outhouse or attic somewhere.
CBS Paramount you are sitting on a goldmine here.
Find this Episode and re-issue Season 1 volume 1 as a Special Edition with the Wanted Poster as the artwork. (Tug of War. Season 2. Vol 1. Episode 7).
Please Do NOT print anything fancy about finding this Episode on the front  cover artwork!
Either print it on the back or just put it on your Product information regarding 'Special Edition'.
Think of what the customer would like to look at on the cover and NOT just yourselves trying to drum up sales!
That won't be needed, I assure you.
Also please don't do this Manufactured DVD-R  on demand cheap rubbish. Quality DVD please.
Be proud of yourselves.
Please re-issue the whole Series as Region Free for those living in the United Kingdom and elsewhere. You are absolutely no help at all with this at the present time, are you?
Now THAT would drum up your sales!
So come on and hunt him down.
He is a fugitive, after all !
