6014168,4,B00FM4S8H6,"Although I  NYPD Blue, which ran on the ABC network for 12 years, in my honest opinion, Season 5 is the LAST GOOD season of this show -- and after this season, the show started going steadily (but at a rapid pace) downhill until it was finally cancelled in 2005.  In my honest opinion, the show ""jumped the shark"" after Jimmy Smits (one of my favorite actors) left and was replaced by 80s child actor &&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Silver-Spoons/dp/B000OVLBH6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Silver Spoons</a>&nbsp;star, Rick Schroder, who was replaced AGAIN, a couple/few years later, by ANOTHER 80s/90s child actor &&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saved-by-the-Bell/dp/B00ELKDDWM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saved by the Bell</a>&nbsp;star, Mark-Paul Gosselaar --and then got progressively worse as most of the original or early seasons cast (like Sharon Lawrence, Nicholas Turturro, James McDaniel, Andrea Thompson, and Kim Delaney) left the show and more & more new people were brought on to replace them.

Personally, I only really like the seasons with Jimmy Smits (meaning most of Season 2, all of Season 3, 4 & 5 and a few episodes in Season 6 -- which honestly, I hated, as it was mainly just the storyline arc for his exit). I HATED the show with David Caruso (meaning Season 1 and the first few episodes of Season 2) who seemed to be very arrogant, obnoxious & insufferable -- and though I did NOT loathe the show with Rick Schroder or Mark-Paul Gosselaar (who appeared most of Season 6, through the series finale at the end of Season 12) as much as I did with David Caruso, I did NOT like it with them either. Because, I grew up seeing Rick Schroder and Mark-Paul Gosselaar in the child & teen actor roles they played. Schroder in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Silver-Spoons/dp/B000OVLBH6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Silver Spoons</a>&nbsp;and Gosselaar in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Punky-Brewster/dp/B001DDCVC8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Punky Brewster</a>, ""Good Morning, Miss Bliss"" &&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saved-by-the-Bell/dp/B00ELKDDWM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saved by the Bell</a>&nbsp;-- and both Schroder & Gosselaar in various made-for-TV movies. So, whether its fair or not (and I know its NOT fair!), they were ""typecast"", at least in my mind & opinion, for kiddie/teen roles -- and I didn't like seeing them suddenly thrust into the role of a homicide detective, especially on an established series like NYPD Blue, without, as far as I know, any transitional adult roles beforehand. Even just playing a uniform officer on NYPD Blue (or another show or movie) or a med student, or lawyer or whatever other adult role in even one TV show or movie, would have been SOMETHING at least!

However, since Jimmy Smits left a few episodes into Season 6, this season is not only the last one in which he appears the entire duration, but it is also the LAST season of NYPD Blue that I've seen in its entirety. For the most part, I did not watch NYPD Blue very often after Jimmy Smits left -- and with the exception of an episode here & there, after Sharon Lawrence and Rick Schroder left, I pretty much stopped watching the show completely. It was just too depressing. Although NYPD Blue is a police drama, and so, I know that, naturally, its not going to be all sunny days, and rainbows and cute puppy dogs & kittens -- I can't stand how the show's writers deliberately destroy even the few GOOD/HAPPY storylines (like the romance between Jimmy Smits & Kim Delaney's characters or the marriage & family of Dennis Franz's character). Which is why I think that Season 5 is the LAST GOOD season, and I stopped watching regularly a few episodes into Season 6, and then stopped watching it completely (other than an occasional episode once in a blue moon) a couple/few seasons later because of the horrible way that Jimmy Smits, Sharon Lawrence, and Rick Schroder's characters were written out/exit the series.

Although&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/NYPD-Blue-Season-5/dp/B00FM4S8H6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">NYPD Blue: Season 5</a>&nbsp;one of my FAVORITE seasons (and the LAST GOOD season) of this show, unfortunately, this DVD set itself leaves a lot to be desired -- which is why I gave this item 4 stars instead of 5. As many other reviewers commented, this set lacks any closed-captioning feature, as far as I can tell. I say ""as far as I can tell"" because, some DVD sets have it so that if the TV or DVD player, has closed captioning feature, then even if closed-captions are not included on a DVD set, nevertheless, the captions may still show up anyway. But from what I can tell, on this DVD set they do NOT -- and worse, the recorded volume, seems to be very low. So, even though I don't have a hearing problem (that I know of, at least!) even when I have the TV & sound system up at a high volume level, its still very hard to decipher what the characters are saying, especially when they're talking softly or mumbling. I can only imagine how much worse it'd be for fans of NYPD Blue, who DO have actual  hearing problems, and are not just using captions as a supplement. Also, there don't seem to be ANY ""special features"" on this DVD set. No commentaries, no deleted scenes, no bloopers, nothing -- and while bonuses are not really a necessity, by the same token, when people are paying  $15, $20 or $30 or more for a season set, the LEAST that the studios can do is give buyers ""something"" more than if they'd get if they just taped it off of TV (because NYPD Blue airs all the time on the H & I [Heroes & Icons] network as well as the Audience network) onto VHS tapes or DVD. That is some of the reasons why I gave this set 4 stars:

 5 STARS for the season of this show, and  3 STARS for the DVD release =  4 STARS!!

From the blurb on the back of the box:

New York's Finest Are Back!
The groundbreaking and award-winning cop series returns with more riveting drama and gritty New York City action at the 15th precinct.
Season five finds Sipowicz (Dennis Franz) and Simone (Jimmy Smits) dealing with the aftermath of the Joey Salvo homicide, setting up a rape sting, following the trail of a stripper killer and investigating a murderous home invasion. Meanwhile, Medavoy (Gordon Clapp), Martinez (Nicholas Turturro) and Russell (Kim Delaney) uncover a body-snatching ring, investigate the murder of a rock-and-roll manager and look for a man suspected of robbing taxis.
Created by Emmy award winners Steven Bochco (L.A. Law, Hill Street Blues) and David Milch (Deadwood), NYPD Blue tackles cases ripped from the headlines, capturing the tumultuous and unpredictable nature of New York City crime.

Anyway, as I said, I really only love/like this show with Jimmy Smits, and this is one of my favorite seasons of NYPD Blue in part because the romance/relationship between Detective Bobby Simone (Jimmy Smits) and Detective Diane Russell (Kim Delaney) evolves & becomes more serious over the course of Season 5. In fact, one of my FAVORITE episodes of this season (if not the entire series!) is the Season 5 finale episode, ""Honeymoon at Viagra Falls"". In this episode........
 SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!!! 
Detective Russell & Detective Jill Kirkendall (Andrea Thompson) investigate the kidnapping of a 9 year old girl from the park and try to get a recalcitrant pedophile/child molester to confess, and reveal the girl's location (I  the interrogation scene with Detective Russell & Kirkendall and eventually Lieutenant Arthur Fancy [James McDaniel] their boss/commanding officer) as Detective Sipowicz & Simone investigate the murder of a witness and her young child, and and Detective Martinez & Medavoy look into a sports memorabilia scam. Meanwhile, Detective Russell and Detective Simone try to manage/complete work-related commitments in order to make it to the courthouse in time to get married by the Justice of the Peace, before they close for the day.

I absolutely LOVED the episode ""Honeymoon at Viagra Falls"". Not only was it the last episode of Season 5, but as far as I'm concerned, since it was also the LAST good episode of this series, before going progressively downhill starting with the Season 6 premiere THIS episode should have been the series finale. But unfortunately, it wasn't, so instead NYPD Blue continued  for 7 more seasons, dragging/limping along until the bitter end, having to bring on more & more new people to replace all the original cast & long-time cast members that left (Sharon Lawrence, Gail O'Grady, Jimmy Smits, Nicholas Turturro, James McDaniel, Kim Delaney, Andrea Thompson, etc.) until the plug was finally pulled at the end of Season 12. The show should have ended with the Season 5 finale, ""Honeymoon at Viagra Falls"" and Sipowicz happy with his wife and new baby, and Simone & Russell married and happy. It would have been a great end to a mostly great (excluding the David Caruso episodes!) series.

All in all though, this is a pretty good DVD set, and a GREAT season of NYPD Blue!!

6014282,5,B00FM4S8H6,"I was so pleased that this was FINALLY released! This was clearly the best television program that was unavailable to watch through any source, whether on DVD, via broadcast repeats, or through streaming media.

Indeed, in my opinion, it is the best police drama, and perhaps the best hour-long show, ever produced for commercial television.  No television show ever developed its characters so richly, so deeply, and so realistically.  It provides occasionally horrific plots but intersperses them with a tasty salting of comic relief.  It has a way of painting even the most heroic figures, and even the most disgustingly heinous criminals, as human beings, highlighting everyone's strengths, weaknesses, and faults alike.  Every episode is exciting, touching, interesting, thrilling, funny, and edifying.  And the character of Andy Sipowicz may be the most sympathetic in television history.

Note that my five-star rating is based on the the dramatic and production qualities of the program itself.  The quality of the transfer to DVD is somewhat less stellar.  Some episodes are well-done, but others are quite poor, with notable blurring and ghosting that detracts from the viewing experience and reduces the quality down to what it was when we watched the show on our 27"" analog SD TVs (hereinafter known as ""The Olden Days"").  I am pleased to say that the transfer for Season 6 is MUCH improved.

But at least they improved the menu structure from what it was in the first couple of seasons, where they even separated the integral ""Previously, on NYPD Blue"" from the rest of the program, for some weird reason only they knew.

I recommend this program to anybody who appreciates the dramatic arts, excellent script writing, fine acting, and gripping drama.",1407715200,,1764,5.150877192982456
6014283,5,B00FM4S8H6,"Andy Sipowicz may be the best developed character in the history of television.  Greatly flawed, but a man of true humanity and passion.
Dennis Franz never failed to give you something extra.  Top to bottom, this cast told life-changing stories.  It is so great that these are finally being released.  It's a shame they have to be bare-bones collections with little extra.  But, after all, it's the shows that count.  This was an outstanding season building toward a climax that wias concluded the next season that was as heart-tugging as television has ever been.  Every season is pure gold.",1407542400,3,592,4.91919191919192

6014286,5,B00FM4S8H6,"In 2006, the DVD set of NYPD Blue Season 4 came out, and like most people who love this show, I couldn't wait for the rest of the series.  Then a year went by, and nothing.  Then another year, and another, and on and on.  For all those years, my hope for ever seeing more NYPD Blue on DVD dwindled to nothing, especially after Amazon added the whole series to their Prime Instant Video library.  Well, the impossible has happened!  It's still  hard to believe that I'm watching this show on DVD instead of streaming it on the computer.  The picture and sound are excellent, and it's great to finally see the next season sitting on the shelf.  I'm a little disappointed that there are no special features, as the first four seasons had cast interviews and documentaries.  But I didn't really expect any, honestly, because it's been so long since the show was on and since the first four seasons came out.  I'm not exaggerating when I say I'm thrilled to finally have this, and to see that Season 6 is now available, and Season 7 is set to be releaseed on September, 30 2014.  It's been a long wait, but it's over now.  Whoever is responsible, thank you!

As for Season 5 itself, I got into NYPD Blue later in the series and didn't see all of the episodes when they aired. I saw a lot of the re-runs in syndication, but not all. I'd been hanging on the whole Joe Salvo cliffhanger for years before Amazon put the show on instant video, wondering if Sipowicz offed him to protect Bobby. If you haven't been able to watch it on Prime, you finally get closure on that cliffhanger from Season 4!

Other highlights of this season include Sipowicz showing growth as a father and husband, and the progression of relationships for Bobby Simone and Diane, as well as James Martinez and Gina. The show doesn't back off of its trademark graphic content, giving viewers an up-close look at the daily tragedies that occur in a big city like NYC.  Sadly, this is the last full season for Jimmy Smits.  He has a short run in Season 6 to finish off his character, which was one of the best in the show's history, as well as cop shows in general.  If you're a big fan of Blue's second, third, and fourth seasons, you get one more round to enjoy the core cast of the show's glory years.  I, for one, am overjoyed to finally get the chance.",1406937600,,2319,4.378504672897196

6014291,4,B00FM4S8H6,"If you're looking for special features or fancy packaging or anything beyond a collection of the Season 5 episodes of NYPD Blue, you will be disappointed. I don't worry about special features--I usually don't even watch them--so that wasn't a problem with me. I am just relieved that this season is finally out on DVD, and looks like the others will be coming down the pike. There has sure been a range of quality in how this series' DVDs have been presented (I have seasons 2--5). Season 2 is fancy, with lots of disks, lots of special features, and a little booklet describing all the shows. Great, no problem. Visually, fine. The audio was somewhat disappointing--it sounds like it is meant to be played on a stereo system (probably alongside a big screen tv) and since I have just a laptop, the sound came across like...hm, kinda like a speaker phone. Distant sounding, and none too loud. Seasons 3 & 4 were both put out on double-sided discs, and I hate them. The visual and audio quality are ok (at least we're off the speaker phone) but the discs make me nervous to handle, since there are two vulnerable sides (plus it is just irritating trying to read the itty-bitty markings to try to figure out which side is which). So this season, going back to the one-sided discs, is a great improvement over *those*. Quality of video and sound on these are fine (I was concerned after reading some of the early reviews, but my concerns seem to have been unfounded).

I would have appreciated a booklet, like the one in the Season 2 set, that describes the shows a little better (the included descriptions in this set are very difficult to read in some places) but I am mostly just pleased to have the show, to be able to see the stories again--the stories are what the show is all about, after all.",1405296000,3,1797,4.529230769230769

6014308,5,B00FM4S8H6,"That was the question during the first season when it came to who was going to be the star and who was going to wind up ""second banana"". In fact, the description of the pilot episode in the Season One DVD set was all about John Kelly as played by David Caruso. Suave and urbane in the way you wouldn't expect of a New York City street cop. Almost like author Stuart Woods' character Stone Barrington as described in his long-running series of novels if Barrington was a redhead like Kelly rather than blond-haired as Woods has written him. On the other hand, Dennis Franz's Andy Sipowicz wasn't even mentioned by name in that episode's synopsis--merely as Kelly's ""partner with a drinking problem"".

But Franz had had the chance to hone the character in an earlier, forgettable incarnation as the obnoxious Lt. Norman Buntz on Steven Bochco's earlier ""Hill Street Blues"", to where Buntz's ""descendant"" Sipowicz in this series has evolved into the most complex and interesting fictional TV cop ever. ""Blue's"" chief competitor ""Law & Order"" in its 20-year run turned over the entire cast--cops and lawyers alike--to where nobody in their inaugural season starring cast was still there at the end, but Sipowicz with various partners and commanders just kept on keepin' on, year after year. This is something that I'm not sure could be duplicated today, with the prevailing social stigma surrounding obesity. The Surgeon General has proclaimed obesity to be one of the most serious diseases out there and bada bing!--fat people are ""the new nerd"". At this writing, a certain state governor has hinted at Presidential ambitions, but the way he tips the scales is enough in and of itself that not very many people really take that (or him) very seriously.

So now in this fifth season, it's clear that it's primarily Sipowicz, and his partners--while not really ""second bananas"" as such--have at least been interchangeable over the years. Jimmy Smits replaced Caruso during the sophomore season, while Caruso departed to head up ""CSI Miami"". That took care of the series' ""buddy flick"" aspect, which it had shared with most other cop procedurals in TV history. Next season, Smits is replaced by the boyish Rick Schroder under circumstances that the unwritten ""spoiler"" rule forbids me to describe. Not that any of us who are the series' fans can't remember anyway. But twelve seasons with an overweight lead whose temperament isn't exactly that of John Goodman as he appeared in ""Roseanne""! That's three times as good as the 4-year run of ""Highway Patrol"" starring Broderick Crawford as the gruff, micromanaging Chief Dan Matthews! At least we can hope it will also be twelve seasons for our DVD purposes. A fairly well-known re-release company who I'm not sure I'm allowed to name here came out with this season set in January after a 7-1/2 year hiatus and is set to release the Sixth Season in late June.

No tension.  At least the writers restrained their need to populate this season with strawmen for easy, politically correct homilies.

WRT the CD, no subtitles!  Special features-- forget it.  Incredible.  Even the season one set had subtitles.

6014317,3,B00FM4S8H6,"Very happy that more seasons of NYPD Blue are being released on DVD.  However, as to the mastering of the DVD itself; I find the audio quality (especially the dialogue) on the Season 5 DVD by Shout Factory to be worse than the Season 1-4 DVDs released by 20th Century Fox.  The audio seems muddy and highly compressed with poor dynamic range.  I often have to replay lines of dialogue to verify what the characters are saying.  This was not an issue for me on the older season 1-4 sets.  Also, I notice that the Season 5 set does not have chapters within the individual episodes, which makes it harder to find a specific scene.  Finally, the Season 5 DVD menus are clearly formatted for widescreen, while the show itself is 4:3.  Video quality is OK, but not really as good as some other dramas I have on DVD.  Overall, this suggests that less than maximum effort was put into this Season 5 DVD release.  Still, better to have it than to not have it.

Edit: May 5, 2014.  I wanted to add that the audio quality I commented on in this review seemed to improve somewhat after the first disc or two, and now that I'm near the end of the season, I think the video quality has also improved a notch.",1396483200,5,1194,4.309417040358745

6014321,5,B00FM4S8H6,This is one of the greatest shows ever and it's criminal that we had to wait for so long to enjoy it again. The powers that be should be ashamed of themselves. I sincerely hope that we won't have to wait for the remainder of this superb show to be released. All the fifth season did was wet my appetite again. I am impatiently waiting.,1395532800,,335,4.1692307692307695

The packaging is just fine as well. There are no liner notes, just the list of the episodes and a short description on the inside covers. You have to take out the discs to read it. As for Season 5, there is a little too much ""Bobby and Diane"" for me but that's OK. The rest of the show makes up for that.",1395100800,,458,3.831578947368421

I'm am a big NYPD blue fan from germany. There are only season one and two on DVD in germany, so I have to take the english version. When there are english subtitles I can follow the story, but without it's too fast and hard to understand (why do they not speak oxford english in NY? ;-)

My conclusion: Without subtitles the box is useless for me (and maybe other foreign fans).",1394928000,5,383,4.2465753424657535

6014329,5,B00FM4S8H6,"OK, so technically I understand some of the complaints regarding this release. But, I will take what I can get. I loved this series. I did not really get into it until the mid nineties, and spent Saturday nights watching it in syndication with my little dog curled up on the couch with me. At this rate, I will be dead if and when future seasons are released. If you like gritty police drama, intense human feelings, and great story lines that don't always follow the obvious, this is the show for you. If you missed it the first time, watch it now and get hooked like me and thousands of other viewers.",1393977600,2,603,4.345132743362832

6014335,5,B00FM4S8H6,"I had all  but given  up...on Season 5...I had concluded,that the DVD/Blu Ray media preference had just been drying up.. and the only way I would ever see it would be ""bootleg"" or on the Amazon Prime route.

Of course, this was my all time favorite cop show, back when it was on television. I watched it fairly religiously.  It was on television so long, and I moved so often that time in my life, I can remember all the homes I traveled from, and remember where I lived when it ended.  Thinking back to that long list of residences, and all that I experienced, is very telling about the truly engrossing lifetime of experience NYPD blue afforded to my seemingly pathetic life.  NYPD's plot-lines, added excitement to a time in my life that was very dark.

Season 5 is a great continuation of Season 4, back when television, with out ""binge watching"" in one complete week, an entire season afforded by services like Netflix and Hulu, gave us ""cliffhangers.""  We don't know the status of Jimmy Smits character when Season 5 starts, and what will happen to him?  It's a complete mystery.  Thankfully, we get to enjoy Smits' acting for at least (1?)  more episode in Season 5. And considering he's on the cover of the DVD set...well I'll let you do the math.

Do not hesitate to pick this one up. It will give you your NYPD Blue fix and maybe,just maybe, encourage releases of Seasons 6 - 12?...We can only hope.",1393632000,,1409,4.503937007874016
6014336,5,B00FM4S8H6,Great series and shouldn't have taken so long to get Season 5 out the door.  The best part of the series is when Andy officially becomes the main character.,1393200000,,156,4.379310344827586

6014338,5,B00FM4S8H6,"After waiting eight long years I finally have another season to add to my shelf.  I very much enjoyed the content THAT's why the five stars. But I have to say my disappointment came with the way they axed the motion screens in the menus. I enjoyed them.  Static main menu with no scenes menu. Just seems cheep to me.  Are they that strapped for cash they couldn't match the previous releases?  With ALL the fans buying this it feels like a slap in the face.  Sorry, that's how I feel. So, I brace myself more further disappointment at further releases (if they come at all)  Maybe it is because they feel more people are purchasing content ""on-line"" and don't want to sink any money into a DVD release?  I LIKE having the actual DVD.. old-fashioned or not. That's all if anybody cares.",1393027200,,785,4.4475524475524475

I'd pay anything if they were just to release 5-12 all at once. I need this in my collection, my favorite show of all time. PLEASE DON'T STOP WITH 5!!!!!!!!!!! and don't don't make us wait 7 years for the 6th",1381968000,67,341,4.104477611940299
