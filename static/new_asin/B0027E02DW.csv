8354615,5,B0027E02DW,"All of Ron Hood's videos are excellent and this one is no exception.  Hood does his homework in order to bring viewers the best information in the survival field.  In this case, he showcases two knife makers who use traditional techniques to forge quality tools out of scrap metal and junk.  These knife makers, instead of using stock reduction methods (expensive grinders and so forth), show viewers how to make a quality blade from start to finish using little else than a simple charcoal-fired forge.  Tai Goo and Tim Lively walk viewers through the process step-by-step, beginning with forge construction through the entire knife-making process.  This video is empowering because it shows what can be done with a few inexpensive tools and a little bit of ingenuity.  I highly recommend this video for folks interested in constructing knives or other similar tools on a budget.",1361059200,,880,5.0344827586206895
8354616,5,B0027E02DW,"The neo tribal knifemaking guild members were in both videos. They show you how to make knives with the most basic tools. I have asked the local library to order both DVD's. Simple tools, charcoal, simple home made forge, and can be used in a residential area. A cheap fun little hobby, what is not to love.",1354838400,,307,4.4035087719298245
8354617,5,B0027E02DW,"This was made especially for the people who want to make something real, useful, one of a kind, and functional, crafted from reclaimed steel, Earth friendly, and meant to be used NOT stashed in a vault somewhere as a collectible.

I loved this DVD only for the fact that Tai Goo is a Master of incredably beautiful and functional Blades without spending a ton of cash for high end tools, that frankly are not necessary for the person who may make 20 knives in their lifetime. Warning here: if you are determined to become a professional machinist type Loveless knifemaker who will be producing several, (as in over a Hundred), of the exact same blade, each one exactly like it's brother, or if you are going to carry your blades with Model number allocations, this DVD won't help you... except that it may show you how to get started today doing what you really want to do which is create knives, so you can get a cash flow started, so you can go buy that machine shop with the CNC toys the big boys have...but...

If you are a Do-It-Yourselfer on a tight (as in with a Family), budget and cash isn't a luxury, then this is the Instructional DVD for you... You don't need the big guy tools to make professional working serious blades.  In the Tradition of James Black and the Thousands of Smiths who put blades into the hands of those who needed them, you can't do any better. Tai Goo and Tim Lively have helped create a good and complete visual aid that showcases what can be done without electricity, and with tools that can still be found for a reasonable amount out there in the real world.

I also highly recommend the video/DVD that Tim Lively has produced titled ""Knifemaking Unplugged"".  Together these two DVD's would be all that a dedicated person with drive and a need to create could possible want to start making some serious blades right now, without waiting for a Lottery windfall.

8354618,5,B0027E02DW,"I had been meaning to purchase this product for a couple of years.  If I had known how good the information was I would not have waited until now.  The techniques are straight forward and interesting to watch whether you ever do any bladesmithing or not.  I have been forging knives and swords for more than thirty years and thought it was funny to see others doing it similar to my way.  Both Tia Goo and Tim Lively know what they are doing, I would highly recommend this video to any aspiring knife maker who does not think he has the equipment to start bladesmithing.  You do not have to spend a lot of money, you just need to be inventive and this video plainly shows this idea.

I really need to say something about ""artisan_ideas"" who I purchased this video through and ""Karen Hood"" who produced the film.  My copy of this video never worked right from day one, I thought it was my DVD player.  Bought new player 6 months after purchase, still problems.  E-mailed the two above mentioned.  They jumped into action no questions, new DVD on the way, hope you enjoy it.  Now that is customer service!!!!  Because of this service I am excited to order more products and tell my friends about these people who go the extra mile to make sure you are happy.  Great job!  Order from ""artisan_ideas"" they will make sure you are happy with your purchases.",1291420800,2,1351,4.461224489795918
