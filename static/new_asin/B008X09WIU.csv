8531565,5,B008X09WIU,This is a review for the Japanese  Blu-Ray release specifically. If anyone is wondering if this release suffers from the horrible DNR (digital noise reduction) scrubbing that has plagued earlier Blu-Ray releases of this film the answer is NO! It looks great from the scenes I have scanned through. The first half of the Chinese region free release that I picked up has one of the worst DNR jobs I've ever seen. Much of the fine detail has been removed apparently in an effort to clean it up but it results in an almost cartoon-like appearance in some scenes. From what I have read the German and Australian releases are the same print as the one that I had. So in my opinion this is the best release of this film to date!  Also I should mention that it is region A (or possibly region-free) and plays just fine on my US Blu-Ray player.,1429574400,,835,4.415584415584416

Read the plot and how Disney was afraid to release it in the U.S. on Wikipedia.",1420502400,,206,3.7674418604651163
