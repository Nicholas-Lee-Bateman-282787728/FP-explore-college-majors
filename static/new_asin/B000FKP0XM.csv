8124080,5,B000FKP0XM,Loved the Wrath of God video about the Buffalo blizzard of 1977. Brought back many memories of the storm of a life time.,1362182400,,120,4.260869565217392
8124081,5,B000FKP0XM,"Buffalo is known more than maybe any other American city for its severe blizzards.  The Blizzard of 1977 that hit at the end of January was one of the city's deadliest and most damaging (it claimed 29 lives), and is the subject of this History Channel DVD.  This 50-minute program describes how the blizzard hit, how people in Buffalo weathered the storm, and how badly the storm paralyzed the city (driving bans were even in effect).

The program also talks about a fire that broke out during the storm and how those with health emergencies were affected--rescuers delivered needed medications to people via snowmobile.  The Army and National Guard were eventually brought in to help and President Carter declared the counties around Buffalo disaster areas.

I was a six-year-old in Michigan at the time and remember the storm well--there were driving bans and people delivering medications via snowmobile in our area as well, and I can remember how high the drifts were, but as terrible as conditions were where we were we still did not face near what the people did a few hundred miles to the east.  This very good DVD documents a winter storm so severe that hopefully we will not see its like anytime soon.",1359331200,,1210,4.793269230769231
8124082,5,B000FKP0XM,"This is an excellent video documenting the events surrounding the Blizzard of '77.  While I did not live through the storm, I grew up hearing about how this rare weather phenomenon crippled the Western New York community.  Seeing this documentary helped put everything into context.",1356912000,,282,5.2444444444444445
8124083,4,B000FKP0XM,"The Buffalo Blizzard of 1977 was an unforgettable experience for those who lived it like thousands of others. The Buffalo Blizzard was unlike anything I have seen on television. It wasn't enough that there was so much snow but the snow blew more the soil in the Dust Bowl blanketing the upstate New York area. Thousands of People and cars were stranded. The city of Buffalo was paralyzed by the snow itself. People would spend days in hotel lobbies, office buildings, and other places unable to get to their homes for days. You couldn't forget such a storm.

The documentary that aired on the HIstory Channel has some memorable stories like the mother who tells about sending her baby boy son on a life-saving mission to Buffalo to get the necessary medical assistance to survive and live for some more years. There is another story of a police office who stopped at a home where a woman had just lost her husband after a long illness. The police officer had to explain that it would take a few days before help could even arrived. The officer recalled that the woman had lived with him for decades and she could take care of him -dead or alive a few days longer.

The stories are only a few with the clips of the unbelievable amount of snow in Buffalo. One of the city's directors remembered hearing the phrase, ""Where are the plows?"" whether he was at a piano bar or  around town. The Buffalo Blizzard was one of a kind and hasn't happened since. The memories are gut-wrenching and memorable.

My only complaint is that there wasn't more to the documentary here including special features.",1338768000,,1591,4.6113074204946995
8124084,3,B000FKP0XM,"I believe that along with the dying local economy (Ie Steel Industry), this blizzrd just finally put a lot of people over the top and sent a lot of people packing  out of the region...an exodus that is going to reverse itself, and has already started. Give Buffalo another 10 years and it will be thriving like Pittsburgh....It is already starting.",1256515200,,348,4.704918032786885
8124085,4,B000FKP0XM,As a broadcast professional who lived through this event - this brought back some memories and presents a true picture from the inside.,1242172800,2,135,4.913043478260869
