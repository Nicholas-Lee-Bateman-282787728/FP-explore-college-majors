8622972,5,B00GGZ90OU,American Restoration is one my favorite shows to watch and I was glad when this DVD was released. I just wish they would come out faster. I love seeing how these people turn people's old junk into something that is so close to being called a work of art and hearing the stories about and behind the items that are restored.,1388793600,,323,4.311475409836065
8622973,5,B00GGZ90OU,"We truly wish History would show every Full Season with their Episodes (same goes for Pawn Stars, Pickers & Counting Cars!) Be that as it may: 1st 1 on this Disc is 1 of my Favorites: Ridin' Route 66 (featuring Angel the Barber in AZ). I've visited him many a time. Always so sweet & kind. We need MORE folks like him. Anyway: there are 16 Episodes on these 2 discs ending with Hot & Salty. We admire how Rick & Company can turn a pile of stuff into a work of art! Looking forward to the new Season!!!",1388016000,2,501,4.070707070707071
