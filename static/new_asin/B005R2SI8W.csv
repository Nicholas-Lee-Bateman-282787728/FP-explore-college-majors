4860839,5,B005R2SI8W,"This movie came out when I was ten years old, and I loved it. I taped it years ago from tv and recently watched it again. Now I'm glad I can have it on DVD. It arrived well packaged and I enjoyed it again. My two neighbors also loved it. We are horse lovers, and who doesn't love Bess?",1375747200,,285,3.847457627118644
4860840,3,B005R2SI8W,DVD looked like a burn job> Very grainy and case insert was a photo copy not a studio print.  I can't say for sure but other people have stated same when viewing movie.  I wanted the video and I accept it as that.,1370390400,,213,3.9302325581395348
4860841,3,B005R2SI8W,the story is good and it is a nice movie which means anyone under fifty will probably go out for popcorn.  I liked it as we shared it with our friend (movie night),1369180800,,163,3.9393939393939394
4860842,5,B005R2SI8W,"I had taped this off the t.v. many years ago complete with the commercials and not a very good quality recording. It was a great story and I had hoped to get a professional recording to replace the one I made. Finally, you have made it available to me in DVD format. Looks terrific and the very few recording (or transfer) adjustments are inconsequential compared to having the complete movie.",1368057600,,393,4.628571428571429
4860843,5,B005R2SI8W,Gallent Bess I saw it as a child shed many tears and loved it then. It is just the same now!,1357171200,,92,3.4285714285714284
4860844,5,B005R2SI8W,"Here is another 'feel good' movie that relates a tale of love and devotion that are classic family 'values' at their best!  Keep a box of tissues handy though as there are some VERY moving scenes that will elicit both tears of joy and of sorrow.  In spite of it's above average price tag this feature is worth EVERY penny IMO.  Get your popcorn ready, sit down with the family and enjoy a genuinely 'wholesome' movie!",1356566400,,417,4.4605263157894735
4860845,5,B005R2SI8W,Fell in love with story when I was a child.  Brought back good memories.  Maybe the story might be a little hokey but it's great for kids.  And I'm a big kid at heart.,1346803200,,167,3.8529411764705883
4860846,5,B005R2SI8W,"I've loved this movie from the first time I saw it!  Now I own it!  My daughter fell in love with it when she was a child...and I'll give it to her when I get tired of watching it!! LOL
There is some beautiful scenery around the ranch where Bess lives.

It's a good movie, even if you're not into horses, because it has a good story without too much blood and guts war scenes, yet there is some action too.  A little heart wrenching as most animal movies are...but it all works out ok!",1339545600,4,485,4.073684210526316
4860847,5,B005R2SI8W,"Yes, it's an old movie and based on a true story but there is so much heart in this small film that it is timeless.  There isn't a dry eye in the house when we play this movie but luckily it is in the middle so the ending is that much more satisfying.  Be warned: there are war scenes but not terribly graphic. This is the original starring a young Marshall Thompson.  The horse in this movie is the real(war-hero)Bess.  Rent it first if you can because, of course, it is over-priced as they have to make it to order and you can't please everyone.",1333324800,2,547,4.180952380952381
8484021,5,B005R2SI8W,"This was a movie I watched as a kid, and dearly wanted to see it again.  I know it was rather corney, but felt the same way as when I was a kid watching it.",1477353600,,156,3.4571428571428573
8484022,5,B005R2SI8W,I saw this movie as a kid and I loved it just as much all these years later!!! It's the kind of movie they don't make much anymore and thats saf!,1433289600,,145,3.7096774193548385
8484023,5,B005R2SI8W,super great movie!!!,1430870400,,20,6.0
8484024,3,B005R2SI8W,"I expected Warner Bros to have a much better quality copy. It is very watchable but if you have a recorded TCM copy from TV it will be much nicer. This classic is worth having and worth buying and still good enough to watch, however, I just expected it to be as good as my TV copy. The three stars is based on quality of DVD picture and sound not based on the great film. Do not let my review discourage from buying because most everyone will still be happy and picture is still very decent.",1426291200,,491,4.125

8484028,5,B005R2SI8W,"I had not seen this movie in 20 years, in fact it took me a few weeks to remember the name. it is a tear jerker, so have the hanks handy. Great movie for animal lovers.",1405296000,,168,3.6944444444444446
8484029,5,B005R2SI8W,I remember seeing this as a kid.  Loved it then and still love it today.  I'm very glad to see it offered here at Amazom.,1393200000,,121,3.8
