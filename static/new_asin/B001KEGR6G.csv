3665571,5,B001KEGR6G,This movie is a remake or Shaw Brothers version of the classic The Three Outlaws. The story reflects the plight of the poor under a ruthless lord. This is a very early introduction of Jimmy Wang Yu and Lo Lieh. Both of these actors would go on to star in future film roles which would define their careers (IE Jimmy Wang Yu -  The One Armed Boxer & Lo Lieh - Pai Mei) but it is good to see them in something that shows their roots. The video was crisp and this edition was subtitled. The dvd arrived pristine with no case damage.,1410048000,2,529,4.135922330097087
3665572,5,B001KEGR6G,This was a good movie. The story line was okay as well. I needed this for my collection; I would buy it again.,1376524800,,110,3.8260869565217392
3665573,4,B001KEGR6G,"This DVD is the earliest Shaw Brothers film directed by Chang Cheh available stateside (legitimately), and it's an essential purchase for fans of the prolific director....After ""Tiger Boy"" (""One-Armed Swordsman"" came two films later), Cheh oversaw a remake of the 1964 Japanese movie ""Three Outlaw Samurai"" (""Sanbiki No Samurai""), directed by Hideo Gosha. (It's another reminder of how Shaw filmmakers drew inspiration from Japanese cinema; they even hired Japanese cinematographers to enhance the looks of the films! ""Three Outlaw Samurai"" is also on DVD; however, it appears to be out-of-print, so a copy won't be easy to get. I haven't seen it, unfortunately! Anyone who has seen BOTH of these, PLEASE share your opinions in this forum!) Cheh also adapted the screenplay himself; this, too, would become a thing of the past as his workload increased, and he sought the use of (or collaborated with) other screenwriters. The end product succeeds despite the limits of the budget (mostly shot indoors); it's NO epic like ""The Water Margin"", but smaller in scale (storywise), though the events occur in the the background of a greater conflict. The ""Trio"" itself is well cast; Jimmy Wang Yu, Lo Lieh and Cheng Lei each get their moments to shine, be it from swordplay or by dramatics alone. (Without giving away plot points, I think the highly-underrated Lei has, arguably, the most interesting role here. Watch it, and you're bound to agree!) Compared to later Cheh films, the four ladies found in the cast (Margaret Tu Chuan, Chin Ping, Fanny Fan and Violet Pan Yingzi) contribute significantly to the storyline; they're NOT mere ""red herrings"" OR ""eye candy""! (At the same time, some have pointed to Cheh's purported usage of symbolism that conveyed the notion the ""old days"" of Hong Kong action cinema--where the ladies STARRED--were changing. Look at the opening titles: the three female leads are given top billing, BUT it is the in-the-flesh ""Trio"" one sees FIRST! However it's interpeted, Cheh's theme of brotherhood--or ""yang gang""--was beginning to be heard.) Add to this a fine supporting cast (including Ku Feng, Wu Ma, Tien Fang, Lee Wan Chung, even Unicorn Chan!), plus the fight choreography of Lau Kar Leung and Tong Gaai, and it all combines well in a movie that draws the viewer in with its EMOTIONAL content, not just the ACTION! If one plays this Image release, and follows it up with ""The Five Venoms"", they may be stupefied that these two classics--as different as night and day--were BOTH directed by Chang Cheh! Are his earlier films BETTER than his ""Venoms"" films? Take a look at ""The Magnificent Trio"", along with ""One-Armed Swordsman"", ""Vengeance!"", ""The Heroic Ones"" and ""Disciples Of Shaolin"" (e.g.); compare them with one's favorite ""Venoms"" flicks (viewer's choice), and one MIGHT be surprised at the conclusion they reach!...A rare ""impulse"" buy of mine that turned out to be money well INVESTED!...All the best, Brother Fang.

3665574,4,B001KEGR6G,"Another Shaw Brothers production, The Magnificent Trio, 1966, is a Martial Arts visionary to be seen, - a soldier stumbles into a plot of kidnapping and finds out the real reason why the townspeople are revolting against the greedy Govt. official who steals from them, which in turn the townspeople start a petition, to be handed over to the elite general, loaded with action and swordplay and magnificently restored and remastered, this film, The Magnificent Trio delivers the goods, starring, Jimmy Wang Yu,(Master Of The Flying Guillotine}, Lo Lieh {Five Fingers Of Death), and directed by the legendary Chang Cheh, 16x9 widescreen, original Mandarin with English subtitles, plus 16 Shaw Brothers trailers included, Image entertainment, I will say the remastering for this film is visually brilliant, it's hard to comprehend this film was shot in 1966.",1237766400,6,855,5.294117647058823

8314841,4,B001KEGR6G,This is very much above average in plot and story.  Good action and character development. Not the usual junk plot separating Kung Fu action.,1506384000,,141,4.875
8314842,4,B001KEGR6G,"I see from other reviews that this is a remake of ""Three Outlaw Samurai"". I haven't seen that movie but I while watching this film I did have the impression that it was at least inspired by a Samurai film. It is the story of three heroes who become involved in a kidnapping staged to protest the corruption and greed of a venal Magistrate. The plot is straight forward and well paced. The heroes seek to withstand the Magistrate's ever escalating attempts to rescue his daughter before the arrival of the righteous Minister Yuan.
This is an excellent Wu Xia film. It is extremely well acted. The stars are Jimmy Wang Yu as the heroic, yet disillusioned, soldier; Cheng Lui as his loyal subordinate; and Lo Lieh as the rogue of questionable motivation.  While strong performances, they are all working within the solid performances in variations of the brooding chivalrous swordsman. The supporting cast is where the acting really shines. All deliver stellar performances without resorting to cliche. Tien Feng, Cliff Lok & Ku Feng (my all time favorite Shaw Bros. character actor) are terrific as the trio of decent men driven to kidnapping by desperation. The women, unusual for a Chang Cheh film, are given a chance to shine, especially  Margaret Tu Chuan & Chin Ping.
  The fighting choreographed by Liu Chia-Liang and Tong Kai is good for the time. Their is none of the one slash by the hero and 10 opponents are dead, nor is there a lot of bouncing around on trampolines.
 All in all I would highly recommend this film. While not a masterpiece it is a strong movie.",1471392000,5,1570,4.7153284671532845
8314843,4,B001KEGR6G,"Jimmy Wang Yu, Ku Feng and Lo Lieh were awesome in this movie. As I said before the Shaw Brothers movies are the best if you are into that sort of thing.",1463702400,,153,3.8125
