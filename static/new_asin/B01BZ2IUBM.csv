8751951,2,B01BZ2IUBM,"The musical works presented are definitely important and ground breaking, and the interpretations of the works are great. But I really have a problem with the presentation. The introductions to the works  remain painfully on the surface. There is no meaningful analysis as to why the music was groundbreaking at the time of composition, nor is there any comparison to musical styles which were considered main stream at the time. The 'art' videos are badly produced and use default settings of plugins, which make them appear really cheap. I bought this for my students and feel ashamed to have wasted my school's budget on it - I would have been better off buying audio recordings of the works and written my own introductions to them.",1473897600,2,736,4.888
8751952,5,B01BZ2IUBM,"It is a profound and extremely well presented story of the music of the 20th century. An importante gap is the lack of mention of the Brazilian composer Heitor Vila Lobos certainly one of the giants of the 20th century music. In any case, Simon Rattle is a great tutor and a great ""maestro""",1469232000,,290,4.388888888888889
8751953,5,B01BZ2IUBM,"I am a fan of Sir Simon Rattle. Here he is conducting his ""home"" orchestra, the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, from which he became the conductor of my favorite orchestra, The Berlin Philharmonic. I bought and enjoy this set because it is a documentary about the composers, compositions, and their milieu, not just a group of concerts (a group of Rattle concerts would always be enjoyable--you can assemble all you want from the BP Digital Concert Hall or on DVD's). Blu-Ray seems to me perhaps a bit of an over-kill compared to the DVD set in both the recorded sound and video, but for the price it is nice to have only three discs.

""Simon Rattle leads viewers on an exhilarating journey through the music of our time, explaining the chief musical developments from Mahler to the present day...The range is wide and this series samples the work of over thirty composers, discovering new and challenging sounds as well as some unexpectedly familiar music.""

A really wonderful, and educational, set.",1464393600,,1008,4.888888888888889
