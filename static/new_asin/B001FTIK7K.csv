8459384,1,B001FTIK7K,"Purchased this with great hope, only to find out that this set is in FRENCH ONLY!! No English subtitles. The description page does not mention this at all.

Great movies, movie you cannot follow without dialect. PLEASE DO NOT MAKE THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE DVD IS WITH ENGLISH SUBTITLES SINCE ITS A REGION 1 NORTH AMERICAN RELEASE.

This was released for French Canadians and not Americans.",1256860800,12,388,4.863636363636363
