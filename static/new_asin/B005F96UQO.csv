4673194,5,B005F96UQO,"If you liked the Haruhi Suzumiya series, you'll love this.  If you like anime in general, you'll enjoy this.  If you're completely new to the series and the genre, you'll probably at least appreciate this.

The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya works best as a supplement to early parts of the series.  While it can probably be understood and appreciated as a standalone movie, its true strength is in its continuation of the plots and character development set up by the earlier works.  This movie builds on its predecessors both as a supplement to them and as a spiritual retelling of the first novel (though I can't go into the details without entering spoiler territory).

Other people and other websites can give you a plot summary, so I won't bother with that.  I will tell you that it has stunning visuals, a beautiful soundtrack, and a pretty decent plot with several twists and turns.  The animation is good for anime but nowhere near, say, Disney quality.  Still, it's not BAD.  I've only see the Japanese version, so I can't speak to the dubbing quality; however, I will say that the Japanese voice actors do an excellent job.

In summary, this is an excellent movie for anyone who has more than a passing interest in anime, and a must-have for anyone who enjoyed The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya.",1314921600,4,1308,4.743362831858407
4673195,5,B005F96UQO,"The disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya is based on the light novel by Nagaru Tanigawa. *note, I have seen it, and will try not release spoilers on this post* This is a continuation of the Haruhi series. Clocking in at almost 3 hours long, it is one of the longest anime movies Ive seen. This takes place around the middle of December where Haruhi is planning a Christmas party for the SOS Brigade.

About a day later (end of the prologue) Kyon wakes up and finds out that everyone except him, has forgotten Haruhi even existed. It is a world where Haruhi never existed. He has no idea what caused it, or what he's suppose to do to fix everything. Yuki, who in this is a scared timid girl, who smiles when happy, and even cries. A certain character makes a return appearance. A person other than Haruhi also goes missing. And everyone thinks Kyon is crazy when he lashes out about Haruhi.

It is truly an excellent film, and was HIGHLY rated among anime communities. Note that to understand alot of this movie you have to have seen seasons one and two, lest you be lost in the multiple references to earlier episodes. Personally I bought the movie with English subs, and watch it multiple times. I cant wait for this release (disregard this statement after its release).

This movie keeps your attention throughout the whole thing, and when you think its over, your only half-way through, with a very satisfying end. This movie delivers exactly what Haruhiists have been hoping for since its announcement.",1314835200,43,1502,4.660377358490566
4673196,5,B005F96UQO,"Kyon wakes up one day to find his whole world has changed. None of his friends recognize him, not even the unflappable NAGATO Yuki. What's more, Haruhi is no where to be found. So starts a clever twisting, turning story in the Haruhi Suzumiya universe. And it is one of the best. If you are a fan of the original television series, this show is an absolute must. But even if you aren't, or have never seen anything Haruhi related, this film can stand alone and is a joy to watch. The art is crisp, the story-telling is compelling, the drama - with all the twists and loopholes - is engrossing, and you get the chance to see Yuki with a more rounded personality! Sadly, to say much more about the story would give too much away. Suffice to say, Nagaru Tanigawa somehow keeps his overlapping stories straight, no matter how many times Kyon time travels.

Among the stories that Nagaru Tanigawa has penned in the Haruhi series, this is among the very best. On top of that, the production quality of the film is top-shelf. If you own a Haruhi anime, this should be it. If you are an anime collector, this should be in your collection. I would say more, but I am usually critical and this time have nothing to be critical about.",1314662400,18,1223,4.411504424778761

4673198,5,B005F96UQO,"For anyone who has watched the series, this movie rocks.  It serves as an all-around perfect ending to the story.  One caveat:  if you haven't watched the series, ABSOLUTELY watch it first.  To really understand what is going on, you need to have watched both seasons of the show (Note that the second season takes place in the middle of the first season, but that really doesn't matter so much for this review).  Anyway, watch the entire show, and then watch this movie!

I thought it was better than the show, honestly.  An easy 5 stars.",1401753600,,539,4.552083333333333
4673199,5,B005F96UQO,"The beauty of this movie speaks for itself. For long time Haruhi fans, this is the season 2 we deserved because this lengthy, but well written story, could have easily replaced the infamous second season we were given. For new fans, its a bit of twist and can still be enjoyed but to truly understand its somewhat complex story, you have to know what happened in the actual series. Kyoto Animation outdid themselves with the art work, music choice and storytelling in this masterpiece (Its not perfect, but its definitely a true gift to the anime fan base).

My movie came in a beautiful unopened condition and the first time I played it on my PS3, I was blown away by the visuals. The blu-ray version is definitely worth it in my opinion. I would recommend this to not just old or new Haruhi fans, but anime fans in general just because of the obvious amount of talent poured into this piece.",1401062400,,893,4.512345679012346
4673200,5,B005F96UQO,"I absolutely love this series, and enjoyed the movie a lot. This movie is the blu-ray dvd combo, so you can watch it on either device.",1390953600,,134,4.1923076923076925
4673201,5,B005F96UQO,This time taking place after the show (I believe) we see another reality that Kyon is in and is trying to find a way out. I find the film terrific since it followed the light novel. It is a fantastic film.,1389657600,,205,4.024390243902439
4673202,4,B005F96UQO,"There are enough in depth reviews already, so why be redundant?  This is a cliff notes version:  It was indeed a good film, but it could have been 1/2 hour shorter.  There were some parts that were drawn out a bit too long, like Kyon walking around the table in the club room twice before finally sitting on a chair... then just sitting there doing nothing.  When you add up about a dozen such instances it amounts to a nice chunk of time that could have been spared, and made the story seem more fluent and less monotonous.  Do this and it earns 5 stars.",1388361600,,555,4.247619047619048
4673203,4,B005F96UQO,the disc were all in great condition my only complaint is that the back of the case ad a few tears in the plastic,1387929600,,113,3.75
4673204,5,B005F96UQO,"I'm not typically a fan of anime or manga, most examples of it that end up coming to the west are; for lack of a better word; trash. In my opinion, anyways. I also don't speak or read Japanese, nor am I willing to learn the language simply to enjoy the good examples of the medium. Perhaps it's my loss, whatever.

That said, my generally bleak opinion of anime/manga only makes the genuinely good examples of it that much more enjoyable, so believe me when I say that the Haruhi Suzumiya series is seriously enjoyable and the movie is no different.

While it's considerably darker and more melancholic than the show that leads up to it, it does a great job of tying everything together and making the high points of the series even higher. However, that means that you'll definitely want to watch the two seasons of the show before tackling the movie if you want to understand and appreciate most of what's going on.",1386028800,,917,4.518072289156627
4673205,5,B005F96UQO,I enjoyed every minute of this movie even more so than the show. It was extremely entertaining and a must have for any Haruhi Suzumiya fans.,1385942400,,140,4.423076923076923
4673206,5,B005F96UQO,love this movie! excellent addition to the series and my collection!!!! happy that its a combo with dvd and blu ray,1384473600,,115,4.523809523809524
4673207,5,B005F96UQO,"I just had to buy this after seeing how much it was, I mean the movie is amazing and it's about 2 and a half hours long, the story is incredible and trust me, you will be surprised.
To watch this movie you will have to already seen the complete series or it won't make any sense, sadly, right now the dvd collections are pretty expensive, but who knows, they might just re-release it in blu-ray some other time.

This is truly one of the best anime movies Iv'e ever, seen full of twists and with a story that is so well played it's impossible not to like it.",1384387200,,558,4.1192660550458715
4673208,5,B005F96UQO,"It is a movie that has so much going for it: plot, suspense, action, beautiful animation, beautiful music, and best of all a deep story line. A lot of anime, and I mean most, do not have the substance to have me watch them several times in a row. (exception being selections of Miyazaki films) The film has complexity to it but still manged to stays within understanding.

The only issue is that you have to have seen the series to enjoy this movie to it's fullest. The past references and the continuation of past dialogues will only get a new viewer confused. I love this film and I often see a Haruhi image/reference online and am reminded that I want to watch the movie again and again. This movie is an incredible one and by the time the ending credits run I am a broken man.

So my final word:
  -If you have seen the Haruhi series, BUY THIS COPY
  (The Blu-ray quality is a fantastic way to enjoy the animation! Online streaming doesn't do it justice.)

  -If you have yet to see Haruhi, BUY THIS and keep it on hand till you finish the anime
  (Bandai, the publisher withdrew its business in America so the copies will sky rocket in price until someone
  else picks up the licence.)

Your welcome and enjoy. :D",1383955200,,1218,4.355555555555555
4673209,5,B005F96UQO,"I absolutely love this movie. It completely surpassed my expectations and has easily become one of my favorites. While I found the series enjoyable, the movie blows it away. I honestly found myself constantly rewatching this movie after the initial viewing, an oddity for me. The only real downside I find is that the film has a prerequisite: the series it follows. A lot of moments don't quite have the power if you don't understand a few references. Better get busy watchin'. :)",1373328000,,480,4.795180722891566
4673210,5,B005F96UQO,"That was how I felt when I first saw this film at comiccon. The drama is strong, the animation is top notch, and now the English dubbing is excellent, although no doubt anime purists will prefer the original Japanese dub.

Haruhi Suzumiya is the center of the universe, and does not realize it. That is the premise of the hugely popular series adapted from the light novels. So what happens when her trusty right hand man Kyon wakes up one morning to find that not only is Haruhi Suzumiya gone, but no one else in his life seems to remember her ever being there at all? How does one forget the eccentric young girl who blackmailed the computer club and rocked out in bunny girl drag at the culture fest? What happened to Haruhi Suzumiya?

It was fantastic.",1367107200,,756,4.471014492753623
4673211,5,B005F96UQO,"This is an amazing movie! Not only is it over 2 hours of Suzumiya Haruhi, beautifully animated, it is also the series' first movie! The dual-audio sound track is awesome! Switch from Japanese audio to English, and vice-versa. I would highly recommend this movie to any Otaku out there! Support the company's development of anime and BUY THIS COMBO!! You WILL NOT BE SORRY!",1365984000,,372,4.828125
4673212,5,B005F96UQO,Long awaited movie The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya was a hit success its a great addition to the Melancholy franchise!,1365638400,,123,5.2
4673213,5,B005F96UQO,"Let me make clear here from the beginning that the 5 stars is for the movie ONLY.

The film itself is a tremendous piece of work. It is a little long, clocking in at about 2 hours and 40 minutes, but if you are familiar with the animated series, you may also be aware that they essentially took part of a what would have been a season and made it into what you have here. Still, the film itself is, for me, the golden standard when it comes to anime story telling. Some people have said that this movie was overly long and slow, but I must disagree. The pacing was spot on and worked well when compared to the series. Often times in movies and anime the ending is sort of sprung on you and you hardly have time to appreciate it. This movie allows you to savor those tender moments as the ending arrives and welcomes you to relish what it feels like to live in the shoes of the main character. When I first saw this film, I was just thinking it was going to be like the series, but if anything, it's far better. The overall quality is noticeably higher (as far as the animation) and the soundtrack is so good you might find yourself looking to purchase it as well. Be aware that this movie has constant tie ins with the series so if you've not seen both seasons 1 and 2, you better get those in before watching this or else you will simply not understand everything that is going on.

As far as the blu ray goes...

I love this anime and this movie. I really do. I just find it hard to pay $40 for a single movie. At it's current price (about $39), if you add in shipping, you are dishing out about $42-$46 depending on how you get it sent to you, plus tax (if your state charges it). Unfortunately, my state does have a sales tax so my total would be well over $46 to get the disc. For a movie, that's a lot of money. Just to give you an idea, I can get the Alien box set with 4 movies and over 50 hours of extras for $30 right now...on blu ray. Like I said, I enjoyed this movie immensely, but for someone like me, I am going to have to pass for now. I am all for supporting the people that created such a wonderful film, but there comes a time when I have to draw a line and say ""Sorry, too rich for my blood."" I know it being an import it's going to be a little more, but this was just too much.

******UPDATE****** (5/12/13)
There was a significant price drop so I sprung for the blu ray / dvd combo pack. I was also able to get free shipping so my waiting helped me save almost $20. Whomever is responsible for the price drop, thank you!

The Blu Ray transfer is magnificent. The picture is clear and the colors rich. The sound is very good, offering both an English and Japanese dub. The English dub sounded a little odd to me as I am very used to reading the subs.",1365465600,5,2771,4.058500914076783
4673214,5,B005F96UQO,"I like the Haruhi series and have seen the TV anime, so I could follow story without any issues. For anyone who liked Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuutsu, I would recommend this movie. It's good and I hate doing reviews.",1360886400,,210,4.410256410256411

4673216,5,B005F96UQO,"If you have seen any of the Haruhi series, this is a must watch. If you have not seen the second season, and do not wish to see the endless Eight, I would at least seeing ""Bamboo Leaf Rhapsody,"" as that helps set up the plot elements to this movie.
What they were able to do with this movie to the Haruhi series is quadruple the level of layering in the series, and of course have more antics involving Haruhi. After seeing this movie for the first time, I was simply stunned at the level of depth it added to the Haruhi universe. Since then, I've rewatched it 2 more times, and I am planning on watching it again soon. It's that good. Usually, I never rewatch anything, but this is such a great example of anime that it deserves an exception.",1353888000,,743,4.23943661971831

4673221,5,B005F96UQO,"I have recently been on an anime binge. Watching a lot of different anime's of a lot of different genres.
I had heard of the movie before and it was rated highly on a LOT of sites. But I thought it was overrated, though I hadn't seen it yet. I found that there was a TV series that precedes this and went to check it out. While enjoyable and sometimes touching, it didn't make me feel like the movie would be as outstanding as I had heard,
Boy, was I WRONG.
The movie starts off in a similar manner to the mood through most of the series, then takes an unexpected turn. From there on, everything id cinema magic.
I HIGHLY recommend.
Though it is not really necessary to watch the show first, I would advise doing so and holding out till the end. It makes watching the movie more worth it and enjoyable.",1352764800,,802,4.214285714285714

4673223,5,B005F96UQO,"This is an excellent movie. I love the Haruhi series and the movie is a great edition. I was surprised at how long it was though. It needs to be to accomplish everything that it did.

This movie goes in the middle of the 1st season, chronologically. It begins with the SOS Brigade preparing for their Christmas Party. The next day Kyon wakes up and his world has changed. Yuki and Mikuru don't know him, and Koizumi and Haruhi are nowhere to be found. He learns that for some reason someone has changed the world. The most likely candidate would be Haruhi......... you would think. That's all I'm gonna give ya on the plot. Any more than that would spoil it.

As you can expect the quality of this production is awesome. It is even better than the 2 seasons made before it; as far as the music and animation goes. It's a do not miss for any anime fan.",1350259200,2,851,4.3125
4673224,5,B005F96UQO,"The Disappearance of Suzumiya Haruhi is a great movie. I watched it multiple times including both the Japanese dub and English dub. Both voice casts are really good at portraying the characters and I was able to adjust quickly to the English voice actors because they did match the characters. I really can't stress enough how much good the English dub version is, and that comes from a guy watching Japanese dub shows 95% of the time.

There is a big attention to the visual detail; the movie is very well animated and the scenes are very detailed for an anime. It retains the show's style but I did notice that characters were a little more detailed and a big increase to the attention of the shadow detail (way more beautiful shadows in the movie).

The movie comes with both a bluray and DVD, and also an extras DVD. The 1080p version of the movie looks absolutely gorgeous and if I was to show off anime on a TV/screen this is the movie I would use. One thing that I didn't like is that the extras came on a DVD; I would had liked to have the extras on the bluray disc aswell or on a separate bluray disc. DVD is old-fashioned now and the image quality of the extras DVD was subpar (it looked like it was interlaced instead of progressive). Playing it on a PS3 fixed the image detail to something reasonable with the upscaling.

The DVD MOVIE DVD <--- Notice, movie DVD
The DVD Movie quality was really good for a DVD; nothing to complain about it. Progressive and better than what you'd expect from a DVD.

**If you put the Japanese dub and english subtitles, they will be yellow; just mentioning**

**Shipping took around 15-20 days but I'm living in Canada so maybe that's why**

Overall, very happy with the movie itself. Great story, my favorite part of the Haruhi serie. I would had liked the extras to be HD. I'm happy they included both a bluray and DVD, as it allows me to lend it to my friends if they wanna watch it :)",1346284800,,1934,4.373259052924791

4673227,4,B005F96UQO,After watching the first season I was very interested to see where this series would go. The second season was a failure to me. The endless summers took up most of the season and then there was the movie creation. I feel that it could have gone much further than it did. With this movie I felt that they had finally gotten on the right foot. This story is based off of the book series and I hope they keep this up. It was a much better story overall.,1338336000,2,450,4.067415730337078
4673228,5,B005F96UQO,"I have praised the bizarre world of Haruhii Suzumiya, I could never imagine a world without her. Then from out of nowhere this movie comes out.

`The Disappearance of Haruhii Suzumiya' picks up right where the show left off when one day Kyon wakes up in a world that seems a little off. Suddenly he realizes no one he has gotten close to remembers him at all and even worse the person who knows him the most is nowhere to be found. Now Kyon has to find out where Haruhii has gone and more importantly where he is!
This show is great, but the movie is something truly special. While there is very little of the paranormal in this movie what makes up for it is the characters in this story. You will experience a true emotional rollercoaster in this film and there are moments where your jaw will hit the floor in wonderment. You do have to see the show beforehand because this movie has links that go back to many episodes of the show. So like Kyon if you have not seen the two seasons of The Melancholy of Haruhii Suzumiya, you will be lost.

I have seen much anime in my life including `Grave of the Fireflies' which is one of the great films I have ever seen period, but this one comes pretty close on a character driven standpoint. Even if Anime is not your cup of tea, this is a story that really shows you how characters can make a movie work so well.  All I am hoping of is after such a great chapter in this story that it is far from over. I am hoping there is a third season of the show on the horizon real soon.",1334275200,4,1520,4.145762711864407

I will not ruin the movie for you but this movie is worth the time and Money I highly recommend it",1327017600,,426,4.2073170731707314
4673253,5,B005F96UQO,"This movie, in my mind, pulled off the impossible. It took the incredibly shallow and silly premise of the show, and created a deep, intriguing, fantastical, and bizarrely emotional movie out of it. It gives fans of the series the narrative that the material was always asking for: a story that focuses strictly on Kyon, minus most of the major supporting cast. The narrative (as the title suggests) is about what Kyon chooses to do with his life in a world where Haruhi Suzumiya has disappeared. It is a wonderful sci-fi story with an intriguing ""what if?"" premise and a nearly flawless execution of story structure, character development, and tense plot progression. Besides that, everything else about the movie also stands out. The animation is fantastic! The score is fantastic! The voice acting (dub and sub) is fantastic! This film was definitely asking for dual language DVD release in the states, and although I personally do not own a Blu-Ray player, I can see how a movie this visually stunning would be a treat to watch in HD. So, if you have a Blu-Ray, get the Blu-Ray. There are only two small caveats to this rating. One, this movie was clearly meant for people who have seen all of the TV series (both full seasons). There are so many little in jokes or references to past continuity either as jokes or in reference to the story's progression for this film to truly stand on its own. So, although I believe that this movie would be quite enjoyable to watch on its own, I think it would be an even more enjoyable experience if you have already seen both seasons of the TV series. Second, and I think everyone has commented on this by this point, the film is a tad long. It clocks in at roughly two and a half hours, and I would be lying if said there weren't a couple of parts of the movie where they were transitioning between Acts that do not drag a little. Still, the first one is not a complaint, just an observation, and the second one is a relatively minor complaint when compared with everything else about the movie that really, really works. I still think this is one of the best anime films that I have ever seen, and I can highly recommend purchasing it to everyone.

4673256,5,B005F96UQO,"This is THE BEST light novel based anime-movie. I read the novels and I loved them. I was actually suprised by the quality of the movie because IMO it is better than the novel(it's usually the opposite which the novel renders supreme compared to the movie.) The novel was very well written but it lacked two important elements which are visual and sound. The movie matched up to the novel plot wise because it closely followed the novel(I'd say 95%) and passed the novel by providing sound and visual. The characters' facial expressions are the cherry on top, namely Nagato's. The movie, however, is on the slower side. It is more like a French movie in terms of rendering every finest detail than a U.S. movie in terms of fast paced with the sacrifice of details. I have watched it three times now, and it has never failed to impressed me in terms of details, both graphic and story. But in order to fully appreciate the story, you HAVE to either read the previous novels or watch at least the first season of the TV version, because much of the story plots are inter-connected since the time line is all twisted. This is one of the reasons I love this anime(novel) series. And it is also one of the drawback, since you cannot completely understand what the movie is about by just watching it alone.

I'd put this movie above Summer War, and Sky Crawlers but below Kara no Kyokai because it lacks the final touch of depth. But keep in mind that it was never meant to have any mind boggling ideas(more of a school/romantic comedy), so it excelled in every way the author intended to.

At the end I highly recommend this anime-movie. I also recommend to watch it more than once, because like any great film production you'll see much more details.",1324598400,6,1746,4.5396825396825395

4673280,3,B005F96UQO,"The film is at the top most of Kyoto Animation production as other reviews say. The animation along with music and other audio effects are just too perfect.

However, the film is of such a slow tempo represented by the background music that uses Eric Satie a lot.
Moreover, it is one of the long pieces in Haruhi series. I personally did not enjoy the novel like aspect of this long story.
I enjoyed the TV series almost every bit (of course I understand there is a lot of controversy about Endless Eight), but I believe that is mainly due to the pop like atmosphere in the series. You can relax and have fun with the series.
When you encounter a slow tempo beautiful film like the Disappearance on the other hand, you expect something serious out of a story. I could not see anything to learn out of the story however. In the TV series, there sometimes appeared philosophical comments told by Nagato like the incompleteness theorem of Goedel or incommensurability of different theories. I could not find such gimmicks in the Disappearance.

Worse is the time leap that relates the story with the ""Sasa-no-ha Rhapsody"" episode.
The episode played a beautiful role in the TV series.
I feel the Disappearance made the unnecessary use of the episode with exaggeration.
Hence, I do not feel the film is high quality sci-fi either.

Watch it as though you are enjoying French classical music.

4673281,5,B005F96UQO,"For those of you who loved the first season, but were disappointed with the second & are asking yourself is it worth it to buy this movie? The answer is a definate YES. When I was looking for new anime a couple of years ago, The Melancholy Of Haruhi Suzumiya was one the a lot of people really seemed to like. After checking out a few episodes on-line(Okay maybe 3/4 of the series) I decided to buy the first season from Amazon & it turned out to be one of my favourites. Then came season 2, which got so repetitive that after awhile it got REALLY boring. It actually turned a lot of people off & I even read in some of these reviews that people have skipped the second season altogether. One question that I read on a lot of messageboards is whether or not you need to watch season 2 before watching this movie, I would say for the most part, No. The only episode you probably should watch is the first episode of the second season ""Bamboo Leaf Rhapsody"". Something that happens in the first episode is quite a major plot point in the movie so without seeing that episode I think most people would be kind of lost. Also something from one of the later episodes in season 2 (concerning Kyon's cat) creeps into the movie, but I really don't think if you miss the episode it will really make a difference. The whole look of the movie & the animation is A-One. The movie is over 2 hrs & 40 minutes long so you are definately getting your money's worth.

This story revolves entirly around Kyons hardship to discover what happend to Haruhi and rather or not to return to his crazy exciting life stay in this new regular life without her.

Many others have discussed the plot in detail, so I'll just briefly say that it forces Kyon to finally act rather than allow events to occur around him. (And, consequently, hopefully you enjoy either hearing Sugita or Crispin Freeman's voice a lot. I know I do.)

The only hitch, is that while this is one of the best, family-friendly anime movies that I have seen, it is nearly inaccessible to new viewers. Watching this, I considered the reaction if presenting this to a new viewer to the series, and while there is a very basic introduction to the characters, it is unfortunately insufficient to provide maximum entertainment.

Probably the weirdest thing was that some of the characters, Kyon and Koizumi in particular, looked like they'd put on some weight (could have been the baggy winter clothes), while Shamisen looked like he'd lost a few pounds (Little Sister needs to stock up on more kitty treats).

Since I'm a big fan of Nagato, I had to rate this one five stars. Her performance in the alternate dimension just made me want to reach out and give her a big hug.

4673304,4,B005F96UQO,"I realize that there are many other Amazon reviews for ""The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya,"" so I'll be brief:

THE FILM:
I enjoyed watching this high-end production of one of the most interesting story arcs in the ""Haruhi Suzumiya"" light novel series. The movie is slow-moving at first, but it really picks up half-way through. The animation, story adaptation, music, and character development are top-notch, and Kyoto Animation obviously put a lot of effort into the making of this film. It seems that this was their ""love letter"" to the fans of the Haruhi Suzumiya series (and, perhaps it can be seen as an ""apology note"" for making many people frustrated over the infamous ""Endless Eight"" episodes). However, if you're a newcomer to the series, it would be best to watch the TV series beforehand (or read the manga or light novels, if you prefer). Unfortunately, this film isn't very accessible to newcomers, and it's almost required that you recall and understand certain events from the series in order to fully enjoy the story. If you're new to the series or if you're a fan who needs a little refresher on the plot, the most important episodes to look over are ""The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya"" (Parts 1 through 6) and ""Bamboo Leaf Rhapsody."" Although a bit slow paced and lacking accessibility to new fans, I thoroughly enjoyed watching this film. {Film Rating: 4.5 out of 5}

Bandai's DVD/Blu-Ray Combo Pack Release:
As for Bandai's release, the voice-acting for the English dub is excellent, and once again, Crispin Freeman's performance as the brooding protagonist, Kyon, steals the spotlight. The picture quality of the Blu-Ray looks great on a big High-Definition Television. There's a fair amount of extras included on an extra DVD disc, although I wish they also included the extras together on the Blu-Ray disc. The packaging feels a bit ""bare-boned""---for one of Bandai's most highly anticipated releases of the year, I wish they put a bit more effort into making the packaging feel a bit more special and attractive. Overall, this is another high-quality release by Bandai, but I wish they put more effort into the packaging to showcase this special movie. {Bandai's Release Rating: 4 out of 5}

BOTTOM LINE:
If you're a fan of the series, save up your pennies and buy this. If you're a newcomer who's interested in getting into the series, go and watch the TV series first. You'll certainly not be disappointed about this purchase.",1316822400,18,2455,4.939467312348668
4673305,4,B005F96UQO,"Let me start this review by stating that I am a loyal fan of the Haruhi Suzumiya series. My first review on Amazon was one of the novels, and I have purchased all the episodes on DVD the day they were released (despite the horror that was the ""Endless Eight""). I say this not to start a contest of ""Who is the biggest fan"" but to let you know where I am coming from.

The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya will be familiar to all fans of the original novels which the anime series is based on. For those who are wondering if it is a faithful adaptation, I would certainly give my nod of approval. I dare say it's better than the book. Now, for those who are wondering if this is a good place for a newcomer to come into the series, I would respond with ""Certainly not."" Little to no character introduction is given, and I think people new to the series would be extremely confused. The Haruhi Suzumiya series is well known for being more than slightly confusing and the film keeps up that tradition with multiple timelines running throughout and references to individual episodes of the series. If you want to watch the film, I HIGHLY advise watching both series one and two first. Not only would you be confused plot wise, you would also be confused at the tone of the series.

This film is, frankly, rather depressing. As a movie that is based on a series called ""The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya "" you would think that would be a given, only the series never came off as melancholy at all. The series was fun and funny throughout (Endless Eight being ignored for the entirety of this review) and while there may be an occasional moment where an episode would turn somber, it would generally not last long.

The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya starts out as the series generally does, but once the plot kicks into gear about twenty minutes in, the viewer is left with a sense of loss, much like Kyon feels throughout. Unlike the series, this feeling will stay with you, because the film is LONG. At 167 minutes (2 hours and 47 minutes or roughly the equivalent of 7 episodes) it provides a thoughtful narrative, and much like Kyon in the film, it wanders around trying to decide what to do next. The use of Satie's Gymnop&eacute;die No. 1 gives even the music a melancholy feel. For a series which is known for it's likeable and very active and charismatic characters, there is a very somber tone to the entire film.

Now, let it be known that despite my comments, I do like this movie. No, like is not strong enough of a word. I love this movie. It takes the characters and presents an interesting ""what if"" situation, and does it in a thoughtful way. There's a certain dignity in how the characters are portrayed. The drama is not sacrificed for cheap laughs, as that would only lessen the struggle Kyon and the others go to. This is an important chapter in the series, and not only does it tell a good story, it deepens the characters and makes them more three dimensional.

Now, about the disk itself. The Blu-Ray is gorgeous. One of the best animated films I've seen on the format in terms of looks. It's just... pretty.

The set also contains another DVD which is the standard definition version film and a special features disk which contains the usual trailers and a few interesting Q&A sessions with the cast.

I would highly suggest any fan of the series pick up the movie, and for those of you who are interested but not fans of the original anime... check out the first two series and see for yourself if it's something you would be interested in.",1316649600,4,3562,4.479198767334361
4673306,3,B005F96UQO,"Let me start off by saying I absolutely love the Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya series. It is up there in the list of my favorite anime. I must also say I quite enjoyed the movie the Dissapearance of Haruhi Suzumiya when I first saw it about a year ago. So why only three stars you may ask? I'll get to that by the end of my review. Any fan of Haruhi knows that her personality is always changing and you just have to take the good, the bad, and the ugly with it and I'll break down my review in the same manner.

The good

Haruhi definitely has her good moments and so does this package. The visuals are stunning on blu ray as you can better appreciate the greater attention to detail the artists took advantage of given a bigger budget and more time to focus their drawing for a movie format versus an anime episode by episode deadline. It's sound counterpart also is no slouch as your ears are taken for a ride with a beautiful soundtrack and the great voice acting we are used to by now done by Aya Hirano and company. The story is fantastic and can probably be enjoyed by anyone even if you haven't seen the series before although I would HIGHLY reccommend that you do at some point if you haven't already.

The bad

Most people just want to have a blu ray version of the movie that they can gawk whenever they want and for them there isn't much to complain about. However if your the kind of person like me who rarely buys movies in the advent of the Netflix age and only does for must have movies or to take advantage of the extra features then you will be disappointed. There is a disc specifically for extra features but its not filled with anything you would actually care about spending time to watch. Perhaps I'm spoiled by the fact that most blu ray packages come with a digital copy to play on your iPod or iPad but for me I find it just lazy not to include it nowadays.

The ugly

The reason why I am giving three stars isn't so much because of a lack of special features or digital copy but more of a question of value. $30 is a lot of money to pay for a blu ray especially when you aren't getting a digital copy. Now as a Haruhi fan even if they put the price at $100 I still would most likely pay for it so it becomes more of a question about value. Let's compare that to an entire first season I was able to buy on DVD a year and a half ago for $50 which is probably more than you could scour the Internet for now. Is a two and a half hour movie monetarily worth more than half of an entire first season even if it is on blu ray? The question is compounded even more when you take into account it's no secret that you can pretty much watch any anime you want for free without having to look too hard.

Conclusion

All complaints aside I have no regrets buying this movie regardless of value but I am in the camp that absolutely loves Haruhi. If your in this camp then you will probably feel the same way. If your just a passing fan then you will have to ask yourself if having just the movie for $30 is really worth it.",1316649600,7,3037,4.1096121416526135
4673307,5,B005F96UQO,"The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya is an integral part of the Haruhi-engine. If you've read the light novels, fear not, Disappearance lives up to its source material. If you've watched the anime, then Disappearance is required material. If there's anything Disappearance does in regards to the anime however, it redeems the idea of watching the anime in chronological order. To give a little background, season one of The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya was intentionally broadcasted out of order, presumably because the the Melancholy story arc really represents why people enjoy Haruhi so much. The rest of the episodes lack the same punch of Melancholy and if you were to watch seasons one and two, not in broadcast order, but in an order relative to the timeline of the show, then the anime ends on a pretty lackluster note. Disappearance however takes place after seasons one and two of the anime and it packs a punch that rivals the Melancholy arc. Do you need to watch the anime to understand the movie? It would certainly help as the movie itself is one big reference to what happens in the anime.

The BD/DVD combo pack delivers though I was expecting some more out of the extras (for example, the behind-the-scenes look at the making of Disappearance's soundtrack wasn't as long or as in-depth as one would like it to be). The Japanese cast is phenomenal and if you're a fan of English cast like I am, then you will not be disappointed at all. Crispin Freeman in particular, returns once again as Kyon and delivers a satisfying performance. This movie is one that must not be missed by Haruhi fans.",1316476800,,1608,4.784172661870503
4673308,5,B005F96UQO,"This movie was 100% worth the price.  I have the two previous series, and while not needed, they do help in understanding the background of the characters and some of their motivations.  Helpfully, there is a lot of expository dialog woven into the the narrative.  Kyon, the main character, switches between internal narration and external talking with other characters.  Taking the viewer along in both action, and motivation.

This movie flows! Throughout the entire 164 mins (yes it is that long, get comfy), I was engaged and focused, either on the characters, the beautiful backgrounds or the plot potentials. The scenery and animation are fantastic.  It is gorgeous in 1080p for the blueray version.  The plot moves along nicely and ties the characters thoughts and actions together and nothing seems out of place or forced.

The only thing that I thought was out of place in the movie, I didn't like the english speaking voice actress for Haruhi's character. It didn't seem to match the older sounding voice of the two previous series'.  It is a minor point though and certainly nothing that takes away from the movie as a whole.

If you are a fan of the series buy it.  It is worth it.  If you are not already familiar with the series it may be a little hard to get into, but it is easy to pick up and the plot is one that keeps you guessing...",1316476800,,1352,4.610878661087866

For fans of the series, this is a no-brainer: Buy this movie!

If you thought Season 2 and the Endless Eight were a mess, and you're wondering if this is redemption for that, let me tell you... IT IS!! This film is leagues above and beyond both the first and second season. This movie was not made to profit from a cheap buck, not fluffy or superficial in any way. One can tell the animators and writers put their all into it. All you get here is a meaty story.

For newcomers looking to see what the hype is about, you may certainly want to invest in season 1 and 2 of the series since the movie has references to past events. It might be stretching it to say that it can be seen as a stand alone film. So I recommend getting up to speed to take in the full effect of this marvelous film.

The art and animation are both gorgeous on bluray 1080p, and the audio is high quality whether you watch it in Japanese or English. The story and plot both run deep and keep you thinking straight through the night! (I couldn't sleep for a while).

All in all, fan of anime or not, this movie really does break ground and surpasses Japanese animation theatrical releases.

8469763,5,B005F96UQO,"I love this movie, absolutely 100% worth the $50 I spent on it. The packaging was perfect and it was still factory sealed just as described, I would pick it up before it gets more then $70 though (if it's not already) because that's alot of $ for a 2 and a half hour movie

Worth it if you're a fan of the series.",1418601600,,313,3.890625

8469765,5,B005F96UQO,"Best Christmas movie ever!  Well... that's open to debate. 'The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya' has come to be my favourite holidays movie of the Winter season. I know, I know 'Tokyo Godfathers' is considered the standard for anime Christmas movies. HOWEVER, ' the Disappearance of Haruhi  Suzumiya' can stand on it's own and, not in the shadow of  'Tokyo Godfathers.' What I am about to say, is fighting words to a lot of people: 'The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya' deals with the same themes as 'It's a Wonderful Life' and, 'The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya' over shadows 'It's a Wonderful Life' in every way. One last thing. GET THIS DVD BACK INTO PRODUCTION! And, start offering this movie for streaming Amazon.com, Hulu, and Netflex!",1415836800,,747,5.008064516129032
