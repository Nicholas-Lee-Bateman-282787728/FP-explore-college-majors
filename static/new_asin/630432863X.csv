7867818,5,630432863X,My sixteen year old had the priviledge of watching the Gullah Gullah episodes.  I regret that I never purchased the videos 11 years ago when they were plentiful. Now for some reason the videos are no longer being produced.  I've looked high and low for the past 2-3 yrs and happened along two episodes on Amazon.  The video was in mint condition and my 5yr old loves it and watches it over and over again.  I received both videos when I was told i would. I will order again from the vendor and Amazon.  I also was given return info if I was not satisfied.,1237766400,,555,4.247619047619048
