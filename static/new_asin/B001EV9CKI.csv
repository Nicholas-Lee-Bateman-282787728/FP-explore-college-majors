8299581,1,B001EV9CKI,"Perhaps studying with Julie Lieberman during live lessons could result in positive free singing, but this DVD has students do strange tongue and lip tensing exercises that can instill horrible habits for a singer not taking regular lessons. I can understand Julie's desire to teach students awareness of their tongue and lips, but my impression is that she encourages extra work and tension from these muscles to create a 'better sound.' The DVD isn't really about vocal aerobics so much as bizarre physical tweaks. One particular example is her asking students to train themselves to shape their tongue like a canoe. The last 1/3rd of the DVD talks about vocal health, so again, not really related to the title. I'm thankful that I inherited this DVD and did not purchase it.",1488672000,,776,4.931297709923665
