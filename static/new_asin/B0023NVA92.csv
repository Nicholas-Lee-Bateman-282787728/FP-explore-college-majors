3841858,1,B0023NVA92,Well I cannot rate what I cannot see...apparently these dvds that I purchased are not compatible with US dvd players. So they won't even play. I have been trying to return it for sometime now and and I keep getting the run around on the return label that they are supposed to be responible for. On the other hand...they were very prompt on delivery.,1379808000,2,349,4.46875
3841859,5,B0023NVA92,"Well first off let me say I a huge fan of the show and was excited when I got home from work today and found my order in mailbox!. opened product was new still in original sealed packaging the case that holds the collection was damaged around edges probably just rough shipping open it up throw the disk in and BAM! get a message on screen please eject disk not for play in this region? so I'm like WTF did a little research and found out that I recived a region 2 (pal 2) set of dvd that won't play in either of my blu ray players now when I ordered this it said region 1 US and Canada only, well come to find out I will need a multi formatted player to use these dvds ! which I really don't want to buy so I guess my next thing to do is contact the seller and amazon and try to get this issue resolved, which I'm sure amazon will do never had any problems with amazon except once and was totally satisfied with they response and refund ect. So I guess on Monday I'll be repacking it up and returning, could of been my fault not reading details correctly or could of been the sellers just shipped wrong item things happen so movie mars & amazon lets get this fixed asap! Update 052413 !! excellent problem fixed got all region player  works great thanks",1368316800,7,1254,4.118367346938776

8349790,1,B0023NVA92,The description said it was US region and it wasn't so it won't play in any of my devices. Money absolutely wasted. Ill never buy another dvd or bluray from amazon.,1466812800,5,164,4.32258064516129
8349791,1,B0023NVA92,I tossed these in a drawer when I received them 6 weeks ago.  Tried to play them yesterday and can't play a single disk -- get a message saying I can't play them -- MovieMars didn't explain that to me when I purchased them.  Am extremely disappointed and will never buy anything else from them.,1463788800,8,294,4.327272727272727
8349792,1,B0023NVA92,Not a single one of the DVDs worked. Every one of them had an error reading when attempted to be played. Company has failed to respond to my email. Very unhappy with this company. Only reason I have the one star is because it wouldn't let me submit with zero.,1461369600,7,259,4.2
8349793,1,B0023NVA92,"You need a special DVD player for these. Will not work otherwise. I gave them to my sister. They can watch them on their computer which allows them to enter a Region Code. There are special dvd players you can buy to receive the dvds, but then you might as well buy the new ones that will play on your regular dvd.",1441411200,3,314,4.080645161290323
