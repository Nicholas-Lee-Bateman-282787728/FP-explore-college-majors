7878478,4,6304872518,"Doctor Who altered its course with The War Machines. Rather than travelling to a distant planet to meet strange-looking aliens, or to Earth's past to encounter a significant historical figure, War Machines is set in comtemporary London, the swinging mid-60s, and it shows!  For the very first time in the series' young history, the Doctor and his companion(s) face a modern-day threat, the first time, that is, when they are large enough to interact with the rest of the characters, unlike Planet of The Giants.

As Professor Brett states, WOTAN is ten years ahead of its time. Well, maybe not ten. Perhaps only five years, which would put it smack down in the beginning of the Pertwee Years, right next to a simlar story, Mind of Evil, about a machine taking over people's minds. If anything, The War Machines foreshadows the Third Doctor's era.  Hartnell dabbles with electronic gadgets, works with the military (not UNIT yet, but very UNIT-like), and endures incompetent politicians to prevent a menace from taking over the world.  Sound familiar?  The Pertwee Years four years early.  In fact, if you re-hash this script and use it toward another popular 60s TV program, The Avengers, it would feel right at home.  I anticipated John Steed and Emma Peel to show up on my TV screen at any minute.

Incidentally, the notion expressed that Doctor Who finally has taken its intended form with The War Machines is about as bogus the Doctor's background being changed during the McCoy years to be something more than a timelord.  The intended course in any series is how it originates, not how it becomes.  The originators of any series always deserve the ""intended course"" label.  This is not to say that the new direction of the show is bad, but let's not claim that this is where Sidney Newman & Verity Lambert envisioned Doctor Who going.

Basically, The War Machines steers Doctor Who in a new direction, a very subtle foreboding of the early 70s, worth every one of the four stars I gave it. However this story could have been a five-star beauty. How you ask? Where have you gone Ian & Barbara.  The Doctor may as well have been companion-less.  Dodo barely features at all, disappearing somewhere in episode two, never to be seen again. We are given the revelation at the end that she has decided to stay in London, and bids the Doctor goodbye by relaying a message through the new companions, Ben & Polly. As the Doctor says, that's gratitude for you, not even showing the decency to see the Doctor off personally after being given the experience of her life.  Dodo should have gotten a more substantial exit.  As for the aforementioned new companions, Ben & Polly fit in with the swinging 60s era, and Polly is pleasing to the eye, however they are no Ian & Barbara.  In retrospect, War Machines could have been the perfect swan song for Ian & Barbara.  I can just see them telling the Doctor that ""we have decided to remain here"" at the end of this story, fate having steered the Tardis back in their own time finally.  An opportunity sadly lost...",1186099200,2,3056,4.699812382739212
7878479,4,6304872518,"This story is one of many examples of an intelligent concept being utilized in a very exceptional way in the Doctor Who format.  This adventure has the good Doctor and Dodo arriving in London of 1966, and soon they would become involved in a very insidious plot put forth WOTAN, the very first example of a thinking computer, otherwise known as A.I., artificial intelligence, and the subsequent construction of an army of robots known as War Machines.
This adventure is something that I believed may have had a hand in influencing the Terminator movies, for in both cases, there is the talk of a super artificial intelligent computer system that has come to the realization that mankind's time is up, and the age of the machines must begin.
However, there is are differences, in the Terminator, the fact that once SkyNet was brought online, it launched nukes that practically destroyed half the world's population and brought about a dismal, dystopia, where there is nothing but wars and fighting, between the human resistance, and the robotic warriors of SkyNet.
In this adventure, the events build up slowly, first learning that WOTAN is a highly advanced computerized problem solver that was envisioned to assist humanity in it's global progress.  But as it is connected, in a gothic sort of manner in various thrillers, as the menace is not quite made apparent, but slowly builds up as people of significant importance are brought under WOTAN's control, as more and more people are brought under its control, more of the War Machines are constructed and brought online.
This adventure is also notable for the somewhat abrupt departure of Dodo, and the introduction of two new companions for the good Doctor, Polly and Ben.  In addition, there are some rather humorous scenes having the Doctor and his friends in the hottest nightclub in the area, 'The Inferno', as a display of the youthful exuberance of the Swinging Sixties.
In addition, what I thought was great was for the Doctor to be working alongside the military, lending his intelligence to their militaristic strategies, something that served as the first prototype story format that would be utilized during a majority of the 3rd Doctor era.  I found this adventure to be very satisfying on an intellectual level, for it serves as an allegorical warning to not allow technology to dominate mankind.  A must have for any Dr. Who fan.",1043452800,7,2397,4.95273631840796
7878480,4,6304872518,"Plenty of outdoor scenes instead of cardboard sets. Inept government officials, military men with assault rifles, the Doctor tampering with electronics, present-day London in danger. With this story Doctor Who entered a new age. Although starring Hartnell, it is much more like Throughton or early Pertwee. I prefer this style to the less mature, if likeable, stories with Susan, Ian, Barbara & co.
  Sure, War Machines has it's silly and naive moments, but that applies to almost every Doctor Who story. It is scientifically less ridicilous than The Tenth Planet. The machines themselves are like much more crude and clumsy Daleks, but i like them. People who like swinging London-stuff like Adam Adamant could enjoy this. Also those who prefer later doctors to Hartnell might find War Machines a positive surprise. I did, this is my favorite first doctor story.",1040428800,2,863,5.1571428571428575
7878481,3,6304872518,"This episode of Doctor Who isn't that great.  Basically, you have a super computer who has a bunch of killer robots (the ""War Machines"") and it wants to take over the earth.  Blah, blah, blah.
What made this episode interesting to me was the then almost unknown concept of networking computers.  The idea for the super computer villian was that it had other computers that all linked to it and each other.  The result made the super computer smarter.  While that was laughable, today we do have corporate networks that span the globe and enable people to do more than ever.
Bottom line, a mostly dull episode with an close prediction of the future of computing in the 1960's.  That part makes it worth having (IMO).",1027382400,,715,4.634920634920635
7878482,4,6304872518,"This story is built on the proposition that computers networked together will have a much gretaer capacity. Having a super computer, in this case WOTAN, at the heart of the network allows for the subjugation of mankind by computer. These days we could liken that to the internet.
As others have pointed out this is a thought provoking drama on the dangers of the over-reliance on cold calculationg computers. Recent movies such as Bicentennial Man and AI have sought to couter much of this type of propaganda which is still prevelant throughout the world. Once again, the good old BBC has brought a thorny scientific issue to the fore in the guise of a children's television show.
This is one of the most fab, with it, hip of the shows which was originally broadcast between June 25 to July 16 1966. Polly's fashionable dress and make-up together with the symbols of the swinging 60s, the Post Office Tower, the mini, among others are the touchstones of the new generation that was emerging. This was the year of the Beatles being awarded the MBE by the queen and once again the BBC pays lip service to social developments while helping the British tourist industry with their pictures of London. If you have an attractive outdoor location use it I say!
It's not the best of Doctor Who stories monster wise as others have said but it was a pretty novel idea at the time which certainly is one of the most endearing features of Doctor Who. The scary thing about the mobiles is that their construction was relatively simple and thus could be replicated quickly and easily. An enemy that could grow as fast as you can say 'production line' is scary indeed.",1025568000,3,1653,4.664383561643835
7878483,3,6304872518,"The War Machines was one many Doctor Who stories of the 1960's that was orginaly chucked by the BBC. However this story was found and restored by the unsung Doctor Who Restoration Team. War Machines is not a great story but neverless it's very thought provoking.
The Doctor lands in London June 25, 1966 in the shadows of newly finished Post Office Tower, the Doctor senses something strange in the tower. The Doctor along with his companion Dodo, find out that in a suite high above is a super computer called WOTAN, who is able to think, and does not make mistakes, WOTAN know's what TARDIS stands for. WOTAN is about to be connected to a worldwide computer network, and that could be dangerous. WOTAN has come to the conclustion that man can't progress any longer and must be a servent of the machines. WOTAN takes control of minds of Professor Breet(who invented WOTAN), his assitant Krimpton, and Dodo. Dodo is instucted to bring the Doctor to the tower so that WOTAN can use the Doctor's knowlege in it's atempt to take over the world. The Doctor does eventualy figures out that Dodo is not herself and breaks WOTAN's control by putting her in a deep sleep, and that's when we see that last of her. Ben Jackson one of the Doctor's new companions soon finds out that a War Machine in a abandoned warehouse nearby a well know fruit and vegetable garden is being built and it will be sent to distroy the city. Ben barely escapes and warns Sir Charles and the Doctor. The Doctor soon know that WOTAN is a treat, and must figure out how to pull the plug.
Again, The War Machines is not one the best Doctor Who stories. But it's a thinking story, rather than a action story. With computer runing our lives in the 1990's, The War Machines was present is a warning to the Whovans of the 1960's. If computers get to smart, they made by runing our lives. For the most part they are. People have been downsized by computer technology, their is fear that computer will be tracking them anyway they go etc. In my opinion War Machines was intended to be a warning about how computers could take over world, and that's why this Doctor Who story that had to be restored. I don't think it was no accident that the ""War Machines"" was recently found.",926899200,,2237,4.485294117647059
7878484,3,6304872518,"This re-release of 'The War Machines' was restored by the Doctor Who  Restoration Team.  The story itself is not the greatest and William  Hartnell's acting is sub-par.  With that said, the remastered video has a  clear and crisp picture.  The preview segment is a nice addition, adding an  additional preview of the War Machines.  This story sees Ben and Polly join  the Doctor.  END",908409600,,384,4.859375
