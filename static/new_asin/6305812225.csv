She is the most underated actress of our generation.  Maybe she would have done more if not for her personal life which is an amazing cinderella story, living happily ever after with her prince and their children.  It is good she is working again now.  I was suprized to find reviews of this film not even mention her because she is so great in this film.  The others are all right but they have not stood the test of time like Kelly deffinately has.  ...",1041897600,7,596,4.276785714285714
1079608,5,6305812225,"I was just graduating college when Secret Admirer came out in the mid 80's.  But over 15 years later, it is one of the few 80's teen movies I still enjoy watching over and over again.  There really isn't anything new in this movie that hasn't been covered in other movies and the final outcome is pretty predictable, but the cast is a good one.  C. Thomas Howell, Kelly Preston (Holy Smokes!) and the absolutely adorable Lori Loughlin work extremely well together with the unrequited love portion of the story and the adult cast (in particular Fred Ward in a hilarious performance) also all have their moments.  You even see Corey Haim (""Lucas"") before he hit fame and later became a hilarious ""True Hollywood Story"".
Glad to see that this is coming to DVD.  I hope it has a commentary track with some of the stars of the flick because it would be interesting to see what they think of the movie so many years later.",1041206400,30,916,4.493975903614458
1079609,5,6305812225,"What do you get when you put C. Thomas Howell, Lori Loughlin,& Corey Haim in a movie together? You get a quintessential '80s movie! It's cute, funny & enjoyable to watch. It may not have ranked up there with ""16 Candles"" & ""Breakfast Club"", but it holds it's own and has it's own brand of charm. The plot is your basic boy wants girl, girl doesn't want boy, but girlfriend wants boy, but he doesn't know she is alive type of plot. To add to this, a series of love letters seem to get into the wrong hands which triggers a series of misunderstandings. All and all it makes for an entertaining hour & forty minutes of pure '80s nostalgia.",1031616000,3,636,4.308333333333334

1079611,5,6305812225,Secret Admirer is the best movie i have ever seen. It is very good. C Thomas Howell stars in it and he is a fabulous actor. He is gr8t! I love him! His best friend is in love with him and he doesn't even know it. She writes him a love letter on the last dat of school and puts it in his locker. he thinks this other girl wrote it to him who is has a crish on. he writes that girl debbie a letter and gives it to his best friend to give to her for him but he doesn't sign the letter. she reads it before she gives it to her and its a good thing she does because it stinks. she writes a better letter and dbbie falls in love with them all. but in the mean time debbie's and Michael's (C Thomas Howell) parenst find htese letters and think they are for them to find out what happens please buy this movie and watch it... it's gr8t! hope u love it as much as i do...,1028678400,2,862,3.7679558011049723
1079612,4,6305812225,"Someone said it right that the '80s teen flicks had an energy and positive outlook that seems lacking in many of today's teen movies. There is so much cynicism and joking about the '80s nowadays, but I'm glad I was an '80s teen. I only saw this movie two years ago, but I was a Kelly Preston fan long before that, and I also remembered sweet Lori Loughlin from Full House. And Thomas Howell was at his best in these kind of movies, rather than the B-movie sleaze he now seems typecast for. I recommend watching this back to back with A Tiger's Tale, another '80s movie that pairs Preston and Howell and throws in hot mama Ann-Margret for good measure. The yummy mommy in this one is Leigh Taylor-Young.",1027641600,2,702,4.407692307692308

1079614,5,6305812225,"Yes. Its a trully great loveable teen movie from the 80s. The best in the movie are following ,not necesserelly on this order:
-Lori Laughlin-in my oppinion shes the most sweet and loveable actress in a movies like that. Unforgettable. Its gonna stay in my memmorie forever and ever.the sweetness on her face and acting way is very welcomed in a time  like this:cold and filled with uncertainty.
-The jann hammer sacore:I didn't know that was the name of the score composer but I always loved it and every time i go to USA i look for it  hopefull for find the cd but i never suceeded. Im still looking for it like someone who is looking for a reason to fall in love again or better for an inspiration. MY first true love I watched this movie in an afternoon tv exhibition.
-the sexy kelly preston-shes really nice but  doesnt even get closer to what Lori is in the movie.
I guess I should stop know since im getting to prsonal in this review. I want to say sorry for any mistake. I wrote it quickly and my first language is portuguese(im  from Brasil)...Thank u very much for reading this...

1079615,4,6305812225,"This movie is great, plain and simple.  As you watch the love letter change hands from person to person and things unravel for everyone, you don't see HOW things are going to end up sane, but it all works well.  Definitely worth watching.  The only downside I guess is this: only in a  movie could your best friend be someone as beautiful and sweet as Lori  Laughlin and you STILL be looking around for someone.  In real life, it  doesn't happen that way, my friend.  I mean, yes, Kelly Preston is  gorgeous, but still...",955584000,12,521,4.457446808510638

1079778,4,6305812225,"For the record, before I start, I must insist that despite what some of the other reviewers on here have said, this is NOT A FAMILY FILM. It's rated R for a reason. There is stuff that is inappropriate for younger viewers.

'Secret Admirer' was a movie I discovered in the late 80's to early 90's on Cable TV. One of those late night summer deals. I wasn't expecting much but came away liking the film quite a bit. It was well made, had a great young cast (C. Thomas Howell, Lori Loughlin, Kelly Preston, Corey Haim, Casey Seizmaszko, Courtney Gains) and a great script and even an awesome 80's theme song (look up ""No Secrets"" by Van Stephenson on Youtube it's actually pretty good). I remember recording the movie on VHS and re-watching it several times before finally recording over it and not seeing it for two and a half decades. A few weeks ago I stumbled across this flick, yet again, on Cable and gave it a go again and I was pleasantly surprised that, despite the fact that I've not been a teenager for nearly twenty years, I still found the movie entertaining. It holds up remarkably well for its age and is something that I liked as much today as I did then.

I won't get into the plot because if you're reading this then you've probably got a decent idea of what the film is about. What I will say though is, as 80's teen movies go, this is one of the best of the decade (it's no 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High', 'Sixteen Candles', 'Breakfast Club', or 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off', but it's as good as some of the more well regarded teen comedies of the time like 'Valley Girl', 'Pretty in Pink', 'Some Kind of Wonderful', and 'Class'). If you haven't seen it then I highly recommend giving it a watch.",1464307200,,1712,4.380503144654088

1079822,5,6305812225,"The movie:
Secret Admirer is the story of teenager Michael Ryan, who receives a passionate anonymous love letter on the last day of school. As another letter is written, all the letters fall into the wrong hands, causing confusion with almost everyone in Michael's life, until finally he discovers who wrote him the love letter. Kelly Preston shines in this movie as do a few others in the film. It's a simple story that has drama, love, laughs and plenty of onscreen chemistry.

The bluray:
The atmosphere shines for that era and skin detail looks amazing. The colors look fabulous and really make each scene pop. The audio is more than adeequate considering its not a scifi or action type movie. Its loud enough to hear each word clearly while still having plenty of realistic background noise.

1079880,4,6305812225,"In this era of text messaging and e-mails, a movie about a letter seems quaint.  Charmingly so.  And a letter from a secret admirer that sets off a chain-mail reaction amongst teens and adults in one Southern California neighborhood sets the tone for a feel-good flick.

Seeing it again in a time when letter writing is a lost art underscores how romance can also seem out of reach in a highly technological age.

Kelly Preston totally inhabits the role of self-absorbed teen Deborah Anne, while Lori Loughlin very effectively portrays the girl next door.  C. Thomas Howell made me laugh as he bumbled along, chasing after the beautiful Deborah Anne, when his heart really belongs to his best friend.

Dang, he had some hairy armpits, but so do I. And there, you go. Secret Admirer is a pretty enjoyable movie.

Okay, if you've seen the VHS cover, or early DVD release, you know it's a dead give-a-way as to who wrote the 'letter' to Michael (Howell). This movie showcases three big stars, C. Thomas Howell, Kelly Preston and Lori Loughlin, (pre-Full House, Lori). Michael is best friends w Toni, but he's really in love with Debbie. Someone writes Michael a 'secret admirer' letter, and somehow it gets passed along to the 'adults' or 'parents' of Michael and Debbie. This is not meant to be serious, but for sure, it's a love triangle. It's one of those movies both the girls and guys can enjoy and get a kick out of it, but be prepared for language, it's an 80s movie.
A note for the guys who watch this movie, (I'm a dude), yes, both girls are great to look at and both of them seem to get equal time on the screen, but Lori is the one that steals the show. She's great as part of the cast as Full House, but if you actually watched this movie as a teen, or youngster, you probably might have had a serious crush on her. Not only that, but she's great at acting! She really can pull off the 'I'm so mad at you' face.
This movie probably was shoved under the bus next to movies like The Breakfast Club, Sixteen Candles and Back To The Future, but very worth the watch in the best of 1985.
PS Watch for J.J. Cohen and Casey Sizmeckio as two members of Michael's pals. They're almost unrecognizable w/o their 50s clothes on from Back To The Future as Biff's henchman.",1521763200,,1641,4.19620253164557
