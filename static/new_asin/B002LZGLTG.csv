8373365,3,B002LZGLTG,I love Kylie and it's always fun to see a new dvd. I mostly enjoy seeing her new costumes and sets and while this was not my favorite concert it was ok. I bought my dvd from a 3rd party seller on Amazon who is based in the USA but my copy was made in Spain and the menu titles are all in Spanish. There's not way for me to know if the video quality is as good or worse than the USA edition but it wasn't as good as my other Kylie dvds.,1390521600,,435,3.6382978723404253
8373366,3,B002LZGLTG,"South American version of the disc, most of it was very good quality. unfortunately on the last two tracks the audio is out of sync. same problem shows up on four different players.

the performance content is great though, a really good concert & extras.",1328140800,,255,4.666666666666667
8373367,4,B002LZGLTG,"The listing for this DVD is slightly misleading...

It says this is region coded for US & Canada, with subtitles in Spanish...

In fact, this DVD is printed in Spanish... the back cover is printed in Spanish... the DVD menus are printed in Spanish...

Of course, it's the regular concert (Kylie doesn't SING in Spanish!!) but if you're looking for a true North American release, this isn't it...

It did play just fine in my US DVD player... some of the backdrop videos are pixelated, though...",1259625600,3,494,4.709302325581396
8373368,5,B002LZGLTG,"I saw Kylie Minogue USA For You For Me tour in NYC, 2009. It's a little different compared with this 2008 X tour DVD.
This DVD is wonderful as Kylie, and I can't believe that it has better quality than the BD version.(I am kind of disappointed on this concert on BD)
But finally, this DVD is region free in USA which mean I could play on my PS3. YA, I am so excited about this.
And hopefully, they will record USA tour and release on DVD in the future.",1257465600,,452,4.033333333333333
