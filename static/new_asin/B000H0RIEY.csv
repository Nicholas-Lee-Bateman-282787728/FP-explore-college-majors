8135782,5,B000H0RIEY,I used this video in an 8th grade American History class years ago. It is excellent. The acting is excellent in every way. Everyone should view this to grasp a little of what it was like for the Father of Our Country. Superb.,1478908800,,225,4.255813953488372

8135784,4,B000H0RIEY,"I watched part of the filming of this movie in Colonial Williamsburg
and was impressed when it was shown on TV. However, since that
time the production company has made available only volume 2. When
I called the company about this discrepancy, I was informed that they
had no plans to reproduce volume 1. And they have not done so. I
don't understand why such a policy exists where half of the film (and
the story) was deleted from the public offering of it. Very disappointing.
