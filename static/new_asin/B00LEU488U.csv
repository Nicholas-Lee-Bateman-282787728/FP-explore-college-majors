8665440,1,B00LEU488U,"This is absolutely one of the worst transfers to DVD i've seen. Overly-sharpened & with artifacts galore, it appears to have been taken from an inferior print on digital source. The color is usually murky & muddy. A great film, & i hope some company does a better transfer. I returned this to the seller, but it cost me $7 for the shipping altogether. I've seen a full screen bootleg from a television capture that had better color & contrast than this edition.",1463616000,4,461,4.566265060240964
8665441,4,B00LEU488U,"During the 1916 Mexican revolution, an American mercenary (Robert Mitchum) helps one of the revolutionary leaders (Gilbert Roland) into hijacking guns from a gun runner (Zachary Scott) selling guns to the Federales. This is an above average western with a terrific look to it courtesy of Ernest Laszlo's (JUDGMENT AT NUREMBURG) CinemaScope cinematography. Shot in and around the Acapulco area of Mexico, the film has a vibrant, lush tropical look to it. Mitchum (who was an executive producer on the movie) is perfectly cast the adventurer who doesn't really care about the revolution except how he can make some money out of it. It's quick paced and provides lots of action and the script by Earl Felton (THE NARROW MARGIN) is smart. The film avoids any overt romance with the film's leading lady Ursula Thiess as Scott's wife, just a suggestion of an attraction that may blossom into something else. Directed by Richard Fleischer (SOYLENT GREEN) with an energetic underscore by Max Steiner. With Henry Brandon and Rodolfo Acosta.

The Italian DVD courtesy of A&R productions is a nice anamorphic transfer in its original CinemaScope ratio of 2.35.",1412035200,2,1149,5.111702127659575
