1112855,5,7502596496,"Warm, full of sensibility, a great movie for all audiences. Do not miss it!",1109635200,2,75,4.428571428571429
1112856,5,7502596496,"Many people with failed careers often turn to education as a refuge where they still can be a part of what they love the most.  These refugees usually do not have any idea of what they are about to do to themselves, as they are about to face young people who believe they know everything or lack the enthusiasm that they possess.  Often it turns out to be a wake-up call that the previous job was not that bad after all, despite previous failures.  Some of these refugees turn out to be excellent educators while others fail again.  In Les Choristes, known as the Chorus here in United States, the audience is introduced to one of these refugees that is about to embark on a rough voyage, as he has taken a job as supervisor in a boarding school for troubled children.

Christophe Barratier who directs Les Choristes has previously produced excellent films such as Himalaya (1999) and Winged Migration (2001).  The story that Barratier tells opens in New York where a man is half in slumber on a couch when someone awakens him in order to inform him that there is an emergency phone call for him.  It appears that the man's mother has just passed away, which leads him to return to home.  When the man arrives home the audience can deduct through the mise-en-scene that the man is the best conductor in the world.  After the funeral a strange man knocks on the door to ask the conductor if he recognizes him while he has a gift for him from an old teacher.  The gift is a journal in regards to what happened in the year of 1949 at the Fond de l'Etang boarding school.

The journal was a gift from his old teacher, Clement Mathieu (Gerard Jugnot), which brings the viewers back to the year of 1949.  Through this flashback the audience is introduced to the school, the students, the teachers, and the headmaster Rachin while the story begins to take form.  The school is designed to help troubled youth to get on right track before it is too late.  This means that many of the students at Fond de l'Etang are up to no good whenever they get a chance.

Rachin runs the school with an iron fist with the motto: ""action - reaction"", as he has lost all hope in the children's ability and only sees the imperfections of the children.  Mathieu arrives quickly understands the psychology of Rachin, as he is forced to punish a student upon his arrival despite the student being innocent to his knowledge.  The road to gain the students' trust is a long and difficult road, and more so to get them to follow the rules that he tries to set up.  However, through compassion, self-irony, and a touch of humor Mathieu begins to get their attention.

Quickly Mathieu adjusts to the school environment, as he commences a tryout for a choir.  Through the choir he gets the students to cooperate and build a meaningful sense of belonging.  The educational methods that Mathieu uses win the students over, as they begin to do actual work while showing some progress.  Unfortunately, Rachin sees the music as another way for the students to express themselves negatively and dishonorably.  Rachin does not credit Mathieu for the students' progress through the music, as he tells him to stop the choir immediately.  Despite the order from Rachin the students go underground much like the French Resistance during World War II in order to continue their music lessons.  Through these lessons Mathieu builds strong bonds with the students, as he wins their trust while teaching them the wisdom of music.

The theme of Les Choristes is not unique, which can be seen in films such as Dead Poet's Society (1989), Dangerous Minds (1995), Mr. Holland's Opus (1995), and Evil (2003).  These stories are also regarding teachers in school settings that change students' lives in some profound way.  Another film that comes to mind is Cinema Paradiso (1989) that depicts an older man returning home to bury the man who changed his life.  Les Choristes is a blend between these two themes.

Barratier's storytelling elusively ushers the audience into a terrific cinematic experience.  The technical aspects of filmmaking are reliable and shine in the moments when it is necessary to elevate a mood and a feeling.  The theme, which has been used before, still is powerful, as it is an essential tool for expressing gratitude to those who educate the youth of the world.  In the end, Les Choristes offers a truly joyful experience, as it displays that there is hope everywhere if one only tries to see it.",1109116800,121,4471,4.669220945083014
1112857,4,7502596496,"I saw Les Choristes while in France and fell in love. This film is a lovely story for the whole family. The plot may be simple, but the message will always be significant. The story is reminiscent of ""Dead Poets' Society,"" but stands on its own and has amazing music as an added perk. Not only does French sound good as a language, but it also sounds great in music. The sweet boys choir that sings is outstanding and the soloist's voice is angelic. Don't miss out. This is an excellent film.",1108857600,26,492,4.358695652173913

1112953,5,7502596496,"Here is a film from France, that has the right place with 2 Academy awards nominations in 2004 and the equivalent of other boarding school movies for boys such as Robert Donat staring in ""Goodbye Mr. Chip"" (1939), Robin Williams staring in ""Dead Poets Society"" (1995), Kevin Kline in ""The Emperor's Club"" (1988), and Richard Dreyfuss in ""Mr. Holland's Opus"" (1995).  The French language was spoken with clarity and not distracting
from the English captions.  This movie is based on true story events.  It is the immediate post-World War II years when Clement Mathieu accepted the challenge to teach troubled boys of whom several had been traumatized by wartime disasters and losses in the family.  Mathieu used music to
enable the boys to learn, harmonize and relate to one another that changed their youthful lives.  It is a deeply moving production with several heart-rending moments complimented by a Teacher's unconventional teaching methods and passion.  Indeed music can soothe the savage beast, and
troubled boys overcame harsh discipline, a depressing atmosphere by an experienced music teacher to proved the arts can help.  This movie is brilliant and worth the 5-star rating.",1477440000,8,1185,5.205263157894737

There are many teacher stories out there like this one, but it was another good one and the music was really good.  The music is a capella most of the time and is a boys' choir, not modern rock music.

1112974,5,7502596496,"""Les Choristes"" (English captions) is one of those movies you never forget. I was shocked to discover last night that I have never written a review of this heart-warming, Oscar-nominated classic from 2004. My reviews are on JayFlix.net.

Directed by Christophe Barratier (""Paris 36""), who is a fearless director of children: he sets this in a home for incorrigible boys.

Part of his huge cast:
  * Grard Jugnot (""Fashion Victim"") is Clment Mathieu, a frustrated would-be musician, an unemployed jack-of-all-trades, who is going to try his hand at being a proctor at a boys' school. The boys call him ""Chrome Dome."" Look at the trailer, you'll see why.
  * Franois Berland (""Transporter"" franchise) Rachin is the deeply unhappy headmaster. He is cruel, selfish, and uncaring.
  * Kad Merad (""Nicholas on Holiday"") Chabert has been the coach for awhile, but he does look out for the boys.
  * Jean-Paul Bonnaire (""A Buttefly Kiss"") La Pre Maxence is the gardener, janitor and is the guy who replaces all those broken windows.
  * Jean-Baptiste Maunier (""L'auberge rouge"") Pierre Morhange sings like an angel, but no one suspects it because he is so busy misbehaving.
  * Maxence Perrin (""Paris 36"") Ppinot is beyond a doubt the most adorable little boy in captivity! But Ppinot's father is coming to get him on Saturday. Ppinot is the boy with the metronome in the trailer.

Because I hadn't reviewed this treasure, I was FORCED to re-watch it last night. I fell in love all over again. It has armloads of people to root for, a truly hiss-worthy villain, goose-bumpy scenes, beautiful music and lots of humor...all squeezed into a 97-minute, PG-13 joy.

See this one!",1468886400,5,1666,4.938848920863309

Mathieu believes in the goodness of these boys and wants to lift them with love rather than beat them down with the fist, and he slowly begins to change them through his kindness and music.

1113152,4,7502596496,"I was first introduced to Les Choristes in my eighth grade French class. I, an uncultured teenager, groaned at the mention of another subtitled movie. Spending the last period before lunch deciphering a poorly staged foreign film was not an idea I relished. Much to my dismay, the scene set on two elderly men reminiscing about their childhood. Fast forward 35 minutes for me and 50 years into the past of the old men, and I was in love with the romantically hopeless setting and the captivating soundtrack. Les Choristes had proven itself to be a heartwarming (though admittedly unoriginal) film that portrays renewed hope amongst corruption.
The film prefaces at a desolate climate at a troubled boys school post World War II. Rachin (Franois Berland), the bitter headmaster, rules with the overbearing model of Action-Reaction. As the children act out, Rachin quickly and harshly punishes them, squashing any idea of freedom from his corruption. The maltreated boys whittle away in spirit as does their freedom to grow. Enter new supervisor Clment Mathieu (Grard Jugnot), a failed musician, knocking at the gates of the school, Fond De LEtang (Rock Bottom). Quickly excelling under the tutelage of their underground choir director Mathieu, the boys prove to be of more maturity than the name of their school would ever suggest.
Whenever Mathieu suggests change, whether it is in regards to more humane disciplinary action against the wishes of Rachin, earning the respect of his students, or bashfully presenting his affections to a students single mother, a flicker of fear on his face betrays his emotions. This is where the strength of Jugnots acting lies. It is not found in large, overblown moments; Jugnots quality is found in his small smiles of support to his students behind Rachins back, in his caretaking of a bullied student, and in his softly spoken decisions of punishment and reward for the choirs talented, moody soprano soloist.
Though Jugnot plays Matieu with phenomenally subtle emotions, the plot does not prove to be quite so sincere. Its a path well-traveled: An unexperienced teacher implements positive change by taming a group of abandoned students trapped in a corrupt system. Remind anyone else of Mr. Hollands Opus or The Dead Poets Society?  In fact, an old French film called The Cage of Nightingales (1945) served as inspiration for Les Choristes, so any originality that may have been left cannot be claimed by the writer/director, Christophe Barratier. While charming, the idea of a catalytic teacher painstakingly trying to connect to his students soon loses its warm, romantic quality and becomes stale.
As a self-proclaimed music connoisseur, my struggle with the plot was soon forgotten with the airy, haunting musical score. Long, moving melodies of the boys choir are used in perfect succession with the rising and falling hope in the movie. An orchestra-heavy background sounds dreamy in comparison to the unpolished voices of the boys choir, which only further adds authenticity and playfulness. No knowledge of the French language is needed to enjoy this music, and any flaws with the less than original storyline are enveloped by the stirring score.
Its raining as I now finish my review. Against all odds, the sun is still shining through the gloom to create an unexpected atmosphere of both melancholy and joy, much as the boys of Fond De LEtang do. In this weather, I am reminded of the choirs beautiful, haunting voices, Clment Mathieus hopeful story, and, most of all, of how a young eighth grade girl was able to look past unoriginality to find an uplifting tale of hope in Les Choristes.",1411516800,,3640,5.066666666666666

1113186,5,7502596496,"This is an incredible film. Beautiful music, heart-wrenching acting, a compelling story. Failed musician Clement Mathieu takes on the lowest of low teaching positions: he is to be a ""pion"" (study hall supervisor; literally, a ""pawn"") in a French reform school in the late 1940s. There, he is appalled to find the boys ruled by a strict disciplinarian with no interest in teaching the boys anything but ""action -- reaction!"" He secretly begins to teach the boys to sing, and they begin to blossom. My high-school French students loved it. A sweet film for francophiles and musicians alike.",1402444800,,588,5.010204081632653
1113187,5,7502596496,"A sensitively told story of child abuse by an institution in France in 1949 dedicated to the punishment and reform of troubled boys.  A new teacher, a failed musician, decides to teach his recalcitrant charges singing in parts, initially composing items for them based on their own ideas.  Adramatic change comes about in the boys' behaviour in his class.  The director of the school reacts ambivalently, hovering between ridicule of any such attempt and reluctant pride when a public recognition of the chorus by a wealthy aristocratic sponsor of the institution results in praise which he draws to himself.  However, his superficial praise reverts to ridicule and condemnation when the successful teacher refuses to subordinate his musical therapy to the ignorant and manic attitude of the director who demands he cease the chorale training.  He is summarily dismissed for his insubordination.

One talented youth he has nurtured pursues a musical career and it is his teacher's recollections in the formof a journal which reveal the pathetic existence of that institution and its dreadful treatment of its population of troubled and frustrated boys between the ages of around five to adolescence.  We thus see how the introduction of music into their deprived lives gives them both hope and inspires them with new possibilities.  These recollections also reveal the fate of the deranged martinet who had been the director under whom they had all suffered.

The casting, locations and the music combine to create a touching experience in which one can empathise with the troubled boys deprived of all humane and creative stimulation.  The respite from unreasonable discipline and the despair of boredom from which music was able to liberate them suggests that creative endeavours -- in this case music making -- can indeed, to borrow Lovelace's words,  ""calm the savage breast.""  Christophe Barratier's capable direction convincingly draws the story from the players in a way that stirs one's emotions, but in a particularly French way which avoids sentimentality in favour of logical explication of the way emotions may be stimulated or suppressed.  Actions and reactions are thus examined discreetly, revealing in stark contrast the results of unbending discipline and unreasonable punishment or humane treatment and a caring imparting of the joys of participationin making music which liberates the hapless boys from their sterile environment of mental deprivation and the denial of their humanity.

A great film indeed and a great contribution to the efforts of enlightened teachers to bring forth the best from their students by encouraging self expression and the appreciation of creative group activities such as choral singing.",1402099200,,2737,5.34965034965035

Rachin,  disciplinarian whose oft-repeated refrain for the school is ""action - reaction,"" meaning that there will be severe consequences for any boy out of line - or for any boy whom Rachin perceives to be out of line. January 15, 1949 marks the arrival to the school of the new supervisor, M. Clment Mathieu, a middle-aged man who is trying to find his place in life after a series of failed endeavors, particularly as a composer.

1113337,5,7502596496,"""The Chorus"" takes place in post-war France as boys were placed in
boarding schools that were places of both repression and refuge. What I
liked most about this film was Clement Mathieu, a failed musician who
takes a job as supervisor in the prison-like school, and his attitude
towards a group of unfortunate and misunderstood young boys. He treated
them with the utmost respect and believed that each one possessed a
special gift or talent they could show the world. Two ideas I found
interesting were the importance of the children's needs of fathers in
their lives is explored in this film. This idea can be easily accepted
because of how quickly the children began to have respect for their
instructor. His kindness toward the children is returned to him by the
students, as they respond to the way he teaches music to motivate and
interest them. The children's affection was demonstrated after their
instructor was fired by tossing goodbye letters out of the window as he
walked away from the school. Another interesting idea was how the
colors in the film set the mood for the audience. For example, to allow
the feeling of transformation within the school, the color goes from
grays, to bold and bright colors towards the end. Not only does this
type of detail help set the mood, but also allows the audience to feel
as if they were one of students in the film.

A couple of things that were particularly French were the food that the
children were served, and the principle's (Rachin) attitude of
sincerity and outspokenness. The music, which was created by the film
director, gives the film the right tone. It has such a sweetness to it
that it disarms us and gets us into the right mood for enjoying it even
more. The acting was very outstanding, simple, and comical at times,
especially from Clement. The children were very sweet, especially the
very little Pepinot.

The director, Christophe Barratier, began his career as a classical
guitarist, winning several international competitions. In 1991 he
joined Galatee Films, where he was an associate producer on several
movies, including ""Winged Migration (2001). He then directed his first
short, Les Tombales (2002). He next wrote, directed and composed the
music for his first film ""The Chorus"" (2005). This movie won the
Crystal Heart Award at the Heartland Film Festival and has been
nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Foreign Language Film at
the BAFTA Awards.",1354579200,,2440,4.905569007263923
1113338,4,7502596496,"The Chorus is the French version of a heartwarming coming of age tale. There are many things I liked about the film; the story line was simple and easy to follow. This is not a new story, but none the less was executed very nicely. Directed by Christophe Barratier, this film was his directorial debut, and a fine one at that. He led the film to receive an Academy Award nomination for best foreign language film. The film was well liked by most audiences due to its warmhearted story line and loveable characters.
 The actors in this film had amazing talent. School boy Pierre (Jean-Baptiste Maunier) real voice was used throughout the film. This gave the film just the touch it needed, his voice alone allowed for the audience to adore him. Pierre Morhange (Jacques Perrin) the young choir's teacher seemed to take his character to heart and show real emotion on screen. The films storyline is not something we all haven't seen before; it is not a new idea, just new characters. The film does have a few twists that some may not see coming, but that is about it.
An idea that the film explores is the idea that one can escape the path that has been set before him by society. It takes some talent and the will but one can find a way out of a horrible life. Optimism is infused throughout the film. Another idea that is seen throughout the film is hope, young Pepinot (Maxence Perrin) shows that hope is everlasting.
French aspects of the film that are notable was the school itself. The headmaster was ever so strict and the landscape of it all was so typically French. The caf's and architecture were beautiful and so typically French. The depth and development of the characters had a French culture about them as well.
The part of the movie that was somewhat poor was the use of the flashback technique. There was no use to it as the older version of the characters did not even really remember the story. This only led to the audience leaving with a somewhat sour taste in their mouth regarding the callousness of the elderly men. It was a twist that was unnecessary and just confused people. Overall the film was successful and took an old washed up story and gave it new life. Defiantly a must see.",1354579200,,2206,4.515

As the new teacher arrives, the bleakness of the setting in rural France reflects the disheartening tenor of the school.  The formation of the chorus is the means to breaking down the shuttered desperation of the students (and even another teacher).  It is a wonderful credo that demonstrates how music (and by extension, all the arts) and redeem and motivate people classed as beyond salvation.

One of the elements that makes the magic so memorable is the singing itself.  The music, much of which was written for the movie, has a lovely, lilting quality--quite French.

Far less flashy than Mr. Holland, this film centers around a reluctant music teacher and failed composer who ends up teaching at a boarding school for boys (basically a  slightly-less-than-prison for unwanted young vagabonds and troubled boys).  Without going into plot details, it deals with the growth and development of people in themselves and with each other that music can bring.  I found this to be a very profound yet simple film.  It doesn't want to shock & awe you, nor does it want to pound you with tragedy after tragedy...instead, it takes you by the hand and guides you gently through an exploration of hard reality in both music and the human heart.  It's not my most favorite music film...but it is among my top list of must see films for music teachers, music lovers, and people wanting a clean but profoundly life changing story.  In this film, you will be amazed at how one small and willing action can change the course of many (including the one who did the action).

The music in the film alone is absolutely brilliant and completely took me away into another world. Just for the music, you should watch it!

I watched this film about two years ago for my French class. What I really love about this story is that it is about a teacher, who is considered a failure himself, goes to a school where there are dysfunctional kids and really brings hope and joy into their life through music. The kids and the teacher have a rough start. They try to prank him whenever they can and try to make him leave the school. When he first arrives there, he asks these misbehaving and ill-reputable children what their dreams are, and asks them to write it on a piece of paper. What surprises Mathieu, the teacher, is that although these kids are seen to be so reckless who cannot be helped have Dreams. They know what they want to become in the future. There's so much depth and layers to this film, which I appreciate.

There are so many movies that are so plain or formulaic. Luckily, this movie is neither of those. It makes you think, reflect, and have a little hope and also a pocket full of sunshine. Bring some tissues and a full heart.

You have the typical roster of characters:  the idealistic new guy who wants to try new things, the stodgy hide-bound boss who indulges in cruel injustice, the love interest, an evil delinquent, and blooming children in very bad circumstances.  But there is a difference:  for many, things don't work out, with terrible consequences.  WW II is also in the background, as France is pulling itself up and new paths are opening up.  The music is also beautiful, the boy of angelic beauty of body and voice.

1113415,5,7502596496,"Les Choristes was a perfect storm of enjoyment for me. I have worked with at risk youth for many years and I marveled at Clement Mathieu, the lead character in the movie, and his instinctive ability to grow in his role as a supervisor at what was a brutally run school for troubled boys. The way he was able to quickly find unique and individualized ways to bring the best out of boys who were rather feral and disobedient was heartwarming.

But more than anything as a singer in choirs since my own childhood, it is the exquisite music that makes this movie and the way music was used to `tame the savage beast'. Gerard Jugnot (the lead actor and co-producer) risked a mortgaged apartment to fund this movie and was rewarded with a box office smash hit that stayed at No 1 in France for most of 2004. I can see why. The movie is fantastically compelling and tugs on your heartstrings at many places.

As a singer who has heard and sung in choirs in the presence of professionally trained soloists, it is difficult to overstate the stunning beauty of the voice of supporting actor Jean Baptiste Maunier who plays the brooding and troubled boy Pierre Mohrange. All the singing for the movie was done by the famous Les Petits Chanteurs de Saint-Marc - a specially selected chorus of children aged 8 to 15 from Lyon in France. Maunier was LPCSM lead soloist but only he was also cast to sing AND act in the movie and he demonstrated that his acting is almost as excellent as his singing.

Many, like me, have greatly extended the pleasure of this movie by purchasing the soundtrack which only partially showcases the pure musical genius of this choir and the exquisite excellence of Maunier's voice. LPCSM toured France to sellout crowds and Maunier himself has become a super star there on the strength of his singing and has augmented his performance in Les Choristes with various other dramatic and teen acting roles.

If you YouTube LPCSM and JB Maunier you will hear them sing some of the most inspiring and beautiful pieces at a recorded concert they gave in Paris including breathtaking solo parts by Jean Baptiste that are simultaneously angelic and electrifying. This movie became the perfect showpiece for these twin gems and a most compelling ode to the notion that even the most afflicted child can be turned around and improved by love, attention, the power of accomplishment and the introduction to beautiful music.",1280620800,2,2426,4.701176470588235

I'd hate to think that the writers consciously borrowed from the above-mentioned films, but nevertheless elements of each are clearly present.  The opening and then flashback is reminiscent of Cinema Paradiso.  [Aside: Jacques Perrin, who plays the adult Toto in that movie plays in this movie the adult music director/orchestra conductor.  And his son plays one of the boys in the school.]  The prefect's attempts to engage the boys through music is similar to Robin Williams teaching poetry the way it should be taught [SPOILER ALERT!...with the same final outcome.]  The headmaster, cruel and sadistic, reminds us of the warden in The Shawshank Redemption.  [SPOILER ALERT! And justice does win out, though without a suicide, not that we would have minded.]

This makes the film a bit trite.  And predictable.  Yet is is also about the human spirit.  Don't all of us in some ways feel imprisoned, yearning to experience something beyond the grayness of everyday life?  Don't we often look back, wondering about the talent we didn't develop, the call we weren't able to follow?  Don't we dream from time to time of wanting to have some sort of real and humanizing impact on others, to give them a breath of life?

So watch, enjoy, shed a tear or two.  It's a good film, but not a great film.",1272326400,,1504,4.944
1113433,4,7502596496,"This movie brought tears to my eyes several times--and for that, kudos!  Overall it's a wonderful story of a music teacher who comes into a horrible, horrible reform school that abuses and tortures children, and brings light and hope and joy (via music) to some of their lives.  It is a story of redemption, and well worth watching.

But even more so, it played almost entirely as true.  Aside from at the end, when the teacher confronted the headmaster (and called him ""evil"") did I feel the movie to be overdone.  So aside from one scene, I felt I was really watching the real thing, not watching actors.  Kudos again!

That said, my criticisms.  Chances are most people won't agree with them say (because they usually don't), but so be it:

1) The main character, the gentle music teacher, was too weak for my taste.  This especially came to light when the headmaster was viciously abusing a very disturbed boy, and in his vendetta against the boy lied and had him sent to prison for stealing money (which the boy never stole).  The music teacher could have outed the headmaster to save the boy.  But he didn't.  Instead he saved the headmaster's life and let the boy rot in jail.  Sick!

2) The music teacher, while a wonderful man in some ways, was too selfish for my taste.  His main motivation in life was to further his own dreams--and he did this, at times, at the expense of the boys.  His precious chorus was more important to him than the needs of the boys.  Yes, to a degree he loved them, but he loved his music more.  For instance, when one troubled boy (the same one who was arrested) was being sent to solitary ""lock-up"" for fifteen days, the teacher's main frustration with this was not with the torture of the boy, but with the following:  ""But he's my only baritone!""  YUCK!

3) I know I can be criticized for this, but I condemn anyone, seemingly benevolent or otherwise, who could even work in such a vicious torture chamber as that school.  To work there, to collect a paycheck there, to further your own artistic goals there, and to do and say nothing significant about the torture there is tantamount to acceptance of it.  And to me this is a metaphor for our world.  Hell is going on everywhere, but most people say nothing.  It's too politically incorrect.  And they don't want to risk their own skin.

So, ultimately, the beloved music teacher was essentially a weak parent.  He's the parent who does little that is overt and strong to stop an abusive situation, and just tries to slip in under the cracks and do some good here and there.  I don't wish to take away from the good he did, but I'm sick of weak parents.  Our world needs strong, ethical parents--and ethical leaders--who do right NO MATTER WHAT.",1262304000,,2737,4.524489795918368

1113449,4,7502596496,"Les Choristes is a touching, charming, funny, and thought-provoking film that teaches many lessons in life.  More so, the story focuses on how a teacher encourages a group of underprivileged boys to believe in themselves and their capacities to develop and overcome obstacles in their daily lives. The result is often a feel-good drama and incorporates a balance of light humor.  It was a pleasure to see how the film sets off with the two boys as adults reminiscing about school through their teacher's eyes, before the story flashes back to the boarding school they attended.  As I watched the headmaster, Rachin, being an unsympathetic character and rigid with his rules, this film surprisingly did not dwell on too many unpleasant events, instead offered hope in the form of positive action with the help of Mathieu.  He shows a caring attitude and tries to defend the boys instead of punishing them.  Mathieu's success with the boys is that they learn to appreciate music and sing beautifully.  More importantly, they learn to respect him and the others through their own success in music.  Perhaps they've already had a talent in singing and they just needed someone to cultivate their own abilities.  They eventually learn to treat one another with consideration, instead of the mischievous behaviour they previously displayed due to the traditional ""action-reaction"" methods.  The story suggests that one person can make a difference. Mathieu was a great inspiration who taught humanity and respect - a wonderful conclusion to this drama.

There are ugly moments throughout, and a few glorious moments that can make a simple mind like mine think that perfection could really happen, under the circumstances.

1113453,5,7502596496,"We've seen them all - films from the teacher-student body drama genre. Dead Poets' Society, Mona Lisa Smile, Children of the Lesser God, Stand and Deliver, Mr. Holland's Opus, and all those sports flicks. The plot is typical - a group of students or a whole school of hooligans, handicapped, or privileged but uninspired adolescents transform into promising individuals who believed in themselves, thus challenging the common view that they are a hopeless bunch through the new revolutionary teacher. The teacher comes from out of town, unfamiliar with the new community, copes with their own personal failures and frustrations through an unintentional life mission, and as a result, does not sit well with the headmaster and parents, what with their with unorthodox teaching methods. Teacher struggles to reach out to students (main character usually a silent one, with untapped potential but happens to have extraordinary, scholarship-worthy talent), succeeds, but in the end cannot beat the system and eventually gets kicked out from the school.

Les Choristes is a French, postwar-set version of this well-known formulaic plot. Think, Dangerous Minds meets School of Rock. Typical of most European films nominated for the Oscars, it is both subtly dramatic and comedic. It has an entire cast of adorable little faces, making it easy for the audience to fall in love with the brats. The spotlight was really on cute Pepinot, the youngest student, who does not seem to have any reason to be in that school except that he was orphaned. The heartstring-tugging themes of teaching young minds to dream, making a difference, the power of kindness, music as a universal expression - we've seen them over and over. Even the farewell scene is predictable - if in Mona Lisa Smile, the girls chased Julia Roberts' car on their bikes as she drove off and in Dead Poets' Society, everyone stood on their desks to protest Robin Williams' dismissal, here, all the students flew paper airplanes with personal notes out the window to bid goodbye to Mathieu. So, what's new?

Nothing really, I'm just a sucker for charming European films like this and I won't even bother explaining how this movie is any different. Except probably that unlike most movies of the same genre that had their predictable tear-jerker parts, here I started crying about 5 minutes into the film and every 5 minutes thereafter.

There's plenty of evidence from French cinema that boys schools were rough places and not really much different from reformatories. Here the amenties are few and the rules are many, and the school itself looks like it barely survived WWII.

Grard Jugnot, a kind of sweetly tempered Wally Shawn, dubbed ""Chrome Dome"" from his first day on the job, delivers a lovingly nuanced performance of a teacher who understands how it's a mistake to make adversaries of students - they simply outnumber you - and to win them over by basically making deals with them, in which both of you have something to gain. He must play a careful balancing act between his own best instincts and the authoritarian headmaster, whose action-reaction school of discipline has all the boys seething with resentment and rebellion. But the boys find themselves drawn by curiosity into becoming a chorus, performing their teacher's own compositions. They finally triumph at a command performance before an aristocratic benefactor. Which is not to say all ends well, but anyone who has ever been a teacher will find much to recognize and celebrate in this charming film.",1197676800,2,1367,4.917748917748917

1113488,5,7502596496,"In this masterful effort by first-time director Christophe Barratier, the new prefect at a school for troubled boys decides to start a chorus, against the cruel headmaster's warnings. It seems just the thing to give the boys purpose and unity. But then a true juvenile delinquent is enrolled as an experiment, and he upsets everyone's world and even sabotages the chorus.

Gerard Jugnot is wonderful as Clement Mathieu, the prefect, whose heart for the boys and love of music holds the whole piece together. Jean-Baptiste Maunier plays Pierre Morhange, an exceptionally talented boy in whom Mathieu takes special interest, and who is telling the story as an adult. Marie Bunel plays Pierre's single mother, with whom Mathieu is smitten, and of whom Pierre is ashamed because the other boys tease him about her beauty. Francois Berleand plays the dapper but unfeeling headmaster Rachin.

There is an often repeated philosophical maxim at the school: action-reaction. Rachin uses this concept to show the boys that whenever they do something wrong, there will be a negative reaction, often in the form of ""lock-up."" Mathieu goes against this system by showing the boys love. It is his love that wins them over to his way of thinking, while Rachin's methods only alienated them and made them worse. The boys see that Mathieu is on their side, so the chorus grows and blossoms, as do the boys.

Mathieu writes all the music the boys sing, and it is wonderful, especially the solos by Pierre. He has a beautiful soprano voice. This is a very touching, heart-warming film, but there are some rough moments. It isn't easy converting a prison to a boys' home. Anyone that loves music, boys, education and seeing how love can change someone's life will love Les Choristes.

1113501,5,7502596496,"Despite viewing many Japanese Anime, I cannot consider myself a foreign movie fan. I don't mind watching occasional live-action flicks from places other than America, but most of the time it's hit and miss for me. That said I was pleasantly surprised to discover how much I enjoyed LES CHORISTES (or, as the Miramax DVD release calls it, THE CHORUS).  Gently told and beautifully photographed, this drama from first-time director Christophe Barratier struck both an emotional and musical chord with this viewer--in fact it was enough to bring back childhood memories for me. But before I get all sappy, onto the movie itself.

Set in 1947 France, LES CHORISTES tells the story of Clment Mathieu, a music composer and teacher who finds himself taking a job at Fond de L'Etang, a run-down boarding school consisting of troubled boys who are either orphans or borderline delinquents. Mathieu, a patient, compassionate fellow, eventually turns the entire school upside down when he communicates with the boys through his special talent of music.  Before long, the insubordinate wards are transformed into a melodic chorus, much to the chagrin of the school's cruel and abusive headmaster, M. Rachin, who emphasizes corporal punishment as the method for dealing with misbehavior.  Mathieu, on the other hand, has a different --or, if you will, kinder-- method for dealing with rowdy boys.  For one thing he does not tell on them and instead sentences them to lighter consequences.

Over the course of his continual (albeit forbidden) chorus sessions, Mathieu sees potential in one Pierre Morhange, a surly boy with an absolutely stupendous voice and musical gifts which enables him to become the choir's soloist. But first Mathieu must bring the troubled, quick-tempered kid out of his shell. This task is made less easier when Mathieu develops romantic feelings for Morhange's single mother, Violette; it only earns Mathieu Morhange's wrath. Eventually, however, things work out and Pierre eventually finds a career as a highly successful conductor. This is actually displayed at the beginning of the movie, where we see Morhange, as an elderly man, leading his orchestra, and later, reading through the personal journal of his former music teacher. (The whole story, in case you didn't figure out by now, is told entirely in flashback.)

As entertainment, LES CHORISTES is heartfelt and uplifting without being too sappy, but as a story it is especially winning. Okay, so it may not be the most original tale --other movies have reprised many of the themes expressed in this movie countless times-- but director Barratier makes this movie ""sing"" by providing both credibility and real emotion to the characters and their situations. Aside from the numerous moments where we see the boys singing songs Mathieu writes for them, some of my favorite sequences in the movie involved Mathieu gently persuading any troubled boy into confessing their misdeed without reporting them. A subplot involving a boy stealing money from the school, in particular, turns out to be a touching episode, especially when we discover the real culprit and learn that his intentions are to free himself from the unloving walls of the school.

Personally, however, this movie struck me as a delightful trip down memory lane. I used to attend a musical summer camp for several years, where I've sung in chorus. The scenes where Mathieu and his boys are performing, in particular, were strong enough to recall that special feeling of inclusion for me during the good ol' days.

Speaking for the movie itself, LES CHORISTES is handsomely photographed and well-acted--particularly noteworthy are Grard Jugnot as the kindly music teacher, Jean-Baptiste Maunier as the talented but emotionally troubled Pierre, and Maxence Perrin as a sympathetic orphan in search of his father. Naturally, since music is the subject for this movie, one would expect nothing less than the angelic sound of a boys' choir, and LES CHORISTES delivers this in full. Particularly spectacular is the song during a performance for the French countess. It helps, too, that the boys have excellent voices. (By the way, the singers are none other than the professional boys' choir Les Petits Chanteurs de Saint-Marc Choir.)

Some may argue that LES CHORISTES lacks originality, especially for a film that was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film, but for what it is, this is a very moving, touching story, well executed and heartfelt. I recommend it heartily, especially for music lovers and fans of feel-good movies.

One catch--Miramax's DVD has an excellent visual transfer but sadly doesn't have any bonus features.  Considering that this is a recent release, one would expect more.  On the other hand, since this movie didn't receive the same ecstatic reception here in America as its native country, France, (and arthouse movies with subtitles like these aren't crowd-drawers), it probably is not too surprising.",1178409600,3,4961,5.201754385964913
1113502,5,7502596496,"""Les Choristes"" is delightful! I am a sucker for boys choirs, and I like foreign films, so I expected a pleasant evening. This one unfolds beautifully and it exceeds my expectations, so I recommend it to you.

First of all,  the ""frame story"":  we know that we are to see the story of a teacher who comes to a school for troubled boys and teaches them to sing, but this tale is couched within the telling of events that happened much later.  A famous musician is called back to his homeland, France,  when he must bury his mother.  While there, he receives a visitor who presents him with the journal of the humble teacher who had ""discovered"" him when they were both boys at the Fond de l'tang.  Together they read the journal and relive the events that changed both of their lives for the good.  Where the journal ends, the visitor takes up the tale and relates ""the rest of the story.""

The casting is good and I also enjoyed the realistic scenery--the oppressive, dilapidated school, as so forth.  The actors seemed generally more natural and believable than Hollywood actors tend to be.  Grard Jugnot is perfect as the unassuming and un-glamourous Clement Mattieu.  I like how the boys come in all sizes and with varied features.  Except that they are just a bit too pat;  the first ""bad boy"" is homely, the real thug is a pimply redhead, ""Boniface"" is a little curly mop-top with glasses, and the soloist with the heartrendingly beautiful voice is also beautiful of face.  And the adorable tiny-tim orphan--he gets his just reward, too.  A bit sweetsy.

The film nicely illustrates the fact that there are those people living quiet lives, out of the limelight, doing ""small things"" that make big differences in our world.  Mattieu understood the meaning of life:  that every individual, no matter how hopeless he or she seems, has great worth, and that the greatest thing we can do during our brief sojourn on this planet is to help others.  To lessen suffering and to help others achieve more is the biggest achievement of all.

And yes, the music is very pretty.",1177459200,4,2070,4.647382920110193
1113503,5,7502596496,"""A MAN AMONG WOLVES""  National Geographic Channel  one hour special with Shaun Ellis as he teaches three wolf pups abandoned by their mother how to hunt and survive.

""The Chorus""  (Les Choristes)  Running Time: 97 Minutes / Rating: PG-13  Director: Christophe Barratier Cast: Grard Jugnot (Clment Mathieu), Jean-Paul Bonnaire (La Pre Maxence), Franois Berland (Monsieur Rachin), Marie Bunel (Violette Morhange), Philippe Du Janerand (Monsieur Langlois), Jean-Baptiste Maunier (Pierre Morhange), Grgory Gatignol (Mondain), Maxence Perrin (Ppinot), Thomas Blumenthal (Corbin), Cyril Bernicot (Le Querrec), Simon Fargeot (Boniface), Thodul Carr-Cassaigne (Leclerc), Kad Merad (Chabert)

The National Geographic Special on Shaun Ellis and the wolf pups is an interesting hour as this two legged Englishman teaches three rejected North American Timberwolf pups how to survive including fishing, singing, hunting and working out the relationships within the pack.  He gets down and dirty with the pups as he wears the same clothes for two years and eats the same food, growls and asserts his Alpha dominance.  Along the way his own family deserts him as he makes the choice to stay with the wolves.  After two years and a necessary separation from the pack he is forced to submit himself and become the pack ""peacemaker"" since he no longer has the physical strength to assert his leadership.  At that point he becomes the clever ""peacemaker"" who through force of ""superior"" knowledge is able to choose to give up obvious power for the power that is behind the throne.  One could almost relate to the White House's Carl Rove position as he survived through his wits and greater knowledge of the outside world.

This is an old story that tells a lot about the dominant culture's projections onto other species and what they believe they will need to survive.  We cannot know what these three beautiful wolves would have been like if they had grown up naturally.  Indeed we can't even judge how good a teacher Ellis was but his journey into howling may have taught the science folks some important lessons about wolf music and even some of the purposes of singing in primal reality.

This takes us over into the French film from 2005 just making its appearance on the cable channels.  Funny thing about it or Surprise!  It's the same story.  Failed French musician accepts a job teaching in a state reform school for wild children who are doomed to graduate into a society that doesn't know or appreciate their talents.  The teacher discovers their voices and like the wolves, he teaches them to sing and to release their aggression through art and the cooperative values of choral ensemble.  We even have the Alpha male and the Peacemaker.  The teacher writes new music for them, brings out their lovely voices and teaches them to keep the authorities at bay with the beauty and power of the human voice.  He even, like Ellis, lives with them as he integrates them into the ways of Western Civilization.  His star singer even becomes a professional musician and tells the story in flashbacks.  It is a lovely story and I suspect is more true for humans than for wolves since we can't talk to the wolves and get them to grade their teacher although they obviously love Shaun Ellis a lot.

That being said, I would recommend both programs for the lessons learned about the evolution of consciousness and cooperation through the power of music even across species.  As for Wolves?  I suspect that we have always had people who went out to live with and learn from Wolves, Bears and other consciousnesses.  We do have such stories from our history.

I would also point out that our ancestors went to learn from them and had the necessary humility about what they themselves had to teach the wolf and the bear.  The minimum for learning from a bear was three years before you could even begin the lessons and survive.  We should tender our humility in these matters since yesterday's NYTimes pointed out that Chimpanzees had better memories than humans in certain areas having to do with numbers.

If you love kids, see this movie.  If you are a teacher or a musician, see this movie.  If you love old French movies, when they were good, like Truffaut and Malle....see this movie.

Some of the reviewers here have complained that the story is predictable.

I found the acting so good and the story so engaging that I followed right along, not knowing what was going to happen.  Even if I did (this is the second time I've seen it) it's still so charming that every moment was enjoyable. (I rarely see a movie more than once.)

The Amazon reviewer actually called this overly sweet but I notice that the average number of stars assigned is five---as good as it gets, so I think he's outvoted.  Too bad some people are so cynical that they complain about  honest goodness.  There's a difference between genuine sweetness and sacharine sentimentality.  I often cringe at Hollywood's ideas of ""adorable children"" but these kids are fresh and natural.  There is no lack of pain and grit in the story either.

The acting is wonderful.  Gerard Jugnot, as the pear shaped, ""chrome dome""

failed musician, teacher captured my heart immediately and never let it go.

I won't give it away, but the ending is terrific---Bring Kleenex!

Last, the music is enchanting!  If you don't see this for any other reason, this is enough.  I love what one of the readers here said---that several angels in Heaven resigned when they heard these kids!

Even in French theaters, where moral ambiguity and cigarette smoking reign, THE CHORUS reigned at number one for a goodly portion of 2004. But as earnest and heart-warming as it is, let's not get entirely carried away; from the user reviews here, one might be misled to believe that this film is a classic, as opposed to the genial and well-made movie that it is.

LES CHORISTES' ""paint-by-the-numbers"" (or perhaps ""sing-to-the-notes"") plot of adversity and triumph won't surprise anyone, but viewers will enjoy the hearty acting and beautiful film-making. The opening sequence signals the quality in store: A conductor learns of his mother's death just before a concert. When he takes up his baton and launches the orchestra, his face is troubled and grief-stricken, and then we watch as the music slowly transports him for a time to a realm of delight.

1113515,5,7502596496,"I can identify with this movie because over the years our family has had about 150 different kids, mostly disadvantaged kids, stay with us for varying amounts of time.  While a lot of them didn't meet our hopes for them, I can think of only one that was simply incorrigible, unreachable.  So, when Clement can look into a hurting boy, considered incorrigible, and see a good kid, I know what he is thinking, and why.  The only trouble with this movie is that it is hard to read the subtitles through tears!

It is a very touching story of one man who goes against the system of the delinquent school to bring out the best in the boys.  Clement followed the exact same steps that my wife and I  followed with difficult kids.  First, one has to gain the respect of the child by letting them know that you accept them just as they are.  When Clement covered up for mischief a kid did, while not condoning it, this is what he was doing.  Once the child knows that you are going to love him or her just as they are, then they naturally want to please the one person they can trust to love them.  So, Clement was able to start to introduce positive behaviors to the boys.  Once they started to respond to his efforts to evoke good behavior, he was able to introduce challenges each boy could accomplish if they worked at it.  As they succeeded, they built genuine positive self-esteem.  Finally, when they were familiar with the feeling of self accomplishment, Clement was able to let them fail because he knew their taste of accomplishment would come through to help them overcome the failure!  (That is what Clement was doing when Pierre got to expecting special treatment; then Clement gave Pierre a new chance to succeed at the most opportune time for Pierre.)  They then knew the path to success and true self-esteem.

This is a movie about kids that really is for any adult who works with kids or that has a family.  It is a road map of how to handle strong-willed kids to raise them to become successful adults.  'The Chorus' comes in among the top five movies of the 2,000+ live-action films relating to children and teens in my personal DVD library!",1159833600,3,2152,4.4743589743589745
1113516,4,7502596496,"Les Choristes is a fairly lightweight French film which warms one's tummy. It is the tale of a sweet, funny professor (Clment Mathieu played by Grard Jugnot) who begins work at a troubled boys' boarding school. He miraculously brings these [very] unruly children into order with music. M Mathieu punishes misbehavior with useful and conscience activating tasks. Of course, the principal of the school is an irredeemable jerk who takes credit for Mathieu's successes after impeding him every step of the way. Ultimately, Mathieu inspires the children, discovers a true talent, learns from the children, and [insert all sorts of wonderful things].

I took off one point because the quickness with which Clment turns delinquents into a boys choir is, shall we say, implausable. Here and there are a few plot holes that create a few uneven characters. Also, it is easy to guess that this film is a tad formulaic.

Still, there are so many reasons to recommend this movie to movie lovers. The acting, for example, is lovely, as are many characterizations. Grard Jugnot is so fine as the music teacher, the art of his acting didn't even cross my mind. Jean-Baptiste Maunier plays Pierre Morhange, a mysterious and melancholy boy-prodigy. Though Morhange is never fully explained, Maunier creates an intriguing character. To describe his voice as angelic is a cliche that must be repeated. For some reason, all my girlfriends (who are a few years older than he is) had a crush on him. Creepy, but it must be the brooding French-ness, voice, and also angelic face.

The boys are all genuinely adorable. La Pre Maxence played by Jean-Paul Bonnaire is another caring character in the form of an old janitor (I believe) at the school.

Being French lightweight, Les Choristes still has several unsettling moments and characters. Grgory Gatignol is excellent as Mondain, a disturbed boy who is probably the only character (other than the headmaster) who is too far to be reached. His character doesn't have a huge impact on the story, though, and his story is only subtley and briefly developed.

On a better note: listen to that music. I bet you'll be overcome with ""awwws"" and chills (unless such sweetness makes you nauseous).

1113529,2,7502596496,"The plot is full of commonplaces, its characters are so cartoonish one
can hardly feel anything for anybody, and I felt manipulated all the
time. We've seen this story too many times. Better told, by Dickens,
and even worse, like in ""Devil's backbone/ El espinazo del diablo"" and
Mr Holland's Opus.

I liked the way it shows the harsh life of this forgotten ""layer"" of
society, good for those who idealize ""all things European"" like I do.
Yes, the scenery is beautiful. So is Marie Brunel (Violette, Pierre's
mum), in a pivotal secondary role. The sexual tension is greatly
resolved! Gerard Jugnot IS great as the self-effacing but brilliant
school teacher. Rachin, the principal/ headmaster, is quite overdone
and erratic, but I'm sure it's the story that sucks. He does very well
with a stupid character. His final attack on Clement is well done, I
guess it's the only moment I felt I wasn't watching a film for
children.

The boys are VERY well cast, all of them. From the soloist soprano
(what a voice!) to the criminal ""Mondain"" (name! *like Dickens :) ),
the curly one, the ""pedestal"", and ""Pepinot"", the cute dreamy one who
longs for his parents. The countess is fine too.

It has a lot to say about educators in harsh conditions. Things must be
much worse now that then, but Clement would make a great child
psychologist if he really were an unemployed teacher! This ""action/
reaction"" if of course a caricature of behaviourism. As such, it warns
its most fervent practitioners I guess.

It's a pity, this film could have been great, the topic is important
for it to be treated like a (bad) Disney story. It even deals about
child abuse in a great small dialogue in the beginning ""I expect
everything bad about people HERE"" is the simple way the prefect/ guard
Chabert sums it up. Who also ends up being charmed by Clement, who
seems to have a way with everybody.

Kim Anehall in Amazon writes greatly about how sometimes education
receives the ""rejects"" from other professions, makes an intelligent
analogy of Clement's ""rebellion"" to the way the French resistance
worked, and describes very well the process it entails for him to win
them over. Jeffrey E Ellis' Twain quote in the same place is GREAT, but could
well be called ""spoilers"" too.

Didn't like this whole ""racconto"" and the fact the adult Pierre is a
superstar musician. Found that particularly cheap, ""winners only"", very
American in their worse sense. In he beginning Clement doesn't know how
to ""stand"" in this fiery militarylike regime, his body tells it all.
Some jokes demand some knowledge of French history, like his reactions
to a Vichy song when he ""auditions"" the boys, or the answer of one kid about Napoleon's death :). The best one belongs to him, of
course, when speaking on hell left behind to Rachin. Also towards the
same target ""I don't think you love many things"". Overall, forgettable
fable. No wonder it got such accolades and Oscar nomination :)!",1153958400,9,2941,4.768172888015717

He has shot to world fame through this film aged just 13 when it was released, which is unsurprising, and so has the choir that he used to sing with (Les Petits Chanteurs de Saint-Marc)who are the choir singing in the film. As a result of this film, I have discovered a love of France and the french language, and of choirboy singing. It also improved my french tremendously. I have bought the soundtrack for the film, I listen to it a lot, and I have rewatched the dvd many times. I even follow the news of Jean-Baptiste Maunier and listen to other songs he has recorded.

1113532,5,7502596496,"""Les Choristes"" (""The Chorus"") is a familiar story about a teacher that comes into a school and makes a difference for students that nobody else cares about.  Even when you narrow down the category to include teachers who use music you should be able to name enough movies in this genre to fill up at least one hand full of fingers.  In fact, the only thing that might make this 2004 film different from the others you have seen from ""Goodbye, Mr. Chips"" to ""Music of the Heart,"" is that it in French.  That is because ""Les Choristes"" takes place in France.

At the start of this movie a man (Jacques Perrin) is awaken with news that someone has died.  We learn that the man is a great conductor and when he goes home for the funeral there is another man (Didier Flamand) waiting for him.  Many years ago they were students together at the Fond de l'Etang boarding school.  Although this is not the best of circumstances, the other man has something to share with the conductor.  The notebook of the man who was their teacher and who taught them how to sing.  The opening page of the notebook is a sketch of the entrance to their school and the drawing transforms into a camera shot and we are back to the beginning of our story.

In 1949 Clement Mathieu (Gerard Jugnot) arrives at Fond de l'Etang to be the new prefect.  His introduction to the students is when Rachin (Franciois Berleand), the head of the school, is disciplining the entire school because no one will admit to being the one who injured one of the teachers with a prank.  Mathieu is a tad overweight and bald, so before the students even know his name they are calling him ""Chrome Dome.""  He knows even less about the boys, but clearly he does not like the way they are being treated and he takes a series of different approaches in dealing with them.  A failed musician, Mathieu hears the boys signing a derogatory song about them and uses that as the inspiration to create a chorus.  His motives are not exactly pure, because I think his primary goal at first is to hear his own music being sung.  But in time they move on to something more formidable (I think it was Jean-Phlippe Rameau's ""La Nuit"").

Three of the students stand out.  Pierre Morhange (Jean-Baptiste Maunier), is one of the leaders of the boy and the least able to admit to having an interest in singing, but he has the voice of an angel.  Pepinot (Maxence Perrin) is one of the smallest boys and an orphan, who believes that his father will come for him on a Saturday.  The newcomer to the school is Mondain (Gregory Gatignol), a bully who is content to be hit over and over again because that is the world in which he lives.  I appreciated the fact that Mathieu does not save them all, and that his legacy is not only with hi students but with the other teachers at the school.  In a story that is fairly predictable, there is a grace note at the end that comes with what should be an unexpected turn of events.  Beyond that it is the earnestness of the performances that elevates ""Les Choristes"" above other films in this genre.

The subtitles are absolute rubbish.  They're crap.  Plain and simple.  The actual songs are so poetic and lovely, but those subtitles turn them into just a bunch of words.  I was so mad when I read them I wanted to call up the people who made them andn enquire about their sanity.  If you're fortunate enough to speak French, you can fully appreciate the movie.  If not, you can still appreciate it, but it won't be as lovely.  Don't get me wrong: I think everyone should watch it.  It's just that some of the passages are so hopeless I want to throw up.

I usually avoid these hated-teacher-turns-mentor-to-impossible-kids themed movies. As a general rule, they make me gag.
However, I don't know what happened in "" Les Choristes"" but the formula works for them, and very well indeed. The plot is highly predictable but charming. Maybe, because the teacher here is more realistic, without the hardknock, street smart wit and comebacks that the other teacher-mentors seem to be naturally gifted with. He is rather goofy and you root for him. Everyone had a teacher that looked like him. The boys really seem like they are singing (though I've heard they are not the real singers) and you are seriously applauding this 'homemade' choir.

The main child character, Pierre Morhange, has a voice described in the movie as ""a miracle""; it is.  His voice is captured beautifully in this CD.  Bit if you admire this remarkable soloist's voice, as I do, be sure to buy Les Choristes En Concerte.  This live concert not only displays the group's musical diversity (including some lovely numbers composed by John Rutter), more importantly, it showcases Jean-Baptiste Maunier's remarkable gift.  Pie Jesu warms you up, but nothing can possibly prepare you for Pueri Concinite. J-P Maunier's voice was an evanescent miracle.  After they heard it, half the angels resigned from heaven in jealous protest.  If you love choral music, don't miss it:  Pueri Concinite is cathartic.

Their students, of course, are the beneficiaries of these ""failed careers.""  As for Les Choristes, what I liked is that the film is simple--a simple story simply told--and, to me, in these fancy-dancy times of special effects and cinematic tricks passed off as high art, such simplcity is refreshingly beautiful.  Another thing, I liked was the hero.  He wasn't the Hollywood version of good-looking.  He was just as plain as could be, a normal human being.  He had a heart.  He gave strength to those around him.  He even had a romanctic side to him.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie with my family and if you're looking for a family event, this could be it.

1113559,5,7502596496,"In ""Les Choristes,"" a student's talent for singing is pursed and discovered by a rigorous, yet beloved and upstanding teacher, M. Mathieus.  Despite his good intentions and care for his many students, the teacher's efforts are suppressed by the principal, Rachin, who does not believe the arts should play a significant role in his strictly academic- driven institution, Fond d' Etang.  Despite the negative feedback given by the principal, M. Mathieus continues to practice with his students.  As the lessons progress, the audience also observes the progression of the spirit of each of his students, as all of his students are eventually enlightened by this man, despite their initial thoughts and skepticisms.  M. Mathieus ability to enlighten the spirit of each student with his knowledge and study of the arts and singing is precisely what allows this highly unconventional teacher to be such a great one.

 Throughout his journey with his students at Fond d'Etang, M. Mathieus pursues the talent of the students, and one young boy in particular.  With M. Mathieus, the students learn to pursue their dreams.  He instills a drive in his students that can easily be observed at my favorite scene of the movie, the conclusion.  Although M. Mathieus leaves the school at the concluding scene, I believe this scene is reflective of all the efforts of this teacher.  At the conclusion of this movie, the students remove the cruel Rachin from office.  Not only has M. Mathieus been able to enlighten the children with music, he has instilled in them a drive against unjust authority.  He also taught them that sometimes, the conventional or societal expecting method is not always the right one.  In this far superior lesson than the lessons of music notes, M. Mathieus is able to change the students' lives for the better.

 M. Mathieus embodies the characteristics of a great teacher.  His ability to pursue the dreams and talents of his students reflects a necessary characteristic of a good teacher: a genuine love and care for his students.  M. Mathieus fought for his faith in his beloved subject: the arts, despite the personal sacrifice.  Most importantly, M. Mathieus was more aware than anyone else in this film that knowledge simply is not good enough.  The ability to share and enlighten others' with what you have learned and experienced in your field is what defines a true scholar and educator.

 Along my career in education, I have been fortunate enough to be enlightened with such brilliant teachers.  One in particular stands out in my mind amongst the rest.  I believe this teachers' brilliance was not only contained in his vast knowledge in his field, but in his obvious passion and delight in teaching his students.  Obviously, the material I retained in his class was extensive.  However, at the conclusion of his class, I walked away with something far superior.  My teacher inspired me to enter a profession of which I was passionate and awed by.  Each of my teacher's lessons was accompanied by his passion for the material he taught as well as his passion for his students.  So in many ways, Mr. Popiel's class never concluded because I will always carry the ""lesson"" he gave me, and perhaps some day, pass it on to my children and others' in the profession I choose to pursue.  As such, even though each of M. Mathieus students may not enter a career in the arts, the lesson he taught them will forever remain in their hearts, as Mr. Popiel's has resided comfortably in mine.  M. Mathieus left Fond d'Etang at the conclusion of the film, but because of what he accomplished in the hearts of his students, I believe it is fair to say that like Mr. Popiel's class, M. Mathieus class shall never conclude.",1139356800,5,3730,4.865293185419969

1113562,5,7502596496,"This film was excellent! Usually, I have lot of critcism for films, but this one, well, I loved it. Even though I belive some people, such as my best friend, a fanatical fan of Hollywood actions and lovecomedies, may not like it that much, I have to say it feels great to have a s.c. ""oscar-movie"" that leaves you with a good feeling when you turn of your TV. Lost in Translation, for example, and The Royal Tenenbaums were both overloaded with red roses and confetti, but to the ""ordinary teenage-girl"", they suck! They're full of hidden meanings and deep psychology. This one brings with it a clear message, and it's easy to watch.

And the singing's great. And 15-year-old soloist Jean-Baptiste Maunier raises himself up way over the rest of many others. He's got an amazing voice and it works excellently together with the rest of the chorus.

This film is about an unemployed supervisor/musicteacher Clement Mathieu (Gerard Deperdieu), who is about to fill in the place of another teacher who got cut with a knife of one of the students at a boarding school for boy orphans close to Bretagne, Fond L'Etang (Rock Bottom). The film takes place in 1948 - 49. When Mathieu first arrives to the school is the gardener Maxcence badly hurt in the eye, a culprit trick of one of the students. Mathieu sees the evil that dominates the school and with a slightly different method is he starting to change the childrens bad visions of life, put there by the mean headmaster monsieur Rachin. He especially takes care of the schools youngest student, Pepinot, whose parent's died during the Nazi occupation of France. One night, Mathieu discoveres that the children sing. Not good, of course, and probably only songs that are sexually related or allthrough mean, but they sing! He decides to give up his old promise about never teaching msic again and starts the choir.

  And while all of this is happening, young student Pierre Morhange (Jean-Baptiste Maunier) is getting punished for drawing cartoons of the headmaster during class. Morhange is not an orphan, but he was sent to the school because he simply couldn't behave in any normal schools. Mathieu is told to watch out for him, because he has ""the face of an angel, spawn of the devil"". But Mathieu discoveres a wonderful gift of Pierres, he's got the most amazing voice. And when the joins the choir as a soloist, it sounds absolutley beautiful. Morhange's mother, Violet is very beautiful, and when she comes to the school for a visit, Mathieu falls in love with her. That is not very appreciated from Pierre. But Mathieu persuades Violette to apply for a scholarship for Pierre, he is wasting his time at Fond L'Etang. Of course, the chorus brings happiness and joy into the school, but everything threatens th break apart when the school accepts a new student, a pervert and pyromaniac.

1113563,4,7502596496,"The Chorus is a French movie with the theme that kindness and humanity conquers the affection of people rather than harshness and cruelty. The movie takes place in a boarding school for ""troubled"" boys. The main character is Clement Mathieu, a failed musician and professional trying his luck as a teacher of music in the school. The school is run by a harsh and strict headmaster named Rachin under the policy, ""action and reaction"" meaning that whenever an act of undiscipline such as playing a harmful prank on the school maintenance man Maxence or stealing a large sum of money, one or more students get punished with beatings, confinement, etc.

At first Mathieu has discipline problems. However, whenever an act of indiscipline occurs, he never reveals the boy to Rachin but basicly talks to the boy and explains the wrongfulness of the action. Eventually, he wins the trust of the boys and the movie gets its highlight when he forms a choir amongst the boys of the school, a succesful choir which eventually performs in front of high-ranking French government officials.

This is a very warm and touching movie about kindness and humanity. I do have some criticisms, however. Firstly, I find it unlikely a choir would be succesful amongst boys in that age group (early teens). Something more along the lines of a sports team would've been more realistic yet equally effective.

Also, I don't think leniency and kindness are necessarily the right answer when instilling discipline. I was a resident assistant during my university days and have had to deal with discipline issues on many occasions. If you are too kind and lenient, people will often take advantage of you and this policy won't necessarily make them like you more, which is not the message of the movie.",1132876800,2,1774,4.906666666666666

And, of course, it shows how a good, fair man can change the lives of even the most difficult pupils.

It ends in a manner that, if not exactly uplifting, is a proper conclusion for the teacher, for the administrator, and for one of the more heartbreaking of the young boys.",1130371200,5,581,4.514285714285714
1113575,5,7502596496,"There have been multiple movies about teachers and two with music. I would classify this as the best among them. It shows how to deal with the subject without overplaying it and thus destroying the subject. This shows the person who is a musician taking the job as a prefect in a reformatory school and slowly bringing out the students using music. The beauty is in how simple the theme is and how well it is played out, showing all kinds of students and teachers. The basic logic is that music does not pay except for some of the best or the luckiest. The rest of them become teachers or choose other professions. The music is well directed and wonderfully acted by the lead actor Gerard Jugnot. Unlike other movies, the end is realistic with the teacher getting fired and moving to another place. Having seen the Vienna Boys Choir, this movie captured my heart. The spirit of the movie is in the way to capture the mind and the hearts of the boys. While there are some violent parts, for the most part it was a lovely movie which I enjoyed. It had humour, spirit, understanding and forgiveness done beautifully. The ending was simple and elegant.

I would like to mention that it it not like Mr Holland's Opus or like Dead Poets Society. Robin Williams cannot play the part of the teacher, he is one of the persons who plays the same role in all his movies and overplays his part. Mr Holland's Opus has an unlikely end with all of his former students giving him a farewell. The music is also not as beautiful. The minute I saw this movie, I decided to buy it, there have been very few movies in the last few years that have created this sensation in me. The transfer is important in this movie and the audio and video has been well done. The video showed up well in my wide screen TV. The dolby digital 5.1 also comes through very well with the songs which broke my heart. I would recommend all to buy this movie.",1128556800,20,1915,4.379213483146067

It is a deceptively simple movie that grows more and more wonderful.  I greatly enjoyed the actors, and the music.

An eventually heartwarming story of a failed teacher become  prefect at a horrible French boys' school for ""difficult boys"" who changes their world for the better. For two of them it's a permanent change.

Fond L'etang, which means bottom of the swamp/mire, is aptly named.  The headmaster is a martinet, short on tolerance, and quick to seize another's glory.

While some of the scenes are very disturbing, enough so that I did not share this movie with the daughter in question, the movie  captivates.

My only quibbles are these: 1) Having sung with symphony choruses for over ten years, ""the world renowned conductor"" at the beginning of the movie CANNOT conduct.  The music was not ""in his hands"" at all!  (The actor who plays M. Clement, the teacher who runs the chorus, can conduct quite well.)

2) I used to be fluent in French.  I would have greatly enjoyed the option of having French subtitles.  We can have English subtitles in English-speaking films, why not French subtitles in French-speaking films?

1113579,5,7502596496,"As a certified choral music teacher, I want to add my $.02 regarding this film.

I, personally, very much enjoyed it. It illustrated extremely well the positive effects of music in students' lives (discipline problems minimizing, self-confidence rising, and just making a child happy to find an activity they enjoy pursuing). Watching Mathieu conduct the first set of choral warm-ups as well as teaching Morhange proper posture made me smile, as these are familiar teaching tools to choral directors.

What made this different from a film like ""Mr. Holland's Opus"" is that the movie didn't end with a large concert attended by an audience of supportive,crying parents/students in honor of Mr. Mathieu. In ""The Chorus,"" Mr. Mathieu was fired from his job and went on to teach music privately for the remainder of his life. The cheesy, typical American style which would have the film end with a swelling orchestral score as the aforementioned concert audience stand to cheer/cry with joy would certainly evoke an immediate emotional response. However, this is an example of Hollywood being Hollywood. It's impossible to NOT get emotional when Mr. Holland hears his orchestral composition performed for the first time at a retirement concert in his honor. Hell, I got verklempt seeing that. But, sadly, it simply doesn't happen that way. ""The Chorus"" illustrates this well with it's unpretentious take on the life of a struggling musician trying to make it as a teacher.

The following is what happens to a large majority of vocal music professionals with big aspirations - they end up teaching full/part-time in a college/university setting, a school system, or give private lessons in a very humble manner, occasionally finding a chance to compose a small work for a local event and/or sing in a local opera/choir/musical/etc., without any fanfare. Those who DO go on to perform professionally almost ALWAYS say, ""Well, I wouldn't be able to do this without working as a teacher/professor. That's where all professional singers start."" These people teach for years, often touching the lives of students in countless numbers of ways, then retire to live a simple, quiet life. He/she will get a 'Thank You' from a few students and maybe some parents, but beyond that, not much else. For most, as they look back on their careers, they are generally happy to have had opportunities to teach young people the magic of music as well as feel that magic themselves as the occasional performer/composer.

Music teachers can also identify with some situations in this film. Who could forget when Mondain was hauled away and Mathieu leans out the window and says, ""...but he was my only baritone."" As much as Mathieu despised this ill-behaved hellion, he was, in fact, his only baritone for the choir, leaving Mathieu somewhat disappointed when he left.

Also, the attitude regarding music in the eyes of some school administrators (i.e. Mr. Rachin in the case of the film) should not be foreign to many music educators. The music program is deemed completely unimportant and unnecessary UNTIL it is noticed as a success and a delight - only then does the administrator praise and announce his 100% support for the music program - and, of course, claim the program as his brainchild.

I wish I could show this in a classroom. There are, however, a few crude scenes which make this impossible.

If there were options to use half-stars in this review, I'd give it 4.5 out of 5 stars, only because the film as a whole began to slow a bit towards the last 1/3 of the film. I found myself losing focus as the month of May rolled around in the film.

To comment on what another member said regarding the music skills coming about too fast. Do remember that this film takes place over several months, with progress not seen until the Spring. This is not atypical and not unusual at all. With an inspiring, determined teacher and daily rehearsals that include implementations/consistent enforcing of 'good singing habits' (all of which the boys had in the film), true quality can be seen over a span of a few months. The progress of the boys singing skills in the film was, therefore NOT so unrealistic.

In my opinion, every music educator should see this film - especially if one is in the choral music field. It is inspirational without being pretentious and, well shmaltzy. It's a much more true-to-life portrayal of the ups and downs of a music teacher with hopes of something bigger. Those not in the music field who are perhaps used to over-the-top portrayals such as ""Mr. Holland's Opus"" may not find themselves giving the film a standing ovation.",1127174400,14,4636,4.910600255427842

  The music is suberbe in this story, and the storyline is mainly quite realistic.  The movie offers a real hope and truly shows the transformative power of music.  This movie is worthwhile for anybody who appreciates music and anybody who wants something more then mindless entertainment.

The movie deals with the not-so-new theme of education in 1949 Europe: traditional exaggerated discipine versus love, and the importance of trust. The new part: the fullfilment of a man's frustrated musical dreams through the conduction of a boy's chorus.

  The music?? Ah!! The music is so exquisite, it brings tears to your eyes. I bought the soundtrack as well and listen to it all the time, further appreciating the significance of the lyrics. The boy's voces are beautiful, as so are each and everyone of the characters. What differentiates this film from others which deal with the same theme (such as Mr Holland's Opus) is the director's excellence at making each and every one of the characters authentic and absolutely real. In the purest European cinematic tradition this movie deals with an ordinary theme making it extraordinary by means of excellent acting, casting and simplicity of plot: French cinema at its best!

G&eacute;rard Jugnot plays Cl&eacute;ment Mathieu, a vagabond of sorts who jumps from job to job, never doing well in any of them. Somehow, he gets hired in a reform school for boys as the prefect. Within minutes, the boys challenge him and his authority, as they are used to be treated poorly by the adminstrator Rachin. Truly wanting to help the boys, Mathieu uses humor and song to reach the crowd, and in doing so, beings to transform the boys, particularly two that need him the most.

Whereas the film may be somewhat predictable and the story seemingly covered in Sister Act II (which this film resembles nothing of the sort!), it is still wonderfully rich and charming. The acting is superb, as our hero looks nothing like the traditional skinny, blond superstars that often pervade these types of films. The music is haunting and beautiful; who can resist the orchestrations of a boy's choir? And the film never panders to sentiment, nor is there a long build up to the conclusion.

Just like anoth maybe less know 'noir' films 'The Man on the Train' this film was an absolute pleasure to watch .... and watch it you will ... as Yoda would say ... because the viewer has absolutely NO IDEA as to where the story is going....

No it's not American style like 'School of Rock' where we feel all tingly at the happy happy joy joy epiphany type ending .... this movie stands by itself as a fabulous depiction of life and times in a reformatory school run by people who have more hang ups than hooks in an Ace hardware store .... and have lost their actual humanity quite some time ago ...

So the great thing about this book is also it's weakness ... do NOT expect orchestras and a DVD of wonderful choir singing to equalt the Vianna Boys Choir .. but rather expect a very very poignant story you will stop when you get that beer from the fridge ....",1121990400,3,1094,4.25
1113620,5,7502596496,"This, potentially sad, French import, turned out to be one of the most joyous celebrations of life to hit cinema in a while.  Set in Fond de l'Etang, a dreary boarding school for troubled boys in 1949 France a sense of hopeless claustrophobia pervades the air.  Enter Clement Mathieu, (an absolutely remarkable performance by Grard Jugnot that had me literally cheering) the school's new Prefect, a lonely, middle aged failed musician who narrates the story through his journal, and life will never be the same.  An unlikely Mary Poppins, his effect on the students is lifechanging as he fights for less punishments and more socially rehabilitative activities for the ruffians in his charge.  Eventually, he forms these troubled kids into ""The Chorus"" and the sound of beautiful music brightens the dank halls of Fond de l'Etang, changing the place forever.

Inspired by his students, Mathieu's own rehabilitation - a restoration to the world of music, an occurrence of which he never dreamt - is as inspirational as any other aspect of this beautiful tale.  He reaches into his soul and begins composing new music.  In his journal he writes of how the boys may not understand the depth of what's occurring, but ""inspired by them, I compose, each day, for them.""

There is a sense of realism to ""The Chorus"" which shows not all of these misfits can be saved, and deception, hostility and disrespect, though seemingly diminished, never completely disappear.  A potentially down beat ending reinforces that reality, but does not diminish one once of the sense of amazing joy this movie leaves you with.

Sure, this film doesn't go into unknown territory, there have been plenty of tales about a teacher and bad kids who learn from each other about the beauty and importance of life and learning. But this movie puts a more special, personal, and beautiful touch to the surroundings, the characters, and most of all, the music! The end nearly made me cry.

Mathieu somehow manages to stay cheerful, although the boys disrespect him and the headmaster wants a sidekick who can share his belief in harsh discipline.  Hearing the boys singing off-key, Mathieu decides to start a chorus.  And he discovers that one boy has a rare talent.

The chorus doesn't transform anyone. The boys are still boys. But they enjoy the chorus and respond, grudgingly, to their new prefect's relaxed oversight

Chorus seems more poignant than Mr Holland's opus.  There's no simple fairy tale ending and things do not always turn out right.  In fact, there's a bittersweet irony when Morhange seems unable to acknowledge the huge debt he owes Mathieu.

The characters are multidimensional. As the film progresses, we gain insights into the headmaster's character and also an understanding of Mathieu's colleagues. The boys are shown even-handedly.

In my view, what makes the film special is the realism of the post-war setting and the location in rural France, accessible by an infrequent bus service.  The scenes seemed bathed in a sunset haze. Watching was like turning the pages of a very old book, a little crumbly around the ages but still readable.",1118707200,3,1381,5.017543859649122

1113649,5,7502596496,"LES CHORISTES (THE CHORUS) is director Christophe Berratier's first foray into the realm of full-length films and his adaptation of the 1945 film LA CAGE AUX ROSSINGNOLS written by Georges Chaperot and Ren&eacute; Wheeler serves to introduce his talents as a master storyteller well.  This tale of how music can alter the lives of even most renegade of boys is warm, sensitive, and satisfying on every level.

The story opens with the reunion of two men who were classmates at Fond de l'Etang, a boarding school for troubled boys in France in 1949.  Pepinot (Didier Flammand) arrives at the door of consummate symphony conductor Pierre Morhange (Jacques Perrin) with a journal written by their beloved teacher Clement Mathieu , now dead, and the two read the journal, recalling their shared childhood experiences at Fond de l'Etang.

1949 and the Fond de l'Etang is a dreary jail-like, rundown place run by the cruel disciplinarian headmaster Rachin (Franois Berl&eacute;and).  Cl&eacute;ment Mathieu (G&eacute;rard Jugnot) is an older, bald, failed musician who seeks employment as a prefect in the school and immediately is forced to confront the rigors of the school's harsh discipline with the still flagrantly wild boys.  Mathieu slowly wins the confidence of his boys by standing up to the cruel Rachin and when he is near his wits' end as to how to transform his class, he hears a boy sing and decides to use his musical talent to change these boys' lives.  Two of the chief problem children are the angry but vocally gifted Pierre Morhange (Jean-Baptiste Maunier) and Leclerc (Th&eacute;odul Carr&eacute;-Cassaigne) and Mathieu coaxes them into the inner circle of his newly developing chorus.  The other child who is without talent but for whom Mathieu empathizes when the child waits every Saturday for someone to claim him at the gates is Pepinot (Maxence Perrin) who Mathieu assigns as his assistant chorus master!

Through a series of incidents including the cruelty of Rachin, the appearance of Violette Morhange (Pierre's poor working mother who cannot afford to feed him), the success of the chorus in the eyes of the Countess (Carol Weiss) who acts as benefactor to the school, and  some evil doings of the more difficult children, Mathieu's Chorus becomes a symbol for how problem children can bond in mutual need to the enrichment music provides.  Rachin cannot tolerate Mathieu's success and fires him without allowing him to say a farewell to his beloved choristers.  The manner in which this is portrayed is most touching and spiritually enriching and serves to resolve the mystery of Mathieu's departure to the adult Morhange and Pepinot as they finish the journal.

Simple story, told before, but superbly acted and performed.  The music is by Jean-Philippe Rameau with original songs by director Barratier and Bruno Coulais, all beautifully sung by Les Petits Chanteurs de Saint-Marc with young actor Jean-Baptiste Maunier singing his own solos.  The cinematography is in the capable hands of Jean-Jacques Bouhon, Dominique Gentil, and Carlo Varini.  In French with English subtitles. Highly recommended little jewel of a film!

1113650,5,7502596496,"'The Chorus' became a huge hit in France in 2004, and there's a good reason for that.  Despite some obvious flaws, the film is moving and uplifting as any good music is, and anyone who likes films like 'Dead Poets Society' will surely love this one too.

The theme of the film is nothing new, but quite universal.  A middle-aged music teacher Matthew is sent to a school.  The setting is post-war France, and we find the educational environment there is worse than Matthew expected -- the pupils are rebellious and the headmaster is strict.  To adjust to the new situation, Matthew, himself a failed musician, thinks of organizing the kids into a chorus group.

That's it, and the story of the film is certainly predictable.  The boys at first make a fool of the new teacher, and then starts to listen, revealing their brilliant singing voices.  Among them, one handsome and quiet boy Morhange (newcomer Jean-Baptiste Maunier who really sings here) turns out the best singer, who is given the solo part.

The film (written and directed by first-timer Christophe Barratier) goes smooth, and for some critics, goes too smoothly.  In fact, some accused the film of being too sentimental.  Maybe so.  But I for one think that the film is made with honest heart, with humanities enough to convince the sincerity of the filmmakers and actors.  Sentimental or not, what really counts is good acting, good story, good characters, and good music.  And the good music is as moving as the story itself.  What else do you want?

Jacques Perrin appears as grown-up Morhange (in the same way he did in 'Cinema Paradiso'), and he is also one of the producers of the film.  The little boy 'Pepinot' (waiting for Saturdays to come) is played by Maxence Perrin, his real-life son.  The chorus part is supplied by Les Petits Chanteurs de Saint-Marc.

So you want to see a good film?  Here's the one for you.  I don't say it's perfect.  But I can assure you that you will be won over and immensely moved in the end.",1114992000,3,1995,4.656160458452722

I watched it (cried it) the first time a week ago and I've seen it 3 more times since that. Yes, as a choral conductor  I've witnessed, I've promoted  I`ve seen the miracle of choral music doing what many other aspects of ""education"" just can't do today. Why would that be? It may sound harsh, but many schools and many fields of ""education"" have turned into plain business all around, just preocupied with ""manufacturing"" consumers for the market world, as John Holt once said, no matter how this is acieved. Obviously, we're talking here about 1949: the post war times of this story, we all know,  were very hard, sick with so many missconceptions about ""discipline"" and ""order"". But this globalized times with new nazis like Mr. Bush, Blair or Berlusconi are not so different. Children feel all that violence and , deep within them, they resent it. Art, on the contrary,  and choral music in particular, was then and still is now  a deep language of the soul and no kid is alien to it as long as a true artist helps him discover it. This is obviously, the very foundation behind Europe's old and solid choral culture. So, this is what Mr. Mathew does with this group of lonely and abandoned kids so abused by the hard, stupid ways of Mr. Rachin. They come to discover their true souls through the power of music. As an artist, Mr Mathew knows this and goes for it with love and faith.

The story is beautifully put to screen, somehow reminding us of the classic films by Truffaut. The Saint Marc kids chorus is an A-1 group with a lovely head voice sound and, not only Rameaus piece, but all selections by Bruno Coulais are lovely.

It goes without saying that as a musician I'm really pleased to know that today's kids may have a chance of enjoying a film such as this one. Our actual choristers will remain with us, strongly motivated. And we may receive new ones!

For me, this film is all about the music.

As a semi-pro singer who started in children's choirs I wanted to see if they got choral music right. I purchased the soundtrack first, while waiting for the film to hit town. I was entranced! It had the typical music (Latin and French choral pieces) that you'd expect of choruses good enough to record, but the arrangements were fresh - the 'In Memoriam' is certainly not your typical 'Kyrie'. And who would have expected to hear a pretty, simple children's tune (Compere Guilleri),  set so beautifully? I wanted more! So I headed to the cinema, half expecting that the cast would be pretty Hollywood (French-style) children lip-synching to  a soundtrack. Not so! The music was right on. The kids appeared to be really singing even though I know they had to be singing to pre-recorded music. The soloist in the movie is the soloist on the recording. Even the adult Morange was acceptable at the orchestral conducting.

Story? Plot? I didn't care. I liked seeing kid singers as I know them to be - little angels when singing, totally kids when not.

1113676,3,7502596496,"""The Chorus"" is a nice little movie about one man's, Clement Mathieu (Gerard Jugnot) attempts to bring some culture, music, art and a touch of civility to a group of young, ruffian boys in post war France, circa 1949.

There is nothing particularly profound in what director Christophe Barratier has to say except: treat people with respect and they will, in turn, act in a respectful manner; which is important, particularly for children but not especially earth-shaking.

""The Chorus"" verges on the maudlin and the overly sanctimonious at times but Barratier manages to stay clear of jumping off the cliff onto sentimentality.

What is most interesting about this film is that France chose to enter it in the Oscar Best Foreign Film race. With so many (particularly ""Intimate Strangers"" and ""Feux Rouges"") notable films made in France in 2004, why this film?

1113678,5,7502596496,"""Fond de l'Etang"", France, 1949. Data with no meaning for you right now, but that has a lot to do with this movie. What does that data mean?. Well, it is the place and time that set the background for this wonderful story.

The country is France, and the date 1949, some years after the end of the Second World War. ""Fond de l'Etang"" is a strict school for troubled children, mostly orphans who have lost their parents in the war. They live more or less unhappy lives, wanting to play outside but forbidden to do so. They express themselves only through rebellious acts, to which the harsh director of the school responds on the basis of the principle ""action-reaction"". Unfortunately, that principle doesn't solve things...

One day, the arrival of a new preceptor disturbs the school's routine. He is Clement Mathieu (Grard Jugnot), a frustrated musician that has arrived to this school only after having failed at a variety of jobs, and who isn't overly excited at the prospect of having to deal with a bunch of unruly kids. Things don't start well, due to the fact that the students don't respect him, and that he doesn't agree with the director's ""educational"" methods. However, one day Mathieu listens the children singing out of tune, and realises that he can teach them to sing well. As he does so, trust begins to build between them, and the students start to face life in a different way...

Clement Mathieu  kept a journal during the time he was at ""Fond de l'Etang"", and it is throughout his words that we are allowed to ""watch"" what happened. The films begins when one of Mathieu's previous pupils at ""Fond de l'Etang"" returns to his home due to the death of his mother. The man, now a famous music conductor, receives after the funeral the journal of his teacher, and begins to read it.

This story doesn't seem to be overly special, but the film certainly is so. I cannot explain exactly why... Maybe the reason is that the director (Christophe Barratier) is very good, or that all the actors play their roles beautifully. Another important element that makes this a noteworthy film is, of course, the enchanting music that plays throughout the movie. Anyway, I think that you should just go to see ""The Chorus"" right now (if you can, run), and find your own reasons to love it  :)
