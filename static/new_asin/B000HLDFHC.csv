2638921,1,B000HLDFHC,"Ha!  Now I read the reviews and thought, this cant be all that bad, wrong, the kids were sneaky, rude and had bad mouths, this movie turned into an example of HOW NOT TO BEHAVE instead of a nice Christmas movie.  It was purchased for my 3 year old son.  We watched it once and threw it out!",1361404800,,290,3.9655172413793105
2638922,5,B000HLDFHC,"We have two boys who thoroughly enjoy this short movie.  We first saw it on Netflix, but it eventually was taken off.  Then Amazon had this for a great price and the kids again found it very entertaining to watch.  I guess this is becoming a holiday tradition for our family and at an affordable price.",1358726400,,302,4.357142857142857
2638923,5,B000HLDFHC,This is a great Christmas movie for kids especially if they like the idea of having a pet dinosaur. We watch it all year round because my son wants a pet dinosaur!,1354665600,,163,4.125
2638924,1,B000HLDFHC,"My 4 year old son received this movie for Christmas. It is awful - the children are very direspectful to each other and to their parents. It' full of sarcasm and negative messages about Christmas, graitude and family life.  I have thrown this dvd away.",1311897600,2,252,4.6

8140287,5,B000HLDFHC,"Had purchased this DVD for our son when he was younger and he loved it, but it got lost in the move. Found it on Amazon and had to replace. Great movie for any child who is a Dinosaur enthusiast.",1506038400,,195,3.9
8140288,2,B000HLDFHC,This is SUCH a negative movie. The brothers are mean to each other and very insulting as well as the parents.,1501113600,,109,4.238095238095238
8140289,5,B000HLDFHC,"My son is 4 1/2.  He wanted ""dinosaur christmas"" and found this on amazon.  He loves it!",1452124800,,88,4.117647058823529
8140290,3,B000HLDFHC,"2 1/2 stars it's an okay  storyline but kids make fun of eachother calling each other ""spaz"" and other words and parents say some things that are surprising.  They expect their kids hate each other and they do until they get a dinosaur and then work together to hid it from their parents.  So kind of not so good. They finally do share but almost because they have to not because they think it is the right thing to do.  There is no violence just language.",1436054400,,456,4.267441860465116
8140291,5,B000HLDFHC,"At first I was worried by the attitude of the main character, but as the story progressed, the baby dinosaur softened him up a bit and made him kinder to his little brother.  This is a good moral for our household. Plus, it's a dinosaur Christmas movie and with little boys it's difficult to go wrong with that.",1420848000,,311,4.362068965517241
8140292,5,B000HLDFHC,This is a great Christmas movie. The animation is much slower so you really concentrate on the movie. My whole family enjoyed this movie.,1419897600,,137,4.75

8140295,5,B000HLDFHC,"My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and highly recommend this. The interaction between the two boys of differing ages is realistic and reminds me of my brothers and sister, as well as when we ""tried"" to pull a fast one on our parents. The story brings the two boys together and illustrates the importance of family.",1418515200,,324,4.603448275862069
