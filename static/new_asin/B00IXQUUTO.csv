6304346,5,B00IXQUUTO,"We very much enjoyed watching this film, which I know to have been a labor of love. It is a very personal story, told from the heart, about one mans journey towards himself, and a renewed encounter with his faith. The scenery is beautifully shot and the music score quite lovely. The struggles of the journey, the camaraderie of pilgrims, the kindness of strangers, the individual stories and reflections of different pilgrims they all brought back memories of our pilgrimages. For those contemplating such a journey, and for those who have been, this is a lovely film to go back to over and again.

6304347,3,B00IXQUUTO,"This is a short personal travelogue and the director/narrator's sincerity and inquisitiveness and the lovely photography kept me interested.  However if you want to watch just one film about the Camino you might be better off with ""Walking the Camino: Six Ways to Santiago"".",1426896000,,274,5.2272727272727275

6304349,5,B00IXQUUTO,"I highly recommend this video to anyone who is thinking about walking the Camino de Santiago, or is merely fascinated by the Camino pilgrimage walk itself, or is curious about the type of people who set out on this 800 km journey. If you would love to experience the quest yourself, but can't, ""Are You a Pilgrim?"" allows you to enjoy it with Gian Ceccato. He does an excellent job!  What's so special about this documentary? It is the story of Gian's own personal journey and endurance on the Camino, the interesting people that he met along the way, and how this special journey changed his life. Complimenti Gian per una bella presentazione!  As for me, this uplifting video inspired me even more.....to walk the Way this coming September of 2015.",1426723200,,750,4.717557251908397
6304350,5,B00IXQUUTO,Heartwarming video about one pilgrim's journey and the people he met along the way.  It is an honest assessment and very uplifting as Mr. Ceccato found his way back to his Catholic roots.,1421884800,,187,4.666666666666667
6304351,5,B00IXQUUTO,"I watch anything I can find on the Camino de Santiago.  I loved this presentation.  It was lovely how he showed ""his"" Camino and captured the stories of other pilgrims.  He also took time to capture some of the local people and they were so warm and lovely.  Thank you Gian for your beautiful presentation.  Other than ""The Way"" this movie will be one I will watch and watch as I prepare for my own journey.",1409616000,3,407,4.302631578947368

6304375,5,B00IXQUUTO,"I've watched this film with a fellow pilgrim, after my third Camino de Santiago. I have the luck to know most of the places where the film is done and every time it's an amazing feeling. The scenes are genuine and I felt a very sweet warmth, while thinking of the inner path that the director had necessarily experienced while walking. I personally liked the final product, it's a very nice picture of the experience of the pilgrimage. I'd advice it to anyone willing to know more about it or to relive the atmosphere of that magical path.",1456963200,,539,4.510204081632653

6304381,3,B00IXQUUTO,The movie was ok.  It did not give a good idea of what it was ti hike the Camino de Santiago.  You Tube videos are much better.,1429574400,,127,3.6666666666666665
6304382,5,B00IXQUUTO,"I was priviledged to see the theatrical screening of the film a months ago. I completed the camino  in September 2013, walking from St Jean Pied de Port to Santiago. I felt I was walking alongside the ""Pilgrim."" The Director and Protagonist managed to capture the essence of the Camino, evoking the emotions I felt so strongly along The Way.  I experienced those emotions again seeing the movie, and cried tears of joy with the memories.
So many people have asked me about my Camino and It is sometimes difficult to communicate the experience to them. It was wonderful to share this film with my local community and share my thoughts, feelings and experiences with them.",1429401600,2,670,4.767241379310345
6304383,5,B00IXQUUTO,"I was priviledged to attend the ' Australian Premier' of ""Are you a Pilgrim?"" this evening. I completed the camino  in September 2013, walking from St Jean Pied de Port to Santiago. The director have managed to capture the essence of the Camino, evoking the emotions I felt so strongly along The Way.  I experienced those emotions again tonight, and cried tears of joy with the memories.

8646219,4,B00IXQUUTO,"Excellent portrayal of why people do the Camino as opposed to how to do it. Having completed two Camino routes myself, I was still in awe of Ceccato's ability to undertake it and make a film at the same time, which added many kilometres to his pilgrimage. His commitment and dedication was evident throughout. We paid close attention to the credits confirming that this was a genuine passion project, practically a one man project, and an excellent one it was. Bravo!

A comment re Amazon: I have been wanting to watch this for a long time and was unable to rent it through Amazon Canada. Tried when in the US and couldn't, as my credit card didn't have a US billing address. Purchased a US Amazon gift card and was unable to use it for the same reason. This year, in the US, a visitor rented it for us. BTW, this is a movie that originated in Canada.",1485216000,,851,4.386075949367089
8646220,5,B00IXQUUTO,I have watched this documentary numerous times because I enjoy it so much.  Gian Ceccato's motivations for walking the Camino were very similar to my own and his experience mirrors my own to a great extent.  I thought he did a good job of capturing the different motivations that pilgrims have when walking the Camino and kudos to him for sharing his own story of repentance.  The song Ultreya Va is a beautiful piece of music and we plan to use it for an upcoming pilgrimage that we are planning.,1481500800,,497,4.5

8646222,5,B00IXQUUTO,This short documentary captured the essence of the Camino beautifully.  Thank you for bringing my Camino alive again.,1465516800,,117,5.5
8646223,4,B00IXQUUTO,"It was one of the better one I've seen  on the El camino de Santiago . For me like how this film forces on the spiritual/ religious, and second half of life aspect. And how Gian in the film struggle with  his relationship  with God and the mystery of life ,but don't  we all? Most the folks he interview was in the second half of life ,that was refreshing to see! And it give it depth.
Why I did not give it five stars  because cinematography and editing .",1462665600,,456,4.078651685393258
8646224,5,B00IXQUUTO,"I thoroughly enjoyed this very personal film about a man who is seeking a renewed connection with his God. At the age of 71, where he recently lost his brother and has two sisters who are not physically able to undertake such a challenge; he embraced it. It left me wanting to know much more about the man and his Camino. I feel there is so much more that could be shared with those of us who have yet to walk the pilgrims walk. Thank you for sharing your story with us Mr. Ceccato. God bless.",1458086400,,493,4.145833333333333
