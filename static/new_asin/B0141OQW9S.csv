8729312,5,B0141OQW9S,"These aren't five-star movies, but this is definitely a five-star DVD set.  Both of the films are vintage mid-1960's Albert Zugsmith exploitation pictures that were screened at the adult ""art"" theaters of the day.  Both films center on troubled characters submitting to psychobabble with Dr. Lee Gladden, in order to understand their darkest desires.  Lots of flashbacks are employed to portray the uninhibited activities of the characters.  By today's standards, these films would probably be rated either PG-13 or R.  However, in the mid-sixties, these pictures were strictly for no one under 21.

Both films are presented on this disc with the ""hot"" (read: topless) variations of certain scenes.  Additionally, the ""clothed"" alternate versions of those same scenes are available as extras.  Since these films have been mastered from the original 35MM camera negatives, the image quality is generally excellent.

Neither of these movies has been publically exhibited since the mid-1960's, so this DVD serves as a superb restoration of these thought-lost films.  Baby-boomers may recall the lurid ads that used to run in ""family"" newspapers for these pictures.  However, the movies remained tantalizing out of reach, due to the ""No one under 21"" restrictions.",1444089600,5,1260,5.410256410256411
