8728661,5,B013RZBG7K,"Professor Vickery's passionate, personal storytelling is engaging and perfectly illustrated with well chosen stories of the period. Like her other excellent documentaries, including The Story of Women and Art, the pace, scholarship, reference to original sources, ambiance of the places in which events occurred and production values place this among the best of modern documentaries. I found myself reflecting on current events many times while watching this. Although much of the content is disturbing, the theme is one of optimism and a sense of empowerment.",1474848000,,561,5.6117647058823525
8728662,5,B013RZBG7K,"THE STORY OF WOMEN AND POWER is a BBC television three-part documentary written and presented by historian Amanda Vickery (THE STORY OF WOMEN AND ART), who teaches early modern history at Queen Mary University of London; shes an award-winning author who also reviews for The Guardian and BBC Radio. In this history, she considers the centuries-long struggle of women for their political and sexual equality.  Suffragists, as I prefer to call these brave women who struggled with society, their families, their husbands, rather than the more common, cutesy term suffragettes, endured many challenges in their fight for women's political influence. For many centuries, women were owned as chattel by their fathers/brothers/husbands, had no right to their own lands, money, children.  In this sweeping, often shocking series, Vickery tells the untold story of British women's battles in the centuries-old war of women vs. men.

This illuminating documentary features the stories of some of the most notable women in British history. Vickery profiles key figures including Mary Wollstonecraft, the mother of feminism; Hannah More, who found ways for women to enter public life; suffragist  leader Emmeline Pankhurst; Queen Victoria, who had progressive views on womens rights. She discusses the tragedy of a suffragist who apparently committed suicide on the race course at the Epsom Derby, longtime social highlight of the year. She enlightens us on Margaret Thatcher, who , decades ago, served as the first female Prime Minister in the U.K. The historian shows us a museum piece, a frightening torture device for women deemed scolds by their husbands, which would restrict their ability to speak. She visits the Houses of Parliament, Queen Victoria's holiday home, and a livestock market where men once sold their wives at auction. (She tells us that ,over the years,  there are at least 300 documented cases of men selling their wives). And she converses frankly with other experts, among them current Member of Parliament Stella Creasy and the son of Nancy Astor, the first female member of parliament (MP).

Vickery guides us through history, from an early march for women's rights in 1649 to a notorious incident in 1738, when the Duchess of Queensberry crashed the House of Lords, to the militant activities of the Edwardian suffragists, the modern-day campaigns that remind us the fight is not yet over. The DVD release coincides with the upcoming release of the new film SUFFRAGETTE that stars three-time Oscar winner Meryl Streep as Emmeline Pankhurst, Cary Mulligan and Helena Bonham Carter. The presenter does limit herself to Great Britain, which I found a pity: Id have preferred information on parallel developments on the continent of Europe, and here in the United States.  Nevertheless,  the narrative is richly told; footage found, travel to places of unusual interest made across the country.  And the documentary has resonance beyond the British Isles. It also has subtitles, thank goodness, as Vickery moves and speaks swiftly. The boxed set , which I received as a review copy, consists of one single DVD, containing three episodes running approximately 180 mins. A lively, accurate, engaged history lesson that might open some eyes.",1445472000,,3252,5.286821705426356
8728663,5,B013RZBG7K,"It is UK women, but this documentary relates to women all over the globe. The movement lingers in continuing threads of needed areas in the contemporary world. This DVD series shows the past through archival film footage, fine arts, photos, artifacts, historic cartoons, interviews with historical experts at historic sites, present day tours, research, and all manner of documentation of the suffragette struggle. Presenter Amanda Vickery (I also own her DVD series on The Story of Women and Art) is great and makes this documentary lively, fun, and educational. Womens rights are for the world.
