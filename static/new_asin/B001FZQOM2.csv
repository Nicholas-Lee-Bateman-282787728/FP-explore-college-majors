8303155,4,B001FZQOM2,"Queen Elizabeth II celebrated her golden jubilee in style at Buckingham Palace in London, England with family, friends and thousands of British subjects at sunset into the night. Sir Michael Parkinson, British television personality, was master of ceremonies. Sir Andrew Davis was conductor. Sir Thomas Allen was singer. Dame Kiri Te Kanawa was soprano. Sir Anton Dolin choreographed a dance from ""Swan Lake."" The event was classic in style and presentation. There was the London Seventh Day Adventist Chorale there as well perhaps my favorite part of the ceremony.

The best and most memorable part of the concert was towards the end. When the orchestra played ""Pomp and Circumstance,"" the audience sang along to that song and ""God Save The Queen."" You can't expect anything else but class and style. Thousands of Brits were there in the audience. The concert began at sunset and finished after two hours. There was great joy all around. Sometimes I see ""The Pomp and Circumstance"" and ""Jerusalem"" performed the classic arts showcase channel. There are also plenty of archive footage of the Queen and her mother as well.

There are no special features though for the DVD.",1520726400,,1172,5.067357512953368
8303156,1,B001FZQOM2,I thought this was Dr Who at the prom. This turned out to be at the prom for the Queen. Another example of bait and switch. I got no help from customer service,1494028800,,159,3.8484848484848486

8303158,5,B001FZQOM2,"Once upon a time, when I was young, madly in love, and just married, I lived in London with my then student husband in a ""cold flat"" and wondered if Buckingham had central heating.

Well this performance is centrally heated with great pictures, great voices and great views of some of the Queen's chambers. Best seat in the house at the best price and with the best quick delivery service.  We're lucky to have it on DVD.  Britishly recommended.",1394064000,2,445,4.6075949367088604
8303159,5,B001FZQOM2,"I remember watching this on TV during Her Majesty's Golden Jubilee and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Unfortunately my VHS tape had deteriorated and it took me awhile before I could find the DVD of it.
I watched it again the other day and it's still fantastic.",1244160000,4,254,4.543478260869565
