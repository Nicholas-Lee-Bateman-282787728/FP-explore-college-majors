8023053,3,B00027350I,"I enjoyed this DVD disc of early scifi.  The stories are interesting and the acting is above par.  If you like science fiction with F/X don't bother.
This collection is mostly good stories and good acting.  Recommended for people who like good storytelling in the early days of TV.",1201824000,,281,4.6938775510204085
8023054,4,B00027350I,"TALES OF TOMORROW was an early science fiction TV show. The eighty-four 30 minute episodes of this series that aired on ABC-TV featured both current and future stars.

""Frankenstein"" is a pared-down rendering of the classic Mary Shelley novel with Lon Chaney Jr. as the ill-fated monster. ""The Crystal Egg"" is based on an H.G. Wells story. Character actor Thomas Mitchell (STAGECOACH and IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE) has a supporting role here. ""Appointment on Mars"" shows Leslie Nielson at the beginning of his long career. In 1956, Nielson would star in the sci-fi classic, FORBIDDEN PLANET.

This DVD is a fine introduction to the Tales of Tomorrow series.

8023055,3,B00027350I,"This 3 episode DVD gives a good idea of what science-fiction and fantasy film-makers were doing for television in the early 1950's.  The acting is somewhat stiff, and the sets/props must have been left from other shows, but you can see the style and ideas come through.  Look for Leslie Nielson in a ""serious"" role as the commander of a commercial mission to Mars. For the serious fan/collector, this is a good addition, but not necessarily a good buy for an average viewer.",1087171200,5,474,4.698795180722891
