5915103,5,B00EI3X9Z8,When will the rest of the series be issued.  I enjoyed Diagnosis Murder when it was originally on television.  I love watching them.  These are my types of programs.,1381536000,,165,4.620689655172414

5915105,5,B00EI3X9Z8,"A wonderful heart warming and intelligent detective series, light years away from the modern preoccupation with cold, dark characters and crewel, sinister and often violent plots.  If you enjoy seeing the best of humanity dealing with the adversities and selfishness that life can throw at one from time to time, then this is the series to watch.  Intelligent, uplifting and highly engaging.",1381190400,4,391,5.290322580645161

5915107,5,B00EI3X9Z8,"Diagnosis Murder is my favorite show!!! I grew up watching it in the 1990s, This show has great drama and comedy in it. Dick Van Dyke is a true gem. Normally I complain when seasons are broken up, but in this case i could care less. I ordered both volumes, season four is my favorite season. ""Murder Two"" is my favorite episode, I watched it when it was on TV. I heard Sometime they were going to release the complete series, but I couldn't wait!",1378080000,4,446,4.258823529411765
5915108,4,B00EI3X9Z8,"May I just say that I am so unbelievably excited to finally see more of this wonderful show being released on DVD.  The four stars from me reflects the annoyance of having part 1 and part 2 to buy instead of just letting us buy the who darn season.  I know that's not Amazon's fault but gotta complain anyway. I hear there's a complete series coming too but I haven't decided yet if I'll be going in on that.  I guess it depends on whether they'll release 6-8 separately too.

Season 4 definitely had some of my favorite episodes of the series, including Murder Can Be Contagious and Murder in the Family.",1376870400,11,605,4.375
5915109,5,B00EI3X9Z8,I have been waiting for this for so long. This is one of my favorite seasons. I watched them  a few months ago on encore and the stories are great. It has taken so long for us to get these. I hope to see the rest soon.,1376870400,10,218,3.6382978723404253
5915110,5,B00EI3X9Z8,"This series was a complete surprise seeing Dick Van Dyke in this character as a doctor/sleuth and having some of his real life children in the series. His son, a regular and at times his brother and sister or were they his other son and daughter.

5915124,5,B00EI3X9Z8,"Dick Van Dike is provably able to make the phone book interesting to read, in this series, however, an M.D. consultant to the L.A. Police Department, makes for a most entertaining series, whodunnit par de excellence",1385424000,,215,5.0

8605464,4,B00EI3X9Z8,"Season four, part one, in which the intrepid doctors solve various crimes, some more serious than others.  They also wasted an episode on a pilot for a TV series that never saw the light of day.  They were literally special guest stars on their own series, barely seen in an episode called An Explosive Murder, starring Tracey Gold and Eric McCormack as a rich guy with nothing better to do than make bombs.  It was not a welcomed addition to the series.  They had a habit of doing this throughout the run of Diagnosis Murder.  This was the fault of Fred Silverman who insisted they waste precious time on promoting doomed projects.

Otherwise, this series was getting progressively better with each season.",1510444800,,707,4.754098360655738
