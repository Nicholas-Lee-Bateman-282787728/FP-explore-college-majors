However, it is cool to see where everything that happens in the American version is portrayed in the British version. One can definately see where things come from.",1331856000,,287,4.538461538461538
4588055,3,B0056G1APC,"It can never be said enough how amazing and ground-breaking it was to watch this show when it first appeared.

Having scored bootled vhs copies of the show (vh-what?) and then going out to buy the region 2 definitive collection, obviously have a soft spot in my heart for this amazing show.  Imagine my surprise when I originally tuned in and heard the most amazing music blaring from every radio, club scene, and car stereo during each episode.  Literally was ready to pack my bags and head off to this wunderland that I was SURE had to be waiting for me if i JUST decided to take that chance (how Vince)!

Sadly, something seems to have been lost in translation at some point and almost ALL of the amazing ""of the moment"" tracks from the late '90s/early '00s britpop heyday have been replaced with generic (substandard, imo) club-thumping instrumentals that wouldn't be played in the worst gay dives.  It seems like the ONLY music they kept were for tracks that are tied into specific moments (like a music video on tv, the drag performance at vince's birthday, etc.) which gives you just a TASTE of what the original was chok-a-block full of.

Not sure if this occurred before or after the definitive collection rerelease overseas, but be warned, you'll never know how good you could have had it unless and until you track down original broadcasts of this show.

as for this release, to quote young nathan, ""what are you LIKE?""",1321833600,19,1430,4.673306772908367
4588056,4,B0056G1APC,"Great series. The DVD has lots of deleted scenes which is good and overall i really enjoyed it. My only problem was that they edited the soundtrack and some of the scenes. It wasn't major changes but i had seen the original version before this so i caught them. The worst changes they made were not playing sexy boy and raining men. This really bothered me because these songs were well known to the QAF uk fans. But overall if you love the series and you don't have a regional dvd player to play the original british dvd's purchase this version, the show is still a grate show to own.",1317772800,9,585,4.327272727272727
4588057,4,B0056G1APC,"While the U.K. original of Queer As Folk is far superior to the American remake in my opinion, be warned that this DVD set containes major editing changes from what aired (and was sold on DVD) in the U.K.  Some of the sex is trimmed just a bit here and there, but even worse, almost all of the music had to be changed due to copyright issues that are different in the United States.  Unfortunately, a big part of the original charm of the series was the dramatic club music showcased so well that they spawned a couple of hit albums.  The terrific original songs are gone and have been replaced by inferior generic music due to rights issues (it would have cost too much in royalties so they just replaced the music).  This DVD set is pretty much identical to the one that was put out here in America by C1TV a few years ago.",1316995200,69,825,4.269230769230769
4588058,5,B0056G1APC,"Using a pun on  the Yorkshire phrase, ""There's nought queer as folk"" -- similar to the Pennsylvania Dutch saying ""All the world is queer [odd] except me and thee, and sometimes I think thee is a little queer, also."" -- Russell T Davies caused a ruckus in the U.K. overnight with the first episode of his Queer as Folk when an unapologetic, inexperienced, under-the-age-of-consent, gay youth (Charlie Hunnam) finds his way to Canal Street in working-class Manchester -- the equivalent of Christopher Street in NYC -- and charms a predatory gay Lothario (Aidan Gillan) into taking him home for some of the most graphic gay sex ever seen on the telly. Over six original episodes the audience became transfixed by the nuances of gay and lesbian culture unknown to most. Davies went on to resurrect the modern Doctor Who and penned its offshoot, Torchwood, set in his native Cardiff, Wales, with a bisexual hero, Capt. Jack Harkness (John Barrowman).

Season two was limited to only two episodes and ends with the U.K. guys in their Jeep CJ literally, magically transported to the American West as it became known that there would be a U.S. version of QAF to be based in working-class Pittsburgh (but filmed in Canada) on Showtime. (Good as the lengthy U.S. series was, it did not star an underaged schoolboy and lacked the edge of the Davies show.) Also, Hunnam seemed to be wearing a wig in season two which was not becoming.

The U.K. series was originally shown in the U.S., and DVDs distributed at high prices, by a small, gay cable network, making it inaccessible to most. Some of us with multi-region players ordered the box set from the U.K. Like the Robin of Sherwood series, Acorn Media has done the U.S. audience a great service bringing another great, five-star BBC series to the U.S., even if belatedly.",1312848000,12,1811,4.779552715654952
4588059,5,B0056G1APC,"In December, 2000 television's Showtime network debut the very first hour long drama that dealt with homosexual issues in a blunt but tasteful fassion. That show was called ""Queer as Folk"" and ran for a successful five seasons and aired 83 episodes. What many don't know is that the series was actually based on a British series, also called ""Queer as Folk"", but that was more like a mini-series because it only ran for 8 episodes back in 1999 and then it returned to UK television for 2 more episodes so the writers could wrap things up.

 Now the Russell T. Davies' original series comes back to DVD in a complete series set featuring all 10 shows plus a slew of bonuses on 3 dics. What's amazing about the UK series is how closely the writers and producers of the American version followed the plots of the original during its first year on the air. While watching you will have no trouble believing who Brian was based on or Michael for that matter. My only problem with the British version is the dialect, but that passes within moments of the first show.

 The bonuses include deleted and extended scenes with commentary, a featurette, interviews, trailers, and a 20 page booklet written by Davies. The episodes here are presented in their beautiful widescreen presentation, have english stereo sound, and english subtitles are included.

 Anyone who ever watched the American version needs to watch how it all began with this amazing DVD box set. ""The New York Times"" calls the show, ""Compelling!"".",1309824000,22,1505,4.769230769230769

When one finds a favorite movie has been put out by Criterion, a sense of joy prevails;  you know the transfer will be top notch, everything restored.  I'm finding that is far from the case with Acorn Media, and the sad thing is, from ""Tales Of The City"" to ""Queer As Folk"" UK, Acorn seems to be the one buying up rights and issuing the DVDs.

I'd just as soon do without.  With content editing from the original, and the UK DVD versions; and with music cut out, this is an inferior product.  I returned my ""Tales of The City"" copies and demanded a refund (and got one).  I rented this through Netflix, and I'm glad I didn't buy it.  Unless a credible company can be found to treat the better Gay TV miniseries the way Criterion treats the classics, it's going to be a long time until I get to see any program they've issued from start to finish via binge viewing.

4588080,4,B0056G1APC,"I can't get away from comparing this to the US incarnation of the show since I had watched that first. A lot of the initial plot points are the same. We have Nathan on his first night in the scene and managing to attract the attention of the older and much more confident Stuart. There's the mad scramble to the hospital to be there for the birth of Stuart's son born out of his sperm donated to lesbian friends. And all that cool stuff. But at the same time things are pretty different.

I'm going to break my usual rule on comparing different adaptations of a work to one another since it's the easiest way for me to contextualize my experience of watching this show given how much of my gay life had been shaped by the US version of the show. There was the eerie feeling of things being out of phase or something like that despite familiar plot points and character personalities. And as you get through things, it'll be worth the overall pseudo strangeness of it all.

Biggest shift - the drama is in the right place. The stories are focused, rather plot-driven with decent development for our three protagonists. This is not a larger ensemble piece that the US sort of became over time - they kept the cast pretty focused in that regard. And when I say the drama is in the right place, I mean that they don't have to much filler drama going on.

Nathan as the young gay man isn't as annoying as his US counterpart. Sure, he still makes stupid decisions and he's prone to through little tantrums here and there. But he learns the rules of the street soon enough and he doesn't spend all of his time pining over Stuart. After getting burned a few times, he learns to become his own man, and that's great. And I bring this up right off the bat since the Brian-Justin relationship in the US QAF was one of the more annoying plots that became horribly central to the show.

And yes, he was the lead in Pacific Rim. Totally.

Stuart is still a self-assured, arrogant, and manipulative man who can get practically whatever he wants. At times the extent of his influence can be pretty scary, but we learn to understand a bit of why he is the way he is in the show. Plus there's actual merit to his way of dealing with the world, as evidenced by those odd instances with other friends approach Stuart for help with one delicate piece of business or another. At the end of the day he gets things done.

But the real clever dynamic exists between Stuart and Vince and their odd friendship / almost-romance. We all know that Vince clearly pines for the guy but contents himself with just being around for him almost all the time. And we also see that Stuart is clearly dependent on Vince as well given he's the first person that he calls whenever there's a spot of trouble.

I appreciated how the show took things to their more logical (and sometimes dire) resolutions based on the events. It's not all that depressing, but it also doesn't tint your view of their world with shades and blinders. Instead we have a rather practical, matter-of-fact representation of their lives and a good taste of what they're experiencing.

And in the language of the show, the ending was ""a little bit camp"", but it still worked for the whole narrative.

Queer as Folk has a great story, and one that is the start of this series more than anything else. If you want more pointless drama, you can go back to the US version if that's more to your tastes.",1404777600,5,3430,4.423137876386688

4588086,4,B0056G1APC,"Set in Manchester it showed on BBC 4 in England. The first surprise is that it lasted only a two seasons. Having watched the version shot in Toronto, Canada that lasted 6 full seasons I was a bit disappointed having missed the part about it being only three disks.

The series covers a lot of the same territory as it's American mirror but the action is much telescoped lacking a great deal of the exposition given in the subsequent edition. The Lesbians have the baby Stuart fathered in the first half hour. Vince is his faithful side-kick who works in a grocery store and lives with a Mother who affirms his lifestyle choices and has a male boarder/friend. Charlie Hunnam plays teenage Nathan Stuart's young stalker who is still in highschool or 6th Form and has a faithful female friend. Charlie is just growing into the stunningly handsome hunk he will become in later years.

Vince has a female employee who has an eye for him. He is not `out' at work. Stuart drives a company car, a Jeep which is vandalized by young homophobes. The nature of Stuart's executive position is not immediately apparent. It rapidly becomes apparent that the American version picked up a lot of the same themes but enjoyed the luxury of giving them much greater development. All the characters we see live the same promiscuous gay lifestyle shown in the American Version. They engage in heavy petting and man on man action complete with foreplay. The British Midlands lingo takes some getting used to.

I watched this because I wanted to see the series that inspired the American Edition. This is no show for homophobes or rednecks but if you can get by the explicit sex in the end `Folk' is about 29-year-olds coping with settling down, making commitments, and getting on with their lives.",1383868800,5,1774,4.716129032258064

The character that debbie was based on was played by an actress entirely too young to play his mother and because of that I found it totally unbelievable.  Stuarts suppose to be some irresistible sex pot who has alot of money but yet he had bad teeth.  I prefer the american version hands down.

It gives the viewer the impression that is was written at the last minute and was basically a patch job. Hence, the ending ruined the quality of the show.

4588098,4,B0056G1APC,"Long time no see, often a great way to get a second look at someone, or something from a fresh better informed perspective.  In Queer As Folk: The Complete U.K. Collection, the drama, the shock factor, and the in your face message it delivered has lost none of its effectiveness in the intervening years.  If anything it has gained a sense of historical placement in our common cultural  experience.  That is to say the shock now is less the open exploding of sexuality, more the underlying emotional roller coaster of interpersonal conflicts between the diverse characters.  One sees people one knows. We are all there in smaller or larger ways, being drama queens, the gay population no more than the straight population.
The writing continues to grip the imagination, the directing to surprise despite knowing what is coming, and the acting is less histrionic than the daily effluvia of News Media analysts.
In fact my respect for the actors who took on these roles has increased. They stepped out and answered the challenge and gave us a picture of humanity seething with life and quandary, that ultimately is heartening.

One wishes the production team had been able to develop the series more fully in the British context. It feels truncated. The American series, while taking the story further, was a totally different tale with its own targeted themes.  The British story shows a different side of gay life, and economics, that feels truer to life. However, better it was made at all, and is sufficient as it is to remind new generations that there is  strength in the human heart, and love, passion, imagination, determination.

On a technical note, the DVD menus on the set we received did not access the sections of the series.  There appeared to be a software editing flaw built into them, making it irritating to play each episode.
