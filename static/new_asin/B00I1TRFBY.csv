6247206,5,B00I1TRFBY,"I have had the great fortune to have been privately trained by Michelle.

Now that she has developed this amazing DVD any and everyone can have access to her within the comfort of their home. She will motivate you, encourage you, strengthen your core, and give the body you've always wanted.  No Excuses Pilates Beginners/Intermediate Workout is the best gift you can give to your body.

6247207,5,B00I1TRFBY,"I'm so excited about the release of this DVD.  I have traveled the world and never met an instructor that I've loved as much as Michelle.  I'm a professional athlete and trained in all areas of fitness (weight training, yoga, bikram, acrobatics you name it!)  Never in my life have I felt stronger than after training with Michelle.  She not only makes you dig deeper into your potential, but does it in a way that makes you understand your muscles so that you can think about exactly how you're activating and using them.  Ladies... I know we all have those hard to reach areas and there is no such thing as target toning,  but I will say I noticed a huge difference in my hips after taking this class for a few weeks.  I built my muscles up quickly which helped me burn more calories and building long lean muscles so when I started to lose some of that fat I had nice strong muscles underneath to show for it.  This is one instructor that I wish I could pack up and take on the road with me and now I can!! Don't miss this opportunity to get in the shape you've dreamed of!! Have fun and thank you Michelle!",1391558400,4,1110,4.252380952380952
6247208,5,B00I1TRFBY,"Michelle is the BEST!  I have been practicing with her for 2 years and don't ever want to stop.  The results from her workouts are amazing.

6247209,5,B00I1TRFBY,"Michelle is the Best ""Effective"" Pilates teacher  I've ever had. Her DVD will really motivate you. I have learned from her that Pilates strengthens the abdominal muscles known as the ""Powerhouse"" .
Myself I wanted to strengthen, lengthen an sculpt my muscles .
I found Pilates to increase my body awareness, feel stronger and more energized, centered and physically confident than ever before.

6247213,4,B00I1TRFBY,"Her explanation is great, and the workout is easy enough that it's great for my ""rest days"".  Just wish it was longer!  I have to supplement with my own stuff when she's done.  My reason for giving it 4 stars is because it doesn't come in a regular DVD jacket- Just an open-ended cardboard holder.  It had bounced around in the box when shipping and it's a wonder it hadn't slipped out and busted.",1465084800,,397,4.324324324324325
6247214,5,B00I1TRFBY,"Michelle's instruction is top notch! She motivates you to do your best. I am new to pilates and found this workout quite challenging, yet appropriately so. It's a fun and rewarding workout that left me wanting to come back for more. A+",1461715200,,235,4.619047619047619
6247215,5,B00I1TRFBY,"Although it has been a while since I have done Pilates, I found this video challenging but not overly intense.  I usually do the beginning/intermediate program although there is a condensed version for those that do not have enough time to do the 30 min video.  Michelle does a very good job of describing the moves, the breathing and the techniques.  I would highly recommend this video for a novice or a refresher course for someone more skilled in Pilates.",1458345600,3,459,4.7125

8638335,1,B00I1TRFBY,"This DVD came scratched up and out of the DVD sleeve. I can't even watch it, so kinda pointless and I've messaged about it with no response so I'm out the money I paid.",1498176000,,168,3.9705882352941178
8638336,5,B00I1TRFBY,"This DVD is so valuable - Michelle N. Leach's workouts are short and so effective that there is no dread factor  there are indeed NO EXCUSES here, and I find that I do these workouts regularly on days when I do not have a Pliates class. I find Ms. Leach's instruction very clear, energizing, and encouraging. I am so glad these workouts are available on DVD for us who do not live in the area where she teaches.",1495670400,,411,4.269230769230769

8638338,5,B00I1TRFBY,"I love this DVD. The workout is challenging and doable, approximately 30 minutes. Michelle appears relaxed and does not have the plastered phony smile that I so often see in workout DVDs. She gently nudges and coaches in a very authentic and appealing manner. I really like that she does not urge you to fit into skinny jeans.  Would definitely recommend and if you need more motivation, watch the Amazon movie, Embrace!",1490140800,2,420,4.833333333333333
