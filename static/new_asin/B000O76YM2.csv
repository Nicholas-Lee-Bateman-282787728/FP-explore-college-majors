The guys were superb on stage fronted by Nick Barret, and not to mention the return of Rick Carter on keyboards. The production was excellent. A must see for progressive rock funs, especially if you like melodic tracks.",1188777600,3,303,4.62962962962963

A great concert, if you like prog rock you'll love it.
Timeless music and a great band with some old musicians, a worthy buy for a collector of good music.
Buy it and support this magnificent band.",1184630400,4,202,4.342105263157895
