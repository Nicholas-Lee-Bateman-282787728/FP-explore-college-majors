It was interesting anyway, but not really what I was expecting.",1377561600,,186,4.636363636363637
8348179,1,B001YV50XG,"As other reviewers have noted, the picture and sound quality of this DVD are utter crap - but then what would you expect from Televista, one of the premier bootleggers of unauthorized/unlicensed discs? Why Amazon keeps letting this egregious pirate keep selling stuff on this site as if it were legit product is beyond me. BAN ALL TELEVISTA (and Jef Films) releases, Amazon!",1293840000,9,374,4.9523809523809526
8348180,1,B001YV50XG,"I don't enjoy posting negative reviews, but if you don't like the cover art for this DVD release, be advised that the actual transfer looks even worse.  Aside from being badly faded, and aside from being poorly panned-and-scanned from the original widescreen, the print is so dark that you can hardly see anyone's faces.  It's often difficult to see what is occuring, or whom is speaking.  I'll admit that I had never seen the actual movie before, but surely there must be a better print somewhere.  I'm quite tolerant of less-than-perfect prints of rare films, but this one is very hard to watch, and even harder to enjoy.  Big disappointment.",1244592000,12,644,4.818181818181818
8348181,4,B001YV50XG,"This motorcycle western hybrid features impressive wide-angled cinematography, which i was able to appreciate even though the now ancient video i own is a pan and scan monstrosity.
  Features genuinely sympathetic characters, not the two dimensional stereotypes i am used to in such biker films of this nature, and a wonderful opening song, which serves as the film's entire score.
  Yes this is an ultra low budget film, but one that is full of inventive imagery and off beat, but likeable characters. The U.K band The Jesus and Mary Chain took the most striking of these images as the artwork for one of their singles, which is where the film first came to my attention. Not surprising as the director is also Scottish.
  There is a quiet goodness to these motorcycle protagonists, (nicely realised by the subtle underplay of the actors) juxtaposed double crossing authority figures, who are addicted and corrupted by their power, just as the outlaws are liberated by their addiction to freedom. I find this movie haunting and enigmatic, shows off the rugged beauty of the Mexican / American countryside.
Certainly makes my all time biker movie top ten.

Please Televista put some love into this release it really does deserve it.

Oh dear the box art is not good, why didn't they use the crucifiction shot from the movie as it appeared on the old VHS tape and Jesus and Mary Chain single, which would have helped greatly in selling this cult obscurity, fire the marketing people. Just hope this turns out to be a decent transfer or it won't be worth the price, as is unlikely to contain any extras.

Glad I cancelled my pre-order as the new review confirms my worst fears, what a shame this interesting movie deserved so much better, knock off 3 stars for such a lazy transfer. Amazon won't let me change my score.",1238198400,6,1817,4.761146496815287
