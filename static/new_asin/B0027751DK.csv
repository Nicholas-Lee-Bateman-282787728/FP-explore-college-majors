3862571,1,B0027751DK,"I rented this movie and within ten minutes wish that Amazon had a cancel this order button . I found the film disjointed, silly, confusing, and all around not worthy of a watch. It could have been connected into some kind of coherent story but there seemed to be no desire or effort to do so. What was the clown all about? For that matter what was the entire thing about? Would I recommend it to a friend? Not if I wanted to keep their friendship.",1429833600,3,447,4.209302325581396

3862573,5,B0027751DK,"DEVIL GIRL is the story of Fay (Jessica Graham), her '69 Chavelle, and the eeevil, psychopathic clown (Joe Wanjai Ross) who haunts her. Fay is also haunted by the memory of her dead father. When her car breaks down near a small, hick town in Texas, Fay tries to get a job as a bartender (The clown stole her money), but can only find work as a stripper. Fay's adventure includes run-ins w/ a sleazy preacher, a scumbag motel manager, and the DEVIL GIRL (Vanessa Kay) herself! Yep, she's red, she's hot, and she's got horns and a tail! She also drives a wicked T-Bird! The story is fairly non-linear. There's a definite psychedelic / dream-like / hallucinatory effect and atmosphere. The clown is hilarious! He has the best lines in the movie. If you enjoy fast cars, drug-crazed killer clowns, or bodacious red gals, then you have just found Paradise!...",1395532800,3,854,4.662251655629139
3862574,4,B0027751DK,"Years ago, I was lucky enough to catch the premier of this film.

You ever love a movie that most people do not? Apparently history has put me in such a place. After all of this time I still enjoy this flawed gem. Yes, there are things this first time group of filmmakers could have done different or better, but that can be said for pretty much every movie ever made.

I know from experience that not everyone plugs into this mile-a-minute movie, but I sure did. In fact, the filmmakers found my original review for DEVIL GIRL online at Feo Amante's Horror Thriller, and put my blurb right on the cover of this DVD!

So yeah, this movie holds a special place in my heart. If you are a gearhead and into fast cars and the whole custom car show ethos, you may wind up wowed yourself. Fast and Furious fans take note: This one might have slipped right past you.",1390435200,5,859,4.290123456790123

3862576,1,B0027751DK,"I'm not going to pretend that I purchased this film because I like avant- garde' cinema, because I don't.  I purchased it because I like Vanessa Kay from ""The Man Show"" who plays the titular (get it!) role of ""Devil Girl"".  Now, if she happens to be in a great movie, well, that's a plus.  That was just not the case.  The entire cast couldn't act its way out of a snuff film.  The story is pedantic and frequently makes absolutely no sense.  There is not a single likeable or redeemable character from beginning to end.  The dialogue is simply painful.  Most of the time you are left asking yourself two questions, ""What the..."" and, ""Who talks like that?""  The cinematography isn't awful, but is that why you want to watch a film, because it ""isn't awful""?  I guess this movie has a certain Mystery Science Theatre quality to it, in that it deserves to be lampooned and verbally eviscerated.  All in all, save your money and your time.  I still like Vanessa Kay, and I hope one day she finds her vehicle, this isn't it.  The rest of the cast and crew should seriously rethink their career paths.",1296691200,5,1097,4.452261306532663

This is not the best of all time or the best B-rated of all time. What it was, was fun. I can't explain it better than fun. I enjoy when crazy stuff is happening, even if I don't understand why. This movie is not some artistic film that shows how flawed humans are. We know we are flawed. This movie is full of flawed people. The clown guy was the most maniacal of them all. Half the time I didn't know what the hell he was rambling on about, but I didn't care. It was funny and fun to watch. This is not a movie for the powder puff horror genre.

drug-induced dreamlike quality to most of it, but there was a neat ""O. Henry"" twist at the end that left me feeling like ""Yeah, Cool, I can dig it"".

  Definitely not for the kids, but this has the quality to become a cult classic. Some nice old Detroit muscle cars included: Chevelles, T-Birds, etc.
And yes, Devil Girl was hot, in more ways than one! I took off one star for the excessive heavy-handed small town fire-and-brimstone preaching scenes - was annoying and a lot of it could have been left out. But I saw at the end why they felt like it was necessary. Amazon has some real

I was so bored to tears I had to stop it a couple of times to do other things.  For me, I'd have to say, this isn't even worth a one time viewing.  Very limited nipular content, more teasing than anything else.  Save your money.",1433376000,,396,4.090909090909091

8354269,4,B0027751DK,"The movie was made in 2007, but looks it is from the 70's. It is a little crazy and actually intense at time. Forget trying to logically follow it, after a few flashbacks all is lost. There are all kinds of perverts, crazies, super-naturals and even has a nonsensical BDSM scene just to keep the confusion up. It rates a 2/5 on the T&A scale.",1524873600,,342,4.276923076923077
