1997958,4,B0001GF2JM,"I can't say I was expecting much from the final Magnificent Seven movie, but with Lee Van Cleef in it, I had to check it out. Of course, nothing matches the first film, but this one is better than Return of the Seven, which I thought had a weak premise. ""Ride"", however, begins a bit weak, but once Chris gets on the trail, its an absorbing story that will leave some sweat on your palms. The usual ""Seven"" situation is given a twist by making it a village of women to be defended against further rapine and the way that Van Cleef must ensure the allegiance of his current allies. The current crew does not have the charisma of the original Seven except for Van Cleef, Michael Callan, and Luke Askew. Askew's character is fun to watch, since he is the ultimate test of Van Cleef's leadership. This makes the ending both appropriate and humorous. Van Cleef's method of tactical dispersal of the women is ingenious and helps give some definition to some of the characters. Overall, I was impressed by how small a budget it must have taken to make this film and yet it's an effective, enjoyable movie.",1128384000,12,1098,4.495
1997959,3,B0001GF2JM,"MGM is now releasing all their movies in widescreen ( which is good )but they are not ANIMORPHIC (Enhanched for widescreen T.V.'s.) Previous releases were animorphic so this doesn't make any sense. I can only assume there is a new guy at MGM and he is an idiot! The president is completely unaware of what's going on which makes him the same. Other recent DVD's are ""Follow That Dream"" and ""Shalako"". If this is unacceptable send MGM an email.",1087171200,6,443,4.620253164556962
1997960,5,B0001GF2JM,"I grew up with the original THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN (1960) to the extent that it became an integral part of my youth. I greeted RETURN OF THE SEVEN (1966) with open arms and grew to endear GUNS OF THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN (1968). I first saw THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN RIDE! in 1972 on its initial theatrical release. In many ways it brakes away from the story line formula established by its three predecessors and in some ways is a disappointment.
The character of Chris, the leader of the seven now portrayed by Lee Van Cleef, is a complete departure from that established by Yul Brynner in THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN and again in RETURN OF THE SEVEN. Instead of a noble gunslinger that skirts the law, Lee Van Cleef's Chris is a cynical lawman who shoots first and asks questions latter. We see Van Cleef reluctant to help an old friend (Ralph Waite) who desperately needs his aid. Van Cleef's Chris is even happily married (to Mariette Hartley) as opposed to Brynner's Chris who was the immitigable stoic yet virtuous loner.
Much of the plot also goes against formula except for the conflict and climax which ultimately has the seven going up against seemingly insurmountable odds from yet another bandit leader. The earlier part of the film has lawman Chris pursued by journalist Noah Forbes (Michael Callan) who is bent on making him a legendary Western hero in print. It also deals with Chris avenging the murder and ravaging of his wife by a pair of young thugs (Gary Busey and Hank Allan). Gradually the film falls into the formula of the seven coming to the rescue of the downtrodden once again. Interestingly, the film once again breaks formula when Chris recruits the seven. After signing on journalist Forbes, we get shades of THE DIRTY DOZEN when Chris goes to the territorial prison to recruit five inmates to round out the seven. These men are portrayed by Ed Lauter, Luke Askew, James B. Sikking, Pedro Armendariz Jr. and Bill Lucking.
The film's budget looks terribly feeble in comparison to its three predecessors. It looks like a ""back lot"" production. Even Elmer Bernstein's score has lost its majestic quality. The orchestra sounds as if it were manned far below that of a standard size symphony, which can not be blamed on Bernstein if that's what the budget allowed. Some of the film's strong points are its witty dialog, an excellent performance by Luke Askew and the preparation and defense of the village by the seven.
THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN RIDE! seems much less like the fourth film in a movie series but rather a half-hearted effort to turn out one more story that may have looked more effective on television than on the big screen. The presence of Stefanie Powers as the love interest even seems to reinforce this impression. In some ways THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN RIDE! is an appropriate end to this quartet of films. It was really a reflection of the times. It represented an end of an era when the Western once rode tall in the saddle of the silver screen. By 1972 that era was sadly coming to an end. Looking back with affection I am now glad that Lee Van Cleef, a true veteran of the Western, ended this one on a note of endearing optimism. The spirit of those magnificent seven men will always live in our hearts.",1081987200,27,3232,4.671929824561404

1997978,5,B0001GF2JM,Lee Van Cleef has the lead role as Chris in this Magnificent Seven saga. The story line is similar yet different. Chris has settled down ( married ) and is the Sheriff of a small town. A bank robbery and abduction of his wife sends him chasing the bad guys. He finds and kills the culprits but runs into a bunch of damsels in distress. Long story short he must save them from Mexican bandidos. How he does this is why I said similar but different. You'll have to buy this DVD if you want to know the answer. Worth buying if you're a fan of the Magnificent Seven Trilogy.,1447286400,,570,4.1909090909090905

His voice is amazing as well although he doesn't need it to get his point across. Too bad he didn't star in the fiirst
film. He would have been superior to Brynner, who was totally out of place with his accent and had nowhere near the presence of Van Cleef.

1997988,5,B0001GF2JM,"This is A GREAT and underrated western. To me Lee Van Cleef is more believeable as a gunfighter than Yul Bryner was in the first two. Yul was a Russian born actor playing an American gunfighter where as Lee is American born. I LOVE the scene where Lee Van Cleef serves JUSTICE to the outlaws who robbed a store and took Lee's wife hostage. Your brother for what he did(Rape and kill Lee's wife) and you for what you did not do.(You did not watch,but you did not help her)There is also a good moral lesson about punishment for your crimes. A mother pleads to Lee Van Cleef(Marshall Chris Adams) about her son going to prison for a crime he committed,he is just a boy who meant no harm. Lee Van Cleef tells her how her son's crime affected a RESPONSIBLE STORE OWNER.Marshall Adams lets him go free but a couple scenes later the son(Shelly is his name) goes in with two brothers to rob a store and take Marshall Adam's wife hostage. Another aspect of this movie that I like is how Lee Van Cleef employs STRATEGY TO DEFEAT the bandits at the end. Watch this movie and enjoy it. This in my opinion is a GREAT MAGNIFICIENT SEVEN sequel,whereas in my opinion THE RETURN OF THE SEVEN IS THE WORST.",1414886400,,1189,4.36036036036036

1998003,3,B0001GF2JM,"Being a Spaghetti Western fanatic, this movie does not stand out as exemplary or even outstanding - it isn't a Spaghetti Western but rather a Hollywood movie within the genre of westerns.  Without Lee Van Cleef in the lead, the movie wouldn't be worth anything.  The theme of the story is a familiar and well used one particularly in the Western and war movie genres.  A Marshall recruits a gang of incarcerated criminals to take on a vicious, notorious gang who are terrorizing the area and in particular a village composed (naturally) of women.  The now iconic theme music was responsible for this movie being touted as ""one of the best"".  For Western movie collectors, this movie really cannot be omitted, but it certainly isn't one of the best.",1404432000,,748,4.767441860465116

1998007,3,B0001GF2JM,"This action tale of seven supremely competent fighters fighting against overwhelming odds in Mexico around 1900 is exciting at its end part, when the seven are fighting against the Mexican bandits who killed all the men in a small town, but it is not exciting throughout and fails to follow the formula established by the former films about the seven. Van Cleef plays a cynical marshal who has no problem taking advantage of people to secure his own ends. He is totally unlike the more likable Yul Brynner who played the role in the first film. Most significantly, unlike the former film, we are unable to really identify and like all of the seven, at most two or three.",1343520000,2,670,4.638655462184874

1998009,2,B0001GF2JM,"It's OK to have a low budget, and to try to make something worthwhile out of it, within your alloted humble scope. Unfortunately, scrimping on a director was not a good decision in this undertaking. They needed an old pro who knows how to work fast and get decent shots that flow, have meaning, allow the actors to present a character etc. Inept staging of scenes leave the cast floundering over and over. Statues standing and saying lines, over and over. Many look grim in their scenes simply because they know the captain of the ship doesn't know what he is doing...and this film will be a mess. There is a good cast, and the skeleton of a good story...but a good recipe does not make a good cook.",1271376000,3,699,4.426356589147287

1998011,2,B0001GF2JM,"More of a cold spaghetti western (as they are called) than a true sequel to the American western original.  Lee Van Cleef is found in other 'spaghetti westerns' like The Good the Bad and the Ugly with dubbed English translations over the Italian.  This film is a lot of action with limited character development and amiable characters like Ronaldo the loner who in the original gets 'adopted' by a couple of the village boys only to die in their arms later.

Good action, but personally I liked it less knowing that it was somewhat cold and not very true to the original.",1203292800,,571,4.578431372549019
1998012,4,B0001GF2JM,"This is a brand new 7 doing their number or so the poster said. According to the United Artists Pressbook this is not a true sequel to the three preceding films. Instead it is a tale of a brand new Seven rooted to themes and traditions that the earlier films embraced. That same United Artists Pressbook also pointed out that this film contained a very original and innovative story while not abandoning the thematic idea of seven gunmen coming to the rescue of the downtrodden. Chris is the main character of this film and the entire story revolves around him rather than the seven as a cohesive force. Chris, portrayed by a very engaging Lee Van Cleef, is an ex-gunman turned town marshal and now married. Where all three previous films opened with a protracted conflict affecting the lives of poor Mexican farmers, this film has no apparent immediate danger that would draw Chris into and away from his current lifestyle. Needless to say, that changes dramatically. This film really caries no formula recognizable from THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN but approaches the conflict with a bandit hoard quite differently. The conflict, the motivations and the stakes are all different. This film lacks the grandeur or depth of its predecessors and plays out acts of violence for effect rather than substance. Elmer Bernstein apparently assembled a much smaller orchestra perhaps feeling a need to bid farewell to the Seven with a whimper rather than imply some majestic idealism as the sun was setting fast on day of the Western.",1165363200,7,1518,4.910505836575876
