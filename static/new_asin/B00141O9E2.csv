8254005,4,B00141O9E2,"Moving documentary about a raped 9 year old Nicaraguan girl who gets pregnant, and the social (church mostly) forces brought against
the poor family to stop them from getting Rosita an abortion, even though having a baby at her age would put her life in serious danger.

Although the story is interesting, and can't help but be affecting, and there are nice touches (e.g. animating the unseen Rosita's drawings)
it doesn't go as far as I wish it did into the way the church controls people's lives, or what it means to be poor in Central America, or
any of the fascinating issues touched on, but never really explored.

This is a case where short running time (about 55 minutes) actually works against the film.",1346716800,,711,4.68
