3789834,1,B001TH37N0,"If you are seeking to learn more about the Vietnam War do not trust the enclosed booklet and materials.  For example on p. 18 (discussing the My Lai Massacare):  No insurgents were found that morning, but that did not stop U.S. Marines, led by Lt. William Calley, from beginning the systematic torture, rape and execution of hundreds of women, children, babies and elderly.""  News flash--the Marine Corps was not involved in My Lai in any way.  Do not buy this product.",1289433600,3,469,4.753086419753086
3789835,3,B001TH37N0,"Ed Rasen did it again. And gave us another Vietnam war low budget documentary, after the well put together collection ""We were Heroes"" and the not so good ""Secrets of the Vietnam war"". What do we get with ""Fighting Forces Vietnam""? The vital statistics are such: 11 (eleven!) hours film on five DVDs, about 95 percent of them original footage, handsome metal box, booklet with photos and VN war chronology.
Ed Rasen presents the military units and outfits which participated in the vn war. Mostly if not exclusively he relies on features from ""The Big Picture"" and seemingly from newsreel which seem to have been put together back then for a military audience. Since most of the Big Picture features presented here have ben available in numerous othre editions, the newsreel segments are the real finds in this collection. And they sure make You hope that Ed Rasen descends into the movie vaults again to unearth some more of it. The technical quality varies, but mostly it is mediocre which of course is mostly due to the condition of the original material. All things considered it is a 3 out of 5 because at a price like this there is not much You can do wrong",1247270400,4,1163,4.650485436893204

8341307,2,B001TH37N0,"A friend, at least I thought he was a friend, loaned the dvd set to me and the best part is I didn't waste my money. Edward Rasen made too many asinine comments to ever be believable. There is probably 20 minutes of good footage or at least enough to raise from a 1 star to a 2 star rating, and the rest is just like the Army training films you had to watch in basic. Don't bother.",1489449600,,381,3.8974358974358974
8341308,2,B001TH37N0,"I like good military history (written, verbal or video) when I can get it.  Unfortunately this is NOT it.
Let me make my own position clear before reviewing this product.  I did not serve in Vietnam.  I was
of draft age, I was called up for the pre-induction physical, found fit to serve, was in ""the lottery"" and had
a number low enough that I was supposed to be drafted.  I fully expected to be, but was not.  I believe to
this day that had I been sent there I would have died there.  I also felt that the war was a terrible mistake
and one which we hadn't learned well enough to avoid some of the same mistakes in
the Middle East, ""Vietnam in the Sand"" as it was ironically called and in fact, came to be.

It is not possible to support a government half the world away, which does not have the support of its
own people, against a very determined and persistent enemy.  Eventually such a government will
collapse and all that an outside power can do is forestall the inevitable--perhaps indefinitely, but at
great cost.  Anyhow, back to this product.  [By the bye, the only reason I can figure for why I did not
get sent to Vietnam was that the Paris peace talks were making progress and then the military essentially
stopped inducting more draftees, and began sending troops out of country.  And there must have been
a large pool of eligible candidates in my area in the meantime, during the months when they still were
drafting.  One of those flukes of fate that sometimes you never do quite understand.

This was ""written"" and produced by Edward Rasen, who at one time was a LRRP team leader and later,
in civilian life a producer for ABC news.  But no major news organization would have sponsored a product
this bad.  This he obviously did on his own.

More than 75% of some 12 hours is actually US military propaganda.  By that I mean it seems to have been
produced by the armed services primarily for consumption by our own troops, to convince them that they
were fighting for something both noble and winnable.  I grew awfully tired of the same grave yet enthusiastic
voices proclaiming how well everything was going despite inevitable difficulties.  Listening to this stuff it's
obvious that victory was just around the corner.  Occasionally Rasen's brief and wooden speeches directly into
the camera would give what initially seemed like a welcome relief from the unrelenting cheery music and scenes
of our troops hauling butt through mud.  However most of his speeches consist of the worst possible history, the
kind you immediately forget when it's over: dry accounts of dates, numbers, comings and goings with no sense of
why this would be important or meaningful in understanding the overall course of the conflict from any perspective:
militarily, politically, economically or otherwise.  On a few occasions he actually stated his own personal views
(which were rather bitter about military strategy) or said something interesting, like the first American troops in
Vietnam were around the end of World War II...much earlier than most people realize [and he stated his theory
that our former allies the French actually instigated the first attack on our troops, killing the commanding officer
and wounding his aide in a 2 day period, because they did not want the US there and wanted to maintain it as
a strictly French colony].

Also on a few occasions the military footage imparted some interesting information, like the amazingly complex
communications system the US evolved to manage the conflict.  I didn't realize we had quite that sophisticated
equipment in the 1960's.

In general however this is simply a collage of military footage occasionally interrupted by brief wooden speeches
written by Razen.  I think I could have edited the five DVD's down to at most one DVD, that might have felt
worthwhile.  This was the worst Vietnam documentary I've come across and is unlikely to satisfy anyone at
any position on a political spectrum of opinions about the conflict.  Save yourself!  Save your money.  Find another
product.",1446336000,2,4049,4.809248554913295
8341309,1,B001TH37N0,"I gave this a 2nd look to make sure I didn't misjudge Mr. Rasen and the intent of these DVD's.  I salute him for his service and knowing he was awarded the CIB/purple heart should have given him pause before he produced this junk. His presentation and outright hostility was evident; why he produced this could only have been for the money!  As noted by other reviewers; the pamphlet was a load of crap and to malign the Marines (pg 18) with My Lai was outrageous.  Mr. Rasen went on to work as a ABC producer and not editing this piece of misinformation was unforgiveable; he needs to go back and OJT the editing process and read his output more carefully. I am deeply disappointed in Mr. Rasen and his work is an affront to all who bought this set and found that all the material was taken from other sources and not credited either.  One plus, there was video I had not seen before and highlights of locations I served in when I was in VN and appreciated the memory.",1413936000,,969,4.337016574585635
8341310,5,B001TH37N0,"From the very start of this 5 dvd set, I knew I had selected a ""no nonsense"" look at the War (no matter what they called it, it was a war!) that came to be a black-eye on the face of the greatest nation history has ever known. I imagine that historians and politicians would all like to paint a ""rosier than truth picture"" of this tradegy, but truth is truth. I really appreciate the frankness and objectivity in which this account is delivered...However, since I was NOT there, I will shut up and say no more.",1401840000,2,510,4.268041237113402
8341311,5,B001TH37N0,"I don't see why this set got all bad reviews. It's exactly what I expected. I wasn't expecting a history of the entire war. It's not. Its a few DVD's of different groups from our side that fought the war. They are old films from when the war was being fought made by the military. I wouldnt call it ""propaganda"" though. If you are looking for a history lesson or graphic footage of casualties and fighting, look elsewhere. If you are looking for mid 1960's films of what the different groups of allied forces were doing mostly early on during the war, this is for you. You can't beat it for the price.

P.s. the booklet does have a misprint about My lai. (mentioned in another review).",1383782400,3,685,4.393700787401575

""America at War"" from the History Channel is the one you want to purchase. This is awful, on so many levels I don't know how it got onto the shelf. I am serious when I say there our several other videos you can find but don't purchase this one!",1323734400,,370,4.082191780821918
8341313,1,B001TH37N0,"Since I love documentaries, my brother got me this dvd set along with ""Trenches, Battleground  WWI"", for  Christmas.  And let me tell you... stay away from anything produced by Madacy Entertainment.  All this contains is some old public domain footage from the US military's propaganda department, and there is literally nothing of value in terms of education or information.  Then, there is some low rent, uneducated, and disheveled old man, whose seems to be robotically reading from a cue card in his basement, as he spumes some quick political propaganda which has no direction or meaning.
Since they were gifts, I can't get too angry, but at the same time I feel like everyone needs to know what a scam they're running.  Save your money on anything this company publishes for sale...  THIS HAS ZERO DOCUMENTARY,OR ENTERTAINMENT VALUE!",1293321600,6,839,5.036231884057971

8341315,2,B001TH37N0,"This should serve only as reference material about US propaganda machine during the Vietnam conflict. All US made films about what units did and how many casualties they inflicted, never really getting into the affects on their troops or our casualties. As the history books state, US completely overstate their success in these films. They are good only as a reference, some good maps and battle footage. I wouldn't buy it again. I want the real story, not this spoon fed dribble.",1291248000,,481,4.878048780487805
