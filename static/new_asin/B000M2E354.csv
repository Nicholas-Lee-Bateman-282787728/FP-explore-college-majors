2718666,5,B000M2E354,Fast delivery.  Probably one of the top documentaries I have seen.  Filled with factual information and breathtaking scenery.  A must have for any library and especially if you have students of any age in the house.,1179014400,,215,4.916666666666667
2718667,5,B000M2E354,"I used this DVD in my Science class. It is fantastic and I would recommend it to any parent or teacher. The cinematography is breathtaking and the content is presented in a realistic, balanced narration.",1178928000,,203,4.828571428571428
2718668,5,B000M2E354,"Galapagos DVD is probably the best nature movie/documentary I have ever seen. Besides the fact that I am an Ecuadorian, and that I have visited the Galapagos, without been too bias I can say this work is a Masterpiece.

On this three part documentary the viewer is shown things about the Galapagos that very few people in the world have had the chance to see. Most people don't know this, but as a tourist travelling to the Galapagos you are restricted to a small ""people friendly"" section of the Archipelago, although you might find it to be the most incredible experience of your life (as it was my case when I visited for the first time in 1999), you can only see the tip of the iceberg. This documentary shows you incredible footage of animals, and places, that unless you are a scientist working there for years you wouldn't have the chance to see.

To make it short, I you want to visit the Galapagos see this DVD first, and if you only dream to go then fuel the imagination and buy the DVD...

like I did.

Only one bad thing, there are no Spanish or French subtitles... come on BBC not the whole world can understand English...",1178928000,,1135,4.4423076923076925
2718669,5,B000M2E354,"I have seen many documentaries about the Galapagos islands and I find this one to be the most vivid and engaging. It is a fascinating overview and the filmakers have captured a cornocopia of dazzling displays of life in this ""one of a kind"" place.  It's a shorter presentation than the heavyweight BBC documentaries like ""Planet Earth"" and ""The Blue Planet"", but it feels complete and satisfying.  The narration is unobtrusive and full of illuminations, and the viewer is rewarded for repeat viewings with subtle details that add up in the bigger context.  I find it hard to believe anyone could argue against ""Darwin's theory of evolution"" after watching ""Galapagos"".",1178928000,2,668,5.054545454545455
2718670,5,B000M2E354,"Just another example of great BBC documentries...  I purchased this BBC nature DVD for my 4 year old, and have watched it spell bound with her, 3 times already!",1178928000,,160,4.517241379310345
2718671,5,B000M2E354,"The three ""Galapagos"" programs (BBC/National Geographic) set a breath-taking new standard for wildlife cinematography.  The artistic quality of this project is absolutely incredible- it is clear that only the most outstanding footage, of the highest resolution, artistic quality, and impact, was presented.  This is much more than a wonderful lesson in Natural History- it is a real work of art, and a masterpiece at that.  It places the Galapagos in perspective like no other film has done, but it teaches much more about the beauty of life itself.  The narration is perfect, and does not compete with the beautiful sights and sounds that make up these programs.",1175731200,10,663,5.168224299065421
2718672,5,B000M2E354,"This DVD will transport you to the wonders of the Galapagos. The documentary provides viewers with in depth commentary and footage that will certainly bring the destination closer to you. Image quality and footage are superbly filmed, and Tilda Swinton's soothing voice & pitch set the right tone for an amazing destination.

Wildlife footage has been captured in an unbelievable way; not only from a visually entertaining point of view, but also from a detailed point of view.  Loved the scenes where giant tortoises are featured, marine iguanas feeding, blue-footed boobies displaying, albatrosses courting, and the only-tropical penguin on Earth fishing underwater. The volcanic eruption footage is also remarkable for its quality. For viewing purposes, the larger the screen the better.

We went to the Galapagos in May 2006 for nine days and it was an unbelievable experience. We used Adventure Associates in the US, and also Ecuador's Metropolitan Touring. This dvd will remind us constantly of the powerful message the islands left upon us. We asked for ""what is the best time to go"", and we understand that tourism is managed year-round. We were advised that in the summer months, Easter, Xmas and New Year's, finding space can be challenging, but in months like April, May and early June, finding space is easier, and that wildlife is at its prime due to the transition months between one season and the other one. They were SO right! We saw so many incredible things both on land and underwater (weather was unbelievably perfect too!). We noticed larger vessels offered greater amenities, onboard options, and their level of Naturalists' environmental interpretation is excellent. We are making arrangements to go back again with friends in early June 2007, and will give them this dvd as a gift.

Back to the dvd, the sound quality is perfect and the low price of $14.99 is very affordable. This is thus far the best comprehensive documentary we have seen about the Galapagos, and it will not be a disappointment. I have purchased other documentaries, and although they were good, this one remains our favorite. Another hard-to-find dvd is NG's ""Galapagos, Land of Dragons"", but was never released in dvd format, just vhs. You know what happens with vhs tapes after playing them twenty times. The dvd case has easy access to the dvd itself, and the different menus are easy to navigate through. The only con is that it brings just the audio program in English. It'd have been great to add Spanish and German.

All science teachers and libraries should have it. You will not be disappointed with this dvd. Hope you can visit this extraordinary destination.",1175299200,45,2666,5.02262443438914
2718673,5,B000M2E354,We went to the Galapagos last March on a fabulous camping and kayaking trip that was the most amazing experience.  This place is so very special and the show really captures the beauty and yet explains the fragility.  If you can't go at least watch the show.,1174953600,5,258,4.468085106382978
2718674,5,B000M2E354,"I waited a long time to see this special on the National Geographic Channel, and I wasn't disappointed. Don't let the nearly three hours scare you because this is very well worth it.

This is by far the best documentary I have seen...EVER. They did a wonderful job at looking at land, sea, and air creatures, giving all of them equal time. They explain Darwin's visit very well, and the video is pristine. You truly believe you are there when you watch this.

As I said earlier, don't let the three hours scare you. It may seems to drag on in some places. Believe me though, it is worth every minute of it. It's sad to know that humans are destroying places like that. If anything, this documentary will show the world that these creatures are actually WORTH keeping around.",1174262400,81,774,4.521428571428571

awakens  ones senses to the beauty of nature that exists in a place where the indigenous marine and land animals
are protected and preserved. It is a DVD to watch over and over again as its music, it's photography, it's scientific
And historic narration bring to the viewer both knowledge and an inner peace.",1412640000,,421,4.526315789473684
2718753,4,B000M2E354,"The Galapagos Islands have captured the attention of the world over the years and are one of those places so often on a travellers 'bucket list'. This two disc set from the BBC is narrated by actress Tilda Swinton and has the sort of gorgeous photography and production values you'd expect from the BBC.

The known history of the islands are discussed as is of course the visit by Charles Darwin. The focus is very much on the various animals that make the islands their home both beneath the waves, on land and in the air. There is, I suppose, not much new here apart from the fact that the three episodes of the show do get together nicely and do give a decent amount of screen time to the many natural facets of the islands. As such these are great for the armchair traveller, nature buff or traveller planning their next holiday. As a set, these discs certainly make an attractive gift idea.

There is a fourth episode tacked onto the end that focusses on the conservation efforts that target the various tortoises of the islands and especially the plight of 'Lonesome George' - the last known example of his kind. This takes a different tack to the three episodes that make up the main body of the show in that it has a different narrator, is more specialised and features more talking head experts. It talks to fisherman as well as conservationists, rangers and the like and delves into some of the social aspects of the mass migration that the islands have gone through in response to the tourist boom.

A very worthwhile purchase if nature documentaries are your thing.",1412380800,,1577,4.585106382978723

I believer that it is only fair that these movie makers let customers know that these videos will have idealists or theorists like charles darwin.

2718854,5,B000M2E354,Great way to revisit our experience in The Galapagos.  Lots of info about Galapagos life on land and in the sea.  Our guide was oneof the scientific advisors for this dvd so we knew it would be informative accurate and entertaining.,1373414400,,232,4.634146341463414

2718858,5,B000M2E354,The best their is. This is Science and biology with of course evolution. This is where the it all got it's start. And Darwin said as much in his The Origin of Species.,1372982400,,167,4.090909090909091

2718860,5,B000M2E354,"I agree with the high praise reviews, as this overall is an excellent documentary with great photography and editing.  However, the video is heavily compressed on a 25GB disc and needs to be redone for a 50GB disc release.",1371340800,,222,4.6923076923076925
2718861,5,B000M2E354,"I saw this documentary on the National Geographic channel and bought the DVD for a friend of mine who had just taken a trip to the Galapagos.  They enjoyed it even more than I did because they had seen many of the sights on their tour.  However, the documentary also was able to show what is going on beneath the surface as the islands build up or break down, the spectacular show of luminescent plankton, the life of other undersea animals which they were not able to experience and which they truly appreciated.  It also showed areas which are off limits to tourists in order to protect the animals and habitat.  Be prepared, this video is almost three hours long, but it is broken up into 25 segments, so you can stop after a few segments and pick it up again later or some other day.  It is well worth the price and well worth watching more than once.",1369785600,,855,4.352201257861635

Galapagos was a breath of fresh air and the only documentary I know of that matches the quality of Yellowstone. I especially liked how it layered in the Darwin history. Fascinating.,1369785600,,289,4.686274509803922
2718863,5,B000M2E354,Stunning and informative at the same time. I could not recommend it more. The animals are fascinating. And it gives just the right amount of history.,1368835200,,149,4.769230769230769

2718867,5,B000M2E354,"Wow, this is a really incredible show!  It was very informative (I learned a lot of new things!) and the footage was beautiful.  I'm glad this is available because I will probably never have the chance to go to Galapagos, and now I feel like I've seen at least some of its mysteries and wonders.  Really interesting documentation of unique/weird animals too!",1366243200,,358,4.741935483870968

2718872,5,B000M2E354,"Galapagos is about the little known Galapagos Islands, which is about 600 miles off the coast of South America, and comprises of at least 100 small Islands. It is the only place in the world you will find Marine Iguana's, and Galapagos Tortoise's. All of these Islands were made from volcanic eruptions from beneath the ocean, which is constantly occurring, and it continually builds these Islands.

I really enjoyed the beautiful site of liquid lava, the beautiful red hot, or roseate looking, and orange colors shooting up into the air as it is rebuilding these Islands. The underwater scenes are crystal clear, and at times it actually looks like a real underwater scene. This movie has a good narrator who is easy to listen to, and she carefully explains the wildlife, and the surroundings to you. Most of the overhead shots looking down onto the Islands, give you a wider view of the enormous size of some of these Islands.",1364169600,3,928,4.8

2718874,5,B000M2E354,"This three part series is an outstanding view of the mysterious Galapagos Islands.  It clearly shows the interesting wildlife of these remote islands, and discusses how they differ from similar animals elsewhere.  The scenes with the marine iguanas are mesmerizing, as you see them jump from the rocks into the water to forage for food.  As you watch this, you feel you have reached another planet.  The scenes involving the tortoises are almost as striking, largely because of the expression of the faces of these beautiful giants.

Throughout the episodes, there is discussion of Charles Darwin and his impact upon the Galapagos Islands.  This lends a great deal to the series without making it seem too much like a history lesson.

Narration is done by Tilda Swinton, and while at first I was unsure of how well she could possible do compared to the gold standard, David Attenborough, she holds up well.  In fact, her repeated enunciation of the name of the islands as just 'Galapagos' and not 'The Galapagos Islands"" is very memorable.

Anyone who sees this documentary is sure to want to visit these islands - I know that I do.  This series is well worth the time taken to watch it and is sure to pique your curiosity in these unusual islands.",1361664000,,1248,4.7627906976744185
2718875,5,B000M2E354,This is accurate and enlightening information about the process of evolution. It is such a beautifully shot show. Very spectacular.,1361491200,,131,5.6
2718876,5,B000M2E354,"Let me explain.  While I usually love anything BBC, this falls short and for one simple reason.  It's biased toward man's ""GOD"" complex.  I watched this via 'Prime Instant Videos"" as it was part of my plan.  Episode one is awesome!

Episode two would be awesome if not for the ""constant forcing of Darwinism"". Too many people seem to think that Darwin tried to counter ""creation"" with ""evolution"".  Nothing could be more wrong. In his later years, he admitted that he was wrong.

Now to episode three.  This episode really made me mad when it showed a helicopter chasing down goats and shooting them and leaving them for dead!!!  What is wrong with man?  Yes, the goats were introduced, but so WAS EVERY OTHER SPECIES on these ISLANDS, including MAN!  Man never ceases to amaze me in their ignorance of how the real world works! I wonder how long it will be before some other life form will be looking back on the ""humanoid"" and wondering why man in it's own wisdom failed to see the big picture and made itself extinct.

The Galapagos is the perfect place to show that if left alone, that all life can not only survive but also learn how to thrive in unison, without, outside interference.",1361232000,,1190,4.561320754716981

It is a  nice introduction to the various landscapes and fauna of the islands and how they differed one from another.  The Darwin segment made me cringe, I don't see his work as a positive ""change of the world"".  I could stomach it enough to see past it though.  My kids were in awe (ages 2, 5, and 6)",1360454400,,458,4.329411764705882

However, going to the Islands is still the trip of a lifetime.  If you can . . . go to the Islands via International Expeditions.  Their trip is wonderful, and the scenery is unforgettable.",1358640000,,366,4.5

My (then 8 y.o.) son then read several books about Darwin and his trip and research, and wanted to watch it again--so worth the time.  The narration is well done, the re-enactment of Darwin is not cheesy like some other historical documentaries.  It will amaze you and make you want to visit, and learn a lot along the way.

This was a first class production from top to bottom. It keeps you locked in with fascinating facts and well delivered narration.

There's some really solid digital animation too that puts the greater area in perspective and does a good job of explaining the shift of the islands. The sections with Darwin are pretty minor. The biology and ecology is well explained and detailed without being at all technical. We got it to see the animals, but were surprised at how much the landscape shots and time lapse scenes really moved us. Fully worthwhile.",1344211200,,511,5.023529411764706

2718896,5,B000M2E354,"I watched the HD version and it provided visuals so real I almost reached out a few times at my laptop. You can see the love of the editors immediately that went into choosing just the right clip, I actually said 'wow' out loud a few times. The music was very well done too, it stayed soft and in the background most of the time but would swell epically during key events. One piece was so pretty and haunting that I'm am desperately googling to find out if its available.

For those that heard Tom Hiddleston narrated, it is not what you think. He narrates for a young Charles Darwin and has maybe a minute of speaking time in the first episode and maybe two minutes in the second episode. It was enough of a taste to wish for future full length narrations from him. The majority of this is narrated by Tilda Swinton who gave a wonderful performance. Her voice is strong and powerful in describing the life and death events on these islands.",1339804800,2,942,4.382857142857143

I'm heading there next month and I hope to see much more than what is shown here! ...BBC usually puts out incredible work, but I found this documentary focused too much on the whole ""Darwin Experience"" and not enough of the modern experience.

2718899,1,B000M2E354,"Be aware of the title HD DVD.  The title ""HD DVD"" is unrepresentative. I had understood that it would play on any DVD player with the HD cable or in HD quality picture.  In fact HD DVD itself refers to the HD DVD format, more precisely to the format ""Disc Format HD DVD 30"", as it is written on the box which contains this DVD disc.  This particular format was mainly provided by Toshiba DVD player for some time, and then Toshiba in the year 2008 just dropped this format for good.  After that, no DVD player was manufactured by Toshiba or anyone else in this format.  As I understand, that the HD DVD format was copyrighted by Toshiba. So, if you have that old format ""HD DVD 30"" DVD player from Toshiba, it will only play on that DVD player.  In summary, this Galapagos HD DVD will not play on any other DVD player.  In addition, inside the box, there is an insert, which reads ""For additional information, please go to [...]"".  This website just does not exist.
I have wasted hours in making this HD DVD play until I found the above result through my son who also had the same experience.

2718906,4,B000M2E354,"In my opinion the Galapagos Islands are the most beautiful and the most pivotal islands in the world that supports Darwin's Theory of Evolution and the Origin of Species. It's elegance and strangeness separate these islands more than anywhere in the world. You'll see lava fields, shores and beaches, sea lions, blue-footed boobies, and the albatross and much much more.

The documentary is in three parts, 'Born Of Fire', 'Islands That Changed The World' and 'Forces Of Change'. Two and a half hours of splendor. Wonderfully narrated by Tilda Swinton. The animals, wildlife and beauty of the landscape is captured wonderfully in Hi-Def.

I suggest this film to anyone who loves the nature of our world as well as the Theory Of Evolution.",1330214400,,738,4.991869918699187

The first video is about the formation of the chain of islands collectively called the Galapagos.  The video is appropriate for all ages - from 3 years old to grand parents.  The cinematography is simply amazing.  It ranges from underwater shots of sea lions, to amazing footage of reptiles on a barren coastline, and wonderful ""sky"" shots from planes cruising the gorgeous coastline.  BBC and National Geographic did a superb job filming.  I truly think everyone will enjoy the video.  It was definitely worth the $3 to watch and own.

In general the BBC puts out some excellent film about nature and the plant and they seem to capture the best shots of animal life that photography has to offer. I think this is another excellent example of their work and highly recommend it for purchase.,1326672000,,359,4.454545454545454

2718910,3,B000M2E354,"The visuals on this disc are fantastic. But when you watch one of these BBC Earth productions that's narrated by someone other than Attenborough, you quickly realize what a major contribution he makes. Not only is his voice a pleasure to listen to, but he provides detailed, mesmerizing explanations of what you're seeing, like the best possible tour guide. The subdued woman narrating Galapagos sounds like Galadriel in The Lord of the Rings trilogy from Peter Jackson; like she's high on some kind of potion. Rather than providing riveting details, she speaks in simple, short, poetic phrases that might be good for a movie poster, but not a narration for something that should be first and foremost scientific. She's talking about Darwin, after all. Here's an example of one of these nuggets, referring to marine iguanas: ""There are dragons here."" Spoken in a way that is supposed to send a tingle down our spine, all it did is make my eyes roll a little. BBC has been putting out amazing nature documentaries at a breakneck pace, and I imagine Sir Attenborough can logistically only do so many of them. But he is sorely missed on productions such as this.",1321920000,,1159,4.8291457286432165

2718912,4,B000M2E354,"I was displeased to see that an actor was a stand-in for Charles Darwin as I despite reenactments in nature documentaries. I think reenactments interfere with the quality of a nature film. The score really drowned out Tilda Swinton's narration and some of the natural sounds of the animals. It is repetitive at times due to the fact that this is a BBC series that was intended for three separate 50-minute viewings.

With the negative aspects out of the way, this film is truly stunning and full of captivating information. The islands are full of strange birds, reptiles, and sea wildlife. Mammals seem to be rare in the Galapagos; the only ones I witnessed are the wild sea lions and fur seals, as well as domestic animals such as dogs, cats, and troublesome goats that ate most of the vegetation. My favorites moments of the show are the how the flightless cormorants adapted to the island, how the blue footed boobie birds use their feet as ""breaks"" in the air, and any glimpse of the slow and prehistoric Galapagos tortoises.

And you can't mention Galapagos without Charles Darwin in the same breath.  This program does a great job with Darwin in the 2nd episode.  Even with such a variety of animals/plants dwelling, this program covered all territories here, land, water, and air.  Also presented are information about the islands' history, geology (rock and volcanic activity), tectonic plates, and weather patterns, for example, prevailing winds affect the adaptation of certain species to specific islands.  The female narration, Tilda Swanton, is adequate and a good break from David Attenborough.  Well rounded presentation, this BBC gem sure don't miss a beat, you'll leave feeling suddenly somewhat of an expert of Galapagos.

This program made me feel that blu ray technology was made for nature, and that nature was made for blu ray, ie. they go hand in hand.  The picture quality and angle shots are so amazing that I feel this is the only reason to partake in watching TV, and the main reason for high def, which the picture is absolutely magnificent.  Science and nature programming used to exist for the main reason of educational/informative.  But nowadays, it seems like it's more for fantastic-ism.  3 parts, 1 hr each.

The underwater photography in the third episode is some of the best I have ever seen with color, clarity and lighting worthy of any. Maybe the very best.

Some problems. The estimable Ms. Swinton I believe to be an unfortunate choice of narrator.  I like the idea of not anthropomorphizing nature (which is done to some degree anyway by the music), but I believe the narrator's voice should express compassion and awe for the animals and nature, which Ms. Swinton does not.  She tries nobly, but her calling is elsewhere.

The closeups of the birds and the beasts, the flowers unfurling, the long-necks of certain turtles, the fish feeding in the algae, the reptiles silhouetted by the sun, the whales and the penguins,  and the flow of iconic images underscored by a narrative embracing geology, biology, history, and the writing and thoughts of Charles Darwin leaves indelible images.

Galapagos was shot beautifully. The documentary was pretty good and fairly educational. But the presentation was lacking in several areas. I didn't sit in my seat, awed by any part of the film. Yes, there were some cool scenes, like the albatross scene. But even with those scenes, they could've done more to help us appreciate the enormous size of the birds. If I didn't already know about albatrosses, I would not have been as impressed with that scene. I had to explain to my girlfriend why these birds were amazing because the DVD certainly didn't.

The photography was beautiful, but I am sooooo fed up with this modern style of nature documentary where they have to make every little thing they do seem like a tragic drama.  They show things the animals do every day, like the aquatic iguana diving into the water to go down and eat some algea, and they say things like they're daring to take a suicidal jump and can barely survive the swim down to eat the algea without freezing to death,...  when obviously this isn't true or they would have died out centuries ago.  This going on and on making normal healthy things seem tragic make it so that people don't take naturalists seriously when they talk about things which really *are* serious like loss of habitat and toxic pollution.  What are they thinking?

Why don't they educate about how these animals live and then if they have to add some tragedy, tell about the environmental problems these animals face?  These people are ruining the credibility of environmentalists and I wish they would stop it.",1281916800,27,1050,4.736263736263736

Con: 1) The script for each segment is written as if the viewer hasn't seen previous episodes so there is quite a lot of repetition. I hope to never hear reference to an ""island conveyor belt"" again. 2) Tilda Swinton's narration offers either one of two modes: flat, or kindergarten teacher. I found it tiresome. With good narrators available, why do we keep being subjected to the Sigourney Weavers and Oprah Winfreys?  3) As the series progresses it becomes one long sales pitch for evolution theory. While the natural evidence found in the Galapagos does present a logical argument for adaptation theory, I found the Darwinist ""and the world was changed forever"" drumbeat tedious.

  There are three shows in this mini series and each of them are worth watching.  They manage to show us more than tortoises and marine iguanas--they also highlight the avian fauna of the island fairly well, including documenting a neat bit of hunting by the short eared owls.  Very informative, covering the drift and history of the Galapagos as well as the flora and fauna.  I do wish they'd gone into more detail about the effects of the introduced plants and animals, and I wish they'd shot another episode worth of content.  It'd have been neat to get a more in depth view of the difference between the older and younger islands--what animals are only found on the younger vs older islands, differences in temps, etc.  It covers some of the differences--it shows much more varied topography on the older islands, and implies they have a greater diversity of life, but more detail would have been nice.

Thankfully, Galapagos does not speak of the fictional boogeyman of manmade global warming(or does it so briefly that I cannot remember), so I didn't have to roll my eyes or laugh at the absurdity of the idea at any point in the documentary.

One fixation the show has is on Charles Darwin.  I am a believer in evolution, however, God designed his creations with that ability, ironically leaving humans to be largely unchanged (with the exception of our minds).  Thankfully, Galapagos also avoids the sensitive subject of religion and manages to see Darwin's observations as simple science, leaving religion up to the viewer.

2718958,3,B000M2E354,"I recently got a 50"" plasma (panasonic G10) and a blu-ray player (panasonic 60) and I wanted to test out all the blu-rays that supposedly had the best picture quality. These nature docs have been considered some of the best.

GALAPAGOS = 4-Star Blu-Ray Video / 2-Star Nature Doc

The video is good, but not great like a pristine movie transfer like Sin City or Kung-Fu Panda. I found this nature doc particularly boring. It has a few nice bits, but there's lots of repetition of shots, and wildlife just isn't as interesting as the other docs. I would only reccomend this if you're super super super interesting in learning about Galapagos.

GANGES = 4-Star Blu-ray Video / 3-Star Nature Doc

Video quality is about the same as Galapagos, good, but there's a lot better. This nature doc is a lot more interesting than Galapagos, more magic shots, better tid bits, a more emotional experience. This is worth checking out for the content.

PLANET EARTH = 4.5-Star Blu-ray Video / 4-Star Nature Doc

This is a fantastic video transfer, better than Galapagos and Ganges. By better, I mean, richer blacks, deeper colors, sharper detail. All around, a step up. This is a four disc experience. I think they put all their best content on the first disc. Seriously, the first disc was thrilling, the others were a huge step down, in terms of locations and wildlife. Maybe it's a weird personal preference thing, but I watched the first disc three times, but could barely get through the others. I would say disc one is a must see.

BARAKA = 5-Star Blu-ray Video / 5-Star Nature Doc

This wins the Super Shiny Titanium Standard Award for best video and best nature doc. It was shot on 70mm and transfered to, like, quad-HD digital. This is one of the very best blu-rays ever made. It holds up against all new releases, because the source was 70mm. And this nature doc seemed the most magical. If you want to get a good demo disc, to show to any audience, this is the one. And the Baraka experience sticks with you. I can see myself watching this quite a few times in the years ahead, just for the experience.",1250208000,12,2098,4.576

I was not very impressed, but I later learned that not all of this was shot in high definition.  Some scenes clearly were, but most of this production seems like an ordinary DVD.  See, it can't just be a blu-ray disc for the wow factor to set in:  the thing has to have originally been shot in high definition.

On the plus side, the contents of this program should give no cause for complaint.  The series consists of three episodes, each 50 minutes long.  The first is merely a melange of the lives of various inhabitants of the Galapagos, such as the sea lion and the blue-footed booby.  The second talks about the importance of the Galapagos islands to natural history.  This part struck me as a bit odd since it seemed, unbelievably, to skirt around the issue of evolution, contenting itself with such statements as ""the islands had profoundly changed Darwin's views.""  The third part looks, at least partially, at the human settlements now permanent on the Galapagos and discusses the implications of these.

And, Tilda Swinton as the narrator is a marvelous treat!
Its beautiful. Its informative. Its long which makes it worth the $$$.

The BBC is certainly giving you your money's worth here. And it's not just a matter of quantity over quality. The ""Planet Earth"" series set the bar very high for nature documentaries and I am glad to report that Galapagos lives up to those expectations. Narrated by the lovely Tilda Swinton, every minute is filled with gorgeous photography and high production value.

There is lots here to like, and a good amount of variety in the animals and scenery featured. There are land animals, sea animals, birds, plants, and topography. Lots of beautiful underwater and aerial shots to look at.

2718970,3,B000M2E354,"Planet Earth has set the standard by which all nature documentaries will be judged for years to come. Although the Galapagos offers up some stunning scenes and footage of creatures not found in the Planet Earth series, it falls short of that high bar for a few reasons:

1) The content is not very rich: there is a lot repeated footage and narrative which makes everything feel stretched. Recreations of Darwin walking the islands as well as of whaling ships and pirates detract from the overall experience in my opinion.

2) Attention to detail and quality: There is some spectacular footage on the DVD, however, in comparison to Planet Earth there is a lot more mediocre content. I'm not sure whether the used different camera equipment or if it's just a poor transfer, but the image quality does not compare as well.

3) Lack of focus: The DVD is divided into three parts, yet I found myself wanting more detail at every stage. For example, the first part which starts by focusing on the formation of the islands geology seems to fizzle away from that and leaves it open and incomplete. For a documentary about the Galapagos I was disappointed I did not get more focused information about the Galapagos.

Despite it's short comings this is a great DVD for someone interested in seeing more of their home planet from an arm chair. But if you're only going to own one then buy Planet Earth - and if you're expecting the same level of detail and quality as Planet Earth - don't.",1239148800,11,1478,4.629770992366412

Planet Earth while not the greatest thing ever put on this earth is quality and has great narration, on the other hand Galapagos falls flat. The narration is poorly written and read, Tilda Swinton does not do a very good good but mostly its the poor writing I blame fro this dud. They constantly repeat the same concepts over and over again. What should have been a one and a half hour special they have turned into a three hour snoozer. The lay out of the show is also quite useless, one minute they will be talking about Darwin, the next its about Owls which one has nothing to do with the other. It continues to jump around throughout, and it uses the same tired old pictures and footage to do it. I am not saying they don't have some great footage in here cause they do, but they over use somethings and strecthed it out over too long a period. Planet Earth is head and shoulders better than this piece, although its worth borrowing for some of the great HD shots of the Galapagos.

This three-part series, narrated hypnotically by Oscar-winner Tilda Swinton, includes a largely informative script, a heartrending score and some of the finest nature photography ever committed to film. Whether tracking an enormous Blue-Footed Booby flock on a massive dive for prey, following the eerie progress of Marine Iguanas on an undersea quest for red algae or honoring, through iconic imagery, the dogged persistence of the Galapagos Tortoise, the film is endlessly fascinating. Through three gripping episodes, it never flags.

If ever there was a film to unite evolutionists with Biblical fundamentalists, this is it. The endless birth and aging of islands in the ""hot spot"" of the archipelago -- some as young as 30,000 years of age; others in excess of 100 million years -- reveals the full flowering of nature, and justifies the concept of evolution and the holiness of wild places.

The narration, visual photography, the sound and the context of the entire idea is just mesmerizing.

To show how much i was into this, i had just come back from a 16 hour shift (this week has been like this all 5 days) i came back and found this amongst other amazon goodies. I was looking forward to it but was not expecting what i saw.  I played it in and there i was moved for the next 2 hours until my body and brain could not take it anymore. i had to sleep due to exhaustion! but rest assured i continued when i got back the next day.  I had no idea how much beauty and life still exists on this planet despite us plundering the earth's resources.

This title only can be appreciated fully on Bluray! i don't want to make this a DVD Format discussion but anyone watching this on a 92'' diagonal HD Projection screen can appreciate what this disc has to offer.

Lets start with the technical details.  This 30GB HD DVD was shot in 1080p and encoded in VC-1.  The 1.78 aspect ratio makes it perfect for use with the 16:9 HDTV screens.  The audio is rendered in Dolby Digital Plus 2.0 Stereo.  It does not have any supplements but none is needed.

There is nothing exceptional about the audio but it gets the job done.  The video quality however is second to none.  The video quality is on par with Planet Earth.  There is probably none better out there as of this writing.

The impact of Charles Darwin short visit to the Galapagos continues to reverberate till today.  This video allows us to visit and experience Galapagos far better and far deeper than Charles Darwin ever did during his stay.

We view the Galapagos from the sky with satellite like shots, breath taking rushes from helicopters, panoramic views from mountain tops, incredible underwater shots.  We are able to see Galapagos in ways that even a visit to Galapagos itself will not provide unless one is willing to spent as much resources and time as the producers of this feature.

Narrated by Tilda Swinton, the features provides tremendous educational and entertainment value.  The feature is visually very engaging and with little effort, imparts a great deal of scientific information in an entertaining manner for all people from all ages.

So I eagerly snapped this HD DVD up, because I'm a new HD DVD player owner (and VERY disappointed in the death of the format...although my player is an OUTSTANDING upconverter...anyway, back to the subject at hand).

The visuals are absolutely stunning.  No other word will do.  The HD detail is magnificent and the beauty of these islands probably could never be captured better.  Obviously, going there in person would be unbeatable...but until then, this disc will serve.

I also thoroughly enjoyed the discs from an educational level.  I learned a lot about the geology and biology of the place, and ""met"" many creatures I was only glancingly familiar with.  The footage of the Marine Iguanas diving below the choppy ocean to eat was a true high point in my lifetime viewing...no exagerration.  That acts of such awkward beauty take place regularly on our planet is pretty amazing to me.

Newly minted Oscar-winner Tilda Swinton provides suitable quiet, respectful, ""vedy British"" narration.

Only gripe:  because this disc is actually several episodes, there is some repetition of material presented.  You get to hear the geologic history of the islands a few times.  It's a fairly minor quibble...and absolutely does not deter me from recommending.

When I watched episode 1, my 20 year old son was around.  He was fixing to leave for the evening to hand out with friends...but ended up glued to the sofa for the whole episode.  The next night, my 15 year old daughter griped and moaned about watching an episode...but sure enough...five minutes later she was entranced.

This is not a movie, it is a documentary.. so it don't matter if it is 1080i or 1080p because it is not a movie period. Those people been using a better quality camcorders.

The video is stunning as I speak.. Some of yall only complain over some numbers like 1080i and it is so childish, listen this is not a movie.

The audio is only Dolby Digital 2.0 because the movie itself about 150 mins cause it was split in three chapters with HD Picture Quality. So it much been that it wasn't enough room for 5.1 but lucky me that I owned an THX Certified Onkyo TX-705 that convert Dolby 2.0 into THX Natural 7.1!!! So don't matter to me cause i can hear 7.1 with the help of THX.

My advice would be watch this one first, then planet earth. This is why I only give it 4 stars.

Regardless, the movie captured many wonderful creatures in the island and the origin of the islands itself. It's very interesting to see that Galapagos has both brutal and lush landscapes and both are habitats of unique creatures many of which are found nowhere else. Fascinating video. Highly recommended!",1183334400,4,482,5.2727272727272725

to the TV from start to finish. I highly recommend this film to anyone

that likes true documentaries and beautiful photos that tell you what

is going on and has gone on on our planet. We also ordered the Planet

Earth Series at the same time and all of our children and even Grand

Children thought both were outstanding.  If there was anything higher

then a 5 we would rate it even higher.

2719060,5,B000M2E354,"There are a number of related documentaries on the market, including a Kenneth Branagh-narrated IMAX film (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Galapagos-IMAX/dp/B0000687GI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Galapagos (IMAX)</a>) and a personal journey with Richard Dreyfuss (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-the-Wild-The-Galapagos-Islands-with-Richard-Dreyfuss/dp/B00000FBID/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In the Wild: The Galapagos Islands with Richard Dreyfuss</a>), both produced in 1999. However, if like me, you have been enamored with the BBC's extraordinary&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Planet-Earth/dp/B000MR9D5E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Planet Earth</a>&nbsp;series designed for high definition (aired here on the Discovery Channel), then you will find yourself equally drawn to this 2007 DVD of a three-part 2006 BBC series on the mythologized Galapagos Islands. Even though the scope is not nearly as ambitious this time, the result is almost as enthralling given the plethora of exotic, endemic species surviving on this isolated archipelago of nineteen volcanic islands. I was fortunate enough to tour the Galapagos on a schooner several years ago, and I can assure you that the outstanding visual quality of these programs captures as much of the distinctive flora and fauna of the islands as possible on the DVD.

Aired stateside on the National Geographic Channel, the set consists of three fifty-minute programs. The first, ""Born of Fire"", provides a vivid archeological history of the islands and shows how several of the most unusual species originated there and learned to cohabitate with each other. The second program, ""Islands That Changed the World"", looks at man's imprint on the islands, for better or worse, with an obvious emphasis on the work of Charles Darwin as he developed many of his theories about evolution based on his sightings here. It does take on the feel of a scholastic film with recreations of historical figures and events, but they do provide helpful context. The last is ""Forces of Change"", which forecasts the future with some coverage of the global warming issues but more of the focus on man's burgeoning presence on the islands and what is currently being done to maintain the natural environment.

Unlike Sigourney Weaver's overly controlled narration on the U.S.-released version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Planet-Earth/dp/B000MR9D5E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Planet Earth</a>, actress Tilda Swinton imbues a greater sense of genuine enthusiasm over the dramatic images in this version. What is inarguable is the stunning cinematography, whether it's the satellite photos of the islands or the near-poetic movements of the animals spotlighted, for example, the first flights of the baby albatrosses, the dexterous swimming of the flightless cormorants, the multitudes of marine iguanas randomly spewing sea water from their lungs, and the proud ballooning of the red-bellied frigatebirds. There is a surprising lack of real scientific data which could have made the environmental reports that much more enlightening. You also have to tolerate some repetitiveness between the programs since they were aired at separate times. Regardless, this is nature programming at its finest, especially for those mesmerized by the particular idiosyncratic pleasures of the Galapagos.",1181001600,26,3485,6.428571428571429

Not only is the photography as good as you'll find for a nature subject, the writing, narration and pace are all perfect as well. The story of what Charles Darwin saw and how the idea of evolution itself evolved in his mind is as fascinating as the implications of evolution, and this film captures all of that and more. When you put it all together, you realize you are looking at the earth at the dawn of life. The only thing better will be asctually to visit the islands.",1179705600,2,601,4.181034482758621
