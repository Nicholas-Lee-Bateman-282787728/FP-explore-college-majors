3581725,5,B001FB5TAY,"Yes! I too have been waiting FOREVER for the second season of ""October Road"" to come out on DVD. When I just saw it just now my heart skipped a beat...hee hee. But then it fell cause I remember that my ""Road"" isn't coming back anymore and that makes me sad. I really loved this show and I wanted to see them grow and find out who was the Father of little Sam and see if Nick could ever find his own way. I hate it when really good shows never get a chance to find there wings to truly take fight... This show was great and will always have a special place in my heart. It wasn't over the top and overly done like some shows nowadays..to me it was simple and well written with a great cast. Rest in peace October Road. you will be missed!!",1239408000,7,738,3.9932432432432434
3581726,5,B001FB5TAY,"I have been waiting for season 2 to be released and finally its coming!  But the big disapointment is that it got cancelled after 2 full seasons! Not many people like this show but there is something about this show that I can relate to. Its a down to earth show and I like the actors on this show. What got me to buy season one was that the actor from One Tree Hill (Jake) starred in it and I got my attention. Since then I have gotten hooked on this show, and I only wished that it could have gone further.",1237507200,14,508,3.980392156862745
3581737,5,B001FB5TAY,Loved it,1441411200,,8,3.5
3581738,5,B001FB5TAY,What a class act. Most shows canceled early don't tie up loose ends. The 10 minute of footage in the bonus features was great. This show cared enough for it's fans to shoot this for the dvd. Thank you to the person or persons responsible. This was a great show with lots of quirky characters. I never gave it a chance during its original run but thanks to Amazon and DVD I didn't miss out.,1439510400,,389,4.2

3581743,5,B001FB5TAY,I think in episode 11 or 12 they go back to when they were adolescents... I don't remember the girl they were referring to at the birthday party and I found it a little odd that they went back in time just before the season ended.  The last episode leaves you wondering if Nick and Hannah ever got married and who the real father is... was it Eddie? I wished for more but I guess the renewal of the show was not in ABC's favor... great show. Will definitely watch both Season's again.,1420156800,,484,4.204301075268817
3581744,5,B001FB5TAY,"Great show, if you enjoyed Beautiful Girls you will enjoy this.",1419897600,,63,4.818181818181818

3581757,5,B001FB5TAY,"I fell in-love with Bryan Greenberg's character on One Tree Hill, so when I found out he was the main guy on this show, I had to get both seasons. This show captures your heart. Definitely a must, trust me.",1395014400,,206,4.175
3581758,5,B001FB5TAY,I loved the show when it was on. I wanted to finish watching it was disappointed when they cancelled it,1391904000,,103,4.2
3581759,4,B001FB5TAY,"DVDs are in good shape, except one of them skipped some throughout one of the episodes.",1388793600,,87,4.5
3581760,5,B001FB5TAY,Great season. Wish there were more. But Glad to find out what We were waiting to know. Fun to watch.,1388534400,,100,4.05
3581761,5,B001FB5TAY,"This was an excellent show with great casting. I missed it when it aired in 2006-07. After viewing the entire two seasons in a week, I can't believe it was not renewed and am glad to have had the chance to watch it now!",1378771200,,219,4.0
3581762,5,B001FB5TAY,I wish this series was still on. So glad to have it on DVD and love the bonus features at the end.,1362355200,,98,3.5
3581763,4,B001FB5TAY,"Nick is a writer who wrote a bestselling novel that was turned into a movie - but his story trashed all his friends. The character names he used didn't even disguise the fact he was using his own town and his old friends as fodder. He returns to Knight Ridge, where he is most unwelcome, to teach a one-day intensive at the college - but this is in hopes that he will be inspired to write another book.

When he returns, he discovers his old high school girlfriend has a son that could be his. Nick stays in town, never returning to New York, to mend old friendships and discover if Sam is his child. Along the way there are many plot twists, as all the other characters are well flushed out with lives of their own.

The only important comment I have for this series is that you should skip the ""extras"" bit where the actors attempt to tie up all the loose ends. This was a series that could have gone on for a long time, and it ended with many unanswered questions, but the ""extras"" tie-up left more questions than answers (not to mention it seemed to ignore the story arc that the show left itself on).

My advice - watch the show, and be sad it ended.",1360368000,,1155,4.217194570135747
3581764,4,B001FB5TAY,"Dissapointed the studio didn't give a proper end to the series, but glad that the actors came back and filmed out of their own pockets:)",1336003200,,136,4.48
3581765,5,B001FB5TAY,One of my favorite shows that is now off the air. So grateful they put it out on DVD. Love it!,1318291200,,94,3.5238095238095237
3581766,5,B001FB5TAY,"This is really an amazing show, it is too bad that it got cancelled so early on...!  I purchased the 1st season and was immediately hooked so I then rushed to get the 2nd season... Funny, Heartfelt, and witty writing... and appropriate for all viewers ... LOVE IT !!!",1304380800,,267,4.448979591836735
3581777,5,B001FB5TAY,"I have been waiting on October Road for a while and I was so glad when I came on Amazon and found October Road on it and how quickly it came to me, when I order it. I was so glad when I got it that I watch it three time, right off the back. Thank you for being very quick on the order. October Road is a very good show and I hate that it was stop. I do however wish that when they decided to add the ending to the show it should have been part of the episodes instead of the bonus features. It was great and I'm happy about. Thank you",1301961600,,534,3.652173913043478
3581778,5,B001FB5TAY,"I was so disappointed when the station removed October Road from their line-up, especially when there was no ending. I was thrilled to learn that in this set there was a final episode that put everthing into prospective. Glad I ordered it....ending was worth it.",1299974400,,262,4.844444444444444
3581779,5,B001FB5TAY,"Loved the show, sorry it was cancelled. Got the Season 2 because it had the wrap-up mini episode. The episode wasn't the greatest but it at least let us know the answers to all the questions that we wondered about.",1295740800,,214,4.375
3581780,2,B001FB5TAY,"October Road was great under the first season but the second just did not live up to the par it set itself. Cast is great, loved how the got the dad more involved. But the show knew the result the audience wanted and they didn't give it to them. It was frustrating. I didn't feel the closure, it had more depressing moments than happy and in the beginning of the season they were on a great path and then it plummeted when they left that path. The writers had so much potential and it could have been very successful but they were trying to create too much drama in too little of a time.",1292112000,,587,4.157894736842105
3581781,5,B001FB5TAY,Absolutely loved this dvd what a shame there was never a third season. You get to see the ending as you never do unless you buy this dvd. Great story and fabulous characters watched it over and over. A great buy.,1288396800,,212,4.195121951219512
3581782,5,B001FB5TAY,"October Road, we hardly knew you.  Great music choices for the background, nice locations in Monrovia, CA; a quirky yet likeable bunch of people.  What went wrong?  Nielsons, probably.  That is usually the case when a nice little show gets the boot so early.  I am going to miss Physical Phila and Pizza girl.  Will Hannah ever figure out that Big Cat is not the one for her?  Will Owen forgive Ikey?  Will Nick write another book?  Will his dad overcome his illness?  We will never know, unfortunately.",1275177600,,503,4.613636363636363
3581783,5,B001FB5TAY,I loved this show and wanted to view the last episode and tie up all loose ends! Great finish!,1272931200,,94,4.0
3581784,4,B001FB5TAY,"This is a show that was killed by the incompetent scheduling of ABC. If they would have put it in, left it on and let it build an audience it would still be on.
That describes many shows.",1262131200,,187,3.9473684210526314
3581785,3,B001FB5TAY,Just discovered the show like many when one hasn't had a TV in awhile. The cast is good and they all do journeymen work but the story is such predictable hollywood  fair. it would have been much more true to life AND interesting if the Nick Garrett  character had come back to indifference from his old cadre of pals and they in fact had all moved on without him.  and Come on! with the old girl friend bit! jeesh! i can't imagine my old girl friends from  10 or 15 years ago pining away for me and all it would take is a brief encounter to reboot the relationship. if i thought all my past relationships were stuck in some form of stasis i'd be creeped out. people do grow up and move on.,1261526400,,689,4.119402985074627
3581786,5,B001FB5TAY,"Too bad October Road was cancelled on tv. This was one of the best shows ever. The DVD is worth every penny! As a follower of this show, I had to know the ending, which was never shown on tv. I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who enjoys good, clean entertainment.",1255910400,,267,4.153846153846154
3581787,5,B001FB5TAY,"Though this little show was savaged by the critics and the incurably hip, it was, for it's fans, a feel-good trip to a beautiful little town with people who were fun to be with.  The soap-opera tenor of the plots didn't seem to matter as much when the cast was so engaging, and the sets and scenery so beautiful.  This was a must-see show for a (too small, apparently) devoted cadre of fans.  Though it has been lost to us, we have these dvd's to keep us warm!  I can see taking my occasional foray back down ""October Road"" several times in the upcoming years.  The things that make you love it are timeless. Oh!... and lest I forget!  The producers added a 20 minute ""wrap-up"" of various loose ends left hanging at the show's cancellation. Although not fleshed out to episode-quality, it was a thoughtful gesture on the part of the producers towards the loyal followers of ""The Road"".",1254700800,,885,4.5
3581788,5,B001FB5TAY,"I loved the show when it was on the air! I bought the season so I could find out who Sams father really was. I love that they did a series wrap up on the dvd, I do however wish the wrap up was the length of an episode instead of just ten min.",1254268800,,242,3.5
3581789,5,B001FB5TAY,"I was so happy to FINALLY see the 2nd season of October Road come out on DVD. It was great to see this show again. I MISS the show and was EXTREMELY disappointed when it was cancelled. I don't think it was given enough time on the air and feel ABC should have tried much harder to keep it going longer. Like so many other fans of the show we all felt a big loss, especially since it left us hanging with unfinished storylines. Season 2 did have a ""very quick scene"" answering the question about Sam's father. Although I was very happy to see this, I still felt cheated regarding the other stories. Watching this again was both exciting as well as frustrating because it makes me miss it even more! At least it's available to buy so we can watch it and I'm thankful for that.
A NOTE TO ABC: FANS OF THIS SHOW WANT IT TO COME BACK !!",1248998400,,831,4.135802469135802

3581791,4,B001FB5TAY,"I loved October Road when it came out.  Such great music to go along with a story that kept my attention.  I was hugely disappointed in the ten minute wrap up but, I guess when your show is cancelled and you are producing on your own dime you keep it short.  If you like this you would also like Life on Mars.  Another Applebaum show that did not last but, the ending was wrapped to perfection.",1246320000,2,394,4.144736842105263
3581792,5,B001FB5TAY,"This show was terminated to soon; Season 2 had great episodes, however the extra episode to clean up the series was way to short, it should have been a lot longer and it didn't tie up all of the loose ends.  Over all loved the show.",1245628800,,232,4.043478260869565

3581794,5,B001FB5TAY,I really liked this series and it is a shame that they have cancelled it. You were able to see the different sides of life in a small town.,1243987200,,139,3.8275862068965516
3581795,5,B001FB5TAY,"Well worth the money to finally see the 15 minute conclusion and find out, ""Who is Sam's father""?  They could have given a little more detail, but still worth the closure to all October Road Fans. I recommend watching the last episode before watching the 15 minute conclusion, just to get yourself up to speed on the last episode.",1242604800,,330,4.593220338983051

Ok I received them both and had an October Road marathon to be able to watch the 10 minute wrap up....made me miss the show more than before...watch the 10 minute wrap up and go on...watching it all over again only makes you want it back even more!!!  LOL  Because even tho wrap up answers the major questions it cannot take the place of the process..",1241568000,12,624,4.391304347826087
8301774,5,B001FB5TAY,"This show was recommended to me as I'm a HUGE Gilmore Girls fan.  I did enjoy October Road enough to watch both seasons.  Wish it had more of a finale, but it was a pleasant show to watch.  I have to say one of the best parts??  The awesome music.  I got some great tunes just from watching the show!",1514419200,,300,3.933333333333333

8301776,3,B001FB5TAY,"I thought, mistakenly, this series had some mise-en-scne linkage (location, characters, etc.) to Scott Rosenbergs earlier script, Beautiful Girls. Both October Road and Beautiful Girls are set in the fictional town of Knights Ridge, Massachusetts. Although similarities seem to end there, October Road is still worth a look, though.",1487030400,,332,5.795918367346939
