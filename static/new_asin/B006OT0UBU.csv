8502325,3,B006OT0UBU,"Formed in 1982, Jettisoundz video label marked the beginning of the video era for dozens of independent bands. This DVD contains 50 promo videos from various bands during the labels tenure. It has been rumored that there will be a second volume, but this has not come to pass yet. As for this DVD, it reminds me of the very early days of MTV, when cheap camera gimmicks and live looking videos were the way to go. If you're interested in guerrilla film-making, and you have a taste for indie and U.K. punk bands, this DVD will be very addictive. More mainstream music lovers won't find a lot to cheer about here.
