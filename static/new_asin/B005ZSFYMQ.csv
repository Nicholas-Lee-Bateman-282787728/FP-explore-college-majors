4911383,5,B005ZSFYMQ,"This is a nice video with lots of good stories that contain lessons regarding animal/insect facts/proper care, etc, along with the usual life lessons this series touches on. Mr. Perkins is the host, and my little girl loves him. He is her version of Mr. Rogers. Certainly worth the price.",1334793600,,288,4.78
4911384,5,B005ZSFYMQ,These Thomas the Train stories are always interesting and entertaining. They are action packed which keeps the interest of the viewer focused on the story. The characters often make bad decisions and have to pay the penalty for the resulting situations but everything always works out in the end and the characters have learned an important lesson.,1331164800,2,348,5.12280701754386

4911386,4,B005ZSFYMQ,"My 2.5 year old son loves this movie!  It's not a full movie--it's 4 Thomas episodes with a story in between.  The movie opens with an engine driver ""Perkins"" entering the Knapford Engine Drivers Common Room.  Sir Topham Hatt calls and informs Perkins that he will be coming to inspect the station.  Perkins begins cleaning the messy station in preparation for the inspection.  This is the running story in between episodes (these mostly center around Perkins cleaning TOO quickly and making a bigger mess in his rush).

Episodes:
Thomas' Tall Friend
Percy's New Friends
Toby and Bash
Big Belle

These are all upbeat and cheerful episodes, so they are enjoyable to watch. I rated it 4 stars because I was expecting a full feature film and just the first episode had anything to do with the animals pictured on the cover. It was still a cute DVD and worth what I paid for it.",1327881600,15,874,4.636363636363637

4911404,5,B005ZSFYMQ,"This is a collection of several (somewhat) related episodes of the ""Thomas & Friends"" TV show. Total running time is right at 1 hour, but that includes several intro and outro title sequences. My grandson has heard those songs so many times from watching these collections that he sings them as he's walking around pretending to be a steam engine.

If you have a child in your home who loves Thomas & Friends as much as my grandson, these videos are perfect. Being able to stream them free is more than worth the cost of the Prime membership...we watch at least one of these per day.",1383696000,,583,4.5
