8679890,3,B00NS3TN54,"Warner Baxter is a film star generally forgotten today but he was a big name in the 1930s and an Academy Award Winner in 1929.  Probably best known for ""42nd Street"", for the discerning viewer, there is much more to discover but it is not easy to find his films.  ""I'll give a Million"" was made in 1938 when Baxter was nearing the end of his long term contract with 20th Century Fox.  He was no longer a young man, almost 50 years of age.

The film is a charming comedy set in France concerning a millionaire who adopts the guise of a hobo to purge himself of the shallow set with whom he has been existing.  There is a rich assortment of supporting players including Peter Lorre, Fritz Feld, Jean Hersholt and J. Edward Bromberg, all of whom contribute to the continental flavour of the light weight farce. Marjorie Weaver plays the leading lady and her southern American accent grates but she plays with vitality and warmth. But at the heart of the film is Warner Baxter, always in character, completely convincing as a man of depth who is disillusioned with his life.  He is a charming.

The film is hard to find but the print I located was very good.",1451692800,,1154,4.415094339622642
