8206598,5,B000SSNRI6,"Randy Topham is a master. Learning from him in this video series has been incredibly helpful to my development as a stylist. Learning how to cut hair for clients that want shorter cuts that are versatile and easy to style has been a bit of a challenge, and this video has been a great help.

The hair cutting techniques used in this video have helped me to achieve better results and I've also picked up on some things that have helped me create cuts that can be styled in a variety of ways; something I thought was reserved for longer cuts.

The cut and color techniques are different from many of the things that I personally learned during my cosmetology training. The coloring techniques especially were really intriguing and keep my clients looking better between visits.

If you're a newer stylist or just want a new perspective, I highly recommend this video.",1430265600,,866,4.684210526315789
8206599,5,B000SSNRI6,Training staff on short cuts in our salon has never been easier! Two easy to follow short cuts showing some great technique for both hair cutting and hair colouring. Some people aren't as competent when it comes to performing short hair cuts and this DVD makes it looks so easy. Particularly love the part where it demonstrates the colour blocking technique and also the use of the razor to achieve feather edges for a soft and chic finish. Love it and will be recommending this to my friends!,1415491200,,493,4.613636363636363
