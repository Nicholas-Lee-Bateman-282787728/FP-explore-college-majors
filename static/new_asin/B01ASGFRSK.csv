8748169,2,B01ASGFRSK,"I really, really wanted this dvd for my big screen TV so that I could pretend that I was on vacation.  It had the exact type of waves that I was looking for, more of a crashing, meditative type.  It would be exactly what I wanted but it only works on my computer.  So I can pretend to be on vacation while I am working but that is not the effect that I was going for.  Keeps me calmer though.  If it actually worked on a regular dvd player, I would have given it 4 1/2 stars.  Half a star removed because you cannot choose just wave sound or with music.  Music is ok but not always wanting this effect.",1495411200,,602,3.966666666666667
