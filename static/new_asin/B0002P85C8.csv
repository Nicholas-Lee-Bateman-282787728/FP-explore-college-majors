8030253,3,B0002P85C8,"I bought this DVD for my parents for Christmas since they will be moving down there in the next 6 months.  Unfortunately, there was no description for what this DVD entailed.  We all watched it together and it was basically filmed in the 80's.  Needs updating and it didn't cover any of the areas I have been to. (west palm beach area, Sarasota area).  I would not recommend this.",1198972800,,380,4.463768115942029
