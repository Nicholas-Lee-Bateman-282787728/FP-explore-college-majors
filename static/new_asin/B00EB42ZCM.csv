8603404,5,B00EB42ZCM,"This is a terrific film, I first saw Box! on a plane to Japan 4 years ago and have been looking for a copy with English Subtitles since. There's are few bad boxing movies but Box! is in the top echelon of boxing films. The performances are terrific as is the direction. Highly recommended for any Boxing fan.",1415318400,,308,4.327586206896552
