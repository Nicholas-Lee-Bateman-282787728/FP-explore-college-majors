8658095,5,B00KEC7LCE,"In this DVD you get to know the new and particularly the old Singapore while exercising. In some moderate movement speed, it goes first through the newer Singapore. You walk along the water and can marvel at the modern skyscrapers. Then you make a trip to the older side of Singapore with its special flair. At dusk and in the dark you can run or walk through the streets past the hustle and bustle of people. You pass road bars or shops, all of which are beautifully lit in the darkness and there is a lot of activity, but some streets are almost deserted. As with all Virtual Walks DVDs you can hear the sounds of the surroundings so I always had the feeling that I am actually there. A great DVD that shows many different sides of Singapore.",1441843200,,744,4.359712230215828

In case you do your treadmill, etc in the afternoon it just don't feel right.",1416096000,,151,4.206896551724138

8658098,5,B00KEC7LCE,"Like most of the Ambient collection of workout DVDs, you have a choice of three excursions, averaging 20 minutes each---or you can just let the journey continue for a continuous one hour walk on the treadmill or spin bike through an exotic locale that really takes you away. Singapore is truly a multicultural city. You really get a feel for that as you pass through Chinese, Arab, and Indian communities, each with their own unique architectural contributions. You can almost smell the curry wafting from the side street restaurants. The journey begins, on tape one, along a waterfront, with high rise buildings reflected by the water on your right. You get the idea that the city planners had joggers in mind as the park penetrates into the city. There is plenty of room for you, even though you're in downtown Singapore. It turns into night at the end of tape one: the sky scrapers appear to float on the dark water glittering with night lights.

On tape two, the journey into the night continues, often through unfamiliar back streets through ethnic neighborhoods. Yet you feel safe: others walk alone unconcerned, and there is no graffiti anywhere. [Isnt this the place where you can be jailed for dropping a gum wrapper on the street?] The darkness is suddenly transformed by the Festival of Lights in the part of town known as Little India.

On the final excursion, you continue to explore the city at night. I almost felt that I was in a mystery movie, searching for someone on the back streets. One really neat feature for you bicyclists are the rickshaw athletes, who peddle through the streets pulling a cart laden with tourists marveling at the buildings and temples. I was on my spin bike at the time, and I really got into the scene.

This is another great workout video from the pros at Ambient that you can add to your imaginary photo album of world wide exercise vacations.
