8284138,2,B001BPJJ0U,"I have always been a big fan of George Montgomery and indeed the good/villan Leo Gordon. It starts out as an interesting premise but slowly
gets lost in the unfulfilled script. Some of the portrayals are quite good but never reach any culmination. Clay's nursing his eye a few times,
only leaves untold issues and pain. It is just there without any clarification. Relationship between former Love and close friend stirs the pot and only leaves a void. The ending with Flytrap is juvenile in the extreme. No threads are ever tied. The movie simply leaves the audience wondering what
all the fuss was about. House Peters does the best acting and character development in the whole production.
The Idea was probably good at first script reading but the final outcome is a C-Movie at best.",1457395200,,785,4.779411764705882
8284139,5,B001BPJJ0U,"Though not long and filmed in black and white, this 1957 Western has a surprisingly complex psychological layering to it, and might even be called Western-noir.  Clay Morgan (George Montgomery) is Town Marshal of Santa Rita, NM, an office he discharges ably despite the fact that he lost his right eye in the Civil War.  He's hero-worshipped by 18-year-old orphan Carl (Tom Pittman), called ""Flytrap"" by the local bullies, who works as a general swamper at the hotel but asks regularly when Clay will make him a deputy.  Then to town comes Hank Danner (perpetual screen heavy Leo Gordon, who also wrote the script) and his wife Helen (Diane Brewster)--who long ago was Clay's love and is dismayed to find him there.  Soon after, a visit from an out-of-territory sheriff (Ted Jacques) and deputy (Strother Martin) establishes that Danner is suspected of having stolen $40,000 from their bank.  Clay arrests his friend but finds no sign of the money on him--and won't allow the lawmen to take him home without having their warrant certified at the county seat.  While the sheriff is off getting that done, saloon owner Frenchy de Vere (Sebastian Cabot) arranges for Danner's escape on condition that he get 50% of the money.  Danner provides directions to its hiding place, is given back his half and a gun, and overpowers Clay only to be shot in the back in the dark street outside.  Searching the body, Clay finds the money and hides it before anyone can see.  He knows Danner didn't have it before, and why would anyone pay a man to break jail unless he also killed the law in the process?  So, clearly, Danner was set up.  And even though he was a bank robber, he was once Clay's friend, and Clay feels an obligation to him--and to Helen--to learn who was behind his death.  Unfortunately most of the town thinks that Clay was the killer--and Carl, shocked and disillusioned, is practicing obsessively with Danner's gun, which Helen has given him as a present.  His plan is to call Clay out for Danner's death.  Meanwhile Clay is trying to learn the truth, and Frenchy is working away in the background to get him out of the way.  I found this a very satisfying movie--not big on action, but well-paced and -crafted, like a good novel.",1455840000,,2237,4.7

8284143,4,B001BPJJ0U,"Warner Bros. Pictures presents ""BLACK PATCH"" (1957) (82 min/B&W) -- Starring George Montgomery, Diane Brewster, Tom Pittman, Leo Gordon & Sebastian Cabot

Directed by Allen H. Miner

One-eyed marshal Clay ""Black Patch"" Morgan (Montgomery) is delighted to find out that his old buddy Hank Danner (Leo Gordon) is riding into town, but less than thrilled to learn that Danner is now a wanted outlaw. Reluctantly throwing his friend into jail, Morgan sets off a chain reaction of terror, beginning with a jailbreak engineered by crooked saloonkeeper Frenchy De Vere (Sebastian Cabot) and culminating in a showdown between the marshal and Danner's young protg Flytrap (Tom Pittman).

George Montgomery both produced and starred in the psychological B&W western Black Patch which was penned by co-star Leo Gordon

Montgomery and Gordon interact with great chemistry, varying between friendship and jealousy.

In this film, Leo Gordon is a scene stealer playing a more sympathetic and well-rounded sort of cowpoke.  Gordon was one of the great western villains and a pretty decent writer of scripts, many of them were classics.

Special footnote: -- This film scored by Jerry Goldsmith who was in his late twenties, who would go on to score top films of the time. Such as Planet Of The Apes, Papillon, Chinatown, The Omen, Alien, Medicine Man, Total Recall, Basic Instinct, L.A. Confidential and The Wind and the Lion. Goldsmith's characteristic style is unmistakable, not yet the sound we've come to appreciate.
