2418060,3,B000BITUYI,"they really need to release seasons and not just a best of...... if they are afraid of only releasing the b&w seasons for a few years of releases.... they could do a simultaneous color and black and white releases.... and meet in the middle......

i'd like that myself as alot of the best episodes are the color ones from the more anthology like years of the show..... great ron bishop stuff..... things like Lynott....

now for the picture/video quality... :(

its really not up to snuff...... the sad thing is i know its not the original source thats the problem.... cause i saw a bunch of episodes in german (dont ask :)  color episodes and they were PRISTINE, unbelievably beautiful prints...... these aren't as blurry as tvlands prints.... but they are pretty close..... :(

if they do decide to start releasing season sets..... hopefully they find some better sources :(",1136764800,10,876,4.8133333333333335
2418061,3,B000BITUYI,"This set has its good points and its bad points.

The picture quality is outstanding as well as the audio; much better than TV Land.  The special features are nice as well. I also really liked the audio commentary from not only James Arness and Dennis Weaver, but actors like Angie Dickinson and Bruce Dern. There is another subtle feature to the episodes that I liked.  The episodes on TV Land are edited more than you realize.  There are small snippets throughout the show that are edited out, usually a delayed glance here or there.  No big deal really but they can have a powerful emotional impact to the story.  I first noticed it on ""The Wrong Man"" with Carroll O'Connor.  When Hootie leaves the Long Branch and his sons are trying to tell him that he has no more credit at the general store, there is a knowing delay by O'Connor as well as a glance to his other son which to me was powerful in setting the tone for the rest of the episode. But it is cut out of the tv version, which I have recorded on VHS.

My main complaint which overrides most of the positives is with the episodes selected.  Some are good but there's a long list of much better episodes that were ignored or not selected for a reason.  I, like many others want to see the entire series put out season by season or bundled.  I for one will gladly buy them all.",1136505600,89,1337,4.286852589641434
2418062,5,B000BITUYI,I urge fans of this show to buy this because judging by the episode list of this set and the extras it seems to truly be a best of release.  I am so glad Paramount is doing this because they seem to be proud of the shows they put on dvd. And I believe these are not double-sided dvds.  Awesome!!  Keep it up Paramount!!!,1136073600,7,320,3.96875
2418063,3,B000BITUYI,"Look, I know ""Gunsmoke"" ran 20 years and filmed 636 or so episodes, but cant we still get a full season-by-season DVD in motion?

This ""50th Anniversary Edition"" looks to be chock full of extras, and that's great, but it's another ""compilation"" collection, with just a few espisodes here and there from the series' run.

And if we're lucky enought to GET a full seasonal DVD release on ""Gunsmoke"" (finally), will these same wonderful extras still be available on those??

I am NOT excited about this middling tossed-together package--- no matter how many interviews and commentaries it has... Yes, I WANT those extras, but with a full episodic collection to go with them!",1135987200,280,671,4.920353982300885

More time is needed for me to advance through the entire set to find out if, as was the case with the original set, the interruptions start lasting for much longer than a few seconds - until one get so long that the DVD player shuts down.

2418323,5,B000BITUYI,This was a birthday gift for my husband who is an avid Gunsmoke watcher.  The boxed set was a great gift as it has a vast collection of episodes ranging from the 1950's into the 1970's.

2418325,5,B000BITUYI,"Aw, c'mon guys and gals!  Get a perspective.  MOST of us might want simply to see a few episodes ""here and there.""  We are not complete-ists, and my hunch is, the producers--or owners of this copyright--know this.  They're after the broadest possible audience.  (""Gee, Myrtle, here it is in one handy package...kind of the ""best of"", ya know?  Let's buy it...)

Suits me, especially if it is a reasonable overview of new and old episodes, so I get to see Doc and Kitty age gracefully and see Chester and whateverthehell they named the blacksmith in a more recent run.

Now, if the producers--or owners--were really smart, they'd know this (and probably do), so get set!  Season-by-season might be coming your way...but boy, are you gonna pay!  (""Order all seasons in advance and earn a ""Special 10% discount over the individual purchase price!"")

2418438,4,B000BITUYI,"While I understand people wanting season sets and all (and now they're getting them), the company was probably releasing collections like this to ""test the waters"" to make sure there was enough interest to warrant season sets. Apparently, there was. One of the great things about this set is it lets you track the evolution of the show, and could be a good guide to which season sets you might be interested in. For me, the later, hour-long episodes are better (I thought the opposite would be true). I had never seen any of the black and whites before...they are good, but the really early ones (half-hour) don't have much appeal to me. In the hour-long shows, even the black and white ones, they wrap up the ending with Matt and the person he saved or was gunning for, have a ""moment"" which really helps the show. Until the final black and white season, that great, familiar theme music also is not there...well, maybe a plodding version of it. That may seem like a nuance, but I think it's important. This set only includes a couple of episodes with Burt Reynolds as Quint Asper. I would like to have at least one more, he was very good in the role. But overall, this is a nice collection. It is overpriced (nearly $2 per episode) for an old show, but a fun splurge. If coupled with the Director's Collection, that probably fills in some holes too. I'm thinking about buying that too, although I'll probably skip the First Season set. This is one of those shows they should have started releasing season sets in the middle then work their way out in both directions, since the middle of the series seems to hold the most interest. ADDITIONAL INFO: With the switch to color episodes in this set (the ""syndicated"" or ""TV Land"" episodes), it appears that most of them are taken from videotape copies rather than going back to the original film elements. I didn't notice it on my old TV, but since I switched to HD, it's very apparent. While the black and whites are really clear, the color episodes are comparatively fuzzy, and at least one has garbled sound (the William Shatner episode). There are also abrupt fade-ins and fade-outs on at least one,which the original films wouldn't have had (but TV Land does). Still nice to have, but HD reveals a lot of problems that shouldn't be present.",1184284800,2,2293,4.595121951219512

2418477,5,B000BITUYI,"CBS produced Gunsmoke as one of TV's early run at continuing characters where there was action mixed in with a good story line.  Gunsmoke was, I think one of their best TV ""Adult Westerns"".  In the 50's westerns were a staple of all the major networks.  For CBS TV Gunsmoke was well produced as well as many great guest stars who became big stars in their own right.  Their star James Arness fit his role perfectly, as he was not flashy but down to earth and was cast right in this role.  I give this DVD a 5 Star rating and recommend to the public who like westerns that Gunsmoke, the 50th Anniversary is a good one to add to one's DVD collection.",1154304000,8,648,4.235772357723577

Murray Christmas"" included in this 50th anniversay edition is a cut version like that shown on TV Land with 10 minutes of the actual show cut out.  This set is maybe good for anyone who has never seen these epsiodes before but not nearly enough for a true Gunsmoke fan.

2418481,5,B000BITUYI,"That's not hyperbole. I mean it. I have never seen a better TV boxed set. This is the standard that all other series boxed sets should be measured against. I've said this before and I will say it again --  Paul Brownstein is the best producer of boxed sets in the business. Hands-down. His love of television is obvious, especially in this set. The prints are terrific, the menus are clever and vibrant, and he goes out of his way to jam-pack this set with amazing, rare, and informative supplemental material. This set includes behind-the-scenes home movies from Dennis Weaver, appearances from James Arness and Dennis Weaver on THE ED SULLIVAN SHOW, an Amanda Blake interview on the MIKE DOUGLAS SHOW, Emmy Award appearances by the cast,  network promos, interviews from The Western Channel, a video of a  GUNSMOKE retrospective held at the Museum of Broadcasting, promos, bloopers, and a huge number of audio commentaries... and I'm only scratching the surface of what's offered. I could quibble about some of the episodes selected -- which seem to favor name guest-stars over the best written, plotted and executed stories -- but that's minor. Buy this set. You won't be sorry.

This week, I bought his  THE WILD WILD WEST boxed set and, once again, he's done incredible work. The set includes all the usual extras and so much more, like audio tracks from the original scoring sessions for the main title theme with alternate versions and aborted takes (a rare find which is worth the price of the set alone),  the original pilot main title sequence, network promos, and audio interviews with the composer, various writers,  the studio casting exec, special effects person. It's a TV fan's wet dream.

I much enjoyed reminiscing with the episodes selected here.  All in all, these seemed like good choice, often featuring guest stars who later became widely known--Leonard Nimoy, Dennis Hopper, John Voigt, Ad Asner among them.

2418504,4,B000BITUYI,"I was happy to see this set come out. I think that several releases of this type is the way to go on a show with 633 episodes and 20 seasons. If it was released one season at a time at about 1-2 seasons per year,it would take along time to get into the colour years which are my favorite episodes. If they didn't sell well the production may stop after the first 3 or 4 seasons, which can be had from columbia house anyway. This way we get a sampling from the whole series.

  The choice of colour episodes could have been better in my opinion. They seemed to be picked by who was in it rather than on a good story line. Some of my picks would have been Iron men, alias festus haggin,new doc in town,deadly innocent, and the ones with steve forrest like mannon, morgan, and the widowmaker.

  The extra features are nice, and it is great to hear jim Arness voice introducing each episode.

  I hope it sells well, so more sets are made in the future.",1138579200,4,950,4.175824175824176
2418525,4,B000BITUYI,"Before ""Gunsmoke"" became a comfy institution, it fought hard for its TV turf. The show's dramatic early success often is credited to its adult subject matter, unheard of in TV Westerns of the early 1950s. (The series ""is honest, it's adult, it's realistic,"" the Duke cautioned the first episode's audience.)

""Gunsmoke"" writers such as Sam Peckinpah and series co-creator John Meston had the freedom to tell tales of rape, slavery, thrill kills, child abuse and, of course, prostitution. A long way from Zorro and the Lone Ranger. This is the side of ""Gunsmoke"" a lot of people haven't seen, and it's on display here in volume 1.

Paramount's new sets -- by far the best ""Gunsmoke"" product out there -- go for the star power. DVD producer Paul Brownstein corralled episodes with such guest stars as Charles Bronson, Jon Voight, Richard Chamberlain, John Drew Barrymore, Leonard Nimoy, Kurt Russell and Jodie Foster.

The all-star approach yields a tree-ring view that wouldn't have been possible with greatest-hits collections. Some shows are definitely weaker than others, usually coinciding with one of the series' format changes. The writers, for example, didn't know what to do with all that extra time when the show went from 30 minutes to 60. There are plenty of terrific episodes, though, including star James Arness' favorites ""Chato"" (with Ricardo Montalban as a renegade Apache) and the charming comedy ""A Quiet Day in Dodge.""

Images range from excellent to barely passable. The black-and-white shows look a bit flat but are solid overall; there's surprisingly little wear, considering. Check out the noir-influenced lighting that revealed the evils of Dodge City after dark.

The color episodes from the mid-'60s show their age; two are borderline unwatchable. One of the stranger shows (""The Jailer"") feels like one of those old 3-D demos, with the actors dressed in bright colors and garish makeup -- like Fellini characters -- to demonstrate TV's new color palette. A bizarre performance by Bette Davis (highlighted by her blue eyes and green teeth) completes the experience. The DVDs' mono audio gets the job done -- dialog is clear, gunshots sharp.

The DVD sets' 11 commentaries include talks from guest stars Angie Dickinson, George Kennedy, Ed Asner and Bruce Dern. Arness, 82, provides two rewarding commentaries as well as short introductions to all of the episodes. Dennis Weaver (Chester) and Buck Taylor (Newly) also do talks. (Cast ""family members"" Amanda Blake, Milburn Stone (Doc) and Ken Curtis (Festus) all died before the DVD era.)

The generous collection of extras are spread about the six discs. Most are short, upbeat and nostalgic. Among the more interesting bits are two 1970s talk show appearances with Blake, who tells Mike Douglas she left the show because she ""couldn't take it anymore ... (being) locked in this saloon all these years."" A panel discussion with Blake and Arness was filmed in the year of her death, showing the actress frail and still ready to rumble. The sets lack a strong ""Gunsmoke"" documentary, a real missed opportunity.

(Interesting how Amazon spotlights reviews from people who haven't seen the product. This is far from a ""tossed together"" project. Buy with confidence.)",1138492800,5,3237,5.140684410646388
2418526,3,B000BITUYI,"Having just finished watching the entire collection, I come away a little disappointed.

First, there was at least one episode that had been edited.  The last scene of ""P.S. Murry Christmas"" was cut short.  After Kitty and Matt's famous peck on the cheek, you are supposed to hear a chorus singing ""God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen"" and  see a wide shot of Main Street while it's snowing.  The song and the shot of the street are missing, as are the last few seconds of Matt and Kitty by the bar.  Did the editors of this collection find the Christmas carol too religous or something?  It really takes away from the original feel of the episode by omitting this scene.

Secondly, most of the commentaries are dull.  Perhaps the actors couldn't remember enough specifics about episodes they filmed over 30 or 40 years ago, but the fact remains that I didn't enjoy sitting through Bruce Dern's commentary on ""The Jailer"" as he rehashed his own career with little to say about Gunsmoke.  I also thought Jim Arness would have more to say about his fellow actors and the show in general. Some of the actors even admitted that this was their first viewing of the episode since it was filmed!  You'd think they'd watch it through once to help them recollect things and plan what they were going to say. I thought the best commentary was by Ed Asner, who despite his lack of screen time had the wittiest and best remembered anecdotes about Gunsmoke.  Barbara Eden and Angie Dickinson also did a pretty good job. I agree with an earlier reviewer who figured they picked episodes based on which ones had well-known actors who would agree to do commentaries. What a shame that so many wonderful episodes were excluded because of this!

This collection is still worth buying for the extras alone, especially Amanda Blake's two appearances on popular talk shows of the day (she looked surprisingly younger and prettier in real life), and Jim and Amanda at the Q&A session for the Museum of T.V. and Radio seminar.

I am a child of the 50's, and find that so much of what is currently on tv is not to my taste. Where can we write to ask that these great tv shows be put out on DVD.

Eighteen of the twenty seasons of Gunsmoke are represented by an episode or two. It's a wonderful journey as you travel through two decades of  Gunsmoke. You'll see this superb series grow and evolve along with its' cast; Matt, Kitty, Doc, Chester, Quint, Festus and Newly. Some of the selected episodes are humorous, some rich with dark overtones and some are Gunmoke 'family' centered. Overall, its a taste of what this ground breaking series offered over twenty years.

The extras alone are worth the price of the collection. There are great commentaries by James Arness, George Kennedy, Angie Dickenson and other guest stars, hilarious outtakes, and several interviews from talk shows with the cast members, a photo gallery and more.

Like others reviewers have mentioned, I only wish there would be additional collections offered by Paramount. I would love to hear commentaries by Morgan Woodward, Tom Skerritt, Julie Sommars and some other guest stars who appeared in numerous episodes of Gunsmoke. Full year collections with extras would be fabulous. All us fans of Gunsmoke just can't get enough!

2418531,3,B000BITUYI,"If only ""Gunsmoke, Volumes I and II"" would have been a complete season set.  The edition pales in comparison to the recent complete season sets of ""Have Gun, Will Travel"" and ""Wanted: Dead or Alive.""  In the aforementioned compilations, all 39 shows per season were included.  Also, so many quality episodes of ""Gunsmoke"" were left out.  With super characters actors such as R.G. Armstrong, Morgan Woodward, Pat Hingle, L.Q. Jones, Steve Forrest, and Dabbs Greer still very much around, it would have been great to hear their comments on the many episodes they were involved in.  In fact, Woodward, now living in the Dallas area, appeared in a record 19 ""Gunsmoke"" programs.  He even taught Jim Arness how to fly an airplane.  Hingle took Milburn Stone's place as town doctor for an entire season while Stone recovered from a heart attack.  Veteran heavy Leo Gordon, who died just recently, could have no doubt given some interesting feedback while this set was being put together on the first ""Gunsmoke"" actually filmed, ""Hack Prine.""  As it stands, the episodes included are in good shape with fine audio and video quality.  However, the various features included are all out of sync audio-wise -- there is almost a second delay in the dialogue.  The best clip is of Jim Arness appearing on the Ed Sullivan Show.  Arness, all 6'7 of him, towers over poor Ed.  I'm glad I purchased this set, but it honestly could have been so much more.  Hopefully complete season sets will be issued in the near future.",1138060800,29,1505,4.80544747081712
2418532,3,B000BITUYI,"Since a number of truly mediocre TV series have been released in complete season DVD sets, it boggles the mind to see that ""Gunsmoke,"" the longest running drama in TV history, has gotten comparatively shabby treatment.  Here we have a mish-mash of episodes from the show's various eras that have mostly been selected because of ""big name"" guest stars that appeared in them, not because they are the best in the series' 20-year run.  If CBS wanted to issue a ""selected episodes"" collection, they should have used better criteria than guest stars (some of whom aren't all that ""big"" anyway, including Angie Dickinson, Richard Chamberlain, Leonard Nimoy, Adam West, et al).  Moreover, most of these epiosodes have been issued on home video before.

Perhaps it is asking too much for CBS to issue the entire series on DVD, consisting of some 635 episodes (although they already have issued the first 3 1/2 seasons on 20 DVDs through their video club), but there are a number of better alternatives than this half-hearted effort.  They could issue DVDs with the best episodes of each season, or sets with the best of the show's several eras (half-hour and one-hour black and white shows, and one-hour color episodes), or entire seasons one at a time to see how well they do in the market place (they have already done 3 seasons worth of ""Have Gun - Will Travel"" this way).

Since this set is all that ""Gunsmoke"" fans are likely to get for some time, it will have to do (and is better than nothing; there are, after all, some interesting special features included).  Whether or not it is worth the asking price may depend on how many of the episodes you already have in your collection.  For many ""Gunsmoke"" fans, that may be a deal breaker.",1137542400,125,1735,4.702970297029703
2418533,5,B000BITUYI,"I was delighted to learn a few months back that Paramount was honoring CBS's longest-running drama with a special 50th anniversary DVD set. To celebrate Gunsmoke's 50th, they've compiled a handful of episodes from the show's 20-year run and added some very special ""specials.""  The commentaries from Jim Arness, Dennis Weaver and Buck Taylor are a real treat, but watching the shows with Barbara Eden, George Kennedy and other guest stars provided for a sweet walk down memory lane, as well. My favorites by far were the extras...bloopers, hard-to-find old TV interviews and behind-the-scenes home movies.  This collection has far and away exceeded my expectations, and I appreciate the efforts of all involved.  Happy anniversary, Gunsmoke! And thank you, Paramount.",1137456000,5,767,5.375
2418534,2,B000BITUYI,"I, like a number of fans would prefer a full release of all episodes. This ""best of"" set just makes that more clear. For those not aware, Columbia House produced 20 DVD's (each with 6 episodes) covering all episodes 1955-1959 about a year ago. Just like watching the original shows on TV without commercials. Each episode had some extras like production notes and guest cast comments. I have not heard anything since about later years being worked on. They are a must for all fans. I'll keep waiting for more full seasons.",1136937600,11,522,4.684782608695652
