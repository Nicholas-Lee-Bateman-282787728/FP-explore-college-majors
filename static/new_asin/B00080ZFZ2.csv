I grew up watching these as a seperate show & I think they are wonderful. But they were originally a part of the Rocky & Bullwinkle show, and they are included in those seasonal sets.  The number before the title is the Dudley Do-Right sequence number, not the Rocky Show number.

And for those of you who happen to own the season 1 and 2 DVDs that may contain some of these episodes there is an incentive to buying this DVD.  The special feature is the original Bullwinkle sock-puppet inroductions to the episodes.  A must have for any fan.",1117756800,31,730,5.2368421052631575

2256838,5,B00080ZFZ2,"All that I have to say is this: This show ( in my opinion) is better than the movie. this DVD has 15 episodes of the show. Every episode is just brimming with humor. Excellent voice casting makes this DVD worth watching. The movie was ok, but it just wasn't as good as the show.",1431820800,,278,4.072727272727272

2256840,4,B00080ZFZ2,"The Best of Dudley Do-Right, Vol. 1  was funny and wish ""Classic Media"" studios would finish Vol. 2 or make a complete dvd set of the series! DreamWorks Entertainment should consider reworking ""Dudley Do-Right"" into a updated cgi, full length, animated feature film like they did by with ""Mr. Peabody and Sherman"".",1416268800,,314,5.038461538461538

2256843,5,B00080ZFZ2,"This is fun old drama updated with crazy cartoons.  Dudley is clueless, and must be rescued by Nell much of the time. Meanwhile other characters are running their own agenda's creating wonderful confusion.",1396224000,,205,5.212121212121212

2256846,5,B00080ZFZ2,"It seems like a very, very long time ago that I first remember seeing this cartoon.  I can remember really laughing out loud even though I probably didn't understand the comedy.  When I found this DVD available I jumped at the chance to add it to my library and am very happy that I did.  The episodes are just as funny as I remember them being if not moreso because now I understand what is being said.  I highly recommend this DVD to any family who wants to enjoy some good, clean humour.  One of the best purchases I have made in quite some time.",1346889600,,549,4.190476190476191
2256847,4,B00080ZFZ2,I like this cartoon.  I remember it from the 1960's.  I wanted it becuse I decided to be Snidley Whiplash for Halloween.,1321228800,,120,4.409090909090909

2256850,5,B00080ZFZ2,"This volume was released in 2005. Where is Volume 2?
The beauty of these specific collections, as opposed to the Rocky and Bullwinkle sets, you get to watch one episode of Dudley after another. I love everything there is about the Dudley Do-Right episodes, but my favorite little ""joke"" is the ""played by"" classics seen in many of the episodes. The best ... Dudley played by Sid Gould. Dudley's horse played by Sid Gould's horse. Ya gotta laugh at that one ... especially if you know who Sid Gould was!
If you are a Dudley fan and you don't own this DVD shame on you!",1261699200,,567,4.40952380952381
2256851,4,B00080ZFZ2,This is an excellent collection from a classic cartoon.  The person who picked the shows did a good job.  One caution:  there is no closed captioning (and I wish there would have been).,1252713600,4,185,4.545454545454546

One to play in the background on the TV while the other was given away as a prize. Bought up some childhood memories, I appreciated the nostalgia.
