7997193,5,B0000AGQ1W,"This is the first Arthur DVD that I purchased for my kids, and after about 20 more, this is still our favorite.  The DVD contains ""Scare Your Pants Off,"" about kids' love of Goosebumps-type books, and the ramifications of lying to your parents; ""Friday the 13th,"" about science vs.  superstition, and ""The Boy Who Cried Coment,"" where our favorite worrywort, Buster, learns to apply science to his ""crazy theories"" to come up with the right answer.  We think its a great DVD to own.",1157241600,10,482,4.714285714285714
