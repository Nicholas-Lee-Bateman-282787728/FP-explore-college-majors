8672892,4,B00MKDWDSC,"I watched these movies growing up in the theatre back in Eindhoven, Netherlands. My sister and me were huge Winnetou and Old Shatterhand fans. Getting this box is bringing back memories. The DVD's are of good quality, the sound is as good as can be expected for 60-ies and 70-ies movies. Some movies are in German only and you need a PAL player for this. If you're a fan, well worth it",1524614400,,385,4.361111111111111
