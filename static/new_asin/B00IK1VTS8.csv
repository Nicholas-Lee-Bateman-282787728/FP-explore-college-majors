8642799,5,B00IK1VTS8,Excellent Ritz Brothers Movie!  Why aren't the other Ritz Brothers Movies on Amazon Video?,1510704000,,90,5.428571428571429
8642800,3,B00IK1VTS8,"""Sing Baby Sing"" is a funny fast paced programmer, the prototype of the Fox Musicals of the late thirties.  Daryl Zanuck took a snappy screenplay, often based on genuine situations, filled in with specialty acts and comedians with the charming Alice Faye in the lead and guaranteed box office gold.  This one has Adolphe Menjou satirising John Barrymore as a ham actor playing Romeo who discovers his Juliet, in reality a young woman named Elaine Barrie, but here nightclub performer Faye. The Ritz Brothers appear and are an acquired taste as usual but Patsy Kelly is very funny and has most of the good lines. Alice Faye does a parody of Shirley Temple with the title number but really hits a highspot with the song ""You Turned the tables on Me.""  She looks and sounds gorgeous. Future husband Tony Martin has one number and his song ""When did you Leave Heaven"" became a big hit.

The DVD has been issued in the Fox Cinema Archives series which means it is bare bones - no extras, no scene selection, no nothing.  The print is adequate.",1396915200,8,1038,4.619565217391305
8642801,5,B00IK1VTS8,"I've known the songs from this film for years because they are available on CD. I'm just happy to finally see the film.

I love Alice Faye and I'm SO very happy that Fox has finally seen the value in releasing some of her earlier films on DVD. Yes, there are people (like me!) who love this sort of film. We are just smallish in numbers so I can understand why they wouldn't mass market this DVD at some place like Wal-Mart.

Of course the plot is flimsy but that's not why you watch musicals! Alice is as delightful as ever. Also of note is Adolphe Menjou, who absolutely channels John Barrymore in his role of a drunken and slightly sketchy actor who is everything but a good actor. Patsy Kelly has the snappy one-liners and Tony Martin has a solo song.

Like all DVDs in the Fox Cinema Archives series - this is strictly bare bones: no chapter index, no fancy inserts, no commentaries, no trailers - just the movie.",1396656000,4,918,4.356725146198831
