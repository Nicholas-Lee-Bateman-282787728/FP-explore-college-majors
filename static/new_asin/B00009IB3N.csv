7990726,5,B00009IB3N,Just like part 1 a must for every drummer. Again some of the greatest drummers show there talent.,1190592000,,97,4.444444444444445
7990727,1,B00009IB3N,"Vol. 1 was good. This 2nd Vol is HORRIBLE. You wouldn't even know that this volume was about ""drumming"" if it wasn't for the title of it.

Not even worth wasting my time typing about it anymore.......",1137801600,3,200,4.405405405405405
7990728,1,B00009IB3N,"I bought this on the satisfaction of the first volume alone. I made a big mistake. If you want to see great drumming, I highly recommend you buy the first volume.

If you want an unknown cover band with world class drummers who aren't given solos (just extended fills), then this is the DVD for you. There is very little actual drumming highlighted in this video. The best drumming is actually not shown so they could feature a voodoo scene. The Clark Brothers TAP routine was quite refreshing but failed to resurrect this purchase.
I've rated it ONE star because ZERO was not an option.",1060041600,10,587,4.59047619047619
