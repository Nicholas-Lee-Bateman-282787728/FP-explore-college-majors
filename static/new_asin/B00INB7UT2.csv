6282284,3,B00INB7UT2,"Complicated, well-plotted story of post-war corruption in Copenhagen is ultimately let down by unsympathetic characters who are all compromised in one way or another. Acting, sets, production are all fine but the grainy color palette used is overdone. The plot follows an ambitious young journalist, Bjarne Madsen from a Social Democratic newspaper who wants to be a crime reporter. When two bodies without faces wash up on a beach, he barges into the scene stepping on the toes of the paper's  established crime reporter, H. C. Vissing, who never seems to ask too many questions. As Madsen continues to push for the truth, Vissing reluctantly assists him, all the while warning of the deepening danger they are unravelling. Organized crime, police, big business and politicians are intertwined with former Resistance fighters in the corruption. Too many of the characters are unsympathetic and one of the few likeable one's is Madsen's brother Ole who makes one bad choice after another which further drive the plot. The story starts slowly but builds more interest with the second episode. What led me to a lower score  was that Madsen sacrificed so much, for so long only to make one last sacrifice that doesn't entirely ring true. Through over five hours of mayhem and crime, Madsen exercises free will but at the end succumbs to determinism. Almost all of the positive observations and insights from other reviewers are true, but for me, the ending colored my judgement. For parents there is very little nudity or swearing but this non-smoking viewer was caught off-guard by the amount of cigarettes smoked; and there's lots of drinking , generally right from the bottle!",1412553600,,1676,5.068840579710145

6282286,2,B00INB7UT2,"Yuck!  This series manages to be predictable as to ""who done it"", boring in its sentimental moments, tasteless in its depiction of debauchery (easy women at parties), and indiscriminate in its depiction of corruption (the entire police force is corrupt, minus one man -- and that one drinks too much).

The ""idealistic young journalist (22 years old) is so nave that he does not even suspect what is obvious to the viewer right from the start (sorry I can't be more explicit:  I don't want to ruin it for other potential viewers).  The ""captivating diva"" is the spoiled daughter of the police chief; she has a very coarse complexion and certainly looks much older than both the journalist and his brother; there is also something vulgar about her (for a girl supposed to be from a ""good family"").  The mother of the two young men keeps sewing and offering to make coffee, but she is not too worried about her elder son's past, his frequentations or where he got his money.  Apart from the two journalists (one young, one old), practically everybody is ""on the take"" or ""on the game"" or corrupt in some other way.  They also drink a lot,  mostly straight from the bottle.  I assume that is what passes for ""atmosphere"".

The plot and the characters would be just right for a comic book, where nuances are not expected.  As a TV series it is neither ""stylish"", nor ""exquisitely intricate"".  Just plain dumb, disgusting and, at times, boring.

If you have money to spend, any of the following would be better than this:  The Killing, Wallander, Beck, or Arne Dahl as Nordic Noir series;  The Octopus, Montalbano, Fog and Crimes (series 1 and 2 only), and The Homicide Squad, all in Italian;  Maigret (all movies - French provincial and Parisian); Spiral (all 4 seasons - French ""noir""); Brunetti in German.",1409616000,7,1803,4.712460063897764

6282289,5,B00INB7UT2,"Set in the 1940s, THE SPIDER follows the life, loves, and career choices the min character is forced to make as he builds a name for himself as a crime reporter for a socialist democratic newspaper in Scandanavia.",1400284800,9,213,4.631578947368421
6282290,4,B00INB7UT2,"THE SPIDER is an intriguing, almost entirely satisfying Danish mini-series that originally aired in 2000. Why it has taken so long to be released in North America is anyones guess, but better late than never.

Intensely atmospheric, with great attention paid to period detail, this lovingly-produced 6 part series (on 3 DVDs) gets better and better as it unfolds, embracing all the implied intricacies of a spiders web. With each entanglement the story becomes more satisfying, leading to a pay off that is realistic though perhaps not as neatly tucked together as some North American viewers might like or be used to.

If there are any false notes to be found in this series they are few and far between, with one notable exception being the set of Johs, a jazz club, that looks like it was made of cardboard. This is the only exception to an otherwise beautiful, noir-ish atmosphere that almost has you expecting Robert Mitchum to appear out of the shadows.

The story takes awhile to really pick up steam, but what holds the series together (apart from the almost perfect art direction and production values) is the galaxy of outstanding performances. Often when watching shows from another country, the absence of familiar faces can both enhance and detract from the effectiveness of the whole. Enhancement comes from the lack of familiarity with the actors, thus providing a freshness and believability with the characters. This can detract if the characterizations are too many and/or under-developed. Fortunately, that is not the case here. Every character is beautifully drawn and executed and wholly believable within the period setting. Only one actor was familiar to this reviewer, who played a supporting role in the superior Danish series Borgen, but his performance here, as one of the few uncorrupted police investigators, is totally different from the role he played in that classic series.

MHz Networks has a commitment to providing first-rate mysteries and dramas from Europe that challenge the very best that TV has to offer. THE SPIDER is an excellent example of programming that can hold its own with anything to be found on HBO or AMC.

True, one has to be willing to embrace the reality of English subtitles, but this is easily accommodated with a little practice and is far superior to dubbing into English, which in this reviewers opinion, never quite looks right. If the series is set in Denmark, then the characters should be speaking Danish (which they do). Subtitling merely makes these excellent programs accessible to a wider audience.

Well done MHz. There is a definite need for quality programming like THE SPIDER. Gangsters, jazz, the aftermath of war-time loyalties and intrigues, obsession, love, familial angst and much, much more, THE SPIDER will draw you in and keep you guessing right to the end.",1397433600,14,2838,5.040511727078891
8643576,4,B00INB7UT2,"There are a number of really good aspects about this series, which other reviewers have mentioned.  I am very intrigued about the setting -- post World War II in Copenhagen and we are seeing the grittier side of the city.  In a time of deprivation of many consumer goods, the blackmarket is thriving under the leadership of a ruthless gangland boss.  The crime lord has influence even to the higher level of Danish society.  A young, ""hungry"" and arrogant reporter is determined to expose the corruption and he is willing to proceed regardless of what the impact of his investigation means; regardless of who gets hurt.  The plot is intricate and the suspense builds to a crescendo but the problems I had with this series undermined the overall power of it.  First of all -- the cliched homage to detective noir. right down to the cheesy background music to indicate when the audience ought to feel suspense.  The whole atmosphere is shrouded in cigarette smoke and fedoras. Okay, I can get past that, but I cannot get past the lack of connection I had with any of the main characters.  What a nasty lot they are -- just about everyone of them (save the protagonist's long-suffering mother) .It was hard to work up any sympathy for the characters or much interest in what might happen to them. .  After awhile, we just kept watching to see if our protagonist's hubris finally resulted in his comeuppance.  For this reason, primarily, I have to deduct a star.",1475020800,,1458,4.682352941176471
8643577,5,B00INB7UT2,"We love this series for many reasons, but I would single out the wonderfully robust characters, that we have come to expect from scandanavian drama, and also the superb production values (the filming is really beautiful).

8643579,4,B00INB7UT2,"Post War Europe and the rationing is still in full swing. It is 1942 and in Copenhagen a young and very keen journalist - Bjarne Madsen  wants to be a crime reporter. So he starts to follow up on leads that will help him expose the men behind the black market racketeering.

His sub editor is not only a lady but she also has the hots for him, so we get a bit of the love interest. We also have the shadow of collusion for anyone suspected of collaborating with the Nazis. We have some smoky Jazz clubs, some violent thuggery, corruption aplenty and Nazi Gold to all throw into the mix.

This was made for TV and its a pretty god effort for all that. The period detail is mostly bang on with only the odd hic cough  which to be fair does not detract from the overall quality. It knows when to be atmospheric and to keep the tempo high enough to stop you losing interest. Quite the opposite in fact for as soon as one episode was over I was fast forwarding to the next. There are six episodes in all and I watched in two sittings. This is a little noir I find easy to recommend",1448755200,,1076,4.109523809523809

8643581,4,B00INB7UT2,"I watched this series on MhzW and fell in love with this Danish period piece centered around a reporter.

8643585,5,B00INB7UT2,"This an exciting and very good story, that takes place in the immediate period after World War II in Denmark. It's a story of a brave journalist, willing to take great risks to expose crimes, including black market, crime bosses and the immediate aftermath of the resistance against Nazi occupation. The writing and story line are fascinating and as always Jakob Cedergren gives a great performance, but the other actors are also quite good. As far as I know such a story is quite unique, in other words, I don't know of any other movie/TV that covers this period in Europe.
Highly recommended.",1422662400,,594,4.776699029126213
