8726202,4,B012HSX38I,"I have to admit that I started out not liking this film at all and almost quit it.  But there was something charming - and real - about it that kept me hooked.  So glad I stayed with it as there are several aspects that I'm still smiling about as I just finished viewing.  Wish I'd been able to see the credits first as it's an entire family producing, acting in, and having written this film.  The little girls are terrific. (and yes, Ms. Press, you were entertaining as well).  Very touching undercurrent is foreshadowed right from the beginning and sneaked up on me as a huge surprise and one that explains a lot about the characters.  Very interesting treatment of reality.  The film is less than perfect, just like life, but oh-so-charming.",1450742400,,745,4.556390977443609

8726204,5,B012HSX38I,"This is a sophisticated, tender,very funny movie that touches your funny bone and your heart  Unlike most movies these days, the plot and characaters develop over the length of the movie, leaving the audience feeling as if they will be going home with a deeper compassion for and appreciation of all of the quirky and fascinating people we may see in our lives.  AND - it is very funny!!  A not-to-miss movie.",1443225600,,409,4.652777777777778
