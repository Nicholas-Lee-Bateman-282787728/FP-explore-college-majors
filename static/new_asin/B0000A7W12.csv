7996352,5,B0000A7W12,"It took my daughter and I a couple weeks to understand what my 2 year old granddaughter continually requested.  She implored us to get or turn on the roast beef show ... turns out she meant Ferocious Beast ... We have tried to collect all of them.  Now the 7 year old and 2 year are arguing over which one to watch first.  They love them.  The beast is gentle, Maggie is cute, the stories have lessons; a good, fun time with a lovely story each time.  I highly recommend especially if you have child or grandchild afraid of monsters or unseen scary things.  Lilli has been terrified about monsters.  Now she says they're not really scary. She knows they're like Maggie and the ""roast beef"" and she's not frightened anymore.  : )",1214870400,,728,4.421052631578948
