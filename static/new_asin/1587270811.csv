200352,2,1587270811,This was the most boring 90 minutes I have ever spent watching a movie. This movie is a vehicle for John Saxon to show every bulge and cranny on his body with this incredibly tight body suit. Even the part where the women are rubbing Saxon's chest you can fully see his woody growing on camera. What a loser this film is.,1285891200,5,321,4.193548387096774
200353,3,1587270811,"I'm all for this option for obscure movies/TV that wouldn't get a chance on DVD if they had to be mass produced HOWEVER the studios (and Amazon) need to get their pricing in line with what they're offering. Most of these offers (at present) have a limited audience (lots of B movie stuff) while price gouging the few people looking for this movie will work in the short term, why not create loyal followers that will buy again and again by offering these on demand movies/TV at better pricing. ($14.99 seems fair)

As for the movies themselves, both the original and prequel movie (Genesis 2, Planet Earth) are the height of sci-fi hokum from back in the 70's. I used to watch these movies every time they would broadcast. They star many reoccurring TV character actors of the time like John Saxon, Alex Cord, etc. Roddenberry movies always had more of a cerebreal theme which was good given the state of special effects back then. (check out The Questor Tapes if you want to see Data's (from ST: Next Gen) grandpa. It's a good one.",1278633600,52,1032,4.578378378378378

200356,4,1587270811,"Just picked up a copy of Genesis II (1973) and Planet Earth (1974).
I just finished watching both Genesis II and Planet Earth, and was pretty happy with Warner Brothers efforts.

They were both a manufactured on demand product using DVD-R recordable media. Warner made some effort with DVD disk art, and cover art, they could have picked a little better picture for the cover however for Genesis II.
I am glad to finally have a copy of these made for TV movies, that are DVD quality. There were a few specks on the picture, but not enough to take away from the movie.

I only gave it a 4 but they are probably closer to 4.5, just because I think they could have done everything just a little better.

Hopefully they will release the 3rd movie Strange New Earth (1975)

P.S. If you aren't into the older movies, you probably won't like them. These are 70's made for TV movies, so the special effects are somewhat lacking by today's standards.",1262390400,25,941,4.485380116959064

This is an extreme rendition of the prevailing notions of where the future was headed in 1974.  And we can all be glad it didn't work out this way... though drugging men and using them as breeders is always a tempting programme.

It is too bad these vintage shows are not available!  They are GREAT for high school history classes and GREAT for educational discussions on cultural fads in general.  Plus the costumes are hilarious -- bright greens and reds that you just don't see on TV anymore!

Come on ... Networks! How hard can it be to put Planet Earth, Genesis II, etc on one DVD and call it educational?  Bring these back to life for the 40-somethings in the world and their kids who wonder why the heck their parents are so bizarre!

BTW.... if you want a print version of the same mentality... I'd recommend Sheri Tepper's A Gate To Women's Country.",1167782400,44,969,4.5606936416184976

200388,4,1587270811,"Semi-sequel cum remake of Roddenberry's previous post-apoc TV series pilot ""Genesis II"" ...only this time we get studly John (Enter The Dragon) Saxon in place of the less-imposing and more moodily introspective Alex (AIRWOLF) Cord, as lead character Dylan Hunt. In fact, all of the main actors from the first attempt have either been replaced in this 2nd pilot or the character was re-tooled or dropped - with the exception of giant Indian go-to pal, Isiah, once again played by sky-scraping Ted Cassidy.  Lynne Marta, who played Harper-Smyth in G:II, is replaced with Janet Margolin, who is an almost unnoticeable swap as far as acting skills and screen presence. (No offense, Mrs. Margolin!) The outfits are more in keeping with Trek's Federation/military mentality and the stun dart guns keep the proclaimed peace lovers of future city PAX on the pacifist side.

Story this time around is far more in-line with a typical Star Trek:TOS episode. They've even thrown in a Spock-fused-with-Dr. McCoy wanna-be character who's a doctor, but also an empath with an almost alien stand-offish personality. Harper-Smyth is a stand-in for Chekov / Sulu and the PAX subterranean shuttle doubles as the go anywhere replacement for the USS Enterprise.  These are not necessarily bad things, but it makes for a pretty thin veil. The show is entertaining old school fun, but the ""been there, done that"" aspect makes it easy to see why this never went to series. The women's lib run amok angle is amusing and there are some decent fights (Kregs are the obvious Klingon clones) and babes & catfights for the guys to gawk at. You could do better but you could do worse. They tried one last time with this modern man in a dystopian future world concept before abandoning it when ""Strange New World"" hit the small screen the following year, (with Saxon again as the lead, but as a totally different character). PLANET EARTH is an MOD (manufactured-on-demand) affair, so those with older players are heretofor warned that Warner Archives DVD-r format may not work well on some finicky players or ones needing a firmware update. Should pose no problem to new DVD players and most all Blu-ray systems, but YMMV. Buyer beware. PLANET EARTH is fun, quick, lightweight escapism from Star Trek's daddy and rates a respectable 4 STARS from this sci-fi genre junky. ;-)",1427673600,,2342,4.9541984732824424

As is so often the case when taking a trip down memory lane, my opinion as an adult was less kind than during my teenage years.  While considerably better than ""Genesis II"" (the pilot that preceded this one) in both story line, dialogue, and production values, Gene Roddenberry was simply unable to duplicate the success he achieved in Star Trek with this pilot.  It had possibilities, I suppose, but the pilot never convinced a network to take a chance.  I can see why.  It had a tendency to try to bring home a moral instead of concentrate on characterization .  Unless you are a dedicated fan and simply must have everything Gene Roddenberry touched, I would think twice before purchasing this movie -- at least at the current price.",1426550400,,833,4.594594594594595

Too bad the story (the case calls it a sequel to Genesis II, it's notit's a complete rewrite) doesn't match the disc quality. On viewing it I remembered some details from the original broadcast but found this to be a weak example of Roddenberry's TV work. This time Dylan Hunt's story (revived from a 1979 suspended animation accident it's now 2133, the train system built in 1992) has him already settled into the new world as a member of PAX. This time around the mutants are uglier and lower tech, more warlike. A PAX leader is critically injured escaping from them, Dylan and his team must go into a female dominated society to rescue the only doctor capable of saving him.
 Most of the rest of the story is pretty badly handled (the women learn the error of their ways, the- briefly appearing- Kreeg are quickly defeated thanks to Dylan).
I don't think this would have survived as a series yet the studio tried 3 times; Genesis II, Planet Earth and Strange New World (that one without Roddenberry) to get it going!",1421971200,3,1250,4.681818181818182

200416,4,1587270811,"A decent sci-fi romp about a possible Amazonian culture in post-Apocalytpic America.  This second take rebuffs the claim that Roddenberry's previous sci-fi outing, Star Trek, was the only show to have a second pilot requested of it.

Planet Earth, and it's predecessor ""Genesis 2"", told the tale of a world after great social cataclysm, and how a former US Serviceman, with a lot of help from a central good society, goes about knitting frayed or over turned cultures  gone awry.  It was, in a sense, meant to be a kind of travelling policeman/therapist who visits homesteads that have malfunctioning social structures and norms.  It might have been a good show.  I would have watched it because it was compelling.

But, both premiers never caught on because people were tired of social messages being shoved in their faces that didn't deal with family.  Ergo Planet Earth fell in with all the other would-be TV series that had their moment in the sun when aired.

This particular film is respectable, though the knowing viewer who lives in the LA area will recognize the campus on which much of the film was made.  Oh well.

200425,2,1587270811,"I picked this one up because it was a favorite from my childhood. Funny I always referred to this movie as a ""bad Star Trek episode"" never noticing Gene Roddenberry wrote it! But I was disappointed in my copy hissy poor sound starts about halfway through right to the end. Not sure if that's just my copy or all copies?? The movie is a lot of B-movie fun and worth it if you loved those old Saturday afternoon sci-fi movies from the seventies. But I'm finding these Warner Brother computer burns expensive and if you have the technology to burn your own copy from an excellent shape VHS go for it. Pretty much the same quality. These computer burns should be way cheaper. Why are we paying $20.00 for a computer burn?",1364688000,,717,4.4393939393939394
200426,5,1587270811,I am going back in time to my teenager years. Back before I hurt every morning and didn't have to worry about bills. By the way the movie is good too. I wish they had made a series of it.,1362355200,3,187,3.7
200427,4,1587270811,"Very good much, this is 2 of 4 attempts by Roddenberry to take similar material change it, and create a series, it didn't take until much later with the series Andromeda. This story is fun, and it is clearly a product of the 70's and is a very interesting response to ""women's lib."" John Saxon is great as always,",1357430400,,313,4.322033898305085
200428,5,1587270811,"Before I get to my review I would like to thank Warner Archives for releasing several of my favorite old movies (many of which I watched on Sammy Terry's Nightmare Theatre or Thriller Theater in Indy); four of Vincent Price's lesser-known titles (The Story of Mankind, The Bribe, The Big Circus and While the City Sleeps), the extended Japanese version of The Last Dinosaur (yes, it's in English), the classic TV-movie Bad Ronald, Kristy McNichol's only horror film (Dream Lover), the cheese fest of The Green Slime and Legends of the Superheroes (sort of a reunion for Adam West and Burt Ward as Batman and Robin with all kinds of DC heroes and villains) and, of course, all four of Gene Roddenberry's cult films (Pretty Maids All In a Row, Genesis II, Planet Earth and Strange New World). Yes, they are DVD-on-Demand with no extras, which annoys some people, but they are also the official studio releases of many movies that introduced me to the realm that Forrest J. Ackerman (Famous Monsters of Filmland) called Imagi-Movies. Thanx, Warner. Now, how about releasing the Batman TV series as well as the Batgirl pilot?

'kay, on to Planet Earth:

I saw this with my dad one lazy Saturday afternoon and never forgot it (Pop informed me that the man who made Stra Trek also made Planet Earth, and Captain Kirk lives in John Saxon here; yeah, it reminds me of Mad Max (predates Max by five years, actually) and had the usual TV formula, but John Saxon never looked tougher, more confident and cooler than he did here as Dylan Hunt (remaking Genesis II, sort of); the uniforms worked this time, the plot works better, the female crew member was cuter (I loves me them Tomboys!) and Ted Cassidy was never as memorable or more agile (a lot more to do than just answer the door for Gomez or Morticia). A world where women rule? Say it ain't so! Not that much science fictiony since women with brains have ruled us fairer sex for centuries (let the man believe it was his idea and you own him). A fun little TV pilot that I'm glad was never made into an on-going series and ruined it; the networks never grasp sci-fi or horror and are always throwing them under the bus (Star Trek, Batman, Night Gallery, Kolchak the Night Stalker, Planet of the Apes, Logan's Run, Battlestar Galactica, Buck Rogers, V, Wonder Woman and Ark II come to mind). Saxon appeared a year later in Gene Roddenberry's third and final attempt at a post-apocalypse TV series, Strange New World, and then starred in Roger Corman's classic Battle Beyond the Stars, Dynasty and Wes Craven's uber hit A Nightmare on Elm Street and two of its sequels (Dream Warriors and A new Nightmare); Saxon was a very dynamic action actor whose career evaporated too soon, but I always enjoy seeing him pop up from time to time.

Planet Earth is one of my all-time favs from that bygone era where Uncle Forry, Topps trading cards, comic books and Star Wars fired up this former child's synapses into believing in the fantastic and the impossible.",1351036800,19,2996,4.649056603773585
200429,4,1587270811,"I won't talk about who, what , when and where that has been done by others enough.
I will say my copy has a back ground noise through out the program.  Kind of like if one was watching TV and the channel is not coming in well.  The video was quite good however.
The noise will not keep me from watching the DVD again (it is not very loud ) but I wish it wasn't there.
Please let me know if you have a clean copy without the noise.  I am curious if there are any or if this noise is on all copies.
Update 5-26-12 :
The first time I watched this I used head phones.  The second time I watched it I listened to it through the surround system.  The back ground noise was much less noticeable through the surround though the person watching it with me noticed it at one point and commented on it.  The noise seemed to come and go and after a while we forgot all about it.",1337040000,2,866,3.9482758620689653
200430,1,1587270811,"This, like the others listed (Planet Earth, Genesis II, and Strange New World), are absolutely terrible! Not only are they dated, but the stories... being from Gene Roddenberry and all... reek of Star Trek remakes. These should have been left in the past, along with my 'better' memories of them! I loved these as a kid, along with everyone else missing Star Trek.... And, perhaps,that's the thing.... Some things are better ""remembered"" than owned. Our memories tend to be romanticized of Post Apocolyptic (world) times, where woman would just love to dominate us men! But, again, these movies are best when watched on Turner Classic Movies (where you can request movies now), or watch via Amazon instant video first. Perhaps, Amazon will allow one to watch such movies on Instant Video (if enough people inquire about this), and THEN, if one want's to buy the movie, they will deduct the ""instant video"" price paid from one's order? Then one could take the chance on a movie like these. Otherwise, skip it! And believe me when I tell you, that I am a couch potato from way back... I have every single movie and television series... Night Stalker, Planet of the Apes (TV series), Space 1999, Star Trek, and others (Outer Limits, Twilight Zone), every single video you can imagine.... But again, these are just terrible!

The video and audio (despite being DVD -R on demand; which will only play in newer DVD players), were alright. I was pleasantly surprised to discover. Otherwise, these are not movies which have stood the test of time well (too dated and not worth watching with kids today of course), despite the story lines; which given again... they are Gene Roddenberry's are not worth the money. The price was WAY beyond what these disc were worth. I guess they had to make sure to get it while they could, before the negative reviews poured in. I agree wholeheartedly with other reviewers about those other negative aspects as well. Just wanted to add my own opinion to the pile. Should YOU decide to waste your money--the memory of the story is just too good to pass up--please add your own review (I'm interested to see just how many persons ""remember"" these stories as better than this)!",1333152000,3,2200,4.7894736842105265
200431,4,1587270811,This dvd was just as described and arrived well before the shipping estimate and plays great. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because the dvd case was so 'bowed' that it really wouldn't close so I had to get a generic case to keep the dvd in. That's the only issue I had with this dvd.  Would shop with seller again.,1328745600,,325,4.078125

200434,5,1587270811,"I remember this movie from long, long ago and loved it then.  I was very happy to see it was finally released on DVD, and wished that this pilot could have been picked up as a weekly series, which it sadly was not. (I heard it was beaten out by the series ""Planet of the Apes"" on ABC, which tanked after about six episodes. If only they would have taken on ""Planet Earth"" instead...sigh)
I had seen an earlier movie by Gene Roddenberry called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Genesis-II/dp/B002VA5A02/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Genesis II</a>&nbsp;that used many of the same characters, though not with all the same actors, and I much preferred ""Planet Earth"" to ""Genesis II,"" which I thought came on a little too heavy-handed and preachy.  ""Planet Earth"" was a lot more fun to watch, the plot being cerebral enough to be taken seriously and yet action-driven at the same time. ""Planet Earth"" painted a more hopeful view of our possible future than ""Genesis II,"" and in the midst of all the doom and gloom of the daily news (now as well as then back in my youth) the movie provides a bit of pleasant escapism for about 90 minutes or so.
My favorite character? I absolutely loved Isiah, the gentle giant played by actor Ted Cassidy--well, gentle enough but still able to swing a few good punches in the name of protecting others, too. (Interestingly, Ted Cassidy's portrayal of Isiah is one of the roles that transfered over from Genesis II.  Other characters that were used in the second movie were portrayed by different people.) I would have thoroughly enjoyed a series from this movie if for no other reason than to see the character of Isiah grow and develop.
This is a good addition to anyone's collection who loved Gene Roddenberry's work in particular or science fiction in general.",1311465600,6,1831,4.977124183006536
200435,3,1587270811,"It was OK but knowing that Roddenberry was the creator of this non-starter series I was hoping for more. All about an exploration team in a post-apocalyptic future and a mission to a matriarchial society, Planet Earth has the feel of a sci-fi series episode or a made-for-TV movie. With time it might have developed better character development and a more coherent plot line. Still, it's good for what it is.",1308441600,,408,4.76056338028169
