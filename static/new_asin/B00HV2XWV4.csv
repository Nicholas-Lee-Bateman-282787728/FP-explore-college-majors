8636242,1,B00HV2XWV4,"Have a hard time believing that any true fan of the books could enjoy this.  Worst. Writing. Ever.  Characters using constant modern slang seriously undermines important plot points, making everything endlessly childish.  Yes...yes, I suppose small children would find this show entertaining - it does have lots of bangs and shiny whistles.  First half of series followed Book plotting closely, but things started to get really off later on, to the point where you could hardly recognize this was Deltora Quest.  Let me tell the writers something: you CANNOT draw out a climax to 4-5 episodes and expect to not lose any ""pull.""  I had to leave the room while it was playing, just to find ways of getting through it - went and made a sandwich (ham and cheese, no mayo).  And don't even get me started on the Sorceress Thaegan escapade - THAT not even a small child would find believable.

Positives: some decent music, voice-talent fit characters.",1521331200,,946,4.86875

8636248,3,B00HV2XWV4,"I liked the anime okay, but to be honest prefer the books more. The anime did have a few differences than the books, but overall was decent.",1424476800,4,140,4.222222222222222
8636249,2,B00HV2XWV4,"This set contains the complete Deltora Quest anime as it aired on The Hub network.  If you just want to watch this show in English, then it should be fine for you. However, if you were excited by Amazon's product detail section, where it lists the Japanese language track and English subtitles in addition to the English dub, then you will be sorely disappointed. This set contains only the English dub. And while it's not a completely horrible dub, it's not particularly great either. My husband, who normally prefers dubs, spurns this one.

The packaging itself does not list any languages, so I had to open it to confirm that the Japanese language track was, in fact, missing. Amazon will only issue a 50% refund for opened DVDs, even when the product is not as described on their website, so beware.

Another potential note of interest to buyers. The aspect ratio of the set is 4:3. Not crazy, since I think that was the only way that it aired in English, but just mentioning it for those who were wondering whether it contained the widescreen version that aired in Japan.",1401408000,26,1076,4.652631578947369
8636250,5,B00HV2XWV4,"This was a great DVD Set that was SO complete. I had missed a lot in this series when I watched it in the past, so this set has it all covering 19 hours of material. The episodes were entertaining, interactive and fun and bring some great anime to life. Now that I have watched these I am interested to see if we can find the book series as well, as I liked the characters and the action throughout. If you are a fan of anime, they did a great job bringing this to life. I encourage you to try out this series for yourself, as you will find that you will fly through the series and enjoy every minute of it!
