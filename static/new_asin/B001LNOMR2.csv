I appreciate this are often the only source for some obscure titles and was simply grateful to see them. However this particular release of Make Your Bets Ladies is of such poor quality I feel I should warn others. It is so dark as to render much of the nighttime/indoor action indistinct, and in brightly lit scenes the contrast renders the figures as silhouettes - like a shadow play. Moreover throughout there is such an accumulation of fuzz/crud on the right hand side of the frame I had to resist the urge to attack my screen with a hedge trimmer. So I give the picture quality the lowest rating. Such a shame as it sounded like another fun Eddie Constantine movie.",1495411200,,858,4.726666666666667

  moves where posssibly instead of beeing looking out for saving money.
  As Lemmy Caution he was more for me than james bond today, the movies with Eddie Constantine gives me a wonderful feeling
  and I can after look at his movie in good humour for days and days forward",1318118400,,389,4.408450704225352
