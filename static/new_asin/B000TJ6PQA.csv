2901457,4,B000TJ6PQA,"A bumper flick! Took me utterly by surprise, especially as I have next to no affection for the sea or surfing. Russell Crowe narrates a short history, since settlement, of the bay where entrenched working class aspirations have been enacted for the most part of the last century. Crowe's authorial voice is no coincidence as several Bra Boys play for his football club, The Rabbitos. He confers the right tone of tough, resigned affection for his subject. The pacing and editing of the film is perfect; archival footage, home doco, mugs shots of the main players in a blackened studio, and some of the most impressive surfing footage I've seen. Never have I been so convinced of the powerful attraction of the wave. It's a character in its own right, brilliantly elucidated by the Bra Boys. Their story, and one realises that many if not most of the 200 or so members have similar tales, drives the film. It's a story of survival through brotherhood whose power in unity withstands poverty and oppression ftrom all comers. The film doesn't shirk any of the tough guy stuff that has been the usual, one-dimensional perception of the gang. And there is almost a total absence of feminity. Yet the essential goodness and humanity of the lead actors(playing themselves) is very heartening and will open understanding to a much maligned sub-culture of Australian life.",1211414400,,1363,4.904761904761905
2901468,5,B000TJ6PQA,"I bought this film in Bali thinking it would be purely entertaining and pretty bad as a documentary. It's pretty rare that surf documentaries also have good stories and frankly, I just wanted to see surf footage of ""Ours"", the insanely dangerous, hollow reef break in Sydney that the Bra Boys were the first to surf. Turns out, it's a great film and not because of the surf footage (although that's awesome too). The film follows the three Abberton brothers (one of them, Koby Aberton, a top-ranked big-wave surfer) growing up in a rough eastern suburb in Sydney that happens to also be on a killer surf break. (The area has since been gentrified, but 20 years ago it was legitimately poor and working class.) With a strung out mom and no dad, the Aberton brothers turned to the beach and their friends for guidance, forming a tight-knit surf gang called the Bra Boys. The Bra Boys are a scrappy bunch who are constantly at war with the surfers from neighboring breaks and generally getting into mischief, but in the end, surfing and the pride they have for their neighborhood help them rise above and basically become good guys who want to help the youth and their community. Since the film was made by the Aberton brothers themselves, you can't help but think it's sort of an attempt to clear any trash talking about them (the Bra Boys gang has been caught up in all sorts of criminal activity) but that doesn't make the film any less entertaining. It's also an insightful look into why surfing is so territorial. I really, really enjoyed this film. Oh, and you also get to see these guys surf ""The Cyclops"", probably the most dangerous wave on the planet. It's sick.

2901471,3,B000TJ6PQA,"Just a little ways east of Sydney lies a place called Marouba Beach, home to the Bra Boys, a band of hooligan surfers founded by the Abberton Brothers in the 1990s, now made famous courtesy of a documentary entitled ""Bra Boys: Blood is Thicker Than Water."" When they're not out hanging ten or catching a monster wave, the boys are busy duking it out with rival gangs and even the local police.

The film, directed by Sunny Abberton himself, makes for reasonably interesting viewing, though one wonders whether the material itself truly merits a full-length documentary. It starts off painting the gang as a bunch of out-of-control hellions, then spends the rest of the time making the case that they are really just poor, misunderstood fellows at their core. The movie does a fairly convincing job in that respect - not surprising given the director's close personal ties to the subject - but the real stars of the film are the beautifully photographed curls the boys tackle in between bouts of anti-social behavior and revisionist self-reflection.",1257552000,,1048,4.954545454545454
2901472,4,B000TJ6PQA,"This was better than I thought it would be.. Not allot of surfing but the few they have are pretty insane.
 Good documentary over all tho",1244678400,,137,4.269230769230769
2901473,2,B000TJ6PQA,"Although the surfing and localism is quite incredible, the long pleas for trying to justify the Aussie ""thug life"" that these guys lived goes a bit overboard and actually bores the audience. A little further editing could have cut at least 30 min off this movie and had the same effect, without the boring narrations and interviews. Sometimes ignorance just can't be justified.
Coverage of the ""murder in self defense"" is the most interesting part of the film. Worth a watch, but I would doubt that this is a film most could watch twice.",1228521600,3,537,4.723404255319149
2901474,5,B000TJ6PQA,"My husband really enjoys to watch it, over and over with his friends. Good movie, I liked it too, there is an interesting story, not just surf shots",1224979200,,148,4.321428571428571
2901475,5,B000TJ6PQA,Very heavy. A great story of a group of kids from the other side of the track. A must have for all true surfers.,1222128000,,112,3.7083333333333335
2901476,4,B000TJ6PQA,"Whether you're into the surf culture or not, this is a compelling documentary. Russell Crowe was a good choice to narrate.",1221523200,,122,4.857142857142857
2901477,4,B000TJ6PQA,"Interesting documentary about the surf ""gang"" in Australia.  Gives some history on how they became who they are.  Just keep in mind that you are getting a documentary and NOT a ""surf flick"".

Theres definately some nice footage and a great segment on the place called ""ours"".

Don't expect to watch this and get amped to paddle out.  You're more likely to learn how to respect locals when you paddle out someplace new.",1220313600,4,418,4.671232876712328

8209596,5,B000TJ6PQA,"Gripping and compelling story of disadvantaged youth that overcame tremendous odds against them.  Especially loved the Grandmother and the obvious love and respect shown her.  Beautiful and awesome surfing shots.  One doesn't have to be a surfer or a surfing buff to enjoy and identify with this story.  As a HUGE fan of Russell Crowe, I applaud his involvement with this project as the narrator.  Thank you.",1467676800,,408,5.029850746268656

8209600,3,B000TJ6PQA,"Moderately entertaining with nice surf footage. I can imagine that if I were Australian or previously familiar with material I would have found the film more engaging. It felt like the filmmakers assumed the viewer knew the outcome of suspenseful situations to start. Also, for reasons I don't understand, the video image appeared to be low quality on our screen, as if pixelated or fuzzy. As compared with other of my favorite sports docs, like those on ESPN 30x30 or HBO Real Sports, this falls below the grade.",1386979200,,513,4.840909090909091
8209601,4,B000TJ6PQA,"Beautiful landscapes of country Australia, beaches, oceans, some surfing and ganging-round-the-waves. Perhaps, it is a bit healthier than biker-stories of engine-exhausts snoring riders.",1374537600,,186,7.130434782608695
8209602,4,B000TJ6PQA,"If you are in anyway aquatic, you need to see this production. I grew up near the beach in Santa Monica, CA. I was immersed in the beach scene from 9 years of age to 16 years. I'll tell you this, it was nothing like the world depicted in the Bra Boys DVD. Since the hard core experiences shown aren't for everybody, I gave the DVD 4 stars. Apart from that, I felt that Sunny Abberton did a great job of sharing the world that he and his brothers grew up in. I've always felt that one of the best things anyone can do is to see the world through someone else's eyes. The Bra Boys production makes this possible. The great thing about seeing it on the screen was that I wasn't in danger of being stabbed, shot, or washed over the shallow reef! Some of the elements expressed in this film include deep family ties, the bond of friendship, larrakin characters, oh... and some unbelievable surfing!",1360108800,2,893,4.321428571428571
8209603,5,B000TJ6PQA,"Brutally true story of life in the bad section of town that just happens to also host a really fine surf spot. The fights & gang violence are bloody. The surfing insane. You travel to some awesome surf spots & see some really incredible surfing. Great, tragic story that turns out well with plenty of fines waves through out.",1356393600,,325,4.52542372881356
