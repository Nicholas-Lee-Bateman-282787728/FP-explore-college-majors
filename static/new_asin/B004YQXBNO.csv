8448745,4,B004YQXBNO,"I bought a similar video a couple years ago titled Home for the Holidays, and it sucked. This set has 3 hour-long DVD's that will play on a continuous loop. There are 6 audio tracks to choose from, most of them instrumental, so you should be able to find one to suit your taste.  It has footage of sleigh rides, a decorated mansion with garlands and poinsettias decorating a marble staircase, There are decorated Christmas trees, a kitchen filled with holiday treats, and that is just on one DVD alone. It is expertly shot, and well edited. It isn't something to sit down and watch, but if your guests get bored or have no one to talk to, it is at least a nice distraction that will help lift their holiday spirits. We used to put on Christmas movies, but we found them distracting, and those who were talking had to talk louder over the movie, and those watching the movie were unable to hear because the chatterboxes behind them wouldn't shut up, and this is their most favorite version of Charles Dicken's A Christmas Carol. So this is a perfect alternative. It is exactly what I was hoping to find. it is full of beautiful scenes, no narration, no plot, just music and video. I think it's great! And the price wasn't too bad either. We still haven't watched the 3rd DVD yet. We've only had it on during 2 Christmas parties this year, and while we were decorating. Great for background noise while you are setting up your tree too and hanging your own garlands and wreaths by the way. Once again, my wife and I would get distracted watching Elf and end up taking a break so we could watch a dwarf beat up Will Farrell for calling him an elf. We don't have that problem anymore. We were able to get through the entire process in a day. Thanks Seasons Greetings!",1388275200,,1763,4.424615384615384
