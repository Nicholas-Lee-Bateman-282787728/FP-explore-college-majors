7295012,5,B00ZUL9LGS,"I have not seen this, but my daughter tells me my 4-year-old granddaughter loved it.  That's good enough for me.  One day when he's a little older her brother will probably love it too.",1441497600,,185,4.411764705882353
7295013,5,B00ZUL9LGS,"Another great paw patrol dvd that the kids love! The 7 episodes are cute and of course my son was thrilled in the first episode the new pup that their big truck the paw patroller was in the episode. Although being titled ""Meet Everest"" it was kinda disappointing that Everest is only in the first three episodes -
The new pup, pups and the big freeze, and pups save the deer.
The last four episodes are
Pups make a splash, pups save a school day, pups and the trouble with turtles, and pups save a flying frog.
Overall a great DVD for the price and the kids just can't seem to get enough of paw patrol!",1441152000,10,602,4.198275862068965

This was not a full movie, it is a collection of 7 short movies involving Eversest. I originally thought is was an hour and half long show introducing Everest but it's still cute! They have a show of how she joins the paw patrol it's just a short one and then they have 6 other shows using her paw patrol skills =)

Super cute and would recommend to anyone!!",1472688000,,616,4.256410256410256

7295109,5,B00ZUL9LGS,We are big Paw Patrol vans.i have a almost 1 year old and an almost 2 year old. So trust me if this DVD was not perfect I would be one unhappy mama. It arrived within the allotted 2 day estimate. It was in brand new condition still wrapped. People have to be careful buying DVDs online because sometimes they will say they are new but then when you receive them they will have been repackaged. However I assure you the disc was scratch-free as good as new. I would definitely recommend buying this for anybody who has children under 5. We honestly have been watching it on repeat for the past 5 days. This is especially one of my favorite of all of the Paw Patrol collection. It has quite a bit of episodes in it so it's definitely not a waste of money. Thanks for such an amazing DVD.,1469664000,3,785,4.2052980132450335

7295129,5,B00ZUL9LGS,My three year old daughter absolutely loves this show!!! This is a great set of episodes in one so that she's not having to watch the same episode over and over. We love the addition of another girl pup too!,1462492800,,207,4.2
7295130,5,B00ZUL9LGS,My son loves this and it was at a great price. Ill definitely be ordering more,1462233600,,78,3.9375
7295131,5,B00ZUL9LGS,"I got this as a gift for my 2 yr old granddaughter and of course it didn't disappoint! She has spent hours watching the seven different episodes.  Paw Patrol is one of those videos I don't mine her watching because its fun and educational, it keeps her interested and she doesn't even know shes learning.

Although it was intended for the 2 yr old, my now 3 month old granddaughter is already watching! She obviously doesn't know what it is but the bright colors and cheerful voices is enough to engage her long enough for mom, and grammie, to get a break.

I would recommend Paw Patrol to any parent or grand parent looking for something safe and educational for their kids to watch!",1461456000,,684,4.5

7295189,4,B00ZUL9LGS,"My son loves this DVD above all others.  As a mom, I appreciate of the addition of a second female character.  To my son, it doesn't matter and loves the girl pups just as much as the boy pups.  He just loves the idea of snow and the snowmobile.

This DVD revolves around Everest, the newest pup in the Paw Patrol series.  Everest is essentially a husky or husky-like dog and has a snowmobile to get around in the snow.  Hence the name, Everest!  There are 4 cartoons with 2 separate episodes each that involve Everest, Paw Patrol, and snow in some capacity.  The first of the cartoons introduces Everest and eventually towards the end, she is invited to join the Paw Patrol.

If you are not familiar with Paw Patrol, then this is not the DVD to start with because it assumes you have a working knowledge of the Paw Patrol characters and world.  If you a part of Adventure Bay full throttle, then this is a good DVD to add to your collection.  I just wish there more to the collection because my son watches them so much he's started to recite the words back to the TV!  The DVD does allow for individual episode play or for the entire DVD to play at once.

Other than that, it's self-explanatory!  It's a DVD with Paw Patrol episodes featuring the newest to the gang, Everest!",1451347200,3,1277,4.3559322033898304

7295233,5,B00ZUL9LGS,"Bought for my 4-yr-old Paw Patrol fanatic grandson.  Did he like it?  Well, according to him I am now the coolest, most awesome and loved Noni on the face of the earth--so yes, I'm guessing he liked it! :)  He even has his 7-month-old baby brother watching it with him now - or at least acting like he is.  I mean, come on - 7 months??!  But have you ever watched this show?  It's just about as adorable as it can be.  It is SO ridiculously popular, especially with little boys, that I think it must appeal to their inner sense of wanting to be a HERO because that's pretty much what these little pups do: rescue whoever needs it at the time.  They also laugh and giggle a lot, which I find too cute.  And the show always seems to work in a nice little point of some kind, like the importance of being kind, forgiving, sharing, etc.  It's 8 bucks.  Little kids love it.  You can't go wrong here.",1444780800,2,895,4.169590643274854
