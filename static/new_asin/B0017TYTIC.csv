8267294,1,B0017TYTIC,"Don't buy this book.  This entire Hot Rod Surf pinstriping thing is the biggest joke to the entire hot rodding community.  His lines are terrible, his designs are terrible, and anything he ruins with his ""lines"" is a disgrace.  Plenty of other pinstriping reference material out there.  Do yourself a favor and go find a real artist's work.",1498089600,,340,4.810344827586207
8267295,1,B0017TYTIC,Horrible.  Not what I was looking for.,1473206400,,38,4.428571428571429
8267296,1,B0017TYTIC,"WASTE OF MONEY!!! The only thing this video did was boost my ego! Video bad, music bad, striping bad. The guy sounded monotone and as if he was reading the entire show from a script. This was awful. Lucky for me my husband got this DVD along with a Steve Kafka DVD, there's a guy that knows what he is talking about.",1424304000,2,316,4.112903225806452
8267297,2,B0017TYTIC,very low budget. I would say that there is nothing on this video that you won't get on youtube for free.,1367107200,,104,4.0
8267298,1,B0017TYTIC,"The production quality is horrible.
This guys skill is a pinch better than mine.
There is a scene where he paints a motorcycle gas tank and then pinstripes it; the orange-peal on the tank is unbelievable. Even oranges don't have that much orange peal.
This guy's skills aren't where they need to be to teach others to do this.
The premise of the DVD is odd, I can't recommend the purchase, just a waste of money.",1364860800,,412,4.434210526315789
8267299,4,B0017TYTIC,"I really liked this dvd and learned a lot from it. To me it is a perfect beginners introduction because it goes in a very logical order. It briefly covers the minimum equipment needed to start out and get your feet wet and start striping. Next it covers the basic shapes that need to be practiced. These shapes are a handful of simple patterns that can be put together to create your own style. Mind you these are not advanced techniques, but simple shapes all with the beginner in mind. But with these simple shapes, incredible striping can be done. That is what the rest of the video is about. Showing how Hot Rod Surf uses these to create some awesome striping on a variety of cars, motorcycles, and more.",1327622400,3,708,4.453846153846154
8267300,5,B0017TYTIC,I learned a lot from this DVD. MWM breaks it down with informative basics that really improved my striping. It reminded me of the feeling of Von Dutch's and Ed Roth's freehand pinstriping with a cool do it yourself attitude. Lots of vintage steel and a bitchin soundtrack make this a must have for any pinstriper.,1322611200,2,313,4.607142857142857

8267302,1,B0017TYTIC,"This product was absolutely horrible.  My husband has gotten into pinstriping and so I got him this video to help him lay down better lines. This video was made by an amateur who doesn't even know how to pinstripe.  When me and my husband sat down to watch it we actually just ended up laughing the whole time because we couldn't believe that this guy was serious.  The guy in the video needs some lessons in pinstriping.  He had a shaky hand, did not lay down straight lines, and his lines never connected (a no-no in pinstriping.)Also his designs were never symmetrical. A five year old could have done what he did.  I have never seen anyone use as many dots in their pinstriping as he does. We know a few good pinstripers like Von Hot Rod who would be a much better candidate to learn from. My honest opinion do not buy this video it is a waste of money and won't teach you the correct way to pinstripe.",1315180800,4,906,4.305882352941176
