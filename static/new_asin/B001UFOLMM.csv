8343561,1,B001UFOLMM,"Was very excited when I found this.  Ordered it right away for a Christmas gift .  Ordered on Sat, received it on Mon.,  Problem was It was not what I ordered. Received single CD not the full set.  Amazon was very good about refund, an said I could keep the single CD.  Still very disappointed I did not get complete volume",1356739200,3,323,4.229508196721311
8343562,5,B001UFOLMM,Carol Burnett is great and I'm glad I am able to share some of this great show with my 13 year old. She gets a lot of laughs out it.,1292716800,2,132,3.433333333333333

8343564,3,B001UFOLMM,"I assumed a ""collector's edition"" would be cream of the crop of the shows. It's two whole episodes and I didn't find them particularly funny or special.",1252713600,19,152,4.666666666666667
8343565,5,B001UFOLMM,"A few years ago, I bought this DVD thru Columbia House...and then foolishly gave it away, thinking an official collection bundle might be coming. Boy, was I wrong! I've now re-bought Volume One, and am staunchly holding on to it!
Carol & company hit the perfect pitch on the Dinah Shore show. This, of course, contains the ""holy grail"" of Carol Burnett sketches, ""Went With The Wind"". Of all the movie parodies they did, none can compare with this one. The writing, performing, costuming (who can forget Starlet's dress made from window curtains?)& set design were dead solid perfect in this one. Carol was terrific as usual. Vicki Lawrence was hysterical as the servant Sissy. Tim Conway offered fine comic support in his usual turn as a fumbling twit. Even guest Dinah Shore had her moments in the sketch. But the person who deserved an Emmy was the late, great Harvey Korman who was channeling every little squint & vocal inflection of Clark Gable's so well that it was downright spooky.
Add to this another inspired comic performance from Conway as his ""Old Man"" in a butcher shop sketch, and this volume is a real winner, and no doubt, a genuine T.V. treasure.",1242172800,77,1165,4.74384236453202
