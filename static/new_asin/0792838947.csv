150521,3,0792838947,"Thief has a touch of authenticity, it doesn't really ask you to suspend belief, you really feel there are people as hard boiled as the protagonist, as aimless as his girlfriend/wife, and as corrupt as the cops and members  of the judicial system. Consequently, the film is driven by actors and not  special effects, sure there are a few explosions and gun shots, but they  are not the centrepiece of action as in so many of the current crop of  movies. Further, the photography is smooth and scenes blend, and this is  the art of cinema. I had high hopes for the DVD version, but they were  dashed with a sound track which has been remastered with less than  precision (the mucic score not only sounds off, but drowns out the dialogue  in several scenes) Moreover, I use S cables to connect the video, and I  thought the picture should have been of a higher quality! However, I rented  the disc and it may simply be the one copy at fault, but I think it is more  likely a reproduction problem. If you like cops and robbers this is a  classic. 3 stars reflects the quality of DVD reproduction I experienced.",944697600,6,1106,4.447761194029851
150522,4,0792838947,"This is the first time I have seen the film. And I have to say it has the usual high standards of a Michael Mann film. Even now in the late ninetys it has a powerful on screen pressence. I was most excited by the sheer  brillence in the later part of the movie. If you are a Michael Mann fan,  then this is one film you should not miss.",939427200,,336,3.7857142857142856
150523,5,0792838947,"James Caan is in top form in Michael Mann's Thief. Caan plays a used car dealer Jewewl thief to perfection. Also Look for James Belushi and Willie nelson in a fine cameo. Besides great acting all around the intelligence of  the script and direction is what makes this movie stand head and shoulders  above most crime movies.  Music by tangerine dream, who seem to have done  all the music for the movies in the late 70's early 80's. Great movie. I'd  get the DVD if I had one",921801600,,475,4.3522727272727275
150524,4,0792838947,"James Caan's portrayal of the ex-con jewel thief in this movie is very powerful.  Strikingly breaking life down to one home made collage carried in his wallet!  Great character roles for James Belushi and Willie Nelson,  combined with Tangerine Dream's powerful sound track give this movie even  more depth.  Michael Mann's use of reflection and off center lighting  entwine with the music and actors to yield a great movie.",920505600,,424,5.072463768115942
150525,5,0792838947,"James Caan plays a hardcore master thief who's spent almost his entire adult life behind bars.  When he makes a Faustian bargain with a mobster (Robert Prosky) in order to get out of the life, everything he's worked for  tumbles down around him. This is a MAGNIFICENT movie, full of power, irony,  and ferocious action!  I think it's Caan's greatest role, and that's saying  A LOT!  He brings incredible intensity to his role as a man  who, in order  to save himself, must destroy everything he loves. Not only is this a  fabulous movie, it's my favorite DVD.  The DVD/widescreen format truly does  justice to Director Mann (MIAMI VICE, MANHUNTER, HEAT)'s  quirky,  ultra-slick style.  Also, the commentary by Mann and Caan is EXACTLY what a  DVD commentary track should be:  two great artists commenting on the film  at the same time, playing off of each other and really adding a whole new  dimension to the film (for instance, did you know that the ""technical  advisors"" for the film were a ""crew"" of jewltheives, and  that Caan was breaking into REAL safes with REAL burglary tools?). If you  loved HEAT, you HAVE TO see this movie!  In fact, this is almost a  companion piece to HEAT, because  Caan's character is sort of an earlier  version of DeNiro's character. If you are a fan of films like RESERVOIR  DOGS, HEAT, PULP FICTION, and THE GETAWAY, this is a MUST-SEE!  This is  truly a modern classic!",916876800,39,1408,4.683127572016461
150526,5,0792838947,The great thing about this movie is that the director used REAL ORGANIZED CRIME THIEFS as supporting actors in the film. Watch the movie do a little research about the other actors and BOOM you've got the real story. Plus Dennis Farina in the movie as a bad guy after just taking a leave of absence from the Chicago Police Dept and the house explosion at the end actually destroyed the real house where the stunt was to take place with a false front fire scene.,1511136000,,461,4.372093023255814

150536,5,0792838947,"As fine reviews have stated, this Blu-ray is visually stunning and the sound is superb.

Regarding content, I love the diner scene with Caan and Tuesday Weld. Is this the harbinger of the ""Heat"" coffee scene or what? It's at night with the glistening city lights in the background, you hear the reverberations of the cars on the highway below, and then slowly the synthesizers of Tangerine Dream build as the emotion of the scene reaches its peak:

""Look, I have run out of time [...] So, I'm just asking you to be with me,"" a flawed Caan says, to the fragile yet beautiful Tuesday Weld.

So well-acted, so human, so believable. We saw some precursors to ""Miami Vice"" in this movie too, didn't we? What a memorable film, and there are other remarkable scenes as well. I highly recommend ""Thief"" (1981).

Michael Mann was way ahead of his time.",1494892800,2,843,4.6

150541,5,0792838947,"Belongs with the top 10 best gangster films of all time. Performances by main characters are exceptional. Put it up there with The Godfather I and II, as well as Scarface, The Asphalt Jungle, Goodfellas, No Country For Old Men, Bullitt and a few others.",1486771200,,253,4.644444444444445
150542,5,0792838947,"Thief is probably best known for being director Michael Manns first feature film.  But it was also the big screen debut for a 50 year old actor named Robert Prosky who I guarantee you will recognize if youve watched any TV or seen any movies in the past 40 years.  Digging from his Chicago upbringing, Mann comes up with a gritty, neo noir classic.  Mann who knew both cops and crooks (and uses some in the film) brings the Chicago night time to life with great ambiance, wet streets and neon lights.  And to top it off he features German electronic band Tangerine Dream to great effect.

James Caan, in one of his best performances, plays Frank a career criminal who recently spent 8 years in the slammer.  Along with his right hand man Barry (Jim Belushi), they rob safes.  Usually safes filled with precious stones.  Aside from disabling the alarm system, these guys don't do it with fancy computers or electronic gizmos.  They do it with sledge hammers, specially made acetylene torches and 200 pound pneumatic drills.  After the heist that opens the film (10 minutes dialog free), the jewelry is taken to a fence who ends up mysteriously dead before the payoff.  And of course Franks $180K is gone.

Frank realizes the money is in the hands of a mobster named Leo (Prosky) and is determined to get it back.  He confronts Leo, but Leo wants Frank to work for him.  Frank, a loner, reluctantly agrees but only for one high paying job.  If successful, the theft will put Frank on easy street for a long time.  You just know this won't go well somehow.

A subplot involves Franks courting of a waitress named Jessie (Tuesday Weld).  Hes reluctant to talk about what he does for a living, but Jessie guesses correctly.  The pairing of Weld and Caan is perfect.  Caans aggressiveness is tempered when he talks to Welds character.  We sense the emotional struggle they both feel.  In a great scene in the diner, Frank tells Jessie what life in prison is like.  There is time to create a path once you get out.  It is tender and touching and Jessie is seeing the real Frank.  Willie Nelson plays a prisoner named Okla who coached and taught Frank how to survive in the joint and how to make a living out in the real world.

In addition to some fine acting all around, the city of Chicago and Tangerine Dream are also very real characters and important to the atmospheric dynamic of the film.  It all adds up to one fine crime drama.

This Criterion Blu ray package is also a winner.  It comes with a 1080p video resolution and a 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  Here are some notes from Criterion included with the disc:  ""This new digital transfer was created in 4K resolution on a Northlight film scanner from the 35mm original camera negative. Director Michael Mann's original 35mm answer print was used as a color reference, and Mann supervised and approved the entire transfer. The additional Willie Dixon fisherman scene was taken from a 35mm internegative made from a 35mm print. Thousands of instances of dirt, debris, scratches, splices, and warps were manually removed using MTI's DRS, while Digital Vision's Phoenix was used for small dirt, grain, and noise management, jitter, and flicker.
The original stereo soundtrack was remastered to 5.1 surround at 24-bit from 35mm 4-track magnetic audio stems, and approved by Mann. Clicks, thumps, hiss, and hum were manually removed using Pro Tools HD. Crackle was attenuated using AudioCube's integrated workstation.
Transfer supervisors: Lee Kline, Michael Mann.
Colorist: Gregg Garvin/Modern VideoFilm, Burbank.""

I haven't seen this movie in years and the first thing I noticed was the vibrant colors of the night scenes of which there are many.  Mann pulled this off by using water on the streets which reflected the light.  The shots always include big and little neon signs of various colors.  Its a remarkable effect.  Also check out Franks closely shaven face.  Caan obviously has a dense beard and even closely shaven, you can see the darkness of the stubble.  The transfer has excellent blacks and is free of any anomalies.  Audio comes by way of DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and is perfectly done as well.  There is no sounds other than what is supposed to be there.  Tangerine Dreams soundtrack is better than I remember it.  Subtitles only in English SDH.  Extras include a trailer, separate interviews with Mann, Caan and Tangerine Dreams Johannes Schmoelling.  The audio commentary by Mann and Caan from the earlier DVD is also included as well as a booklet featuring an essay by critic Nick James.",1486425600,,4550,4.770806658130602

The main characters are complete cretins; the heist part is really poor (maybe great 20 years ago, but now it seems like a joke); the soundtrack terrible (that's for my taste, maybe others like Tangerine Dream though); the plot doesn't make any sense; specially the last 10 minutes. We were watching this thing lowering our expectations as things are going on, but still waiting that something happens that makes the movie back to good (after all the great reviews). Forget it, that never happens; when the movie is over you'll be in your sofa asking yourself: that was it? and feeling bad for having spent 2 hours of your time watching this.",1483574400,,805,4.676056338028169

150559,3,0792838947,"This is a fairly decent classic B movie without the condescending T&A.  From the outset, it wants you to root for the 'bad guy' because he's just stealing from the uber wealthy.  When someone wants to muscle in on his take and 'steal' from him, it becomes personal.  The technology is outdated for anyone born after 1990...so, not likely to find an audience there...

If you have followed James Caan (can't believe the billing of my review 'dialog' says ""Thief (new line) James Belushi"" as if this isn't a James Caan film!) for many years and haven't seen this film, you will want to see it.  Otherwise, it is tough to recommend...particularly to a 'younger' generation, who may recognize his voice as ""Flint's Dad"" in Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs.

Caan's best role is still (IMO) Brian Piccolo next to Billy Dee Williams in ""Brian's Song.""  This movie is okay, but no Brian's Song by far.  If you're an 'old schooler' then the ancient technology and lack of 'computers' in hacking the security of a building probably won't bother you, but anything as recent as the mid-90s is going to seem light years ahead of this piece.

I recently watched it 'for free' on Prime because I hadn't seen it in quite some time (at least a couple of decades or more).

Watch it if you're a Tuesday Weld fan.  Watch it if you're a Willie Nelson fan.  He is the only person in the 'play' that seems genuinely 'engaged' with the other actor during the dialog scenes.  If you're a Robert Prosky fan, then you have to watch it.  One of my favorite lines of all times is when he delivers a ""You can't polish a turd"" from Christine.  And, if you liked him in The Last Action Hero, you can start to appreciate his range.

Overall the movie is very so-so.  Back in 1981 is was a lot more interesting and exciting.  Today, with the recent James Bond and Mission Impossible sequels, it is tough to compare this to 'modern' action movies.  It is a bit more 'raw' in some ways, so that preserves it somewhat.  Watch it because you're a fan of some of the actors in it, not because it is the best movie on the planet.",1461542400,,2092,4.4267015706806285

150582,4,0792838947,"Not sure why James Belushi is the headliner.  James Caan is the star of this early, critically acclaimed heist movie by Michael Mann (Miami Vice, Heat, Last of the Mohicans).  This movie has been studied and analyzed by the greats of how-to cinema studies including Blake Snyder in his classic, ""Save the Cat.""

James Caan plays a career thief who unwittingly gets double-crossed on a job for hire.  He exacts revenge for the wrong done to him.

The movie feels dated in a good way, like a precursor to Mann's hit 1980's TV series, Miami Vice.  This is really brought out by the electronic score composed and performed by Tangerine Dream.  Upon this viewing I was struck by the many similarities to Mann's later crime feature, Heat.  I thought maybe Thief could have been a prequel since many of the themes are repeated in Heat.

Is the point entertainment no matter what you have to do to get there? High testosterone, attitude, all the lowest human vices are on display, and just when you think, hey, Caan will get out, go somewhere with his lady and their 'kid', nope, not to be. In the end there really is no satisfaction and revenge wins out. Still, if you can get past the 'creep' factor, it really is pretty good. The soundtrack, used sparingly, is very effective I think. And Caan, he makes Burt Reynolds look like a prissy pussy. He is one scary guy.",1455840000,,706,4.356060606060606

  James Caan gives a direct no nonsense performance that strikes one as 100% genuine
 And the rest of the cast is very well cast
 The story itself is in my opinion excellent with a blatant sense of realism all backed up with a driving score from tangerine dream
 The back story on the authorship of the tale is quite a tale in itself

150638,5,0792838947,"The crime film to end all crime films.  James Caan and Tuesday Weld are two actors that should be remembered when one talks of movie greats.  Tuesday Weld came along in the fifties as a child star and excelled in the craft.  Like Elizabeth Taylor, child star, of the forties, did Miss Weld ever go through an awkward period but steadily grown in experience graduating fluidly from child to teen to adult star.  Unlike so many others she out shown older actors with her flawless, insightful performances and in Thief she gives a brilliant and heartbreaking one as the woman Mr. Caan loves and who he builds his hopes and dreams of a normal life on and who he ultimately has to send away..  Mr. Caan, once again, as in The Gambler, gives an electric, knowing performance.  The two actors are people we may not like but understand and we are pulling for them even though we know, in the back of our minds, that things will not turn out well for them.  Miss Weld is the heart of the piece going from beaten down beauty to beautiful earthmother.  When Mr. Caan has to send her away and tells her she means nothing to him she knowingly lets him off easy without recrimination, though her heart is breaking.  There are several scenes where these two actors play off each other wordlessly, however, there isn't a line needed to be uttered by either of them because they now each other so well in the performances.  This film is probably what acting is all about.  A grim, beautiful film.  It should be studied in acting classes because these are two of the true greats in cinema and you don't get to see films being made like this anymore.  I only cringe, because the remake of the Gambler just came out and was a disappointment.  I can only think some unwise meatheads in Hollywood are thinking ""Maybe we should make Thief with Owen Wilson.""  Cringe.",1448064000,5,1843,4.509036144578313

Unfortunately, Tangerine Dream's 1981 show-off-the-synthesizer effects trounced on it. It was like spending an evening with fascinating friends, interrupted several times by drunk neighbors.
But it could have been worse. Most of the dialogue scenes were uncontaminated.

In the Criterion edition, ""white"" does not exist. Even a white wall has a tint of blue.  They also screwed up Cronenberg's Scanners last year by dripping blue over everything, but I figured that was a fluke.  Now, until I hear otherwise, I will avoid all future Criterion releases.

150656,5,0792838947,"Classic crime thriller Director Michael mann started off Directing TV show episodes & TV movies
before actually Directing feature length films
and THIEF is Michael's first film as Director & writer based on real actual events of Frank Hohimer
Filmed in 1980 released in Theaters 1981
Thief's about safe cracker Frank Hohimer played brilliantly by Actor James caan
who plans to leave the criminal world behind him after one final Diamond Heist
but Discovering escape is not as simple as he hoped
Brilliant performance by James caan he nails the role perfectly
James Belushi, his first film plays Barry, Franks partner
Tuesday weld plays Frank's love interest Jessie
Michael mann also wrote the screenplay aswell as Directing the film

first released on DVD back in 1998 with only Audio commentary as an extra
the staff at Criterion collection Decided to release the film again on Blu-ray this time, it's been a long time coming
but this classic thriller is finally on blu-ray with an all new 4k High Definition transfer in 1:85:1 widescreen
approved by Michael mann himself & it's Michael's Directors cut version in a new HD transfer
with added footage inserted back in the film NOT RATED 124mins
and i tell you the picture quality does look amazing very clear & sharp picture nice bright colours, no Grain or Dirt
incredible picture quality for sure, better than the old DVD release of course
plus the sound quality has been boosted to a new 5.1 Master audio mix, sounds Great through my surround sound system

it does not stop there
Criterion have also added new special features along with the old DVD commentary by Michael mann & James caan
new extras is a New interview with Michael mann added for this blu-ray release
Michael talks in Great Detail about how he started getting into films
he talks about the screenplay and how it's based on real life events of safe Cracker Frank Hohimer
Michael talks about Jerry Bruckheimer who was the producer for THIEF
he also talks about getting the right cast for the film, talks about James caan, Tuesday weld, Robert prosky
and other things about THIEF aswell
very interesting interview goes for 24mins
new interview with Actor James caan, James talks mainly about his character Frank
he talks about working with Tuesday weld, and meeting/working with Michael mann
another Great interview only goes for 10mins thou
and another new interview with Music composer Johannes schmoelling from the band Tangerine Dream
Johannes did the music score for THIEF
the interview is in German language i think which has English subtitles
but Johanne talks about how he got involved with Michael mann for the film, he talks about the music score etc
tragically no new interview with Actress Tuesday weld it would've been Great to hear her comments about THIEF
Tuesday is 70 yo now still alive and well

there's also a thick booklet that comes with this blu-ray
the 4k transfer is talked about in this booklet, it says the black bars at the top & bottom of the screen are normal
for the 1:85:1 widescreen format of THIEF, well i can tell you there are no black bars on the screen when i play the blu-ray
not on my widescreen TV anyway so i think that's misleading info
there's a 2nd Disc in this case, it's the DVD version of the film which i didn't bother with
Blu-ray is the technology to watch now, DVD is out the window

so time to upgrade for sure get this new blu-ray version by Criterion collection incredible picture quality & new extras to
5 stars i gave it",1425513600,3,3495,4.743421052631579

150698,5,0792838947,"A lot of things have been written about the movie, so I'll concentrate on just a few of the more esoteric items:

1.  The safe cracking and burger alarm bypassing was completely realistic.  The first safe was a drill and punch job where the lock was punched out the back of the safe door so the unlocking handle could be turned.  If you watch carefully in the first scene there is a continuity error where some safety chains for the drill suddenly show up.  It takes skill to drill through that much metal without breaking a bunch of drill bits.  Used to burglar alarms that went to alarm companies did so by keeping a phone line open and sending a different voltage down the line, if the alarm opened the voltage dropped and the alarm company knew something was up--what Belushi was doing (with all those electrical gauges) was looking for the lines with the different voltages then bypassing them so the alarm company would not detect the break in.  Obsolete today, but spot on back then.  Thermal lances (used in the last scene) do just what the movie showed; a scrap yard / steel mill might have them to cut up scrap metal, especially big chunks of iron left over in a crucible, etc.

2.  Mann had Caan go to Gunsite in Arizona to learn how to shoot using the ""modern"" technique.  The director of the school, Col. Cooper,  said that there was no way an ex con at that time would have been using the technique and scoffed at the whole thing, but one of the instructors (Chuck Taylor) taught him anyway.  By the way, there were about a dozen people on three continents who found out that Col Cooper, and Chuck Taylor--between being military officers and government contractors in cold war hot spots--really were the last person in the world they would ever f*** with, or do anything else with for that matter.  The two handed Weaver stance, the tactical reload, ""slicing the pie"", double tap, the use of the 45 auto, those were the latest things at that time.  In the final scene on the lawn when Frank reloads it is not a filming error (the slide not being locked back), rather it was a ""tactical"" reload where a magazine is changed before the slide locked back (while there was still a round in the chamber).  At the time students were supposed to count their shots and reload before running dry.

3.  He was wearing a bullet proof vest in the last shoot out--it was in the script, and it was visible when he was in the closet at his house giving the money to his wife.  The bad guy that shot him was using a (now obsolete) High Standard bull pup shotgun that was designed so it could be shot with one arm.  Some policemen used them in the 1970's.

Anyway, great film.  Great sound track.  The movie has a lot in it if a person watches carefully.  There is a good balance between being a heist film and developing the characters, a heck of a performance from all the actors.  Why aren't movies made like this anymore?",1410912000,4,2921,4.435272045028142

He creates emphathy for a character that is essentially a ""bad man"" - a thief.

Its amazing they had all of the original source elements in tact from over thirty years ago and were able to make these kinds of adjustments. The aspect ratio is the same as the MGM Pan and scan which came out in 98 but man o man is there a difference in picture quality.  If any directors films are worthy of the blu-ray upgrade its Michael Mann. If you loved his other pictures Heat, Collateral and Miami Vice behold, this is the very film that started it all; Big Cities, Bright lights, crime and pretty women.  My favorite two scenes in the film are the opening; when we see the neon lights, the fog and drizzling rain in one of the back alleys of a rough section of Chicago.  The second of course would be the diner scene, between James Caan and Tuesday Weld.  Caan reveals in the directors commentary with Mann that this was his all-time favorite scene as an actor.  Willie Nelson was also part of the supporting cast and he was magnificent as well.

Yet, this film inspired me so much to reinvent my life and make the long term comeback as I have. Sometimes we go to the movies and we have an epiphany of such proportions that it is a life changing event. Since I do collect films this Blu-ray disc incarnation is my 3rd purchase of this title all the way from VHS then to DVD and now in this truly magnificent form which makes this film such a joy to watch on my big screen TV and crank up the sound on my home theater system. Of course what people forget is the soundtrack by Tangerine Dream was magnificent then as it is now which I also bought on LP record, then cassette tape, and then on CD which I own 2 versions of because for some reason they did not put all the music on one disc. Needless to say I have all the music from the movie which is spectacular and helped to modernize soundtrack music today as we know it. Now, the Armani clothes Mr. Caan wore in this film provided by the then famous clothing store, "" CHARIVARI "" are so timeless especially in today's world where virtually any style goes. That 3/4 length leather coat and those suits are just superb. Then we get to the then early 80's Cadillac Eldorado Biarritz in black in it's just freshly downsized form that gave Mr. Caan's jewel thief character  of ""Frank"" the final touch as far as accoutrements go. The scene in the diner with Tuesday Weld is priceless simply because I can totally relate after having my own scene like that in a diner one time. Yet, it's a great piece of acting with these Mr. Caan & Ms. Weld on top of their game way back when. Robert Prosky as the heavy was a nice surprise when I saw this film the first time. He had gotten into the acting game late as an older man, but as a bad guy he shines. The other scene I love is where Frank goes to get his money from the plating company with his completely fearless character. Let's not forget Willie Nelson either who plays ""Okla"" who is Frank's mentor and father figure who in character reminds Frank that there are still good people to love like surrogate parents no matter how bad things get. I also bought the original book called ""The Home Invaders"" by Frank Hohimer who this film is based upon. This was another piece of the puzzle that helped me to really dig deep into the characters here in this film. Though the film's character of Frank doesn't say so, in the book Frank Hohimer reminds readers to NEVER team up with the MOB as they will start a relationship one way and then want to own you. Needless to say there are many great lessons about life to be learned from this film and whenever I need a little inspiration I put on this film and let it teach me some fresh lessons that I didn't see before.

Finding hypnotic beauty in neon and rain-slick streets, sparks and steel, Thief effortlessly established the moody stylishness and tactile approach to action that would define such later iconic entertainments from Mann as Miami Vice, Manhunter, and Heat.

The improvements in image quality are so dramatic that those who have previously seen Thief only on the non-anamorphic R1 DVD produced years ago will experience an entirely new film.

Thirty five years on and this film still stands up well. Check out a very young William Peterson (CSI's Gil Grissom), blink and you will miss him ! Highly Recommended",1391472000,4,452,4.87012987012987

Some of the actors were real thieves in real life. The special features are great. This film was the precursor of ""Crime Story"". A great first season and so so second season.",1391299200,2,328,4.377049180327869
150768,5,0792838947,"In keeping with Mann's notorious habit of tinkering with his films long after their theatrical release, this version of Thief includes the extra scene from the director's cut with legendary blues musician Willie Dixon on the bank of the Chicago River, but returns the beach sequence to its original length with the music intact. Perhaps the most contentious revision in the 1995 Director's Cut was the awkwardly sped-up effect applied to the climactic gunfight. This version, which Criterion claims was taken from Mann's ""original 35mm answer print,"" restores the slow motion effect to this gunfight.

Some have claimed that the gun-metal bluish tint to this version is a new addition by Mann, but this is in fact the look of the theatrical version, which has been faithful restored to the Blu-Ray's stunning transfer.

Ported over from the 1998 DVD is an audio commentary with Michael Mann and James Caan. It is interesting to note how many real-life cops and crooks worked on this film behind and in front of the camera, which Mann points out at various points. They banter back and forth like old friends and recount all kinds of filming anecdotes in this informative and engaging track.

There is an interview with Mann where he talks about how growing up in Chicago influenced his fascination with cops and criminals. He provides insight into just how little of the source material was used in the film (not much) and instead drew inspiration from actual thieves. Mann also talks about his famous knack for authenticity, which included having Caan learn how to crack a safe and then do it on camera.

Also included is an interview with Caan who says right from the get-go that Thief is one of the films he's most proud of in his career. He talks about first meeting Mann and how the screenplay made him want do it. The veteran actor talks about the training he did to prepare for the role and how he interacted with cops and crooks. Caan tells some fantastic filming anecdotes.

There is an interview with Johannes Schmoelling, formally of German electronic band Tangerine Dream. They composed the film's pulsating score and he talks about joining the group back in the day. He also talks about how they got to score the film and of collaborating with Mann. He recalls the director telling them exactly what he wanted.

150776,5,0792838947,"Thief (1981) is a gritty crime drama from writer-director Michael Mann.

 James Caan stars as Frank, a tough professional safe-cracker who prefers to work alone, but finds himself trapped between an organized crime family and a squad of corrupt police.

Frank made himself vulnerable to these nefarious influences when he decided to normalize his life; to go legitimate after pulling off one or two more big diamond heists.  He married world-weary restaurant cashier Tuesday Weld and, with the help of a crime boss (Robert Prosky), he was able to adopt a child.  But now, there are complications.

Caan and, especially, Ms. Weld, deliver what are (arguably) the finest performances of their careers in this powerful, violent drama, filmed primarily in Chicago.  James Belushi and Willie Nelson co-starand look for Dennis Farina in a small role.  Its one of his first movies.

The new dual format set (Blu-Ray/DVD) from The Criterion Collection contains several nice extras, including a new digital restoration from a 4K film transfer of the directors cut (approved by Michael Mann).  There is also audio commentary by both Mann and Caan, plus new individual interviews with Mann, Caan and Johannes Schmoelling of the band Tangerine Dream, which contributed the films soundtrack.  All content is available on both the Blu-Ray and DVD discs.

Finally, there is a booklet featuring an essay by film critic Nick James.

It has always bummed me out that the home video offerings of this movie were sub par. I thought the DVD was terrible. Watching the Criterion Blu-ray is like seeing the movie again for the first time. The night time footage on my plasma HDTV look insanely good. I watch this movie and I'm simply amazed on how well Criterion has done this transfer. The fact that the movie looks this good after more than 30 years is awesome. Simply put this is a beautiful transfer and any fan of this movie is going to be very happy.

The sound on this Criterion blu-ray is also awesome! The audio is probably as impressive if not more so than the video. Tangerine Dream's atmospheric soundtrack has never sounded better. The dialog, the shootouts, the safe cracking sounds are all perfect.

I'm very happy with this purchase. This blu-ray is well worth the $25. I wish there were some other similar movies that were not really popular that would get this treatment. The extras were modest but nice. All the interviews are in HD and done recently. i really enjoyed watching them. Highly recommended!",1389830400,18,1318,4.483333333333333

When I say the film is 'gritty' I don't mean that the movie deals with tough subject matter, I mean the actual film is gritty and unrefined. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, while the movie is not Heat, it did provide a great stepping stone for Michael Mann to get to his opus that is Heat. The best thing about this movie is undoubtedly Jimmy Caan. His character is one tough SOB and a protagonist to be rivaled with few in the genre. He doesn't take any crap from anybody. This is one of the best heist movies you could ever see and with the stylized direction it really embodies the early 1980's.

While THIEF entertains throughout, I thought I had missed the first twenty minutes as I didn't know why Okla, played by Willie Nelson, who is mentor of Frank, played by Caan, means so much to Frank.  While Caan and Nelson communicate a lot of their connection in their one scene together  -  perhaps THIEF's most powerful moment  - I'll bet there were one or two other Caan-Nelson segments that did not make the final cut.

I admire THIEF for not softening Frank's brusque manner, leaving his integrity as enough reason to root for him.  I wish I were half as tough as Frank, not that I'd want to pay even half the price he did to become the man he is.

While I am not going to give away what happens, I'll say THIEF presents as challenging a conclusion to a film as I've seen.  Some walk away victorious, others walk away in loss, and some just walk away.

One might even call it a hidden gem. (Did you see what I did there?)

A surprisingly large number of debut performances are on offer here: sidekick James Belushi, plus Dennis Farina and William Petersen in small roles. Robert Prosky, too, is fantastic in his film debut (at age 50!): ""I'll whack out ya whole family. People'll be eatin' 'em in their lunch tomorrow in their Wimpyburgers and not know it.""

Thief was also Michael Mann's directorial debut, and serves as a useful bookend (along with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Heat/dp/B000P0J0AG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Heat</a>) to a decades-long love of professional thieves. Mann used legitimate techniques and employed on-set technical advisers in the form of professional burglars in order to get the realism right, especially the oxy lance. Thief is also the source of one of the best lines ever uttered in cinema: ""I change cars like other guys change their fuking shoes. I'm a thief.""

Even the minor characters are given plausibility, especially John Santucci who portrays Urizzi, the slimy crooked cop who works Caan over in an effort to squeeze payoffs out him in return for looking the other way. When I originally viewed Thief in the theater, I wanted to shower after being exposed to Santucci's character. I have this movie in VHS, Laser Disc and DVD. It's one of those movies that didn't do all that well at the box office, but scored two thumbs up from Siskel and Ebert. I highly recommend Thief.

When towards the end, when the lead (James Caan) is sending his wife (Tuesday Welds) away with their adopted baby son that they have, he gives her $410,000 dollars to take with her. Then I started thinking, well here is his human caring side.

Nope, not to be, he then goes ahead and instructs his wife, who he is kicking out, that she has to pay the guy he is sending to be her driver on this journey $20,000 on the first month, $25,000 on the second month, $30.000 on the third month, etc.  How long is $410,000 going to last if she has to keep paying this guy incrementally larger amounts?

10/11: Well, Michael Mann does it again. I've been looking for other films of his after exhausting the usual ones, and Thief is one of them that I've never seen. When I got the chance to see it, it's so good and so Michael Mann. I've been a fan of Jimmy Caan because of his distinct acting style, and he is really impressive in Thief. In fact, it's probably the best of his career besides Brian's Song. I've never seen anything so visually appealing as I've in Thief, and if I have to choose, I pick it over The Asphalt Jungle. The story is well-done, but it's the performances of the cast that put the film another level along with the Michael Mann style to go along with it. I've never seen James Belushi to act this good either. He does look perfect to play the guy from the 70's what we call Son of Sam. Probably the best scene of any point in the film is the conversation between Jimmy Caan and Tuesday Weld in the caf. Why Thief is so important is because after five years later making it comes a legendary film called Manhunter that Michael Mann would use so many elements from Thief and also Miami Vice to corporate into. It becomes obvious later that Heat is a very, very similar film to Thief. All in all, Thief is worth watching for all die-hard Michael Mann fans.",1318032000,,1298,4.297959183673469

150888,5,0792838947,"James Caan's had an up-and-down career, but at his best he was one of the most riveting actors in film. Thief is definitely Caan at his best. Michael Mann has created an amazing character and Caan inhabits him completely. Mann fans expecting the fireworks of Heat or Miami Vice should realize coming in that this is a far more methodical character study. This is where Mann's exploration of the gray areas between ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"" really kicked off. What Thief ""lacks"" in conventional action it more than makes up in suspense and steadily increasing tension. And when it is time for some good old-fashioned violence to go down, Mann doesn't shy away: but he also makes the violence feel real, and really painful. While Caan is utterly fabulous, the supporting cast is just as good, especially the late Robert Prosky. The film even boasts a James Belushi performance that won't make you want to destroy your DVD player. Thief is one of my favorite films, and it's well worth checking out.",1249689600,,997,4.76878612716763
150889,5,0792838947,"Of all of the movie brats -- the first generation of film school grads to become Hollywood directors -- Michael Mann, born in 1943, was the late starter. Scorsese, Lucas, Spielberg, Coppola, DePalma and Schrader all had established their careers by the early '70's; Thief, Mann's debut, arrived with respectful reviews, little fanfare and no commercial impact in 1981. With almost 30 years hindsight, this is the most remarkable inaugural film of all of the aforementioned careers; Mann, the arch-stylist of American cinema, sprang fully formed in Thief, with all of his thematic, aural and visual motifs leaping off the screen.

James Caan, in a tremendous performance, plays Frank, a Chicago car dealer, bar-owner, ex-con, and professional burglar. State-raised in orphanages, a youth in petty crime landed him in a 15 year stretch in prison, where he was given a crash course in violence and tutored in his craft by the one positive influence in his life, a lifer named Okla (Willie Nelson). Now in his early 40's, he plies his trade as a freelance thief of high-end jewlery, looking forward to leveraging that last sweet score into retirement, as he knows time and luck are not on his side. He carries in his wallet a collage he made in prison of children, a house, Okla, the elements of a normal life. When he meets a been-around waitress, Tuesday Weld, he grabs onto her, knowing she is the final picture missing from his life. An avuncular crime lord (Robert Prosky) muscles in gently on Frank's independence, offering him a partnership deal that could provide Frank's ticket out of the life, or else make him the indentured servant of truly loathsome people.

All of Mann's signatures are in place. He knows Frank's world backward and forward, and indeed the supporting cast consists largely of Chicago lawmen and safecrackers who were consultants on the film. The look of the movie contrasts Mann's dual background in nonfiction film and advertising-- absolute documentary vermisillitude ( the film's centerpiece is a real-time heist that makes burglary look like a particularly arduous form of blue-collar subcontracting) and high design. Mann excels at night-time prowls around the streets of Chicago, a visual symphony of rain-slicked streets, reflections off of car chrome and store windows, vertiginous architecturally-based compositions, and expressionist neon. All scored to the electronic blasts provided by Tangerine Dream, a crowning touch.

But at the center of the film is the Mann man. Frank is a pro, obessively dedicated to a job he excels at, isolated, alone, craving a normal life and knowing it is foreclosed to him. Caan comports himself with the aura of a man you don't want to mess with, but his pinched walk is the swagger of a man nursing a grievous wound. His periodic explosions of temper are less the fireworks displays of the '70's rebel figure (think Jack Nicholson) than the slightly sociopathic slippages of control on the part of a man who has meticulously ordered his life to keep his demons at bay and finds that he is not in control at all. Two heist scenes aside, their is only one scene of gunplay, coming at the film's end. This is a study of character and environment, most powerful when little in particular is happening: Caan working his legit and illegit jobs, driving through the infernal city, visiting Okla in jail, courting his woman. The most memorable scene in the film is when Caan cracks an un-crackable safe, a feat of daring, hard work, risk, and ingenuity, and then lets his crew empty the contents; he pulls off his welding mask, sits down and smokes a cigarette, an exhausted, joyless, abstracted look on his face that Mann's camera lingers on for an eternity, that is absolutely real.

Mann has since explored variations on this theme with vastly increased budgets, superstar casts, and greatly heightened technical skills. But there is a freshness and integrity and strong dose of reality in Thief that he has yet to quite touch, even in Heat, his masterpiece in the genre. All that was missing from his arsenal was his ability to stage a shoot-out -- the Peckinpah-isms are undigested and poorly staged. Mann would educate himself in spades in this department. Otherwise this is a flawless little genre gem, too often referred to as neo-noir when it feels more like Wong Kar-Wai and Kieslowski with guns -- except neither of those arty guys had made their first features yet. Mann anticipated them in his glorious meditation on urban lonliness and fate.",1249171200,5,4519,4.965653896961691

150914,4,0792838947,"The pulsing synth-rock of Tangerine Dream really sets the tone for this ultra-stylish and sleek noir heist gone bad film. The film is like a well oiled machine and when you hear the synthesizers roar into action you know that something extremely bad is going down. This synthesizer noir film has a menace that never lets up.

Michael Mann isn't much for giving his criminals and cops bios or personalities or much else; his characters don't even have last names, they are just hunters or the hunted. James Caan plays ""Frank"". Frank's a car dealer by day and jewel thief by night and as an ex con who has spent 11 of his 35 years in prison Frank knows that he doesn't have a second to lose and that the odds and the fates are against him. Nevertheless he's trying to defy his loner's fate by assembling a family (that includes a recently met waitress played by Tuesday Weld and an adopted child) but he seems to know from the start that plans do not have a way of working out. So far his life has been like a big blank that he's trying to fill in but he just can't seem to beat those odds and those fates that have somehow decided ahead of time that he is predestined to fail are breathing down his neck. Frank doesn't have a real family. He went straight from orphanage to prison house. And everywhere Frank has been he's been mistreated. Still he keeps fighting back. In prison he was beaten within inches of his life by a gang of predators attempting to rape him but Franks the kind of guy who fought back and left his assailants in worse shape than they left him. The recently released from prison Frank is a guy that you don't want to cross. Still each time Frank pulls off a heist someone screws him over. All Frank wants is to make one big score so he can settle down with his make-shift family but there's always someone getting in the way of Franks big payday.

Virtually the entire movie takes place at night and so every scene is lit with Mann's signature neon lights. Frank runs a car dealership as a cover for his real occupation and the car dealership is always eerily lit by little bulbs that make the lot of cars seem unreal. Its as if the entire film were bathed in an unnatural slightly blurred glow. Its an effect that I've seen in Brian DePalma films and it seems to create a kind of surreal or hyper-real aura . The slightly blurred artificial lighting that we see in the car lot and in the various bar scenes is like a motif that works with the music to create a sense of an all-pervasive menace and both of these things also contribute to the feeling that Frank's view of the world may be slightly skewed. The music by the way is reminiscent of the music in William Friedkin's SORCERER, another film known for its unrelenting menace.

Caan is impeccable as always and even though he's really only given a barely there character to play he has a way of making us feel this anonymous state raised guy's pain and desperation.  The first time we see Frank he is using a drill to open a safe and Frank seems to be one with the tools of his trade. Frank also seems to want life to operate as purely as the machines he uses but life is never as predictable or reliable as a machine. When things don't go as planned its like an indication that things will never go as planned and so you can understand why the highly organized Frank flies off the handle at the slightest hint of more failure. We understand Frank's rage each time a plan falls apart and we also know that Frank knows that this is quite possibly his last chance to make a life. So when a deceptively kind mob boss who poses as a father figure betrays Frank we know things will not end well. Usually Frank works alone or with a team that he assembles but he allows himself to be lured in by the boss's fatherly charms. We somehow know this will be a fatal mistake for one of them. The original deal was that Frank would do one big score for the mob boss and then retire but once the score is complete the mob boss not only refuses to pay Frank his fair share depriving Frank yet again of that elusive payday but he also insists that Frank now works for him thus threatening to steal from Frank the thing he values most, his independence. In order to assure this new deal the mob boss threatens to prostitute his new wife if he doesn't comply. Frank knows he cannot accept these terms which tear at his dream of a family and his independence and we know the mob boss who has destroyed Franks dream is going to get the worst that Frank has ever given when we hear those synthesizers begin to pulse and we see that neon glow burn once again. The ultraviolent finale is one of the most intense and nasty noir codas on film.

Excellent supporting cast including Tuesday Weld as Franks wife and James Belushi as his trusted heist accomplice but this is primarily a James Caan tour de force.

150915,4,0792838947,"If Caan made this movie to breakout from his Sonny Corleone persona, then he chose an excellent vehicle. Director Michael Mann takes the viewer by the scruff of their neck from the opening scene to the haunting finale. Tangerine Dream provides the auditory stimulation that makes the listener feel as if they're part of Caan's latest heist and the director of photography gives the viewer just a touch of claustraphobia as we get inside Canns mind and fractured soul.

  Caan plays the title character Frank, an ex-con and jewel thief who knows his star is about to burn out and will stop at nothing to complete his version of the good life. James Belushi plays his partner in crime and Tuesday Weld plays Frank's love interest. Caan later makes the mistake of getting involved with Robert Prosky's (of Hill Street Blues fame) character and soon Caan's life goes into a predicatble freefall.

  The story is fairly straightforward, but the combo of Caan, Mann, and Tangerine Dream makes for a mesmerizing experience. Although the frantic and chaotic trip through Frank's life makes for terrific movie making, the Willie Nelson character acts as an anchor, on an otherwise thrilling rollercoaster ride. In truth, I may simply have not liked Willie Nelson himself in this role, though.

This movie is based on the book ""The Home Invaders"" by Frank Hohimer, himself a professional thief.  (Hohimer was serving time in prison at the time this movie was being made.)

Meet Frank (James Caan), the lone wolf ""worker"" of this movie.  He says the following to his eventual wife Jessie (Tuesday Weld):

""I wear $150 slacks, I wear silk shirts, I wear $800 suits, I wear a gold watch, I wear a perfect, flawless...three-carat ring, I change cars like other guys change their...shoes.  I'm a [jewel] thief.""

The quotation that titles this review is what Frank says when he's mad.

This movie follows the life of an aging jewel thief whose only dream now is to retire from his ""trade"" and have a family.  A Chicago syndicate boss Leo (Robert Prosky) offers him to do a heist that will make his dreams come true.  The lone wolf is not used to working with others and things don't go according to plan.

This is a gritty, very realistic crime drama.  In fact, the thief's ""tools of the trade"" used by James Caan are authentic and not props.  Real-life thieves were used to play bit parts in this movie.  The dialogue is want you would expect among thieves (and thus is foul).

James Caan as Frank steals (no pun intended) the show.  His acting is magnificent.  Robert Prosky as the mob boss Leo also does a decent job.  Willie Nelson has a small part in this movie as the old thief who taught Frank everything he knows.

Some people find the background music associated with this movie bad.  I, however, disagree.  I found it exhilarating.  As well, this is a very colorful movie in parts.

The DVD (special director's edition) itself is perfect in picture and sound clarity.  It has a few extras, all of them interesting.

Finally, I did have a few problems with this movie.  First, there is James Belushi as Barry, Frank's trusted aid.  Belushi is a comic (he was even when this movie was made) even though he does not play a comic in this movie.  I felt he undermined the realism of the movie due simply to his comic reputation.  Second, this movie is somewhat slow moving in its first half but picks up considerably in its second half.  Lastly, the movie is predictable but, as I stated above, Caan's excellent performance, the dialogue, the music, and the color of the movie keep you interested.

In conclusion, this is a slick crime drama where James Caan gives one of his best performances!!

A slow-moving character study, THIEF plods along and then ends very abruptly and rather unsatisfyingly, as if Michael Mann, the director, decided it was time to end the film. To me, THIEF doesn't seem to know where it is going, which is okay for a character study and better than the slick but mindless action of a MR AND MRS SMITH, which has no character. James Caan should have received his acting certification from this role, if not from some earlier films, for a job well done as Frank, the ex-con, independent-minded professional safe cracker wanting to retire. Tuesday Weld is nice to look at as his girlfriend and James Belushi turns in a quiet, subdued performance. This is a 1981 film with no cell phones and almost funny-looking cars. The bad guys in THIEF are creditable and scary enough but, overall, there just doesn't seem to be enough tension or conflict to sustain the suspense, which gets us back to THIEF being a character study of Frank, the thief.

Recently I bought a SONY BRAVIA 32 INCH display and I have a collection of over 600 Dvds. I learned now about ""Enhanced for 16x9 TVs"" and how important it is, I did not care about it or even know about it since I own a standard TV, however all my Dvds are Region 1 and in widescreen, I never buy fullscreen Dvds. So I did an inventory on my collection and realized the following:

Out of 600+ Dvds, 42 are NOT enhanced for 16x9 TVs and they really look horrible when I played them on my PC. Anyway, according to my inventory.

150939,3,0792838947,"While Michael Mann's first theatrical film, Thief, has style to spare and is as high-tech as they come for heist thrillers, it is severely lacking in character depth and sympathy.

I enjoyed this movie, but not for the reasons that I thought I would.  I have seen and loved Michael Mann's ""The Insider"", ""Manhunter"", and especially his crime opus ""Heat"".  These were highly-stylish, technically-intriguing, but also heavily character driven stories.  The characters in ""Thief"" seemed very static, and very cold.  The ones we are meant to sympathize with are not developed enough, and the rest are so desolate they seem almost sociopathic.

Caan's performance is great to watch, as is usually the case.  He handles the tough guy stuff great, and the limited amount of positive emotions he's given to convey are well displayed, but hard to justify, and the script often has him flipping switches at an unintentionally amsuing rate.

The score by Tangerine Dream works well (although it severely dates the film, and the closing scene's sound like a bad attempt at ""Comfortably Numb"" by Pink Floyd with the chords rearranged--the same thing that happens during the score for ""Manhunter"" oddly enough), and it is kind of fun to see future Mann alumni William Peterson and Dennis Farina in bit roles as a bartender and a bodyguard respectively.

Not bad for his first time out at bat, but he really didn't find his stride until ""Manhunter"".",1113436800,,1434,4.991596638655462
150940,5,0792838947,"Thief is Mann's first film and a kind of precursor to Heat, his 1995 crime 'epic'.

Extremely stylish and well-made, Thief is the story of Frank (James Caan), a lone-wolf, highline cat burglar working Chicago.  Making up for time lost in the joint, Frank takes down 'scores' and one day comes across the mob as he's trying to collect on some 'downed merch'.

The film is gritty, violent, and credible.  Mann goes for realism all the way, and styles it heavily with great camera work, a pulsing Tangerine Dream score, and great performances all around, especially Caan, and Robert Prosky as Leo, the big shot who handles the fence for half of Chicago.  Leo comes across as a gentle bear early on, but he goes on to deliver some classic lines, making him a totally sinister and underrated bad guy.

Apparently, real thieves and cops (who appear in the cast) 'consulted' on this film, and all of the safes and tools that Caan handles are real--he's really breaking into vaults in those scenes.

Nice DVD.  A trailer, but importantly, a commentary from Mann and Caan, who especially loves this film as it gave him a chance to do some of his best acting.  The commentary appears to have been taken from an early 1990s laser disc.

Highly recommended.  Many plot points and a couple of scenes are redone in Heat (which itself was a remake of a TV movie called LA Takedown, another Mann outing).",1111104000,7,1388,4.624489795918367

A rather semi-obscure flick, but see this film!  The dialogue, acting and screenplay are all top-notch.  Musical score by Tangerine Dream adds to an already fabulous movie.  Robert Proskie almost steals the show from Caan (well, not quite) as the Godfather-figure who tries (unsuccessfully) to lure Caan into his fold.

For those who say this movie isn't violent, sure it is.  Perhaps not by ""21st century standards"", and that is to the good.  In fact, even the last 20 minutes of the movie could have been ""toned down"" with the same, if not better, effect.  I always get the feeling that graphic violence is put in these types of movies as a stop-gap measure for those who don't appreciate the fine acting and directing - ""Thief"" is no exception here.

Tuesday Weld, Jim Belushi and Willie Nelson as Caan's father figure/role model.

Yes, the transfer is poor, but considering the DVD can be had new for cheap, it is a ""steal"".  One of the best crime/drama flicks of the modern era.",1109548800,5,1135,4.541871921182266

The story may be familiar, but when the cast and the location are this good, everything old and familiar is recast as something special. James Caan's performance is also the best of his long career. There is not a single note out of place. The characters lives are etched on their faces, the grittiness does not come across as Hollywood manufactured.

Michael Mann imprinted his signature style on this fierce tale of a career criminal caught in the nightmare of a dream gone bad and a life that could never exist. THIEF is distingushed by its incredible visuals and hard dialogue... the most frightening of both is an exchange between a silent, face up Caan and Robert Prosky (a powerhouse as Leo) in a back alley shop with an acid bath at arms length.  THIEF is the prototype for the new era film noir and Mann a skilled and worthy architect of the genre. William L. Petersen appears for a second as a bartender and Dennis Farina makes his acting debut as a shotgun toting mobster.",1085443200,2,850,4.6466666666666665

150968,5,0792838947,"I first saw this film soon after it was released, having no idea what to expect, except that it was filmed in my home town (Chicago) and that it starred James Caan whose work I had admired so much in The Godfather. I neither knew nor cared who directed it (Michael Mann) and had no idea which group provided the musical soundtrack (Tangerine Dream). Wow! I enjoyed Thief so much I returned to see it again the next evening, dragging along some friends who knew even less about it than I did only 24 hours before. In my opinion, this is Caan's finest performance as Frank, a middle-aged jewel thief who is obviously determined to make a long-cherished dream come true: Retire from his criminal life, marry, start a family, and live happily ever after. He carries a photo collage in his wallet as a daily reminder of the ""life"" he one day hopes to have. He shares it only with Jessie (Tuesday Weld) because she is the only person with whom he wants to share that life. Meanwhile, Frank has met with Leo (Robert Prosky) who seems to take a paternal interest in Frank but only to gain his trust so that Frank will agree to an assignment for the mob. Of course, Leo has no intention of allowing him to retire. Once involved with the mob, Frank will have no way out except death. After he and Jessie marry and move into a lovely home, they are frustrated in their attempts to adopt a child so Leo provides one (""Boy or girl? Whatever you want."") and much of Frank's dream has come true. One last lucrative theft and....

Under Mann's direction, all of the performances are outstanding. I was especially interested in the care with which the major theft is planned and then executed. When Frank then realizes that he cannot free himself from the mob, he reacts with prudence (to protect his wife and child) and then with rage and vengeance. The soundtrack and cinematography are brilliantly integrated within the narrative. The editing by Mann and Dov Hoenig is lean and sharply-focused. When I saw Thief again recently, it had lost none of its dramatic impact; moreover, I recognized this time around certain nuances of character and plot development which I had missed before. I include it on my list of great films which have never been fully appreciated, probably because -- until the VHS and CD versions -- so few people had been able to see it. No excuses now.

The DVD version includes a commentary by Mann and Caan, deleted scenes, and footage not shown in theaters. I also strongly recommend the CD of the Tangerine Dream soundtrack which evokes so many memorable images from the film but, for those who have not as yet seen it, offers great listening in its own right.",1063756800,39,2671,4.5741127348643005
150969,4,0792838947,James Caan does a spectacular job of portraying a thief caught between the mob and starting a new life.

Not sense the Godfather has James Caan had a better role. This movie is the kind of Great drama we can expect from Michael Mann who brought us Heat, The Insider, Manhunter and Ali. Caan is both menacing and vulnerable at the same time. He seems like nothing bothers him on the outside but lets you in just enough to understand.",1017532800,,1032,4.165
150973,5,0792838947,"In his finest role to date, veteran actor James Caan plays Frank, an ultra-cool, independent jewel thief with some very definite plans.  Frank reluctantly gets involved with a mobster who changes all those plans.  Frank is ""Joe the boss of my own Universe"" as he tells Leo (Robert Prosky) upon their first meeting.  Unfortunately for Frank, he'll soon find that Leo has become the boss of his universe once he agrees to ""freelance"" for him.  To get free, Frank has to dismantle the picture perfect life he tried to assemble, and start  over again.

This film has a wonderful noir mood with all the atmospheric rain soaked Chicago streets, earthy dialogue and  colorful characters.  These come in the form of crooked DTs and mobster henchmen to name a few, peppering the screen with non-stop action.  These characters feel very real, and keep you riveted throughout.

Director Michael Mann, who also created ""Heat"" and ""Man Hunter"" as well as the ""Miami Vice"" TV classic of the 80s, did some of his best work in this film.  The soundtrack from ""Tangerine Dream"" is no less than outstanding.  The entire score really enhances  every scene.  I especially love the wonderfully sensual sounding lead guitars during the exciting culmination of the story when Frank faces Leo solo to take back his independence.

Willie Nelson as David Okla, master thief that taught Frank his craft, and Dennis Farina in his big screen debut (with BLACK hair!) as one of Leo's henchmen are two of many interesting faces and characters along the way.

Since this is one of my favorite films, I can truly say, if you have never seen ""Thief"",  you've been robbed of a truly great film viewing experience.",1010793600,,1678,4.831578947368421
150974,4,0792838947,"The heist-plot of 'Thief' is old hat - a master-criminal who wants to settle down with his family does one last job to ensure their future security; the police butt in and there is the usual spiralling of violence involving comrades and betrayal, as well as the meticulous focus on the mechanics of the heist.  Even the film's poltical insight - the crooks are blue-collar workers, whose thieving is 'honest' labour involving sweat and technical skill; the bribable police are brutal parasites; the new crime cartels are monopolies swallowing up 'the little man' - is taken from that pioneering heist movie 'Rififi', although it is given a particularly 80s inflection here, with the ugly urban spaces already, in 1981, bearing the scars of Reaganite depletion.
What is unique in 'Thief' is debut director Michael Mann's style.  'Thief' opens with a virtually wordless sequence as James Caan, a thoroughly professional craftsman, does his job with the tools of his trade, which happens to be the dismantling of a safe.  Unlike many heist movies, which use the set-up of collaborative, against-the-clock crime, financed by shady businessmen as a metaphor for the film-making process, 'Thief' as a film can be more profitably compared to the object of Caan's criminality.  'Thief' gleams with a hard, gem-like brilliance, as Mann uses neon light, reflecting and liquid surfaces, geometric shapes, stylised movements and lean visual rhythms to transform the raw materials of crime, violence and city spaces into something shiny and beautiful.
'Thief' tries to contrast the 'formalism' of crime, its methodology and style, where Caan channels his aggression into professional control, with the messiness of the human-interest story, where he is emotionally vulnerable; but Mann seems much more interested in the former, with lumbering dialogue and dragging pace hobbling the latter.  In the crucial scene in which Caan admits to his fiancee his criminal present, prison past and dreams for the future, Mann seems more fascinated by the illuminated symmetry of the motorway outside.  The patient heist sequences, in which the crooks work like factory welders, are much more successful in revealing character.  The astonishing, ritualistic climax, in which Caan is transformed into a kind of Terminator lost in the finale of '2001', has not yet been equalled by Mann.",1010793600,2,2360,5.277333333333333
150975,5,0792838947,"I first saw this movie on the big screen 3 times upon its original release. This movie has the kind of intrigue and noir atmosphere that was incredible in the theatre, and that ""Tangerine Dream"" soundtrack in Dolby surround, was truly unforgettable.

Out on the brightly lit nightime rain soaked streets of Chicago, we meet Frank.  James Caan brings him to life as the all time coolest, sexiest, street savvy and self assured robber to hit the silver screen. In my personal opinion, this remains Caan's finest role to date.

We open as Frank gets shorted in a diamond heist payoff by a fence. By going after his shorted payoff, he meets mobster heavy ""Leo"" played by Robert Prosky.

Leo is impressed with Frank and makes him an offer to come on board as a ""freelancer"". Just ""a couple of moves"" for Frank, and Leo sells Frank the idea that he can make his dreams of independence, financially and personally, come true. There is an unforseen price to be paid.  Watch and find out!!

Frank has a picture collage that represents his life,  and the pictures on it, represent different elements of that life.  When Frank meets Tuesday Weld in a coffee shop he frequents, to get calls about ""moves.""(No cell phones back then!) He persues her relentlessly, having decided she fits one of the pieces of his puzzle. She's skeptical, but, at last, Frank convinces her to ""be"" with him.

Now with the wife piece of the puzzle in place, Frank goes to work for Leo. Soon after, other outside parties are interested in a piece of his action. Frank is annoyed, and the relatioship with Leo begins to sour.

Frank agrees to one final job.  Although successful, the payoff from Leo isn't what he had in mind. Frank is angry that the elements of his puzzle didn't pan out.  He subsequently sets out to destroy all that stands in the way of his dreams.

Finally, when it's payback time, a wonderfully filmed noir slow motion finale begins with that sensual Tangerine Dream soundtrack. I find it very similar to the ending of Pink Floyds ""Comfortably Numb"" classic of the same era.

Director Michael Mann, famous for his ""Miami Vice"" TV series, as well as ""Manhunter"" and the famed Al Pacino/Robert DeNiro classic ""Heat"", shows his great potential in this early noir masterpiece. Every element in this film is perfection. Dialogue, cast, atmosphere, and the aforementioned fabulous soundtrack that enhances every scene beautifully.  ""Thief"", has it all. The cameos from Willie Nelson and Dennis Farina in his debut on the big screen, replete with BLACK hair, as one of Leos henchmen, are also fun surprises along the way.

The scene with Tuesday Weld mentioned by the Amazon reviewer is as masterful a piece of American film acting as I have ever seen.

150991,4,0792838947,"First, the DVD is not top-notch.  Some ghosting in the picture etc.  Hope for a better edition some day.  What IS topnotch on the DVD is the Commentary by Michael Mann and James Caan.  We learn that they immersed themselves in the world of ""master"" jewel thieves and cops and that many of the capers shown were based on real jobs these guys did.  All of the background they discuss lets you know why Thief looks and feels so authentic.  AND it's very funny as well.
Michael Mann's first film is stylish, slick, and as noted above, gritty and authentic.  Caan is terrific and is ably supported by Tuesday Weld, Jim Belushi, and Robert Prosky, and a terrific cameo by Willy Nelson.
A master thief, raised and ""educated"" in state institutions and prisons, Caan is a man who has ""run out of time"".  He learned to survive in prison by not caring about himself or anyone (which we learn in a great scene with Tuesday Weld), he was taught by a master thief (Nelson) and he has a dream he created that he is trying to fulfill. His dream is the adolescent dream of the family and house with a white picket fence, imagined in prison, and now trying to be made real in the world.
Caan is a lone wolf, working his own jobs with his own crew.  In order to speed up the completion of his dream he decides to throw in with Prosky's mob, and take on jobs for pay.  This leads to a crisis and Caan must make a fateful decision.
Great photography; terse and tough dialogue; terrific pounding soundtrack;  absolutely stunning & complex robberies; stylish direction and excellent acting.  Really good stuff.
This is a great companion piece to Mann's ""Heat"".  I want to think that it is Caan's character that DeNiro refers to in Heat as the old guy in prison that taught him you have to be ready to drop and leave everything in your life if the ""Heat"" is near....anyway, this was the terrific precursor to that great film, and you can see that the themes explored here were later developed and elaborated on in Heat.  Two great films.  This one 4-1/2 stars.",990057600,7,2036,4.450134770889488

Master thief who can ""take a trimmin"" battles back against a mobster and the cops while carrying a picture of Willie Nelson, swearing he'll ""never, ever, take a pinch from a greasy motherf*#@$! like you!"" Commentary is funny, sort of inside story stuff. There is one extra scenes inserted, doesn't add much but it doesn't take too long. Haven't heard it in 5.1, but the stereo reproduction is excellent, especially if you are a fan of the Tangerine Dream soundtrack. You get to learn cool facts about some of the other actors in the movie listening to the commentary, like which ones used to be cops and crooks in real life. Could have had more extra features, like a making of and stuff, but they have to save something for the Extra Special Director's Cut Awards Edition, right? Excellent DVD.",987120000,,988,4.96969696969697
150993,4,0792838947,"Michael Mann's dark and intriguing 1981 crime film ""Thief"",....adapted from the Frank Hohimer novel ""The Home Invaders"" is finally out on DVD and packed with interesting features including insightful commentary by director Michael Mann and star James Caan.
Additionally, there are deleted scenes, theatrical trailer and an 8 page booklet too....excellent additions to accompany the DVD release of this noir cult film. The DVD color transfer is excellent...precisely capturing the neon lit and rain swept night world of crime...and Tangerine Dreams haunting soundtrack is brilliant in Dolby sound. Mann's movie depicts the life of ex-convict turned professional thief, Frank (James Caan) who maintains an honest veneer during the day as a car dealership manager, but his nights are spent with partner Barry (James Belushi) carrying out elaborate jewel robberies. Frank falls in with criminal mastermind, Leo (Robert Prosky in a chilling performance) who is seemingly a guardian angel...but the relationship quickly sours and Franks world crumbles and then ignites in violence and death.
Mann's highly effective use of light and color give an eerie ambience to this film...and the first rate support cast including Tuesday Weld and Willie Nelson as the ailing master safe cracker, Okla....give ""Thief"" a polished finish. Director Michael Mann continued his motif of criminal thrillers in later years with TV shows like Miami Vice & Crime Story...and films like Manhunter & Heat.
A very worthy addition to your DVD collection...fans of intense, intelligent crime saga's will definitely enjoy !!",976060800,73,1591,5.551440329218107
150994,5,0792838947,"'Thief' remains the apex of American crime films.  This film features what is arguably the truest and grittiest depiction of a criminal mind in film history.  The screenplay is impeccably written, with a fine ear for  realistic street dialogue.  The acting is absolutely superb all around.  The actual burglary sequences, so precise and meticulous, are flawless in  conception and execution.
A masterpiece!",963273600,2,406,5.467741935483871
150995,4,0792838947,"Michael Mann's adaptation of Frank Hohimer's book ""The Home Invaders"" makes as sparkling but doom-laden a tale of suspense and human drama as it did on its release almost 20 years ago. James Caan gives  a powerful performance as an ex-con safe-cracker, prepared to sacrifice  everything and anyone else in order to live up to his unrealistic (and  rather nave and simplistic) belief in his own personal freedom to control  his life. It also features James Belushi in his first major film role.
This movie is not so much concerned with action (though it has plenty)  as with the ideology (albeit a rather warped one) of the  individual-something that is rather out of fashion these days.  Most of the  drama in this film is carried in the dialogue, which Mann allows sufficient  time to play out fully, making it a slower-paced but more intimate film  than one likely to be made nowadays. Mann's use of real ex- (and  not-so-ex-!) safe-crackers as `technical consultants' during the making of  the film-as well as most scenes being filmed using real gear, not studio  mock-ups-also imbue the film with a gritty realism that is also rare these  days. (The camera tricks employed during the final shoot-out scene are a  bit silly, though.)
Mann's choice of Tangerine Dream to supply the music  for the film was another masterstroke, adding to the raw, ice-edged feel of  the film. Naturally, Mann knows precisely when to use the music to its full  and when to hold off, making it all the more effective. Long periods with  neither dialogue nor music all add to the feeling of realism-and the  suspense.
This DVD production is a slightly different cut from that  released in cinemas (although not significantly) and also includes an  interesting commentary audio track by Mann and Caan. Unfortunately, it  suffers somewhat from poor image quality-no anamorphic enhancement-for  which it loses a star. Otherwise, this comes highly recommended for lovers  of grittier fare.",959040000,3,1967,4.996913580246914
150996,5,0792838947,"I had to write this review after reading so many rave reviews of ""Heat"", which is overrated compared to ""Thief"".  It makes me wonder how many of those customer reviewers are adolescents or  young adults who have not seen this picture.
This motion picture is  somewhat similar in plot to ""Heat"", but with considerably less  violence (until about the final 30 minutes).  James Caan is at his best as  an ex-con trying to play his cards close to the vest when he makes a deal  with a mob leader that ends disastrously.  I find myself agreeing with the  customer reviewer who wrote that this was Caan's best acting performance  ever.  The intensity and feel of ""Thief"" make it a far superior  movie to ""Heat"", with excellent supporting performances from  Willie Nelson, Tuesday Weld, and Jim Belushi.
Especially noteworthy is  the performance of Robert Prosky as Leo, the mobster who thinks he's got  Caan's character under his thumb only to get his comeuppance.  Look for  Rick Rossovich and Dennis Farina as Leo's hired muscle.
In addition to  a great plot and great performances (hallmarks of almost every film Mann's  ever done) is a soundtrack by Tangerine Dream that really rocks!  Rent or  buy this movie, and if you like it, start your quest for the soundtrack  album immediately!  You'll be glad you did.
Don't get me wrong here,  ""Heat"" was a good movie.  ""Thief"", however, was done  first and done better",946857600,16,1411,4.775

7792342,3,0792838947,"James Caan is perfect as an ex con who cant quite escape his past.  And isn't quite trying to.  He has a used car lot.  But is really a jewel thief.  He is recruited to do a job, And then the man he works for gets him pretty much everything he needs to start a normal domestic life.  Including a woman and a baby.  But then double crosses him.  About the last twenty minutes when Caan goes after him are intense and the whole movie is good and intense and suspensful,  Caan plays the kind of person that is hard to really want to succeed.  But he plays him very well.",1521849600,,567,4.036036036036036

Classic Michael Mann cinematography and music. It's all there. Dark and deep. James Caan is excellent in this, likely his best character.

The supporting cast was great. The scene locations, dialogue and all that makes a movie entertaining is all there. But this movie is not quit perfect.",1517184000,2,383,4.701492537313433
