8473987,1,B002QB7ETQ,"Super lame movie, bad acting, horrible script as expected. Most of the ""beautiful 1950's San Francisco"" shots are of the inside of a house. Scenery consists of a very short sequence in what appears to be a city park with some trees. The Sheriff's deputies pull up in a '65 Ford patrol car, kind of improbable if this film was made in 1957 as claimed. A true waste of money and time.",1284163200,,382,4.319444444444445
