8652288,5,B00JLYXGKC,"This is an incredible film. While you might think it's about fishing, it's about so much more than that. It, though a bit of brief storytelling and incredible film of the ocean, talks about our relationship with the ocean in a realistic but a slightly positive way. Watch it if you love the ocean and/or fishing...or you just want to know what's wrong with those of us who do. Oh...and it's short...so you can watch it anytime!",1404691200,,427,4.558441558441558
8652289,5,B00JLYXGKC,"I feel this film captures the struggles of landing one of the most elusive creatures in the sea! The archived footage and photos add an element of nostalgia and directly tie in with the modern day sport fishing community. Such an engaging film and wonderfully photographed!

RECOMMEND!",1398211200,,285,5.0638297872340425
