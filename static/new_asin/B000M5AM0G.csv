8325393,1,B000M5AM0G,"I was extremely disappointed when this dvd arrived and I saw that it was a copy.
I was further disappointed when it wouldn't play in any of my dvd players.

When it wouldn't even play on my computers dvd player I opened up the disk through 'My Computer' and saw that whoever made the copy didn't even bother putting the video files together in order to allow it to be played.
I clicked a few of the individual files to get an idea of what the video is like, and if it would be worth the effort to combine the files myself with DVD Decrypter, or something similar, but it really didn't look interesting enough for the effort.

I really can't believe Amazon is allowing this to be sold through them.",1186790400,7,697,4.312977099236641
