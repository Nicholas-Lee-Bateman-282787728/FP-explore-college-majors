746537,4,6303983278,"First off let me say that I didn't buy this from Amazon.com... I purchased it off of a discount rack at a retail store. Lo and behold, when I get home and look it up I had paid 20% more than I would have if I had ordered it here... That'll teach me.
Anyhow, as for the DVD set, it's great for fans of Red Skelton, and contains just about all of his classic characters (except for the Mean Widdle Kid). The episodes are chock full of guest stars (Walt Disney, Bing Crosby, and Judy Garland pop up in one episode alone!), and the commercials and sponsor's ad segments have been all but deleted from the show (to some a disappointment, but to me it makes the shows flow better)
My main complaint is regarding the picture quality of the episodes. I realize that some of these episodes date back to the early fifties, but more than half of the episodes on the second disc are so dark you can't see what's going on at all! The Christmas episode was the worst, forcing me to turn up the brightness just to watch it.
But, I suppose I can't complain. You get a dozen twenty-minute or so episodes of great comedy, complete with the live-TV screw-ups and adlibs (my favorite being the episode guest starring Vincent Price and Jackie Coogan called 'Painting', where they take turns upstaging Red, much to his chagrin)
I would highly recommend this DVD set, despite its drawbacks.",1048636800,24,1367,4.450199203187251
746538,5,6303983278,"Lucille Ball may have paved the way and set the standard for sitcom television, but Red Skelton set the standard for sketch comedy. It must have been great working on television in those early days when things were live and not taped. Red Skelton was one of America's great comedians and the greatest American pantomimist. He came from an era of entertainment so different from our current pop culture. It's so refreshing to watch these shows and see how much better sketch comedy used to be (the current Saturday Night Live crew could learn a lot from watching Red). Red always kept the audience laughing and he didn't mind breaking the fourth wall to talk to the audience or break out of character to get the extra laugh. He was a treasure and this DVD is one great way to preserve his memory and our cultural heritage.",1018137600,12,821,4.591836734693878

746735,5,6303983278,"The name Red Skelton is fading away in the 21st Century, but way back in the 20th, he was a beloved and well-known comedian. In our family home when my brother and I were little, Red visited us by TV nearly every week. Our Grandma Katie just adored Red, although she seldom laughed at his actual comedy. She loved his shy little four-fingered wave to the audience as he came on to the stage, the dimples in his smile, and his show-closing phrase: Good night and may God bless! This is the Red Skelton that is best remembered today, the old peoples Skelton.
  The Skelton in this 11 disc DVD set released by The Shout Factory, is not for the most part, the old folks Skelton. The earliest TV shows Red did are visual extensions of his radio program. Reds radio programs from the 1940 to 1944 and the 1945 to 1954 seasons were his true legacy. Like Joe Penner before him, Red had the capacity to be both inside and outside of his material at the same time. His most endearing character from his radio days was the Mean Widdle Kid. Junior was wise beyond his years, one of the craftiest rascals on radio. He played off Harriet Hilliard as his mother on the early shows, but the funniest Junior scripts featured Verna Felton as his Namma. She often spoke to Junior with that Hairbrush tone in her voice. There were no time outs in Juniors lexicon, just extreme corporal punishment. Junior made I dood it and He don't know me very well, do he, beloved catch phrases, but Reds outstanding achievement with the character was making such a brat seem somehow endearing. Juniors influence on cartoons of the 1940s and 1950s was in every Wise Guy hero, from Bugs Bunny to Tweety, Woody Woodpecker, Skrewy Squirrel: every character that broke the 4th wall and had no respect for authority owed their existence to Red Skeltons radio program and his head writer and first wife, Edna Stillwell. Skeltons other radio characters, such as Clem Kadiddlehopper were imitated by Tex Avery (The Hick Chick) and by Bill Scott as Bullwinkle Moose, Deadeyes Aw, Come On Horse, WHOA! became components of Yosemite Sam and Quick Draw McGrawMike Maltese, who wrote for these characters, was imbued with Reds comic bad guys.
  The first Skelton TV shows tried to do a visual version of the radio program. Ironically, although Red looked hilarious as Clem Kadiddlehopper with his crossed eyes and receding chin, and Cauliflower McPugg with his broken down prizefighters facial ticks and catch phrases such as a flock of em flew over that time, or Deadeyes crummy mustache and even crummier marksmanshipall these characters were just as vivid on the radio without the makeup. The listener could easily imagine what they looked like and the attempts by the makeup men to make them visible comes off a little cheesy. Its significant that Red made almost no attempt to recreate Junior visually for TV. He used the Junior voice and turned his fedora upside down to simulate being a Fauntleroy type kid, but turned the character into a parody of his own son, Richard. Red was a big guy over six feet, and he wisely decided against performing as Junior alongside Verna Felton or Lurene Tuttle. Junior on the radio was a tiny, scampering, atomic powered bundle of mischief, so Reds stature was all wrong for the character.
  Having said all that, these TV shows have their own rewarding qualities. Edna Skelton was still the head writer (even though she and Red were divorced) and the characters that she and Red created could coast on their energy. Red loved to make fun and criticize the writing as he performed it, (now theres a brilliant line, Im proud othat, it aint written here). He would often break up on camera as he went along, and sometimes threw off the timing of his supporting cast in doing so. An early member of that cast, Lucille Knoch, is a standout in these 1950s kinescopes. Shes petite, blonde and very cute, Jeff to Reds Mutt, and really seems to be enjoying Reds comedy, mistakes and all. Its a delight to watch her break up along with Red. Jack Benny was very critical of Reds unprofessionalism, laughing at himself. Yet somehow breaking up became an integral part of his routine and bridged less-than-perfect comedy writing. Red would comment: I gotta laugh, cause I know whats comin and I only just got the joke.
  Whats the value of this SHOUT FACTORY DVD set to a collector of television shows of the 1950s? Invaluable. Red Skelton held the rights to all his television kinescopes, and how fortunate we are that he did hold them and didn't syndicate the programs. Part of the reason Red didn't want his early programs seen during his lifetime might have been that his son Richard, who was the subject of many of his fathers comedy routines, died of leukemia before he turned 10, and his second wife Georgia, mother of Reds two children and featured in several of the Christmas Skelton shows, shot herself to death in 1976. Red was probably too saddened by the loss of Georgia and Richard to look at his old shows. He continued to make new ones until 1971; he preferred to go on and not to look back.
  The first season, 1951-52 , has the most manic energyRed had to change costumes several times in each episode, and there is no God bless endings hereRed is usually dragged under the curtain at the end of the show in mid-sentence by a stage hand! Cauliflower McPugg, Clem Kadiddlehopper and Willie Lump-Lump are the featured characters. The show was as big a hit as Reds radio program and he won two Emmys for his TV program and for being an outstanding comedian. Unfortunately, the first episode from 9/30/1951 is not included in the set, perhaps the print went vinegarits a miracle that so many of these episodes have survived at all, Red must have had good film storage. In the 1952-53 series, they tried to make it easier on Red by filming the performances on a sound stage with mostly canned laughter. The show really suffered without a live audience and Reds comedy was enhanced by real laughterso the filmed shows lasted only one season. Being shot on 35mm, they look great.
  NBC dropped the Red Skelton show in 1953, due to low ratings, and CBS picked it up, running it on a sustaining basis at first. More shows were one-character per episode affairs and there were many singing/dancing interludes by the Red-dettes to give Red some breathing room. Its a real treat to see these CBS kinescopes. The network had a terrible track record on film storage and most of their early kinescopes were destroyed. We owe Red our gratitude in preserving so much of his television legacy for us to see today.
  About this time in the shows history, a new character began to dominate the programs, a hobo named Freddy the Freeloader. Skelton used his fathers clown makeup for Freddys face. In the early appearances Freddy spoke quite a lot, but in the later 1950s and 60s he became largely a pantomime character. He was a gentle soul, but was rather coarse in his manners, I remember an episode that featured Greer Garson, whom Freddy addressed as a broad. Reds skill at acting and comedy without using words make him worthy of study by animators and actors today. He had absolute control over his face and body and could become an old man, a little boy, a drunkard, a haughty dowager or two seagulls just by changing his posture or wearing his hat differently.
  There are many Skelton legends that aren't included in the biography documentary on the bonus disc. Tales such as Red in his dotage responding to unexpected visitors ringing the bell at his Bel-Aire home by running out on to the driveway clad only in a bathrobe and brandishing a rifle! Red supposedly wouldnt let anyone near the vault rooms in his mansion where all the film was stored, reportedly he refused to show the old kinescopes to people, including himself. Red was a right-wing God and Country type guy in his later years and accused CBS of persecuting him for his politics when they cancelled his show in 1970, still at the top of the ratings.
  Shout Factory has cut nearly all the commercials out of Reds prints but have left the filmed spots he did for Tide Detergent in the first season shows. The ads are funny and painless, nearly devoid of plugs until the last minute of the skit. You won't find any of the Pet Milk or Johnsons Wax ads in the later shows, however. Maybe they couldn't clear the rights.
  I give this set the highest rating a film collector can give it4 Reels! There are so many interesting episodes including guests like Bela Lugosi, Peter Lorre and Vampira and a filmed rehearsal for a 1953 NBC episode featuring Deadeye From Mars which lets us in on Reds freewheeling and irreverent attitude towards his comedy. He cracked up when the elaborate space bicycle prop fails to take off at the end of the sketch. Its always fun to watch Red just take flubs and fluffs in his stride and make them funnier than whats written here.
  By all means get this set and savor it slowly, there are 92 shows included and youll be sorry when youve used up all the episodes!",1433030400,7,9044,4.632334581772784

If you were not raised from that era, you learn a lot of things about history that schools no longer teach children. Another plus to this show is that he invludes many of his poems and includes the Lord in his shows.

746840,5,6303983278,"This set is very welcome, not just for its entertainment value but as comedy archaeology.  The ups and downs of the Skelton show make for a story quite unlike anything else in the history of the medium.

Speaking of ups and downs, the viewer should be prepared for great variation in quality over the years represented here.  The Skelton show was an immense hit its first year, garnering rave reviews, two Emmys and a fourth place finish in the ratings.  Unfortunately, the work took its toll and an exhausted Skelton decided to switch to film in the second year after doing the first year live (or almost live-- the series appears to have used one filmed insert every week, presumably to facilitate set and costume changes).  Red was quoted as saying that his sponsor ""can either have a live comedian on a filmed show or a dead comedian on a live show.""

Suddenly, the show had a canned, airless feel to it-- besides which the ""mistakes"", ad-libs and breakups that were a big part of Skelton's stock in trade looked much more contrived in this pre-recorded context.  Then, too, some scenes were greeted with what sounds like genuine audience laughter while others are clearly heavily ""sweetened""....  Critics reacted with negative comments and viewers reacted by demoting the show to twenty-eighth place.  (The loss of Jack Douglas as a writer probably didn't help either.)

Sponsor and network dropped the show but thankfully CBS picked it up and stuck with it through a few very difficult years.  There was a return to live telecasts but nothing was fixed overnight--  reportedly, the program once sank to as low as number eighty-six in the ratings, remarkable for a show that later ranked as high as number two.  One turning point (1955) was the arrival of a new writing staff, headed by Sherwood Schwartz, who stayed with the show for eight years.  I dearly hope that a future release will bring us more of those episodes....

The accompanying documentary is quite interesting, and incorporates a great deal of fascinating home movie footage.  Its accuracy, however, is at times questionable:  E.g., it now seems very unlikely that Skelton's father was a circus clown (at least for any length of time), and the childhood story he tells about Ed Wynn is doubtful (not to mention the fact that Red told the same story at least once with Raymond Hitchcock as the hero!).

For more on the mysteries of Red's origins, the interested reader should consult RED SKELTON:  THE MASK BEHIND THE MASK, by Prof. Wes D. Gehring.  (Other worthwhile volumes are the same author's SEEING RED, and Wesley Hyatt's fascinating A CRITICAL HISTORY OF TELEVISION'S THE RED SKELTON SHOW, 1951-1971.  You may also wish to go on over to bookfinder and look up LOOTVILLE, a 1957 novel by Nancy and Benedict Freedman; B. Freedman was a writer for the Skelton show in its first two years and the book is a fictionalization of his experiences.)",1417392000,17,2919,4.821285140562249

Many of the shows on these collections were never released before. The main thing going for the Early Years is the number of shows per disc and they're in slim disc boxes so it takes up less space on the shelf. I haven't watched it yet but the bonus disc contains a documentary about Red Skelton and a taping of a rehearsal of a show and the actual show.

Red Skelton was an American institution. After 10 successful years on radio Red came to television where he was able to be a visual comic as well ... and he flourished. The humor was often silly and broad but lurking behind a Skelton performance was always the ability to be touching and profound as well. He was a performer that was devoted to his audience ... he felt his abilities were meant to be shared and he always gave 100%. His comic genius and warmth made him a favorite on TV for 20 years. We don't seem to grow entertainers of his caliber or longevity anymore and he should not be forgotten. This set should do a lot to keep his laughter and art alive.

746913,5,6303983278,I never missed The Red Skelton Show when I was growing up. He took physical comedy to the limit. Timeless.,1369785600,,106,4.35
746914,3,6303983278,"When I was a kid (in the late 40s) I used to just love Red Skelton movies. The ones I mean were ""shorts"" that came along with the showing of the regular theater movie. They were SO funny! He was by far my favorite comedian. I used to laugh until I cried. I know he had a later TV program, but we didn't have a TV and later, when we did, we couldn't get the right channel. In any case, I loved the old Red Skelton skits and I hope kids these days have such comic heroes. One day when I was browsing through the bargain bins in a video store, I found and bought ""Three Classic Episodes: The Red Skelton Show"" DVD. I have no idea how long I've had this DVD, perhaps on the order of five or six years. I re-found it in my DVD storage area while cleaning and viewed it last night for the first time.

The three TV episodes consist of ""Freddie and the Spies,"" ""Cauliflower Gone Hollywood"" and ""The UN Show."" The DVD is crudely put together with intermixed black and white plus some color in between the skits. The sound quality is so-so and the picture quality is not particularly good. But, remember, these are old pre-color TV shows and high quality should not be expected. I did not particularly care for the skits. They were mildly amusing, but that's about it. A good single word review might be ""corny."" I doubt if I could bear to watch many more. Alas, nostalgia isn't what it used to be. These skits, and probably most of the others were great fun at the time, but just simply wouldn't go over with today's audiences. However, items like this are a ""blast from the past"" and may be of great interest and value to nostalgia collectors. I always think of my wife who just has to have everything that Shirley Temple ever turned out. Well, I feel apologetic to nostalgia buffs, especially since I really did love Red Skelton as a comedian, but I could not rate this DVD any higher than three stars.

746916,2,6303983278,I love Red Skelton and was hoping to see some of the shows I had memories of but the shows on this set are OK but not what I expected.  I probably should look for a collection of skits instead of entire shows.,1247356800,,209,3.86046511627907
746917,4,6303983278,"To be straightforward, I was going to rate this DVD a 3 until I heard Red Skelton's concluding remarks before his audience at the United Nations. That caused me to realize his heart was in the right place. In essence he said if he'd offended anyone it wasn't his intent, that he thought that everyone was put here for a purpose and his was to make people laugh.

The first two of these episodes are from his regular CBS television show, with the third being a special UN appearance. In ""Freddie and the Spies"" Red is the target of a manipulation plot by an attractive blonde spy. He is the hero and I won't spoil the ending by giving you the details.

In the second episode, Vincent Price is a ""Hollywood"" type antagonist who confronts Cauliflower, played by Red. The plot unfolds in a boxing ring. Again, I'll refrain from giving details.

The UN show is largely pantomine routines. There's a French narration to accompany the English version. My reason for originally thinking it only deserved a 3 rating was that some of the skits didn't seem to be as funny as I thought they'd be. Perhaps it was me. Maybe I wasn't in the right frame of mind and need to loosen up.",1112227200,,1168,4.4485981308411215
