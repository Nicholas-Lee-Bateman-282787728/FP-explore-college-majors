4079215,5,B0036TGTEI,I Love this season waited forever to see it and was kinda depressed when i heard it was the final season. Kudos to Mcgruder for making this season better thanthe last season. My only complaint is where is the blu-ray version i noticed off of Itunes they had the HD version of the tv show just wondering if they will pkg. this season to blu-ray...,1289347200,3,346,4.338461538461538
4079216,5,B0036TGTEI,The Boondocks is really funny for anyone open minded enough to be able to take a joke. It keeps up pretty well with pop culture and is all around a great comedy cartoon. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!,1289260800,3,189,4.428571428571429

4079219,5,B0036TGTEI,"I have been watching Boondocks from the beginning, and it is BEYOND funny.  Start with Season 1, and work your way up.  I own Seasons 1&2 on DVD and plan to buy Season 3, the moment it hits the stores.  It is ADULT humor, so wait until the kids go to bed.  I am in my 30s and so is my husband, and we are hooked.

4079220,5,B0036TGTEI,Trust me this is not a cartoon for kids! I'm 27 and my husband is 36 and we can't get enough of the boondocks...we don't miss an espisode. We have the first season on dvd and I'm sure we'll be getting the second and third season also. We've already started watching the third season on tv and let me tell you it's not disappointing.

4079309,5,B0036TGTEI,The Boondocks season 3 is a must own for any fan.  I watch every episodes and the laughter never ends.  One the best things about own the season 3 book set are the uncensored stuff that are shown.  Watching it on TV a certain channel blocks out and bleeps out a lot of the contain.  It is nice to see the creators true vision of each episodes.  To bad the creator of the show was not a part of Boondocks last season 4(this season is a complete waste of time).  If you want a show that makes fun of modern culture and will make you laugh than The Boondocks Season 3 is a great buy!!!!!!!,1423440000,,586,4.052173913043478

Even though he has kids (Huey & Riley) characters cursing quite often throughout each episode, he (Aaron McGruder) still manages to capture a true meaning in each episode.  You just have to look & listen past the jokes and punchlines....  I applaud his work, and I'll be a huge fan forever.

Oh yeah, I can't forget about Uncle Ruckus, Tom, and Granddad. Altogether, these dvd sets are awesome & funny as hell!!!! And they always imitate what's happening (or what has happened) in our day-to-day lives here in America....",1405900800,3,591,4.88

4079357,5,B0036TGTEI,"Gloriously Politically Incorrect and loving it.

Boondocks addresses social issues within society specific to United States culture.  The show is political, racially charged, and designed to hit you the same way Anne Coulter does:  A hit to the back of the head to get your attention, and then delivery of the message in a thought provoking way.

The show can be watched as outright comedic entertainment, or can be studied and understood as a statement of the author's beliefs of the pitfalls of society as voiced by Grandad and company.",1405382400,,538,4.944444444444445

4079359,5,B0036TGTEI,"Aaron McGruder, why do you make us wait for the craziness from the characters in the Boondocks universe? This season shows us how Uncle Ruckus became who he is. Though funny, the Boondocks is brutally honest in showing the world how things are and silly racial idiosyncrasies, mostly on the African American side, but other races get a light shined on them as well. I definitely recommend if you have loved the previous seasons. If you are new then be aware that you will be hearing a healthy dose of the ""N"" word.",1402790400,,514,4.537634408602151

Basically, Obama de-friends Hughey on Facebook because he is considered a domestic terrorist.  So while everyone is so happy about Obama, Hughey is melencholy about it.

People saying that season 3 is in decline are either A) Hipsters or B) Stupid, the animation has noticeably increased and some of the episodes are their best yet. The Red Ball for example shows how the boondocks mix humor with kung fu homages, or Tyler Perry getting ripped a new one on Pause, or the Fried Chicken Flu which just has me cracking up every time, the Boondocks are in their prime!

However it seems in each season Aaron McGruder puts in a few BET episodes, which just aren't funny to me, maybe people who are more involved with the tv business ""get it"", but I think he's made his point pretty clear about BET and needs to move on. Rylo Goodlove (I think?) is also a pretty boring character, but besides the afromentioned points the Boondocks is a level of quality rarely seen in animated adult television and is a shining beacon among the murky sea of adult swim's shows.",1334188800,2,1170,4.566666666666666

Now, as far as some others that have said this season was not as funny as the previous two...  I thought this one was just as good.  I look at it like this...

The first season was so hilarious AND it was a complete shock because it was unlike anything else currently available. The second season was just as good as the first, BUT not as shocking because we had experienced the first season.

This one (the third season) is still really very good, but the shock value has worn off.

So, I love it! If you LOVE The Boondocks, too, then I say get all three seasons (like I did).

If you just like this show, check out Adult Swim.  You'll catch an episode every now and again...

So, to make it a cartoon series only seems fair, which is good considering the amount of geo-political racial profiling that goes on, but no worse than any other series like Family Guy for example, which obviously is stereotypical of every race not just the original racial riff that started it all. Still, some good wholesome middle-class ghetto-fabulous fun. Definitely a five star series, but then again, we really don't have much to compare it to now do we (Cleveland Show? Come on people, that is just downright rude)?",1293321600,5,653,4.778761061946903

I've been a fan since the comic strip and wishful thinking that season 3 isn't he end. One thing I can say about the series is that it shows people that thy don't have to lean towards the status quo and its okay to have a mind of your own on popular issues in the world. If you have a sense of humor I strongly advise buying all 3 seasons.,1292630400,2,502,3.883495145631068

This happened every week as I was desperate to find something worthwhile in this season. The only bearable episode for me was when they stuck it to Tyler Perry, calling him out on all his BS, and somewhat questionable casting techniques. But other than that, I honestly did not have one other laugh during this season. There wasn't enough of Huey for me, a 3rd final chapter for Gangstalicious would've been nice, and it just seemed like they wrote these episodes in a hurry to just get the season over with. I'm still a fan of the show, I still enjoy the first two seasons that I have on dvd, but this one i'll definitely pass on.",1292544000,13,1031,4.670329670329671

Every culture has its unflattering sterotypes and the Boondocks never misses an opportunity to point them out and encourage you to laugh aloud - at YOURSELF and/or at someone else.

Kudos to EVERYONE (the creator, artists, actors, musicians, and behind the scenes folks) associated with making this possible.

Truly embracing reality - flaws and all - is the first step to dealing with it and learning from it!

4079607,5,B0036TGTEI,"As a fan from the comic strip to the show I couldn't help but notice that as it moved on it got better in all areas.

While it took some time for this new season one look at it and you can clearly see why, this is easily one if not THE best looking animated show on tv( go back and look at a episode from a previous season or any prime time animated show ). Both the episodes ""The Red Ball"" "" The Fund Raiser"" and ""It's Going Down"" drive this fact home, even in episodes with little to no action like ""Story Of Jimmy Rebel""( parody of actual racist singer Johnny Rebel ) looks amazing in both high definition and stanrd tv formats.

The writing for this season also went up as well as besides the already mentioned parody of Jimmy Rebel the episode called ""Smokin' With Cigarettes"" is also based on a actual child who did steal his grandma's car and sadly beat her in a fast food restaurant( also was made even better with all the refs to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Halloween-Blu-ray/dp/B000UR9QHQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Halloween [Blu-ray</a>] ). I do think my fav episodes this season from a writer's view point has to be ""Lovely Ebony Brown"" and ""Color Ruckus""( made better thanks to the talents of Don ""DC"" Curry ).

For the dvd itself it has a handfull of extras, both Cedric( Tom ) and Gary( Uncle Ruckus ) introduce and exit every episode and the banter they showed in the features for season 2 was nothing to the hilarity they pulled off here. Instead of Arron McGrudder on comentary for a select episodes it's been handed over to Cedric, Gary and John Witherspoon( Grandad ), while not as into the production side that Aron and co got into it's still great to hear their two cents on what they thought. Another bonus was getting Sueng Kim's sketches from the show as he started out from season 1 as a storyboarder to a full on producer for this season.

4079610,1,B0036TGTEI,"Hi, today I'm reviewing my favorite show ever, The Boondocks. It reminds me of how Dave Chappelle said the N-word a lot, but this show's characters articulate it weirdly (""nyooogaah"") so they can say it even more, so you know it's not afraid to ""go there!"" Also, it looks like a anime!

The family is really mismatched ha ha. One little kid thinks he's a gangsta, but he's actually not yet, because he's just a little kid. His wacky grandfather beats him sometimes. The little afro kid is intellectual. Like his brother he promotes violence, but he promotes ""black revolutionary violence"" not rap gangsta violence which makes him intellectual and stuff. He insults white people which is kewl because white people have ""white privolege,"" which makes them racist and bad. Racism is bad. He also quotes Kahlil Gibran sometimes, who was a smart brown person from Egypt. What a mismatched family...!

There's also a fat guy with a lazy eye called Uncle Ruckus who's an uncle tom. That means he has opinions that make him a bad, uncertified black person. He doesn't know that he's being kept down by the white system and hegememony. As we all know, it is impossible for a white person to be poor and a black person to be rich.

This show has lots of elements of ""magic realisticism."" Like one time, prof. Martin Luther King comes back from the dead and nobody questions it! He sees things he doesn't like about the black community that Uncle Ruckus agrees with in other episodes. Also that painter who paints ""happy trees"" on TV (Ross Perot) has a gun and gets in a police chase, which is random and wacky so it's instantly funny!",1289347200,,1624,4.651567944250871

8390200,5,B0036TGTEI,"Maybe just half a notch below the brilliance of season 2. Still full of laughs, though. Some of the series best individual episodes are in this season, too. ""Pause"", ""It's a Black President Huey Freeman"", and ""The Hateocracy"" are (in my opinion) the best episodes of season 3. The only episode I genuinely disliked in season 3 was ""The Red Ball"" (it was just kind of boring and unfunny).",1508025600,,387,4.6231884057971016
