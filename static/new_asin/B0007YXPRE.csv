2253008,5,B0007YXPRE,"This is a delightful program - entertaining and educational without feeling it is.  The 3 main characters are a hoot - my husband will actually go out of his way to watch this one (the same guy who runs from Blues clues and all the others!).  Kids learn a little science in each episode, as do the birds in the show, so your kids are learning along with them.  Tons of fun - my 18 month old adores these as does my 6 year old!",1127779200,6,426,3.988235294117647
2253009,5,B0007YXPRE,"If you don't know Peep from Discovery Kids/TLC, you and your kids are missing some really entertaining and educational TV.  Each episode conveys some sort of ""science"" lesson (i.e. how water flows, measuring half-way between two objects).  Joan Cusack is the perfect narrator -- and the antics and personalities of the three main characters (Peep, Chirp and Quack) make even my husband and me laugh outrageously!  Buy this DVD set and make your kid's TV watching time more valuable!",1121904000,4,482,5.075949367088608

2253043,4,B0007YXPRE,"Enjoyable show for kids and parents. But please note that sometimes the ""science"" aspect is erroneous. Chirp is supposed to be a young female robin, but looks like a male cardinal and when they show adult robins, they look like bluebirds. The things they show the birds eating aren't exactly accurate either, so in the lurmies episode when the lurmies appear, both peep and Chirp in the real world would have known what they were and gobbled them up... so you might have to do some explaining to your child, but all in all a fun show!",1440806400,,534,4.515463917525773

2253120,5,B0007YXPRE,"As the daddy of 3 and 5-year-olds, I can safely say this is my favorite kids' show. The lessons are there, but the kids don't really notice that they're learning about real life. What they (and you) do notice is a sort of idyllic existence in a simple world where everything is new, and you're encouraged to stop and smell the flowers. It reminds me of certain children's books that I read as a kid, where the pictures and my imagination combined to create places that I still cherish 40 years later. At the same time, it doesn't insult kids' intelligence like so many shows do. Grown-ups can relate as well - who hasn't worked with a narcissistic ""Quack""? He will rapidly become your favorite character. This is the one show I will stop and watch with them.

Oh and Joan Cusack's narration could not be more perfect.",1377302400,,817,4.52027027027027

2253164,5,B0007YXPRE,"The following review has been dictated to me by my eight-year-old son, Daniel, who is a big fan of ""Peep and the Big Wide World.""

This is a great, wonderful, fantastic amazing series about Peep the Chick and his friends Chirp and Quack, who often get in arguments but always figure out solutions. In every episode, they go on adventures teaching science. If you are new to the series, this would be a perfect place to start. Join Peep, Quack, and Chirp on six exciting adventures with the themes of homes, fall, nighttime, and winter.

In the first episode, ""Peep's Can,"" after cleaning up from a very windy night, Peep tells Chirp the legend of how he came to live in a can.

In the second episode, ""All Fall Down,"" Squeak the Mouse thinks that if leaves fall, the sun, the moon, the stars and the sky will too.

In the third episode, ""Peep's Night Out,"" Peep follows Squeak into the strange world of nighttime.

In the fourth episode, ""The Perils of Peep and Chirp,"" Peep and Chirp learn how one little fish can ruin a perfect trip to the wondrous and amazing world of Green Island....

In the fifth episode, ""Quack's Tracks,"" on the first day of winter, Peep tries to follow Quack to Snow Hill to build a handsome snow duck, but loses Quack, meets Chirp and Tom the Cat, and learns about footprints.

In the last episode, ""Peep's Lost Leaf,"" Peep, Quack, and Chirp chase a great treasure of a leaf on a windy day.

My personal favorite episodes are ""Peep's Night Out"" and ""The Perils of Peep and Chirp.""",1334448000,,1507,4.4945054945054945
2253165,3,B0007YXPRE,"Is there a ""Peep and the Big Wide World"" Anonymous 12-step group? Because I think I'm addicted. My daughters (ages three and five) discovered Peep and his friends at the library last fall and since then I've been as excited as they are to watch it. After I ordered the two newest DVDs, I had a harder time waiting for them than my daughters did.

But with that said, I was disappointed with this one, as I think it fell a little flat. If you're familiar with the series, you know that what makes it work is the chemistry among curious and nave Peep the chick, smart and cynical Chirp the robin and conceited yet somehow lovable Quack the duck. There's usually a good mix of deadpan sarcastic humor and slapstick antics to keep children and adults alike amused and engaged.

But the humor in these episodes is mostly duds. Sure, there are periodic chuckles, but overall the humor isn't well timed. In the title episode (Bringing Spring), for instance, the birds meet a young groundhog searching for her shadow. In fact, she doesn't even know what a shadow is. Helpful as always, the birds teach her and help her find her shadow, only to realize that they've just brought about six more weeks of winter. It seems like it could be so funny, and there are, in fact, any number of openings for humor, but most of them just pass right by. You feel like maybe you should laugh, but you just shrug.

And then there's the two-part episode ""An Inconvenient Tooth"", which doesn't even seem to offer much in the way of hope for humor. Beaver Boy, being a young and impetuous beaver, does what young beavers do: he chews trees. Lots of them. The birds, especially Chirp, who lives in a tree, are rather horrified by the devastation he leaves behind, and try to find a way to get Beaver Boy to stop destroying all the trees. Now, obviously, of course, the whole ""Big Wide World"" series is about teaching science and nature lessons, but these episodes seem a little too blunt with their Message. In most episodes kids absorb the science lesson while enjoying the humorous antics of Peep, Chirp and Quack. In this episode, Peep and Chirp hammer home the Message with only minimal sideline humor from Quack. I don't object to the message of conservation, but the way the message was handled was too serious for a ""Big Wide World"" episode.

And speaking of science lessons, most of the lessons in these episodes are clever and relevant. For instance, we learn what animals eat in Quack's Pond Party, and in Tree Feller we learn the physics involved in chopping down trees and getting them to fall in the right direction. But in the last two episodes it almost feels like they ran out of science lessons, so they switched to counting instead. As the title suggests, in ""You Can Count on Bunnies"", we count bunnies, the trick being that it's hard to count moving things. And in ""Falling Feathers"" we do learn a little bit about molting, but mostly we count Quack's feathers as they fall. (But I will say that this is one of the funnier episodes, as Quack is in true form.)

I'm not sorry to have bought this DVD, as there is still a lot of good material, and the simple animation and soundtrack of these videos really do appeal to young children and teach them valuable lessons on science, nature and friendship. This series is definitely among the best children's educational programming I've ever found. But compared to other episodes in the series, these episodes don't measure up. If you're new to the series, don't start with this one. All of the others are better, but especially the other new one ""Finders Keepers"". 3.5 stars.",1332892800,,3613,4.595348837209302

2253177,4,B0007YXPRE,"I have been a big fan of Peep and the Big Wide World ever since my daughters discovered them at our local library this summer.  The simple graphics and simple soundtracks tell simple stories that are great lessons for young children (ages approximately 2 to 6), but the story lines are also clever enough to keep adults entertained without resorting to inappropriate humor that you hope went over your little one's head.  The three friends, curious Peep, vain but true Quack and exasperated Chirp, along with Joan Cusack as narrator and a cast of other quirky characters make a delightful chemistry not seen since the heyday of ""Friends"".  Through subtle science and social lessons, kids not only learn about the Big Wide World, but how to get along in it.

I'm afraid, however, that I was a little bit disappointed by this video.  It doesn't seem to have quite the same level of subtle quirky humor or the perfectly-timed slapstick humor of the others.  I think it's because many of the episodes attempt to tackle somewhat larger issues than most other Peep videos.  The first two episodes, for instance, are a two-part series in which Chirp finally gest so exasperated with Quack that she challenges him to remain silent until she begs him to talk, which, of course, she vows not to do.  There are certainly humorous elements in these episodes, but they also seem to push the limits of the friendship between Chirp and Quack more than ever before.  The next episode is about Beaver Boy losing a tooth, and it touches on whether he still is a Beaver if he doesn't have both teeth and can't chew trees.  The next is about Quack's wintertime depression.  Perhaps I'm reading too much into the videos.  Perhaps it's just post-Christmas exhaustion and let-down, but my kids (ages 3 and 5) seemed to feel the same way, and they didn't laugh nearly as much as they did through ""Seasons of Adventure"", which we also watched today.

Not to say the video isn't good.  The fifth episode is a humorous account of the day Chirp and Quack, of all people, got all tied up.  ""Bedtime Story"" is also a good account of how Quack, Chirp and Peep came to be and came to be friends.  If you're collecting all the Peep videos, there's no reson to skip this one.  But if you're new to the series and just looking to try one out, this isn't the place to start.",1324857600,4,2338,4.581730769230769
2253178,5,B0007YXPRE,"My daughters discovered Peep and the Big Wide World this past year at library, and I'll admit I've laughed out loud right along with them.  But after checking out each video many times each, I have to say that I started to get a little bored.  And you know you've seen the videos too many times when you start psychoanalyzing Quack, rather than just laughing at him.  So when I saw that there were new Peep videos available, I knew at least part of my Christmas list was crossed off.

This video has eight episodes, unlike the earlier ones which have six.  But like the earlier videos, these episodes all feature the curious little Peep, the self-adoring yet hapless Quack and the exasperated Chirp, along with appearances by their friends such as Beaver Boy, and, of course, the narrator, Joan Cusack.  Also, like previous videos, these episodes mix in child-level science lessons with lessons on friendship and life in general.  And each episode ends with real children playing and doing experiments related to the science lesson in the video.

This particular video features lessons on tides, mud, sliding, spring, and fog, among others.  Although all the episodes feature the typical droll, slapstick humor, by far the funniest episodes are the ones which feature a new duck (who, coincidentally, happens to be named Quack) moving into the neighborhood.  If you think one Quack is just too much, try two.  You and your kids will laugh until your sides hurt.

With great educational and general life lessons, positive values and appealing humor for both kids and adults, I can't recommend Peep and the Big Wide World enough to all parents, and with these new videos, the series just keeps getting better.",1324857600,18,1707,4.868512110726644

2253228,5,B0007YXPRE,"With our first child, my wife and I learned that the most important thing in music or movie purchases for a toddler is that it be Not Annoying.  Because the child will watch it over and over and over and over and over and over again, and so will YOU.  After several thousand viewings of Curious George (Mildly Annoying) and one single viewing of Blues Clues (Positively Horrifying), we stumbled on this gem (we don't have cable - it was a Netflix gamble, like Blue's Clues).  Robert watches it endlessly, and we actually enjoy watching it (!).  Some of the movie lines have become catch phrases in the house (e.g., ""I'm a very big, large, giant duck"" said in a hoarse voice has replaced ""I'm tired"").  It's that, well, catchy.  One of the interesting things about it, which Robert really enjoys, is the sequence at the end of each cartoon where real children ""experiment"" with something related to the cartoon.  It's pretty amusing for us, too, and probably a preview of what's to come (these kids seem to be about 4-7 years old; Robert isn't yet 2).  And special kudos to the kid with the awesome Boston accent that ""watches the dwogs bahk while counting the stahs"".  Reminds me of when I was a kid and we all talked that way.

I am a picky mom when it comes to what I let my 3 yr. old watch because it is so important for me that he LEARNS something from his videos. I also can't stand weird images or strange looking creatures that he can't really understand yet... Anyway, Peep is positively one of the BEST shows I have ever seen for kids (tied with Charlie and Lola) and I have to say that I LOVE it too and never get sick of it. It is hysterical! And so creative. My son is 3 and loves it and laughs and thinks it is so so funny - as does my niece who is 6 and my nephew who is 10 - so it isn't just for young kids.

I haven't watched TLC in the mornings because I thought all they had on was A Baby Story, but I was thrilled to learn about Peep.  My 2 year old daughter LOVES Peep, or ""The Bird Show"" as she calls it.  I like the fact they sneak in some science.  The characters are adorable and funny, and as another reviewer said, there is even some humor in there for the parents.  I love all the peep dvds I have seen.",1153440000,,476,4.2444444444444445
2253235,5,B0007YXPRE,"If you have kids how are practically addicted to Peep and his buddies, then this bundle is for you. We TiVo'd Peep and his pals, but then had to go on vacation where they don't have TLC... so I ordered these and they were great! 3 hours is fine if you're car riding for 8... but I'd pull out a new DVD every few hours and they would be quiet as a mice. The collection comes in a carboard box, and has great packaging. It's nice to go straight to Peep and friends without all of the Paz entertainment inbetween. If your kids are looking to learn more about the world around them from a kid's new-to-life perspective, then these guys are for you. A great lesson in every story, even volume (no up and down of the remote between music and speech) and fun. My kids are 2 and 4.. both enjoy the show with equal enthusiasm.",1151107200,,817,4.177215189873418
2253236,5,B0007YXPRE,"My daughter LOVES the Peep and the Big Wide World shows and it is a great way to learn science. If you have a pre-schooler they will really like the adventures that Peep, Quack and Chirp have and for parents they show has humor and is actually interesting!",1144368000,2,256,4.354166666666667
2253237,5,B0007YXPRE,"Some television shows just sit there.  Others are worth their weight in gold.  As a mom who is pretty picky, I have to say that I really like this show.

As the other reviewers have noted, this series has cute characters and is done very professionally.  However, what really stands out is it's ability to teach children reasoning skills.  Every episode has a problem and Peep, Duck (my personal favorite), Chirp and company demonstrate the various ways that one can look at the problem; and how one might approach the problem to solve it.

Failure?  That just means you need to go back to the drawing board and try again.

FOUR Stars.  Provides teaching moments that most other shows don't.  Sit and watch the show with your child and then see how many times during the week you can apply the approaches learned.  You'll be pleasantly surprised.",1138579200,16,846,4.687074829931973
2253238,5,B0007YXPRE,My girlfriend and I LOVE PEEP! There are a lot of great and funny jokes for adults that kids just wouldn't get. BUT- it's even better for kids!!! This is probably my favorite kids show ever. If you haven't watched it yet- TUNE IN!!! Music by Taj Mahal... Narration by Joan Cusak.... Peep and Quack are just ADORABLE!

8054267,5,B0007YXPRE,"There are a lot of preschool shows out there, many of which move too fast (quick screen changes), are too loud and just plain obnoxious. This is not one of those. It is very chill and offers humor even for parents. My two year old daughter loves, it's the only screen time event she laughs out loud to.",1483056000,,302,4.224137931034483
