3771631,5,B001QYOSEI,Excellent If I Bought It I Must have liked IT!,1286064000,,46,3.7
3771632,4,B001QYOSEI,"From 1959 to 1962, writer/director Delmer Daves had movie audiences crying and swooning with a cycle of lush teen romance titles (keeping heart-throb Troy Donahue in solid employment!), beginning with ""A Summer Place"", and continuing through ""Parrish"", ""Susan Slade"" and ""Rome Adventure"".

SUSAN SLADE (1961) was amongst the best of the bunch.  A soapy tale of one girl's coming of age, it gave Connie Stevens the chance to prove her own dramatic worth--she'd previously played the love interest to Donahue earlier that same year in ""Parrish""--and it also starred three more fine actors with solid Sixties Melodrama cred: Dorothy McGuire (""A Summer Place""), Lloyd Nolan (""Peyton Place""), and Brian Aherne (""The Best of Everything"").

When Roger Slade (Nolan) retires from managing a mine in Chil, he takes his wife Leah (McGuire) and daughter Susan (Stevens) back to the States for a new start.  During the long sea voyage home, shy Susan experiences her first taste of love when she meets Conn (Grant Williams, ""The Incredible Shrinking Man""), an adventurous young mountain climber.  Once at home in Pebble Beach, Susan rejects advances from preppy family friend Wells (Bert Convy) as well as troubled stable-hand Hoyt (Donahue), holding fast to the day when Conn will return and marry her.  But when tragic news arrives, Susan must face the horrible truth - she is going to have a baby out of wedlock...

This was indeed the ""girly"" answer to ""Parrish"", with Donahue this time supporting Stevens, just as she had done with him.  They had a rare and remarkable chemistry and later appeared together again in the 1963 ""Beach Party"" knock-off, ""Palm Springs Weekend"".  Dorothy McGuire and Lloyd Nolan add a great realism playing Susan's parents; the cast also includes Natalie Shafer and Kent Smith.

Sadly, the extras on the DVD are limited to the trailer.  It would have been fantastic for Warners to have included an audio commentary with Ms Stevens.",1259884800,24,1952,5.087774294670846
3771633,5,B001QYOSEI,"I saw this movie as a young teenager with my girlfriends.  Back then, our parents saw it first at the movies to ensure it was proper.  The quality was excellent and I am pleased to have this in my movie library.",1256860800,4,211,4.121951219512195
3771634,4,B001QYOSEI,It's a film of old fashion love that will never capture what is going on right now. Then one has to remember it was filmed in the 60's.  Very refreshing for what we are wataching today.,1238716800,5,185,4.138888888888889

3771639,5,B001QYOSEI,"Perfect example of teenage vehicle of its time, the early sixties.  Engrossing, visually pleasing soap opera with plenty of Sturm under drang.  I love it though I see its cheesy faults.  Darling Troy Donahue is Susan's good friend who saves her life and supports and encourages her to have the courage to confront the crippling lie which hinders her from maturity.  As Susan grows up she recognizes where her heart belongs.  Not chained to her dead lover's memory but to the friend who offers true love.",1469923200,3,503,4.8023255813953485

3771659,5,B001QYOSEI,Wanted to see Troy Donahue in this and was pleasantly surprised at his acting ability.  Far superior to other actors that are terribly overrated.  I find his spontaneous facial expressions interesting in all his films which I have only recently discovered.  The past criticisms of his acting were very wrong.  The guy was quite natural.  His sexy lips were a delight to behold.,1442016000,,377,4.920634920634921

3771672,3,B001QYOSEI,"Lackluster script and interpretation disappoint.  Troy Donahue does not have the starring part but does deliver a solid, good performance.  Connie Stevens is alright but a bit too naive to be really convincing.  The potential existed for a good film but in effect, a lesser motion picture was produced.
Alright if you have nothing better to do on a cold or rainy day.",1425772800,,367,4.7936507936507935
3771673,5,B001QYOSEI,"SUSAN SLADE has been long awaited and I am glad it is included here. You really have to put yourself back in time to that time when this film was made and released. This was the way it was then. There is heartbreaking sentimentality to be found here and yet hope is never lost. This is not truly a love story, but a film about love lost and the capacity to find love again. SUSAN SLADE was director Delmer Daves' third picture with Troy Donahue, yet Connie Stevens playing Susan Slade is the main character here. Fine performances by Lloyd Nolan, Dorothy McGuire and Brian Aherne along with Lucien Ballard's beautiful cinematography and Max Steiner's score are highlights.

3771690,4,B001QYOSEI,"Not bad, early 60's love story of a young girl who gets pregnant by her fianc and ends up with a real problem when her boyfriend dies.  Due to the era she cannot present the child as her own so her loving parents pretend the baby as theirs.  She then has two suitors who want to marry her but she doesn't want to continue the pretense and wants to claim her child as hers.  Her two suitors are Bert Convy as the nice looking but extremely bland son of ultra rich parents who, though good people, seem to want to control everything in their sight including the girl's parents.  They even decorate the parent's house.  Then there is Troy Donahue who is very nice-looking but does not seem to light any fires.  The best guy was the girl's fianc and the baby's father.  Played by Grant Williams who, in my opinion was very hot.  Too bad he topples off a mountain.  The film is beautifully produced in the Big Sur area of California.  Great film for Troy Donahue fans.",1403481600,2,963,4.329608938547486

3771692,5,B001QYOSEI,"I love this movie. It has the ups and down of a young woman who is just starting her romantic life after being stuck in the Chile desert.  When she finds a first love, something happens and she winds up pregnant. Back when this movie was made it was just terrible embarrassing for a single young woman to gets  pregnant.  They get back to Southern CA and the secrets begin!  To cover up a pregnancy, her parents try to pass the baby off as a brother.  Finally when the truth emerges it is shocking seeing who will still love her.  The guys (Troy , a stable boy and a wealthy suitor}  Watch  and see who winds up standing by Susan and who does not]!  I did see this movie when I was a teenager at a Drive In Movie !  It is an excellent movie for anyone who likes Connie and Troy!  I would recommend this movie!",1402185600,4,809,4.089171974522293
3771693,5,B001QYOSEI,"I have watched this movie many times because I love the house and its decor.  The movie dates back to a time when pregnant girls were sent away until they delivered or else they married and had a baby arrive only 7 months after the wedding.  The movie is enjoyable, but the mid century modern house with Asian decor is really why I watch the movie over and over.",1399680000,4,362,4.231884057971015

3771704,5,B001QYOSEI,This was the first Troy Donahue movie that I had to toss up who I liked best Troy or Grant Williams. Big decision for a 17 year old. But what the hell I gave them both top points. Loved it as much as when I was that dewy eyed 17 year old. Can not wait to sit down and watch it again with the granddaughters. Recommend it highly.,1350172800,,328,3.838235294117647
3771705,5,B001QYOSEI,"First off, I must admit that I am a huge fan of those schlocky late 50's/early 60's big screen, big stars schmaltz-fest movies. Ah, those grand morality plays which divided women into two groups: good girls; bad girls.  Men controlled their fates and marriage was a necessity for a woman's ultimate fulfillment. A Summer Place, Parrish, Rome Adventure, Ice Palace, Best of Everything, etc. may be the front-runners, but Susan Slade was always my favorite - although not for the reasons hoped by the participants. It is truly hilarious!

Connie Stevens is so perky and excited that one hopes she is slipped a Xanax - and soon.  Lloyd Nolan as the father speaks in bumpersticker, ""always darkest before the dawn"" platitudes.  Dorothy McGuire as the 40+ year old mother plays the prim ""reputation is everything,"" to the point of claiming her grandchild as her own son.  Troy Donahue plays the gorgeous, chip-on-his-shoulder, ""I am not worthy"" underdog he perfected to an art form in his movies.  The storyline is just hilarious - in these movies, life-altering things happen often and quickly.  The shot of the burning babydoll still makes me laugh everytime I see it.

As I said earlier, lots of other big-budget films of the genre eclipsed Susan Slade in popularity, but this one delivers on all levels.

Please know I am not trying to be snarky here.  I am just trying to express how truly endearing this movie is. Imagine a ridiculous movie in which the Mystery Science Theatre guys could not better in their narration - one in which the story and script was already a parody of itself. This review is not meant to belittle; it is meant to help those with a strong sense of the absurd (like me) discover and enjoy this film.

So invite your friends over for wine and big-screen schlock.  Sure, play A Summer Place, Peyton Place, The Best of Everything, Diamond Head, et al, but make sure to include Susan Slade.  It will bring down the house!",1347235200,,1943,4.729970326409496
3771706,3,B001QYOSEI,"Good old love story film from the 60's, when sex and having children outside marriage was taboo. I had seen this movie on TV some years ago and had thought about seeing it again, but don't think I've ever seen in for rent, so when I saw it was available on DVD now at Amazon, I just couldn't resist. I'm sure I will watch it again when I am in one of those moods for the ""good old days."" A bet of cheesy acting, but great old stars pull it off.",1342915200,3,444,3.89010989010989
3771707,5,B001QYOSEI,"This is one of my all time favorite movies as I will never forget back in the 60's what a controversial movie it was.  Connie Stevens had an outstanding role!  Every teenage girl wanted to see this movie in it's day, oh how times have changed.  My parents would never have been as broad minded as the parents in this movie.  I have shown this movie to both my 24 year old daughter & 14 year old son, they both look at me and say ""Mom, how many years ago...you are ancient"", I just smile!  Times were so different back then, I still enjoy watching this movie and always will.

I've thought about it from time to time and recently,for some reason, it popped into my head again and I looked on Amazon and ordered it. It is a much better movie than I remembered and the acting by Connie Stevens was perfect for the role. Even Troy Donahue rose to the occasion and was perfect in his role. It's just an incredibly sweet story that could happen to any young inexperienced girl thrown into that set of circumstances and back in that time period. I, unfortunately, am old enough to remember that time period while many people now do not. I really enjoyed it and sat right down and ordered Parrish, a movie that I also saw many years ago after having read the book. I expect to enjoy it just as much. Maybe I'm going through my second childhood but it's lovely to go back to these beautifully filmed old movies and enjoy them again. Thanks Amazon.",1331337600,,993,4.315508021390374

8336894,4,B001QYOSEI,I liked the portrail of a young girl becoming an unmarried mother and the pressure to hide it from the world.  That stigma does not exist in most countries today. So it would be hard for the younger generation today to understand that. The scene where the baby is on fire looked a bit fake- but the technology wasn't as sophisticated as in todays movies.,1517097600,,354,4.446153846153846

8336900,4,B001QYOSEI,"This is a movie I saw when I was in my early 20's or maybe late teens and I was just reliving some of the past.  I really like this movie.  It's certainly ""dated"" but as they say ""an oldie, but a goodie.""  Love Connie Stevens and Troy Donahue!  They were so young and good looking in their day.  If you're looking to relive a little of the past and love a little of the ""corn ball"" this movie is for YOU!",1487894400,,404,3.8780487804878048
8336901,3,B001QYOSEI,Thought this would be a good companion to A Summer Place but it does not even come close.  Did not enjoy it.,1481241600,,108,3.909090909090909
8336902,5,B001QYOSEI,Saw this movie as an early teen. Troy and Connie were my first teen crushes. Just realized how good this movie actually is viewing it as an adult.,1480809600,,146,4.25
