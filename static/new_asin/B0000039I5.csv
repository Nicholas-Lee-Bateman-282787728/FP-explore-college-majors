If they can take a no-talent ""Blue Collar"" guy and transform HIM into a star, then their place in history  is assured. Or somethin' like that - it's a novel idea. Too bad that  Everett Sloan, Phil Harris, Keenan Wynn, Ina Balin, John Carradine, Peter  Lorre, and Scatman Cruthers are saddled with downbeat dialogue and stilted  direction. But there are a few hilarious scenes (his first rehearsal, his  first club appearance, and an incredible Ed Sullivan self-parody).",961804800,2,570,5.1521739130434785
1178017,4,B0000039I5,"This is not Jerry's best work but still there are plenty of sight gags to go around to give his fans something to laugh at! I can understand why there seems to be a sharp divide on his comedy style....he's in your face and not the least bit subtle, although when you look at his comedic routines in this you can see there was a great deal of thought put into them.
Jerry plays Stanley, a clumsy and socially awkward bellboy who falls into the hands of record and movie producers who are at odds after losing their ""Cash Cow"" in a plane accident. They pick unsuspecting Jerry to fill his shoes and continue their success. WHY??? So there would be a movie, that's why!
I think the word, ""Zany"" was invented for Jerry, so you can sit back and enjoy the mayhem, I'm sure you'll find something to make you smile!",1335571200,,807,4.315789473684211
1178018,5,B0000039I5,"This is another of Jerry's really great movies! He is really good in this. This movie is one where you want to get a nice bowl of Popcorn and watch it, because it is wonderful! He is a one of a Kind....Thank you, Jerry! And thank you to Amazon!",1326585600,,244,4.0
1178019,3,B0000039I5,"Director Jerry Lewis' cynical, reflexive look at show-biz phoniness has grown in stature during the past 20 years. ""The Patsy"" (1964) features several hilarious routines from the King of Crazy - interspersed with some excruciatingly painful moments. A stronger-than-usual cast includes Ina Balin, Everett Sloane, Phil Harris,  Keenan Wynn and Peter Lorre in his final screen role. Ed Sullivan's outrageous cameo is worth the price of admission. No match for ""The Nutty Professor"" (1963), yet one of Jerry's most intriguing films.",1315785600,4,529,5.530864197530864
1178020,5,B0000039I5,"Definitely some of Jerry's funniest routines EVER. In this film he's a nobody being groomed for stardom by a group of greedy and ambitious agents. Keep an eye out for my four favorite scenes ... the singing lesson, the barber shop scene, the recording session with the three backup singers, and Jerry lip-synching his #1 hit ""I Lost My Heart in a Drive-In Movie."" I laughed so hard I had to pause the movie twice because I nearly stopped breathing. This movie is one of Jerry's very best.",1315267200,,488,4.556818181818182
1178021,5,B0000039I5,"Jerry's movies took the same path as Elvis movies - downhill, becoming less ambitious and relying on a formula that was way past the expiration date - they are only tolerable because of their stars - and usually only tolerable to the biggest of fans - ""The Patsy"" is an example - if you love Jerry then you will love this - this is my favorite Jerry - 1960s surf/beatles era Jerry - his movies took on a surreal tone in the 1960s - the colors, the abstract sets, the silent visual gags - very staged, very artificial and very cinematic - even the smaller scale ones like ""The Patsy"" - Jerry and company could deliver a lot with very little coin - great stuff - required film school viewing",1272672000,4,689,4.3076923076923075
1178022,5,B0000039I5,"A devastating satire of show business. Jerry plays Stanley, an innocent bellboy manipulated by a team of moneymakers from show business who try to ""push"" him to replace a recent deceased star comedian. Lewis dismounts in this very calculated comedy  the hidden interests and vanities of show industry with his characteristic mocking comicity and destructive, many times surreal, humour. John Carradine, Peter Lorre and George Raft, in another funny cameo ( see "" The ladies man ), join Lewis in this one, his fifth film as director.

1178023,3,B0000039I5,"When a star comedian dies his team decides to replace him.  Jerry Lewis is the fortunate, or unfortunate, victim.  We see the team, which includes Ellen Betz (Ina Balin), Harry Silver (Keenan Wynn), Morgan Heywood (Peter Lorre), and Bruce Alden (John Carradine), among others, attempt to transform Stanley Belt (Lewis) from a bumbling bellboy to a comedian.

There is a tie-in to another Lewis movie.  In 1960 Lewis starred in ""The Bellboy,"" where he played Stanley.  However, I thought that the bellboy in the earlier movie was much more confident and capable than the bellboy in this later movie.

There are portions of this movie that I thought were funny.  There were even portions that I found touching.  However, in comparison to many of Jerry Lewis's other movie; I thought this movie was less funny.  Sometimes the attempts at humor fell flat for me.  However, I will also note that this movie is quite popular with fans of Jerry Lewis.

If you like only some of Jerry Lewis's movies, you may find this one too tedious to be enjoyable.  If you are a fan of Jerry Lewis, likely you will find this movie to be humorous.  However, Jerry Lewis had many other films that were better and funnier.",1118188800,13,1198,4.701923076923077
1178024,5,B0000039I5,If you like the humor of Jerry Lewis when it comes to spoofing the entertainment world then this is the VHS to own in your collection. Personally I thought it was one of his best efforts with his years with Paramount. A great cast of Hollywood's past is featured in this 40 year old comedy.  It's a rollicking look at creating a big time wannabe from Lewis' own perspective. Enjoy!,1092528000,3,381,4.442857142857143
1178025,5,B0000039I5,"The Patsy, Lewis' fifth film as a director and one of his best, can be considered as a semi-sequel to both The Bellboy (his first) and The Errand Boy (his third). Like its two predecessors, it features a confrontation between a complete outsider (always played by Lewis) and a lavish, illusionistic and mercantile milieu. As in all of his films, the interplay between 'Lewis the artist' (a natural performer whose inventiveness knows no bounds) and 'Lewis the star' (has more swagger, aggressiveness and self-confidence but far less freedom) is central here. It takes place in a single character (named Stanley as in The Bellboy) whose road to stardom is as unexpected and multi-layered as Morty's was in The Errand Boy. In many ways, the artist-star conflict is resolved in the postmodern conclusion: Lewis' choice to equal Stanley with himself - and The Patsy's world with 'reality' - implies that the true star-artist is finally made possible. Some of the movie's set pieces - Stanley's first appearance, the singing lesson, the silent flashback, the failed stand-up performance - are among the most effective of Lewis' filmography, seamlessly weaving together the sophisticated and the grotesque. A very impressive film from an underrated filmmaker.",1085788800,14,1253,5.2388059701492535

7902443,1,B0000039I5,"This film is so loose and disjointed that I was surprised it took so long for Jerry Lewis to completely break what little character he had and blow the illusion of a film (and that does deliberately happen).

There are a lot of great actors and cameos but they're all hanging on a threadbare plot where overdressed, cynical Hollywood types pick their hotel bellboy to replace an unseen superstar who's killed in a plane crash.

I loved THE NUTTY PROFESSOR and THE LADIES MAN.  But THE PATSY is uneven and unfunny too many times.

(And after reading about Jerry's tantrums and seeing some outtakes on youtube...is it me, or does everyone else in the film appear politely terrified?)",1370563200,,681,4.745762711864407
7902444,3,B0000039I5,"Written by Jerry Lewis and Bill Richmond, and directed by Lewis,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Nutty-Professor/dp/B00004WZ0C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Nutty Professor</a>&nbsp;(1963) was arguably Lewis' best film up to that point.  While Lewis and Richmond got most thing right in The Nutty Professor, they unfortunately were not quite on target in their follow up, The Patsy (1964) which follows the adventures of a bellboy named Stanley Belt, who is recruited by the handlers of a famous comic, to replace him.

When comedian Wally Brandford tragically dies in a plane crash, his staff decides to find a replacement, so they will continue to remain employed.  Their choice is Stanley Belt (Lewis), a bumbling bellboy at the Beverly Hilton.  The team begins to makeover the talentless Belt, giving him new clothes, a haircut, and instruction in singing, dancing, and telling jokes.

More of a bumbler, Belt displays few abilities as an entertainer.  He arrives at a recording studio to provide lead vocals on a song called ""I Lost My Heart In A Drive-In Movie"", but the payoff for the scene is not Belt's singing performance, but three backup singers played by Lewis in drag.  Stanley next goes on a teen dance show, to lip sync to his new hit single.  In The Nutty Professor, Buddy Love won over everyone with his singing ability.  Here in a scene that is a disaster, Lewis goes in the opposite direction, with some deliberately atrocious singing.  Belt is also terrible as a standup comic.

Stanley's handlers somehow manage to book him on The Ed Sullivan Show, but expecting him to bomb, with one exception, the team abandons him.  With his back against the wall, Stanley Belt finally comes through, with a creative exercise where he transforms his ordinary outfit into formal attire.  Based on this performance, Stanley becomes a ""star"".

Some of the many cameos are interesting, such as Hedda Hopper's, and there are couple of genuinely funny bits along the way, such as Belt's singing lesson with an instructor played by Hans Conried, but under Lewis' direction, much of the humor seems forced, and already outdated.  Lewis was 38 when this film was made, and seemingly stuck in a time warp, he keeps relying on the same childish antics that worked in his Martin and Lewis days.  Something he would continue to do well into his 40's.

The film has a solid supporting cast that includes, Peter Lorre, John Carradine, Keenan Wynn, Phil Harris, and Everett Sloane.  Ina Balin is the lone female on Belt's team, and her character Ellen suddenly becomes Stanley's love interest.  Lewis' films are usually unpolished in the romance department, and that is true again here.

After hitting a home run with The Nutty Professor, Lewis and Richmond strike out big time with The Patsy, a film that just never delivers the goods.  Unfocused and poorly executed, the movie builds up to Stanley Belt's performance on Ed Sullivan, but instead of coming up with something outstanding , the result seems inappropriate, anticlimactic, and unsatisfying, as Lewis then breaks the fourth wall to bail out at the finish.  Unless you are a dedicated fan, you can probably pass on this one.  Rating: 2.5 stars.",1343174400,,3246,5.129277566539924
