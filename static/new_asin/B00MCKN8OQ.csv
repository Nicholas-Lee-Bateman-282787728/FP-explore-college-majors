8671655,5,B00MCKN8OQ,"Lone Survivor is one of my all time favorite movies so that's why I bought this.  Green Zone is okay (sorry Matt Damon!  I still love you!!)  Contraband was pretty good.  Zero Dark Thirty didn't keep me and haven't seen Safe House.  If you haven't seen Lone Survivor, it's a must watch!  I've seen it at least 20 times and I'm a girl who doesn't like guns or violence.  Amazing story!",1461024000,4,384,4.323943661971831
