7961056,4,B000065LQP,"All three of my children have enjoyed Caillou over the years.  He is a sort of ""soap opera"" character for toddlers, battling life's trials and tribulations.  To me, he often seems whiny and a little annoying, but children take Caillou and his troubles very seriously.  They want Caillou to be happy, and I think this helps teach them compassion, multiple worldviews, and emotional navigation within their own environments.  The show is calm, slow paced, and gentle, and children are drawn into the life explorations Caillou has each day.

Caillou does not mean ""Melonhead"".  Where do people get this?  In French, ""melon head"" is ""tte de melon"". It would be a rather insulting name for a 9 month old, bald child, if you ask me.

""Caillou"" means ""stone"" or ""pepple"", and comes from the author's technique for teaching children currency by using pepples as payment.

This serious is well worth it for both children and parents who work together to as they navigate every day issues and joys.",1299110400,3,988,4.868263473053892
7961057,5,B000065LQP,My daughter is 2 years old and starts to speak French.  This is the perfect dvd for her. She loves Caillou!,1245110400,,107,4.095238095238095
7961058,5,B000065LQP,"My son really seems to enjoy this video. I was raised in a bilingual home and am hoping to teach our son French even though my husband does not speak the language. This is a sweet video with plenty of variety. My son comes to me now wanting to help and saying ""Voila, Maman"" just like Caillou.",1230854400,3,293,4.157894736842105

It includes:  vol. 2 Caillou: Caillou's summertime& other adventures  Vol. 3 Caillou: Big Brother Caillou& other adventures

Vol. 4 Caillou: Caillou's Train Trip & other adventures.  It is a GREAT buy if you don't want to have to pay anywhere from $10-$15 a piece for them.  Is a great set to own for all children!",1164585600,7,472,4.602409638554217
7961060,5,B000065LQP,"I found the last comment about Caillou meaning melon head very funny. Actually, acording to the Caillou website it means ""pebble"" in French. This was because he is based on the Studies of Dr. Dolto. She told children to pay her in pebbles for her help which gave them a sense of being in charge of their own care. My husband is always asking ""what kind of name is Caillou?"" I looked it up because I wanted to be able to answer him!",1144972800,5,431,4.204819277108434
7961061,5,B000065LQP,"I love Caillou(pronounced ky-yoo).Here's an interesting fact about his name. The name Caillou is a combo of the 2 french words:llou(yoo) meaning meaning head cai (ky)meaning melon. So together,Caillou is french for Melon Head. Now,back to reveiwing this. This has every episode from Caillou. It was airing from 2000-.Eventhough,the show is popular in America,it's really Canadian because Caillou is a french name andthey mostly speak english in the show. Canada speaks French and English. I like to watch the show because of Gilbert,Rexy and Matthew Theodore Teddy Bear when they're real.(don't worry,I like the animated parts ,to)The show is both fun and educational. Since,this is Caillou Collection,the video might last forever.
