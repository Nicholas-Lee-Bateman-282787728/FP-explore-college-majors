A new vision of what is art and many new energies.
Besides that there are artists with an incredible imagination such as Allora & Calzadilla. I hope they keep coming out as good as this DVD.

8277267,3,B000Q1I8WA,"I liked the idea of the series, and I thought I liked the laid-back manner the producers used, so the artist could explain their process, inspirations, personal history, and so on. I thought that was what I wanted. But after watching the entire 6 season run, I found two memorable segments on artists who were personal favorites -- particularly Walton Ford -- and one memorable segment on an artist I was unfamiliar with, and who has since become a new favorite, Shahzia Sikander.

It didn't take long to remember why I usually avoid reading interviews with my favorite artists. It's f***ing torture. Sometimes, it's the fault of the interviewer, but it's never enlightening (I'll amend that to 'rarely'; I have read interesting artist comments, but it's 1 time in 20. Critics always do a better job than the artist. Call it the ""Yeah, Ditto"" phenomenon). Even Gerhard Richter, one of the artists I respect more than any other, isn't able to say anything meaningful about his massive catalogue raisonne. They're not writers. And the 'good talker/bad artist's who end up famous are usually con-men (con-people?); they're an insult to the real artists killing themselves with Cheetos at the moment, because they haven't learned schmoozing and the jargon-laden language of bulls*** common to crappy artists, tech salesmen and politicians. 'How to Say Nothing in Eighty Words or Higher'... until people assume the fault lies with them, and drift away with a glazed look in their eye... Hint: if the listener doesn't understand what the speaker is saying, the fault probably lies with the speaker, not the listener -- art is not quantum mechanics. Art is another form of communication. If an artist has failed to communicate their meaning to an audience, the fault probably lies with the artist.

Too many of the artists featured had achieved success through trendy whims that breeze through the galleries of New York and Paris, making ugly, meaningless works that spark no feelings and no intellectual curiosity, sold by agents and gallery owners who market personalities, regardless of their talent or utter lack thereof. The goal is to convince people that the artist and their acolytes understand something, see something that others do not, even though this failure to effectively communicate means an artist has failed. But rich Americans believe in the 'fake it til you make it' principle, and will buy any moronic piece of crap that the 'in crowd' believe to be cutting edge brilliance.

After listening to dozens of famous pretend artists stumble through their used car salesman routine for the three hundredth time, obviously possessing no talent and no way of articulating a clever explanation for superficial trash, it gets really dull. A bit of variety would have been nice; more artists with craft and skill -- it's okay to be talented again... you don't have to deliberately make crap that looks like it was slapped together by a retarded kid (sorry, that's unfair to mentally handicapped kids).

This would make a great sleep aid. I'm getting drowsy just thinking about it... and I LOVE art.

P.S.: Reading this again, it sounds pretty hostile. Wow. I must have been in a bad mood. Check the PBS website for a list of the artists involved, if you like even a quarter of the people featured, you'll likely get way more out of this than I did. If you're into some of the styles that the show-runners favor, that's all that matters anyway. And the price was really reasonable for the amount of material collected. If you don't recognize any names... you should probably skip it and check out some info first.",1422144000,11,3616,4.940789473684211
