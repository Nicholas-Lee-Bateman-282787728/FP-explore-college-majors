3732,1,0764193627,"The video is very short. Somewhat a 70's or early 80's style. It shows the girl getting her diaper changed often and how ""happy"" she is about it. The video is extremely short so don't expect a ""movie"". It's just 2 songs. I plan to resell mine -- it made my daughter and my neighbor's daughter go *back* into diapers. I was mortified how this video makes diapers look so ""cool"".",1222128000,4,377,4.323943661971831
3733,5,0764193627,"My daughter loved the The Potty Book for Girls.  After two weeks of potty training, she was 90% consistent with pee in her potty, but poop was still scary to her.  She looked frightened and didn't seem to know if she could do poop in the potty too.  She requested a diaper or ran away instead.  This was stressful for everyone.

I thought the corresponding DVD might help Maya along in the #2 department.  We watched what Maya calls her ""Hannah"" movie (the name of the main character) on a Sunday afternoon.  Within two hours, she had gone poop in the potty for the very first time.  I credit the Hannah video for helping her take that last step.  Since then, Maya has pooped in the potty four more times and is just so proud of each one.  She insists that we go get Daddy so that he can see her poop too.

If your daughter likes the Hannah book, I think she will also like the video.  It is short (about 15 minutes), which some may think is a low value for the money, but I think it is a good length for a young child's attention span (Our daughter is 2 years and 4 months).  It basically retells the book's same story but with animated versions of Hannah and her family.  It also has a fun song that my daughter likes to sing: ""Bye-bye poop"" set to the tune of ""Bye-bye love.""

However, I think the thing that was most effective was that the video actually pictured poop in the potty after Hannah went.  So many videos talk about poop, but they don't show it there.  I think that seeing the poop in Hannah's potty showed Maya that it was really okay to poop in the potty.

Another good thing is that the video, like the book, is very positive and affirming.  It doesn't shame accidents, it encourages children to be proud of when they do pee or poop in the potty, and it clearly shows that it is okay to go potty when you are ready--providing a nice tranisiton from diapers to potty.

Maya requests seeing Hannah at least once most days.  Though a short video, I think that it's well worth the money.  For any parent who has chased around a scared and confused child who has pooped in his/her underpants and doesn't know what to do, this is truly worth it.  Though Maya's pride in her poop may seem bizarre to some, I am happy that she feels proud of what she could accomplish.  As a side note, Maya started trying to dress herself two days after she became successful with poop.  I know that many of these steps are developmental anyway, but I figure that anything that helps support that natural process in a positive way is definitely worth it.

A final factor may be that Maya is in a complete pink obsession mode.  I think it helps that Hannah loves pink too.  Being able to see another girl like her succeed at using the potty makes it all the easier.  This morning, Maya woke up and told me, ""I know how to use the potty.""  That this was her first, happy thought this morning makes me glad.  Thank you, Hannah!",1214956800,22,2919,4.281535648994516
3734,3,0764193627,Really wish the movie went with the story. They should've done two; one version goes with the story and keep the version that's already omn the DVD. It's just eh. I recommend only if they're potty trained and already read the book. It will drive parents nuts. Band is featured on several Sprout shows.,1441843200,,301,4.592592592592593
3735,2,0764193627,"My daughter's potty training has been a process and I was looking for anything and everything I could get my hands on to reinforce potty training. My 2 year-old seems to like the movie and asks to watch it sometimes. The movie helps keep potty training top of mind. But, the animation quality is very limited -- my husband thought we were watching and old VHS-tape, not a DVD. This is one tool you can use with your kids and I don't think it hurt to buy it -- but I'm looking forward to when my second child is potty trained and we can give this DVD away to someone else! I also agree with the other reviewers that the movie talks about diapers way too much and could send the wrong message to children you are trying to get out of diapers.",1436572800,,740,4.181818181818182
3736,4,0764193627,"I purchased the DVD for my 2 yr old and she loves it. Even though she no longer watches the movie she still sings the song when she flushes the toilet.  People said it's repetitive, but it has to be for little kids to get it. Some people said it was too long, but I disagree,  it's fine. I let my daughter watch the DVD many many times before having her try to potty, and we put the potty out so she could do  what the movie shows. When we removed the diaper about a week later she used it and never had any accidents, and she was trained that same day. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because they should have gotten someone who sounds younger to do the little girls voice......people were right about that.  I will save the DVD for my younger daughter and hope it has the same effect. Good luck!!",1431302400,,803,4.063291139240507

She really picks things up from watching educational programs and this helped her become interested in using the potty. I also purchased the potty book for girls and she also enjoys when we read it to her. Our daughter is potty trained now at 2yrs 2 months and I believe these items help speed up the process. I truly believe your child has to be ready to learn to be potty trained before even trying the potty training process and this cute dvd and book helped.

They have memorized the words to the potty song and will more readily sit on the potty when the movie is played.",1404086400,,323,4.491525423728813
3749,5,0764193627,"My daughter fell in love with the book as we were starting potty training.  I didn't know at first there even WAS a movie.  As soon as I found out about it, I ordered it.  Even though she was already mostly trained by the time it came in (which was so successful in part because of the book), it was still fantastic for her.  Really, the book is a shortened version of the movie.  In the movie, it's more about getting to be a big girl and starting to do more for yourself than just about potty training.  Hannah (the little girl in the movie) talks about learning to brush her teeth and eat food too.

My daughter just LOVES it.  One of the things I think that makes it work so well is that it doesn't talk down to the toddlers.  The way it's done they can really connect and relate to it.  I just can't recommend this and the book more highly for anyone doing potty training.",1401062400,,877,4.136094674556213
3750,5,0764193627,"Daughter just turned 3.  Bought this b/c we had so many issues wanting her to use the potty.  She watched this several times per week {she asks to watch it ALOT} for about 6+ weeks.  She loves the cute jingle and it's fun for us adults, too.  The lyrics are helpful in the power of suggestion and the catchy tune which I think is the magic to this one.  Suddenly she just decided that she wanted to use her potty chair instead of wearing diapers.  She has been completely out of diapers during waking hours and naps.  On the 3rd night {last night}, she decided she wanted to go to bed without a diaper and used the potty chair {next to her bed} instead.  Bed was dry the next morning.  Had tried other products {like Elmo's} but they did nothing.  We couldn't be happier with the results.",1400284800,,788,4.299319727891157

3753,5,0764193627,I have shown this movie to 2 toddlers and they both love it. They love to watch the real live kids at the beginning and at the end dancing around. They also really enjoy the animated part. I have read other reviews where people complained that Hannah's voice doesn't sound like a kid but it doesn't bother me or the kids I've shown it to. I don't think they even noticed. I like that this movie also briefly touches on a few other things like washing hands and brushing teeth. And it recommends going to the potty first thing when you wake up in the morning. I thought that was a really good recommendation.  Would definitely recommend this product and this seller. Very happy with purchase.,1391126400,2,691,4.484126984126984
3754,3,0764193627,"Besides...the little girl's voice can be annoying and it does not sound like a little girl...sounds like and older fully grown woman.
The movie is also very repetitive, it's like a nonstop sequence of the same things over and over with a very irritation voice.
The songs suck....but my daughter got the point and understood what it was about in the end but still not interested on going potty...I will not give up on trying to potty train her but at this point I know she will go by herself when she is ready so I am not going to put pressure on her over this...I have tried 3 potty DVDs and so far I think I managed to make her pee in her potty like twice.
My daughter just turned 2 and we've been trying to potty train her for the past 3 months....letting her go commando from her waist down seems to be helping us to know when to take her to her potty as we can see the signs that she has to go and sometimes she tells us when she has to go so that is a good start....but like I said this little improvement is not due to this DVD...your kid can get the idea from this DVD but she is not just suddenly start to go potty right away after watching it...so don't expect a miracle, this DVD is not going to do the wonder trick...if your daughter has not gotten  the idea yet, then this DVD is a good buy to start as it is very graphic and encouraging...the reality is that it just takes time, patience and some discipline...just be cool about it, give her a prize for everytime she tried and got it just to motivate her to keep trying and most importantly don't forget to give her a lot of love and it will be all nothing but a matter of time.",1390780800,,1642,4.099378881987578

3759,1,0764193627,"I bought this because we were working on potty training our 3 year old girl.  At first she really liked watching it and I started to notice that it was talking about peeing in a diaper.  As I listened a little closer it says ""I pee in my diaper that's what diapers are for""?!?!?!  If this is supposed to be a potty training dvd then it shouldn't say that in the video.  Now when we try to go to the potty she tells me she doesn't have to cause she can pee in her diaper that's what diapers are for.  So thanks a lot for throwing me back a few steps and wasting almost $15!  We then bought Elmo's Potty Time and she loves it and I think it is way better than this one was.

3761,3,0764193627,"Bought this video to encourage my 16 months old daughter to start using potty. Unlike other videos, both of us don't seem to be interested in watching the video very often. The voice of Hannah sounds weird, not quite sure it is a sound of a male or a female and sounds no innocence of a young child. Hearing the voice of Hannah bothers me a lot. The tone sounds very flat, like ""Hannah"" is reading the script.
