 Her exercises work and never ""go out of style"",  for lack of a better term.",1431216000,,204,3.627906976744186
8090244,4,B0000639GS,"I have been doing this workout for a month or so now and it is really effective and challenging. The music was annoying at first, sounds a little dated but you get used to it after a while.
You need a pilates ring for part of the workout but at the beginning I used nothing and still found it effective.
If you have a dance or gymnastics background, it is ideal for you.",1239667200,2,370,4.082191780821918

Blue - Powerhouse Exercises to strengthen Abs

Are you looking for a video to strengthen the ""powerhouse"" area of your body? That area from which all movements should begin. Karen has designed this beautifully and as you zero in on your abdominals, you also focus on strengthening you back.

This is a 50-minute ALL-floor workout. You alternate between abdominal sculpting and simple back-strengthening and stretching moves to create a more balance and stable center. Karen combines the teachings of Joseph Pilates, yoga, and ballet with her own body-sculpting techniques.

This will help you create a more stable center. You will find yourself sitting up taller and this particular video left me lying on the floor watching the second half because after you finish this workout, you know you have worked out.

For this workout you will only need a yoga mat and a towel. This helps to give you enough padding if you are working on a carpeted surface. Karen does sell a body reform mat if you are working out on a hard floor.

You will just love some of these moves if you work on the computer all day. It is amazing how tight your shoulders and chest can become. This workout will open out your chest and stretch that tired back.

This girl knows how to get you motivated. Just looking at her body makes me wish I had her motivation! She is just amazing.

Pink - Challenges from the Workout Goddess

Karen's calm voice has such a subtle way of enticing you into challenging exercises. The workout goddess herself will guide you through the workout while you are lying on your back, stomach or sitting. But don't think that because you are on the floor, this is going to be easy.

Let me tell you, this is definitely intermediate and will give you a great lower-body workout. By the time you hit the pushups, I guarantee you will be panting. Yes, the transitions are easy and the workout doesn't have any fancy steps. In fact, the entire workout consists of smooth distinctive movements based on Pilates, Yoga, Ballet, and Karen's unique and fun body-sculpting techniques.

First you wake up your muscles and head into a session of squeezing your thighs together with a ""Resist-a-Ring"" providing the resistance. You need a ""Resist-a-Ring"" (14"" spring-polymer circle with inside and outside padding) and a yoga mat to do this workout. Both can be ordered from Karen's site or can be found here - look for Pilates ring or ""magic circle.""

There are 8 minutes of stretching, 36 minutes of seated and lying toning and another 6 minutes of stretching/cool down. During the 50 minutes, you will work on your upper body for 4 minutes. The lower body emphasis lasts for 26 minutes with a concentration on Abs for 6 minutes.

The use of the ""Resist-a-Ring"" helps to inspire mental concentration, proper form and precise movements set to smooth, yet upbeat jazz music.

While you will feel the burn, upon completion you will also feel a subtle energy flowing through your entire body. Karen's workouts really do make you feel good and you can see the results.

If you are looking for special attention to help slim and firm your butt and things, this will give you the leaner look you desire. While you are not using weights in this workout, Karen recommends combining this exercise video with your regular routine of weights and aerobic exercise. If you enjoy this DVD, you will love Core Essentials and Abdominals & Back, which are part of the Body Reform/Pilates Series. YogaSculpt and Streamline Fitness are also favorites.

If you want to feel the burn, this is for you! You will also feel calm and in control for the rest of the day.

8090246,5,B0000639GS,I have been using Karen's DVD for my workout routine and I must say this is one of the best for those who want to streamline your body. My legs and bottom look leaner and firmer after working out with Karen's Total Body Pilates for a month. The workout is also very relaxing and destressing. A great workout to start the day or after a tiring day.,1158624000,2,347,4.1940298507462686
8090247,4,B0000639GS,"I have been doing Karen Voight videos since January 2005.  I have used several other exercise videos and the quality and instruction of her videos are by far the best.  I am an RMT and hence have a kinesiology background and the exercises are safe and help shape your body.  After trying the video I actually found my abdominal muscles sore which means, the video works!  My abdominal and core muscles are quite strong and my body has become far more streamlined.  The only thing missing is cardio which helps to burn up added calories - Karen covers this however in her Burn and Firm DVD.  I use her dvd's for cross training. Unlike Cathy Smith's videos, Karen's uplifting voice and professional attitude keep you entertained while benefitting by strengthening key muscles; the rectus and transverse abdominus, obliques and pelvic muscles and more...  My spouse however prefers her strong and streamlined video which includes weights, yoga and a bit of pilates combined.  Her videos have exceeded my expectations.",1121817600,12,1014,4.994047619047619
8090248,4,B0000639GS,"I bought this DVD along with the Kathy Smith: Pilates for the Lower Body DVD, and this one is a much better value for the money, giving two 50-minute workouts ... compared to Kathy Smith's one 1/2 hour workout ...Kathy Smith's video does give a better introduction to Pilates and working the ""powerhouse"" (abs pulled to the navel, pelvic floor pulled up, and gluts held in tight), though Karen's video does a better job of integrating these moves all together, with an emphasis on stretching and toning and an awareness of posture. I recommend renting Kathy's video to get the basics and so you can see how you can get away with not needing the resist-a-ring, and then using Karen's video to tone inner thighs and work the abs. There really isn't much of an upper body workout, though I like the workouts nonetheless. I think an intro to Pilates should be added, and agree that better chaptering to move to some of the sections that you like best could improve navigation. I also found that scanning backwards too quickly got me back to the first DVD menu and not to the start of the workout, which can cost precious minutes in a tight morning routine.",1059004800,32,1152,4.597087378640777
8090249,2,B0000639GS,"This review is based on the so-called ""total body"" portion of the DVD set. (I'm not sure how they get off calling it total body, considering it's a leg-lift video, w/about 24 total pushups and some crunches.) I bought this DVD b/c I wanted an introduction on video to pilates, and based on the other reviews, I expected it to be great. After purchasing this and spending [$$$] on the resist-a-ring, I was expecting a really good workout. Not only were the exercises and the video boring, but the workout could barely be called a workout. This is probably a good video for people who are just beginning to work out, don't belong to a gym, and just want to do very light exercising.  I did not even see the majority of the poses and moves that are discussed in The Pilates Body by Brooke Siler. As far as the resist-a-ring, I felt like I was using Suzanne Somer's Thighmaster! Rodney Yee's Power Yoga is a much better workout - no additional equipment needed!",1033516800,22,957,4.5
8090250,5,B0000639GS,"I think that this DVD is the most effective and the most professional Pilates DVD. You'll find 2 workouts : the first one is for the total body, and the second one is for your abs and back, but more for abs. Each of them is 50 minutes ! It's really challenging, and I am used to practise Pilates Method. I highly recommand it.",1021766400,31,326,4.109375
8090251,5,B0000639GS,"This DVD contains two pilates workouts. The first one really concentrates on legs. Great inner thigh work using the Pilates Magic Circle. KV sells one, and so do others. This may not be magic, but it is a great help for targeting inner and outer thighs.
 The other workout is Abs and Back focus- this targets two trouble spots. Usually abs are trouble because they don't look as great as we wish, and the back is a problem because it isn't as strong as we need, thus causing us pain. This workout will help with both problems, and in a gentle balanced manner. It is a great workout, at what most would consider an intermediate level. If you have never done pilates before, be prepared to have trouble with this workout, but don't feel pressured to do the whole thing the first time.
The workouts themselves deserve 5 stars and the fact that they are on a DVD is a great improvement. My biggest gripe is that I wish that the DVD had more chapters. KVs Circuit/BLT workout has some of the best chaptering of any DVD I have seen, so she isn't completely ignorant of how to chapter a DVD. My guess is that she thought that the sequencing in the originals was perfect, and she couldn't put together shorter workouts that she liked. But, I still wish she had. It would have been nice to have a shorter ab workout, and a beginner ab/back workout.",1021248000,86,1339,4.421052631578948
