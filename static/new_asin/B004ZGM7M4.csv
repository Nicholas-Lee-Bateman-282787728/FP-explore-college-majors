8449766,4,B004ZGM7M4,"I wasn't expecting too much since MTV Original Movies are just recycled stuff all the time. Of course, everybody can know what's the movie about with the title: ""The Worst Prom Ever.""
But what I was impressed about, it was the story. It's not only a prom movie, it's a twist of something that could happen to any teenager in a funny way.
Chloe Bridges did an amazing job as the leading girl, and I liked how real it felt, because in some Prom movies they don't show the bullies, gay people, and many more but this one did. It's not the best yet, but it was a complete surprise for sure.",1319241600,,586,4.241071428571429
