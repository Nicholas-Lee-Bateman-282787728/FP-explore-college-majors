8082061,4,B000B64TUA,"There are three shows on this DVD:
1. The Land of Israel
2. Tel Aviv
3. Kibbutz

As usual these are very good (but dated around 1987) Shalom Sesame programs featuring many of the American standard muppets, but also muppets that are specific to Israel, like Oscar's cousin Moishe Oofnick.  These three episodes are not my favorites and don't hold my children's attention as well as some others, but they are good to have in your collection and children WILL watch them and learn a little bit about Israel in the process.",1190678400,5,519,4.630434782608695
