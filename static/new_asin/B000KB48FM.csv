8155376,1,B000KB48FM,"not too keen on this,a lot of repetition and wanted more technical elements related to this level,too much emphasis on port de bras",1401494400,,131,4.739130434782608
8155377,5,B000KB48FM,"This DVD is an excellent aide for beginning students of pointe, regardless of age.  It begins with some easy stretches that provide a safe warm-up for the feet and ankles, and then quickly moves to a series of plies and releves, which emphasize the importance of smooth rolling  foot movements, and correctly positioning the entire body for balance.  As the video proceeds, the exercises grow progressively more challenging, demanding increased speed, coordination, and foot muscle strength.  This DVD includes both barrework and center floor work, and I found its explanations and illustrations to be extremely helpful.",1220227200,11,620,5.427083333333333
