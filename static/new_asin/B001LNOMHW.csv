8318888,3,B001LNOMHW,"Compared with the other three Sinister Cinema spaghetti swashbucklers I purchased, ""Revenge of the Musketeers"" triumphs.  By that, I mean it's actually watchable!  The story, though slight and rather preposterous, is enjoyable after a fashion, and Fernando Lamas (as D'Artagnan) and the three former musketeers seem to be enjoying themselves as they chase England's Prince Charles (later Charles II) around France.

The picture quality is passable.  Generally it's okay, but there are some very scratchy bits, and jumps, and the cropped picture (from widescreen to 4:3) is disappointing at times, especially when a speaking character's head is swallowed.  The sound is fine, though the out-of-sync dubbed dialogue can be disconcerting.

Sinister Cinema's DVDs are bare-bones: simple menu, few chapter markers, no film restoration.

I only recommend this for completest swashbuckler fans or those with a fondness for Italian cinema.",1337904000,,931,5.654676258992806
