7294624,3,B00ZSOWJAM,"Sam Ellis (Patrick Wilson) is an up and coming prosecutor. He goes after white collar politicians who are ""over privileged and morally bankrupt."" He wants to take down the mayor. In his office he interviews a high priced escort (Elena Satine) who claims the mayor was her client. Sam is reluctant to prosecute but does become curious about the web site. Soon he has an addiction for $1000/hr call girls. There is an investigation of the escort service which causes Sam to panic setting up the second half of the film.

The film takes place in South Carolina which had a governor with zipper problems. The production is also timed nicely with the Ashley Madison breech. The film never allows you to feel compassion for Sam Ellis, so when he gets into trouble, you are just watching a guy go through the motions. This appears to be some sort of behind the scenes of our real politicians film that didn't seem to drive it home.

7294634,3,B00ZSOWJAM,"There's not much depth to this movie, basically you've just got a federal prosecutor (Patrick Wilson) with desires for a political career, who is always standing on the moral platform high ground, who decides to have sex with a lot of prostitutes.  That's pretty much the whole plot.  The back cover quotes some obscure website called Crave Online who claim ""This Year's Gone Girl"". So you're expecting some sort of brilliant plot development, maybe a twist.  I was expecting maybe his intern (Dianna Argon) would when he opened the hotel door turn out to be one of the escorts and they both would have that oooh this is kind of awkward moment. But no, Argon's only in the film for a total of about two minutes all up anyway, she keeps her clothes on the whole two minutes too if that's why you were interested in this one.  Then I thought well maybe the same scenario will occur with his wife, she might be the elusive blonde girl the first prostitute tells him he'll really like who he never gets to hook up with early on, and eventually he'll turn up after looking forward to meeting her for so long and again a nice awkward moment.  Then I though oh I bet his wife is the woman he talks to on the phone to arrange to bed a new girl and she's been playing him all this time.

No there's nothing cool like that, it's just a simple keep sleeping with one after another until you get caught storyline.  If you're a fan of Patrick Wilson and want to see him in a lot of bedroom scenes, this movie has that, but if you were after a great story driven plot, you've unzipped the wrong movie.",1456531200,,1587,4.341216216216216

7294639,5,B00ZSOWJAM,"Zipper isn't specifically about Hillary Clinton, but she and Bill Clinton will to come to everyone's mind while watching this brilliant sexual/political thriller. More broadly, Zipper is about a specific type of woman. The power-hungry woman who will cover up for her husband's sexual infidelities, because she so craves being half of a Washington Power Couple.

Zipper is set in the South. Patrick Wilson plays Sam, an admired district attorney with a public image made for politics: Ivy League, squeaky clean, law-and-order, a family man. Everyone says he has a bright political future. Guests at a dinner party half-jokingly discuss his wife Jeannie's (Lena Headey) qualifications for First Lady.

But Sam is sexually dissatisfied. Married for 13 years, his sex life with Jeannie has gone stale. She won't experiment. She's content to go through their usual motions.

Sam is addicted to internet porn. He's always masturbating to his laptop, at times nearly getting caught.

When Jeannie takes away the kids for a weekend trip, Sam caves in to his fantasies and phones an escort service. The first time of many. It becomes an obsession, going to hotel rooms for sex with anonymous women. He's not having an affair. There is no love. It's an addiction -- sex with a series of prostitutes, never the same one twice.

After an FBI sting, an enterprising journalist threatens to expose Sam.

This is where Zipper's brilliance and originality lies. I had expected the usual story arc. Scandal. Public humiliation. The noble wife files for divorce. Sam's career and family life are destroyed. Duly accepting his chastisement, he emerges a wiser and better man. Perhaps redeemed by taking a humble job serving the community. Meekly phoning his kids on weekends, his ex-wife now with a better husband.

NOT!

I won't give away the details, but there may be some spoilers here...

After Jeannie explodes in the expected screamfest, expressing her hurt and anger at Sam's betrayal, she turns practical and cold-blooded. Determined to save Sam's career -- and their mutual political goals -- Jeannie almost unexpectedly engages in even deeper depravity than Sam, to cover up the scandal and kill the press story.

I say almost unexpectedly, because there are hints in Zipper's brilliant and literate script that Jeannie was always the more ambitious of the two, the primary driver of Sam's ambitions. When scandal and destruction seem inevitable, Sam is relieved. It's finally over. He talks of quitting the D.A.'s office and finding a humbler legal job, leading a normal, less stressful life. He promises to ""make it up"" to Jeannie. But she will hear none of it. She won't dump Sam. Neither will she let him quit.

The film flash-forwards several years. Sam is a celebrated and admired Senator. He's in Washington while Jeannie lives in Atlanta. To the public they are a model couple, faithful and loving, yet living apart to better serve the people. Yet we see that it's a marriage of political convenience. And that Sam's continuing ""zipper problem"" is now an an open secret in political circles, but safely hidden from public view. And presumably everyone with a vested interest in Sam's career, Jeannie included, continue to cover up for him.

Patrick Wilson (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Insidious/dp/B004LWZW24/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Insidious</a>&nbsp;-- one of the best horror films of this decade) offers an outstanding performance as Sam. Wilson conveys Sam's sincere desire to be the good guy everyone thinks he is. His attempts at fidelity and eventual failure. His mixed feelings about his wife. His grief and panic when he's nearly caught -- and Sam's chilling smugness at film's end, having become a morally bifurcated man who now cheats -- and lies -- with ease and grace.

Wilson is especially admirable in the scenes when he contacts and meets his first hooker. He's trembling and sweating outside a convenience story, using a prepaid cell phone, nearly hyperventilating in panic merely for calling an escort service. The scene is effectively supported by a moving camera and quick edits, conveying Sam's queasy guilt -- even his his nearly physical nausea at making the call.

The scene with the hooker is also well-down. Sam is nervous, tempted, and hesitant, He nearly backs out, saying that ""This is not right. I'm a married man."" He begins to redress, but then allows himself to be seduced by the coy and understanding hooker.

Zipper is also to be admired for its portrayal of the hookers. We see their professional side -- warm, clever, playful, and understanding to their clients. And we see their candid side -- impoverished, frightened, desperate, and hooked on drugs. We see Sam with a hooker in a glamorous hotel. Then we see her again in her shabby home, after Sam tracks her down. Thus we see both sides of this hooker -- the jaded and carefree woman of the world -- who's only 19 years old -- and the anxious drug addict.

Lena Headey's performance as Jeannie is equally admirable. Headey is best known as Queen Cersei in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Game-of-Thrones/dp/B008CLI4N4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Game of Thrones</a>, and Jeannie share similarities with Cersei. Jeannie is smart -- she out-performed Sam in law school, but quit her legal career to raise a family and pursue their mutual dreams for Sam's brilliant political career. Headey is warm, proud, and supportive in the early scenes. The model wife. Her growing suspicions, followed by her evident pain over Sam's betrayal, wins our sympathies. But then Jeannie turns fierce, calculating, and cold-blooded -- ruthlessly determined to save the political dreams for which she sacrificed her own career.

Headey is known for her skill with accents. She affects a Southern accent in Zipper. It's softer and higher class than her Southern accent in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Laid-to-Rest/dp/B001QMCJ0U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Laid to Rest</a>&nbsp;(in which she played a blue collar Southern woman). It's also a more authentic Southern accent, at least to my ears.

This isn't the first film featuring a Hillary Clinton archetype. Reese Witherspoon's politically ambitious high school student in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Election/dp/B00AEFXUXU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Election</a>&nbsp;also seems inspired by a young Hillary Clinton. Indeed, Hillary's Clinton is a living embodiment of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lady-Macbeth/dp/B018YGWQH6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lady Macbeth</a>&nbsp;archetype -- a calculating, cold-blooded wife who pursues her political ambitions through a weaker husband.

Zipper is a brilliant and timely film. Brilliant because the script avoids the usual clich&eacute;d story arc-- a hero's rise and fall and redemption. Zipper offers no redemption for fallen hero, partially because his wife becomes his enabler. Timely because, well, just look at today's political landscape.",1452643200,,7142,5.626976744186046

7294648,5,B00ZSOWJAM,"Patrick Wilson's tour-de-force !  can't believe that IMDB rated this film a mere 5.7 stars (the film is more like 8.0.)

Zipper (2015) is a film about Sam Ellis (Patrick Wilson), a federal prosecutor on the move to become a future senator.  Sam is married with one son, but his marriage is far from happy.  Actually, it is something of a faade in a world where keeping appearances is more than just a game.  His wife Jeannie is far more interested in getting her husband elected to U.S. Senate than keeping things afresh in their bed-life.  Sam slowly but surely gets pulled into the world of high class escort services, where getting laid can cost you few thousand dollars (think Eliot Spitzer).  He tries to resist the temptation, but the sex-addiction to high-class prostitutes is stronger than his will to succeed in career.  Things get really interesting when his wife pulls him into the political race (think young J.F. Kennedy)...and nothing will stop her at getting what she wants...because according to Sam's wife belief ---the end does justify the means.

The film does a terrific job at portraying white-collar world, which is------ full of hypocrisy, deceit, corruption, where love and self-respect are for sell...for the right price or favor.",1446163200,,1255,4.966507177033493
7294649,3,B00ZSOWJAM,"Mora Stephens' Zipper is inspired by politicians like Bill Clinton and John Edwards,whose careers are highlighted by their involvement in sex scandals. It stars Patrick Wilson and Lena Heady. The screenplay involves a legal prosecutor who is running for office that develops an addiction towards escorts after refusing an affair with a beauteous intern.

Sam Ellis is on the rise as a lawyer. He has developed a great career as a legal prosecutor. He definitely has a bright future if he pursues a political career and runs for public office. After refusing an affair with a beautiful intern,he unfortunately develops an obsessive compulsion towards high-class prostitutes working as escorts. He now finds himself in danger of losing it all after his benefactors call upon him to run as Congressman. After a well-known journalist and his wife discover his addiction,he promises them to keep himself in check only for the viewer to realize in the end that overcoming himself is far from the truth.

No question that the story was predictable and typical of its genre. Added to that,it tried to present many themes instead of trying to focus on a particular message. But what the deficiencies the screenplay it may have was made up by the depth of the characters involved in it. The viewer realize that Sam Ellis' needs aren't met by her wife despite how much she has helped him in his career as a lawyer. We also learn the Sam's wife was once involved in an affair before they were married. The escorts were great people who tried to meet the emotional needs of their customers that was missing from their marriage. Credit should also be given to the performances of the cast particularly Patrick Wilson,Lena Heady and Ray Winstone as Sam,Sam's wife and the journalist respectively. In the end,character depth and the performances were reasons to see this movie despite its screenplay.",1446076800,,1884,4.958860759493671

He portrayed  Viscount Raoul de Chagny in the 2004 film Phantom of the Opera, has an incredible acting range and is a bit under-appreciated. This film was a notch above a Lifetime movie with a lot of skin, not exactly a motion picture, per se'. The supporting cast was also what you would expect in a racy mini-series but just lacked the film panache that I was expecting. In fact, if the story was strong enough to warrant an HBO, Netflix or Amazon mini-series, I think he could carry off a different version of ""House of Cards"". It was worth the rental fee and a day in bed with a hangover and hamburger.",1442793600,4,682,4.286821705426356

I honestly don't understand how others don't see the beauty of this powerfully written, directed and well acted film.  Lena Headey stole the show, but Patrick Wilson gave the performance of his career in, my opinion.  My husband, my friend and I all watched this together and all of us agreed this is a five star.  If you can't handle the truth about life, this is not a film for you.  It's not pretty.  There is a lot of gut wrenching scenes in this movie.  But honestly, I give the writer a lot of credit for being brave enough to show the raw side of what it really means to battle sex addiction and the aftermath when the main character finally hits rock bottom.  The question is will he/can he change?  The question is, does he want to?  Highly recommend.  I would categorize this under Political EroticThrillers.",1442707200,15,974,4.497142857142857
7294663,5,B00ZSOWJAM,"Emily Blunt over at BluntReview (dot) com says: Zipper is brilliant. From the acting, to the storytimely, on point and ultimately one of the scariest films since Leatherface made his visceral introduction. Though, let me be clear, Zipper is not a genre-horror film. It is a superbly played look into Candidate Xand his zipper issues. Yet, really, truly, scrumptiously terrifying.

Ever wonder how exactly an upstanding kinda guy, who preaches about the evils of sex-for-money ultimately becomes a card-carrying member of the Elite Escort Club? Sure ya have. Zipper quietly takes you on the ride. You start in the Tunnel of Love, on to the inevitable Rollercoaster, and Bumper Cars ending in a faux-refreshing (eye-opening stomach-churning) splash of ice-cold filthy water covering your psyche and leaving you in need of a long soothing shower as your canoe hits the plot with a wave of awareness. Zipper is that strong a film.

Of course, the cast helps. And that is to be read as paramount. Come sit a spell with the doe-eyed, sneaky, ruthless, and simply driven with the need for power  a helluvan evenings viewing. Patrick Wilson is stellar. Lena Headley does a wonderful spin on the gotcha. And, Ray Winstone, per usual, leaves you speechless in his slithering capabilities. The emotions, the why, and the simple, Okay, onwardits all shown here  and shown naked.

Caveat? This is not a kids film. Its absolutely for a mature audience; in both subject and the material, underbelly of many concurrently running very real worlds in which people play around in.",1442361600,10,1561,5.034883720930233

Certainly enjoyed the subplot question of why we expect more of our public servants than we do of the average Joe.  Overall, the plot becomes a little predictable at the end, but it is worth the watch... especially if you have ever needed to understand why someone seeks out an affair, including those with paid professionals.",1442016000,4,643,4.827272727272727

8720840,5,B00ZSOWJAM,I loved the movie and consider it as one the best movies that starred Patrick Wilson. He is such a talented actor. It wE a sexy movie but it was artistic too.,1513900800,,158,3.96875
8720841,4,B00ZSOWJAM,"While I was watching Zipper, I found myself seeing this movie as a sequel to the excellent Little Children, also starring Patrick Wilson. In this case, Patrick Wilson's character in Little Children,( a story where he played a Mr. Mom who was screwing his neighbor's wife instead of studying for the Bar examination) FINALLY stops procrastinating and gets his law degree, only to screw up his life again. Well made, fast moving, well casted, and very ADULT (a warning.) It was amazing how just one transgression can balloon into an incredible disaster, kind of like the movie A Simple Plan.. Very entertaining!",1510099200,,609,4.980392156862745
