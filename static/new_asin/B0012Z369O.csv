Only thing I did he didn't appreciate: every time it got good (i.e. Emmanuel taking off her blouse) I would dub/overwrite with Mr Rogers taking off his sweater!!
My brother's birthday coming up so going to send him a ""Hope all is forgiven"" card and this DVD found on Amazon. Going to see if this video editor guy I know can do the same editing job!",1442016000,,500,4.0606060606060606

8248444,3,B0012Z369O,"The movie has a good plot and the acting is good, but when it comes to the hetro-sex scenes, they cut it out and the movie jumps to another scene.  The film shows some lesbian sex, but doesn't show the straight sex and Laura Gemser shows off her beautiful body as she always does in most of her films.  Too many times these directors cut their films (edit out all the real and straight sex) and we the adults who purchase their films are cheated, for we don't get what we deserve.  Especially if you want to add these so called missing films to your collection.  They make decisions for us (that we are not allowed to view the film in its entirety do to real sex- as if not to offend us)  If we don't like films that have real sex scenes, we have the option not to purchase and view such materials, but don't punish the rest of the paying customers who wish to view such things.  So I say save your money for we get cheated!!!",1378080000,,926,4.145251396648045
8248445,3,B0012Z369O,"Emanuelle In Bangkok(no pun intended) was a improvement from the original first ""Emanuelle"" despite not having to do with one another at all. Good Gratuitous sex scenes and ""erotic"" stuff. highly recommend, I saw it on skin-a-max.
2-3 stars. acting not so.",1267920000,2,256,5.119047619047619
