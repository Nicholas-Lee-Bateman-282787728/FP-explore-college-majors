5963666,4,B00F2H6R3K,"NOTE:  I received a free copy of this DVD to review for the web site Metapsychology Online Reviews; please see that site for additional reviews and informaion.

This DVD is the latest partnership from veteran yoga instructor Rodney Yee and lifestyle company Gaiam.  It is unfortunately titled, as Yee has been featured in several prior Gaiam videos with very similar names, including 2011's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Daily-Yoga/dp/B0050W0UTO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Daily Yoga</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-M-Yoga-for-Your-Week/dp/B000YV1L4E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A.M. Yoga for Your Week</a>, released in 2008.  However, despite Gaiam's tendency to re-package workouts, Yoga for Your Week actually contains all-new footage.

Here Yee offers five different routines, which vary from just under 18 minutes to just over 23 minutes in length.  As is typical for him, Yee instructs via voiceover but does not provide mirrored cueing.  He appears alone on a somewhat overcast beach, with the only d&eacute;cor being two large green flags (apparently for shade) in the background.  I have provided times and broken down each practice in greater detail below.

AM CONNECTION (17:25)
This routine focuses mainly on standing postures which gradually build in intensity.  Yee starts standing, moving through large arm circles and then chair pose with arm circles.  A second series flows from wide-legged forward bend to side legged stretch to side squat.  Next, Yee moves from warrior 2 down to the floor for a half seated twist, repeating twice on each side.  The following standing flow starts with side angle pose and moves with Tai Chi arms to warrior 1 on the second side, again repeating twice.  Two more standing sequences follow:  1) triangle to half-moon to candy cane pose, and 2) warrior 1 to warrior 3 to wide-legged series.  Yee concludes with hero's pose, constructive rest, and a brief relaxation before finishing seated.

PM RELEASE (21:45)
After a brief standing warm-up, this practice centers mainly around seated forward bends.  Yee starts standing, moving from a wide-legged forward bend/side leg stretch to a lunge/pyramid sequence.  Coming to seated (facing to the side, so away from the TV, which is awkward), Yee begins a sequence that includes a cross-leg forward bend, cobbler's pose, and staff pose.  He also performs a seated leg extension, then moves into one-legged seated forward bend variations.  The final seated forward bends include double pigeon, cobbler's forward bend, wide-legged forward bend, and full seated forward bend.  Yee finishes with constructive rest, a brief relaxation, and finally concludes seated.  For relaxing PM practices, I much prefer the sequences on another of Yee's recent releases,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yoga-for-Energy-Stress-Relief/dp/B00D2YCLEO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yoga for Energy & Stress Relief</a>.

ENERGY (21:36)
This practice begins with what Yee describes as a core sequence.  This series includes cobbler's, wide-legged seated pose, and staff pose, as well as twists such as simple seated twist, cross-legged twist, and sage 1 twist.  Yee gradually incorporates half- and full-boat, and he ends the sequence with forward bends in cobbler's and wide-legged poses.  Coming through down dog to standing, Yee moves through modified sun salutations, including ""little hops.""  He uses a full sun salutation A to move into three-legged dog pose and right into pigeon, holding this posture only briefly before transitioning to a one-legged side stretch, performing this pose twice on either side.  Yee concludes this routine with cobbler's pose, wide-legged seated forward bend, and a short seated meditation.  As with the other practices, there is a very brief savasana before finishing in a seated position.

STRENGTH (22:40)
This practice centers mainly around backbends.  Yee begins standing for a flowing chair sequence; from here, he adds in some mild standing backbends such as crescent lunge and warrior 1.  Transitioning to face-down on the floor, he comes into portrait pose (hands under chin) with leg lifts and then moves through locust, cobra, and camel.  After another transition through down dog, he performs several repetitions of plank pose and two repetitions of bow pose.  Next, he comes to the back, building to upward bow pose.  The final seated postures are cobbler's and a seated twist, and then Yee finishes with reclined knees-to-chest, a brief relaxation, and seated Namaste.

FLEXIBILITY (23:21)
This routine opens seated for an approximately 7.5-minute core-focused sequence.  (Those familiar with Yee's Yoga: Core Cross Train will recognize many of these exercises.)  The series involves a flow between cobbler's pose, wide-legged seated pose, and happy babies pose.  Coming to a squatting position, Yee performs arm balance prep work, gradually placing weight on the hands.  After standing to perform tree and Shiva's poses, Yee returns to a squat for full crow pose.  This is followed by standing half-lotus and single leg extension, then Yee returns to a squatting position for side crow.  He concludes this practice with cobbler's pose, a lying arm/leg release, and a brief relaxation, finishing in a seated position.

Yee, who was originally Iyengar-trained but who has developed his own unique combination of alignment and flow over the years, offers some truly masterful sequencing on this DVD.  I have never seen such unique transitions (e.g., warrior to seated twist, pigeon to side stretch) and I would have relished in these routines--except that Yee sets a pace which feels rather rushed, failing to allow time to settle into the postures.  (This was particularly evident in savasana:  Yee cues one to relax/scan the body, and in the very next breath, he is already coming back to seated.)  Furthermore, the titles of the practices do not seem to have a specific connection to the actual routines--i.e., ""Strength,"" which was full of backbends, felt more like an energy-based practice, whereas ""Flexibility,"" with its work on arm balances, seemed more like strength work.

Yee himself appears pleased with this DVD--in every routine, he practices with a joyful expression on his face.  I highly respect Yee as an instructor, and although he offers some elements of interest here, based on his prior work, I know that he can do even better.",1391040000,57,6511,5.648148148148148
5963667,5,B00F2H6R3K,"Once again Rodney doesn't disappoint. I did the A.M workout this morning, it was a very nice flow series and it got me a little sweaty. Just the right length to squeeze in before jumping in the shower. As usual, there were a couple of awkward moments as with any workout you have not done before such as nearly tipping over when moving to the next pose but midway through, I had it down!",1389052800,2,387,4.243243243243243

Rodney Yee workouts on VCR tapes, but the problem I had with them is that he moved through the workouts way too fast. This DVD is different.

Here is a beautiful spot on earth and it is so grey and uninviting, I have tried all of the sessions, some are too difficult for me, but that is not my concern; it is more that Yee doesn't seem that interested either... he is going through the motions quickly, passion seems very low.
I have gone back to earlier videos where he seems more fully present, the nature he is in in more inviting, and the music much more resonant with yoga.",1486166400,,541,4.242718446601942

So, when I went to started doing the workouts on this DVD, I was a bit flustered at the speed and the unfamiliar poses in these workouts. Rodney speaks very fast and does not provide the instruction that he did in the Beginner DVD.

I might try another DVD in the interim to help familiarize myself with some new poses at an appropriate (slower) pace.

This was not what I was looking for at the moment.",1476230400,6,555,4.276190476190476

5963715,4,B00F2H6R3K,"I can never devote a ton of time to exercise. There aren't enough hours in the day! That's why I really like these yoga videos. They are not too short, not too long and I like that there are different practices on each video to focus on specific areas so you get the most out of each 20 minute session. Plus, it helps to mix things up so they don't get too repetitive or boring. I have 2 other Rodney Yee videos (for beginners) and was interested in getting another one to try something new! This one had everything I wanted, 5 different practices, all of which are roughly 20 minutes long (sometimes they tend to go over by a couple of minutes). The pose transitions in this video seem to focus a little more on fluidity and constant motion than my other Gaiam videos, which I really liked. However, some of the poses in this video are a little more advanced than I'm used to. I realize that this is not labeled a beginners video and that ""practice makes perfect"". I just wasn't expecting it, so it came as a surprise! I hope to eventually master some of them.",1458691200,14,1061,4.31

I do not work out a lot and I never even broke a sweat with any of the sequences.  Might be a good introductory DVD, but you'll probably get bored quickly if you stick with it.  I do love Rodney Yee, he is very grounding and calm and easy to listen to.  Sometimes I had to watch the DVD then rewind because the narration and the action were happening at the same time.

I've been practicing yoga on and of (sometimes more on than others, sometimes a bit more off) for 10+ years, almost always at home. I don't usually feel comfortable enough with my skill to attend a public class, because I find it more relaxing to exercise in private. I usually like Rodney Yee's tapes, and this one is no exception. The workouts are varied, and targeted specifically for whatever goal you may have in your day's practice. Each has its own focus, but they also pair together well if you feel the need for a longer workout. Half an hour is usually my norm, so when I use this DVD I like to do two at a time (ex: Energy and Strength, or AM and Enery, etc.). The Strength portion includes some rather challenging backbend poses, including one of my favorites (which you don't find that often), the Camel's pose. Rodney Yee is a very accomplished instructor, and his voice is very soothing and encouraging. The only thing I would criticize about this DVD (and it's very minor, and didn't really detract from it in any significant way) is that sometimes the narration cuing didn't quite keep up with his movements. Again, this wasn't a big deal, and it was still easy enough to follow along.

I recommend this tape for anyone who is already at a beginner level with some exposure, but ready to challenge themselves a bit.",1442188800,2,1436,4.587548638132295
5963731,5,B00F2H6R3K,I good addition to my Rodney Yee collection. Has some interesting new routines that are fairly challenging - not for beginners.,1439337600,,127,5.095238095238095
5963732,4,B00F2H6R3K,"I  love this dvd. I have been doing some yoga here and there for a few months now. Some of it isn't challenging and it's always the same stuff between dvds. But Rodney Yee steps it up. In 20min you get a good yoga stretch and work out in. Some of the moves are challenging for a beginner such as myself who isn't as flexible as I should be with 4 months of Yoga under my belt lol. I had some struggle but kept with it because eventually I will have to learn to do these moves,right? Why avoid something that eventually I will have to start from  square one with anyways in the future. I promise you,if you just stick with Rodney and his Yoga Poses that it really pays. During the actual Yoga session I felt no pain or discomfort just a small balance issue or can't reach as far which is normal as a beginner. BUT next day I felt some of my muscles a little sore and proved that Rodney is my new favorite. Keep with it,my friends.",1436140800,4,929,4.0989010989010985

The only complaint I have is that I don't think the names on the main menu match up to the actual practices. Flexibility seems a lot like strength to me. Other than that it is great!

This one has a nice flow...it's calming, but it's challenging. It really challenges my flexibility. I am starting to enjoy yoga more because of this DVD. It is not boring because I can actually feel my body relaxing and evening getting stronger. No other yoga DVD did that for me. I'm not a graceful person, but it makes me feel like one. I'm still going to do my cardio and strength, but I'd love to start adding yoga more to my routine. I honestly do not think this is for beginners, as you need a good amount of flexibility, but I guess you could modify to work up to the full poses.",1429574400,,731,4.304347826086956

5963749,2,B00F2H6R3K,"I don't recommend this DVD unless you like doing similar poses for 15 minutes at a time.  I have used A.M. and P.M. Yoga for years and workouts are short but have a good combination of floor, lying, twisting and stretching poses.  I dislike the organization of Yoga for Your Week, because you don't know before you buy it, that each workout concentrates on one type of move: standing poses, twists, backbends, forward bends and hip openers.  This, to me, is not balanced within each workout.  Also, more effort needs to be put into the background music, which is new age flute music over and over.  The Glen Canyon setting is stupendous and photography good, but both the workouts and the music are too repetitive.  I wish there could be more chanting monks or Indian (from India) music--something that is varied and exotic.",1411171200,10,824,4.7272727272727275

5963751,2,B00F2H6R3K,"Usually I love Rodney Lee videos.  I don't know if this was rated as a beginners, but in my opinion, it is NOT meant for beginners.  It had too many poses that were like crow (which I can barely do).  There is also a pose where you're in a squat and put both arms to one side and try to raise your legs in the air ""any amount.""  Way too hard for me.  I will probably end up putting this in the Salvation Army box.  Hate to give a so-so review on anything from Rodney, but I wouldn't recommend for a beginner or older person (50+).",1408492800,7,530,3.952830188679245
5963752,4,B00F2H6R3K,"My only other experience with yoga was 15-minute results yoga. Even though these workouts are only 5 minutes more, they are definitely more intense. Some of the poses are still a challenge after several weeks. Working towards being able to do them is keeping me motivated. Although I only planned on doing 4 a week, I usually do the fifth one because I enjoy the stretching so much. I am happy with this purchase.",1406764800,4,413,4.594594594594595
5963753,5,B00F2H6R3K,"This DVD is by far one of Rodney's best in recent years. His style remains the same - which I why I'm such a fan of his, but he switches it up for this one. ""New"" poses and transitions that aren't on his previous videos. In my opinion, it's more on the intermediate level, but a fantastic step for beginners to transition. They are all great sessions for anytime of the day.
I've been an avid practitioner of Rodney Yee's yoga for 10 years. His style and instruction is graceful, calming, and incredibly easy to follow. He doesn't over-explain, like a lot of instructors do, somehow, without the need to look at the screen frequently throughout the session. I have many of his DVDs, and I enjoy every one of them, even the beginners' practice, although my skill level is much higher.",1405987200,29,783,4.52112676056338

5963757,5,B00F2H6R3K,"I have to admit, I love Rodney Yee and rarely use any of my other DVDS for yoga, though I have many. This is one of my favorites, after the power yoga series (stamina is my favorite of that one). This yoga is slower than the power yoga, which sometimes is what I am looking for, rather than the fast pace of the power yoga workouts, which is what I want on some days. These are short workouts, around 20 minutes each, and I often combine two practices for a longer workout. It you are in a time pinch, as so many of us are, you can do one quick workout too. Although I find the labels of the workouts mismatched (The ""Energy"" workout seems more like a flexibility workout to me  and the ""flexibility"" workout seemed more like a balance and strength workout to me) that isn't really all that important.  I have about 8 of Rodney's yoga dvds and this is one of my favorites. Most of the poses are attainable for beginners - though I'm not good at balance poses (even after years of doing yoga) I think with a few exceptions, most poses can be done by a beginner. One of the reasons I love Rodney's dvds is his soft, soothing voice and he sticks to the yoga workout in his dialogue, which I love. No fluffy, new age talk. I highly recommend this dvd to anyone looking for a slower pace, fundamental yoga workout.",1403481600,53,1309,4.253012048192771
5963758,4,B00F2H6R3K,"I'm a little tired of yoga videos that are broken up into 20 minute segments. Why can't they just run for 90 minutes like a yoga class? This video is okay, but not as good as Yee is capable of producing. There are some challenging moves, but the second time through the video they didn't seem that much of a big deal. No modifications are shown. The moves come in rapid succession, so I'd say this video is best for intermediate practitioners. Also, there are these strange pieces of cloth stretched between two poles stuck in the sand on the beach. They sit right behind Yee and block the view of the ocean. They look like the green screens behind batters at home plate in a baseball game. Weird.",1398211200,3,697,4.410852713178294

As with anything, there are plenty of moves I cannot do yet and others I can onlt sort of do. Even still I love Rodneys approach to the routines and will keep at it to get better.

Overall, I really love that this is broken down into 5 different 20 minute routines. Each have their own benefits and based on the descriptions and your mood, etc you can pick which works best for you.

8611697,2,B00F2H6R3K,"I love Rodney Yee so I was pretty excited to get 5 short (20 min) yoga routines for such a great price. Once I started actually doing these routines I found they were not what I was looking for. They are very quick flow routines, with absolutely no modifications. They also do not use traditional yoga poses. I did 3 of them and there were no downward dogs or child's poses. More of a Tai Chi combo then actual yoga. I found that I could not keep up (example, the flexibility segment has you twist from a squat and do a twisting handstand. What???) so unfortunately I am returning this and will begin my search again.",1521417600,,617,4.327586206896552

I used to do Rodney Yee's Yoga for Athletes a few years ago and I loved it!  I seem to have lost it so bought this one to try.  This flows much faster and the poses are not held as long.  The poses are more advanced - but I do what I can and will just keep tackling the ones that are more difficult. I have already seen progress after doing the Morning session only for 2 weeks now!,1508716800,2,540,3.828828828828829
