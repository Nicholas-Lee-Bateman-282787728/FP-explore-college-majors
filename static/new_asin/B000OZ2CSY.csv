2806400,5,B000OZ2CSY,"I first found this series on Netflix and enjoyed it so much that I bought a copy for my father who no longer gets to boat our waterways the way he used to.  Jason Robards does a great job narrating, and the shows don't really feel dated.  This is armchair travel at its finest if you've got any interest in life along U.S. waterways, including the Gulf Coast, East Coast, Great Lakes, Mississippi River, Ohio River, etc.  (I don't remember it covering the West Coast.)  You get introduced to lots of great small towns and interesting characters.  I've never had any interest whatsoever in visiting the Hudson River Valley, but after watching that segment, it's now on the top of my places to see.  Enjoy!",1340236800,,704,4.592
2806401,5,B000OZ2CSY,I was delighted to find this old series and made it a gift to a good friend. He was delighted and thoroughly  enjoyed it.,1338681600,,121,4.041666666666667
2806402,3,B000OZ2CSY,"This set is everything the others have said about it, well photographed, well edited, well narrated, etc., so rather than go over the good parts again, here is what I don't like about the set:

Order.  Instead of starting at one point (say New England) and making a loop around the area to be covered, the chapters seem randomly placed on the discs.  That is to say, if you want to watch a given area (say the US East Coast), you have to keep changing discs.

Intros:  The same intro appears in each chapter.  The explanation of the reason for the project, the selection of crew, etc. Same for the ending and credits.  Once is enough.  I made good use of the fast forward button.

Agenda:  I am a boater so I bought the set to watch the boating and cruising. Much of the series focuses on complaints about development and individuals who have political agendas.  And subjects not related to cruising or boating.

It's worth the price and I've watched most of it (what I didn't skip over), but unlike my other waterway DVDs, I doubt I will watch it more than once.",1318032000,2,1063,4.422680412371134
2806403,5,B000OZ2CSY,"I enjoyed this 13 hour PBS series so much that after checking it out at my public library, I had to order my own set.  Plus I ordered a set for my 88 year old parents who now sing its praises. I told them I was sending them ""on a cruise""-- Sure beats watching the usual TV garbage.  It is beautifully stimulating and educational.  Although it was filmed in the early '90's, it remains pertinent with its issues of pollution along our rivers, lakes and coastal waters. I think it took them 3 years of filming to travel thousands of miles on the Great Lakes, the Mississippi, the Hudson River and Erie Canal, the Ohio, the North Atlantic, the Gulf Coast et al.  Nice that it is in 1 hour programs.  You can watch as little or as much as you want, and replay just your favorite segments.",1253836800,4,784,4.27027027027027
2806404,5,B000OZ2CSY,"I loved watching this PBS series in the early nineties. The concept of floating through America's waterways and documenting the people along the way was so unique. I credit this series with sparking my interests in documentary film making and recreational boating.

During its run on PBS I'd probably seen every episode at least half a dozen times. I never tired of it. So here it is nearly 20 years later and I'm watching the episodes again. Despite my initial fear the episodes wouldn't be as good as I remember, I was amazed to realize they're actually better than I remember. It's such a solid, well paced, visually attractive documentary series.",1238284800,2,650,4.8558558558558556
2806405,3,B000OZ2CSY,"I watched this series when it first aired on PBS (in the late 1980's I believe) and loved it.  It was a truly interesting documentary, telling the story of Americans (and a few Canadians!) who live and work on the rivers and the Atlantic coast.

It is an unhurried, relaxing tour of the eastern seaboard, gulf coast and Missipssipi waterways. Watching it again in 2008 shows just how much documentaries have improved over the years. ""Waterways"" now is pretty slow in comparison. I think the major difference between watching the stories then and now is that many of the people they interview have quite predictable lives now...whereas in the 80's their lives were completely new to me. Now I have seen several seasons of documentaries on fishermen, and the people on ""Waterways"" don't have the hair-raising adventures we are used to in such a documentary.

I still enjoy watching it, but I can only watch the 13 hour series 1 hour a week(I get a little anxious for the hour to end, as the story seems to move a little slowly).",1201305600,2,1026,4.657458563535911
2806406,5,B000OZ2CSY,"This is a wonderful set to own and watch. When it originally aired on PBS, we enjoyed watching it so much. I had taped it back then but the video quality wasn't very good. When I found it on Amazon, I was thrilled. You'll learn a lot as well as be entertained. It's something that can be watched over & over again.",1193270400,,314,4.080645161290323
2806407,5,B000OZ2CSY,"""On the Waterways"" is a beautifully photographed series.  It is also a journey into the realm of small, human stories.  The filmmakers were young and took the time to talk to the people who lived along the shores of the places they visited.  The stories they tell and the way they are told are not flashy.  All of the episodes move along at a brisk pace, but at the same time it feels as though time has slowed down long enough for the viewer to enjoy the ride.  This series is almost twenty years old, so there are probably a lot of things that have changed.  However, this does not change the charm and the beauty of the scenes.  It's a bit like looking at old photographs of a favorite vacation.",1188604800,6,698,4.282442748091603
2806408,5,B000OZ2CSY,This is a excellent history documentary tool of the former view of the coastal waterways before several global warming and other man-made changes. The college students talk with coastal natives of the area that give the history of how life was before so many climatic and economic changes. A must have dvd for a historian.,1186444800,,322,4.872727272727273

2806420,5,B000OZ2CSY,I saw most of the  programs when they first came out.  I delayed buying then and have tried for years to get the whole series.  It is great to be able to watch the whole series in order.,1395705600,,186,3.8421052631578947
2806421,5,B000OZ2CSY,"Great series to watch. A little dated at this point, but still very well done. Too bad it did not receive national coverage.",1389312000,,124,4.434782608695652
2806422,5,B000OZ2CSY,"It captures the changing culture of that section of American life.
Also, I had the amazing fellow that was the inspiration for the project in my jr. high classroom in Ft. Wayne, IN. He was the most creative student I encountered in 25 years of teaching in Lutheran schools.",1385078400,,273,4.591836734693878
2806423,5,B000OZ2CSY,Great series. I'd love to take a trip like this! Jason Robards did a great job showing us parts of the country we may never see otherwise.,1384560000,,138,4.148148148148148
2806424,3,B000OZ2CSY,This is a great partial recap of the voyage made on the boat Driftwood. I don't understand why the documentary skipped such large sections of their journey in the documentary. It is as though the focus was on those who paid to be included.,1373328000,2,239,4.454545454545454
2806425,3,B000OZ2CSY,I thoroughly enjoyed watching these videos but between the video quality from the 80's and the definite 80's style of everyone involved it's hard to forget these vids are over 20years old.  Still enjoyable though!,1372809600,2,213,5.085714285714285
2806426,5,B000OZ2CSY,"saw this show on TV, didn't have a chance to record series, found it online, now I can enjoy this anytime",1359676800,,105,4.0476190476190474
2806427,5,B000OZ2CSY,"Great series provides insight to history of the waterways that helped build the United States, many of the places are unknown to people who grew up in the Western United States such as myself so it was a fresh insight. Although the documentary does seem slow in places.",1349913600,,269,4.625
2806428,5,B000OZ2CSY,"Great PBS Series done with heart. Jason Robards and the college interns do a great job of telling the mostly untold stories of people and towns along their 25,000 mile journey on the waterways that made America great. The series is over 20 years old and provides an interesting look into the recent past. It's a nice mix of geography, history and nature that might even suggest future vacation opportunities for the adventurous.",1346716800,,428,4.876712328767123
8187793,5,B000OZ2CSY,"I like to kayak in populated areas seeing communities from the back side like traveling by train.  I love that it respects the local people, environment, water quality, and history.  Immerses the viewer in the waterway.",1516060800,,219,5.055555555555555
8187794,5,B000OZ2CSY,Recorded off TV in the 90's onto VHS. I have been looking for the DVD for years. Great story of our waterways east of the Mississippi.,1514246400,,134,4.1923076923076925

8187801,5,B000OZ2CSY,This was originally a PBS series narrated by Jason Robards. As the title indicates it takes place on the interior waterways of Canada and the USA... from the head of the St Lawrence Seaway in Canada to the Gulf of Mexico and Texas. I loved the series on PBS and loved having the opportunity to watch it again.,1419724800,,309,4.344827586206897
8187802,5,B000OZ2CSY,"We saw this years ago when living in Vermont and fell in love with the series. Now 13 years later it's still as enjoyable to watch as it was then. If you want to get a fell for the places and people who live along our countries waterways, this is the DVD for you.",1418083200,,263,3.888888888888889
