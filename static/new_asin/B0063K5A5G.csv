After waiting patiently for it to arrive, I was positively thrilled to watch it.  Not only does it feature all of the weekly videos from 2010, but they also took the opportunity to interview different individuals that make Truck Night what it is: Gary Bauer, Phil the Barber, etc.  Also, they took the opportunity to interview some Truck Night regulars about both themselves and the trucks that they've created: Scott Krznar and the Mud Slut, Josh Foster and the Floored Whore, Ronnie Boyd and the Monster Masher, etc.  They even interviewed Matt Steele from Trucks Gone Wild and Anthony Pererra from Mud Life Magazine. I highly recommend this DVD for anyone that might be in to mud bogging, but has never heard of Yankee Lake (not sure how, though).",1321228800,,896,4.7243589743589745

Its one part documentary movie and one part action highlights, all Yankee Rebels.  I hope they come out with a nother DVD soon and I can't wait to check out Truck Night next season.  What a place!!!

If you like mudding, trucks and rednecks then you've got to check this out.  Watch the lil trailer below that is from their website.",1321228800,,785,7.582417582417582
