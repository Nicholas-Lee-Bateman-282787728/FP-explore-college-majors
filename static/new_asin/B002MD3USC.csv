3952192,1,B002MD3USC,"Oh man this movie is awful. The acting is terrible and the movie just plain sucks. I couldn't even finish it it was so bad. For those of you wanting to watch it because Robert Pattinson is in it, I'm telling you now to not bother wasting your time. His character is not at all attractive in this film, and his acting skills are even worse than they are in Twilight. Save yourself two hours and do something productive with your life.",1258934400,4,433,4.2926829268292686
3952193,5,B002MD3USC,"I saw the movie once on the big screen and twice on pay per view. I liked it a lot. Art is like a Jolly green giant who doesn't fit in anywhere. But only when he does his music which I hope gets explored more in the next film: (Art grows up?) I'm hoping they make a part two of what happens to Art and if he finds success and can he find a fringe success. The other kooky characters:  Arts friends: the shut in Nikki)and the sex pert! I feel like them( minus the gas, glue, coke and sex) when you want to know whats going on right across the street but are too afraid to go out.
I understood this movie and appreciated the realness and crispness shown. Hunee B",1257984000,10,660,4.0
3952194,5,B002MD3USC,"I think this is a solid film for what it is. It's an indie film and while it may have an editing mistake or two, the script is near perfect.  Brilliant and hilarious, it also hits a heartfelt note at the turning point of the movie where Art (Pattinson) hits his breaking point. The director has said several times that the idea of it was how interesting it would be to bring this American ""self-help"" culture to Britain.  And the outcome is this witty, cute film. It is a character driven film, and with that said I think all the actors were perfect for their roles (even though the mom came on a bit strong, Rebecca Pidgeon is a great actress, and I loved the constant line of ""I wonder about you sometimes..."") and all gave very sincere performances. People will say this film only gets seen because of Pattinson, but the truth is even though he does a great job in it (he appears to be very comfortable in ""normal"" roles and I would say he should do more comedy), the actors who play his friends are highly underrated. I think they're absolutely hilarious and I think their characters actually steal the spotlight from Art many times. That's because Art's character is actually ignored a bit by his friends, who treat and speak to him in quite a patronizing manner most of the time. They really are not good friends at all. They all have their individual problems, but it's funny that they treat him the way they do because one could say that they actually have bigger problems than Art. Art is the sometimes whiney, sensitive attention-seeker who is insensitive or unaware of his actions around people. He's not supposed to be a likable character! He has issues and this is his story of trying to figure out those issues and come to terms with his life... realizing he doesn't have to figure everything out and life will not be perfect. His friend Nikki pretty much only talks about women and how to supposedly get them (hilarious).  The other friend, Ronnie, is an agoraphobic computer nerd who also has clean freak OCD tendencies, and is also quite whiney. The pub scene is one of my favorites because you see that even though the friends are somewhat indifferent to each other, they are starting to come together because of their common bond (their sad attempt at music-haha) but there are so many ridiculous(ly good:) scenes and things that happen in this film - and so many funny lines! Like someone else said, if you don't get this kind of dry humor, you won't like it.",1256428800,18,2479,4.553811659192825
3952195,5,B002MD3USC,"I watch this movie ON DEMAND as one of those ""watch it the day it's released in theatres"" sort of thing. Basically, I wanted to see Robert in a role that wasn't vampire or wizard related. The Twilight buzz has officially worn off and I was really just over the whole R-Pattz & K-Stew phase. This movie was hilarious! I am not a British Comedy fan by any means either. It was just plain fun. Parts were so quirky and weird and uneasy, but so believable and relatable. Robert was sensational. It was nice to see that he really can act outside the hype of his other movies. This movie is a must see for everyone.",1255564800,38,609,4.258620689655173
3952196,2,B002MD3USC,As much of a R-Pattz fan as I am i had to make a decision on this film or the new ROBSESSED feature length documentary that is being released on 11/10. Unfortunately I have seen How To Be. I cant hate on anything Robert Pattinson but I have to say that its not that great! I have pre-ordered the ROBSESSED DVD. I cant wait to get it!!!,1254182400,5,335,4.014925373134329
3952197,4,B002MD3USC,"This is a funny film, the humor can be awkward and uncomfortable but in a charming way.  This is a good movie if you can appreciate this kind of humor.

3952205,3,B002MD3USC,"I would say that Robert Pattinson and his co-stars did a good job at their character portrayals and storyline, but as a movie lover, I wouldn't suggest this film, unless you're apart of the Pattinson fandom, and want to add this to your collection. That being said, it will showcase his acting and singer/songwriting abilities.",1395964800,,327,4.963636363636364

3952207,4,B002MD3USC,"I don't know how Robert Pattinson manages to be in so many strange movies, but he does.  Actually, I kind of liked this, but it is not a main-stream kind of movie.  Performances were all good, Music was OK.  Story weird.",1389744000,,220,4.317073170731708
3952208,4,B002MD3USC,"Although I would never sit to watch any of the Twilight films, How to Be starring Robert Pattinson shows his different shades in his acting skills. I may say this film is a bit unconventional because it's not a comedy-romantic film or drama; however, it explores depression, hope, and moving forward in life.

The film is about Arthur (Pattinson), a college graduate that works at a supermarket, but he's depressed, musically frustrated and his girlfriend dumps him. In his effort to solve his own issues, he makes a bold decision. He hires a life coach that is somewhat sweet, but also odd (well like most characters in this movie). In his journey of self-recovery, the audience also meets his cold parents and his socially awkard friends in the mix which makes this film a unique charm.",1387670400,3,788,4.794117647058823

3952213,5,B002MD3USC,I was so surprise at how funny and engaging this movie was.  I just wanted to see Mr. Pattinson's earlier work.  This movie made you laugh and cry and laugh some more.  Funny to see such a classy man be stumbling and clumsy and funny.  I just loved the contrast and loved this movie. Very little profanity which I love.,1365206400,,319,4.266666666666667
3952214,5,B002MD3USC,"The whole cast is weirdly hilarious if you like this type of humor. You will like it if you have ever been depressed and all mixed up.

3952223,5,B002MD3USC,"Great Movie!, fast shipping and highly recommend this movie if you like dramas, and kind of awkward movies. It is great for family viewings, but more for teens and adults (My opinion).",1336262400,,184,4.78125
3952224,4,B002MD3USC,"Ok I have to admit to being a Twilight fan - but more so a Rob Pattinson fan.  TBH, the movies I loved him most in were *Remember Me* & *Water for Elephants* - I basically enjoy watching him in any role.  He is a terrific actor.

This movie is awkward in and of itself.  If it had starred any other actor, I think this would have been a bottom bin flick hardly ever watched, but because of Pattinson, it is finding somewhat of a cult following.  I didn't find it *hilarious* and only grinned at a few scenes - maybe I missed alot of the dry wry humor - but I did go away feeling weirdly at peace by the end of it.

It is slow paced and deals with human relations and social ineptitude, and somehow managed to be endearing despite its flaws.  Not for everyone, but just try to go into it with an open mind.",1330992000,,805,4.0251572327044025
3952225,5,B002MD3USC,"Good from beginning to end. Robert Pattinson plays depressed Art (Arthur) very well. Only had to turn on subtitles during the bar/pub scene.

3952227,4,B002MD3USC,"You have to be of a certain frame of mind to appreciate this quirky film, I think. I watched it purely to see how Robert Pattinson would do with a different kind of character. My heart really went out to Art, the wandering young man who got absolutely NO love or encouragement from his parents. I have to say Pattinson did a terrific job making the character empathetic, and despite Art's self-destructive tendencies, I don't know how you can watch this film without hoping he rises above his circumstances. Well done.",1301702400,,518,4.7032967032967035
3952228,5,B002MD3USC,"I will admit that I had never heard of this movie until a few months ago and was drawn to buying it because I am a Robert Pattinson fan. I was curious about the movie and heard good things about it. Needless to say I was pleasantly surprised.

This movie tells the story of Art, an average guy trying to find his way in life. He is forced to move back with his parents after a breakup with his girlfriend. Art's struggle to find meaning in his life leads to him using his inheritance to hire a self help guru to help him find his way. This leads to many hysterical scenes that show Rob's true versatility as an actor.

Rob's role as Art truly is a completely different from anything I had seen him in before and I was thoroughly pleased with his ability to pull off this character. I would recommend this film whole heartedly.",1300665600,,826,4.254777070063694

3952230,5,B002MD3USC,I LOVE this movie and thought Rob was so good in it! I think you have to have a weird sense of humor to get a lot of the jokes....which I know I do :) I just loved this movie so much! Hope people give it a chance!,1296777600,,213,3.4583333333333335
3952231,5,B002MD3USC,"This is film is very humorous. The actors all play very quirky characters, including Robert Pattinson's character,Art, a very awkward, confused college graduate who works in a grocery and tries to get gigs playing and singing (he really knows how to play the guitar and sings so well it breaks my heart) but in the movie he has to try to be not very good, and thats pretty hard to do if you're really well versed at something. If you find it difficult to understand the ""Queen's English"", just watch it several times like I did.  Of course Robert Pattinson is so good at playing this character ""Art"", and he interacts with his family and friends in this ""no one understands me"" way, that you have to adore his attempts. He does find someone to help him, but I will leave that to you, to find out.  Buy this, it's great!",1295395200,,819,4.417218543046357

3952233,5,B002MD3USC,"Astonishingly, I loved this film. Rob Pattinson has many layers. It's a surprise whenever I encounter new work of his. In this film, he is outrageously funny, endearing, and less confused than all the other characters, including his therapist. I laughed out loud a LOT. Rob P. is truly the Cary Grant of a generation, but more important, he is the consumate artist by whom others will be judged.",1281139200,9,395,4.739130434782608
3952234,5,B002MD3USC,"This movie is hilarious. Super dry humor. Robert Pattinson plays pathetic to comedic perfection. This may not be for everyone. But if you have a dark depressed side that you indulged in during your 20s and somehow are now on the other side of, you may just find this film really really funny. If you take yourself too seriously, or insist on being artificially happy all the time... well, go watch a Disney film or something.",1280448000,7,425,4.605263157894737

3952236,2,B002MD3USC,"I guess I am not a fan of British humor. I watched this movie in full but contemplated turning it off multiple times. Honestly, I watched it to see other films from Robert Pattinson.  I am a Twilight fan.  I found a lot of the quirkiness of ""Art"" to mimic things that the ""Edward Cullen"" character portrays.  I found this unsettling.  I did not want to see the Cullen character in Art.  I came away from this movie deciding that I was not seeing ""Art"" and ""Edward"" but possibly I was seeing the quirkiness of Rob.  Anyone that is a Pattinson fan will probably love this film.  He is in all the scenes and does a great job in his character.  I just didn't find this film funny and did not enjoy it.  I much preferred ""Little Ashes"".  If you are old enough to see that one it's a better portrait of Pattinson's abilities to take on a character besides a nerd like Art, Edward and Rob himself.",1278374400,,890,4.244047619047619
3952237,5,B002MD3USC,"""How to Be"" is a funny and at times tragic coming of age story. Art, a twenty something bum with loser friends, is trying to understand why his girlfriend left him and why nothing in his life really works out. To do this, he hires a self-help guru to come live with him in his parents house.

Beneath the obvious story of sad boy finds hope and courage inside himself, ther is a deeper more interesting story. Why do we do the things we do? Is it all a result of how we are raised? What if those who raised us never really cared for us?

Though I enjoy the moments that Art has with his family and Levi Ellington (the guru), the best parts occur when he is with his friends. What a motley crew! Art has two best friends that show up throughout the movie, Nicky Fierce and Ronny. Nicky was a loser kid in high school who completely changed his life in order to persue the only thing that matters to him, ""wimmen"". Some of the funniest parts in the movie are thanks to Nicky Fierce. Ronny is a sad case. An obvious agoraphobic, Ronny avoid leaving the flat his father pays for and perfers to stay at home making his music. That music being an dittys plaid on electronic keyboard. Ronny acts like his life is swell, but there are moments where the cracks show and it becomes clear how unhappy he is.

Altogether, this is one of my favorite movies. Art is funny and sweet and his situation is very relateable. See it, not because it features Robert Pattinson but because it's just a good movie.",1277683200,4,1490,4.295373665480427

My 12 year old niece watched it with me and she LOVED IT...We both laughed thru out the film & almost cried when Arthur/Robert looked like he was having a nervous breakdown.

The cast is delightful, particularly Rebecca Pidgeon as Pattison's distant mother. Pattison himself was funny and heartwernching at the same time. It was almost painful to watch him blunder through a failed relationship, friends who attempt to be helpful, a crazy self-help guru for hire and an awkward attempt to find out just who he is.

You really need to understand how does his character feel then you understand how amazing the story is. I think a lot of people thought that Rob can't act he just the pretty face but you will be definately surprise how he carried his character amazingly as Art in here. I enjoyed the movie very much and all the special features in it. It's worth buying not only because has Rob in it but because you could see and feel how multi talented he is as an actor of his generation.

3952251,2,B002MD3USC,"Although Robert Pattinson is young and virtually untrained as a thespian, he gives a heartfelt performance of a young man trying in vain to interest his disinterested parents, friends and girlfriend to take him seriously. He has no direction in life and desparately wants a close family life and to be an entertainer although he has no real talent (that hasn't stopped many young stars today)and strives to improve himself through a self help book and tutor.
For what it's worth, I think Pattinson is very watchable whether playing a vampire, an anguished artist or a misunderstood young man.",1267315200,8,592,4.98989898989899
3952252,5,B002MD3USC,"This is everything you would expect from a British indie. It is funny, quirky, sweet and all the characters shine. Robert Pattinson is absolutely adorable as his character Art. He is completely believable in his role and that comes across as perfectly endearing. I loved this film!",1265932800,2,281,5.0
3952253,5,B002MD3USC,"I laughed out loud the first time I watched it...
the behind the scenes are really funny especially the director Oliver's
friends who are all part of the movie production.
Robert Pattinson makes it work though he seems not to know what the movies
about...he stays focused and he's very young able to bring his musical talent to this even
if he needs to play badly, he pulled it off.",1265760000,,382,4.4714285714285715
3952254,4,B002MD3USC,"Just when you though Robert Pattinson could only play a vampire, comes a really cute comedy he made right before Twilight.  Robert plays a very quirkey character that is having a ""quarter-life"" crisis.  Bored with life, girlfriend, job he sets out to find out who he really is and what he really wants to do with his life.  Non-supportive parents play a factor in this too.  Very well acted on Robert's part...he is totally believable.
If you like this, you should try to find an earlier piece he did for ITV (the broadcast channel for England)-it was called ""Bad Mother's Handbook"".  I don't believe it is for sale in the USA but you can watch it online.  If you thought he looked different in How To Be, what until you see him in this.",1265760000,4,737,4.462686567164179
3952255,5,B002MD3USC,"I will admit I was skeptical about buying this DVD.  However, I love Robert Pattinson, and having seen the Haunted Airman, The Bad Mother's Handbook, and The Goblet of Fire, (in which he was great) I wanted to give it a shot.  It was refreshing to see him perform outside of the Twilight genre.  He's very talented and I was impressed with his performance.  However, I know it will be difficult for some people to see this as it is a British film, and they are quite different from what Americans are used to.  I would highly recommend it to anyone.

I intend to order ""Little Ashes"" now that it is available and am planning to see ""Remeber Me"" when it is released in March.  I am hopeful that people will give him a chance to showcase his talent outside of Edward Cullen.",1264982400,,772,4.356643356643357
3952256,5,B002MD3USC,I was not expecting to be so entertained.  I must admit I'm completely taken by this young man and was glad to see he can act.  Although this was not a very good representation of his vocals it was fun to watch.  I am a grandmother of six and have two grandsons about the age of the young man represented in this film and although this was a bit over the top I have watched them try to decide who to be and how to be.  I'm hoping to see much more from Robert Pattinson and I hope that will include some music.  I strongly recommend this movie although I think it is not for the very young as I don't think they would see the humor.,1264550400,2,631,3.937007874015748
3952257,3,B002MD3USC,"How to Be is a quirky movie for Rob Pattinson fans. It is an unusual story but Rob and the other characters pull it off. It is totally believeable acting and Rob is just so precious in his neediness. I will admit that if you aren't a fan of Rob you probably won't care for the movie. However, if you are a fan of Rob you will treasure it and is a must have for your collection.",1264032000,,377,3.909090909090909

3952259,5,B002MD3USC,"For lovers of indie-movies, this British (tragi-)comedy about an unsuccessful and aimless young man who invites a self-help guru to live with him in order to ""be more normal"" is a true gem!
With brutal honesty and a great, quiet sense of humor, it perfectly captivates the angst of young adults and their struggle into what is supposedly real life. Consistently good acting, a neat score and many little laughs from many lovely little details make for inspiring, yet in no way condescending entertainment - because who does actually know ""how to be""...?!",1261785600,4,554,4.967741935483871
3952260,5,B002MD3USC,"I loved this movie and I did not think I was going to be charmed by the character of Art. If you like British humour, this is your kind of movie. If you like indie movies, you'll love this one. And if you don't know how you feel about Rob's acting, then I suggest you give this movie a chance. The only thing I can say about the story is everybody knows someone like Art, someone who is neurotic, depressed, all over the place and a total mess. At the end of the movie you'll realize your life is not that bad at all! Also you'll go and hug your parents and question your taste in friends, ha, ha. Give it a try.",1261180800,8,612,3.983739837398374
8373849,5,B002MD3USC,"This is an hilarious movie.  The British accents are, at times, a bit difficult to follow but worth the effort  Robert Pattinson plays the lead character in such a way that you want to just hug him!",1519257600,,198,4.324324324324325
8373850,5,B002MD3USC,Loved this early Robert Pattinson movie. I find it interesting to watch his career progress. He just keeps getting better and more diverse.,1497571200,,139,5.086956521739131

8373852,4,B002MD3USC,"I'm in no way a fan of the actor, but the man had some talent when he started off. This movie is very much like a small indie film (don't expect special effects or a stellar cast) but it gets you because the character of Art is so human. Human in the way that he struggles, that no one believes in him anymore or takes him seriously, and how he feels so abandoned and alone in his life. It does follow the moral of going for your passion in life whether it is music or something but this film does not overdue that theme.
  I won't spoil the entire plot but the film traces the hardships of Art and how his life has fallen apart from a broken relationship with his live in girlfriend, no support with his parents, no real job, and no friends that care to really listen and understand him. He feels alone but the way he gets his life back together inspires me. I believe one the best scenes of the film is the very last scene before the performance when he gives himself a pep talk. That to me is authentic, real acting so very few people could ever do and it makes the audience root for the protagonist because it tells us that we never needed to please others and that only we determine where we go from here.",1465344000,,1210,4.14468085106383

8373855,1,B002MD3USC,"This is the second worst movie I've ever seen.  The worst movie is The Rover also starring Robert Pattenson. The guy is flat, has no presence, and struggles to deliver his lines.  It's pure torture to watch! DO NOT waist your money!",1443657600,,232,4.5
8373856,5,B002MD3USC,"I love dark comedies and this film made me laugh in the first minute.  Pattinson, like Ashton Kutcher, plays the akward character to perfection.",1440028800,,144,5.0

I'll try it again at some point on a rainy weekend, or the next time we're snowed in by a blizzard.",1428364800,,269,4.173076923076923
