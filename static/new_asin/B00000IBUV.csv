8410703,3,B00000IBUV,For a low-grade B-movie it was OK.  So so acting but the vampire dude was good.  The tracker character seemed to always be one step behind his vamp counterparts and surroundings.,1519948800,,178,4.709677419354839
8410704,1,B00000IBUV,"The worst acting I have seen in a while. I go back to late '60s horror and have never seen such a farce. Not sure what everyone else is watching but this was pathetic. Laughable, perhaps to some, at best.",1515888000,,204,4.125
8410705,5,B00000IBUV,This is a fun movie that made me laugh at loud.  I give it a five stars out of five.  Rick is the best one of the actors (Tom Ecobelli).  He really livens up the scenes he is in.  Thanks for a lot of fun watching this film.  I recommend it.  ST,1152403200,,244,3.5961538461538463
