8381702,2,B002V228A0,Bought this based on the reviews but returned as the content was disappointing. Not quite worth $15 since the FEW topics covered can be easily researched online. Not recommended based on value.,1346889600,2,193,5.0625
8381703,5,B002V228A0,"I saw this first on Youtube a few months back when I became curious about what I could do to further keep myself from getting arrested. I am not sure if I am one of a few or many that realize... Hey, why is it that the police and the government aren't anything like what I learned they were in middle and high school?... but I know that it's really wrong what the government and police are doing. This DVD talks about AND demonstrates via short skits different ways you can get out of being arrested by using phrases such as ""Officer, am I being detained? Or am I free to go?"" It also gives you a new outlook on police and helps give you confidence to stand up to their intimidating, authoritarian techniques used to demean you and make you conform. Here is an example that happened to me before and after I watched this video:

About a month or so before I watched this video, I was walking from my apartment to a bank to deposit my check at the ATM. The city I live in has a ""Chicago style"" grid layout with alley ways between the main roads. I walked about 8 blocks to my bank and on my way back I was listening to my ipod. I stopped to tie my shoe and when I looked down I caught a glimpse behind me to see a police car sitting there with the headlights off. I continued walking and pretended to look at something on the side of the road so that I could have an excuse to look behind me when I passed the object. (A shoe or something). I noticed that the officer was following behind me down the alley with all lights off. (Basically profiling and stalking me). I finally stopped and turned around which at that time SHE felt it was necessary to flip her squads cherries and berries on. She hopped out of the car and immediately started interrogating me. She asked me -where i was going -why i was out so late- -why i was walking through the alley- she asked me for my id -she put me in cuffs and detained me until she ""Checked my papers"" and made sure I wasn't some felon or convicted criminal or something. After all that she let me go and I went home.

Now that (to some people) might just be a cop doing her job but to me that was an intimidation technique used to scare citizens into conforming. I know that sounds a little ""conspiracy theory-ish"" but it's true. The following 2 weeks I did the same thing (I got off work at 11 p.m.) Between paychecks I watched this video and here is the result of my second encounter: (I also used my cell phone's video camera to record the incident)

Officer: May I see your license sir?
Me: Is there a problem officer?
Officer: Yeah you look suspicious so I need to run your ID.
Me: I'm sorry I do not understand YOUR credentials for suspicious activity. I do understand that the Constitution says I am a free Human and can do what I want under it and am free to travel where I please without prosecution. I am not required to have an ID on me when walking, only whem driving a commercial motor (electric) vehicle. Is there anything else I can help you with? Am I being detained or am I free to go officer?
Officer: Are you a lawyer?
Me: No just a human that isn't going to let someone intimidate or pressure me into doing something I don't have to. I am minding my own business and you decided you wanted to get into it. I am going to leave now. If you continue to harass me I will report you to the state. Have a good night officer.

When you are not informed of the law or do not know your rights, you can get taken advantage of and incrue petty charges that are un-necessary, and unlawful. KNOW YOUR RIGHTS! FLEX YOUR RIGHTS!!!

8381704,5,B002V228A0,"This DVD is an absolute MUST have for all people 18-99 years old.  Police are here to do a job, this video just evens the playing field when the police are four or more steps ahead of you.  Police are trained to deceive you in order to get what they want.  Train yourself with this video and exercise your rights as an American.",1165104000,22,328,4.174603174603175
