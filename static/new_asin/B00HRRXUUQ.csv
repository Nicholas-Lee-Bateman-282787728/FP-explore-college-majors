8634919,1,B00HRRXUUQ,"I'm sorry to give this movie a 1 for those who liked it but I watched this movie expecting a nice reuniting with Madoka and Homura well I was really disappointed. I watched the series Puella Magi Madoka Magica and I thought it was really good and I thought how it ended was good just the way it is. Then I heard of this movie thinking that there will be a good ending but I was crushed watching this. The only parts that I did like was with Sayaka and Mami because they were awesome in how they fought, but that's about it. I think this movie was only a means to go further with the series which I think is uncalled for. Again sorry to give this a bad review but after watching this it just makes me not want to watch it anymore so there it is.",1433116800,,744,4.0
8634920,2,B00HRRXUUQ,"Wow... I tried so hard to avoid any spoiler and waited until my birthday to watch this since I love the anime series and now I finally finished watching this and I'm really mad, disappointed and stunned by how this ended...

First, what's up with the price??  It's such a rip off.  I really love the Madoka series, but the price for both TV series and movies are just out of whack.

I also strongly suggest that if you LOVE the TV Series... you should completely skip all 3 movies.  The first 2 movies are just recap which condense the TV series into 2 movies.  There are some important scenes missing.  The new scenes  are mainly character transformation acts which you could easily watch on Youtube....

Now, this movie.... the 3rd movie storyline is new... but it has a really horrible ending that completely ruined the story line of the TV series.... I'm so disappointed with the story that I wished I had NEVER ever watched it...

First, the story is okay.  It started out with the group of all 5 magical girls living a normal live of being a students and then fight together against nightmares monster at night. But problem is that isn't possible because of how the TV series ended.  So what's going?  Of course, one of them becomes skeptical and the rest of the story follows along the line of ""There's something wrong with this world I'm living in..."" There are more musics and extended fighting scenes.  The presentation and production values are very good.  But personally, I would rather they spend more time of character and story explanation.  The new transformation animation are just horrible IMHO... wish they could cut and paste the ones from the previous movies...

***Spoiler Alert***

Now what really upset me is that ending or final couple of acts... that final 20 minutes.... the story build up to a point where it could have a satisfying resolution.  And by that, I didn't mean a ""Happy Ending"", the Madoka series isn't a fairy tale story about happiness ever after.  Nonetheless, the ending in TV series ties things up correctly.  Many fans probably would like Madoka to continue exist in a reality, but Madoka wished to ease suffering of her friends and bring hope to a rather hopeless reality of ""being a magical girl is destine to become a witch"".  This story, plots and characters are all well developed.  Therefore, I think that fans could understand the ending of Madoka while not an ultimate happy ending, but it is still a very good ones because of its story elements.  But in this movie, when every mystery, plots seemed to be resolved, then all of the sudden, out of nowhere, a twisted final act that turn the main heroine into a villain calling herself a demon or devil? Wow, I didn't see that coming.  The TV series has some stunning revelation, but it follows a great story and the build up is done correctly.  In THIS movie, this ending sequences, that turn of event came out of nowhere.  There are no build up, no explanation... nothing!  That evilness and tones was so horrible.... it far outweigh anything and everything that Kyubey ever did.  And in the case of Kyubey, at least you could argue that he is in fact an alien who is trying to solve a energy crisis of the universe and that he could never understand what human emotions are....  But what this character did at the end was her free will and that she chose to screw everyone over when there's absolutely no sign of the way she acted in TV series or movie... it really felt like the creator was telling a good story all along and then when it's about to end... he just stand up and said.. ""Yea...  you think this is how it will end?  Well, F'k U!!!"" Then he just spitted at the audience, stand up and leave....

That is exactly how I felt in that final 20 minutes... this is such a horrible way to end a movie or series....Why would you do that? I wouldn't mind if it is a sobbing ending but this just left a very bad taste in my month.  It absolutely destroyed the TV series story. The only thing that it could set up is maybe another TV series or movie??  But givin' few years had passed since it ended in Japan, I doubt that'll happen......... Now I just wish there's like a magic that make me un-watch this and never allow me know what happened at the end.... /SIGH

Edit:  Okay, I did a bit of research of the ending, the term 'devil' and what it meant when it was mentioned in the final acts.  First, Christianity is not a major religion in Japan.  When they used term like ""God/Goddes"", ""Devil"", there's no religion reference to those terms.  Ultimate Madoka was refer as ""God/Goddes"" couple of times, but she's not God, she has Godlike power.  When Homura kidnapped, separate, stolen parts of Ultimate Madoka, she obtains power that could defeat the Godlike figure.  And the Japanese term for such being that has so much power is ""Devil/Demon"".  This person obtained such power is 'extremely powerful' but might not necessary had a 'evil' intent despite the way she talked, gestures and smiled.  At the end, Homura could had created world that is much worse, but we can see that Mami, Nagisa(Bebe), Sayaka, Sakura are at least alive and seem to be living normal life which show that Homura's intents are misguided but not necessary evil..........

Still.... if Homura ultimate wish is to see Madoka being happy, then note that Madoka almost never smile once in that new world.  When she sees and talks to Homura, her expression is anything but ""happy"". In fact Madoka seems far more frighten, timid, scared and unease during the entire walking sequence. So even with the ultimate power, Homura just couldn't put a smile to the one person she truly love and care for.... what a ironic way to tie it back to the original series theme of ""What you wish for is not always what you'll get at end"".

Now, I felt a bit better about the ending but I still think this is a horrible way to end such a beautiful series.",1420416000,2,5918,4.544853635505193

8634923,5,B00HRRXUUQ,"Just a heads up to everyone. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS FROM AMAZON. Now, don't get me wrong. This movie is great, memorable, and has a finale that ties up the original series in an arguably better way. But you'd be getting scammed to purchase this from here. For just $10 more than what it's going for here, You can get the limited edition imported from Japan from Rightstuf. And if you're not interested in that, the standard edition is going for just $50.",1399766400,17,452,4.457831325301205
8634924,5,B00HRRXUUQ,"First off, this is a hard movie to get your hands on, considering you have to import it to watch it. But I did get my hands onto it, and I'm so glad I did. An original story exclusive to the movie series, the film explores a Mitakihara City where Madoka and her friends are all alive and fighting creatures called Nightmares. However Homura starts to suspect that something is amiss, and as evidence piles up that they may be trapped in a witch's labyrinth, she'll come to terms with the darkest secrets in her heart and make decisions that'll affect everyone around her.

This movie is full of twists that'll keep you guessing at what happens next, and when you finally get to the eye-popping ending, you'll want to hope there's a sequel, because this movie leaves open some really good possibilities for one. The animation is excellent and the story is pulse-pounding thrill a minute. If you can, watch this movie.",1398988800,2,916,4.619631901840491
8634925,5,B00HRRXUUQ,"This is it, folks, the moment you have all been waiting for, Madoka Magica The Movie: Rebellion.

MINOR SPOILERS LIE AHEAD, SO PLEASE BE ADVISED, IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE SERIES, WATCH IT AND THEN COME BACK AND READ WHAT A MASTERPIECE THIS SERIES, THIRD MOVIE INCLUDED, IS!

The series is streaming on Crunchyroll.com, one of the few legal and free sites to watch anime on

Shameless plug out of the way, I'll continue.

I am assuming that, if you are still reading this then you have seen the series up until the third movie. This movie takes place after the end of the series, and shows the events that transpire after the apparent ""resolution""

Saying any more would be akin to a felony, the plot of this movie is so well crafted that it should really be experienced completely fresh and with no information about the movie, other than the series, prior to watching it

Gen Urobushi pulled out all of the stops for Madoka Rebellion in the art, story, and sound departments, and it shows.

The series, on its own without Rebellion is my second favorite story of all time, only losing out to Breaking Bad

Well, Mr. White, it looks like your time has come, the king has been dethroned. Homura Akemi has cast you down to second place.

With the inclusion of Puella Magi Madoka Magica The Movie: Rebellion, Madoka rockets into my all time favorite series of any format (anime, movie, live action, television series, book, etc). Even if you don't like anime, watch Madoka with an open mind, then watch this movie. You will be rewarded with the most masterfully crafted story that you will ever see in your life*

In the words of Plankton: ""It's Evil, It's Diabolical, It's Lemon Scented!""

It is also absolutely, 100% worth your time and money to see this series and to top it off with this masterpiece of a movie

Even if you hate anime, or have simply never watched it before, you owe it to yourself to give Madoka Magica/Rebellion a chance, you'll be glad you did!
