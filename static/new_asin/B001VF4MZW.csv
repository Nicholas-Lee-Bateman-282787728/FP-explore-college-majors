I WOULD HAVE GIVEN THIS 5 STARS, BUT I CAN'T.
ARE WE EVER GOING TO GET A GAY MOVIE THAT ENDS HAPPLY.
EVEN WITH ALL THE VIOLENCE ,  I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A HAPPY ENDING TO
A PINOY """""" LOVE """"""  STORY.
AGAIN,  EVEYONE DID AN EXCELLENT JOB.",1252368000,,278,4.0
8346251,5,B001VF4MZW,"I would expect this movie to win a lot of international film festival awards in spite of the controversial subject matter.

The movie has english subtitles.

The acting, the directing, the story are all top notch.

Polo Ravales and Joseph Bitangcol (besides being incredibly sexy) are perfect in their roles as a younger man and his older mentor.

This is not just a gay love story/drama. However, the subject matter is for mature adults (rated R) and not recommended for children.

The story delves into many contemporary issues that trouble the Philippines: An overseas contract worker returning to a broken home, illegal recruiters, disappearance of Philippine citizens forced into international sex slave traffic, corrupt police that seem to be immune from prosecution, spousal abuse.",1238112000,3,788,5.32258064516129
