3892484,5,B002AT4MCQ,"A fact-based overview of the quintessential Ponzi scheme. Madoff is a con artist to be sure, but he is only the tip of a glacial mass on Wall Street. Since Reagan, the waves of federal deregulation and the ill-conceived withdrawal of oversight and transparency literally created an incubation chamber for greed and abuse. The casino capitalism of Bush/Cheney opened the gates to outright fraud and rampant corruption.

Corporations were seduced into turning accounting upside-down. Projected revenues became reported income, massive debt became corporate assets, legitimate stocks became credit default swaps... go figure? If we look back not that many years, Enron, Tyco and WorldCom were simply the prelude to Bear Stearns, Lehman Bros, Fannie, Freddie, AIG -- and Madoff. Gordon Gecko's ""greed is good"" soliloquy (from the movie Wall Street) was indeed prescient and emblematic of these times.

Sadly, America has become a nation that knows the price of everything... and the value of nothing. From corporate debt that is reported as assets, to fantasy home mortgages that are expected to default, to the ""Lifestyles of the Rich and Shameless"" mentality that is so widely promoted by the media and embraced by the public, it is abundantly obvious that this nation has lost it's moral compass. To quote Justice Louis Brandeis, ""We can have democracy in this country, or we can have great wealth concentrated in the hands of a few, but we can't have both.""",1251763200,6,1457,5.169491525423729
3892485,3,B002AT4MCQ,"This is a reasonable account of Bernie Madoff's scamming of American investors.  The story is told in an entertaining way and is watchable.  However, what it has in terms of watchability it loses in terms of fire power.  The production is thin and tends to be based on surface evidence.  At the end of the movie I am left wondering: ""How did he do this? Did he ever generate real returns?  Did a legitimate business somehow morph into a fraudulent entity? What happened in the court case?  What were the arguments? Who delivered the knockout punches?  What about the clowns at the SEC?  How will they be held accountable?"" Greater rigour would have turned this movie into a decent documentary.  Still, the show is watchable.",1251158400,2,724,4.728

8360363,5,B002AT4MCQ,"Chronicles the history of Madoff from his 1960's beginnings. It appears he did have some actual legitimate business, but then he also created a fake business in which he claimed 1 percent a month increase. To get into that fund a person had to know someone he knew (in a form of vetting).

Eventually a whistle-blower became aware of Madoff's fund and examined it. he came up with a long list of Red Flags that it was a Ponzi Scheme. He took his findings to the SEC a number of times. The people there were appointed, not numbers people and were unable to understand what he told them and dismissed the claims. Also, Madoff was the head of NASDAC so people did not want to believe he was a fraud. An interview of him appears. Other schemes occurred, not as big or well-known.

When the 2008 financial collapse occurs, so does his whole house of cards. Photos of his famous victims appear and stories of his non-famous victims are shared. A complete lack of government oversight, heartbreaking.

In the extras the 1929 Crash is compared to the 2008 Crash, show the comparison and contrasts. Insightful and time sad.",1457740800,,1114,4.616161616161616

8360366,4,B002AT4MCQ,"I was reluctant to give this review the 5 stars because the Madoff story continues to unravel. Since the DVD was made there have been at least two more suicides directly related to the case including the son of one of Bernie's partners. However, there are clearly three lessons to take away from the case: 1. If it appears too good to be true, it is! 2. The Federal Government is incompetent.(The Obama Administration shows us that on a daily basis) 3. This case was also a story of Ethnic Betrayal, and it is a direction nobody desires to admit. Now this type of ethnic betrayal is not unusual among immigrant groups. One only has to study Ponzi and various Latino scams in recent memory. But these victims were in many cases third generation, affluent American Jews. Jews betrayed Jews! Many if not most of Madoff's victims were Jews who trusted Madoff because he was a Jew. In addition, the magnitude of this rip-off may never be determined since nobody has an accurate figure and the ripple effect collapsed a portion of our economy, and may have caused a major loss of faith in the Stock Market for many years to come. The video should be required viewing for anyone studying American economics or White Collar Crime in modern times. I have used it as a teaching video in a college level Criminal Justice course that I taught and it worked.",1373241600,7,1345,4.5850622406639
8360367,4,B002AT4MCQ,"While this film does not go into gory personal details about Madoff or his family, it provides an excellent analysis of the way in which his fraud (and others throughout history) is connected to the economic/historical environment. It's produced by the history channel, so this is clearly their focus. I would recommend this for introductory criminology courses or sociology of deviance courses if you are an instructor.  A concise, interesting overview of Madoff's Ponzi and its place in the history of frauds, the film has interviews with victims and prominent journalists who have written about the case. One problem is that the film ends before Madoff's sentencing, so that story and its symbolic significance is lost, as well as the way in which Picard then went after victims through clawback schemes. Overall, though, a recommended film.",1353456000,6,844,5.205882352941177
8360368,5,B002AT4MCQ,"Madoff and the Scamming of America, 2009 film

Bernie Madoff is the `poster boy' for the crimes of the Wall Street Gangsters. The corporate media lied to its customers [its their job] about the wealth to be made by investing in the Stock Market. The faults of the investors is partly due to the mis-education by the schools and colleges of America. The 2008 market crash revealed the ""bubbles"" of overvalued stocks and bonds. [Caused by the sophisticated swindles by Wall Street insiders; read the book ""Predator Nation"".] A ""Ponzi Scheme"" is an investment scam that is inherently flawed due to a lack of inherent productivity. Its promises can't be kept. [The `Internet Bubble' was another example of a swindle. Remember President Bush's plan for a privatized Social Security in 2005?]

The story begins with Madoff's arrest for fraud. People tell of losing their investments. [Diversify?] Madoff made it look genuine; his returns were not above average (10%-12% a year). It was misplaced trust, not a ""get rich quick scheme"". [This story does not mention the similar swindles in the 1920s; read a book about the Pecora investigation.] Bernie learned about stock selling while a teenager when he was involved with `over the counter' securities. He developed computerized accounting, and was involved with NASDAQ (for small companies). Bernie's victims were mostly the super-rich, Hedge Funds, and Charity Funds (they keep 95% of their donations). Those with long-term investments would not soon ask for their money back. Hedge Funds are unregulated investments for super-rich individuals. Bernie got ""feeder funds"" to shovel money into Madoff Securities. These investors did not know where their money went, but their money managers collected fees for their participation.

Madoff branched out to international investors. The SEC ignored the warnings about Madoff's fraud (from mathematical models). Madoff's returns were not possible without insider trading (""front running"") or a fraud. [No mention of the culpability of Congress from its laws and budgeting. But Congress answers to Wall Street and the super-rich.] In the 1990s the New Deal laws and regulations were subverted or neutralized to allow the old stock and bond swindles to reoccur. The Dot-Com swindles were another example of ""bubbles"" where the price of a stock was pushed upward until it collapsed to pennies on the dollar. The small investor took the losses. Madoff solicited his customers from the wealthy aristocracy of America and elsewhere.

Back in the 1970s Richard Ney, an insurance advisor, wrote two books. ""The Wall Street Jungle"" told how the Stock Market was rigged against small investors. Information in the press is disguised advertising to lure its readers into bad investments. ""The Wall Street Gang"" told more. There has been a crash on Wall Street about every twenty years since the late 18th century (read ""A Nation of Deadbeats""). The New Deal Securities laws were still in effect then! These laws began to be attacked and demolished in the 1990s. [Clinton was the continuation of the Reagan-Bush administrations.] Clinton passed NAFTA, unlike his predecessor. Jobs began to be exported as an attack on ordinary American's prosperity. Prosperity can only exist when most Americans are doing well. If only the rich have money the result is a depression. That is why prosperity results when there is a high income tax rate of 70% to 90% on the super-rich, and most people pay less in. Then true prosperity exists, like in the 1950s and 1960s. Only a ""bubble"" causes the stock market to rise when ordinary American's income is stagnant. This price manipulation can't last and results in a market crash. ""When will they ever learn?""

""Crash: The Next Great Depression"" discusses the September 2008 run on money markets when the subprime mortgage market collapsed (due to overvalued stocks). The Federal Government had to bail out Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (mortgage banks). This collapsed caused Iceland to go bankrupt (they bought into these swindles). A boom in housing created a speculative bubble when the loss of good-paying job impoverished people. Collateralized Mortgage Obligations offered opportunities for swindlers who sold them to foreign countries. Destroying the New Deal Investment Laws led to the Savings & Loan bankruptcies when mortgages could not be repaid. Junk Bonds allowed the looting of prosperous companies. Greenspan's influence didn't stop this. Wealth became concentrated as everyone else became poorer (NAFTA shipped jobs overseas). The collapse of markets caused a liquidity crunch (non-payment of bills). The loss of jobs and wealth led to decreased sales and more job losses. Liquidity injections (cash) provided money to banks. Will this prevent another Great Depression? Or are we half-way there? Only time will tell.",1332633600,3,4841,5.27367055771725
8360369,2,B002AT4MCQ,I was excited when I bought this DVD. Not too much about Madoff himself. He is not on the DVD all that much. Just a lot of other people talking about him. It does have some interesting facts. I just wish they would have included more in there about the man himself.,1303689600,4,265,4.115384615384615
