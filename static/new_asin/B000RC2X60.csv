2864076,5,B000RC2X60,"I purchased this video to help ""keep things moving"" over the cold winter months.  Despite a couple of negative reviews about the production quality, I found the dvd to be great - and the instructor friendly, welcoming and not at all intimidating!  This is a video made for beginners and is perfect for novices like us!  That's exactly the point!  Please don't let a couple of reviews that expect full blown ""Hollywood"" production values keep you from enjoying this wonderful, and fun, salsa workout!  Highly recommended and fast friendly shipping too!",1196726400,18,551,5.010989010989011
2864077,1,B000RC2X60,I would rate this production zero if possible. From the packaging to staging it looks like it was done in someones basement.  Then to top it off the DVD would get stuck at various points in the video. I am currently trying to return the product. We will see how professional they handle an unsatisfied customer.  PS. this is the first review I have ever felt it necessary to write!,1196726400,7,381,4.428571428571429
2864078,5,B000RC2X60,"I was not sure what to expect with this video.  I tried to salsa dance once or twice with my friends but lacked confidence (and true knowledge of the steps).  I have some experience with exercise videos and this one is different than the others.  There is only one instructor, which I personally liked.  No frills. Just basic, which was good for me because I am not a dancer. The exercise portion is also a full hour, which is a lot longer than other videos out there, but it really goes by VERY quickly because it is definitely not boring!  Also, it is the only one that I would do with friends for fun.  I have showed it to them when they come over and we end up doing it! Great workout, too.",1192492800,12,694,4.180451127819549
2864079,5,B000RC2X60,"I bought this DVD not knowing what to expect.  I tried to salsa dance at a club once, but didn't really get the steps.  I also am not a huge fan of any aerobic exercise b/c it is usually so boring.  This dvd is the exception! I learned the basic steps and can now dance at any salsa club with confidence and get a great workout every time I Salsacise.  The instructor has a pleasant voice and is very down to earth. She is not like most of the instructors on other videos b/c she seems just like a normal everyday person and I think that is what I like about it.  She makes it so easy that ANYONE can do it. I invite my girlfriends over and we do it for fun and the kids like it too.  It doesn't have all the bells and whistles that other dvd's have with drummers and fancy backgrounds, but who needs all that?  Definitely a good purchase!",1190160000,23,839,4.048484848484849
2864080,1,B000RC2X60,"Nothing personal against the ""dancer/instructor"" in this video, but this was the most low-budget, cheap, amateur production I have ever seen.  The set was lame, the music sounded like it was coming from a boom box on the set and the instructor had absolutely no musicality in her steps. The movements were just awkward and sad.

Definitely not worth the 20 dollars I paid for it.  Don't waste your money.",1187308800,11,404,4.742857142857143
2864081,5,B000RC2X60,"This is a very basic and fun dance workout with a single instructor who is pleasant and makes the steps easy to follow. The hour does go by quickly and that is a longer workout than the typical dance fitness videos.  The music is great and the instructor does not yelp or do any high pitched stuff.  She seems just like a normal person so it is easy for a beginner to follow. I think this is good for someone who wants to try Zumba, but isn't ready yet, or wants to go out Salsa Dancing, but needs the confidence in knowing the basics first.  This Salsacise Made Simple DVD is a good one if you are new to the world of dance fitness.",1184112000,41,633,4.088709677419355
2864082,5,B000RC2X60,I have really enjoyed Salsacise! made simple.  The music is awesome and the steps are taught in a manner that is easy to learn for even a beginner (like me).  My 2 and 4 year old daughters will follow right along with the video so I can exercise and keep them entertained at the same time!  A great exercise solution for busy moms!,1181692800,20,331,4.222222222222222
8199937,3,B000RC2X60,If you  have a discipline to stay at home and exercise religiously then this could be for you. I found it a fun way to learn to dance and get in shape but alas like most other home workout things after a time it was no longer used.,1440979200,2,231,3.8125
8199938,3,B000RC2X60,This product is ok but I would've liked the music to be better and motivating.  The moves are a little too basic and slow for my taste.,1399248000,,135,4.0
8199939,1,B000RC2X60,"Poor quality of the DVD. I feel that I totally wasted my money buying this. I tried to give it away, but ended up giving it to Goodwill",1368057600,,135,3.857142857142857
8199940,1,B000RC2X60,"This program is not for beginners, it's for morons!  The instructor is mehcanical/robotic and definitely doesn't move like any Latin dancer I've ever seen.  Verrrry low budget DVD and the instruction is extremely repetitious - I mean hit-the-fast-forward-button-again-and-again repetitious!!  No challenge whatsoever.  I don't want to be mean, I just don't want you to waste your money too.  Sorry Donna!",1324252800,2,404,5.666666666666667
8199941,1,B000RC2X60,"I have been to a zumba class and it was very fun and excellent exercise.  So I was excited to receive this and try it out.

I have a belly dancing DVD that I enjoy.  It has beautiful girls in authentic costumes and wonderful Indian decorations.  The music is also great.  So I expected the same with this salsa dancing.  Boy, was I disappointed!!  The studio looked like a gym.  The instructor didn't dress the part, she was boring, and the music was awful.

I wish I could get my money back!!",1286064000,2,493,4.271739130434782
8199942,4,B000RC2X60,"I like the fact that she takes it slow and really helps you learn the steps. I wish, that there were more to it than a tutorial. I was hoping it would be an actual work out session to follow.",1279584000,6,191,3.8
8199943,2,B000RC2X60,"I am a senior and in pretty good shape but not able to do the jumping around of aerobics.  I'm also not very coordinated for all the dance type steps so I thought salsa-type dancing would work since I heard it isn't as structured.  This one seemed simple and I bought it to learn some moves.  The tutorial is pretty basic but fine for someone like me.  The exercise portion is okay and decent aerobic exercise, but don't expect to be inspired by the music - for all intents and purposes, there is none.  It's very faint and can barely be heard.  I'm thinking I might download some salsa music to my ipod to listen to while doing this dvd.  It wasn't that expensive and does give you the exercise, just not the ""fun"" of the upbeat music.",1275955200,4,736,4.2898550724637685
8199944,3,B000RC2X60,"This video is just ok because it moves a little too fast for me to catch on.  The tutorial and actual exercise segments are backwards. Clicking on tutorial gets you the exercise movements, clicking the exercise segment gets you the tutorial. Very confusing until you figure it out on your own. Not worth $19.95.",1255046400,5,311,4.7592592592592595
8199945,5,B000RC2X60,"My 23 yr old daughter and I had such a blast learning the moves and doing this together.  We were totally surprised to be able to really do this, since we both are so un-coordinated and dance ignorant.  We laughed and joked and had the best time together.  My pregnant daughter joined us for part of our first try and it was hysterical.  But, the greatest thing is that you could replay the tutorial instruction over and over until you got it.  We took 2-3 trys for each of the dance steps, but, it was pretty easy.  I like the simplicity of it and the fact that I actually feel like I can do this and have some fun.  Great for all ages and all abilities since you can just do what you can and work toward the rest.",1199923200,12,715,4.100719424460432
8199946,1,B000RC2X60,"I agree with a previous review. I also think that a 1-star rating is rather quite generous. OMG this DVD is so bad! This is SO low budget that I am surprised I was able to hear anything including the music which sounded like it was coming from a cassette and not a CD. The instructor is so lame and there is just no life to her. She has no 'umpf' to get anyone to move. She is so dry and the poor attempt of the camera to catch her at different angles further exacerbates her monotony and the awful basement-like quality of the 'studio'. I did 5 minutes of it and was more blah than how I feel first thing in the morning. Trust me, I'm not one to buy videos with bimbettes jumping around either. Yes, the DVD clearly states BEGINNERS but BEGINNERS are not dead people. Salsa is A LOT of fun even if you are not professional but this woman made it look like a chore, like ""let me do this DVD so I can get paid something."". Oh goodness, SAVE your $$ and forget about this DVD. You'll end up so depressed and it would be a shame to have to associate Salsa with this DVD.",1196899200,14,1067,4.061611374407583
