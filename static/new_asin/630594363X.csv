8167949,5,630594363X,this is a wonderful circus DVD for anyone who is a circus buff like myself...fantastic acts and I like the commentary that goes along with the performances. I wish there was another DVD of the next year  if there was a festival...this should be an annual event with DVD's each year. I watch this DVD often and don't get tired of it.,1451433600,,332,4.354838709677419
8167950,3,630594363X,"This is a competition style video. If you're looking for an actual circus video you'd probably be disappointed. But if you're a performer or close follower of circus acts you will definitely appreciate the skill and variety showcased here. There are some very unique acts on the DVD you won't see just anywhere. I subtracted big points for the absolutely dreadful Olympic style commentary that is overlayed on the video. No juggler has ever referred to his craft as ""jugglery"". If you can get past that, it's a cool video. One that I enjoy having in my collection.",1149984000,,564,4.76530612244898
