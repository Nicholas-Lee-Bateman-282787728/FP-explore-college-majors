8657655,4,B00KCU2Q32,"Both Villazon and Hampson sang beautifully as did the orchestra. The video and audio were amazing throughout the concert. Just one complaint about the concert: I wish there was more singing from both Villazon and Hampson. Both sang 3 arias each and a duet. Overall I really enjoyed the concert, just which it had more arias or duets.",1406937600,,333,4.758620689655173
