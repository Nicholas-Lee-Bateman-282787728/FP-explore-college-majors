2966914,5,B000WCN8C8,The nature series is a wonderful series from PBS. I love birds and have learned a lot about our indigenous species the American Bald Eagle through the Decorah Eagles web site and have learned a lot more through these informative educational DVD's. Thank you,1393632000,,257,4.863636363636363
2966915,5,B000WCN8C8,My son is a huge raptor fan.  He loved this video (and so did the entire family).  It's informative and well done.,1385078400,,114,4.136363636363637
2966916,4,B000WCN8C8,"My husband loves to watch hawks, eagles, and owls around our area, so I thought he'd enjoy this DVD. It was very interesting! We recommend it!",1356739200,,142,4.5
2966917,4,B000WCN8C8,"Not sure what my expectations where for this dvd but it goes into detail about raptors and their ability for amazing flight. This dvd compares the birds to various aircraft and is fairly informative. Not the BEST dvd for raptors, but there aren't many available on amazon, so I'm happy with the purchase.",1316563200,6,304,4.754716981132075
2966918,5,B000WCN8C8,"Being a birder and a physics teacher, this was a fascinating DVD.  I continue to be amazed at the abilities of birds - like the peregrine that pulls 25 g's while diving at prey!  The movie looks at how bird fly and how humans can use those concepts in airplane wing design.  If you like birds and/or flying, you will like this!",1297468800,8,327,4.241935483870968
2966919,4,B000WCN8C8,"and hawks, falcons, owls, and vultures, too.  This was an interesting program about some of the major raptors and how they utilize various strategies when pursuing their prey.  You'll see: the 200-mph dive of the peregrine falcon; how the owl uses almost silent flight and extraordinary hearing to locate targets beneath the snow; how vultures utilize wind currents to soar almost effortlessly in the sky; a harpy eagle change direction and retract its wings while maneuvering through a forest; and more.  For some segments of the show a tiny camera is attached to the raptors, so you literally get a ""bird's eye"" view of the action, including the dive of the peregrine falcon.  Pretty cool stuff.

Four stars.  If birds of prey are your thing, this is one you probably don't want to miss!",1203984000,24,789,4.850746268656716
