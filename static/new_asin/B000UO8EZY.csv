My only complaint is that, within the video, this is introduced as the first part of a series. However, it seems that the rest of the series was never produced. Mr. Newsome has a great series of DVDs on Lindy Hop, but apparently, this is the only one specifically dealing with Jitterbug.

8214131,5,B000UO8EZY,"I always wanted to swing dance.  This was a great way to start.  I was able to pickup Jitterbug relatively quickly and was able to social dance after a few sessions with this DVD.  Great vid, totally recommend.",1333411200,2,210,4.473684210526316
8214132,5,B000UO8EZY,"The worst part about most dance instruction videos, is I have a hard time taking the instructions seriously...But these two are completely different. Having heard Dan's name several times in the world of dance, I finally understood why as I watched him take you through the lessons.  Its nice to take instruction from someone who really knows their craft.

A great gift for anyone that wants to have a alot of fun.",1324339200,,414,4.736111111111111
8214133,5,B000UO8EZY,"This DVD is from National Swing Dance Champions Daniel and Tiffiny. They can dance and they know how to teach. There is enough material, if mastered, to have you looking good on the dance floor. From my perspective, one of the most important aspects of any dance DVD are the demos. This is where you get to see if the instructors can really dance. Daniel and Tiffiny show that even beginner level moves can be fun, elegant, and sexy.",1230508800,2,433,4.493670886075949
