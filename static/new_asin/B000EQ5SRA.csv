2527795,5,B000EQ5SRA,It was fun to watch these old flicks that I had not seen since I was a kid. Quality is as good as could be expected as the media back then was not exactly Blu-Ray quality...Good investment if you want to add some oldies to your collection...,1379894400,,241,4.148936170212766

2527797,3,B000EQ5SRA,Fairly good movie which I saw in 1950's.  Friends say it contributed to my not joining the USMC in 1951.,1265932800,,104,4.2
2527798,4,B000EQ5SRA,"I've seen all of these films before so I new what I was getting.  They are first quality and nicely packaged and I have enjoyed watching them all again at my leisure.  None of these are true classics but this set has three of the top stars, Wayne, Holden and McQueen, what more could you ask for.",1248480000,,296,4.175438596491228
2527799,3,B000EQ5SRA,"The Bridges at Toko-Ri was recommended to us.  We just watched it and thought it was good.  It is probably your typical older movie in many aspects.  We've been told by a Veteran of the Korean Conflict, that this was very accurate and that is what we were interested in.  We have yet to watch the other two movies included.",1236902400,,323,4.333333333333333
2527800,4,B000EQ5SRA,"Even though Amazon's product description states the Format is color, two of these films (In Harms Way and Hell is for Heroes) are in Black and White.

All of these are fine films, just be warned if you only like ""living"" color!",1233532800,3,227,4.404761904761905
2527801,3,B000EQ5SRA,"I bought Bridges at Toko-Ri to compare Michner's version with how this
raid actually went.  The movie was mostly Hollywood-and-romance and the Michner version of the raid was nothing at all like the brilliantly planned and executed actual one.  I wouldn't recommend it for Korean War history interests but the Hollywood aerial shots are pretty good,as is the acting.",1216857600,2,366,5.186440677966102
2527802,5,B000EQ5SRA,"IN HARM'S WAY is a very interesting WWII film directed and produced by Otto Preminger and is worth repeated viewing for its shear entertainment. John Wayne's subtle yet forceful performance just demonstrates the wide range of his acting abilities. We see John Wayne the actor and consummate professional at work here. He gave an exceptional performance in this film that others can learn from. The whole cast seems in awe of him. Even the usual flamboyant Kirk Douglas seems to have turned it down a notch giving an impressive performance as well. The construction of the characters and their dialogue was well thought out. It seems more powerful today than when it was first released. Its excellent cast includes: Patricia Neal, Tom Tryon, Burgess Meredith, Henry Fonda, Dana Andrews, Hugh O'Brian, Paula Prentiss, Brandon de Wilde, Patrick O'Neal, Franchot Tone, Carroll O'Connor, George Kennedy, Slim Pickens, Bruce Cabot, Larry Hagman, Barbara Bouchet, Stanley Holloway, Jill Haworth and James Mitchum. Jerry Goldsmith composed one of his most introverted scores, which goes against convention for a war film yet it works. This score is an early sign of the great innovative abilities of Jerry Goldsmith. Preminger being the craftsman that he was even helped construct the models of the destroyers and cruisers. Cinematographer, Loyal Griggs received an academy award nomination for his stark black & white images. This is a well-constructed film on all levels.

HELL IS FOR HEROES so we are told. Was there ever a man more misunderstood? Steve McQueen plays a soldier who lives only for the thrill of combat. His character is cold and frightening and borders on the psychotic. He's a sociopath who carves up German soldiers with a butcher knife. After the war there is no going back for him. I saw this when I was a kid. I saw a lot of war movies in the theatre back then but this was the first one that really scared me. It gave me a sick feeling inside of how real war must be like. The scene with the bayonets and landmines left an impact on me for a long time after. Everyone in this film gave realistic performances but I remember how Steve McQueen's character seemed really demented. Yet despite the obvious psychological makeup of McQueen is there still a human being hidden deep within him. What is a hero? Don Siegel directed this tough and mean film and asks this profound question. Cinematographer Harold Lipstein's photography brings stark realism to this film. Composer Leonard Rosenman's score is very reminiscent of his brilliant work for the very popular W.W.II television series ""Combat!"" which ran for 5 years. This film also boasted a brilliant cast. Bobby Darin, James Coburn, Fess Parker, L.Q. Jones, Nick Adams, Harry Guardino, Mike Kellin and Bob Newhart are all featured. This is an underrated classic.

Perhaps the best of these films is THE BRIDGES AT TOKO-RI.  The principal characters are William Holden as Lt. Harry Brubaker USNR, Grace Kelly as his wife Nancy, Fredric March as Rear Admiral George Tarrant, Mickey Rooney as Mike Forney a helicopter rescue pilot and Charles McGraw as Commander Wayne Lee leader of the jet fighter group. THE BRIDGES AT TOKO-RI is a very moving film. The sacrifices that some are called upon to make are often gone untold. This film reminds us of those sacrifices in brilliant almost unsettling color images.  When you see William Holden's final scene and then think back to a prior scene of Holden with his family, the message hits home. We see Fredric March on the bridge of the aircraft carrier reflect on the news of Holden. March unknown to Holden kept a watchful eye on him as if he were his own son.  When the ultimate sacrifice is made, men in command must stand strong, yet inwardly mourn the loss only to themselves. The sacrifice has not gone unrecognized. It is a simple but powerful message.",1150675200,7,3871,4.8948170731707314
