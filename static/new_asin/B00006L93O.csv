1783848,3,B00006L93O,"I love Tony Hillerman's style and characters. I also love Robert Redford as a director. So I was totally at loss when I watched this movie,which possibly had 3 things that had been in the book. The actors were good and I think I would have liked some honesty from Hillerman and Redford acknowledging that the movie and book had little in common, but the characters. However, live and learn - watching the movie again, (not as a Hillerman book) -I  have to admit it wasn't to bad - except for the teenage gang and the hand in the soup",1042934400,6,533,4.33
1783849,5,B00006L93O,I recently saw Skinwalkers on PBS and thought it was an excellent movie to celebrate the new American MYSTERY! Wes Studi as Joe Leaphorn and Adam Beach as Jim Chee were excellent. The scenery was breathtaking as well. I really enjoyed learning more about the Native American culture. Robert Redford and his son deserve a lot of credit for producing this film. I hope we see more Hillerman movies in the future.,1038268800,,410,4.708333333333333
1783850,4,B00006L93O,"Last night on PBS, Americans were able to view the first of the ""American"" mysteries in PBS's long-running Mystery series AND were finally treated to a Tony Hillerman novel done as a movie in accessible and successful form. [Dark Wind was made into a major motion picture and only released on video.  Despite the miscastings, I think it is worth tracking down a copy.]  Skinwalkers finds Lt. Joe Leaphorn, city indian and rationalist, working with Officer Jim Chee, traditionalist and wannabe medicine man, trying to solve a series of killings involving medicine men on the Navajo Reservation.  The link between the murders appears to be an old paint factory and some decades old cases of lead poisoning.  Joe's wife Emma's cancer has returned and Jim meets city indian public defender Janet Pete.  As with any Hillerman story, the landscape is a major character and the human characters play out the inner and outer conflicts of what it means to be an indian.  The casting is Native American where it should be [albeit not necessarily Navajo].  One of the more glaring errors involves Lt. Leaphorn's office wall map, which is missing in action from the movie.  [My Mother called me right after the airing and that is the first thing that we mentioned to each other!]  My big complaint concerns the setting.  It appears the film was shot around Superior, Arizona, an area far to the south of the rez and the red rock country of the Colorado Plateau.  For people who have not read any Hilllerman, this may not be a problem, but for people who have read the novels, this will probably be worse than any of the changes that were made to the story when it was converted into a screenplay.  All in all, Skinwalkers kept the essence of the original novel and shows that you can successfully film a Tony Hilerman novel.",1038182400,45,1812,4.717460317460318
1783851,4,B00006L93O,"I just watched this movie on PBS and really enjoyed it. As a fan of Hillermans' novels I was excited to see this adaptation, not least because of the powerful talents involved. Co-produced by Robert Redford, PBS-Mystery, Carlton TV-UK (developers of Inspector Morse) and starring Wes Studi (Dances With Wolves, Geronimo) with Adam Beach (Smoke Signals) the movie has an authentic feel and look. Hillerman has always been able to capture the feeling of the Indian culture he presents,with respect for the way he portrays both past and present Indian life.
If you're a Hillerman fan don't fear this adaptation, if not, this is a great introduction to his novels and I hope will be just the first of a series of movies from this same team.",1038096000,3,736,4.803149606299213

It was an extremely enjoyable watching experience.",1038096000,2,338,4.894736842105263
1783872,5,B00006L93O,"great Tony Hillerman stories.this series of movies was produced by Robert Redford,for PBS TV.they are fine productions,faithfull to the Tony Hillerman stories & characters.

1783873,5,B00006L93O,"There were fair criticisms of this Mystery installment on PBS. All came from author Hillerman's fans, as Skinwalkers is one of his finest books in the series, full of atmosphere and Navaho tradition. Produced by Robert Redford on a PBS budget, this mystery featuring Navaho Tribal Police Officer Joe Leaphorn and the younger Jim Chee, struggling to find a balance between ancient tradition and modern ways, is actually very good if you can separate it from all the expectations from readers.

Redford's son James changed the story slightly and incorporated elements from other novels in the series. Vistas of the American Southwest and the way of life on the reservation lend atmosphere as Leaphorn (Wes Studi) and Chee (Adam Beach) look into a murder that initially points to a Skinwalker; part of ancient ways and legends Leaphorn has no use for, but Chee embraces. Chee is trying to become a Medicine Man while continuing his official duties, in fact, so is very receptive to ancient ways in this regard.

Leaphorn is trying to come to terms with his wife's illness and that relationship is wonderfully real thanks to Studi and Sheila Tousey, who portray's Emma. Chee's budding relationship with a young Navajo defense attorney named Janet, also marvelously acted by Alex Rice, shows the youth of Chee and his struggles with the old ways and the new. The personal struggles of the two very different men lend depth to an engaging mystery.

The crux of this involving mystery involves an error made by three medicine men years before that is coming back to haunt them, possibly quite literally. A shotgun blast into Chee's trailor and his visions that follow make for a perfect blend of police work and Navajo mystisism. A great personal loss by Chee and a resignation by Leaphorn that there may indeed be merit in the older Navaho ways frame a character driven and atmospheric mystery set in the world of the Navajo.

Those unfamiliar with Hillerman's mystery series will find this PBS film very entertaining. Viewed on its own merit, this is a mystery painted in raw and burnt siennas on a canvas perhaps too small to include every detail. It does, however, give a fine impression of a life unfamilar to most of us, and makes for a great mystery.",1220140800,,2250,4.836363636363636
1783874,1,B00006L93O,"Hillerman does not know Navajo life and culture, and the plot is totally alein to Navajo people and culture.  Those actors and actresses in the movie are not Navajos, do not act or look like Navajos, and the scenecry is not like Navajo land.  This is a story about a fictive tribe and culture that exists in the minds of Hillerman and Redford.  The Navajo Nation totally rejected this movie when it was shown to them, and that is why it was not filmed in Navajoland and does not use Navajo actors.",1141430400,4,497,4.380434782608695
1783875,1,B00006L93O,Typical Hollywood mangling of a great book. Read the book instead. But the book is tougher on the reader than some other Hillerman books.,1138579200,5,137,4.75
1783876,5,B00006L93O,"Skinwalkers is the first film featuring Native American police officers Lt. Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee, who are responsible for officiating crime on a Navajo Reservation.

A Skinwalker is a sorcerer or witch that takes animal form, and commits terrible crimes, including murder. Traditionally, Navajos never say the word Skinwalker, for fear that a Skinwalker will take their life. Skinwalkers practice ""bad medicine"".

In Skinwalkers, a Native American Medicine Man (Healer) is found dead, his body surrounded by animal-like footprints, and his hand lacerated by a human-bone arrow, a traditional weapon of a Skinwalker.

Chee, struggling between his professionalism and traditional beliefs, feels the killer is a Skinwalker. Leaphorn, a city-reared Native American who's beginning to understand his Native roots, has no doubt the killer is a man who is hunting down Healers.

Together, Leaphorn and Chee seek to protect another Healer from the mysterious killer, and they slowly decrypt Navajo evidence that could lead to a ghostkiller or mankiller.

Skinwalkers weaves together thrilling Navajo folklore and art, mesmerizing copper-hued glowing landscapes, meditative musical lines, and harsh Native American reality - poverty, violence, anger, hurt, and an excruciatingly painful elimination of Native American tradition.",1128729600,5,1324,5.804123711340206
1783877,1,B00006L93O,"Never have I seen such a good book turned into such a bad movie.  Simply put, when compared to the book the movie was horrid.  Leaphorn as a bumbling, ignorant around the fort Indian?  Chee (Adam Beach was a good choice here) losing control of his emotions and pulling out his service pistol?  Save your money on this one.",1123718400,4,322,4.406779661016949
1783878,1,B00006L93O,"I'm not a purist, but I object to this movie.  Like other reviewers in this list, I was really appalled by two things:

(1) The assassination of Joe Leaphorn's character.  What were they thinking?

(2) The wholesale elimination of the original plot.  In this movie the wrong people get murdered by the wrong person for the wrong reasons.  In the book the deadly shotgun-toting witch-killer is a deranged young female with a dying baby.  You will look for her in vain in the movie.  How can an adaptation of a murder mystery casually write the murderer out of the plot?

The book has one of the most righteous endings you'll ever see.  The movie?  Jeez.  Let's all stand in the middle of a stream and shoot at each other!

Is it a good movie?  If you never read the book, the movie is OK.  If you are looking for ""Skinwalkers,"" it isn't here.

(""Coyote Waits,"" however, was pretty well done. Don't give up the ship.)",1109030400,12,915,4.454545454545454
1783879,5,B00006L93O,"If you want to see dramatic films about American Indians, you're in a lot of trouble. I'm obviously not talking about the old black and white western movies where a bunch of Indians sweep down on a log fort manned by soldiers, or launch an assault on a wagon train in order to scalp a bunch of settlers. I'm not talking about movies where one or two scenes with Indians fits into the larger picture. I'm not even talking about documentaries about Indians. What I'm talking about are fictional films centering solely on Indian characters, films with a mostly Indian cast, and films made by Indians. This is where Chris Eyre comes in. The director of the powerful ""Skins"" turns in another bravura effort with ""Skinwalkers,"" an adaptation of a Tony Hillerman novel of the same name. While I haven't read the book and thus cannot comment on whether Eyre's movie is faithful to the printed page, I can say the movie is a phenomenally entertaining murder mystery story. In fact, Eyre made the film for PBS's ""Mystery"" program. According to an extra on the DVD, Robert Redford helped finance the film and served as a sort of hands off executive producer.

There's a big problem on the Navajo reservation. Someone, or something, killed one of the more prominent shamans out on a road in the middle of nowhere. Investigating the crime are two cops, Joe Leaphorn (Wes Studi) and Jim Chee (Adam Beach). The two men couldn't be more different in style and substance. Leaphorn lived off the reservation for years, working as a cop in the big city until his wife Emma (Sheila Tousey) insisted they return to the reservation. His years away have instilled in the man a deep-seated ignorance of Indian life and a suspicion for anything that he cannot prove with solid evidence. Chee, on the other hand, is not only an up and coming cop on the tribal police force with an eye on moving into the top job, he's also studying to become a shaman. It is Chee who indicates that the cryptic evidence left at the crime scene hints at an ancient evil called a skinwalker, or a demonic force (for lack of a better term) that assumes the shape of others to carry out nefarious deeds. Leaphorn scoffs at such nonsense, preferring instead to focus the investigation on tracking down potential human enemies of the murder victim.

The mystery behind the killing assumes even greater dimensions when Chee and several other shamans become targets. Someone goes to the extreme step of blasting Chee's house with a shotgun in an effort to kill the cop. The investigation of the crime widens as Leaphorn and Chee learn that an environmental disaster some years ago might shed some light on events unfolding now. A subplot involving the return of Emma Leaphorn's illness, as well as one about a budding relationship between Chee and prosecutor Janet Pete (Alex Rice) move to center stage from time to time. Too, the smart as a whip physician at the tribal hospital, Doctor Stone (Michael Greyeyes) eventually plays a prominent role in the proceedings. I could give you more by stringing these disparate threads together, but I don't want to ruin the film for you. ""Skinwalkers"" is an incredible murder mystery film that fully engages the viewer from the opening scene and never lets up. There are so many potential suspects in the story that I almost thought I was watching an Italian giallo without the black gloves and gore.

I saw the film as an effort to show how two competing cultures can compliment one another during a crisis. Chee is obviously the Indian with the knowledge and background necessary to handle the spiritual side of the case. Leaphorn's hardheaded realism and his ability to look at things in a purely analytical sense help clear hurdles as well. Eyre, at least in the two films of his I have seen, seems to be a guy who refuses to place political correctness at the center of his work. He did refer to a few festering points of contention with whites in ""Skins,"" but these issues never consumed a film he made to showcase people on reservations as human beings with both good and bad personality traits. He does the same thing in ""Skinwalkers,"" preferring to focus on making an entertaining whodunit without harping on controversial issues. On the other hand, Eyre does take a jab at Studi's character when we see him sitting in his house on the reservation looking up information about skinwalkers on the Internet instead of walking outside to tap the vast knowledge of his people, but by the end of the film Leaphorn learns that the people here know helpful things that could assist him. By the way, I take issue with people who criticize this film by pointing out that the actors butchered the Navajo language, the setting was all wrong for the reservation, and other nitpicky points. C'mon people! It's a movie! The next time I see a film about World War II, easily identifiable Germans who speak the language fluently better play all of the German roles. Sheesh.

Eyre's picture is a massively entertaining film that will delight fans of the mystery genre. A comprehensive making of featurette included as an extra runs through all the paces. Oddly enough, we learn that James Redford, Bobby's son, wrote the screenplay. An obvious case of nepotism to be sure. You would think they tried to get Tony Hillerman to write the adaptation (unless the author passed away or something). I would definitely watch ""Skinwalkers"" again, and probably will if I get the chance. I can't wait to check out ""Smoke Signals"" in the next few days. I want to see if Chris Eyre can go three for three.",1097107200,13,5574,4.719712525667351
1783880,1,B00006L93O,"I was really looking forward to PBS - Mystery! bringing Tony Hillerman to life.  And this SO does not do it.  The previous Lou Diamond Philips - Fred Ward treatment, _Dark Wind_ is such an improvement.  First off, the film characters are more true the book characters.  Second, the film plot resembles the book.  And finally, in the close captioning on Dark Wind, it tries hard to render the Dine' into English.  In this version, it's ""Speaking Navajo.""  (Eyes rolling upward.)  I wasted my time with this one and with _Coyote Waits_, and won't bother again.",1076889600,2,558,4.739583333333333
1783910,4,B00006L93O,"Skinwalkers is definitely not a movie for everyone.  There is no swearing, no steamy sex scenes, no perversions, no drugs and people actually show respect to each other.  Even the few scenes of killings etc. are mild compared to what we see today in many films.  I enjoy Tony Hillerman books not because of the great plots but because of the lessons taught about the lives and beliefs of the Navajo people.  The scenery is beautiful, the people are interesting and its a step ""outside"" our own personal boxes.  This is a great movie and one for the family to watch together.",1076198400,3,574,4.588235294117647
1783911,4,B00006L93O,"Fans of Tony Hillerman all know about his exceptional research, which make his Southwestern mysteries a pleasure to read. Since these films have been geared for the PBS audience (many of whom have never read Hillerman before) the tone is changed, and somewhat simplified. This is in addition to the necessary editing that happens whenever a book is adapted into a film. If you've read several of the mysteries featuring Jim Chee and Lt. Leaphorn, expect to be a little disappointed. There just is not time to do their characters (let alone Emma and Janet Pete) justice.
Movies featuring Native Americans are few and far between - like ""Smoke Signals"" (also starring Adam Beach), ""Windtalkers"" (funny how many years it took to make a movie about the Windtalkers in WWII, and even then much of it centers on Nicholas Cage's character, instead of Adam Beach) ""Pow Wow Highway"", even ""Dances with Wolves"". It's somewhat of a coup that PBS and Robert Redford have developed this picture, with plans for more.
While this is not the classic that ""Smoke Signals"" was, it does capture the slower pace of the Navajo Nation. Unlike episodes of ""The X-Files"", ""Roswell,"" and ""Star Trek: The Next Generation,"" Native rituals and medicine men are presented as part of a living spirituality, one that exists in everyday life on the reservation. No one shows up to give Wil Wheaton or David Duchovny a vision quest, and (thankfully) there are no aliens.",1069545600,8,1437,4.89344262295082
1783912,3,B00006L93O,"This 2002 made-for-TV film is adapted from one of Tony Hillerman's books.  His name does not appear in the writing credits though.  The writing is credited to James Redford, son of Robert Redford, the Executive Producer.
The story is basically a crime mystery and  includes a lot of Native American folklore.  It's set in the present, on a reservation.  Some medicine men have been brutally murdered, and two cops are looking for the killer.  Adam Beach is cast as the cop who is studying to be a medicine man himself; Wes Studi is also a Native American but he considers himself much more practical and modern in his approach.
The plot is confusing as it twists and turns and I found it almost impossible to follow.  There's a paint factory that polluted the land and people getting sick.  There are medicine men who chose modern medicine over traditional ways.  There's the wife of one of the cops who has come back to the reservation to die.  And there's a romance between Adam Beach and an attractive young female Native American lawyer who learns to appreciate traditional ways.
Neither the mystery nor the human stories are presented very well and I found myself bored throughout.",1059091200,3,1186,4.769607843137255
1783913,3,B00006L93O,"This movie captures some of the Leaphorn and Chee feelings from Hillerman's excellent books, but the plot is not the one in the Skinwalkers book.  The plot is not bad, it just doesn't happen to be the same.  There are elements which are similar, such as the attack on Chee and the witchcraft element, but many other items in the movie have nothing to do with the book storyline.  Elements from other Hillerman books have been added to this movie.  For example, Emma has a recurrance of cancer in the movie, while in the book Leaphorn is concerned about Alzheimers.  The juvenile delinquents in the movie are nothing from the book, the motive to the shooting at Chee is totally different, and the motive for the killings is totally diffent.  it's not a bad plot, it's just a completely different story from the book by the same name.
Perhaps for me the most disappointing is it appears the movie was not made on the reservation, so location shots are wrong.  There is some, but many other locations appear to be desert locations in Arizona which have very different vegetation and topography than the Shiprock - Farmington - Chinle - Window Rock area where this is supposed to be.  One scene even had saguaro catus - impossible!  I'll have to watch it a few more times to really place the movie locations.
The acting is good, but I thought they gave Leaphorn a different personality from the book.  Adam Beach is good, as is Janet Peete.  I am not disappointed I bought the video, but it was not all of what I was hoping for.",1056844800,7,1524,4.525547445255475

1783915,4,B00006L93O,"1.  OK, so it isn't the book.  Not word for word, not even in many respects the plot--so what?  The first movie from a Hillerman novel, The Dark Wind, was the book, all the different plot lines, and while the book was really good, it was way too convoluted for a movie.  I certainly don't blame the producer for opting for a plot which a moviewatcher could follow.
2.  Given that, they did a very good job of keeping the Navajo mysticism, yet making a movie one could follow without having to have read the book first.  I heartily recommend this movie to anyone interested in a good mystery, Tony Hillerman's work, reservation life, or Navajo culture.  It isn't completely any of the last three, but it is an introduction to all of them while it is completely a good mystery.
3.  Jim Chee is one of my favorite characters in literature.  Adam Beach is probably too good looking to fit my image of Chee, but for sure he captured the spirit of Chee from the novels.  The character of Joe Leaphorn is largely different from the novels and I wish they hadn't made that departure.  But that said, the movie Leaphorn is a solid detective and once I got used to the difference I got over it.  Not the same as the novel, but see #1 above.  Would you rather have no movie, or have one with some changes?
I choose to have the movie.  I choose to get over being a purist. I've only seen two movies ever which seemed to be almost rigidly true to their novels, and both of those movies were falures. I enjoyed this movie, and there wasn't anything in it which conflicts with the themes and spirit of Hillerman's novels.
4.  The women in the movie do not have the screen time the men do, but their parts are important to the script and very well played by the actresses.  The movie does keep Leaphorn's tender devotion to his wife, which is really well done, and Chee's conflicting feelings and relationship with Janet Pete are both realistic and well played.
5.  When I say I'll take the movie I'm not suggesting that it is some kind of consolation prize.  It's a good movie in it's own right.  I wasn't completely spellbound, so I only give it four stars, but I gave it four because it deserves them.  If you want to sit there and compare it to the novel, give it penalty points for each variance, go ahead and be a disappointed purist.  But if you like good, well acted, mystery movies, particularly ones with an introduction to another culture, you will be glad you chose this one.
More, Mr. Redford, give us more of these excellent adaptations of Tony Hillerman's absolutely excellent work and characters.",1046649600,35,2596,4.446088794926005

7971090,3,B00006L93O,"""Sun will be created - They say he has planned it all.""
Skinwalkers are witches in the Navaho legends and can fly or turn themselves into a dog or wolf. This mystery involves the conflict between Skinwalkers and shamen and belegana medicine. Then again it may be a straightforward set of independent murders. In any event it looks like some one is out to kill Navajo Tribal Police Officer Jim Chee and he has not got a clue as to why.

As with all of Tony Hillerman's stories you have the feeling you are there. In fact if you have visited or live in the area (Four Corners canyons) that the mystery takes part in, you will be better able to identify with the people and landmarks. And as with his other books there is an overt and covert story.

This is the TV version of Skinwalkers with Robert Redford. He has a habit of redfordizing (twisting) stories for his own agenda. This book was so strongly written that I thought Redford did not have a chance to modify it. I was wrong. He changed the whole underlying primes of the story. One may think that Redford did not read the book although history has shown him to have modified several stories to suit his agenda such as ""Three Days of the Condor."" Maybe due to time constraints many of the Navaho traditions that make Hillerman's work unique were glossed over.

The book is much more in depth and the motive and additional characters made the mystery much more intriguing. Even the previous attempt at Hillerman films ""Dark Wind"" was closer to the feel. However on the positive side without Redford would anyone have made this TV film?",1503100800,,1590,4.513888888888889
