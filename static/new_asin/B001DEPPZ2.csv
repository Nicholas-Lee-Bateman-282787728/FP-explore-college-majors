8293059,5,B001DEPPZ2,"There are four parts:
1) The Extremes - like extreme speed, extreme saftey, extreme luxury...etc

2) The Body - Obviously is about new and different design styles of automobiles

3) The Fuel - talks about hydrogen bio diesel electric, & more. It was also one of the earliest appearences of the Tesla Roadster.

4) The Brain - My favorite part of all. It talks about integrating technology into vehicles. Driver-less cars anyone? Cars that communicate with the vehicles around them to prevent accidents and traffic jams. They show the ""concept"" of a car that can slam on the brakes before you would be able to react. The cool thing about this is that the auto industry and google seem to be doing these things already, even though the show predicts this to happen by the year 2030.",1397088000,,780,4.678832116788321
8293060,2,B001DEPPZ2,"A very interesting show on automotive technology for the future. Some very good segments on battery, hydrogen, and diesel fuels.  There are a few segments that discuss technology that could never exist, in particular is a narration on air powered cars (ep 5). The narrator flat out says that a compressed air driven car could recharge it self and provide perpetual motion. Science shows should be vetted by at least a high school science teacher. Very disappointing for such a otherwise well done show.",1219449600,2,502,4.976190476190476
