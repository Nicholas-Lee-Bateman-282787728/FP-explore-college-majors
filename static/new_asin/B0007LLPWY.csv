2218968,5,B0007LLPWY,"My 3 year old & 5 year old LOVE these movies! Ties in well with their tball games & long summer days playing with kids in the neighborhood.  Although there are some naughty words & name-calling, my kids know what words & actions are right & wrong so they know not to repeat those parts of the movies-or they will not be able to watch these favorite movies anymore.  More importantly, my kids enjoy watching the comraderie between the kids in the movies, see the importance of practice to get better at a sport, they see that friends come in different shapes & sizes, with different quirks & levels of talent & best of all that the ""coolest"" guy in the movie is especially cool because he sticks up for the underdog.",1181520000,3,715,4.409090909090909
2218969,1,B0007LLPWY,"I do not understand how a movie can be deemed for the family with words like SH** etc, in it.  What kind of ""FAMILY"" thinks profanity is OK? Not just profanity but profanity coming from CHILDREN!!!!! FALSE ADVERTISEMENT! or what?  No, I did not complete even the first movie once I heard the ""S"" word.  I was afraid to even play the second one.  So I am out of the cost of the two DVD's.  The only thing they are fit for is the garbage.

Thank you for this opportunity.",1142380800,2,469,4.155555555555556
2218970,1,B0007LLPWY,"This movie is the worst movie that has ever been made. You hear people make those kind of statements all the time, and they are usaully just thrown around for the sake of emphasis. Make no mistake, when I say this movie is the worst movie of all time, I am dead serious. From now on if someone ever asks me what my least favorite movie is, I will tell them, The Sandlot 2.

I really have no idea what the makers of this movie were trying to accomplish with this film. The plot is essentially exactly the same as the first. The first Sandlot by the way was an excellent movie and I highly reccommend it to ANYONE. It is practically like the makers of Sandlot 2 just took the exaclt same plot and swapped out charecters names, dates, places etc. and basically re-made the first. I guess it was inevitable that half of the charecters were replaced by girls, and of course, love became a new aspect of the movie. This was a pathetic mistake. These kids are only around the age of 12 and the whole ""love"" thing just doesn't fit this movie.

I could literally go on and on, listing hundreds and hundreds of ridiculous details about this movie. Even to this very day EVERY-TIME I think of absolutly ANYTHING about this movie, it angers me. Do not buy this movie unless you are buying it for a 4 year old kid.

Anyone who likes this movie has not seen the first.",1117324800,,1354,4.28125
2218971,5,B0007LLPWY,"When I was babysitting my cousins last year with my friend, they had The Sandlot with them and my friend and I had never watched it so we did when my cousins were sleeping and we fell in love with the movie and its characters, then in April of this year, we found out about the sequel and we rented it, which I must say is just about as good as the first one if not as good or better. The plot lines are a bit similar and a bit different, both have a kissing scene (First movie: Squints and Lifeguard, Second: Fingers and Kissing booth chick), and both have something lost over the fence where the dog is (First movie: baseball, Second: Rocket) and both have a Smalls, (First: Scotty Smalls, Second: His brother Johnny Smalls) and both have a character with a wise mouth (First: Ham, Second: Mac) but the Sandlot 2 has girls on their team, Hayley, Jenny, and Penny and they actually deal with a first love unlike in the first one when there was a crush on the lifeguard. Plus, the first one does deal more with baseball than the second one does...oh yeah, and both movies have insanely gorgeous guys (First: Benny, Second: David), but both movies are awesome.

Both movies are really funny and enjoyable, I'm definitely buying this pack. And if you liked the first one, there is a pretty good chance you'll like the second one.

My brother absolutley adored The Sandlot and refused to watch the sequel, but then he saw me and my friend watching it so he thought he would just give it a shot, and he liked it. So if you liked the first one, like I said, there's a good chance you'll like the sequel too.",1117324800,11,1602,4.336666666666667
2218972,1,B0007LLPWY,"Sandlot 1 is a true classic but part 2 is horrible. It just makes the box set even more trashy because it also comes with part 1. Part 2 is almost the same exact thing and the first. [see the movie and you will know what I mean.] I say just buy the original and don't even look at the second no matter what kind of fan you are or how tempted you may get. Might as well sell this movie and just copy it and put it in the set with a new cover, add some new characters and kiss the box before you ship it out. The director hangs his head in shame over this one.",1116633600,,558,3.73728813559322
2218973,3,B0007LLPWY,"i'll alwasy reemmber the first, the 2nd not as good as first but my nieces, nephews still liked it",1113696000,,98,4.2105263157894735
2218974,1,B0007LLPWY,"I haven't seen this movie, and I never plan to. The Sandlot is one of the best movies I have ever seen and they go and make a sequel! I can't believe they would stoop so low to make another one. I refuse to see this movie and I encourage you to do the same. POOR CHOICE!!",1109721600,,271,3.7719298245614037
