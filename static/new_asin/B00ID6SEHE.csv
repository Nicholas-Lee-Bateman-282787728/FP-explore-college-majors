6258707,4,B00ID6SEHE,A very watchable film.,1457136000,,22,4.75
6258708,5,B00ID6SEHE,An outstanding widescreen and color transfer from the Universal Vault Series. The movie itself is great too. Rock Hudson gives a terrific performance and the unjustly forgotten Cornell Borchers is both beautiful and affecting. A wonderful movie in every respect.,1453680000,,262,5.575

6258710,5,B00ID6SEHE,I have been looking for this movie for years. I was so glad to finally get it. I loved the story. The picture quality is very good and so is the sound.,1450483200,3,151,3.75
6258711,4,B00ID6SEHE,"Another winner from the Universal Vault series.  Very good picture quality (in vibrant color and in full widescreen). It looks great on my wide flat screen tv.  It's a typical 1950s soap opera from Universal and if you like that kind of movie, I highly recommend it.",1450137600,6,266,4.638297872340425
6258712,5,B00ID6SEHE,"My question is WHY did it take SO LONG for Universal to put this movie out on DVD.  Because to me it is one of Rock Hudson's BEST movies that he did in the early part of his career. And he did it with I think the BEST DIRECTOR for Rock Hudson. Douglas Sirk with all do respect to Jerry Hopper since he is credited and Douglas Sirk is NOT. I think Douglas Sirk had more involvement in the making of this film than we realize he did. Because we see a side to Rock Hudson in this film that we rarely IF EVER see again in ANY of Rock Hudson's later films. Rock Hudson is just FANTASTIC in this film. And people who have seen this film fall in love with it because it is such a different kind of Rock Hudson film  than people are used to seeing.  Check it out, You may love this TRULY FORGOTTEN GEM of a film made in the year of GIANT and WRITTEN ON THE WIND also.",1448236800,14,859,3.8971428571428572

8641017,4,B00ID6SEHE,"I had searched for this movie for years before finding it on Amazon. If you like somewhat cheesy, melodramatic old movies (I do) then this will be an enjoyable watch.",1518480000,,166,4.566666666666666

This is such a wonderful movie. Even though the imdb mentions Jerry Hopper (and Sirk only as uncredited co-director), Douglas Sirk's style shines through. So in case you've enjoyed ""All that Heaven allows"" and ""Magnificent Obsession"", you might want to watch this one as well.

Attention!!! SPOILER!!!

The only plot hole I could detect is the missing baby book. Why would Rock Hudson leave his daughters baby photos behind in their apartment in Vienna, before moving to CA?",1465776000,,508,5.035714285714286
