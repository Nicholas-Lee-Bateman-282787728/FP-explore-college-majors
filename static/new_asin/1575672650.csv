8095455,5,1575672650,"This is one of the Moody Science Classics, filmed in 1967, and now available on DVD.  This 28-minute DVD focuses on aviation.  Besides seeing our narrator Dr. Irwin Moon (with his son as co-pilot) taking-off in and flying a plane, we learn a lot of interesting information.  The main thrust of this DVD is the importance of trusting in the instruments, even when they seem to contradict your senses.  There was a wonderful demonstration of spatial disorientation with a trained gymnast who should be more aware of where his body is and what it is doing.  There are several aviation disasters that we learn about, the result of pilots going by what they ""felt"" was right, in poor flying conditions when the instruments disagreed.  I found this all very fascinating.  Then, in the end, this is tied to spiritual things, where what we feel to be right may be in error.  The Bible is our instrument panel.

Overall, this was very entertaining and educational.  It is one of my favorites of the Moody Science classics.  The cinematography is not as crisp as something produced today, but this isn't a big problem.  And as you can see from the other review, a pilot states that the aviation information is still relevant today.  I'd recommend this video to Christian families, especially homeschooling families.",1265846400,,1305,4.850678733031674

Good spatial disorientation demonstration!  While this was filmed in the late 60's, the information is as relavent today as it was then, overall a good addition to any pilot's library, and a great price at Amazon.",1256515200,,425,5.144927536231884
