6152829,1,B00HAHJK84,"Where to start with this movie.

The acting was pathetic, even for ""found-film"" standards. Every single person was a transparent interpretation of an archetype, such as the 'awkward boy with troubled past', 'sky girl with daddy issues', or 'obvious sociopath'.

The writing was abysmal. Every line and comment was stilted, and the story could not have been slower or more boring. I almost fell asleep three times in the first 30 minutes, and in that time, a grand sum of nothing had taken place except the above-mentioned horrid acting - no actual plot-growth what-so-ever. Only after skipping ahead to the 60 minute mark did I even get the point was a psychopath carrying out some Waco-like, ""Heaven's Gate"" nonsense.

The camerawork was standard fare for found-footage, with one exception: they could not decide what the focus was (or the focus button on the camera, at times). There were plenty of times where the shot was slightly askew, but not in an artsy ""make you uncomfortable way on purpose"" way, but in the ""I paid my cousin to film this for me, and he is twelve years old"" way.

All-in-all, this was a complete waste of time. I tend to give movies a break, but this one is going in my short list of truly awful flicks, alongside titles like ""Blue Valentine"" and ""Nympha"". I would give this zero stars, but no such option exists. If you like interesting horror flicks, stay away at all costs. And if you are interested in watching the crazy cult mentality in a film, just watch a documentary on an actual one. At least then any terrible performance by the cult leader just means the guy was a true-to-life lunatic with terrible communication skills and a misunderstanding of human mannerisms.",1405728000,3,1703,4.762711864406779

6152832,2,B00HAHJK84,"Ellen (Hannah Levien) gets a letter from her sister Janet who has joined a cult in in the Mexican desert. She opts to join up with Simon Leach's (Bill Oberst Jr.) group. We know from the opening filming the man is a phoney. The most comical thing is his generic ""Certificate of Achievement"" he has proudly framed and hung on his wall dating back to the 1990's. ""Holy Ghost People"" has a similar plot and is the better of the two films.

I will say, I liked the acting and even some of the characters. In fact the film went no where for a long time as we watched people wash clothes and play kickball leading up to their ""transition moment"" made boring by the hand held genre. When our gang wasn't engaged in boring activities, they gave equally boring interviews about their life to fill all 88 minutes.

Not recommended, even as a rental. 2 stars is generous.

6152834,5,B00HAHJK84,"For me, true horror is reading a book or watching a film that could actually happen in the realm of plausibilityor is based on events that have happened.  Theres no fiction more shocking than reality, for sure.  When I read the plot synopsis for CHILDREN OF SORROW, a chill ran down my spine; it is something that you might read in todays news headlines, so I knew I had to see it.  And WOWIm glad I watched it.  It is a brutal and realistic depiction of the cult mentality and just how dangerous they can be.

I wasn't sure what to expect going into this one.  I have been fascinated by cults for a long time, so I hoped this film wasn't going to be too far-fetched to enjoy.  I am happy to report the production team does an excellent job, and the result is a gripping and taut horror flick that youve got to see.

CHILDREN OF SORROW is shot well, although it is filmed entirely on hand-held cameras and a couple of security feeds.  This works perfectly, though, and fits the story like a glove.  The cameras have a couple of different perspectives:  one from Father Simon, one from his assistant, one from Ellen (the girl looking for answers about her sister), and then the security cameras.  This might sound distracting or confusing, but its not.  The different angles are woven together skillfully, like an intricate design on fabric.

The acting is excellent as well.  I never once found myself in a state of disbelief in regard to any of the characters.  Bill Oberst, Jr. gives the performance of his career as Father Simon.  He gracefully transitions from sick, sadistic manipulator to caring overseer in the blink of an eye.  Likewise, his children do a great job in their roles as well.

Theres also some very nice gore in CHILDREN OF SORROW.  I am particularly impressed with the first death scene, where a young man poisons himself.  Im not sure why, but this performance leapt out at me, as did the special effects.  They are simple but very effective.

If I were forced to find a flaw with this film, I would have to say there are a couple of camera shots that are almost too shaky to tell whats happening.  This only happens twice, I believe, so its nothing that really detracts from the film, but I do feel its worth mentioning.

CHILDREN OF SORROW is an epic win for me, and I suggest every horror fan check it out ASAP.  It is unnerving and unrelenting, a nightmarish trip into events that could really happen.  Give this one a look for sure.",1393804800,6,2461,4.47191011235955
6152835,5,B00HAHJK84,"The thing with most Indie films is that often times they will suffer in one area or another because of a lack of funding. It seems inevitable these days that a film either has a great cast or a great visual story. Thankfully, McClure seemed to have a strong grasp on the casting part of this conundrum. What had to be an emotionally draining experience on them, each and every cast member played their part to a tee. It's been a while since I've seen a film where the commitment of the actors was so fierce. Oberst dominates the screen (as always) and gives the performance of his career. It's hard to know his personality and imagine that he could even come close to capturing a character with this degree of sadism. He is nothing less than mesmerizing on screen, especially in this film. The perfect storm of perversity.

Shot in four different perspectives, Children of Sorrow delves deep into the inner workings of cult life. We get little glimpses from Hannah's camera as she secretly films her infiltration of the camp. Father Simon records his ventures citing posterity reasons. Mary (Whitney Nielsen) takes the reins when Simon decides he wants to be in front of the camera. Lastly, we have the security cameras. This is where we get to see the true Father Simon. In front of the camera, he may seem like a confident, loving person but behind the scenes, he's really a self hating, manipulative, controlling con artist that gets off on playing with people's emotions. In my opinion, there is nothing more horrifying than the deliberate terror that one human can inflict on another and writer Finnerty weaves quite an entangling web of truly intense horror.

While I thoroughly enjoyed this film and will highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a hard core psychological horror, I did feel at some point the direction of the film got lost. I'll explain... the first quarter to half of the film, the main focus seems to be all about Hannah finding her sister but somewhere in the midst of this, it shifts and becomes all about Father Simon. It's possible that it was intentional and that the more she became seduced into the family, the more irrelevant her story became. In which case, I would've liked to have seen a smoother transition into that story line. However, this absolutely does not take away from the fact that this is a truly terrifying look into the cult psyche. Forget jump scares and things that go bump in the night, this is how real horror is done.",1390780800,9,2473,4.65675057208238

8631331,4,B00HAHJK84,"Children of Sorrow features Bill Oberst Jr. as a cult leader in this Found Footage hidden gem.

You won't hear about this in any top 10 list of the genre but it definitely is better than most of the small budget attempts.

Was glad to find this and recommend it to fans of FF, not so much for average horror fans.",1474156800,,313,4.114754098360656

8631334,2,B00HAHJK84,It is a very predictable cult movie with gratuitous violence and no real plot. Watching it was better than watching paint dry I suppose.,1454198400,,136,4.708333333333333

8631337,4,B00HAHJK84,"I want to go 3.5 stars on this one. I almost flipped it off when I saw the shaky camera action (a la Blair Witch, horrible movie that was) but I stuck with it. It is supposed to be something like a documentary based on a true story. it is like a Jonestown type of thing. Criminal reverend gets a bunch of kids that are emotional wrecks and uses them and then well, I won't say much more but if this truly happened....The performances are all good by the kids and the reverend Bill Oberst Jr. is really pretty scary sometimes. if you can deal with the shaky camera thing (that is why it lost 1.5 stars) check it out. it is a frightening movie about how some people can exert control over others.",1417651200,,694,4.186567164179104
8631338,1,B00HAHJK84,"Ok people I'm going to tell you all of the reasons why you should pass on this film.
1.) It doesn't 'start' until an hour into it.
2.) You don't feel for any characters because they're not developed well.
3.) It's more crude than scary.
4.) The main actor is awful.
5.) The Sacrament is way better!!!",1410307200,,300,4.280701754385965
