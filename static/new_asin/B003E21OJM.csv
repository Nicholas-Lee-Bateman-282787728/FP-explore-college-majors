8395258,4,B003E21OJM,"This is a good basic workout. Covers all the bases and includes some strength training. It's a typical Leslie walking workout with older exercisers. If you could skip past the boring introduction it would be less annoying. She does talk throughout, but that's expected. Overall, a solid workout that is not too difficult and gets the job done.",1467504000,,343,4.931034482758621
8395259,2,B003E21OJM,"If you could delete the way-too-long intro & unnecessary promo talk, it would be an ok walk program. I've used it once & may or may not use it again when bored w/ other LS DVD's.",1399248000,,178,3.9722222222222223
8395260,5,B003E21OJM,Did this tape at a friend's house.  Was fun and easy to complete.  Look forward to making this exercise a part of my routine.,1395360000,,125,4.166666666666667
8395261,2,B003E21OJM,"This DVD is not very good.  Leslie Sansone talks, and talks, and talks.  The music is so low that I cannot hear it.  Because I can't hear the beat and she is talking incessantly, I have a very difficult time keeping in step. It's really not a good buy.",1339372800,,252,4.1020408163265305
