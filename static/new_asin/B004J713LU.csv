8431742,5,B004J713LU,"I liked this documentry on Ronald Reagan so much when I saw it on the History Channel that I had to add it to my personal libary.  This production shows the Reagan, both in public and personal life, giving you the full spectrum of his life.  This is, in my opinion, the best documentary on Ronald Reagan that has ever been made.",1333152000,6,328,4.274193548387097
8431743,4,B004J713LU,"This DVD on Ronald Reagan attempts to show his life, his humor and most of all his legacy.
There are no extras and no subtitles in this 94 minute presentation. It uses newsreel and Hollywood footage and talking heads such as Colin Powell and Sam Donaldson.

When Reagan ran for president in 1980, 1 in 10 Americans were out of work and hostages were being held in Iran. There is little mentioned about any role the hostages and the failed rescue attempt by Carver had in the election. What is emphasized is the economy and ""Are you better off now...""
We hear Reagan's thoughts about entering the White House as President; but what is emphasized is the part of the assassination attempt at the Hilton Hotel in DC. The story then jumps back to his boyhood and formative years and his career in Hollywood.

There is an interesting irony told by Reagan's lead secret Service agent, Jerry Parr, who saved his life by sending the car to the hospital instead of returning to the White House after Reagan was shot. Parr wanted to be a Secret Service agent from a young age, after seeing a movie `The Code of the Secret Service""...starring - Ronald Reagan.

What does become irritating is the constant popping back and forth from Reagan's past to the time of the assassination. It is disconcerting to have this constant back and forth. It is a dramatic element that absolutely does not work.

We do see how this brush with death changes both him and Nancy, she becomes more protective and consults astrologers, and he turns more to his faith and a sense of destiny, to do something lasting with his presidency. This is an instructive video on Reagan's legacy.",1319414400,8,1650,4.640410958904109
