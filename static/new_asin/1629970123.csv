5000553,5,1629970123,"This title from The Great Courses series is unlike any other ""travel show"" you'll find on Amazon. The focus is on learning, and how wonderfully refreshing that is, since there's so much to learn about these cities!

If you are the type who likes to get to know the history and meaning of the places you are visiting, then Professor Bartlett is your perfect guide. If you are just looking for a 1-day itinerary and a good restaurant recommendation, then look elsewhere.",1416441600,2,468,4.7073170731707314
5000554,5,1629970123,"One of their best classes and instructors.  If you love travel or just learning about places I recommend it.  This is one you'll enjoy whether you have visited there, want to visit or are just an armchair traveler",1392336000,3,213,4.578947368421052

5000558,1,1629970123,"Save your money, not worth the price of admission. This would have been a fine video circa 1970.",1435622400,,96,4.388888888888889
5000559,2,1629970123,"I wish I could give this series a better review. I was predisposed both to like it and to want others to watch it, but it suffers from having apparently been made as cheaply as possible. I was expecting the camera to roam around the areas the narrator was describing, but instead there were a few stock shots (which were showed over and over) interspersed with the narrator talking in a room that was cheaply devised to look like an antiquarian's study. We saw the narrator standing in this room for the greater part of the ""tour,"" rather than actually touring the areas described. This is a pet peeve of mine, and I find it quite inexplicable. Who really thinks that someone who has chosen a video purporting to tour medieval Europe will be satisfied with looking at the tour guide rather than taking the tour?",1435017600,6,811,4.561643835616438

5000562,1,1629970123,"Educational. But stiff, dry and low production value. You'll only see pictures, poor ones, of the medieval cities he describes.",1427673600,,127,5.4
5000563,5,1629970123,"Fantastic ""tour"" of medieval cities of Europe.  Dr. Bartlett is an engaging and enthusiastic instructor.  I loved that it was organized by city versus time - one really had a feel for all the drama across Europe during this era.  Infinitely more educational than memorizing dates of wars.",1422835200,,288,4.958333333333333
5000564,5,1629970123,"This is an excellent series. Prof. Bartlett is highly knowledgeable and is an outstanding speaker. The photos which accompany the series really bring the presentation to life. It felt like I was part of a tour group, without any of the annoying crowds and long lines that actual tours can entail. Prof. Bartlett was a charming and engaging host, and he seamlessly interwove fascinating cultural and historical narratives into the descriptions of each city.

I highly recommend this series to anyone!",1418860800,2,499,5.160493827160494

8500052,4,1629970123,"This is a different style travel show than most others.  It is presented in lecture style and supplemented with some film, photos and maps to accompany what the lecturer is saying.  I would have liked a little more film on the places while the fellow was talking, but as I said, it is presented more as a college lecture than a full-blown travel show.  Taken in that sense, it serves its purpose.",1473984000,,396,4.472222222222222
