8721520,1,B008Y7Y0EI,"DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!!!! Would give it zero stars if I could.

This DVD is a 100% UNofficial release from Deep Purple. All the material on these discs comes from ""Phoenix Rising, The Deep Purple Anthology, and History Hits and Highlights"" which are all very good Deep Purple DVD's. The quality of this set is very poor and pixelated. Very low quality and a very low blow to ALL DEEP PURPLE FANS!!!! Not sure how this can be released or legal when almost 95% of the material is lifted from other official DP releases. the other 5% is from critics interviews not DP interviews.

Thanks for stealing my money!",1379808000,14,605,4.490909090909091
