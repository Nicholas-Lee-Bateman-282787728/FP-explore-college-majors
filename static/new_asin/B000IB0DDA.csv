2654328,5,B000IB0DDA,"What a great movie - great interaction between the characters.  The movie shows the hazards of fighting forest fires, how easy it is to be caught in a flashover and how not to panic - to carry a fireproof shelter everytime you go into the woods.  The show also highlights the decisions that park officials must abide by, whether they like it or not.  The policy of ""let it burn"" didn't take into consideration if ever a set of perfect circumstances in nature would develop that would challenge the soundness of that decision.",1323907200,,525,4.623655913978495
2654329,1,B000IB0DDA,"Do these people have ANY regard for accuracy?  The fire fighting was just as inaccurate.  This is a really terrible movie; so bad it is laughable.  The documentary on firefighting called ""Fighting Fire with Fire"" that comes with it is actually not nearly as bad (actually that's what I bought it for).",1261353600,,301,4.75
2654330,5,B000IB0DDA,"OK one word:  really?

Having fought fires for oh 6 years now I have a true appreciation for bad fire movies, i mean is this really what most people think we do for a living??!  The first half was so painful I almost had to turn it off...until the main character puts on a ""space suit"", mistakenly identified as nomex, and walks through fire (yes walks through fire). I was shocked at how many fire terms they had spewed off, but can only recall one being used right.

I love these cheezy wildland fire movies.  this one does have the most cheezetasteric fire shelter scene (hello thermometers?) This is below ""firestorm"" with howie long but above ""nature unleashed fire"". A fantastic cure for a hangover.  I would also recommend ""super fire"".",1239494400,6,743,4.633587786259542
2654331,4,B000IB0DDA,"Ideal film for the ironing. Quite exciting in places, didn't realise was based on fact (I think very loosely based on fact.) Good film would recommend.",1221350400,,151,4.846153846153846
2654332,5,B000IB0DDA,"Almost very educational - Yellowstone - Firefighters, their lives and dangers.

I must admit that I bought it because of Scott Foley from [The Unit] but the movie was well worth it.

The dangers are always real just never brought to our attention of all the dangers and risks that these men and women face when the blaze starts to take out millions of acre's of trees and park-lands.

I sure hope that the far shots of the blazes were not real - the up-close shots were too real.  It reminds me that we must remember these people in our prayers.  And hope that the government agencies are not as stupid and money-grubbing as they sound.  [Probably a forlorn hope.]

This movie is Definitely recommended for the more mature audience - and not for some twitchy kid that thinks starting a fire is a lark.",1181088000,11,801,4.482758620689655
2654333,5,B000IB0DDA,This is an excellent story. Richard Burgi and Scott Foley do a great job in telling of the forest fire fighters and their families. I enjoyed the extras of how Yellowstone was formed as well.,1179619200,8,191,4.485714285714286

8144709,1,B000IB0DDA,"The absolute worst fire movie I have ever seen and the profanity made it worse.
The only redeeming feature was the documentaries on yellowstone and wildland firefighters.
The disc was in great shape and the seller got it to me quickly. Have no complaint there.",1334534400,2,260,4.8
8144710,5,B000IB0DDA,Its about four young people on motorcyclists who get caught in one mans hatred for a forest ranger. It will keep your interest going as to how they will get out as the fire starts to surround them leving very little to no room to move.,1331596800,,235,4.130434782608695
