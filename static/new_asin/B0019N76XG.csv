3441738,5,B0019N76XG,I have been searching for season 3  on up and haven't located them on Amazon . Does anyone have a release date?  This is far 1 of the funniest shows on dvd and I cant wait to own the whole set. Season 1 and 2 is on its way to me. Bennie is hillarious and Carmen is so sneaky but George the dad is only trying to protect his daughter from the boys and look out for best interest.

3441783,5,B0019N76XG,"I enjoy the comedy antics of George Lopez and friends.  Considering the years gap between this release and
the first box set, I was hyped when I saw the 3rd season was finally released.  All the great stories are there, from
the on again off again relationship of Jason and Carmen to the hilarious insults exchanged between George and Benny,
I really enjoyed revisiting the season.  There is even a Disneyland tie in episode that I never knew existed until I bought
this set.  Not really that many special features to speak of, but the comedy of the series itself more than makes up for it.
Overall, for any George Lopez fan, this is a must get, especially for the price on Amazon.",1421884800,,681,4.512195121951219

3441798,5,B0019N76XG,"George Lopez is always funny. Always doing something crazy it seems in which his wife disapproves.

3441799,5,B0019N76XG,Can't go wrong if you appreciate the comical genius of George Lopez.  He has a dry sense of humor which is hysterical.  I love the entire cast.  There are not many sit coms out there that I appreciate.  I usually enjoy the classics.  This will become one of those.,1406678400,,264,4.3061224489795915
3441800,3,B0019N76XG,"These dvd's were supposed to have subtitles in Spanish and English, which is why I wanted it, and the subtitles were in English and French. The discs were delivered in excellent condition, but I wanted Spanish subtitles and didn't get that. There was an obvious misrepresentation in the description.",1404345600,,299,5.122448979591836
3441801,4,B0019N76XG,Nothing amazing is in this series but some funny bits overall in this season. Good enough in my own opinion.,1402963200,,108,4.45
3441802,5,B0019N76XG,I love watching George Lopez. This way I can watch it any time. It makes me laugh. My husband even likes watching the video's.

3441803,5,B0019N76XG,George Lopez is the best show ever! It's one of those sitcoms that no matter how many times you watch it you'll be laughing so hard you can't breathe. George and Benney's relationship is the funniest in the show (mom-son relationships).,1400976000,,236,4.780487804878049

3441818,5,B0019N76XG,"I am not of Mexican origin and  do not understand spanish but when Lopez would break from english and say something in spanish under his breath, I laugh because I think I know what he means .
I watched all of his episodes on TV and now I am trying to collect them all. It is too bad amazon do not sell a  complete collector set. I would snap it up.",1381190400,,348,3.887323943661972

3441820,5,B0019N76XG,My 15 year old daughter and I laughed out loud during every episode. It's so much fun to turn on a sitcom and know for certain that you'll be laughing all the way through it!!!,1377820800,7,176,4.057142857142857
3441821,5,B0019N76XG,"I gotta say when I first got into this show I didn't think I was gonna like it. Man, did I prove myself wrong! I love this show! I had just purchased the first 3 seasons and from the time I popped the first 2 season box set in to the end of season 3 I was crying from laughter. You get all the good stuff like human interest stories with George and his wife Angelina's daughter Carmen getting teased at school for being different then as a result she gets transferred to a better school environment. Then you find out that there youngest child Max has Dyslexia, a learning disability and he tries to cope with that. All sorts of great story lines that fit just perfectly in the world. Let us not forget George's smart mouthed short tempered mother Benita who is a definite tear jerk-er.

Now that the pleasantry's are out of the way hear is the sad truth. It has took 6 years for them to release the 3rd season. The only thing I ask whoever is reading this is to show support for this excellent show. Purchase your copy for the full amazon asking price. Spread the word. Help Warner Home Video release the rest of the seasons and soooooooon! Every sale counts...if it's priced at a high number.",1377388800,13,1194,4.330357142857143

3441823,3,B0019N76XG,"While I do hope for all to be released just to have the episodes but Season 3 is a pretty bad featureless set and even the looks of the menu look B made. It has many great episodes but it looks like something a person could make by downloading and then burning them on dvds
I seriously hope they just put the rest of the shows run out before people get to see how bad production wise there dvds are.
WB should be ashamed handling a hit show like this in such a bad manor on dvd.",1375228800,2,478,3.9381443298969074

3441825,5,B0019N76XG,I love this show and I am pretty sure the reason why seasons are taking so long is because of those stupid music copyright laws.  Can't we just be given a DVD WITHOUT the stupid intros with music from greedy music producers?  Must we wait years on end for great shows like this and Malcolm in the Middle because of lame copyright issues?  At least Married with Children got over it.  I look forward to all of the seasons of this great show.  George is hilarious!,1374537600,3,462,4.325581395348837
3441826,5,B0019N76XG,i wonder why WB took so long? was it cause of poor sales on season 1 & 2? or cause of the high cost in music rights? whatever it doesnt matter ill be getting it...,1370217600,4,163,3.6857142857142855
