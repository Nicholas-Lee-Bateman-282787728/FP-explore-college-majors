7905267,2,B000007SFG,"This dvd produced in Finland in 1995 features interviews with contacts and channellers about there contact experiences with aliens, some of it sounds far fetched but who knows. There are only a few interviews conducted with UFO experts about there knowledge and what they think is happening in today's world of ufology. This documentary falls below par with today's standard UFO documentaries that come from the US. This is volume 3 in a 5 dvd set. Running time 56 minutes
