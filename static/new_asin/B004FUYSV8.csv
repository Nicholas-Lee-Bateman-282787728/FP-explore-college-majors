4371052,5,B004FUYSV8,"I'm not saying that this is the best Doctor Who Christmas Special, but I am saying it's my favorite one. Cripes, what would we do without cell phones or the Internet or BBC America? Matt Smith as the eleventh Doctor with his first festival episode, and I was all anticipate-y. Steven Moffat crafts a perfect tale inspired by Charles Dickens' classic A CHRISTMAS CAROL. The twists come plenty and frequently.

We first catch up to the Doctor's companions - the newlyweds Amy Pond and Rory Williams - on Christmas Eve as they honeymoon in a luxurious space liner carrying more than four thousand passengers. One of the best things about this episode is that things race along at a heady clip. It's not long at all before the space vessel goes all wonky, gets trapped within the peculiar cloud belt of a human-habitated planet. Amy Pond transmits a distress signal to the Doctor, who arrives and learns that salvation lies solely at the hands of the planet's most powerful man, Kazran Sardick (Michael Gambon, very terrific). Kazran Sardick, bitter and cruel and old, is not only a money lender so tight-fisted he takes his clients' family members as security deposits but he has literally tamed the sky. But he refuses to lift one finger to help even though the ship will crash in an hour's time. The desperate Doctor hits on a brainstorm. As Kazran Sardick himself cynically recounts: ""On every world, wherever people are, in the deepest part of the winter, at the exact midpoint, everybody stops and turns and hugs as if to say: 'Well done. Well done, everyone. We're halfway out of the dark. Back on Earth, we call this Christmas... On this world the first settlers called it the Crystal Feast. You know what I call it? I call it expecting something for nothing!'"" Bah! So you see where this is going.

I've missed Matt Smith and the boyish exuberance he injects in his role. The constant stream-of-consciousness patter, the dynamic energy, the mad flair, but with that bump of empathy... Smith is just about tied with Tom Baker as pound-for-pound my favorite Doctor. Just add to this Doctor's resume that he makes a brilliant nanny. This special is a wonderfully clever time travel story with bits of brilliant creativity and so elegantly staged. I just love the cause and effect of time travel. This special has got laughs, and yet it resonates on a really strong emotional level. Classical singer Katherine Jenkins, lovely and Welsh, makes her acting debut as Abigail Pettigrew, the frozen girl who breaks your heart. There are two things that bug me some. One is that Karen Gillan doesn't interact more with the Doctor, but given the plot it's understandable why. And it seems far-fetched to me that the Doctor doesn't suss out the ominous meaning of the counting down numbers. But it's a tiny quibble. Never mind. Quibbles don't mean diddly next to a moment as iconic as this episode's ""sleigh ride."" That sequence is awesomeness.

Can this Doctor redeem a heartless old man? And save his friends? Does a bear shi... I mean, of course, he does. The fun lies in watching how he goes about it. Kazran Sardick, a man grown old and bitter and yet halfway out of the dark, is salvageable. Pass that cup of yuletide cheer. It's got a bittersweet kick. This is Steven Moffat's best Doctor Who story yet.

The DVD also comes with two fantastic featurettes: the behind-the-scenes ""Doctor Who Confidential"" for this Christmas special (running 00:56:01 minutes long) and ""Doctor Who at the Proms 2010,"" the very awesome Doctor Who concert staged at London's Royal Albert Hall back on July, 2010, featuring composer Murray Gold's musical score, with Ben Foster conducting, and with Karen Gillan, Arthur Darvill, and Matt Smith doing emcee work (00:57:16 minutes long).",1293840000,66,3762,4.836956521739131
4371053,5,B004FUYSV8,"This was just an excellent Christmas special all around. For anyone not on board with the Matt Smith era Doctor, this is the one to watch. He is just so likable in the role. Gambon has a ton of great material to work with here as a Scrooge like character, and the rest of the cast is great as well. The story had to look ridiculous on paper with the Scrooge riff, flying sharks, etc...But Moffat and crew really did knock it out of the park with this one. I am looking very forward to the new season. Check this special out!",1293667200,4,524,4.147058823529412
4371054,5,B004FUYSV8,Dr Who:A Chistmas Carol is a treat. it starts out as rory and amy are on there honeymoon which continues from where big bang left off. it centers on an elderly miser who is very much like the dickens classic one in every way. he hates christmas due to his dad's meaness as a child. it is an interesting tale i loved the acting of Michael Gambon he knocks out one amazing take on this elderly miser. it is the dickens retold basically with all the who touches the new series seems to love to follow often. great tale simply put i would watch it often as i can it is great christmas tale that tells the classic dickens tale in a new way for a new genration of viewers.,1293321600,6,666,4.130769230769231

Some viewers seem to find it necessary to pick apart the plot and think of ways the Doctor could've resolved things without jumping back and forth in time, or that time-lords shouldn't be doing it for those reasons. It's the Christmas Special; rather removed from the series in general and is meant to be enjoyed in the spirit of the holidays, let go and have fun with it ;)",1451692800,,748,6.252427184466019
4371086,5,B004FUYSV8,"A space-liner carrying 4,003 hapless passengers loses control in the electrified clouds above a planet.  The only man able to keep it from crashing (Michael Gambon as Kazran Sardick) refuses to do so.  As long as it doesnt crash into his house, hes perfectly content.  A distress call goes out to the Doctor (Matt Smith) who decides to intervene in as complicated a manner as he can muster on the fly.  With a grand entrance, the Doctor sets about altering Sardicks past, making him a changed man willing to help.  Holograms and fish play a small part in the proceedings.
Who but the Doctor would use a shark instead of a reindeer to take a night flight?

4371089,5,B004FUYSV8,"I had never watched ""Doctor Who,"" and never felt any inclination to do so until I discovered ""his"" version of Charles Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol.""  I collect versions of ""A Christmas Carol,"" so I purchased and watched this version, expecting it to be one of the worst and most boring.  To my surprise and delight, I was mistaken.  This is one of the better versions, as far as I'm concerned,

It is a unique and near perfect blend of ""Doctor Who"" and the classic Christmas tale.  With its own characters and story line, it may be viewed as merely another episode of ""Doctor Who,"" which I had no idea could be so entertaining.  But, in addition to serving as an episode of ""Doctor Who,"" this film presents a story with so many parallels to the classic that, even without the title, they would be obvious to anyone familiar with the Dickens classic.

My only complaint is that this version seemed bit too long, but it ties loose ends up so nicely, that I was glad I endured the lengthiness after all.",1446076800,,999,4.486187845303867

New viewers should find it very hard to complain about the story, acting, or effects with this special, as they all are beyond top notch.  Out of all of Matt Smith's Christmas specials, this one definitely had the most heart to it.  The quirkiness and energy of the Eleventh Doctor was in full swing throughout the story, starting with what I consider to be one his best entrances.  Costars Michael Gambon (Harry Potter's 2nd Dumbledore) and Katherine Jenkins were fantastic as Sardik and Abigail.  Miss Jenkin's beautiful vocals especially made this Christmas special all the more unique and may make you run to download the soundtrack for this special as well.

A fair warning though:  This story is also available as a part of one of the season/series box sets.  So, only consider this edition if you are truly only in love with just this story.",1418256000,,996,4.811764705882353

4371184,5,B004FUYSV8,"In this Christmas episode of DOCTOR WHO, aptly entitled DOCTOR WHO: A CHRISTMAS CAROL, we catch up with the Doctors companions, recently married Amy Pond and Rory Williams who are on their honeymoon aboard a luxurious space liner. The ship is carrying over four thousand passengers. The ship gets caught up in a strange electrical cloud surrounding a planet with no way to escape and which will cause the space liner to crash into the planets surface in about one hour. Amy calls the Doctor. He arrives and discovers that the cloud is controlled by the planets most wealthy and powerful man, Kazran Sardick (Michael Gambon). Kazran is a mean and bitter old man and refuses to stop the ship from crashing. Its Christmas Eve (well, Crystal Feast to the people of Kazrans world) and Kazran is nothing but an old Scrooge. Inspired by Dickens classic story, the Doctor decides to become the Ghost of Christmas Past, Present, and Future in order to melt Kazrans heart of stone. So, theres all that and a bunch of flying fish, too.

In this episode, Matt Smith is at his exuberant and joyful best. He brings to the episode all of the witty and whimsy that Tom Baker gave to the role along with the solid and grounded determination that David Tennant provided. He might have been the most recent incarnation of the Doctor, but thats not the main reason that Matt Smith is now often considered one of the better Doctors: hes considered one of the better Doctors because he brings an almost perfect balance to the role and hes at his prime in DOCTOR WHO: A CHRISTMAS CAROL. Even in the darker moments of the episode (there are a few), he makes it a joy to watch.

The DVD includes two featurettes: a behind-the-scenes Doctor Who Confidential about DOCTOR WHO: A CHRISTMAS CAROL and Doctor Who at the Proms 2010 which is a Doctor Who concert that was taped at Londons Royal Albert Hall in July 2010.",1392854400,,1888,4.616071428571429

4371196,5,B004FUYSV8,"I was born and raised in England and have watched Doctor Who ever since the first episode in 1963.  When Doctor Who was ""re-launched"" with Christopher Eccleston, I was glued to every episode just as I was as a child when it was originally launched.  Probably even more so since techology and special effects have come such a long way since 1963.  I love the way Doctor Who has remained true to his character regardless of which actor is playing him.  I also love the way that storylines and aliens from the past are woven into the present.  And, more importantly, I love how this has remained a family show.  Matt Smith is the youngest actor to every play Doctor Who and he has done a brilliant job!!  I'm sad to see him go, but I know Peter Capaldi is a great actor and I'm sure he will carry the ""Doctor Who Torch"" very capably.",1390521600,,830,4.316129032258065

4371269,5,B004FUYSV8,"This is my favorite Doctor Who Christmas special, and one of my favorite Doctor Who episodes ever.  Moffat takes Dicken's classic story and turns it on its head by incorporating the Doctor and his special timey-wimey, wibbly-wobbly ways.  After all, who better than a Time Lord to incorporate Christmases past, present and future to change an old miser's heart?
  I won't summarize the plot here as others have already done so, but suffice it to say that this is a most delightful spin on Dicken's Christmas Carol.  The story, the dialogue, and the imagery are all tied together by the top-notch performance of the cast, especially Smith and Gambon.  For those audiences who only know Michael Gambon as Dumbledore, you are in for a treat.  He is truly a revelation here as Ebenezer, er, I mean, Kazran Sardic.  This is one of those magical stories that grabs your heart and soul, pulls you in for the wild ride, then sticks with you long after it's ended.",1338854400,2,955,4.710843373493976
4371270,5,B004FUYSV8,"I have only recently been indoctrinated into the wide and wondrous world of Doctor Who. but I'm a quick and avid study. I was astonished that this is the first time that anyone had attempted to use A Christmas Carol as the framework for one of The Doctor's Christmas specials.
A story that delves into the concept of the past, the present, and the future, and the impacts that one may have on the other, it seems so easily lent to the world of Doctor Who.

I was thoroughly entertained by this Christmas special, and the unique twist done to tell this version of The Christmas Carol.

Stephen Moffat's writing style certainly aids this story, and it's simple, honest sentimentality. And Matt Smith's charm and wit are infectious, to say the least.

I've personally used this version of The Christmas Carol to indoctrinate other members of my family into the world of Doctor Who.

The Doctor Who Proms on this disc are also a delight. The music of this series is just astonishing, and seeing them performed live is amazing.",1328832000,2,1022,4.661111111111111
4371271,4,B004FUYSV8,"...of both Doctor Who and A Christmas Carol I have to say I really enjoyed this version of the carol.  Matt Smith was still kind of new to me when I watched this and this special REALLY helped make me more comfortable with his character.
Also, while Christmas Carol has been done, again and again and again, and many parts of this special were not that interesting I did find some of the choices made in the production to be 100% correct.  For example, the Ghost of the Future was a very interesting twist that only time travel could make work.  The bonus features, Confidential and Doctor Who at the Proms 2010, helps you feel like you got your money's worth.

Katherine Jenkins (an admitted non-actor) is exquisite.  This isn't just an episode from a TV show...it's an EXPERIENCE you'll want to enjoy over and over.

In this film, Dr. Who is not any of the ghosts of Christmas present, past, nor future.  The doctor actually intercedes in the past to change the present ""Scrooge"" character to a more caring and giving person.

The doctor has the power to change one person, but he, strangely enough, does not have the power to save another person.",1315353600,,535,4.428571428571429

4371296,5,B004FUYSV8,"Judge Michael Stailey, DVD Verdict-- If there were a feature film for this particular series' cast and crew, Doctor Who: A Christmas Carol would be it. Viewed by some as an annual standalone adventure and others as the first episode of the next series, recent Christmas tales have been rather hit or miss (""Runaway Bride"" and ""Voyage of the Damned"" being the standouts). Where Russell T Davies gave us adventures on a sweeping epic scale, new showrunner Steven Moffat's best efforts are small intimate tales with mind-blowing implications. Whether it be cracks in our bedroom wall, statues that move when we're not looking, or face spiders who live in the deepest recesses of our cupboards, he knows exactly how to tap into the imagination of our inner 8-year-old to thrill or scare the bejeezus out of us.

On the surface, one might see Doctor Who: A Christmas Carol as yet another variation on Dickens' classic tale. And yet Steven is such a genius when it comes to playing with time, this episode is anything but. Using technology and storytelling in a way we've not seen in Doctor Who, our hero is able to take Kazran on a visual and psychological tour of his life, not only shining light on his many pitfalls but actually rewriting memories in the most subtle and effective of ways. It's an emotionally rich journey during which you will be hard pressed not to grow extremely invested in these characters.

I don't want to say too much, so as not to spoil the story's many beautiful moments. What I will share is how phenomenally well this cast works together. While Arthur and Karen are relegated to inconsequential narrative bookends, Doctor Who: A Christmas Carol gives Matt Smith a chance to really shine. You can actually see the wheels of the Doctor's mind spinning madly as he tries to figure things out, and his line reads are second to none. Then again, how can they not be when playing off someone like Michael Gambon. Alastair Sim (A Christmas Carol 1951) and Albert Finney (Scrooge) have long been regarded as definitive portrayals of Ebeneezer Scrooge, but I submit that Gambon can now share that adulation. There are more layers and nuance in this performance than can possibly be explored in 60 minutes. We must also give credit to Laurence Belcher and Danny Horn for absorbing some of Gabon's traits in playing younger versions of Kazran. Operatic nightingale Katherine Jenkins is lovely in her acting debut, but the best she can do is keep pace with her veteran co-stars, exuding an innocence the belies the wisdom of her voice.

Presented in 1.78:1 1080i, the image is as sharp and mesmerizing as its BBC America HD presentation. Yes, the high def purists are likely to spot their fair share of imperfections, so those looking for reference quality won't find it here. For the rest of us, the ambience of this tale, awash in a coat of chilly holiday blue, more than serves its story. The same can be said for the DTS-HD 5.1 audio, whose use of the surrounds envelopes us not only in Katherine Jenkins' flawless vocals and Murray Gold's rousing score, but the very world in which these characters inhabit.

Two bonus features are the icing on this holiday treat. The requisite Doctor Who Confidential documents the making of the special, in the grand detail we've come to expect from the production team. When David Attenborough decides to retire, I nominate these guys to pick up his torch. The other feature, Doctor Who at The Proms, has quickly become a favorite of mine. Given the exceptional work composers Murray Gold and Ben Foster have amassed on the revitalized series, seeing it performed by the entire BBC Symphony of Wales in front of a packed house of Whovians, and loaded with surprise appearances by characters and cast is a joy to behold. If you haven't seen the previous Proms concert, I highly recommend tracking it down.

My one gripe, and it pains me to say it: I'm concerned that it won't be included in the full series box set, as previous holiday episodes have been. Cash grab by the BBC? Perhaps, but Doctor Who fans will purchase it either way. And who knows, maybe it'll lure in uninitiated television fans looking for a taste of what the nerds can't stop talking about.

So to recap: Christmas + Steven Moffat + Matt Smith + Michael Gambon + Fish that swim in fog = Pure Wholiday Magic.

4371297,2,B004FUYSV8,"I am a HUGE Doctor Who fan, and I take my fandom seriously. But I found it impossible to take this special seriously. Normally, I'm charmed by Matt Smith's techno-babbling Doctor and Moffat's plot shenanigans. In this case, I was not. Russel T. Davies was the king of camp, but Steven Moffat botches this grandly. The special starts promisingly, albeit Amy and Rory's inappropriate clothing, but soon the story seems muddled and overdone. Crossing one's own time stream, which was once frowned upon, is used as a plot device, a shark is hitched to a buggy, and a woman singing, though the song is beautiful, is the best the Doctor can come up with to create resonating pitches to bring down a crashing spaceship. The performances are good, but the story is ridiculous. Don't buy it.",1311638400,,782,4.757352941176471
4371298,5,B004FUYSV8,"Ordered the Christmas special as my wife had missed seeing it when aired. I was and am a huge David Tennant fan and wondered how this special would come out.
Well it seems Matt Smith has gotten his Dr. Who feet under him. Tennant? No, but definitely the Doctor. Matt kept the story from becoming quite dark, which it could have very easily. My feeling is that if David Tennant had made this Christmas special, for many people it would have been a full box of Keenex affair. Unless your made of stone be prepaired to be a little misty eyed at the end. Contrary to some reveiws out there it is far from a typical happy ending.
Can't imagine how they could have got the casting better. Michael Gambon in the ""Scrooge"" character was so good I can't see anyone else playing that part. Then there's Katherine Jenkins, as Abigail. Voice and beauty, just stunning. If you ever needed an excuse to visit Wales you now have it.
Big plus with the CD is the ""How they made the show"" extra. Really worth the time to watch the huge effort that Cardiff put into this special.
Must have for any Dr. Who fan.",1308096000,2,1091,4.352941176470588
4371299,4,B004FUYSV8,This is a pretty good episode in my opinion. It's pretty creative and not as tacky as I was worried it might be when I watched the previews for it. It's a classic and I've re-watched it a few times.,1307318400,,198,3.975

i really loves the story.
It starts like a roller coaster, it's witty, heartwarming, human, you laugh your head off, cry like a little girl, you are amazed by the originality of the story and the beauty of the sets, special effects and costumes and stuff...

....annnnnnd the video quality make you wanna puke.

Sriously, why going into so much trouble to doing something so beautiful and botch the entire work by filming with, i don't know, it must be a cell phone or an old Georges Mlis's camera or something.
Come on, it's suppose to be a blu ray you know...what the heck is all this white specks doing all over the screen ?? And does them ever heard of 1080P ???

4371316,5,B004FUYSV8,I have watched this movie so many times since it was first aired and I finally bought it when it was released.  I just love it.  I my humble opinion it is the best episode ever made of Doctor Who.,1303603200,,196,3.875
4371317,5,B004FUYSV8,"Great show!  Not as good as the regular season but it still pretty great! Don't know if he can do it, but Matt Smith is just short of topping David Tennant.",1303084800,,156,4.032258064516129

4371319,5,B004FUYSV8,"My whole family enjoyed this year's Doctor Who Christmas Special.  We are big fans of the show, so that was no surprise.  The kids showed it to their friend, who had never seen an episode before.  She loved it too, without any confusion about the characters or plot.  A Christmas Carol is equal parts funny, sad, and moving and totally appropriate for all ages!",1301356800,,361,4.59375
4371320,5,B004FUYSV8,"This is not the most action pack of the Christmas specials but I think it is the best.  The Christmas feeling is in every frame of this episode.  The plot is clever and the acting is great.  I know this does not tell you much but i want to keep this review completely spoiler free.  Yet me just say that if you like Doctor Who and you enjoyed Matt Smith last season you will love this story.  The disc has about two hours of extras and the picture and sound are amazing so it is well worth the purchase price.

Enjoy the disc and Merry Christmas.",1301097600,3,546,4.10377358490566
4371321,4,B004FUYSV8,"The one downside is that there aren't commentaries; however, the Confidential is included, as are the Proms--the Doctor Who concert.  Try to keep a straight face as Matt Smith interacts, as the Doctor, with a kid from the audience.

Then there's the main event, Steven Moffat's ""A Christmas Carol.""  It's not perfect but it sure is excellent; the story is at its strongest when it adheres most closely to Dickens.  Smith is, as he was throughout season 5, a revelation as the Doctor....and Eleven's entrance may be a DW classic.",1300492800,4,528,4.833333333333333
4371322,3,B004FUYSV8,"I am torn about Matt Smith as the 11th Doctor, and his first special did not help me decide whether I like or dislike him. The story is a modern retelling of the classic Charles Dickens story ""A Christmas Carol"". Michael Gambon plays the old miser, and his change of heart is painfully obvious from the start. That being said, he is still a fine actor. Matt Smith throughout is his same character, a bit jumpy and eccentric. Often times, it seems that he is trying to be too much like David Tennant, and that can be seen a tad in A Christmas Carol. The Sci Fi Elements are interesting, but theey seem like an afterthought. You never get the feeling that Rory and Amy are in any real danger, as we are just told that they are plummeting towards the planet. The fish story is my favorite part of this special, as it adds depth to the narrative. In summation, any fans of Matt Smith will enjoy this, but it was not to my liking.",1299974400,2,925,4.261363636363637
4371323,5,B004FUYSV8,"It took a while for me to become a fan of Matt Smith as the third ""new"" Dr. Who. If you want a good start on appreciation of his Doctor, this is a good one to start with. It is a fine retelling of Dickens Christmas Carol, but with a Dr. Who twist. Michael Gambon (Dumbledore from Harry Potter) is fantastic as the Scrooge type, Kazran Sardick. And Katherine Jenkins has one of the most beautiful singing voices I have ever heard.
An all around excellent entertainment.",1299801600,3,468,4.390804597701149
4371324,1,B004FUYSV8,I purchased this Blu-ray to get the Christmas special and to get the Doctor Who at the Proms performance.  The special was very good and what I expected but the Proms extra severely edited down.  A review I saw indicated there was an extra musical selection but was present was missing all the classical entries and the opening number.  This is not what I saw on BBC.  What I expected on the disk was additions not subtractions.  I found this disk disappointing and had to return it.,1299024000,4,483,4.505747126436781
4371325,4,B004FUYSV8,Christmas has come a little late with this February re take on a classic tale.  Picking up where season 5 leaves off The Doctor's travel mates are enjoying a luxery space cruise when it comes into trouble inside the skies fish swim and a scrooge like man controls the weather.  Unable to reason the man in the present to save his friends The Doctor plays Marley and the ghosts as he travels into the man's past in attempt to change him into a more caring person than he originally grew up to be with the help of his lost love who held in suspended animation and only comes out each Christmas. Together the two may be the key to saving both the planet and The Doctor's friends.,1298505600,2,676,4.31496062992126
4371326,5,B004FUYSV8,"I think this is the Best Doctor Who Christmas Specials and one of the best episodes of the Newer Whos!  the Doctor using the Tardis to convince a Scrooge to save Amy and a Cruise ship, gives a fresh look at the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present and Yet to Come.
 The voice of Katherine Jenkins is unbelievable!  Watching Micheal Gambon as Sardick is worth every penny!  Matt Smith gets to be outrageous bring Christmas cheer to everyone.  The Doctor Who Confidential and the Proms extras just add to enjoyment!",1298246400,2,510,4.622222222222222
4371327,5,B004FUYSV8,"I'll start by saying that, yes, this Christmas Special is expertly written, skillfully acted, and interestingly played out. By far this is my favorite of all Doctor Who Christmas Specials. It takes fans on a journey very different from what is usual on the regular weekly programming. As not to give away the story to those who have yet to see the special, I'll simply say this; it does not so much show case the Doctor's ability to face and defeat truly evil and malevolent beings but more his way of being able to heal a person's past and warm their heart for the better. There are no Dalek or Cybermen, but rather the challenge of changing a cold man's heart.
Set in the style of ""A Christmas Carol"" Moffat uses some writing genius in his play on the story for the Doctor. He does not allow the original story of ""A Christmas Carol"" to overshadow the individuality of Doctor Who, but still keeps the theme present while leaving room for the hilarity that Matt Smith always seems to bring as the Doctor.
The actors also display a deep understanding and control of their rolls. Of course, with Michael Gambon on cast, it's difficult to go wrong. The characters were played to perfection and really brought to life. Not only this, but it is within this episode that Matt Smith shows he has truly ""become"" the Doctor. (But, in my opinion, I always thought he was pretty amazing.)

The special feature also blew me away. I had actually not known that Doctor Who at The Proms would be on the disc and was in for a pleasant surprise when if found it there. It's an enjoyable little extra and I love it every time I watch it.
The Doctor Who Confidential was also very interesting. It was roughly just under an hour and gave a lot of insight to filming, acting, and set creation. I was rather fascinated by it actually. It gave a lot of detail and was highly interesting. (Note: DO NOT WATCH CONFIDENTIAL BEFORE THE ACTUAL CHRISTMAS SPEICAL!)

The casing itself is pretty video store standard. Nothing especially high quality but no real issues with it as I bought this for entertainment value, not collection.

Overall, this is a great buy and really cheap too. I suggest just going for it and buying it now if you're interested, it's well worth it.",1298073600,4,2244,4.5358024691358025
4371328,5,B004FUYSV8,"I won't spend a lot of time dissecting the episode; other reviews have done that for you.  But I will say that I think ""A Christmas Carol"" is an episode that gets better with repeat viewings.  As I write this, we're about 2 months out from Christmas 2010, and I've just watched the show for the fourth time.  Naturally, it plays much better around the holiday itself, but I was pleasantly surprised to find I enjoyed it ""out of season"" as well.  Yes, [Minor spoilers ahead] the shark is still kind of silly, and the story is probably a bit too ambitious for its own good.  But it's also very beautiful to watch, gorgeously filmed and the actors pull off their parts with conviction.  I expect that all but the most jaded of Doctor Who fans will make this a part of their annual holiday viewing.

Now, more about the Blu-ray disc itself.  The show has been filming in the HD format for the past two years, and looks amazing.  One expects them to spend more time and money on the Christmas episode, and it really shows here.  One reviewer complained that the episode was ""too dark"" in places, and I can't disagree.  But the lighter moments really sparkle.  Katherine Jenkins is a beautiful woman in ANY definition, but looks simply incredible in ""A Christmas Carol.""

The other real treat on the disc, though, is the ""Doctor Who at the Proms 2010.""  As you probably know, the Proms feature the show's music played live at the Royal Albert Hall, along with giant screen projecting scenes from the series and live actors interacting with the audience.  I can only imagine the thrill of seeing this event in person, but just watching it at home is still very fulfilling.  An extended tribute to the previous Doctor, David Tennant, is the emotional highpoint of the show.  Matt Smith and Karen Gillan also make appearances.

Lastly, there's the ""cut-down"" version of Doctor Who Confidential, the behind-the-scenes program for the Christmas special.  I've always found the Confidential shows to be fun and imformative, although I don't understand why BBC video never puts the full hour-long programs on these discs.

Lastly, there's a rumor that although ""A Christmas Carol"" will be included in the Series 6 box set, the Proms special will NOT.  As I said, at this point, this is a RUMOR.  In the meantime, I have chosen not to wait and see.  And if you're really a Doctor Who fan, you'll support each new release (in my opinion, anyway).  And the Christmas special is absolutely worth owning.  When you add the bonus materials and the HD presentation, I say ""Why wait?""",1297900800,4,2563,4.680089485458613
4371329,5,B004FUYSV8,"So, can you believe Matt Smith can measure up to Sir Michael Gambon?! I'm not going to repeat all the praises you've heard from other 5 stars reviewers, ( great Doctor's update on the Dickens story, great Katherine Jenkins, cutely absurd monsters of the day, I won't spoil the surprise!)
It's Matt Smith's acting, it is outstanding, what could have been ""just another"" Christmas Carol becomes a great piece of television. He is bringing balance to the powerful acting of the older, more experienced actor, together they are stellar!
Matt Smith is growing as the 11th Doctor with each episode, for him to stand up and hold the episode with an actor of Sir Gambon's caliber is a new feat!!!
Delightful, lighthearted, great acting, how about a Christmas classic?!",1297814400,2,760,4.89922480620155
4371330,5,B004FUYSV8,"Great story, nice twist on Dickens' classic. Katherine Jenkins is incredible both acting and singing. It's a show to watch repeatedly and will be a Christmas tradition in my house for years to come. I hear there will be a soundtrack release just for this episode that I'm eagerly awaiting.",1296950400,,289,4.8
4371331,5,B004FUYSV8,"It's a rare occasion that I do a review, but I couldn't pass this one up.  This Christmas special was simply brilliant.  For me, it's hands down the best Christmas special to date.  It's a truly magical Christmas fairytale-ish story, done in somewhat atypical Who-niverse fashion.  I just loved it.  I had no issues whatsoever with the characters, the casting, the story... it was all just brilliant.  Even the ""personal timeline"" stuff didn't bother me in the slightest - it made for a compelling and somewhat awe inspiring storyline that I really enjoyed (and didn't expect!).  And besides... yeah, the cardinal rule of not crossing personal timelines... rubbish, really.  True Who fans can probably cite off the top of their heads a half dozen examples of when the Doctor blatantly violated that rule, going all the way back to the 3rd or 4th Doctor even.  The way I looked at it was that this was not ordinary Doctor Who anyway... this was the Christmas special... and I thoroughly enjoyed the Who crew taking it a bit further than previous norms.  It's the unexpected that makes this show so exciting, and I think Steven Moffat is doing an amazing job taking us there.",1295827200,24,1173,4.762376237623762
4371332,5,B004FUYSV8,"What a great gift BBC America gave us this year with their airing of Dr Who: A Christmas Carol. Matt Smith was in top form, and while there were a couple of loopholes in the plot as noted by other reviewers the writing was otherwise strong and the wit quick.
I didn't think I could see another Doctor after Tennant retired, and now I can't wait for Season 6! Allons-y, Alonso!",1294272000,2,376,4.309859154929577
4371333,3,B004FUYSV8,"This is based on a Christmas Carol obviously by the title, in the Christmas Carol you have two main tasks. The saving of Scrooge and Tiny Tim in this Doctor Who version we only save Scrooge and leave Tiny Tim to die from some unspecified complication of a disease or physical problem. Also I have to quibble about the whole start of the story where a ship is about to crash and the Doctor needs to get the Scrooge character to cooperate to save the ship, totally ignoring that the Tardis should have been able to tow the ship to safety as he has in the past much less the whole earth. This story could have been so much more so only gets a 3 star rating. Matt Smith is to good of a Doctor to be left to such mediocre writing.",1293926400,6,725,4.112676056338028
4371334,5,B004FUYSV8,"I  am not someone who cries easily and during the David Tennant's time as the Doctor , I became tired of the emotional manipulation that I was meant to feel , but this epidode,genuinely touched me. I loved Matt Smith's performance as the Doctor. I could not keep from laughing at most of his antics but was equally moved by the bittersweet love story that we saw between Abigail and Kurzan. Of all the modern interpretations of a'Christmas Carol' I have seen , this one had the most heart.",1293840000,41,489,4.49438202247191
4371335,3,B004FUYSV8,"The 2010 Proms was a lot of fun, and even better than the concert from 2008, which set a very high standard. If you've seen Star Wars in concert, this is very similar. Large screens play clips from Doctor Who while some of the best soundtrack music currently in television or movies is performed superbly by a full choir and orchestra, with some modern electric insturments and a solo singer or two thrown in. There are surprise guests galore. There is a high rewatch value with this concert.

The Christmas story was a bit of a letdown. Matt Smith was good in it, but towards the beginning he talked faster than Tennant ever did and was hard to follow without subtitles (I watched it on BBC America at a friend's house). After that, it was hard to get into the guest character's backstories and the companions, while I enjoyed seeing then again, may as well have not been in it at all.

I enjoyed that Christmas was a central theme to the story (I don't think 'O Holy Night' would have ever made it onscreen by the previous showrunner) but I still had a hard time caring about the characters, and that took away from the emotional bits of the story. The lighting was way too dark for an upbeat Christmas adventure. It would have been much better with more scenes in the daylight, like in Runaway Bride. It also had very little action.

Here's hoping they marry the Christmas theme next year to a stronger script.",1293840000,7,1413,4.490272373540856

Great to see Dumbledore back in action. Unless this happened first. My spacetime theory is a little shaky.
The singer who played Abigail had a tremendously lovely voice. I don't think most people get to experience that quality of singing in their daily life unless they actively seek it out, so it's terrific that it was included here for everyone to enjoy.
Any reason the alien planet had English type names for everyone but the main character?
I'm not sure how I feel about physical abuse for entertainment's sake, but to never mention it in any medium would also be a disservice. And at the end, just what did they do with the surplus population?",1521158400,,876,4.550632911392405
