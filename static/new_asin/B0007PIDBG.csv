2230856,2,B0007PIDBG,"These are great cartoons, but there is nothing new to DVD here.  If you have the Disney Treasures sets, you have these cartoons:

2230857,4,B0007PIDBG,"One of my favorite Disney cartoons, Mickey's Trailer, came from an episode of The Disney Sunday Movie, which was a regular show when I was growing up.  I'd had a VCR tape of the cartoon that was practically worn out from watching it so much.  And then, Disney finally released the cartoon on DVD!!!  The rest of the cartoons are entertaining, but I definitely bought this DVD for Mickey's Trailer.  It's a great cartoon, with Mickey, Goofy, and Donald vacationing in a pull-behind-the-car trailer.  I was a little disappointed because I thought another of my favorites (from that worn out VCR tape) was on it, Goofy riding a horse at a dude ranch, but alas, it was not the same cartoon.  I'll keep looking!",1176336000,4,706,4.653225806451613
2230858,5,B0007PIDBG,This is truly destined to be a classic! I LOVE these old cartoons because they give me insight on Disney's past. My favorite ones on here are Mickey's Trailer and Old Sequoia. They are also the oldest cartoons in this particular collection. I LOVE them!,1171756800,3,253,4.644444444444445
2230859,5,B0007PIDBG,"I've got a picky 5 year old.  He sits singing,laughing and clapping his hands together while he watches this video.  I'm sure I made a good choice.",1144540800,2,147,4.407407407407407
2230860,4,B0007PIDBG,"Despite what the description says, this is NOT a ""NEW"" collection of wild and wacky adventures.  It is a collection of 8 older Disney shorts, mostly from the 40's and 50's that have a summer/vacation them to them.  It's a decent collection but these eight toons hardly rank as some of Disney's all-time best.  I'll only give a synopsis on what I think the best episodes are:

""No Sail"" is from 1945 and features Donald and Goofy.

""Two Weeks Vacation"" is from 1952 and is a Goofy short.

""Trailer Horn"" is from 1950 and has one of my favorite themes where Chip and Dale annoy the heck out of Donald Duck.  This time the pair keep jumping on Donald's car horn as Donald seethes in anger.

""Old Sequoia"" is a Donald Short from 1945.

""Mickey's Trailer"" is the oldest short on this DVD being from 1938.  Mickey, Donald, and Goofy are all on a trip in Mickey's trailer and Goofy is left to navigate.  The best short on the disc by far!

""Hello Aloha"" is a Goofy short from 1952.

""Good Scouts"" is also from 1938 and is the other great short on this DVD as Donald is a scout leader demonstrating his wildlife know how, or not how as they case may be, to Huey, Dewey, and louie.

""How to Ride a Horse"" is another of the series of ""Goofy"" how to shorts.  From 1950.

Many of these shorts are on other collections so that's not why I'm all that crazy about it.  60 minutes is just really short for a DVD unless it's a kids DVD and are kids really into these old Disney shorts?",1116547200,8,1468,4.241877256317689

2230868,4,B0007PIDBG,"This is a nicely put together themed set of cartoons. Some involve multiple classic characters while others focus on solo outings. ""Extreme adventure"" and the image on the front are slightly misleading, as it's much more a mix of episodes set in the great outdoors. Most aren't what could be called ""extreme."" Setting that aside it's also a nice mix of eras as well, with consistently great material throughout the disc.",1390867200,,420,4.929577464788732
2230869,5,B0007PIDBG,They just don't make cartoons like this anymore and its a shame.

I remember watching Mickey's Trailer on tv when I was a kid. This DVD is even better than the Treasury DVDs because there isn't an annoying introduction to each cartoon.
