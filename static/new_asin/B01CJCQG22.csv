7684014,5,B01CJCQG22,"Now I have read a lot of complaints about this set....shame on you! We are privalaged to have had not just one but TWO blu-Ray releases of Keaton's solo shorts!

Sadly Laurel & Hardy have not had such luck and not truly had a fully comprehensive silent DVD release, let alone a blu Ray collection...please lobster restore all the L&H silents, please!!

Anyway I digress, this set is superb in my opinion. I owed the Masters of Cinema DVD release I owned the Art of Buster Keaton DVD set and all the Kino blu Rays including the first short films collection 1920-23.

First of all the Arbuckle/Keaton shorts have never looked better and are all accompanied by entertaing and fitting scores.

Some people have complained about the ""modern"" compositions and the vocal elements used in Coney Island. If we want future generations to enjoy and love Keaton like we do and I'm only 29 myself we need to move them in to the modern era and using more modern orchestrations I think is a positive if it is done well, which I believe it has been, in this collection.

I have no complaints what so ever about the Arbuckle/Keaton shorts the films are steady played at the right speed and are beautifully restored and the music compliments it all superbly.

When it comes to the Keaton shorts, again some people have negative views on some of the prints used.

Although I do agree that some of the prints like One Week look a little bit white and does not have as much grey scaling as the previous blu Ray release. The prints themselves all look clean clear and and at times astounding...My Wife's Relations, The Love Nest, Neighbors to name a few.

If the images appear softer to some people that is because they have been digitally restored. Removing as many film blemishes as possible and sadly one of the affects of this is it slightly softens the picture. Yet every film has more detail than any previous collection.

I loved the previous Kino shorts release but looking at it now I can see film jumps, inaccurate speeds and so much dirt and not quite as much clarity in the films.

The scores on the Keaton solos are fantastic I particularly enjoyed the music for The ""High"" Sign, One Week, Cops, My Wife's Relations, The Love Nest and The Playhouse.

It is so exciting to see an alternate and as the booklets notes confirm, definitive version of Keaton's The Blacksmith...at last we get to see this film and admire it as a classic and not as a lesser short.

The new version is for me is the only version I will watch now although well done to Lobster for giving us two full versions.

We have the most complete versions of Convict 13, Day Dreams and Hard Luck and they all feature improved footage and of course we have the ending of Hard Luck on blu-Ray...at last!!!!!!

Plus I also prefer the much funnier ending of My Wife's Relations, it is hilarious.

These are all the most comprehensive and complete films we have ever had of Keaton's shorts and I believe it will be the most comprehensive for a long time.

In conclusion aside my very minor quibbles over the lack of grey scaling on a couple of the pictures this collection is crisp, clean, clear, complete and with the best soundtracks I've heard, they truly bring these films to life like never before!

Buy this set! For sure if you're a Keaton fan and if you are a movie buff or have interests in silent cinema you should own this collection!!!

Lobster did a superb job with Chaplins - Keystone, Essanay and Mutual films and they have done fantastic work on so many other great silent films, it's film preservationalists like them that set the standard and why we get to see these once thought lost films in HD and looking amazing!

That's my review I will stop waffling now.

Buy!!!",1465344000,24,3738,4.534226190476191
7684015,5,B01CJCQG22,"I'm surprised by the bad reviews here. I found most of the restorations here to be very, very good to excellent. A (very) few scenes here look like they could have been improved somewhat visually but most of this is pristine with crystal clarity. I've been watching Keaton since the 1960's and this is the best I've ever seen. The music scores are very good to excellent, also. Is there room for improvement? Yes. Is this the best so far? YES.",1465171200,17,443,4.481481481481482
7684016,3,B01CJCQG22,"I'll ""cut to the chase""...

...The film ""One Week"" has the greatest musical soundtrack (by Timothy Brock) ever recorded for any Keaton movie.  Ever.  In fact, I'll go so far as to say that this is the best sound track ever recorded for ANY ""silent"" comedy.  And it's all in perfect sync to the image (for a change).  The beauty of this was enough to make me almost weep from time to time while watching.

""The High Sign"", ""The Scarecrow"", ""Neighbors"", and ""Convict 13"" also have exceptionally good musical accompaniment.  Perhaps best I've heard.  ""Cops"" is also quite good, although it takes half the movie for Timothy Brock to warm to the task and become truly comically inspired.  I still prefer Gaylord Carter's organ accompaniment on the earlier Kino release (K131) that includes ""The General"".

Now for the bad news.

The image of some of these movies is far inferior to the previous blu-ray release of Keaton's 1920-1923 shorts (K756).

This new compilation is worth the price just for the musical setting to ""One Week"".  However, the image sucks.  It is washed out, and details are lost in the lights and darks.  It's still watchable, but the earlier version (K756) was pristine.

I note that on the Prologue page of the pamphlet to this new set, Serge Bromberg states that ""Not a frame, not a sound in the Blu-ray or DVD set in your hands comes from previous editions.""  UNFORTUNATELY, this means that he HAD to rely on sometimes inferior prints, since the BEST prints of several films is offered in the last of Kino's sets (K756).  What a damn shame...

It's also a shame that he relied upon some really bad composers.  Antonio Coppola can do wonders with an orchestra, but his improvised piano work pretty much ruins every movie he plays for in this set (SIX OF THEM!!!!!).  I couldn't even finish watching the Arbuckle-Keaton movie ""Oh, Doctor"" because of the lame, boring, insipid, snivelling piano music.  Stephen Horne is another one who plays terribly anomalistic music (too modern), and manages to ruin a couple of these films including ""Hard Luck"".  (It's also untrue that ""not a sound"" comes from previous editionsNeil Brand's music to the Arbuckle-Keaton movie ""The Bellboy"" is EXACTLY the same.)

Another problem film is ""Day Dreams"".  Some of the newly constructed intertitles are too long and lack the brisk whimsy of the earlier edition (K756).  And since this movie is probably the most sardonic of all of Keaton, it really needs some help.  Now the Mont Alto orchestra does some dang great work in this compilation, but ""Day Dreams"" ain't one 'em.  Without the added still-frames to help create the irony of the story, with the intertitles not being funny, this ends up being the most grim and depressing movie ever made by a major early comedian.  And the music puts the final nail in the coffin.  In fact Mont Alto has made a conscious choice to end the movie without a bang (literally, when the gun goes off there is... nothing), and to leave us in slow, soft, painful pathetic sadness.

It is AWFUL.  This is a version of ""Day Dreams"" I will NEVER watch again!  It is HORRIBLE.  Do not show this version to anyone new to Keaton unless you WANT to make them sick and refuse to see any further Keaton films.  YUCK!  MEH!

Now, a few of the the films are better off in this new set.  ""The Boat"" has much MUCH better music, which makes the film less of a downer.  However, in spite of Mr. Bromberg's statement in his Prologue, it appears to be exactly the same print as we've seen in the previous Kino releasewith all the same deficiencies.  However, ALL the new transfers in this set seem to be softer in focus than before (in the earlier edition of K756, you can see the FILM GRAIN!).  Nevertheless, I would show the new version to friends, since the music is SO much better.  ""Convict 13"" is BEYOND better!  The image in the previous Kino edition was actually unwatchable.  The new version here is WAY WAY better (and excellent music).  Also, ""The Love Nest"" and ""The Electric House"" have MUCH better image, and quite decent music.  I also prefer the music to the very watchable ""The Blacksmith"" in this new version.

~  ~  ~

So, for my money, you need several DVD or Blu-ray sets if you want to present Keaton to your friends and family in the best possible versions.

My recommendations (KEATON films only):

THIS NEW RELEASEI like
""The High Sign""
""One Week""
""The Scarecrow""
""Neighbors""
""The Boat""
""The Blacksmith""
""The Electric House""
""The Frozen North"" (in spite of the musicthe image is superior)
""The Love Nest""
""The Balloonatic"" (if you can handle the music)

KEATON PLUS (K230) for the best
""Hard Luck""  (that is, with music that won't make you throw your player out the window);

Kino's K131 dvd  ""THE GENERAL"",
for the very best ""Cops"" with music by Gaylord Carter (too bad this isn't a blu-ray);

The 2011
""THREE-DISC ULTIMATE EDITION BUSTER KEATON
  THE SHORT FILMS COLLECTION 1920-1923"" (K756)
for
  ""My Wife's Relations"" (the new set has the WRONG ENDING),
  ""Day Dreams"" (with way better music, funnier intertitles, and some stills to fill in the missing sections of film),
  ""The Paleface"" for a MUCH BETTER image, (AND if you prefer more cartoon-ish music [ I do ] ),
  ""The Goat"" (in my opinion, the music is a little better than in the new versionwhich is OK, by the way),
  and
  ""The Haunted House"" (better music).

ALSO, get the older (2011) K756 set if you want to SEE the best looking IMAGE for
""One Week"",
""The Boat"", and
""The Balloonatic"".

I also recommend THE BEST ARBUCKLE KEATON COLLECTION from Image Entertainment ID1854DSDVD for better musical accompaniments for some of the Arbuckle-Keaton shorts.  (Particularly ""Oh, Doctor!"")

Now... isn't it about time we start seeing some restored LUPINO LANE movies, and LARRY SEMON movies, and ALL of the sound HARRY LANGDON movies, the Charlie Chase HAL ROACH comedies, and...  so much more...?!",1465084800,11,5899,4.7379310344827585
7684017,5,B01CJCQG22,"This is an excellent release with entirely new transfers of Keaton's classic films, often in more complete prints and in better quality than those which have surfaced before.  Among the surprises are more footage for ""Day Dreams,"" a very different version of ""The Blacksmith,"" and an alternate ending for ""My Wife's Relations.""  The scores are lively, lovely and appropriate.  The image quality is excellent, far better than Lobster's earlier releases of the 1914-1917 Chaplin shorts.  All of the surviving Arbuckle-Keaton shorts are included here along with Buster's own releases from 1920 to 1923.",1464912000,14,599,5.408602150537634
7684018,3,B01CJCQG22,"I had hoped that a Blu-Ray transfer would have been better. I own Buster Keaton shorts in previous DVD releases and I can't see much if any improvement. Some of the bonus material is New to me, but not enough to justify the cost of the Blu-Ray set.",1464825600,7,248,4.1875
7684019,3,B01CJCQG22,"Nice to have the Arbuckle/Keaton shorts on Blu-ray, but ""Cops"" was sharper and clearer on the 2011 Keaton shorts box set. ""Daydreams"" just eliminates the stills that were edited into the short to fill in for the missing footage. ""Coney Island"" features a woman singing (!) on the audio track.  ""Hard Luck"" does have the missing ending but you can find that on ""Keaton Plus"". A somewhat disappointing release that I found to be only so-so. I prefer the 2011 Keaton shorts box set.",1464825600,8,479,4.7023809523809526

7684024,4,B01CJCQG22,"I loved the restoration of these films. I have been watching decayed nitrate scans on YouTube that didn't do any of these films justice. I like the original music with *one exception*: The soundtrack to ""Coney Island"" is a complete misfire. It is a repetitive vocal singing track that drove me crazy to the point I had to mute it. I wasn't happy about that as that is one of my favorite of the films.  If you re-issue this, please rethink the music on that film.*

Edit: I found there are some key title cards missing which help explain the action - I noticed this in ""The Cook"" and ""The Bellboy."" The missing card 2/3 of the way through ""The Cook"" explaining who the bad guy is and why he is  causing trouble makes it a little confusing. I don't know if this is because those cards aren't original and didn't make the cut for that reason, and I know less title cards is generally better, but in here I didn't find that was the case.",1468454400,8,933,4.2897727272727275
7684025,5,B01CJCQG22,Great job with the restorations,1467936000,,31,5.4
7684026,4,B01CJCQG22,"The lack of 5 stars is not because of any lack of effort to restore, nor because of the quality of the shorts, but because some of the films have gust suffered the ravages of time.  As a film archivist I have to rate the quality of films for what they exactly are regardless of this being the best surviving prints.
That said let me say that the efforts to bring this set to Blu-rayt are ***** five star, and the comedies themselves are the best there are.

Two BIG reasons for getting this: 1) Image stabilization giving a rock steady image. 2) Image clean -up to remove many scratches.

Quick guide for comparing the two Blu-rays: (+)= this new Lobster version is better, (-)= the original Kino Blu-ray was better.

The ARBUCKLE & KEATON COMEDIES on discs 1 & 2 are compared to the old Image & Kino DVDs.
(+) The new HD transfers of the ARBUCKLE-KEATON COMEDIES alone are worth picking up this set.  Previously we had two DVD sets from two different companies, Image Entertainment and Kino on Video.  Their transfers differed dramatically with each one containing better copies of some titles.  Frustrated fans had to keep both sets to get the best possible versions of each comedy.

Now for the FIRST TIME we get the BEST COPIES of each comedy in one complete set, throw out those old DVDs.  MOONSHINE remains the one eyesore.  The bulk of the films is the same soft, washed out 16mm print used in the old Kino on DVD release with fragments of 35mm nitrate inserted where available.  I remember the Image DVD having more surviving 35mm nitrate footage, possible it has deteriorated over the past 15 years.  All of the other Arbuckle-Keaton shorts are presented in very good 35mm transfers, sharp with good contrast.

disc 1
BUTCHER BOY (+) Overall good, better than the high contrast Image DVD transfer, about equal to the old Kino DVD.
ROUGH HOUSE (+) Lives up to its name, the print is rough with many scratches.  But it is better than the previous scratched DVDs.
HIS WEDDING NIGHT (+) Cleaner than the previous Image DVD, NEVER included in the Kino DVD set.
OH DOCTOR (+) Sharper than the previous Image DVD, NEVER included in the Kino DVD set.
CONEY ISLAND (+) Way better than the high-contrast crushed black & whites DVDs.
OUT WEST (+) the best ever copy of this. Note of interest is that it DIFFERS from the previous Kino DVD release!  The sequence of events differ and I believe this is the correct sequence.  The old Kino DVD came from a very chopped up and incomplete print, yes scenes are missing on that DVD.  Here on Blu-ray the short starts with Arbuckle hiding on a train.  The old Kino DVD starts with a choppy sequence in town at the saloon.  This scene, with additional footage, appears at the 3:41 point in the film.  The Kino DVD is also missing the ending of the film.  Character names are also changed, here the Villian is ""Wild Bill Hickup"" but on the old Kino DVD it is ""Black Heart Bill"".  The copboy on the drunk horse is called ""Lazy Cowboy"" here and ""Lonesome Cowboy"" on the old Kino DVD.
CONEY ISLAND ORIGINAL ENDING (+) Never before on DVD.  This non-PC racial joke is put as a bonus here so as not to affect the enjoyment of the comedy short.  Serge claims this was removed from the short in the 1920's re-issue, but I have seen this joke in much later  Three Stooges comedies.
Bonus RESTORATION DEMONSTRATION (+) Serge explains (in French with English subtitles) and shows us how multiple prints are used to assemble one uncut scene.

disc 2
THE BELL BOY (+) All copies of this have looked good, this is sharper.
MOONSHINE (+) For over 10 years we have had to keep both the Image & Kino DVDs for this one short, now both of those versions have been combined and edited together to give us the best presentation possible.  Sadly all but 6 minutes survive in a soft, washed out 16mm print, but the good 6 minutes from a sharp 35mm fragmented print have been edited in.
GOOD NIGHT, NURSE (+) We now have a good clean sharp print to enjoy.
THE COOK  (+) This was not on the Kino DVD set but appeared on the Milestone DVD.  This Blu-ray is significantly sharper with more details.  The old DVD crushed some blacks and the focus quite a bit softer. Point of interest, at the end a note appears on a lifesaver, the note is unreadable on the Milestone DVD so they superimposed the wording at the bottom of the screen. FRAMING on the Blu-ray shows more image all around most of the time.  Sometimes the DVD window-boxes the image, this doesn't happen on the Blu-ray.  The print used on the Blu-ray has less wear.
This Blu-ray clocks in at 19:51 while the Milestone DVD runs 22:01.  Running both discs in sync at the same time shows the DVD running slightly slower.
The Norsk Filminstitutt, George Eastman House & Nederlands Filmmuseum credits as well as background on the discovery of the lost film adds :37 seconds to the Milestone DVD.  At the end Milestone adds another :30 seconds of DVD production credits, so that totals 1:07 in new credits.
The Milestone DVD also adds newly created cast credits and a newly created introductory card ""The Bull Pup, a beachfront cafe"", adding another 20 seconds.
This Blu-ray recreates the titles in a font & border style similar to the original used in the Arbuckle-Keaton shorts.  The Milestone DVD used plane fonts with blue backgrounds. Milestone even created unnecessary new descriptive inter-titles to explain what you are seeing.  It is possible that the ending is missing from both releases and Milestone puts the text in from the original press kit describing what would be about 2 to 3 more minutes of film.  Whether this was actually films is unknown.
The Blu-ray is presented in B&W while the Milestone DVD is tinted blue.  I prefer the B&W as blue tinting at a sunny beach just looks wrong.
BACK STAGE (+) Image stabilization & restoration make this the best version.
THE HAYSEED (+) Image stabilization & restoration make this the best version. The Kino DVD was washed out.
THE GARAGE (+) Sharp with decent contrast is a big improvement over the old fuzzy-soft / washed out Kino DVD.

---The KEATON SOLO COMEDIES on the last three discs are compared to Kino's 2011 Blu-ray release prepared by Cohen Entertainment.---
disc 3
THE HIGH SIGN (+) This new release does not shake around like the old Blu-ray, and the image is much cleaner that the 'digitally restored' version on the older Blu-ray.
ONE WEEK (-) While this new version has a steadier image, the picture looks washed out. I prefer the old Blu-ray.
CONVICT 13 (+) The same source material seems to be used here as in the old Blu-ray, but more effort has been made to sharpen the image and improve the contrast.  I have heard of a better transfer on a German Blu-ray, but I have not seen this yet.
THE SCARECROW (+) The old Blu-ray was very grainy, this new presentation is from a finer master and much more appealing.
NEIGHBORS (+) Very similar here, but image stabilization and less grain make this new presentation better.
HAUNTED HOUSE, THE (+) The color tints are retained in this version, but strangely the titles are in B&W. Image stabilization improves this version.
HARD LUCK (+) Without a doubt this new 2K restoration makes the old Blu-ray presentation worthless. The ""lost"" ending was found in 1998 but was NOT included in the previous Blu-ray, thus making for an incomplete presentation. Now Lobster Films gives us the complete version of the film in Hi-Definition.  Serge admits the source material has defects that couldn't be removed, and you will see the ravages of time.  The opening sequence is also mastered from a better contrast print than the previous Blu-ray.

disc 4
THE GOAT (+) This new release removes heavy lines & water spots that are seen on the old Blu-ray. The image has been stabilized.
THE PLAYHOUSE (+) Image stabilization removes picture sway in the old Blu-ray release.  White specks & lines are also reduced.
THE BOAT (+) Sadly the Nitrate deterioration is still there, but negative scratches have been reduced and the image is stabilized.
THE PALEFACE (+) The picture has been cleaned up. White lines on the far left and white specks are gone. The image has been stabilized.
COPS (-) Ooooh, this is one step backwards.  The sharp perfect contrast presentation I boasted of in the previous Blu-ray release is NOT here.  We now revert back to the softer high-contrast print of the old DVDs.  You will want to keep the old Blu-ray for this title (see attached photos).
MY WIFE'S RELATIONS (+) This version has the newly found superior ending. The image has been stabilized, the old Blu-ray had upward shifts from splices.
MY WIFE'S RELATIONS 1:30 alternate & standard ending comparison (+) Newly found alternate ending is presented here for the first time alongside the common standard release ending.  I agree with Serge, this previously unseen ending is far superior to the common standard release one.  Just why it was removed is a mystery.

Disc 5
THE BLACKSMITH version A (-) This is very close to call, but I believe the first 2011 release is sharper.
THE BLACKSMITH version B (+) With newly found footage in this new presentation, this is the one to watch!
THE FROZEN NORTH (+) This new Lobster version has good contrast, the 2011 version had high contrast & washed out faces.
DAY DREAMS (-) or (+) The transfer looks the same, higher contrast. BUT the stills from supposed missing scenes are not included here.  There is a question about this, were these scenes mysteriously lost over the years or were they cut before the final release prints were made?  The 2011 version runs 23:06 with stills, this version runs slower at 24:28.  With this normal run time and the unlikely-hood that 4 separate scenes through out the picture would be lost to time has me agreeing with Lobster, these were never in the final release print.  The stills only illustrate what is already said in the letters from Buster, he may have felt that they slowed down the pace of the film.
THE ELECTRIC HOUSE (+) Lobster's new transfer has better contrast than the old release, but no color tints. The old 2011 release was color tinted yellow and Kino speculated on possible missing scenes at the beginning. The key phrase is ""speculated"".  Lobster assumes what we have is what was in the final release print.  At 22:47, I doubt much footage is lost.
THE BALLOONATIC (+) This new restoration is cleaner than the older untouched Kino release, but equal to their cleaned up version.
THE LOVE NEST (+) Without question this new tinted restoration by Lobster is far superior to the washed out transfer in the old Kine Blu-ray!

I do want to clarify one thing: Kino has NOTHING to do with the restoration work of these Blu-rays!  This new release was transferred and restored by LOBSTER FILMS,  the older Kino Blu-ray release was transferred and restored by Cohen Entertainment using films in their own collection.
Some have questioned why a few of the older Blu-ray transfers look sharper than this set, it is because two different companies using different archives, worked on these releases.",1467676800,80,11044,4.6804550155118925
7684027,5,B01CJCQG22,"As the liner notes explain in this boffo five disc set of Buster Keaton's works with his mentor and good friend Roscoe Arbuckle,and his own works thereafter,these films are not copies of past releases but totally reconstructed elements/films from around the world. For instance we have two versions of The Blacksmith. The one we thought was the original turns out was a test/preview print that was never intended for general release. Now we finally get that version AND the released version,with about four minutes of entirely different footage. Then there is the original ending of Coney Island. As Keaton would use a similar gag in his Seven Chances years later,for some reason in this set they use the film version we are all familiar with(instead of inserting at the end where it should be) and have opted instead to have you view it as a stand alone bit of footage. That I cannot understand. Speaking of Coney Island,I should tell you also that the producers have opted to have a singer accompany the musicians on this track. All the songs are period pieces mostly relating to Coney Island. While I was aware that this was something usually smaller theatres did back in the day,this might catch many off guard who might never have heard it done before. I thought it worked fairly well.
You will not get Keaton's early works in any better condition and completeness than you see them here. Heretofore to buy all of these shorts in previous sets(and not nearly in the condition they are presented in here) you would have had to have paid a kings ransom. Now they are here all together and in great condition at a relatively reasonable price. It is a set no Keaton fan or silent film buff should be without.",1467504000,2,1709,4.7
7684028,4,B01CJCQG22,"I got the ""Ultimate"" editions of ""Steamboat Bill"" and ""The General"", they were pretty good so I got to thinking I'd get a ""Shorts"" collection. At the time all Kino offered was the ""Buster Keaton Short Films Collection"" (Keaton's independent shorts made 1920-23). I would've considered buying that one but at least one reviewer recommended getting Masters of Cinema ""Buster Keaton The Complete Short Films 1917-23"" (including his Fatty Arbuckle collaborations) from Amazon UK. It was in Region 2 PAL format but that wasn't a problem for mepretty good DVD set.

Lobster was involved with that set and has collaborated with Kino on this collection as well. If you have the British 4 DVD set go ahead and buy this one, otherwise skip it and just buy Kino's release.
Pro
1. Better set of extras at Kino
2. The 6+ minute fragment of ""Moonshine"" that Masters of Cinema had is presented here in full length form (that looked good, I haven't watched the Kino version)
3. M of C put a 180 page book with their set, not worth a lot- mostly some people commenting on some of the films. Kino has included a much smaller but vastly more informative booklet, only thing wrong with it is the tiny print.
Con
Only one reallyI found the M of C films to be not very ""restored"", some of the offerings especially scratchy at the start. I was hoping Kino had done more cleanup work for this editionnot as much as I'd hoped for. So far I've watched only ""The Scarecrow"" and ""Neighbors"", no real scratch improvement.

The visual quality of these are the best I've seen, although naturally some of the film doe exhibit the ravages of time. These folks at Kino Lobster put tremendous effort in researching and finding the best film source materials to transfer these films to DVD. Indeed in some cases scenes that were missing or shorts thought to best are here for us to enjoy. I was very impressed with the Arbuckle / Keaton shorts, they made some real gems, and their collaborative efforts together shine. You get a real favor of each mans talents and can tell on screen which creative force was behind the gags. You see Keaton develope and polish his technique as he embraced the film medium more and more. In fact I'd wish they made more films together. The Keaton shorts continue to impress me, Keaton's unique approach and perspectives to life situations amaze me. My favorites are 'HardLuck' , 'The Paleface' , 'the Boat', 'One Week' .
