5557743,3,B00B58943U,"Castaneda (Gabriel Pingarrn) is a satanist drug dealer that has Mexico City in an uproar. Potty mouthed detective Magdalena (Gizeht Galatea) goes back to her home town to find Don Carlos, a curandero. What she gets is his son, also named Don Carlos (Jos Carlos Ruiz). Don Carlos is a bit of a skeptic, but also has visions of demons as he touches items. His twofold nature wasn't utilized to it comic potential.

This twosome follows the trail of the evil Castaneda as they try to figure up what he is up to.

This film was made in 2005. While it has blood and gore, it lacks the killing and mutilation scenes common in the American counterpart. For some strange reason, the film tosses in a guy (Ernesto Yez)  who is the only person in Mexico who believes in Mithraism. I didn't get his connection.

The film is slow developing and half way into the production you realize it is not getting better. Still, it had some interesting scenes which involve confrontations between Castaneda and Don Carlos that are in part a vision. Without these scenes the film would be a total waste.

The film is dubbed in both English and Spanish with English having a good translation. Not on my recommended list. Three stars is pushing it.

5557744,4,B00B58943U,"This is a low budget b-horror movie (from mexico I suppose based on the location).  While it's not high brow stuff for what it is, it's a decent horror/drama movie.  There's shades of a lot of older horror movies from the direction and gore similar to the grindhouse genre and lucio fulci's movies.  I personally can't stand watching fulci movies (to me the plot drags too much) but this one was somewhat better paced and decently watchable.  I guess you could call it a hybrid movie because it takes a lot of the older conventions in this genre and lumps them together; it works in this case and the practical effects are top notch for this budget (there was zero cgi from what I could tell).

Personally, I find a lot of these plots, situations, and actions (in these types of movies) preposterously hilarious and this movie delivers them intentionally or unintentionally.  Early on in the movie police officers won't enter their police station because of the bloodbath that took place, so the main character ""purifies"" the station and to prove it is purified he takes a bucket of body parts from the bloodbath and dumps them down the steps; it doesn't sound really funny but it was to me.  Then all of a sudden (in the middle of a gunbattle) when the main character is scared out of his mind, he suddenly takes a gun, becomes an expert marksman, and kills most of the attacking bad guys with assault rifles without cover single shot per guy!  They go to visit don chi chi, the leader of a mythra cult, in a graveyard and he's a just sitting on top of a crypt to keep ""an enemy"" at bay and apparently he lives on a chair on top of a grave marker.  There is a lot of this kind of humor in this movie; preposterous and ridiculous situations.

You basically have a mexican ""preacher"" (or maybe practitioner of folk magic is a better definition) who has to bring a serial ritualistic (?) murderer and his cult to justice (pretty much).  Lot's of gore, some decent action, and the plot is somewhat different than most horror movies I've seen.

You can either watch it with subtitles or dubbed.  The dubbing and transcription for the english subtitles are pretty well done (I usually watch movies with english subtitles even when they're speaking english).  They're dubbed with a bit of a ""spanish"" accent so it feels more authentic than just pulling in people without accents to do the dubbing work (this movie takes place in mexico).",1363996800,2,2431,4.584295612009238
5557745,4,B00B58943U,"Both my wife and I really enjoyed this movie.  It was much better than we anticipated.  The story was really good, the acting and special effects were very well done.  From the description it sounded like it might be a cheap movie with no plot.  We were quite surprised.  The only problem that I had is that they messed with the sound volume too much and you have to watch it with your finger on the volume.  When they talk it is quiet and during the action/horror scenes it was very loud.
The scary scenes were done very well and we did get a few jumps here and there.  A lot of times I said ""that part was pretty cool"".  I would recommend it.  It is even good for mid to late teenagers, probably not for kids younger than high school age.
Give it a shot, you won't be disappointed!",1363132800,2,783,4.166666666666667
5557746,2,B00B58943U,"There's nothing wrong with doing favours for friends, but writer-director Eduardo Rodriguez owes Robert Rodriguez (no relation) big time. The tag `Robert Rodriguez presents' affixed to Curandero (occasionally subtitled Dawn of the Demon) is the primary reason most people will be drawn to Venezuelan-born Eduardo Rodriguez's 2005 film, a slice of South-of-the-border ritualistic black magic adapted (by Rodriguez and Luz Maria Rojas) from an original screenplay by Robert Rodriguez himself. Most will be disappointed.

The story begins as Mexico City detective Magdalena Garcia (Gizeht Galatea) calls upon the services of Carlos Gutierrez (Carlos Gallardo), who has inherited his late father's occupation of curandero, a kind of exorcist who specializes in purifying people and places tainted by black magic. Magdalena begs Carlos to carry out a purification of her police precinct, which the local federales believe to be cursed following a bloody escape by local cult leader and black magic practitioner by the name of Castaneda. Plagued by doubts and with little faith in the supernatural beliefs of his father and his countrymen, Carlos is reluctant to accept the assignment, faking his way through the purification ritual in order to release the precinct from its `curse', and agreeing to help Magdalena with the investigation. No sooner has their pursuit of the mysterious Castaneda begun, however, than Carlos is visited by terrifying visions of the kind of blood-soaked rituals in which Castaneda specializes. Has Carlos inherited his father's gift? Or the madness that led to his death?

Like the Patrick Tatopoulos-designed creature that lurks in the bowels of Rodriguez's complex and occasionally confusing story, Curandero is a strange beast, attempting a blend of crime thriller and horror movie in a style reminiscent of From Dusk Till Dawn, but without the tongue-in-cheek campiness that made that film such a blast. Rodriguez (Eduardo) insists on filming everything with an extreme version of that bleached-out, high-contrast photography that has become a TV clich for scenes set South of the border, lending the entire film an unconvincing stylistic color palette which keeps the action at a distance. The director has also saddled himself with a leading man whose passing resemblance to Peter Lorre is more interesting than his performance, and a lead actress whose acting skills are no match for her complicated backstory. Whatever merits Robert Rodriguez's original script may have had, Eduardo Rodriguez and fellow re-writer Luz Maria Rojas appear to have little faith in it, dressing it up with plentiful inserts of horror clichs - sometimes excused as Carlos' bloody visions, sometimes purely arbitrary - instead of using Rodriguez's plotting to build a sense of dread. With no real investment in the characters, their plight remains of little interest, even when the film mutates into a full-blown monster movie in the third act. It's a film that could do with a purification of its own, turning down the color desaturation, toning down the flash-frame inserts, and putting more faith in Robert Rodriguez's storytelling.",1363046400,7,3144,5.427402862985685

A curandero is a psychic healer who ""purifies"" people and places in attempts to protect them from demons.  This particular curandero is recruited by a female detective to capture the evil Castanedo, the leader of a killer cult.
Much of the film is loaded with rapid flashes of gore and violence but the script is derivative and muddled.  Nothing really to recommend.",1364515200,,529,5.127906976744186
