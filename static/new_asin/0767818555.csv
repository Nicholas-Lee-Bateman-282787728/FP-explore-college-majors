7788953,4,0767818555,"The 20th Anniversary tape was great. You got a taste of Archie Bunker from beginning to end. Archie shocked us out of the gate, but then he filled us with laughter by the home stretch. We began to understand that Archie himself was innocently ignorant of people. My favorite line in Archie meets Sammy was ""I know you had no choice in being colored but whatever made you turn Jew?
When you watch this and hear him say this you will see that he actually does not mean any disrespect and it actually comes off very funny. Watch this tape with a light heart and be ready for lots of laughs.",1009843200,2,587,4.297297297297297
7788954,4,0767818555,"This box set definitely contains 9 of the best episodes of the All in the Family series.  There is the pilot, which gave a great introduction to all four main characters.  There is the episode about Gloria's miscarriage, and the one about her second pregnancy a few years later, where we definitely see the tender side of curmudgeon Archie.  There is the antagonism-filled episode where a flashback showed how Archie met Mike and started the love-hate relationship which was the backbone of the series.  There are the two hilarious episodes about the Jeffersons, the one where they first moved into the neighborhood, and the wonderful episode when they came to the Bunker house for dinner, which resulted in a hilarious racial argument.  I think it is just wonderful that this set contains an episode about Edith's cantankerous but very funny cousin Maude.  And last, but certainly not least, there is my personal favorite episode, where Sammy Davis Jr. visits the Bunker house, and it looks as if Archie has met his match.  If you are an avid All in the Family fan, this box set is certainly for you.",995414400,15,1101,4.7936507936507935
