5087441,4,B007I1Q4NQ,"Fun to watch, not terribly deep but I did gain some general knowledge of flying reptiles (are they really considered dinosaurs?).  It interested me enough to go and read a book.",1374105600,,177,4.709677419354839
5087442,5,B007I1Q4NQ,"National Geographic has (finally) used CGI that is worthy of the topic and approaches that used by the BBC.  Sir David Attenborough (as usual) is outstanding, and the subject is one that is long overdue for quality treatment (which it receives here).  The only complaint I have is that at 40 minutes, it is too brief - I would have gladly watched (and paid for) much more.  Highly recommended.",1369872000,,393,4.666666666666667
5087443,3,B007I1Q4NQ,I bought the DVD version and was very happy.  Then I saw and bought this 3D version and it is beautiful.  But 30min. were cut out or deleted.  I was really mad.  What happened to the other 30 min.?  I suspect they left out those parts where it wasn't 3D.  That's NO EXCUSE!  I could live with some parts not in 3D.  I feel cheated!  False advertising!  At the very least they could have indicated this on the label before people buy it.  SO WARNING-- You will not get the full 70 min.  ONLY 40 min. runtime.,1364428800,16,507,4.11340206185567
5087444,5,B007I1Q4NQ,"I bought the movie for my grandson. He has 1 brother and two sisters. They, mommy and daddy all loved the film.",1362873600,,111,4.090909090909091
5087445,2,B007I1Q4NQ,I bought this as a gift for my husband thinking that it was a full-length movie (90 to 120 minutes).  It turned out to only be 30 minutes.  We were very disappointed.,1362873600,6,166,4.15625
5087446,5,B007I1Q4NQ,was SOOOOOOOO AWESOME & AMAZED BY THIS MOVIE~~~~~~~~~~~ BUY IT THE 3D IS GOOD SO IS THE COLOR!! YES!... YES!!!,1360195200,2,110,4.55
5087447,5,B007I1Q4NQ,"This is a good and well made british show that was made for imax type screens. It was shown on imax screens in the u.s. I have the europeon version that is 20 minutes longer and has alot more information on it. That version in at 50Hz and it did work on my panasonic vt television as well as my panasonic 3d blu ray player. it has a extra feature , the making of , on it too. Not all players or tv's can handle 50 hz blu rays though. If you want to play it safe then get the u.s. one. As to why they felt the need to cut out 20 minutes on the u.s. version ,when they didn't have to is beyond me. My version is filled with great cgi effects , some of which are very amazing. It tells of the evolution and change in the terrasaurs over 150 million years , from small reptiles to warm blooded tailess creatures filling many niches in nature. So it's worth owning for the info alone and the 3d scenes look great too. Plus it's done by david attenbourgh who is just a awesome narrator and scientist who has many credits under his belt.",1342137600,11,1030,4.029268292682927
5087448,1,B007I1Q4NQ,"UGH! With the exception of some intriguing scientific information, this is quite possibly the worst 3D movie I've seen.

The animation is grade school level. Almost unwatchable. And the 3D is not dramatic or eye-catching. It might as well have been flat!

This will never get watched a second time.",1341705600,7,298,4.94
5087449,5,B007I1Q4NQ,"This feature is currently being shown in IMAX theaters and is presented in this package in Blu-Ray 2D & 3D as well as DVD format.  Under such circumstances, there is always a danger that spectacular visuals will allow the filmmaker to shortchange the audience on content.  Two words prevent that from occurring in this instance--David Attenborough.  Attenborough is a legendary master filmmaker as well as an unparalleled interpreter of the natural world.  If he has made a bad film in the last forty years I must have missed it, and I do not miss anything that he has been involved with if I can help it.  In this instance, Flying Monsters is a brilliant and technically masterful examination of the lives and evolution of the prehistoric flying reptiles known as pterosaurs. Attenborough suggests that pterosaurs evolved from gliding lizards and that they were initially adapting to feed on the vast clouds of insects found in prehistoric skies.  It was of course inevitable that some life forms would find a way to exploit this abundant food source. He further notes that the earliest pterosaurs were poor fliers and illustrates this point with struggling and awkward Dimorphodons.  Later, as pterosaurs evolved further, they became significantly more aerodynamic and their diet also diversified.  In one particularly funny scene, Attenborough pilots a modern glider next to a giant Quetzalcoatlus. In concluding this stunning and wonderful film, Attenborough expresses doubt that the asteroid strike on earth 65 million years ago was the primary reason for pterosaur extinction.  Rather, he suggests that a more important reason for their passing from the planet was that they were outcompeted by birds.",1340150400,18,1707,5.2234432234432235

8516986,5,B007I1Q4NQ,Great 3D special effects and a good narrative I enjoy watching this in 3D and am learning about terrorsaurs on top of it. Great for young minds and will keep them interested.,1448668800,2,174,4.46875

8516991,5,B007I1Q4NQ,"I tried to watch it in IMAX and got a headache! I'm so glad it came out on DVD, so I could enjoy it at home. And, David Attenborough is always delightful!",1391299200,2,154,3.84375
8516992,2,B007I1Q4NQ,40 mins is too short for a Blu-ray documentary. I see too little value to replay this documentary again. There are many other better documentaries by David Attenborough than this one.,1378944000,4,183,4.935483870967742
8516993,3,B007I1Q4NQ,"I was hoping for a bit more science from this, more about Pterosaur anatomy, thoughts on the various habitats different species were thought to have inhabited and such but instead got a video that is mainly an entertainment vehicle. It's OK but nothing I didn't already know from my reading elsewhere. I imagine that people with less background in Pterosaurs will enjoy it and give it 5 stars.",1377734400,4,393,4.794117647058823
