Gruberova may be a slightly old looking Violetta, and Shicoff also a little old and earnest.  Zancanaro is simply wonderful; together these singers can easily bring tears to your eyes.  A highly recommended rendition of this great score.",1129161600,12,380,5.614035087719298
2241380,5,B0007TFI9W,"Gruberova is wonderful in this performance, with luscious changes of texture and amplitude, especially in her upper register, showing tremendous control combined with artistic sense at every breath and glance. Shicoff may take a few minutes to get used to, but soon I felt his romantic attachment and admired his beautiful singing, as well. I actually prefer him to almost all other Alfredos, albeit his voice is not quite as strong as some, but he, like Gruberova, showed artistry and did not throw away a note and maintained phrasing. I love this recording. There is certainly no ""definitive"" Traviata, but this is certainly in my short list!",1123977600,20,644,5.02803738317757
2241381,5,B0007TFI9W,"This the best La Traviata I've ever seen/heard on DVD.  Gruberova sounds like a blend of the best of Sutherland and Caballe.  She sings the most difficult coloratura as if it's childsplay.  The timbre of her voice is gorgeous!  This is vastly better than Zeffirelli's (sp?) latest version that features a listless Violetta and a cramped staging.  My only critique is that Shicoff (Alfredo) looks rather goofy and unattractive.  His voice if fine - just not the kind of man women dream about ...

Gruberova makes Sills and Angela G. pale by comparison.  Her gowns look like something Garbo would have worn.  The sets and ambience (the world's most gorgeous opera house)add a special magic to this fantasy version of one of Verdi's masterpieces.",1123459200,21,743,4.92741935483871
2241382,5,B0007TFI9W,"Verdi's creative genius must have been running white hot when he composed this lovely poignant masterpiece and not surprisingly it has remained one of the world's favourite operas ever since. However, it requires a sympathetic sensitive approach for any production to do its treasures full justice. This recording of a live performance, in the venue where the opera originally received its premier, certainly meets the challenge! Indeed I found the entire production quite exceptional.

Central to this success is Edita Gruberov's outstanding performance. Whether being enchanting and beautiful at her soire in Act 1, or distraught and appealing in Act 2, through to the difficulties of the ending in Act 3, musically, vocally and dramatically she is absolutely superb.  Her lovely bright soprano takes on wonderful subtle shades of tone and her controlled pianissimo is at times unbelievable. Hers is no mere role, she is Violetta.

Her fellow principles are scarcely less admirable. Arguably Verdi gives the elder Germont some of the best arias in the opera and Giorgio Zancanaro makes the most of these. A commanding presence on stage, his powerful rich baritone provides the perfect foil for the diva, matching her for artistry and depth of feeling. Together in scene one of Act 2, they produce, what is perhaps the highlight of the opera for me.  I find myself replaying it time and again, yet still finding some new subtle nuance previously overlooked.

Neil Schicoff as Alfredo is also in fine voice, but vocally he may lack a little of the finesse constantly exhibited by his fellow principles. Also, to be really nit picky, I found his tendency to sweat under the lights a tad distracting. That being said, his acting is up there on the same exalted plain as the others.

Conductor Carlo Rizzi draws splendid playing from the resident orchestra in nice balance with the vocal lines. He is spacious in the lyrical passages, whilst making the most of Verdi's exciting rhythms to drive the more dramatic passages.

Verdi's choruses are always an integral part of his attraction and in this production they will surely not disappoint. Oh yes, and there is a little makeweight in the form of a delightful cameo ballet appearance by Gabrielle Brown in Act 2, scene 2.

The atmosphere created by the Teatro la Fenice, together with the simple but well designed sets and colourful costumes are all part of the production's overall charm. As with all such recordings one catches a few extraneous sounds and audience noise, but this never becomes too intrusive; neither is the spontaneous applause after some of the major arias. Indeed one feels like joining in.

I am aware that there are several versions of this opera available, but I am not in a position to make comparisons as this is the only one I have experienced.  However, I feel it would take the harshest possible critic to find too much at fault with this one. Personally I am really enthusiastic about this DVD.  In fact I absolutely love it and if I could award it more than five stars I would not hesitate to do so.",1122249600,26,3080,4.892514395393474
2241383,5,B0007TFI9W,"Gruberova is inspired in this traditionally staged and beautifully  sung Traviata. From the very beginning you know this is going to be something very special: with Rizzi in the pit and Gruberova and Shicoff on the stage in Act 1 singing, acting and conducting are beyond praise. And from there is just gets better and better until the final tragic ending. As much as I raved over Kathleen Battle in the recently released L'elisir, and my comments there are not about to change. But I am simply left without words to describe Gruberova's performance. From piano to forte, her timber is extremely beautiful, very moving and with her acting we are  watching a life story not a musical  drama. Shicoff is in equal vocal estate and as always is very moving. There is no more sincere an artist than he. His Rudolfo with Cotrubas is equally compelling but that hasn't made it to DVD. That Royal Opera performance still remains languishing in the VHS vaults somewhere.. Zancanaro fills out the noble trio with splendor and vocal drama. Rizzi looks very young but his conducting is magnificent catching all the nuances and making no melody trite or inconsequential. This dvd adds to the growing list of must haves. I don't think the singers here can be overrated, especially Gruberova who is just simply stunning, beautiful, you choose the adjective.  Listen, try and buy. Am I the only opera buff who thinks these recordings are worth having? Am I deluded?  Nobody is reviewing these treasures. You can certainly own your opinion but let's here it. I can't be the only one impressed with these recently released opera dvds. Happy viewing and listening!",1116115200,55,1645,4.860714285714286

2241407,5,B0007TFI9W,"This 1992 La Traviata depicts a truly classic era of performances of this heart-rending opera so beloved by millions. It's filmed in the Gran Teatro La Fenice, Venice, where La Traviata was premiered on March 6, 1853. (This original opera house was destroyed by fire in 1996 and rebuilt.)

In this performance, Edita Gruberova is every inch...La Dame aux camelias...the Grande Dame of the Camellias. Her voice is impeccable and her portrayal of Violetta is that of a passive heroine submitting ladylike to her fate. Just when she has regained her reason to live in the arms of her beloved Alfredo, her life is snuffed out like a candle.

No stranger to chronic illness myself, I prefer a more vibrant portrayal of Violetta Valery more like that of Anna Netrebko in the 2005 Salzburg Festival production on DVD. This Violetta lives unstoppably each day and defies fate to strike her down right up to her very last moments.

I've always believed that Neil Shicoff was vocally destined for the role of Alfredo Germont. I've seen him portray Alfredo live with more more fire than he shows here. I was struck by how Hoffmann-like this Alfredo is, as though, Shicoff is combining La Traviata with Les Contes d'Hoffmann, in an Alfredo inebriated now just with love but love for yet another woman soon to be lost to him.

In a newspaper interview with Neil Shicoff which was published in 1986, I wrote that Neil Shicoff ""has an innate sense of drama and a voice that angels might envy."" This is very evident here.

La Traviata is very dear to my heart as Giuseppe Verdi's finest opera.",1266364800,2,1577,4.72
2241408,4,B0007TFI9W,"The popular Verdi opera returns to his theater debut.
La traviata is one of the most popular operas of Giuseppe Verdi. His live music and graceful charms the public since the nineteenth century. Your BDS is recognized even by those who are not in the business. Recorded by the greatest sopranos of the last century, either in audio or video, creates a stigma in today's singers. How to write an opera that has been performed by Bidu Sayao with grace, with dramatic Callas, Tebaldi by gently and skillfully Sutherland. Workhorses of famous singers, La Traviata and intimidating defies all current singer.
Edita Gruberova seems not to fear the ghosts of passado. Sua Violet turns into a woman of dubious reputation in the beginning, that is gaining maturity. The watershed in Traviata are the arias, is strano! It strano!, Ah, fors' lui che l'anima, Follie! Follie! Delirium vano  questo e Semper Libera. Transpose those parts masterfully reveals the grandeur of a singer, on the other hand, singing badly indicates that the rest of the opera will be long and painful for the audience. Gruberova past this part with great skill, his mature voice, treble coloraturas easy and perfect fit the requirements of the score. Regular theatrical performance, but the whole work is not even cold. Can the beautiful voice overcome the lack of action thrilling spectator. Reserve the best for last, his Addio, del past is poignant, sad, nostalgic, recalling happier days with the beloved, and showing all the pain of knowing that the end is near.
The recording is from 1992, so we saw the evolution of this singer. His video of Manon in 1983 with the Staatsoper until this Traviata shows that the years have been beneficial to his voice. Other singers come in vocal decline with age, it improves. The brightness is not the same youth, but the technique is superb. We have newer versions, such as Lucia di Lammermoor in Tokyo in 1996 and Beatrice di Tenda in 2001 recorded in Zurich, evidence that by this time the singer was still in excellent Czech vocal form.
Alfredo Germont is the love interest with Violet. Passionate and naive will live with a loved one without worrying about costs and consequences of taking a relationship. Spoiled kid gets angry with his beloved to let him, thinking that she had returned to partying. Neil Schicoff has the task of representing this guy good life. With scenic reasonable performance and excellent voice he can do the trick. Tenor good treble, clear voice that is characterized as lyrical. We saw better sing, your Hoffman in Scala di Milano in 1998 is impeccable, unfortunately his Alfredo is not the same level.
Giorgio Zancanaro is the role of Giorgio Germont. This does not accept the marriage of her son Alfredo with Violet. When static and build your character seriously hard and sensitive. Baritone voice clear and short length, struggling to reach the lower notes. Can you sing well his main aria, ""Di Provenza, il mar, but not enough to be an unforgettable presentation. Other baritones sing this role brilliantly, like Renato Bruson.
The governing Carlo Rizzi follows the score with fidelity, and a correct time Italian musicality are your strengths. The orchestra of La Fenice is experienced in Verdi, with good strings and wood.
The production of the dvd chose to show the opening the Venice canals leading to the La Fenice theater, ingenious solution that avoids the traditional. Always displays the maestro conducting. The economic scenarios leave the stage clean, do not fall into the trap of the extreme load hall Violet. The period costumes are consistent with the production, beautiful and representative. The leadership void and creativity shown conservative and no innovations. Highlight positive for the second scene of Act II, the chorus and ballet represented well the festive mood of the house of Flora.
The sound of the dvd are in good level, but how are the analog matrix are not good enough for the recording of digital matrix. The direction of shooting misses keep the cameras almost always static, failing to show the feature of the singers in the crucial moments.
The curiosity of this video is La traviata have its premiere at La Fenice, the site of recording of this DVD. Failure at the premiere and future success. Dvd recommended for those who like the traditional version of opera, without innovations, good voices and performances scenic medians.

  A popular pera de Verdi volta ao seu teatro de estria.
  La traviata  uma das mais populares peras de Giuseppe Verdi. Sua msica viva e graciosa encanta o pblico desde o sculo XIX. Seu Brindisi  reconhecido at por quem no  do ramo. Gravada pelos maiores sopranos do sculo passado, seja em udio ou em vdeo , gera um estigma nas cantoras atuais. Como gravar uma pera que j foi cantada por Bidu Sayo com graa, por Callas com dramaticidade, por Tebaldi com delicadeza e por Sutherland com maestria. Cavalo de batalha de cantoras clebres , La Traviata intimida e desafia toda cantora atual.
  Edita Gruberova parece no temer os fantasmas do passado. Sua Violeta se transforma em uma mulher de reputao duvidosa no incio, que vai ganhando maturidade. O divisor de guas na Traviata so as rias,  strano!  strano!, Ah, fors' lui Che l'anima, Follie! Follie! Delrio vano  questo e Sempre Libera. Transpor esses trechos com maestria revela a grandiosidade de uma cantora, por outro lado, cantar mal indica que o restante da pera ser longo e doloroso para a platia. Gruberova passa por essa parte com maestria, sua voz madura, de agudos fceis e coloraturas perfeitas se adapta as exigncias da partitura. Atuao cnica regular,mas o conjunto da obra no chega a ser frio. Consegue com a bela voz suplantar a falta de atuao emocionando o espectador. Reserva o melhor para o final, seu Addio , del passado  comovente, triste, nostlgico , recordando os dias felizes com o amado e, mostrando toda a dor de saber que o fim est prximo.
  A gravao  de 1992, vimos assim a evoluo dessa cantora. Sua  Manon em vdeo de 1983 com a Staatsoper at essa Traviata mostra que os anos foram benficos para sua voz . Outras cantoras entram em decadncia vocal com a idade , ela aprimora . O brilho no  o mesmo da juventude, mas a tcnica  soberba. Temos verses mais recentes,  como a Lucia di Lammermoor de Tquio em 1996  ou a Beatrice di Tenda de 2001 gravada em Zurich,  provas que at essa data a cantora Tcheca continuava em excelente forma vocal.
  Alfredo Germont faz o par romntico com Violeta. Apaixonado e ingnuo vai morar com a amada sem se preocupar com despesas e as conseqncias de assumir um relacionamento. Garoto mimado se irrita com a amada por deix-lo, pensando que ela voltara a farra. Neil Schicoff tem a incumbncia de representar esse rapaz boa vida. Com atuao cnica razovel e voz excelente ele consegue dar conta do recado. Tenor de bons agudos , voz clara que o caracteriza como lrico . J o vimos cantar melhor, seu Hoffman no Scala di Milano em 1998  impecvel, infelizmente seu Alfredo no se encontra no mesmo nvel.
  Giorgio Zancanaro faz o personagem de Giorgio Germont. Esse no aceita a unio de seu filho Alfredo com Violeta. Sempre esttico e srio constri seu personagem duro e sensvel. Bartono de voz clara e de curta extenso, sofre para atingir as notas mais graves. Consegue cantar bem sua principal ria, Di Provenza, il mar, mas no chega a ser uma apresentao inesquecvel. Outros bartonos  cantam esse papel de maneira brilhante, como Renato Bruson.
  A regncia de Carlo Rizzi segue a partitura com fidelidade, tempos corretos e uma musicalidade italiana so seus pontos fortes. A orquestra do La Fenice  experiente em Verdi, com boas cordas e madeiras .
  A produo do dvd optou por mostrar na abertura os canais de Veneza que levam ao teatro La Fenice, soluo engenhosa que foge do tradicional. Sempre se exibe o maestro regendo. Os cenrios econmicos deixam o palco limpo, no caem no erro de carregar ao extremo o salo de Violeta . Os figurinos de poca condizem com a produo, bonitos e representativos. A direo nula e sem criatividade se mostra conservadora e sem inovaes. Destaque positivo para a segunda cena do segundo ato, o coro e o bal representaram bem o clima festivo da casa de Flora.
  A imagem e o som do dvd esto em bom nvel, mas como so se matriz analgica deixam a desejar para as gravaes de matriz digital. A direo de filmagem peca em manter as cmeras quase sempre estticas, deixando de mostrar a feio dos cantores nos momentos cruciais.
  A curiosidade desse vdeo  La traviata ter sua estria no La Fenice, local da gravao desse dvd. Fracasso na estria e sucesso no futuro. Dvd recomendado para quem gosta de verso tradicional de pera, sem inovaes, boas vozes e atuaes cnicas medianas.

His pain and joys are clearly felt and alomst unbearable.  He is strong yet senstive.  Their acting is superb, every jesture is meaningfull and beautiful.

2241410,5,B0007TFI9W,"Yes of course Mme Gruberova is fabulous; that's how she exists.

I direct your attention to Mr. Shicoff.  I have been listening to and watching performances of La Traviata for approximately 50 years.  I'm used to it.  But I was amazed at Mr. Shicoff's acting in Act I, and blown away in Act II, Scene 1 (when I had to ask someone to bring on the Kleenex) and, at the end of Scene 2 found myself sobbing.

Mr. Shicoff is the ONLY tenor of my 50 years listening who shows any acquaintance whatsoever with the writings of Dumas Pere et Fils.  He's not pretty to look at, he doesn't try to eclipse everyone within miles of his stardome - he just recreates Alfredo.  And breaks one's heart, for Dumas Fils was a gentleman to his fingertips and had a heart that could break.

The only critique I have of this DVD is that  Mr. Shicoff's Act II Scene 1 cavatina was cut.  With an actor like him, we could have used it.  Savored it.  If there were more tenors around like him, but there aren't and never will be, this opera could be performed as ""ALFREDO"".

Mr. Shicoff is the tenor who should have shared Traviata with Mme Callas.",1149638400,19,1122,4.311004784688995
2241411,5,B0007TFI9W,"I don't remember being this moved by a production of La Traviata in a long time. Are you interested in FEELING the opera in addition to seeing and hearing it? Climb aboard.

The three leads are in gorgeous voice, devastatingly dramatic in their respective roles. It took me a little while to warm up to Edita Gruberova's Violetta, but by opera's end I was sold. Her Addio del passato(performed uncut) ranks with the best I've heard, and her physical performance improves over the course of the opera, culminating in a flawless rendition of the character's deterioration, redemption, death, etc. Neil Shicoff might not look the part of Alfredo(he's rather bookish for the ardent loverboy), but his voice is lovely and resounding, and one gets the feeling that if the tenor were blessed with the smoldering looks of a Placido Domingo, he would be much more well known and appreciated. Giorgio Zancanaro is perfect as the elder Germont, making the character more sympathetic than(perhaps) he has a right to be. The final scene is shattering, with both men huddled together, impotently watching Violetta fade out, coming to the realization that they have just been playing roles imposed on them by the society they live in while Violetta is the only real person among them, the only character in the drama who has truly lived, and one gets the impression that these two sad and regretful men feel unworthy to be in the same room with such a soaring free spirit. It's a magnificent bit of acting on the parts of Shicoff and Zancanaro. The fact that Gruberova's Violetta doesn't bear any grudges only reinforces her superiority, and her death is exultant, both vocally and dramatically.

The sets are beautiful, somewhat dark, less detailed and opulent than in some productions but no less effective. Carlo Rizzi's conducting is slower than the norm but rarely to the point of being plodding or distracting. There are a couple of cuts in the score, but unfortunately that's a common practice with Traviata unless the conductor is Solti or Levine. In this case, the excisions aren't damaging to the overall performance, just a little annoying.

I own two DVDs of La Traviata, this one and the Solti/Gheorghiu production. I'm not going to pick one over the other because both are wonderful. My advice: if you can only buy one Traviata, play a game of eeny meeny miny mo, if not, grab them both.",1139788800,23,2386,4.857493857493857

Every note from her is just pure gold.  Traviata is not an easy role but it does not pose any problems for Gruberova. She is Traviata.  I bet this is Gruberova at her very very best.  Schicoff and Zancanaro are both very good.  Schicoff's voice is kind of an acquired taste.  I have followed his career for many years and this Traviata is a good representation of his artistry.  His singing becomes more intense as the opera preceeds.  His voice is not the most flexible but his sincerity is never in doubt.

There are other DVDs or films more sumptuously staged, or with better-known household name stars (although Edita Gruberova is not exactly an unknown) but you'll find few Alfredos with the passion of Neil Shicoff and few Germonts with the vocal richness of Giorgio Zancanaro. Gruberova does not make the most glamorous Violetta ever seen, but she was one of the outstanding  voices of the 70s and 80s (and she still sings today).  As for Zancanaro, there's no finer Germont on video, vocally or performance wise. I do find the colors of the set decoration to be distracting, however, to the point where I have to deduct a star. But this is definitely a production to own, and as others have mentioned, it was likely the last Traviata production mounted in the doomed La Fenice before it burned, the site of its original premiere.",1433894400,,1045,4.767955801104972

Hearing La Traviata in the Fenice with these amazing singers was indeed a thrill of my opera going experiences - it was not lost on me that this was the house of it's original premiere in 1853.  Edita Gruberova worked magic in this role, bringing her arsenal of technical bravura and sensitivity to her portrayal of Violetta.  She was in exceptional voice this day, during the peak of her career, though one could argue this point as she is still delivering the goods nearly 30 years later! The settings are traditional and sumptuous if not somewhat sparse and dark .. oddly enough, Edita's usual blonde hair was darkened to nearly black as well for this role and it's rather off-putting.  I don't feel it suits the character and certainly not Edita.  Neil Shicoff provides a fine reading of Alfredo, but perhaps in comparison to the great success of Ms. Gruberova, I find he comes up a little short vocally. The conducting of Maestro Rizzi is superb as aways; delicate and dramatic where required, easily letting his singers shine in their roles. Incidentally, if you look hard enough during the credits, I can be spotted in my box where I was enthusiastically applauding and shouting what bears repeating here - BRAVI !!  Look no further, this is the Traviata to own.",1431993600,,1407,4.680161943319838
8051375,5,B0007TFI9W,"You need not wonder why this marvelous La Traviata did not get its due.
It was the same Carlo Rizzi, only 14 years earlier.  But the leads are all different - no Villazon, no Netrebko, no Hampson.
Instead, we have here the great bel canto soprano Edita Gruberova, Neil Shicoff, one of the most underrated tenor of the late 20th century, and Giorgio Zancanaro, another grossly underrated baritone of his era.
In terms of acting, all three leads are impeccable.  They put their whole hearts into their portrayals.  Yet, to be fully convincing to viewers (and I have consulted quite a number whom I have lent this DVD for their viewing), only Zancanaro's pere Germont feeds the bill fully: he looks the part, acts the part, sings the part.
As for Gruberova, already in her mid-40s, is visually alright but not in her full visual bloom as she was in the DVDs of Manon and Die Entfhrung aus dem Serail. Her vocal acting of Violetta is however jaw dropping.  Despite the rather stolid tempi adopted by Rizzi (who was then a young man), she managed to pull out all stops for the role.  Her pianissimo in the final deathbed scene is breathtakingly effective. The timbre is still full and sweet, with lots of buoyancy and freedom through all registers. An exemplary vocal performance of the role in every sense. She would have fared very well in this performance had her Alfredo not been Neil Shicoff.
I am not suggesting that Shicoff is not a good Alfredo.  To the contrary, his Alfredo is also marvelous in many ways - his acting is utterly convincing, his singing is perfect, with the right voice type for Alfredo and he delivers the goods fully.  He looks the part, too.
What goes 'wrong' visually is the pairing of Shicoff and Gruberova.  In many places where the two engages in duets (Act I and Act III), the visual contrast between the two singers are right down to ludicrously incongruous, as if Garfield meets Mickey on stage.
I wish I am not being insensitive, but the visual effect is glaring, and in a great tragedy like La Traviata, the impact can be devastating.
Alas, no disrespect to all the great singers, who all did a more than splendid job here musically.

This is a completely traditional production and could be your only Traviata on DVD if you were limited to one.  Musically and dramatically beyond reproach;  historically meaningful (done in La Fenice, where Traviata was premiered in 1853);  and technically excellent.  1992 production, sharp picture and excellent sound, as good or better than any opera video I've seen until the modern HD era.

I will have to respectfully disagree with the reviewer who said Gruberova and Shicoff did not much look like the roles they played.  They were 100% believable in their roles to me.  This in spite of (or maybe even because of) Shicoff's dramatic reading of Alfredo as somewhat naive and dorky.  I'm quite sure that was a deliberate decision by Shicoff the actor, and although initially surprising, it definitely works.

Another reviewer mentioned his slight 'lack of vocal refinement' ... slight indeed, but it did match the context of the character.

I thoroughly enjoyed the entire production;  if I were to nitpick it would be a few spots the conductor was pushing for speed that was detrimental to ensemble.

I was also happy to note it is relatively complete, possibly even perfectly complete?  I'm not prepared to say it was perfectly complete (I do not have the score) ... but certainly had material new to me.

I would not want to give up Toscanini, Callas, Moffo, or even Domingo/Stratas ... but this is definitely one of the very best Traviatas out there.",1385424000,3,1495,4.947791164658635
