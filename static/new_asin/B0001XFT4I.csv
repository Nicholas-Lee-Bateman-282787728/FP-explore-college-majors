8017821,4,B0001XFT4I,"The reason I bought this movie was because John Wayne's youngest son Ethan was in it. That name was used in some of his movies The Searchers, etc. The movie was ok but the best part was at the end when he walked away and if he has been a little taller you would have sworn that it was John Wayne with that special walk he had.  It was worth it.

An important person assigns a special task to two hired killers: the brutal murder of a man in a way to show who is responsible. Luca Canali shows his people-handling skills with two younger men. A waiting airplane will transport the two men to Switzerland after the job. These two men were in Italy during the war. The next scene is in a bar. Two Americans arrive and are given a room. One doesn't drink, the other asks about Luca Canali. Elsewhere Luca sees his young daughter and wife. David and Frank meet a Big Boss, Don Vito, for help. We see dancers at that club. David wants to drink with that dancer. They ask her about Luca Canali. ""Why do you ask so many questions?"" We see action in the street. What is the purpose of David's actions? It attracts some men, but they are sent away.

The next morning Trini calls Luca to tell about those two Americans. His girlfriend wants to get off the street and have her own house. Luca is invited to see Don Vito. They stop at a lumberyard. There is a fight! Luca wins, then makes a telephone call. David teaches the men a lesson, so does Don Vito! Failure is not an option. The word gets out. Luca needs to disappear, says Anna. Where can he go? Can he get a gun? Maybe. Luca finds a seller. But he was followed. Luca outsmarts them and shoots first. Anna is reprimanded by Don Vito's boys. Luca telephones Don Vito about his interest in him. ""Don't keep me waiting."" Luca's wife and child are threatened, so Luca warns Lucia to leave town with Rita. A small truck runs down Lucia and Rita! Luca drives to catch that truck. A car chase for action down the narrow streets of Milano. Luca breaks the windshield of that truck to get at the driver!

The man in white runs off towards an amusement park with Luca right behind him. There is a struggle, Luca wins again. [There seems to be nobody around during the day in this city.] Don Vito needs to do better. Is Corso angry about the swiped heroin? Don Vito decides to shoot Luca on sight. ""Who are those two Americans?"" Luca visits Nicola and is surprised. ""It was an accident."" There is another surprise! ""I just don't know!"" Nicola doesn't answer. Luca visits Trini for shelter. The next day Luca visits an office building, then talks to Don Vito. He wants to know ""why"". Don Vito tells what happened, and offers Luca a deal. ""Its too late."" Don Vito says to look him in the eye. Luca calls the Americans to tell them the news. They want to meet him at an auto junkyard. The two Americans take the woman along. ""It's a trick!"" She is run down and shots are fired. David and Frank stalk Luca. Frank reloads his revolver. Shots set off a fire. Frank pushes a car down. David shoots again. Luca operates a machine to crush David. It ends.

This is a very violent movie, there is no Hollywood Production Code for censorship. This is as example of a realistic crime movie from Europe. Who says there is no sex and violence in European movies? The voices are in English, the words aren't censored. The high body count can be compared to some operas, or some events in history.",1352764800,3,3090,4.387434554973822

8017824,4,B0001XFT4I,"DVD-R mfrs. such as SYNERGY offer no commentary, deleted scenes, subtitles or other bonus features. Dubs are ""best available source"" and can vary from very good to only fair.

Produced, written and directed by Fernando Di Leo, LA MALA ORDINA is variously known as MANHUNT, BLACK KINGPIN, HIRED TO KILL, HITMEN, MANHUNT IN THE CITY, THE ITALIAN CONNECTION and MANHUNT IN MILAN. Its toothy, beefy, Swiss-born star, dark-haired Mario Adorf, is a legend in European cinema, also a vocalist and author of several best-selling books. Besides a number of prominent Continental directors, Mario has worked with Billy Wilder, John Frankenheimer and Robert Siodmak. Also noteworthy is the performance of Franco Fabrizi, as Adorf's colorful scarf-wearing ally.

In this gangster film twist on Franz Kafka's ""The Trial,"" Adorf is a small-time pimp who has no idea why the Syndicate has targeted him for death (it's a frame). Despite a thick body, the actor is limber and very convincing in hand-to-hand fighting, even against multiple opponents, and amusing when he head-butts telephones or other inanimate objects. At other times he's quite charming and like any star does, Mario simply holds one's attention no matter what's happening on-screen.

MANHUNT's action sequences are well-choreographed. The picture only drags in the naked disco dancer scenes (what awful music here!). Woody Strode (who's lookin' kinda old, alas) and Henry Silva appear in spots throughout but have the final reel all to themselves, along with our hero. Their auto graveyard showdown is most original.

Not expecting much right after a viewing of Di Leo's mediocre&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/MISTER-SCARFACE/dp/B0000CNY4E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">MISTER SCARFACE</a>&nbsp;(Italy/W Germany-1976), I came away from this earlier Euro-crime drama quite satisfied. Highly recommended!

8017825,3,B0001XFT4I,"Ethan, John Wayne's son, made several attempts in the 1980s to follow in his father's cinematic footsteps -- of which this modern-day western might be the most notable example -- but despite a pleasing appearance and affable manner, he lacked the strength, solidity, and charisma of his famous father and thus could not duplicate his father's success. Having lowered their expectations, however, many viewers will enjoy this modest but efficiently-paced account of a young cowboy falsely convicted and sent to an Arizona prison. There's a fair amount of action, especially of the car-chase variety, but little in the way of bloody violence. What's more, the movie offers, in supporting roles, the welcome presence of such veteran actors as Ernest Borgnine, Henry Silva, and Bo Swenson. While 22-year-old Wayne can't quite bring off his ""tough guy"" moments, he does look good, all shirtless and sweaty, in his ""beefcake"" scenes, and by playing the victim in a whipping scene, he's earned himself a footnote in the history of movie trivia. According to the book, ""Lash! The 100 Great Scenes of Men Being Whipped in the Movies,"" Ethan and John Wayne constitute one of the few father-son teams who've both suffered an on-screen flogging. (John Wayne felt the sting of a lash when he played Genghis Khan in ""The Conqueror."") Ethan Wayne's flogging occurs in a barn and it's notable fot the expressions on the ranch-hands' faces as they watch the whip repeatedly tear bloody gashes across Ethan's bare back. These expressions indicate not only a level of sadistic enjoyment but also a homoerotic excitement which is surprisingly blatant.",1248307200,,1631,5.135338345864661
