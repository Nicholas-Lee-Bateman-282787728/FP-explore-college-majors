1036407,5,6305477728,"this is one of the most intense films i've ever seen. it is more or less the same story as tetsuo: the iron man, but it goes much farther, and much more completely insane.it's definitely not a film for everbody, as many  japanese films seem to have a hard time hitting home with western  audiences. but if you enjoy eclectic, chaotic, and definitely too intense  film, i'm sure you'll enjoy this manic trip through one man's evolution  into mechinization.very visual in nature, and the sound is unbelievable.  very truly one of the most effective and memorable films i've seen to date.",922752000,7,585,4.752475247524752
1036488,2,6305477728,"Tetsuo II is the proto-type of a truly disappointing follow-on to a great movie. The original Tetsuo, also known as the Ironman, has such great visuals, great music, and hyperkinetic elements, it is a completely unique movie experience. Not one that necessarily makes a lot of sense from a story point-of-view, but even that adds to the experience.
But for some reason, Shinya Tsukamoto decided to tone down all the visual and music elements, and gives us a story in Tetsuo II, Body Hammer, that is more straightforward. Perhaps he thought this might be more watchable Tetsuo for the standard movie goer? Big mistake!! The disappointment really sets in with the visuals: Ironman showed completely unique, detailed, and laboriously wacky visuals. Body Hammer looks like an Asian not-ready-for-class-B movie. The color is poor, and the special effects stink. The music is not up to Ironman's, either.
The story does come together toward the end, and this is the only redeeming part of Tetsuo II. It is worth seeing only in making the original Tetsuo (Ironman) a new experience to watch again by filling in some holes in that story.",1061164800,2,1129,4.978835978835979
1036489,5,6305477728,"Although its ideology is creation, the modelling of a world, industrial society is really based on destruction. Much more impressive than the benefits of our economic system are the high number of victims it demanded to survive (WWI, WWII, the cold war, with massacres sponsored by both sides), much more impressive than the technology that makes our live simpler is the fact that it was born in the battlefield. All we created can be used as weapon, just because it was its primary function.
That's Tetsuo II. Death inside life. Doom as the most essential part of love. Security created by terror. Peace made by war.",1003968000,,617,4.830188679245283
1036490,4,6305477728,"After trying to get this video for quite a long time, I found it in a pawn shop of all places, ..., and at that price it's a good movie. I would be hesitant about paying [full price] for it, though.
The main reason for this is the pace: it's just much too slow. I haven't seen ""Tetsuo - Iron Man"" yet, but it's shorter (only 67 minutes) and I've heard that it's also faster paced that this sequel (or remake, if you wish.) While watching this movie I kept wishing for more parts like the one appearing right at the end of the film, with consists of nothing but a lot of still images flashing on your screen - japanese bondage stills, metal, weird colours and what looks like photographs taken through a microscope - all blending together to form a massive attack on your neural network.
If the movie had contained more scenes like that it would have been great. If it had been 20 minutes shorter and if it had had MORE of that cool music it would have been even greater.
Perhaps the mistake is mine - I wanted a movie that progressed at the pace of a music video, and this doesn't. Still, I can't help but think that it would be a truly great movie if it did.
Some of the good things about this movie are things like the colours - lots of cold blues and silver are used, giving the viewer a sense of something very naked; a city stripped of emotion and feeling. This is also the basic theme of the movie - a man who can not evolve unless he gets in touch with his emotions and accepts himself for what he is.
Japanese movies are usually strange to Western eyes and minds. ""Tetsuo II - Body Hammer"" is no exception.",1003795200,,1614,4.192926045016077
1036491,2,6305477728,"I will not go into detail about the film itself - other people have done that. Instead I am going to discuss the EXTREEMLY POOR job MANGA ENT. has done in bringing it to DVD. I recently bought the Japanese DVD of TETSUO 2 and it has got audio commentary by the director, a making-of-documentary and a photo gallery. None of the above are on this DVD which is a shame because TETSUO is cult cinema and a special edition treatment (especially a subtitled audio commentary track a la WINGS OF HONNEAMISE) would have been most welcome. The only good thing I can say about this disc is that MANGA at least offers the original Japanese version with subtitles as opposed to their DVD of the two DEVILMAN OVAs which you have to watch dubbed or not at all (the latter is recommended).",985046400,,775,4.426573426573427
1036492,3,6305477728,"Watching this film is kind of like putting your brain in a blender on ""puree"".  The pounding soundtrack, hyper-kinetic-Michael-Bey-on-crack camera work, and what seems like pointless and constant screaming will give many people nothing more than a headache.  I am intrigued by the many people who are delineating some of the metaphors such as the ""mechanization of humanity"".  I'm not sure of the power of its metaphor as it is far more linear and obvious than _Tetsuo I_ (and far more exploitative) - not that that is saying much.  It's by far the most successful example of ""live action"" anime that I have seen.  The heavy stop-motion fight scenes are interesting and original, with men flying through the streets, walking up the sides of buildings, projectile weapons bursting from beneath their skin.  That having been said, I believe this and the live version of ""Wicked City"" are far more capably served by true cartoon animation - the possibilities of visual pallette are greater and probably far less challenging. The atmosphere is all there from the original - disturbing images of man/machine integration in nightmarish blacks and greys, achieved with tremendous makeup effects, gory violence on a canvas of heavy industry, splashes of color for dramatic effect here and there.  And what does the almost apocalyptic ending mean?  Chances are you'll be more confused than moved, but its very interesting ""extreme"" cinema and worth your time - although you might be persuaded to check out the much more surreal (and much shorter) _Tetsuo I : Iron Man_ before this one.",978998400,,1576,5.057915057915058

1036494,5,6305477728,"What a crazy, crazy, crazy movie.  Everything you think you've heard, everything you think you know about this movie is irrelevant if you haven't seen it.  I think Shinya Tsukamoto is genuinely insane.  Tetsuo II: Body Hammer is a nightmarish ride into hell and beyond, terrifying in its simplicity and intriguing in its complexity, and you absolutely will never, ever forget it.  There's something hard to explain about this movie-- I'm kind of afraid of it, but nevertheless I feel like I have to watch it again and again and again.  Watch it and you'll see what I mean.  As for the DVD, it seems okay to me for a movie like this.  It's a Japanese cult movie, so you can't really expect a pristine transfer, but what's there seems generally okay.  I don't see the pixellation the other reviewers mention, and the movie is really dark and murky but I think that may have been what Tsukamoto wanted.  As for the comment about the trailer looking better than the film, I really don't think it does.  Parts of the trailer are in normal, full color, whereas most of the actual movie (including the exact same shots shown in full color in the trailer) was processed by its makers to make it appear in a somber shade of purplish blue.  Other than that, it seems to be pretty much the same quality as the film itself.  But I didn't see this film in theaters and I've never seen the VHS version, so I'm not much of an authority.  But at any rate, Tetsuo II: Body Hammer will change your life.  It will forever alter the way you think about movies and about yourself.  Just go see it.",971049600,3,1576,4.442508710801394
1036495,4,6305477728,"Essentially, 'Bodyhammer' is the original 'Tetsuo', but with added commercial appeal. It's filmed in colour (black, white, *and* purple), and  explains a lot of the action with a plot, one which unfortunately seems to  be borrowed from a million-and-one other Anime films. Still, as with the  original, the style is the important thing, and '2' has it in bucketloads.  Pushing the boundaries of pre-Cat III censorship to the limits, although  you never see anything particularly disturbing, the excellent grindcore  soundtrack and furious visuals make you think that you are witnessing a  hell on not-quite-earth. Ultimately, it's rather like hard-core pornography  - extreme, relentless, and numbing, so that by the end you're actually  quite bored. It's a heck of a ride, though.",966211200,,781,5.3884297520661155
1036496,5,6305477728,"TETSUO II BODY HAMMER was to me, very similar to PI. It seemed to be more an exploration of textures and shapes than an attempt at linear storytelling. If you look at the reviews for the film PI you'll notice they  contain similar complaints as the reviews for TETSUO II BODY HAMMER.  Neither film was meant to be linear. This seems to have disappointed a  great portion of the viewers. For them, the film is unfulfilling due to its  apparent lack of coherence. When in fact, the point of the movie is exactly  that, a study of disorientation created by technology and civilization. It  is a psychological effect that the writer/director is aiming for. The  viewer either will allow him that privilege or deny it to him. The viewer  is always in control. There are psychological boundaries that the viewer  will or will not allow himself to cross. This determines what mental  ""buttons"" the viewer will allow the film to push.
I enjoyed the  cleverness of some of the special effects, and of course the colors and  textures. These are the kind of films that are created for a very  specialized audience. Not everyone is going to consider them worthy of note  but that's ok. Those who do, will enjoy watching them over and over, and  delight in the psychological effect of the ride.
In case you're  interested in other films that go for THAT psychological effect check out:  PARIS FRANCE with Peter Outerbridge and Leslie Hope, A ZED AND TWO NOUGHTS,  DROWNING BY NUMBERS, & PROSPERO'S BOOKS by Peter Greenaway, POISON by  Todd Haynes, DR.

1036497,3,6305477728,"After watching this movie, I was more or less at a loss for words. I thought it was horrible, yet so intense that it left a ""want to see it again"" mark in your brain. It definitely is not for everybody, and  people who expect a Futuristic/Cyberpunk genre when looking for movies  should completely avoid this. On the other hand, fans of Japanese Anime and  just trippy movies in general should not miss a chance at grabbing a copy.  I personally liked and disliked it at the same time because I expected a  whole different movie, but was still taken in by the originality,  presentation, and just sickness of the visuals and plot.

7890157,3,6305477728,"I love the Tetsuo collection from Bullet man to the first I love all of them, but this one hmmm it just didn't match up, yea i am glad i have all the films but this is one that just didn't need to be made, they should of quite while they were ahead.",1389830400,,249,3.7169811320754715
7890158,1,6305477728,"I'd read the other peoples reviews. I thought the ones who didn't like this film just missed the point of what it was all about. I mean, I LOVE the ""cyber-punk"" films. Rubbers Lover is so so delicious, Tetsuo the iron man, was one great image after another, and even Pinnochio 964 while not quite as good as the other two, still had enough of that special ""something"" to make it a favorite. I always wondered why Body Hammer never had that special, hyphenated slogan, ""Cyber-Punk Collection"" printed across the top of it's dvd case like the others. I figured by the time Tetsuo 2 had come out there were just too many cyber-punk titles out for this to be in the same group as the ""classics"".

  There was something fishy about this film, but i couldn't put my finger on it. All the arrows pointed to ""s**t sandwich"", but i couldn't seem to resist the urge to try it for myself and ignore all the others who tried to steer me clear of this absolutly terrible movie- Those people only ""think"" they know what makes a movie good, i thought. They're just like my sister/best friend/co-worker/pet dog who i lent Iron Man to and couldn't understand the brilliance of that incredible film. I thought Tetsuo The Iron Man was like ""a symphony on celluloid"". I thought because i could think of such a fancy group of words like ""a symphony on celluloid"" to describe the first Tetsuo, that there was no way i couldn't enjoy the second one. I thought that guy who said the music sounded like it was from some old 80's videogame was just some jerk who wasn't giving credit where credit was due...

  I decided that i had made the decision to buy the first Tetuo on my own- despite a few bad reviews and I'd be damned before i'd listen to some unappreciative people who didn't know a thing about what makes a movie great, stop me from purchasing enjoying this film.

  But if your like me, you made your mind up as soon as you found out there was a second Tetsuo, and no matter what anyone else said or wrote, you were going to have to see it for yourself... Well, go ahead and buy it, you're going to have to shell out some greenbacks if you want to see something as bad as this. You know it's kind of like that unfaithful girl who you asked out and thought would be faithful, just to find out she was cheating on you; only difference is, with this film it doesnt take so long to figure out that everyone else was right.",1207008000,3,2405,4.338530066815145
7890159,5,6305477728,"dont listen to the rest of these reviews by people too ""alternative"" to like the sequel. tetsuo II: body hammer is brilliant. the soundtrack is also incredible.",1167091200,,160,4.962962962962963
7890160,5,6305477728,"I don't understand people saying Tetsuo II is a letdown after the original. The original is great, a masterwork to be sure, but I think the sequel is nearly on par with it. Clearly, Tsukamoto started working in a different direction with the sequel. It's not even really a sequel in the traditional sense so much as it vaguely echoes certain themes of the original (edification and deliverance through body modification, liberation through pain - all the stuff Tsukamoto loves).

I think people may feel it doesn't match up to the original because it has such a strong emphasis on flashy editing techniques, as opposed to the flesh/steel zoomorphic collision, something Tsukamoto sometimes gets a little carried away with (""Bullet Ballet"" being the extreme example of this) however, there isn't anyone who manipulates film in the same way. This guy is a true genius of the cinema. A total original. No one works in the same general ballpark as him.

The basic plot is fairly thin and vague (another recurring Tsukamoto issue), it involves a mother and father whose son is kidnapped by a bunch of grotesque bodybuilding skinheads. The plot is incidental. With Tsukamoto you simply put the movie in and hold on, letting it wash over you. Not everything makes sense logically, but emotionally it rings true.

Anyway, I loved this as I love all of this guy's films. He is one of the greats and (selfish as I am) I hope he is never DISCOVERED by all the little fanboys, as Takashi Miike was. When directors get discovered their work seems to spin off and become diluted (not that Miike has become totally diluted, but you know what I mean)",1148601600,,1634,4.76678445229682
7890161,3,6305477728,"Ok, you've heard right, this sequel is not as totally insane as what you will find in the original film. However that doesn't mean that Body Hammer is a total waste of time. It's actually fun, energetic, wacky, subversive like the first but now we have more of a storyline to go along with the visual bravada. I was laughing out loud at some of the action scenes as they were filmed with a truly demented sense of humor.

Perhaps the director recycles too much of the original Tetsuo but this sequel might seem more palatable to a person who is not likely to respond to the avant-garde style of filmmaking exhibited in the first movie. Not to worry though as Body Hammer is in many ways just as crazy and bizzare.

The director, Tsukamoto, here uses color as opposed to black and white in the original and even though this adds it's own twisted element to the work, the color is too faded and the film looks quite grainy to be truly effective.

Body Hammer reminds you even more of a pumped-up anime than the first film which looked more like an underground film project. Regardless, if you're a Tetsuo fan, you simply have to see Tetsuo 2: Body Hammer, the metal mania just wouldn't be complete without it!",1145750400,,1207,4.4772727272727275
7890162,3,6305477728,"Tetsuo II: Bodyhammer (Shinya Tsukamoto, 1992)

After the weirdness that is Tetsuo: The Iron Man, Tsukamoto returned four years later with its followup, Bodyhammer. But looking at it as a sequel makes no sense, and it's not really a remake. What it really is is left up to you to decide, because I have no idea.

Manga Entertainment's website says Tetuso II is Tsukamoto's answer to Bladerunner and Aliens, but it looks more to me like Tsukamoto's answer to Videodrome (this won't surprise anyone who's seen the original film, or Akira, the end of which these films are a loose continuance). While the original film had no plot whatsoever, this one does. Taniguchi (Tomorowo Taguchi, reprising his role as the Iron Man) and his girlfriend/wife/whatever Kana (Nobu Kanaoka, the woman who ""turned"" the Iron Man in the original's unforgettable chase scene) have a son, Minori (Keinosuke Tomioka). Minori is, for no reason we can discern at the beginning, kidnapped by a gang of skinheads. He's not really the kind to go in, blow stuff up, and get his kid back; he's really your basic 98-pound weakling. That is, until he discovers new meanings of the term ""body modification.""

While Bodyhammer is a live action flick, it does seem to have more in common with Akira than did its predecessor, especially during Taniguchi's change scenes; it's as if Tsukamoto spent the four years between films studying Akira so he could frame the shots better. There's also an extremely odd soundtrack, much of which sounds lifted from Tsukamoto's short ""Drumstruck"" and overlaid with a videogame theme song. (Why this was never turned into  videogame is beyond me; you'd think Konami would jump at the idea.) Tsukamoto's direction, editing, and cinematography here is more professional than it is in The Iron Man, but it's still got that feel of being shot with a Super 8 by a couple of high school students. (I rush to say this is not a bad thing.)

There really is no basis of comparison between the two Tetsuo films. Each is equally warped, in its own way, and both are compelling viewing for the discerning gorehound. See both, if you can. *** ",1100131200,2,2129,4.835164835164835

7890165,5,6305477728,"Comparisons will obviously be made to David Lynch and Cronenberg, but if you like those directors and have a taste for low budget foreign horror movies then you will love Tetsuo II - Body Hammer.
Basically this is like a live action Magna cartoon and can be watched as a stand alone without seeing the original Tetsuo. Where the film scores in aces is with the editing and camerawork. Shinya Tsukamoto is held in great esteem by directors like Quetin Tarantino, who once asked if Tsukamoto would work on an American film with him. Tsukamoto responded by saying Yes - If he was allowed to nuke Hollywood.
The plot is crazy and revolves around a Tokyo businessman, Taniguchi, whose son is kidnapped by a cult of demented nazi-type body builders led by a villain who has the special power of being able to turn his body parts into mechanical firearms. Taniguchi discovers that he too has similar special powers and proceeds to try and wipeout the gang in a Superhero sort of way.
There is lots of arty nightmare sequences and action, although the film does loose its pace in parts. At its heart, Tetsuo II is a movie about a superhero with a grotesque gift. It is violent at times but the plot is actually coherent and the story is a lot of fun.
Considering the budget limitations the filmmakers have done well and Tetsuo has quite a cult following and it is easy to see why directors like Tarantino recommend it. So if you have a taste for low budget weirdness, then this movie is a must.",1066867200,5,1486,4.5278810408921935
