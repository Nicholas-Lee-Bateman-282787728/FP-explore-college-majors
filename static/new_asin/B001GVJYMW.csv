8307253,5,B001GVJYMW,"I enjoyed this episode of BATTLEFIELD DETECTIVES as much as I have enjoyed the others in this series. I am disappointed that I cannot purchase more of the back episodes, however. For example I would really like to order the Battle of COWPENS episode from our war of Independence as well as a few of the others that I missed when the series was being regularly presented on the History Channel. I believe that this series is timeless and I wish that the whole production of around 30 episodes would be more accessible for I think that this series is one of the best things to ever come out of the History Channel.",1469145600,,612,4.424778761061947
8307254,4,B001GVJYMW,"Produced in 2005, this dvd-R (NOT pro pressed DVD) provides an interesting, mostly Roman overview of the technology/strategy of the Siege of Alesia (52 BC).  The program provides talking heads (Peter Connolly -Inst. Archaeology/U College London, Jonathan Roth-San Jose State U., Mark Corby- Durham U, Neil Faulkner- Inst. Archaeology/U College London, Tom Holland-""Rubicon"" author), diagrams, maps, graphics, on-location shots, a few archaeological finds (gaul helmet, Roman tribulus, scorpion bolt-head, etc.), scant CGI, & grainy/dark/close/shaky re-enactor segments (could be more accurate- but not disgusting).  Covers terrain, immediate context (i.e. Gaul's sack or Rome in 390 BC, prior Battle of Gergovia, Roman ""barbarian"" concept), some Gaul technology, battlefield engineering, Roman vs. Gallic strategies,  Roman weapons,  but not Caesar's political/monetary motives.
Terminology could be more accurate (Celts & Gauls used without justification).  Mentions, but does not translate Ceasar's account- and the evidence they display validates Ceasar's description.  Thankfully, the Gauls are not subjected to the unfortunate primitivism that pervades most depictions- their weapon technology is celebrated (metalwork, helmet design, rampart design, arrowheads...).  But they still come off a little mysterious, and destined to lose.
Interesting are Renee Goget's aerial photographs revealing traces of the double Roman fortifications, Connolley's battlefield model, Roman combat engineering  (battlements), reconstructions of a Roman ""scorpio"" torsion war machine (by Ivan Williams), descriptions of the Roman auxiliary German cavalry.
This program will not work as a stand-alone source, but is an interesting supplement that might inspire subsequent viewings.",1336176000,3,1767,6.394957983193278
