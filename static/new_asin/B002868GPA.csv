8355824,3,B002868GPA,"Other people have written about what episodes of Bonanza appear in which collections (beware of repetition if you buy more than one). I'm just going to make some comments re the quality of this particular set. They didn't waste a penny on the production of these. The box contains absolutely nothing except the dvds, although the episodes are helpfully listed on the back. They're certainly  not listed on the inside. In fact the discs don't even have labels, and with double sided discs, it's pretty near impossible to tell what side you're putting in. There are no extras. And the picture quality is very low - this is the opposite of high def. I have no other Bonanza collections with which to compare it, but these are low res - better than youtube, but not as good as your average television picture. And then at the end of each episode you get a lovely little commercial for the dvd authoring company, complete with techno music that is guaranteed to drive the target audience for these dvds crazy. I'm surprised that they were proud enough of their efforts to put advertising on these. Even the little screen shots in the chapter selection menus are messed up (horizontally stretched). On the up side, these seem to play fine, and they have the original music, and they're SUPER cheap. So pretend you're watching an old tv set and enjoy. Just don't expect fancy packaging or high definition.",1243987200,,1398,4.729508196721311
