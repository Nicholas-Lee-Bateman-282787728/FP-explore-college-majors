Over emphasis on  roads.  I would have liked more connection with  naming (audio commentary) the animals and the animals themselves. Sometimes the animal was named after it was shown. There could be interesting facts about animals and their habits; much like a tour guide tells when driving through a wild game park like  this one. I would suggest an overview and map be given.  This video looks to be part of a family of similar ones so other buyers beware if they are purchasing something produced by Travel Video Store.  A better price for the general viewer might be $5.00",1271548800,2,824,4.753521126760563
