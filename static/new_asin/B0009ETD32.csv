2284550,1,B0009ETD32,"I give this movie 1 star for the fact that im a fan of Corey Feldman. His names on the cover of this garbage, yet hes in the actual movie for less then 2 minutes. This junk is 90 minutes of fake alien news casts strung together to tell the story. Very Lame. Do not buy. You will be dissapointed. Youve been warned!!!",1120003200,4,316,4.031746031746032
2284551,5,B0009ETD32,"I saw this movie and loved it ,it was incredable. Corey Feldman and James Vallo are awesome. It was totally original and fun for my whole family. Unique and different take on space alien abductions,sightings and ufos. Very funny stuff indeed. I highly reccomend this film it is worth watching if you like inide films you will ove this one.",1114387200,5,339,4.666666666666667
8059745,5,B0009ETD32,This is a very funny movie!  James Vallo gives a great performance as the hapless investigator - I love the expressions on his face as he is mistreated throughout the film.  The characters in the bar are so funny.  Would like to have seen more of Corey Feldman. The ending was unexpected and a great surprise.  Invasion of the Space Preachers was a big disappointment.,1495497600,,368,4.615384615384615

8059747,4,B0009ETD32,Space Daze two stars ...crude and too stupid to funny.,1480464000,,54,4.5
8059748,4,B0009ETD32,".... in descending order: EXTREMELY low budget, KINDA clever, sorta funny. I'd recommend it to some friends and watch it again.",1474416000,,127,5.095238095238095

Not funny Corey Felton appears only in a tiny cameo role.",1472774400,,66,4.583333333333333
8059751,1,B0009ETD32,"This is the second movie tonight that was shot on a 20 dollar budget and they got gypped.  Corey Feldman had nothing to do with this thing really. And will deny ever being in it for the minute he was. Good plot idea, if only they had a writer, director, camera, sets, special effects, actors, taste, and money, it would be a great film. But nope.",1472428800,,346,4.242424242424242
8059752,1,B0009ETD32,"Like most Troma films,this low budget yarn tried to be funny but was very bad and sorely lacking in any effects.",1468540800,,112,4.380952380952381
8059753,1,B0009ETD32,"Had to turn this off immediately due to language inappropriate content for a 10-13 year old crowd.  Can't say anything about the movie, but if your kids love Corey Feldmen, this isn't a kids movie.",1341878400,,197,4.628571428571429
8059754,5,B0009ETD32,"I bought this for Daniel Boyd's ""Strangest Dreams:  Invasion of the Space Preachers"" which is the ultimate in low-budget, sci-fi films.  In some ways it's nothing but cheese, but it's good cheese!  ""Space Daze"" wasn't so hot... it was like the makers of that movie were trying to hard to surpass the B-movie rating, but on a miniscule budget.  ""Strangest Dreams"", however, accepted the B-movie status and made the most of it.",1178496000,6,425,4.861111111111111
