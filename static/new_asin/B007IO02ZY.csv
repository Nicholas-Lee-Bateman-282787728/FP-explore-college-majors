5089505,3,B007IO02ZY,Depends on the movies purpose...The family was ignorant to the challenges of having a child with issues in their home...The acting was average...I suppose it gave light as far as what it all entails when you agree to care for a child but in no way demonstrated any positive or acceptable manner as how to...,1396656000,3,307,4.6

5089508,4,B007IO02ZY,"It is hard to believe that the group of young people could develop this wonderful production. It is very professional although some of the acting could have been better. I know a couple of the people involved. I was surprised when one of the actors appeared as I did not know he was in the movie. However, it does not surprise me at all that he was chosen to perform a part in the movie.
This is a very hard story, not for pre-teens unless they have been prepared for it. Because it involves a young boy (10 year old) who had a very difficult life prior to being considered for adoption by his new family there are behavior issues on both behalf of the child and the prospective parents. We see all of the family members grow in spite of various difficulties.
Having been a foster parent to some of troubled children, I very much see the situations involved in the story as being real.
Parents should discuss this story with their children during and after the showing. There are things everyone could have done better -- but the reality is very few people are able to when they are faced with the problems involved.",1345852800,5,1116,4.422330097087379
5089509,5,B007IO02ZY,"This movie has moved so many hearts!! I bought a few copies of it to share with my friends because of the powerful message! This film is definitely a must see for any families who have adopted children, or are considering it! Enjoy!!",1337731200,,233,4.441860465116279
5089510,5,B007IO02ZY,"Beyond Acceptance was done very professionally.  It's an exciting, touching and moving story that may change the lives of viewers.
Not only did it receive very high ratings from the Dove Foundation[...]
it is being show at the Life Fest in LA this weekend [...] as well as churches across the country!  I believe it can be compared with Facing the Giants.

5089511,3,B007IO02ZY,"I was interested in this movie because of my history of working with foster children. It is a very good story. Very real and true to form. But the acting in this movie is not good at all. It seems very fake and forced. The little boy, the foster child is the best of the actors. I would have enjoyed it more of they had hired more experienced actors.",1335744000,4,350,4.086956521739131
8517663,3,B007IO02ZY,Meaningful story...the worst acting I've seen.,1508889600,,46,6.833333333333333
8517664,3,B007IO02ZY,"The movie has a great story that fits many foster children. Unfortunately, like many Christian based films, the acting is terrible with the one exception of the little boy. The moral of the story is, if you wish to be a foster parent, don't do it for the money, do it for love. Don't expect ""normal"" children to come to your foster home because most have seen more and experienced more hurt than normal adults. Love, patience, counseling, prayer are what's needed in foster care.",1508544000,,479,4.647058823529412

8517667,2,B007IO02ZY,"I have to say this.  Who would give this a 5 star rating??????  REALLY??  I get that there is a Christian message  given through this movie.  However, that doesn't make it a 5 star rating?  The acting was horriblen (all of the actors).  The script was horrible.  Obviously a low budget quality film.  Made for TV, if that.

I am a Christian but this was a very poor put together movie.  It wasn't enjoyable to watch,  Maybe appropriate for a Bible study class or catechism.",1503964800,,473,4.435294117647059

8517670,5,B007IO02ZY,"NOT $$ budgeted movie-but there are very good acting jobs by youngest star..and the story line is one that really tries to reflect the VALOR that goes with the MIGHTY undertaking that adopting a child with many past scars involves when blending into your home. You WANT so hard to believe with a cheerful heart and power of faith it will all be very easy - but this movie points out that reality is much different and the world has many trials all to itself that a ""genetic family"" would not be able to relate to. (no offense please-dont know the PC word) I think it's a fabulous undertaking for the faith CLEAN movie industry to be taking on such serious issues in today's society and NOT LEAVING them in the DARK CLOSET..its movies like this that BRING issues to the forefront and thus conversation and thus CHANGE. I AM GLAD to see more of them flooding the waves of i-net. PLEASE watch with sensitivity - some scenes of reflection of child shouting-abuse-ideas of past guns/suicide dealing with trauma...thus the reason for parental advisement but all is handled with EXTREME caution and sensitivity - just telling what happened to boys livelihood in story.",1499126400,,1161,4.724137931034483
8517671,5,B007IO02ZY,"First, I want to say that this movie won't win any awards for acting.  But I will say that Trent Garnaat, who played Evans did a pretty good job.  This is a Christian Independent movie.  This film tells the story of Evans, a 10 year old foster child that was abandoned by his birth mother as a baby.  And as a result Evans has many emotional issues due to being pass around from foster home to foster home.  But then the Border family comes along and is looking to adopt.  The Border family goes through the process of deciding to adopt and that brings the family close together. However, the difficulty of bringing someone new into the family sets in and life gets harder. I can identify with this movie because I was abandoned as a child, in an orphanage at age 3 and then an abusive foster family.  Though I  tried to be good to be loved, but that did not work out well for me.  What I would have done to have a loving family stand by me like this one did.  The right thing to do isn't always easy.  I also love the song What love really means by J J Heller during the credits.  It was perfect for this movie.  I would recommend it.",1475366400,4,1135,4.151376146788991
8517672,3,B007IO02ZY,"A slow moving film which became tiring to watch.
The boy is an especially good actor.
The cinematography is mediocre.
A heartwarming ending, but the film is not worth watching.",1425859200,2,176,4.9
