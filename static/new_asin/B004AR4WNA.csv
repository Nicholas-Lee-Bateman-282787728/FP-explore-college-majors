8420752,4,B004AR4WNA,"The ""American Experience"" DVD ""Lee & Grant: Generals Of The Civil War"" is actually two previous ""American Experience"" DVDs put together into one package. If you already have both ""American Experience: Robert E. Lee"" and ""American Experience: Ulysses S. Grant Warrior President"" then you do not need to get this double disc set.

As for the DVDs themselves they are both pretty good. The one dealing with U. S. Grant is the better of the two I feel going into more depth about the man, the general and the President. It is actually two parts to it. The first part looks at Grant's early years as a young man to getting into West Point and establishing a career in the military to his role in the Civil War. The second part looks at Grant's two terms as President of The United States and later years. This second part is the most interesting I think. Many people because of the Civil War are well aware of Grant's accomplishments as a military leader. When it comes to Grant's eight years in the Presidency it seems that about the only thing many people are aware of is all the political scandals and controversies that took place while he was in office. But what many people forget or fail to realize is that Grant himself was never involved with any of those scandals. Grant instead was too trusting of the people he knew and they took advantage of that managing to get themselves appointed into government offices then use their positions for financial gain. Grant meanwhile used well his time in office to accomplish things that would help lead the country through the second half of the 19th century.

As for the documentary on Robert E. Lee while good I found to be a bit lacking. there are important events that too place in Lee's life that is given little or even no coverage at all. Best example of that is in telling about Lee's military career there is no mention how he was the leader of the U.S troops that brought an end to the raid John Brown and his followers took on Harper's Ferry in 1859 as they tried to create a slave uprising in the south. For those who know little or next to nothing about Bobby Lee this will be a good documentary to help the viewer come to understand Lee better. But for those like me who are history buffs there isn't anything new to learn here. The DVD is only an hour and a half. Why so short a documentary for such a complex man doesn't make sense. It would have been nice if the director expanded the length to two hours so as to dig deeper into a better understand about one of the greatest military minds ever produced by the United States.

Together these two programs make a good set but if you already have the two individual DVDs there is no need to get this. If on the other hand you don't have either of these documentaries then you could save yourself a little cash by getting both DVDs at once in this set.",1417392000,3,2862,4.406427221172023

8420754,4,B004AR4WNA,"While you DO get the full Robert E Lee here, this American Experience of Grant is just a truncated version of the full one they did years ago.  The best thing to do would to be to buy Robert E Lee & the entire nearly 4-hour Grant separately

Grant was simply one of the all time great General Officers.  Robert E. Lee was tied to napoleonic warfare.  Namely heavy artillary and the maneuvering of his army.  The South taking Lee as a genuine military genius kind of wears it out.  No blow by blow accounts here.  Suffice to say Robert E. Lee had a reputation.  Namely Number one graduate all time to then from west point.  Comandant of West Point, also a brilliant officer in the Mexican War which was commited under the name of ""manifest destiny"" under James Polk.  A simple war of aggression in which we took about half of Mexico.  Pressed by the south  to have more land because slaves are uneducated and farming keeps slavery alive.  In any case the south seemed to know more about Grant than the U.S. did.  Grant was the first General to cooprdinate his armies to an end.  Lee did not.  When Grant took command of all U.S. armies the end was ordained.  Grant and Sherman got the confederacy in a pincer action when Sherman cut the south in half with command of the south's supply line, the Missippi river with Grant's taking of Vicksburg.  In the end at appomattox junction General Lee standing 6'4"" in full dress uniform came to surrender, he thought he may face a firing squad is to be considered valor.  When Grant got the message he was over an hour away in the field and arrived in a mud splattered uniform that looked like a regular soldier except for the stars on his shoulders, standing about 5'9"".  So different were these two soldiers.  After banter about the mexican war Lee asked for terms of ending the war.  Grant said lay down your arms and go home.  Every man who owns a horse can take it home.  Every officer can have side arms.  That was it.  When Lee left, they say Grant went out and saluted him.  Grant's war methods became text book for the U.S. Army.
