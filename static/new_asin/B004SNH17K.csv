4464050,3,B004SNH17K,This movie was alright. It was not as good as I thought it was going to be. I probably will watch my DVD again from time to time but it will not be my first choice if I need to pick from a bunch.,1375747200,,195,3.4545454545454546

4464052,1,B004SNH17K,"This movie was NOT an historical account. It was a vehicle for preaching Christianity.  God was on the patriots side, not the loyalists.  Now you don't need to see the movie.",1368403200,2,174,4.580645161290323
4464053,1,B004SNH17K,"My daughter became fascinated with Sybil Ludington's story after reading the book, so I decided to get her the movie. When a 7 year old prefers to turn off the movie and practice her multiplication tables instead of watching another second, you know you aren't just being a movie snob. This should not be sold in Amazon.",1351209600,2,320,4.631578947368421
4464054,1,B004SNH17K,"I bought this at my local Lifeway store very excitedly because I knew the story of Sybil Ludington from some of my historical readings and the movie was on sale for about eight dollars.  Well after watching it, I understand now why it was on sale.  Mind you, the actual story of Sybil Ludington could be excellently and dramatically portrayed in a movie.  Unfortunately, the people producing this movie, come across as a Church youth group with little talent having come together to make a film.  It is a noble idea to try and make a movie about Sybil and one is certainly overdue.  But they really should have produced something better, as her heroism merits it.  The absolutely main flaw of the movie is the sheer horrible acting.  The kids come across as having never had true feelings in their life and they deliver their lines too fast to be understood.  The writing is decidedly modern which makes the actors look like poorly dressed clowns.  As their lines call for blue jeans and T-shirts but they are wearing period costumes.  It looks as though every scene were filmed in the same house.  And the girl portraying Sybil isn't convincing when she fires her musket and is so slumped shouldered all throughout the film that she doesn't inspire the viewer as a Revolutionary War hero.  As a Christian and a fan of the many accomplishments of women in American history, I would love to say this is a good movie.  But I simply cannot.  The quality is terrible and it is quite shocking that the producers found anybody willing to package and sell such an inferior product.",1330473600,11,1574,4.635379061371841
4464055,3,B004SNH17K,"This is painful to watch.  The acting is awful.  However, it still was something that was educational.  Just get past the bd acting. We really enjoy topics on the American Revolution.",1329782400,3,183,4.838709677419355
4464056,1,B004SNH17K,"As a history person, I knew of Sybil Ludington and her not so well known ride.  It is a tale worth the telling, unfortunately, this film is not the vehicle to convey her story.

As a part time actor, I can attest to the fact that good acting and interesting characters can sometimes redeem a bad script, but bad acting dooms the best script.

This film has both: bad acting and a bad script.

The acting is amateurish, the blocking and movement are stiff and projected, and the script/dialogue is stilted and not believable.  To add further insult to the production, the actors do not appear 18th century realistic.  They appear to be clean, modern 21st century people who just happen to be wearing 18th century wardrobe, with some scenes portraying a culturally, unrealistic example of life in 18th century America.

I had some doubts as soon as the film began when I saw that it was produced by a religious organization, and I wondered if that would override basic storytelling and film making factors and dull the historical episode of the actual event.

I believe that the producers wanted to tell a moral and uplifting story about a young woman who accomplished quite an amazing feat.  Unfortunately, the atrocious acting dooms that goal.",1325203200,6,1243,4.771028037383178
4464057,5,B004SNH17K,"This film is inspired by the true story of sixteen year-old Sybil Ludington, who courageously rode over 40 miles through a stormy night to save New York during the Revolutionary War. Sybil is historically known as the female Paul Revere and is a wonderful example of courage and faith.

Through this film we find the story of her family, neighbors, and friends, as they face the dynamics of the Revolution and lived their lives with courage, faith, and determination. This inspiring story touches the lives of those who embrace it, as Sybil embraces her brothers and sisters and confronts the challenges before her. She stands courageously and boldly with determination, with her father, Col. Henry Ludington, as he faces a price on his head by the British.

A movie that will inspire your family and the youth of today to go after everything before them with determination and courage.",1303603200,11,886,4.939597315436242

8439995,2,B004SNH17K,"The movie makes two mistakes in the first 10 minutes. 1. Although the Tea Party was protesting taxation, the colonies had the lowest tax rate of all of the British Empire, including those in England. Representation was desired by enlightenment thinkers in the colonies to be an additional excuse, though I think a good one, to  work for representation. War was not necessary to have achieved this aim. 2. It was said that God means for all men to be free. This is not Biblically true. Romans 13.1
Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God.

Daniel 4:17
""This sentence is by the decree of the angelic watchers And the decision is a command of the holy ones, In order that the living may know That the Most High is ruler over the realm of mankind, And bestows it on whom He wishes And sets over it the lowliest of men.""

Jesus answered, ""You would have no authority over Me unless it were given to you from above. Therefore the one who handed Me over to you is guilty of greater sin.""

8439996,4,B004SNH17K,Excellent film telling the story of Sybil Ludington and her night ride to give warning about the approach of British forces.,1470614400,,124,4.9523809523809526
8439997,5,B004SNH17K,"Nicely done :) We love good historical stories of which the true story of Sybil Ludington will not disappoint!
We appreciated the sincerity of each actor in this DVD. The outtakes were enjoyable too :)
Some reviews have thought this to be slow or a lesser quality however we enjoyed this DVD. Everything these days doesn't have to be an epic production to be appreciated and enjoyed! Simplify...relax and that's just what we did! We made a bucket of popcorn, sat back and enjoyed every minute of this AMAZING story :)",1440288000,,517,4.6923076923076925
8439998,2,B004SNH17K,"This DVD was purchased to use with my grandchildren.  My husband is a retired teacher and I am a retired Library Media Specialist.  We previewed the program before showing to our grandchildren ages 12 and twins age 10.  It did not hold our interest.  It seems to be performed by a group of poorly directed amateurs.  The speech was terrible as well as the acting.  We began viewing with the 12 year hold, who is very interested in history.  He only lasted fifteen minutes.",1439424000,2,472,4.5476190476190474
8439999,5,B004SNH17K,"My family really enjoyed ""Sybil Ludington"". Her story is really something everyone should know about it. The movie was kid friendly and our children enjoyed it and learned a lot. Seeing Sybil's faith in the Lord as she helped her father was inspirational. The sets and costumes were very historically accurate. We recommend this movie to families looking for a great inspirational period film for the entire family!",1436659200,4,415,5.117647058823529
8440000,1,B004SNH17K,"Though I'm glad her story is being told, Sybil deserves better. This is an amateurish production at best. Many of the scenes went on too long (Sybil's birthday celebration for one). There was no explanation as to how Mr. Ludington came to be married to a Hispanic woman (miscasting?) and her lines were always labored and delayed. Most of the acting was stilted and there were times it appeared the actors forgot their lines. The comic relief of the brothers interaction during a rescue wasn't either of those things though their byplay in other scenes did provide some relief in this painful production.

I'm hopeful that someone will remake this movie, so that we can be inspired by her bravery.",1423180800,6,697,4.808333333333334
8440001,1,B004SNH17K,It's unfortunate that this remarkable story doesn't have a better movie to portray it.  The movie is unwatchable.  I'm pretty sure a group of high-schoolers just filmed themselves.,1423008000,,180,5.392857142857143
8440002,4,B004SNH17K,"While the true story of Sybil Ludington is truly inspiring, this movie made it seem a bit less exciting than it must have actually been.  The costumes were well done and the characters were believable. There were long stretches, however, when we just had music playing while people danced or children played.  I almost wonder if they were trying to stretch a short script to make the movie longer.  I think more of the danger could have been portrayed while still keeping the film family-friendly for young children.",1383004800,,516,4.840909090909091
