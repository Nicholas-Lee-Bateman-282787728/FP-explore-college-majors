1398314,5,B000056MOZ,"We love the teletubbies and this one is the best.  This exercise video gets my 1.5 & 3.5 yr olds up and moving and they love it.  The perfect difficulty, pace, and gross motor skill level for toddlers.  This is a must have for any mother of preschoolers.",1061683200,4,254,4.25
1398315,5,B000056MOZ,I credit this video with teaching my two-year-old how to jump.  Those darned Teletubbies did what my husband and I hadn't been able to manage in months.  My son loves watching it and asks for it repeatedly.  It's also one of the few Teletubbies videos that don't make my brain hurt.,1026864000,5,282,4.490196078431373
1398316,4,B000056MOZ,"I purchased this video with the hope that my boys (just over 1 and over 2) would do more than sit like potatoes in front of the tube. They do seem to enjoy the video very much and it does offer many opportunities for little ones to get up and move! The little video snippets that are the shows hallmark are good-particuarly the ""Head, shoulders, knees, and toes"" one. I own 4 tubby videos and this is our favorite.",1024963200,6,414,4.253164556962025
1398317,5,B000056MOZ,"My 1 year old grandson loves the Teletubbies, the moment he seen them do exercising he tried to do the same. It was so cute watching him trying to move his legs and jump around like them. To me it is worth buying the DVD, and if it helps the babies learn to exercise, then thats really great.",1024185600,3,292,4.051724137931035
1398318,5,B000056MOZ,"My son, 21 months, loves this video and I love to watch my son while he is watching it.  The teletubbies do various 'exercises' throughout the video- things such as: jump, side-to-side, crawl, skip, head-shoulder-knees and toes, and others.  When each segment begins my son will begin jumping around, or crawling or doing the other actions.  He has learned the song and actions to 'Head-shoulders-knees and toes'.  My son also learned to say ""Ready-set-go"" from this video.  It is really cute to say 'Ready' to him and he finishes with 'set-go'.
I know as an adult the Teletubbies can be very annoying.  But I try and remind myself that the Teletubbies were created for very small children not adults.  I'm supposed to be annoyed by them- if I wasn't something would be wrong with my mental capacity.
Overall, I would give any Teletubby video 5 stars if it was successful in keeping my son occupied for 15 minutes while I take a shower.  So far any Teletubby show my son has watched- whether it was video or on PBS has succeeded.",1006128000,9,1029,4.6464088397790055
1398319,5,B000056MOZ,"This is a great video! It is perfect for getting the kids up and moving around. It has bright colors, simple steps and appropriate sequencing. Cute and cheerful, it shows that exercising can be playful and fun, and can be done anywhere. Kids exuberantly copied the movements, clapping and laughing. They watched it over and over.  ""It was fun fun."" ""We like to run and jump."" ""We did the exercises with them."" ""We learned to stand on one foot."" ""Ready-steady-go!"" Best for ages 0 to 2.",1000425600,5,485,4.6395348837209305
1398320,5,B000056MOZ,"Go Exercise with the Teletubbies is an absolute hit with my 14 month old. She saw it for the first time at 12 months and insists on seeing her ""Ya Ya"" tape ( La La is the yellow Teletubbie) everyday when she arrives home from daycare. As young as she is, she stays interested in the tape for 30 -45 minutes which allows me to start dinner and relax after work. She dances as she watches and has learned to touch her head, shoulders, knees, and toes like the real kids in the video. While I personally find tapes such as Barney and Sesame Street more entertaining and a lot less repetitive, by far both her Teletubbies tapes are her favorites. She especially likes the facial expressions of the baby sunshine and shrieks with delight when the sun is on the screen. Her grandmother believes that when my daughter walks around swinging her arms, she is imitating the Teletubbies. My daughter is very advanced in language and motorskills and I truly attribute a large part of her early success to her love and interest in the Teletubbies. I strongly encourage parents to introduce this video to their infants as well as Teletubbies books. I am amazed at how excited my daughter gets everytime she watches the video.",990057600,11,1211,4.585253456221198
1398321,4,B000056MOZ,"Finally a video that gets my son to drop his juice and get up and MOVE!  From the minute this video begins he is jumping and dancing with the teletubbies.  Each teletubby does there own movements (up & down, side to side etc.) and my son follows along.  The music can be a bit annoying at times (especially since we HAVE to watch this video over and over and over).  But all in all you end up liking these little creatures.",986515200,3,423,4.185185185185185

7932199,5,B000056MOZ,This is something my granddaughter wanted for Christmas but most places I found it wanted way too much money for it.  Then this one came up on Amazon as a new one at a very reasonable price.  my granddaughter was beyond excited when she opened it on Christmas morning.  Thank you.,1263081600,,280,4.450980392156863

7932202,5,B000056MOZ,"Our 23 month old granddaughter loves this video., she watches it over and over and over again, day in and day out,, and we love it too.

The one 'live video' of ""Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes' with the kids, and the policeman, and the fireman, and the soccer team players and back to the kids again is great fun..

the 60 minutes video is well planned out in story's and dance and exercise movements.

Great tape to add to one's child's library.",1115164800,,447,4.36144578313253
7932203,4,B000056MOZ,"My 2-yr-old daughter, a huge Teletubbies fan, loves this one and loves doing the moves along with the Tubbies. HOWEVER, if you're considering buying this, you should know that it is a ""special feature"" on ""Silly Songs and Funny Dances."" If you already own the ""Silly Songs"" DVD, you already own ""Go!""",1079913600,11,300,4.788461538461538
