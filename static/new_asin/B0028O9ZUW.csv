8356508,5,B0028O9ZUW,"One of my favorite movies of all time. Socialism vs. Anarchy vs. Capitalism vs. common decency, and navigating through all of it while trying to maintain the courage of one's convictions, is all brilliantly displayed in this film in an honest way. The arguments presented in dialogue are easily relevant to all of us. All the actors sunk into their roles to where it's unnoticeable that they are acting. Shot beautifully and directed wonderfully.",1484006400,,446,5.04054054054054
