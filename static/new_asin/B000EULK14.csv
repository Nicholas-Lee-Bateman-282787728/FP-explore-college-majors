2536254,5,B000EULK14,"Basilio and Bernandino Vargas are two Bolivian kids who, because of the death of their father, have to work as child laborers in the Cerro Rico silver mines. Basilio works long shifts for $2.50 a day. But then transfers to a more dangerous mine where he is able to make $4.00 a day. Somehow he manages to also attend to school, though he has to spend a substantial amount of his salary just to pay for his school uniform.

One of the great things about this doc is that the film makers have a sincere humanitarian purpose. They not only want to educate viewers about the horrors of child labor. But actually do something tangiable to better the lives of these kids.

Included in the bonus features is a short film which shows how Basilio and Bernardino are doing one year after filming. Apparently an aide agency called Kindernothilfe has enabled the boys to leave the mines, move their family into a apartment in Potosi and continue their educations so they will have better opportunities in life.

I wish these great youngsters, and others like them, all the best. They deserve it!",1215907200,11,1083,4.630208333333333
2536255,5,B000EULK14,"This movie is eye-opening. It shows how life in poor countries is very different in so many ways from that in the affluent USA.

What's it like to work in silver mines when you are still a child? This Spanish-language movie, with English subtitles, tells it all. The father had died years ago, and the mother must take care of younger children. So, as is true in other situations where the oldest child must grow up fast and assume many of the responsibilities of the missing parent, the 14 year-old boy must work to support the family. So does his 12 year-old brother. When the 14 year-old moves on to the larger, more profitable mine (in the ""mountain that eats people""), the only consolation is the fact that the foreman pledges to the mother that he will watch out for the boy. Mining is arduous and dangerous. The miners of all ages must chew on coca leaves (the precursor to cocaine) in order to combat fatigue.

Most cases of child labor involve situations where generations of people are trapped in poverty. This situation is potentially different. The larger mine has pneumatic drills, suggesting that technological improvements in Bolivian mining will eventually make child labor unprofitable and therefore obsolete. The 12 and 14 year-old boys go to school in hopes that they can get safer and better-paying jobs when they are older. They wear uniforms that their mother can barely afford. As a professional educator, I am struck by the respect for education and its contrast with the often superficial attitudes of American parents and children towards the schooling process.

Both children and adults in this area believe that, whereas God rules the world above ground, the Tio (Satan) rules the underworld. In order to avoid tragedies and to be granted access to good veins of silver, the miners must pay homage to the devil by praying to him, lighting candles to him, and offering him gifts of tobacco, alcohol, etc.  The boys explain the origins of this devil-worship: When Spanish colonists forced Indians to work in the mines, the latter sometimes rebelled. So, to instill fear, the colonists told the Indians that if they balked at working, the devil would punish them. A local priest explains how he tries to combat this old superstition.",1212019200,7,2258,4.872395833333333
2536256,5,B000EULK14,"Enter a mountain turned into Swiss cheese by four centuries of hodge-podge mining, where today there still are thousands of men and boys --intelligent, humane, dignified people--slowly destroying themselves in order to buy food and shelter.  In Bolivia, overlooking the highest city in the world, Potosi, is the mountain Cerro Rico, nicknamed ""the mountain that eats men alive"".

Ancient, rotted timber sets.  Children hand-drilling with steel and a hammer. Squeezing through crude passages to get to the next level. Lighting fuses by hand and running for the one and only exit. Worn-out, barely functional machinery. Dry pneumatic drills creating clouds of pulverized rock to cut your lungs to pieces, clog them, and kill you. No communication equipment, no meaningful safety equipment or procedures, no regulation, no inspections, nothing. Leave a daily offering at the devil's altar (there's one in each of the hundreds of mines in the mountain), go 4000 feet in and 1600 feet down, and hope you get out alive at the end of your 10 to 24 hour shift. Death by age 35-40.

From a historical perspective, the mines in Potosi highlight the brutality of Spain's legacy in the New World.  Much of Renaissance Europe's silver came from this one mountain. Those beautiful altar pieces in cathedrals and the ornate silver collections of kings and merchants are dripping with blood. It is fascinating that such beauty comes from such sadness.

Geologists think there's still a lot of wealth in the mountain. That, plus desperation, means people will continue to try to find the silver and other metals hidden in Potosi. It's a pity the various mine co-ops don't join together and look at the feasibility of getting the financing to just start at the top and slowly level the mountain. Some people don't like ""mountain-top mining"", but it sure would beat the horrible world of Potosi's deep mines.

Great documentary. I just wish they had included more mine footage, maybe as an extra on the DVD.",1210723200,3,1988,5.024316109422492
2536257,5,B000EULK14,"It shows the reality of Bolivian Miners, my dad was an Industrial Miner in Bolivia for decades, even when I could not go inside the mine ( girls do not supouse to go in) I saw how they lived in the ""campamentos"" and this movie reflex that reality.
I love the folklore part of the movie, even when I think that ""Carnaval de Oruro "" it is the best in the whole country, I really enjoyed the colorful dances.",1192838400,2,405,4.139240506329114
2536258,5,B000EULK14,"Two Americans, Kief Davidson and Richard Ladkani, went to Bolivia to film this documentary. I saw this film at its New York City premiere a few years ago, in a theater in Greenwich Village, and Mr. Davidson was in the audience. He answered a number of questions after the film was over. While some efforts are being made to address the horrific situation of pre-teenagers working under dangerous health conditions in the Bolivian silver mines, nowhere near enough funding is available to prevent this enormously saddening practice from continuing.

The sight of miners--boys and men alike--walking maskless in and through clouds of mineral dust is truly horrifying. Then when you realize that some of these boys are as young as 12 years old, it's even worse. This scenario, when juxtaposed with miners praying to various statues of the devil--most festooned with flowers, food, and other items of thanks--is almost too bizarre to be believed, especially given the devout Catholicism of the population. But in the mines of Bolivia, the devil is, for better or worse, the chief deity--it is he who holds sway over the daily lives of the miners who, if they live past the age of 40, are considered lucky indeed.

The main character in the film is a 14-year old boy who with his 12-year old brother works in these mines to put food on the table for his broken family (the father is not in the household). He goes to school with his brother and hopes for a better future, but it's relatively clear, seeing the film, that this is really a dim kind of hope.

The Devil's Miner brings to light one of the most tragic plights of people living in poverty in various parts of the world. It's interesting to compare this with a feature film, Blind Shaft, set in China, about two miners who perpetrate a murderous scam to make money additional to their work.

This is a superior film, very highly recommended.",1183420800,6,1896,4.736363636363636
2536259,5,B000EULK14,"This film is as much as a documentary as it is a call for action.
American audiences will be taken aback and awed by the story of Bolivia's Vargas family.  If your children do not appreciate the lifestyle they enjoy, (and whose do?) ""The Devil's Miner"" will no doubt inspire some gratitude in them at least until the Ritalin wears off.
This is a brilliant film that points out the consequence of disparities between first and third-world nations. Quite simply, it's always the children that suffer.
Imagine a 14 year-old that genuinely wants to go to school, despite the ridicule by other students who don't have the burden of also being the head of a household.  What adds to the frustration of watching the film is how scant the wages of Bolivia compare to those of even modestly industrialized nations.
All nations will undoubtedly struggle through the same process of modernization that Americans did some 150 plus years ago and Bolivia endures today.  It is odd to see that the same child labor and working conditions that we outlawed so long ago are still alive and well in places like Bolivia.  To see children working in mines and with limited if any safety provisions is as primitive as a modern incarnation of the slave trade.
""The Devil's Miner"" is inspiring in its mission of advocacy and the realization that for the cost of a typical video game system, a child or two in Bolivia could be kept out of the mines and go to school perhaps to eventually lead Bolivia out of its forlorn economic situation.",1182384000,4,1514,4.680451127819549
2536260,5,B000EULK14,"I have two teenagers, and I frequently rent documentary videos for us to watch, so they can ""travel around the world,"" and see how other children live.  We have watched many great documentaries, but none touched us as much as ""The Devil's Miner.""

The story is compelling and had us spell-bound.  Basilio was a most mature and well-spoken boy, and the perfect choice to narrate the story of what it is like to be a child miner in Bolivia.  The whole family was immensely likeable, and we were touched by the obvious love they had for each other.

This story of child miners is, as to be expected, tragic and heart-rending, and yet the unquenchable spirit of humankind is well displayed.  The filming and editing was superb; we could imagine that we were walking beside Basilio on the barren, gray slopes of the mountain, or breathing the dust inside the mine alongside him.

We enjoyed this documentary so much that I am buying one for us to add to our home collection.  I highly recommend it to anyone.",1155859200,8,1003,4.595505617977528
2536261,5,B000EULK14,"Seldom does a documentary capture both my mind and heart, yet 'The Devil's Miner' does just that. This is more than an entrance into hell on earth; it is the story of a child captured by the beast of poverty and despair.

Because of my humanitarian work I have been inside the La Cumbre silver mine, the mountain that eats men. This excellent documentary captures the darkness and dome of those that scrape out a meager living, while at the same time giving the viewer hope for those trapped. There is a light at the end of the shaft, a very small distant light, but light nonetheless.

This is a must view for all who will be going to Bolivia and especially for those who will visit this mine in Potosi. Excellent. Highly Recommended.",1151193600,14,735,4.477611940298507
2536262,5,B000EULK14,"This story, the story of child laborers in the ""3rd world"" is a harrowing account of poverty and misery.  But it is also a story about hope, the hope that these children, and the some 800 other children who work the same mines, can get out of the life and acheive something more than the certain death that awaits all of such miners.  What a great movie, you actually start to feel clausterphobic when the camera takes you to the deepest depths of the mines with these children.  You feel your throat start to close up when you watch these workers walk through the dust without masks.

This movie explains why someone like Evo Morales has come to power in Bolivia, and anyone who derieds such a humble man as Morales needs to watch this DVD.",1148515200,25,741,4.426470588235294
2536303,4,B000EULK14,Decent movie. Spent a LOT of time on the devil worship part of the situation.  Would have liked to see more on the mining operations.,1372032000,,133,4.32
2536304,5,B000EULK14,"This is not just one of the best documentaries I've ever watched, it is one of the best films. I'd like to write a more detailed review but I simply don't know how to sum up this amazing film; the story of Basilio and his family is deeply touching. Getting to know them throughout the documentary and seeing them in their day to day life in Bolivia is moving in a way that isn't quickly forgotten. The scenery and cinematography is also breathtaking, the soundtrack, visuals, and editing are all virtually flawless. A truly beautiful film in nearly every regard.",1369958400,,562,4.63
2536305,5,B000EULK14,"I'm a huge fan of documentaries that show something so completely different, i would have never imagined it existed, let alone in the world toady.  I don't know how to approach the sum of the things I could say but that this is a tragedy.  The documentary follows a 14 year old Bolivian boy, Basillo, who introduces us to his world at the time.  Essentially he is a miner in a silver mine who works to help his family just scrape by.  Already you can say, 14 year old, worker, miner, supporter, what the.... !!  Let us observe this even further.  He then goes on about the fact that they pay homage or worship to the Devil to not cause them harm while in the mine.  to top it off, it turns out the kid is a bit of a Misfit in his school because he is poor and his little brother is being introduced to work in the mine as well.  Seem like a bit much..., well trust me, you have to actually see the film to see not only how atrocious and unsafe the mines are for a child but to see how desperate his situation is.  However all is not drudge and misery, at the same time we are prevued to a glimpse of a part of the world both beautiful and foreign and the mind of an innocent who only sees hope regardless of how unbelievably struggling life can be.",1358121600,2,1248,4.081967213114754
2536306,4,B000EULK14,"A good documentary about a child miner in Bolivia's cerro rico mine. Watching this documentary made me sad. The film showed the reality of Basilio's life working in the mines, living with his mother, sister, and brother, going to school, and making offerings to the Tio. The film was real, honest, and straightforward - it showed raw reality (without drama). This was an interesting dvd, I saw how difficult a miner's life is and what a small amount of money Basilio's family lives on.

On wiki, it says that after the film, Basilio only received $30 and the promise of a new house (which didn't materialize), though over 1 million was donated to help child miners. Is this true? I would like to know if there are ways to help him leave the miner's life. The risk of silicosis is too real.",1349136000,,789,4.556338028169014
2536307,5,B000EULK14,"What is it like to live without a safety net? Kief Davidson's ""The Devil's Miner"" gives us a close-up  of what that means for two young Bolivian boys who live with their mother and sister on the edge of a silver mine. Basilio and Bernardino are 14 and 12 years old. Their father is dead, and they are forced to support the family by toiling in the tapped-out mine. The work--descending into jerry-rigged tunnels to drill and shovel ore back to the surface--is terrifying, dangerous and unhealthy. Rockslides and gas explosions are real possibilities. To allay their fears, the miners give homage to Tio, a demon-figure of the underworld. To properly appease Tio means to avoid being blown up or buried alive. All for the chance to work another day in an occupation that will kill the miners sooner (with explosions or slides) or later (with silicosis).

The film follows Basilio into the mine, and also into his school, where he hopes to gains the education to escape the lung-searing, life-shortening trauma of silicosis. The family is also shown attending a miners' festival, one of the few opportunities to let loose and enjoy life, such as it is. The film's interviews with Basilio show a boy far more mature than this age would suggest. He clearly bears the burden of supporting his mother and sister, of showing his little brother the ropes and of trying to escape his  fate. His cautious optimism is moving. The film ends without a resolution of his situation. No feel-good over-titles tell whether he attained his dreams of becoming a doctor, farmer or engineer.

The film's honesty is breathtaking. The local priest is completely aware that the miners, who worship Christ above ground, also worship the devil below. The priest, a young and sensitive man, understands the unquenchable fear that grips these men. Rather than condemning their idolatry, he hopes to convince them eventually that God's love is stronger than Tio's protection. But it's a hard message to sell to these uneducated, hard-boiled and realistic men.

""The Devil's Miner"" brings the desperation of the world's poor directly into the light. Their nobility and even humor in the face of back-breaking, life-truncating labor is as impressive as it is disheartening. By focusing so tightly on one small family, the film humanizes the anguishing, dispiriting life that is the lot of so many.",1334880000,,2366,4.9646464646464645
2536308,5,B000EULK14,"If you're in the mood for an eye opening documentary... this will do the trick. I was captivated throughout the entire movie; following these children who must work in the mines of Bolivia is both heart wrenching and inspiring at the same time. Any parents out there who have children complaining about homework or school, should show their kids this film... seeing young Basilio work a 14-24 hour shift in the mines, then still have the energy to somehow go to school the next morning is an eye opener. The family that this film follows was so fascinating to me... the children at a young age are wise way beyond their years and show the kind of determination and commitment to family that is getting more and more rare here in America. Immersing yourself in this film will also help you to realize that even the poorest burger flipping minimum wage worker here in America lives like a pampered king compared to these individuals.

There is also the spiritual side of the film which I found fascinating. The miners are God fearing individuals when living outside the mine, but once they enter the mines they pray and worship the devil because they believe the devil is God in the mines. Wow. I'm giving this one my ""must see"" stamp, and if you're a documentary fan like I am, this is a no brainer.",1296172800,2,1298,4.570815450643777
2536309,4,B000EULK14,"The Devil's Miner forces viewers to count their blessings. This documentary focuses on two brothers who are 12- and 14-years old. They live in Potosi, Bolivia, where they must work as miners to support their family. The film offers a compelling story and cinematography that captures the bleak beauty of the Andes.

Filmmakers Kief Davidson and Bernard Ladkani juxtapose the boys' ""work"" lives in the mines with scenes in which they do ""boyish"" things - go to school, play games, and dream of the future. Neither boy has a future as long as he remains in the mines. Miners seldom live longer than 35 or 40 years due to the respiratory diseases that they contract. (Fortunately, people are raising money to provide the child miners with better opportunities).

While The Devil's Miner is ""advocacy filmmaking,"" it is subtle. The filmmakers allow viewers to draw their own conclusions. The boys explain that the miners place dummies made up to look like the devil in the mines because they believe that the devil controls the mines; that alone tells viewers what life is like in the mines.

In summary, this is a powerful, entertaining film that will cause viewers to think. I recommend The Devil's Miner.",1274832000,,1203,4.887254901960785
