8616141,4,B00FJWM0F2,"This box set contains 3 previously released operas in their original DVD cases, housed in a thin cardboard box. All operas are available on Amazon individually.

THE OPERAS ARE:

OTELLO (4.8 stars)  2001
Plcido Domingo is Otello. Barbara Frittoli is Desdemona. Leo Nucci is Iago. Riccardo Muti conducts at La Scala. Excellent singing and acting though Domingo's voice is no longer in its prime. Scenery is poorly designed. It is sparse and mostly depressing. There are hardly any props.

MACBETH (3.8 stars)  2001
Thomas Hampson is Macbeth. Paoletta Marrocu is Lady Macbeth. Roberto Scandiuzzi is Banco. Franz Welser-Mst conducts the Orchestra of the Zurich Opera House. The singing and acting are excellent, especially by Hampson. Costumes aren't from a single period; some are bizarre. Scenery is sometimes nearly nonexistent, sometimes not connected to the story. There are lots of gimmicky director's choices, such as the witches giving Macbeth a manicure and Duncan having green blood.

FALSTAFF (4.0 stars)  2006
Ruggero Raimondi is Falstaff. Barbara Frittoli is Alice Ford. Mariola Cantarero is Nanetta. Zubin Mehta conducts the Orchestra of the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino. The singing and acting are mostly excellent. The period is updated without gaining anything. The stage space is used well until the final crowded scene.
