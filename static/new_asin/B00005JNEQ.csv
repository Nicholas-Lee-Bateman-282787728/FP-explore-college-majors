1523068,5,B00005JNEQ,"I too am utterly baffled as to why this has not been released on DVD. When even series that were canceled after a month due to poor ratings are released to DVD, why not this three-year hit series? There is not a single TV show I am more eager to buy. Scrubs is far and away the most intelligent and hilarious comedy produced on American TV. The writers and director of the series deserves accolades for their ability to shift from screwball comedy to deep poignancy so deftly, their willingness to delve into their characters' emotions and motivations, and their courage to explore meaningful issues. When TV comedy seemed lost to stale shallow caricatures and childish antics, ala ""Friends"" and ""Seinfeld,"" Scrubs is a revelation and a gust of fresh air. I do not know if it is NBC or the production studio so reluctant to release their prize series to DVD, but please, be proud and share it with the world.",1092096000,15,908,4.611111111111111
1523069,5,B00005JNEQ,"This is one of the most original, well-written, entertaining shows that has ever graced the tube! It's very funny, but it's also insightful, thoughtful, and sometimes bittersweet; I was desperately looking for the DVD after Season One and could not believe that it wasn't out there, especially considering some of the rejects that are on DVD right now. Hey, Peacock People, you made the mother of all mistakes by losing Letterman; don't make another colossal boo-boo by moving this show around and/or temporarily replacing it this season like you've been doing. AND...PLEASE, get all of the existing shows on DVD soon!",1091664000,8,618,5.128712871287129
1523070,5,B00005JNEQ,This is an great comedy.  It's different than the typical show and always has something funny.  The monologues/faces/actions the characters have remind me a little of anime and their quirky faces.,1090454400,9,196,5.290322580645161
1523071,5,B00005JNEQ,"One of the funniest shows, on T.V, in my opinion. It brings classic humour, and pushes the envelope, without going over. T.V has lost the abilty, to make new shows, for the life after Sienfeld, Friends, Fraser, but this one has a chance to be that. I would tell anyone to buy this DVD set, if they enjoy a comedy, that they want to watch over, and over. I can't wait for it to come out",1090108800,6,385,4.078947368421052

1523327,3,B00005JNEQ,"Not bad - some good guest stars (LOVED the episode with the old ""St. Elsewhere"" cast).  Braff carries the show and steals the show.  He's adorable and talented and just a natural.  Chalke isn't too bad.  The rest of them...marginal mostly.  Donald Faison (best known for his part as a cute teenager in ""Clueless"") is absolutely unconvincing as resident surgeon Dr. Chris Turk (turkey?!).  Funny show though.  It just goes to show how crazy the 2 years of residency are. And, the number of new doctors who get accepted into residency programs whose competency is highly questionable but still, the patients get stuck with them!  I liked it enough to buy Season 2.  I never saw this show when it was originally aired 15 years ago now (gasp!!!)  I know it was an extremely successful show though, and lasted 9 years, well past the docs' residency years.  Not sure if I'll watch the whole 9 years - I'm taking it on a season-by-season basis!",1461888000,,937,4.652439024390244

1523329,5,B00005JNEQ,This is a show I can go back to time and time again and still be entertained by. Zach Braff's inner monologue can make you cringe with his decisions or laugh at his misguided choices. Well worth the watch!,1460592000,,205,4.282051282051282
1523330,5,B00005JNEQ,"I am just now watching Scrubs. I caught a few episodes here and there when it was on TV but never got hooked. Since subscribing to Netflix, I've had this on my watch list for a while. One night I couldn't sleep and wanted to watch something funny, but short in case I could go back to sleep. I watched a few episodes and at first wasn't sure. I liked it, but I got annoyed with JD's ""thoughts."" I think by the 4th or 5th episode I was addicted and started binge watching. Now I LOVE IT.

I recently found out Netflix is taking it off their server May 2nd. I'll be able to finish the series before then but I was so upset I wouldn't have it around should I want to re-watch. I usually like to have some ""background noise"" when I'm doing things around the house and this series is PERFECT. So I had to own it!",1460505600,,807,4.04375

This DVD release however is lacking, Scrubs was produced in 16:9 and shot on high definition videotape. Unfortunately Disney/ABC used prints that are of low quality.

1523396,5,B00005JNEQ,"""Scrubs"" is a great medical situation comedy series,  if you like their brand of humor, which is warm offbeat, but never too vulgar IMHO.

The series was wonderfully cast  - fun to watch how they play off each other.

It's good that the shows are 1/2 hour - you can get a few chuckles and get your mind off things for a few minutes, then move on.

I had been waiting for this series to come out on Blu ray, but with the odd exception of season 8, this may never happen.  From what I have read, it wouldn't make a big difference picture quality-wise anyway. Bottom line - the first season DVDs looked good on my old tube TV, but look like crap on flatscreens. :(",1439856000,2,661,4.165354330708661

1523440,5,B00005JNEQ,Scrubs season 1 has to be the best show that I have ever seen. The thing that I like about this show is that if you let it in you will follow the dramatic moments with them. I got attached to this show and throughout all of the seasons I was able to connect and be emotional with the show. The cast that was able to be in this show could not have been chosen any better. The star of the show that I have liked to watch as he was the funniest one in the show was John C. McGinley.,1433289600,,479,3.7524752475247523

1523587,5,B00005JNEQ,"Scrubs was the best newest sitcom around.  I doubt anything will top it.  If you love silly and slapstick combined with heartfelt drama in each episode with reflective life evaluations - this is the show for you.  As for the DVDs, I bought them individually (Seasons 1-8.  For non-Scrubs viewers, the show finished at season 8.  Season 9 is technically a spin-off with medical students and only some of the original cast).  I didn't want to buy the full box set once I saw that the DVDs were in the slide-in cardboard sleeves on pages of a book.  While it's a very cute idea, who wants to touch the bottom of their dvd's to get it out?  So I bought each complete season individually and it was a lot cheaper.  Each season has great bonus features - a lot of interviews and behind the scenes and bloopers and alt lines, etc.  So happy I finally have the entire series in my collection!",1402185600,,884,4.401234567901234

1523768,3,B00005JNEQ,"ok first i gotta set one thing straight.  Sara Chalk is awsome.  She was a pleasant suprise despite me liking Lecy Goranson on Roseanne all those years and i usually don't like cast replacements.  Sara Chalk was different, even though i liked Lecy Goranson very much.  She is so adorable.  That smile of hers is truly contagious.
When she flashes the little boy to make his heartbeat speed up and decided that they could save lives I was cracking up.

The show isn't the best in the world.  Im a huge Big Bang Theory fan and I heard a comment on there about how everyone would like Scrubs and so i checked it out, as i do with many things they comment on, on the show.  I really liked Donald Faison in ""Clueless"" but in this he kinda bores me as Turk.
Zack Braffs alrightas John but I think that Dax Shepard would have been better.  Dax is funnier, has the same goofy but cute look and would have looked way better with Sara Chalk.  I think he would have made the show go from okay to downright hilarious.
Sara was the funniest part of this show.
It's not a bad show.  I bought season 1 and Im not gonna buy the other ones but it takes alot of big laughs to keep me watching a comedy.  I enjoy it enough to keep watching but I just don't laugh like I'd like to in a comedy and on the other side I like my medical shows light hearted but not too slapsticky. So even if it was funnier I still probably wouldn't get into it that much.  Im a Greys Anatomy fan.  Serious but laced with humor and laughs in the most oportune moments.  Chicago Hope with the human heart sliding across the floor.  I really wish Three Rivers would have made it.  It was such a great show.",1312416000,,1663,4.163009404388715
1523769,5,B00005JNEQ,"I miss Scrubs so much!  The first season was one of the best and did a great job with character development.  The zany story lines, neurotic characters, and witty humor are why I needed to own the DVD so I can watch it any time.  I highly recommend this DVD if you're in need of some laughs.",1312070400,,291,4.0701754385964914
1523770,3,B00005JNEQ,"The advantages of the show are the jokes and the authenticity of the setting.  (Or at least, authentic enough to fool me.)  Every once in awhile, you get a truly brilliant moment, like when it's revealed that the janitor really is stalking JD. They get points for trying to issue a commentary on medicine, but they pull their punches so scrupulously that on the whole, it comes in as neutral.

Now the weaknesses,

1.  Excessive, maudlin, overt sentimentality:  Practically every episode ends with an extensive monologue where one of the female characters (Eliot, Carla, or John Dorian...you'll see what I mean) blathers on about her feelings and what they learned from the episode as the interpersonal conflict is resolved.  An overwhelming number of episodes result in such underwhelming climaxes of pedantry.  Worse, these climaxes are done over sad-sack emo music, just in case the characters pretty much narrating their melodramas doesn't quite drive the point home enough.

2. This wouldn't be as much of a problem if the characters weren't so damn annoying.  I can barely stand any of these people.  I do not sympathize with their fake, contrived problems.  JD is a combination dork and whiny little pansy (who ridiculously pulls in leading ladies on a regular basis).  You can see the writers trying desperately to take any source of conflict, no matter how trivial or pedestrian, and concoct from it an epic personal drama, because otherwise, there would be no plot.  The simple words ""Get over yourself"" would force the entire series either to radically transform itself or to end.

  One of the virtues of setting a show in a hospital is that the doctors supposedly have little time to whine about their relationships and to learn trite life lessons.  Life Lessons don't work when you have to learn them on a weekly basis (daily in syndication).  The best sitcoms (Married With Children, Arrested Development, South Park) work precisely because their characters, for the most part, don't learn anything.  On the contrary, they keep upping the ante.  That's half the joke.

Ultimately, this show's problem is that it's not really a comedy show.  It's General Hospital with a lot of (often very good) comic relief.  But there is a difference between a soap-opera that employs a lot of humor and a genuine comedy.  Here's one hint.  In a comedy, it's OK to laugh with your characters sometimes, but you better damn well make sure that we're mostly laughing AT them, and it's hard to have a show where you want us to root for the characters and where we laugh at them at the same time.  Who are we rooting for in Seinfeld?  This show is at its best when the characters are irredeemable.  The symbol of comedy in this show is the fat kid who eats Turk's ring.  A comedy can't afford for the audience to care if he dies from childhood diabetes.  If this is a comedy, and he gets diabetes, it'd better be some funny diabetes.

Truly the best real comedy potential in this show as it stands is how seriously these people take themselves.  I could laugh at that all day.  Unfortunately, that potential is not utilized.",1310256000,2,3120,4.791744840525328
1523771,5,B00005JNEQ,When I stumbled upon this show that was like my lucky day. This show has made me laugh more than any other show. I love how its funny yet has seriousness and life lessons woven into it. I've seen every season and no matter how many times i watch it I still laugh every time. The first season was great because it really lets you see how doctors feel when they first start out. The bonus features are great to because it shows how the show is made. I think its awesome that its filmed in a real hospital and not just some set. The first season is a bit on the serious side with some drama. It not all fun and laughs the whole time. The other seasons get a little less serious after this one. But all in all I love this show. It is one of my favorites. Watching it makes me happy on those bad days I need a little pick me up. Its one of the best shows out there. As you watch tv you start to notice all the extremely dumb shows out there. All they are is about sex and drugs. The funny shows are usually just plain dumb and have no substance to them. This show balances it out. Its dumb but smart at the same time. I can take some of the lessons from each episode and apply it to my own life.,1306368000,,1190,3.9214876033057853

1523773,5,B00005JNEQ,"When I got this DVD, I thought it'd be one of those overdone American sitcoms, with canned laughter, bad charactorisation and plots that went for laughs over a good moral. Kinda like the worst aspects of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Friends/dp/B000H6SXMY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Friends</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Happy-Days/dp/B001E6FMMU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Happy Days</a>&nbsp;- glib eye candy.

But, oh boy, how wrong was I! It turns out that the comedy is far more understated and subtle, and that it is balanced by its natural dark twin; tragedy. The story lines do not back away from sometimes having a sad moral, with the season ending being a wonderful example of this.

Oh, and, best of all, there is no canned laughter! Nope - not one single snigger - a joke is a joke, whether you notice it or not, and it is not your gullible duty to laugh at it...

And there are also the characters. From the extremely witty Dr Cox, to the brainy bimbo Elliot, there is depth and insight into the charactors, and they are not all Zack Braff-esque, which makes the interplay surprising and interesting. There are also well-cast cameos in the form of the Janitor's dad as the drill sergeant from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Full-Metal-Jacket/dp/B000P0J09C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Full Metal Jacket</a>, among others.

So, overall Scrubs is definitely worth a watch and, considering it has 24 episodes in the series, it is a bargain as well!

1523875,5,B00005JNEQ,"I have grown to absolutely love this show over the years since its beginning.  There was something intangibly great about the first years of this series, where universal themes came together with laugh-out-loud comedic moments to create something larger than the sum of its parts.  In one way or another, many of us have been through the same sorts of dilemmas which confront JD and crew in these episodes.  Although I have no connection with the medical profession, I still find enough that's broadly applicable here to see tie-ins in my everyday work and personal life.  Ther caharcters also seem very real - I feel like I know these people.  That's the mark of a great show.

The first season represents the original vision, created before anyone knew the series would be so successful.  These episodes seem a bit more undiluted and pure than some of the later ones.  This is why the first volume remains my favorite.

The soundtrack is also pretty good, and has exposed me to a number of musical artists whom I might not have thought to check out otherwise.

Its roots are obvious as it takes a page from every screwball comedy since the days of Chaplin, constantly (and borderline zealously) cutting away mid-scene to show snippets and asides that perfectly complete whatever joke is just about to be spoken.  The effect is extremely cartoonish and I'm pretty sure the writers were Simpson's junkies.
But the comedy mixes well with hospital drama to create a final product that's unlike any medical show out there.  Season one starts with J.D. (Zach Braff) on his first day as a hospital intern.  Only instead of the heavy handed drama and over the top emoting that you get with most hospital shows, this one focuses on making you laugh while managing to sneak in real emotion and wonderfully original characters, making it come across as a more realistic show over-all despite it's zany comedy backbone.  The fact is, most people I know in the medical profession peg this show as being more like real hospital life than all the ERs and Chicago Hopes out there.
Which in my mind is high praise indeed.",1233014400,,1189,4.780487804878049

The nightly doses tie the serialized elements of the show together much better and that opens up an entirely new level of jokes to the viewer. I've since torn through three seasons of DVD and it only gets better and better.

I had watched only a handful of first-run eps over the years but had never really bought into the series. I had been mildly amused at the over-the-top antics but somewhat put off by the almost frat-boyish obsession with ""adult"" humor and with getting Sarah Chalke into her underwear. (It seemed she went shirtless at least every other episode. Although I really enjoy seeing a beautiful woman in her bra, I had a nagging concern that it needlessly exploited her character.)

Apart from that, the writing, the acting, the commitment to colorful and deeply human characterization, and the often compelling portrayal of our collective foibles and nobility is arresting to say the least. From Cox to Carla and from Ted to Todd, there isn't a person on the show that you can't wait to see what they'll do next. That's a brilliant show by any measure.",1206662400,,1164,4.700980392156863

The first set of entertaining episodes of Scrubs can easily be watched more than once without boredom and there is a hint of drama thrown in, though not so much that the show bogs down.

For a great number of years I had to watch I LOVE LUCY episodes over and over and over, if I wanted to spend time with her in front of the TV. One day I was laughing at an episode of the `70's show, and she sat down and watched it and finally realized that the ""Hi~Jinx"" on the show were largely a recreation of our past, and she was hooked.
So... We watched (and still do) the episodes over and over and over.

Then one day, I saw an episode of Malcolm in the Middle, and I was hooked, and eventually my sweetheart saw that that show was our family (give or take) and we watched the show over and over, I think she wanted to cry when the series concluded.
The one thing that really stood out for us was the fact that the writing was so good, that the producers had faith that the audience would get the jokes without a laugh track. Ever since then, we have been put off by any show with a laugh track.

Subsequently, I got hooked on ""Dead Like Me"" after it also was cancelled, but my sweetheart, did not like that show at all, as it was too dark. Finally, last year (It's remarkable how much new TV you can miss by watching old shows in syndication) I sat through my first complete episode of Scrubs, and then only after glowing reviews from Orson Scott Card, on his website. With some work, and stressing the no laugh track angle, I got my wife to watch a couple shows. Soon she also was hooked. So now, even though the show is in its final season, there are plenty of seasons on DVD that we have yet to see.

So here we have started with season one, and it is very, very funny. It contains just the right blend of humor, sarcasm, and caring between the characters, to make for a perfect (even if some of the humor is too adult oriented)  TV show.

A bit real world and surreal world, the staff at Sacred Heart Hospital will have you holding your stomach in agony as the belly-laughs rip forth.

It's difficult to explain and encapsulate all that this TV series is but we'll give `er a go here. It's about medicine, yes, but it's mainly about the people who administer it and how they view their lives in the medical world. The two main characters are doctors J.D. Dorian (Zach Braff) and Chris Turk (Donald Faison). They've been friends for years and now both work at Sacred Heart. Pecking at their friendship are all the staff and all the business that comes along with hospital life. This includes patients, administrators, a wily janitor, nurses and their own fantasy-filled minds. It is this last item that gives the series its greatest boost ...as well as some over-the-topness that occasionally seems all too frequent. For instance, at one point, J.D. (Braff) discovers that he's losing out on the time he and Turk (Faison) used to spend together because Turk has suddenly gotten involved with a pretty nurse named Carla (Judy Reyes). J.D. invents all kinds of fantasies to get rid of her (including feeding her to sharks, telling Turk she's got some fatal form of a sexually transmitted disease, and many others). All of these fantasies are played out on-screen via J.D.'s twisted mind.

But J.D. isn't the only one with delusions of ...whatever. We get inside the minds of almost all the characters, including Dr. Cox's (John C. McGinley) the hospital's whiz-man who oversees all of the interns. It is his insights that are most revealing and funny (he constantly calls J.D. ""Carol"" just to demoralize him). Dr. Cox also enjoys watching soap operas on his breaks and anyone who gets in his way or disturbs this time shall benefit from his wickedly sharp tongue.

Then there's the hospital administrator, Dr. Kelso (Ken Jenkins) who strolls the hallways with a phony smile and not a care for the patients. His main goal is to make sure the facility is financially stable, no matter what the cost (?)!

Mention of the cast wouldn't be complete without telling you about The Janitor (Neil Flynn). A vital part of the ensemble care within Sacred Heart, The Janitor (who has no-name, by the way) lies his way through life and continually harasses those people above him (mostly J.D. whom he captures and stuffs in hiding places so that he gets in trouble for not being where he's supposed to be). The Janitor's mind works quite a bit differently than all the others on the show, giving us a bizarre insight into the lives of those we rarely see (The Janitor also isn't above fantasizing, including operating on patients, and remembrances of winning championship sports that obviously never occurred.)

The overtly silly premises within each characters internal dialogue gives this series almost all of its comedic punch. But it also often drops the comedy down to the lowest common denominator (utilizing bathroom antics, etc.)

It's one of those shows that says, ""Hey! Turn off your brain for a while and let it coast on neutral.""",1180051200,3,3238,4.81294964028777

1524055,4,B00005JNEQ,"Reviewer Michael Mueller is under the impression that this comedy should be something more than it could be - well, my friend, I'd like you to see it for what is.

<<echoing>> It's a COMEDY! Based on FICTICIOUS charecters! Not real life!

I, for one, am glad the writers made it the way it is - hip, full of pop references and sometimes improvisations, and it's about a hospital that I would never go to. The medical system has been ripped apart and skewered before by a little Paddy Chayefsky film called ""Hospital"" in the early 1970s with George C. Scott. To hold this little sitcom up against such other shows as ""M*A*S*H"" etc. is just silly pretense.

Also, to say that this show is a ""lame sitcom"" and full of ""racial and gender stereotypes"" is ludicrous. Everyone here is made fun of - black, white, women, men, little and tall people, clowns, overeaters, drug addicts, cancer patients, the elderly and the children, and almost everyone else you can think of.

So WHAT if there is no actual medicine in the show being performed most of the time - it's about the personalities of these same performers, letting us know that maybe our these people might just be human and have failing points, too. After the disaster of ""Doogie Howser,"" who could ever watch shows like that without wondering about how screwed up they were?

Granted, I will admit that Zack Braff and Co. can get a little too dopey for me to believe they actually know the proceedures they quote, but I understand that that is the point of it. They are the clowns, making us laugh for half an hour. What does REAL medicine have to do with that?

Someone has definately taken an overdose of serious pills.

On a personal note, I only started watching the show just a few months back in early 2007 - not the new ones, but the reruns on Comedy Channel. However, I am glad - GLAD - to have discovered this little treat, and I am buying all of the seasons on DVD. Honestly, watching Hawkeye and ""the Beej"" grow crowsfeet, hunched backs and greying hair over what is only supposed to be in real-time two years while watching him operate and quote outdated proceedures is now kinda sad in retrospect.

I think ""Scrubs"" has succeded in making me laugh, and the writers were smart enough to understand that they are actually keeping it fresh by using the same hateful, misogynistic, latently homosexual, angry, manic dialogue that many of us hear in REAL LIFE at their jobs at one form or another, and (pun alert) it is just what the doctor ordered.

Now for me, I don't know which is worse: that someone could go out of their way to pan this show and it's shortcomings online, or someone like me defending their First Amendment rights to be as witty and as funny as some of the oldest comedies have done in the past, to be morons who reference Huggy Bear and the Love Connection, so that someone like me can understand it because it's not too obscure!

It is FAR AND AWAY funnier than the pathetic and predictible ""Seinfeld"" and can kick ""Raymond's"" crying simpish butt anyday. I hope that whoever DID green-light this show should be HAPPY they did the right thing and saw the potential for the one saving grace of ""sitcoms"" everywhere.

I am amazed that someone can also level charges of racism. RACISM? The names ""Chocolate Bear"" ""Mocha Bear"" are funny in that it's the most obvious way the latent homosexuality can hover between JD and Turk like a rainbow-flavored blanket without looking like a white-hooded robe!

I also think that by using terms of sarcasm such as ""...such sophistication and realism..."" about poo jokes online only goes to show the limited abilities of the person questioning the humor in a poo joke.

These are the same kinds of people who hate Howard Stern, and would have signed a petition 40 years ago to have Lenny Bruce tossed out of New York.

I will grant Michael one observational point, however - there is no character development.

To be honest, why should there be?

John Dorian (not ""Dorien"") IS a ""whiney twit"" - he is also clueless, a total nerd, a scatterbrained dreamer and a lousy dancer and kisser, but in the end he is always willing to give his all for a patient and for a friend. What's wrong with that? For any of them to change their personalities would completely change the makeup of the show. They have a proven track record (and the Emmys to prove it), so why mess with emotional retardation that we can all enjoy?

I am also going to have to admit one other point to Michael: the main theme of the show being ""GenX losers having to take up some slack and join the workforce (in this case as Doctors)"". Yup, I have to admit his point: many twenty-somethings (and even to a lesser extent early thirty-somethings) are pretty much lost to dealing with real responsibility. But, at least the good staff at Sacred Heart have their hearts in the right place.

Lastly, I have to ask: have you ever seen a little film called ""Platoon?"" John C. McGinley was in that, and in that HE played the JD suck-up role to the mentor/father figure of the bunch. It's now 20 years later, and now it's time for him to be the sadist. He was a smart actor by taking on the role of the bitter burned-out mentor because he knew he could be in control. His talents are not wasted.

As with Michael, I've seen worse shows over the years as well: the miserable Seinfeld, Raymond, King of Queens, World According to Jim, etc. they are ALL not funny. But me? I sit back almost every night and get a laugh after a hard day by watching people who are supposed to be professionals rip each other to shreds, just like they do at almost any other place, but it's exaggerated, pulled tight, and I laugh - a lot.

The show is chock full of people who are negative, passionate, schizophrenic, blindingly optimistic, manic depressive, jealous and every other large word that I can think of offhand.

It's funny. I laugh. Mission accomplished. No fighter planes on the deck needed here.

I'm hopeful that I will NEVER get tired of this kind of humor. To do so would to prove to me that I'm finally ready to tackle ""Seinfeld.""",1177977600,10,6098,4.51952770208901

Great character relationships (though it took me awhile to get used to the character of Perry Cox, one of the head doctors, as the actor seems to be doing a weird take on Ace Ventura...it takes awhile to get used to it). If you like good comedy, without the stupidity of TV's usual dreck, this is a choice you'll be happy with. There are some odd diversions into the main character's imagination, but that didn't bother me (the humor in these bits are where the show is the most hit-or-miss though). That said, I saw an episode from the third or fourth season the other day, and it seems like they've really ramped up that part of the show. It got old rather quickly. Also, Braff's character seemed to have become an over-the-top parody of who he was in the early episodes. Kind of an idiot. I'm hoping it was an abberation.

This is one show that has steadily and organically become better over time.

From the pilot through the final episode, viewers can expect belly laughs followed by heart-warming sentiment.  What a fantastic show.  Kudos to John C.

In addition, we get constantly biting sarcasm from mentors (especially Dr. Cox) who have seen it all, and J.D.'s never-ending search for a meaningful and lasting relationship.  The series is also blessed by the fact that these interns' never take themselves seriously, though the janitor is a bit implausible for real life.",1166400000,2,574,5.161290322580645
1524202,5,B00005JNEQ,"""Scrubs"" and ""Homicide: Life on the Streets"" have a lot in common - they are/were high quality shows of their genre that were never given the respect or attention they deserved and were both moved around and ultimately stuck in time slots that would cause them to remain undiscovered by the average viewer. I myself did not discover this series until it showed up in syndication several months ago. ""Scrubs"" came into existence after Bill Lawrence visited some old college friends who were now doctors. Listening to stories about the crazy things that went on during their internships, Lawrence was inspired to create a comedy about young interns learning the ropes of their profession in a hospital environment. Since Lawrence used to work on ""Spin City"", most of that show's cast members have guested on Scrubs over the years.

J.D. - John Dorian - is an insecure, geeky, constantly self-analyzing medical intern and the central character of the show. Everything is narrated by and seen through him. This includes a series of fantasy scenes that occur in almost every episode that amount to the musings and daydreams of J.D.'s overactive imagination.

Dr. Cox is the sometime mentor and sometime tormentor of J.D. Cox is a brilliant doctor and really likes hearing it from anyone who'll tell him. Dr. Cox routinely rants at and/or belittles J.D., though his apparently rough treatment of J.D. is intended as conditioning for the rigors and horrors of hospital life, as well as an outlet for Cox's frustration in his personal life. Much credit has to go to the writers, of course, who consistently give John McGinley (Cox) the best rants you'll find outside of Dennis Miller Live, but they wouldn't be half as funny if not delivered with the perfect intonation and scathing sarcasm by a man who seems like the word ""snark"" was literally invented to describe him. These days, the phrase ""he was born to play that part"" gets tossed around a lot, so much so that it's lost a lot of its meaning, but believe me when I say, truthfully, that John McGinley was born to play Dr. Perry Cox.

Dr. Cox does occasionally offer up words of wisdom to J.D., though. For example, Cox tells J.D. that the ICU is full of old people that would be more than glad to leave this planet, but will likely go on living for years and years. However, he points out, J.D.'s current ICU patient is just young enough to die, since it is Dr. Cox's observation that ""God hates doctors"".

Remarkably, the relationship between Elliot, an attractive and well-off fellow intern, and J.D. takes off and then crashes all in one mid-season episode during the first year, but manages to not turn into the ""Sam & Diane Show"" like Cheers did where eventually the see-sawing relationship took over the show and got so old that there was nothing else to do with it. Also, Carla and Turk are almost instantaneously a couple, but that plays out well too. Their relationship becomes a badly needed bulwark of stability in what is a parade of dysfunctional relationships, even the dysfunctional ones that seem to work. For example, Dr. Cox divorces his wife, and from that point forward their relationship seems to work as well as any relationship involving those two. Dr. Kelso, the evil chief of medicine, has been married for years, but he and his wife live completely separate lives. Instead, the love of Dr. Kelso's life is his dog Baxter.

The janitor, as J.D.'s foil throughout the series, is a great touch of originality - who would think of making a janitor a regular on a comedy that revolves around a hospital? The janitor has an air of mystery about him though. You get the feeling he is a Renaissance man who has decided to retire from the world and hide behind his mop. Especially since he speaks Spanish, Korean and Italian as well as English, being also able to pull off, convincingly, at least 3 different accents and types of English speech.

Through all this there is the friendship of Turk and J.D. that has lasted since college. They are roommates while they are completing their internships and residencies, and share each other's goofy sense of humor. Turk and J.D. own a stuffed Golden Retriever named Rowdy which they treat like a live dog, giving him baths, and speaking to him as if he can answer back. However, Turk is in a surgical residency, while J.D. is a medical resident. This is often shown as a humorous rivalry in which the two groups are made to look like rival gangs in West Side Story or like rival cliques in high school in which the surgery interns are the cool kids and the medical interns are the geeks.

My personal vote for best episode of the first season is ""My Old Lady"" (MOL). There were other close contenders, but this one really stands out. MOL has that spot-on balance of comedy and drama that I love about the show -- early on, J.D.'s voiceover informs us that one out of every three patients admitted to the hospital will die there, then we follow he, Elliot, and Turk as each strives not to be the one to lose theirs. The format allows for equal focus on all three, gives us a great understanding of their individual issues, and ultimately shows just how well the actors were grasping their characters so early on. Very funny in places, intensely emotional in others, and making excellent use of background music, MOL illustrates the Scrubs formula perfectly.",1165708800,10,5369,4.711395101171459

It takes a lot for me to laugh out loud repeatedly and this show hit the mark. The main characters are very sympathetic and easy to identify with. Dialogue is crisp and extremely funny... My only complaint might be that the show focuses much more on the life of the interns than it does on patients -- much like Grey's Anatomy. Wouldn't hurt to have a little bit more development of patients but otherwise this show is excellent.

1524252,5,B00005JNEQ,"I bought Scrubs Season 1 DVD about a year ago. Before that, I never saw the show on TV. That Zach Braff is in it, as one of the main characters, was reassuring. And I read a review somewhere, which was mentioning the show's ""quirky sense of humor."" With this, I could sort of picture a medical drama with a Garden State-type of humor. A drama that has ""real"" people as its characters, that finds laughs in mundane details and combines it with a unique pathos, or at times, insights. If the show can meet half the expectation I have, I wouldn't be painfully disappointed, I figured and bought the DVD.

Then I was amazed and really pleased. While basically being a show I expected, Scrubs went far beyond my expectation. I remember my gasping, on the first viewing, at moments that I did not really expect to see from a network TV show. These moments abound from the very first episode. For instance, when JD asks Turk if he can use the ""extremely volatile racial slur,"" that is the ""n""-word, when he sings a rap song. Or when he tells Eliot that she should ""tease"" Turk for his being black. Or Carla's retort when JD compliments Turk for his starting to have sex with her on a regular basis (""My man Turk is now getting it daily, nightly, and ever so rightly""): ""why do you automatically assume that he and I are having sex? Do latina women put out more?""

These moments are refreshing and can even be taken as culturally significant because they may signal a certain degree of freedom from the kind of political correctness we are assumed to conform to as to the issue of someone's race. These moments are also endearing because they do *not* appeal to the racial stereotypes or prejudices we may have but invite us to rethink about them. In this regard, at least, I think Scrubs is far superior to Grey's Anatomy, another medical drama where racial issues are not really candidly or thoughtfully dealt with.

If you choose to look at it that way, every show (or movie, or novel, for that matter) is about three things: race, gender, and class. Scrubs' way of dealing with these three issues is amazingly original and mature. While having hard laughs, you find yourself rethinking about the notions you previously held as to these, and beginning to think of what the show is really saying. Of course, Scrubs is not an ""issue"" show. Far from it. If it makes you think, it does so in a really subtle, charming way.

I actually have used the show as class discussion material in my composition classes. Every (I mean, ""every"") student responded to the show strongly and found it delightful, pertaining, and very, very funny. In these classes, I could attest the ""greatness"" of the show. I have now watched the first season scores of times, and am sure that, if you are willing to, you can ""do philosophy"" with Scrubs, the way a group of philosophers did with The Simpsons (""The Simpsons and Philosophy"": another very helpful resource for freshman composition class teachers).",1155513600,5,2973,4.614366729678639

I can't say enough about the talent and sheer manic lunacy of the actors and writers.  I just had a heck of a lot of fun and you will too.",1150761600,3,493,4.50561797752809

Season 1 is a must see for any Scrubs fan who may have missed out or may just want to relive the series from the beggining. If you are not a Scrubs fan, or have never seen the show, this DVD is the best place to start.

This DVD has a great deal of laughs, but it also has its moments which slow down and make you think. An episode of which is My Old Lady, in which JD has to deal with losing a patient for the first time since joining the staff as an intern. My Hero also see's Dr. Cox displaying a true sense of emotion and fear for the first time in the series, in which his friend (Brenden Frasier) is ill. You also get to see the relationship between Turk and Carla begin, as well as JD and Elliots rocky relationship start up.

Scrubs will make you laugh, but it could also make you cry. In a time when we see generic sitcoms shoved in our faces, and its hard to tell which is which. Scrubs stands out from these other shows, it has its own wacky sense, and characters unlike any other show. The only misfortune of being a fan of the series, is the fact the network doesn't show it as much respect as they do other shows on the network.

1524297,5,B00005JNEQ,"Scrubs is the only hospital based show that my roomate and I will watch. Not only is it extremely funny but the diagnoses, the medical red tape, and the personalities of the professions could not be more on the mark. There is the nerdy medical residents, the jock surgical residents, the senior resident who kisses up to the chief of staff, and the nurses who seem to be doing most of the hands on work. I really like that it shows the resident for who he is.. a new graduate with not much experience with patients. I could not stop laughing at the second guessing and the confusion that came with their growing up in this first season. It seems like even the great minds can be bumbling fools.

 Whoever wrote this show must have had some background at the hospital because its just so ironic how often a scene where I work has come up during one of the episodes- the patients you get attached to, the box of items pulled out of people rectums, the frequent fliers, and of course the heated disagreements between nurses and doctors.

1524301,5,B00005JNEQ,"A lot of television show season DVD packages although having great episodes offer very little else in the way of extras. Scrubs however is sensational value for money and leads the way with high quality features and lots of them setting the bench mark at where the others TV shows need to aim. A lot of television show pilot episodes and first seasons also are no where near the quality of later seasons but again not so with Scrubs.  Scrubs hit the ground running with their masterpiece pilot that not only set the scene for the series but in my opinion is up there with the funniest episodes ever.  I don't know any other TV show that you can say that about.

As well as all 24 original first season episodes we also get the show's theme song, Superman Music Video which I had never seen before.  There's also deleted scenes, outtakes and cast interviews.  The cast interviews are brilliant you really get to see what the actors are like outside of their characters.  Complementing this feature is the Favourite Moments sections where the stars and key crew members don't just relive parts of episodes which are their favourites but tell you why they enjoy them so much.  The features are also very informative, you'll know so much more about the show after watching them.  For example the lines after ""Did you Stick a Penny in There"" were all adlib by the janitor gaining him a regular spot and allowed the tension between the janitor and JD to be a part of every episode.  Newbies, where we learn about the actors before Scrubs is also entertaining and interesting.

Scrubs is one of the few shows where it doesn't matter that you've seen the episode before you just keep watching them over and over again with the fun part being just waiting for the lines.  The advantage scrubs have over other high quality comedy shows such as Seinfeld who have the line factor is that Scrubs also has the surreal sight gags which means you're eagerly awaiting not just funny lines but the funny sight gags as well.

Scrubs the Complete First Season is exceptional value for money. 24 episodes, plus a few on twice with voiceovers versions as well as heaps of high quality bonus features mean you just have to own this sensational show on DVD!",1141948800,,2233,4.596977329974811

1524335,3,B00005JNEQ,"The late 1990s was a great time to experiment with the concept of a one-camera comedy. A few plucky storytellers were able to combine the ""bardic"" nature of dramatic TV with the ""silliness"" of the sitcom. Shows like ""Sex and the City"" and ""Malcolm in the Middle"" were complete shocks to the system, and their early seasons completely rocked. Their failings were that they depended too much on their ""bardic"" heritage and relied on narration (via voiceover or on-screen asides) to keep the story flowing--a crutch of television and movie storytelling. ""Scrubs"" monopolizes on this new style of one-camera comedy by pushing the ""bardic"" and ""silly"" aspects to their limits. This usually works in favor of the show, but there are undeniable drawbacks.

The late 90s also saw the rise of New Wave Emo style, which eventually punctured TV with shows like ""Ed"" and ""That 70s Show."" It's nice that sensitive, wimpy whiteboys had outlets for their simpering, pathetic troubles, but it does not make for interesting television. In ""Scrubs,"" JD has countless wonderful and inspiring moments, but he also has irritating ""Emo"" moments. JD's kvetching can be spot-on and charming one minute, and then--like the one-camera comedy often does--pushes it too far. His show-concluding ""realizations"" morally superior to everyone else's, and considering that he's the narrator, these ""resolutions"" often come out ""godlike."" Though the rest of the cast is downright amazing, ""Scrubs"" is undeniably JD's story, and hands agency to a white male archetype without making him suffer to earn it.",1140998400,2,1570,5.23015873015873

1524337,5,B00005JNEQ,Scrubs is so clever and original. The show is so funny and so much fun to watch. These are great dvds to own because you can watch them over and over and still laugh as hard as the first time. Also the bonus scenes and interviews are good. I don't find too many other people who are as devoted to Scrubs as my husband and I are and I can't understand it. I rate it and Seinfeld as the best comedies on network tv during the last 15 years.,1140912000,,438,3.932584269662921

1524339,5,B00005JNEQ,"I only recently discovered SCRUBS after complaining to several people that if ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT didn't find a new home I wouldn't know what I would do for laughs on TV.  After a couple said that SCRUBS shared a number of ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT's qualities, I decided to give it a try.  Living in the age of the DVD picking up a show several seasons into its run is a piece of cake.  I can now agree with my friends that this, with ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT, the best comedy currently running on TV.

Everyone has personal biases and mine regarding TV are shows dealing with cops, lawyers, and hospitals.  That unfortunately cuts a wide swathe in the genre and is one of the reasons I had never wanted to give the show a try.  Its hospital setting remains one thing I don't like about it.  But I love everything else.  The show is driven both by brilliant writing, a strong ensemble cast, and a great production team.  It also shares one quality with ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT that tragically only a few television comedies actually possess:  it is funny.  It doesn't elicit nearly as many belly laughs as ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT, but on the other hand it has many more serious moments that the other show never tries to achieve.  It strives for a slightly different alchemy.

The first season is built around the adventures of three interns at Sacred Heart Hospital:  John ""JD"" Dorian (played winningly by Zach Braff, whom I previously knew from GARDEN STATE), Elliott Reid (Sarah Chalke), and Christopher Turk (Donald Faison).  They are under the tutelage of the tyrannical hospital head Dr. Bob Kelso (Ken Jenkins).  Dorian gains a mentor in Dr. Perry Cox, played by John C. McGinley, who manages to steal just about ever scene he is in.  The cast is rounded out by Judy Reyes, who plays Nurse Carla Espinosa, who becomes romantically involved with Turk and Neil Flynn, who plays the Janitor.  All in all, it is a superb cast and is supplemented both by a number of regular guest stars, such as Christa Miller, who plays Dr. Cox's ex-wife Jordan and hospital board member, and Robert Maschio, who plays the high-fiving surgery intern Todd.  There are also a number of excellent guest appearances by familiar actors, most notably WILL AND GRACE's Sean Hayes and Brendan Fraser, who plays Jordan's brother.

The show loves to stretch the boundaries of what you can do with fantasy sequences and intentional absurdities.  What is remarkable is how often these efforts succeed.  In this regard the show is similar to shows like ALLY MCBEAL (the show that established the use of frequent fantasy in comedy).

Now that we have DVDs there is absolutely no reason for anyone to avoid getting into this first-rate comedy.  I strongly encourage anyone in need of a good laugh to dive right in and enjoy this one.",1139011200,,2792,4.756756756756757

The characters start to fire as soon as they hit the screen.  And left me wondering how they kept such a high standard for 4 plus seasons.

The storyline unfolds as you watch the first few episodes. JD is a new intern in Sacred Heart Hospital, and as he learns more about the people there, he makes friends and rivals, and his interactions with both are hilarious. But he also has difficulty with others, which can be touching and/or saddening. In between everything he has little fantasies that are very entertaining.

Its a shame this show has been treated so badly by NBC.

1524394,5,B00005JNEQ,"Since Scrubs first debuted I was an immediate fan. I found the wonderful mix of comedy and drama unforgettable, and was locked on every week, more and more excited for each new episode. I lost track of when Scrubs came on after this season, but when I found out Season 1 was coming out on DVD I was right there ready to buy. Every episode was just as good, if not better, than I remembered them to be, and having them uncut was a much desired plus.

As you probably know, Scrubs can go from tear-jerking to hilarious in mere seconds, I like this quality in a show. If a show focuses only on comedy, it gets stale over time, if it focuses only on drama all the time, it gets boring. In Scrubs' case, they have actors that are hilarious when they want to be and as serious as can be when they need to be. There is no better way to see this skill than in the episode entitled My Old Lady. Side-splitting one minute, and 'pretend you got something in your eye so they won't know you're about to cry' the next minute. Each situation JD and his friends are put in seems like it could happen to anyone who works in a hospital. A bully, a bossy mentor, and of course, friends. Relatable on every possible level.

If you've been deprived from this wonderful show you shouldn't waste another minute thinking whether you should buy this or not. For the price, you cannot pass it up.",1132099200,5,1371,4.269230769230769

The cast is amazing - each one adds something totally unique and complimentary to the others.  The music is also great.

I couldn't believe that I had never heard of such a funny show, even though it's been going on for 4 years. I love JD's weird thoughts that go on.

1524397,5,B00005JNEQ,"I stumbled onto Scrubs on accident.  I was flipping through channels one day and it was on.  I had heard a lot of great things about the show, so I was curious to see what the deal was.  From the moment I began watching the show, I was completely hooked.  It wasn't that the show was funny; it was that the show was real.  The characters were so easy for me to relate that I immediately felt a connection to the show.  The humor is top-notch, and the writing is sharp.  There's plenty of wit and sass in the script, and being that it's on a broadcast channel and not on a cable network, that makes it an anomaly on television.  It has been a long time since a sitcom had the bite and the intelligence to support it, yet Scrubs has that quality.  Very few shows have the ability to have that intelligence and wit yet still be able to make the audience feel for the characters (M*A*S*H, Cheers, and the first half of the Simpsons' long run contain this).

The first season sets the show up naturally.  The main character is a complex yet juvenile geek.  His best friend is a competitive yet emotional jock.  The new person in their lives is a woman with a low self-esteem and a penchant for neurotic tendencies.  The chief of medicine is a cold-hearted businessman.  His direct subordinate is an antiestablishment figure with a case of sarcasm and heart.  The nurse that glues these people together is a fiery independent who may be a nurse, but she knows more than any of them would like to.  Throw in a vicious ex-wife whose idea of punishment is actually an act of hidden love and a janitor whose demented acts are absolutely genius, and this is the crux of the whole show.  There are absolutely hysterical moments, poignant moments, somber moments, and joyful moments littered throughout the show, sometimes all in one episode.  No episode feels like it has a false note.  No line seems out of place.  No story arc seems contrived.  The emotions are as real as they can get, and the laughter is as well.  This season overall is excellent.  Granted, a couple episodes aren't as tight as the rest, but those episodes don't detract from the experience at all.  They are great episodes in their own right, and that says how high-quality the first season was.  The episodes ""My Old Lady"" and ""My Bed Banter and Beyond"" show the reality of the drama and relate it to the audience without ever dumbing it down.

There are people who don't like this show, and I understand why.  It isn't one's average modern-day sitcom where the reactions are purely visceral and the jokes are blatant.  This is a sitcom where the reactions are from within and the jokes play with your mind.  It's higher comedy.  It's real drama.  It's a high-class dramedy, yet to call it a dramedy cheapens the show to an extent.  All I can say to do it justice is to watch and learn.",1131148800,3,2848,4.457364341085271

McGinley's performance as Dr. Cox is one of the best characters in television history. The character is so mean, evil and sarcastic yet you can't help but love him. McGinley deserves an Emmy nomination, at the least, for this great role.

Scrubs is a very well written show that just has not gotten the respect that it deserves. It is constantly shuffled around on NBC's schedule and the biggest injustice of all is that NBC left the show of it's fall schedule. One of the funniest shows on television has now been turned into a midseason replacement and that is just a tragedy. That is why I am glad to see that Scrubs has now been released on DVD. Now I can watch this show whenever I choose and it can get the proper attention and respect it deserves. Maybe if this series sells well on DVD NBC will realize what a gem they have and return it to the schedule. Also I am glad that they are not hesistating to release future episodes in a timely fashion. I look forward to getting season 2 when it is released.

My favorite part of this show is the incorporation of the Ford Taurus, which is being callously replaced by the Ford Focus (recently recalled for being dangerously uncool).  Personally, I drive a Passat, because I love having to explain to people it's not a Jetta.

1524448,5,B00005JNEQ,"A few people I know and respect don't think Scrubs is the best thing on television.

These are nice, quiet, older people whose life has been relatively free of adventure, tragedy, or professional angst.

The rest of us think it's amazing.  Scrubs brings together the elements of great entertainment in a way few can: humor, plot, music, and (at the risk of sounding corny) heart.

Acting isn't always the strongest in Scrubs.  Lines occasionally fall flat, and the cast's inexperience sometimes shows.  The first episode with Elliot's wierd and pointless competitive behavior stands out (thankfully, she later morphs from hyper-competitive to over-achieving and neurotic, a much better fit).  Dr. Cox's hilarious abuse sometimes goes over the top, too.  Especially unimpressive are the times he walks out of the room in a pretend rant, talking to himself.  It just never delivers, and watching it the second time is like the 2-minute urination scene in ""Austin Powers""; it's just not durable humor.  Finally, the Christmas episode is pretty schmaltzy and not very innovative: the salvation of that episode falls somewhere between the bikini-clad mistletoe fantasy and Nina Simone's ""Oh, Sinnerman.""

And that's really the whole point: what the show has wrong is pretty small in comparison to what it does right.  Moments from the first season I could watch ad nauseum:

-JD's fantasy of how life with Elliot would be if he kissed her and she reciprocated or didn't (imagined doctoring on the street, or marriage and threesome sex);

-""I don't like having people touch me unless we're having sex, and then not too much.""  ""Me too.  So where in Connecticut are you from?""

-JD and Turk dancing to the Sanford and son theme.

-Anything involving Dr. Cox's ex-wife, Jordan (Christa Miller).  Every word out of her mouth is hilarious.  Of course, when your husband is producer, you're guaranteed a few good ones.

-Finally, JD's dad, the late John Ritter, stealing a Jell-o cup in the cafeteria.  Everytime I see him quietly drop the Jell-o he was holding while carrying on his conversation I bust out laughing.

These aren't the only great moments; the show is full of them.  The humor is innovative, and I can't wait to fork over another $30 for season two.",1125532800,3,2254,4.981233243967829

1524452,5,B00005JNEQ,"I saw my first episode of SCRUBS about two months before this first season DVD set was release on DVD. After seeing just a few episodes, I became an addict and SCRUBS is one of the few television shows I watch on a constant basis. The series will always be known as the show that launched Zach Braff's career. However, as talented as he is, the show has so much more to offer than just Braff. Bill Lawrence makes it a point to keep continuity in the shows he creates and develops. Because of this continuity, SCRUBS has not only a great cast of feature players, but has a great ""B-Team"" (what Lawrence calls the supporting actors) that make the show even that much more lively and entertaining. Also, unlike many of the prime time tv shows, SCRUBS has some great writing. Medical mumbo-mumbo, witty one liners, and poignant monologues are all woven together seamlessly in one conversation without dropping a beat or slowing the show's pace. In order to get a true sense of reality, SCRUBS is actually filmed in an abandoned hospital. Some of my favorite episodes in SCRUBS Season One include:

""My First Day""

""My Old Lady""

""My Hero""

""My Last Day""

The last episode of the season is particularly revealing: it is JD's last day as an intern but the cast and crew thought the show was going to be cancelled and thus, despite the cliffhanger depressing ending, filmed it as their last day, too.

There are less than a handful of high quality shows on tv nowadays. SCRUBS is one of the few and a person can see how it all began with SCRUBS: The Complete First Season.

Besides all the first 24 episodes, the DVD set also includes a set of retrospectives by the major actors; a one-on-one session with Zach Braff talking about his experiences during the first season; a making of featurette; ""Superman"" music video by Lazlo Bane; deleted scenes; outtakes; and a few other features.",1125100800,,1878,4.604790419161676
1524453,5,B00005JNEQ,"Scrubs is one of those shows that doesn't get the ratings that it truly deserves, and because of that, often doesn't get the attention when it comes to recognition and award shows.

That did change a little this year when the show received some nominations, and a look back at the first season shows where this smart and very funny show got its roots and how everything got started.

The show follows the life of a trio of interns as they enter their first jobs at Sacred Heart hospital. Zach Braff is the series' main star, as he plays John J.D. Dorian, who provides the voice overs for much the show and additionally, the show is written mainly from his perspective, which is obvious by the titles of every episode: ""My Hero,"" ""My Last Day,"" etc. Braff is a great actor and this character really fits him well. In the first season, as a doctor probably is at that point in his life, J.D. is pretty nervous and unsure of himself. Braff projects that innocence, and as the season moves along, the growing confidence, very well.

Donald Faison plays J.D.'s best friend Chris Turk, a surgical intern. The two roomates have been friends for years and their relationship serves as a great catalyst for both humerous moments and serious issues. Turk begins his relationship with nurse Carla Espinoza (Judy Reyes) in this very first season. Their chemistry is very good, and like the relationship with J.D. and Turk, serves as a great story line.

Sarah Chalke is the third intern of the group, nervous Elliot Reed. She has serious issues in many walks of her life, including guys and her family. She is very unsure of herself, and of the three characters, remains the most unsure of herself as the season goes on. Her character is great and works well off of the rest of the cast. She and J.D.'s ever-changing relationship is just one more story that flows throughout the season, and as the years go on, through other seasons.

John C. McGinley is great as Dr. Perry Cox, a senior doctor on the staff, who enjoys giving all the interns a hard time, but he finds J.D. particularly amusing, constantly referring to him as any number of girls' names. He does have a respect for the young doctor and that is shown at a number of points in the season, but his great comic chops are what make him one of the funniest guys on television. His back and forth with chief of staff Bob Kelso (Ken Jenkins) is also a lot of fun.

While he wasn't a credited star in the first season, one of the best characters on the show is the janitor, played by Neil Flynn. There really is no way to describe his sense of humor, you just have to see it for yourself.

Recurring stars Sam Lloyd (Ted the lawyer), Robert Machio (The Todd) and Christa Miller-Lawrence (Jordan Sullivan, Cox's ex-wife) add some great moments to the show and guest stars Brendan Fraser and John Ritter are fantastic in their limited roles on the show.

This set also includes a great stock of extras, including commentaries by creator Bill Lawrence and a number of different cast members. There is also a feature looking at the cast before they were ""Scrubs,"" plus many interviews with crew and cast members. These extras really make this DVD set shine.

For a great comedy, one that doesn't get the attention that it often deserves, pick up this set. It is well worth the price.",1124755200,2,3325,4.556113902847571

This season was the best. Everything was still completely fresh. This show is almost like the Twin Peaks of comedies. The stories aren't especially bizarre, but flashbacks and things ""seen from J.D's perspective"" make this very odd indeed.

And yet, the humor is accessible by almost anyone. As you can see, there isn't yet a single one star review for this show.

The extras aren't great, although the commentary tracks are usually worth listening too. Otherwise, the DVD is a fairly regular TV DVD release. However, this just leaves more room for the show to shine. And boy does it ever.",1124496000,,678,4.777777777777778

1524466,5,B00005JNEQ,"Living in England, we get a lot of American sitcoms.  Some good, some bad, some not bothering giving the time of day with.  Boring, mundane, annoying and frustrastingly poor.  Conforming to the same tired formula of studio audience who laugh on cue, format.  Very rarely do we find in England such a unique programme that stands out so much than others, largley due to the removal of the audience, allowing us to laugh when WE want to.  In the 70s we had the superb 7407 M*S*S*H, when they ditched the laugh track.  In the 80s we had David Rache as the most fantastic Sledgehammer, in the late 80s, we had Fred Savage as Kevin Arnold in The Wonder Years.  In the ""naughties"", we had Malcolm in the Middle, and now Scrubs.  I was only introduced to this programme recently and am now aware that it is in it's 4th series.  That right??  I bought the first series on DVD on the strength of watching a few episodes on UK station, Channel 4, and also on a digital channel, ABC1, ABC's UK sister station.  What a fantastic programme!!  A bunch of out of their depth interns thrown into a real hospital environment.  Original, beautifully crafted  and perfectly delivered dialogue makes this a gorgeously charming programme to watch.  You can't help but love these characters.  The actors, for me, are people I've never heard or seen of before, with the exception of Turk who was in Clueless.

I always thought it would be a comedy that I wouldn't like, so never bothered with it until I stayed with my brother for a week in Dublin and fell for it straight away.  And lets face it, Sarah Chalke, I mean, wow!!  What a beautiful woman to look at on the Telly, and what a fantastically talented actress to watch in a show where the entire cast are having an absolute ball, which clearly shines through.  If you haven't seen this, then you will know someone, surely, that has.  Watch it with them, then buy a copy as this is one of the few to own and not borrow, or record off the TV.",1123891200,2,1974,4.427777777777778

I love this show.  As someone who has all but turned away from network television, I didn't see this show until the third season.  While I missed some great shows, I did have the blessing of watching the whole season for the first time, commercial free and during my favorite time of the day.

The humor is fresh and the frequent views into what the characters are really thinking allows us to connect with the well-developed characters.  It's hard not to love nearly every one of the regulars.

1524470,5,B00005JNEQ,"The above headline sums up best what I like so much about ""Scrubs"": a show with not just totally awesome dialogue, but also attention to detail, which sets this show apart from all others currently airing (maybe except ""The Dead Zone""). The characters and the hospital are slighly surreal, thoughts and events refer to each other constantly - so for maximum enjoyment, you have to be willing to let yourself sucked up into Sacred Heart Hospital. It's quite brilliant to have Zach Braff's storyline telling in all the episodes. That's a good red thread - after all, it gets quite chaotic sometimes when several storylines run along parallel. Another strength of the show is that it's not just slapstick, but also serious at times - which serves as a reminder that life is not to be taken all too lightly, but treated with the proper respect. And such a message is rare for a sitcom. Technically, the show is well edited, with great actors, partially really profound storylines - and of course, stupendously great music (I recommend you get the soundtrack CD, too!).

Just one drawback: each episode makes you yearn for more - SO RUSH THEM SUCKERS OUT MORE QUICKLY!

The packaging was criticised by some viewers. I think it's quite inventive and fits the content of the show. However, the blue screen attached to the front does come loose quickly, which makes it hard to store it in the box. Just a minor detail, though...",1123372800,,1420,4.744939271255061

1524524,4,B00005JNEQ,"Yup, those quirky interns and doctors from Sacred Heart Hospital are on DVD now. Things happening in a hospital surprisingly makes for a fun watch.

The show centers on J.D., an intern in Sacred Heart. He is joined by his close buddy, Turk. He makes weird connections with his fellow intern, Elliot. They are joined by Turk's girlfriend, Carla. Secondary characters like Dr. Cox (J.D.'s idol), the janitor who apparently enjoys tailing J.D and teasing him as well as a balding lawyer who goes out of his way to educate doctors about avaoiding lawsuits are really a hoot to watch.

I agree with most reviewers that this is a really entertaining show. Every episode, we are given crazy scenarios in the hospital and sometimes the personal lives of the interns, and in the heart of it, there will be a lesson to be learnt. However, many people hail it as different and creative, which unfortunately I have to disagree. The ""thinking from a third person"" approach has been done to death in shows like Ally McBeal. Certain characters also depicts characters from other TV shows, like there is a huge resemblance of Dr. Cox to Dr. Becker, from the show ""Becker"". However, this doesn't really matter because these elements incorporated from different shows come together very well for Scrubs, in fact better than the shows that introduced them. So, you end up having a really good time.

Scrubs has obtained huge success, having been through 4 seasons and still looking strong. Personally, I wouldn't say this is the best comedy out there, I enjoy ""Friends"" and ""Arrested Development"" much more than Scrubs. But having said that, this still makes for a pleasant watch, with it's witty dialogue, funny scenarios and some of the most zany guest stars. Recommended!",1122336000,,1755,4.882550335570469

The show has brilliant dialogue, they do a good job of lot letting it get too technical too.  The flashbacks, or images of what goes on in Zach Braff's mind, are excellent well.

1524531,5,B00005JNEQ,"A while back, I'd introduced my girlfriend to Scrubs.  She didn't like it much.  She thought it was okay, but wasn't overwhelmed by its comedy.  As I made her watch a few more episodes, she started to like it more and more.  Then the season one DVDs arrived.  She now loves the show.  What she didn't realize at first is that Scrubs is more than just a comedy.  The characters all play so well off each other.  There's incredibly touching moments in the show, where the characters are forced to grow (like JD's patient telling him she's ready to die, or Elliott choosing her career over Scott Foley).  I don't know a single show that has ever blended comedy in with so many touching moments half as well as Scrubs has, while casting actors who are all brilliant for their parts (including Clueless Guy, and Clueless Guy's friend...  Watch the extras for the reference).  Season one had to be the best season Scrubs has done, and my girlfriend is now as devoted a fan as I am after watching the full season with me.

Here's the deal, and the reality of it all.  As great a show as Scrubs is, it will never be a hit.  Ever!  Why, you ask?  Because it's different.  Most people in this world don't want a different show, they want the same thing.  They want Friends, Friends spinoffs, Cheers, Cheers spinoffs, CSI, CSI spinoffs, Survivor, and all the reality shows it's delivered, and television shows that are overhyped.  When they go to the movies, they want sequels and old television show remakes.  Don't get me wrong, I've seen and loved Batman Begins, and I'll be going to see Star Wars again soon.  Many people don't like unexpected or original.  But fans of quality television look at shows like Seinfeld and movies like Napoleon Dynamite, and think that Scrubs or Arrested Development might follow in the footsteps of their success - as quality shows or movies that nobody watches at first, but soon catch fire with a much bigger following.  But they won't.  The reason is those shows are completely quotable.  Think about how many times over the years you've heard people refer to things as Seinfeldian, or how many people still quote Seinfeld, referring to someone as a close-talker, or having man-hands, yadda yadda yadda, or imitating Elaine's dance.  Now try to think of quotable lines from Srubs.  All I can come up with is if someone tells me to kiss their rear, to ask if they'll hold me after, or calling my coworker Newbie.  Scrubs was never overhyped, isn't familiar territory, and ultimately isn't completely quotable.  But it's quality television with no apologies.

If you're already a fan of the series, you need to re-live the first season with this DVD collection.  If you're not, try not to let how different it is scare you away.  And if you already like your comedy to NOT involve someone saying, ""How YOU doin',"" this show may just be for you.",1121040000,7,2870,4.632936507936508

There are very few shows on television that can get me to laugh out loud, including the more typical sit-coms that employ a canned laugh-track to fool you into thinking the jokes are funny. But watching Scrubs, without any laugh track or anyone else in the room to laugh along with me, I will still find myself rolling on the floor from time to time.

But that's the surface stuff. Better still is that fact that the characters have some legitimate depth. Writing that... well, there's no better way to say this...doesn't suck. Some of the most creative camera work on television. Who among you doesn't get tired of the fixed camera ""filmed for a live studio audience"" feel?

I bought this DVD set and spent the entire weekend watching each episode, some more than once.  I have never seen a show so unpredictable, intelligent, heartwarming, yet silly all rolled into one 23 minute segment.  JD is endearing, his friends Carla, Turk and Elliott are quirky and real, and the fantasy sequences are an absolute hoot.  If you have never seen this show, it's about the trials and tribulations of John Dorian (Zach Braff) learning the ins and outs of becoming a doctor at Sacred Heart Hospital.  Sometimes he wins, sometimes he loses, and really, sometimes an episode will make you cry and laugh, all in one short span of time.  JD learns from Dr. Perry Cox, a curmudgeonly, sarcastic, yet soft-hearted veteran doc and the cranky, mean-spirited Dr. Kelso, the hospital's chief of medicine -- all the while being tormented by the hospital's janitor, played by Neil Flynn (Dad on Mean Girls).  Watching Cox and Kelso butt heads is entertainment in itself - but throw in special guest stars such as Brendan Fraser - and later in the series, Michael J. Fox - is spectacular.  The result is fast-paced, fresh and quirky fun and a work of genius.  I waited for three years for season one to come out on video, and am anxious for seasons 2 - 4 to become available.

For a first season, this is great and less expiremental than in other shows.  The commentaries are also actually interesting unlike most other DVD sets. (I found it interesting that Neil Flynn who plays the Janitor ab libs almost all his lines).

The reason that NBC always shovels it around and doesn't advertise it is because the show is owned by Disney.  Therefore it is Disney who ultimately profits from the show.  Thus NBC would much rather spend money to advertise one of its own shows, and they also knows that no matter how often they move Scrubs, us loyal fans will always seek it out.  I still think it was a low blow that they're not including this in the intial line-up for fall (it'll come along later as a midseason replacement).  I don't think it'll ever be canceled, but the whole Disney ownership thing will prevent this from being marketed to the masses, and keeps it at cult status.

The casting of the main characters is excellent.  Zach Braff may have been unproven at the time, but he has proven to be a great choice, and I doubt any Scrubs fans were surprised by his recent film success in Garden State.  Donald Faison and Sarah Chalke both give their characters great texture, and Neil Flynn has a number of scene-stealing moments playing the Janitor.  However, the person who stands out most in this first season is the horribly underrated John McGinley, who plays Dr. Cox with a manic energy that has somehow gone unnoticed for 5 years.  While there are times you might despise him, he's also easy to sympathize with, and his character is responsible for many of the show's great moments.

There are several standout episodes, with very few weak ones.  The episodes, ""My Mentor"" and ""My Super Ego"" stand out, since they inject some seriousness into the usual comedy.  The development of the Cox-J.D. relationship is enjoyable to watch, as is the development of the supporting cast.

You have to pay close attention, or you'll miss something happening in the background, or some chance comment, or hilarious leap of consciousness.  The soundtrack, a great mix for this millennium, is better than Garden State or Shrek, both of which were also great.  And for meaning - ""My Old Lady"" has more emotional content, delivered with just that little necessary vinegar, than any overly wrought ER episode.  I am a nurse, and Scrubs catches more of the reality of a hospital environment than any of the dramas, especially the nighttime soap Greys Anatomy.  The main characters and their actors - Dorian, Turk & Carla, Elliot, Kelso & Cox, Janitor - are fantastic, and they don't skimp on stunt casting with the guests - St Elsewhere's visiting cast comes to mind.

Scrubs is definitely one for the DVD collection, because it takes at least 3 viewings to catch all the jokes, much like the Simpsons (the 2nd best show on TV).",1117843200,3,1129,4.690355329949239
1524619,5,B00005JNEQ,"I've long thought that ""Scrubs"" was the best show on network TV and these DVDs do nothing if not reaffirm that belief. This show is as fresh, funny, and original as it was when it first aired four years ago. The talented cast have incredible chemistry and great comedic timing. They interact very well with one another, whether they're fighting or telling jokes.

""Scrubs"" is maybe the one show since ""The Wonder Years"" that the voice-over narrative isn't annoying and corny (I'm talking to you, ""Sex and the City""). The (numerous) fantasy sequences, which would be so easy to go overboard with and make awkward and inappropriate, are laugh-out-loud hilarious; a true highlight of the show is watching what goes on in Dr. Dorian's head. Doctors Cox and Kelso's characters are often over-the-top--especially their shoot from the hip retorts--but they are quickly reigned in by writers. Nurse Roberts's character is absolutely fantastic--her deadpan must be seen to be believed. Running jokes--such as Rusty the Dog--are funny no matter how many times you've seen him. The guest stars in the first season are excellent, including John Ritter and Brendan Fraser.

The extra features on the DVD are what made this review go from 4.5 stars to five--no skimping here, as is typical of many shows. The special features offer real insight into the show and cast, offering cast and crew interviews, alternate lines, bloopers, anecdotes of how the stars got their roles, and numerous commentaries.

A rumor circled among ""Scrubs"" loyalists that the show wasn't going to be released on DVD until the syndication rights were sold. I hope that since Season One is available it means I can count on reruns of ""Scrubs"" to appear sometime in the future, hopefully taking the place of the thirteen episodes of ""Full House"" that seem to dominate afternoon TV.

I cannot wait for more seasons of this quirky, original show to be released on DVD, and for the show to return in the fall.",1117670400,4,1966,4.930513595166163

I hope all you guys who are bummed out that Scrubs hasn't received the attention it deserves in the U.S. can take some consolation from the fact that over here in the U.K. season 3 is airing on the same channel as Friends and Will & Grace and at roughly the same time (20:30 Friday nights).

As for the DVD, it has some great cast interviews and behind the scenes footage. Inside the box there was a flyer saying that season 2 will be out soon. I hope that is the case, cos watching this show is like a drug man....AND I NEED MY FIX!!",1117584000,2,649,4.150793650793651

The two episodes that I did watch were clever enough to pique my interest.  So when someone asked if I wanted to borrow this DVD set, I thought ""Sure, why not!?""

I watched all 24 episodes in 2 days. I was hooked, as soon as one episode ended, I wanted to watch the next one.  2 1/2 hours later I realized I had finished the first disc...  The performances of John C. McGinley and Neil Flynn steal the show.  The cast, in general, is great, and the writing is spectacular.  By far, this is my favorite show on the air right now.",1117065600,8,664,4.10077519379845
1524665,5,B00005JNEQ,"I really wish that I had gotten into this show years ago.  I didn't even see an episode until I bought this set, which came out just after the end of the fourth season.  Yes, I try not to do ""blind buys"", but this set came very highly reccomended, and I really enjoy the other material by Zach Braff and Bill Lawrence.

The show centers around Dr. John ""J.D."" Dorian (Braff), a medical intern at Sacred Heart Hospital, which is probably one of the craziest hospitals on Earth.  Along with his best friend Chris Turk (Donald Faison), a surgical intern, and Elliot Reid (Sarah Chalke), another medical intern, J.D. tries to make it through the days while having to deal with bizarre patients, nasty superiors, and an insane janitor (Neil Flynn) who can't seem to leave J.D. alone.

Other cast-members include Nurse Carla Espinosa (Judy Reyes), who begins a relationship with Turk, Todd Quinlan (Robert Maschio), another surgical intern who becomes a friend of Turk's, and Ted the Lawyer (Sam Lloyd), a pathetic man who is constantly afraid of malpractice suits.  Then there are the doctors.  Dr. Perry Cox (John C. McGinley) is a self-hating cynic who, while appearing to be mean to J.D. and the other interns, really only wants them to succeed, and all of his criticism is (fairly) constructive.  On the other hand is the evil Dr. Bob Kelso (Ken Jenkins).  Kelso is a man who cares more about the money than the patients (as opposed to Cox, who hates the fact that medicine is now a ""business""), and he looks for things that the interns do to criticize.

This show has a very wacky kind of humor; utilizing sound effects, cutaways, and metaphors for jokes, almost anything is fair game.  It may take a few minutes to get used to, but this is definitely one of the funniest shows that I've ever seen.  The show makes good use of metaphors; sometimes when a character is speaking metaphorically, we see a cutaway scene showing the metaphor literally (like when J.D. compared the hospital to high school- medical interns are the geeks, surgical interns are the jocks, and nurses are the cheerleaders).  Other times, when a character is speaking literally, we see a metaphorical cut scene.

When I first heard about this show, I was unsure as to how the writers could successfully pull off a comedic medical show.  I mean, there is a lot to make fun of, but things can easily be carried too far, especially when dealing with death.  Fortunately, the writers and actors know when to switch from being comedic to being dramatic, and it gives the show a sense of dignity that many other shows do not have.

In the extras department, we get some pretty good stuff.  Deleted scenes that are actually funny (I like the one involving two patients who are mentally insane, and believe themselves to be Jesus and Satan), good outtakes, alternate line readings, and audio commentaries.

In conclusion, this is a great boxed set.  It is a definite must-own for Scrubs fans, and is worth checking out for someone who's never seen the show.",1116979200,10,3022,4.7091254752851714
1524666,5,B00005JNEQ,"I became a fan of Scrubs halfway through the first season. The show is amazing. Everything is beautifully acted, written, and directed. It's not only a show about people learning to be doctors but also about coming of age. There are episodes where I am laughing so hard I'm crying and even a couple where I'm crying because I'm just plain touched.",1116633600,7,347,4.612903225806452
1524667,5,B00005JNEQ,"If you missed out on the first season of Scrubs or if you're a devout fan such as myself, you should get this DVD. Scrubs is an underappreciated show, despite critical praise, and it's an affront to talent, vision, wit and humor that wastes such as American Idol and Two and a Half Men beat it in the Nielsens (Never mind Grey's Anatomy which basically ripped off the format and upped the drama).

I have a theory why: Scrubs is too smart and too touching; people can't handle it. I think it's the closest this generation has come to M*A*S*H* (and in my personal opinion, Scrubs surpasses that legendary show). Scrubs is able to juggle comedy of all kinds: slapstick, nonsense, parody, running jokes, sexual, racial and visual while balancing complex and thoughtful storylines. The characters develop and age over time; story arcs can take weeks to play out. This is less true in the first season, but you can see the seeds being planted. Never mind that plots can hit like a hammer blow: when guest star Brendan Fraser's character is mistakenly(?) diagnosed with leukemia, it is not dealt with in a cutesy jokey way; the characters tackle it head-on over two episodes, and we see complex and intricate developments that sitcoms and reality shows can't handle.

In fact, I would argue that this show depicts reality better than those shows. When Turk (Donald Faison) becomes worried about his appearance, he sacrifices everything to lose weight, including spending time with his girlfriend, Carla (Judy Reyes), who he's trying to please by getting in shape. . You have J.D. (Zach Braff) who desperately wants validation and acceptance from his mentor, Dr. Cox (John C. McGinley), but the Doctor constantly belittles J.D., who just returns for more (according to the commentary, this scenario also played out in real life between veteran actor McGinley and the younger Braff). Or when all the interns show up for the first day, the fear and awkardness is paralyzing for them, but eventually they come around to have confidence and find their place, although it takes several episodes. These are things everyone goes through in some fashion, and the actors pull it off smashingly.

Of course, the comedy is what makes the show flow. The actors are allowed to improvize and riff, and the free-flowing and natural lines reflect that -- this also makes for stellar deleted scenes and outtakes. Dr. Cox's rants are priceless; Turk and J.D.'s exploration of racial humor jokes deconstructs the nature of political correctness and stereotypes (J.D.:I have a question. Many of today's popular hip-hop artists use strong racial language in their songs ... the ""n-word."" Now, knowing that under any other circumstances I would never use the word, If I'm singing along with a rap song, and they say it, am I allowed to-- Turk: No.). Zach Braff is able to pull off some fantastic physical comedy, as when Brendan Fraser spins him around, J.D. squeals in glee, then tumbles into a pile of children's blocks. The Todd (Robert Maschio) cannot see women beyond their sexual body parts, and he is so obnoxious and over the top, you can't help but laugh. And there's the menacing Janitor (Neil Flynn), who's sole objective is to torment J.D. (""You look unhapppy. I like that."").

THe Todd and Janitor are just one of several side characters who give the show flavor and flair. They're not just joke props for the main players as might be found in most sitcoms, but rather are given some of the top material; they're also developed, with unique personalities that play out further in later seasons. You have Doug, the perpetually nervous and bumbling intern; Ted, the broken-spirited hospital lawyer; LaVerne, the powerful, independent nurse whom everyone seems afraid of, including the caustic Chief of Medicine Dr. Kelso (also a devilish delight). It almost echoes The Simpsons in terms of a supporting cast.

I could go on for pages lauding Scrubs. It's a refreshing blast of intelligence, heart and humor in an entertainment wasteland. I can no longer watch sitcoms; they seem trite and played-out (save for a very few, such as Frasier and Seinfeld). I hope that people will come around and discover the magic of this show. The first season's DVD release is the perfect way to do so. Buy this: your life will be better for it (except for all the summer days you'll lose staying inside and watching it).",1116633600,18,4386,4.881879194630873

The cast is great at coming up with alternate lines in the show.  The first season is really well written with great doctor/patient and doctor/doctor relationships.  If you've never seen Scrubs, watch it once and you'll be hooked!  This is a must have for the true Scrubs fan.",1116547200,3,395,4.507042253521127
1524669,5,B00005JNEQ,"I was a latecomer to Scrubs, having only started catching it in Season 3. Since then, I have not miss a single episode. I have always been curious as to how JD, Elliot, and Turk got started at Sacred Heart, and whether Dr Cox and Dr Kelso have always been a couple of taskmasters from the beginning. The first season DVD answered a lot of those questions. There are scenes that are worth watching over. This set is the perfect thing to put into your DVD player on a rainy day.

NBC recently announced that Scrubs will return for a fifth season, but beyond that is anyone's guess. It is well-known that despite that this show is well received by fans and critics alike, NBC is doing very little to promote the show. The reason is that Scrubs is produced by Disney, and GE/NBC will not profit from the show when it goes into syndication or from DVD sales.",1116547200,2,853,4.364779874213837

I happen to find it by mistake behind another movie and I was so suprised I bought it right away. I don't know why this show doesn't get attention olike other shows when its funnier and better written and the actors are amazing. Its like intelligent television is slowly disapearing and geting replaced by mindless reality TV. I think its a great show and deserves a better following than it has been getting. Its funny and the writing is amamzing. It reminds me of sports night and west wing writting but with a lot more tongue and cheek humor. This is a ""most"" for anyone not wanting to lose brain cells while also being entertained.",1116460800,,793,4.475862068965517
1524671,5,B00005JNEQ,"I think the reason that this show is ""cultish"" is also one of the reasons it's so great. Three words: No laugh track. Along with ""Arrested Development,"" which is similarly lacking in canned laughter, ""Scrubs"" let's it's jokes find you instead of having the ""audience"" react with guffaws to signal ""That was funny! Laugh now!""

Other reasons why the show is fabulous: The writing is spectacular. Black humor and sentimentality exist together (just like life), and it works. The fantasy sequences are generally great and often spectacular. The actors are not afraid to make fools of themselves in the name of comedy. And Zach Braff is so incredibly goofy and disarming as lead character JD that you can't help but like him. One of the best episodes of season 1 has John Ritter (*sniff*) playing JDs dad. The episode is crude, silly, tragic, and warm all at the same time. It's an amazing half hour.

I haven't watched the DVDs yet, so I can't speak to the extras, but if you're new to the show (lucky you!!!) I would say the episodes along are worth the price. Enjoy!",1116460800,2,1065,4.659574468085107
1524672,4,B00005JNEQ,"Scrubs is a medical comedy about a group of new interns who are adjusting to the demands of working on the front lines of a busy hospital. There's J.D. (Braff), the idealistic one who also narrates the show, Turk (Faison), the cocky surgical intern and Elliot (Chalke), the goofy ditz whom J.D. has is attracted to, while Turk is drawn to Carla (Reyes), a sarcastic nurse. In his day-to-day routine, J.D. has to deal with the tough and demanding Dr. Cox (McGinley), the gleefully pompous Dr. Kelso (Jenkins) and a mean janitor (Flynn) who delights in tormenting the young intern.

The show has an engaging zany sense of humour reminiscent of early Zucker Abrams and Zucker movies (Airplane!, Top Secret), complete with snappy dialogue and visualizing what J.D. imagines in any given situation. For example, in a moment of complete exasperation and frustration J.D.'s head quite literally explodes. Or, to illustrate the competitive nature with Elliot, we see the two race down a hallway like something out of track and field meet complete with Cheap Trick blasting away on the soundtrack.

The first disc starts off with ""Newbies,"" a featurette where the show's creator, Bill Lawrence talks briefly about how he created Scrubs and incorporated real stories from friends who were doctors. The writers talk about how a season and an episode are constructed. The writers work closely with the actors and play to their strengths. The cast talk about their roles with input from Lawrence.

There is an audio commentary on ""My First Day"" by Bill Lawrence. Like Arrested Development, Scrubs is a sitcom that only uses one camera which made the network nervous. He touches upon the evolution of the characters and offers some good observations.

Lawrence returns on the commentary for ""My Old Lady"" with Zach Braff along for the ride. They joke around in this light and engaging track.

Lawrence and actor Neil Flynn provide commentary on ""My Fifteen Minutes."" Flynn dispels the myth that he adlibs all of his lines and they talk about the colourful extras and reoccurring supporting cast that appear in this episode.

The second DVD features a music video for the show's jaunty theme song, ""Superman"" by Lazlo Bane in its entirety with behind-the-scenes clips of the show mixed with footage of the band performing.

""The Doctor is In"" is a brief featurette with Braff talking about he got on the show despite an awful audition. Braff talks about meeting the rest of the cast and his impressions of them in this entertaining extra.

""Alternate Lines: A Second Opinion"" is a nine minute reel of different takes from various scenes by Flynn, Braff and the very funny John C. McGinley.

Also included is an audio commentary on ""My Blind Date"" by Lawrence and Braff once again. They comment on the performances of the supporting cast and talk about the network's insistence that J.D.'s girlfriend in the episode had to be beautiful.

The third disc features ""Not Just Another Medical Show,"" a featurette that examines how Lawrence wanted to avoid shooting in a studio in favour of on location in a converted, run-down hospital. The show's technical advisors talk about how they try to keep the show's medical jargon and situations authentic.

""Favorite Moments"" sees the cast and crew recounting their cherished bits from the show. They talk about how it also deals with real issues in between comedic set pieces and the guest stars that graced the first season.

There is also a four minute ""Outtakes Reel,"" a montage of blown lines and goofy takes that give a little insight into how much fun the cast and crew must have working on the show.

Also included is ten minutes worth of deleted scenes. Sadly, they aren't put in any context so it's hard to figure out what episode they're from. However, there are some really funny bits and it's a shame that they were cut.

There is an audio commentary on ""My Sacrificial Clam"" by Lawrence and actors Sam Lloyd and Robert Maschio. Not surprisingly, the actors talk about their characters and laugh along with the episode. Maschio provides a lot of the humour on this amusing track.

Finally, there is a commentary for ""My Hero"" by Lawrence and John C. McGinley. This episode shows Dr. Cox's vulnerable side and fleshes out his character. Contrary to his on-screen persona, McGinley is pretty low-key on this solid track.",1116374400,30,4355,4.898097826086956

1524725,5,B00005JNEQ,"This is a show that grows on you.  When it first came out, I thought it would be another throw-away show that didn't last a half a season.  There were plenty of medical dramas and there had been some attempts at medical humor that had failed miserably among the few gems.

Scrubs is different than most shows that are on TV.  It is a sitcom without a laugh track.  It is quirky but not to excess.  There are oddball characters that you can care about and laugh at.  It has its schmaltzy moments but they rarely go over the edge.  Just enough to hit the right emotional buttons at the right time.  The humor ranges from very intelligent to juvenile but it is a good mix for everyone and, ultimately, it all seems intelligent in the end because of that balance.

Besides the writing, one of the best things about this show is the casting.  The regulars were mostly unknowns with some character actors that you might recognize from other roles (but maybe not because they are great at becoming the character, like Dr. Cox, also seen in Office Space as one of the Bobs).  And the guest star casting is inspired, if not genius, 99% of the time.

As always, not everyone will like a show and Scrubs is no different.  The first season involves a little time for the series to get its legs but it does so quickly so early episodes are up-to-speed and not as klunky as in other series.  You'll notice this when you compare then to the later seasons.  Another thing you'll notice is that the ""riskier"" concept shows come in later but that isn't unusual.

Overall, a great show and worth a shot if you haven't seen it before.  Give it a chance because you don't see stuff like this very often.  I hope the extras on the DVD help add to this show.  My guess is they will.

Quite simply, intelligent humor that requires virtually instantaneous recognition by the viewer is a very tough sell these days. With the highest rated shows featuring 20 minutes of Paris and Nicole milking a cow or twin ex-Playboy models barfing up lizard stew, it's no wonder SCRUBS has only reached a cult following--think of mixing 80's classic Parker Lewis Can't Lose with an early E.R. backdrop.  The show moves so fast and is so witty, there is only a select % of the viewing population who can follow--sorry, I don't mean to sound elitist.

  The brilliance in SCRUBS is that it will take you from sidesplitting hilarity to a somber, lesson-learning resolution with style and charisma due, in large part, to the amazingly talented writers and actors.

Did I mention that it's laugh out loud funny? But it's also a comedy with a lot of heart and wonderful observations about the human condition, that being that yeah we're screwed up but we are trying to do better. As the new docs interning at a large metropolitan hospital these guys have to deal with politics of the hospital the needs of the patients, the egos of the older doctors and staff as well as their own struggles as individuals in a cookie cutter society. Trying to achieve a workable compromise is no easy job and the mistakes can be both funny and tragic. The balance that's made with this series is that it is a serious subject with a manic core. It's a comedy about what's most feared and hoped. We fear the illnesses and injuries that send us to hospitals but hope the doctors are good enough to fix the problems troubling our bodies and assure us that our fears are under control. Of course that would be too easy. Somehow this  realization that we are mortal and that doctors are human is a great opportunity for laughs.

Against my better judgement, I started to chuckle.  By the end of the show I was laughing so loud my wife came into the room to find out what I was watching.  Now I tape the shows because I am laughing so hard I usually miss the next joke and have to rewind.  A very good reason to get this on DVD.

I missed much of the first season, but fell in love with it during the second and the following seasons.  After seeing so many crappy sitcoms on network television, I look forward to plopping in front on the TV on Tuesdays and knowing I'm going to get a good laugh.  This show is so smart and thoughtful.  The characters are well-developed and it doesn't condescend to its audience.  If only the execs at NBC would quit trying to tank the show.  It so rightly deserved its place on must-see Thursdays last season.  It could have been the next ""Friends"" or ""Seinfeld"".  Instead, NBC switched it to make room for poor reality TV.  I have made it a mission to get anyone I know who hasn't seen this quirky, intelligent comedy to watch.  This program and ""Arrested Development"" are the last hope for smart and sharp TV comedy.",1114473600,4,903,4.451219512195122
1524775,5,B00005JNEQ,"As a graduating resident physician, I must say that this show really captures what it's like to go through residency.  And many of my colleagues agree that for being as strange and silly as it is, _Scrubs_ is in many ways the most realistic show about medicine that we have ever seen.

Aside from our perspective, this program is utterly hilarious.  The characters are all well-developed, and all of them have the opportunity to shine.  The chemistry between the actors/characters is quite obviously there, and you will easily become drawn into the stories.

Even after four years, the poignant, somewhat didactic wrap-ups to each episode have gotten neither old nor trite.  I always catch myself smiling and nodding at the end of each episode.

1524777,5,B00005JNEQ,"As you can see by all the reviews this is a fantastic show and I could go on forever about it. NBC has a gem here that they have failed to truly recognize. Yes it is true that it has been jerked around the schedule, but at least it has made it to season 4.

The last sit-com I remember with this kind of consistent quality in story and laughs was a litte darling of the critics that lasted all of 2 seasons. It was called SPORTS NIGHT (developed by the same guy who wrote WEST WING) and if you never saw it,well that comes as no suprise. The reason I reference SPORTS NIGHT is because I see A LOT of similarities in that show and SCRUBS. The humor is sharp, fast paced and never set up so poorly that you see the joke long before it arrives. More importantly the characters are so well acted in both shows that you feel you know these people. Both shows also offer great humanistic messages in their more serious moments and without the feeling that someone just delivered a sermon and you have to choke it down.

If you are by chance reading this and have never seen SCRUBS and you enjoy smart comedy about the foibles of being human and the fun and pain of human interaction, then look no further for this is one amazing show. And if you ARE a fan of SCRUBS and have never seen SPORTS NIGHT? Let me give you my whole hearted endorsement of that show. You can buy the complete season in one box set (like I said it only lasted 2 seasons)

If NBC wants to return to it's glory days it needs to put more shows like SCRUBS on. Not Clones or RIP OFFS but simply better television with well written stories and well acted characters. HERE'S HOPING FOR A FIFTH SEASON OF SCRUBS",1113868800,6,1672,4.186335403726708
1524778,5,B00005JNEQ,"The beauty of this show is that the laughs come so quickly and unexpected - it's not setup>punchline, setup>punchline, setup>punchline like 98% of the so-called situation comedies on TV today. The writers are outstanding and the actors are masters at delivery. The comedy is fast and furious and the laughs are not anticipated 2 minutes in advance. Look at The Simpsons - impeccable writing, impeccable timing. Look at All In The Family where Sammy Davis Jr. kisses Archie Bunker - isn't that still the longest recorded laugh in television history?

Finally - after years of begging and pleading the show is coming to DVD. THANK YOU. The characterizations are brilliant- J.D. is insecure and in charge - how many of us are in that same position in our daily lives? Dr. Cox is a demon with a heart of gold. His rants put me on the floor gasping for breath (I'm not exaggerating). I want to replay them over and over and memorize them the way I memorized every Bill Cosby record in 1965. All of the charaters are wonderfully written and all of the actors are... well... bloody great actors. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Keep'em flying!",1113868800,5,1137,4.71356783919598
1524779,5,B00005JNEQ,"My mother watched one episode of Scrubs with me because I praised it and suggested that she try it out.  She absolutely hated it.  She said that it was unrealistic and ridiculous.  While I think that Scrubs is BY FAR the funniest comedy to ever bless the wasteland of entertainment we call TV, I'm not suprised that she hated it.  Scrubs is outrageous and quirky and, at times, ridiculous.  For a viewer who doesn't want to look past the initial presentation, the show would most likely be unbearable.

For me, Scrubs is so much more.  There's a complexity to the show that is so easily missed.  So many viewers want simplicity...instant laughs and easily discernible jokes.  Scrubs provides an ample supply of those, but its greatest success lay in its amplification of human foibles and idiosyncracies.  Viewers likely will be treated with manifestations of a character's conciousness or multi-layered dialogues.  What fascinates me most about this show is the way it gives life to the things that make us most uncomfortable, the littlest things that often cause the biggest problems.  Scrubs analyzes, dissects, disarms and then celebrates what we often find as debilitating, embarrasing or ridiculous.

For me, Scrubs is an ideal of comedy and an ideal of life.  I hope that I get my weekly half-hour dose for many more years.",1113264000,11,1330,4.9324324324324325

JD does everything by the book but feels he always needs advice from Dr Cox whether it be about medical or his personal life, even through Dr. Cox couldn't give a tiny rats ass. Turk a surgical intern who likes to be the best at everything whether it be eating a steak the quickest or walking round with his trousers around his ankles to see who pulls them up the quickest him or JD to being the best at surgery. Elliot Reed also an intern with self confidence issues because of her parents wanting her to be the best at everything from the way she does her job to the way she looks, also one of JD's girlfriends (or ex girlfriends) but the one he can't forget about no matter who he's with. Carla is one of the nurses, that falls in love with Turk a Spanish beauty who likes to boss people about but in a loving funny way, but doesn't like it being done to her. She is always there to offer advice to any of the interns and is always supportive and encouraging whether it to be about their medical or personal lives.

There are many other fantastic characters Dr. Cox who has an on off relationship with his domineering ex wife who happens to be on the medical board of trustees, likes to make Dr Cox's life hell but likes to be in control over his sex life whether he sleeps with her or not. He also has issues with Bob Kellso fellow Dr. because he thinks that the hospital has become just about the business and not the patients, which is where they disagree as Dr Kellso is all for the hospital being about just the business.

Dr Bob Kellso who only cares about the money side of the business, if a patient doesn't have medical insurance then out they go to a different hospital, he disagrees with Dr. Cox over this aspect on numerous occasions which has lead to Dr Cox punching him and making his nose squeak to constantly shouting at the interns about not killing any one as he doesn't want a law suit on his hands.

There are many other weird and wonderful characters that make this a must see show highly recommended especially if you need cheering up before you go into hospital.",1109203200,6,2326,4.330275229357798

John C McGinley (sp?) is fantastic as Dr. Cox (especially in his rants) and Z. Braff is simply believable as JD which allows you to both really like him and be disappointed when he screws up (which is often). How they've handled the JD/Elliot love thing is good as well as it's not the typical ""will they, won't they?"" scenario (though I can't discount it being an issue in future seasons). Good writing, and if you notice these things, the soundtract is fantastic as well.

My Mentor

My Best Friend's Mistake

My Old Lady

My Own Personal Jesus

My Blind Date

My Drug Buddy

My Bed Banter and Beyond

My Heavy Meddle

My Tuscaloosa Heart

My Old Man

My Sacrificial Clam

My Occurence

My Hero

My Last Day

Personal favorites of mine would be the two-parter My Occruence and My Hero, guest starring Brenden Fraser, My Old Man, guest starring the late John Ritter, and My Fifteen Minutes, which has in my opinion the funniest moment in the first season, which involves the theme from Sanford and Son.

It's pretty much made for all ages, there may be a few pg-13 moments for the kiddies but they can shut their eyes, content like that usually only lasts a couple seconds.  The show is PACKED with comedy, every single scene is hilarious.  Zack Braff has an amazing mind for this kind of off-the-wall type stuff.  It sometimes may remind you of Family Guy because of the flashbacks and how they take each joke way farther than any other show would dare. Sorry i don't use paragraphs..ok now i do.

The show takes place in a hospital, sort of a satire on ""ER"" type shows.  You can expect to see alot of celebraty guest stars, I don't know why, maybe they like the show or something, hey it's free cash, well, not exactly free, they have to ""ACT,"" whatever that means. It's got very well-built characters, and plot development that lasts the whole lifetime of the show, sort of like soap opera shows.  Things that happen in one episode stay that way and don't get ""reset"" so-to-speak, after each episode ends.  It's mainly stuff that happens with main characters, obviously. Ok i'm wasting your time, lets end this thing. I'm drunk.

Yeah dudes, rad, its cheap, its great and i can't wait for season two. Also, if you haven't seen Zack Braff's movie ""GARDEN STATE"" go for it, I like birds. later taters.

No show has so managed to consistently keep me in stitches since M*A*S*H, and Scrubs manages to surpass that particular milestone, making up the places where its spiritual ancestor (again referencing M*A*S*H) failed, such as a plot line that continues beyond one show, running gags that fail to dull their luster in time, and characters that grow and aren't forced to rely on the same sight gags time and again. Zach Braff's Dr. J.D. Dorien, and his incessant internal narration of his own life as a hospital intern and eventual ""co-chief resident"", provide the foundation of what is the best sitcom on network television today.

The character development is nothing short of excellent, witch each character containing both positive traits as well as human flaws; these characters seem like they cound easily be modeled after real people, and their individual personalities connect to ones in real life.

Additionally, the casting is great. I don't think that anyone knew that Zach Braff would be as good as he has been, but the supporting characters such as the Janitor, Dr. Cox, Dr. Kelso and even Todd, Laverne and Ted make this story excellent.

Obviously the writing is witty and funny, but the absolute BEST and MOST INNOVATIVE thing about this show is that it is a comedy set in a hospital. Hospitals tend to be very sad places...and with good reason. Yet, this show manages to take the lives of health care workers and use medicine in a humorous and uplifting light. It is definately an interesting spin and setting for a comedy show. And it works.

Overall, this show is just spectacular. It is one of the few gems on TV that I will actually watch on a consistant basis, just because it is simply that good. Maybe you won't particularly care for it...but I'm sure that many people you know would absolutely love this show. I mean, just look at all the other raving reviews - they're there for a reason.

I found that I pick up on (and probably miss a few) offbeat cracks that are perfectly timed.  Secondly, the characters are all unique and have their own idiosyncracies that make them appealing.  The producers do a good job of not boxing them in to a particular stereotype.  Third, and one of the biggest reasons I love watching scrubs, is that having gone through residency, I find that the show, on many levels, parallels what we go through.  While some people may laugh at the absurdity of some of the scenes, you'd be surprised at how close to the truth these scenes are!

Hurry up and bring it to the consumers!!!!!",1100044800,6,566,4.252336448598131
1524947,5,B00005JNEQ,"..then this downright brilliant show would get them, period. I've known great TV shows before, sure I have. Shows like The Cosby Show, A Different World, Friends, Everybody Loves Raymond, Martin, Living Single, The Simpsons, Futurama, and Family Guy...and now, here's Scrubs. I am one of the fortunate few who caught this show in its first season, albeit a little late in the game. Luckily, I've been able to catch up on the older episodes by way of reruns, but for all those who weren't hip to it at the very beginning, I say DVD release. The show is simply brilliant, damn near perfect, from the witty and everyday dialogue to the laugh out loud moments of flighty fantasy to the deft ability of the show's writers, producers and actors to suddenly go from screwball antics and clever moments of sheer comedy to philosophy fueled moments of deep thought and genuine poignancy. The actors all seem to have been made for their parts, they fit in that well. The main characters (actors) seem to have an ability to bring viewers into their worlds at the drop of a dime. I love them all, they way they relate and interact with one another. The evil Kelso. The sarcastic Cox. The lucky geek, J.D. The cool, although a bit insecure, Turk. The beautiful and obsessive Carla. The smart and needy Elliot. The damned brilliant Janitor. Smartass Laverne the Nurse. The heartless sex-hound doctor, Todd. The barbershop quintet that Kelso's needy and heartbroken lawyer sings in. Every character has his or her own unique story to tell...through comedy, heartbreak, philosophy, and seriousness. This is one of the absolute best shows to hit television in a long, long time. The idea is unique, the acting is superb, and the writing is dead on. And, to top all that off, the cast is multiracial and multifaceted. As a young black man in a country where predominantly all white casts or all white black casts (the latter of which are usually canceled before they can hit their stride) dominate the airwaves, how can I not love this show?

1524948,5,B00005JNEQ,"I can't wait for Scrubs to come out on DVD.  My husband and I absolutely love this show!  It is the only one that we watch every week without fail.  The cast is awesome, and the story lines are hilarious!  I am also looking forward to mass-produced Rowdy dogs to keep in my home.  Sure would be a lot cleaner than my pets now!",1097539200,5,326,4.03125

McGinley is my favorite actor.  his role in Scrubs is awesome, as is the entire sitcom... this from a guy that HATES most sitcoms.  every week, I go to the Best Buy and look between Saved by the Bell and SCTV for Scrubs, but it's never there... release the poo out of it!  even one season will be sufficient!",1097452800,3,464,4.133333333333334
1524950,5,B00005JNEQ,This has been the funniest show to come out in a long time. Any show that short that covers so much is the all time great in my book. The studio would stupid not to release it.,1097020800,4,176,3.7837837837837838
1525021,5,B00005JNEQ,"Man back in 2001 when they had the previews for this I thought it would last 2 days. The previews were terrible and had no indication of how good the show was. Then finally about two weeks before the show the previews looked good and I checked out the show. I thought it was the second best knew show that year(Inside Schwartz).All the Charectors were cool. JD the young geeky Docter is pretty good actor. Dr. Cox the man that cuts down everyone and the Janitor the man that literally cut them down are funny. Turk the Black guy is cool, carla his wife is pretty bossy. Elliot the love interest of JD was spoiled. DR Kelso was the head guy who was from the 70s period and Todd loved to harass the girls. I hope the 4th season will be better then the third. Scrubs is a great show and deserves some credit",1095292800,2,804,4.2272727272727275
1525022,5,B00005JNEQ,"There are whole websites discussing why this show hasn't been released on DVD yet. My thoughts to the network are, if you don't release the DVD's, all of the people talking about it can't buy them! Take advantage of the hype, you may find that people lose interest by waiting. I would buy all of the DVD's right now, as would many of my friends. After all, you already have all of the footage - it can't take that long!",1095033600,6,419,4.25
1525023,5,B00005JNEQ,"Come on, release the DVD already!!!  I'm tired of watching poor quality episodes of the show...It was great from Season 1,and I'm buying it as soon as it's released.

Witty humor is at it's peak, even wittier than my other favorite show Gilmore Girls.

My favorite aspect of this show is how everything happening through the show is a variant of a certain problem that everyone seems to be having together, culminating at the end reflecting how they all have the same problems, and how they resolve/handle it.

Incredible show, funny yet philosophical.",1094774400,5,552,4.903225806451613
1525024,5,B00005JNEQ,"Two summers ago I stumbled upon a summer scrubs marathon. After watching four of the best episodes of season one, I wondered how I could have ever felt complete before discovering the genius that is Scrubs.

JD (John Dorian) lends his sentimental and quirky narration of his life at Sacred Heart hospital, with episodes ranging from the most hilarious and ironic moments to poignant. A great cast and great writing amount to the best undiscoverd show on the air.",1094601600,4,462,4.848101265822785
1525025,5,B00005JNEQ,"I have come across this show accidentaly and have been taken by storm. The first time I've watched it I couldn't stop laughing for an hour. We get mostly reruns of the first two seasons here but even after watching them an uncountable number f times I still laugh every time.

It is a brilliant show in all aspects, the scripts are great, the acting is great, the quircky way it is directed is great. Everything is just extremely well thought of and excuted. They even get most of their medical stuff more or less correct!

It will be sin if this show doesn't get released on DVD!

1525026,5,B00005JNEQ,"In this age of unbelieveable pablum and slit-your-wrists must-miss television, it is unfathomable to me that this phenomenal, well-written, well-acted, and flat-out fantastic television show has been so badly used by NBC, and that they're uncertain about releasing it on DVD.  Just this week I happened on the season premiere of 4th season, hidden away on the schedule at 7:30 SATURDAY night, and this after three seasons of bouncing it around the schedule like an unwanted stray.  It's as though the network wants to kill it, when it could be, if given the chance, every bit as big a success as ""Friends,"" ""Fraiser,"" and ""Will & Grace.""  Yes, it's quirky, but it's a masterpiece of television genius, and deserves better treatment.  I hope to see the early seasons on DVD soon!",1094342400,186,778,4.916030534351145

1525028,5,B00005JNEQ,"Scrubs is, by far, the best show on TV today. The writing is brilliant, the characters are amazing, the acting is top-rate and the story lines are solid and funny. There isn't a character out of place; from The Todd to The Janitor, each is perfect in his/her role. This show offers so much more than any show out there, because it harkens to other pop culture icons and fads. If you're a fan of TV, this show will make fun of---while showing respect to---every thing you've ever watched. Brilliant. Let's hope the studio (Disney, BTW) gets the syndication rights sold soon so the DVD can be under the Christmas tree this year.",1093305600,4,626,4.548672566371682

Now it's being shown at 7 o'clock in the morning. Good scheduling!!!! Meanwhile the evenings are mostly full of dross. As to releasing this brilliant brilliant comedy onto DVD, I've a terrible feeling the reason for the delay has been alluded to by other reviewers. Maybe the powers that be are worried that it's too clever, too bizarre, too untypical, just too good to guarantee a billion sales. Go on, prove me wrong!",1092700800,,551,4.575757575757576
