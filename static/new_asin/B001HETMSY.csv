3630341,1,B001HETMSY,"Not only is this disc not factory pressed, my PS3 won't even recognize it, which can only mean that the data is corrupted. I paid a total of $38 ($16 go for the shipping taxes and delivery charges through Aramex as I live abroad) expecting an interesting experience. I got one alright, it's just not what I had in mind. Avoid this product at all costs.",1235606400,5,352,4.348484848484849

3630343,1,B001HETMSY,"This will be a great disappointment to all Blu-ray enthusiasts! Sound and video (stills only) is so poor, it's even recorded only on a standard recordable Blu-ray media. All of it's series are the same quality, a DISAPPOINTMENT!",1234915200,2,228,5.026315789473684
3630344,1,B001HETMSY,"I discovered upon opening this product that it is a BD-R (recordable blu-ray disc), not a factory pressed disc as it should be. This is not noted anywhere in the listing or on the case. I was doubly disappointed when the disc would not play in either of my players (one year old Sony with updated firmware) and a brand new Panasonic. I thus can't rate the content but as it's on a cheaper recordable medium, I give it one star.",1229385600,7,427,4.283950617283951
8308743,1,B001HETMSY,"Amazon should stop sellers from so blatantly ripping off artists. Jero is now infamous for cobbling together nonsense, homemade, hack job and last but not least illegal bootleg recordings of suspect quality and origin.",1351296000,4,218,5.4411764705882355
8308744,1,B001HETMSY,"The project sounds very interested but how am I going to place an order if I don't have any information of songs. I only hope those are not crappy remixes. Can't anybody come out with something as creative as ""Love"" by The Beatles?",1339459200,3,231,4.395348837209302
8308745,1,B001HETMSY,"I'm a Holst fan, and sorry to say I was quite disappointed with this rendition of The Planets.  First, I should say that from the description, I had no idea I was getting an electronic music synthesized version of The Planets.  I admit that I didn't research it well, but I would have expected it to note that somewhere on the page.  The fact that ""Surround Records International Orchestra"" is listed as the performers made me think this was a real orchestra doing surround recording of the classics.

Listening conditions: I have a 7.1 system in a heavily sound treated room. All speakers are placed within THX specifications, and 6 are identical KEF speakers, with a matched KEF center channel and subwoofer.

Regarding the recording, first impression was that everything sounded muffled and muddy.  Almost as if listening in a bad hall where the reverb is high and not under control.  Very characteristic of artificial reverb applied heavily.  Next I noticed that a lot of the instruments sound very tinny.  All of this was very distracting - I had to strain to hear the details in just about everything.

There were also many issues with the mixing.  Instruments that came in for a measure or two would often be much louder than they should be and would be quite jarring and distracting.  A specific example is right at the beginning of Mars, on the third note (the low sustained ones).  It sounds like a trumpet comes in on that note only, and much louder than it should. It sounded so out of place, that I actually got out my copy of the full score to see what might be going on, and sure enough, there's no trumpet at all there.  Either Mr. Jero added it in, or its something else like a jarring timbre change on only some notes of the horns, which is often a characteristic of poor synthesizer samples.

The poor mixing, overall muddiness, and tinny sound made it very distracting to listen to.  Mars, instead of being terrifying, was just plain annoying.  I listened to all of Mars, and was so disappointed that I then skipped around various other tracks only to find more and more of the same stuff, and eventually just stopped listening.

I've heard some great 7.1 tracks with my setup, like Fantasia 2000 (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fantasia-Fantasia-2000-Four-Disc-Blu-ray-DVD-Combo/dp/B0040QTNSK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fantasia / Fantasia 2000 (Four-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo)</a>).  But on this one, the muddyness and muffledness of the sound completely negates the 7.1 mixing and any hall-like effect - its probably just that way for marketing.  I put in my 2-channel regular CD of The Planets conducted by Walter Susskind right after listening to this, and was amazed by how much better it sounded even though it is a reverb heavy recording (but from a real hall).  So do yourself a favor and if you're looking to get The Planets, get a cheaper regular CD of a well-regarded recording of a real orchestra.",1300320000,5,2966,4.951515151515151
8308746,2,B001HETMSY,"Some of the other reviews stated this will not work in a PS3 and that is not correct. This disc WILL infact work on a PS3 system but the audio sample is downscaled to 6.1 audio (DTS ES) and 48khz. If this does not bother you, then stop reading and buy this disc.

The real question is why does this not play on so many BD players in the native DTS-HD Master Audio codec? I have tried this disc in four players that I have in my home (all fairly new some higher end than others) and it will not work in 3 of them. However, my Samsung BD-C6500 it will work but the audio stutters and it's almost as if the VBR of the disc is lagging the system down? This is the first time I have experienced this issue.

I really want to give this a 4 or a 5 and I really would like to enjoy it but it's just not possible, unless you're willing to accept down-scaled audio. I have tried many settings, just to see if I can get it to work but to no avail. Be weary of this title as I think there has been some quality control issues with the recent batch of these discs made. Personally I feel there is a problem with the codec used, I have other DTS-HD MA 7.1 96khz recordings that work just fine, why is this disc/title plagued with problems?

Hopefully this review will help other potential buyers looking for a good lossless audio escape, which is what this disc is meant to be.",1299715200,,1363,4.0783582089552235
8308747,4,B001HETMSY,"I would really like to give this a 5-star rating but there are some quality control issues. 1) The ""t"" is missing from Holst on the print. There is no index for the 4th movement ( Jupiter ). It is on track 3 with Venus.

These are billed as Blu-Ray discs but they are actually DVDR discs with a DTS-HD MA stream. Nothing wrong with that but those expecting professionally produced discs MIGHT think these are bootleg copies. These fall under the Warner BD-9 proposed standard for audio-only content but NO major replicators actually use it.

The music. I'm giving this a 4.5. The only real issue I had with the presentation was that the brass in ""Mars"" sounded a little harsh and forced. Other than that, the presentation and sound stage was very good and lent itself well to my 7.1 setup. Someone that is not that familiar with the piece will be quite happy with it as long as they have a home theater that is properly set up for 7.1 audio.",1298073600,4,941,4.402298850574713
8308748,1,B001HETMSY,"This disc wouldn't play consistently in a high end Bluray player (with the latest firmware) or a PS3. I don't presume to be an expert on Bluray disc manufacture, but there seems to be something not quite right with this one.

What I could listen to didn't impress me much, either. It was very repetitive, and some strange choices of sounds and sound placement made it overall more annoying than enjoyable.",1294704000,,405,4.704225352112676
8308749,1,B001HETMSY,"Do not buy this.  It does not work.  I tried it in my laptops BluRay drive with Win7 and it did not work,  I tried it in a friends PS3 and it did not work!!",1270771200,,156,3.4
8308750,1,B001HETMSY,Bought it - returned it.  Would not play on either of my Bluray players.,1257897600,3,72,4.142857142857143
8308751,5,B001HETMSY,"this album is absolutely amazing. after 3 weeks of owning it i still put it on nearly every night, to take my imagination places i never thought existed, and to experience strange emotions. i think the reason for this is that the surround sounds on this album are ones you have never heard before.

i agree with another reviewer who said this album is simply 'a traveling through space in a ship of music' and that not many people will 'get' it at first; but keep listening. if i ever need to get away, putting this album on the player fills my head with strong imagery - as i listen to the final track right now, my mind is in a far off place, with a sense of complete isolation. many of the tracks carry this feeling, or that of being helpless, or of having lost someone or something, and not being able to find them. for me, no other album since has offered anything to compete with the sheer visual and dreamlike nature of this one.

you must buy this album! and listen to it alone late at night...",1250985600,,1002,4.268421052631579
8308752,1,B001HETMSY,"ANYONE CONSIDERING PURCHASING THIS DISC I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND NOT!

AT LEAST DONT BUY A USED COPY AS I DID. RECIEVED IT EXPECTING AN INTERESTING EXPERIENCE WITH DTS 7.1 96KHZ SOUND ON MY B&W SET-UP...NOPE! ITS A FREAKIN BURNED COPY AND EVEN WITH MY UP TO DATE SONYBD550 IT WOULD NOT PLAY IN LOSSLESS AUDIO. NOT TO MENTION THAT THE VISUALS ARE A CHEESY SLIDE SHOW OF PICTURES THAT LOOK LIKE THEY BELONG ON NAPOLEON DYNAMITES T-SHIRTS!

I AM SENDING MINE BACK FOR A FULL REFUND!

ALL IM SAYING IS...BEWARE!
DONT BE FOOLED.",1250726400,2,523,4.602150537634409
