3147076,4,B0015RCURS,"The Big Boss(1971) is corny, tacky, low budget and violent, but this kung fu film is solid. Some English dubbed versions are known as Fists of Fury. The bad English dubbing is amusing and it uses stock music from Peter Thomas LP's. The film was re-released in 1981 with an original music score. Lee struggled to get good parts in Hollywood movies and TV shows. Golden Harvest president in Hong Kong Raymond Chow gave Bruce Lee the green light to make an action movie in Thailand with a budget of $100,000. Lo Wei was hired to direct the film. Lee played Cheng Chiu An, a Chinese guy who moves to Thailand to get a job. When his ""friends and family"" vanish, he conducts an investigation and stumbles upon a shocking secret. It's ironic that the main bad guy is also Chinese. There's many scenes from this film that are lost forever. There's a scene where Cheng sleeps with a prostitute. There's another scene where Cheng graphically splits a man's head open with a saw! The censors snipped out this footage after 1971. Maria Yi is quite good as a Chinese girl who has a crush on Cheng. The Big Boss is a low budget grindhouse movie with good editing by Ming Sun. Early 1970's movies had a hard edge. This could explain why The Godfather(1972) and The French Connection(1971) were big hits. Chinese comedian Li Kun is in the film. Guess Who Killed My 12 Lovers(1968) probably gave him more screen time for his brand of comedy. In the 1960's, Bruce Lee was friends with some of Hollywood's A list talent. This film was referenced in Carl Douglas' 1974 hit song Everybody Was Kung Fu Fighting.

For years i watched this on the first lousy edition of the HKL DVD,, so seeing it now in great HD quality is much better. People should be happy it does look this good. The colours and such look strong, except the fake blood, which i think looks like red paint. The close ups looks pretty good. I didn`t notice so much grain and that means it`s evident that they use DNR. Which i think is unnecessary. See DVD/Blu-ray comparison at dvdbeaver.com

Audio Quality: 3.5/5

I think the Cantonese: DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 was a bit disappointing. Yes, most of the music sounds good and alive, but the punch and kick effects should have had more bass. If they had more bass, the punches and kicks would have sounded more powerful. I don`t think they sound so powerfull now. It wouldn`t have hurt the people in charge of this 7.1 remix to have added more bass to the fight scenes.

The dialog at times sounded a bit thin, but i think it was mostly good. The Rear speakers are used a lot for music, but also for other effects like birds, water, dogs barking and so on. I believe my subwoofer was only used for some of the music which had suprisingly good bass.

3147079,1,B0015RCURS,This DVD isn't what everybody has been waiting for. Forget about the 115 minute running time. It is the same old 100 minute version that we've all seen before. To add insult to injury it only has the English dubbed soundtrack. No option for Cantonese or Mandarin with English subtitles. Picture quality is fairly good 16:9 widescreen but otherwise it's a waste of space. I'm thinking that Bonzai are a bootleg company.,1218931200,15,418,4.819444444444445

8259564,4,B0015RCURS,"The Big Boss made an international star of Bruce Lee. Lee stars as Cheng Chao-an, a man from mainland China who moves to Thailand to live with his cousins and work in an ice factory. With great restraint, he avoids trouble because of a promise he made to his mother. Unfortunately, however, Lee has no tolerance for murder and chaos. He uses his stunning fighting ability to deal with local street thugs. The story, the authenticity, and the fighting scenes make this a big hit.
In 1971, The Big Boss rang in as the highest grossing film of all time in Hong Kong.

8259571,4,B0015RCURS,"Not having parlayed his Green Hornet television stint to stardom in the U.S. and stuck in the purgatory of making cameos in Hollywood, Bruce Lee deployed to Hong Kong cinema to try his luck there. 1971's The Big Boss (a.k.a. Fists of Fury) shattered Hong Kong's box offices, the highest grossing film in Hong Kong's history until it was supplanted by Lee's next major release, The Chinese Connection. The Big Boss elevated Bruce to international superstar status and made Golden Harvest head producer Raymond Chow have an oopsie in his pants (but in a good way).

We don't get to know the specifics of why Cheng Chao-an (Lee) had to relocate to Thailand. We strongly suspect it was for inordinate street brawling. In Thailand he moves in with his cousins - including the lovely Chow Mei (Maria Yi) - and lands a job at the ice factory in the southside of town. In Thailand Cheng aims to start fresh, aims to uphold his vow to his mother to keep out of trouble. But Cheng may have to let his mother down when the sadistic foreman just won't let up, and then laborers at the ice factory start to mysteriously vanish, and then his lovely cousin is jeopardized.

The Big Boss is such seminal work, and yet it speaks to how even more iconic his other films are that this one is possibly the least famous in his starring feature films. The Big Boss reset the paradigm with its more realistic approach to martial arts filmmaking. More tellingly, Bruce Lee's undiluted charisma was unleashed to the world, and the world said, ""Whoa!"" Bruce stalks the screen like a coiled tiger, and right away you register the big swagger. But The Big Boss slow burns you to death. The plot unfolds as an extended tease up until the third act. Throughout, Cheng Chao-an's pacifist resolve is severely tested. But whenever you think he's had enough and is about to bust out a can on someone, he instead resorts to a lot of fingering his mom's locket circling his neck. Give Cheng his due, he tried like the dickens to keep that promise.

We learn quickly enough that the ice factory is a front for the local drug cartel, and that the blocks of ice serve as a drug delivery system. Maybe I'm wrong but I swear I read somewhere that The Big Boss was originally intended as a vehicle for co-star James Tien - who plays Bruce's noble cousin Hsu Chien - until studio heads realized what they had in Bruce and went all in on him. Sure enough, early on, it's James Tien who comes off as the protagonist. His Hsu Chien is the one succoring the weak and the bullied. He's the one serving up the thrashings. But when Bruce - in one of those classic delayed gratifications for the audience - at last springs into action, he leaves James Tien, action hero, in the dust. Even for those who'd seen him in Green Hornet (or, as it's billed in Hong Kong, ""The Kato Show""), it must've been an eye-opening revelation to eyeball Bruce Lee in motion. The Big Boss captures the unparalleled grace, the fluidity, the whiplike quickness, and that trademark intensity. There's that peerless show of bravado and that sense of style in how he takes out waves of goons, whether it's a no-look knife toss to take out a baddie sneaking up or punching a henchman so hard he crashes thru a wall and leaves behind a henchman-shaped hole on that wall. Note that Bruce isn't averse to grabbing onto and twisting one's junk to end a fight.

But even when he's not making a thug reevaluate his career as a bruiser, even though he's given minimal dialogue, Lee still has a presence about him. Even when in repose, when he's just sitting or standing there, your eye's drawn to him. He's a likeable leading man, and I like that he doesn't mind occasionally acting goofy (like his boozy time at the brothel or when he and his cousins celebrate an unexpected promotion).

I won't fib, I prefer Enter the Dragon, Way of the Dragon, and The Chinese Connection over The Big Boss. And Bruce's ever escalating duels at the pagoda in Game of Death are easily trump the brand of violence presented in The Big Boss. But even the least interesting of Bruce's scraps in The Big Boss craps on those staged by this film's comtemporaries. Bruce Lee is just that dynamic. So if you're curious about the film that broke him out as an overnight motion picture sensation... if you're down with some groovy 1970's theme music... and you don't mind a few seconds of nudity (remember: brothel)... then catch this movie and see how Bruce Lee forever changed the identity of martial arts and made martial arts accessible to western audiences. From then on, I guess Britt Reid had to do his own driving.",1402876800,,4613,4.553012048192771
8259572,3,B0015RCURS,"Although Bruce Lee had been in movies and television quite a while before this, The Big Boss was really his breakout movie. The martial arts scenes may not be very good and certainly pale in comparison to some of the Shaw productions of that time, but this movie was more of a segue to Lee's later and significantly better films.

There is nothing special about the barely audible dialogue or semi-generic story, but what's more is that there are hardly any Bruce Lee fight scenes for the first 40 mins of the movie. The Big Boss has a raw classic 1970's cinema feel but one of it's biggest problems is that there is no driving force in the movie or interesting or memorable characters outside of Bruce Lee.

Unfortunately the production quality of the film is pretty poor, the special effects are weak and it almost just seems like someone grabbed Bruce Lee, a camera and a couple of other guys with mediocre martial arts abilities then decided to make a movie. The dog dodging scene towards the end relies on very amateur trick photography and at this point is just comical. The films most redeeming quality is the final fight scene where, in his vengeance, Bruce Lee holds nothing back.",1401321600,,1189,4.630331753554502
