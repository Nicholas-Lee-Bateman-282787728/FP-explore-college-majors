8313183,3,B000AEDZV2,"This is yet another film I purchased in my pursuit of all movies that may or may not have tango dance scenes in it. Although this movie has a decent story, don't be misled by the title which contains the word Tango.  There is no Tango, neither dance nor music, in this movie. So if you are a fan of tango like myself and was curious about purchasing this movie based on the title, don't do it!",1243382400,4,393,4.103896103896104
