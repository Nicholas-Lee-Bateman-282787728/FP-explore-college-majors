Plus you get to see clips of some of the greatest fights of all time like Willie Pepp vs Sandy Saddler,Carmine Basillio vs Gene Fulmer,Ray Robinson vs Jake Lamotta and many more. I wish they showed some footage of Bowe vs Holyfield but they only show pictures. Plus for the grande finale you get the Thrilla in Manilla.",1343433600,,492,4.301075268817204

8249882,5,B0013D8LE0,"Glad to finally have this DVD, having enjoyed the show on ESPN Classic some years ago. Brian Kenny serves as moderator to a panel of boxing experts: analyst Al Bernstein, boxing legend Carmen Basilio, trainers Angelo Dundee and Bill Clancy, New York Times writer Dave Anderson, author Pete Hamill, and colorful, cigar-chomping raconteur Bert Sugar. These guys shoot the $#it about some of the Sweet Science's most memorable and historic rivalries. The chit chat runs around four and a half hours but spans decades in terms of material covered. Peppered with rare classic fight footage, documentary pieces, and interview clips, this DVD treats boxing fiends with a familiar cast of dramatis person. The rivalries are discussed in chronological order, with Bert Sugar regaling us with the best behind-the-scene anecdotes. Here are the gents touched on:

Jack Dempsey, the savage-punching Manassa Mauler, was prize fighting's first rock star, drawing extraordinary crowds back in the 1920s. Next to Dempsey, Gene Tunney paled in popularity in the people's eyes. Tunney was an accomplished boxer, but he just wasn't as exciting as Dempsey even though he took the heavyweight title from Dempsey in 1926. Nowadays, Tunney is associated more with the infamous long count incident in their 1927 rematch. Fifteen minutes of fame? More like fifteen seconds.

In terms of relevance on a world stage, what bout tops Joe Louis's rematch with Max Schmeling? Joe Louis engaged in two rivalries, the one with Max Schmeling being more significant socially, racially, politically. Their fisticuffs were regarded as a showdown between American democracy and the Nazi ideology. And much like Jesse Owens, Louis did Adolf wrong. Thing of it is, Max Schmeling was a reluctant player in this politically charged backdrop. All he wanted to be, really, was an honest fighter. He had nothing against Joe Louis or America. In two fights, Louis and Schmeling took turns knocking each other out. But Adolf probably felt the pain more keenly.

Billy Conn was a slick light-heavyweight champ who relinquished his title and moved up to heavy to scrap with Joe Louis. Weighing in at 174 pounds, Conn was outweighed by the 199-pound Joe Louis. Amazingly, Conn was actually on his way to winning the fight on sheer slickness when he got too cocky and got stretched by Louis in the 13th round. And so we get the rematch, in preparation of which Joe Louis was heard to originate that famous saying: ""He can run but he can't hide."" Truer words...

Then there's the brutal trilogy between Rocky Graziano and Tony Zale. The DVD presents their rock 'em, sock 'em third fight, in which you can see Rocky get seriously hurt a grip of times but still keep on trying. For more color on their first two fights, look up Paul Newman's very entertaining bio-flick SOMEBODY UP THERE LIKES ME. Note that Paul Newman is more pleasant on the eyes than Rocky Graziano. But Rocky probably takes a better punch.

It's too bad that footage of featherweight master boxer Willie Pep is so rare. This guy is one of the best defensive fighters the universe had ever seen. That didn't keep him from getting knocked out by the hard-punching Sandy Sadler, which launched their rivalry, comprised of four fights and no end of dirty tactics and grudge holding. I wish the boxing panel had covered this one more. I liked hearing the story about how, in one fight, Willie Pep won a round without throwing a punch, that's how good he was defensively. I'd love to see him, Pernell Whitaker, and Floyd Mayweather, Jr. playing dodgeball.

Adamantium-jawed bully Jake LaMotta and Sugar Ray Robinson's epic sixth and final fight - a.k.a. the ""St. Valentine's Day Massacre"" - is the only one of the six ever captured on film, and the DVD gives that to us. LaMotta won one of those six fights; it's just not this one. While Robinson is widely heralded as the world's best pound-for-pound boxer in history, LaMotta was immortalized in the movie RAGING BULL. Which one do you think Joe on the street recognizes more?

Ezzard Charles and savvy old Jersey Joe Walcott, two underrated pugilists, engaged in four fights, three of which went the full fifteen rounds. The panel discusses them, but not long enough for my taste.

Carmen Basilio sits in on the panel during his own segment as he talks about his rivalries with Tony DeMarco, Ray Robinson, and Gene Fullmer. This segment's highlights - other than having a living legend participating in the studio and telling it like it is - are the clips of the telling latter rounds of Basilio's first fight with Robinson.

Emile Griffith and Benny Paret skirmished three times in the ring, and these guys had no love for each other. Paret's taunts at Griffith's sexual orientation had to have gotten under Griffith's skin, and so, tragedy. In the twelfth round of their final fight, Griffith cornered Paret and took it to him. For the interested ghouls, the closing moments of round 12 is shown as Griffith connected 18 times in 6 seconds while Paret lay defenseless on the ropes. Paret lapsed into a coma and died ten days later, becoming a cautionary figure in boxing's history. Emile Griffith? He'd never be the same after that night.

Ali vs. Frazier is next, and their rivalry is so well-documented there's really nothing left to say.

Lastly, there's fleeting mention (but no fight clips) of the Evander Holyfield / Riddick Bowe trilogy, both of whom were undefeated when they first faced each other.

ESPN: RINGSIDE RIVALRIES has two discs and the following bonus material: the ""Thrilla in Manila"" and the ""St. Valentine's Day Massacre,"" complete and uncut, and also Rocky Graziano briefly discusses the ""St. Valentine's Day Massacre"" and George Gainford (Ray Robinson's manager) promotes Robinson's then upcoming bout with Randy Turpin.",1294444800,2,5810,4.953798767967146
8249883,3,B0013D8LE0,"I was  really looking  forward to this knowing how excellent this series is...and I was disappointed. Most  of the rivalries were decades old and the footage very very poor. I'm not one that thinks  nothing from  before my time is worth anything but I  also remember the Hearns/Hagler ..Hearns/Leonard , and Duran with all of them!  rivalries that are completely overlooked and saved boxing during  a time  when the heavyweights were a snore!

As  I said...not  on a par with their top 10 heavyweights  DVD or even Ringside Ali and Ringside Tyson sets...",1245283200,4,554,4.827956989247312
8249884,2,B0013D8LE0,"The second disc had too much ""high chair"" talk. The hype generated by the Panel for the Ali-Frazier Manila fight was embarrassing.
The fight itself was a non-event. Ali running away and frazier running out of puff. I saw Frazier land two, or possibly three effective punches
for the whole fight. Out of these, there was ONE to the head of Ali.
I wonder if that was in Frazier's contract: Ali will not be punched in his ""beautiful face"" - or there will be penalties to pay!
If anyone has seen any of Frazier's Non-Ali fights, they know he hits the Head Often - and that's how he Knocked his opponents out - really!
The fight was a Farce - as were most of Ali's fights - because he never fought anyone he hadn't ""arranged"" to beat.
Has anyone seen Ali get his face punched about - ever?
ALL genuine fighters, get their faces punched - often!! But not Ali.
His clown acts won him and his Muslim friends a lot of money - but as a fighter of any renown - No, he was just a Pansy!",1233878400,3,974,4.1861702127659575
