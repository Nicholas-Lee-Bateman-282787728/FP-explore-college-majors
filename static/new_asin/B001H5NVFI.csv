it speaks about destiny, about childhood, its dreams and its beauty, its fragility and its strenght. It gives courage and it is very intense, dramatically true",1290384000,,195,4.764705882352941
8307927,5,B001H5NVFI,"I saw this inspirational film on a plane returning from Vietnam.  5 - 10 minutes before the end.  Tom Ridge came on with a Homeland security announcement.  I never got to see the end, since it is unavailable in the U.S.  I believe that it would do well in theatres here if it were released.  It is about a boy who was blinded by an accident.  It is a quirky film about being who you are and going after your dreams and interests regardless of disability or the negativity of others.  It also shows the important effect of teachers in the life of a child, both for good and ill.",1236470400,,577,4.1909090909090905
