5891360,5,B00E5LMYHC,"Embrace the Brutality, is about a bunch of trailblazing hikers going from the New Mexico border with Mexico, north over the Continental Divide Trail, to the Canadian border.  After viewing this movie, one gets a better appreciation of the ruggedness of the Western United States, as these brave souls, armed with backpacks and lightweight tents, go around forest fires, rattlesnakes, cold spring water in streams, and generally look like they are having a great time in doing it.  Set to modern folk music of this era of the second decade of the 21st Century, the Director has captured the flavor of wilderness adventure like no other person could.  It was worth my money to get a copy of this video, and I give it two thumbs up!  The girls in the video aren't bad looking either!",1376006400,2,780,4.713235294117647
5891361,5,B00E5LMYHC,"Purhcased this a week ago, as the backpacking bug has bitten me. This is a great film to watch in order to really understand the daily grind of hiking long distance, as well as the relationships that are formed on the trail with other people, animals,and the landscape. Everything about this film was fantastic. Also purchased the other DVD ""Wizards of the PCT"" about a month ago and equally as impressed. Can't wait for me",1376006400,4,423,4.653333333333333
5891362,5,B00E5LMYHC,The dirt was very realistic and the zombie makeup was 'okay.'  Makes you want to take a shower in a good way.  Excellent countryside and plains footage.  Soundtrack is fantastic.,1376006400,4,178,4.866666666666666
8601434,5,B00E5LMYHC,"This video really stirred my curiosity about thru-hiking. The video is not instructional on thru-hiking but does give an honest and humorous account of Jester's experience on the Continental Divide Trail-the comaraderie of the group, the difficulties of route finding, challenging weather and the race to beat the snowfall. I liked the way he broke the sections up into each State with fun facts and their experience of that state-the lack of water and rough land in New Mexico, the high mountain elevation and rain of Colorado, the remoteness of Wyoming and the back and forth of Montana and Idaho. The music was phenomenal and fit the ""characters"" and locations, the group was fun and interesting and I enjoyed the interviews of people he met, the landscapes and scenery and of course, his pure joy of pizza! I look forward to more videos.",1509580800,,841,4.888111888111888

8601436,5,B00E5LMYHC,This is the only DVD that I have seen covering the Continental Divide trail. Looks of images covering the views from the trail.

8601440,5,B00E5LMYHC,"Best Continental Divide Trail video on the market. If you're looking for something ""instructional"", this probably ain't it, but if you want to know what it's really like out there day-to-day (for the crazy people you'll meet), this is the video for you.  (Men's medium runs a bit small.)",1376265600,3,287,4.857142857142857
