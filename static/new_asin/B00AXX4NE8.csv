8558939,5,B00AXX4NE8,"Stephen Tompkinson  is such a great actor! He plays Danny an English vet who moves to South Africa with his family. This series lasts for 7 seasons before the powers that be ran out of $$. The DVD boxed set is so well done. Such a nice gift to give or to keep for yourself. You MUST however, have a DVD or Blu-ray player that operates all regions. This set WILL NOT work with an ordinary American DVD/Blu-ray player! We purchased our Blu-ray for all regions on Amazon. It will play both American DVDs and any other countries' videos. I can assure you that if you have the correct equipment, this series will have you doing a marathon! So you better start on a Friday night so you have enough time!",1505606400,2,697,4.320610687022901
