4486132,5,B004WCSMDE,"Just like the Holocaust and the suffering the Jewish people endured, I will always watch this documentary dvd so that I never forget what happened to us - the reasons also why this was done to us.  We need to stop getting involved in other countries problems and trying to push our way of life on other peoples.",1381536000,,311,4.362068965517241

4486137,5,B004WCSMDE,"This DVD contains several great documentaries in one collection.  Uncut, good quality.  For the price, it's probably one of the best compilations out there.  Particularly interesting is Hotel Ground Zero, about the less talked-about Marriott Hotel which sat between the twin towers and those that were inside.  We thought this DVD was very informative and interesting.",1350172800,9,368,5.517857142857143
4486138,5,B004WCSMDE,Everyone remembers where they were when Kennedy was shot and they remember where they were on 9/11 ... but time goes by and details start to fade and we need to remember,1334188800,3,169,4.3125
4486139,3,B004WCSMDE,"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/September-11th-Memorial-Edition/dp/B004WCSMDE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">September 11th: Memorial Edition</a>I have a lot of mixed feelings on this movie. I'm not real sure I'd recommend this film to a friend. Why? In my case, the movie had 2 DVD's and the first worked great. The ""day in the life"" of people all over New York are captured on film by various sources. There's no ""script"". It's pure terror, as seen on the faces of the people.

Since the 2nd DVD in the case was defective, I have no clue if it's worthy of a review. The first DVD showing the film of that day is eerie and graphic. It is truly fascinating but I would've preferred hearing more from the victims who were fleeing but most of it was noise, background noise and oftentimes ""muffled"" conversations.",1332374400,7,845,5.353383458646617
4486140,5,B004WCSMDE,"History's September 11th Memorial Edition contains several powerful and well-made documentaries--particularly 102 Minutes That Changed America, which may be the finest film yet made about that horrible day. And yet the original question still remains: why would we want to subject ourselves to them? After careful consideration, the answer may be in the visceral way that 102 Minutes affects its viewers--it is so harrowing to watch that it shakes us up, which may be exactly what we need at this point, not out of some lip service loyalty to the notion of ""never forget"", but out of a necessity to simply feel something that is recognizable and human, and thus separated from slogans and politics and fear-mongering and war and xenophobia and hate and paranoia and conspiracy theories and ""truth."" Too often in the past decade, we have allowed September 11th to become an abstraction. In the best of these films, it is anything but--it is real, and present, and terrifying.",1321142400,9,974,5.055900621118012
4486141,5,B004WCSMDE,"I ordered this not knowing what to expect.  It's absolutely riveting, not so much because the horror of 9/11 was pretty compelling in and of itself, but because it is all first person eyewitness accounts of the day.  There are no news reporters (except those who are roaming around like everyone else trying to figure out what the hell is going on), no experts, no blowhards.  There are simply people on the street and in their apartments witnessing the most horrific event of their lives.  It is hands-down the most nail-biting documentary on 9/11 I've seen, and I've seen a few!  Witness the event through the eyes of these damaged souls for yourself.  But I warn you that some of it is difficult to take.",1317168000,27,707,4.616

4486144,4,B004WCSMDE,Almost raw video footage.  Great for presenting the event to students.  Let the students make up their minds and experience the event first hand.  Might be excellent if accompanied by a second DVD by Popular Science which explains the mechanical process by which the buildings broke apart.,1424304000,,289,5.1063829787234045

8444873,5,B004WCSMDE,"Sad video, but important to remember this day. I actually sobbed several times, all these years later. As long as I live, I'll never forget the girl yelling ""oh my god!"" as the second plane hit., it is the most terrifying thing I have ever heard. I hope she's ok.

8444875,5,B004WCSMDE,"September 11th Memorial Edition is a 2-DVD set that contains four excellent documentaries about the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. The History Channel produced this set and released it in 2011.

Disc 1 contains the Emmy Award film 102 Minutes that Changed America. This harrowing yet superb documentary melds video clips from various sources and gives a minute-by-minute account of what happened to the World Trade Center (WTC) that day. The film begins seconds after American Airlines 11 strikes the North Tower, and ends shortly after the collapse of the second tower. Video clips come from a wide variety of sources - people in their apartments and offices surrounding the WTC;  people on the street using their cell phone cameras; television news crews; and aerial shots from helicopter TV cameras. There is no narration; all you hear is the reaction of people as they witness the events first-hand. The footage is raw, mostly unedited, and powerfully dramatic.

Disc 2 contains three hour-long documentaries featuring survivors of the WTC attacks. In Hotel Ground Zero, several guests at the World Trade Center Marriott, which was destroyed when the South Tower fell on it, recount their experiences inside the buildings rubble. In  Miracle of Stairway B, several New York Fire Department firefighters talk about how they became trapped inside a small segment of the North Towers stairway B. They recall their struggle to survive, and tell how they were rescued by their fellow firefighters. In The Day the Towers Fell, many of the eyewitnesses who took video clips of the WTC tragedy and its immediate aftermath remember what happened that day.

September 11th Memorial Edition is excellent. The film 102 Minutes that Changed America, is tough to watch but should be seen by everyone. The other three documentaries are perhaps a bit less essential, but nevertheless are riveting and offer a great deal of insight into the horror of that day from the perspective of those who lived through the worst of it.

As we approach the 15th anniversary of  9/11, I think it is important to be reminded of the events of September 11, 2001. September 11th Memorial Edition serves as an excellent, sharply focused, and non-political reminder of what we lost on that day, and how we lost it.  Most highly recommended.",1468281600,,2319,5.052356020942408
8444876,5,B004WCSMDE,"I rate this cause this dvd comes with a 2 disc. The first disc comes with 102 minutes that changed America. And the 2nd disc comes with  Hotel Ground Zero,  the miracle of Stairway B and The Day The Towers Fell. Total running time is 4hrs. 21mins. I checked it out. No problem with the disc.  I would recommend this to family and friends who remembers 9/11.",1444780800,,357,4.298507462686567
8444877,3,B004WCSMDE,"I was a sixth grader at the time of 9/11. I knew the attacks were something big then... but news was like homework to me, something I tried to avoid.

What the makers did here is find about six of the many, I'm sure, people who picked up a camera that day knowing they had the opportunity to focus on SOMETHING other than just running around in horror in New York. The product was a very vivid, personal look at the events that unfolded.

I understand the much resistance to ever put on tape for the public to see what caused the many deaths of many people on 9/11. What I found odd about this video, is that we see no footage of the first plane hitting the first tower, THOUGH a little research reveals it was captured by someone. And the footage we see of the second plane hitting the second tower is quick and blurry at best. In fact, it wasn't until I looked at special features that I found footage that I think SHOULD'VE been in the documentary.

If the makers did it ""out of respect"" for the populace, what the makers failed to do is leave out the part where one person captures many people jumping to their deaths out the window. My point is, is people know what they're buying when they buy a documentary about 9/11. If it aired on TV, put an uncut version on disc.",1444176000,4,1274,4.234567901234568
