Surprisingly informative at basic science and practical level.  Dry sense of humor may go over the heads of some listener/viewers because Dr. Colavita's delivery is pitch perfect - perhaps a bit of David Letterman.",1526860800,,266,5.285714285714286
8242892,5,B0011XOIY4,"This turned out to be far more interesting that I thought it would be.  It's actually one of the best Great Courses I've come across.  It seems like a rather obscure topic, as opposed to say physics, math, grammar... A lot of people might decide to improve their knowledge of those topics and come searching for them.  But I doubt too many people really decide I think I'm going to learn more about sensation and perception and go looking for it.  And those that do come across it probably have little idea of what to expect from such a course as opposed to math or physics, myself included.  It barely caught my attention but I decided ""Ah what the heck, it's cheap.""

So what is this about.  While it does go over some anatomy of the different sensory organs and systems, it's just enough to have some working vocabulary to discuss the topic.  But what this course is really about is the implications of the different sensory systems and how our brain interprets information gathered by them.  You're not just memorizing body parts but understanding why they work, why they're there, how our senses/perception would function differently if they weren't there, or if we had more of something (rods/cones in our eyes for example).  It's actually more psychology than anatomy.  Francis offers these concepts in a very easy too understand, interesting (attention holding) and organized fashion.  Want to know what the world would look like through a cats eyes or ears?  While I can't picture it perfectly, I certainly have a much better concept of what it would be like to view the world through them as well as many other creatures or people with damaged sensory systems.

Francis is very easy to understand, and talks very fluidly.  His regular usage of real life stories and scenarios make everything easy to understand and enjoyable to listen to.  This course has definitely changed the way I look at the world.  It also helped me understand some things in my life.  My dad has been suffering from detached retinas in both eyes and underwent numerous surgeries.  He explained the surgeries to me but I only had a vague idea of what was happening.  After watching this it was pretty clear.

While ""Aging Process"" was in the tile, I feel that it was more than that.  When talking about each of the senses (of which there are more than 5, which I now know, I think there were 8) he goes through what happens when different vital parts of the senses or their corresponding brain sections malfunction or stop working altogether.  Lots of conditions along the lines of blindsight for example.  Look that up and if you find it fascinating then you're sure to enjoy this.  While aging was always touched upon as one of the reasons for declining senses, he covered many other specific occurrences as well to the point that they were equally represented.

Only thing I didn't really like about this is there's a lot of stories about basically animals being tortured.  If you don't want to torture animals I suggest not going into a career as a behavioral psychologist.  It seems like that's how they get about 90% of their information.  For example, some psychologists were testing the effects people have on socializing rats.  So they took some rats and treated them very well and handled them regularly, basically turning them into pets.  Then they took one of them and a non socialized rat and wrapped them tightly in a towel so they couldn't move to make them stressed and them put them in the refrigerator until they froze to death.  The socialized rat lasted 22 hours longer before it died.  I'm no PETA member or anything, I hunt, I've raised animals for food and slaughtered them myself.  And while the results are interesting, I can't help but find that unethical and feel for the rats.  While hunting or slaughtering an animal certainly causes them harm the goal is to make it as painless and quick as possible.  What they're doing is just torture.  I'm not going to rate this talk lower for discussing the studies but I do disagree with them.",1516060800,,4045,4.702702702702703
