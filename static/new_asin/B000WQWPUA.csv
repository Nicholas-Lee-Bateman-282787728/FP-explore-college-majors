8225251,5,B000WQWPUA,"Great exercises to give the horse more confidence, assess a horses personality etc. Unlike the other reviewer, I noticed that safety for horse and trainer was a priority. Students for example are explicitly directed to stay out of the kick zone and exercises and equipment are arranged to create a safe environment for the horse.",1447977600,,329,5.0
8225252,1,B000WQWPUA,I made the huge mistake of purchasing this video. What Ms. Twinney has her students do with horses in the indoor was some of the most irresponsible teaching I have ever seen. Students were placed in positions where they could have been kicked or run over. I will NEVER recommend this video to anyone!,1292112000,,300,4.574074074074074
