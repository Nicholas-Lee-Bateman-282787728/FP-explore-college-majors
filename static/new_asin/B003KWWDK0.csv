Someone had uploaded this to youtube and I was watching it constantly.  I finally decided to buy it, and play it constantly.
The sound is good enough that you can put this DVD on and go do other things and just enjoy listening to their awesome live show!!
One of the best bands ever live, and this DVD really captures a lot of that energy.
Buy it!!",1376092800,,427,4.071428571428571

Can I tell you that I've seriously waited since 1991 or so for a live DVD like this? Ever since my high school buddy let me listen to his cassette copy of ""Flying Jelly Attack"" I knew I had found a very strange yet very good new band.

Though the classic lineup is sadly no more, I was pleasantly surprised with how much this 2009 lineup fit together. Ritsuko channels bass metal masters like Cliff Burton with the headbanging hair twirl on songs like ""Muddy Bubbles Hell"" and is a really good backup singer. I love Atsuko's drumming style but there's no denying that Etsuko is just much more solid and provides a stronger foundation for the group. It's too bad she ended up leaving a couple years after this performance but at least we fans have this to watch.

But what's really something else is how much founding member Naoko Yamano just plain kicks ass. STILL. Remember folks, this is a band that's been out for over 30 years. Her voice is still as strong as ever, and if you didn't know she was over 50 years old you'd never be able to tell with the energy she brings to the table. Her songwriting's really excellent, and honestly I could go into a 10 paragraph stint on how good SK's songs are. But who'd read all of that?!

The production quality of this DVD is GREAT GREAT GREAT. Everything sounds clear. Everything looks fantastic. THIS is how you do a live DVD. The setlist includes all sorts of songs from the band's lengthy career. As this was during the Super Group tour there's a fair share of songs from that CD but luckily that CD effin' RULES so who cares!? They whip through classics like the aforementioned ""Flying Jelly Attack"", ""Banana Chips"", and ""Bear Up Bison"" admist others. I would have liked to hear more off Rock Animals like ""Tomato Head"" but hey you can't play everything right?

They DO play Twist Barbie during the credit roll at the end but it's audio only. I wonder if this was performed during sound check as it would've been great to see them do it too. As an added bonus, Atsuko comes out of retirement for a night and flew to Buffalo from Los Angeles to sing lead on ""Fruits & Vegetables"" for the encore.

Any self-respecting SK fan probably already has this puppy, but if not or you're just curious as to what they're all about GET THIS VIDEO NOW!!",1363305600,,2328,4.4402810304449645
8399073,5,B003KWWDK0,"Who among us doesn't love Shonen Knife? Dummies and mean people, that's who--and everybody knows that mean people suck (bumper stickers never lie). Listening to Shonen Knife is a surefire good time, with music that strikes the perfect balance between Ramones style pop-flavored punk and Cheap Trick style pop-flavored big rawk. Watching Shonen Knife, however, brings everything into focus. These three innocent-looking women from Osaka, Japan, with their matching 60s go-go girl dresses and shiny-happy personas, unleash the beasts of hell with their instruments onstage, bringing the ruckus and flailing about in a manner that actually calls to mind super-evil monster trios such as High On Fire (or at the very least, a young and brash Green Day). Sure, the lyrics are often hard to decipher due to the gals' limited prowess within the realm of the English language, and the titles reveal that the songs are generally about monster cats, healthy eating, unhealthy eating, parties, toys... it's all about fun, fun, fun with Shonen Knife, after all... but come on! This band is incredible! `Live At Mohawk Place 2009' captures the band's final night on their North American tour in support of the album `Super Group' (30 shows in 34 nights... who does that anymore?!?), with a rabid Buffalo, New York, audience eating up every moment. Original member Atsuko (who left the group a few years ago) shows up to provide vocals on a rousing rendition of `Fruits And Vegetables' to kick off the encore, and the concert (in its entirety) is rounded out by a fun (and often funny) interview segment and some cool footage of life on the road with the band.",1293926400,5,1646,4.989090909090909
8399074,5,B003KWWDK0,"Just buy it.

Its too damned inexpensive for how much fun you will have watching and re-watching it.

A real bargain in these tough economic times.",1287014400,,147,4.615384615384615
8399075,5,B003KWWDK0,"This is the DVD that Knife fans have been waiting for...Oddly, SK never released a live
album in the USA. (The excellent LIVE IN OSAKA is a Japan release.) SK LIVE AT MOHAWK PLACE
preserves the last stop of their SUPER GROUP tour of North America, and features the great
lineup of Naoko, drummer Etsuko, and new member Ritsuko on bass and vocals. The band's
lively performance should even please diehard fans who only like the original lineup...
Ritsuko, handling vocals on some classic Michie songs, shows the naysayers that she is
a worthy successor to Michie herself. (There: I've said it.) Etsuko left the band in
early 2010, and she plays her heart out in her swansong performance in the USA... new SK
drummer Emi fits in well, by all accounts. Naoko, easily among the most underrated
songwriters around, is her usual self, which is to say, ""The Rockin'est Lady on Earth""!
Founding member Atsuko even shows up to sing another Michie tune, FRUITS AND VEGETABLES.
And I must say that I still can't listen to ANTONIO BAKA GUY without cracking a smile.

I saw SK shortly before this particular show, and am thrilled to own this DVD. It's
a wonderful performance of Shonen Knife songs both old and new, and its good video and
audio quality makes this a must-have for Knife Collectors. Highest recommendation!",1281052800,10,1308,4.762114537444934
8399076,5,B003KWWDK0,An excellent live DVD capturing the girls in Shonen Knife on the last night of their 2009 Super Group tour of Canada and the United States in which they played 30 shows in 34 days.  Most folks in the 1980s probably considered Shonen Knife to be a novelty act.  Boy were they WRONG.  Now...almost three decades later...the Knife ladies prove that they still deliver the goods with power and style and can outplay just about anyone.  If you ever loved Shonen Knife you will almost certainly get a major blast out of this DVD.  Highly recommended.,1280880000,4,544,4.625
