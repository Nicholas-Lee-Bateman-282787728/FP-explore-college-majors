2807940,4,B000P2A64I,"Poverty Row Pictures presents ""SUNDOWN SAUNDERS"" (2 August 1935) (65 mins/B&W) (Fully Restored/Dolby Digitally Remastered) -- Bob Steele was an American actor --- He was born Robert Adrian Bradbury in 1907 in Portland, Oregon, into a vaudeville family --- Bob's career began to take off for good in 1927, when he was hired by production company Film Booking Offices of America (FBO) to star in a series of Westerns. Bob--who was rechristened Bob Steele at FBO--soon made a name for himself, and in the late 1920s, 1930s and 1940s starred in B-Westerns for almost every minor film studio, including Monogram, Supreme, Tiffany, Syndicate, Republic (including several films of the Three Mesquiteers series) and Producers Releasing Corporation (PRC) (including the initial films of their ""Billy the Kid"" series)

In the late 1940s and early 1950s, that ""new medium"" television had many hours to fill and few dollars to fill them --- They re-discovered the B-Western, still a popular mainstay of Saturday afternoon matinees and many cowboy stars thrilled a new audience --- Taking advantage of this rebirth in popularity, publishers brought to the marketplace comic books featuring these western heroes of ""Bob Steele"" Westerns --- These bimonthly issues were copyrighted in February and April of 1950 by Fawcet Publications --- His career which included nearly 200 feature films, serials and TV appearances --- Steele in his twilight years at the age 59 when he got the part of the cantankerous ""Trooper Duffy"", in the western comedy series ""F Troop"" (1965), who at the drop of a hat would give his rendition of fighting ""shoulder to shoulder with Davy Crockett at the Alamo"" --- Steele retired from the screen in 1973 --- Bob's long career, spanning more than 50 years came to an end in 1988 when he passed away.

Under the production staff of:
Robert North Bradbury  - Director / Screenwriter
A.W. Hackel  - Producer
Bert Longenecker  - Cinematographer
Roy S. Luby  - Editor

The story line and plot, When Jim 'Sundown' Saunders wins a horse race he is paid with a deed to a ranch --- Arriving at the ranch he finds the Bess Preston (Marie Burton) and Father Preston (Jack Rockwell) already living there --- They bought it from the fake land agent Taggart (Ed Cassidy) who then frames Sundown for murder --- It's fairly conventional screenplay and Steele is likable as the little-guy hero who has to do battle with the big guys. The bad guys cause their share of trouble, but are too unimaginative to provide really worthy opponents for Sundown. It's only worth a look if you like any and all old Westerns --- Sundown Saunders is an oddity in the Bob Steele canon, in that the hero's father isn't murdered.

Bob Steele ...  Jim 'Sundown' Saunders
 Marie Burton ...  Bess Preston (as Catherine Cotter)
 Earl Dwire ...  Sheriff Baker
 Ed Cassidy ...  Taggart
 Jack Rockwell ...  Preston, Bess' Father
