4238084,5,B00404ME0G,"The Video and Audio are excellent.

I had wondered if we really needed another Sondheim compilation, even on his birthday, especially since I was left rather cold by SONDHEIM on SONDHEIM. Well, we certainly needed this one. It is excellent. I imagine that you are a already a Sondheim Fan or you wouldn't be reading this, and so I'll get right to the point. Your favorite musical numbers will depend on which Sondheim show is your favorite and on which Broadway Personality you admire most.

Here are my favorites:

1. (Tie) ""Losing My Mind"" - Marin Mazzie. (Heartbreaking)
1. (Tie) ""Too Many Mornings"" - Audra McDonald and Nathan Gunn. (Exquisite)
3. ""Could I Leave You?"" - Donna Murphy. (Gut-wrenching)
4. ""You're gonna love tomorrow/Love will see us through"" - MattCavanaugh, Jenn Colella, Laura Osnes, Bobby Steggert. (Delightful)
5. ""So Many People"" - Laura Benanti (Nostalgic)
6. ""We're gonna be alright"" - Marin Mazzie & Jason Danieley (Witty)
7. ""Johanna"" - Nathan Gunn. (Majestic)
8. ""Don't Laugh"" - Victoria Clark"" (Charming).

Buy this DVD and lose yourself in the imagination of Sondheim.

Even a fan such as I with no talent wishes him ""Happy Birthday Steve"".",1290124800,7,1172,4.98974358974359

4238086,5,B00404ME0G,"I know. I wasn't invited either. But the celebration of Stephen Sondheim's 80th birthday continues. David Hyde Pierce hosts this magical event with Sondheim's longtime collaborator Paul Gemignani conducting the New York Philharmonic. (The fete was filmed live March 15-16, 2010 at Avery Fisher Hall in New York City.) The cast, with a treasury of Tony Awards among them, delight in performing classic as well as less-often heard gems from the Sondheim canon: Joanna Gleason and Chip Zien reunite from Into the Woods; Bernadette Peters and Mandy Patinkin perform chilling pieces from Sunday in the Park with George and Patti Lupone, George Hearn and Michael Cerveris team for a special take of Sweeney Todd showstoppers. Audra McDonald sizzles on ""The Glamorous Life."" A little night music never sounded so superb.",1289174400,11,813,5.2615384615384615
4238087,5,B00404ME0G,"I was lucky enough to be there as well and I have to say... buy this without a question. Totally magical, David Hyde Pierce was a marvelous emcee, and the cast was obviously star-studded. Only Stephen Sondheim's birthday could bring these amazing performers together. Worth it just for the overwhelming finale; I don't think there was a dry eye in the audience. Just buy it.",1284508800,56,374,4.769230769230769
4238088,5,B00404ME0G,"My aunt and I were there as the concert was filmed live.  It was definitely a memorable evening.  It's as if time stood still as brilliant performers recreated their legendary performances such as Bernadette and Mandy singing ""Move On"" from ""Sunday in The Park"" and the baker and his wife- Chip Zien (one of the nicest people to meet in person) and Joanna Gleason singing ""It Takes Two"" from ""Into The Woods.""  Patti sings ""Ladies Who Lunch"" in front of Elaine Stritch and Elaine performed ""I'm Still Here"" as the finale.  (I wish they would have swapped songs.)  And Bernadette did ""Not A Day Goes By,"" again.
Nothing from Gypsy but Sondheim didn't write the music.

It was a historical night we'll never forget.  And we met Dr. Ruth who was sitting next to us!",1283472000,50,762,4.6
4238090,5,B00404ME0G,"The man is a genius...his songs stand the test of time and reflect his genius, and the cast assembled here to pay tribute to Stephen on his, then, 80th birthday, is such a collection of very talented people that the almost two-hour concert passes all too quickly.  They say Stephen doesn't write love songs, but there is such an expression of love in so many of his songs, for he goes about it in a more circuitous way than another composer might.  I pulled the concert up today from Amazon; what moved me is the, now, loss of Elaine Stritch.  At the time of this concert she gives her all to Stephen's ""I'm Still Here,"" from Follies, though she's more identified with ""Here's to the Ladies Who Lunch,"" this time sung by Patti Lupone.  If you're a fan of Broadway, if you're a fan of Sondheim's, this recording of the concert will thrill you no end.",1456272000,,849,4.423076923076923

4238092,4,B00404ME0G,"A beautifully presented concert, expertly and drolly hosted by David Hyde Pierce.  There are a couple of clunkers (""America"" seemed cramped, for example), but the rest of the show is wonderful.  Let's put it this way - this is my second copy of the disc.  I loaned my first copy to a ""friend"" who never returned it.  It's good to have it back in my collection.  Oh, and the finale of ""Sunday"" was a mind-blower.  Lonny Price, the producer/director, really pulled the stops out with this show.",1445558400,,492,4.597701149425287

There are so many Sondheim concerts on utube, that you can watch for free that  i wasn't  sure if it was worth spending money for this one.  If i had it to do again, i wouldn't buy it. I didn't  think there could be any Sondheim songs i wouldn't like, but there were 4 songs in this concert I DID NOT enjoy.  And why wouldn't you have Elaine Stritch sing the Ladies Who Lunch....she was sitting there watching Patti Lupone sing  her song.  Bottom line , better Sondheim songs could have been chosen ...go to other places to get your Sondheim fix.  This concert was very disappointing.",1438992000,,680,4.376

4238137,4,B00404ME0G,"Part nostalgia, part history lesson, part master class, part concert ... with a helping of ego and some self-importance. It's great fun to watch, and using 6 great Sondheim songs as a tool to walk through his life and creative process was great.

Sometimes the Big Six songs get uneven treatment. First there's a number with kids from Glee, another song just gets clips.",1392595200,,370,4.78125

By contrast, the Mackintosh birthday celebration is MUCH better, and I wish THAT was available on blu-ray.  I believe it's called ""Hey, Mr. Producer!""  I have the CDs for that show, but not the show itself, which is too much because in comparison, that was much better.",1387411200,,539,4.34

The purchased DVD is way poorer quality in audio (some sync problems), and video than the TV show recording.  It surely disappointed me!  Shots of Sondheim and audience are grainy and dark as well as the whole concert being grainy.  Would not recommend buying this.  Buy only the blue-ray, and hope it has the quality.  I am about to buy blue-ray and I hope it is worth it!  I love the music and performers so I am willing to try again.",1376784000,,551,4.333333333333333

Mandy Patinkin singing ""Finishing the Hat"", followed by ""Move On"" with Bernadette Peters was a highlight for me, as well as Patti Lupone singing ""A Little Priest"" with both the original and current (at the time this show was filmed) Sweeney Todd!  Don't get me wrong, it is all quite entertaining, but I have to say that the last segment, with six of Broadway's finest singers and loveliest ladies, all dressed in killer red and singing some of Sondheim's greatest showstoppers, was the absolute best for me.

At the end of the concert,  the audience was on its feet sending a prolonged well deserved wave of love not just to Mr. Sondheim, but to all the performers who brought his work to life that evening.
Mr. Sondheim was brought to the stage as the audience continued to cheer. The man, known for the unique quality of his lyrics had this to say.....""Alice Roosevelt once said....you are young, you are middle aged, and then you are wonderful. This was wonderful, Thank you""

Best part is Ladies in Red: Peters performance is raw and genuine while Mazzie simply delivers.

Please overlook all negative comments regarding Peters performance on this board. If one knows anything about the last 10 years of her life then they will truly appreciate her heart wrenching delivery of ""Not a day goes by"" which is less about a break up and more about going on with life after losing someone tragically.",1370736000,,478,4.975

4238204,5,B00404ME0G,"This is a fantastic show!!  Lonny Price, who wrote and directed, is obviously a consummate showman.  His choice of performers and their material was outstanding and wholly satisfying.  David Hyde Pierce as the host is the perfect choice for the witty material presented.  I could go on and on, but the most outstanding individual performance of the evening was
""I'm Still Here"" peformed by Elaine Stritch.  It ended the section presenting the five star women and was just perfect.  She brought down the house, stopped the show, and could have stayed on that stage for at least five minutes if the format of the evening had allowed it.  It was a tribute to her, a tribute to the Broadway tradition, a tribute to Sondheim--and made me cry.
I cried again at the actual finale--""Sunday"" from ""Sunday in the Park with George"" sung by over 200 current performers on Broadway as they made their way down the aisles and onto the stage of Avery Fisher.  One more mention--the New York Philharmonic gave the best performance of Sondheim's music that I have heard, and the pianist deserves individual mention for his exceptional playing.  If you watch this more than once, you will absolutely see what I mean.

4238207,5,B00404ME0G,"I had seen this celebration of Stephen Sondheim's 80th birthday when it was broadcast on PBS recently and was gloriously reminded of the man's luxurious, deeply original talent that has shone so brightly on Broadway stages for decades.  This, in turn reminded me of my best friend's partner who is a conductor/musician par excellence.  He is also a voracious reader and a lover of musical theatre as well as classical and current art music.  This blu-ray disk, along with an excellent biography on Sondheim and an original Playbill program from the live concert will be his Christmas gift from me this year.  This recording of Sondheim's music is performed by MANY of Broadway's greatest actor/singers, whose love, respect and gratitude for Sondheim's music come through song after song.  They really give it their all.  If you can find a copy of this recording  (there aren't that many available anymore), grab it.

One incredible, show stopping performance after another.

4238226,5,B00404ME0G,"There are more concerts and Revues to celebrate the music of Stephen Sondheim's works than most composers wrote shows. They began with thye best, ""Side By Side By Sondheim"" in 1977 in London and made it stand out because they took the three greatest English performers alive and utilized a LOT of music that Sondheim fans had never heard. Then ""Putting It Together"", ""Marry Me a Little"", ""Celebrate Sondheim"", ""Sonddheim at Carnegie Hall"", ""Bernadete Peters sings Sondheim"", ""Barbara Cook: Mostly Sondheim""- for God's sake, even Madonoa sang Sondheim at the Oscars, quivering with nerves over material tha was far too hard for her- but even Barbara Cook has cursed over the challenge of singing Sondheim. (""It's these damn INTERVALS!"" she exclaimed as she rehearsed for the 1095 famous ""Follies in Concert"" filmed and recorded live at Avery Fisher Hall-yet another)

On March 22, 2010, Stephen Sondheim turned 80 years old and David Hyde Pierce, Chip Zien, Lonny Price and Paul Gemignani arranged a concert in his honor. This was a concert to please him, not the public. We didn't hear ""Broadway Baby"" again; We were not forced to listen to one more amazing singer sing ""Send In the Clowns"" (a song that is so eassy to sing that Strohm Thurman could've recorded it) and instead we had the New York Philharmonic, Hyde Pierce's comic reparte' and the finest most famous theatre performers in history to do a live birthday concert for him which, fortunately, was beautifully filmed and is now, without question, the greatest evening of Sondheim to date.

There are moments of revisiting the original: Mandy Patinklin and Bernadete Peters singing ""Move on"", Johanna Gleason and Chip Zien"" with ""it Takes Two"", and the new cast performance of ""America"" which was as good, if not better than the original. Despite Sondheim's insistence that his weakest lyrics are ""West Side Story"", we know, as we watch ""America"", that these women are really communicating with each other in Spanish- as Fosca and Georgio are communicating in  Italian- and the performance here is spectacular. Perhaps ""West Side Story"" IS Sondheim's weakest, but that still makes it far stronger than most other musicals. Despite my argument, he still disagrees with me. you decide. Alexander Gemignani gives the finest and freshest performance of ""Something's Coming"" that we've heard yet and there's a spectacular moment when we end up with two Sweeney's and one Mrs Lovett on stage, where after a small bit of eye contact and negotiation they turn ""a Little Preist"" into a trio that pleases those of us who know the piece very well and titilates those who are hearing it for the first time.

About three quarters of the way through the concert, six straight back chairs are placed down center and into each chair is placerd a legendary diva. Bernadette Peters, Mrie Mazin, Patti Lupone, Audra McDonald, Elaine Stritch and  Ann Rankin. Each woman is wearing an original gown designed foe the actor but made of the same fabric and one by one each woman steps down stage and sings a classic, remarkable Sondheim masterpiece, but not at all the piece you would expect. (In fact, the graciousness with which Elaine Stritch appaluds Patti LuPone's ""Ladies Who Lunch"" is as moving as stritches performance of ""I'm Still here."" And LuPone finally won my respect with her performances here.)

The conert ends with the two songs you would expect, but in both cases there is a twist and in deference of a spoiler alert let us just say that there are two surprise elements that make ""Sunday"" the finest performance ever done here, and then Sondhei8m's modest, thank you following Mildred and Patty Hill's ""Happh Biorthday"" (at a royalty cost of about $700 to Chappell Warner) The thirteen people who spoke their opinions to this critic regarding the final twenty-five minutes of this show had one common reaction: tears. Tears of memory. Tears of possability. Tears in regard to the white page or canvas (so many possabilitie...) tears of nostalgia as they recalled their own lives at the time they heard these songs for the first time.

As for this critic I shall say what I've been saying since 1978: Stepen Sondheim's work will last as long as Shakespeare, Mozart, Bach or Williams; so that owning a hared copy of the score may be enough. But as I've also said, as I indicate a stack of printed manuscruipt paper, this is not music: this is a recipe for music. And any chef who follows a recipe exactly as written is mediocre at best. The art of music ad lyric is meant to be heard in a specific moment in time by an audience in a specific mood based on how his or her day was- this is why life theatre persists today; there is never a repeat performance. The fact that this DVD exists is miraculous because to have assembled this talent, this material on the day of this composers 80th birthday (and to see him cover his eyes with emotion from his aisle seat in the audience- Steve is a humble man)and then recorded it, even though a DVD doesn;t capture the magic of the live event, this DVD is strong enough to move you.

And when you see what it is that they did for the Finale, you will begin to feel a tightening in your throat even before they reach measure 9. The miracle of the material, the man, the music and this evening come to life like a religious rxperience.",1332806400,4,5329,4.765980498374865

What walks down memory lane to see and hear the Baker and his Wife together again from Into the Woods, and Sunday in the Park with George - the years have been kind to those stars. And the words and expression! These singers were well chosen for the clarity with which they convey the meanings, literally and deep inside, of Sondheim's wonderful songs.

4238241,3,B00404ME0G,"I don't know how many birthday tributes there have been to Sondheim on his 80th birthday but I have only seen two.  The first one was given at the 2011 London Proms and the second was the present one under review and I have to say that the New York version doesn't hold a candle to the Proms version.  With the exception of the absolutely sizzling version of ""America"" for which Sondheim of course wrote the words, the performances are singularly underwhelming.  Who had the not very brilliant and pointless idea of turning the duet from ""Sweeney Todd"" in to a trio with two men taking the part of Sweeney? NOT a good idea.  David Hyde Pierce makes a genial host but overall the London tribute wins hands down.  It is better directed, better sung, better played and better acted.  For those of you who weren't privilidged to see it, I'm sorry.  My American friends who have seen the London version are very much in agreement with me.",1318723200,2,933,4.517857142857143
4238242,5,B00404ME0G,"Sondheim's music is not enjoyed by everyone because his music and lyrics are complex, with a few exceptions. I happen to think he is one of America's great composers, along with  Berlin, Kern, Gershwin, Porter, and Rodgers. This presentation cannot, of course, showcase all his works, but it does a very nice job of entertaining with what it does give. The singers, some from the original casts, are all excellent and the orchestral backing is first rate. The highlights of this tribute, to me, are ""The Ladies Who Lunch"", from Company, sung by Patti LuPone, and ""I'm Still Here"", from Follies, sung by the indomitable Elaine Stricht. I miss the omitted ""Send in the Clowns"", and I would have liked more selections from Company included, but this is knit picking.

I was hooked from the very beginning and felt as if I were sitting in the theater. Stephen Sondheim's music has won many awards and not only has he kept Broadway in music for 6 decades, his shows have been made into movies such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sweeney-Todd-The-Demon-Barber-of-Fleet-Street/dp/B0013D8LOK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sweeney Todd - The Demon Barber of Fleet Street</a>&nbsp;Sweeny Todd starring Johnny Depp as Benjamin Barker.

One great highlight of the show is when all Stephen's great Broadway Divas, Patti LuPone, Audra McDonald, Karen Mazzie, Donna Murphy, Elaine Strictch, and Bernadette Peters dress up in red while each person belts out songs that get the audience to their feet.

This is a wonderful two hours of song, and a trip down memory lane. It was great to see many of the original broadway cast members back on stage recreating their roles just one more time and for a few minutes again, showing the world what they did best.

None more so than the incomparable Mandy Patinkin returning to Sunday in the Park or George Hearn return to Sweeney Todd. In fact the Sweeney Todd sequence was a joy with both the old and the new Demon barbers coming together with the legendary Patti Lupone.

The best of the best is the sequence with all the leading ladies on stage together each performing a classic and each performing them to the letter. The ladies in red are fabulous and the support and encouragement they give each other is just a thrill to watch.

His songs creep into your heart and mind, sometimes with a punch between the eyes, sometimes with a slow scratch at your heart, but always with good intentions.  This DVD contains Stephens songs performed by some of the worlds leading performers who interpret the songs their own way, whilst paying tribute to the writer himself.... what's not to love!!",1295568000,,556,4.711340206185567
4238269,5,B00404ME0G,"""Sondheim! The Birthday Concert"" (2010) features 25 of Stephen Sondheim's songs. It is a beautifully staged performance from Lincoln Center with the New York Philharmonic conducted by Paul Gemignani. (Gemignani had conducted a tribute to Sondheim way back in 1973, and he is a longtime associate of the composer.) The iconic ""Send in the Clowns"" was not one of the songs sung probably because a revival of ""A Little Night Music"" was playing on Broadway. Interestingly Elaine Stritch sings one of the numbers, but she does not sing her signature ""The Ladies Who Lunch,"" but does a great job with ""I'm Still Here"" from Follies. Two songs from ""West Side Story"" are presented for which Sondheim wrote the lyrics but not the music. The host was a very humorous David Hyde Pierce.
 The original George in ""Sunday in the Park with George,"" Mandy Patinkin sings ""Finishing the Hat."" This song is causing quite a stir because it's the title of Sondheim's fascinating new book about his song writing. Roberta Peters joined Mandy to sing ""Move On"" from ""Sunday in the Park with George"". John McMartin from the original cast of ""Follies"" did a moving version of that dramatic song with fine lyrics ""The Road You Didn't Take.""
 Two men who have played Sweeney Todd, George Hearn and Michael Cerveris, join forces to sing ""Pretty Women."" Then Patti LuPone links up with them to sing ""A Little Priest."" This was one of the best numbers in the tribute. Patti LuPone with Elaine Stritch seated behind her does a terrific job with ""The Ladies Who Lunch."" Audra McDonald, Donna Murphy and Nathan Gunn are atandouts.
 If I had to name my favorite modern composer who sometimes irritates me with some of his music, but who overall fascinates me, it would be Stephen Sondheim. (I didn't like the second act of ""Sunday in the Park with George"" nor any of ""Into the Woods"") I never miss an opportunity to see a Sondheim show or concert anywhere whether in New York, Provincetown, South Florida, or London. This was a thrilling eightieth birthday celebration for a great artist.
 Hal Prince and Sondheim had a close collaboration for some years. As with the Jerry Herman Hollywood Bowl tribute there are the obligatory reaction shots of Steve in the audience.
 For the penultimate number 287 singers from Broadway and off-Broadway shows marched up to the stage and sang ""Sunday"" before the whole cast sang ""Happy Birthday.""
 ""He's too difficult, his music is too dissonant, he's too arrogant, he's too intellectual."" He's Sondheim, and he's the only one we have! This is a DVD to treasure.",1295308800,,2565,4.844748858447488

It begs to be watched over and over again.
David Hyde Pierce was nearly the perfect host and kept it moving with his usual style and grace.
The pacing was well done, the selections were excellent, the whole production well done.

The performers were superb and one can sense a feeling of genuine appreciation for this tremendously talented composer.

I was introduced to Sondheim by our talented church choir director who brought a very poignant ""Not While I 'm Around"" to my attention.
I was hooked and began finding other works by Sondheim.

A parish priest who is a friend of mine can sing ( beautifully) ""A Little Priest"" ( I am assigning an arbitrary name to a selection from Sweeny Todd)

Later I was fortunate enough to attend a presentation in which Sondheim is interviewed onstage.
He comes across as a somewhat shy, introverted man but his writing is genius.

Many have said ""If you are a Sondheim fan, you must have this DVD"". I would respectfully submit ""If you are not yet a Sondheim fan, you must have this DVD""

4238289,5,B00404ME0G,"This is a stunning collection of Sondheim pieces--far better than the edited version shown on PBS. Although one can always quibble with individual selections--his post-70s work is very much under-represented, but then the wealth of Sondheim gems could fill a dozen concerts--this collection marries song to singer deliciously. The birthday cake of a program is frosted by the diva sing-off at the end--LuPone's ""Ladies"" is a home run that's then topped by five more definitive readings. And the cherry on top (to mix the dessert metaphor) is a moving ""Sunday"" that must be experienced. All in all, a birthday present to remember.",1293580800,,629,5.176470588235294
4238290,5,B00404ME0G,"I listen to today's hip-hoppers, rockers, and rappers, and I can't understand a word from any of them, the lyrics and music smothered by three or four electric guitars and heavy percussion. And even if I could make out what's being sung, I wouldn't hear lyrics worth hearing.  But then there's Broadway music, especially that of Stephen Sondheim.  PBS recently gave us a Broadway musical cornucopia with the 80th birthday celebration for Stephen Sondheim. It was wonderful, and full of wonder as Broadway stars, both current as well as not-so-current singers, reprised songs from his many shows: Patti LuPone, Mandy Patinkin, Bernadette Peters, Audra McDonald, Elaine Stritch, Nathan Gunn, to name only a few. It was one of the best two hours I've ever spent in front of the tube, hearing clear as a bell Sondheim's witty, sophisticated lyrics, watching the many beautiful men and women singing those lyrics. I could hardly contain myself or my tears.",1293580800,,951,5.050955414012739

If this doesn't win the Emmy for best special TV event, there is no justice.  The brilliant segment with the ""ladies in red"" was amazing, with each singer at the top of their game.  The ""Sweeney Todd"" segment was also brilliant, and I was moved to tears (twice) by Bernadette Peters.

4238294,5,B00404ME0G,"Having watched the Carnegie Hall Sondheim Concert 20 times, I was hanging out for his 80th Birthday Celebration and certainly was not let down.
This wealth of talent is breathtaking and it would be presumptious of me to attempt a qualitative review, but I'd just highlight two sensational moments : 1) Patti LuPone's 'Ladies who Lunch', with Stritch on stage with her (wearing a hat!) is priceless and I doubt if you'll ever hear this tour de force better sung....and 2) When House Lights go up and, seemingly every gipsy on Broadway troupe down the aisles on all levels of the Avery Fisher, singing 'Sunday'....get out the tissues!!
Being Sondheimed has cauterised me from so much of the Music Theatre ouvre and seeing this anthology of his stunning work, I'm not remotely surprised. Simply Sensational!",1293321600,,804,4.962962962962963
4238295,4,B00404ME0G,I love Sondheim and it was a pretty good concert.  It could have been a little bit longer for my taste.  It sort of was like an appetizer rather than a full concert.  The production numbers and the music were excellent.  It was fun to watch.,1293148800,,241,4.173913043478261
4238296,4,B00404ME0G,"I decided to add my two cents since no one seems to have felt exactly as I did so my feelings might be helpful to anyone reading the other comments.  First, and obviously, if you are a fan of Sondheim's work and haven't bought this, do so immediately.  No qualms about portions of the whole should keep you from buying it.  But do know what you're getting.  More than one number seems less-than-well-chosen.  America from WEST WIDE STORY is a waste of time.  It was neither original nor magnificently done.  Not horrible by any means, just superfluous.  Same for Something's Coming.  Why?  Couldn't that time have been given to pieces with music and lyrics by one of the great composers in Broadway history?  The Quartet from FOLLIES is very clever writing but the performers seem a tad bit under-rehearsed.  And, frankly, it's hardly unknown.  As at least one other reviewer has noted, A Little Priest is more stunt than stunning, Patti LuPone trying too hard to come up with less.  Probably live was better.  And though Audra McDonald is a marvelous partner to Nathan Gunn in Too Many Mornings (a highlight for me, in fact) her song in the finale is, well, stupid.  It's a cut number from the movie version of A LITTLE NIGHT MUSIC written to be sung by a child.  It's not a bad song, but does not belong in this finale of great pieces.  Surely, Another Hundred People or Take Me To The World or something more worthy of her could have taken its place.  Uncharacteristically, she seems to be trying too hard herself, as if ""proving"" this deserves her attention.  NOT McDonald at her best (or Sondheim, for that matter, though at least it's rare.)  And Bernadette Peters gives such a stunning rendition of Move On with her original co-star Mandy Patinkin (probably the best minutes in the whole concert) that her subdued Not a Day Goes By seems anemic.  Not bad by any stretch of the imagination, just not the heart-breaking version that the Carnegie Hall or one-woman show performances were.  And finally, I can't be the only one who thinks Elaine Stritch has become a caricature of herself.  Her talk/scream performance of I'm Still Here made me want to say ""It's time to leave, then.""  And I am a fan (was a fan?)

But so much else is wonderful.  Even a little throw-away juvenilia number Don't Laugh is performed delightfully by Victoria Clark.  ALL the numbers from SUNDAY IN THE PARK are moving including the ""finale of hundreds.""  Pretty Women is better than A Little Priest.  So Many People is a lovely song, simple really, done in a lovely simple way by Laura Benanti.  The duet from INTO THE WOODS is a gem, joyful even.  Patinkin's bitter / painful / heartbroken version of Finishing the Hat is even better than the video decades ago (which is saying A LOT!)  Certainly, this proves that a sometimes idiosyncratic performer like Patinkin has a justified reputation.  It packs a wollop to be immediately followed by the bigger hit of the tear-producing Move On.  The Road You Didn't Take becomes all the more poignant coming from a man who is NOT middle-aged, but near the end of his life.  It changes the meaning of the song, but it is a worthy entry to the playlist of the concert.  Growing Up will be new to many fans, being a song added to MERRILY WE ROLL ALONG after its original run.  Having an original member of the Broadway version seems a bit odd since he never sang it in the show, but the nice performance by Jim Walton, who is now middle-aged, leaves a touching irony behind.  It had to be an important moment for Walton, since he was so criticized when the original opened (as if he had anything to do with its problems.)  He does not over-perform it.  Good for him.

Then the finale of the ladies.  If only three of the six are really sublime, those three are SUBLIME!  Patti LuPone makes up for Priest with a pitch-perfect The Ladies Who Lunch.  Marin Mazzie leaves behind a marvelous version of Losing My Mind.  Surely it belongs in the great pantheon of performances like Dorothy Collins and Barbara Cook (and I would include Dorothy Loudon.)  Which leaves Donna Murphy topping all the others in Could I Leave You?.  Just watch it, you'll see.  Leaving Stritch to the last of the six makes perfect sense in every way, but I couldn't help but think it a let-down.  The audience--and the other reviewers on here--did not agree with me, so you can make up your own mind.  As for Peters and Not a Day...if you don't have the Carnegie Hall concert or her one-woman show in London, they would be worth every penny just to have those five minutes.  If you don't know those, perhaps her more subdued though well-sung version on this DVD will not disappoint.

So some minor disappointments aside, a worthy DVD of an important event.",1292716800,12,4751,4.594047619047619

Every performer was excellent, but these ladies mentioned (and a few more whose names elude me right now - oh, yes the wonderful Joanna Gleason with Chip Zein) is what musical theatre is all about - especially Elaine.

The last song is ""Sunday"" from ""Sunday in the Park with George.""  As many productions that i've seen of this number and the show itself, this performance will blow you away.  I don't know how many people are involved in this number but it must be at least 200 people.  The song as emotional as it is, is even more emotional in this DVD.

4238312,4,B00404ME0G,"""Sondheim: The Birthday Concert,"" filmed at Avery Fisher Hall (Lincoln Center) in New York City this past March, is the most recent in the string of 'Great Performances' telecasts conceived in part by conductor Paul Gemignani.  Previous credits include 'Sondheim: A Celebration at Carnegie Hall,' and the two 'My Favorite Broadway' revues-'The Leading Ladies' (Carnegie Hall), and 'The Love Songs' (City Center).  While 'The Birthday Concert' is certainly a must for the die-hard Sondheim fanatic-myself included-the series of musical selections is a bit more subdued than usually expected from Gemignani.  Each of his previous well-known revues featured multiple showstoppers, including multiple numbers highlighting not only the vocal talent, but the power and versatility of the orchestra, a feature unique to the orchestra-on-stage model of the revue.  Unlike his previous compilations, including those exclusively dedicated to Sondheim, 'The Birthday Concert' focuses on rarely-heard works, performances by original cast members in original roles (with less than their original power), and the dynamism the defines Sondheim's collected body of work.  For the Sondheim novice, much of the significance could be easily lost.  For the Sondheim veteran, 'The Birthday Concert' is a dream come true.

Ironically, the highlight of the first act is a hard-hitting, emotional performance of 'Too Many Mornings' from FOLLIES, by powerhouses Audra McDonald and Nathan Gunn-two artists not remotely associated with Sondheim's work on Broadway.  Bernadette Peters and Mandy Patinkin revisit original roles in 'Move On' from SUNDAY IN THE PARK WITH GEORGE, by far the best-sung of the ""originals"" section of the evening.  George Hearn and Michael Cerveris, the original and revival Sweeney Todds, are joined by Patti LuPone, Mrs. Lovett to both previous Sweeneys, in a trio revision of 'A Little Priest,' which, though fun to watch, is not Miss LuPone's best performance of record.  In a deliberate effort to bring new talent into the regular review circuit, director Lonny Price recruited up-and-coming talents Michael Cavenaugh, Bobby Steggert, Jenn Colella and Laura Osnes for 'You're Gonna Love Tomorrow/Love Will See Us Through' from FOLLIES.  While the number is charming, the men appear stiff and the ladies nervous.

The second, much shorter half of the evening features six solo numbers by six divas of the New York stage, each clad in custom red Von Furstenburg gowns.  Their parade entrance to 'Beautiful Girls' (FOLLIES) alone was worth my ticket, much less the purchase price of the DVD.  LuPone breathed new life into 'The Ladies Who Lunch' (FOLLIES), a number long associated with Elaine Stritch.  Marin Mazzie belted an emotional 'Losing My Mind' (FOLLIES) in implicit homage to the late, great Dorothy Loudon.  Audra McDonald dazzled (as always) with the once-discarded version of 'The Glamorous Life' (NIGHT MUSIC), and Donna Murphy showed she can sing while pissed in 'Leave You?' (FOLLIES).  Peters was the only of the six women to sing the Sondheim number with which she is traditionally most associated, reviving her fabled 1992 performance of 'Not a Day Goes By' from MERRILY WE ROLL ALONG.  Showing her age and decreased power, Peters might have been best served to leave the performance fabled.  Stritch closes the evening with a rousing, poignant rendition of 'I'm Still Here,' from FOLLIES, receiving the evening's only standing ovation.

All in all, 'The Birthday Concert' is an undoubted asset to the collector of Broadway revues and all things Sondheim.  Given its lack of heavy-hitting numbers, its skewed focus on FOLLIES and SUNDAY, and the conspicuous absence of both Liza Minnelli and Angela Lansbury, it fails to top Gemignani's previous efforts.  Still, though, highly recommended.",1291939200,10,3810,5.432937181663837
4238313,5,B00404ME0G,"I absolutely love this recording (DVD), the entertainers were wonderful, David Hyde Pierce held it together.  I would be hard pressed to select my favorite performance. It seems that Sondheim songs are all my favorites.  I started feeling guilty about the amount of time I was spending enjoying the DVD when wonder of all wonders, just as I decided to forgo my ""fix"" I grazed by PBS and the overture was  playing.  I have to support PBS so I kicked back and watched and listened again. Anyone who has ever heard Sondheim should own this; it is on my list to give to good friends at Christmas or birthdays or just whenever.

4238314,5,B00404ME0G,"A celebration that was musically thriling and moving. Sondheim has always been lauded for his lyrics, but seldom praised for his music. This time, his music, played by the New York Philharmonic Orchestra and performed by  the cream of the crop of Braodway artists shows  how melodic and stirring his creations are. Bravo. A gem to be watched  over and over.",1291939200,,357,4.819672131147541

The duo of Michael Cerveris and George Hearn ws truly inspired as were the six ""ladies in red"" -- Marin Mazzie, Elaine Stritch, Donna Murphy and Bernadette Peters (I've momentarily forgottten the two others)...all glorious.  But the closing number, ""Sunday"" from ""Sunday in the Park with George with the entire cast onstage -- with singers from other Broadway shows -- 281 or so -- streaming down the aisles to pay tribute to the master, was overwhelming.  If you're a Sondheim fan, you have to have this.",1291248000,2,673,4.7844827586206895
4238316,5,B00404ME0G,"...but I'm here!
One of the best of the 900 Sondheim tributes. It was deeply moving to see the immortal chemistry between the reunited Zein and Gleason and, spectacularly, Bernadette and Mandy in the night's most electric performance. Except, of course, for the Great Diva-Off AKA ""Red Will Be Worn Tonight!"" Audra was clearly the last one to the songbook (feel free to fast-forward) but the other ladies are spectacular. Lupone was on fire, even bringing all those consonants she's been hiding under the mattress all these years.  Stritch looked believable as a survivor of the Hoover administration, and for those of you who've seen her in ""A Little Night Music,"" here's a chance to hear her remembering her lyrics. Donna Murphy blew the place up with an eviscerating ""Leave You"" -- by far the best performance of that song I've ever heard. The great surprise was an amazzieing ""Losing My Mind"" by Marin Mazzie, who seems never to have heard Dorothy Collins or Barbara Cook and made me feel the same way. Brilliant, beautiful, definitive performance.  After seeing Peters in the half-an-octave role of Desiree, I wondered if she had -- quite reasonably -- lost a little around the edges. She has not. At 62, she is still in a class by herself. She cements her status as the premiere interpreter of Sondheim and the great lady of the modern era of musicals.",1290729600,4,1358,4.799145299145299

Sondheim music is complex and riveting but the camera person changed shots every 2 or 3 seconds. The camera angle changes several times in one phrase. During the lively dances the camera angle changed so many times that I actually got sick to my stomoch.
Once they made 42 camera angle changes during a single performance by Mandy Patinkin. I couldn't take any more. I couldn't turn it off because I love the music so much so I survived by only listening and not watching the remainder of the production. Shame on the producers for allowing such a crime! They had the ingredients for a superb and precious documentation and they ended up with a horrid and frustrating experience. My recommendation would be to save your money and buy the CD instead.",1290643200,29,865,4.735099337748345

For me....Stritch with her years of show-business savvy just nails ""I'm Still Here"". A WOW. Now on to something else. I'm not into performers not getting their royalties, but there is a sorta ""pirate"" that will not be shown here or released domestically of Sondheim's July 21, 2010 celebration at Royal Albert Hall in London. It is truly a desert island DVD. I've viewed it about 5 times and am amazed, not all performers we are familiar with, but all first class. Judi Dench nails ""Send in the Clowns"". Watching  her go into  character, then return, it is an acting lesson. For me, the highlight is a singer named Julian Ovendon, great to look at and a voice somewhat Gordon MacRaeish but purrrrfect for ""Being Alive"". It is definitive! Look him up on Utube.  I'm not trying to send business to a company, but the only way I know of to get this DVD it is from The Berkshire Record Outlet...It's on the Encore label, This label can be chancy, but this looks and sounds just wonderful.
