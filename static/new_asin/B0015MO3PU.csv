8259116,3,B0015MO3PU,"Content:  Excellent

Delivery:  Not so much

Although most of the course is in English, there are some portions being spoken in foreign languages with English voice-over.  Most of the time, the voice-over isn't relatively loud enough to drown out the foreign speech and is quite difficult to follow and understand.  Also, a few (not all) of the foreign speakers who speak English do so in such a way that they should also have subtitles in English...I lost words/thoughts way too often.",1362182400,2,486,4.938271604938271
8259117,5,B0015MO3PU,"Philosophy for the most part is not conducive to film or even documentary-style footage. That's what makes this collection stand out. There isn't much competition. With interviews of living and recently deceased philosophers along with ""archival"" footage of Socrates acting out some of his dialogues and excellent narration to tie up loose ends in the interviews, this one has the goods. This is an A+ collection and survey of the field with 26 episodes on 4 DVDs. It is not merely lecture as The Teaching Company uses. There is not much that could be improved on here except for perhaps adding conventional subtitles would have been nice along with the closed captioning that is included. For laypersons along with philosophy students, this is one not to miss.",1333324800,4,761,5.0
8259118,5,B0015MO3PU,"My wife used this dvd for her fall 2009 semester. After watching this video with her I found philosophy to be more interesting than ever. The World great philosophers were casted as part of the interviews and contributions to the material. My wife said that their lecture recommended the DVD as part of the optional material for the course, and it helped her 100% far beyond expectation; I will recommend this DVD set for other students who want to visualize philosopy in real life terms than studying philisophy in abstract (text book based) and finally work out of their class with an A+ grade",1266019200,8,595,4.730769230769231
8259119,5,B0015MO3PU,"I've taught philosophy for about 10 years and have made this recommended material for my introductory courses. This video series has 26 episodes of about 30 minutes each covering all the usual topics in an introduction to philosophy course. It is nothing short of outstanding. While it might look expensive, the series used to be $1000 directly from the publisher so it is finally reasonable if you pick up a used copy. (Especially when you consider it has 13 hours of video). The strength of the series is that it has interviews from some of the leading philosophers of the 20th century (mostly American and British). Some, including Ronald Dworkin, James Rachels, and W.V. Quine, have since passed away making this an important piece of history as well. Other strengths include sharp editing, actors to recreate some philosophical scenes (such as Plato's dialogues)and also adequate musical accompaniment and clear narration very obviously handled with advisement from professional philosophers. Weaknesses are not many but include marginal acting (what do you expect from an educational video?), lack of captioning, and the material is not probably challenging enough for the advanced student. That said, it covers many of the big questions in philosophy of mind, religion, etc so we're all amateurs when it comes to those. The lecture series from ""the learning company"" go deeper than this one but the Examined Life has far better production quality and is comparable to other best-selling documentaries currently on amazon. This is as good as it gets for philosophy videos/documentaries right now folks. Happy viewing!",1260316800,18,1623,5.27027027027027
