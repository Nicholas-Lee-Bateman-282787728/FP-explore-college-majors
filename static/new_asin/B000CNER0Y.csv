8099825,5,B000CNER0Y,"This is the best i have ever seen about insects. This is an incredible program about the wisdom of insects and how intelligent they really are and also how important they are in the animal kingdom and pollination. I Couldn't keep my eyes off the screen. The visuals are stunning with mostly close ups of the insects doing there thing and they will teach you things that will surprise you. You will see mantises, beetles wasp,flies scorpions centipedes  bees,termites,butterflies and many more insects. I could only see that there is a creator that left a little bit of himself with each insect. The narration was very professional with perfect tone and the music was perfect for each scene. The resolution was very clear almost HD.You will want to have this in your wildlife collection believe me and this is what is needed in the schools today. I highly recommend: Explore the wildlife kingdom:The hidden world of Africa, before it goes out of stock.",1338681600,2,951,4.8343558282208585
