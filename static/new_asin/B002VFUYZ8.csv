8382007,1,B002VFUYZ8,"Imagine a director who has made umpteen direct to video zero-budget clunkers. (That's Ulli Lommel). Imagine that he decides to make a movie about a serial killer and that he sets it in a candle-lit basement strewn with cheesy props like skulls, sinister dolls and black-painted coffins bearing pentagrams which have nothing to do with the flimsy plot. Imagine he decides to ripoff the SAW movies by calling his serial killer 'The Puppetmaster'. Imagine that the thinly-motivated revenge plot hangs on the fact that the characters who are lured to the basement and killed have done such things to deserve their fate as reject him, and to sell him a car that was 'a lemon'. That would be bad enough, along with the crap acting, inaudible dialogue, moronic script, bad makeup effects and ridiculous irrelevant flashbacks.

Then, imagine that for some reason the script throws in a couple of references to the horror writer H.P. Lovecraft (""My girlfriend had one of his books at her bedside) and that the serial killer is known in real life as 'Charles Dexter Ward' )(one of Lovecraft's characters) and that one of the vicitims is surnamed Pickman (another one of Lovecraft's characters).

Then imagine that the releasing company (or the director, who knows?) decides to call the film H.P. LOVECRAFT'S THE TOMB. For why? It is not set in a tomb but a basement. It has ZERO connection to Lovecraft's story of the same title. But maybe sticking Lovecraft's name on the packaging will lure in unwary film fans who are aware of Lovecraft's sterling reputation as a horror writer.

A high school student could write and direct a better flick than this in a week or two. This is dreck, pure and simple. Avoid, avoid, avoid. I am giving it one star because Amazon doesn't let you give zero stars, and that is the only reason I am rating it at all.",1353456000,,1836,4.7492163009404385
8382008,1,B002VFUYZ8,"Once again we have another movie with H.P. Lovecraft's name attached that has absolutely nothing to do with the story the movie is named after. I'm not even sure where the blurb on the front of the case,""curiosity will lure you in"" comes from.
 As far as this movie is concerned there is no curiosity, it's just bad; one of the worst films I've ever seen.
The entire movie is shot in a warehouse obviously on a very low budget and someone must have gotten a hold of some Chucky doll rejects and decided to throw them in for creepy effect but they just get annoying after a very short while.
 You can see quite clearly that the ""make-up"" consists of magic markers and candle wax.
The acting is mediocre if only because there is no dialogue to work with. The actors spend all their screen time reciting names and dates and trudging from one end of the warehouse to the other. Occasionally another doomed actor drops from the ceiling or mysteriously appears out of nowhere only to die at the end of the scene.
 This mess is interspersed with flashbacks that are seconds long and do little to explain whats going on, and on top of that there are numerous cuts to a mysterious horse woman wearing a cape and white mask (also not in the HPL story).
 If you want the atmosphere and tension of a good H. P. Lovecraft tale read the original story but do yourself a favor and  steer clear of this mess.",1313971200,2,1392,4.37984496124031
