7090486,2,B00VIKUD62,"The story had potential. The synopsis certainly made it worthwhile to rent, but the execution was poor. I find it hard to believe that it actually won an award for the Best Horror Film at the London awards. Why? What for? It wasn't a real horror film. The premise was intriguing, but that was it.
  Overall, we didn't care for it and cant recommend it.",1467590400,,352,4.4
7090487,2,B00VIKUD62,"Ineffective blend of lousy special effects, half-baked horror, heist drama and y/a soap opera about six rather old looking British boarding school students (three boys and three girls from their sister school) who are members of the UK version of ROTC and doing their final assessment by patrolling the boy's school for one evening after term has ended.  Unfortunately, two barely competent thieves pick the same evening to break into the school archives.  Even more unfortunate, that very same evening also happens to be the 350 year anniversary of four ritual murders that happened on the school grounds to rid it of the bubonic plague.

Unhallowed Ground may sound like a comedy but that's one genre the movie actually stays away from.  The dopey thieves argue and aren't smart enough to simply come back the next evening when the school grounds will actually be as deserted as they expected.  The six students pair off to flirt and occasionally be startled by lights suddenly going off and strange noises.  Also, apparitions of the four dead students turn up now and then for no apparent reason and the ghost of a plague doctor turns up and disappears as well.

Unhallowed Ground is never suspenseful and never comes close to figuring out how to make its various elements mesh into an effective whole--it basically feels like several different movies clumsily fused together.  Unfortunately, none of those movies is very good and a late third act twist feels like it was pulled completely out of thin air.

Nothing really works but Unhallowed Ground is painless enough to sit through--just don't expect anything more than a completely forgettable time-waster.",1453507200,3,1663,5.04014598540146

7090506,5,B00VIKUD62,"i really don't understand why this movie hasn't gotten a higher rating.  compared to most of the free Prime horror movies on Amazon, this one looks like an expensive bod budget Hollywood production.  the young actors are all really believable in their roles.  there's a really interesting historical backstory about the Black Plague, Satan & sacrifice.  the location is perfect -- a upper crust British private school.  then there is a side story of 2 ex-military losers trying to steal some first edition Shakespeare, etc.  the action has good pacing, there are no boring parts.  the little bit of CG is well done -- none of it seems stupid or unbelievable.  i really, really liked this one, i just would have given it a different title.",1476835200,9,738,4.801587301587301
7090507,2,B00VIKUD62,"The film opens with an abbreviated history of the Great Plague of London then flashes to the present to the Dhoultham School for Boys. In a strange situation three star pupils from Dhoultham (may I buy a vowel?) are teamed with three top female students from Norfield. They are to patrol the school for ??? a gold star? We are informed this is the anniversary of a tragedy which we find out about later...but the implication is the place is haunted. In addition to the supernatural aspect, two bad guys choose tonight to rob the school's achieves.

This is a successful formula for 80's films (with or without the bad guys) and normally involves, an old house, funeral home, carnival, mall, or bowling alley...my personal favorite. However in this one they drove it into the ground. The six main characters didn't come across as developed. A shower scene from the neck up....ummm...you guys have seen a horror film before right? The special effects, which were low budget, would have been passable if the film had some character. Could one of the guys have been funny? Heck, even a stupid fart joke...you know the one ...did you hear that? shh. quiet. POPF! This would have been an improvement, the dialogue was that dry.

8710248,1,B00VIKUD62,"Chock full of inconsistencies and incessant chatter. It combines elements of the films, Harry Potter (treasure room), The Ninth Gate and Three Kings;  the technical aspects however are admirable; camera work, sound, editing and all that

The pace is agonizingly sluggish and certain background material is better suited to British audiences; for instance what exactly is CTS training in an elite British public school (private school equivalent here in USA)? Google search couldn't tell me.

If the school is so elite, why do all the students have thick cockney accents, or have the elite public schools ""across the pond"" become more democratic. The CTS military leader is too busy looking at himself in the mirror playing commando and only checks in with his training team once; while the rest of them are goofing off.

How do a couple of renegade ex professional soldiers know about the Plague Book in the school archives and completely overlook a wealth of first editions by Marlowe, Shakespeare and Milton; and why does one student seem amazed when he sees these editions as though none of the student body ever entered the Archives room.
The actions taken by one of the ex pro soldiers is completely out of character as a ruthless mercenary.
Also, The Black Death was not a global phenomenon as suggested in the opening credits; it was confined exclusively to most of Europe.  You have to slog through more than half the movie before anything really interesting takes place.",1487980800,2,1479,4.97165991902834
