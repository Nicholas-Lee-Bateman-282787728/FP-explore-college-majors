1547566,5,B00005JOXX,I'm not exactly a TV fan but this show makes me buckle over with laughter every time I watch it.  The way the characters act and interact is fun the entire way through.  While an obvious knock-off of Roseanne (as most of these shows are) it still drives a funny edge into contentious modern issues.  Definitely a must-see for all of you sitcom fans out there.,1159056000,19,359,4.409090909090909
1547567,2,B00005JOXX,"Still Standing
I seen the entire series, that's the worse show I ever seen, since I watched Married with Children and According to Jim. I don't think they should make any more family shows, why don't leave the family shows to Nickelodeon or the Disney Channel. Watching this show is like watching Lizzie McGuire on Acid. Bill and Judy are the worse parents, I ever seen. If they were my parents, I put myself for adoption or I run away. Bill and Judy were in Sunnydale, East Great Falls M.I., Pleasantville, The O.C. or Smallville they wouldn't survive one day there. Vampires would kill them in a minute if they show up in Sunnydale. No, boring normal family would ever survive those places. If Brian was a vampire in Angel, he probably take them in a minute. He probably sire Lauren, I think she would of qualify. Bill and Judy Miller are like the suburban Richard and Emily Gilmore, Rex and Bree Van De Kamp from Desperate Housewives, Jim and Cheryl from According to Jim, George and Angie Lopez from George Lopez and Al and Peg Bundy from Married with Children. I always compare Brian to Clark Kent in Smallville, Steven Hyde from That 70's Show Chuck Sherman in American Pie and Seth Cohen from the O.C. Taylor Ball looks like a teen idol, the guy has a greatest resemblance of Benjamin McKenzie from the O.C., Tom Welling from Smallville and Brandon Routh from Superman Returns",1158883200,,1383,4.626016260162602
1547657,5,B00005JOXX,This video needs to be in the library of all married couples.  It can also be used by those thinking of getting married.  It had some great teaching moments.  It also shows that you can  be doing everything rights and still face trials in your marriage that will test every fiber of your being.,1356480000,3,294,4.388888888888889
1547658,5,B00005JOXX,I saw the screening of this movie last night in Atlanta.  Me and my BF went and even he was touched (as I saw tears fall down his eyes).  We are couple dealing and working through infidelity and this movie helped us both.  And gave me courage to keep on push through... This is a movie that every couple will find a way to relate to.  I am now ordering the DVD.  You won't be disappointed!!!!!!,1347580800,3,394,4.131578947368421
1547659,5,B00005JOXX,"The movie Still Standing was well produced and refreshing to watch. It provided a rare opportunity to learn about the intimate struggles facing real couples and how they resolved issues to remain married. My husband and I watched the movie together and it sparked open and honest dialogue. After viewing the movie, I ordered a copy for my brother and his wife who recently celebrated their 25th anniversary. I would recommend the movie for married folks, people in relationships and singles dating.",1338595200,4,498,5.085365853658536
1547660,5,B00005JOXX,"My wife Jacqueline and I had the distinct pleasure of attending the Cheverly Md. screening of this film and words can't describe how powerful and moving this film truly is! Challenges faced by married and dating couples alike are addressed in stark detail, and questions too personal to ask are answered before the viewers' very eyes. 'Still Standing' is a film that's long overdue within the African American community;  a film that beautifully brings a message of faith, hope, and love that is so needed in today's marital society. I highly recommend this to ALL married and 'marriage-minded' couples!",1337904000,6,603,5.090909090909091

1547664,5,B00005JOXX,"I love this show. They are so funny. This show talks about real life stuff,and they deal with it just like you or i would. I think if 20 people watched this show about 16 or more people would love it and think it was funny.",1263945600,,223,3.869565217391304

1547707,5,B00005JOXX,This was by far the funniest show on CBS.  It's a shame that it was cancelled.  The writing was witty and hilarious. The acting was fantastic.  The actors cast in the roles were perfect. This show was much better than many of the shows out now.  I can't wait for the entire series to come out on DVD!!!,1185753600,2,302,4.155172413793103
1547708,5,B00005JOXX,"I am constantly looking for this show to come out on DVD. I loved it and never missed it on CBS on Monday nights. No announcement of it being canceled, it just went on ""hiatus"", and never came back. The King of Queens came out about the same time.....while funny, I would have preferred that show get canceled and not Still Standing. The writers were great, and I loved the family, Aunt Linda, Bill's mom (Sally Struthers), Everyone!
Hopefully, soon, our prayers will be answered!",1182988800,3,480,4.658823529411765
1547709,5,B00005JOXX,"I've periodically checked Amazon to see if ""Still Standing"" had been released on DVD, but had never run across any reviews or others wanting to buy it. It is gratifying to see so many other lovers of the sitcom.  It is as well-written as any sitcom I've ever seen and the acting is fantastic.  I wanted to echo the other five-star reviewers in the hope that some CBS mogul will read these and decide to release the show on DVD.",1182470400,5,427,4.325
1547710,5,B00005JOXX,"I agree ... I didn't get to see this show very often on network TV and am watching when I can on LifeTime.  It would be so much better to have it on DVD!  If they can release Reba, why not this show???  Still Standing is way funnier than Reba!",1180656000,4,243,3.82
1547711,5,B00005JOXX,I agree with the forum entries-I never got to see this show on regular television and instead got to see it on Lifetime.  Please get this show on dvd asap!!  It's a great show!,1180483200,4,176,4.147058823529412
1547712,5,B00005JOXX,"This show is hysterical.  And the characters are lovable.  The dialogue is clever, witty, and intelligent.  And it makes me laugh.  Out loud.  No matter how many times I've seen an episode, which is something no other show has ever accomplished.

For God's sake, offer it on DVD.",1180396800,5,279,4.708333333333333
1547713,5,B00005JOXX,"This is my favorite sitcom to watch in reruns this year, but it's on locally at 4 am.  The situation is a cross between Family Ties and Roseanne.  The parents (Mark Addy, Jamie Gertz) are fun loving & lazy, irresponsible compared to their own kids.  Their son (Taylor Ball) is an intelligent nerd with a dumb pretty sister and a much younger clever sister, so to that extent it's similar to Family Ties.  But the stories remind me more of Roseanne; at any rate it's just as good as either of those very funny shows.",1178755200,5,515,4.389473684210526
1547714,5,B00005JOXX,"I just recently started watching this show on Lifetime and I can not believe that I never saw it when it was on prime time! The first time I saw this show, I laughed my A** off!

Please don't make us wait long for a DVD release!",1177027200,6,368,3.730769230769231

1547787,5,B00005JOXX,"Despite the fact that my wife and I watch far too much television, we have stuck to syndicated sitcoms(Roseanne, Cheers, Friends, etc.) over the last few years due to what we have considered to be a poor turnout for new sitcoms.  We didn't tune-in to Still Standing until it was already in syndication, but we have made up for lost time by watching every airing available.  What makes the show work is that it's simply seamless... the acting, the writing, the rapport the characters share... everything works.  One litmus test that we've always used for family sitcoms is the interplay between the family members, and I've never seen a better representation of a real-life family than what Still Standing offers.  The contentious relationship between siblings Brian and Lauren rings true, especially when they meet in the middle to ridicule their parents, and watching parents Bill and Judy struggle to find a balance between neglecting and overparenting their children keeps the show grounded in reality.  Throw in the precocious Tina as the youngest daughter, and you have a TV family that actually behaves like a contemporary family.  I don't know why the show was cancelled, but all the great ones die young.  If you haven't given this show a chance, you're missing out.  My wife and I are eager for the show to be released on DVD.  We'll be first in line (or online).",1172275200,7,1372,4.854077253218884
1547788,5,B00005JOXX,"Well the show has been canceled (}-:) so now we need each complete season to be released in dvd sets, Still Standing deserves the best dvd treatment, one of my all time favorite sitcoms.",1166745600,,186,4.5
1547789,5,B00005JOXX,"This show is great!!! Probably one of the funniest shows I've ever seen. At least it is on lifetime. I want to buy a personal video recorder and record every episode so I have them. Since its not on DVD I have no choice. I wish it didn't get canceled, I guess it didn't get good enough ratings for some reason. I have no idea why. I wish I could find it on DVD.",1164844800,25,361,3.891891891891892
1547790,5,B00005JOXX,I absolutely LOVE this show!  I get extremely upset if I can't watch it everyday!  SO WHY ISN'T IT ON DVD????  I would buy this series in a heartbeat if they ever decided to put it out there!,1163548800,30,191,3.973684210526316
1547791,5,B00005JOXX,"This tv show is absolutely hilarious.  I love Judy and Bill, their sense of humor is the best.  In response to a previous poster (poser), I'd love it if my parents were like Judy and Bill when I was growing up. They don't put their kids in danger and they care what happens to them, they just like to have fun with them and yes sometimes at their expense.  Laughter is the best medicine.",1163116800,16,387,4.202702702702703
1547792,5,B00005JOXX,This is one of the best shows hands down! Everything from the characters to the plot lines of the episodes. I record it all 4 times during the day on my DVR. It comes on Lifetime at 12-1pm and 5-6pm. Very funny show that is down to earth. Mark Addy is a premeir actor that should be acting alot more. Give it a chance and you will be hooked!!!,1161216000,19,343,3.9855072463768115
1547793,5,B00005JOXX,"Ok, I never write these reviews... I have read many of them but never write them! But for this show I had too!! I didn't watch it while it was on tv basically because whoever does the promotions at CBS should be demoted, along with whoever decided to cancel this show and leave some of their other crap still going!! I have managed to watch this show in syndication on Lifetime and the old WB (does the new station actually have a name!?!?!) this show is hilarious. The actors and storyline are fresh and hysterical. I truly wish that not only was this show still on and I had followed it but that CBS would get with it and put this show on DVD!! PLEASE CBS get this show on DVD and at least do one thing right!!!",1159833600,13,713,4.173913043478261

However,reviewer.... please buy a funny bone !!!.

  Maybe when you're a little older you'll understand that life is funny.

Don't take it so personally.

This show is great. It's is very well written - contemporary, sharp.

The the acting is great; the comedic timing, impecible.

Mark Addy and Jami Gertz are perfectly cast; as are the children.

Take a moment to look at their bios.

They are extremely talented for their ages.

In fact, go to [...]

and give a listen to the voice on that young woman.

It is impressive.

We watch it twice a day on Lifetime.

Thanks to the cast for a great hour of TV.

Boo!! to CBS who has no vision.

With all the junk on TV, they really dropped a winner.
