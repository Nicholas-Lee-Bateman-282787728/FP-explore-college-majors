5054117,2,B0074JOCOA,"I am probably rating this too high to begin with.  I am seeing a lot of films lately that are very similar in plot (or so they try to be).  Showing several different couples (people) with issues (relationship, etc) and then you have the one that has it together, etc, etc, etc.  This one was not very funny, where it should have been and I really wasn't feeling the bar scenes.  Just not very good.  Ok though is you are desperate for something to watch.",1339804800,,454,4.294117647058823
5054118,1,B0074JOCOA,I cannot give this movie a rating(I wish they had a (BOMB BUTTON) it was so bad.....and funny thing is it had the potential to be something good. Whomever wrote this damn movie need to go back to the drawing board. I'm a writer and I know I can do better than that! A waste of my money and my TIME! I never relied on any ones opinion about a movie I wanted to see....but let's just say what a waste of perfectly good stars for this bullshh...! CONTRADICTION MY A$$!,1336521600,7,465,4.1208791208791204
5054119,1,B0074JOCOA,This movie looks as though it is filmed with a camera from the nineties.  Storyline sucks and ends abruptly!  Do not buy this movie it is not worth wasting your time.,1336521600,6,166,4.32258064516129
5054120,1,B0074JOCOA,"This movie made no sense whats so ever.
The actors in this movie are great actors but the script was horrible.
It had no substance, you cant follow the movie and it was all over the place.
Waste of my 12.00.
Need a refund.",1336348800,12,222,4.068181818181818
5054121,3,B0074JOCOA,This movie left a lot of parts out. People was coming in and out of the movie but with no connecting roles.,1357603200,,107,3.909090909090909
5054122,1,B0074JOCOA,This display all these celebrities on its cover but most of the well-known actors only appear as cameo. The story line went nowhere. Am not sure what was the message they were trying to convey. Disappointing.,1357516800,,208,4.805555555555555
5054123,5,B0074JOCOA,"Item as just as seller listed. Provided fast ship. The plot was cool as well as the acting. I would watch it again in a few years. If I don't like a movie it gets sold. So this is a keeper, but wouldn't pay full price.",1356566400,,218,3.760869565217391
5054124,4,B0074JOCOA,It was interesting to see that all the couples had issues to overcome including the instructors!  It was amazing how unwilling some of the couples were unwilling to change some of their ways to make their marriage more stable.,1348185600,,226,4.794871794871795
5054125,3,B0074JOCOA,"It was a great start I wished I could have seen more of it! Overall I wasn't disappointed, but it seemed to be missing something.

Maybe they should work on a PART II call it MORE Contradictions of the Heart?",1348185600,,208,4.2
5054126,1,B0074JOCOA,"Watching this movie was a waste of time!  It's all over the place.  It starts with a group of guys getting together after 10 years and a couple of them are so irritating and unlikeable that it's hard not to turn it off within the first 10 minutes.  I wish I had turned it off!  Then it jumps into a group of women.  I figured, okay, maybe these women are the counterparts of the ensemble of men I just endured.  No, they weren't.  Then, mercifully (and abruptly), it's over.  I agree with the reviewers who said giving one star was generous because a bomb button would be so much more accurate!",1346630400,,594,4.288288288288288
5054127,4,B0074JOCOA,"Heaven knows why the other viewers couldn't see this was a film about people trying to connect in the emptiness of nightlife.

This is a dialogue driven movie about peoples' unconscious need to connect with each other. People wish to be accepted for who and what they are and this film is about all the characters desire to find just that in a night on the town.

Some people don't understand a movie that does not depict blacks and other groups fighting, killing and victimizing one another. The other viewers here weren't prepared for a movie that is mostly dialogue and character driven.  The movie is good. It shows that when the party is over one can still go home alone. And, if one has a reasonably good thing at home, that is the real reason to celebrate.

This is a good film, given half the chance. Glad I went on a hunch and bought it.",1346544000,2,846,4.403846153846154
5054128,1,B0074JOCOA,This movie was horrible.. Alot of good actors in it but you could not follow the movie at all ... it was all over the place. There should be a YOU MEAN REALLY? button..,1340582400,,168,3.9705882352941178
5054129,1,B0074JOCOA,This movie drags on from start to finish.  I would not recommend this movie.  There is no plot and given the big name actors I thought that it would be better.  Just boring and drags on and on.,1340582400,,193,4.026315789473684
5054130,1,B0074JOCOA,"This movie made no sense what so ever. Turned it off after 10 min.
Do not spend your money on this film... You've Been Warned!",1339891200,,126,4.08
8509944,3,B0074JOCOA,A good DVD!,1404432000,,11,3.0
8509945,5,B0074JOCOA,The movie has a lot of good meaning for me. And it makes you do some deep soul searching. .,1403568000,,91,3.6
8509946,2,B0074JOCOA,"A few good messages were conveyed throughout the film in regards to relationships. However, the plot was very sloppy (all over the place).",1395705600,,138,5.043478260869565
8509947,3,B0074JOCOA,"""We can contradict our walk with our talk. Welcome to LA."" This line is spoken in the beginning and it pretty much explains what this film is about; people speaking words that contradict their actions.

Characters are interacting with each other in ways that eventually brings the truth to light. There were scenes I liked and scenes I didn't like. The scenes in Michael's (Christopher B. Duncan) restaurant were the most interesting, especially the conversation between Kim (Wendy Raquel Robinson) and Lester (Mike Dolan). Less profanity may have helped me to enjoy the movie more than I did, but it was good that the sex scenes weren't too graphic. The film deals with issues like betrayal, marital problems, friendship, low self-esteem, and self-awareness.

The dialogue is this movie's greatest strength; quite a bit of it leaves the viewer with something to think about. Favorite Line: Trying to make a life worthwhile in the false magic of an evening.",1385078400,,957,5.050632911392405
8509948,1,B0074JOCOA,this movie was a joke. it was about these different people who all had problems and it just didn't do it for me,1368489600,,111,3.869565217391304
8509949,3,B0074JOCOA,"The movie was dialogue driven.  There was not a lot of action which is ok.  The point was to make you think about some of the issues and drivers of people's behavior.  As we know, when men get together, they talk about women and when women get together, they talk about men. There is nothing new under the sun.  However, the subplots alone were enough to carry the movie.  You want to know why the wife cheated on the husband while being petrified of him cheating on her.  Why not give us more to explore.  White women knowing that most black men feel they are trophies.  Explore that. The statements that Michael Delorenzo made concerning relationships were powerful but it should have come out more in dialgoue and not as a speech.

Perhaps the movie tried to touch on too many topics which resulted in it's failure to give any of the issues enough attention.

The homosexuality piece still has me wandering.  What was the point of that?  Additionally, the interjection of the white rapper and black female coupling did not fit at all.  The focus should have remained on the two characters in the restaurant.  There was enough there. The Michael character was very complex.  And so was the female character.  The white rapper bordered being so comical that he was unbelieveable.  Another missed opportunity.",1368316800,,1309,4.721238938053097
8509950,2,B0074JOCOA,i did not like this movieso i would not recommend this to anyone i will not watch it again ever,1366675200,,95,3.8
8509951,5,B0074JOCOA,"After seeing all of the negative reviews for this movie, I just had to watch it! I couldn't believe that a movie with so many great actors could be so bad. Well, this movie was awesome! This movie is for the more sophisticated thinkers. Everything isn't right in your face, so that's why I understand why some don't get the message and why it has bad reviews. But this movie is about real life and what we all go through in our relationships. Please watch! You won't regret it. ;)",1362873600,,480,4.344444444444444
8509952,1,B0074JOCOA,"The movie is not good at all, no real storyline, it's all over the place, but I would love to know where I can find the soundtrack, the songs sounded pretty good, it's sad when you pay more attention to what's playing in the background than to the actual movie.  Good concept, but the movie felt like it wasn't finished, and there better not be a part 2!",1359417600,,354,4.205882352941177
8509953,2,B0074JOCOA,I can't think of anything I liked or disliked about this DVD.  Nothing memorable occurred . I cannot honestly recommend this movie.,1357689600,,131,4.954545454545454
