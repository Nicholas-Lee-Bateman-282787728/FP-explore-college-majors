7167150,3,B00XD549KQ,"The story is a nicely constructed slice of self-discovery that morphs into horror actualized. It is a journey that seems to be taken lightly by both the main character and his friends. All of which is told through video dairy clips. Ben and his friends spend the majority of the time bouncing back from freaked-out concern to ""party"" mode during the course of the events. Luckily for us ""The Changing Of Ben"" is a total existential experience because it would just be too much melodrama and time filler. Mills brings in a ""predator-prey"" component which really sells the horror elements of the story. Most of which is given by a cast that has committed to their characters. Some of the line delivery and scenes fall a bit flat for a moment but I never lost complete interest, or lost the connection with the story.

The special effects are pretty standard affair for a film of this budget. The creature effects used for the metamorphosis moments of Ben's transformation work nicely for what they were. Budget size really isn't an obstacle if conviction and creativity are involved. And Jason Mills and his team obviously know that because I found those moments convincing. The other special effects used are the camera gimmicks associated with the found footage subgenre, and the gore is a blend of CGI and practical effects. Mostly the film builds its chills and suspense with the drama and heightened emotional state of the characters. Sometimes it works, other times not so much. Still all things considered there are some really cool, creepy moments in ""The Changing Of Ben"", and Jason Mills is methodical, conscientious, and decisive when it comes to making sure that the story, and his vision is delivered from start to finish. Overall I was impressed with this one. It is a bit mediocre on the horror side, and kind of text book as far as style of found footage that it is, but there is some nice character development, creepy atmospheric moments, a little comic relief, and nice special effects and creature makeup in ""The Changing Of Ben"".",1437868800,2,2048,4.818181818181818

7167155,3,B00XD549KQ,"It was just okay. I thing they could have added more to it to make it scarier. The acting was sub par, especially the actor who portrayed the priest. I think he should have been left out of the movie all together, his part didn't bring anything to the movie and it was untimely. His girlfriend was equally as bad. They seemed to have a brother and sister relationship. It was weird. Glad it was on prime, so I didn't waste any money on it....just my time. Btw...in the title, ""The Cult Next Door"" has absolutely no part in this story whatsoever! Deceiving....",1464566400,2,559,4.436893203883495

7167162,3,B00XD549KQ,"Milo was about the best actor in this movie.  Umberto Celisano as Ben Moore actually wasn't too bad. Sara was REALLY bad - in fact, there weren't too many good points in the movie.  One thing that irritated me is they KNEW that something was wrong with Ben - it's why they started recording what was going on.  So why didn't they ever look at the video after the first couple of nights when things really started going downhill.  No one seemed interested in even looking to see if they could see what happened each of the nights.  Derick (who initiated the filming in the first place) asked to look at the video I think twice.  After that, no one watched the video!  Even when Derick had the camera he never checked to see what was on the film.  I don't mind the camera flickers as some have complained about - paranormal activity is known to screw up electronics so it only makes sense that the camera shots are ""crap"".  I will give it this tho - the makeup of ""night-time"" Ben was pretty good!  And I did appreciate that while the camera did mess up while it was filming night-time Ben, you did get some decent clips of him that were pretty cool.

All in all  - if you're in the mood for some paranormal activity and aren't too fussy about what you're watching, go ahead and watch it - just don't pay for it - it's not worth it THAT much.",1444521600,3,1340,4.252964426877471

7167168,1,B00XD549KQ,"Despite some effective low level special effects, this movie should be trashed. The acting was bad. We are tired of the standard issue ""lost footage"" video. DONT waste your time watching this one.",1440806400,,196,4.96969696969697
7167169,5,B00XD549KQ,Good movie creepy as hell one of the better found footage movies. At least it didn't have the shaky camera through the move like some of the really annoying ones do...PLOT. Ben is the nice guy he has a great girlfriend cool friends and for all outward appearances a really happy life. However not is all as it seems gradually strange things start happening and Ben is slowly being taken over by a sinister force a demon. The only thing I hated is why oh why when Ben starts roaring almost like a lion and his eyes begin looking inhuman did Ben's friends not run? And later on his buddy was looking at him his face turned gray and he stays,1440720000,,638,4.2809917355371905

7167171,1,B00XD549KQ,"Oh man. Where do I even begin?
Yet ANOTHER ""Found footage/demon possession"" movie.
In this story, Ben Moore, a nice, middle class man, lives with his girlfriend and adopted brother, begins to suffer from identity issues (a result of being adopted as a child) and a nasty case of insomnia. His bazaar behavior prompts his brother to begin recording Ben's sleep walking episodes and seemingly pointless interviews, questioning Ben on what he remembers of the night before. We quickly see that this is more than just stress induced sleep walking when, on the first night of recording, Ben savagely murders the neighbors cat, something he has no recollection of the next day.
Since this doesn't seem to set off any alarms for anyone, they continue on, agreeing to never speak of it.
Then, things just get progressively and painfully predictable and mind numbingly stupid.
By night 2, Ben is experiencing extreme physical changes, such as white-out eyes, cartoon-like black circles around his eyes, dark, bulging veins and begins to howl and scream in a voice 6 octaves below his usual voice.
Oh, and he can now dislocate his jaw and sprouts fangs at will.
After taking him to a doctor (I guess to make sure these weren't just mutated flu symptoms) they decide to call a priest, who's played by a man who might be the WORST actor in the history of actors. I was embarrassed FOR him through the entire 6 minute performance. Not to give you the impression that ANY of the actors were good. They were all pretty awful. He was just especially painful to watch. I've seen kindergarteners put on Christmas pageants more Oscar worthy than this film.
From there, it's pretty much every found footage/possession movie ever made, only, possibly worse than all of them combined. I continued to watch in hopes that some great twist or notable scene would make it worth the 78 minutes of my life. No such luck.
Again, this is another movie recommended by numerous ""Top Ten"" lists.
I don't even know what to say anymore, people. I'm beginning to think that good horror is dead (I was gonna say ""no pun intended"", but it kinda is).",1440028800,,2111,4.754768392370572

7167173,1,B00XD549KQ,"This movie was unintentionally funny in some parts (the ""fight"" towards the end of the movie with Sara's dad and Ben was hilarious!)

7167176,3,B00XD549KQ,This movie would have been a lot better with less F-Boms and better actors.,1439424000,,75,4.428571428571429
7167177,3,B00XD549KQ,Not the greatest movie ever... Some of the acting was pretty bad. The actor who played Ben did a decent job.,1439164800,,108,4.190476190476191

7167180,1,B00XD549KQ,"Thank God this is on Prime... TERRIBLE ACTING. Scary bad.

If you want a laugh, though, check out the ""priest"" who comes in - that is some epically funny bad acting. I acutally LOL'ed, it was so bad.

Boring, lame found footage c-horror movie. No scares. The acting is actually so bad there's just no way they could pull off anything resembling a paranomal horror movie. This is more like a community college freshman drama course final project.

But, it's free on Prime, so hey...",1438300800,9,481,4.635294117647059
7167181,3,B00XD549KQ,"I thought CHANGING OF BEN MOORE was pretty good. If I could, I'd probably give it 3 and 1/2 stars, because there are lots of gaps in the story and the movie never answers the big question of how Ben got the way that he did. I thought the actors did a pretty good job and there were definitely some scary, creepy scenes, but I did not like the High Schoolish behavior of some of the people in the film or some of the silly sex scenes that were very immature. Other than those minor criticisms, I thought it was a pretty decent film.",1438300800,,531,4.115384615384615

8715732,2,B00XD549KQ,Certainly nothing to rewatch.  Acting was pretty shoddy and the fact that no one seems to know how to charge something is pretty sad.,1476230400,,133,4.541666666666667
8715733,3,B00XD549KQ,"For a Prime movie it wasn't that bad. The plot really never explained its self. Why was Ben changing?
