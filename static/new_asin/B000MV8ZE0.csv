8172824,4,B000MV8ZE0,"Well The Firm was a great movie. It was a very good depiction of soccer hooligans in England but this one touched on the normal lives outside the arena of violence. It was really interesting to me... The other movie (Elephant) was EFFEN RETARDED! It made no sense at all and it was boring. I stopped the movie halfway through it was so bad. However, The Firm made the purchase worthwhile. I would recommend it to anyone who is fascinated by British Football Holligans. Just don't expect much from the other flick.

Made in Britain is a MUST SEE too so don't miss it. I love that film!",1222128000,,584,4.407407407407407
