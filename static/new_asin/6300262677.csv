7807673,5,6300262677,"I bought this film to transfer to a DVD+RW disc from my Panasonic VHS/DVD recorder. I really liked this film and wish it were available on DVD or Blu-ray, but for now this will do for me. Sold the UNRATED VHS version right after I had it on a disc. The transfer to disc was ok, and looks identical to the tape I viewed. The gore scenes in here were pretty darn good. The storyline was ok, just predictable is all. Some of the acting was bad, but that's to be expected with films from that era, However, I did really like the lead girl and guy. If you are into horror movies from the 80's, this is the one to get",1381708800,,611,4.016393442622951
7807674,5,6300262677,"Amidst the hard-to-find horror films of the '80s that haven't made it to DVD or are streamed in their entirety on video sites such as Youtube, ""The Mutilator"" stands at the top of the hill as one of the best forgotten slasher films of its era. A group of college friends go to take care of the lead guy's dad's house on the shoreline in the South (I believe Georgia?). Here's a first, even for slasher films: The killer is the lead guy's Dad, and this is shown to us right from when they arrive. The lead guy accidentally shot his mother when he was 10 and now his father is out for revenge on his son and the friends he brought along... pretty sick and twisted, huh! It's like Cronos decided to star in a slasher film. Well, the movie is very entertaining, the dialogue is the classic ""so cheesy it'll make you smile"" sort of affair, and there are some pretty great gore shots throughout the movie! Also, not to give away any spoilers, but something rather rare for a slasher film, this one has a happy ending which earns big points for me. Hard-to-find but this is a great film for fans of slashers and horror in general. Thanks for the time and peace.",1318204800,,1154,4.32258064516129

7807676,1,6300262677,"It is October and of course I'm going through my
HORROR stage(Um! Clint,every month is your HORROR stage)
I just happened to go by The Mutilator and saw all these
RAVE reviews??????????????????????????????????????????
Um! Where do I start? First I did see this a long time
ago and I admit is it really fair to do a review from
when I was a teen. Well I debated but finally said YES!
For someone has to tell the truth and this is CRAPULATOR!
What I can remember is VERY bad acting,and I mean the
worst acting of BAD acting! A teen gets it with a chainsaw
and screams like he's saying hello to a friend. The decapatation
of the cop looked like a stuff-dummy! If you like SLASHER
HORROR than buy The BURNING-MADMAN-PROWLER and of course Friday
the 13th. But this! I rather see FREE WILLY 4:WATCH ME DIVE!
THE MUTILATOR...MORE LIKE SEE YA LATER! Oh! one more thing
the vhs box does say a cool thing...BY AXE,BY BLADE,BY SAW
BYE BYE!

YEAH! BYE BYE ALRIGHT!",1192060800,,952,4.471264367816092

7807678,4,6300262677,"I would recommend tracking down the unrated version if you can get it. Back when it first came out I had bought the R-rated version not knowing that 'Unrated Version' usually meant more gore (I was young). I remembered how much I loved it as a kid. When I seen how much it scared my cousin it made me love it even more. That's what it's all about isn't it?

Over the years I was finally able to get the uncut version and wow what a difference! The Mutilator will teach you another use for an outboard boat motor (for further instruction check out ZOMBIE HOLOCAUST-aka DR. BUTCHER). To think we all thought it was designed for travelling on the water. What were we thinking? LOL!!! There is even a gruesome scene involving a woman that got a room full of my college friends squirming in their seats even though they were all guys.

Don't watch it expecting Oscar quality acting tho. Some of it is downright awful. Just look for a scene during the opening credits between a convenience store clerk and his wife. It is some of the worst acting I've seen in a long time. But if you want a fun movie that has enjoyable characters, great gore, cheesy acting, the usual slasher cliches, etc. check it out.

Will someone ever release it on DVD? It is strange that there is a lot worse out there that has found life on DVD. Go figure.",1105833600,,1325,4.3562753036437245
7807679,3,6300262677,"First off, I was made a DVD copy of the uncut version of the movie, so this review will reflect that uncut version.

The movie has alot of the vintage ""camp"" slasher movies aspects to it, although the characters are twenties and going to a beach house for a get away. One by one the become missing, subjected to brutal deaths.

The uncut version has some pretty bloody scene, a nice decapitation scene and alot of nice blood.

A great addition to any fan of slasher movies, but I wouldn't shell out more than $5 for this video.",1102204800,,527,4.357142857142857
7807680,3,6300262677,"A carload of teenagers go on vacation, and indulge in sex and alcohol until a deranged killer shows up to kill them.  Yes, this movie offers essentially nothing new on a tried and true slasher theme.
At the same time, this movie goes after that theme with enough guts and gusto to make the film worthwhile.  The real charm of the movie lies in the Mutilator.  As you may well guess from the title of the movie, the Mutilator is less of a straight-up slasher villan than a chap who comes up with more clever and disgusting ways of doing away with his victims.  Thus, the movie delivers a quite respectable level of gratuitous gore.  The gratuitous nudity level is pretty low, but hey you can't have everything, and there is at least a little bit.
If you've bothered looking this movie up in the first place, I'd imagine you have some fondness for cheesy slasher flicks, so by all means, while i wouldn't call this a classic, it's definitely a good entry into the slasher canon, and fun, fulfilling viewing.",1029196800,,1005,4.530386740331492
