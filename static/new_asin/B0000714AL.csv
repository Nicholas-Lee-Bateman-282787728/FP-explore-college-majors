1798615,4,B0000714AL,"Jungle plantation foreman Barney Chavez (Raymond Burr) allows a poisonous snake to bite his boss so he can marry the boss's wife Dina (Barbara Payton). This angers the housemaid who wanted Barney for herself so she goes to the wizened old crone who supervises the house and who witnessed the murder. The old woman concocts a hoo-doo potion from a mysterious and illegal shrub and begins slipping it to Barney along with a curse that he will become an animal of the jungle. On Barney's and Dina's wedding day, the curse goes into effect. Barney takes to the jungle at night as a gorilla leaving Dina perplexed at his behavior. Soon animals and humans alike are found ripped to shreds. Police chief Lon Chaney Jr. suspects native superstitions are true about a ""beast that walks like a man"" and that Barney killed his boss and warns Dina. But she loves Barney no matter what and sets out to confront him herself. This is pure campy hokum and great fun to watch. Eons away from ""Bride and the Beast"" and played relatively straight, the film introduces Payton as Dina in a strapless cocktail dress and sexy ankle strap shoes dancing to Latin music. So you know right from the start that this is heading for the twilight zone of bad movie heaven. And since you know the title, you wouldn't have it any other way. The acting is just barely above par and Curt Siodmak's direction keeps things moving smoothly despite low budget restrictions. The print from Image is decent enough and the sound is fine. So for a cheesy early 50's flick about a man turning into a gorilla from a jungle curse and the woman who loves him anyway, this ain't bad.",1039305600,3,1635,4.583617747440273
1798616,4,B0000714AL,"Infidelity and murder on a jungle plantation lead to supernatural consequences.  Veteran writer/director Curt Siodmak weaves a magic spell, and transforms a modest film into good entertainment.  In addition, a strong cast is an asset.  Raymond Burr suffers jungle hocus-pocus courtesy of a female shaman.  His simian urges appear as the brooding night settles in.  The initial metamorphosis has a dreamlike quality that transcends typical B movie standards.  Lon Chaney, Jr. is the perceptive police commissioner that respects the native superstitions, and believes that Burr is a murderer.  For a change, Lon is not the hirsute beast stalking the darkness.  Barbara Payton is Burr's treacherously beautiful bride.  Unaware of his gorilla alter ego, she is puzzled why he would rather swing through the trees at night instead of swinging with her.  Familiar faces in the supporting cast include Tom Conway and Woody Strode.  The production values are meager and rely on jungle movie stock-footage.  Overall, the movie has a low budget look.  Regardless, this is a minor gem.  It is better than the sensational title might suggest.  Good fare for genre fans. ;-)",1025827200,14,1161,5.26775956284153

1798672,3,B0000714AL,"I have been watching old episodes of ""Perry Mason"" recently, and I had forgotten the Raymond Burr played a heavy frequently in his early film career.  In this movie, Burr takes the shortcut to winning the affections of Barbara Payton.  Unfortunately, Burr ends up paying the price for being an expeditious amore.

Barney Chavez (Burr) is a foreman on the South American plantation of Klaas Van Gelder (Paul Cavanaugh, a veteran star who also appeared in an episode of Perry Mason).  Van Gelder has a sumptuous blonde wife, Dina (Payton, playing this role after her career began to disintegrate).  Rather than a threesome, this movie has sort of a foursome since Dr. Viet (Tom Conway) also professes to have the hots for Dina.  Of course, Dina's husband is quite devoted to her and, being much older than her, he is also quite jealous.

After an argument with Chavez, Mr. Van Gelder decides that Chavez has to go, and fires him.  The pair has heated words a short time later.  Chavez sees a poisonous snake on the ground nearby and deliberately throws Van Gelder near the snake with predictable results (I doubt there was a real snake that near Cavanaugh, the poor snake would have been petrified).

Unfortunately for Chavez, servant Al-Long (Gisela Werbisek, in her last role) saw the whole sordid snake activity, and she decides to take direct action rather than telling the police after they are summoned.  Being a witch, she pulls out a rare, illegal plant and makes a potion of it that she tricks Chavez into drinking.

The police are summoned and Police Commissioner Taro (Lon Chaney, who is no stranger to weird events) appears.  You would think that Lon Chaney would recognize a were-person when he sees one, and he does, sort of.  As the movie unfolds Taro suspects a weird monster is roaming about killing critters, and he figures it is only a matter of time before the monster kills people.

There are the stereotypical scenes of Chavez as he nears changing into the creature, ending in his full-fledged appearance as (think the title is a clue?) a gorilla!  I have to admit to wondering why the scriptwriter chose a gorilla, given they are not native to South America.  However, some of the stock footage and the sound affects used to show the jungle appeared to be from off-continent as well, so perhaps the director assumed a bit (a lot?) of artistic license.

There are a few dramatic scenes in the jungle, and for a few brief moments it appears as though Chavez and the new Mrs. Dina Chavez, because they quickly tied the knot, might actually leave the jungle.  Of course, this movie would not have a nice moral ending unless Chavez gets his, so Al-Long keeps up the pressure until Chavez wants to swing from the trees on a regular basis.

This movie has a great cast and had a lot of potential.  As a monster movie, it follows too much in the path of such greats as ""The Wolf Man"" and others of the genre and brings little new to that genre.  I was impressed that the director tried to play the movie more as a psychological thriller, but he was insufficiently focused on Chavez and too focused on Chavez's interactions with Dina to bring real believability to the movie.  The result is that the movie never becomes a convincing horror movie or a convincing psychological thriller, and a viewer is left unsatisfied.

I recommend this movie to aficionados of were-creatures, Lon Chaney, Raymond Burr, Woody Strode or Barbara Payton.  Everyone else should probably avoid it.

Not only was Barbara never wearing such a skimpy two piece outfit as shown but even the scene where the gorilla carries her off (and not a moment too soon I might add) but could hardly been seen because of the undergrowth and tree branches. There was far too much stock footage of tigers and monkeys and a few snakes(even killing Barbara s husband off screen) Then there was Barbara dancing, Barbara sleeping, Barbara getting married...it just went on and on complete with horrendous love scenes between Burr and Payton talking about their  undying love for each other. Where was the action ?  well there was nt any !!! Plenty of talk and little else. The whole thing should have been given over to Ed Wood Jr ; then at least we could have had a laugh, maybe Vampira could have flown out of a tree and someone could have dug up Tor Johnson.

1798675,3,B0000714AL,"BRIDE OF THE GORILLA is considerably more interesting for its off-screen details than it is for itself--and most notably so because it was written and directed by Curt Siodmak.

Siodmak (1902-2000) was a well-known writer in the Berlin film industry who fled Nazi Germany for Hollywood in 1937 and whose screenplay was the driving force behind Universal Studio's 1941 THE WOLFMAN. Although the film was a great success, Siodmak was not enthusiastic about the changes Universal made in the script--and a decade later he would incorporate several of his deleted ideas into the independently-produced BRIDE OF THE GORILLA. Chief among these was Siodmak's idea that the transformation between human and beast should be left vague, thus allowing the audience to wonder if the transformation was factual or merely in the victim's mind.

This was in fact the road that RKO's Val Lewton took with great success in the 1940s, but Siodmak's lack of directorial experience, the very low budget, and a very short shooting time (ten days) effectively defeated his intention on the point. Still, BRIDE OF THE GORILLA gives us a very clear notion of how Siodmak originally conceived THE WOLFMAN.

The film is also notable for its cast. Although not well recalled today, Barbara Payton (1927-1967) was a remarkably beautiful woman who seemed poised for major stardom in the late 1940s--but her taste in alcohol and men and her knack for making headlines put her on the skids. By 1951 not a single major Hollywood studio would touch her, but even so her notoriety was enough to command star billing in this ""B"" flick, and in spite of its cheapness and her own train-wreck life BRIDE does allow us to see a glimmer of what the original fuss had been about. Payton would continue to spiral out of control; she would make only five more films and end her life as a street prostitute.

Like Payton, actors Lon Chaney Jr. (1906-1973) and Tom Conway (1904-1963) had previously worked at major studios and were now on their way down, again due in part for their fondness of the bottle; on the other hand, Raymond Burr (1917-1993) was on his way up, building a solid resume on bit and supporting roles and ultimately finding television stardom in the series PERRY MASON and IRONSIDE. Also of interest is actress Gisela Werbisek (1875-1956), who made a long career of playing tiny parts in a host of films that included THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME and LOST WEEKEND.

So far as story is concerned, Payton is unhappily married to a South American plantation owner; when he is killed she unwittingly marries his murderer, plantation foreman Burr. Although Police Commissioner Taro (Chaney) and Dr. Viet (Conway) are certain of Burr's guilt, they cannot prove it, and it falls to the witch Werbisek to serve justice by cursing Burr with the gradual transformation into an ape-like monster.

The dialogue is undistinguished and the production values are pretty non-existent, but even so BRIDE OF THE GORILLA is not nearly so bad as you might expect. Payton is interesting; one wonders what she might have done as an actress if she had not self-destructed. Burr plays wildly over the top, but effectively so, and although Chaney gives his usual clunky performance, both Conway and Werbisek offer solid performances. Even so, this really is a movie best left to fans of ""so bad it's good"" movies. Recommended to them only.

1798676,3,B0000714AL,"If you ever wondered what Raymond Burr did before Perry Mason, this is your film:  it is a masterpiece of the second rate, with a mysterious jungle with its own legends, murder, ill-fated love, and cosmic vengeance.  Looked at in a certain way, it is so bad it is really really good.  The acting is overwrought, but surprisingly strong.  I will not recapitulate the plot, as that would spoil it in my opinion.

This is yet another one of those wonderful b-films we used to watch after school, totally unbelievable, yet somehow psychologically real, at least for kids.  This is very personal, but watching these still gives me a thrill of delight, sometimes the cheesiness makes it even more delectable.

Recommended, particularly for the nostalgia of human imagination's truly grotesque.",1202688000,,787,5.007692307692308
1798717,4,B0000714AL,"For a certain kind of person, and I'm one, this is a film you have to see. First there's the lurid title. Second, Lon Chaney Jr. is in it, and for many fans of classic horror films that makes this an automatic must-see.  Third, Curt Siodmak is writer and director, and this guy commands respect: after all, he wrote The Wolf Man, Donovan's Brain, Earth vs. the Flying Saucers, I Walked With a Zombie, The Beast With Five Fingers...

Unfortunately, though, this movie is pretty pedestrian. It is rather slow-paced, and never fully takes off. Nor is it remotely scary, suspenseful, gory, or lurid. And Lon Chaney's dull role as a native policeman is disappointing.

Understanding that, this movie still has strengths. Tom Conway, brother of the great George Saunders, is very good in his supporting role; I think he really carries the movie. He's onscreen a lot, and always good. Raymond Burr truly gives his best. Barbara Payton is beautiful and sincere. In general, the supporting cast is good-heartedly earnest. And the film does have its moments - some evocative, moody shots and scenes, some strangeness, some surrealistic charm. It is fun, and doesn't drag. It's not painful; it's just ultimately too familiar, too ordinary.

Bottom line: If you love this kind of old, oddball, no-budget horror, there are a lot of titles you should see first. But eventually you will work your way to Bride of the Gorilla, and there is a good chance you will enjoy the 66 minutes and regard it with affection.

Trivia PS: I love these desperately deceptive taglines from the original garish ads (not on this dvd, unfortunately), which have absolutely nothing to do with the film! Indeed, selling a ticket with such promises was downright larcenous. But that's all part of the sideshow-style fun of the world of b-movies and exploitation films, Enjoy.

1798718,4,B0000714AL,"I'm not sure what it was, but when I first saw this film on TV in the early 1960's I was prepared to like it. At that time I was hooked on steamy studio jungle sets & lots of stock footage. All the local TV stations were playing Tarzan, Jungle Jim and Bomba movies in some sort of JUNGLE LARRY(?)THEATER type program. It was great & all the kids loved it!
Now BRIDE OF THE GORILLA comes along with much of the same mix but with a more adult/slanted agenda. Yes, the familar stock footage was there, the fear of a gorilla monster, a witch/voodoo woman, Lon Chaney Jr. and a deadly curse made this absolute viewing, but...this B-horror/thriller had something else going for it: BARBARA PAYTON!
Even as a kid I knew she was much much more.., than Maureen O'Sullivan (Jane/ June Cleaver of Tarzan fame)!
BRIDE OF THE GORILLA is probably Payton's most memorible camp classic, and she's very good in it. She draws sympathy in a role that twists and curves from cheating wife to loving, devoted wife. Raymond Burr (pre Godzilla & Perry Mason), Tom Conway & Lon Jr. are also very good as is Siodmak's  pacing & direction. He directed Chaney 10 yrs. eariler in THE WOLFMAN!
Alas, poor Barbara...
Her life tumbled downhill...I won't dwell on all the sleaze, you can look it up.
However, this is just one fun chiller/thriller, a few curses, a monster thrown in, some good acting and even a bit part by a young Woody Strode.
As for the whole gorilla thing...
I believe it was all in Barney's head, always have, always will.

Raymond Burr actually does a decent job as Barney Chavez, a plantation manager who decides he wants the wife of the plantation owner for himself. In fact the acting is fairly decent all the way around (especially for this era and genre) but the plot bogs down in a very slow romance subplot for the majority of the middle thirty minutes of the film.

In essence Barney commits murder with a giant poisonous snake, and is subsequently cursed by a witch for his unsavory behavior. The practical upshot of this is that we get to see Raymond Burr transmogrify into a gorilla, though it is mostly seen in reflection shots (mirrors, lakes, etc.) Ultimately everyone gets their just rewards, and after what seems like 66 very long minutes, you can try to forget you wasted an hour of your life on this bore.

1798725,2,B0000714AL,"I didn't enjoy this film as much as I thought I would.  I didn't have high expectations for this movie, but I thought with Curt Siodmak and Lon Chaney, Jr., there would be more entertainment here than there really was...written and directed by Curt Siodmak, writer of such films as The Wolf Man (1941), Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man (1943), and Son of Dracula (1943), all three which also starred Lon Chaney, Jr., come together to bring us this bargain basement entry into the occult horror drama genre that was popular in the late 30's and 40's.

Bride of the Gorilla starts out with promise, but soon gets mired in too much melodrama for my tastes.  The story goes an older plantation owner dies through the actions of one of his hired hands, Barney Chavez (Raymond Burr), as the hired hand covets the man's younger wife, Dina (Barbara Peyton).  Commissioner Taro (Lon Chaney, Jr.) investigates, but due to lack of evidence, can't bring a case against Barney.  Where modern law fails, the law of the jungle takes over as an elderly servant woman, who witnessed the death of her boss, and who is also somewhat of a voodoo witch of sorts, extracts poison from the leaves of a rare plant and secretly feeds it to Barney, causing him to turn into a gorilla at times, mostly during the night.

I thought Raymond Burr did alright, when he wasn't chewing up the scenery with his sometimes over the top performance, and Barbara Peyton also played her character serviceably well, even thought she seemed a bit dense at times, I supposed due to a love for Barney that I couldn't quite fathom, as he was quite the jerk.  Lon Cheney, Jr. seemed out of place and miscast as police commissioner Taro, a man of the jungle with a college education who often, through his often-awkward dialogue, struggled with his modern, educated side, and his more primal jungle upbringing.  The dialogue was a bit disjointed at some points, and the use of stock footage a bit too liberal, as it really only served to take me out of the story due to the fact it was so obvious.  And then there was the gorilla suit...for the time, I guess it worked, but I couldn't help think of it looking like one used in a Three Stooges short.  We really didn't get to see it a lot, but when we did, it didn't really convey a sense of danger or suspense, but more of a guy in a fake gorilla suit.  I did like the scenery, as it helped achieve the feel of being in the jungle, surrounded and trapped within a living, breathing entity, and Barbara Payton certainly was attractive to look at whenever she appeared on the screen.  It's unfortunate her career was cut short at the age of 39 due to a combination of heart and liver failure, as her personal life spiraled out of control due to abusive relationships and addiction to alcohol.  She did manage to put out a tell all biography of her life in 1963 titled, ""I Am Not Ashamed"" that detailed her struggles and misery of her life as a Hollywood screen actress.

Mercifully, the movie lasts only 66 minutes, as the end brings about no great surprises.  The print here is pretty good, but it does have a number of noticeable flaws as the picture loses a frame here and there.  There is a trailer at the very end of the movie, but nothing else in the way of special features.  I wasn't expecting a masterpiece here by any means, but I was hoping for a little more given all the talent involved.

Seems a local old crone witnessed the offing of the old man and lays a whammy on the newlywed murderer.  Now he's turning into a gorilla at night.  Or is he?  Also the new marriage is not pure heaven.  Not exactly a horror pic, but not too bad.  The Image Entertainment DVD is probably the best quality available at this time.  Recommended for fans of the genre.",1511654400,,665,4.615384615384615
7973693,3,B0000714AL,"This movie is kind of a middle of the road one for me.  While it is not the worse older horror type movie I have seen, it is not the best either.  It has kind of a strange plot but most of the acting in it is pretty good.  I bought it because it has Lon Chaney, Jr in it and he gives a good performance.  I say if the plot sounds interesting to you, buy it and make up your own mind, I did.",1483660800,,390,3.552941176470588
7973694,5,B0000714AL,"Extremely fun.  (But then I'm a huge fan of Lon Chaney Jr.!)  Chock full of funny innuendo's and heavy-handed foreshadowing, it nonetheless has an intricate and well-thought-out plot line and character development.  Sadly, my favorite actor is probably the least-skilled person on the set, but I still enjoyed it.",1472774400,,313,5.346938775510204
7973695,3,B0000714AL,"If you must have this movie for your collection, go ahead and buy it. BUT ""Digitally Remastered"" is an over statement.  The quality of the film is no better than a copy I purchased used from a video store going out of business.  Somewhat disappointed.",1467158400,,251,4.555555555555555

7973698,4,B0000714AL,"A lovely young voluptuous beauty (Barbara Payton) is married to a grizzled pious old geezer and stuck in the middle of the jungle on a crappy plantation with nary a thing to do.  Enter brutish hulking menacing thug Ramond Burr (as Barney).  ""This is no place for a beautiful woman.""  He wants to take her away from all this.  Her husband notices Barney's unwanted attention towards his wife and fires the lout.  They have an altercation in the garden, one thing leads to another, they trade punches, and Barney's drops the old geezer to the ground where a convenient snake just happens by in time to bite the miserable old stinker as he pleads for Barney's help.  Hardly murder, unless the snake was a willing accomplice, yet that's exactly what the police chief (Lon Chaney Jr.) believes.  But the only witness to this pseudo-crime is the local witch (Gisela Werbisek) who would rather curse Barney than turn him in.  And since curses are so unreliable, she also decides to poison him with a leaf cocktail that induces hallucinations.  Barney is barely married to the lovely young voluptuous widow when he starts cheating on her with the jungle.  ""The jungle is my home!  The animals talk to me.""  Only the local doctor (Tom Conway) realizes Barney is being poisoned.  But he has a conflict of interest.  He also has eyes for the raving beauty.  I guess when you're stuck in a jungle, ""you're spoilt for choice.""

An interesting attempt at horror with few horror elements in play.  It felt more like a soap opera, three guys mooning over the same faithless floozy.  ""Twas beauty that killed the beast!""",1430438400,,1603,4.725631768953068
7973699,4,B0000714AL,"Fascinating voodoo movie, with a perfectly cast Raymond Burr in the lead role. Atmospheric, dreamy. Recommended!",1424390400,,112,6.0625
7973700,4,B0000714AL,"Bride of the Gorilla is just hilarious. Raymond Burr in particular is soooo funny and in such a different role than what he is usually associated with. Watch this one when you need a real LOL and/or have had a bad day and need to forget about it.

The Amazing Transparent Man I didn't watch to the end. When the part came up with testing animals, that was it for me. It's not funny, in reality or in a film, that animals are still being tortured in laboratories in the name of ""science"" and so called progress. I gave that one a miss, for that reason alone.",1423785600,,557,4.205607476635514
