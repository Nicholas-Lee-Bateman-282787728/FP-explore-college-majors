6249058,5,B00I45844W,"This is a dark, funny, bloody film. Crispin Glover and Robert De Niro create completely creepy characters. Rebecca Da Costa is charming and a little scary at the same time. John Cusack is perfect as a killing machine who hides well the bit of life that is left in his heart. But the bit of life is still there. Don't miss this great, gritty movie.",1394409600,4,347,4.3538461538461535
6249059,2,B00I45844W,"THE BAG MAN isn't obviously inspired by PULP FICTION, but it comes close. It is a tale about aggressively quirky characters trading offbeat dialogue between scenes of unflinching violence in a convoluted plot that centers around a special bag into which no one may peek. The man in charge of the bag is Jack (John Cusak riding the same facial expression for most of the film), and he is given the assignment by his long-time boss, Dragna (Robert Deniro playing it oddly low-key for a character with a silver pompadour and a name like Dragna). Jack is to stay with the bag in the 13th room of a creepy-deepy motel and wait for Dragna to come and get it. The assignment turns out to be much harder than that, with everyone getting in on the action, including the wheelchair bound manager of the hotel (Crispin Glover), a couple of hard-nosed cops, and a hooker (with a heart of gold?) named Rivka.

The plot moves forward with our MacGuffin deluxe being the mysterious bag (fun drinking game: count how many times the phrase ""Did you look in the bag?"" is asked), but really what keeps things moving (even if it's just running in place) is Rivka being constantly beaten or threatened. In fact, every bad guy in this film is very clearly established solely by their willingness to hit a woman, including Rivka's pimps, a black guy with an eye patch and a Serb-Croat midget. Naturally.

Technically, the film fails right off the bat because it is filmed with a noir-style darkness, but without allowing any kind of contrast to most scenes, making it near impossible to tell exactly what's going on at any given moment. Fortunately (or not), not a whole lot goes on, as evidenced by the dialogue, which is repetitive to the point of distraction. I assume it was meant to be a stylistic choice -- having characters repeat each other and themselves dozens of times -- but instead of coming across as kooky or stylized or even just amusing, it sounds like the script has no idea where to go next.

""Did you look in the bag?""
""What?""
""Did you look in the bag?!""
""No. Did you look in the bag?""
""Are you asking me if I looked in the bag?""
""Did you?""
""No, I didn't look in the bag.""
""Why didn't you look in the bag?""
""Why didn't YOU look in the bag?""

And so on.

Wasting time and direction that could be used to establish back story or personality, the movie instead spends most of its energy trying to craft a mood that is too sleazy to be clever and too self-aware to be amusing. Or maybe I have that backwards. In any case, when the movie DOES need to hint at a reason for all of its lunacy, it does so with no grace at all, characters announcing their various emotional calling cards, be it a dead wife or whatnot, often doing it with contrived attempts at wittiness that are, fundamentally, pointless. ""I'm a connoisseur of the unexpected, but I hate surprises,"" says Dragna. ""Just because something is inevitable doesn't mean it has to happen,"" says another character. Or they say something like that. I was laughing too hard to write the whole thing down.

I'd give the film one star if I hadn't at least been amused by the intensely understated performances by Cusak and Deniro, and I still got a bit of joy out of watching the derivative script clump along so handily. Still, this isn't a movie that is bound to be enjoyed by many people. First time writer/director David Grovic may have a decent movie in him in the future, but in this case, he leaned too much on his love of Tarantino to come up with anything other than a pale imitation of Tarantino's earliest style, like he was trying to mash-up Cusak's GROSSE POINTE BLANK with Cusak's IDENTITY, creating a film that is a sorry soup of the weakest bits of both of those films.",1394323200,11,3729,4.500738552437223

6249062,4,B00I45844W,"Jack (John Cusack) is instructed by Dragna (Robert De Niro) to pick up a bag and take it to a specific motel and to check into room 13. He is instructed not to look into the bag. Things go bad. We reach a point where he is in the room. He has a dead man in the trunk of his car which doesn't lock. His hand is bleeding where his cell phone was shot out from it. There are two undercover agents next door. He gets entangled with a six foot tall prostitute (Rebecca Da Costa) her one eyed pimp (Sticky Fingaz) and a Serbian midget (Martin Klebba). Cops seem to be everywhere and the motel is run by the creepy Crispin Glover who learned everything he knows about motel management from Norman Bates.

His boss calls him and tells him to read Hermann Hesse ""Magister Ludi"" which loosely relates to the mystery of the circus characters. Then things get weird.

This is a noir style mystery. There are two mysteries here. One is ""What is with all the odd ball characters?"" and the second one is ""What is in the bag?"" I will say I had them both figured out before they were revealed as it fit an oddball formula. However, I grew annoyed with the film, able to feel the frustration of Jack, but not in a good way.

The film has few characters. It has dark humorous elements added to this crime drama thriller. Indeed, the plot alone is darkly comical. The film has a lot of things going for it, and as a fan of the genre, it was able to grab me, but then kept letting me go.

3 1/2 stars. Good rental for those who like a quirky noir mystery.

6249063,2,B00I45844W,"Slow and very talky neo-noir about a hit-man (John Cusack) who is hired by a malevolent gangster (Robert De Niro) to bring a bag to room 13 of a seedy motel and receive an exorbitant amount of cash for his trouble.  Cusack's character is not allowed to look inside the bag under any circumstances.  It turns out a lot of other people are interested in the bag as well and the body count slowly rises--a little too slowly, unfortunately.  The cast is good but the script is so weak that it doesn't really matter much.  The Bag Man generates no tension; it has no memorable action or suspense sequences; it isn't funny and, in the end, it doesn't really make much sense, but it's fairly stylish and has a good cast, which makes it a watchable time-waster.",1394064000,8,753,4.474452554744525

6249087,3,B00I45844W,"This movie has elements of greatness, coupled with moments of a Tarantino rip.  Perhaps the bloodletting didn't quite rise to that of a Tarantino flick, but it brushed right up against it a few times.  Overall, I thought it was an entertaining way to spend a couple of hours, but I'd never include it on a list of movies to watch twice.  DeNiro and Cusack turned in fine performances, as did Rebecca Costa.  The story line held my interest, and the fight scene in the car had me laughing out loud.  I don't regret having spent the time watching this movie, but to me it doesn't deserve more than 3 stars.

If you're a fan of Quentin Tarantino movies, you'll likely rate it higher because it undoubtedly emulates his style - to the point of the director, David Grovic, inserting himself in the film playing the brief role of DeNiro's lawyer.  I am not a fan of the ""murder per minute"" genre, though, so the 3 stars is actually a pretty good rating from me.

The movie held my attention for 10 minutes but took a nosedive soon after he arrives at the seedy motel and chats with the hotel manager.  Very unrealistic movie with an embarrassing attempt to portray this as a noir type film.

The violence was gratuitous.  The plot was non existent. The acting was poor, especially the prostitute.  The scene that takes the cake for me was in the police station.  3 men violate and abuse the hooker stripping her down to her panties and bra.  It was cheap, shameless, and over the top.  The actress was HOT but her career isn't going further than that.  Perhaps pornography would be a better step in the right direction for her stardom.  In the end I wasted 2 hours of my time.  Very predictable outcome. It should be titled:  The Vomit Bag.",1483920000,,864,4.467948717948718

6249092,4,B00I45844W,"Watched this movie because I am a fan of John Cusak and Robert DiNiro.. DiNiro`s coif added a certain un-DiNironess to his very well groomed character who is sinister none-the-less. DiNiro never disappoints, nor does Cusak and the supporting line-up of oddball and creepy characters, namely the motel clerk and the deputy played by Dominic Purcell. His portrayal resonated with me. He was so believable, having dealt personally with many deputies myself. Good ones and scarey ones. Purcell nailed his part. Totally creeped me out. The body language made him all the more sinister. I didn`t care what was in the bag. The point was that the bag was a test. Cusak had to deal with each character he encountered. This is a man who has a job to do, can`t trust anyone. Wonder Woman with her Amazon legginess, quick retorts and cautious/dangerous neediness peaks Jack`s curiousity, yet he stays on his guard. Yes, this movie is reminiscent of Tarantino and Lynch`s noir flicks, but it has a few great and entertaining quirks of its own. Not the least of which is that this is a Character-driven movie. Each character delivers. Top notch acting where each actor`s performance counts makes for a good movie. The sets were spot on. The Louisiana film location worked.

All through the movie Cusack is told not to look into the bag.  Isn't that just an open invitation to do just the opposite?

Crazy characters are interspersed throughout the film including a Serbo-Roma ""short person"", a one eyed pimp named Lizard and a tall woman named Rivka who seems to have no reason to be in the film at all until the very end.

Cusack is usually a really good actor.  While still good in this movie, the movie is as lame as a three legged goat.  Thankfully the editors must have felt the same way and limited this sad piece of ""art"" to little more than 90 minutes.",1449014400,,758,4.295774647887324

6249111,3,B00I45844W,"When Rotten Tomatoes gave this movie a 3.4/10 I figured they were being harsh.  Then I watched it.

John Cusack delivers yet another of his workmanlike, effective performances, but he's surrounded by a bad script, bad dialog, some incredibly hammy overacting by Robert DeNiro, and a depressing, dark setting that wears on you after a while.  THE BAG MAN is populated by a cast of misfits and miscreants, typified by the almost mystical persona of Crispin Glover (who you never know if he's acting or not) mumbling his lines in a southernish drawl from the comfort of an unnecessary wheelchair. The relationship between Cusack and Rivka (Rebecca DaCosta) is interesting and subtly underplayed which is a revelation given their respective ages.

The movie's blood-letting is excessive but since there aren't any sympathetic characters it doesn't register and has little thematic impact. By the time the movie concludes with DeNiro and Cusack painfully arguing about the contents of the bag, we're inclined to scream at the screen, ""Show us already! Put us out of our misery!"".

I keep waiting for Cusack to make THE movie that will put him over the hump. Instead, he's settled into a Nicolas Cageland where the movies are frequent, the money is good, and the roles are lazy and uninspired.  Pass.",1431302400,,1294,4.995348837209303

During a secret meeting, a mob boss gives his hit man a seemingly easy job. Pick up a bag, go to a motel in the middle of nowhere, and wait there until the boss comes to pick it up.

I have a different definition for ""FILM NOIR"" then most.  Film noir is better as: ""Nothing good will ever come of this.""  Where every main character's life is ended, ruined, or lessoned by the haunting incidents which transpire.  For this definition it is 'film noir'.
  Cusack is De Niro's favorite hit man but he's not sure if Cusack has lost his edge.  So DE Niro sends Cusack on a mission.  People are dying everywhere.  The move turns slow- very slow- as Da Costa enters the story.  She and Cusack are stuck in at a flea bag motel.  More people are dying and you can figure out what's actually up.  [If you've not seen many films of this style then the story, and twists, will seem fresh and tricky]  The ending starts with ""Well, this was all a test because I wasn't sure if you still had it- in you- and if I could trust you.""

6249132,2,B00I45844W,"What is it with John Cusack playing an emotionless villain for hire?  I mean, obviously Grosse Point Blank is one of the greatest hitman roles of all time, but he's played the same type of highly competent, mostly aloof criminal in War Inc., The Paperboy, Drive Hard, The Prince... he's played this role so much that it seems like he's on autopilot a bit.  But when Cusack on cruise control is the best part of your film, there's a significant problem in execution here.

I was attracted to this movie because of the names on the cover: I'd watch Robert De Niro and John Cusack narrate a phone book, let alone star against each other in a cat-and-mouse heist thriller.  This wasn't false advertising, either: De Niro only appears briefly at the start of the film, but he's present through a large part of the final act.  When I saw that the supporting cast included Crispin Glover and Prison Break's Dominic Purcell, I was excited that I might have stumbled upon a direct-to-DVD gem.  Alas, that wasn't to be the case.

The plot was interesting enough, as long as you try not to think about things too hard.  For instance, I was annoyed in the opening scene when Cusack pulled a dead body and a shovel out of his car *right on the side of the road*.  I don't know, I'm no assassin, but maybe pull the car somewhere that you won't be illuminated by passing headlights?  Cusack also goes through a three-minute sequence wherein he bursts into a hotel room and assassinates two men (one of whom had knocked on his door in a suspicious way), then immediately chooses not to kill a woman who snuck into *his* room and went through the loot he'd stolen.

I can actually kind of relate to that decision, because the female protagonist (Rebecca Da Costa) is gorgeous, although it was puzzling that she was eventually asked to attempt a Russian accent.  I thought Cusack and Purcell were the strongest actors in the film, while Glover... I mean, I get what he was trying to do, but I wish the director would have asked him to dial back the overt creepiness a bit.  He was basically playing a caricature.  His dialogue included lines like, ""You're either a contrarian or a victim,"" and ""You shouldn't have done that, Mr. Smith.  You shouldn't have touched my wheelchair.  It belongs to my dead mother.""  Ugh.  I can't even judge the acting of another featured player, erstwhile rapper Sticky Fingaz, because his lines were so ridiculous that even the '70s version of De Niro couldn't have delivered them believably.

The movie's watchable, thanks mostly to Cusack.  But it's difficult to root for him -- he's a mostly unsympathetic protagonist.  The special effects were fine, but at times the screen was so dark that the on-screen action was difficult to decipher.  The plot progresses in twists and turns, but some of the twists are visible a mile away, and De Niro's ultimate motivation for sending Cusack to be his bag man is... well, it doesn't hold up to scrutiny.  There are better things you could do with your time.",1421798400,,3014,4.634651600753296

6249166,3,B00I45844W,"John Cusack is ""Jack,"" a torpedo for Robert De Niro, who is a mob boss named ""Dragna.""  Dragna gives Jack an odd assignment of obtaining a bag, and waiting for him in room 13 of a creepy country motel, and, most important, not looking in the bag.  Once Jack takes the assignment, it seems like everyone knows about the bag and is out to get it and kill Jack in the process.

The motel seems like a set-up.  Everyone there is awake and outside and asking Jack questions for no apparent reason.  Jack, who is something of an paranoid psychopath, handles the situation with efficiency and extreme prejudice, except for the ""hooker with the heart of gold"" who he befriends.

The story was slow going for all the but the last thirty minutes, when De Niro shows up to collect the bag. It's clear that everyone but everyone knows about the bag, but not a clue is offered as to how or why.  When De Niro shows up, and particularly in the last five minutes, we finally get an explanation for the logic of the plot.

The problem is that by that time, we are long past caring.  We probably like Jack for his cool efficiency and quirky mannerisms, but as a character he's a total cypher. For example, it turns out that it is critical for understanding ""WTF"" is going on that he had a fiance who was killed. But we find this out only after we find out the answer to the mystery. This is fundamentally bad writing and a violation of the basic contract of the mystery movie with the audience, i.e., nothing will be pulled out of the bag at the end that was not presented during the movie.

So, it is ultimately a frustrating movie. But it is not the worst attempt at noir I've seen lately.  The story is action-filled, but as for figuring out what is going on, that's not going to happen because the clues are withheld from the audience.",1406419200,,1822,4.3609467455621305

All kinds of people are after the bag and it is obvious to us all, including Cusack, that his boss is sending them to kill him.  Still he waits for De Niro to arrive and pay him - why?  With the aid of a six foot prostitute he sticks it out without ever looking in the bag.  Not a very good story, but people that enjoy dark action will enjoy it for entertainment and the cast.

The Bag Man is an excellent film.  The plot provides twists, keeps the tension high, sustains a lot of mystery till the very end, and populates the setting with interesting and dangerous characters.  The acting is top notch.  Except for the pimp.  The dialogue is different, interesting, and fun.  There are no corny sex scenes, no corny love triangles, no Hollywood overdone action.  And every scene in this movie serves the story, and looks great.

This is not The Avengers or The Expendables.  The action is realistic.  The characters are mysterious and novel--weird even.  The plot requires you sit and think as you enjoy stellar performances.  Yet the plot is, at its core, simple and satisfying!

A few things you don't want to miss: (POSSIBLE SPOILERS)

1) Best death of a pimp ever.
2) Best fight in a police station.
3) Best Robert Di Nero villain ever.
4) Twisted ending.
5) Best joke about a guy in a wheelchair.
6) Best surprise from a weird guy in a wheelchair.

If this sounds like a potential David Lynch film it falls short in the irony department.  The film is wacky but doesn't achieve the sublimely surreal status of, say, ""The Usual Suspects"".  I liked the turns by De Niro which recalls his Louis Cypher character in ""Angel Heart"" and Glover's portrait of another patented nutcase that seem to be his stock-in-trade since ""Back to the Future"".  If I could fault the film it would be that director David Grovic could have tightened things up a bit to enhance the tension.

Clumsy and tiresome noir that, at least to me, harkens back to the neon glut 1980s and 90s which produced a stunning array of similar flicks.

What made this mildly enjoyable, and tolerable at all, was John Cusack.

In this production, he plays general contractor Jack - the guy who does whatever needs doing. In this case he's been ordered to pick up a bag, drive said bag to a craphole motel and deliver it to his client. Simple.

In truth, he doesn't want the assignment. But three things preclude him from walking away.

First, he wants the money. Second, once you say 'no' to the clients that hire for these kinds of jobs, it usually means you're not going to get another call. Third, his client is the rare type of employer for whom saying 'no' isn't an option. You're going to do the job or you become the next job.

Like every noir - the paranoid itch only gets worse as the movie goes on. Jack quickly suspects that his client set this entire thing up just to mess with him. Why? What did he do so wrong that it would warrant an all-out gaslight of a bogus contract?

Bodies begin piling up as he attempts to figure out what's really at play. Most importantly, does he have enough bullets to last the night?

Overall, a retread and rubberstamp flick with little to offer. Made more obvious since this is David Grovic's first directorial film of any kind.

Cusack did his energetic best to save this from the flushable ceramic bowl - for his effort alone I'm almost willing to bump this an additional very low third star. Almost.

Two star pile, hit the plunger.

Personal Note:

- It's my sense that Grovic is very much like ""filmmaker""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mick-Rossi/dp/B0010BCHKO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mick Rossi</a>. Essentially, a person with money to burn and now wants to spend it. Most of this stripe go the executive producer route, but every so often you get one that reaches way beyond their limited abilities and wants to become a star. Best said while mimicking Gloria Swanson in 'Sunset Boulevard'.

- The single most interesting aspect to this flick: The inclusion of De Niro in the cast. What in the world would prompt him to do a cameo? My understanding is that his various investments and the continual movie roles being offered certainly cover his expenses. So I'm very curious what his motivation was for doing this schlock piece?

The beginning of the movie felt weird scene and pacing wise. It felt like some chunks of the story were cut out. It felt like you started viewing a movie that had already started and skipped ahead 15 minutes. I think i even remember seeing more in the trailer that didn't end up in the actual movie. (Hate it when they do that) But once the story arrives at the hotel then everything feels fine and the story / pacing moves along just fine.

For the story itself, it was alright, i don't regret watching it. But i would not call it great. They didn't bring anything new to the table. Two actors had to carry the rest. I didn't feel there were any twist because the trailer telegraphed the entire plot including what people are calling the twists.

8639049,5,B00I45844W,"Oh gee, this movie sucks.  Here I thought I was watching ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" or maybe it was ""The Ten Commandments,"" and what do I get, I get a crap load of gratuitous violence, a sexy prostitute played by a sexy actress who can't act, some kind of wack-job plot I haven't been able to figure out, and no parting of the Red Sea -- what a rip-off!!

Actually, I liked it!  A lot more than I did the other two movies.  Cusack and De Niro are a good combination, one as a . . . well, bag man, with a twisted sense of ethics, the other as a mob boss with a twisted enthusiasm for abusing his employees.  The whole bag thing (what's in it?) adds a level of semi-Hitchcockian zaniness to an otherwise not particularly Hitchcockian plot. The story is as twisty as it needs to be and not one twist more, ending, for those who view it closely, on an ambiguous note.  Another reviewer aptly compares it to Tarantino, and even more aptly observes that it is more like Tarantino-lite, in terms of the level of violence (which is still considerable), the long-windedness of characters at climactic moments, and the general sense of sleazy existential goofiness.  I find it completely successful as an update of a typical noir-ish formula.  Cusack is very good in a role which requires him to be sly and stupid at the same time.  De Niro's acting takes a guignolish lurch toward the end, but that's ok in this type of flick.  I even liked the non-acting of Rebecca Da Costa, one of the more attractive non-actresses I have had the pleasure of watching lately.  On the basis of her performance, I believe that she could make a very fine prostitute indeed, were that her ambition.  An excellent noir movie, especially if you don't take it too seriously.

Superior credit rolling swamp-rocker, ""I Got Loaded"" by L'il Bob and the Lollipops!  By all means, check it out on YouTube.",1519862400,,1864,4.508928571428571
8639050,1,B00I45844W,"The plot was way too thin to develop a movie around.

And the nonsensical idea that a crime boss like De Niro who HIRES super assassins to do his dirty work and then turns out to be insanely better himself is just a dumb leap of logic.",1513987200,,235,4.0
