2463915,5,B000CFX5I2,"Some will look at the price of this DVD and simply say it's too much. Besides, they know all they care to know about Mozart's sad life.  Plus, they've seen the 1984 movie, ""Amadeus,"" and how could anything top that?  Finally, the music is over 200 years old.  Isn't it passe at this time?

To pursue these and other questions I would urge any music lover to take the plunge and buy this DVD.  You won't regret the decision.  Sure, you'll keep wondering why it all happened.  Why such genius was taken out of the world at the young age of 35?  Why didn't he have people around him to take care of him? Why didn't more people nurture the musical genius that touches us so long after his death?

What you do come away with is an appreciation of what Mozart did during his short, 35 years on Earth.  How a tiny, sickly child composed masterpieces at the age of five.  How Mozart could move his little fingers with such dexterity that almost defy medical science.  How one human being could compose one masterpiece after another and finally count over 600 master works to his credit.

The DVD contains some of the most sublime music ever conceived by mortal man.  (Of course, some people insist that Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was not a mortal man, but that's another subject altogether).  Samples from the piano concerti, #5, #17, #20, #24, and #27 are there, along with parts of the violin concerti, the clarinet concerto, the flute concerto, and various sonatas and chamber pieces.  Excerpts from seven of Mozart's operas are also included, including ""The Marriage of Figaro,"" ""Don Giovanni,"" and ""The Magic Flute."" The DVD claims to have 80 musical pieces represented and I would not doubt it.

A ""making of"" feature is included which was really very good.  In it, the director, Phil Grabsky, reveals that he took two full years to produce this recording and did the vast bulk of filming and editing himself. This must have been a gargantuan task and one for which he knows can easily be criticized.  For example, he says he omitted the famous horn concerto from the DVD because it didn't fit in the flow and he was trying to get the movie down to around 2 hours. A critic might say that he might have inserted a  snippet of this wonderful piece of music to further show how Mozart really was a master of all instruments in the orchestra at that time.

Grabsky was asked, as he'd asked others, what was his favorite of Mozart's compositions.  He vaguely mentions Figaro, Don Giovanni, and the Magic Flute, but then tries to wriggle off the hook.  He said that was what happened when he interviewed such people as Jonathan Miller, Roger Norrington, Charles Mackerras, et al.  Grabsky does say that one of the musicians said there is something about the harmonic combinations Mozart uses that makes his work so advanced and superior to other composers of his time.  But I think we're owed a little more than that.  For me a list of favorites starts with the piano concerti.  And to be more specific, #20 and #24, are the most powerful symphonic pieces Mozart ever composed.  I can't hear them today without some sort of emotional reaction.  I don't know if it's sadness, anger, joy, or all these things wrapped up in one.  There's simply something other-worldly about this music which transcends time and space.  For the uninitiated, get Rudolf Buchbinder's DVD's with these and the other major piano concerti.  Then, you might even buy the other Mozart piano concerti on DVD, as I've done. After seeing and hearing, you'll know what I mean.

Phil Grabsky also stresses the point, that Leopold Mozart, Wolfgang's father, was not the money-grubbing parent who simply exploited his two gifted children in order to make money.  Much to the contrary, Leopold virtually sacrificed his own life for the betterment of mankind in nurturing Wolfgang's genius.  Leopold's goal was to educate Wolfgang throughout Europe with the various musical styles and methods of the day.  Rather than the villain, as most would have us believe, Leopold was actually the single most important force in making Wolfgang grow and develop.  The end result is that we can appreciate his sounds so far in the future.  Similarly, Wofgang's wife, Constanze, is not shown to us as the bawdy young thing that appeared in the famous movie.  Without her care and devotion to Mozart's memory, declares Mr. Grabsky, his compositions would not have been preserved for us.  For that we owe Constanze great praise.

There is the obligatory bathroom humor we saw in ""Amadeus,"" but it's not overdone, thank heavens.  Such humor mostly takes the form of readings from Mozart's letters to his parents and other family members.  Apparently, it wasn't unusual for people to talk about these things in public or in writing.  After all, there was no indoor plumbing and sanitary conditions were largely wishful thinking at this time.

Narrated mainly by the British actress Juliet Stevenson, with Samuel West (as the voice of Mozart), and others, the film moves smoothly along from one European city to another.  Many of the buildings that Mozart occupied and performed in are still extant, even after the world wars.  We see and hear the fabulous music composed by this man and the development that occurred as he grew older and even more proficient with this skills.

Sadly, the documentary ends with Mozart succumbing to rheumatic fever and kidney failure at the age of 35.  This may or may not be the true story.  There was program on the Discovery Health Network, a few years ago, part of the ""Medical Mysteries"" series.  It made a convincing case that Mozart actually died from eating tainted pork.  He had all the symptoms of someone who had contracted Trichinosis and I believe that was the real cause of Mozart's death.

Summing up, if you are a Mozart fan, you must get this DVD.  If you're not, get it and you will be one for life.

2463917,5,B000CFX5I2,"This is an outstanding DVD. Like its fellow production ""In search of Beethoven"", the DVD is a thoroughly researched documentary about the life and work of a musical genius. The production is intersperced with musical passages from Mozart's compositions which are performed by outstanding artists. Also there is commentary from musicologists who have studied the life and music of the composer. The effect of this commentary together with frequent flashes of the many excellent portraits  of the composer makes one feel that he is a living presence.",1262995200,8,548,5.2988505747126435
2463918,5,B000CFX5I2,"Many in North America hold views of Mozart's life that are strongly influenced by the smashing film Amadeus. Embarking upon his 128 minute, feature length documentary - In Search of Mozart, director Phil Grabsky soon discovered a man who was a far cry from the one many of us carry about in our minds. Grabsky's work is quite simply a tour de force journey through Mozart's life. Compiling around 70 of Mozart's compositions, traveling to the prominent locations in his life, and interviewing musicians, singers, and conductors about their experiences with Mozart the man as felt through his music, Grabsky has single-handedly assembled what is quickly becoming a classic.

With little experience in classical music, opera, or even knowledge of Mozart and his work, Grabsky set out to track down the man through his personal correspondence, and the works that most closely correlate with pivotal events in his life. As a result, many `minor' works are included, with many of Mozart's best-known sound bites excluded - there is no ""Eine Kleine Nachtmusik"" to be found here. What there is includes beautifully filmed, passionate musical performances, glimpses into the roads Mozart traveled, and a sharing of the man's own words through his correspondence.

I found myself perpetually amazed by the beauty and quality of the work, which was filmed mainly by two cameras manned by Grabsky himself. At times an additional two cameras were rented, but Grabsky's work is a wonderful showcase for simple, affordable filmmaking. The exception is the low-key half-hour director's interview, which though fascinating - could have benefited greatly from an additional camera to avoid holding on Grabsky for such a long time through a single angle.

Like Mozart himself, the film has an international flavor. In his travels across Europe, Grabsky made no attempt to encourage his interviewees to converse in English, providing subtitles as needed. The DVD is also region free; in addition to English, it has subtitles available in Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, and Spanish, befitting of a Dubrovnik International Film Festival Winner.

Casting aside all dramatic pretense, Grabsky's Mozart is hard working, devoted to his family, and above all, feels deeply. No efforts are made to hide Mozart's sporadic crude jests, but set into context it appears that such private correspondences between family members were common in his extended family, and do not denote a lack of culture on his part. These brief references, some saucy letters to his wife, and veiled references in letters to his father place the unrated documentary into the PG category. His penchant for cards and billiards is also touched upon, but without letting his fondness for the activities mar his character.

Grabsky set out to direct the documentary he would have wanted to watch before he embarked upon this project. I believe he's met his goal of making an accessible, yet comprehensive documentary that touches upon the major character traits and defining events and relationships in Mozart's life with a good amount of historical accuracy. I certainly won't hesitate to recommend In Search of Mozart to those seeking a general overview of Mozart the man, as well as Mozart the music.",1262217600,20,3259,5.211832061068702
2463919,5,B000CFX5I2,"I have had more than a passing interest in Mozart for many years and have read several of the biographies and seen other video biographies, so it was with great pleasure that, taking a bit of a chance on this rather pricey new film, I have found what I believe to be the best single introduction to this somewhat enigmatic musician's life. Weaving musical performances with authoritative interviews w/ musicians and historians (no talking heads here!), the filmmaker explores the life and times of Mozart and brings the viewer into the present and provides, I believe, answers as to why Mozart's music lives on for us today. The interview with the Director, which I watched after seeing the film, is very informative and revealing of an extraordinary person who has not only guided the project, but also personally filmed a lot of what is seen.

Performers, conductors, composers all discuss and show the pieces - explaining them in understandable terms. Some interviewees, esp. Stanley Sadie, are quite well known Mozart researchers, so the film also tries to give a reasonably accurate portrayal of the times and conditions of Mozart's life.

""The artist will move future generations when the bones of kings have long since mouldered away""

The above quotation (uttered in 1792) is found at the very end of this exceptional documentary about the relatively short life of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756 to 1791).  It was made to celebrate the 250TH anniversary of Mozart's birth.

The great feature about this film is that it is factual, dispelling many of the myths that have been perpetuated about Mozart through the centuries.

Also, this film covers quite adequately the major parts of his life.

Mozart had tremendous international success as a child prodigy.  Despite this success, he found it singularly difficult to achieve the patronage or employment his musical genius deserved.  Thus, Mozart had financial difficulties but still found the time to get married.  The final year of his life was actually a ""fabulous"" year for Mozart.

Something of the miraculous hovers over and in the music of Mozart.  His masterful melodic writing, his elegance of style, and his rich orchestral colours sound effortless.  This deceptive simplicity is the art that conceals his musical art.

In this film, there are over 80 interviews (with historians, conductors, musicians, etc.), over 70 performances (brief excerpts), and 7 operas (brief excerpts).  This biography-documentary was filmed in 11 countries and took about 2 1/2 years to complete.

Besides the music, I also enjoyed the brief excerpts from letters that were written by Mozart himself.

As well, this documentary is beautifully filmed.

Finally, the DVD (the one released in 2008) itself has one major extra.  It is an excellent interview with writer and director Phil Grabsky that lasts over half an hour.

In conclusion, this is the film to see if you want to know the facts about the life of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart!!

2463978,5,B000CFX5I2,"Being a classically trained violinist (specializing in Mozart) and singer, I must say--this is, arguably, the most honest, factual retrospective of Wolfgang Mozart's ""inner"" and ""outer"" life I've had the pleasure to see and hear. Filled with music, (the ONLY music for me) that feeds the soul, fires the spirit, is chaste and virginal, is naughty, seductive, and playful; quite simply, THE all-encompassing musical experience. I respect, admire, and applaud the producer/s and writer/s of this documentary. Never did it languish and linger on the tragedies of Mozart's life. Of course within the context of the film, they shared the good, bad, and the ugly to illustrate the frustrations and difficulties Mozart experienced. The heartache, the heartbreak. His mood swings were well-apparent, especially in his music. While viewing I found myself mesmerized by the deeply intelligent and personal insights the speakers expressed. You just don't find that often if at all. ""Musicologists"" and ""historians"" will inject a hideous snobbery into Mozart's personality that is maddening and did not exist. I'm so pleased this very issue was addressed in the piece.

I've devoured at least twenty Mozart biographies (if not more), many biographies on the Weber family (there is quite an amazing dynamic there!), and I've lost count of how many times I've read ""The Letters of Mozart and his Family"" edited by Emily Anderson. Regarding the latter, even Ms Anderson tried to ""tone down"", if you will, ""The Basle Letters"" (to his cousin). Mozart has long been criticized for his ""scatology"", ""dirty mind"", ""obsession with toilet humor"", and his sexual and emotional relationship with his cousin. One must bear in mind the time of which I speak--1777'ish Austria/Germany. There was no false modesty nor prudishness in the Mozart family. Sex and physicality was openly and unashamedly discussed. Contrary to the scenes in the Milos Forman film ""Amadeus"" which took that theme and ran away with it. Mozart would NEVER have chased Constanze around the chamber, crawling on the floor all the while kissing her decollete! He certainly WELL knew how to conduct himself at court. Though, it's true he did express frustration and arrogance when speaking with the Prince Archbishop of Salzburg about him being displeased with Mozart. You know, I'd like to say a few things about the film ""Amadeus"" as considerable time was devoted to the producers/writers opinion of it.

I happened to adore ""Amadeus"". Historical inaccuracies and all. Why? Because the film's intent was to be a ""fantasia"" based on the life of Mozart. It was NEVER meant to be nor was it implied to be a literal biography. For me, therein lies its genius. Using only the music of Mozart (Woferl and Leopold) and Salieri as the complete score to BRILLIANT effect. Bravo Sir Neville Marriner and Mr Forman! And not just ""using"" that music but creating the most incredible tapestry of perfect songs to support the scenes. I did not, however, care for the way Constanze was portrayed. Historians continue to portray her as an over-sexed, dimwitted twit unworthy of Mozart the man, musician, and genius. It's quite true Mozart was in love with Constanze's sister Aloysia, even after his marriage to Constanze. But a tender connection and deep love did develop between them. Constanze did not possess Wolfgang's sophistication and worldliness, however, don't think for a moment she was an idiot. Far, far from it. For one, she had a beautiful soprano voice and could handle his music. Mozart once wrote Leopold describing Constanze along these lines: her entire beauty consists of a cute figure and two little black eyes...and she loves me with all her heart and will make me so happy. He praised her practicality and frugality (I do believe the seeds of those traits existed then but they certainly ripened as she grew older). There were several occasions Mozart ""gently"" scolded her public behavior at the Baden spa where other men were concerned. On the other hand, Herr Mozart's dalliances and ""falling in love"" with his leading ladies is well-known.

No one loves Mozart more than I, however, I've always seen him as a MAN, NOT a GOD. Who possibly was more human than Wolfgang Mozart? He also knew Leopold did NOT like the Webers, saw them as gold diggers, and didn't want his son to have anything to do with them. Wolfgang definitely knew how to manipulate, especially his father. Leopold was a master manipulator himself and knew just what to say to evoke guilt. At any rate, Mozart often told his father what he thought he wanted to hear, though often times his father saw through the ruse. At this point I do have to mention one of the most touching, beautiful acts on Mozart's part which illustrates his love for his father. When Mozart and his mother were in Paris and his mother took ill and died, Mozart wrote his father and told him his mother had been ill (she had already died, actually) and tried his best to break the news to him gently. He tried to prepare him for the inevitable death news he had to share. What brought me to tears about that letter was Mozart's earnest attempt to comfort his father...reminding him that ""no matter what happens she's in God's hands"". It was in his next correspondence to his father that he confessed his mother had died. That showed an integrity, sensitivity, and strength of character so incredibly beautiful. My last thought on ""Amadeus""--for those whose enjoyment/appreciation of the film was tainted by historical inaccuracies, may I suggest watching an interview with Milos Forman in which he clearly states his vision for the film. He makes it abundantly clear ""Amadeus"" is NOT a biography and should not be considered as such. I own all versions of ""Amadeus"" and I know this interview is part of bonus material on The Director's Cut. However, if you don't own that but would like to see the interview, I would certainly imagine it's available via YouTube. In my opinion, ""Amadeus"" can only be fully enjoyed and appreciated when your mind is open and you understand facts, people, places, and events are definitely manipulated, created, and recreated. It's helpful to remember, as well, that ""Amadeus"" began as a stage play roughly one hour long by Pushkin called ""Mozart und Salieri"". First ""Mozart und Salieri"", then ""Amadeus"" on Broadway, then the film.

To close, ""In Search of Mozart"" was a delightful surprise. This isn't just another rehash of information taken from here, there, and everywhere--it's obvious a tremendous amount of thought, integrity, and fairness went into every aspect of the production of this film. From pre-to-post-production. I don't know how this one escaped me for so long but I'm thankful I had the privilege of seeing it tonight. Adagio, Everyone...",1373155200,,6783,5.0

of Mozart didn't leave me as devastated as the ""Amadeus"" ending, although
it was just so incredibly sad for Mozart to die at such a young age.  We lost
a real genius when he died.
The video was well written, well acted and the music was wonderful....even
on my Kindle!",1363824000,,415,4.52
2463999,4,B000CFX5I2,If you have ever wanted to learn more about Mozart and his extraordinary life...this is absolutely the documentary to see!!,1363651200,,123,5.2
2464000,5,B000CFX5I2,Mozart was such a genius that his life and compositions will always be interesting to me.  I love his music.,1362355200,,108,4.4
2464001,5,B000CFX5I2,I enjoyed the detail that went into exploring the boy to the man. I also appreciated the story of his father.,1361836800,,109,4.238095238095238
2464002,5,B000CFX5I2,A very nice exploration of one of history's greatest musical geniuses.  It attemps to get to the real man behind the Amadeus myth which has been so firmly planted by the movie.  Very enlightening and somewhat poignant given how short his life was.,1361491200,,247,4.72093023255814
2464003,5,B000CFX5I2,I highly recommend this engrossing documentary on the life of Mozart. It is filled with his music played and explained by some of our most classical professionals and seamlessly tells the story of his life in such a manner as you are left somehow with the feeling you've seen a dramatic film version of his life. I will definitely come back to this documentary again in the future.,1359590400,,381,4.617647058823529
2464004,5,B000CFX5I2,"Very well done. I always appreciate a documentary that doesn't treat it's audience like an idiot, but this one is superb. The performances are fantastic and the story is fascinating.  And while I could never understand his musical genius, I came away from this film feeling like I understood the man.",1356566400,,300,4.882352941176471
2464015,5,B000CFX5I2,Very interesting story behind the story of Mozart. Intreguing and a fun adventure.  Mozart was promoted by his father but was able at a young age to sell himself.,1355270400,,162,4.586206896551724
2464016,5,B000CFX5I2,"Informative, entertaining and communicates to the audience in such a way, that you do not need to be a historian or professional musician to understand.  Illustrative visually, musically, and emotionally by a first class series of interviews and presenters.

Approaches Mozart as a child, an entertainer, a composer, a musician, a father, and a dedicated husband.

Very creative.  I would highly recommend this to anyone regardless of their knowledge of classical music or age.",1354233600,,477,5.405405405405405
2464017,2,B000CFX5I2,"It is a bit ponderous.  I ordered it for my AP English Language and Composition Class, and I am afraid that it will not be what they need to analyze it for Documentary as Rhetoric.  While I can appreciate its beauty, they will probably be bored.",1354233600,,245,4.304347826086956
2464018,4,B000CFX5I2,"As you would expect, the music is exquisite. This movie is also quite wonderful. It is a documentary of Mozart's life and quite technical in its explanation of his genius. It begins quite naturally with his childhood and the difficulties his father undertook to get that genius understood. This movie is inundated with subtitles but they worth suffering through if you want t5o learn a little more about this astounding individual. I recommend that you watch the movie Amadeus before watching this as this will dispel some of the myths set forth by that movie and instil a curiosity about the man. While Amadeus was an unquestionably fantastic film it really provides an unrealistic version of the person. It does however instil a thirst to learn more about Mozart's life and this documentary provides the viewer with knowledge that cannot be obtained in the confines of a dramatic interpretation that was designed to entertain the uneducated viewer. If you are ready to learn whatever you can about Mozart, I would recommend this movie.",1353542400,,1037,5.0
2464019,4,B000CFX5I2,"I wasn't sure what to expect but Mozart was a beautifully filmed musical tribute to the life of a favorite composer. It was eye opening and contained a substantial wealth of information on the life and times of Mozart and his family. Very different from anything else out there. Very accurate and well developed biography. I loved the cameos by composers, conductors, and musicians along with portions of the compositions that made Mozart the most amazing composer.",1352937600,,465,5.0519480519480515
2464020,5,B000CFX5I2,"This is a very well done and polished production.  I have read a fair amount about Mozart, but I still learned some things about his life, and some of the influences on his musicianship, such as his exposure to the very rich Mannheim music culture on his trip there.  There are many insightful interviews from pianists, conductors, etc.  Along the way you get some insight into Mozart's compositional genius, his stunning ability to hear a complex piece and memorize it, his views on his world, his earthy humor,and of course there is much exposure to his music, though in snippets and not any whole pieces.  I appreciated the reminders how new and different and bold some of Mozart's music was to his first time listeners.  What is 'classical' to us was fresh and in some cases hard to comprehend to the audiences of the day.  Highly recommended to classical music lovers.  This one streams free to Amazon prime members.",1351296000,,921,4.754716981132075

All of the above were purchased as a gift to my friend, who was greatly interested in having them.

The Mozart and disk #1 of the Beethoven DVD refused to go beyond the ""warning"" screen on the disks.

And Amazon quickly sent replacements.

===========================================================

As before, the Haydn and disk #2 of the Beethoven pair worked just fine on her VISIO player.

And as before, the Mozart and disk #1 of the Beethoven DVD replacements refused to go beyond the ""warning"" screen on the disks.

We have successfully played and re-played the Haydn and several of the dozen-or-so other DVD's that we have for this relatively-new and seldom-operated VISIO player.

And have had very experienced users come over to try to get the Mozart and the Beethoven #1 disks to play -- without success.

Fortunately for the manufacturer, the Haydn, Mozart and both Beethoven's play just fine on my iMac 27 computer.

Given that this is a repeat of the initial problem, I have decided to keep the DVD's for play on my iMac rather than again go through the process of asking for replacements that are unlikely to work on my friend's otherwise working VISIO player.

Which, of course, leaves my friend -- for whom they were intended -- wanting.

=========================================================

There appear to be several re-issues of these same DVD's on the market.

ALL by the same manufacturer.

In spite of the success on the iMac, I still suspect that what I described above is a manufacturing problem and NOT a VISIO player problem.

And would certainly like to see a solution.

2464022,5,B000CFX5I2,"excellent documentary on the life of Mozart and the places where he was active. Also of interest are the various younger generation (some not so young) musicians from around the world who are viewed performing M's music and commenting about it.  Views of contemporary productions of Mozart's operas are also very informative.
  The producer's monologue response in the special features section was  bit dreary.  Better to have a real dailogue between two heads.",1330560000,,461,5.260273972602739
2464023,4,B000CFX5I2,This is pretty thorough and is presented well.  The language used (albeit authentic if you follow the Mozart family letters) makes this somewhat questionable for student viewing.,1299888000,,178,5.592592592592593
2464024,5,B000CFX5I2,"I'd seen the ""In search of Beethoven"" before and that was awesome. This DVD is equally great. Many great testimonials and accounts from musical historians, leading musicians and conductors about Mozart's life, his work, etc. It is a chronological recap of Mozart's life, from childhood to his eventual death. They accompany a story about a particular part of his life with the work he composed around that time too, which gives you great insight into why some of the melodies have melancholy undertones or are bright and cheerful melodies! A great buy!",1299110400,,552,5.010869565217392

8098915,4,B000CFX5I2,"This is a reasonable review of Mozart's life with samplings of his music ordered chronologically and images of the various places he performed or worked.  The music samplings were snippets only.  The sound was fine and the visual quality (sharpness, color saturation, etc) was fine.  There was an extended interview with the director who also did his own camera work.  I did not care for the extensive use of extreme closeups.  I am not sure that the interior or mouths or sweat adds to the story that was told.",1517788800,,511,4.696629213483146
8098916,5,B000CFX5I2,"Unlike most of my videos, this is one that I can watch over and over  any day .  This is no ordinary  biography of Mozart.  It's a lavish musical tribute that chronicles his life, from birth to death, with copious excerpts from live performances and readings from letters to his father, sister and wife.  Year by year, what did Mozart create?  What was happening in his life at that time?  Where did he live?  How was his music received by the public and by critics?  How did he actually die?  All this beautifully documented with video footage of cities he visited and in which he performed, and by expert commentaries from musical historians and performers (in English or German with subtitles).  It has something of value for everyone, whether one wants to learn who he really was and what life was like in 18th century Europe (i.e., an antidote to ""Amadeus""), or how to interpret particular pieces, or just to relax and enjoy the goregous live performances.  The DVD was expensive, but well worth the money, considering that performers had to be scheduled to play at designated times and paid for their efforts  no trivial task pulling all that together. .  Some of the footage was from actual performances for audiences, and some of it needed to be especially staged for the production of the DVD.",1517270400,,1302,4.70353982300885
