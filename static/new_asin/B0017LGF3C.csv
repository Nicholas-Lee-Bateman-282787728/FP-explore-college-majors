They are beautiful, the water is so warm as in Greece. The spots he visited are the right ones. He also showed the great effort and success of Venezuela in music with the Orchestra of young kids. Great job.",1362355200,,377,4.712121212121212

8266365,5,B0017LGF3C,"If you are venezuelan or you are interested in this country, this is a must see. Ian Wright is a lot of fun and they show the positive things about the country, the people and the culture. Just the oposite of what you watch in the news. I was still living there in 2001 when the video was made. It may be a little different now but as a venezuelan, I totally recommend watching this video (specially if you are thinking about visiting the place).",1306972800,,446,4.258823529411765
8266366,1,B0017LGF3C,I used to like Globe Trekker until they totally trashed Colombia.  They will show in the Colombia segment how to make cocaine.  I am not kidding.  This is the worst kind of irresponsible filmmaking I have ever seen (apart from all Oliver Stone agitprop movies). They could have sent the hostess to the Bogota gold museum.  They could have sent her to a coffee plantation.  They could have sent her to see a massive flower cultivation outfit BUT NO!!!  They sent her to a coca farmer who showed her how to make cocaine.  Then she went to the Pablo Escobar museum.  Pilot Films is not a responsible neutral filmmaker.  They paint Venezuela is a paradise (even though it is run by an illiterate communist mad man) and they totally smear Colombia even though Colombia has worked really hard to over come its problems.  What kind of agenda are these filmmakers trying to promote?  DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF TRASH!!!,1292025600,,909,4.61875
