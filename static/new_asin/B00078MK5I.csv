8273374,3,B00078MK5I,"First, the positives. This DVD goes into great detail about the preparation of a given test, explains what is going to happen and then does an equally detailed analysis through the use of original footage. It's fascinating the types of tests that were permitted in bygone days.

Now, the drawbacks and negative aspects. The DVD itself hasn't been updated since 1982, 28 years ago, so it wouldn't play on a modern computer, check the specifications on the packaging, a Pentium II of all things. This also made it very difficult to navigate through the menus. How about updating the ""structure"" of the materials so it is easier to find items??

Finally, this purports to be a ""history"" of atomic weapons, but contains a handful of tests, and none that I could find leading up to the dropping of Little Boy and Fat Man on Japan.

Buy ""Trinity and Beyond"", though repetitious, it is much, much better at giving a feel for the tests the US conducted from World War II through the 1950's.",1279756800,4,982,4.664739884393064
8273375,2,B00078MK5I,"I was expecting some modern footage but the cover is misleading, there aren't even any jet fighters.  The film only covers from post WWII to the fifties, there wasn't any 80's, 90's, 00's or even any 70's footage.  Its all black and white or colorized and goes on about the experimental studies and effects of nuclear explosions.  This is something you can watch for free on you tube or at the library.  I gave it an extra star because it does show vintage footage of interest to people and coverage.",1278460800,6,500,4.522222222222222
