8300911,4,B001F3ESZO,"For Manu Chao fans, this DVD is awesome. Recorded in 2002, it highlights Chao with his band Radio Bemba Sound System. Includes footage edited from two live concerts, a tour documentary and another documentary that is edited with lots of music and artwork. Highly recommend for new and current fans of Seor Chao.
