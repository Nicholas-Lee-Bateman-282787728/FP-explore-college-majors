2440484,5,B000BT999I,"You expect to see a low budget Titanic-type rip off.  Instead, it's a film about two ordinary human beings searching for the truth behind a tragedy -- one personal, the other professional -- in a world of intrigue and power.  Eventually, despite constant tension and danger, an answer of sorts is found.  But it is how that search profoundly changes the two characters is what connected me to the movie.  Terrific acting by Greta Scacchi, Jurgen Prochnow, and Donald Sutherland.  I highly recommend 'Baltic Storm'.",1152748800,4,514,5.0
2440485,5,B000BT999I,"I love this stuff.  I'm a big fan of 24- and, hey, there is a sutherland in this movie.  I won't give away the plot, but it is complicated and engaging.  The movie was really well acted and intricately conceived.  The score is a bit to Euro for me, but the movie made me really interested in this disaster and potential cover-up (check out the Discovery documentary).",1146528000,2,367,4.432835820895522
2440486,5,B000BT999I,"Baltic Storm tells the story of a courageous journalist out to find the truth about a multi-government cover-up. It is a great movie with a tightly-paced script and direction. It poses the question, ever more pertinent given today's politics, what do our governments cover up in the name of protecting the world's balance of power? What information is too sensitive to be public, and to whom is the truth owed? The filmmakers did an excellent job of making powerful arguments for both the protagonists and the villains. You couldn't help but feel for the Russian operative trying to provide for his grandson, and his argument about protecting Russia's patrimony was moving. It is rare that a film can truly help you to understand the mindset of someone responsible for something as abhorrent as the sinking of the Estonia. And Donald Sutherland and Jurgen Prochnow turned in fantastic performances",1146528000,3,897,5.0675675675675675
2440487,5,B000BT999I,"The thing I most appreciated about Baltic Storm was that the film enabled me to see this tragedy from several different perspectives.  From the perspective of the survivors, the community, and the perpetrators.  This film shows the dangers of blind patriotism, and some people in our adminstration would do well to see it.  The acting is intense and the pace is relentless.  Highly recommended.",1146528000,4,394,5.109375
2440488,1,B000BT999I,"I bought this on the strength of the 2 reviews posted here and after seeing a docu on Discovery about the Estonia, but believe me when I say this film is absolutely atrocious !! The acting is dire, how the 3 main actors got involved amazes me - were they short of money? The story is, despite the controversy surrounding the sinking, absolute fantasy on a grand scale. Sure there are some premises here invovling a possible explosion etc but COME ON !!

Avoid this disaster at ALL costs !!",1146096000,4,489,4.433333333333334
2440489,5,B000BT999I,"Reuben Leder's film reminds me of the fact-based political thrillers of Costa-Gavras--films such as ""Z"" or ""Missing.""  Ordinary people become entangled in the dangerous intrigues of competing intelligence services.  Juergen Prochnow and Greta Scacchi are excellent, and Donald Sutherland is his usual brilliant self.  The great human tragedy at the center of this movie is real, and Leder keeps the tension before, during, and after the event at a high level.  I heartily recommend this film.",1139529600,10,492,5.434210526315789
2440490,5,B000BT999I,"In 1994, the passenger ferry ""Estonia"" sank in the waters off the North Sea on a journey from Tallin, Estonia to Stockholm, Sweden. The disaster was quickly ruled to be the result of natural causes. However, a German journalist spent the next ten years investigating the tragedy, and came up with evidence that the ship was carrying arms and contraband from the remains of the former USSR to be sold on the black market in Stockholm. The movie chronicles this reporter's quest for the truth. Greta Scacchi brings heart and guts to her performance as the journalist, and Jurgen Prochnow delivers a poignant portrayal of a survivor of the tragedy united with the reporter as they search for answers. Donald Sutherland plays a mysterious figure who perhaps has all the answers. The film is tense, emotional, beautifully shot -- a gripping political thriller.",1139443200,10,855,4.986013986013986
8092205,1,B000BT999I,"I find ""Baltic Storm"" to be an insult to the 852 people who died on the ""Estonia"". After the Roll On-Roll Off (RORO) ferry sank with a huge loss of life there was much conjecture about the casualty, not the least of which came from German reporter Jutta Rabe who wrote a book on the subject and subsequently co-produced this film. I'm not here to argue that the inquiry was perfect and that elements of national intelligence apparatuses always look out for the public good, but the case as put forth here seems ludicrous in multiple ways. Of course this is a fictionalized account of the ""Estonia"" sinking, but it's thinly disguised, and it's clear that Greta Scacchi's character (Julia Reuter) has similarities to Rabe down to her initials. The A-list talent on display here (Jrgen Prochnow and Donald Sutherland) is largely squandered in histrionics and over-the-top caricature.

To be clear, the MS ""Estonia"" (previously ""Viking Sally"") did sink in 1994 after losing its bow visor. Previous incidents with similar failure modes in other ships had been noted and Estline, owner of the ""Estonia"" subsequently welded the bow visor of the sister ship ""Vironia"" (Formerly the ""Diana II"") in place due to a previous similar failure that fortunately didn't result in a casualty. The ""Estonia"" inquiry was far from perfect and there was evidence that military wares had previously been transported on the ""Estonia"", though not on the night of the sinking. In short, I can see why this accident catches the eye of conspiracy theorists, and I would never say the official findings ever completely reflect reality in any large-scale mass casualty accident. But...the visor was located detached from the ship, and the ship was sailing in rough weather at the time of the foundering. It's also important to note that RORO ferries like the ""Estonia"" are prone to great instability with even modest flooding of the car deck (a definite design drawback). Ultimately, while I can neither personally prove nor disprove anything that happened on that tragic night, I can apply Occam's Razor, and conclude that the vast and orchestrated conspiracy shaped into the storyline of ""Baltic Storm"" is exceedingly unlikely, and I think conjecture of this sort fundamentally disrespects the victims of the disaster.

The film begins with narration about the then-recent fall of communism and its effects on Estonia. The conspiracy immediately begins with a plot revolving around Russian arms smugglers and complicit crewmembers allowing nuclear material onboard. (To my knowledge there is zero evidence of that.) The US and Sweden are also in on the conspiracy, but a valiant (if extremely unlikeable) German reporter (Scacchi) learns about the nuclear plot and endeavors to sail on ""Estonia"" because she can surely get to the bottom of the goings on. She misses the boat but four KGB heavies get on board, kill the man on duty on the car deck, and decide to blow the ship up before fleeing in a perfectly timed speedboat (in the middle of the very rough Baltic Seayeah, that's likely). This scratches the surface of why Occam's Razor would discount the premise of the film: these actions are both infinitely more complicated and less plausible than a failure of the visor as put forward by the authorities, and I didn't even mention the Captain being shot. In reality the ship's visor was recovered far from the rest of the ship, proving it separated before the sinking, though Rabe and company contend it was detached explosively.

Reuter is totally unlikeable and does the typical thing a journalist out of their technical depth does, leads with the question ""What caused the accident?"" There's rarely a single cause of a major accident, and it's almost never known at the outset. The film consists of much interpersonal melodrama and terrible acting leaning heavily on the conspiracy theory angle (later devolving into an anti-American angle); one particularly painful example of which is the supremely ludicrous press conference where Prochnow as bereaved father Erik Westermark chews the scenery about his lost son. As bad as that role is, Donald Sutherland as Lou Aldryn is nothing but a creepy caricature of a spy boss. For the record, I genuinely like the works of both Prochnow and Sutherland, but here they're utterly wasted.

While inspecting the wreck, divers find evidence of explosions within the first minute, but the Swedish Coast Guard interferes. In reality in 2000, Sweden actually did issue an arrest warrant for Rabe for violating the sanctity of the shipwreck. I'm not going to interpret that for anyone, but at least this part of the story is somewhat grounded in reality. Because she's onto something big, some shadowy spooks burn Reuter's apartment down, injuring her son in the process. That's actually a horrific plot point and could have been very effective if handled better, but the acting is so over the top that it's painful to sit through. Before it's over Reuter is onto an ever-widening conspiracy of nuclear material, a dead biochemical expert, and a plot detour that's so ham-handed as to be laughable.

Like I've said, I don't think the more outlandish elements of this story are logical or likely anything but fiction, but the final act of the film makes everything before it look like perfectly-ordered empiricism by comparison. The film comes off the rails when we learn that the relief Captain has been taken to ""Sector 9"" on an American base. After a moronic firefight in the woods, Prochnow is kidnapped when he approaches known bad guys and asks ""looking for me?"" This is just an insult to the audience's intelligence. Reuter tries to bluff her way into the super-secret ""Sector 9"", and if you know anything about military security, you immediately realize how ridiculous a proposition this is. Of course, since this is a movie and definitely requires the suspension of disbelief, she gets on the base to do her sleuthing. She's all high and mighty about the power of the press and actually manages to team up with Prochnow (yeah, that's likely...) but mostly establishes herself as the most self-aggrandizing and self-righteous character in the history of cinema, while allowing the film to conclude with its basket of conspiracies still unproven.

In reality, I knew about the sinking of the ""Estonia"" before I watched this movie, and was open-minded to the premise that there could have been corporate or government malfeasance involved (though more likely in the form of a weak maintenance inspection program or something of that ilk). I was also willing to allow a completely fictional account of a ferry sinking to be used for dramatic effect. What I have issue with is the use of an actual historical event where 852 people died as a backdrop to be fictionalized into a wild conspiracy story that far exceeds the scope of the plausible. Nukes? A Speedboat? And far worst, Sector 9? I don't doubt that there are things being done behind the scenes by intelligence services all the time, some of which are unsavory. I don't even doubt that the ""Estonia"" may have carried arms at some point. What I am convinced of is that the scenario as depicted in this film is wildly unlikely, and that far more mundane issues likely caused the sinking of the ""Estonia"" (though that of course that doesn't cater to an appetite for sensationalism).

""Baltic Storm"" could have been a great film if it had been more down to Earth and plausible. As it is, I think it does a disservice to the victims of the ""Estonia"", may they all rest in peace.",1511654400,,7553,4.947202521670607

8092210,3,B000BT999I,"At times this was an extremely well acted, well written, perceptive, warm deeply sad story of love, stress, rage, betrayal, and yes the controversial sinking of a large passenger ferry and the death of nearly 900 innocent people...a genuine tragedy...one other tragedy, unsuspected by the film-makers, was their occasional descent into anti-American farce.  I teach history, I KNOW many of the terrible things this country has done.  None of that excuses turning what seemed to be a superior and significant film into a cartoon.  By the end we're in a sort of twisted Fantasyland with Donald Sutherland, no less, as the Black Queen, and America the ultimate evil agent.  Honest...I'm not making this up...I was VERY disappointed, if only because I was enjoying the quality of its acting, the honesty of its performances, and the humanity it often showed...until as I say it descended into a cartoonish unreality...even if what it claims to be true, was in fact true, something we'll probably never know, the way it was portrayed was I'm sorry to say, pathetic.  There was a lot good in this movie, too much of which was wasted by the end... BY THE WAY, in case you think I'm one of those America is always right types, look up slavery, or Wounded Knee, or the Japanese-American internment, or the Atomic veterans of the 1950's nuclear tests...",1262649600,3,1343,4.898678414096916

8092212,5,B000BT999I,"I vaguely remembered the disaster that this movie was based on.  Instead of a ""Titanic"" type movie, what I found was a gripping personal story about two ordinary people with extraordinary guts as they went up against powerful forces in their quest to learn the truth behind the sinking.  Without giving away the plot, this was no natural disaster.  The filmaking was a mixture of objective reality and newsreel type footage which was seemlessly integrated.

8092213,3,B000BT999I,"In September 1994, the Baltic Sea ferry Estonia sank killing 852 of her 989 passengers and crew. Over the next ten years, German journalist Jutta Rabe would doggedly pursue her theory on the disaster, culminating in this movie.

Baltic Storm has a good premise and a good lead cast, Greta Scacchi as a renamed Rabe, Jurgen Prochnow (Das Boot) as a Swedish survivor of the disaster and Donald Sutherland. The problem is that with these three hired there seemed to be no money left for a decent supporting cast and we're left with several second rate German actors attempting to play Swedes, Estonians, Finns and Russians.

Rabe is a good journalist but she is not the best film producer. There are a number of glaring errors which temper the seriousness of the story and what actually makes the film poignant is the use of contemporary news footage and interviews with some of the key figures at the time.

However this film does still work. Despite the bad acting we do feel sorry for the people who die while the three main leads carry the film well. The story is very good and believeable and the music also works well.

In the end, this is a must see film, especially given that a number of the allegations made in the film have turned out to be true.",1168732800,2,1254,4.535398230088496
8092214,5,B000BT999I,"The sad tragic case of the MV Estonia a ferry which sank under very mysterious circumstances in September 1994 with a huge loss of life;  852 people from 17 countries died and only 140 odd survived. Baltic Storm is an attempt to bring to the World's attention some of the lies, misconceptions and cover ups involved in the story. Greta Scachi character is based upon German journalist Jutta Raabe who did her own investigation into the sinking. Anyone expecting a traditional 'disaster type' movie may be dissapointed, in fact the sinking and scenes on the Estonia are all too brief - perhaps out of respect for the families of the victims. Its a thought provoking movie and while some scenes do tend to get a bit corny (the split screen techniques) Its a pity this movie did not receive a wider distribution as perhaps it would have brought more attention to the tragedy. As a companion piece read Drew Wilsons excellent Book 'The Hole' and look at some of the many websites on the tragedy and cover up. A good thought provoking tale.",1163548800,9,1035,4.655737704918033
