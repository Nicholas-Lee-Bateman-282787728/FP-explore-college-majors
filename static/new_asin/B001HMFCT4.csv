8308985,5,B001HMFCT4,"I like both movies in this two-movie box set. The Journey to the center of the Earth movie was pretty good, but I most say that it wasn't as good as the newer one or the one after that. I liked The Mysteroius Island. It was rely good, filled with action and giant monsters and secret submarines. You should get it if you like good movies that take place in older times as well as made in older times.",1405036800,,400,4.075949367088608
8308986,5,B001HMFCT4,"The original movie, not the one starring Will Ferrell. A group of explorers finds entrances through a volcano in Iceland/Greenland to caverns deeper than ever thought possible before. What they find is truly amazing! No spoilers. The effects are what you expect from an older movie. Mysterious Island is also included. That is the classic as well. This is a similar concept to The Lost World TV series. Classic adventure like 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea is how best to describe both films here. There are no submarines but you get the idea by now. VERY family friendly entertainment as well. No worries, parents, on language or nudity. There is none. Classic family adventure films.",1395532800,,683,4.947826086956522

8308988,5,B001HMFCT4,I have seen this movies and really liked it . I watch this version of Mysterious Island and also enjoyed it.  A great buy.,1370304000,,122,4.083333333333333
8308989,4,B001HMFCT4,"Both movies were very entertaining, especially as they rather boldly broke away from the original literary works and earlier film adaptations. Instead of looking out for expected scenes and characters described in the books, the viewer is treated to several suprises throughout the movie.
One black mark!.... Mysterious island was cheapened by the screen presence of self-styled ""hard man"" Vinnie Jones. Ex-footballer and professional thug, an actor does not make.",1352419200,,464,5.642857142857143
8308990,5,B001HMFCT4,I saw this movie one time on channel 7 about 10 years ago and i thought it was wonderful movie. Then i couldn't find until just recently when i bought it.,1314576000,,154,4.0
8308991,5,B001HMFCT4,"OK, I'll admit I've not read the Jules Verne classics, nor watched the earlier versions of these, but we picked up the two pack cheap and finally got around to watching them with our kids and they were transfixed and we enjoyed them too.  Yes, they're cheesy and yes the graphics and special effects are lacking. I imagine some of the stars were horrified to see what they appeared in, but honestly they are super fun adventure movies that are a little more serious than most of what our kids get to see for a PG rating and they absolutely loved them both.  Sad that they're over, wishing there was something else similar, suggestions welcome :)",1258848000,,645,4.551724137931035
8308992,4,B001HMFCT4,"OK, so I know these are not the quality of the originals by any stretch. BUT - - - If every re-telling of the same story is identicle, how boring would that be? There are quite a few liberties taken here (especially Journey) but they are fun for the whole family to watch, with little violence and bloodshed. (Hard to find these days!) And I thought that Mysterious Island was worth the price of the two movies alone! Parick Stewert does a great job in his role, despite the literary licenses taken! But if you're looking for the Verne movies, watch the earlier versions(1959 - Journey & 1961 - Island)!",1245715200,4,603,4.490909090909091
