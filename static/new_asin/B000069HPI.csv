1731786,1,B000069HPI,IF your a fan of Aladdin just stick with the Disney version. I did see this movie. Not impressed totally cheap animation. Not really entertaining at all. Disney's Aladdin is good enough for me. Just horrible telling of a classic story.,1282176000,6,235,4.7560975609756095
1731787,3,B000069HPI,its a short cartoon. it is not the full length movie i thought i was ordering.,1254096000,,78,3.9375
1731788,2,B000069HPI,Disappointed that this wasn't the original movie. Don't know which one this is but couldn't return it because I waited a month or so before I watched it only to find out it is not the original Aladdin movie.  A bit bummed.,1252800000,,222,4.285714285714286
1731789,1,B000069HPI,"The animation is very poorly done, there is no acting, no suspense, and the writing is awful.  I was given this as a child, lost it in my basement, and recently retrieved it.  A friend of mine and I watched it just last night and we were in disbelief that anyone thought that this was good enough to sell.  Watch this if you want to feel better about yourself for not having been involved in the creation of this movie.",1186444800,21,419,4.2125
1731790,1,B000069HPI,"Lame. Lame. Lame.  If you like this version of Aladdin, you must have eaten too much paste as a kid and your tastebuds died long ago.

I don't even have to compare it to Disney.  You know it's not Disney and I know it's not Disney.

This was totally unwatchable all on its own merits.",1125705600,19,284,4.109090909090909
1731791,5,B000069HPI,"""Aladdin"", produced in 1993 by Golden Films and distributed on DVD by Goodtimes Entertainment is based on the classic, timeless Arabian Nights tale of the young, humble boy named Aladdin.  ""Aladdin"" is the story of a poor boy, son of a widowed peasant woman, who spends his time out in the streets of his Arabian city in search for any sort of work in order to help his mother.  Their fortune appears to finally change the day in which Haseem arrives at their home.  He claims to be the brother of the late Mustafa, Aladdin's father and therefore, uncle of the boy.  One day, Haseem takes Aladdin to a far off place in the desert where he says he and his brother had often played when they were children.  As Aladdin watches how Haseem manages what seems like some sort of dark magic, the boy realizes that the man is in fact an impostor and not his uncle at all.  The dark magic uncovers the entrance to a dark, underground cave, where Haseem orders Aladdin to climb down and fetch nothing but one simple oil lamp.  Aladdin sees no other option but to obey and within minutes, he has the lamp as well as a sack of precious jewels he found in a lovely garden inside the magical cave.  The sack of jewels is too heavy for Aladdin to carry up the slippery steps out of the cave and so refuses to come up.  Haseem, enraged, conjures up the dark magic once again and closes the entrance to the cave leaving Aladdin trapped inside.  Aladdin regrets his big mouth and tries to find a way out of the cave.  As he does so, he accidentally rubs the oil lamp he was carrying and out of it comes a great, big scary Genie.  The Genie is a friendly creature who not only helps Aladdin to get out of the cave, but he also promises the boy to fulfill just about anything that he may wish for.  There are many things that Aladdin wishes for; for one thing, he wants his mother to live in comfort as she's always deserved, he wants protection against the evil Haseem, who wants to take revenge on Aladdin and get what he thinks is rightfully his; and finally, Aladdin wishes to marry the beautiful Princess Leila, daughter of the sultan.

""Aladdin"" is probably the weakest of this seven-title line of Golden Films' animated classics.  The film is enjoyable, no doubt about that, in fact, I have always prefered it over Disney's far more popular version, which I always thought to be one of their weakest films of their classic eras.  Golden Films' Aladdin doesn't have the charmingly sweet story of ""The Little Mermaid"" (1993) or ""Beauty and the Beast"" (1993), the wonderful variety of classical compositions that ""Thumbelina"" (1993) has, or the lush, wonderfully detailed backgrounds like those in ""The Three Musketeers"" (1993).  As for music, Aladdin has a number of classical pieces heard in other Golden Films animations, but its main musical appeal is in the Middle-Eastern-styled tunes heard in different scenes.  The opening song, ""Rub the Lamp"", though nice and catchy, is probably also the weakest of this line of Golden Films' theme songs.  The other Golden Films' productions don't really have a high, strong point; they tend to be balanced with good music, good characters and a good plot, but Aladdin's appeal may very well be in its humor.  All of the other films had their touch of humor, but it definitely stands out more in ""Aladdin"".  The characters are funny and humorous, with several wisecracks and little jokes, but nothing in the style of modern children's films, the humor does not take over the seriousness of certain situations.  The jokes are smart and the characters are smart; the protagonist is likeable, the villain is purposely dislikeable and all other characters fit into one of these categories.  Even being perhaps the weakest of Golden Films' second line of animated classics, ""Aladdin"" is no less enjoyable and a film I can watch over and over again.  As a closing thought, I'll say what I always say, the animation here is nowhere as good as Disney, but people need to keep in mind that these films were made primarily for children and children are not picky enough to notice such things.  The film is light-hearted, quality entertainment for children, though closed-minded adults may not find it so.  Highly recommended.",1091664000,8,4243,4.669354838709677

1731814,3,B000069HPI,"First of all, this is NOT Disney's Aladdin from 1992. This is a version by Golden Films that came out the same year. Ironic, huh? I saw this because this movie was included in a set of Jetlag Productions and Golden Films that my mom bought for me. They were NOT purchased accidentally. Before I review the actual movie, I just want to say this is an edit and originally I had given this movie 1 star and wrote about how awful this movie was. I was mad and was too harsh on this movie. That's my fault and I apologize. Anyways, on with the review.

In terms of animation, the quality is the same as any other Golden Films movie and is not nearly as good as Disney's. However, I'm used to this type of animation and I certainly don't expect a small direct-to-video company to be as good as Disney's. The voice acting is not bad, either. Cam Clarke voices Aladdin, Jeff Bennett voices the Genie, and Corey Burton voices the Sultan. The weak elements of this movie, in my opinion, have to be the characters and the dialogue. Some of the characters have no common sense and just whine the whole movie. The dialogue is incredibly cheesy, but what can you expect from Golden Films. A strong point of this movie would be the song, ""Rub the Lamp, Aladdin"". It's pretty darn catchy!

As far as the plot goes, it follows closer to the original tale of Aladdin and the Magic Lamp. I will provide a basic summary of the movie. A poor boy named Aladdin lives with his mom and is always trying to earn money. However, one day a man named Haseem claims to be Aladdin's uncle and brings him far into the desert. He makes Aladdin go into the Cave of Wonders where he gets jewels and the magic lamp, which is what Haseem is after. Eventually, Aladdin comes home with his treasures and his mom tells him magic is dangerous and she doesn't want Aladdin to use the lamp. Aladdin later falls in love with Princess Leila. He is allowed to marry her after he brings a bunch of jewels to the Sultan. Haseem tries unsuccessly to get the lamp another couple of times. At the end Aladdin beats Haseem and Aladdin and Leila ride off into the night. Overall, this movie is okay. It is no substitute for Disney's Aladdin, but it is not a bad movie and I would recommend this movie to children, although close minded adults may not enjoy it.",1396915200,,2308,4.352668213457076
