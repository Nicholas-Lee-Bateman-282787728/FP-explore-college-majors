2668424,5,B000JBXHRI,"This Rocks! Now ive been a fan of doctor who for a Very very long time, and when i saw that the BBC had made a New Doctor Who show, my interest was piqued! and i bought them after watching these 2 seasons they are Spectacular! with loads of DVD Extras, behind the scenes, interviews, and so much more its hard to list all of them! the Graphical Quality is Supreme, as well as the Audio, the special effects are Finally up to par with todays great effects. if you are a fan of doctor who, or know the daleks,K-9 and others this is a Must Own! especally if not for the sheer goodness of this then get it for the story background on the Doctor, The Time war and what happened between the daleks and the time lords! also even some insight into the Mighty Tardis *Time And Relative Dimension In Space TARDIS* woot gleaned that nugget of info just from the show! buy now before they go out of print and then you have to pay double (it still would be worth it) this is a Gem in anyones collection!",1175904000,19,990,4.161458333333333
2668425,5,B000JBXHRI,"I recently purchased Doctor Who The Complete First and Second Series just a few weeks back, and I have to say that I love them. I have almost watched all of it, but I just haven't had the time. It is a very good product, and I got a pretty good deal for it. Plus, it did not take two or three weeks to get here, which, I have to say, I'm glad for... I hate having to wait for something to get mailed to me, haha.",1174348800,2,412,3.7471264367816093
2668475,1,B000JBXHRI,"This used to sell for $78 on Amazon.  Why is it suddenly $122?

This is a 5 star series...but 1 star because of the price.

I love the series but coupled with the fact that this show goes for $20 a season (new) in the UK I find it hard to justify this excessive price for 13 episodes per season.

It's not even blu-ray.",1279238400,,319,3.9375
2668476,5,B000JBXHRI,This product arrived sooner than the projected date and was in perfect condition.  I have enjoyed watching again and again.  This product has upheld the reputation of good condition and usability.,1278633600,,196,5.290322580645161
2668477,5,B000JBXHRI,The episodes were fantastic - of course!  We had a problem with disc 3 in Series 2... i could barely get it to run at home.  I can't figure out how to get the disc replaced via Amazon... might try BBC.,1278460800,,201,3.8780487804878048
2668478,5,B000JBXHRI,This was one of the most enjoyable birthday presents I received this year!!! I have been an avid Doctor Who fan for years and recently decided to take the plunge into 'ownership'. A must get for anyone who loves the series and wants to rewatch to see more.,1278288000,,256,4.354166666666667
2668479,5,B000JBXHRI,"The show is fun, clever, moving, and funny- a great show for kids and adults! I've been looking for all the seasons separately, and they are quite expensive.  In fact, all the BBC shows tend to cost a lot more, but this 2 season set works out to be a lot lower. You are getting two seasons for the retail price of one!  A great deal! These are well worth watching over and over! And they include the behind the scenes Doctor Who Confidentials!",1278028800,2,443,4.261904761904762
2668480,5,B000JBXHRI,"Thanks to a Daily Deal, my kids bought me every season of Christopher Eccelston and David Tennant as Dr. Who - what a great Christmas!! My husband and I first ""met"" the Dr during the Tom Baker years and I never thought I would enjoy it as much as I did back in the 80s. How wrong I was! Both of these men were wonderful and I am now enjoying the newest Dr, Matt Smith, and look forward every week to his new adventures. If you love BBC offerings and science fiction, you'll love Dr. Who!",1275091200,,487,4.083333333333333
2668481,5,B000JBXHRI,My son was very happy with the videos.  This is one of his favorite series.  I was very happy with the service I received.,1270771200,,122,4.041666666666667
2668482,5,B000JBXHRI,"With all the deserved hoopla over David Tennant as the 10th Doctor, people forget that when Dr. Who reemerged with Chris Eccleston as the 9th Doctor there was an equal amount of hoopla.  Now he's overlooked.  So buying these two years together, year one with Eccleston and year two with Tennant, bound together with Rose as the companion offer a good comparison.  I never want to forget Eccleston's perormance.  Had he continued, the series would have been every bit as good, albeit in a different direction.  He is the least quirky, or most ""normal"" of all the Doctors I am familiar with and that leant a level of believability to the character.  He's almost the ""superhero space alien next door"".  Kind, caring, and an ironic sense of humor, somewhat distant and mysterious with none of Tennant's manic qualities",1268438400,,814,4.855072463768116
2668483,5,B000JBXHRI,I've followed reruns of the original series through the years and had always hoped to see it return and WOW!!!  Back with SO many improvements but with plenty of things that make Doctor Who... well Doctor Who.  It's great to see Billie Piper in a role with the Doctor that takes the idea of the companion to an area that I feel it's never been before.  Fantastic and brilliant!,1265760000,,377,4.434782608695652
2668484,5,B000JBXHRI,"One of the most memorable fantastic series around.  It doesn't rely on special effects but rather really good writing.  The character of The Doctor is consistent with his predecessors and the actors bring their own unique spin on it.  Christopher Eccleston and David Tennant bring The Doctor to life and give him such presence. The interaction between The Doctor and all the recurring characters is tight and makes the series believable.

Good writing and solid acting make this series awesome.",1260921600,,494,5.1375
2668523,5,B000JBXHRI,I was pleased about the quick delivery. I've been waiting for over a year to be able to get these dvds. Now to find time to sit and watch them.,1251936000,,143,3.8
2668524,5,B000JBXHRI,"Living in the US makes catching Doctor Who episodes something of a hit-or-miss ordeal, so I finally broke down and bought the DVDs.  They are well packaged, the episode guides are well thought out, and the image quality is great!  No issues with messed up discs; I bought S1-S4 when I ordered and out of 23 discs, only 2 had minor scratches and play without issue.

Highly recommended for anyone who likes Sci-Fi; esp. those with kids.  My niece and I have spent many an hour watching Doctor Who together laughing and it's a great way to spend a little time together in this crazy busy world with some quality entertainment.

You can't go wrong: Quality programming, well organized DVD set, and great for the whole family!",1250899200,,722,4.653543307086614
2668525,5,B000JBXHRI,A delightful revamping of the classic British series from the eighties for those who remember and loved the old Doctors.  Both actors who portray the Doctor do an excellent job.  Well written story lines will keep you guessing.  Good to see the series back.,1249257600,,257,4.795454545454546
2668526,5,B000JBXHRI,I really like this show. The writing is great; because of time travel you can speed up the stories to keep the audience interested. It can take place on a distant planet 5 billion years in the future or in medeival England.,1240444800,,223,4.333333333333333
2668527,3,B000JBXHRI,"Although the series is excellent as expected, there were scratches on disc one and three of series one, interestingly the replacement discs had scratches in exactly the same places, like there was some problem associated with their production, if you purchase season one prepare to have to have them resurfaced.",1233014400,2,311,5.24
2668528,5,B000JBXHRI,"I really miss billie p. Not to take anything away from the new chicks, but she was great the first two seasons.",1229472000,,111,4.090909090909091
2668529,5,B000JBXHRI,The Doctor will rescue you.... from your dreary existence and take you on adventures you've never dreamed of.,1219017600,2,109,5.111111111111111
2668530,2,B000JBXHRI,"I absolutly love Doctor Who, and think it's a great show, but when I bought this set, I recieved defective dvds, which I then returned only to recieve another set of defective dvds, and now I'm still waiting on a refund. Therefore, you may want to consider buying this on iTunes, unless you really want the special features and the Christmas episode, which is not currently on iTunes. Either way, I would recomend buying it from somewhere, it's fantastic.",1218672000,3,455,4.772151898734177
2668531,5,B000JBXHRI,"What can I say? I'm a newer Doctor Who fan, drawn in first by random funny clips of Daleks on youtube, and then I was exposed to my very first episode, 'Dalek' from season one of this series. It's needless to say that from there, I was hooked, and have proceeded to share it with others since purchasing this item. The first season had its slow points up until episode six, but I would go so far as to say that there's no such thing as an episode of Doctor Who that I do not like. Stand-out episodes included Father's Day, The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances, and of course Dalek -- which after having seen a few seasons remains my favorite episode of all time.

A lot of people say that they weren't impressed with season 2, but again, there wasn't a single episode that I hated, and the modern update of the Cybermen was just as well executed as the update for the Daleks was. The creators of this show managed to successfully take villains who would have, by today's standards, been seen as hokey and laughable if they had been transplanted as is, and present them to the world with the same ability to strike fear as they have in the past -- all without making them unrecognizable to original fans. Stand-out episodes in this season include Back to School -- where one (or two) of the Doctor's former companions makes an appearance -- The Girl in the Fireplace, Rise of the Cybermen, and of course the season finale -- which left me depressed for weeks after I saw it.

The writing is fresh, the dialogue clever, and the acting is impressive. Having seen episodes of the older series, now, I feel that the differences between the old and the new, short of budget, are few. I watch old and new Doctor Who and still feel like I'm watching the same show.",1218585600,2,1753,4.407407407407407
2668532,5,B000JBXHRI,"I so enjoy the new Doctor who, I remember watching the old ones with Tom Baker as a kid and I was so exited to introduce my husband and kids to this new and fresh generation of Doctor Who.  Plus David Tenant is soooo sexy.",1216512000,,222,3.933333333333333
2668553,5,B000JBXHRI,"The new seasons of Doctor Who are fantastic.  The scripts are brilliant, and both Eccleston and Tennant are engaging and entertaining - they fit the role of the Doctor well while bringing unique personality to the character.",1215993600,,224,5.054054054054054
2668554,5,B000JBXHRI,I have watched Dr. Who for years. I love the new series just as much as the old.,1215475200,,80,3.5
2668555,5,B000JBXHRI,Loved Dr Who.  Had defective disk on season 2.  Sent it back and got a prompt replacement.  Very easy return.  Love the DVD.  Very happy with it.,1215302400,,145,4.222222222222222
2668556,5,B000JBXHRI,"As a newcomer to the Whoniverse, I had, um, low expectations.  My then-boyfriend, now-husband told me that he loved the old series - men in rubber suits and all.  The show has come a long way.  Of the first three seasons, I think the second one is the strongest.  There's chemistry between David and Billie, and it carries through to their characters.  For those who don't love sci-fi, don't worry; the best episodes are about people and show off the talents of the writers and actors equally.  Highly recommended.",1213747200,,514,4.719101123595506
2668557,5,B000JBXHRI,"I had to force myself to not watch all of the series in one sitting. Each stands alone and is fun. Watching them collectively it was great to see plot threads build and come to fruition. I went back a couple of times to older episodes to remind myself of things foreshadowed. What a great time. Everyone should take a trip with ""the Doctor"".",1213401600,,341,4.34375
2668558,5,B000JBXHRI,"Absolutely Brilliant price for the first two seasons of the new Who, love it!!!! Amazing series and glad to finally own a copy.

Heather!",1212192000,,137,4.708333333333333
2668559,5,B000JBXHRI,Been a Doctor Who fan since Tom Baker played the Doctor.  Great series continuation with the 9th and 10th Doctor regenration.  Highly recommend the set.  Can't wait for the 4th season DVDs.,1210723200,,189,4.84375
2668560,5,B000JBXHRI,A must for the Doctor Who fan. I honestly really and truly bought this for the kids...........They can't seem to find it though. I think it found its way into my personal collection :),1210636800,,184,4.4411764705882355
2668561,5,B000JBXHRI,"I really love the new series, they are doing a fantastic job with it all.  I can hardly wait for season 4.  If you have never seen Doctor Who, I would suggest you do so, this also means that if you have the chance, watch the old shows too.

James",1207353600,,246,3.88
2668562,5,B000JBXHRI,"Both seasons were very well done.  There is a good transition from the
Christopher Eccleston character of Dr Who and the David Tennant portayal of Dr Who.  The special affects were much better than the old Tom Baker Dr Who days and the storylines were quite good.",1201564800,,263,4.574468085106383
2668612,5,B000JBXHRI,"Fine, fine work. Better than the original series. The episode 'Blink' stands well against the Best of Buffy. Excellent.",1200614400,2,119,5.315789473684211
2668613,5,B000JBXHRI,"These two series of the new Doctor Who continue the legend brillently.  Eccleston and Tennant are both the same Doctor in totally different ways.  Series 3 yet to come, can't wait to get it.",1199145600,2,190,4.5588235294117645
2668614,5,B000JBXHRI,"Doctor Who is a fabulous British sci-fi show that can be enjoyed by the entire family. The Doctor is the last of his kind, a timne-lord, who travels through space and time in his ""Bigger on the inside"", TARDIS.  While the Doctor (Christopher Ecclston/David Tennant) usually flies alone, every now and then, he picks up a companion.  In the first episode, we meet the Doctor's new companion, Rose (Billie Piper).  The show is fast paced, funny, and most importantly, is does not take itself too seriously.",1198627200,,504,4.837209302325581
2668615,5,B000JBXHRI,"I LOVE David Tennant as the Doctor, but it is nice to start from the beginning of the first series because one of the best things about this show is that it will tie in things throughout all the seasons.  It really is a wonderful series, probably the most enjoyable sci-fi show I've ever seen - dare I say it?  Up there with Firefly!  Rent it, buy it, but just don't miss out!",1195948800,2,376,4.123287671232877
2668616,4,B000JBXHRI,"It's all summed up in one word that the doctor likes using: FANTASTIC! cool visual, good story and almost believeable!",1192579200,,118,4.95
2668617,5,B000JBXHRI,We have finally found something that the whole family looks forward to watching.  When chores and homework are done we spend an hour or two with the Doctor.  We really love all the characters and the subtle campiness of the sets and story lines.,1190505600,5,245,4.545454545454546
2668618,5,B000JBXHRI,"The Doctor is back and better than ever.  They kept the essence of the original show while updating it to make full use of the advances in technology and special effects.  It has humor, drama, strange aliens, fighting robots, and much more.  Sci Fi entertainment at its best.  I can't wait for seasons 3, 4, 5, etc to come out.",1190332800,8,327,4.4
2668619,4,B000JBXHRI,While there are some differents between the ORIGANEL and the NEW series they are small and can be overlooked. The new series is more special effects intensve and slighty less story driven but is still a good attempt to bring to TV a good SCI-FI night of entertainement.,1189900800,,269,4.625
2668620,5,B000JBXHRI,"The new Doctor Who Series are some of the best TV I have ever seen. However, you can likely rent them and watch them once to get the same experience as buying them.",1189814400,3,164,4.0
2668621,5,B000JBXHRI,"I'm so glad they brought back Doctor Who. I was a fan from the original and I just love the new series. The production values are better, but I kinda miss the wabbley doors and walls. I would recomend this set to anyone whose a fan sci-fi. Christopher Eccleston and David Tennant are wonderful as the Doctor and bring there own to the part.",1188518400,,340,4.328125

8149736,5,B000JBXHRI,"Apparently my father had watched all of TORCHWOOD and loved it, but had never seen an episode of Doctor Who. So, for Father's Day, I've remedied that with a prescription of The Doctor. So far, he's enjoying it.",1371600000,,210,4.552631578947368
8149737,5,B000JBXHRI,"This first and second season contain all of the criteria of a great science fiction series; full of wit and drama. Sparkling dialouge, great character development. The Characters are believable; the situations they are thrust into are exotic and complex, but more importantly, work to bring out the best or the worst of their personalities.  The epidode ""The Empty Child"" is one of my favorites, but to say any more about it would be to ruin it for the first time viewer. It's a good episode that will get you hooked.",1363737600,,517,4.681318681318682
8149738,1,B000JBXHRI,"I have no complaints about the DVDs... I have a complaint about Amazon! I ordered this set in August. The people at Amazon told me it would ship in 12 days at the latest. They've now bumped up the time to sometime this month! I have received all my other orders I paid for at the same time as the DVD set, but have I seen my ""Dr. Who"" set yet? The answer: NO!
