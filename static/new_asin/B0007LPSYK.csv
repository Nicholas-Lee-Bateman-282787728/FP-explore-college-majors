2219488,5,B0007LPSYK,This movie was a good adaptation of the book. Although there were some details that were changed it did not take away from the story.,1402099200,,133,4.36
2219489,4,B0007LPSYK,"No mini-series could measure up to Danielle Steel's, ""The Ring."" But Vanished hooked and kept my interest throughout the film. It is interesting that each of the "" supposedly evil"" main characters had a basic foundation of good will about him or her.

I don't want to give away the story, but George Hamilton and his paramour used underhanded methods to take a child that they could love and cherish as his mother and father.
 I guess they rationalized the pain they inflicted on the Lisa Rinni character.
Reasonably true to life.
Fine acting and production values.",1391644800,3,565,4.814432989690721
