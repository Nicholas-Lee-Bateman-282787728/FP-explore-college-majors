7587882,5,B01A0B6BRY,"Being Poirot, by David Suchet.  A British  television documentary made by ITV Studios that will be irresistible to all Poirot fans. It is hosted by Stanley Tucci (FORTITUDE, THE HUNGER GAMES).  It  marks two important anniversaries:  the 100th of Poirots creation; Agatha Christie wrote THE MYSTERIOUS AFFAIR AT STYLES, her first Hercule Poirot  novel in 1916. And  the 25th  of Suchet s playing one of television's most iconic characters in the Emmy-nominated series AGATHA CHRISTIES POIROT.  Centers on Suchet, of course.

In it,  Suchet tries to explain the mysterious appeal of the great detective, reveals what it has been like for him to play one of fiction's most popular, enduring and enigmatic creations. He allows the camera crew to follow him as he prepares for the emotional final days' filming on set. Returns to Agatha Christie's summer home in Devon, where he first met the author's family, especially  her grandson Mathew Prichard,  after taking on the role a quarter  century ago. Travels again on the Orient Express, revisiting one of the authors most popular, best-known novels that recently received a top-notch television treatment in which he starred. Travels to Belgium to search out  Poirot's roots, what the Belgians think of one of their most famous sons.

The box set, which I received for review purposes in expectation of an unbiased and honest treatment, consists of one disc running approximately 62 minutes.  The material was previously available  as part of 2014s COMPLETE CASES COLLECTION DVD set, aired on select public TV stations, but is now made available separately as a DVD single. It has bonus material: an interview with Suchet (18 mins.), and with Christies grandson Prichard (33 mins).  It also, thank goodness, has subtitles.  Funny about Poirots being known around the world: my husband and I were in St. Petersburg, Russia, a couple of years ago, wandering around downtown, trying to figure out where to have lunch.  Passed a place fronted by a picture of Suchet as Poirot.  Immediately figured it would have Belgian food.  In we went and had a nice lunch.  You see, Poirot doesnt let you down.  A great gift for a Poirot fan.",1472774400,6,2173,5.019607843137255
7587883,5,B01A0B6BRY,"David Suchet defined, captured, BECAME Hercule Poirot. An eccentric or genius Belgian, and a detective unequaled, besting even Sherlock. Poirot books began in 1916, The Mysterious Affair at Styles published in 1920, and as this DVD releases in 2016, it serves as a Centennial Tribute to Agatha Christies noted male sleuthing giant. Poirot eventually was involved in dozens novels and short stories, and ended with Curtain published in 1975, which inspired the NYTimes to run the fictional characters obituary on the front page.

Suchet began playing Hercule Poirot in 1989 for a TV series that ended with the final book adaptation a quarter century later. The books covered decades, but the TV series centered itself as a 1936, or there about, series time frame. Suchet became the little man behind the iconic mustache, little grey cells, and the walk. This DVD even films in Agatha Christies home interior (Greenway) allowing viewers to see where Poirot was literarily birthed. Morality and justice prevail throughout the life of this quirky sleuth. And much is said about the trademark of Christies book endings, and Suchets finesse in portraying the Poirot summing-up gathering and disclosure of who-dun-it at the end of every case.

This series is narrated/hosted by Stanley Tucci (Shall We Dance; Devil Wears Prada; ER; Hunger Games). It is a must buy/own for all Poirot and/or Suchet fans. Being Poirot was included in the Complete Cases Collection but if you are like me and acquired the full collection one set at a time, then this is desirable. It also comes with two bonus filmed segments. Suchets comments on a variety of Poirot story issues and Bill Youngs 2014 interview of Agatha Christies real grandson.",1471305600,4,1718,5.088652482269503
8746333,5,B01A0B6BRY,I most enjoyed the anecdotes he notes as well as his description of compiling Hercule's characteristics from the Agatha Christie books.  It made me want to read all her stories again.,1519516800,,183,4.903225806451613

Hercule Poirot is, for me, much more than the character on the written page.  Hercule Poirot, for me, almost is a real person.

 He is the person who was responsible for my life for twenty-five years.

Ive gotten to know him.  Ive lived him.  Hes my invisible closest and best friend.

The above is uttered by David Suchet (pronounced Sue-shay) at the very beginning of this documentary  definitely a MUST-SEE documentary for all Poirot fans.  It is presented by David Suchet and is hosted by Stanley Tucci.

We get to follow Suchet around the world as he attempts to discover the appeal of the great detective with the handsome mustache (who appeared in fifty short stories and thirty-three novels).  We get to learn some little-known facts about Poirots creator, Agatha Christie (1890 to 1976), and what she thought of perhaps her greatest character.  (The quotation that titles this review was found in one of Christies saved notebooks.)

We also learn more about David Suchet and why he is inextricably linked to Poirot.

Throughout, there are brief comments from such people as Suchets friends, biographers, etc.  Also, snippets from the Poirot movies are intermingled with the documentary dialogue.

There are two things that I found especially enjoyable:

(1) Suchet visits Belgian in order to learn what Belgians think about one of their most famous fictional sons.

(2) We get to follow Suchets preparations and join him on the set for the final, emotional days of filming.  (The final scene of the final Poirot movie was filmed on June 24, 2013.)

Finally, there are two extras, one being 18 minutes long, the other 33 minutes.  They are quite good.

In conclusion, I predict that Hercule Poirot fans little gray cells will just adore this documentary.  I leave you with a question whose answer is found in this film:

What day was Hercule Poirot born on?
