2596067,5,B000FZETK2,"I love this show. It is truly a nature program, of course its a nature program with Steve-O and Party Boy (Chris Pontius)!

Wildboyz isn't stupid stunts, its stupids in the wild. I've learned alot by watching this show and I've seen places and things on Wildboyz, that I have never seen anywhere else! The show also features Manny Puig and he is a legend!

If you love nature, the wild and a whole lot of funny to go along with it, its time for the Wildboyz!",1211068800,,458,4.252873563218391
2596068,5,B000FZETK2,"This is a great show, although Steve-O gets annoying with always puking and whining about stuff. It's just a good formula, though.",1199577600,,130,4.954545454545454
2596069,4,B000FZETK2,"this series is exactly what you would come to expect with the wild boyz, and most of the jackass crew in general; hilariously stupid, or stupidly hilarious.  plenty of great moments in each episode make this a dvd capable of being watched in succession and many times over.",1178064000,,273,4.6875
2596070,5,B000FZETK2,"Love that Pontius in the viking outfit, mmm.  Well, same old shenanigans as before.  Travel, pain, vomit, gross-outs, you name it, they've done it, where do I sign up?",1169596800,3,167,4.724137931034483
2596071,5,B000FZETK2,"I love the Wildboyz tv show. It's one of the funniest things I've ever seen. These boys are crazy, but you have to love them. It's a good movie if you have a sense of humor. If you don't it wouldn't be for you.",1168300800,,210,3.7954545454545454
2596072,5,B000FZETK2,"Wildboyz have followed up with 2 more great seasons. The animals are different, the countries are different, but the laughs are still the same, and they are plentiful! Stevo, Chris and friends aren't crossing any lines - as they really don't seem to be aware that any lines exist. You are guaranteed plenty of laughs and shocks....and the occasional gross moments.",1167868800,,364,4.983606557377049
2596073,5,B000FZETK2,Wildboyz has 4 seasons out and I have all of them but I have to say that season 3 and 4 have to be the best out of all of them.  They just get better as they go.  If you like the show Jackass or Viva La Bam or any of those shows you will love this.,1167782400,,248,3.3333333333333335
2596074,3,B000FZETK2,"THE SHOW WAS OK TILL STEVE-O STARTED TO ACT LIKE A DIVA IN A FEW EPISODES, HE WAS ONE OF MY FAVORITE ON JACKASS & WILDBOYS & BECAUSE OF THAT ATTITUDE,NOT ANYMORE BRO, I KEEP BAM BETTER!!

ANOTHER THING THAT FOR ME KILLED THE SHOW WAS WHEN FOR THE FIRST TIME THE PRODUCERS WERE FILMING KILLER WHALES EATING SEALS ON THE BEACH!! I DON'T LIKE TO SEE ANIMALS KILLING EACH OTHER OR PEOPLE KILLING ANIMALS,IT IS NOT ENTERTAINMENT BUT A WAY OF ENCOURAGING TO DO THE SAME!!

but all in all,the show is ok!!",1163894400,,498,4.287234042553192
2596075,4,B000FZETK2,"With the recent death of Crocodile Hunter Steve Irwin, Wildboyz, with its irreverent, childish humour, just doesn't seem as funny anymore. Not to mention the show's concept - Jackass meets Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom - seems, well, played out. Perhaps sensing this, the third and fourth seasons spend as much time examining a country's culture as much as its animals.

The boys visit Kenya with fellow Jackass alumni Wee-Man along for the ride. They try their hand at skateboarding the Savannahs and inevitably perform stunts that land them in big piles of, you guessed it, elephant poop. Do you sense a reoccurring theme, here? What makes the show work is that each episode really attempts to open a window (albeit a grotesque one) on a culture radically different from our own. So, we get to see Chris and Steve-O participate in all kinds of traditional rituals practiced by primitive tribes. It doesn't hurt that many of the rituals the two of them are subjected to fit in with the Jackass-style of gross-out humour. Are they trying to say that the Jackass tradition is as old as human culture itself? Probably not - that would be way too sophisticated for this show.

The personalities of Steve-O and, to a larger degree, Chris also account for a large part of the show's appeal. Although, in season three, Steve-O becomes more of a spoil-sport, exhibiting almost diva-like behaviour so that he comes across, at times, like a big whiner. He's okay so long as the joke is not at his expense. Chris, in comparison, is much more easy-going and looks like he's always having fun, like a big kid getting to play with all kinds of wild animals. He seems willing to try anything and isn't a complainer like his partner. Their pal Manny Puig appears frequently, displaying a lot of guts... or stupidity as in one episode he sneaks up on a lion and grabs its tail!

The DVD advertises itself as ""Unrated"" and while the language is indeed not bleeped, nudity is still censored.

The first disc features commentaries for all the episodes in season three by Steve-O, Chris Pontius, Manny Puig, Johnny Knoxville, Wee-Man, Loomis Fall and co-creators/producers Jeff Tremaine and Dimitry Elyashkevich. These typically rowdy tracks feature everyone fighting to get a word in edge-wise while also making fun of Steve-O at every opportunity.

The second disc features commentaries by the same participants for all the episodes in season four. Knoxville sits in on the Russia episodes helping deliver one of the more spirited tracks as all the ""creative"" camerawork during the ballet sequence is pointed out. They also make fun of Chris' ""cat-like reflexes"" during the hockey sequence.

The third disc features ""Outtakes,"" footage of Chris and Steve-O goofing around between ""takes."" Also included is funny footage of animals being their usual unpredictable selves.

""Bonus Segments"" feature footage that didn't make the cut, including Chris and Steve-O getting wasted with some drunk Russians on very potent alcohol that is quite funny to watch.

""Wildboyz: Over and Out"" is a behind-the-scenes featurette. Chris, Steve-O and Knoxville all say that Russia was their favourite country to visit. Everyone tells anecdotes about what they feel are the most memorable moments that, surprisingly, doesn't repeat much of what is said on the commentaries.

""Top 10 Wildboyz Moments"" features Steve-O, Chris, Manny, Knoxville and Wee-Man pick their favourite moments from the past two seasons.

""Photo Gallery"" includes pictures from the last two seasons.

Finally, there is ""Nintendo DS Ad - Behind the Scenes"" which takes a look at Steve-O and Chris shooting an ad for Nintendo's latest gaming system. We see them messing around before hand, killing time until the actual ad is shot.",1159488000,11,3765,5.036977491961415
2596076,5,B000FZETK2,"Yeah, so I bought it today and watched the first few shows, realizing, like every other DVD that says ""Uncensored"", that it is in fact not fully uncensored.  The whole nudist colony scene was blurred, along with a few other things.  If I'm not mistaken, the cuss words aren't bleeped, but I haven't heard many, or am so use to them, I can't even pick them out anymore.  The DVD packaging is awesome, and the show is great, so it's worth the buy, but just take note that it is somewhat false advertisement...",1158019200,10,507,4.43010752688172

2596115,3,B000FZETK2,Seasons one and two were slices of fried gold.  Season's 3 and 4 were really kind of phoned in by the guys which they actually admit during the commentary.  The episodes when Knoxville joins them are the best which further solidifies him as the glue that holds Jackass together.  Overall I would absolutely recommend it because even phoned in it is really good stuff.,1250726400,,367,4.703125

8128063,5,B000FZETK2,This is better than Jackass or the Bam spinoffs in my opinion. Pontius and Steve-O found something here. It's funny and holds up over time. Try watching old Jackass or Viva la Bam and see if you still think it's good.,1467676800,,217,4.317073170731708
