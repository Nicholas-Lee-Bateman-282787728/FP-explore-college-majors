8275378,4,B0019VGLDY,"Beyond the stream of time, there lay a peaceful capital city on sacred ground protected by Four Gods.
  One day, the Four Gods were stolen away and the capital of this alternate world is overrun by vengeful spirits.
  ""HARUKA-Beyond the Stream of Time-A Tale of the Eight Guardians"" is a tale of Akane, the chosen priestess of the Dragon God and her Eight Guardians as they clash against the demon clan in hope of saving the capital.
  The storyline of ""HARUKA"" may be reminiscent to past anime hits such as ""Fushigi Yuugi"" and ""The Vision of Escaflowne"" which three high school students, Akane and her friends Tenma and Shimon are whisked away to another world.
  But that's where the comparisons end.  The story based on the hit manga series ""Harukanaru Toki no Naka de"" by Mizuno Tohko (currently serialized on ""Shojou Beat"") features a storyline that takes place in the Heian period and you are introduced to several characters in the first two episodes.
  In the first episode, you see the demon known as Akram who summons Akane to another world.
  Akane, alone and separated away from her friends learns that she has special powers and is told that she is the priestess of the Dragon God but with people wanting to be close to her, she doesn't know who to trust.
  What she does know is that she has destructive power that she has no control of.  Power that could save the peaceful capital city or power to destroy everyone.
  I found the first two episodes engaging, enjoyable and visually, the artwork and character designs to be lush and beautiful.
  The beauty of the Heian period is captured very well in the anime series and the characters are well-acted.
  There are a total of 26-episodes in the entire series and Bandai Visual plans to release a total of nine volumes.
  Each volume contains an 8-page booklet which features artwork, an episode synopsis, character profiles, poetry and staff interview with director Tsunaki Aki and other creators.
  The DVD is only in Japanese with English subtitles but I hope that doesn't deter a curious viewer because the Japanese voice acting on ""HARUKA"" features a very good number of top notch voice actors which include Kawakami Tomoko (Utena from ""Revolutionary Girl Utena"", Chiriko of ""Fushigi Yuugi"" and Noelle of ""Tenshi ni Narumon""); Shin-Ichiro Miki (Kojiro (James) of ""Pokemon"", Fujiwara Takumi of ""Initial D"" and Urahara Kisuke of ""Bleach""); Tomokazu Seki (of ""Gundam"" fame and also Van Fanel of ""The Vision of Escaflowne"", Hidaka Ken of ""Weiss Kreuz"") and more.
  As for special features, there is bonus footage of ""The Demon's Soliloquy"" which is more or less the demon Akram talking about the next upcoming episode.
  As for the first two episodes alone, I'm pretty much guessing that the viewer will be in for one emotional roller coaster storyline filled with a lot of action throughout the whole series.
  The first volume of ""HARUKA -Beyond the Stream of Time-A Tale of the Eight Guardians"" is definitely one of the most beautiful and enjoyable anime to come out in 2008.  Definitely check it out!",1218153600,,3069,4.8403846153846155
8275379,3,B0019VGLDY,"Two episodes, $30, no dub track and hardly any extras made this a hard sell for me and even after I finished this volume I found myself really wavering on how much I should be recommending this to others. While fans who are already familiar with the series might be willing to pay the MSRP tag on this one, casual fans who aren't as familiar are going to have a hard time justifying the purchase since you really aren't getting much for your money. For now, I'm going to stick with suggesting this one as a rental or sale purchase but unless you already know that you're going to enjoy the next five volumes, I wouldn't pay full price for it.",1214092800,4,642,4.31404958677686
