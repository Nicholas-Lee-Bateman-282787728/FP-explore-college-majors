1397872,4,B000056L2U,"This is the one: the Troma film that may make prior Troma films seem restrained and timid.  This time lloyd held nothing back and if prior movies really pushed the envelope of raunch and depravity then here Lloyd rippes that envelope wide open here.  Terror Firmer has everything that Troma has always promised: Gore, nudity, filth and pointed jabs.  The pace is manic, and driven and the acting is in some of the stronger Troma tradition, and I admit there will always be a wet place in my heart for Debbie Rochon.
Troma has gone from being a 2 bit exploitation house to being America's formost Subversive.  Herein may lie the problem for me, after Tromeo and Juliet my expectations and hopes may have been too high.  While all the elements of Tromeo are here (Minus that one scene with Jane Jensen and Debbie Rochon) it doesn't quite reach the levels that Tromeo did.  I guess it serves me right for taking it too seriously but Lloyd himself has adopted the mantra ""Lets make some art!!"" and he has done so before.  This time however he misses his high mark by just a smidge.
Lloyd is clearly relishing his role as an elder-statesman of the low budget indie scene here and this may be why Terror Firmer misses its mark.  All of Troma's best work so far has targeted us, society and our hipocracy so the heroes were Toxie and Sgt. Kabukiman NYPD.  This time the target is film and art and the hero is Lloyd himself.  While he certainly pokes fun at himself he is a bit too self-congratulatory.  Yes Lloyd IS a hero and he is one of the last standing voices for truly independent film, none of this is in question, but Lloyd's vision is too narrow.  There are many heroes who are on the front lines: Lynch, Cronenberg, VonTrier, Fincher who are all fighting to push film, kicking and screaming usually, into the this millenium.  All this would be fine and merely academic, if it were not for what it does to the film.  Unlike Toxie, Tromeo, Killer Condom and others, Terror Firmer's preachy edge, isn't tempered by humanity or other concerns; we aren't talking about saving the earth or our own humanity in this one, but rather the validity of Troma's particular form of Art.  It is an important message but it was ultimately not enough to push Terror Firmer into the hights Lloyd had given us before.",982022400,,2301,4.5375302663438255
1397873,3,B000056L2U,"I have to qualify my review noting that I saw this movie on late night TV on a business trip in London. I dozed frequently and can't honestly say that I saw or can remember all the movie. Doesn't matter. What I did see may be the most outrageous movie I've ever seen. I don't know whether to give it 5 stars or none. Clearly it is a comedy, a parody of 'body part' movies, and a showcase of gorey special effects. It is also loaded with naked women (and men), extreme profanity, sex, and sheer, total goofyness. And more gore. While I was at times repelled by the gore...at other times I couldn't help but laugh. While I'll never forget this movie, I'm not sure I could stand to watch it again (though I suspect, like Pulp Fiction, the sheer goofyness will win out on repeated viewings). This will definitely become a classic cult movie of some type or another. You'll never see it uncut on American TV.",980812800,,903,4.349112426035503
1397874,5,B000056L2U,"First off, if you're a child, don't watch this movie.  It's very boring, nothing happens, everybody in it is really very nice and happy and likes to play bingo.
Are we adults alone?  Good.  Now, if you're faint of heart, or easily offended, get away from this movie.  Everybody else, you should see it ASAP.  It's a riot.  It's sick, perverted, disgusting... use all the adjectives you want.  It's also VERY funny, and oddly moving in a way.  It shows a lot of true love for the art of making movies, and makes the point that it's something one should only do for love.  That's a good message, I think.  Mainly, though, the movie is just insanely funny.
As for the DVD...  Wow.  The 100-minute documentary is easily one of the best I've ever seen about making movies (the one on ""Magnolia"" may be better, but not by much).  The commentary tracks are all great, too, especially Lloyd Kaufman's.
If you love independent cinema, horror films, and demented comedy, then it is your solemn duty to buy this DVD.  Heck, buy two, give one away... but not to kids!",980467200,,1055,4.5132275132275135
1397875,5,B000056L2U,"Terror Firmer (and Lloyd Kaufman) continue Troma's proud tradition of gratuitious sex and violence, black comedy, and pointless references to other Troma films. The film provides hilarious insight into what it takes to make a Troma-type horror/sex/comedy/sex film while a serial killer runs rampant on the set.  Terror Firmer has an over-the-top performance by Will Keenan and a Mel Brooks-inspired performance by Lloyd Kaufman.  If you're a fan of Troma you'll love Terror Firmer, and if you're not a fan, this film may change your mind about those loveable misfits.  You can only wonder if this is how the folks at Troma make all of their films.  Wow, to spend one day on their set...",980208000,,686,4.939130434782609

There's plenty of nudity, sex, Troma-tic violence, and bad cheesy acting in general...only from Troma, of course! Well, since I'm a big fan of most Troma movies, I'm giving this one 5 stars before I even watch it. Any Troma fan with a DVD player should just pick this one up!",979948800,,544,4.3431372549019605

This movie absolutely wallows in filth, and it is a truly glorious thing to behold. Terror Firmer is a gigantic middle finger aimed at the establishment, at the film system that tries to build movies into a kind of pretentios pinnacle of smug selfrighteousness and at the moral guardians who devote their lives to protecting nonexistent children from the wicked world.

Terror Firmer is the movie equivalent of punk rock.

1397916,5,B000056L2U,"I have never learned as much about the ins and outs of filmmaking as when I could actually watch one baing made, whether it be on set, or viewing a DVD like this. Of course, the BEST way to learn filmmaking is to MAKE one, like I did in film class.

Failing that, the next best way to learn is to watch what NOT to do on set. Terror Firmer recounts fictionally making The Toxic Avenger, with Lloyd Kaufman as a blind director who has to deal with a madman stalikng the cast and crew.

Lloyd, a madman in real life, is shown in the added documentary of this film as pretty much the last person you'd want riding your ass (except maybe Jim Cameron, another madman, though ecologically conscious), and, as in every other doc about a Troma film, you're left pretty much watching Lloyd tear into a bunch of total douchebags, many of whom DO know their head from their ass, but still manage to let Lloyd make them (and often HIMSELF) look like absolute TOOLS. And I plan to pitch a script to him next month! HIGHLY recommended.",1277510400,,1021,4.340314136125654
1397927,5,B000056L2U,"When a movie opens with an unborn fetus being ripped out of a woman's stomach while she screams for mercy you can probably assume a couple things about that film.
1. You are in for an interesting and possibly vomit inducing hour and a half.
2. You are probably watching a Troma movie.
Troma turns the camera on itself with this one and creates an outrageous and violent self-parody.  If you're a fan of Troma, especially their later work like Tromeo and Juliet, and Poultrygeist, this is the movie for you.  It's everything that is Troma times 100.  If you're not familiar with their work, what this means is: blood, guts, sex, vomit, piss, sex, blood, and immaturity being rapidly fired from the screen and violating every one of your senses.

1397928,4,B000056L2U,"A low budget studio is working on the newest installment of ""The Toxic Avenger"", blind director Larry Benjamin (Lloyd Kaufman) is readying the project. Unfortunately a homicidal maniac is on the loose in the city slaughtering innocent people and collecting their parts, the unknown killer hides out in the studio to kill off the actors during the filming of the movie and one of the workers must try to stop this cretin.

Exciting, ultraviolent, funny and sleazy horror comedy satire from cult movie company Troma is inspired by Lloyd Kaufman's book ""How i learned about filmmaking i learned from The Toxic Avenger"". It has a movie-within-a-movie-about-a-movie feel like ""New Nightmare"" and a good dark self-referential sense of humor to go along with it, the film is quite gory as hell even if it is cartoonish and has memorable moments like Michael Hertz (notable Troma actor and producer) getting mutilated by an escalator in Tex Avery fashion. This movie offers tasteless gags, nudity, sex, rock music and appearences by The Toxic Avenger and Sgt. Kabukiman NYPD as it's one of the better and more bloodier Troma movies yet.

The 2-Disc DVD set is phenomenal! It has great extras like three audio commentaries, Deleted scenes with optional commentary, hidden easter eggs, a full length documentary on the making of the movie, trailers to this and other Troma movies, outtakes, interactive Terror Firmer video game, Intro to the TromaDance film festival, music videos, gyno talk with  Terror Firmer actress Alyce LaTourelle, chat with Charolette Kaufman, Lloyd Kaufman book intro, comic book to film comparisions, auditions, alternate scenes and endings that were filmed for the Cannes film festival and an option to watch the movie with the deleted scenes in.",1210723200,4,1763,5.1573426573426575

Surely the intestines and blood spilling looked like rubber balloon animals but hey, it's Troma! Im really happy I bought this film, but I did not recieve my free mini poster that claimed was inside the case. Oh well, the film is worth the false advertising. The fat naked guy running through New York and getting his head crushed by a car is a classic! Disc 2 also has the Terror Firmer video game which is tons of fun and incredibly gory. BUY it. !

Unless you have a rather dry or sick sense of humor, you might want to avoid 'Terror Firmer' altogether. I, myself thought it was a scream. The plot is a low-budget movie company in their attempt to make the movie 'Toxic Avenger,Part IV',when they discover the entire crew is being stalked by a sexual deviant. If you believe you've seen it all in movies, just WAIT until you see the culprit when he shows everyone how his abusive father had messed him up for life. Ugh!!

1397935,4,B000056L2U,"I like some of Lloyd Kaufman's movies and despise others.  This is, by far, my favorite.  Unlike Troma's War or Class of Nuk'em High, this movie is actually funny.  The writing is excellent, the story is absurd, the acting ranges from inspired to perfectly adequate, the effects are silly, the characters are engaging (I absolutely dug the Toddster and his death by bong scene is fantastic. ""Brain go Bye Bye,"") and there are a lot of fun cameos to look out for.

I have a feeling that Douglas Buck had a lot to do with the success of Terror Firmer.  I only say this because I have seen his short film, Cutting Moments, and it is absolutely amazing.  So I suspect that he might have elevated this effort from the level of the usual Troma production.  Just a guess.

It's not perfect; some of the stuff with Ron Jeremy towards the end gets a little hokey for me.  But hey, what the hell, this is a seriously fun movie.

1397949,1,B000056L2U,"This is perhaps the most entertaining Zero star film I have ever seen.
While I somehow managed to sit through the whole thing (i did, I admit have a hatchet which I frequently cut myself with, swear to God) I can't say I hold any value of it whatsoever. By and Large, I was appalled.
Now don't you dar call me soft. I own DEAD ALIVE, which has been called the goriest movie of all time (albeit not even close to the grossest) In fact, that honor belongs to Terror Firmer, which pretty much sums up my whole thoughts on Troma.
But let me discuss the film first. It's movie within a movie plot gives way to numerous characters and shenanigans. We have, among other things, ample mutilation, hemaphrodites, suicides, brain removals, the smallest penis ever on film for all of Times square to see (with a magnifying glass, maybe), and gratuitous vomiting. Now, a note on the vomiting. I hate to see puke in movies, so maybe its the sickening barf-fest in the limo (or the guy who makes out with a girl still covered in his own vomit) that drug this film into zero star territory for me.
And yes, I have seen BAD TASTE, and I actually enjoyed the bowl-o-chuck ritual in that film. There is a difference.  This film presents it in the most disgusting and explicitve manner ever.
Did I mention a man eats his own member?
Now don't take me for a stuck-up cinema snob. I like Troma. I like Lloyd Kaufman. While I hate these films (I've the toxic Avenger 1-4, this, and troma dance vol. 1., which is possibly the biggest waste of plastic ever) I admire the rough-and-tumble, bootstrap, and shameless spirit of Troma studios. I enjoyed the feature length documentary  that follows the filming process of Terror Firmer. These are delightful people who believe in what they are doing, and without pretension. I am thankful that a studio like that can thrive, even I hate their movies.

Terror Firmer takes place on the making of a film. The film is on the making of a film. While this film is getting made there is someone killing off each member of the crew one by one in pretty sick and brutal ways. I don't know what else to say except that THIS MOVIE ROCKS! No other movie out there has ever had me cringing and laughing at the same time. Aside from all the humor in this film (which could have been just a little better) there is some great gore effects, some of the best I've actually seen in a long time (surprisingly because this isn't a big budget picture). There is also lots of great softcore sex and nudity and basically everything people love to see but are too afraid to admit they do.
The extras are unlimited. There are trailers from other sick upcoming troma films, music videos (featuring even more xxx material) and a one and a half hour ""Making of"" Documentary on the making of Terror Firmer. And may I say this is definitely the BEST making of documentary I've scene of any making of featurrette on any film ever! Why? Because it's real. While other making of's are showing you interviews of people talking about how great their co-actors and directors are, this one doesnt have any of that fake stuff. It shows you deep behind the scenes with actors getting angry, the director screaming at everyone, and bloopers throughout.

1397952,4,B000056L2U,"""Terror Firmer"" is yet another seedy contribution to the world of cinema by the gang at Troma films. Lloyd Kaufman, the founder of Troma, continues to offer up films loaded with soft-core sex, sickening gore, and acting so bad that it makes a home movie look like a Shakespeare production. Kaufman's best known film is ""The Toxic Avenger,"" a 1985 release that, despite the bizarre premise, succeeded beyond anyone's wildest expectations. Troma took the modest success of ""Avenger"" and promptly ran it into the ground with a series of stupid sequels and shameless self-promotion. To a great extent, ""Terror Firmer"" is itself a means of promoting Troma and its no budget films.

""Terror Firmer"" is a film about making a film, namely a behind the scenes look at the making of ""The Toxic Avenger Part 4."" In the process of creating yet another sequel in the Toxic Avenger franchise, we learn that a serial killer is hunting down members of the cast and crew. Kaufman himself stars as the blind (yes, blind) director of the film, interacting with cast and crew members played by Debbie Rochon, Alyce LaTourelle, Will Keenan, Kaufman's real life daughter, adult film star Ron Jeremy, Lemmy from the thrash band Motorhead, and Troma co-founder Michael Herz. Many of these people appeared in other Troma films, so ""Terror Firmer"" seems to be a sort of reunion/chef-d'oeuvre for Kaufman and company.

The idea behind ""Terror Firmer"" is to show how difficult it is to make a low budget film. We constantly see the trials and tribulations that actors and crew face during a shooting schedule. Apparently, romances always blossom on a film set, as does professional jealousy. Throw in a pain-in-the-you-know-what prima donna leading lady and you have a typical day in the movie business. In the warped world of Troma, however, there must also be mutilations, interesting uses of a pickle, body parts that stretch like plastic, and a serial killer who looks like a poor man's Tim Curry from ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show.""

Kaufman relies on tons of sight gags, multiple storylines, gratuitous nudity, and disgusting gore to entertain and sicken his audience. Many of the scenes in ""Terror Firmer"" take place behind the cameras, where dozens of people mill around during the course of the film shoot. It pays to watch closely what people in the background are doing, or else you may miss many of the gags. Also present throughout the film are constant references to Troma: film posters, spoken panegyrics, and other assorted advertising gimcracks. The shameless promotion for all things Troma tends to grate very quickly.

The gore in ""Terror Firmer"" is well done for any movie, let alone a Troma film. Herz's unfortunate encounter with an escalator may be one of the sickest scenes ever witnessed by this viewer, rivaling anything done by grindhouse maestros Lucio Fulci or Ruggiero Deodato. Other attempts at gory violence do not work as well due to an insistence on pairing the grue with extraordinarily dumb slapstick humor. For the determined gorehound, however, ""Terror Firmer"" offers up a congeries of stomach churning scenes.

This is a two-disc set, with an unbelievable amount of extras included. There are deleted scenes, actor auditions, a ""making of"" documentary, interviews with actors, bloopers, trailers, and several music videos directed by Lloyd Kaufman (which are highly unlikely to appear on MTV or VH1 anytime in the future). There are so many extras on these discs that it takes hours to get through all of them. Did I mention that there are three different commentary tracks? As for sound and picture quality, both are more than adequate for enjoyment of the film and the extras. If you shell out the money for this movie, you will definitely get enough bang for your buck.

Ultimately, ""Terror Firmer"" is an entertaining film, although I still believe that ""The Toxic Avenger"" is the best movie Troma will ever produce.",1048204800,11,3931,4.993893129770992

I saw it on late night cable, and it was so disturbingly gross and twisted that it was all I could do to sit through it without hurling chips and beer I had just consumed. And yes, I intend this as a compliment, for it has always been Troma's aim to push it to the extreme. However, I can't imagine them pushing it any further, because there may not be any further to go.
In the first 30 seconds of this movie, we see a guy get his leg ripped off and then used as a club to beat him to death, and a pregnant woman's fetus ripped from her stomach while she is still alive. These are some of the least graphic scenes in the movie, and the pace doesn't slow down for a second. If you're into this kind of thing (and you know who you are), you can't miss this movie.

1397964,4,B000056L2U,"This DVD is the ""R"" rated version of Troma's greatest movie ever. The real version is the unrated one; only buy this one after you have bought the unrated version. This one, though, is quite good. The director, Lloyd Kaufman, occasionally interrupts the story in order to tell viewers what he had to take out in order to get this rating; he is joined at times by star Yaniv Sharon. The ""cuts"" made are obvious, too. He does not try to hide the fact that some of the scenes had to be trimmed in order to qualify for the MPAA/CARA ""R"" rating, unlike some other movies.
This only increases the comedic value of this movie. However, it is not as good as the unrated version, this latter being the single greatest motion picture ever released. Neither does this DVD have all of the bonus materials that the other version has on the first disc. However, the second disc remains the same for both versions.
So I would recommend that you only order this particular version of the movie after you have seen the Unrated Directors Cut. Once you have seen the other, the ""real"" version of this movie, you will enjoy this version more.",1011052800,2,1122,4.504901960784314

1397977,4,B000056L2U,"I'll tell you why.
Troma, the undisputed champs of Gonzo Exploitation Trash, have come up with a doozy. Packed to the gills with Tromatic mayhem, ""Terror Firmer"" is something of a celebration. It treats its core audience to massive amounts of violence, nudity, vomit, and vaguely rubbery gore. In fact, Director Lloyd Kaufman takes things to such an extreme that ""TF"" actually becomes something of a self-parody (a point made abundantly clear during the open credits, in which the killer treats a pregnant woman to an unsolicited abortion. The book the hapless victim is reading? Kaufman's ""All I Need to Know About Filmmaking I Learned From the Toxic Avenger""). Plus it has uniformly good, spirited performances from a cast that really looks into it, and the DVD is loaded with extras, including a somewhat disturbing making-of documentary (more on that later).
So why 4 stars instead of 5? Maybe because ""TF"" comes on the heels of the majestic ""Tromeo & Juliet,"" a modern classic that has such a great script that it brings a certain innocence to the work. ""TF"" has no such innocence. It is corrupt to the core (check out the reappearance of Ron Jeremy after we discover the killer's identity). And that's fine - Troma has certainly earned the right to be corrupt - but the best Troma flicks, like ""The Toxic Avenger"" and ""Tromeo,"" have a heart of sweetness buried within the dismemberments and goo. And there's an awful lot of self-congratulation going on, which gets pretty damn irritating at times (""What's that web address again? [...]?""). The Troma fan knows what makes Troma so great, and they don't need to be reminded of it in such a smug fashion.
But on the whole, ""TF"" is a rollicking good time for those who can stomach it. Be sure to check out the DVD extras, including the feature-length documentary that reveals the seemingly cuddly Lloyd Kaufman as a true tyrant (but it's to his credit that he allows himself to be seen this way). There's some Tromatic music videos as well, and some satisfyingly disturbing trailers for other Troma releases. All in all, it's quite a package, even if it makes you recall a classic line from the film:

The plot of TERROR FIRMER is very simple: the cast and crew of a Troma movie are being stalked and murdered by a serial killer. There is plenty of violence, cheesy acting, male/female nudity, jokes, and 'mystery guest' cameos.
The special features on the DVD set include: 3 cool music videos, a behind-the-scenes documentary, trailers for other Troma movies, audio commentary, deleted scenes, alternate footage, and much more!

Heads get squashed, legs are severed, people get covered with poo, there's puking and a fat guy gets shredded in an escalator!

1397983,5,B000056L2U,"Terror Firma is an independant film made by Troma, one of the last (if not THE last) small time movie companies left in the United States.  You should purchase this movie if for no other reason than to support independant film.  But once you do buy it, what will you get?  An incredibaly funny, very violent, and fairly titilating movie.
I was talked into watching this movie by an aquantance.  Never having seen a Troma film, I wasn't sure what to expect.  I thought it would be a low budget slasher flick with lots of fake blood.  I was mostly wrong.  It turned out to be a very funny and interesting satire on the movie industry, movie making, and society in general.  (While also being a slasher flick with lots of fake blood.)  I haven't laughed as much at a movie in years.
As for the acting, while most of the actors will never utter the words ""I'd like to thank the Academy,"" the female lead, Alyce LaTourelle, was simply excellent.  I was surprised to see someone with as much talent in a low budget picture like this one.  She is destined for bigger pictures, but not nessisarily better ones.
The Extras:  The DVD is a two disc set that as some of the best extras of ANY DVD I've seen (an I have hundreds.)  Most ""making of featurettes"" are nothing but the actors talking on the set about how excited they are to be making the movie, with clips from the movie thrown in.  This DVD has a 90+ minute movie showing the whole process from the first day of shooting to the premier.  I would have paid ... for this alone.  They also have many deleted scenes, alternative scenes, and bloopers.  There's footage of  the actors auditioning for the movie (when's the last time you saw that on a DVD?)  But wait, there's more!  Three music videos (that are quite good,) interviews with two of the actors, and theatrical trailers.  Not to mention three, count `em, three audio comentaries.  Oh yea, and plenty of easter eggs!  All together,  one of the most feature packed discs out there.
One word about the screen format.  This movie, as with most, if not all of Tromas movies, was filmed in 4:3, so this IS in it's original format.  This disc is NOT pan and scan.

I was extremely disappointed that the theatre said that under absolutely no circumstances will anyone under 18 will anyone be admitted into this movie.  Disappointed, I wrote a letter to Lloyd and attatched a copy of an essay I wrote about how he was my hero.  To my surprise, someone from Troma's offices called and arranged for me to meet Lloyd one-on-one at the Rock'N'Roll Hall of Fame.  To make a long story short, Lloyd spent the afternoon with me, and he was by far THE nicest, kindest person I've ever met, and he encouraged me to persue my passion for film.  He gave me one strong word of advice:  Don't see Terror Firmer.  Now that I own it on dvd (*hah*) I know exactally what me meant.  I cannot believe that the same gentelman made this movie, and was the one cursing througout the documentary.  The whole point of this story is: This movie has no stops.  It's even sicker than the conversations that highschoolers have at lunch.  I love it.
