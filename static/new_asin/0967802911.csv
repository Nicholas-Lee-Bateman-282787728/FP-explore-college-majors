The delicate beauty and strength of the silk, the fabrics and the people is beyond words. If you are a lover of the magic of textiles you must see this! Watch it with a child. Share it with everyone you know. It will change the way they look at cloth.",1210118400,,396,4.364864864864865
7794046,5,0967802911,"This video is so beautiful, I don't even know what to say about it.  You see the artists as well as their work, their environment.  You see the artists feeding silk worms, explaining how the food of the worm influences the color of the threads. Another artist is seen gathering bark to create natural dyes.  This video is wonderful.",1025136000,,332,4.593220338983051
