Another excellent in the TV series The Man From U.N.C.L.E.
I highly recommend this and all the other episodes to anyone with a taste for the ""cold war"" and the spies series back in the 60's. Channel D out.....john.a.carman@gmail.com",1332028800,,251,5.0
3446470,5,B001AB69RG,"Just finished re-watching Season 1 and Season 4...just starting 2 now...ah, those were days!  Very clear lines between the Good Guys and Bad Guys and Napoleon and Illya were the best of the Good Guys (along with Kelly Robinson and Alexander Scott, of course!).  Not quite sure if I'll ever own Season 3 - I may just pretend there was no third season and just stay one season away from owning the complete series...",1312243200,6,414,4.581081081081081
3446471,5,B001AB69RG,"I got this after viewing Season 1 last year and reading the reviews about Season 2.
I thoroughly enjoyed these ""affairs"" in color and the dialog was crisp and easily understood for
these old ears - but English captions are available.
Of course slightly biased since I love seeing the hair styles, clothes, and the flashy convertibles
(with red vinyl interior) of my youth. A most see.",1294531200,2,384,4.746268656716418
3446472,5,B001AB69RG,"If you grew up in the early 60's, you must remember the Man From UNCLE. Spies, new gadgets, technology(?), funny lines, fighting evil doers---this was one fantastic show. And the names ""Illya"" and ""Napoleon"", well, what can I say about them! I will never forget this.",1261872000,4,267,4.826086956521739
3446473,4,B001AB69RG,"When people think of THE MAN FROM U.N.C.LE. season 2 is generally what they remember.  This was the season that had the show in the top ten.  Some of the seriousness was lost with the departure of Sam Rolfe, it is, nonetheless, a memorable and entertaining season.  First noticable change is Lalo Schfrin's reworking of Jerry Goldsmith's theme, changing the beat and adding flutes, bass and bongos. A first rate slate of guest stars: Vincent Price, Rip Torn, Maurice Evans, Angela Lansbury, Martin Landau etc.  Most memorable episodes: ""The Alexander the Greater Affair""(the opening two-parter), ""The Bridge of Lions Affair"", ""The Adriatic Express Affair"", ""The Foxes and Hounds Affair"".  All in all, a good year.  Season Three would be something quite different.",1260057600,10,763,5.213114754098361

3446476,2,B001AB69RG,"Remembered this series fondly as a kid.  And, as I'm thoroughly enjoying working my way through all the seasons of Mission Impossible, I figured I'd give the Man from U.N.C.L.E a try.

Bad idea. For me, the series REALLY doesn't stand the test of time. It's grossly dated.  The plots are poor, the dialog is terrible.

Sad.  I couldn't watch more than a couple of episodes.  Definitely NOT recommended.",1479513600,,402,4.753623188405797

3446478,5,B001AB69RG,I used to watch this series as a kid. After getting all of the series I watch this series often. I watch it via streaming and it's very clear for a series from the 60's.

3446480,5,B001AB69RG,"This is an excellent introduction to one of the best spy shows of the 60's. This in my opinion is the best season of the series. It is in color, unlike the first season and it has perfect balance between humor and seriousness. I give it 5 stars.",1474156800,,245,4.125
3446481,5,B001AB69RG,"2nd Season in it's entirety and I believe this was the show's best of it's 4 seasons. Everything pops nicely and this is the kind of show that really needed to be in color. 1st Season in b&w is fine, but stories and sets really come alive in Season 2. Fairly priced, great prints.",1473811200,,280,4.203703703703703

3446483,5,B001AB69RG,"I loved the first season so I got the second season.  Now, I am trying to write
the review for it.  It was great to see Solo and Kuryakin in color and in action
again.  Some of the episodes were not bad although a few were silly (The Round
Table Affair, The Bat Cave Affair, and The Indian Affairs Affair).  My favorite include
The Alexander the Greater Affair, The Ultimate Computer Affair, The Arabian Affair, The
Foxes and Hounds Affair, The Discotheque Affair, The Tigers are Coming Affairs, The
Deadly Toys Affair, The Children's Day Affair, The Waverly Ring Affair to name a few.

Along with Danger Man (Secret Agent Man), this is the essential special operatives series to have in your collection. Good stories, smooth acting from the Uncle protagonists and the all time best theme music (second season) ever made are the hallmarks of this series.

3446497,3,B001AB69RG,"The Man From U.N.C.L.E.: The Complete Second Season contains 30 episodes originally aired on NBC during the 1965-1966 season. The series was TVs answer to the extremely popular James Bond movies. Both From Russia With Love and Goldfinger were in theaters at the time of the TV shows premiere. The plots revolve around two secret agents, Napoleon Solo (Robert Vaughn) and Ilya Kuryakin (David McCallum), who were teamed by U.N.C.L.E. to combat the international crime syndicate T.H.R.U.S.H., composed of terrorists, anarchists, and megalomaniacs.

U.N.C.L.E. (United Network Command for Law and Enforcement) had its secret American headquarters in New York. Heading the office was Alexander Waverly (Leon G. Carroll), who assigned agents to cases and coordinated their efforts. In Season 2, Solo and Kuryakin travel all over the world to take on T.H.R.U.S.H. and its evil allies. Guest appearances include Jill Ireland, Angela Lansbury, Kevin McCarthy, Eve Arden, Vincent Price, Ricardo Montalban, Matin Landau, Rip Torn, Dorothy Provine, and George Sanders.

Stories involved a businessman with an Alexander the Great complex, a deadly mind-reading machine, a group that hunts down former Nazis to steal their looted art collections, a boy genius, deadly bees, an abandoned Foreign Legion base, an amnesia pill, a dangerous diamond thief, radioactive bats, and a Native American reservation that serves as a front to assemble a hydrogen bomb.

For Season 2, episodes were filmed in color and their tone changed from serious drama to comedy and campiness. The show eked out three full seasons. The producers tried to get it back on track by abandoning the camp approach in the fourth season, but it was too late. The show was canceled in January, 1968. Nevertheless, it paved the way for The Wild, Wild West, Get Smart, and Mission: Impossible, and has become a cult favorite.  A feature film based on the series starring Henry Cavill and Armie Hammer was released in 2015.

The Season 2 set contains 10 DVDs.",1454112000,,2008,5.22360248447205

They had no super powers and often get licked.  However, they demonstrated the intestinal fortitude of those who adore freedom.  Great actors and plots.  It's amazing how they get so much of a story told in fifty minutes.  Oh to be thin enough to wear one of those tight suits again.

Note: I originally gave a poor rating this collection because the original 4:3 TV format showed as a ""full screen"" 16:9 cropped image.
