535071,4,6303038522,"Charles Laughton plays Henry Hobson, a blustering, bullying 19th Century British shopkeeper who runs roughshod over his three daughters, who have kept the family shoe shop running while their widowed skinflint of a father drinks up all the profits at the neighborhood pub.  At least, that is, until the eldest of the three breaks away and tells poppa where to get off.  The performance that really makes this film, though, is the magnificent John Mills as the meek, hapless craftsman who she pins her hopes on.  As he grows from noodge to man of means, Mills crafts one of the most endearing characters seen on screen to date.  Recommended.",1037059200,9,640,4.844036697247707
535072,5,6303038522,"If stranded on the proverbial Desert Island, this movie is a must, for it bears viewing time and time again. Masterly performances by Charles Laughton and a very junior Sir John Mills, place this piece in the annuls as being a timeless snapshot of cinematograhic history.
Laughton, as Hobson, shows us the 'perils of the demon drink', in probably one of the most comedic portrayals of all time, as the permanantly inebriated, (though periodical appropriate)stereotypical mysoginistic father, figuring pink elephants/rabbits (included in black and white), whilst his daughter, Maggie (Brenda De Banzie) shows an early impetus for Women's Rights'.
All in all, a classic tale, portrayed in a wonderful display of superb performances... BUY IT, BORROW IT... but you MUST see it!",1031270400,10,774,5.352459016393443
535073,5,6303038522,"Well photographed and edited.  The acting was sumptious; where have the lovable characters gone! The picaresque story was pithy with insights and the image of a strong, yet loving woman, goal-oriented but sensitive to her  male's needs creating a team effort where everyone's abilities flourished.  Truly a gem.",921369600,13,311,5.4375

7834596,4,6303038522,"I've seen parts of Hobson's Choice before on TV. Being able to see it all at once is great. It is a classic movie. It is more than that to me; it moves me to many different emotions. It never boggs down.

Since the movie is British, I sometimes have difficulty following all the dialogue, but that just means I need (want) to watch it again, which I will do.",1272240000,,358,4.114285714285714
7834597,5,6303038522,"I feel myself very fortunate having been introduced to this film some 30 years ago.  I am dying to see it again, but refuse to fork out $49 to see it in VHS.  I would happily pay that price for a criterion DVD and would by another for my father who first showed me this film.

Laughton is absolutely outstanding in this film as is the rest of the cast.  The script is as funny as anything I have seen.  It is amazing that it is not on the American Film Institutes list of top 100 funniest films.  (Perhaps becasue it is not American?)  It has been over thirty years since I last saw it.  But it has been on my Amazon notice list for at least 12 years.

Will someone at Criterion please understand we have seen enough French films from the 50's and it is time to look somewhwere else?",1187395200,4,783,4.098684210526316
7834598,5,6303038522,"It is a rare film that allows a woman to be feminine and a 'hero'.  This is it.  Maggie (played by Brenda de Banzie) is unmarried and thirty in an era when young women were married by the age of eighteen.  She runs her widower father's (hilariously played by Charles Laughton) shop until he begins to selfishly take advantage of his daughters' labour to live the life of a well-to-do bum.  Allowing them to marry would mean that he would have to work hard at the business himself and hire extra employees to boot.

Maggie thwarts his ambitions to be comfortably indolent by being neither shrill nor aggressive.  She is assertive, intelligent and womanly all at once.  She rarely steps out of her feminine role and when she is forced to, one can see her discomfort.  It is such a breath of fresh air to see a film portray a woman in this situation as neither snivelling idiot nor raging b****.  She does not 'kick over the applecart' of her society by waving placards and screeching for 'empowerment' but works within its rules to carve out a good life for herself and those she loves. She even succeeds at starting a business that eventually eclipses that of her father's.  Interestingly, there is a scene in which placard carrying temperance league protesters march down a street which she happens to be on. (The temperance leagues were both the forerunners and catalyst of the suffrage movement).  Considering she is the daughter of a heavy-handed drunkard who, by the rules of Victorian society, owned her, you would think that the protest would have an appeal.  She doen't even give it glance.  Maggie, though, is not only concerned with her own life.  She does not turn her back on her sisters and helps them to marry as well.  She never sets out to hurt or avenge. Maggie fights for what she wants and prevails AS A WOMAN.  Wow.

Should I mention the phenomenal performances in this film?  So many legends,  where to begin?

John Mills:  Watch him turn from caterpillar to butterfly in a brilliant performance.
Charles Laughton:  Sharp, clever and funny.
Prunella Scales:  Later of ""Fawlty Towers"" fame.

And of course The Great David Lean directed.  He directed ""Bridge on the River Kwai"" and ""Lawrence Of Arabia"", great men's 'Hero' movies, to name but a few.  Watch this, his film about a woman 'Hero'.

So few films show women choosing such a path.  Are you interested?  Buy it.  And let's hope some smart and enterprising person gets this gem released on DVD.",1148428800,5,2470,4.68997668997669
7834599,5,6303038522,"A wonderful movie in every way. Charles Laughton plays Henry Hobson, a vulgar old martinet and tippler, who runs a bootshop with his three unmarried daughters. The oldest, Maggie (played by Brenda de Banzie), decides to take matters into her own hands: she chooses the unpromising, lazy bootmaker (John Mills) for her husband (very much against her father's wishes) and they open up their own shop. She is smart and cunning and ambitious, and before long they are successful - so much so that by movie's end they take over Hobson's as equal partners. All three play their parts to perfection, especially de Banzie who has an iron will and knows exactly what she wants and how to get it. It's funny and poignant - and is one of the great movies of all time. Definitely worth a watch.",1138060800,2,782,4.633093525179856
7834600,5,6303038522,"A rare gem of a film poignantly portrayed by a splendid cast. Though it, the Master, David Lean, tells the powerful, wonderful and timeless story of the profound difference a woman's ""call"" can make in her life, the life of her man, and the world. This is my wife's and my favorite film! Like fine wine, enjoy, be transformed, touched, inspired and moved to tears. Don't miss it and don't forget to share it with others!",1136851200,2,420,4.5394736842105265
7834601,5,6303038522,"I guess there would not be any doubt that the British humor was never so well articulated and expressed in this country. In the fifties U.K. reached the peak in the comedy genre. It would be said that the Pos War catharsis worked out so well that suddenly the British understood and absorbed once more the War consequences, faster than any other country. While the American Cinema was in a self exploration of the emotional state and analytical introspection, this side of the Atlantic simply eluded that position and decided to turn on the page.

Charles Laughton in an outstanding performance is a very worried father by her oldest daughter's singleness. But the choice is not so easy he is owner of a little enterprise and wants as all good father to trespass his patrimony to the best candidate. But you know how it is: the father and the son have always different perspectives. The smart dialogues and funny situations will lead to Laughton to understand at last, he was wrong, after all.

The cast is simply overwhelming and glorious Lean's  camera will invite you to a delightful comedy plenty of intelligence and good taste humor.

A classic. Excellent performances of Brenda De Vance and John Mills.",1117065600,2,1208,4.821256038647343

7834603,5,6303038522,"I had never seen or heard of this low-key delightful treasure until I came across it in our local library more than 15 years ago. Beautifully scripted and acted, it has gentle humour and the best before-and-after-the-wedding-night scenes I have ever seen. I bought my own copy, which has become a favourite in my family and with everyone I've lent it to. As a result my video is rapidly wearing out. Bring on the DVD - SOON. I'll buy a dozen to give to to my closest friends so they'll leave my copy alone!",1099094400,11,506,4.3936170212765955
