1678053,5,B00005YUPN,"My son loves this DVD.  We watch it together and he's mesmerized by the music and all the colorful, moving images.  At some points he bursts with laughter or begins to chatter excitedly.  He also enjoys listening to the music while he plays with his toys.  He hasn't shown much interest in the vocabulary or reading yet but I imagine he will since he loves listening to people speaking different languages.",1021852800,,406,4.676056338028169
1678054,5,B00005YUPN,"My 4 month old loves to watch Baby Mozart.  We watch it atleast once a day.  He smiles and laughs at certain parts (like the green lizard puppet).  It is amazing to watch him while he watches this video.  It also will calm him down if he is cranky, and keep him entertained for about 20 minutes so my husband and I can eat dinner.  I also like that the DVD has music you can play without the video.  I definitely recommend this for any baby!",1020729600,,441,4.069767441860465
1678055,5,B00005YUPN,"My daughter would look at this video from the time she was two weeks old.  I would hold her near the screen and she would be in awe.
When she got a bit older, she would sit in her bouncer and watch the whole thing.  She did this very early.  A little over a month and she was riveted to it.
She is four months now..and she loves it so much.  There is a dragon in it, and every time he comes on the screen, she bursts into laughter!!!
I would highly recommend this...only buy the DVD if you can...the DVD will allow you to watch the same scene over and over..(like the Dragon)..or to rewind in an instant.
This is her favorite thing to do...and baby einstein dvd too..
it gives mommy or daddy a few moments to fold laundry or take a phone call.  Love this item.",1020124800,,760,4.073825503355705

1678057,5,B00005YUPN,"This colorful, fun video for baby is the best I've seen so far.  Although the ""Mozart Effect"" (the theory that Mozart's mathematically composed pieces stimulate brain develpoment in babies)is disputed, I bought this anyway after watching a friend's baby reacting positively to it.
The music is perfect, nothing too boring or overwhelming for an infant, and the visuals have delighted my baby from 2 months of age to 17 months, which he is now.  During his immobile young months, I would prop him on a Boppy and watch him kick and smile at the fun images of toys, animals, and fruit he saw.  Nowadays, we watch together and I name the things onscreen while he dances around to the music.
TV haters stop reading now:  I must admit (and recommend heartily) that some days I would play this video when I needed a few minutes to pay some bills or wash dishes/fold laundry.  It gave me a break and I knew he was watching something that delighted him but was age-appropriate.
I recommend and often buy this video for new mothers for all of these reasons.  For a change of pace, Baby Bach is nice also, but there are 2 parts Brandon cried through because he found them boring.",1015891200,31,1168,4.564593301435407

This DVD might attract attention for a child around 6 months old, but so does something like Daniel Tiger, where characters talk like real people and there are actual storylines. This is just eye candy with weird music and psychedelic visuals. I can't see how a child would gain anything from this and I'm offended that this was highly rated.",1471651200,,600,4.714285714285714

1678114,5,B00005YUPN,My daughter loves this video. We have a few Baby Einstein videos but this one is by far her favorite. She started liking the videos at around 3 months and still loves them at 18 months. (and no I don't just sit her in front of the tv all the time but a video every once and a while won't hurt her and this one has great classical music) It had great music and colors. It is a little pricey in my opinion and I don't know that I would have this video if it hadn't been a gift. My rating is for the video itself though so 5 stars!,1441065600,,528,3.809090909090909

Whenever she needed a half-hour to get things done, she'd put this disc on TV, set her baby in front of it, and the baby would be mesmerized. All the bright colors, objects in motion, and beautiful music kept the tot totally occupied. I've since given copies of this disc to other young mothers and they've all had the same experience. Plus, there's a school of thought that ""Mozart makes you smarter,"" the theory being that classical music creates or improves synapses in the brain, especially in toddlers.

My older kids (8 yrs-14 yrs) all like to watch parts of it and say they remember watching it when they were little, and this or that part was their favorite!

To use them to their best advantage you should watch the video with the child and talk about the objects as they appear on the screen.

The only disappointment in this video is that it shows you images of fruits, animals, etc... but there are no words to read or a voice telling the child what it is that they are seeing.

I always sit through this less than 25 minute video with my baby and I point out and described these things so that she can not only enjoy watching, but actually learn something at the same time. And we get to bond a little too. Sometimes, she actually moves me out of the way! She just likes to [watch] sometimes too.",1326758400,,619,4.4298245614035086

1678180,4,B00005YUPN,"My son LOVES Baby Einstein!  But this dvd, I think because he's a bit older now, was not as entertaining to him as I thought it would be.  I should have reviewed the age recommendation a bit more before I purchased it because now that he is 10 mos. old I think that this one is a bit too young for him.  He will still watch it though and he loves any Baby Einstein dvd I put on for him (he has several), for the music primarily I think.

1678181,3,B00005YUPN,"The dvd basically consists of pictures and short video sequences of toys and stuffed animals moving across the screen. I can't help but think it would just be better for babies to be playing with real toys rather than watching toys being played with on tv.

The music may be mozart, but you wouldn't know it because its being played on what sounds like a cheap synthesizer as opposed to a true grand piano or a ""symphony.""  Our baby watches it, so it does keep her attention, but some of the other baby videos out there are better, have true symphonic classical music, and use language to interact with the baby which is important for babies to hear at 3 months.

This seems to be one of the most popular of the baby einstein videos, and other than distracting your baby for a half hour, I don't see the value here. The Baby Laureate/Little Laureate videos are better, particularly the fine art one which is my personal favorite although our baby girls loves and goes nuts with the Baby Laureate world travel video.",1311984000,2,1015,4.53551912568306
1678182,2,B00005YUPN,"I have been completely at a loss to why so many people gave this 5 stars.  The music isn't that great (very few real instruments), the ""video"" is just close-ups of toys (oh fun sweetie, look at all the toys you CAN'T play with!), and I'm still trying to figure out what the ""educational"" value of this dvd could possibly be.  I finally came to the conclusion that it's better than regular TV programs which can be downright damaging to children.  I gave this dvd 2 stars for that simple reason - it's not damaging.  However, I think if your baby seems to be (or you hope for her to be) even slightly smarter than the ""average"" child, you would be better off buying a decent Mozart CD and keeping the TV off.  Needless to say, my daughter had zero interest in this dvd (originally showed it to her at 6 months), and when I tried again at 9 months she stared at the TV for 3 minutes, tried to grab the ""toys"" they showed, then got bored and spent the next 10 minutes playing with the remote.  She finally succeeded in finding the ""stop"" button, then went on to play with her own toys.  I don't blame her.",1309824000,4,1102,4.244019138755981

It sounded like a great DVD to watch and have a little down time while still being educational but I have to say I am pretty disapppointed. The music had a mechanical sound to it and all it looks like a video I could have taped at home myself! All they did was tape toys and had a few very brief scenes with a hand puppet. My son is a pretty active little boy and he just seemed bored with this DVD. I think I will stick to my Mozart CD instead. Not worth the $14.99,1294444800,2,605,3.848

He really likes it and I appreciate its simplicity and music. However, the video is quite short and for the price, I feel it should be longer. If you can get this video for less than $10, go for it. However we paid over double that and the actual video portion is less than 30 minutes. I realize babies are obviously not intended to watch TV for long periods of time, but I would appreciate there being multiple episodes in one DVD or something along those lines being that the price is high. As another reviewer said, check out HBO's Classical Baby, we really like the Music Show. You get (3) 30-minute DVDs for the same price as this single one.",1288569600,2,779,4.379310344827586

I received several of these videos when my daughter was 7 months old (she's two now) and I agree with several of the other reviews that they are nothing but a series of commercialized toys in a very cheaply made setting with synthesized music.  What are babies going to learn from that?  They did nothing for my daughter.  I wrote a research paper on the topic of these videos and after examining several recently published studies as well as a good deal of other information pertaining to the topic, frankly, I agree that not only are babies just too young to process what they are seeing (especially in such a rapid secession) but that it can actually hinder their development in speech and attention span.

Do yourself a favor, buy a REAL Mozart CD, put it on and click on the Weather Channel.  The moving maps and quick graphics hold my son's attention, and show him the states and cities on top of that.

1678249,1,B00005YUPN,"The name ""Brainy Baby"" is a nice way to lull parents into feeling okay about their babies watching t.v. and videos, but according to the American Academy of Pediatrics babies should not be exposed to television at all before they're 2 years old! According to Time Magazine and the Boston Globe,

"".. researchers found that, among babies ages 8 months to 16 months, every hour spent daily watching programs such as 'Brainy Baby' or 'Baby Einstein' translated into six to eight fewer words in their vocabularies as compared with other children their age.""

Another study shows that brain wave activity in babies is actually slower when watching television than when *sleeping*, and yet another study shows that for every hour of television a baby watches a day, their chances of having an attention deficit disorder increases 10%. (I.e. 5 hours a day = 50% greater chance of ADHD). I like to take William Sears' advice that ""relationships, not things, make babies smarter"". The easiest way to make babies smarter? Carry them in a sling, because it is proven to make them much smarter since they are relating to you physically, emotionally, verbally, and visually.
For more information, you can google ""television and baby studies"", or see the Listmania list ""Natural Parenting for Baby's First Year"".",1200441600,5,1298,5.032558139534884
1678250,3,B00005YUPN,"If you're going to buy a children's video, by all means buy this video for your two year old and older child.  I highly recommend it compared to other kids' videos because it is engaging, fun, educational, not cartoon animated or fast-paced, and the puppets are really cute.

Having said that, I have a beef with the title ""Baby Einstein"" and marketing this to BABIES.  It seems to imply that watching these videos is good for babies, which they are NOT!  These videos may be great for older kids, but definitely NOT for babies' brains!

After some research I found out that: 1) brain wave activity in babies is slower when watching television than when sleeping. 2) for every hour of television a baby watches a day, their chances of acquiring an attention deficit disorder increases by 10%,  3) for every hour of television viewed daily at 4 yrs old, there is a significant odds increase for being a bully later on, and 4)consistent, heavy television viewing (more than 2 hrs daily) throughout early childhood can cause behavior, sleep and attention problems.

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends no television for children under 2, and no more than two hours of media (tv, videos, video games & computers) daily after age 2!  I think it's important for parents and caregivers to be aware of this so they can make better informed choices. I hope it encourages some people to limit television usage for babies and look for other outlets when possible.

For those looking to calm babies and build better brains, I recommend baby carriers because studies show that infants who are carried an extra 3 hours per day cry 40% less, and this effect is lasting over time!  Frequently held babies pick up verbal skills faster and develop better core muscle strength and balance.  Also, learning to communicate in sign language can reduce frustration and tantrums, accelerate language development and promote parent-child bonding in infants and toddlers.",1200355200,,1955,4.929878048780488

1678254,5,B00005YUPN,"Upon the recommendation of a friend who uses Sesame Street with her parrots with good results, I decided to look around for some ""learning"" type dvd's for toddlers. I decided I did not want to go with Sesame Street for a few reasons, first of all, I can't stand that annoying ""children's music"" and I sure as heck didn't want our sweet little African Grey boy picking up on any of that. ;) Also, I don't see the point in dvd's that feature a lot of humans for educating and entertaining parrots. Baby Einstein's Baby Mozart was a perfect choice that met all of our criteria: lack of humans (just a couple of hands and a short clip of a human baby at the end), beautiful classical music, brilliant colors and interesting objects.

Greys tend to be a bit neurotic, and my little boy has a bad habit of screaming and biting his nails whenever I have to leave the room if he is not allowed to shoulder constantly. Baby Einstein Mozart held his attention and entertained him very well starting the first night we used it! I'd say this is a very good product for reducing stress with a Grey.

Frequent repetition of this DVD is the key to getting, and holding the attention of a Grey, in our experience. I set it on repeat and let it loop over and over again and I suggest you do the same if you get this for your parrot. Remember, dvd's aren't babysitters, the parrot will learn best if you are actively involved in the dvd watching with him/her at least some of the time.

The best thing about this video, other than being really effective with our little parrot boy, is that it's not at all annoying for the parrot parents! Even looped over and over again, it will not drive you mad.",1189641600,2,1680,4.361022364217252

The ""choreography"" is spectacular; for instance, during the Turkish march, they show toy penguins (at least I think that's what they are) moving up and down one of those roller-coaster things.  No doubt that it's marketing for their toys, but it's enjoyable to watch it anyway, and probably helping to develop her sense of music.  When I put that same piece on for the baby (some recording other than the BE DVD) and I imitate the penguins, she laughs.  To be sure, the quality of BE DVDs varies from one to another, and just because you like one, doesn't mean you'll like all of them.  But if you buy only one of them, this is the one to get.

Notwithstanding the lack of correlation between exposure to baby videos and intelligence (as cited by some other reviewers), a search of the scientific literature does yield some studies published in recent years showing that exposing infants to specific musical styles influences their musical preference later on (for instance, see Cognition. 2000 Oct 16;77(1):B15-23).

Before actually having them, I thought I would be opposed to TV for my young kids, but I had no problems with Baby Mozart. Nothing but colorful images and soothing music.

My daughter asked for BMozart and BBach regularly until she was 3 years old. She still will occasionally ask for it when she plays with her dolls, thinking ""her baby's"" would love the video too!

I watched two of them: ""Baby Mozart"" and ""Baby Beethoven"". First of all, they are totally retarded.

Second, the quality of all this nonsense is as of an amateur home video. There are little animations between the parts of the movie - and even they look cheap, ugly, and unprofessional.

For me, its one of the few things that is relatively pleasant no matter how many times I have to hear it (as opposed to those irritating toys with all sorts of sounds and songs).",1164067200,,551,4.359223300970874

1678289,5,B00005YUPN,"I have bought several products by the Baby Einstein company, and my daughter (now 8 months) loves every single one! Especially the Baby Beethoven/Bach/Mozart DVDs are a hit. My only gripe about these DVDs is that you cannot skip the first chapters (warnings, advertising for Little Einsteins show, etc), but I've found that on my laptop I can skip through all of that, and it's even easier for my daughter to watch and focus on the screen than on our TV.",1157673600,4,454,4.617283950617284
1678290,5,B00005YUPN,"Baby Mozart: Music Festival is an award winning DVD that introduces your baby to the classical music of Mozart with visually stimulating real-world objects on screen. Lots of moving and engaging visuals, mostly toys in motion, are designed to be simple enough to get your baby's attention while complex enough to hold it for a while. If your baby likes Baby Bach or Baby Beethoven (and very few babies don't) she'll like Baby Mozart as well. This DVD is appropriate for introduction to baby right from birth but will still hold her attention many, many months later.

Most of the videos in the Baby Einstein series are designed as `video board books' for your baby and offer you the opportunity to interact with your child in the same way you do with books as well as act as a distraction for that deeply needed parental bathroom break. Most of the DVDs have the option to ""play"" or ""repeat play"" and are about 20-30 minutes in length -- the repetition being very stimulating and comforting to the younger set.

While I don't think viewing Baby Einstein DVDs will make my infant ""smarter"" she sure does enjoy them! They give me a great way to interact with her as well as a few minutes here and there to get a few things done around the house. Their ability to calm her when she's fussy is already legendary in our household.

Here is information on all the current 21 Baby Einstein DVDs including suggested times to introduce them to your little one. This information IS NOT available with the DVD sets but I gleaned it from several sources for my own use. You may like to print this out for future reference.

1678296,2,B00005YUPN,"When reading reviews on the Baby Einstein videos, you'll see both extremely happy customers, and horribly dissatisfied customers. You'll even get the ones who criticize you as a parent for putting your child in front of the television for more than 30 seconds (which is a whole other topic...). Anyway, the main thing is, not every single B.E. video is going to hold your child's interest. Like me, you'll have your favorites, as well as the ones you wished you wouldn't have wasted money on.

Personally, I felt this video was too young for my 18-month-old. She became bored almost immediately after watching the same toy repeatedly displayed for long-period stretches and lost interest completely, after 10 seconds worth of the dripping goo-type toy. This probably would have been a perfect movie for her when she was 6 months old, since it doesn't use many puppets and works at a sloooow pace. Now that's she older, and has a sense of humor, she likes to see the funny stuff, like the puppets in ""Baby MacDonald"", ""Neighborhood Animals"" & ""Riding, Sailing, Soaring"".

Bottom line - if your child is over 6 months, your best bet is to get one of the older-age B.E. videos.",1142553600,9,1174,4.778325123152709

I don't know what it is about it, but it leaves my 4 1/2 month old (I know, I know, but he really watches it!!)mesmerized. I was a little disapointed that the music is an electronic keyboard version instead of orchestral, but it is a small price to pay. Sometimes I find myself staring at the TV as well....We have Baby Neptune and Baby Monet also, but this one keeps his attention for the whole 30 minutes.

My baby was the time that loved to be held, and hated being away from people, but the first time we put her in the bouncer and put the dvd in, WOW.  She was mesmerized.  She watched the video through.

Even now at nearly 14 months, if the dvd player is turned on, she gets a big grin on her face, and that turns into a giggle when she sees the disney logo and baby einstein catapiller.

Great buy.

My baby is 4 months old and has been enjoying Baby Mozart for three months, and is now starting to recognize her favorite parts.  After I saw how big a hit this one was, I also bought Baby Bach, but all three of my girls have had the same reaction to that one.  They hated it.  I turn it on, and baby starts to fuss.  I turn it off, turn on Baby Mozart, and presto!  Baby's happy and dinner gets cooked.  In my opinion, this is the best of the Baby Einsteins.

Baby Mozart is downright boring. I think overall the Baby Einstein series is over-rated.  I could put on a better puppet show myself using the toys in my living room.  I think a lot of folks, including myself, were intrigued by the catchy ""Baby Einstein"" name, because we all want to raise little Einsteins. I'm sure the folks at Baby Einstein are laughing all the way to the bank!  I haven't seen some of the other titles like Van Gogh, Numbers Nursery, Shakespeare, etc., so I don't know if these are any better, but with all the money i'm out on Vol. 1, I won't be giving Baby Einstein another chance.

Compared to Baby Beethovan, Baby Mozart continously keeps his attention.  There are some parts of Baby Beethovan DVD that have pictures of animals and my son didn't like that.  He'd rather see the animals move than see a picture of them.  Hey, that's what books are for, right?  He also loves Baby Eistein Language for the same reasons.

1678338,5,B00005YUPN,"The Baby Einstein DVDs are a wonderful way to stimulate your baby with colors, music and motion. The Mozart DVD is the best of the lot, due to the inclusion of the green dragon (the funnest of the puppets) and the widest variety of activities shown.  My son strongly favors the Mozart DVD over both the Bach and the Beethoven (perhaps because both my husband and I prefer Mozart's music), but a more likely reason is that it is both visually and auditorally superior to the others.  Having more than one is nice for variety, but if you are limited to one, I would recommend this one highly.",1130544000,8,590,4.453703703703703

I wondered if it was just classical music; but we've ruled out Mozart, Beethoven, Chopin, and a variety of other boroque period composers...ONLY Bach works for him.

Now that he is 6 months and watched them so much, he has memorized when the end is. He will start fussing right before the credits come up! He just loves Baby Einstein and so do I.

Baby Mozart is the reason I arrive at work on time each day.  For about 30 minutes she watches that movie, loving every minute of it.  I highly recommend this.",1127692800,2,457,4.27906976744186

I am not stuck with only Baby Einstein, I am trying to collect all the videos for babies, from different brands like Brainy Baby, Baby Genius, Bee Smart Baby, and so many more, they are all very good.

Once he got more active, it really didn't hold his attention at all because there wasn't much going on.

One I believe showed squares changing colors. It seemed to take forever for them to go from one color to another. It was as if you were viewing them in slow motion.

What a joy for us as parents, to find something that calmed our newborn.

There is no live-action when it comes to the pictures of fruits, vegetables, animals, etc.  They are just still pictures/photos.  I just can't believe some of these Baby Einstein videos!  It seems like they just have an idea or two and try to fill up a half hour tape and make tons of money marketing this to parents who think they are doing their children something wonderful, helpful and educational by purchasing them.  And yet people will sing praises about it.  I just don't get it.  I have watched and reviewed 16 Baby Einstein videos and out of them all there are only 4 that I liked.  They are Baby Neptune (water), Baby Newton (shapes), Baby Galileo (sky) and Numbers Nursery (1 - 5).  The rest are such a waste of money and time, in my opinion.

Besides, they have also removed all the ""musical"" aspects of the actual music - no dynamics, no emotion.

This is a good distraction for him/keeps him still.  Outside of his treatments, I'm not comfortable with his watching the tape because I'd rather he learn to play with his toys himself or with me rather than watch some personless hands play with them on tv.  He really likes the tape (reaches for the images and ""talks"" to the tv).  I don't see how this program helps his development. It does help me give him his medicine, however.  I can see the temptation for an at home parent who is trying to get work done to use this because it is so mesmerizing.

When in desperate need of a 30 minute babysitter, the vidoes generally do the trick - at least until your baby turns around 1. After that, they need a bit more to occupy them. It was always upsetting to me to see so many titles with ""Einstein"", ""Genius"", or ""Smart"" in the titles, when really the videos are just random images that hypnotize babies. Even the music is synthesized which hardly counts as utilizing the Mozart Effect (which really should use real instruments/orchestras).

1678399,5,B00005YUPN,"So I bought into the baby einstein hype, I bought her the play mat, some toys but had never got a dvd. Frankly I was against the idea of putting my baby infront of the tv until she could at least sit on her own.

Well that happened so I decided to get her a DVD. I bought this one but I am SO happy I did not pay this much for it.

First off I have to say my daughter likes it. Why she does, I cant understand. Its a low production quality DVD with the most cheap looking ""puppets"" you can imagine. I really couldn't believe that this is what everyone had been so excited over. These are toys set to classical music. The music isn't even real instruments its synthesized and cheap sounding.

I had been playing her classical music since I was pregnant and I love it myself. But this is so cheap sounding.

Anyway it really doesnt matter what I think, its not for me. She likes it and is completely enthralled.

We also have bach, neighborhood animals, world animals and van gogh. The van gogh is BY FAR THE BEST out of those I have listed.

But if you would rather not spend this much on it Ill tell you a secret. You can get it at an online auction website for a package of 10-15 brand new for 35.00. Dont spend the money here its too much for what your getting. Gotoebay and get it there.",1095033600,18,1290,4.07905138339921

Did you ever go into a gift shop and see those little gadgets with a  dolphin on one end and a weight on the other and when you tap it ot swings back and forth? Mixing this with the sound of Mozart is a clever idea to stimulate children. So go out and purchase the gadget for your child to view up close and personal and see the mechanics and want to touch and explore it on their own, not spend $17 on a DVD for your child to see it on TV. Toys spinning around and mechanics swirling to the sound of Mozart is something you can set up in your own home and video tape yourself. You may find you can get a bit more creative than what is on this video. I understand parents feeling guilty placing their child infront of a TV for a half an hour, we all want to actually enjoy a cup of coffee and flip through a magazine once in a while, but may I suggest if you don't already have cable, purchase a video like Noggin's Miffy. This is a colorful, slow paced, half hour show with pleasant dialouge and songs for children to sing along with.

1678407,5,B00005YUPN,"We have this video of thr Baby Einstein series, along with Baby Van Gogh and Baby Neptune, and every single time, no matter how cranky our 5 month-old is, Baby Mozart will calm him down and get a smile out of him (and he can be very cranky at times!) If you watch it with an adult mindset, you will find it to be a bunch of nonsense: it seems a bit chaotic, no dialogs, etc. But for babies, it works magic: it's as if it was made in their language, and in a sense it was, since it employs color, lights, movement and most important of all, music. Mozart's music accompanies each and every moment of this video, reinforcing once more why this composer's works (here arranged to be more baby-like, with chimes and similar sounds employed to play it) is just marvelous music for kids.
Whether it develops the baby's intelligence or not, I won't argue about, because I can't give an informed opinion about it. But one thing I can say, and it is that Baby Mozart, along with Teletubbies and a handful of other videos will become a favorite of your baby past the second month. I was recommended to get a copy by a friend, and now I pass the advice on to new parents.",1079222400,7,1160,4.277272727272727
1678408,5,B00005YUPN,"I am now a believer. I started with Baby Einstein and later bought the first four in a boxed set (the extra copy was drafted as a gift to my cousin who is expecting in August '04). I was very impressed with both the premise of introducing visual and audio stimuli to baby minds, as well as the result. Although I'm not a child psychologist, but as a new dad I did more studying before my daughter's birth than in all four years of college put together, so here's my conclusions and observations.
Our daughter gets very excited when Baby Bach or Einstein comes on. She actually knows the opening music when it plays, and immediately props herself up now for it. She is then nearly entranced by the program. We also attempted to introduce primarily classical music to her in vitro as well.
To all of us who are new or expecting parents this is a super helpful tool. I believe it may indeed help in the early development of the creative, memory, recognition and cognitive functions of our 'minime' kids.
Also, our free time evaporates and energy reserves get sapped early on. Life is easier, and rewarding, to sit with my daughter propped up in her boppy and talk to her while baby Einstein is playing. It's relaxing and I have watched each DVD that she watches, several times in advance to make sure it was appropriate.
In closing, advice is free, but I wanted to share our experience with others. I think the Baby Einstein series is a great tool to enhance our babie's learning while also giving us some time to recharge.
In addition to the Einstein series I stuck with Lamaze toys early that were in primary colors and the recommended black, red and white for newborns. She's still snuggling with several of them.

Pointing out ""banana, dog, cat, star...."" when those things are shown really gives you, the parent, a chance to help teach your child basic ""first knowledge"" elements.
The Language Lab portion of the DVD is AMAZING!  The fact that you have so many different languages to choose from is really awesome!  Even my 11 yo. step daughter, who wants to learn japanese, can sit down and learn the Japanese words for ""Dog, Cat....""

She was actually interested in looking at it.  Of course, you have to put her pretty close to the screen, but she finds it neat.

At her age, some parts are more interesting than others.  Doesn't care at all about the parts with puppets, but stares at the ones with fast moving, brightly colored things.

It is actually a little freaky.  You almost wonder if there's some sort of subliminal brainwashing going on where Disney is really telling them to demand visits to the theme parks in the future.  Ha.

Still....our daughter could watch it from a week old and found it interesting.

Kids are just about as interested in a football game with all the colored jerseys running around, not to mention anything on the Disney channel.  Or, just point them at the TV and flip the channels.

If my son is being fussy or a little too rambunctious I can put this video on and he will immediately be calmed down.  It's also good if you need to have your kids out from under your feet to do a small chore such as mopping the floor.
I agree with another reviewer that Baby Bach is just not as good as Baby Mozart.  Baby Bach doesn't nearly hold his attention the way Baby Mozart does.  However, my son does love Baby Shakespeare!  He will easily sit and watch that one all the way through and there are some moments that always make him laugh.
If you are a new or expectant Mom, do yourself a favor and buy Baby Mozart and Baby Shakespeare, you WILL NOT REGRET IT!!!",1063670400,2,968,4.063157894736842

 held for a moment and then going on to the next image.....but THATS what babies can focus on! The images move slow enough and I saw my baby start to track the moving images! T.V. shows are way too fast for any baby to contrate on what they are seeing, so they definately capture their world!
 He's 6 months now, and he'll smile at his favorite puppets and give me a lil' time to relax. I agree with the other Reviewer, because he can be terribly fussy with his teething, and the images calm him down in a snap!

We've tried others in the Baby Einstein line, and have come to the conclusion that Baby Mozart is the best of the lot.  The other videos tend to cut back and forth more, which doesn't hold the kids' interest as much.  As soon as the children hear the intro to Baby Mozart, they settle down and watch, talk about their favorite toy shown, and giggle at the puppet that sticks his tongue out.  What a lifesaver....I know I wouldn't be able to keep my sanity without this video.  Kudos for Baby Mozart!",1062633600,2,742,4.257142857142857
1678456,4,B00005YUPN,"There are several parts to this DVD -- a musical theatre, concert series and language lab. We have only used the musical theatre because my son is only 3 months old and the other parts are not as useful yet (we have lots of just plain music for him, too).
He enjoys watching the cute toys and figures moving and listening to the music in the musical theatre section. I won't say he just swoons over it, but he pays attention and is quite for the 25 minute ""show"". I have to pick the right time to use this. Sometimes we watch together and I describe the toys to him. Other times I just let him watch and take a break. Either way, its a nice change of pace. He watches it one way or another about 3-5 times per week.
The language lab is a little slow paced for a baby who cannot possibly understand that he is even learning words. He doesn't even know what a dog is in English, much less 8+ other languages. I look forward to using it later, though, to expose him to the sounds of other languages. Maybe when he is 6 or 9 months...",1061942400,5,1030,4.103960396039604

For some reason there are quiet intervals where a hand puppet, such as a snake, appears, while occasional sound effects are made.  Then suddenly the snake will stick out his tongue and there will be a loud ""Blah"" sound.  At first my daughter only jumped when this happened, but now she starts crying.  This also happens when the background again goes black and suddenly a spider puppet drops into view, accompanied by another sudden noise.  She now views the DVD with a mixture of joy and terror.  We rarely watch it and when we do I have to block the TV during certain segments or at least sit next to her to calm her down when she starts crying.

She's drawn mostly to the magic hand inserting balls that tumble down the toy castle and stacking multi-color rings.  She wants me to play these sections over and over again. The rest is superfluous.
I see it as a highly commercial production, using readily available products, with Mozart reduced to toy piano melodies.  I didn't know that ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"" was based on Mozart?  But, I suppose if you don't have time to play with your child this DVD may serve as a babysitter.  However, if your child is like mine, she makes you sit and watch it with her, over and over again.

Often, I'd get a load of laundry folded while my son watched the video.
Baby Mozart is definitely the best out of the Einstein company.  My son particularly loves puppets, and this one has lots of them.  Baby Mozart was definitely worth the money in my opinion.",1052352000,,657,4.300813008130081

1678480,5,B00005YUPN,"Friends gave us the BABY MOZART video (made 1998) as a gift for our infant when he was 4 months old. He loved it then and he loves it now. It completely holds his attention for the 28 minutes or so it runs. Our little guy has watched it dozens of times over the last two months. It takes Mozart's music and presents it in very child-friendly renditions with simple visuals of toys and puppets. The pacing and length are exactly right.
We have played BABY MOZART about 3 times a week for the last 2 months and our little guy enjoys it every time. He smiles and giggles at his favorite parts. Believe it or not, the only time he loses interest is when the credits and ads come on at the end ! We can almost guarantee ourselves almost a half hour of getting chores done around the house as the program runs. (Buy it on DVD because you will eventually wear out the tape.)

Based on the Mozart program, we soon bought BABY BACH (made 2000) and BABY BEETHOVEN (made 2002) on DVD. Save your money. BABY BACH is a total bust. He lasts about 7 minutes at best. He never liked it. I don't like it. Stupid still shots of toy instruments just sitting there and gratuitous shots of kids lend nothing.
BABY BEETHOVEN is a fair program and our little guy will sometimes sit through about 15 minutes of it but it pales in comparison to BABY MOZART. The Beethoven video includes even more pointless shots of children and lots of [pricey] toys and mobiles which it promotes at the end.
The music on BEETHOVEN and BACH is certainly as good as the Mozart video but for our baby and for us, the overall presentations just don't cut it.
BABY MOZART however is a wonderful program and should be in almost every child's video library. With Mozart, they did catch magic in a bottle. Too bad they weren't able to repeat it with the later efforts.",1049155200,138,1820,4.3372434017595305

My son loves them!  What do I love best... I can put the DVD on continuous play.  Then I can listen to the music with my back to the TV while we interact.  I can jump up and do something for a sec and he is fine, better than fine.  I have not waited for the age groups to play the different ones, I just rotate them.  My daugher watches and so does he.  some may say that ""Einstein"" isn't as good, but I disagree.

I came downstairs to drink some coffee and chat with the parents.  I heard the music, and I watched the camera showing a grown up providing visual stimulus by playing with baby toys and puppets.  I thought it was really dumb, then after a few minutes I found my attention getting absorbed by the video.  My wife still laughs when she sees the video.
Now that we have a two month old, I've found this a great parenting tool.  The baby sits in her bouncy chair and stares at the TV non-stop for 20 mins.  She laughs and coos at the shapes and seems to dance with the music.  This video gives parents a 20 min window to take a nap.

1678485,5,B00005YUPN,"My almost 5 month old son is a very demanding baby - he constantly craves attention, even if you simply turn your head!  I had read reviews on this and decided to get this as a Christmas present for him (when he was 3 months old).  At first he wasn't too thrilled by it, but now this is like a daily treat for him!  He can sit and watch it over and over if I'd let him - I usually let it play once and see if he's still interested enough to watch it again.  I've seen it so often I know exactly what's showing when a different song comes on.  It has really helped his visual skills and it keeps him highly focused - hard to do with a squirming 4 month old that wants you to hold him all day!  I really like the music; the graphics are terribly boring for an adult, unless you just need time to zone out and relax for a while.  My husband is a musician and blasts rock n roll all evening long so the nice compositions are a good switch for my son.  I wish I had thought of this idea, I'd be rich!
My husband also bought the Language Nursery and I'm not fond of it; neither is my son.  He usually gets bored very quickly and I don't like the fact that they don't give you the words in English when they're saying something in another language.

1678490,4,B00005YUPN,"My son just turned one and we got him the Baby Mozart DVD.  He enjoys most of it, but I have to caution those with very sensitive babies.  My son freaked at a couple of the scenes the first time he watched it: the dragon handpuppet that looks into the camera and suddenly says ""Blah!""; the spider that drops suddenly from the top of the screen; and the rooster that clucks with sudden jerky head movements.  All of these have made my son very apprehensive, and he runs away any time ANY of the puppets come into view, even if I hold and reassure him.  Even though I skip over the scary parts, my son still remembers when the dragon, spider and rooster puppets are about to come on screen and he starts to become very upset until we are past those parts of the program.  Don't let that keep you from buying this, however.  If you've got a sensitive baby, watch the DVD yourself ahead of time to know which parts to skip over (which is what I do now).  I would give this 5 stars if not for the fact that my son gets scared in certain places.  Overall, I think this is a great DVD, and most babies probably won't have any problems with it.  The Mozart music is nice.  The flashcards in the various languages are great.  The DVD menu is a bit difficult to navigate without a 'back' option.

I think the best two in this series is the animal ones: Neighborhood and World Animals, but this one is very good as well.
In this video there are toys in motion to Mozart music. The toys are stuffed animals, trains, action toys like pound-a-ball and a silly sequence of pictures of fruit to Twinkle Twinkle Little Star (I wonder why they chose fruit?) The motion of the toys fits very well to the music, which is superb. I am surprised my daughter will sit the entire 25 minutes to this tape.
