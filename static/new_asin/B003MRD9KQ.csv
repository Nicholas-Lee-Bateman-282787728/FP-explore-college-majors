4155483,1,B003MRD9KQ,"Did any of you actually see the DVD?????? Unfortunately I did. The cover lists 520 minutes, but there are only a little over 400 min on the DVD set. My set came with 2 DVD,s - 7 chapters at about 50 minutes each (the last chapter is actually double the time). I remember seeing the show when it originally aired. There are whole sections missing. Maybe one day they will release the entire miniseries - but till then I'd wait to but it if I were you.",1283299200,73,450,4.183908045977011
4155484,3,B003MRD9KQ,"I read the book when it was first published (and a couple times since); and saw this series back in (was really that long ago?) 1976. Terribly disappointed in the latter because, even at a really long 7+ hours, it left out so much of the book.  I understand, from reading a couple other reviews, that the book is required reading at West Point and with the Marines.  Will the TV version now become required viewing in place of the book?  I sure hope not (although Sam Elliott is an ideal Sam Damon).",1281052800,,499,4.344086021505376

4155486,4,B003MRD9KQ,"This DVD is very special to me. I have eagerly awaited its coming for over 30 years, ever since ""Once an Eagle"" premiered on broadcast TV on NBC as a minseries in 1976-77.  Tom Hebert, the man who made it possible for a new generation of Americans to experience ""Once an Eagle"" for the first time, deserves a special thanks from all patriotic Americans.  The DVD transfer is excellent, although I am saddened at the complete lack of ""extras"" for such a seminal minseries. The editing is also a bit choppy.  Aside from these two ""nit-picks,"" I can heartily recommend ""Once an Eagle"" to all Americans who believe that patriotism, duty, and honor must NEVER go out of style.",1279497600,7,671,4.621848739495798
4155487,5,B003MRD9KQ,"I have been waiting for this for a long time.  Just an outstanding novel.

I understand this has been required reading at west Point for some time.  Reminds me
a bit of Wouk's Winds of War series in that it is partly historical with a great fictional
thread woven within.

Still pertinent as there are officers and then there are OFFICERS.  I saw it in my hitch as an Army
enlisted man as I'm sure others have.  Sam Elliot was great.

An officer like this in real life was Col Hackworth, who always told it like it was, imo.
Take that Rumsfeld.",1277078400,8,544,4.2745098039215685
4155488,5,B003MRD9KQ,I've been waiting for this mini-series to appear on DVD for over ten years! The book is fascinating! This production translated very well to film! The producers and director took their time to get everything right! I highly recommend everyone who wants to see the growth of a soldier to watch this film. The book is required reading in the USMC. Order this DVD! You won't be sorry! Sam Elliot was perfect for this role!,1276992000,9,419,4.6
4155489,5,B003MRD9KQ,"I saw this on television when it first came out and as a soldier, I loved it.  A few years ago I bought a bootleg copy of this and the quality was horrible but the story was great.  Sam Elliott is great and I love his character!  Glenn Ford, etc. I even wrote to NBC asking them to put this out on DVD - I am happy they got a bunch of letters.  I'll be giving this to some friends for  Christmas.  The ending is one of my all-time media favorites.",1276819200,10,447,3.857142857142857
4155490,5,B003MRD9KQ,"I have been waiting for years/decades for this mini-series to be released on home video.  For those who don't remember, in the aftermath of the success of ""Roots"" for a brief period networks put a lot of money into producing miniseries programing.  It was going to be the next big thing to save the networks (kind of like reality shows today).
As a result, this adaption of ""Once An Eagle"" is top-notch.  The production values are outstanding and, to use a cliche, it features an all-star cast.  Sure, the story of the two officers (once admirable, one despicable) is a little black and white, but it's still a whale of a story.  The WWI and WWII periods are really entertaining, even if the story may drag a little in the middle.  [Note to purists:  the story ends in World War II, while the book continues on to the verge of the Viet Nam War, but it's much more dramatic this way.]
I can't believe that over seven hours of great entertainment is priced so reasonably, much less than a lot of mediocre 90 minute movies.  This item is a great value.  I've already ordered two and will probably be buying many more as gifts.",1274572800,239,1123,4.465686274509804
4155491,5,B003MRD9KQ,"As the previous reviewer mentioned, I have not seen the new release, but can only imagine finally seeing this story with great quality.  It really is a great American story.  I remember seeing it when it was originally airing on TV.  I always remembered parts of it but not the whole thing.  I finally found a copy of it and enjoyed watching it once more.  I can't wait to see what they do with the DVD version.",1274313600,25,411,4.285714285714286
4155492,5,B003MRD9KQ,"I have not seen the new DVD release but I own the VHS tape version and I'm sure they are similar....with better quality on the DVD.
This is one of the very best military dramas to be shown on TV. It is based on the novel of the same name by Anton Myrer. The book is required reading in the military schools because through the two main characters the reader/viewer learns the difference in leadership style and what it takes to be a true leader of men.
The story traces the careers of 2 men from WW1 thru WW2. One is a martinet while the other is a leader. Action sequences are scattered throughout the movie but it is mainly the story of these two men and those surrounding them. It is also about the military ""system"" and the sacrifices soldiers...and their families... make to serve their country
I highly recommend both the book and the movie and look forward to the new DVD release. Anyone remotely interested in the military will enjoy both book and movie. It is NOT a ""blood & guts"" story but one of heroism and sacrifice.",1274227200,92,1029,4.392670157068062

(I bought it thinking I would offer the DVD and the book to a young cousin who will soon be commissioned in the Army).  I had forgotten that the mini-series ended after WWII, whereas the book continued Sam Damon's service until Vietnam.  Regardless, it's an excellent vehicle for reinforcing the principles of Sam's selfless leadership vs Courtenay Massengale's self-serving, self-promoting ambition.  The DVD arrived quickly and in excellent condition.",1470096000,2,577,5.239130434782608
4155525,3,B003MRD9KQ,"I recently re-read Anton Myrers magnificent novel Once an Eagle, which I reviewed here at Amazon.com many years ago. But I had never seen the television miniseries thats based upon the book until now. This miniseries, which stars (among others) Sam Elliott, Darleen Carr, Cliff Potts, and Glenn Ford,  was first broadcast on NBC in 1979. (This was an era when multi-episode miniseries were very popular with viewers.)

I purchased the Once an Eagle miniseries on DVD, and found it disappointing on many levels. The acting is generally stilted and overly melodramatic  sometimes cartoonishly so. The carefully crafted plot of Anton Myrers beautifully written book is frequently twisted in such a way that it muddles much of Myrers anti-war message. Worst of all, the miniseries seriously dilutes the main theme of Myrers novel. The Sam Damon-Courtney Massengale relationship is portrayed as less of a contrast between Damons good leadership qualities and Massengales bad ones, and more of an ordinary clash between two bitter enemies.

I suppose many of the flaws in the Once an Eagle miniseries were inevitable, considering the TV networks need for commercial success at the expense of artistic integrity. But it truly is a shame that Anton Myrers literary masterpiece fell victim to screenwriters, producers, directors, and actors who may not have necessarily been interested in faithfully translating Myrers story or his message to television audiences.

Once an Eagle is strictly pedestrian entertainment, worth watching once. (2  Stars ^ 3)",1467417600,8,1544,5.333333333333333

But Sam Damon plays by the rules, so his rise is not steadly..it stagnates at times, while that of Courtney Massengale, far less admirable as a human being, takes short cuts, stays just ahead of him.

4155567,5,B003MRD9KQ,"Anton Myrer's book, ONCE AN EAGLE, is one of the all-time great military novels, charting the career of a professional soldier, from enlistment as a private just in time to participate in the Pancho Villa Expedition, through service in WW1 where his is awarded a Congressional Medal of Honor, and receives a battlefield promotion from sergeant to commissioned lieutenant.  It continues to follow him through the bleak years between the wars, through service in the Pacific as a general officer during WW2, finally culminating in Southeast Asia, where America's involvement in Vietnam (fictionalized into ""Khotiane"") is just beginning.  Through it all, Sam Damon epitomizes what every soldier should be, honorable, brave, compassionate, fierce in battle, but magnanimous in peace, a leader who LEADS his men by example, rather than pushing them from behind.  His conduct is contrasted with another officer, West Pointer Courtney Massengale, a political officer, making his career in staff positions rather than in combat, who back-stabs, manipulates, and cons his way to the top.

This film adaptation, first run as a serial on NBC's BEST SELLERS series, is not as good as the novel, but it is very,very good.  Sam Elliott, as Damon, gives one of his very best performances.  The rest of the cast, particularly Cliff Potts, as the charming but treacherous Massengale, Darlene Carr as Sam's wife Tommie, and Glenn Ford as Tommie's dad, a veteran officer who becomes Sam's mentor in the Army, is also good.

The film cuts large parts of the novel, ending in WW2 and never progressing to Southeast Asia.  Also, the action in which Sam earns his battlefield commission does NOT earn him a Medal of Honor (a mistake I think).

But it is faithful to the spirit, if not always to the absolute letter, of Myrer's novel, and should be seen by anyone who admires that book as I do.

Highly recommended!",1430265600,,1891,5.012779552715655

4155582,1,B003MRD9KQ,"Those who have a low opinion of this work were probably influenced by the much better novel. As others have noted, ""Once an Eagle"" influenced a whole generation of professional soldiers, we hope for the better.

It's helpful to understand that this adaptation came during the huge and costly network romance with the dramatic miniseries, a Seventies fad; and there is no fad like a Seventies fad (I was there). There was a conscious desire to emulate contemporary big-budget soap operas like ""Dallas"", a genre that doesn't fit a serious novel.

I found the adaptation annoying for several reasons, but two are critical.

First, the writers insisted on inserting scenes that were unrelated to the novel and served no dramatic purpose (the opening scene when Sam, newly enlisted, celebrates by getting laid in the barn. Sounds like fun, but it was time wasted where storytelling is concerned). There was also the bizarre equestrian scene, which was also invented and simply informed us that Sam Damon, infantryman or not, could by God ride a horse.  We never saw another horse in the film.

Second, the writers seem to have decided that the most important parts of Sam's career and character were unimportant. We were never informed that he won the Medal of Honor.  We knew nothing of his friendship with Ben Krisler, who was a bit player in the miniseries. Finally, the climactic meeting with Courtney Massengale was entirely distorted; imagine the party scene in ""The Caine Mutiny"" if Greenwald suddenly gave Tom Keefer a hug and asked him to autograph his book . . .

In short, the writers hammered an important novel full of contradictions and nuance into a slick soap opera because the soap opera was ""what's happening.""

I watched the original in the conference room of the Department of Behavioral Sciences and Leadership at West Point. We weren't allowed to bring food into the room, which saved the screen from being bombarded with popcorn.",1420243200,4,1947,4.9327217125382266

It's a fascinating story that I watched as one of the first mini-series to make it to the small screen.

4155618,5,B003MRD9KQ,"I watched ""Once an Eagle"" when it ran as a miniseries on TV. I read the book after I saw the miniseries and for once I applauded the scriptwriters for throwing out all kinds of stuff that went nowhere from the novel, adding a character who should have been in the original and deleting one who made no sense, and ending the story right where it should have ended, instead of dribbling away to nothing like the book did. I was eager to watch the series again to see if my initial impression had been correct.

It took many years for the series to be released on DVD. Was it worth waiting for? I'd say yes. Now, I have to admit that a lot of the acting is pretty sad, and the series was definitely a product of its times (the 1970s). However, it's still a great story and the stars who can act make up for a lot of line-reading and scenery-chewing by the rest. Just use your remote control to skip past the TV show intro on each episode. You only need to see it once.",1395532800,,965,4.132978723404255

It doesn't get too 'soapy' and tells a story that will keep you interested.  On hand are veteran Glenn Ford and newcomers Amy Irving and Cliff Potts.  Potts was slated for stardom, but that didn't work out.

I'm not sure that it was worth the wait. While it's an okay story overall, I had forgotten that it is a bit choppy in how the story is presented. Also, unless the viewer has some understanding of the military, some of the issues presented in the movie can be pretty abstract. There isn't necessarily context to explain what is going on to the viewer. That could make the story tough to follow for some viewers.

In terms of the attention to detail, there were a number of minor glitches that should have been caught. I was surprised that while there was an Army Colonel as an adviser, there were so many errors of a military nature. Either his advice was ignored, or they were very careless in the production. While these were really minor distractions, they gave the appearance of a slipshod effort. There were also comments by other reviewers about the lack of aging on the part of the actors, and other issues such as that. Agreed.

So, in the final analysis, it's not a bad story--not great, but okay. It can be choppy, and I think it was carelessly put together. It's probably worth watching if you've never seen it before.",1361318400,2,1383,4.458498023715415

There were some M1 Carbines with bayonet lugs (carbines never had them) and several other obvious mistakes if you are looking. I didn't like the feel of the entire movie and was expecting more. The whole deal gives the feeling of very low budget. The acting was mediocre as was the entire production.

4155658,5,B003MRD9KQ,"I cannot say enough good things about this DVD set.

It tells the story of two young men who come to age as officers in WW II.

They start their commissioning process as West Point cadets, but that is where the similarities end.

Our star is a kind, thoughtful officer who does what he must, but does everything that he can to take care of his soldiers.

The other is a self-serving, conniving wretch that does everything he can to promote himself.

There are some unexpected twists and turns, and I do not want to give anything away.

The families of some of the officers are brought into the story in unexpected and helpful ways.

As a career military person, this is one of the better depictions of the dynamics of personality in the services.

Well done!

Really, this series is a timeless classic.

In service,

I will not go into an in-depth review as so many other viewers did a superb job of reviewing with raves and constructive comments.  We enjoyed Once an Eagle very much and will most assuredly see it again and again.  We are glad to add this movie with an almost unending list of main actors, supporting actors, and guest actors all giving exceptional performances to our collection.

That would normally be alright for those of use with hearing problems because we can wear headphones and turn up the volume.  In this case that doesn't work.  The music, war sounds and ambient sounds in the film are so loud that they drown out 85 - 90% of the speaking.  I was unable to hear little more than 4 to 5 scenes.  I had to guess what was happening.  I am extremely frustrated and angry.  I wasted both my time and money on this mini-series.

The mini-series obviously misses the depth and central messages of the book.  Some of the obvious event and character changes from the book work out okay.  I was disappointed early on in the movie on the differences from the book, but it got better as it progressed.  Overall entertaining and a good value.

The copy I received from Amazon was probably better than the original mini-series in quality although it certainly doesn't meet the standards of the digital and HD videos of more recently produced programs.

4155671,3,B003MRD9KQ,"I purchased the Blu-ray version of ""Once An Eagle"" because it was on sale and I am a Sam Elliot fan.  When I viewed the mini-series I almost stopped after the first ten minutes due to the distractions caused by the scratches and light flickers in the film.  Either the Timeless Media Group--who released the Blu-ray and DVD versions--did not bother to look for or could not find a quality film stock for transfer; while I have not viewed the DVD format, I would guess that it is little better.  As for the clarity, sharpness, and color enhancement usually found in Blu-ray discs, ""Once An Eagle"" hardly seems to be of the quality I would expect; then again, this is a very old TV film and therefore not really suitable for transferring to Blu-ray format.

The ""Blu-ray Features"" are limited to ""Interactive Menus"" and ""Chapter Selections,"" which one would expect on any DVD or Blu-ray disc.  There are NO bonus features and no playback options.  As would be expected, all seven ""chapters"" of the mini-series are on one disc (rather than two discs found with the DVD format).  As for the question of story continuity reported in reviews of the DVD, I did not notice any problems with the Blu-ray--the story flowed very well and nothing seemed out of order.  While I have not bothered to time the end credits, which are scrolled after the seventh ""Chapter"" only, I am going to assume that the lack of full end credits after each ""Chapter"" accounts for the discrepency between the complete running time listed at various web sites as 540 minutes and the listed playback time for the Blu-ray/DVD as 520 minutes.

Having never seen the mini-series on TV, I purchased this film with no expectations other than it was a Sam Elliot movie; nor have I read the book.  As such, I found ""Once An Eagle"" to be a good movie that both entertained and engrossed me, while the acting was of the quality typical for ""high end"" made for television movies.  The movie reminded me of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wings-of-Eagles/dp/B000F0UUJQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wings of Eagles</a>&nbsp;with John Wayne; albeit, the later is about the Army/Navy Air Corps and ""Once An Eagle"" is about the US Army Infantry.

I recommend looking up the show on Wikipedia for more information about the content of the movie and for critical reactions to it.  Overall, I found the movie to be fairly enjoyable, but greatly diminished by the VERY poor quality of the film transfer--and question the validity of this product really qualifying as a Blu-ray version of the mini-series.",1318896000,9,2601,4.979214780600462

4155678,5,B003MRD9KQ,"For those who appreciate the classic 1970s mini-series genre, this is a treasure. It is typically melodramatic, with acting that fortunately improves as the story unfolds. Chopped for TV commercials and arranged to run over several weeks, you'll see the title credits frequently and have to sit through them as there is no way to fast-forward without missing part of the story. But for me, this was a wonderful viewing experience. I first saw the mini-series back in the 1970s when I was a child.  The series led me to the book, and it would not be inaccurate to say the that the book inspired me to join the Army. After three wars and a career as a soldier, I still find Anton Meyrer's story relevant, his characters realistic, and his telling compelling. Those who criticize the story as  somehow anti-military have clearly never spent time in a wartime army. I have. This is a study in leadership styles, an epic story, well portrayed by Sam Elliot and respectfully related by the screen writer that adapted the book to the screen. If you love the military, you will revel in the story. It is a soldier's story; nothing more and nothing less.

4155683,1,B003MRD9KQ,"Sorry, this is a long review. I apologize but can't keep quiet about this.
I read the novel three times at different stages of my professional military career, beginning as a late-stage adolescent and ending during a period when I was dragging my 50-ish self around the hot deserts in the Middle East during the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq.
The novel ""Once an Eagle"" by Anton Myrer was an irreplaceable reference in our leadership training at West Point. When this miniseries ran in the United States in the 1970s, I was stationed overseas where the program was unavailable. At the beginning of each of my four command tours throughout a thirty-year military career, I required my officers to read ""Once an Eagle."" I also strongly recommended they view the movies ""A Man for All Seasons"" and ""The Caine Mutiny."" The purpose of this homework was to present what I considered to be basic, foundational concepts of leadership, honor and teamwork.
The novel ""Once an Eagle"" is a wonderful work, considered by many as our nation's ""War and Peace."" In my opinion, the miniseries ""Once an Eagle,"" regardless of its wonderful cast, is an amateurish attempt at creating a soap opera from an epic lesson in leadership and honor. The screenplay mirrors a mediocre high school play and much of the acting is at the same level. It appears that someone saw ""Roots"" and thought they discovered a magical equation for making a fortune in the miniseries business, quality aside.
The true message of ""Once an Eagle,"" positive leadership, duty, and honor, would make a wonderful screenplay if only it were understood and presented in context. Great novels are great because readers understand the messages. Great novels become great movies when screenplays connect with the novels' readers and exhibit understanding of the key themes. Think about ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" or ""Lonesome Dove."" These screenplays grasped the themes of the novels and were absolutely true to the messages. Both were incredible.  The miniseries ""Once an Eagle"" was not.
The essence of the true message in the miniseries ""Once an Eagle"" is masked and replaced by a weak attempt to place this story in the same category as a low-budget soap opera. If you are a fan of today's soap operas, you may want to buy this DVD for its prurient, sophomoric qualities. I you want to understand the pain and joy of leadership, read the book.
General SBB, I hope you agree.",1301184000,80,2422,4.878640776699029

It does cover lives of two career army men and their families, but I just could not get into the characters.  I have been a Sam Elliot fan for years, but this was not something he was allowed to shine in.  Over the course of time, the men aged, a little bit, the women didn't.

And of the eight episodes, only two have any semblance of military in them.  The rest are all silly, cheesy, soap opera.  I only liked the first episode.  I hated all of the rest.

4155696,5,B003MRD9KQ,"This DVD contains the full miniseries as it originally aired. For those in doubt, you can check the Internet Movie Data Base ([...]). Here's the link to the full episode list, if this system allows it to post through:

[...]

As you can see, there were seven episodes, not 8 as some have misremembered, the first airing on 2 December 1976 and the last on 13 January 1977.

All seven episodes are present and accounted for, sir!

Episodes 1 and 7 were two hour episodes, the rest being an hour each. That was a total of 540 minutes of air time, INCLUDING THE COMMERCIALS. Take the commercials out and you're down to 400-some-odd minutes... exactly what's on this disc set.

I found the quality to be as good as possible considering the source material: a TV miniseries in the days before Hi Def. I also just watched ""Rich Man, Poor Man"", from the same era, and the quality was exactly the same.

My discs functioned flawlessly. The interactive menu works just fine.

Now, for those who have read the book -- as I have -- this miniseries never did contain the entire book. I remember thinking that at the time of the original airing. The original novel carries the story further in time than the TV show did. Obviously a decision the producers and network made at the time... and obviously it's too late to change that now.

So, if you liked it then and want to revisit it, do so with confidence. It aged well!

If you haven't seen it, you should. There aren't too many works around that were written by people who lived that era of the military, and especially not many that are done so well. Irwin Shaw did it with ""The Young Lions"". Jones's ""From Here To Eternity"" trilogy. Very few others.

4155703,4,B003MRD9KQ,"I hope this review finds a home amongst the long suffering hardcore fans who must've been in agony (30+ years!) for the official release. But it's here and I hope you guys enjoy the well-deserved DVD production.

First off, I'm a huge fan of the tv mini-series format that ran from the 70's thru the late 80's, and I was stunned that I had never heard of this production before. Not once ever. As I think about it, I'm still amazed that this slipped past for so long.

I read all 35 reviews that were posted here since 1998 (IMDB reviews) - and I agree with all of you wholeheartedly - this was a fantastic and truly wonderful production.

And I also agree it was a dastardly crime that it took this long for 'Once An Eagle' to be given back to the viewing public.

Okay, onto the review. (some spoilers - so be warned)

As new fan of the series, I was surprised at how good the story that was told. Typically, as others have mentioned, the WWII drama is over the top, hyper-melodramatic and ultimately ""Hollywood-ized"" - presenting a false empty impression of the lives of soldiers, both officers and enlisted; especially those soldiers who did their service in between WWI and WWII. Can you imagine being a 2LT for 17 years?!?

You couldn't have better defined the transition between a peacetime Army and wartime Army. The crafty officers who ably played the political game often meant that battle troops would be left behind in the promotions department; creating the initial paper-pusher trained service that combat hardened Imperial Japanese forces could take advantage of.

Love that scene when John Fujioka, despite portraying an army officer who looks suspiciously like Hideki Tojo, clearly represented the real-life naval attach to Washington D.C. in that period - a certain Captain Isoroku Yamamoto who often deftly deflected concerns that Imperial Japan would ever be a threat to the United States. That clever warrior. He was already on a war footing back in '28, thirteen years before Pearl.

And very interestingly, I enjoyed how the production dealt with Court's homosexuality without having to confront it, which would have skewed the storyline in a pathetic attempt to validate some kind of political point, either pro or con. Very well done. Subtlety like this is a lost art in today's world of screaming-in-your-face lack of diplomatic skills. I realize that some may disagree with me here. But that's my impression given the collective scenes of the man on a personal level; what little there was to reveal - was very revealing indeed.

I've read the comparisons between this and 'Winds Of War'. Until I had seen 'Eagle' - I would've been hard pressed to say that anything was better for the period. And because of the budget, obviously the battle scenes will always favor Winds. But the true character and temperament of the war, the men and women who were involved - you have to watch Once An Eagle.

My only serious complaint was the ending. It felt like it was shortened by one episode, with many unanswered and unresolved questions. For example:

- What happened with Sam's decision to hold Court responsible for his actions at ""Palladium""? Of course he stuck to his guns and went forward, but what about after?

- The point at which 'Palladium' occurs suggests the latter part of the war, mid-to-late 1944. There was still a lot of fighting and many battles left in the Pacific theater - was Sam ever given a chance to command again? Or did he lose his chance by accusing a fellow officer of dereliction and murder? Typically those charges in an official inquiry will always taint both officers involved - irrespective of the results, but the ending doesn't point to any single foregone conclusion.

- Did Sam and Tommie ever resolve their issues with one another, the loss of their son, and get back together? I know that things pointed in that direction, but to see them put Donny to rest *as a couple* and move on would have been a reward for viewers who traveled with them throughout their amazing journey. A summation, perhaps after the war had ended, showing them at the home on the lake. Something.

- Was Jinny ever able to settle down and find a life of her own apart from her highly dysfunctional family?

- Was it possible, however remotely, that Donny somehow survived? I know they had the funeral, meaning the Army Air Corp was able to retrieve the remains. But it happened back then that some aviators survived - concealing their American identities by tossing their dog tags into a pile of burning wreckage to throw off & evade opposing forces, attempting to contact partisans, and maybe even make it back to the allied lines.

Even a counting of... skulls... would mean little if the B-29 stuck bottom first - the ball turret gunner's body would have essentially disintegrated making an accurate accounting improbable. Or even worse - had the B29 been unable to drop its payload before impact - what would the corps troops think? The bodies, what little remained, would be completely destroyed thereby making a count of the tags meaningless if not impossible. I can't see how anyone could make an honest appraisal in those situations. Questions like these haunted families for years afterwards, so I honestly see it as possible.

Overall - fantastic and well worth the 7 hours spent.

I always and thoroughly enjoy stumbling onto a hidden unexpected gem. :-)",1289001600,2,5400,4.7819548872180455

Before this mini series, the  soldier were either the WWII type film where the Military was shown to flawless and marching from victory to victory. Or you had the anti military film where frankly everyone in uniform it seems was a ""baby killer"" or something nasty. Instead you see the life of a good man who found a home in the Army and his rise to higher and higher command. This film shows him to be not perfect as he has his flaws & problems like everyone else has. (His wife was frankly a jerk that seemed to be constantly unhappy for no real reason)  I also liked the fact that his rival Massengale is shown to be a monster but a believable one.

He was the absolute embodiment of Sam Damon.  With a performance so off-the-scale good, how was he not even nominated for an Emmy?  (Probably because not too many Hollywood types who make the Emmy choices ever read the book -- hence the lack of appreciation.)

It's easy to take issue with the deviations from the book, particularly the ending.  (Even with nearly 9 hours to play with, something's gotta give in any screen adaptation of a novel of such length.)  But what's indisputable is how well the show captures the book's tone and spirit.  I thought the remade-for-TV ending involving the angry Sam Damon-Court Massengale confrontation was the best scene in the entire miniseries -- a satisfying, well-timed conclusion.
