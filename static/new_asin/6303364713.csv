630279,4,6303364713,"This is a cute movie and Shirley Temple is just adorable in it, but there is a scene at the end of the movie in which little Shirley is--literally--in the clutches of the bad guy.  She is bodily carried to the rooftop of her apartment building, screaming, ""Mommy!  Daddy!  Help me!!"" for about six or seven minutes while the police are in pursuit with guns drawn and bullets being fired.  I didn't find this appropriate for my young daughter, who currently is enamored with little Shirley Temple.  At 2 1/2 years old, my child is too young to understand that ""Baby Take a Bow"" is just a movie and that the little girl was not in mortal danger during the making of the film.  I will let her watch other movies by Shirley Temple rather than this one.
I don't know how many films Temple had made by the time ""Baby Take a Bow"" was filmed, but it certainly shows that she had tremendous talent at a very young age.  She was truly a child star and entirely deserving of that title.  What a wonderful little actress!",988761600,14,1009,4.358288770053476

630339,4,6303364713,"*My review does contain a spoiler*, but it's something good to know if you watch this with young children (6 and under).  We received the box set of movies (Bright Eyes, Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm & this one) for my young daughter who loves singing and dancing.  She loves watching Shirley Temple dance and act, and overall enjoyed this movie but be forewarned that the end is rather scary (SPOILER ALERT:  she's kidnapped briefly at the end and is caught in crossfire which frightened my daughter).  The scene is over within minutes and compared to today's movie violence is very tame, but I wish I'd known so I could have addressed it ahead of time.  From an adult perspective though it was a very clever film and my older daughter loved it and understood the storyline.  Definitely enjoyable and better for her to watch then Bright Eyes which is really scary!",1325894400,,862,4.675496688741722

630341,4,6303364713,"Two years into Shirley's career she achieved top billing in a movie, and deservedly so.  James Dunn as Shirley's father Eddie Ellison is funny, as is Ray Walker as Larry Scott, a close friend of Eddie, but Shirley's cute antics are a memorable feature of this movie, the first of about thirty movies in which Shirley either received top billing or was a co-star.

Eddie Ellison is an ex-convict who has done his time.  He has a good job as a driver for a wealthy man.  After Larry Scott gets out of prison, Eddie helps him get a job with the same man.  Things are going fine except for the presence of Private Investigator Welch (Alan Dinehart).  Welch believes that Eddie and Larry are laying low until the right opportunity comes along.  When a pearl necklace comes up missing from Eddie and Larry's employer, Welch does everything possible to make Eddie and Larry appear guilty.  In the meantime, the real thief is getting away.

While the subject of this movie is relatively serious, the movie is played for laughs throughout.  Shirley is cute and her antics on screen are funny and enjoyable every moment she is in front of the camera.  However, I am reluctant to recommend this movie for children because of scenes in this movie involving guns and a large knife.  Most adults, particularly fans of Shirley Temple, will find these scenes clever and both a little scary and a little funny.

Shirley's film career was expanding rapidly in 1934, the year of this movie.  Shirley manages to charm her mother, her father, nearly everyone in the movie except Welch - another reason to dislike him, and the audience.  If you want to see Shirley as she begins a phenomenal career, watch ""Little Miss Marker"" and then this movie and you will understand how she became the darling of Depression era America.

Enjoy!",1167609600,,1810,4.698412698412699
630342,4,6303364713,"Shirley Temple is the daughter of a former criminal (James Dunn) and a beautiful blonde (Claire Trevor). The three seem to be the perfect family, but father's past keeps catching up to him. There's a cop out to get him and a gangster on the loose hoping to enlist the help of anyone he can get, the shadier the better. Despite his resistance, the gangster finds a way to access the family through sweet little Shirley who thinks it is all a game.

Things certainly have changed since this film was made. No parent in their right mind would leave a four year old to play outside unattended with a known criminal on the loose.

This film certainly isn't what I expected it to be. It is more of an adult film than something geared toward children because of the mature subject.

Temple is very cute with her sweet smile and golden curls. Unfortunately, she seems a bit sad and her syrupy personality seems a bit forced. There are several scenes where we can see her smile quickly fade when her lines are delivered or when she is concentrating on her dancing. Perhaps she was being worked too hard or truly wasn't having fun. Nevertheless, she's very lovable.

It is unfortunate that the DVD is promoted as being in color and the black and white original is heralded as an extra feature. The color doesn't look awful, but it wasn't meant to be so. People should be able to appreciate the film as it was made, not a jazzed up version for the close-minded who refuse to see anything in black and white.",1165190400,,1496,4.468864468864469
630343,4,6303364713,"At the age of only seven,young Shirley Temple made her first leading starring role for Fox Studios with 1934's ""Baby Take A Bow"" and thus a legendary child star was born to become the newest studio box-office attraction. Young Shirley lives with her mom (Claire Trevor) and ex-con dad (James Dunn).But when a pair of her dad's friends pearl necklace is stolen,it's up to him to catch the real crook and also convince himself that he isn't the thief he use to be years ago. Featuring wonderful strong performances and a great direction by Harry Lachman (Laurel & Hardy's ""Our Relations"" and ""Dante's Inferno""),the film never loses its comedy stylings nor dramatic tone and highly fast-paced all the way. Highly recommended !

ABOUT THE DVD:

This fun film makes its wonderful DVD debut as part of the Voulme Two Shirley Temple DVD Collection of her beloved films. This DVD features both a restored black & white version as well as a brand-new digitally colorized version that completely blows away the horrid 1994 colorized VHS release. Legend Films has always done outstanding work on the colorization processing for the films they release as well as including the original B&W version too,but extras are nothing more than a lackluster effort (hence the four-star rating).As with the previous Temple releases from Fox and Legend,it contains both unrestored trailers for ""Heidi"" and ""Little Miss Broadway"".Despite the absence of many extras,owning both great transfers of the film on one disc makes this a must-have to any fan of classic film or to family film buffs,you won't be dissappointed with this release !  Well-recommended !",1152230400,5,1632,5.059479553903346
630344,4,6303364713,"Why can't they make more movies like Shirley does??? The classic family films that always have a happy ending???

This is one of Shirley's best in my opinon the on-screen dynamic you see between Shirley and her dad(Dunn) is present. Dunn is a great actor--for in this movie you do see him as Shirley's dad who worships his family and littel Shirley.

Shirley as always the entertainer does a ton of dancing in this scene including the famous ""copy-cat"" dance.

I gave four stars because I found the whole jewel-thief thing and hide and seek jewel thing boring-- me and my cousins fast forward through that one but, still it's a great movie.

Lots, of great on-screen chemistry and Shirley's dance. This is a precious film-- watch it with your kids...or buy the tape. You won't be disappointed if you lovve good clean fun!!!",1106697600,9,823,4.694444444444445
