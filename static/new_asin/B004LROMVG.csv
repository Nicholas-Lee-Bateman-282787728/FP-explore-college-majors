4401902,5,B004LROMVG,Nickelodeon has finally gotten off their butts and licensed some of their shows to Shout Factory for DVD releases.

4401913,4,B004LROMVG,"While I didn't watch much TV growing up, I did catch a few shows while visiting relatives or friends.  One I got hooked on was Hey Dude!  Season 1 just hit DVD, and I snapped it up.  The show doesn't quite hold up as well as I remember it, but it is still fun.

This show originally aired from 1989-1991 and was one of Nickelodeon's first scripted shows produced.  Right there, it holds a place in television history, right?

The show follows the misadventures of the staff of a dude ranch in Arizona.  While all the sets were constructed, it was filmed on an actual guest ranch in Arizona, giving it a very real feeling.

In the first episode, we meet the teen staff.  The three returning staff members are Ted (David Lascher) who has just been promoted to senior staff (whatever that means).  There's Melody (Christine Taylor) who is the lifeguard at the rarely seen pool.  Rounding out this trio is Danny (Joe Torres), a Hopi Indian.  The new girl on the block is Brad (Kelly Brown).  She's rich yet is working at the ranch because she loves horses.  On the adult front, there's Lucy (Debrah Kalman).  She's in charge of the stables and is kind but firm.

As the series opens, the ranch has just been bought by Benjamin Ernst (David Brisbin), and he's moved out there from New Jersey with his son Buddy (Josh Tygiel).  Mr. E doesn't know his way around the ranch and is often trying to come up with ways to advertise that don't quite work out.  He's your typical bumbling adult on a kid's show, but he does have his moments that show he's much smarter than he normally looks.

The plots for these episodes are usually fairly light and fun.  The guys take on the girls to prove who is the best.  Ted takes on all kinds of odd jobs to buy a saddle he wants, talking his friends into taking care of his regular chores for him.  A drought brings a water crisis to the ranch.  Brad and Melody have to spend the night in the desert to show they are ready to lead overnight camping trips.  And in my favorite episode of the season, Ted and Brad get handcuffed together overnight and must find a way to deal with each other that long.

The only relationship they ever really played up was Brad and Ted.  They have the usual snipping relationship characters often have when denying they have feelings for each other.

As you can see, the plots of the show are fairly standard fair.  While there's no laugh track, I'd definitely say it borders on the sitcom side of the spectrum.  The stories are light and fun with everything being wrapped up by the end of the 25 minute episode.  This is good escapism - nothing more and nothing less.

I hadn't seen the show for quite a few years, so I was surprised at several things that jumped out at me.  For one thing, this is obviously low budget.  The sound echoes at times and a few of the sets look cheap.  The 80's fashion and hairstyles are pretty obvious at times, too, especially Ted's mullet.  I have a feeling these might be a turn off if I weren't already familiar with the show, but as I got caught up in reuniting with these old friends, I soon didn't notice these flaws at all.  In fact, they added to the charm.

Then there's the acting which is...adequate.  There's a reason that most of the cast pretty much only did this show.  It's not that the acting is bad enough to push you out of the show.  But when the actors have to do much that shows range, they appear to really struggle.  Again, as I get caught up in the show, this isn't something I regularly notice, so it's not super bad, but it is noticeable.  The exceptions are Christine Taylor (yes, Mrs. Ben Stiller) and David Lascher who are the only two to have gone on to other things.  Again, it's not that the rest of the cast isn't watchable.  These two are just the best actors of the bunch.

This show produced a bunch of short seasons, so season 1 consisted of only 13 episodes.  They're presented here on two discs in their native stereo and full screen.  I would have been happy with just the episodes, but there is a bonus feature - an almost 17 minute interview with Christine Taylor talking about her memories of working on the show.  She seems to recall it with fondness, although she never realized just how popular it was.

Those with my fond memories of Hey Dude! will love watching season 1 again.  The characters are entertaining enough that it overcomes the poor production values and iffy acting.",1432339200,,4423,4.4

4401916,5,B004LROMVG,"One of my favorite shows ever! I discovered the show when I was looking through the internet looking at different early Nick shows. Hey Dude was one of the only ones who really stood out to me. The show is a comedy, but also teaches life lessons. The setting is on a Dude Ranch where teenagers work and live for the summer. Mr. Earnest owns the ranch and has a son named Buddy. They get in many scrapes and scrabbles, but always manage to get out of them comically. I would recommend this show to anyone who enjoys comedies. Though I'm sure anyone could enjoy the show!",1420070400,,569,4.327102803738318

He was sooooo suprised when I gave it to him. It made his whole year. He is a HUGE FAN of this old but great show. They really should bring it back to Nickelodeon, along with the 90's version of Figure It Out, Salute Your Shorts, & The  Adventures of Pete & Pete. They are all great 90's shows from Nickelodeon.

4401922,4,B004LROMVG,"I can't get this DVD a full five star review like I wanted to, not because of the show but because of the poor DVD quality. It looks as if they transferred it to DVD straight from VHS. Now I understand that the show was originally recorded to video and not film, and is not in HD but they could have at least enhanced the image a little bit. It's as if Nickelodeon doesn't realize what they really have with all these old shows!

  This DVD is actually coming from Nickelodeon so I don't think you will be able to find a better quality DVD but for all it's worth it's not that bad. it's still watchable and I still highly recommend this DVD.

  I was having a sense of nostalgia and was getting really tired of all this new crap that's on TV currently. So, I bought all the seasons from all the old shows I used to watch on Nick, FOX, and ABC. So far Nick is the only one totally bias of it's past. This brought back SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO many memories!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1402876800,,962,4.229508196721311

But just like a lot of other TV shows I grew up with in the late 80's - early 90's, this show doesn't seem quite as great today as it once did to me.  To put it simply, this show is cheesy as hell for me to watch now.  But it's fun to own and have on my shelves with other horrible mementos of my past.

4401965,4,B004LROMVG,"My brother and I used to always watch this after school.  The story lines are cheesy but it's good clean family fun.  I purchased this for nostalgic purposes.  This product is from Shout Factory which is notorious for producing non-closed captioned DVDs because of the high costs associated with it.  This is another one that does not have any closed captions.

The thirteen episodes of Season 1 are:

1) Day One At the Bar None - When horse-crazy Bradley arrives at the Bar None Ranch, everyone thinks she's a great guest.  Ted McGriff's efforts to impress Bradley are unsuccessful.

2) Battle of the Sexes - Who's a better rider, a better cook, better at catching fish - Ted and Danny or Melody and Bradley?  They agree to disagree in a comical ""Battle of the Sexes.""

3) Goldilocks - Buddy Ernst finally finds something to like at the ranch:  a yellow-maned pony named Goldilocks.  When Buddy learns that his father plans to sell the horse, he and Goldilocks head out into the heat of the desert.

4) Ted's Saddle - Ted's selfishness and desire for a saddle that once belonged to John Wayne get him in trouble.

5) The Competition - Brad and Melody want the chance to lead overnight camping trips in the desert, but only one of them can do it.  Who will it be?

6) Rehearsal for Romance - Sixteen-year-old Melody's fondest wish comes true when a ""college man"" asks her out on a date.  Will she use Ted's ridiculous date coaching to help her through this momentous evening?

7) Perfect Father - Ranch owner Ben Ernst never has time for his 12-year-old son Buddy, but when two crooks try to rob the guests, father and son team up to save the day.

8) The Good, The Bad, & The Obnoxious - One of Bradley's snooty friends from private school shows up at the ranch, much to Brad's embarrassment.

9) Rainmen - Danny does some soul-searching when the ranch's well runs dry and he must decide whether to help his friends or remain true to his Native American heritage.

10) Ted & Brad Get Handcuffed - Finally, Ted has the perfect scheme to get very, very close to Bradley - only the scheme backfires.

11) Suspicion - The kids at the ranch suspect a ranch guest of foul play - maybe even murder.

12) Employee of the Week - To encourage hard work and positive attitudes, Mr. Ernst sets up a competition to see who's the ""Employee of the Week.""

13) Pain In the Neck - Ted's fascination with girls sends Danny crashing to the ground from a tall ladder.  Now it's Danny's turn to have Ted wait on him.",1321920000,3,2496,4.469026548672566
4401966,5,B004LROMVG,"Thank God it's finally here.  I think it would have sold best as a complete box set, but I'll take individual seasons.

This is such a great show from my generation, so happy to FINALLY have a disc copy!",1321920000,,373,4.4411764705882355
4401967,5,B004LROMVG,Hi! I'm so excited about getting the first 2 episodes of Hey Dude. There's even a Hey Dude book on Amazon that's used. It's called Showdown at the Bar None. You'll save money if you get the used version. That would be a great book for libraries. I hope the next 3 seasons are available in the future. Hey Dude is my favorite old show from Nickelodeon.,1321574400,,351,4.253731343283582
4401968,5,B004LROMVG,"If you were a child of the '80s/early '90s I don't need to tell you how awesome ""Hey Dude"" is. It is perhaps one of the very best comedy shows that Nickelodeon had on the air.

Season 1 includes 13 ""bar none"" eps, each more over-the-top than the next. What I always liked about ""Hey Dude"" was that it was a kid's show that always made comedy out of everyday issues that kids have. Some of my favorite eps include ""Ted's Saddle"" and ""Ted and Brad Get Handcuffed"".

The series includes a strong cast of characters, including David Brisbin as the NJ native turned cowboy, Mr. Ernst, David Lascher as Ted McGriff (you gotta love that name), Kelly Brown as the resident rich girl Brad, Joe Torres (who is still very much alive) as Danny and  Christine ""Marcia Marcia Marcia"" Taylor as Melody.

Shout! included a brand-new interview with Christine (it's about 15 minutes in total) which was pretty interesting to watch.

This is packaged in a clear plastic case, and an episode guide is included on the inlay, the discs also include a color silkscreen picture on each (see scans of everything I posted).

Relive all the memories and enjoy all the hijinks in the wild west with season one of ""Hey Dude"". Here's hoping Shout! puts out further seasons of this western classic. Just be sure to watch out for those man-eating jack rabbits and that killer cacti.",1316908800,5,1350,4.604166666666667

Hey Dude was a pretty good show but let's hope that this is a good sign of things to come. After all, Nick still has other 90's releases to take care of - like finishing up with Clarissa and Pete & Pete. Try to drop Shout Factory a line and let them know what we want.

My only regret is they didn't get to tie all the story lines together, to give this show the ending it deserved. Please release the rest of the seasons!!",1311465600,2,417,4.160493827160494

Then you make all my dreams come true by releasing the remainder of Dragnet. Yay!!! And now Hey Dude. I loved this show when I was a kid. I was six when it came on and the only thing I ever watched on Nickelodeon was Nick at Nite so this show was perfect for me. Mr Ernst was my favorite character. Why? I guess I'm not sure. I remember hating Brad and thinking she was very unatttactive. Boy was I wrong. Kelly Brown (Brad) is smoking hot. So after watching one episode and not really liking it like I used to she kept me watching and I rediscovered after 22 years just how good this show was. Can't wait for future seasons to be released. Again thank you Shout.,1311206400,5,831,4.135802469135802
4402007,4,B004LROMVG,"Judge Dawn Hunt, DVD Verdict--From a time when a character still had to sheepishly confess his parents were divorced, this is a little gem of a series. While there are definite elements of slapstick, most of the time the cast manages to hold on to the edge just enough to keep from tipping over into outright silliness. As with many sitcoms, a number of the plots revolve around lying, specifically a little lie which snowballs until the characters are forced to tell the truth and then hugs are doled out.

One of the things that really struck me was how the teenagers all interacted with Buddy. I was really surprised they were so patient with him, going out of their way to make sure he was listened to and included. I understand that's how it was written but it's a dynamic that's rarely present nowadays. Any show that has teenagers and middle-schoolers together more often than not has tension between those characters. Usually it's the younger kids wanting attention and the older kids not wanting to be anywhere near the brats.

Another thing which stood out was the careful editing. It's like a neon sign now but back then I didn't know Brad wasn't riding that galloping horse, or Ted wasn't really in danger of being kicked by a stallion. It is very much a product of its time and I like that about it. I enjoy watching for those moments and seeing how they were made to convince an untrained eye what was occurring on screen.

This series has found its way into a lot of people's hearts, and I believe one of the reasons for that is more than half of the cast never went on to do anything else. Thus, there is no getting a fix for any of the actors. They're trapped in celluloid forever for fans here but nowhere else.

The only extra is an interview with series star Christine Taylor (17 min.) She goes into great detail about her experience filming the series, which was 65 episodes over two years. She was only 17 when she got the job so it was interesting to hear her perspective on how she perceived the process. Back then she was equally concerned with whether or not she was going to get to go to prom and graduate at home in Pennsylvania. A lot of what she learned about acting from the show she still carries with her. One of the most amusing elements of her interview is hearing her describe meeting Paris Hilton.

Christine Taylor AKA Ben Stiller's Wife is beautiful as always.
I really liked the show growing up and now to watch it I can see it's a little cheesy and kind of bad acting
The Quality isn't top notch but it's very nicely put together and the DVD covers are detailed so that's good an least the whole series is out to buy.",1461628800,,382,4.1066666666666665
