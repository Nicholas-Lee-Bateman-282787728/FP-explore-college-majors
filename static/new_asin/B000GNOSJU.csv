2615456,1,B000GNOSJU,"Joan Rivers live at the Palladium
I thought this would be a comical show.  What I got was a poorly filmed, course monlogue laced frequently with the ""F"" word and even the ""C"" word.  The camera was too far back from Joan and the film was of poor quality.  Joan had a cold and her speech was hard to hear and sometimes indistinct.  The DVD was a disaapointment, I will not be paying it a second time, it is in the garbage.  I guess my expectations of a witty show was not met.",1190764800,4,474,4.053763440860215
2615457,5,B000GNOSJU,"The Palladium and its inhabitants do not appreciate Joan Rivers. Does she care? Heck NO! She is sharp and delivers zinger after zinger to a shell-shocked British flock clinging to their chairs in horror and fear of the ever uncouth and divine Joan. Not even Barbara Streisand is safe from the queen of funny!

I have watched this over and again. Still enjoying it as much as the first time. Worth every penny.",1187568000,8,409,4.602739726027397
2615458,5,B000GNOSJU,"I am a total media wh*0re.  I have thousands of videos. i accidently saw this on HBO some time ago and just couldn't stop watching it.  if your into comedy, this one performance by the old bat is top notch along with performances like Chris rock on the last tour ( never scared?) , or Carlin when he was in top form.. or Carlos Mencia on his best days. really, Im a totally hetero male! 30+ years old, workout.. mechanic, im a normal guy! ..  i would never, have never, ever watched any joan rivers show. i mean, who would? thats for broads and chicks.  but let me tell you, ANY guy or girl will find this performance absoultely hilarious! its that good!",1184630400,4,654,4.2926829268292686
2615459,4,B000GNOSJU,"Here is the diminutive Larchmont dynamo just one step below full throttle, pulling very few punches from her honed-to-Ginsu sharp, raunchy nightclub routine. Gone is the outlandish visual image of old women using their ... as suction cups to go down the walls of the World Trade Center during 9-11, but her gray bunny slipper remains. The London Palladium is not made for Joan Rivers. It is huge and daunting and very stuffy looking. So are its inhabitants, who like Joan in theory, but in practice have trouble permitting laughter to rise up through their staid bodies. Nothing, particularly, is in good taste. But Joan is on her game and goes for it. She almost doesn't seem to care if she gets the laughs or not. She knows the material is strong. It is dense, full of set pieces and subtle asides. Past 70 now, the woman does not take the easy way out and coast. This is a master class in stand-up comedy, extended verbal clowning of the first order. Small things are hilarious (Theresa Heinz' waving during the John Kerry campaign like she's shaking a stubborn ketchup bottle) and so are longer bits, like about burying her mother-in-law -- actually, cremating -- before the show. You momentarily feel for Joan, displaying a wistful sadness, until she complains how tiring it was keeping her foot up for so long on the oven door. If this had been filmed in the New York nightclub where she holds court every Wednesday, where the deserved laughs flow like a river of delicious sin, this would be a five-star DVD, the perfect artifact of a great comedian raging into the twilight at or near the top of her game. What she lacks in energy from the ""What Becomes a Semi-Legend Most?"" days, she makes up for by being fiendishly feral, dare I say sexy? The only drawback is the audience. They're lucky to have her, but they don't deserve her.",1182902400,15,1839,4.626911314984709
2615460,4,B000GNOSJU,"Not as hilarious as her former show at the London Palladium, relatively speaking, but still very, very funny.  This comedienne has very few inhibitions, even at the age of 70+.",1181952000,,176,4.866666666666666
2615461,5,B000GNOSJU,"Can we talk? The one and only indomitable, inconquerable, inspiring Joan Rivers live at the Palladium in London, is at once ""allegedly"" biting, tasteless, and utterly charming and hysterically funny. You do not want to miss her takes on everything from celebrities to farts to politicians and a whole lot more. I laughed from beginning to end...its that good and that funny...and also quite funny watching some of the 'stiff upper lip Brits in the audience' reacting to some of Ms Rivers brash humour. She tells it like it is. Joan you are truly an inspiration. First Class and highly recommended as an all round mood enhancer.",1164240000,24,627,4.869158878504673
2615472,5,B000GNOSJU,"Was Hysterical! LMAO' an GROW UP' to the Peeps who Don't Like Cursing, It's Joan Rivers, its Comedy... Can We Talk?! Get Humor! Thats Her Delivery of Jokes Peeps!",1414454400,,162,4.620689655172414
2615473,5,B000GNOSJU,"The saddest part was the beginning where it said STILL ALIVE and she isn't now.  There is nobody ever in comedy like her and nobody will ever compare to her.  This show was great.  What really fascinated me besides her obvious quick wit was the fact that she had a cold and blew her nose; she tried to be discreet about it and I found myself wondering where she was going to place the Kleenex she just used.  I find it interesting when people hate this; if you don't know Joan by now and the fact that she is going to be nasty and critical of everybody especially herself then why even watch her.  This show is mind blowing; her energy could give any twenty year old a run for the money, her jokes are insanely funny, her comedic timing is outrageous; she's fast on her feet and despite how much she puts herself down a very pretty woman (yeah, yeah I know a little help)  RIP JOAN THE WORLD IS NOT THE SAME WITHOUT YOU!!",1413763200,2,921,4.204545454545454

2615477,5,B000GNOSJU,You better be ready to laugh when you watch Joan Rivers ! This is funny. Have seen her in person which is even better because she always updates her show and has timely jokes. No one is safe as she tickles your funnybone.,1360627200,4,221,4.162790697674419

2615479,2,B000GNOSJU,"Wasn't very funny at all, and not that much reaction from the audience. Some of the material was sick - eg. making fun of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Alzheimer's. Then dragging around her supposedly deceased dog's fur, and claiming it committed suicide like her husband. Poor taste.",1281744000,,296,5.1875
2615480,5,B000GNOSJU,"I play this DVD for everyone that comes to my house,its hysterical. Some people find Joan mean spirited,but the women makes fun of herself more than anyone else.
My favorite joke from the show is when she talks about the first time she had sex. Joan says it was  a RAPE,and it was horrible,Thank God the guy never pressed charges.
And when she's on the floor trying to get up at her age. She says this is why she never made out with Bill Clinton.
The ending is kind of sad,when Joan talks about her late husband,but she still has a great joke that ends the show when Edgar died.
This women is funnier than ever.",1252713600,11,611,4.267241379310345
