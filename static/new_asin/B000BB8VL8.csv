The video has been helpful in making me realize that even the pros don't win all the time, and when I do go head-to-head, my chances are at least as good as the next guy's. Good luck to us all!",1200614400,,276,3.7758620689655173

8084449,5,B000BB8VL8,"I've always been on the fence when it comes to Phil Hellmuth. His accomplishments are amazing but are often overshadowed by his antics. Even in this set he throws tantrums and acts foolishly; however, it is the most amazing display of poker talent I have watched. I was so impressed after watching Hellmuth completely change styles to best exploit his opponents weaknesses. He faced off against some very tough opponents- Huck Seed, Antonio Esfandiari, Chris Ferguson.

 I started off kind of wanting Hellmuth to lose because his tantrums are embarassing and childish. But as I watched him adjust to his opponents styles and punch and counterpunch I really felt like I was watching a savant, a true poker genius. I got the DVD set and was able to watch it through with no delays between broadcasts or commercials and I really gained respect for heads up poker and for Hellmuth. I started off being part of the crowd of Hellmuth bashers but completely changed the way I think about him and about poker. The laydowns he is able to make are beyond comprehension in many cases but if you understand his approach to playing and winning tournament poker you realize there is strategy here that only a few players understand at this level. Possibly the best showcase of individual talent contained in any DVD set out there. Don't miss this one.

As of this posting Amazon.com was not offering this set. I got mine directly from the website after watching the commercials for the original broadcast. Whatever you pay it is worth owning in my opinion. It is of tremendous value in understanding playing styles and adjusting to those styles and completely changing your own style when necessary. I think Amazon has a policy against web addresses in reviews, so do a Google search on heads up poker to find the address.",1134777600,9,1808,4.788461538461538
