6120825,5,B00GWSKWH0,"I highly recommend this film. It doesn't have too many graphic videos like other animal rights films, and it really makes you think about things from a philosophical point of view. Well done, Mark!",1392768000,,197,4.823529411764706
6120826,5,B00GWSKWH0,"IMO, The creator of this documentary, Mark Devries is the ""missing link"" between the arcane world of rights-philosophy and the lives of everyday people. With unflinching
resolve and clarity, he brings humans and their speciesism face-to-face
in a way that is not only compelling but entertaining, and often very
funny. My 14-year-old son said this movie changed his life, and I echo
that sentiment.

After 60+ years of walking this Earth, I am still flabbergasted by
peoples' ability to defy logic and deny responsibility for any of the
pain they cause others. Even people who have themselves overcome
oppression fail to see (or care) that others are suffering terribly
every day. I have always felt alienated from my own species because of these
thoughts. Almost as if I (or they) had come from another planet. Not
until I saw this film did I find an artful, coherent expression of my
deepest feelings. It gives me hope.

It's good to know that I am not alone. Thanks to the makers of this
film, and more power to you.
Whether folks believe in animal rights or not. This is an important film - worth seeing!",1392681600,,1108,4.7357512953367875
6120827,5,B00GWSKWH0,"This was a great depiction of farming practices and very educational on
things that go on behind the scenes that most are completely unaware
of. It has impacted me so much that I am now seriously re-evaluating
what and how I eat. I have seen other documentaries dealing with
societies' treatment of animals such as Earthlings, but the depictions
were so horrific that it was difficult to watch (narrated by Jaoquin
Phoenix). Speciesism was also jarring but more in a way that can relate
to yourself and daily eating practices. As it turns out, Speciesism was
the movie that turned two friends of mine vegan. This is probably
the only documentary I have seen that has motivated me to action.

6120830,5,B00GWSKWH0,"As someone who has been interested in animal protection issues for many years, I expected this film to focus mostly on matters that I was already very familiar with. However, after attending a screening, I was very impressed with the candid, non-preachy approach that the filmmaker has taken. The film addresses the questions that are difficult for many of us to answer, such as why certain species' sentience deserves greater respect than that of other species (hence the title).

6120831,3,B00GWSKWH0,"In show biz parlance, I am an ""easy room."" That is, I come in to this type of film already wanting to love it and sing high praises. That said, I had a mini-viewing with my vegan husband, and our housemate, a new vegan. The filmmaker is a very pleasant guy and touches on all the right notes. The graphic images are kept to a minimum, which is great for showing to to sensitive souls. The interviews are edited well, although I have a personal bias against Temple Grandin and her complicity with agbiz,, but I digress.

Film is supposed to engage and entertain, even documentaries. I am fully aware that this is a low-budget affair, but we all were fighting off sleep in a desperate attempt to stay awake during this film. It had a ""King Corn"" feel, but none of its humor or wit. As a matter of fact, the DVD sleeve refers to ""Laugh out loud"" humor, which completely escaped us.

This seemed more like a junior project than a product ready for distribution. There were great questions asked, providing that you could stay awake to hear them.",1391558400,5,1041,4.445026178010472
6120832,5,B00GWSKWH0,"This film isn't a plea for animal rights or an indictment of industries that use animals. Instead, it goes to the core questions: are we more important than the other animals with whom we share the planet, and, if so, why? These questions begin a journey that goes in several provocative directions and compels the viewer to reexamine long held beliefs and assumptions. It's a gauntlet, thrown down before generations of behaviors and ideas, and it's very well conceived and constructed. Definitely a must see for any thinking person seeking to bring more awareness and consciousness to one's life and choices.",1390003200,24,610,5.0495049504950495
6120833,5,B00GWSKWH0,"I'm so glad I was able to nab this. This movie has been constantly going out of stock.

I just finished watching this and I must say, I'm impressed with the quality taking into consideration the limited money and people. There are some occasional editing blips that probably should have been smoothed over but overall I quite enjoyed this and am happy to add to my animal rights collection.

This isn't a hippy pro-Peta video. Far from it I'd say, in fact, Mark Devries even starts out thinking PETA with their silly tactics were a bit dumb. Unlike many people though, he goes to their headquarters and actually asks them about their organization and along the way interviews the head of PETA, as well as Bruce Frederich who worked (and possibly still does?)for PETA but also communicates with other animal rights groups like vegan outreach. Anyway, Bruce is a really cool guy and I'm happy he had the chance to talk because his comments often really do hit their mark.

You will be jumping around a bit to different places throughout the film. Like when they were discussing the idea of specieism and what constitutes our idea of why humans are special because of ""intelligence"", you are taken briefly to mentally challenged care homes and shown what they go through, and then you are taken back to the interviewees about how if intelligence matters, why are animals not included in our moral framework if some humans unfortunately do not possess the same intelligence as some other animals.

Many great questions here. I found it really interesting how most of the factory farms refused him coming onto their property even though he was saying he'd do it on their conditions. When a supposed ""humane"" farm lets him in, which sources to whole foods, you'll be in for a much needed shock when realizing that these ""humane"" farms and labels aren't as they are cracked up to be. They are indeed better, but when the cameras take you into the warehouse, I hope the picture becomes clear.

Mark Devries takes all the arguments against animal rights, against vegetarianism/veganism, actually tries to embody them and puts himself in situations that would challenge the everday person's horizon. He even interviews people off the street, asking them why they think they need meat, or why they think human suffering is more important than animal suffering. It's quite interesting to hear their responses and when Mark challenges their claim just made, them retreating.

I very much like argument at the end personally about the holocaust analogy. Mark interviews a person who survived the holocaust himself and his story might just make something on the back of your neck stand up. He mentions how he saw the bodies of all the people laying on the ground, their glasses, their possessions, how they had been packed up into cattle trucks, and the apathy of those in power. After he escaped he came across a factory farm and said he saw something peculiarly similar, animal parts on the ground, animals being shoved into tight spaces, the absolute lack of concern from those in power.

Later, he interviewed a person from Jewish organization and talked to a guy that was absolutely convinced that animal suffering, even if it was on the level of billions scale, was not as significant, as the suffering of humans on a million scale. Something I noticed though was how uncomfortable the interviewee was by his body language. His body language seemed to convey that what he once thought of as true was being challenged and him being exposed to this incoming reality was uncomfortable.

This movie WILL challenge your views. It doesn't try to say veganism is the answer, but because the ethical arguments for animal rights are so strong, it leads that way by default.

I hope you give this a chance.",1388361600,27,3787,4.83179012345679
6120834,5,B00GWSKWH0,"This is an EXCELLENT, must see movie!  I highly recommend everyone watch it.  The treatment of animals is the biggest social justice issue of our time, and this movie helps the viewer challenge his / her conventional wisdom in a gentle and humble yet very convincing and thought provoking way.  There is no blood and minimal graphic content.  Rather than using a lot of shocking footage, the director conveys information via interviews with experts in the field as well as with everyday people.  I think anyone would be hard pressed not to reevaluate the way they view and use animals in everyday life after watching this movie.

6120853,5,B00GWSKWH0,"Speciesism is a tremendously deep film that is totally accessible and challenges our species to step back and think for a moment about the animals we consume for food and consider them as feeling creatures that are absolutely capable of all the basic emotions and physical experiences that most people think to be exclusive to our species, i.e. pain, joy, sadness, despair etc...

Anyone (I would hope) who owns a dog or cat  would concede that their pet(s) are capable of these basic feelings both physically and emotionally. Why then do we cherish our pets, more then fellow human beings in many cases, and continue to consume animal products both as food and clothing? This fundamentally makes no sense at all. If we agree that our dogs or cats (and other pets) feel happiness, sadness, cold, warmth, pain, physical affection etc... then why do we think that cows, pigs, chickens, turkeys etc... are incapable of these basic feelings and experiences?

A brief personal history about my journey to become Vegan; I am 50 now and myself was a huge consumer of meat and dairy products for the majority of my life. I was raised on meat and potatoes type meals and during the 70s through the 2000s probably ate fast food 4+ times a week. For health, an admittedly selfish reason, a few years ago I gave up red meat, then a year ago gave up all meat and still consumed some dairy products. Again for health reasons I needed to become Vegan and stop consuming all animal products. I still cheated and had some dairy here and there for treats as recent as a couple months ago.

A few weeks ago I just viewed another ground breaking documentary on Netflix - Cowspiracy. This film approaches the mass consumption of animal products from an environmental degradation standpoint primarily. The sheer environmental impact of consuming animals to the extant we in the USA do is staggering to say the least. So much so that animal agriculture contributes MORE to environmental problems than business and consumer use of fossil fuels and coal. When Cowspiracy educated me that it takes 2,600 gallons of water to make 1 pound of beef, not to mention the feed it takes as well, I was floored. We are in the 4th year of unprecedented drought in California and all the water savings and restriction measures put upon us are NOTHING compared to what it takes to raise animals for food. This alone made me say enough, I have to stop supporting the animal agriculture industry for purely environmental reasons.

Cowspiracy (environmental impact of mass animal product consumption) coupled with the enlightening views of Speciesism (ethics and morality of consuming animal products) leave me with no alternative but to stop consuming animal products.

As I mentioned earlier my journey to become Vegan began for my own selfish health reasons. Now, even if I did not have personal health issues to face, I can NO LONGER justify, in any way, the consumption of animal products personally for moral and environmental reasons.

I wish you the best in your personal journey of discovery and enlightenment.",1447113600,6,3078,4.851428571428571

That being said, only 15 minutes of this film & I had to turn it off to take a break. Watching the footage for myself of what happens on egg farms has not only sickened me but my attitude has completely changed toward how we will eat eggs in the future. I cannot support this kind of animal torture. You can bet that my husband will be building our own ""large"" chicken house.
Eating fast food has been a quick fix for when my family doesn't have time to cook. It doesn't happen often but I'm guilty of ordering Big Macs & egg mc muffins and to be honest I almost didn't want to watch this movie. Anytime I see an animal hurting it affects me very deeply. I can't watch those commercials about abused animals because if I were to adopt one more stray cat or dog we wouldn't have the ability to care for them. Deep down I knew it was possible these factories might be hurting animals & it's almost that ""ignorance is bliss"" attitude. I'm glad I purchased this film & am allowing myself to see the reality. Ignorance is not bliss, it's ignorant. Though I may never be a full on vegetarian due to my personal beliefs, I can admit I was wrong to close my eyes & ears to the abuse in factory farms.

6120890,3,B00GWSKWH0,"While I agree that this film gets off to a mediocre, meandering start, about thirty minutes in it finds a voice. Yes, the overall feel of this film is amateurish; Peter Singer makes clear from the get go that he has no previous experience with film making. Though, by the end it joined my list of most recommended films. I like that Peter didn't have a vegan agenda at the start. Hell, he didn't even have a definitive subject matter to explore. It was through his journey making the film that he himself had his eyes opened to speciesism and animal cruelty, resulting in him becoming vegan. The film does a good job of asking and answering questions about our abuse of others, human and nonhuman, who have lesser intelligence. Numerous people are asked why it is we treat animals the way we do, and are repeatedly silenced on this subject. Despite the amateur feel, I find this film to be a very important tool and eye opener in the discussion- or lack of- of speciesism. I highly recommend it with the preface that one has only to get through the first thirty minutes or so to discover gold.",1406678400,6,1093,4.49748743718593
6120891,5,B00GWSKWH0,"Great movie for skeptics of the animal rights movement. It also explains the impact of environmental impact of processing meat. I am a life long vegetarian and had no idea how to explain why it's important to me, but this movie helped with that. I highly recommend it.",1406678400,,268,4.604166666666667
6120892,3,B00GWSKWH0,"As a vegan I wanted to like this movie, but it is sadly amateurish and just doesn't make it. The horrors of factory farming are pretty well documented at this point and the filmmaker just seems to meander around, hoping to gain access to various places, very tedious.",1405123200,5,267,4.583333333333333
6120893,5,B00GWSKWH0,"I was really taken with this film when I saw it with a full house an sponsored by a vegetarian association.  But that was preaching to the choir.  This is a film that should be seen by anyone who wants to know where their food comes from and how the animals they eat are treated.  That should be everyone.  Mark Devries does an excellent job with his premise, that we fail to recognize that other species are sentient, not objects, and should be treated with respect and kindness, whether you eat meat or not.  The film makes it's point with humor and balance and I highly recommend it.",1404691200,,586,4.388888888888889
6120894,5,B00GWSKWH0,"I really enjoyed watching this film. Mark Devries is a very talented young filmmaker. He is adorable and very funny in the movie. Although it deals with a heavy topic Mark manages to make it entertaining and easy to watch. It opened my eyes to the truth about  so called ""Humane Meat"" and really made me question many assumptions I had about animals. I highly recommend this film.",1404432000,,380,4.588235294117647
6120895,5,B00GWSKWH0,"Fantastic movie that accomplishes what it sets out to do and that is to delve into the question of why we treat some species ""special"" while we manage to disregard the other billions we are consuming.

And engaging film that explores hidden truths in a clever and non-confrontational manner. It's an easy-going ride whose journey unravels like a well plotted mystery. The most surprising answer at the end is what digests in your own mind regarding we human animals vs. the ""others"". A must see! Highly recommended!",1401321600,,515,4.919540229885057
6120896,5,B00GWSKWH0,"This documentary breaks down the issues surrounding animal rights to a form so simple and logical that they can no longer be denied! In an incredibly easy-to-relate manner, this documentary leaves no stone (ie anti-animal rights argument) unturned and leaves the viewer with thousands of questions, and the burning desire to break free from the speciesist society that we live in. Not at all preachy, just logical and fact based, with next to no scenes of animal cruelty. I can't recommend this documentary enough!!",1401148800,11,515,5.142857142857143

6120898,5,B00GWSKWH0,"This documentary both effectively and entertainingly challenges the (culturally ingrained) idea that our being human is a good enough reason for us as a species to have greater moral rights than non-human animals, and instills the notion that we can and should do better.  One of the best documentaries currently available that will hopefully help to herald a long-overdue wake-up call for our species.",1400889600,12,402,5.28125
6120899,5,B00GWSKWH0,"Mark Devries explored, asked questions, lots of questions... to uncover the human's belief in being superior to animals. This young man did an incredible job. I liked that the animal treatment shots were limited... just used enough to emphasize a point he was making. The film can be used to gently introduce veganism to the general meat eating public. All I can say is Mark... you did a fantastic job.",1397779200,,402,4.757142857142857
6120900,5,B00GWSKWH0,"The information presented in this video was amazing.  It makes you take a hard look at yourself for sure.  I always considered myself animal conscious because I don't eat red meat or pork, and opt for turkey and chicken instead... After seeing the whole foods farms super high standards, I still couldn't justify their suffering for me to eat something I don't even like that much.  The philosophical viewpoint added was very mind-opening and I've never thought of it that way.  Must watch!  The only way to stop corporate greed from causing suffering to people and animals is to stop buying it.  Consumers have all the power.",1397692800,,626,4.803738317757009

6120902,5,B00GWSKWH0,"A great movie -- new perspective, style, approach -- and even humorous! Animal lovers, do not fear anything graphic, because nothing is. This was just a good movie, with common-sense, down-to-earth explanations, touching moments, and honest conclusions. Suitable for everyone (and perhaps especially for those seeking a gentler movie for family members who do not understand their dietary choices). Highly recommended.",1396742400,,418,5.868852459016393

6120904,5,B00GWSKWH0,"This film speaks directly to the person who allows their heart to be guided, at least in part, by their mind. If you require flashy cinematography, A-list celebrities, and escapism to be entertained, this film may not be for you. However, if you are the type of person who derives joy from stepping out of your comfort zone and engaging yourself intellectually with the world in which you actually exist, this film may blow your mind.

The director artfully tackles one of today's most compelling moral issues -- the type that you will have a conversation with your grandchildren about in 40 years and get to tell them on what side of the fence you stood.

It is revolutionary in effect and humble in approach. You will laugh, you will cry, and you will leave a slightly different person than when you walked in.

I highly recommend.",1392940800,14,833,4.653061224489796

The film maker's pretend skepticism about speciesism as an idea, so he can play the strawman for his interviewees, is kitschy and obvious.

8628013,5,B00GWSKWH0,"I have been vegetarian for several months, planning to go vegan once adjusted. This movie tipped the scale. I had planned on eating a bagel and cream cheese for lunch and I had to throw it in the garbage. Now I have no lunch, but I would rather go hungry than eat/use another animal product ever again. I consider myself to be very open minded and progressive. I knew about cases of animal abuse, but I had never considered the concept of speciesism; although as a child a knew in my heart that exploiting and killing animals was wrong. I begged my parents to allow me to become vegetarian for years, but they always told me, ""Animals are not the same as people, they were put here for us."" I guess over time I was inadvertently brainwashed. I am so glad for the re-awakening. Thank you for making this film!",1471910400,11,808,4.3933333333333335
8628014,1,B00GWSKWH0,"Doesn't make any scientific sense. Eating plants is a risky diet attribute of some animals because most plants evolve toxin to combat feeding. Eating meat of those animals is what predatory animals do to avoid the toxin because the pray animals denature the toxin with enzymes. Most plants have some toxin , weak or severe; most animal meat is purely protein and nutrients. Great apes like human are omnivorous and take advantage of both diets.",1471478400,,444,4.933333333333334
