8178703,2,6304395493,"I purchased this movie because I'm a Bolo Yeung fan - imagine my disapointment when the tape wouldn't focus, causing me to spend the entire time wrestling w/my control to get a picture that didn't roll. Also, since the movie was filmed in wide-screen, but the video captured only the center portion of the screen, I was unable to see faces in close-ups, or tell who was speaking - very frustrating, to say the least.
The dubbing was poorly done - I'd much rather have closed-captioning and hear the actors real voices than to hear rediculous accents come out of their mouths! You're likely to hear anything from cockney to hillbilly - come on!!
The only saving grace in this hard-to-follow storyline, caused at least partly I'm sure by the above problems, was Bolo's fight scene w/ Brandon Lee. Next time, I'm going w/DVD...take my advice and do the same...",1062720000,,857,4.72
8178704,3,6304395493,"This movie, stars Dragon Lee (muscle bound BruceLeeimposter),and Bolo Yeung as the bad guy. The Martial Arts in the movie are very good and to some extent have to be to make up for the bad camerawork and thin plot. The plot primarily is about these Japanese guys led by Bolo Yeung who run around throughout the movie trying to kill Dragon Lee and his assorted friends. The camera work in the movie is not done well - and you can see it at different points in the movie,especially the end. Their are points at the end where all you see are parts of the two fighters. If the plot was a little more sound,and the camerawork better I would have gave it a 4 star review.",1033430400,2,665,4.244094488188976
8178705,4,6304395493,"It one of the movies that includes a very rear footages... Had anyone seen a movie that Dragon Lee fights Bolo Yeng... From my knowledge, this is the only one.... The fight was fast and invencible... While Bolo sticks to his triditional style of Kung Fu, Dragon Lee beats him at te end with Jun Fan( Bruce Lee) Philosphy of Jeet Kune Do... The movie is worthed to watch....so do it... If you are a Bruce Lee fan..  :-)",1018396800,,418,4.291139240506329
8178706,5,6304395493,"Before Everything, In Dragon Lee's Mvies that he acted this movie called "" Big Boss 2"", any way, This movie includes a lot of different styles of fighting... Wing Chun,Crane and demonstrations from Bruce Lee's Philosophy of ""Jeet Kune Do"" ...To make the story short...It's a time when the Japenese invaded China, where Dragon Lee is a leader of a rebble group from the south, ran away from bolo, which is the comander on a Japenese crew to fight rabelians....I guess there is couple scenes in this movie about Dragon that are pictured way arlier...
1. When he was walking at the evening alone, got jumped by two lowsy guys that he taught them a lesson.
2. His demonstration of the crane style after the scene of the Japenese have put the banner for the chinese about the food shipment....  and thats for now",1018310400,,807,4.604166666666667
