8752537,3,B01C885MTU,"Peter O'toole and Susannah York give their usual sterling performances but the producers of this DVD are being disingenuous when they leave the R rating on the package. This version could easily be rated PG13. All of Susannah Yorke's nude scenes have been edited out. At 30 years old (when she performed in this film), Ms. York was in her prime and quite attractive. It's a shame that the prudes who edited this feature felt it necessary to butcher the true context of the film.",1518998400,,478,4.635294117647059

8752539,3,B01C885MTU,"This account of an English Lord's descent into madness is terrific as entertainment but somewhat lacking as a film.  A lot can be attributed to Peter O'Toole's performance which begins way over-the-top and pretty much stays that way throughout.  The revelation that his character is bonkers is no real surprise and lets the air out of the narrative.  Susannah York as the sister O'Toole's character loves a little too much is fine but even her performance seems mannered.  A problem of the film is it really doesn't transcend its stage roots which lends  a certain claustrophobic air to the atmosphere.  If you want to see O'Toole assay madness among the nobility check out ""The Ruling Class"" which excels in every area that this film falters.  Regardless, I liked this film though it's not wholly satisfying.",1475712000,2,809,4.948148148148148
8752540,5,B01C885MTU,Very splendid! I am satisfied very much. Thank you!,1468886400,,51,4.777777777777778
8752541,4,B01C885MTU,"Surprisingly, not what I expected, but more.  Both York and O'Toole were great in their character roles.  It's wonderful to see how human beings can make such fools of themselves and make you feel such love for them.  I'm glad I decided to buy this heart wrenching movie.",1467158400,3,271,4.604166666666667
8752542,5,B01C885MTU,Great to be able finally to buy a copy.  I saw it when it first was released as a film and I was bowled over then and and have been again this time round decades later. O'Toole and Miles are wonderful and the  Australian  actor Michael Craig features too and is perfectly cast.,1465948800,3,277,4.188679245283019
