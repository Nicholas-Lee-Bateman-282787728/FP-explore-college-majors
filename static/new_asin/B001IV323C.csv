8311389,1,B001IV323C,"People considering buying this DVD should know two things:

1) This short film can be seen for free (and, I believe, downloaded for free) at archive(dot)org (I am not sure about Amazon's policy regarding outside links) as well as many other short films and public domain feature films.

2) The Rifftrax people, formerly the Mystery Science 3000 crew, covered this film on their DVD collection ""Best of Rifftrax Shorts Volume 2"", which can probably be purchased for about the price of this disc, and includes seven other shorts!

So you can buy this if you want, but I don't know why you would.",1324857600,,593,4.737864077669903
