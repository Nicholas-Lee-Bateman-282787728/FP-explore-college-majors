4710688,5,B005IZ7C9Y,It teaches high school age and even older the meaning of the word predjudice.  It was short enough to have a few minutes to elaborate with the audience before time frame was through.  I love it!,1354320000,,194,4.361111111111111
8475261,5,B005IZ7C9Y,"Very sweet treatment of the racism issue, if you can wrap your head around that. It is really good to show kids. You have to digitalize the CD and copy it in order to play it on a computer, but it will play in a DVD player.",1492992000,,223,3.765957446808511
8475262,5,B005IZ7C9Y,"Definitly worth the buy.

I wasn't sure if I should buy it, cause it's so explensive but it was really nice. I like collecting DVD's (even if I don't have too many^^) and this one is great!

It's especially beautiful cause you can't find it anywhere online.

The story isn't as, I guess cheesy would be the word, as I tought. It's supposed to tell the lesson ""don't hate others cause they're different"" but it's still something new!

For all the whose liine/ Col and Ry fans reading: Ryan is really easy to pick out. Colin isn't... you can see him at the beginning very clearly standing next to Ryan, but other than that I wasn't able to make him out...",1454457600,,653,4.371900826446281
8475263,1,B005IZ7C9Y,"My Cd would not work in any drive I put it in. Not sure if it's the age of the CD or a glitched copy, but it is a steep price for a defected product. If you want to listen to it, the sound worked...Was really excited for it and now it just makes me bitter, and hopeful, thinking I'll come across something it will play in...",1447545600,,324,3.8507462686567164
8475264,5,B005IZ7C9Y,An excellent movie!,1427587200,,19,5.666666666666667
8475265,4,B005IZ7C9Y,"I love this movie. I first saw it at the Vancouver World's Fair in 1986. I have purchased it in both VHS & DVD. Both are decent quality. I'm waiting for an HD version, either Blu-ray or digital. It is streaming on Ustream. This is worth having in your collection.",1425513600,,263,4.28
8475266,5,B005IZ7C9Y,"Although this arrived in a broken case and I was extremely worried about damage to the DVD, it played perfectly.  I had never forgotten seeing this DVD with a clear message, while at the '86 Vancouver Expo.  Over time, I wondered if I'd ever find it again to show to my kids, so, I was so ecstatic to be able to share this with them.  Even though they are 17 year olds who ""know everything"" they really enjoyed this short film which, in my mind, is timeless.  Exceptional.",1393372800,,472,4.329545454545454
8475267,5,B005IZ7C9Y,I love this short. We discovered it at our local library and my children enjoyed it. I have been looking for it so I can share it with my grand kids. I'm so glad I found it here. It is a great and fun short film.,1389052800,,212,3.630434782608696
8475268,5,B005IZ7C9Y,"This 20-minute live action fantasy was made for the Canadian Pacific Pavillion at Vancouver's Expo 86, and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film.  Director/co-writer/producer Bob Rogers has had a 30 year career making mostly short educational and documentary films; this early work remains his best-known in all likelihood.

An allegorical fantasy, something after the manner of Dr. Seuss' ""Butter Battle Book"", about three primary-colored kingdoms separated as islands in the sky that go to war with each other after one young scientific genius in the Yellow kingdom finds a way of traveling to the Red and Blue islands.  It's easy to see why this was nominated for an Oscar, it's hugely entertaining, and it doesn't hit you too hard over the head with it's message that it's better for us all to mix things up and take some ""colors"" from others, than to stay in our own little red, blue, yellow - or Caucasian, African, or Asian - worlds.  Very inventive effects and set design on a very low budget - it reminded me in a sense of some of the better early episodes of ""Doctor Who"", visually.

Timeless.",1381536000,,1132,4.7846153846153845
8475269,2,B005IZ7C9Y,"I could not play this video on any computer DVD drive that I tried.  I finally found a DVD player and it did play on that, but it limits me to watching it only on a TV.  Not satisfied.",1369267200,,184,3.6923076923076925
8475270,5,B005IZ7C9Y,I saw this film in the Canadian Pavilion if the Worlds Fair about 30 years ago.  I was a tough teenager and I really enjoyed the message and the little love story.  Our family now has a yearly friend/family film festival where we create and then show our own short films.  Even the kids get involved and we have a lot of fun.  We started this years festivities with Rainbow Wars and everyone loved it!!,1368748800,,402,4.32
