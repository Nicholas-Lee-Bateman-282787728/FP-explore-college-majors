8503802,5,B006SRHT12,"Unique and haunting story, loosely based on the life of Chris Kraus' own aunt, a well known German poet.  Beautifully cast and filmed in stunning (and quite original) locations, you will not forget this film.  It should have been the German entry for the 2012 Oscars.",1332892800,2,267,4.782608695652174
