7479212,5,B016PGEUSA,"I just finished watching this beautiful work of art. The film takes place in North Carolina and the locations are perfectly suited for a small town thriller. I love the cinematography throughout the film and the acting performances of Isaiah Washington and Lisa Arrindell Anderson were phenomenal.  Make sure you keep watching the film until the end as their is a surprise twist!
Kudos to the production team and director on a job well done.",1454457600,5,441,4.88

Seems like she plays more like the victim than someone with a gift.",1519603200,,280,3.9298245614035086
