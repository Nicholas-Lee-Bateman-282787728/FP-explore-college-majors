7915598,4,B00002AMF8,"I was looking for a fish tank video that I had rented a few years ago for a Hawaiian themed party I was giving.  This one is similar, with fish swimming in a tank but I plan to mute the sound when I use it because the music is an odd mix of unfamiliar piano tunes and some familiar songs that don't add anything to the video.  If you are purchasing it for adult relaxation, it's nice to look at but I found the background music distracting.  However, if you plan to use it to calm small children, I think it would work fine.",1109462400,,524,4.019230769230769

We leave on in the background on our large screen

TV and every guest wants one. Perfect clarity and

colors. Good variety of fish. Not an endless loop of

just a few minutes like others I've seen. Highly recomend.",1102377600,4,263,4.416666666666667
