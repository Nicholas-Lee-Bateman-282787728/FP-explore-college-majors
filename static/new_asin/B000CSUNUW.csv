Special footnote, actor John Wayne once said, ""Every country in the world loved the folklore of the West - the music, the dress, the excitement, everything that was associated with the opening of a new territory. It took everybody out of their own little world - The cowboy lasted a hundred years, created more songs and prose and poetry than any other folk figure - The closest thing was the Japanese samurai. Now, I wonder who'll continue it...His performance as Ethan Edwards in ""The Searchers"" (1956) is ranked #23 on Premiere Magazine's 100 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time...Of his many film roles, his personal favorite was that of Ethan Edwards from The Searchers (1956). Wayne even went so far as to name his son Ethan after that character...The inscription on the Congressional Gold Medal awarded to him in 1979 reads, simply, ""John Wayne, American.""...After meeting the late Superman star Christopher Reeve at the 1979 Academy Awards, Wayne turned to Cary Grant and said ""This is our new man. He's taking over.""...Turned down the role of Marshal Dillon on ""Gunsmoke"" (1955) because he did not want to commit to a weekly TV series. He recommended his friend James Arness for the role, and gave the on camera introduction in the pilot episode...I would like to be remembered, well...the Mexicans have a phrase, 'Feo fuerte y formal'. Which means; he was ugly, strong and had dignity.""

8102101,3,B000CSUNUW,"Stagecoach, 1939 film

The film opens on a road in the southwest. Two riders gallop into an Army post. The Apaches are on the warpath, led by Geronimo. [No reason given.] The coach stops to change their six horses. The conversation introduces the characters. ""What's good for the banks is good for the country."" [Does the banker resemble President Harding?] Dallas is driven out of town by the good women to avoid a calamity. Doc Boone hasn't done well. Cavalry escorts the stagecoach to guard against attack. The banker hops aboard. Johnny Ringo hitches a ride. They proceed through Monument Valley. Shall they continue without a cavalry escort? They take a vote. ""What difference does it make?"" Seating at the table shows their status.

The banker spouts political slogans that are still relevant (and wrong) today. They take a detour north for safety and learn bad news. Mrs. Mallory faints and needs medical attention. ""It's a baby!"" Ringo must carry on the family feud. We learn more about the people and their concerns. [Too sentimental?] Smoke on the mountain sends a signal. The stress affects the people. The next stop reveals a burned house and ferry. They get across the stream and continue. An arrow announces the Apache attack, the chase begins. [That wasn't much of an ambush! Would the clever Apaches attack in the open?] Will the cavalry arrive in the nick of time? The survivors arrive in town. ""Johnny Ringo is in town."" Luke's hand had aces and eights. The telegraph was repaired and the Sheriff greets banker Gatewood.

Ringo is given his ten minutes. The men in the bar await the news. Three men look for Ringo in the dark. Shots are heard, a woman screams. Ringo returns to the Marshal, and meets Dallas again. There is a surprise for a happy ending. The film reflects the culture of that era and hasn't aged bacly. Ringo had knocked around enough to know what Dallas was and wouldn't care anyway. [Too sentimental?]

Ernest Haycox wrote many popular Western novels, some adapted to films. This is a story of clichs about a group of people who are thrown together, face a peril, and live through it. How did it compare to the other western movies from that era? Few have survived to be placed on tape or disc. Was it more censored in some respects and less in others? I wonder if remakes of this movie will drop the banker and pregnant wife due to cultural changes. John Wayne played in many westerns before this film.",1513036800,,2440,4.707259953161593

Interesting to watch a vey young John Wayne learning his craft.  I bought them because I collect John Wayne movies. A must for other collectors.",1373587200,,318,4.3
8102106,5,B000CSUNUW,"In the early 1930's, before securing fame as Hollywood's foremost action hero, John Wayne cut his teeth in the business by playing romantic second leads opposite some of the era's most popular actresses, as well as starring in a long string of quickie westerns. Also during this time, Wayne made three 12 chapter serials for Mascot Pictures, a low budget studio founded by producer Nat Levine. None were westerns, but they did showcase Wayne's trademark easy going style and his knack at handling action oriented material even at this early stage in his career.

In SHADOW OF THE EAGLE (1932), the Duke is a stunt flier at a carnival determined to reveal the identity of ""The Eagle"", a mysterious villain who is blackmailing the directors of an airplane factory over a stolen invention.

THE HURRICANE EXPRESS (1932) concerns a saboteur who calls himself ""The Wrecker"" and his schemes to put the L & R Railroad out of business. Airline pilot Wayne, whose engineer father was killed in an accident caused by ""The Wrecker"", swears to bring the criminal to justice.

THE THREE MUSKETEERS (1933) features Wayne as one of a trio of Foreign Legion pilots who must quell an Arab uprising led by the evil ""El Shaitan"".

The fact that Mascot was a Poverty Row outfit whose production budgets were restricted meant that they didn't employ expensive special effects or process photography. An exception is SHADOW OF THE EAGLE, which includes some animated footage of sky writing courtesy of the Disney studios. Mostly though, the action sequences involved real situations shot on location, many of which required the young, athletic Wayne to perform his own stunts. To further cut costs, retakes were kept at a bare minimum which meant the first take often got printed. This economical approach adds a spontaneity and a gritty authenticity which greatly enhances the entertainment value of these serials. The extensive location photography shows us how much of the Hollywood area was still rural in the early '30's. Contrary to the widely held opinion that Wayne's acting left much to be desired during his novice years, the actor already reveals an engagingly sincere and unaffected style in these cliffhangers that would endear him to moviegoers for decades to come.

All three complete serials are available from Passport Video, which offers the best quality on these public domain titles that I've ever come across. For extras, we get the original trailers and a 25 minute retrospective of the Duke's career.

This DVD collection is an absolute must have for John Wayne and serial fans alike, and gives us a good look at a still relatively underrated actor during his ""bread and butter"" days.

Highly recommended.",1357257600,,2706,5.013363028953229
