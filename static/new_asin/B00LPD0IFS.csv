8667571,3,B00LPD0IFS,"''The Last Sentence'' (original title in Swedish- ''Dom ver dd man'') is the story of Torgny Segerstedt, a Swedish journalist whose fierce anti-nazi articles became a matter of great concern within the country's political life and stirred major backlash both in Germany and Sweden. The movie begins with Adolph Hitler's rise to absolute power in Germany in mid-1930s and follows the growing aggressiveness and hate-speech of the Third Reich until the ending of the Second World War, examining the influence and effect that the threat of a possible German invasion had on the decision-making of Sweden's government. The film focuses on the much-debated neutrality of Sweden and Segerstedt's bold critique on the inactivity of Swedish politicians even when Nazis invaded the neighboring Scandinavian countries. The basic flaw of ''The Last Sentence'' is that it follows an uneven rhythm and as a result, the movie can be divided into two parts, the first being tedious, almost annoying, while the second picks up speed and leads to an emotionally touching climax. The director, Jan Troell, is one of Sweden's greatest auteurs and each one of his films is characterized by its high-quality standards as well as magnificent performances. In this one, I think that Jesper Christensen's performance deserves to be in the spotlight but the whole of the cast does a tremendous job as well. My rating would be closer to 3,5/5.",1529712000,,1417,5.165217391304348

8667573,5,B00LPD0IFS,"If you're looking for action, suspense, blood and guts...steer clear of this film.  This is not a fluffy Hollywood movie. This is a ""film""...quite a difference.  And if you are intelligent, patient, and have a yen for truth and history, you will treat yourself to an artistic experience to savor indeed.  Impeccable acting...rather like being there.  Haunting and beautiful musical score.  Very wise choice to keep the film in black and white.  And of course, direction by one of the greatest.  Ranking with Dreyer, DeSica, and Bergman etc...Bravo to Mr. Troell who truly improves with age.  Criterion missed out on this one, sadly, because it deserves the best presentation.  However it is subtitled in English with a wonderful behind the scenes look narrated by the daughter of Jan Troell.  Experience greatness that truly shames most American ""movies"".  I've had the dvd for about 10 days and have seen it 4 times and expect to continue absorbing.  And as for the 2 or 3 star ratings...churlish beyond syntax!",1461110400,4,1012,4.994011976047904
8667574,3,B00LPD0IFS,"""The Last Sentence"" chronicles the path taken by a difficult man in a hellish historical era.  While vividly portraying the many personal failings of a journalist and editor, the film depicts his heroism in standing up to not only the mass murderers themselves, but to those who would arrange accommodations ostensibly for the greater good.  Moral nuance is infrequently the subject of movie makers, but this film is the rare exception, and as such deserves a far wider audience than it has reached to date.",1427587200,2,507,4.952941176470588
