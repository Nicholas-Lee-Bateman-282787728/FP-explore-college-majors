This story has a good plot that is entertaining and educational. The story about a bank failure must have resonated with the audiences of 1933. [There were no bank failures in Canada or Britain as the Central Bank supported local banks.] It would be many decades before wealthy crooks would loot Savings & Loan or investment banks, as shown in this movie. The Production Code of 1934 would ban ""saloon girls"" and censor the dialogue in movies.
""It's a Wonderful Life"" explained the economics of banking to the audience. Money is sterile, it doesn't increase unless it is invested in production (seed for crops, cattle, manufacturing, etc.). That is the reason for the ancient ban against usury, but not against a share in an enterprise.",1281830400,,3297,4.526845637583893
