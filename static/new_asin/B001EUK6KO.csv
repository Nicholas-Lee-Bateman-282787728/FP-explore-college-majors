8299522,3,B001EUK6KO,"The basic elements of ""Black Fist"" are really good. but the film is let down by the low budget and poor filmmaking.

Leroy Fisk is determined to fight his way out of the ghetto. Joining up with the local mob-run street fighting circuit, it's not long before Fisk is making lots of money and being able provide a better life for his family. But when Fisk wants to leave it all behind, the mob along with a crooked cop set out to stop him.

The acting is a notch above the usual fare, and the story is really solid,  but the directing, editing, score, sound mix and almost every other aspect of the movie are awful. It's a shame too, because this could've been a great movie with a skilled crew behind the lens.",1463961600,,709,4.276119402985074

8299525,3,B001EUK6KO,"The movie would probably be pretty good, but I couldn't finish watching it because of the horrible job that the DVD publisher did. At first, the DVD put up a couple of copyright notices, even though the movie is supposedly in the public domain. And then there were no extra features. Fair enough. And then I was surprised to find out that the movie was in full screen, but that's on me, because I can see on Amazon that it says full screen. But here's the one that really surprised me: They silenced the foul language on a DVD for this blaxploitation classic. Why would anybody decide to put out a DVD of an old exploitation movie only to censor the language? This isn't commercial television. I was only going to give this DVD one star, but I'm giving the movie the benefit of the doubt, and I'm letting those two numbers balance each other out. That's why I'm giving this DVD a 3 star review.",1437609600,,894,4.391566265060241

8299529,2,B001EUK6KO,"1974 blaxplotation movie had a decent plot of a L.A. street fighter from the slums with dreams of making it big as a champion boxer works for gangsters to make ends meet. The film transfer here is awful,so awful in fact that at times hurt my eyes to look at. I picked this up for a dollar at a dollar store along with Black Terminator. One dollar is exactly what you should keep your budget at when buying anything that comes in slim cases.",1225670400,3,440,4.25
