I of course also blame UPS this never happened before and the driver never bothered to say anything he just handed it to my relative who answered the door,1489017600,,538,3.944954128440367

3590344,3,B001G0MFFG,"Drawn Together is one of my favorite animated tv series. This dvd box includes all of the episodes, and the extras are fun. The board game is funny indeed. The main problem is that there are no subtitles at all, not even english cc, and the definition seems pretty low, something like 420p. i was expecting something more HD",1466294400,,324,4.508474576271187

I should have just saved my money because the series doesn't get better! It seems they stopped trying shortly after i stopped watching! Stick to season 1 & 2,and skip the rest! That's just my opinion!!",1395619200,,337,4.365079365079365

3590528,4,B001G0MFFG,"For 20 bucks, It's worth buying just to get the 3 seasons of the show uncensored on DVD.

The board game however is another issue altogether. It's simple card-board from the game board itself to the characters and even the die. I mean really, They can't afford to give us a single dice when I could go buy a pack of them for a dollar. Also, It can be rather boring to play when playing with people unfamiliar with the show. So more than likely the board game will collect dust in a zip-lock bag for a very long time.

Still, 20 bucks is still a pretty solid asking price for the complete series and I don't regret my purchase one bit.",1393891200,,634,4.188524590163935

I'm into season 2 now, and I gotta say... if I could own this series, I SOOO would. It's crazy! I love it! It's just the right amount of cringe-worthy weirdness that makes a series like this good.

Its  basically a cartoon version of MTVs The Real World including alternate characters of Jossie and Pussycats, Superman, a Disney Princess, a wacky Looney Toones character, an Internet Sex Pig, Link from the Legend of Zelda, Pikachu from Pokmon, and Betty Boop. Linke their Entertainment Weekly episode implies, you have to be in their target audience in order to enjoy it. The same viewers who enjoy shown like Family Guy, Robo Chicken, and South Park will love this series. My other friends never even heard of it and now they cant stop watching it.

Now, if anyone is easily offended, this is NOT for you because this series finds ways of insulting EVERYONE!  For the rest of us, there were subjects that honestly left me breathless and the way they were solved were a combination of funny and horrifying.

The accompanying board game and instructions for the drinking game will have anyone passed out long before the first fade out. I can say with a hand over my heart that not since ""South Park"" has a cartoon left me at times shocked at what was being shown.

3590636,5,B001G0MFFG,"In the rise of popularity of adult orientated cartoons like South Park, the hunt was on to find more shows like it in the attempt that someone would hit gold and out-do Trey and Matt. Even The Simspons attempted some more adult orientated shows there for a while. But not all of them succeeded, instead they just found small cult followings. But Drawn Together hit the nail on the head right away. With Big Brother being a current pop-culture hit, it was only a matter of time before someone made fun of it. That's where Drawn Together brought in a house of different contestants in this whacky and outrageous reality-TV show parody.

The main characters of the show are a Super-Man-like man named Captain Hero, who not only is not all that courageous at times and is also battling his own Sexuality. He likes to use his super-powers of being able to fly and have laser vision, as well as try and hump everything on two legs, whether they work or not.

Then there is Clara who is a Disney-Like princess, who has been a little sheltered in her posh royal upbringing, and doesn't seem to always know how to be politically correct all the time. She also has her quirks and a few surprises up her...umm... dress.

Then there is Toot. Who is a Betty-Boop-like woman, who has seen her best days gone a way a long time ago. She is a gross overweight pig who, like Captain Hero, also doesn't like to hold back her hormones at times.

Xander is a queer Zelda-like video game character who in the beginning is always saying he is on a never ending quest to save his girlfriend, only to discover his true sexuality. He also has many lives and dies quite a few times in the show, but not quite a rip off of Kenny tho.

Spanky Ham is a favorite character. He is one of those toons that showed up online in spam adverts. He is a rough, sleazy, horny little pig who... yeah, I guess they all pretty much have that quirk.

Ling Ling is a Pokemon-like thing who doesn't speak English, least not well. Mostly when he speaks it is subtitled. He is kinda cute, and always either getting sad or angry and wanting to do battle with someone.

Foxxy Love is a Josie and The Pussy Cats kind of thing. Sometimes she also reminds me of someone who never was, but should have been in Scooby Doo. She is a strong opinionated black woman, and she will open a can of whoopie on your butt if you mess with her. She also likes to party and make out with Clara from time to time.

And finally there is Wooldart. An annoying Sponge-Bob-like character who is the looniest of them all. Not too bright at times, but always does something stupid enough to make the viewers laugh.

Taking all of these characters and combining them into the same house, it makes a hilarious combination of misfit cartoons of different types to come together and see how they would get along. Each episode is often nothing like the last one, sometimes it might be the house game show, sometimes it might just consist of them doing their own things, or finding trouble, love, hate etc...

In the DVD package you get seasons 1, 2 & 3 as well as the movie. Unfortunately my Australian release of this did not come with the game board, but I don't mind, I probably never would have played it anyway. The DVD's do have extra features such as ""making-ofs"", ""interviews"", ""audio commentaries"" and a few other things. Note: there is no closed captions/subtitles.",1322697600,13,3396,4.462903225806452
3590637,3,B001G0MFFG,"Okay I recently watched this whole series on Netflix It centers around 8 cartoon characters Captain hero , Xandir , Toot , Princess Clara , Foxxy love , Ling - LIng , Spanky ham , and wooldoor All which are parodies of actual famous cartoon / video game characters ( Super man , Link from the legend of zelda , Betty Boop , Belle, Valerie brown , Pika chu , The evil piggies , and spongebob ) all living in a house together as part of a reality TV show . While the basic plot line of the  of the show is interesting it fails to deliver anything it hasn't already done . Every joke is just the same one over and over with a little gruesome violence thrown in . The jokes don't seem to be written to make the viewer laugh but to shock and disgust them . Along with that the show is only 30 episodes long and gives on of the most pathetic and disapointing finales I have ever seen in a show .",1304726400,,889,3.99438202247191

The pack is ok and the extras are good. The game is soooo extra. but i think is okay

Only thing is the need of close caption for subtitles... why don't they made normal DVD subtitles???",1299110400,,285,4.071428571428571
3590670,5,B001G0MFFG,"Got this for Christmas ""for my husband."" Yeah, right. Fact is, it was as much for me as for him. We save it to watch just before bed on only the worst, most stressful days, because it's so incredibly hilarious and utterly vicious. This show gleefully shatters taboos you hadn't even realized existed.

Let me say right here that I don't think offensiveness is funny just because it's offensive. That's lazy humor, and it's boring. This humor is funny because it's brilliantly well written, it offers a joke about every 15 seconds, it's character-driven, and the comedy springs from its premise: A parody of the kinds of ""reality show"" that put dysfunctional people together in the same living quarters and watch them fight, act out, and drive each other crazy. I hate those kinds of shows, but I love Drawn Together. Unlike those reality shows, it somehow retains its humanity and even some sense of compassion for the insane characters.

Go figure. It wallows in the worst and, by mercilessly mocking it, somehow makes me feel good. I'm so sorry they cancelled this brilliant thing. Oh, Drawn Together, this world was never meant for one so... *sniff*... beautiful as you.",1298160000,58,1173,4.86

3590672,5,B001G0MFFG,"I'm disappointed.

The talent and writing of this animated series went away while coming into it's peak. ""Drawn Together"" has the vocal talent of ""The Simpsons', The writing of ""Family Guy"" and the political incorrectness of ""South Park"". It's the perfect blend!

One of the best series I have ever bought. My only regret, is that there isn't more seasons to buy!",1284336000,,363,4.838709677419355
3590673,5,B001G0MFFG,"This DVD set is the best EVER! I bought all 3 seasons about a year ago and I loved them so much that they all got ruined in my constant viewing. I had some reservations about buying this set because i wasn't sure if it was EVERY episode or if it had all the original dvd extras, BUT IT DOES!. This set is not only all 3 COMPLETE seasons, but it includes a board game, multiple drinking games and all the extra commentary and extras that my original dvds had! it is the best if you love Drawn Together, but also a great set if you have only seen a few episodes and liked it! it is SUPER cheap for the amount of activities and episodes you get! If you cant tell, I have utilized one the drinking games right now (one of many) from the discs, and it rocks! This set plus the two movies completes everything you will ever need from Drawn Together. BUY THIS DVD SET! IT IS THE BEST!",1283212800,28,877,4.07514450867052
3590674,5,B001G0MFFG,"We loved the ""Party in your box."" The dvd's are hilarious, and the games that go along with it, especially the drinking game, are very fun. Would definitely recommend it to others.",1276560000,,180,4.65625
3590675,4,B001G0MFFG,"The show is about a ""Cartoon Reality Show"". Various character archetypes from reality shows e.g. Captain Hero (the Superman character), the Princess (the Disney Princess character) and misc cartoons live together in a house. Outlandish hijinks ensue that often poke fun at real-life stereotypes (e.g. Ling-Ling, the ""pikachu"" character speaks ""Engrish"") and cartoon cliches (i.e. Captain Hero reads his own origin story). And of course, as mentioned raunchy hijinks necessarily ensue.

This is a low-brow (no political or social commentary like South Park), but funny show with lots of scatological humor, pop culture references, and a ridiculously over-the top nature. If you like over the top slapstick and scatological humor, you'll like this show.

If you're in college, the board game set included is also pretty nice, and the special features include a ""milk"" drinking game. If I was 10 years younger, I'd probably think it was amazing.

Recommended if you like Tripping the Rift (the humor is fairly similar) or South Park.

*Just a warning - if you're easily offended don't watch this show. It makes South Park look like Barney the Purple Dinosaur by comparison. It really is probably the most offensive thing I've ever seen on TV. At some point, every human being will be offended by something on it.

It kind of reminds me of Fritz the Cat, except funnier. They explore every possible stereotype regarding race, religion, and orientation humanly possible. There are also plenty of graphic discussions and depictions of sex and nudity. This show is the kind of thing that would give the PMRC nightmares. I'd watch an episode on comedy central's website before purchasing. This show is really, really offensive and the DVD is uncensored which is much more offensive.",1270425600,26,1774,5.145833333333333
3590676,5,B001G0MFFG,"Reality TV has pretty much taken over the airwaves so it is time to bite back with Drawn Together. This is an animated reality show putting 8 different cartoon characters in a house and seeing what happens. What happens you ask? It can all be summed up in one word...<CENSORED>.

I would love to tell you what this show is all about, but I have a feeling that it won't be able to get published on this site. What I can tell you is this is the show that reality tv fans will love and reality tv haters will love even more! This show pretty much crosses the line on everything that is good and pure in this world. It is rauncher than Jackass, grosser that Fear Factor, goofier than Flavor of Love and pretty much more amazing than anything you will ever see on television. Each joke makes you laugh until your sides hurt, the uncensored verson on these dvds will shock you so much your jaw will drop all the way down to the Earths core. The pop culture references of television, reality television and various animation companies will make laugh so hard you will do things I can't even say on this web site. What I can say is this is a must see show for anyone from super avengelical to devil worshipers. Get all three seasons in all their gut busting and gut wrenching glory, beleive me it is so worth it! On that note so will the movie!
