1425618,1,B00005EBSD,"This is one of the worst movies I had the misfortune to pay for. The idea behind the movie is good but there are stupid songs through out, very slow, the female lead is completely unbelievable, and the second half of the movie makes no sense. They should take this off Amazon.",1394409600,,276,4.326923076923077
1425619,4,B00005EBSD,The characters were believable. The story was believable and moved along. I enjoy escape/survival stories. When the soldiers stopped and broke out their home made instruments and sang essentially the same song during the movie it was kind of comical. I did not get the gist of the song or what it had to do with the movie.,1375574400,2,322,4.568965517241379
1425620,1,B00005EBSD,I could not finish this one.  The situations the troop ran into were just plain silly.  I do not recommend.,1374019200,2,107,4.3
1425621,5,B00005EBSD,"This one of my favorite art videos. My friends, during their return visits, often ask to replay this video. Being a self-declared artist,I never tire of watching this again and again.  There is so much to benefit from this video, whether for art, history or the enjoyment of the journey.",1045872000,6,287,4.74

7938177,2,B00005EBSD,"Overall I would recommend you pass on this one.  La France is a very disjointed story that just drags on for most of the time.  When it doesnt drag on it goes completely off rails with either musical numbers that just don't fit with the overall feel of the film, or by challenging your suspension of disbelief.  The acting is flat and although the overall story idea is good, it is poorly executed here.  With that being said, there are a few bright spots in the film.  The real mission of the Lieutenant made for an interesting twist, and although the musical numbers were badly out of place, the songs were pretty catchy.  But at the end of the day, I think it would be best to avoid this one.",1428192000,,695,4.3076923076923075
7938178,1,B00005EBSD,"This really is the worst movie I've ever seen. How did that lady become an actress? She simply doesn't or just plainly can't act. She keeps the same facial expression throughout the wholeovie regardless of the situation. She just lies in bed like a statue while her husband is making love to her. Director, dialogue, actors all horrible; and those hideous songs...",1409961600,,364,4.887096774193548
7938179,1,B00005EBSD,"This movie is atrocious, indulgent French cinema at its worst. For a movie about a woman desperately seeking her lost love during the greatest war, this movie is remarkably soulless. No background is given to express her motivation. Plus, the battalion she joins seems to be wandering around aimlessly, like the movie. And the musical scenes are just dreadful. They come out of nowhere, they totally break character (where the hell do these guys just find these instruments?), they are totally from the wrong era, and they are just plain sucky songs. I had to fast forward through the first song it was so hard to watch, and I bailed entirely during the second song. So I don't really know how the movie ends. Oh well, tant pis pour moi. PS--I love French movies and WWI, so if I don't like this movie, who the hell will?",1404691200,4,821,4.591836734693878
7938180,5,B00005EBSD,"Takes place in WWI. A concerned and frightened wife of a French soldier decides she must look for him herself. Her house is not far from the Front, it turns out. She dresses like a boy and is able to fool a contingent of French soldiers to let her (him in their eyes), tag along. I will not give up the surprises as things develop, I thought it was a very thoughtful story and nothing like I'd ever seen before. I am ""discovering"" French films and this one is exceptionally good. You don't expect it, but amidst the setting of World War, the theme turns from the drama of the story, to beautiful singing and playing by a band of 5 or 6 of the soldiers. This is totally unexpected. It expresses a beautiful side of humanity, that these soldiers are tryingt to hang onto. They break out in song, with instruments, several times. I found it a nice touch. I don't think I'd ever see that in an American movie. It does fantasize the story a bit, but isn't it all mad? War, the wife looking for her husband, the soldiers trying to survive with their humanity somewhat intact. And all the woman wants is her husband back. But will the war have changed him? Will he ever really be back, if he is still alive?",1403654400,2,1200,4.290748898678414
7938181,4,B00005EBSD,"A war movie wihout much war.  The few musical scenes make it a sretch to call it a musical. A love story with out much love. however, it is interesting.",1401667200,,152,4.066666666666666
