8128750,3,B000G1TQ76,"Yeah, this DVD is not professionally done. If you leaned hot stones massage techniques in Massage School it probably isn't what you are looking for. But I went to Massage School during an earlier time before hot stones. When they became the rage I took a class. It was pretty basic and I just bought this for review and to gather some new ideas. I didn't pay much for it, but frankly I've bought a lot of massage DVD's that were professionally done, slick packaging, etc and the content wasn't really for massage therapists either. There is a soft spot in my heart for Massage Nerd. He's not holding himself out as an expect, he's just a massage therapist trying to illustrate what other massage therapists can do. Every therapist should really develop their own style.",1400716800,2,769,4.661764705882353
8128751,5,B000G1TQ76,This is one of many DVD's I've purchased from Massage Nerd and again he has exceeded my expectations!  This is a great video with lots of techniques.  I've been able to incorporate many of them in my practice.  Very thorough!,1192579200,,225,4.575
8128752,1,B000G1TQ76,"I am a massage therapist.  This is just a terrible attempt at an instructional DVD.  I don't even know where to start.  It would have been okay that it looks like it was poorly shot and edited with a bad home video camera IF it contained any useful or good content.  But, it didn't.  The guy looks like a deer in headlights, very nervous and unorganized in his thoughts and actions, and he mumbles a lot.  It's like he's just thinking of things one might be able to do with a hot stone and then he repeats it.  Like...you can take a hot stone from the ankle up the leg and back and down the arm?  Really?  Wow! Come on... That is a basic moved that should have been learned in any good massage school.  Of course you could put a hot stone in your hand and do the same move...  I just can't believe I bought this terrible DVD.  If you have any massage education at all, don't waste your money.  I know you can deduct it on your taxes but buy something else that has a chance of being useful.  If you don't have any massage education, you probably wouldn't be interested in hot stones anyway.  Just don't buy it...I'm sure you'll be as disappointed as I am.  It was only $25 BUT it had the potential to be good...it just wasn't...that guy should be embarrassed to have put out such a terrible piece of work.  Sadly I ordered the stretching dvd too, I'm hoping he redeems himself.",1184544000,9,1377,4.234615384615385
8128753,4,B000G1TQ76,"The studio used to create this video is very basic and the presentation will not win any awards, but it delivers the claim, 100+ massage chair techniques. There are brief explanations of setup, takedown and some business tips. The remainder of the video demonstrates various techniques for chair massage. The individual who demonstrates and narrates the techniques is very informative.

I am a massage therapy student who has yet to take the chair classes. I just bought a massage chair; this video offers enough to give me the head start I hoped for.  I believe the price to purchase this DVD was very fair.",1180137600,3,608,4.836538461538462
8128754,2,B000G1TQ76,"I'm a massage therapist and a former teacher. I have a difficult time enjoying either dvd because there are too many ""ummm's"" and very few benefits of the shown proceedures are discussed. He's very intelligent and gives a wealth of knowledge if you are able to follow his thought process. Definitely not a professionally made dvd or a professional instructor. This should have been a buy one get one free deal.",1175126400,,410,4.788732394366197
8128755,5,B000G1TQ76,"I'm a Massage Therapist, I find the video very useful.",1173657600,,54,4.5
8128756,5,B000G1TQ76,"I couldn't believe how many techniques were in this video. I've tried some of them out and it has helped me give deeper pressure, without using so much strength. I've paid double the amount in the past for similar videos, but I only received half the amount of information from them. It is a great buy!",1168473600,3,302,4.410714285714286
8128757,2,B000G1TQ76,"The lighting in this video isn't very professional. He will be talking & you can't see the image because the camera is on the wrong side of the body. I also found the model to be highly unprofessional, she had a tattoo that I found distracting.  Sometimes the vocal level was recorded low, there were times I couldn't understand what he was saying.",1168387200,3,348,4.523809523809524
