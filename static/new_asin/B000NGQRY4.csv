8177583,3,B000NGQRY4,"first off pat marvenko is an awesome artist. many have used her illustrations to inhance their own interpretaion of revelation on tv shows and books. i have wanted to get this dvd for a long time, but could not find it. i was going to get the vhs, but thought the dvd would be better. i ordered the dvd from pat website. revelation illustrated. it is only 24.99 + shipping and handling.

cons
1.) even though this is on dvd, it was transfered from vhs. it is not crystal clear as you would expect a dvd to be. i also ordered a screen saver of all of the artwork on this dvd, and it is crystal clear on my computer. the dvd looks like a faded copy of the artwork. it is a shame because all of the colors jump out on the screen saver and lets you appreciate pats art work.
2.) the sound recording was not professionaly done. the music and sound effects come in loud in some areas and distorts the sound, it is almost overpowering.
3.) i was expecting at least an hour long dvd, reading from revelation verse to verse. what you get is maybe 2-3 chapters in a row, then a paraphrase of 1-2 chapters. the dvd itself about revelation is appr. 47 minutes long. there is an interview with pat marvenko for about 15 minutes, that does push the dvd to a total of around 1 hour. this interview shakes in certain spots and the cuts and fades are not professional.

pros
1.) pats artwork, is world class
2.) most of revelation is read on the dvd
3.) this is a great way to visualize certain main points of revelation.

my recommendation
1.) buy this dvd or buy the vhs. or go in with a friend or church to ofset expenses
2.) by the screen saver, it does hav music with it, but no narration.
3.) by the power points, not sure if there is any music
4.) if you do 2 or 3 above, buy the word of promise, with the book of revelation  narrated by lou gosset jr, and play behind the screen saver and power point.
5.) buy the artwork from pat marvenko on her website. you get 35 prints for 70 bucks, but you get to enjoy the full beauty of the artwork.

i wanted to write something because i though i would of liked it better than it turned out. the music by the choir and orchestra are excellent.

8177584,5,B000NGQRY4,"Hello.  I talked with Pat Marvenko Smith a while back on the phone.  I found out she has this DVD on her website.  I would list it here but it costs too much money for you to buy from me when you can buy from her.  It costs $24.95 for the DVD on her website.  Well worth having.  It is the best Artwork on the book of Revelation anywhere.  Again her website is [...]
