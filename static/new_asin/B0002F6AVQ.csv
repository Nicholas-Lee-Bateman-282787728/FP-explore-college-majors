2088959,3,B0002F6AVQ,"It is a cute, family-friendly movie, but it strays significantly from the original short-story by O. Henry.  It looses the character of the classic story. It's okay as long as your are not expecting O. Henry's story.",1226275200,,216,4.837837837837838
2088960,5,B0002F6AVQ,"This is a wonderful movie. It has been a favorite for years. I homeschool my grandchildren and we read the story by O'Henry. The children loved the movie and watched it more than once. Compared to the original story, the movie adds a lot more and changes the ending. It is still a movie that is great for the whole family to watch.",1225584000,,331,4.26984126984127
2088961,5,B0002F6AVQ,"Several years ago, I was away on business.  Sitting in my hotel room, I was clicking through the channels when I rested on this Disney Made-For-TV movie, which was just starting.  I enjoyed it so much that I called my husband, who was home with the kids two hours earlier than where I was (CA versus the midwest), and asked him to tape it for me, suggesting he and the kids would enjoy it in the meanwhile.

I am happy that ""The Ransom of Red Chief""  finally came out on DVD and I can toss the recorded VHS. This is ""standard"" family entertainment, Disney style, and I enjoy the silliness. I agree with previous reviewers that it is reminiscent of ""The Apple Dumpling Gang"" movies, because the ""bad guys"" are inept and comical and usually steal the show.  If you can watch, without laughing, the parts where the sidekick is trying to shake a spider off his forehead, or where the town magnate is trying to figure out just what animal the cook has prepared for his dinner, well, you just don't have enough kid left in you!

Happy Reader",1216944000,4,1035,4.421052631578948
2088962,4,B0002F6AVQ,"This movie is a western, slap-stick comedy.  It is appropriate for elementary age children and older.  Some young elementary children will not understand all of the humor but they will enjoy the silliness.  Parents will enjoy this movie because there is no bad language or sexually suggestive scenes.  It is family friendly and may become a family favorite.",1200528000,,357,5.103448275862069
2088963,5,B0002F6AVQ,I love this movie. I laughed so hard when I saw it. I admit it is very stupid but that only makes it more fun. There is no real deep story line and all of the charecters are dumb and dumber. All in all it is just pure good intertainment. Fun for the whole family.,1193961600,10,263,3.8

2088965,4,B0002F6AVQ,"This is a good movie.  It does have several slow parts, but it is worth watching.  Christopher Lloyd and Michael Jeter play characters similar to Don Knotts and Tim Conway in the Apple Dumpling Gang.  The scene in the mine where Old Hank has just had the spider knocked off his head is as funny as anything I have ever seen.",1124841600,9,324,4.278688524590164
2088966,3,B0002F6AVQ,"Comedy suitable for the whole family, but unfortunately not too funny.  Supposedly based on a story by O. Henry, this was apparently made for TV and later remarketed on DVD to exploit the young Osment's new fame after he starred in Sixth Sense.  It takes place in the old west, when Christopher LLoyd (Taxi, Back To The Future) and Michael Jeter think they can make a fast fifty by kidnapping the banker's son (Osment).  But the banker doesn't believe them. Meanwhile the kid's having a grand old time playing with his kidnappers. Kind of like Disney's No Deposit, No Return; not as funny.",1120867200,11,589,4.699029126213592

2089038,4,B0002F6AVQ,"This was a great story.  The reason for giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because the cover art is misleading.  I have been searching for quite a while for the DVD version of this movie that starred Jack Elam and the young child, Pat Peterson (he also played Michelle Lee's youngest son on Knots Landing).  Pat Peterson appears on the cover of the box, as advertised, however, when the DVD is played, the young boy and his abductor (originally played by Jack Elam) are two completely different actors.  I'm keeping this DVD, since, as I stated earlier, it is a cute movie, but I felt the cover art was a misrepresentation of the product.",1426550400,4,634,4.48695652173913

2089068,1,B0002F6AVQ,"I ordered this movie without reading any of the reviews, because I love movies with kids in them, and I especially like Haley Joel Osment's early movies.  I also enjoy a good comedy.  But to me, this movie was pure stupid slapstick with some really bad acting.  Haley did a respectable job of playing the role of a spoiled little rich kid whose parents give him everything but what he needs most, a little quality time with them.  So, in order to get the attention he needs, he acts out in the worst ways.  I can see where young children might like this movie, but I will be donating my DVD to a local charity.",1409529600,,610,4.269565217391304

I ordered it, and it arrived in a flash. Was I ever disappointed!  It never followed the book, not even loosely.  The hilarious scenes the book described that happened in the cave was completely cut out.  Even some of the names were different.

2089104,4,B0002F6AVQ,"Haley Joel Osman hits the mark as Red Chief.  I only wish that the screen writer had allowed the connection with the outlaws to expand. Some of the liberities taken in the script force the audience out of the story rather than pulling them further into the action. The connection to a previous O. Henry short story is truely interesting and begs to be told on film.  On a whole, this is an excellent piece that works well to encourage class discussion in both English and Drama classes.  Teachers this is a good source for cross over study.  Parents your children will enjoy this film.",1361491200,,585,4.542857142857143

You don't see much of Christopher Lloyd these days which is a shame as he shines in this light comedic role and the basic subplot of the film, let boys be boys is a message that is needed today.

This is the type of movie that was a lot more common 30 years ago.  I think we'd do better if this kind of story was more common.

2089136,3,B0002F6AVQ,"""The Ransom of Red Chief"" is of course one of the most famous stories of O Henry. I think everyone knows the story of the hilarious misadventures of two ""kidnappers"" and one mischievous boy, so I won't repeat it here. Like ""The Gift of the Magi"" or ""The Last Leaf,"" the 1910 short story is now part of our culture both in and out of America.

Sadly the 1998 made-for-TV version, loosely based on the beloved O Henry story, is not very good - not because of its numerous departures from the original source material (I'm kind of a guy who enjoyed ""Oliver!"" and its dancing Fagin), but because of the film's too slow pace and unfocused direction, especially in the first half. There are many silly and incredibly corny jokes, which are mostly sight gags or slapstick including the boy's pompous father stepping on a roller skate (not a banana peel).

For me the problem is that director Bob Clark often forgets his job as a storyteller, desperately trying to make us laugh with silly jokes. Actors are all doing their best - Christopher Lloyd and Michael Jeter are very good as a pair of small-time crooks, and so is Haley Joel Osment as the little boy. Only that they deserve better material than making faces.

Those who remember Bob Clark as director of such films as the 1982 hit teen comedy ""Porky's,"" or more recently, inept and crude ""Baby Geniuses"" (in which Christopher Lloyd appears) and ""Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2"" will be surprised to know that ""The Ransom of Red Chief"" is a Hallmark production. To his credit, Bob Clark has also directed a holiday classic ""A Christmas Story"" based on Jean Shepherd's works, so Hallmark's decision is not without good reason.

""The Ransom of Red Chief"" tries hard to be funny and touching at the same time. Maybe too hard. It becomes neither, lacking the characters you relate to, or the original author's wit and surprise.",1293580800,,1871,4.677811550151976

The movie surprised me in how far it strayed from the original story.  I almost didn't show it.
But, then I thought that this movie was a wonderful example of author's purpose, particularly in how the
writers of this film thought it was more imperative to depict the circumstances behind this child's erratic behavior,
than to preserve the irony from the original story.

Nevertheless, I showed my students the DVD and they came up with excellent Venn diagrams illustrating the extreme differences between the story and the film.

So if you're a teacher, you might want to use this film to do a comparison with the story if you're reading it.

Henry's original short story too much to be able to use it as a teaching tool. Nonetheless, it is indeed more interesting than the original.",1233964800,,311,4.379310344827586

8027482,4,B0002F6AVQ,"For anyone that has read O. Henry's short story, The Ransom of Red Chief, this movie adaptation will be a bit of a disappointment. It's still a fairly decent movie. I would put it in the same category  with B movies or maybe a Hallmark movie. The kids will probably like it, but younger adults will most likely take a pass. The Ransom of Red Chief was required reading, in the early 60's, when I was in grade school, but would probably be considered insensitive or politically incorrect by today's standards.",1514678400,,508,4.582417582417582

8027487,1,B0002F6AVQ,"This movie bears very little resemblance to O. Henry's delightful short story. My sixth graders told me that reading the story was much more fun than watching this movie (a rare sentiment). One of the worst film adaptions of literature I've ever seen. The acting, costumes, props, and script all leave much to be desired. Christopher Lloyd did the best he could with the script, so I don't blame him for it being awful.",1498262400,,419,4.675675675675675
