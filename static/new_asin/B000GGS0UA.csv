8131941,1,B000GGS0UA,"I did not have a chance to test before the return window expired, which I should have based on the obvious packaging being a ""homemade"" DVD (even the cheap plastic case had some minor damage).  I was just starting to enjoy it, but then a few seconds later the video/music would stop, and then start again.  As I have been writing this review, it continues to pause or skip on a regular basis.

I can't return it now and it was overpriced to begin - this was burned from someone's computer.  Very disappointed.  It's really incredible that someone would charge this much for a DVD ($19.95)- and not even have it professionally made to ensure quality.  It is what would be expected from this price.  It also would not play from my computer DVD player.  I hope someone contacts me to resolve with a replacement, and I can update this with a better experience.",1495843200,,856,4.512987012987013
