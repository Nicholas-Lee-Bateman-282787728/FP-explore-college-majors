1172487,5,9089701605,Relaxing and Beautiful Images...the next best thing to snorkeling w/out getting wet.  I felt like I was floating.  I was so relaxed I fell asleep in the middle and had to play it again.  The sea turtles are the best part!  My only criticism is that there aren't enough turtles.,1330992000,15,277,4.48

Turn on the TV and DVD player, get yourself comfortable and switch off your mind as you watch millions of sardines forming incredible shapes, turtles swimming by, beautiful corals.... I'm betting you can't stay awake to see the end of the film, but that's the point of it.",1291420800,19,441,4.525

I am writing this because I feel that our minds and environment are so distance from each other these days.  Who has time with a busy life to run to the beach?

Thanks Tony for helping me to reconnect to nature everyday.",1478131200,3,353,4.0

1172532,5,9089701605,"This is a high quality DVD of under water ocean scenes. It's gorgeous footage. I bought a different DVD last year to help my 8 year old son fall asleep and stay in his room all night- he used to get really scared.  Having a relaxation DVD on in his room did the trick!

This DVD does restart on its own, which is essential for what we need.

The music options are ocean sounds only, relaxation music only or relaxation music + ocean sounds together. I recommend the last option. It's very pretty together.

The marine animal life featured includes a turtle, shark (not scary!) a whale shark, eels, schools of fish, octopus, etc... All in HD film.  This is a wonderful DVD!!",1456358400,12,673,4.439024390243903

1172555,4,9089701605,I love it!  It makes me want to strap a camera to a turtles back and just let him go for it.  That I think would be just AWESOME!,1425340800,,129,3.413793103448276

1172559,5,9089701605,"This has to be one of the MOST stress relieving video I've ever seen (and I've seen a lot because I love ambient nature videos). The sea creatures are beautiful as is the underwater scenery. I also loved the accompanying music as it fits the video perfectly and does not overpower the film. The photography is superb and you feel as it you're right in the middle of the sea, weightlessly floating around watching the action.  I bought this DVD a few years ago and I NEVER tire of it!",1424131200,,483,4.366666666666666

1172572,5,9089701605,I bought this for my daughter who has trouble falling asleep. She loves it!!! It was a perfect way to put background noise on with a little bit of light from the TV without putting the actual TV on. It replayed all night for her and when she woke up she felt very happy and refreshed. With the ocean waves or lullaby choice it is great for my husband who works during the night to fall asleep to as well. The reef scenes are extremely relaxing to watch.,1422489600,6,453,4.159090909090909

It looks like a huge aquarium. I didn't realize how beautiful the ocean really is. So full of color. The music is also well put together. It draws you into the room and then the imagery keeps you watching. Very nicely done.",1416268800,,391,4.36986301369863

It did come right away, and if you are looking for something to relax with, like watching a fish tank, then you will probably like this DVD.",1411689600,2,298,4.067796610169491

1172584,5,9089701605,"I just love this DVD - Underwater - The Living Ocean it is so relaxing especially after a stressful days work.  I enjoy the photography, the sounds of the ocean ...just so calming.  I like the idea where you can select with music and nature or ocean sounds alone.  Thumbs up please keep up the good job.  What I also found interesting is the fact that you can now imagine what it looks like seeing the ocean from below without even being there and this is what I love about this creation.",1403568000,6,488,4.271739130434782
1172585,3,9089701605,The statement on the package stated that the playing length of the DVD was 120 minutes.

1172586,5,9089701605,"Since purchasing the ""Tropical Aquarium"" by Isis Visuals, I checked out the other products and purchased three more so that I could have a variety to choose from.  Tropical Gardens and Butterflies was one.  Another was ""Rain"" and another was ""The Living Ocean"".  I like to read having the visuals and music and nature sounds in the background.  Isis Visual products are well done.  The music is non-intrusive which makes it great to have in the background for meditating, reading and even for having a group of people over to provide ambiance.  Also, I like the fact you have a choice to have nature sounds, music or both as the video loops.  Thank you Tony Helsloot for a quality product.",1400976000,,689,4.691666666666666
1172587,5,9089701605,"I have been searching for a DVD that incorporates all the elements this one does-the movement of the fish, the scene changes that are seamless, the option for music or ocean sounds only-for at least 2 years. I thought it would be in Barnes and Noble, and I have looked at other internet sites til I was exhausted. This was just captured the ocean in all it's beauty perfectly!
Thank you to all the divers who did this outstanding work, from a landlubber who is afraid to go into the ocean in person.",1397520000,,499,4.376344086021505

1172596,5,9089701605,We got these DVDs because our grandson does not sleep at night or during his nap time as he should. These DVDs put him to sleep in less than 15 minutes We had no idea how well this would work for us too. The relaxing music and scenery are fantastic. They put us to sleep as we enjoy the music and the underwater world of beauty.  We wouldn't be without them now. Thanks to whomever made them and thanks for selling them to us.:),1390435200,4,428,4.095238095238095
1172597,5,9089701605,"I simply knew this dvd would do what I needed it to, that is to take me away. What I had hoped to find someday was a dvd with only a kelp forest and an hour of sunlight bouncing off a huge school of sardines undulating in their happy home.  This is as close as I will ever get, most likely, and it's pretty wonderful.  The music is very listenable during the whole thing.  Even my 11 year old grandson wants to borrow it.  I first put it on the computer with a set of noise cancelling headphones, and totally blocked my husband's loud tv out of my head!  Mission accomplished.",1388966400,4,576,4.153153153153153

1172599,5,9089701605,Awesome video. Very relaxing. Have a 9 year old grandson with PTSD and he has trouble sleeping. I put this in for him before bed and it relaxes him and helps him get a better nights sleep. It is also very relaxing and entertaining for the whole family to watch.,1385251200,,261,4.24

1172601,5,9089701605,I purchased this for my 17 month old daughter who loves to look at fish.  My husband and I were tired of watching the same sea life documentaries. This plays relaxing music and runs on a loop for continuous play that is a nice background to have while we play.  I will purchase other items like this one.  Perfect if you are alone and want some background noise (but don't just want the television playing) or really anytime to have as a background if you don't like silence.  Very visually and audibly appealing.,1380153600,,513,4.483870967741935
1172602,5,9089701605,"This Lifescapes is gorgeous! Lots and lots of great animal shots, of beautiful sea creatures which show us all how rare and lucky we are to have such creatures living there.

Imagine, this video without the Hawksbill Sea turtle or without the delicate array of fish and sea life. Just imagine if the sea were really barren, due to over fishing or the extinction of sea turtles. What a dreary place it would be without all these living beings.

I think that these dvd's are great, not only because of the beauty and wonderful music. But, because they show us other worlds, that we too often do not appreciate in their entirety.

All too often, we hustle through our lives and do not get to go to the places that we really should see and appreciate. Too often, we find reasons not to appreciate the wonders of nature and all too often we ignore what is around us. The little chirping birds in our yards, the wonderful cries of the sea gulls at the beach, the wondrous joy of a sunshine and the warmth of sunlight.

These dvd's give us that opportunity to enjoy our busy lives more and brings nature in all it's wonderful glory, right into our homes. This dvd places an ocean reef right inside our televisions and lets us truly see the glories and diversity of our living planets! Truly a wonderful dvd, with music, as well.",1378512000,3,1321,4.468879668049793
1172603,3,9089701605,"After purchasing Reefscapes, Natures Aquarium, by Josh Jensen I was so blown away by the cinematography and quality of the DVD, I decided to start a small collection and bought both Underwater Wonders and The Living Ocean, both by The Ambient Collection. Being a diver since 1959, I love the ocean and am a still photographer. I am a little disappointed in these two DVD's and they do not compare, in my opinion, to Reefscapes which is less expensive and truly awesome. Still...Underwater Wonders and The Living Ocean are good but not great.",1373932800,12,541,4.827956989247312

1172605,5,9089701605,"This HD film of living reefs in the Indo-Pacific Ocean is a fabulous testament of what a miraculous place our dieing planet used to be! The turtles are star performers at cleaning stations where their shell & skin are  being restored by smaller fish that eat the unwanted algae. The photography is very good quality & the subjects are very diversified. Underwater lighting is used where needed to show the brilliant natural colors of fish & corral.
