8463365,5,B001BXRRTW,"Paraguay, called an ""island surrounded by land"" and the ""last frontier in the world"", is wonderfully depicted in this 1945 short film. It gives and authentic and broad view of the country, its people and customs, and the amazing footage of urban and rural life is captured perfectly and succinctly. Probably the least known of all latin american countries, Paraguay is arguably the most interesting and fascinating, as even her neighbors know little about her. Be transported to a slower time in South America's ""lost corrider"" and see a truly unusual and unique latin way of life that existed long ago in an obscure region of the world.",1309046400,,637,4.907407407407407
8463366,3,B001BXRRTW,"This is a good documentaryu film, focusing on social and rural aspects of Paraguayan recent contemporary history, from the point of view of an American observer.  It would have been more attractive with a wider coverage of individual analysis of different human actors of the 1945 social life.",1221955200,,293,5.104166666666667
