6109244,1,B00GSTHDGQ,"The film introduces the characters with a quick bio line then jumps to a bank robbery. They get away with $850,000 as cops chase them along with helicopters. Lucky (John Azpilicueta) manages to outrun them and radio as he shifts gears in his automatic Mercury Cougar. The film eventually degrades into a series of home break-ins with flash backs as bad guys comb the houses looking for them after news reports.

The film was flat as the character introduction was meaningless to have us connect to the bank robbers, our protagonists. The acting and dialogue was bland. It couldn't hold my interest.

Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, rape, nudity",1393632000,,641,4.925925925925926
8627080,4,B00GSTHDGQ,"I like this movie, especially in comparison to 95% of the stuff on here,or anywhere,  it's just kind of cool. I'ts probably the only ""the asylum"" movie that's even remotely cool or good. It's definitely better than anything J-Lo, chris pratt, or some other people have ever done. I mean there's just so many people making movies that just can't achieve anything cool and some top actors that have absolutely no talent and it only works when they're playing a part where they can be themselves. So this might be ultra cut rate and all that but it's still good for what it is,and it's really hard to find any cool movie at all.",1520640000,,625,4.482456140350878
