2154334,4,B00030602Y,"I have been practicing yoga for 18 years and in my opinion, this is a great tape for someone who is being newly introduced to yoga and for stretching before and after a workout.  There's more emphasis on strength and toning than power(power yoga tapes have you hold the poses for at least a count of 5, like Bryan Kest).  All of the poses focus on loosening and stretching the hips and working the upper body; two areas that have a tendency to tighten up when doing the firm workouts.  Flexibility is not a high priority on this tape and the poses don't flow together like a traditional vinyasa.  They also don't call the poses by their yoga names like downward facing dog, which should lower the intimidating factor for beginners immensely.  I enjoyed it for the stretch, it really opened up the hip joints and I felt refreshed afterwards.  Definitely watch the tape a couple of times before doing it; the instructions aren't always verbalized and the positions you're in make it impossible to see the screen.",1097884800,5,1010,4.646067415730337
2154335,5,B00030602Y,"I was a little intimidated by the title: ""Power Yoga"". It turns out it is a well-paced 1/2 hour that is suitable for beginners and intermediates. My spouse and I follow the video a few times a week and I believe it has made us stronger and more flexible. We spent last week skiing in Montana and felt strong and confident and were injury free. The video helped!",1171497600,5,361,4.323529411764706
2154336,3,B00030602Y,"First of all, I thought that this was a decent 30 minute workout. I just completed it and feel looser and my body is happier than before I started.

What I didn't like about this DVD was the style of the workout. I have done a bit of yoga and this is my first experience with FIRM. The instructor did not give names to the poses, so even though we were doing familiar yoga poses I still had to look at the screen to understand what she wanted me to do. (She was not very articulate with her descriptions, either.) The music was as loud as her voice and I found it annoying as well as hard to hear her. I did not feel that she spent adequate time on the poses. By the time I realized I was doing the wrong pose (since I was twisted and couldn't see the screen) and looked to see what she was doing she had moved on to something else.

What I like about yoga is that it stretches me and makes me feel centered. This stretched me, but with the music and the lights and the ads on this DVD, I do not feel centered.",1169424000,3,1010,3.9704433497536944
2154337,5,B00030602Y,I've always liked the stretching aspect of yoga but not the meditation part -- this tape is great.  very good stretching poses but not too hard.  one of my favorite exercise tapes.,1168300800,2,180,4.59375
2154338,5,B00030602Y,"Nice and quick yoga work when you find yourself short on time or lacking the energy for something heavier.  I felt very ""open"" in my hips, hamstrings, and back as well as ""worked out"" throughout my whole body after completing the 37 minute long dvd.  I wouldn't recommend this for serious yoga practitioners, however, as it is sort of a mini-class and poses aren't held for as long they would be in a real class.  Perfect for me!!",1154217600,5,430,4.487179487179487
2154339,5,B00030602Y,"The stage is modern/industrial with circled small stages for Kristen & 3 other woman & a small square for the woman doing modified poses. The music is enigma like with a great beat that's not too fast or too slow. Kristen doens't use the traditional indian names or the English translations such as ""powerful pose"" instead she just says squats. She has a great personality, nothing fake, just optomistic no-nonsense with a great flow/tempo to her voice that makes the workout even easier. The choice of which poses to use are perfect, she seems to ahve a intuitive feel for the body, she seems to know how to change it to get the most flexibility & strengthen other muscles when others are tired. The length of time she holds each pose is not to short, nor too long & gives great cues & reminders how not to injure yourself. The only thing I'm disapointed is she could give more cues on having the back foot at a 45 degree angle to keep better balance & posture. The camera could be held longer on the woman doing the modifications.
After a 2 min intro, Kristen starts with simple side stretches then goes to squats, standing with flat back & side stretches in a routine about 3-4x.
Next is some breathing in wide legged standing, then on another routine.
Starting with warrior 1, cat/cow, then hands/knees with lifted 1 arm & leg, then child's pose. This is repeated on the other side.
Next is standing forward bends & also flat back & squats. Next is plank, cobra, downward dog a few times.
The next routine is warrior 1, warrior 2, side angle, triangle pose, side angle deep leg stretch, twisted side angle, plank, downard dog, child's pose. Next is boat pose for the abs & a hand, knee & foot on floor & reg side plank pose. This is all repeated for the other side.
The music changes significiantly to a slower tempo, but still has a good beat with some Gregorian chating here & there. She does camel, deep arm stretch while on hands/knees, downward dog, pigeon, sitting forward bend, butterfly, table-top also with legs straight, reclined leg stretches, reclined spinal twist & a 1 min corpse.

2154340,5,B00030602Y,"i love firm direct!  that is why i love this style of yoga too.  i did traditional yoga for a year and got bored with it.  it was too slow for my style of fitness.  i still love yoga moves though and do them regularly at my own pace.  this dvd is perfect for more upbeat, deep stretching. i have been soar the past days in my upper body from Firm workouts and this morning i did this routine and i feel much better already!  yoga really does work wonders. this is a great DVD to have amoung your collection to really stretch out all those soar muscles.",1150243200,8,552,4.064814814814815
2154341,5,B00030602Y,"I love The Firm workouts. I had been using my The Firm cardio workouts in the morning & wanted something less strenuous to do on weekends or in the evenings. I had never done yoga before. The first time I did this video, I felt goofy & like it probably didn't do much for me. Wow, was I wrong! The next day my muscles were so sore. I now us this video 4 - 5 times a week.

I have since tried a few other yoga videos, but this one is still my favorite. In other videos, they use names for different poses that I am not familiar with. Kirsten tells you exactly what to do in this video & leads you through some great toning & stretching exercises.",1139875200,18,645,4.0
2154342,3,B00030602Y,"I was under the impression (as described on the box)that this would be an off-day workout.  Wrong.  This is a semi-tough routine but there is nothing hatha about it.  In all fairness, I only did about 20 minutes of it, so I didn't complete it but it was just too bloody difficult.

The workout utilized squats and other traditional exercise moves.  The 'yoga' consisted of athletic stretches.

All in all not a bad workout, but I was just expecting something lighter and more congruent with traditional yoga.",1135728000,8,508,4.781609195402299

2154344,5,B00030602Y,"Hello, my name is Tracy and I am a FIRM addict. I do FIRM workouts 4-5 days a week. I say this so that you, dear reader, can know that I am clearly biased toward FIRM-style workouts and I am not a dedicated/purist-type yoga person. This is yoga for exercise, not yoga for chakras, philosophy, or religion. That said. I LOVE this workout! It is the perfect workout for days when you are too sore, or too tired to do a full-on FIRM workout or if you want to add some lighter strength training to a cardio day. Kirsten's(the lead instructor in this workout)directions are clear and easy to follow even for those who have no yoga experience whatsoever. You don't have to know what a Downward Dog is because she'll get you there without confusion. The only equipment required for this workout is a sticky mat....no FIRM Fanny Lifters, Sculpting Sticks, or Boxes.

If you are looking for a true power yoga workout, this one isn't for you. If you want an acessible, easy-to-follow, lighter-weight (but still challenging) workout that gives uses gentle yoga strengthening and stretching....this is one you'll want. I finish this workout feeling pleasantly challenged physically, stretched, and peaceful. Highly recommended!",1101513600,100,1215,4.926829268292683

Received item in a timely fashion.",1362355200,,134,4.36
8035502,5,B00030602Y,"This is an awesome video for beginners.  My husband loves yoga and has tried to get me to do it.  I actually bought this DVD for him.  Out of curiousity, I tried it too and I'm hooked!  It doesn't have the world's best cueing so maybe watch it through at least once.
If you miss the ""spirituality"" of yoga, use the time while you hold the poses to have a gratitude feast and thank God for your health and strength.  You'll be amazed at how much more energy you are given.
I do this workout 3 nights a week about an hour before bed and sleep like a baby.  I am also impressed with how much more strength I have (mostly in my upper body).  Highly recommend it!",1311897600,,658,4.09375

8035504,5,B00030602Y,I am new to yoga and this tape is fabulous.  You can truly get addicted to doing yoga because it is so relaxing.  Don't be fooled you get a really good workout but it is at a slow pace and when you finish you are filled with peace and serenity.  What a godsend!  Can't wait to do it again.,1210204800,,289,3.847457627118644
8035505,5,B00030602Y,"The Firm has done it again. My core and lower back feel incredible after this workout. I wanted an intro to yoga without all the ""jargon"" and I got exactly what I was looking for with this video. Anyone who stretches and works on their flexibility regularly will be familiar with the movements and postures in this video, but there's enough of a learning curve to give those who aren't athletic/flexible something to aspire to and keep motivated. I plan to use this video on rest days or on days when I'm too tired to workout at a much faster pace.",1187049600,2,548,4.435643564356436
8035506,2,B00030602Y,"I am in the minority, but I did not care for this yoga workout.  I found the cueing confusing and uneven.  The instructor does not state what yoga pose we are doing either which would be helpful.  She never says- this is the triangle pose or warrior I. There is inadequate time spent in the stretches and the transitioning is rocky.

 I enjoy many other Firm workouts but this one was a dud.  I would recommend  Rodney Yee Yoga DVD's or David Swenson and/or Baron Baptiste.  You would get a more valuable Yoga Stretch workout and Yoga knowledge from these instructors rather than the Firm's take on Yoga.",1180396800,4,604,4.527777777777778
8035507,5,B00030602Y,"I started with this DVD in an aerobics class that I take. We do a different workout video everyday and this one is by far my favorite out of over 50 we've done.

I'm not very good at fast pace kickboxing type videos and this was the perfect solution for me. I was able stretch myself extremely well and gain a lot of flexibility. I'm an avid tennis player and I've noticed an improvement in my game since I've been working out with this video.

Usually, I'm turned off by yoga. I don't like the ""mystical elements"" most videos try to incorporate. This workout left that part out, but still manages to be extremely relaxing.

I'd recommend this video to a beginner or a pro!",1179014400,8,673,4.368
8035508,3,B00030602Y,"I like this dvd overall but I do feel that it is too short. When I take the yoga class at the gym it is at least an hour long. The stretches feel pretty nice after a long, stressful day.",1172275200,,186,3.675
