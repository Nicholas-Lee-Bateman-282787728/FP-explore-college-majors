8440852,1,B0016C7DXS,While the DVD says that it is  in 2008 the information was obviously recorded in the early 80s. It has not been updated since then therefore it is more than 20 years out of date. I highly recommend that you do not buy this product. You will be disappointed in the information contained within. If you're interested in alternative energy I suggest you pick a different product.,1242345600,4,376,4.611940298507463
