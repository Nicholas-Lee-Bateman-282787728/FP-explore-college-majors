8126535,3,B000FTJ63I,"While there is no doubt most of the martial arts practitioners featured in this documentary are in their top form, I rather expected for there to be a commentator introducing the various forms and their participants to the audience, including some background on the competitors as well as the scores they earned during the competition. I also expected the winner of each form to be announced at the end of the competition for each category. However, having said that, it is a worthwhile watch if you're into martial arts. One final word, the combat category is glaringly absent from the documentary; which is disappointing, because this is the category I like the most.",1382486400,,669,4.929203539823009
