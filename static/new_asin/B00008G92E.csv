7983480,1,B00008G92E,Lucy would be turning in her grave if she could see her show being sold in such a horrible video quality. What a shame! I do not understand what the other reviewer was thinking give this DVD 4 stars. I have a excellent DVD player that makes many shows look like the people are right in the room with you. Even the much older shows look far superior to this DVD. Save your time and money and pass on this.,1159660800,,404,4.0625
