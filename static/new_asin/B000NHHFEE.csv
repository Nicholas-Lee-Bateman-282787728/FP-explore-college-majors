2768535,3,B000NHHFEE,"I need to begin by saying I saw this film several years ago and enjoyed it. It's quirky, uneven and the acting unpolished. Still, it's an indie film that those qualities just add to its charm. For that, I rate it a three.

What really disappoints me, and I don't know if this is Amazon's doing or the company releasing this digital version, is this version of the film is CENSORED. First off, this video is labeled 'unrated,' which means viewers expect there to be some incidental nudity, language, drug use or whatever.

When I am buying a film, I don't expect there to be a huge black square in the middle of the screen, shielding my eyes from something I know is supposed to be there, something I expect to be there, because I saw it in the original version, which was also marked 'unrated.'

Like I said, the film is enjoyable and it was certainly not expensive. However, when I pay retail for a film (rather than renting it), I don't expect the version I buy to be different from the version that is available on DVD. If this digital release hadn't been under $10, I would be returning it.

Since this may or may not be a studio issue, I did not rate this film based on the censorship, but none of the other reviews pointed out it was a cut up copy, so that's the topic I chose to comment upon.",1353024000,54,1299,4.289795918367347
2768536,1,B000NHHFEE,Fun down where??  This has the dialogue of two three year olds.  I could do better with a minicam in my bathroom mirror.  This movie needs a major overhall and my advise is to save your money....that is unless you need help falling asleep.,1334966400,,239,4.386363636363637
2768537,1,B000NHHFEE,"Low budget amatourish attempt to create ""a film"". I kept asking myself what kind of fun is mentioned in the title...Because the motion picture is not funny at all. I wish I could write it's at least interesting :(
Unfortunately, I cannot as there is no plot. Yep, no storyline. And it drags for more than 80 minutes.
Loss of time and money.",1314144000,,340,4.412698412698413
2768538,1,B000NHHFEE,"This has to be one of the very worst Gay films I have ever seen -- and I've seen a lot of Gay movies!

Apparently the director thought that every single frame he shot should end up in his film. There are seemingly endless scenes that go on and on and on for no particular reason. There are scenes with no dialogue and no music, not even background noises! This movie is much too boring to be 'so bad it's good'.

The full frontal nudity was boring and does not redeem the movie. The actor wasn't that good looking and the scene, like the rest of the movie, wasn't interesting to watch.

This movie is so amateurish it's hard to believe it was originally released in 1989. If Amazon allowed negative stars, this movie might rate a negative 5 stars.

And to answer the question posed in the title, Frameline will be distributing the movie. There is no other possible reason why such a boring movie was shown at the festival.",1183161600,10,922,4.374269005847953
2768539,1,B000NHHFEE,"Hmmmmmmmm... I don't know. I did not enjoy the movie at all. I understand it was a low budget movie, but don't see that much creativity in this film. Story line was nothing. Or I should say there is no story line at all.

The plot and reason why he has to leave his hometown was very stupid. I just don't know what to say....",1181001600,3,325,4.0
2768540,3,B000NHHFEE,"This is a strange, funny little gay flick, made on a shoestring in the late '80's.  It's not at all a slick, Hollywood-style thing a la ""Trick.""  There are long, long takes that may try your patience, except that they set a very individual tone and style.  Essentially the story of a shy, but spirited, small-town guy who decides all of a sudden to head for some ""Fun Down There"" in Manhattan, where he aimlessly rambles through his little journey of self-fulfillment with gay sex and love.  (The film is unrated due to some semi-explicit masturbatory sex.)  The film's humor is almost totally deadpan, and the brainless conversations between Buddy (Michael Waite) and his family are borderline hilarious.  (Buddy's parent's are played by Waite's real-life Mom & Dad.)  A real homemade project, from the days when ""independent"" meant something.  Maybe not for everyone, but worth a look for those interested in the evolution of gay subject matter in films.

Trivia: an early performance in a supporting role by Michael Imperioli of The Sopranos fame.",1022889600,18,1050,4.988505747126437
2768541,3,B000NHHFEE,"When ""Fun Down There"" came out, so to speak, in 1988, it was hardly your conventional gay movie. It wasn't glib, it wasn't full of histrionics or loaded with messages or trying to shock, in short it was rather unlike the way gay people are portrayed - mostly by themselves - in most media. The film quality and sound were mediocre at best, but I rather liked the film. The story of a very real and ordinary young man (in both looks and aspirations) from upstate New York coming to the city and making a life for himself despite being rather baffled by the whole gay scene, was very understated and rather charming. It may be a bit too boring and lacking in drama for some - if you want to see a movie with a lot more drama and intensity but with a gay character who is similarly realistic and outside what most think of as gay culture, check out Gus Van Sant's first movie, ""Mala Noche,"" which is a gritty, funny and disturbing film full of a bittersweet sadness and longing.",995328000,9,975,4.333333333333333
2768542,1,B000NHHFEE,"The description on the box is the only amusing part of thewhole thing, I was so mad  that I wasted money on a video with such poor actorsand everything else, I do not recomend this to anyone! This was just plain bad!",981417600,8,216,4.142857142857143

2768546,3,B000NHHFEE,"Another coming of age story. Two problems: too much ""artsy"" content that doesn't really lend itself to the story, but takes up an inordinate amount of the movie. For instance, the scene where he's walking down the country road goes on WAY too long. Unfortunately, there's more than a few of these scenes.
The other is the abrupt ending that left me quite unsatisfied. Perhaps for a film festival these two things make for a good festival film, but I wasn't looking for an artsy movie but for something entertaining. Guess I'm just too unenlightened to ""get it.""
Would have only given it 2.5 stars. Not saying don't watch it, just saying realize ahead of time that most folks who watch it will get to the end of it and not be entirely satisfied.",1472428800,,744,4.559701492537314

2768558,5,B000NHHFEE,"It's a charming film.  I am not sure when this film was made, but it is a very-early 80s feel, and I recall the very tail-end of this kind of innocence and a kinder ""gay community"" when we were nicer to one another - i guess in part because we had to be.  It gets the family angle right.  Lots of people at that time had positive, but compromised, family relationships.  By that I mean we played don't ask/don't tell without knowing that was the name of the game, but it wasn't the end of the world at that time.  It also got right how some had had early experiences, and some didn't.  And some people, like the characters in the film, made happy endings for themselves -- not megahappy, but happy.  It was nice to see this film, like its characters, and think about a lot of stuff. It's a good chilly, rainy night movie to watch by yourself.",1451088000,,842,4.225

2768563,1,B000NHHFEE,"A very low budget, simple, cliche tale of the rural young gay man moving to the big city to ""find himself"". Very cliche and riddled with stereotypes of rural people as naive, ignorant, ""country bumpkin"". The story went incredibly slowly and by the end of the film, there was no resolution. In sum, this film had no plot and no substance. The only thing I enjoyed was seeing New York City in the 1980's with glimpses of the elevated railway that is now the High Line, the west side highway, the (once) gritty-ness of NYC, and the Twin Towers. What a huge disappointment.",1426377600,2,569,4.533980582524272

2768565,1,B000NHHFEE,"I got the point that the protagonist left home to find himself in the big city, but the dialogue didn't tell a complete story for me.

2768566,5,B000NHHFEE,"Yes, the movie is amateurish in film quality and camera angles (they never change!). But the characters are quite wonderful. The friendliness of the milieu depicted is totally refreshing.

Was the gay world in NYC ever so charming and welcoming? (It would be nice to think so.)

2768570,3,B000NHHFEE,"I have to admit, as DEEPLY flawed as it is, from ultra-low budget poor production values, including sound, lighting, editing, music & mediocre, at best, acting...there is something really interesting about this movie. I wouldn't watch it again, but I finished it, only fast forwarding a tiny bit.  It appears to have been made in the late 80s with someone's home camera. Our lead Buddy, a naive country boy living with his lower middle class family moves to NYC to experience life in the city (and come out of the closet). With little money and (an exaggerated) naivete, he manages to get by and kick start his gay life through quick acquaintances and people's attraction to him. (His sweet character more than his looks) The movie gives us the first week, the catalyst of his life to ... ?  The film just ends, but we can easily imagine where things are going. The film is less about the narrative and more a sort of an expose, almost a hidden camera peek at this moment in the life of Buddy. The New York City scenes seemed covertly shot in what were at the time obscure locales. It also makes for an interesting time capsule of the NYC of the late 80s, decay and all, before the Giuliani redux. There's a scene on what appears to be the High Line, before the High Line park concept, that was kind of cool to see. I watched it free with Prime and have no regrets though this would not be for everyone, only those who would enjoy fringe low budget independent film with little narrative buried deeply in subtext. If I knew then what I know now, I'm not sure I'd pay to see it. Uptick to three stars for being sheer train-wreck interesting. Down tick for being a plain awful production, low budget even considered.",1417392000,,1714,4.490384615384615

2768572,3,B000NHHFEE,I thought it was a good attempt to portray an ordinary guy coming to terms with urban life and beat. The movie is low key mainstream. The hero is a country kid. He is not drawn to the usual gay movie pleasures. He is open and plain in his taste. He is refreshing in his confident wonderment  and easily amazed but unashamed to be basic. He is a no frills gay.,1413244800,,359,4.056338028169014

I keep a list of films I watch, and I rate them with a star system, from one to five. I could not give this even half a star. In two words, it sucks!",1364342400,,545,4.1415094339622645
2768610,1,B000NHHFEE,One of the worst movies I have ever seen.  Did not understand the point of anything.  Acting and writing were both horrible.,1363305600,3,124,4.590909090909091
2768611,5,B000NHHFEE,Liked it! it was good to watch! a great movie to watch when in the mood! I gatta find more like this one!,1361836800,,105,3.608695652173913
2768612,3,B000NHHFEE,pretty tiresome and could use more plot and circumstance. I rate it as just okay and no more than that.,1360627200,,103,4.2
8177632,1,B000NHHFEE,I made it half way through. It was so slow and boring. The characters acted so weird. I would never like these people.,1521504000,,118,4.173913043478261
8177633,2,B000NHHFEE,"mediocre video quality, whenever get to a possibly interesting scene skips past it.",1520553600,,83,5.461538461538462
8177634,4,B000NHHFEE,"OK, not a 5 star movie, but growing up in upstate NY then moving to NYC in the same time frame, it brought back memories.",1516320000,,121,3.88
8177635,1,B000NHHFEE,"Oh my GOD  WTF,  This is the worst low budget movie I've ever seen. The acting was the bad, the storyline sucks and that's not in a good way. I watched this movie in 15min by fast-forwarding through the entire movie. All I want to know is how the hell did this make it to Amazon? A total waste of bandwidth!",1515888000,,307,4.016393442622951
8177636,1,B000NHHFEE,"Automatically it looks as the director was trying to reach a timeline of 98 or 99 minutes by showing the public a very long and BORING walk down the road with the lead character. The story line is terribly dull. The viewer really does not connect with the characters because they seem uncomfortable in their own skin. If this was supposed to be an art house film it passed in complete boredom, but failed as any true form of art. Suggestion: Any other film then this!",1513900800,,467,4.441860465116279
8177637,2,B000NHHFEE,"This is an older gay film - 1983. There is nothing too special about it, except when the song ""Hymn of Love"" is
sung...start @ 27:05. This song was written by the great French singer Edith Piaf. Listen to her sing it on You Tube.
She is one of the most amazing singers of all time.
If you enjoy gay films, there is nothing wrong about this movie. It is just a low budget movie with good intentions.",1502668800,,398,4.115384615384615
8177638,1,B000NHHFEE,"The movie was so terrible that I never made it half way through before I bailed on it.  What a mess!  Strange, long scenes which I cannot figure out what the director wanted me to feel other than boredom.  The characters all seemed plastic and the acting made the plastic melt.  There wasn't one scene or one actor that I cared about.  Save yourself some time and don't bother with this bad movie.",1500422400,,397,4.383561643835616
