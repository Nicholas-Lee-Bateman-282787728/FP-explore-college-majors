3874305,5,B0028S110U,I have bought several DVDs on line through Amazon and the descriptions of the movies are very accurate.  They always arrive quickly and in very good condition.  Only one time did I have to return a movie but that was a simple error of which area the movie could be played in.  The one I received was only for Great Britain but the seller was able to refund my money as soon as I returned the item.  Unfortunately he didn't have another one but I was able to find one on Amazon.  It's great to be able to buy older movies through Amazon and their sellers.,1349568000,2,554,4.188679245283019
3874306,2,B0028S110U,"I should have guessed that this was the ""nashville sound""....horns,backup singers, etc. With little music from the artists.  Sure enough...sweet orchestra wit strings, brass, singers, etc. If you're looking for good old country music as it should be seen and heard this ain't it.. Save your money! Sounds like lawrece Welk!",1333238400,,323,5.333333333333333

3874308,5,B0028S110U,"This is a three hour show that aired in 1978 under the title 50 Years of Country Music.  It has a balanced mix of the older more established country singers and some of the newer generation (from the 70s viewpoint).  It is especially valuable in that many of the performers shown here are no longer with us (i.e. Johnny Cash, Roy Acuff, Ray Charles, Bill Monroe, Ernest Tubb, Minnie Pearl, Charlie Rich, Tammy Wynette, and Chet Atkins).  Although there is a track listing on the Country Music Hall of Fame's website, here is an abridged version.

3874309,5,B0028S110U,"I remember when this series of shows first aired on NBC in 1978.  When the Country Music Hall of Fame started issuing compilations of historic TV shows and performers such as the Flatt & Scruggs, Marty Robbins, and Merle Haggard, I suggested they look into securing the rights to issue what I've considered the two most important country music specials to ever air - this show, and another, the Public Television airings of two entire Saturday night Grand Ole Opry shows in the late '70s.  Thankfully, one of them, Country's Greatest Stars, has finally been made available to enjoy on volume 1 and volume 2 of this set.
  Both DVDs are a must for any country music fan.  The performances on these shows are fantastic!  A rare chance to see many of these historic stars, all singing their greatest hits from various eras of the music, taped live for a network broadcast - something unheard of even today!  Even today's Country Music Association Awards Shows never give sufficient time to their Hall of Fame inductees during the broadcasts.  This show is a goldmine!
  My favorite performances have to be the various medleys by such stars as Roger Miller, Tennessee Ernie Ford, and especially Eddy Arnold.  As host of the final hour, Arnold, at 60 years of age, is still in great voice, and he gets plenty of chances to prove it with four musical segments.  His medley of hits, accompanied only by his guitar, is a condensed version of exactly what he would do in his personal appearances during that period.  It's a priceless performance!  The orchestra, conducted by Bill Walker, backs up Arnold's other selections, just as Walker did on many of Eddy's recordings.  Arnold gets a well-deserved standing ovation at the end of the show, which was taped at the then relatively new Grand Ole Opry House.
  Sure, there are a bunch of great '70s era country stars - The Kendalls, Ronnie McDowell, Johnny Rodriguez, Crystal Gayle, etc. - and they all sound great, but it's the mix of both veteran and younger acts that make this show an historical masterpiece!
  Thanks to the Hall of Fame for releasing this set, and let's hope we'll see that other request of mine, the PBS Grand Ole Opry telecasts, sometime soon!",1264809600,9,2208,4.748031496062992
