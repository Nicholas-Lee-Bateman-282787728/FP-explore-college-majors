8429211,2,B004H0M2UU,"After stealing a getaway car with a local crime boss in the trunk, Mickey (Gregory) is thrust into a world of human trafficking and ruthless killing.  When the crime boss Don Barber is let go by Mickey he suddenly realizes that Mickey is a man he wants on his payroll.  Mickey is tasked with trying to find out who attacked Don and to extract revenge.  Since ""Snatch"" came out it seems like everyone is trying to make the next one, or be the next Guy Ritchie.  Since ""Snatch"" I think that ""Layer Cake"" is the only one that can be compared to it.  This movie is very violent and bloody, that's where the similarities  end. I just really couldn't get in to this one.  Some parts were pretty good, but they were few and far between.  It didn't hold my attention. I give it a C-.

Would I watch again? - Nope",1300406400,2,804,4.2368421052631575
