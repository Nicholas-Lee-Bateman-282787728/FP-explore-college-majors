33688,4,0780625390,"This is a retrospect of Goldberg's wrestling career when he was the ""in"" thing in the world of professional wrestling. Bill kept adding to his undefeated streak (we don't see his loss to Kevin Nash) and keeping the fans excited. Yes, this was a period during WCW's better days. Too bad thigs didn't work out at the front office or Goldberg and WCW would still be a serious threat to WWE today! Still, don't rule out Goldberg vs. Rock at some point in the future!",1037059200,2,462,4.447058823529412
33689,3,0780625390,"What a grump.  Goldberg has to be the most unhappy man on the planet, he takes the interviews a little to seriously and flat out insults the intelligence of the viewer, as if we didn't know it was a work, whatever Bill.  The rest is pretty good, relive WCW when it had a chance and try to imagine they didn't blow it.  still worth getting though.  Hold on, I forgot to mention you get to see the wizards of the WCW booking commity with highlights of such evenly attested matches as Goldberg vs Lodi, and Goldberg vs some guy I've never heard of and then he threatens this no names life right on camera.  Anyway its entertaining in that you know Bill's trying to sell and nobody's buying.",1009584000,,687,4.3359375
33690,5,0780625390,"GET IT! Fan of wrestling and Hogan for years, This video shows the coming of a very good wrestler that is going to carry wrestling in the XXth century. Being in Europe I have missed a few years of wrestling as it is  not shown on TV all the time and this is a brilliant summary of the  beginning of his career (a bit short though). At the end of this very good  video, you want some more. I am waiting for the next video as an update  would be really good idea.",945129600,,461,3.924731182795699

7789710,5,0780625390,"Thanks to a friend of mine finally cleaning out his garage, I was given a bunch of old VHS tapes including this one that was one of the many ""WCW Superstar Series"" that WCW started releasing around 1998 that ran around an hour long.  This VHS was different than most of the others they put out around this time as this was mostly just an interview with Goldberg about different elements of his character such as his signature moves, the entrance, the fans chanting his name, and memories of his WCW career up to that point with highlights being shown of them along with other ""in character"" comments from other WCW talents.  Highlights of his career include his debut match against Hugh Morris, the feud with fellow NFL alumni Steve McMichael, his war with the Flock & U.S. title victory over Raven, his 100th victory over Konnan, the night he went through both Scott Hall & Hollywood Hogan to win the WCW Championship, his first battle royal & confrontation with Giant, his first match against Sting on Nitro.

At this point, Goldberg was only in WCW for around a year so they did a good job in covering that year on here as this was definitely when Goldberg was at the peak of his career.  To this day, this is a DVD that would still have value as none of the matches outside of the WCW Title win over Hogan has been released in full onto DVD so this is a tape that is worthy of being added to the collection.  As a side note, if you want an idea of just how unorganized WCW was at this time...the lead announcer at this time was Tony Schavone yet they spelled his name wrong while referring to Disco Inferno under the name ""Disco Fever.""",1300060800,,1640,4.399339933993399
7789711,4,0780625390,"This was a great video from top to bottom, covering Goldberg's career in WCW from his in ring debut in September 1997 to Road Wild 1998.

It starts off with Bill's first match against Hugh Morris and goes into demolishing opponents like Steve Mongo McMichael, The Flock, Disco Inferno, the nWo, Sting, his first U.S. and World Title shot and many others.

It also includes WCW wrestlers thoughts on Goldberg as well as what they think of the phenomonal athlete.

Goldberg gives his thoughts of his character and talks about his finishing move and how he came up with the destructuble Jackhammer.

The only thing that was wrong with this video, was that they were showing Goldberg coming from his dressing room backstage on Nitro, and the commentators and Gene was talking about how he was going to speak for the first time in the ring after the nWo attack in his locker which i thought would've been great, but instead it went on how Goldberg uses his jackhammer on his opponent.

But overall, the video was well documented.

Goldberg in my mind, is or was the best wrestler that has ever stepped in to the wrestling world.  And not to mention, a legend and a hero.

HE IS DA MAN, believe me you will not be disappointed.",1198540800,,1221,4.568807339449541

7789713,5,0780625390,"As we all know Goldberg was one of the very best WCW and WWE wrestlers. This VHS contains Goldberg's WCW selected best matchers.

As a very big of this awesome wrestler, I'm so happy that I brought this tape as it contains interviews and other Goldberg stuff, which are simply, Incredible!!!!!!!!!!

If you are a Bill Goldberg fan, this is a must, trust me this is simply the best ever Goldberg tape which is out there, and as far as I know the only.

Goldberg, you are the best of the best, thats for sure.

7789715,5,0780625390,"In the ten years that I have been watching professional wrestling, I was always more of a WWE fan. However, there was one guy that made me want to tune into Nitro, and that was Goldberg. Goldberg has been a favorite wrestler of mine ever since he debuted back in September of 1997. He may not be the most technically sound wrestler of all time, but his strength and intensity are unmatched. He was the first wrestler I have ever seen to become so popular soley based on what he did in the ring. He did not have to come out and cut promo after promo like Austin and The Rock. He spoke through violence in the ring. Perhaps the most amazing thing about Goldberg, is the fact that he became the most popular man in wrestling in less than a year's time amassing a win-loss record of 176-0.
Ever since Goldberg debuted in the WWE in March of 2003, the WWE have not released any videos or DVD's on him. He has captured the hearts of a lot of WWE fans, but some don't know the history behind Goldberg, or how he became such a huge star. If you were a fan of Goldberg's back in WCW, or you just started liking him in the WWE, this video is a must own. It takes you step by step through Goldberg's career from his debut in WCW, to after he won the title from Hulk Hogan. Goldberg comments on different aspects of his career through interviews, and a lot of different footage in shown as well.
Overall, I thought this video was very well done, and extremely informative. It continues to be one of my favorite wrestling documentaries. If you are fan of Goldberg, pick this one up.
A solid 5 stars...",1078099200,6,1588,4.26158940397351
7789716,5,0780625390,"I love this video. I watched it the other day for the first time in years and purely enjoyed it. Being a huge Goldberg mark, I really like how this highlites him during the height of his career, before his first loss. It has the great Hogan-Goldberg match for the World title. I remember that match so well. It was the main event of the first wrestling show I had ever watched and made me fall in love with wrestling. A great video. I recommend it to all wrestling fans, especially because the end of Goldberg in the USA may be coming at Wrestlemania XX.",1076716800,,554,4.285714285714286
7789717,4,0780625390,"See Bill Goldberg as the unbeatable ""monster"" before Vince Russo came in and destroyed everything.  Goldberg might not have an array of moves, but he was still awesome to see in WCW because pf the way he manhandled opponents and would just keep coming.  He seemed to get better with every match and the video is complete with Hollywood Hogan vs. Goldberg from an Atlanta Nitro when you could still get PPV like matches on the cable programs.  Listening to the crowds during the matches and also the announcers will send chills down your spine.",1052956800,,543,4.6947368421052635
