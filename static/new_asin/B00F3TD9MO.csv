5967170,5,B00F3TD9MO,"This is an extremely well- written movie that sends powerful messages about  bullying, family love, and friendship. CONTEST does a terrific job  presenting an anti-bully message in a way that audiences of all ages can related to. A wonderful and talented cast who portray the characters they play in a way that engages the audience throughout the twists and turns of the story. Tommy's grandmother,a quiet yet strong woman, is a.wonderful role model of love, simplicity, and forgiveness.

CONTEST was truly an enjoyable and well done movie in all respects (i.e. writing, acting, and the unique way the anti -bullying and other messages are portrayed).",1387584000,2,651,5.180952380952381
5967171,5,B00F3TD9MO,"WOW! I really enjoyed is movie!  As a middle school teacher! I appreciate the efforts of the cast and the writer/director to deliver a much-needed anti-bullying message in an accessible, highly entertaining way. School authorities, stressing their serious commitment to zero tolerance of bullying, often promote their message in a heavy-handed manner.

Not Contest.

Sure, the subject matter is serious (one character even contemplates suicide briefly).  But this script also embraces the foibles present in teens, tweens and adults: namely, being used to doing certain things (like being a loner or a bully) for our ""right"" reasons and then having to deal with those reasons being challenged.  And the cast--especially, but not limited to, the five leads--demonstrate their talent as their characters respond to those challenges, for better or worse.

Kudos!
To Kenton Duty (bully Matt) and Daniel Flaherty (victim & teen chef Tommy) to realistically portraying the rocky relationship between their characters, with its twists & turns of ingrained mistrust vs. building trust.
To Katherine McNamara's strong-minded & lovely Kat, an observant, forthright blogger who challenges both Tommy & Matt in her quest for the truths underlying their unlikely partnership.
To Mary Beth Peil and Kyle Dean Massey: the lovingly supportive Gran contrasts well with Matt's manipulative older brother Kyle. How these adults dispense their respective wisdom (Gran's selfless vs. Kyle's self-driven) to the teens they're raising reminds us how ""children live what they learn.""

Just like life, Contest is funny, eye-opening and touching. Tommy and his teen chef crew's lively run-ins with the female Bartosh cousins' team and every appearance of obnoxious teen chef opponent Dennis (a hilarious Dan Fabi) cracked me up.  Ravi Ullman's frazzled but smooth TV host kept me smiling. Alex Boniello scarily impressed me as Joe, Matt's friend & swim teammate, with his funny yet vicious streak. And Owen Teague's Bobby (a Team Tommy member) won my heart whether he was impishly flaunting his success with the Bartosh girls or brokenheartedly crying when targeted by a cyber-bully.

Contest send an uplifting message: be open to friendships with people who might not seem to be your ""type""--a reminder that well serves tweens & teens beyond their school experiences.

I highly recommend Contest for students 4th grade & up through early high school. Ideally, families would benefit from watching it together. (Also recommended by Stuart Snyder, president of The Cartoon Network where Contest first premiered in October, Anti-Bullying Month.)  I also purchased a copy for my classroom library--principals take note!",1387584000,2,2690,5.473429951690822
5967172,5,B00F3TD9MO,"Anyone who has attended public school in the last 20 years is quite familiar with the sort of anti-bullying films students are generally forced to watch: three or four teenagers in an arcade/public library/[insert location no modern teenager would ever go to here], wearing clothes that were in fashion for about 10 minutes in 1986, unsuccessfully attempt to suppress Canadian accents while a stiff narrator asks the audience what they would do in the situation. Ironically, the actors in these movies are possibly the most retroactively bullied teens of all time, as students are unable to resist mocking poorly-delivered chestnuts like, ""Give me your lunch money, eh.""

Contest isn't one of those movies. This is a well-acted, humorous, and thought-provoking film that manages to make its message apparent without sacrificing the story. Self-reliant Tommy is forced to collaborate with the intimidating Matt for a cooking contest, but the stakes go way beyond cuisine--Tommy is convinced that Matt has an ulterior motive, and he's not wrong. In fact, there are multiple layers to Matt's involvement, and double-crossing is the biggest dish on the menu. The duo's relationship evolves naturally, and not always in a positive direction, thanks to a combination of Matt's continued desire to impress his cronies and please his devious older brother, and Tommy's inability to fully trust his former tormentor. The ultimate outcome probably won't come as a surprise to viewers, but even towards the end of the film, there are enough twists and turns to keep things exciting.

Of course, the mission of a movie like this is probably more about stemming discussion rather than merely trying to entertain. Fortunately, Contest manages to do both, especially since all teens should easily find traces of themselves in one or more characters. In a genre that often comes across as cheesy and forced, this is a rare movie that could actually make a real impact on its audience.",1387584000,2,1968,5.16614420062696
5967173,5,B00F3TD9MO,"I went into a screening for Contest earlier this year with some very basic expectations.  Average expectations I guess, for an anti-bullying movie with some familiar stars and a soundtrack that really appealed to me.  Then the movie started...and right from the start, I saw just how different this movie is.  It has a cast filled with actors from Broadway, Nickelodeon, MTV, and Disney, plus several well known stars from Hollywood and elsewhere too.  But the story itself is what grabs you.

This isn't just some standard, cut-and-dry bullying movie with a bully, a bullied kid, and a few supporting actors.  This is the most comprehensive look at bullying in schools I've ever seen!  It looks at how the bullies are often bullied themselves, how bullies got to be this way, how teachers too often look the other way, and how the bullying ""issue"" in our world is so much more than just one issue.  There's literally so much going on in this film, by the time the end credits arrive, your mind is still absorbing how much the movie just affected you.

Yes, the actors are all beautiful, and yes the soundtrack is my favorite in years!  But beyond all the nice packaging, Contest is a thoroughly life-changing little movie everyone really should see.  Fantastic job to all involved, and I'm really looking forward to seeing it again now on DVD!",1387152000,5,1344,4.75
5967174,4,B00F3TD9MO,"A very nice film, with engaging actors, a good script, and a positive message.  The story revolves around a group of high school students, a very bad older brother, and a few adults some of which are clueless, some are sympathetic.  Different examples of bullying are dealt with.  Kids and adults can learn to identify and respond to bullying behavior.  An unexpected plot development shows there can be redemption for a bully and exposes possible causes of his behavior.",1387065600,3,471,4.924050632911392
5967175,5,B00F3TD9MO,"I saw this film at the Mill Valley Film Festival and I'm ordering gift copies for friends and family. It's a well-crafted, well-acted, and well-produced film about bullying that I think kids will actually enjoy watching. The nuanced story features some very appealing and  talented young actors. An entertaining film for the family to watch together with a positive and important message.",1387065600,5,388,5.258064516129032
5967176,5,B00F3TD9MO,"A wonderful story of how the school bully is caught on camera and made to pay his penance to the very boys he bullied! This film takes the time to examine the behind-the-scenes life of the bad kid turned friend to the very boy he bullied. Oh, yes, there are other bad guys at work in this flick, but when you watch, you'll be rewarded with a nice ending!

I recommend ""Contest"" for all ages; hopefully, families will watch it together!",1386028800,4,435,4.37037037037037
5967177,4,B00F3TD9MO,This was a pretty good movie with a good lesson.  The bully turning into a good guy.  And people learning to trust unlikely friends.  This is also a good anti-bullying film.  I liked Kenton Duty in this film.  He apparently gained 21lbs in muscle for this movie and then way more afterwards.  That's dedication to the art. The movie was awkward at points but other than that it was good.,1389830400,2,387,4.457142857142857
5967178,5,B00F3TD9MO,Great cast and the music is WOW!  Every song on this soundtrack can stand on it's own.  Can't wait to see what's next from everyone involved in this film.,1388707200,,154,4.275862068965517
5967179,5,B00F3TD9MO,"I watched this with my grandchildren the other day.  They were very taken with the
story and got it even though they are only 9.  We need more movies like this to reinforce
anti-bullying concepts!  Very well acted by appealing kids who really get the message across.",1388707200,,266,4.617021276595745
5967180,5,B00F3TD9MO,"What a great film! Funny, complex, and moving.
Would definitely recommend it, especially for teens. The actors did an amazing job. Kenton and Danny have great chemistry on screen.",1388534400,,179,5.206896551724138
5967181,5,B00F3TD9MO,"As a teacher this moive hit home for me in many areas. It is a moive that speakes to you from the very beginning about an important topic(bullying).  It is well written and performed and really enjoyable to watch with your class or your children at home. I would highly recommend it to young people ,parents and educatiors.  Great moive to add to any collection.",1387756800,,362,4.553846153846154
5967182,5,B00F3TD9MO,I enjoyed watching this movie with my kids.  I thought it had a great message about friendship and being kind to people.  It was also about learning about yourself.,1387670400,,164,4.620689655172414
5967183,5,B00F3TD9MO,"This is such an important and topical film for everyone to see, most especially kids of all ages.
It is a wholesome film, and shows that everyone matters, and there is still hope for even the meanest kids to turn their lives around.
I most sincerely recommend this film as a ""Must See"".",1387670400,,286,4.415094339622642
5967184,5,B00F3TD9MO,"This is a movie with a serious message that totally entertains !!  Seriously !! Somehow the author/director, producers, and editors managed to get the point across without the always expected preachy approach when dealing with a serious and timely topic. Congratulations to all associated with this project for creating such an excellent product. As a teacher, I would show this to Jr. High through High School classes in a heartbeat. I've purchased several copies for family members within that age range. If you do the same. you won't be disappointed.",1387670400,,553,5.144444444444445
5967185,5,B00F3TD9MO,Bullying is never right but it does happen.  This movie shows one way authorities combatted it that worked.  The bully becomes a friend and all the children learn to respect the differences and even enjoy them.  Cast is great and believable.,1387670400,,241,4.829268292682927
5967186,5,B00F3TD9MO,"Bullying has become such a hot button issue.  Contest examines the topic from a number of angles.  It addresses conflict, redemption, and the challenges of growing up in 2013.  It interjects humor, great music, and has an earnest cast.  While the film is 88 minutes, the real prize is the follow up opportunity to discuss bullying with your family.",1387584000,4,348,4.8474576271186445
8612162,2,B00F3TD9MO,This film was far too slow moving.  I could not keep interested long enough to finish it.,1460851200,,89,4.235294117647059

8612165,3,B00F3TD9MO,"I'm torn about how may Stars to give this movie. It was a good movie, but not especially deep. I did enjoy it. Glad I watched it. It was a new take on an old theme. If you are looking for some casual entertainment, this movie is fine. Like I said, I enjoyed it. Be that said, don't expect any deep moral message or meaning.

I was most interested in seeing Danny Flaherty, who was also one of the lead characters in the USA version of Skins. I was impressed with his preformance in this movie. So far his roles have been bit parts, or in Shorts, or small indie films. I think the kid has potential if he can find the right vehicle.

What can I say, I liked Danny Flaherty and I liked this movie in the context of what it was.",1416182400,,725,4.027777777777778
8612166,5,B00F3TD9MO,"Awesome movie for pre teens and teens! Plus it wasn't boring to watch as an adult either!
I highly recommend this movie to all educators, school principles, etc and I think it should be part of the schools' curriculum to break the ice into getting a dialogue going on bullying!!!",1403136000,2,279,4.6

8612168,5,B00F3TD9MO,"Great story, cast, acting, direction, emotions. A subject that needs to be told, time and again. Bullying is the bullet, Peer pressure is the gun. Betrayal, shame, hurt, and too often suicide is the result. This movie should be required in every teachers class.",1399766400,2,261,4.954545454545454

8612171,5,B00F3TD9MO,"First, Bravo! This movie is a scathing attack on Bullying. it is a movie that many younger people should see. Kenton duty is excellent as the bully in question,Danny Flaherty is excellent as the object of his bullying. There are other events going on under the surface with Danny's grandmother and Kenton's brother which also serve to fuel this movie. the rest of the cast including Katherine McNamara et al are all superb and do a lot of credit to a topic that needs to be brought out in the open. This is handled in a very sweet and sometimes harsh way. As I said Bravo, because even in spite of the difficulty of the subject....you still learn the lesson and smile from time to time. Well worth seeing for the entire family.",1394582400,2,727,4.473684210526316
