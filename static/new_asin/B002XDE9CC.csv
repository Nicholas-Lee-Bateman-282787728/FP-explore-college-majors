4009026,4,B002XDE9CC,"This set is an update of the MYSTIC LANDS set that is also sold here on amazon. So the reviews of that set are applicable to this one. What is new here is an episode on Iran which is not in the same format as the other episodes but which is equally interesting. Comparing the two sets, the advantage of this one is that the episodes seem more clear than the grain in the original set. While not blu-ray quality the video seems better, which is an advantage if you have a large screen and are buying this partially for the opportunity to see distant lands. Another advantage is that these cases are slim cases, less bulky than the original set. Besides owning this set for my personal use, I have found these videos useful in discussions of religion in the Sociology class I teach. If you are interested in cultural and spiritual information, this set is one you may find yourself returning to more than once.",1297900800,10,908,4.4431137724550895
8383634,5,B002XDE9CC,This is a movie very well narrated. Reader's Digest in the documentary focuses on the mystic land of Haiti.  It goes well into depth exploring the cultural beliefs.  Getting inside traditions that we would never have an opportunity to view and try to understand was amazing.  The symbolism of Vodou and comparisons of religion and spiritual and energy beliefs was very well done.  Hatian Vodou really is mysterious to most people.  The film maker did a good job in such a short film in getting to different places showing much of the countryside of the country.  We would have liked the film to mention the names of places rather than just showing them so folks would know what the places were.  The film did not really mention the Anasazi or explain them much.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND for a short introduction to Haiti and Vodou..,1505692800,,825,4.72027972027972

8383637,5,B002XDE9CC,This is a very well done documentary about the religion of Vodou in Haiti. It is a relatively short film that does a pretty good job explaining the roots of Haitian Vodou. The film focuses on the vodoun religion and the importance that it holds within the daily life of the followers.,1472515200,,284,4.480769230769231
8383638,2,B002XDE9CC,I don't recall them saying much about Anasazi and why do they always have to have a foreigner narrate stories about others?  Seems like it would be best from the people who best know the culture.,1447113600,,195,4.416666666666667
8383639,4,B002XDE9CC,Good document. It would be better if in Bluray format.,1419552000,,54,4.5
8383640,5,B002XDE9CC,Great scenery and clear pictures. I love this for relaxing and travel as I won't go to many places while I'm alive so this is a good way to do it!,1410048000,,146,3.7419354838709675
8383641,1,B002XDE9CC,"I think another more appealing country could have been picked on this one. This is about pure poverty and Voodoo and their beliefs. A must see place would be more like ancient ruins and castles. I was hoping it would be like Western Civilization: Pyramids,
or Eastern Civilizations like the Aztecs and the Mayans. I do not recommend this movie unless you want to look at poverty in our world and people just beating on drums!",1391472000,,425,4.605263157894737
8383642,4,B002XDE9CC,"I'm pleased with the manner in which this short documentary approaches Haiti and it's beliefs and customs. While the tendency to focus on Haiti's troubles is irresistible to any filmmaker or author, and this is no exception to that, the information is pretty accurate and provides a correct portrayal of Haitian life.

Granted, life from Port au Prince to Jacmel and into the somewhat remote villages, can be drastically different. And those differences were not really touched on, but given the short amount of time, I think they did quite well showing the reality. The only thing I would have liked is for more emphasis on Haiti's beauty. We saw the National Cathedral in Port au Prince (now in ruins from the 2010 earthquake), Bassin Bleu in Jacmel, and some of the mountains, but Haiti is really such a beautiful land, it is a shame to not show the stunning beauty that is there. And since the video is of the ""must-see places"", one would think that more recognition would be given, or even mention of the locations which were shown in the video.

Other than that, I think it is not a bad film. A great way to visit much of Haiti is with the Academy of Haitian Language and Culture which does immersion programs into the language and culture, and focuses on showing a lot of Haiti's countryside to visitors from around the world.[...]",1360627200,3,1338,4.665254237288136
