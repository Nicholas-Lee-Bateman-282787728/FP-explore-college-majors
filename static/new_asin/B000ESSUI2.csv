8316442,5,B000ESSUI2,"This film is truly amazing. A very unique plot and an amazing cast which which was able to bring the story to life in an emotionally moving and artistic way. It was a very well-written and captivating film which I enjoyed particularly because of how realistic it was. The story was able to squeeze the truth out of the city of Los Angeles which is all too often misrepresented in films. The directing, writing, cinematography, and the score of this film are all outstanding. A solid five out of five stars.",1419897600,2,506,4.571428571428571
