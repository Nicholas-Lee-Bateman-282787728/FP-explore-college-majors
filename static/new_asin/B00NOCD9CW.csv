8679500,5,B00NOCD9CW,Good movie; though I was confused for almost the first 30 minutes.,1449446400,,66,4.583333333333333
8679501,5,B00NOCD9CW,"This is a feel good movie! If you are a fan of the book...the movie captures its essence, but has a lot of new additions that definitely enhance the main story. Don't worry...you will still see fan favorite scenes and lines from the book!

The movie is about Athena Dizon, a teenage lass new to her school and ends up inadvertently playing a trick on the campus bad boy, Kenji delos Reyes (hence a ""gangster""). To make up for her mistake, she has to pretend to be his girlfriend to win his ex-girlfriend back. What starts as a pretend relationship turns into one of the greatest loves they could ever imagine...the chemistry between Daniel Padilla and Kathryn Bernardo is undeniable and if you were not a fan before...you will be now after viewing the movie.",1415836800,,758,4.614814814814815
8679502,5,B00NOCD9CW,"Sweet and sour teenager movie, with really great funny scenes, great acting, and magnificent backdrop of Mayon volcano.
Best movie so far IMHO of future Mr. & Mrs. Kathryn and Daniel Padilla.

SPOILER ALERT !!!!!
In reference to Disney's Bridge to Terabithia, I believe that's the only Disney movie I've ever watched where
one of the main characters actually died in the movie.",1415836800,,377,4.984126984126984
8679503,2,B00NOCD9CW,this order was supposed to be English speaking with subtitles. But most of the movie is in the foreign language and there are no subtitles to be seen.,1414108800,,150,4.392857142857143
8679504,5,B00NOCD9CW,"love this movie soooooooooooooooo much. Athena Dizon plays a trick on campus heartthrob and bad boy, gangster, Kenji de los Reyes. Setting up an arrangement to pretend as lovers-to make his ex jealous-they found themselves falling to each other yet falling apart. the ending is sad but am not going to give that away. must see",1411257600,,326,4.839285714285714
