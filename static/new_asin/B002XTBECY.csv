4009463,3,B002XTBECY,"The only thing I found EXTREMELY annoying was the ""narrative"" that was continuously over-riding each scene...I feel like I'm intelligent enough to understand the actions without a monotone voice telling me what is happening.  I would be willing to re-purchase this just to enjoy the story without it.  I have always Liked being able to become a part of the story I was watching but this prevented it therefore taking away the enjoyment from an otherwise excellent production.
Please don't ruin any other stories like you did with this one...shame on you.",1505865600,,554,5.010869565217392

4009501,2,B002XTBECY,"I'm with the minority on this one.  If you're a Dickens fan, you'll enjoy watching this,  I am not.

  There are 2 things I enjoyed.  First the opening credits with the folk art back-drop and light hearted music.  It raises the expectations for the viewer that this is going to be a quirky film with warm-hearted characters delighting you with the escapades of small village life----like Larkrise to Candleford.  But far from it, it's dark and dreary---truly dark like a Dickens film.  The lighting is gloomy and there's not a single person accept for the young doctor and Judy Dench that I would ever care to know.  Alas they can't carry the movie alone.  If there was a chance I'd warm to the doctor's pretty young lady love, it was heavily over-shadowed by her youth being weighed down hopelessly in the care of her siblings after her mother's death and a loveless, cold father.  Their bright personalities cannot dispel the gloom and endless, agitating problems and dislike these people show and have for one another.  And the gossip!  The never-ending gossip, while in another lighter film would be amusing, in this series it's leaves another level of detesting to the abundance already there.

 Which brings me to the second thing I like about the series.  The trailer.  That leads the viewer to run out and buy the movie on the false presumption that this town is filled with lovable and amusing people who will keep them chuckling and delightfully entertained.  Even the bright moments, like the young boy tasting ice-cream for the first time is so swamped in anger-producing family problems----I mean HEAVY problems that ice-cream just isn't going to fix it.  And it's not just his family but also society all around him is unforgiving, unsympathetic and disinterested.  Even the man who helps him is so severe at times, it's hard to appreciate what he's trying to do.  The wealthy Lady who seems to run the town is severe and out to destroy the flame of hope in the boy and any other young person trying to better themselves. Even her makeup is cold and mean. A page right out of a Dickens novel.

This IS the movie. The gossip; the death; the gossip; the never-ending problems; the gossip.  Some happy moments are inserted here and there amongst all the gloom and darkness but it's awkward and feels forced and all the sentiment resulting from the weight of all these burdens can't be overlooked.  The author and director of this movie want you to love this village as the two new people keep insisting they do.  But all I can say is, ""Really????  Why?!?""  As I said, if Dickens' anger inspiring, mean and unlovable plots are your cup of tea.  Drink up; you'll love this series.  I did not.  It's going to Goodwill.",1463702400,2,2726,4.687763713080169

4009528,5,B002XTBECY,"An absolute delight! Superb in every way!
Keeping in mind that I have not read the books this production is based on, I would like to share my review of 2007's Cranford from The Cranford Collection. The BBC, known for high quality, entertaining period drama, did not disappoint. This production has it all. It is absolutely high quality entertainment!
What an amazing cast! Several of this distinguished cast I was familiar with. Others I knew less well or not at all.
Several times throughout the unfolding twists and turns of gossip and the dilemmas resulting from it I kept saying to myself, `why doesn't he just tell Mrs. Rose why he bought the gloves?' Or `why won't they take his/her word instead of assuming the worst?' So I had to keep reminding myself that this takes place in another era and in a community staunchly marked by the lack of change. Evidently being raised elsewhere, and most recently from London, the young doctor had no idea his well-intentioned gestures were being so misconstrued.
Here are some of my observations on a few of the characters:
Miss Pole - the town gossip extraordinaire. What she doesn't know she finds out, and what she doesn't find it out she manufactures. She and sweet Mrs. Forrester were as much to blame for the scandal associated with young Dr. Harrison as was his mischievous friend, Dr. Jack Marshland. Yet neither seemed to either recognize or admit to their part involving Mrs. Rose, nor did anyone else in their little close knit circle - knowing them as they did - consider that things were not altogether as they seemed. Indeed, Mrs. Rose moved in with Miss Pole afterwards, and Miss Pole referred to Dr. Harrison as 'that vile man.' As is so often the case with nosy gossipers, how unfortunate that Miss Pole and Mrs. Forrester did not realize or acknowledge their part in putting such ideas in Mrs. Rose's head to begin with.
Miss Deborah Jenkins - altogether stoical and reserved. While she exhibits Christian graces and promotes them, her friendship seems dependent on whether or not others adhere to her opinions and her ideas of 'proper behavior.' I found her domineering to some degree, coming across as 'it's my way or the highway.' (As when she stated to Captain Brown, upon learning of his opinions on and impending job for the railroad, that their acquaintance was clearly at an end.) There is no doubt she was a good woman at heart, well liked and respected by all who knew her, but altogether too stuffy for my taste.
Lady Ludlow - while Francesca Annis, in her statements in The Making of Cranford, said that she (Lady Ludlow) was a very kind woman, I found her kindness altogether too intermingled with a will to be in control of others' lives and the snobbery so apparent in her class. Snobbery less toward those of a lower station than she, and more toward station and ideas regarding education of the lower class. She clearly believed they should be kept 'under the thumb' of those more fortunate. I also found a part of me feeling great pity for her. As a mother with only one surviving child out of seven, she truly sensed, I believe, that her son cared much less for Hanbury than she was willing to let on. There was a real element of sadness to her demeanor. She was struggling desperately to hold on to a way of life that she knew was destined to disappear.
Harry Gregson - a young boy who cared more for and took more responsibility for his mother and siblings than his worthless, lazy, wandering father. A father who, in his narrow minded ignorance, denounced his son's desire to learn. Harry's inner character and staunch perseverance in the midst of his circumstances proved unswerving, however, and succeeded in winning the admiration of Mr. Carter, Miss Galindo, and, eventually, Lady Ludlow herself. His life circumstances gave him a maturity beyond his years.
Mr. Carter - although he comes across at first as being somewhat harsh, his softer side soon emerges. His devotion to and love for Hanbury often puts him at odds with Lady Ludlow's views and methods. It is in becoming a mentor to Harry that we truly see his compassion show through. I believe he indeed could - as he stated to Lady Ludlow - imagine what it was like to have a son. Upon learning that the poacher on the estate was Harry's father and that Harry was involved, we see his anger. Yet, despite his disapproval, he intervenes on the man's behalf because of his regard for Harry. Harry's love and respect for him grows as he mentors the young man, teaches him to read, and fosters in him a desire for further knowledge. The legacy he passes to Harry impacts not only Harry and his family but future generations as well.
The Tomkinson sisters - it seemed so very evident to me that neither of these ladies could (or would) recognize that Dr. Harrison displayed none of the characteristics of a suitor toward Caroline. His politeness was that of a gentleman only, his show of concern that of a physician only, and his admiration of Sophy was clearly evident to Caroline, if not to Augusta. As I saw Caroline sit idly clutching the infamous valentine, which caused so much unhappiness, I just kept saying, 'lady, you need to get a life!' But then I had to remind myself of the era, and the desperate emotions that so many women in that era surely felt at the lack of, and even remote possibility of, gaining a husband. How unfortunate that an unsigned valentine was attributed to one who never even knew it was sent.
The doctors - Dr. Harrison is absolutely adorable! Handsome, dedicated, a true young gentleman. I found Dr. Morgan's demeanor toward him to be less than satisfactory. When Dr. Harrison arrived later than expected,  there was no 'so glad you're here. I was getting worried.' Instead, only a stern countenance as he pronounced him late. He went to Jem Hearn's house when Dr. Harrison was there to remove the bandages, saying he wondered if he could be of assistance. Really?! How many doctors are required to remove bandages? He obviously wanted to see the outcome. While he asked to shake Dr. Harrison's hand, I would like to have heard a 'you were right and I was wrong.' He even reprimanded Dr. Harrison on 'beginning extremely badly,' reminding him that 'this is Cranford - everything unchanging, perpetual...' He did not seem to welcome new medical procedures that might 'rock the boat' that is Cranford in spite of saving limbs and lives. I also found him lacking in the unfortunate scandal that arose surrounding the young doctor. He apparently refused to even consider Dr. Harrison's pleas of innocence, instead assuming his behavior to be that of less than a gentleman. Why did he not undertake to investigate the situation? I must say Dr. Harrison remained a gentleman through it all; wounded and heartbroken as he was.
Miss Matty - kindness personified. While she admired, depended on, and looked up to her sister, thankfully, she did not exhibit Deborah's stoicism and firmness in her opinions. There is a melancholy sadness about her. Her regret over never having a child, her enduring love for Mr. Holbrook, her continued heartache at having to turn down his proposal so many years earlier, her renewed hopes for the future, snatched away so abruptly. Through it all she remained a true lady who displayed no bitterness. Even in the midst of her devastating financial setback she remained more concerned over the ten shillings owed the butcher than over her own uncertain future. The scene where she recounts to Mary Smith the incident with Peter and why he left home is superb!
Sophy Hutton - a young woman catapulted into the responsibilities of adulthood by the death of her mother. Yet, instead of resenting her lot, we find her devoted to her younger siblings and caring for them with as close to a mother's love as one could have from a sister. She was beautiful inside and out. I would very much have liked to know, at the end, where the young couple made their home. In Return to Cranford, there are absent, as is Dr. Morgan, apparently.
I've given you my opinions of some the characters. Now to give you my opinion of those portraying them. The casting in this production is outstanding! Indeed, the cast members BECAME these characters. I'm not an expert, but I found no performance lacking.
The costumes, the sets, the locations, nothing is found wanting in this pristine production. From humor, to sadness, from long held love, to young love, from privilege, to poverty, this production covers the gamut.
I'll be honest. I have not yet watched the whole Return to Cranford. For me, having gotten so `into' the characters of Cranford, I found the sequel a bit disappointing and lost interest early on. So many of the characters in the first production are missing from that one, and the new ones introduced seem so much less `Cranfordish.' After some time has passed, I'll watch it. But it has a lot to live up to reach the standard of Cranford. I don't think it could be any better.",1438905600,9,8977,4.714194780394653

review of the Elizabeth Gaskell collection because the acting in these three series is tremendous. I certainly don't want my ""mistake"" to color your opinion! Cranford has characters and actors you'll recognize and love, touching story lines, and a snapshot of one English Village that is about to be brought ""kicking and screaming"" into a more modern age. But, these hardy souls, many maidens and widows, put up a good fight to keep their traditions of caring about each other and helping out in a pinch. Lots of love, laughs and tears.

It's almost as much fun to try to name the different movies and series that the various players have been in as it is to watch the various story lines unfold.  A quiet paced, pleasurable description of a small town with people who know and care (in various ways) for each other.  Absolutely love it.",1421193600,2,468,4.470588235294118
4009561,5,B002XTBECY,"I own Lark Rise to Candleford DVDs and saw the preview for Cranford.  When I got Cranford, I was expecting something different....I don't know what?  The first season seemed a little silly at times, and at other times a little depressing.  I kept watching and it quickly became a favorite of mine.  I especially like the 2nd season, ""Return to Cranford"".  The first season seems a bit slow and was hard to get use to, but it began building into a plot, and by the 2nd season was VERY good!  My suggestion is to be patient and keep watching....it gets better and better.  After watching it all the way through, I watched it again later.  The second time was much more enjoyable than the first.  Maybe I finally got use to the era.  Cranford is not like Larkrise to Candleford and NOTHING like Downton Abbey, (it's much earlier than both of these) but if you like Brittish ""period"" dramas, you'll be glad you bought this!",1420502400,7,919,4.515151515151516

I love everything about Amazon, so I was very disappointed to realize that in order to watch season 2, we had to pay for it.  What I do not know is if this is because we are on a free trial basis or is this standard practice on Amazon streaming.  We have never run into this on Netflix.  I can understand that the company needs to make a profit, and I really want these alternative to cable companies to succeed;l  I just wonder if they might consider changing their free shipping offer a bit.  Perhaps offer the free shipping with a limited use of ""within two days.""  Almost everything I order on Amazon arrives in a very timely fashion.  I do not need the two day commitment.

Guys, I gotta admit this series, althouhgh short, is absolutely captivating, which I didn't enjoy era series until I watched Cranford. In the entire show, there is no sex or violence  but will have you enjoying every minute of it with its charm. Just seeing how trivial the drama that occured compaired to todays hustle and bustle is considerably refreshing. How things were handled back then was very different, yet the social aspects of the time were quite similar. A very rare treat. I worried, laughed and cried with these people in such a small town. Every single actor in the series was to be noted, plus I love Judi Dench. The musical score was a force to be roconed with as well.

The performances are excellent, the surroundings pleasing to the eye, and perhaps best of all for me, it is peaceful.  Somewhat lilke a time out from the frenzied filming of contemporary films.  My only complaint, and it's a small one, is that many shots were done with a hand held camera so there is that annoying motion that makes you wish someone with steadier hands had filmed the scenes.

Sadly, it doesn't even come close. There are some familiar faces from Lark Rise but that's where the similarity ends. The story lines are mundane & boring.
Cranford is very bleak & the constant killing off of major characters in every episode put me off this show. There is NO WAY I would want to live in Cranford. I found few people I liked & the group of gossiping old biddies were tiresome.
There is no joy or love of life in this series, just a theme of melancholy & death. A constant pall of darkness, literally & figuratively.
Glad I didn't spend a lot of money for this collection. I'd like to send it back. Doubt I will watch it again & that to me is a waste.",1373414400,4,828,4.213836477987422

4009694,2,B002XTBECY,"I must admit that I wanted to like CRANFORD and expected to be impressed by this series and unfortunately, I found the series to be slow-moving, tedious and uninspired. I read all the reviews and expected a delightful BBC period drama set in a small village in 1840's England. Judi Dench is one of my favorite actresses so knowing she was in the cast was a big plus.

Cranford is a small town in northern England. It seems to have more than its far share of gossiping spinisters and widows. Gossip and social etiquette rule the day and as in many other period pieces the fear of change and a modern world keep the in inhabitants of Cranford slaves to to their cherished routine. It's a common theme that tired quickly. Eligible single men are at a premium in Cranford so imagine the shock and delight to the women as a dashing, young London-educated doctor joins the village. In a sad testament to the times, the eldest daughter of a widowed father is doomed to a life of carrying for her younger siblings and father in his old age. Love can only exist in their hearts and cannot be expressed and enjoyed

In the beginning, Judi Dench has a suprisingly small role as one of two elderly spinster sisters. She is the quiet sister who follows the lead of her elder sibling but fate will intervene shortly. Life is a routine in Cranford. Social visits are strictly regulated while gossping tongues wag widely.

CRANFORD sports many familiar British stars. In addition to Judi Dench, there are Imelda Staunton, Jim Carter (Carson from DOWNTON ABBEY) and Julia Sawalha (ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS). Even a great cast can get stifled in a tedious and slow-moving drama. How much gossip can a village tolerate?

I watched several episodes and just could not continue watching. I couldn't relate to the stories or the characters. Of course, in true BBC fashion, the costumes and setting are stunning. Unfortunately, they cannot save a mundane story. Even the photography is not as vibrant as in other period dramas. Something is sadly missing in CRANFORD for me.",1361750400,8,2046,4.722689075630252
4009695,5,B002XTBECY,"This is the ongoing story of life in a small English country town, centered around a small group of women.

Progress is not always a good thing when it sets out to ""fix"" and destroy a thing that isn't broken to begin with.

It started a little slowly, sort of pocking fun at the stuffiness and narrow ways of the early 1900's way of thinking and not deviating from the past traditions.  However, the series caught my undivided attention, and I watched it all the way through.  It left me wanting even more.  I thouroughly enjoyed this series.  I'm sharing this one with my family, and they are enjoying it too.  Great entertainment.  Judi Dench is as always, the consumate actress.",1355097600,,520,4.775280898876405

What you witness in this series is the incredible endurance of people who deserved the best but repeatedly experienced the worst. A collection of characters as colorful as a rainbow band together in times of great need and woe. But Miss Mattie's story begins to unfold throughout the series, and her kindness and love that never sleeps brought tears to my eyes.",1354924800,,484,4.574712643678161

4009727,4,B002XTBECY,As I expected this was another BBC series that was equivalent to a Soap Opera but set in old England.  The characters were a little exaggerated but fun and the idea of telling a story about such a storybook place was a good one.  The covey of 'aged' women presented some interesting avenues and made watching fun.  Judi Dench did not disappoint but was paired with other actors who matched her performance and provided good entertainment.  If you have seen Lark Creek Rise and Candleford you will no doubt recognize some of the players but that does not diminish what is here.  Overall I would recommend this as a very entertaining sojourn into  a period and to a place that has been crafted with great fondness and care.,1348876800,,721,4.59375

4009741,5,B002XTBECY,"Look friends, There is acting, there is great acting, ensemble acting, and there is acting raised to the level of art.  CRANFORD has them all - in spades.  Cranford is a small town in Industrial Revolution England that has kept itself well away from what Cranford's leading ladies call with horror, modernism.  These ladies are led by Dame Judi Dench, Eileen Atkins, Imelda Staunton and other women of such formidable talent that they have been honoured by the Queen with the title, Dame.  However, time is a march, and leading its parade that threatens Cranford's way of life is THE RAILWAY!

CRANFORD is a series of films made in co-production by BBC and PBS. , from the novels of Elizabeth Gaskell.  The photography, the colour, costumes, music and dialogue are nothing short of flawless,as is the direction and editing  The performances draw - almost seduce -  the viewer into the heart of CRANFORD's charm.  You might think it silly, but these Ladies of CRANFORD believe whole heartedly in the niceties of their carefully constructed customs for good living: In CRANFORD, one ""receives"" between noon and three pm.  No person of respectability stays for more than fifteen minutes, and one must not return a visit until the third day.  Naturally they hear tales of society in London, but immediately remind their guest that ""This is not London, this is CRANFORD.  The delicacy of courting, the rigid customs surrounding death, are held to be sacrosanct, and all are lived out with grace and favour.

If you haven't yet bought CRANFORD, as I have, from AMAZON, Do so immediately, then unplug your phones,silence your devices, and set yourself up for a genuine heart-filling treat.

4009742,5,B002XTBECY,"I absolutely LOVE this rendition of Elizabeth Gaskell's characters of the town of Cranford. It really shows the close nit atmosphere and friendly neighborly affection. It also shows the class lines and how they were starting to dissolve even before the world wars started. I just get lost in this world that was over a century before my time. The costumes, characters, directing, the set, everything was absolutely breath taking. This is a keeper, I have already watched it 3 times and had to purchase Return to Cranford because I loved this one so much!!

4009744,4,B002XTBECY,"The only reason I am knocking off a star here is because of the follow-up/sequel, Return to Cranford. The original series is great, intermingling humor with fantastic period acting and scenery, making for a classic BBC production. It's also a good length - 5 episodes.

Return to Cranford, while still fun, is decidedly of a lower quality, returning only some of the characters that made the first series so fantastic. We enjoyed it still, but not nearly as much as the original.",1334707200,,479,4.841463414634147

There isn't a false note in the script, a bad actor, a costume or landscape that doesn't catch the eye.

4009748,5,B002XTBECY,"I've read some reviews on this series, though they are overwhelmingly positive.  I started watching this based on a recommendation since I enjoyed Downton Abbey.  Though this is set about 70 years earlier, it still has a stately British pace and feel.

Cranford is an interesting town seemingly stuck in a time warp.  They abhor change and stick to tradition like glue.  The town also seems to be run by women, which is interesting for the setting, but it is explained very early on that women in the village hold the property rights.  So there we have it.

The series is based on a novel by Elizabeth Gaskell and serialized in the magazine Household Words, which was edited by Charles Dickens. (huh!)  So the novel was written very near the time period in which it takes place, which makes the incidents and interactions very realistic.

The cast is all around terrific.  Judi Dench is wonderful, though early on it's tough to really see her in this role.  After about halfway through the first episode she owns it.  The other cast members are all very talented and the characters are life like and have their own unique personalities.  I very much enjoyed the lady who is constantly carried around in a palanquin with a fuzzy white dog.

The incidents that occur are all very tastefully portrayed.  It is overall a sad yet hopeful series that lasts only 7 episodes.  But 7 episodes are sufficient to tell this tale and tell it well.

So if you are looking for a nice and quiet, stately British drama with terrific acting, then this is a nice choice.  We don't have sinister villains or diabolical plots like in Downton Abbey or other modern British period dramas (unless you count 'change' as a villain).  Instead we have a slice of life as it was in this secluded village in 1840s England.  Bravo!",1325635200,,1800,4.636075949367089

The sets are amazing, there is a special feature that gives background on how they achieved such wonderful effects, and the characters are both funny and sympathetic.  The writers did a credible job creating a plot by weaving together several books by Elizabeth Cranford and I sat down in front of the TV eager for more every night I watched the shows. It was maybe because the shows are based on several books, however, that there are a number of plot jumps that are never explained, or maybe it was instead a lack of time.  Either way I found it jarring--how did Mattie's maid and her beau decide to marry when last we saw they were fighting about it, and was Miss Galindo able to secure Henry Gregson's inheritance, I couldn't be sure. Still, as I said, I loved the shows and based on them I've started reading Elizabeth Gaskell's novels which, unsurprisingly, give more context.",1318377600,3,1030,4.679558011049724

The plots are multithreaded, which helps for the modern American viewer that is used to such.

Not possible to get past select all. I will not return it as the postage from New Zealand is more than the purchase cost. Never the less this is the first product that I have purchased from you to be faulty. That does not mean I am happy because I am not. As far as I am concerned it should be replaced free of charge, but when you live so far away from the seller it is not possible to deal direct so you feel you have been cheated.",1303689600,2,639,3.923076923076923

4009775,5,B002XTBECY,"I thoroughly enjoy reading about eighteenth century England, Scotland and Ireland, so watching Cranford: The Collection was amazing and brought all the characters to life.  Of course, any project that Dame Judi Dench is involved in is top notch!  The English have a marvelous way of presenting a story that actually has something meaningful to share with the audience.  Cranford involves twists and turns that you do not necessarily expect, keeps your interest throughout, and leaves you with that feeling of a time long since gone by, when life was a bit simpler. I was originally hesitate to purchase this DVD because I thought it would just be about a group of old ""hens"" in a small town in England - well, it is about a group of old ""hens"" in a small English town, but they are a feisty group of women who do what is right rather than what is convenient. Hmmm - something to think about. It's well worth the time to watch!!",1303084800,3,927,4.572289156626506

4009777,5,B002XTBECY,"Did you ever wonder what it would be like to live in a community of ladies? Elizabeth Gaskill wrote about a small town in England populated by women of all walks of society in the 1800s. This film adaptation visits the world of Cranford, home of Miss Mattie and Miss Deborah, spinster sisters who lived together in a home of frugality and modesty. I read the book and was excited to see the film on Masterpiece Theater. I was not disappointed. It combines the stories of several of Gaskill's works, it makes the film better, which is usually not the case of other works made into movies in which the story is changed for the sake of the movie. I thought Judi Dench's protrayal of Miss Mattie deserved an award. The other actors did wonderful jobs with their characters and both the collection (Cranford/Return to Cranford) transported me back to a simpler time and a place where people truly cared for one another. I am glad I bought this collection and can watch it anytime I want to escape to Cranford. The price was good and the delivery right on time.",1301529600,2,1055,4.528795811518324

The acting is superb and the settings, costumes, et al,  as true to 1830 's England as human;y possible. As you view the DVDs, you will find yourself removed from this world and totally emersed in that era and relating to those remarkable people as if you, yourself, actually lived in Cranford at that time. As a history buff for many years, I was amazed at how much more I learned about the way people lived in those days. I have introduced more than a dozen men and women to these and have yet to hear a negative comment about either DVD. We all fell in love with the strong women and gentle men so aptly portrayed by the very talented actors. They protray their characters so well that at the end you are hard pressed to recall who the actors were but you will never forget the characters they played.
Our local libraries have their own sets which continually have long waiting lists of borrowers requesting them.  The wait can be several months; owning your own set is ideal. Although I did not request any kind of express delivery, my DVD's arrived from Amazon most expediently.
Had I not been able to purchase this set at the sale price that Amazon recently offered, it would still have been worth every penny of the original purchase price. I know that I will be treasuring these classic tales for years and years and viewing them over and over again. Having enjoyed CRANFORD and CRANFORD, THE RETURN so very much.

Cranford and Return to Cranford (RTC) is enjoyable not only for it's acting, but for it's excellent writing. The adaptation of Elizabeth Gaskell's novel about a small village with little outside influence, and it's growing pains when old ways begin to change, specifically when faced with the development of the railroad, is consistent and true to the story.

As expected for this period, the class system based on the remnants of the feudal system is ever present between the relationships of the townspeople and the aristocrats. Propriety, appearances, and societal rules forever rule the lives of the 19th century Briton. Cranford/RTC will draw you in and immerse you in the conflicts, misunderstandings, and joys of its characters.

4009820,4,B002XTBECY,"Having long been a fan of Regency-era costume dramas that tend toward the romantic, my journey into the small English town of Cranford, circa 1842 -- with a passion for the smaller domestic dramas of life -- was a fresh and uncharted voyage. Based upon 19th century novelist Elizabeth Gaskell's work, this BBC mini-series is a conglomeration of Gaskell's adapted novellas; not only Cranford itself, but also My Lady Ludlow, and Mr. Harrison's Confessions.

The town of Cranford in the North West of England in 1842 is poised on the brink of change. Long governed by an unusually high population of older, single women, its culture revolves around propriety and social calls. The slightest hint of change in fashions, residence, or circumstance prompts a torrent of talk. Still, despite the oft-times virulent stream of misunderstandings and troubled times, Cranford is a town with deeply held friendships and strong loyalties.

Cranford: The Collection is a beautiful two-volume boxed set that includes both the original Cranford with five parts on two DVDs, and the two parts of Cranford: Return to Cranford on a single DVD. With each episode running approximately 1 hour and 20 minutes, this is no lightweight drama; Cranford: The Collection boasts a total running time of 468 minutes, excluding each volume's ""making of"" segment with insights into the writing process, filming, period costumes, and more.

Performed by an absolutely dazzling cast of British talent, Cranford fairly soars on the wings of its talented ensemble. Peopled with many well-recognized actors - Eileen Atkins, Alex Jennings, Michael Gambon, and many others - the centerpiece of Cranford's heart is Judi Dench's portrayal of Miss Matty. Dench is absolutely luminous in her tender portrayal of the uncertain, loyal, and incredibly tender Matty

When a new, young, bachelor doctor arrives in Cranford, the residents are atwitter with flights of romantic speculation both actual and unfounded. Dr. Harrison is certainly a central focus of the original Cranford but the complex and rich sub-plots involving Captain Brown and his daughters, the plight of Harry's impoverished family, Matty's losses and discoveries, and the lively antics of Mrs. Forrester and Miss Pole create a vibrant tapestry of the timeless concerns of life.

Return to Cranford further explores the lives of the town's beloved residents though some characters seem to be missing with little explanation. A new set of troubles besets the residents with the rapidly approaching railway, the demise of Lady Ludlow, and the troubled courtship between William Buxton (son of the local salt mine owner) and Peggy Bell. Featuring much of the core cast of the originalCranford some favorites are now missing due to demise or supposed relocation. This second series is somewhat darker than the first, with less outright jollity and absurdity - nothing can replace or supersede the original.

While the core of Cranford's life is a core of spinsters and widows who thrive on propriety, stability, and social niceties, it would be a misconception to believe that the series is anchored in the lives of the town's older citizens. Rather, a broad spectrum of players are present from the youthful and romantic to the passed by and disappointed.

The emotional depth of the series encompasses both fresh undertakings and bittersweet reminiscences as seen through the town's wealth of female citizens. This balanced, broad perspective prevents Cranford from becoming a period Grumpy Old Men for women, and dramatically transcends it, becoming a deeply felt, authentic drama that appeals to all ages; it is truly excellent family viewing.

I regularly discard DVD packaging in order to save shelf space, but Cranford: The Collection is so beautifully packaged that I doubt I'll be able to part with this sturdy box set. Not only is the box itself sturdier than most, but each DVD case resembles a hardcover book - truly lovely.

A voyage to the reclusive town of Cranford is a richly rewarding experience. The combination of jaunty humor, small-town community spirit, and thrumming emotional undercurrents result in a captivating small-screen experience that rivals that of any large-screen production. It is in the details that Cranford truly comes to life, the small yet meaningful gestures of kind-heartedness, historical authenticity, and care for the smallest nuances. I highly recommend you to experience this special community for yourself.",1266451200,38,4475,5.300423131170663
4009821,5,B002XTBECY,"For those of you who love the romantic and proper days of the Victorian era, this series is for you! These are the days when men courted women, and women dreamed of marrying, raising children and running a household. Men were chivalrous and proper and women were classy with impecible manners. It's a shame, sometimes, that progress happens, because these are times when innocence and virtue were not bad things. Just the tiny events that happen in Cranford were made much bigger by reactions, overreactions, gossip and horrible misunderstandings. Not to mention, the very saddest times were overcome by family support, deep and lasting friendships, and a deep faith in God and, well, kindness to one's fellow man. Judi Dench is wonderful, as are most of the lesser-known cast members (although there are several well-known actors who are superb - Imelda Staunton being one). Wonderful on a cold Saturday or Sunday night when nothing is on cable.",1266451200,23,946,5.031847133757962

There are times of great humor, sorrow, anticipation, and drama. Very well-rounded story with great character development and a deliciously written plot describing life in the 1840s. As a history major I can attest that the costumes and customs shown are completely accurate, for those of you who care. Even my fiance enjoyed watching this- we watched all 5 episodes the night I got it. Then we watched them all over again the second. He like it so much he was the first to ask if we could buy the ""Return to Cranford""- and all this coming from a 27 year old male I find quite quixotic. We are both big fans of historical and period films. This tops our list! We recognized many of the actors/actresses and all of them work wonderfully together. Overall, couldn't ask for anything more!

Cranford (2008)

Cranford aka the Cranford Chronicles, based on Elizabeth Gaskell's story is a stellar production. It is a lush period drama and is very authentic in its portrayal of people living in a little hamlet called Cranford. The sets are beautiful as are the costumes, and of course the production is elevated to a level of excellence by its impeccable casting. Writer Heidi Thomas does a wonderful job of adapting Elizabeth Gaskell's story [purportedly based on Gaskell's own hometown] and though liberties are taken, the stellar cast more than makes up for whatever deficiencies there may be in the faithfulness of the adaptation. Dame Eileen Atkins [Miss Deborah Jenkins] and Dame Judi Dench [Miss Matty Jenkins] portray two spinster sisters in 1842 who live in the little town of Cranford. Far from being a quiet little hamlet, this little town hums with activity and village gossips, especially a Miss Pole [Imelda Staunton]who flits around from one hearsay to another, avidly passing on any little nuggets of gossip to the other inhabitants.

Cranford is set aflutter by the arrival of a new doctor, Dr Harrison [Simon Woods] who is young, handsome, single and very much into trying new methods of treatment, to the initial consternation of the townspeople. Dr Harrison finds himself attracted to a beautiful local lass, Sophy [Kimberly Nixon] though he inadvertently attracts the romantic affections of other single women in Cranford. But the story does not merely focus on romance, as there are other more serious themes underlying the series. For one, there is talk of a railroad being built that would go through Cranford, and disrupt the idyllic life in the village, giving rise to the inevitable battle between modernization and the desire for things to remain unchanged. The local rich lady, Lady Ludlow portrayed by Francesca Annis is very much opposed to change, and not only opposes the railroad but also any form of societal change, such as literacy amongst the lower classes [she refuses to hire a maid who is literate, saying the girl's parents did her a disservice by teaching her to read].

There is also the theme of lost love, death and grief. Miss Matty Jenkins[ Judi Dench] finds herself recounting the tale of her lost love [played by Michael Gambon]. This is what makes Cranford such an engaging viewing experience - the absurd [the story of the cat swallowing an antique lace and how the lace is retrieved] is interlaced with tales of poignancy and everything unfolds leisurely. It is a tale that we wish will never end, and hope to revisit again and again.

This is not really a sequel (though some story arcs from the original do get developed here), but a 2-part special that is inspired in part by Cranford, and also two other stories by author Elizabeth Gaskell, i.e. ""The Moorland Cottage"", and also ""The Cage at Cranford"", see Three Tales of Cranford: Cranford, The Cage at Cranford, and The Moorland Cottage. Besides the familiar and beloved cast of the original Cranford such as Miss Matty (Dame Judi Dench), Miss Pole (Imelda Staunton), Mrs Forrester (Julia McKenzie), Miss Tomkinson (Deborah Findlay), etc. several new characters are introduced, such as Lady Glenmire (played by Celia Imrie), and the conjuror Signor Brunoni(Tim Curry).

The first part is set in summer 1844 - it has been two years since dear Miss Matty (Dame Judi Dench in another luminous portrayal) lost her beloved sister Deborah, and a year since Sophy Hutton married Dr Harrison (these two characters are no longer in this show). Miss Matty seems content with the presence of her brother Peter (Nicholas Le Prevost) who is home from India, and helps look after Tilly, the baby of her maid Martha and carpenter Jem Hearne. The continuity from the original Cranford is seen in the railway project which still looms menacingly over the town. Things are also made more exciting with the arrival of Mr. Buxton, a wealthy widower who lives with his ward Erminia (Michelle Dockery) and his son William (Tom Hiddleston who is quite the eye candy). Life in Cranford is always full of surprises and when Lady Ludlow's long absent son Septimus (Rory Kinnear) arrives, things take unexpected turns, precipitated by a tragedy in the family. The old tensions are there - especially between those that are against the railroad project and those ,like Captain Brown and young William who feel that modernization is essential to Cranford's long-term survival. Miss Matty, in her usual subtle fashion, gets involved in some of these village proceedings, with some rather startling results.

The second part is set later in the year 1844, October up till Christmas - Miss Matty and her friends are predictably excited at the visit of Lady Glenmire (Celia Imrie) but when Mrs Jamieson (Barbara Flynn) feels no one amongst her peers is of suitably high rank to meet her, she and Lady Glenmire get snubbed by Matty and company and it is left to Lady Glenmire to set things right in a most memorable way. Matty also faces some challenges that involves a falling out amongst her circle of friends,a serious romance between William and a young woman deemed unsuitable by his father (which has Matty pondering the wisdom of her 'involvement' in bringing the pair together), and more tragedy on the horizon, affecting the citizens of Cranford.

A fair note of warning - this particular installment in the Cranford franchise is much more subdued than the original and there's quite a fair bit of tragedy - there's death (involving a couple of familiar characters who were also in the original), grief, tension, family drama, imperiled friendships, the age-old battle between those opposed to change and those who embrace the challenges of modernization, etc., but there's also romance and lighthearted moments. However, I can understand how this particular follow-up might disappoint purists who loved the original and how well it adhered to Gaskell's novel.  Personally, I loved the original Cranford and thought it was a superior production, and though I like RTC, the plot is not as engaging as the original. As for the production qualities - they are excellent. The cinematography is gorgeous, capturing the beauty of the village surroundings as well as the period details, and the score complements the story perfectly. For the price offered here, this boxed set is value for money (I am getting this for my aunt as I've already purchased the two productions separately).",1263427200,125,6515,5.013863216266174

8383822,5,B002XTBECY,"Judi Dench is wonderful in this. A nice simple life in a small town in the 1800s in England. If youve never lived in a small town (anywhere) .....this is the way to experience it. Everyone knows everyone or is related to everyone and if you're not then you're automatically suspicious and a curiosity until you win over everyone. Simple, lovely story.",1518912000,,351,4.67741935483871

8383826,5,B002XTBECY,"Surrendering to a temporary illness such as a cold or the recovery process during times of grief are the times I will hide out in my den with the curtains closed and I cue up historical documentaries and dramas. My most recent endeavor led me down the path to ""Cranford'. While I've only just finished the first season, I'm madly in love with the characters who somehow managed to capture my heart and soul in the first episode of season one. By the final episode, I'd gone through a box of tissue while crying at the startling losses of life and fortune; things that today in a modern society would seem unthinkable but were commonplace 200 years ago. Something as simple as ""light"" for an operation that is routinely done in hospitals a hundred times a day, to the horrible loss of opportunity because one is educated enough to read and write, but unable to achieve a different status in life because of their gender or who their parents are.

Each character has his or her own agenda, watching the ladies of Cranford interact in an age where placing an exclamation point in a note was considered ""extraordinary"" is funny, endearing and often frustrating. The intensity of every noble (or not so noble) face made me crave a simpler time when that intensity was considered a common element of knowing someone, rather than a character defect.

These people are flawed to perfection. And Dame Judith Olivia Dench is superb as always.",1508198400,,1432,4.701195219123506
