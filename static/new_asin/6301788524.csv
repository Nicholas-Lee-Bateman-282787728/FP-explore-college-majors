7815573,5,6301788524,Excellent for introduction to Music to all . Great performance of the music and Peter Ustinov reading.,1457654400,,102,5.0588235294117645
7815574,4,6301788524,This was my daughter's favorite in-the-car story (read by Peter Ustinov) on cassette when she was little. I was delighted to find this out-of-print book and even a Ustinov-read DVD for my granddaughter. This was likely the origin of my daughter's interest in performing music and her subsequent music education. Great book for music basics.,1397952000,,340,5.2
7815575,5,6301788524,"I, who have spent time reading books about the instruments/orchestration, learned a few things from this!  It's primarily meant for children to get them interested in music, and I think it really does do that well.  But even if you, like I, already have quite a bit of knowledge about the different instruments, it is still fun to watch, especially because Peter Ustinov can make such simple text sound so colorful :-) .  Peter Ustinov was actually trained in music.",1272067200,3,466,4.8
7815576,5,6301788524,"This delightful video includes the gorgeous water color illustrations from the book, plus Peter Ustinov's erudite narration, and samples of all of the instruments of the orchestra actually playing famous passages that feature them.  It's fabulous, and should not be allowed to go out of print.  It needs to be on DVD and available to every child as an introduction to the orchestra!",1107907200,18,382,5.0476190476190474
