8603273,2,B002HT5RFK,"I ordered this video as I recently started cracking whips.  The man who stars in this video may know a lot about fighting and martial arts, but when he picks up a whip, he reminds me of Joe Piscopo from the karate movie, Sidekicks.  This whip instructor looks like he is just swinging wildly about as he attempts to show different strikes with the whip.  In theory he has some good information, but the execution is less than poor.  In comparison with several other cracking videos I recently received, the professional crackers show much more finesse and fluid movement and frankly I would be much more frightened to attack one of them than this guy.  As I said, he really knows how to fight, but I would recommend he take some lessons on how to crack and then re-shoot his video.  I was disappointed with this video.",1283817600,,818,4.530612244897959
