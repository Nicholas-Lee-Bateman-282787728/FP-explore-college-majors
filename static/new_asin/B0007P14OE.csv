2226104,4,B0007P14OE,"Season 4 is a very good season with plenty of action and suspense. Unlike other seasons, the main storyline continues to grow until the very end. Cloe and Edgar play great analysts for CTU and the return of Tony and Michelle alleviates the ""newness"" of CTU.

Season 4 lacked the strong performances of antagonists of Seasons 1-3: People who we loved to hate such as George Mason, Ryan Chapelle, & Sherri Palmer.

It seems that the writers have exhausted their storylines and techniques. The events did not have that shock factor anymore.

Hopefully the new writers that have signed on will have a new, fresh angle on Season 5 that will have the viewers hooked again, as always.

Here are my rankings:

1. Season 2

2. Season 1

3/4. Season 3 & 4

The most intense span of television I have ever seen was the first half of season 2 which was about the chase for the nuclear bomb. From the time that Jack returns to CTU, getting back his cover with Joseph Wald's crew, and the numerous characters and their uncertainty with the nuclear attack: Reza Nayer, the Warners, Saed Ali. Although season 2 was not the most balanced: the secondary stories were weak (i.e. Kim Bauer), the ending was a little weak.... in terms of raw storyline, suspense, and excitement, nothing hooked me in more than the chase & disposal of the nuke in LA. The scene where Nina Myers walked back into CTU with handcuffs and chains on for questioning was bone chilling.",1126483200,3,1440,4.59765625
2226105,4,B0007P14OE,"I have been an advit fan of this show since the beginning.  It has good acting and plots.  I am a fan of Jack Bauer (Keifer) and President David Palmer (Dennis Haysbert)whom I hope will get re-elected for Season 5.  The show appears to have what I would consider realism.  As never had/wanted to work in the White House and not having a great deal of understanding of all policies/politics that go on, using plain old common sense and what I remember from government in school helps to relate to the known evil situations Jack finds himself in and the actions he is willing to undertake to help his country.  I do wish the writers would have kept him with Kate.  Daughter Kim get's on your nerves in Season 1 and 2,3 - she appeared a little immature for her age and having a father who is an agent.  Cloe who is a computer wiz wears on your nerves also, but she is growing on me as of Season 4.  She respects Jack and supports his actions most of the time.  I really like the interaction of Jack Bauers co-workers at CTU (Counter Terrorist Unit) and hope that the remaining original cast stays in place. Like the character Tony Almeda and that he married his co-worker and I really liked the plot of his saving her and risking his job. In Season 3/4 the situation was reversed and his wife went along with policy/procedure and I have to admit it may have been the right thing to do in the long run - but I wanted her to give up everything for him also.  But in Season 4 they are repairing their relationship and thanks to David Palmer, Mr. and Mrs. Tony Almede and Cloe they save Jack's life from the Chinese and government agency representative (aka: HITMAN).  The world believes Jack to be dead. He is on his way with a new identity crossing the border until he is again needed.  One of the best shows on television to watch.",1126310400,2,1827,4.325513196480938
2226106,5,B0007P14OE,"I have been a 24 fan since the series premiered & I must say this past 4th season has been not only its best season, but the best season of drama tv I have ever seen. I don't say that lightly-I'm a big fan of other shows such as Nip/Tuck, The West Wing, Lost, Rescue Me, Over There, and House. The concept of 24 is simple: it follows a day in the life of superagent Jack Bauer in real time. Here is a concise episode guide following the events in Jack's day in Season 4-

(7 AM - 8 AM) Jack returns to CTU, where he was formerly director, to discover a train explosion which he believes to be a diversionary target.

(8 AM - 9 AM) Jack gets reinstated by CTU when the Secretary of Defense is kidnapped. His only lead is a hacker who hacked into the terrorists' database.

(9 AM - 10 AM) The terrorists get to the hacker first and Jack has no choice but to follow them.

(10 AM - 11 AM) To buy time for a satellite tracker, Jack is forced to delay the terrorist by robbing the grocery store he's in.

(11 AM - 12 PM) Jack's diverson is successful as the terrorist leads Jack to the compound where the Secretary of Defense and his daughter Audrey are held.

(12 PM - 1 PM) Against orders, Jack infiltrates the compound in a dramatic rescue. Meanwhile, CTU learns that the kidnapping was a diverson & the terrorists plan to melt all the nuclear plants in the continental US.

(1 PM - 2 PM) Now safe, Audrey, also Jack's girlfriend, goes with Jack to try and ID one of the men she recognized when held captive. Soon afterwards, they get ambushed and Jack relies on his old friend Tony Almeida to help them.

(2 PM - 3 PM) Temporarily safe, they make an ID on Audrey's captors.

(3 PM - 4 PM) Jack and Tony follow up on the lead, where they meet a reluctant Dina and Behrooz Araz.

(4 PM - 5 PM) In hopes of finding the terrorists ultimately responsible, Tony interrogates Dina.

(5 PM - 6 PM) Dina reveals the orchestrator of the terrorists' plans-a man named Marwan. Jack also learns the location of the override device to prevent the nuclear plants from melting down.

(6 PM - 7 PM) Jack heads over to Marwan's employers, whom decide to destroy evidence in order cut their ties to the day's events.

(7 PM - 8 PM) Jack has some help as he fends off the mercenaries sent to kill him.

(8 PM - 9 PM) Jack orchestrates a mock-hostage situation so he can get close to Marwan.

(9 PM - 10 PM) Now kidnapped, Jack is released when his kidnappers plan a trade to buy time for their contingency plan.

(10 PM - 11 PM) CTU raids Marwan's compound only to have him escape. Things get even worse as the terrorists shoot down Air Force One.

(11 PM - 12 AM) Jack and Marwan struggle to obtain the nuclear launch codes that dropped from the plane.

(12 AM - 1 AM) A suspect is brought in with information about Marwan's plans & Jack has to use alternative methods to extract the information.

(1 AM - 2 AM) Jack's latest efforts at finding Marwan are stalled by the Secret Service.

(2 AM - 3 AM) Jack illegally breaks into the Chinese Consulate to extract a man who knows Marwan's whearabouts.

(3 AM - 4 AM) Jack gets closer to finding Marwan as the terrorists launch a nuclear missle.

(4 AM - 5 AM) Jack captures Marwan only to find him uncooperative. Meanwhile, an unexpected lead pops up from the Secretary of Defense's son.

(5 AM - 6 AM) Jack follows up on the lead as the Chinese Consulate discovers what happened on their grounds.

(6 AM - 7 AM) The lead pays off as she reveals both the whereabouts of Marwan & the location of the missile. Though the terrorist plans are thwarted, Jack is ultimately forced to feign his death to prevent his capture by the Chinese. As the season wraps up, Jack Bauer must take on a new identity.",1126224000,4,3724,4.234794908062235
2226107,5,B0007P14OE,"The fourth season of 24 returned to it's roots.  This is my second favorite season of 24.  Here is my list:

1. Season One

2. Season Four

3. Season Two

4. Season Three

Jack is back and has a formidable advesary to go against.  What I liked about this season is that there is one constant bad guy.  In season one, there are two bad guys.  In season two, there isn't really a bad guy identified until the final episodes and he wasn't all that hateable.  In season three, you couldn't tell who the bad guy was.

Plenty of twists and turns in Season 4 (just like Season 1).  Best thing may be no Kim, no Kim getting kidnapped, no Kim working at CTU and finally, no Kim.  Did I mention that Kim isn't on Season 4???  I hated Chase too, so no Chase is fine.

Great drama featuring the best hero on television.  Jack makes several controversial decisions that effect his personal life.  This is a must purchase.",1126137600,8,908,4.272189349112426
2226108,5,B0007P14OE,"i never watched the first 3 seasons of 24. I knew it was a show on tv but never got the time to tune in and watch. I started to watch 23 in the middle of the 4th season and the whole show just captured me.

The suspense in 24 is so amazing that it makes you keep watching and watching and making sure u do everything u can to watch the next hour.

The way that it is directed and the storyline are pure juenius keeping you on the edge of your seat. In my opinion the 3rd season of 24 is the best but the 4th was just as good.

The advancement of the show (technology is amazing) making it seem so real.",1125878400,4,602,3.8
2226109,3,B0007P14OE,"While '24': Season 4 was exciting when compared to the other stuff that's on television, it cannot be compared to the compelling, addicting, and suspenseful first three seasons. Here's why:

-The Plot: What was it? Every four or five episodes it changed, and evil mastermind Habib Marwan was able to pull off everything he wanted (while narrowly escaping CTU's grasp every few episodes) in 24 hours.

-The Characters: Not only were the new characters introduced in Season 4 bland and cardboard (with a few exceptions), characters from previous seasons who returned occupied boring subplots that made '24' seem more like a soap opera than an action/drama show at points.

-The Music: Sean Callery does a wonderful job composing energetic and fitting music for '24'. However, the quality significantly dropped in the show's fourth season. Most of the music seemed more like background noise than anything, and the good compositions were just reused from previous seasons.

-""Events occur in real time"": At the beginning of Seasons 1-3, Jack would remind the audience that everything in the show occurs in real time; i.e. 1 minute in the show = 1 minute in real life and each episode = 1 hour in real life. However, the famous saying ""Events occur in real time"" was excluded from Season 4's premiere, and after watching the entire season, I know why. Jack and friends are able to get anywhere from anywhere by car in one commercial break (approximately 4.5 real time minutes). Every episode had its share of characters magically warping from one place to another.

-Split Screens: Or lack thereof. Except during phone conversations, Season 4 doesn't contain a whole lot of concurrent screens depicting multiple stories at a time.

If you loved and were addicted to the first three seasons of '24', you'll probably like Season 4, albeit you may be disappointed for the reasons I listed above.",1125792000,12,1888,4.996815286624204
2226110,5,B0007P14OE,"Season 4 goes back to what made 24 one of the best shows on TV- nonstop edge of your seat story with no boundaries. If you don't expect something to happen, it probably will.",1125705600,5,174,4.147058823529412
2226111,5,B0007P14OE,"Ever since season 4 ended, I've been waiting and waiting for this season to become available on DVD. And finally it will be mine on December 6th!

As a DIE-HARD fan of 24, I have to say that this season, really ranks up there as one of the most intense, compelling, and all around best seasons in 24 history. While of couse it has some flaws, (every show does!) the amazing acting, directing, writing, continuity, music, intensity, and just plain brilliance of the season, really makes it hard to top!

Season 4 starts off incredibly strong, even with the majority of the cast stripped from the previous seasons. There is no one recognizable when seaosn 4 kicks off, other than Jack, and Chloe O'Brian, but very soon that will change as we get further into the day. Jack Bauer has moved on with his life of field work, and moved on to a ""normal life"" with a woman he his falling for Audrey Raines, the daughter of the Secretary of Defense; Jack's Boss. When a terroist plan to change the U.S forever (that has been in the works for almost 5 years), strikes, Jack is thrown back into the day, when he realizes that he can never have that normal life, and even more so, it's what he desires more than anything, to save his country. He can't escape his past, no matter how hard he tries, and he must and will do everything in his power to stop the havoc. The season only gets more amazing and more intense when Tony Alemida, Michelle Dessler, and David Palmer returns into the fold. The whole season builds up, further and further, and it finally explodes in the breathtaking season finale, where nothing on 24 will ever be the same.

On December 6th, this phenomenal season of one of the best shows of Television history, will finally be out.",1125532800,7,1740,4.482649842271293
2226152,5,B0007P14OE,"Amazing plot and lots of twists, some even more unexpected than the first three seasons.  After watching Season 4 I only want to know one thing? Why kind of cellphone battery does Jack Bauer use? His never seems to run out.",1495411200,,223,4.439024390243903
2226153,2,B0007P14OE,"Keeps getting worse plotwise and realism-wise. Although there are a few good performances (Dina Haraz, Chloe, Edgar, James Heller), but most of people in CTU and the White House are horrible, inept, and mean. There were too many lame subplots that didn't really go anywhere. Erin Driscoll and her daughter Maya were a waste. The main villain Marwan was played out, and I liked Navi Haraz much better as a bad guy. The Chinese security chief was also a better actor/character.

Jack's love interest Audrey was also overplayed. I could barely deal with Tony and Michelle from last season, but the show had both romances in Season 4. Audrey is torn between her husband and Jack, and it got real messy and unbelievable. I got real tired of unlikable characters turning sympathetic and the mole cliche again.

President Keeler was awful, and President Logan (Richard Nixon clone) is mind-boggling, but at least he played by a good actor with a lot of range. President Palmer's return was not as good as expected. I appreciate that he helped Jack, but it's just not fair the way Palmer and Jack were treated by the US gov.

Why was Mike allowed back in the White House? I am real tired of the unresolved plot lines from previous seasons. Adam (Spock) was missed.

I feel bad writing these things because I love 24. I am not sure when I took a break from the show when it had originally aired, but I am pretty sure it was towards the end of this season.",1495411200,2,1446,4.571428571428571

2226201,5,B0007P14OE,"The Fox Network series entitled ""24"" is a post-9/11 counter-terrorism television program, which premiered in November, 2001, just two months after the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001. This fourth season examines another 24-hour time period in the hectic life of Federal Agent Jack Bauer of the Los Angeles branch of the Counter-Terrorism Unit, known as the CTU, as he battles frantically to thwart yet another diabolical conspiracy. The novel structure of this groundbreaking television series involves each episode representing a single hour in this very action-packed and challenging day. The character of Agent Jack Bauer is portrayed perfectly by actor Kiefer Sutherland, who plays an old-fashioned tough guy, who utilizes any means necessary to vanquish the forces of evil. Of course, the rather aggressive and sometimes brutal methods of Agent Bauer often blur the distinction between good and evil. This fourth season of ""24"" continues to be decidedly intelligent, fast-paced, and suspenseful, and it is a superb combination of the political thriller and action/adventure genres. Its use of real-time plot development, and the innovative split-screen technique, are absolutely brilliant. The riveting intrigue and captivating plot twists keep the viewer totally enthralled, because one never really knows who can be trusted. This outstanding Counter-Terrorism series ""24"" is truly my all-time favorite television program, and I enthusiastically give Season 4 a five-star rating, along with my very highest recommendation!",1486252800,,1550,5.743478260869566

2226286,5,B0007P14OE,"I can simply say that this is the very first series that I have ever seen that has produced all of the action, suspense, drama and thrills in each episode that I can absorb. I did not think that writers were permitted to write this intensely. This series will test the audience's ability to endure suspense. The mixture of characters also provides the audience with a feeling of reality that approximates life as nearly as film can. Forget the suspending reality angle. This draws you into a world that you are happy to view from the comfort of your sofa.

When I rated this movie five stars it was because there is no room for improvement in this script.",1484956800,,655,4.504201680672269

""The Hobbits named it the Shire  and there in that pleasant corner of the world they plied their well-ordered business of living, and they heeded less and less the world outside where dark things moved, until they came to think that peace and plenty were the rule in Middle-earth and the right of all sensible folk. They forgot or ignored what little they had ever known of the Guardians, and of the labours of those that made possible the long peace of the Shire.""

""They were, in fact, sheltered, but they had ceased to remember it.""

The cast and relationships are compelling; this is not a shoot-em-up show.

And, when the day is done, you are grateful for the ride.",1477267200,,1304,6.375

A bit conrvoluted at times, but overall  good story telling.

This time, the emotional stakes are higher than ever before, and the threat is greater. I shan't say more, lest I inadvertently ruin a surprise.

The special features are excellent with one downside which I will get to in a moment; they include deleted and extended scenes with optional commentary by director Jon Cassar, several featurettes which are not very long, and an exclusive prequel to Day Five. The downside of the deleted scenes is that several bits of scenes and lines included in the recaps of some episodes which were not in the actual episodes are not present in this section. Why is that?, I wonder.

The actual plastic package had a broken corner, which separated from the back part of the case...kind of frustrating to have the sharp edges every time you open the package. It was also shrink-wrapped with a cardboard ""24"" photo cover that was attached to the plastic cover with a ""glue dot,"" which caused the cover to ripple when it was removed. (I also ordered later seasons, which came in the hard plastic, slimmer packages, which were so much cleaner and easy to open.)

UPDATE: finished a few seasons and this show goes from good to worthless........i still can not believe people actually enjoy this garbage. its like 40 minutes of BS and 10 minutes of what actually matters.

I was not enjoying all the new faces at the beginning of this season. But as it went on, it definitely took on a different perspective from the first three seasons, and the pace was MUCH better. I was getting tired of the same style and plot twists in seasons one and two. This season definitely moved better, had a much more cohesive plot line, and it's the first time Jack Bauer is EMOTIONAL! Yes! And much more believable in his role....they also brought back several characters as ""guest stars"" in this season, so that was nice. :)",1468540800,,676,4.459677419354839

2227181,5,B0007P14OE,"This show is worth revisiting. I stopped watching it during this season, because it was getting a little too on the nose with what was happening in the USA and the rest of the world. I just couldn't. But I'm glad I decided to revisit my decision. Day 4 has a lot to commend it. For one thing, except for the fact that torture always seems to lead to the truth on this show, the moral problems with it don't just get brushed off. At the same time, there's no pandering or handwringing over it, either. It's very nuanced, especially for a show that is telling a multiplot action story set within a 24 hour time period.

For another thing, there are a lot of women in this show, and they have agency and points of view and important jobs. The one thing that I thought was kind of a drag about this season was the [SPOILER WARNING scroll down past the end of the review to see the drag part]* but even that wasn't too bad.

Alberta Watson and Lana Parilla are two of my all time favorites. As Driscoll and Sarah, they are flawed and competent and very believable. Mary Lynn Rajskub - I think - plays Chloe to perfection. She's hard to take sometimes, but I think it's because she's neurodiverse and a little too smart. Kim Raver is good, but I like her better in a more morally ambiguous role (see, e.g., Revolution). She's fine here, though.

The plot is a bit hit and miss, but it stays plenty exciting, maybe a little more so even than Season 1.  And there are plenty of surprises along the way.

2227216,4,B0007P14OE,I had watched almost all 24 episodes throughout the years. I watched it again in Amazon Prime and it was still refreshing. The story was still twisting with terrorist liked always. Although they made tactical errors as any other cop show. Why didn't Jack use assault rifle in search of terrorist instead of using a pistol and wasted bullets and ran out? Why did he give up his weapon during hostage situation? Thank God that we don't have as many perpetrators in the real life as in the show.,1465516800,,492,4.53932584269663
2227217,4,B0007P14OE,"In all honesty as much as I enjoy watching 24, I could never give it a 5 star rating. It's way to frustrating. Jack Bauer is always either some kind of super hero or a bumbling idiot who's always letting the bad guy get over on him and get away. I know the idea is to keep you on the edge of your seat for 24 episodes, but come on. In this show the terrorists are always some kind of genius mastermind and the American government agencies are incompetent fools. Oh wait a minute, that is American government.

2227367,5,B0007P14OE,"As a series, 24 has been able to create AND MAINTAIN excitement better than any television show I have seen. For that alone, I have to give it five stars. It is a well-cast and directed series. For the most part, the characters you are supposed to like, you do and the characters you are not supposed to like, you don't. That's both good and not-so-good. The less appealing aspect of good and bad characters is that they become a bit too two-dimensional at times, despite occasional hints at complexity. But this is a necessary evil to maintain a constant high level of anticipation and desire to know what happens next. And unlike many other shows, you don't always know what will happen next. The writers for the series ""done good."" They should be proud.",1461715200,,756,4.607407407407408

2227493,5,B0007P14OE,"I absolutely loved 24 but the boom boom thud thud music annoyed me to the crazy point!!!!!  It was the best written series I've ever watched.  Thrilling, couldn't miss a word always, LOVED Kiefer Sutherland.  He had character, morals, faithfulness, .  Whoever created this mans character and principles deeply touched my heart.  He showed in truth the horrors of political life and how one man could rise above the Bulls*** in the greedy and ambitious power hungry men and women who govern us lacking in wisdom.  This character portrayed a man who could draw men and women around him not by coercion, manipulation, lies,and deceit, but by example.  I was never bored and I never tired of the way this series flowed together.  It didn't repulse me with vulgarity, torture, or results in reaching his results.  The portrayal of reality never ceased to amaze me.  I only wish that at the end of series eight it was over.  I never wanted it to end.  I'm 71 yrs old, new to technology ,TV, Roku, Apple, Amazon.  I am paying for Netflix but because I have a one year free Prime Video package.  Now that I have finally learned how to manipulate myself around Amazon Prime  I never watch Netflix.  Can't wait for next series of Railroad Man to become available.",1455840000,,1253,4.65296803652968

2227902,4,B0007P14OE,"Season 4 of 24 is a return to the formula that has made the show a success.  It's a huge improvement over season 3. I like season 4 but after rewatching it on demand with my husband I've come to realize that it's really just a bridge to the best of 24 - season 5 and runner up season 6. A lot of very important details are revealed in season 4 is that affect the later seasons so you really can't miss it.

On a lighter note - my husband and I invented a 24 drinking game to get us through some of the episodes where not much happens. I am sure others have as well. The rule is every time Jack Bauer says ""you're just going to have to trust me"" we take a shot of our adult beverage of choice.  Every time he says ""damnit"" you have to say ""Jim!  I'm a doctor not a CTU agent"". The person who finishes the phrase last has to remove a piece of clothing.  No matter how long the writers stretch the boring teenage terrorist episodes you can still have a great time if you follow these rules!",1439683200,,987,3.989847715736041

I'm beginning to see a pattern where we are not only shown the main protagonist but there is always a ""cliff-hanging"" end to the drama. Season 4 is action packed, cliff-hanging, and ""edge of your seat"", and makes it difficult to not watch all 24 episodes in one sitting.

The twist are not always seen but you get totally caught up in the battle and interactions.  Eventually it seems like the characters could become predictable . . . they aren't and it is so complex at times, it could be watched over and over and still there would be nuances that surface each time.  Excellent series.  Don't know why I didn't tackle this one before.  The downside - it spoils you badly.

2228359,5,B0007P14OE,"If you have never seen this series let me explain the meaning of the title. Each season is 24 episodes representing a 24 hour period of time and each episode is one hour in ""real time"" of the 24 hour period. That simple but novel premise sets the stage for one of the best series to come to prime time. Believe me when I say there are no boring moments in this groundbreaking series. It seems to get more intense with each season  with Terrorists from both without and within viewers are always wondering who will be the next victim or the next surprise terrorist to crop up.  I am glad I never watched it on prime time TV because each episode is left with a cliffhanger and I have sat and watched several episodes at times. It is addicting to say the least what with all the conflicts, egos, romance and action along with enough plot twists that make an Alfred Hitchcock film seem mediocre to say the least.
 In season one Kiefer Sutherland who plays the main character of Jack Baur is in charge of the Los Angeles Division of the governments Counter Terrorism Unit (CTU). An ex special forces tough as nails man who can really kick butt, he does most of his work in the field because that is what he was trained to do and does it well. But as tough as he is he is not invulnerable to getting shot or knocked on the head and has his ""inner"" toughness really put to the test in each season. Every man has their limit to how much they can keep their emotions in check in a bad or tough situation in order to do the job that needs to be done. Jack Baur can do torture or whatever it takes to save thousands of American lives, but in one episode, after he is forced to shoot his own boss and friend in the head execution style he broke down and cried  (season 4). But then ol' Jack he just keeps bouncing back against all odds because he knows he is the best at what he does. In season 5 the body count at CTU goes really high and that's all I'll say about that. Don't want to give away too many spoilers here. I just watched five episodes of season 5 in a row and needed to stop for a chance to catch my breath. LOL. So I'm writing this review. Truly the production values of this series equals that of many action feature films, and as each season progresses it seems to only get bigger. I always appreciate a good musical score that accompanies a film or TV show, and in season 4 and 5 composer Callery has really outdone himself in adding tension and excitement to that effect. If being taken to the limit of excitement in entertainment is your cup of tea then, may I say,  24 fits that order like no other series before it. Just be warned there are scenes of torture throughout that may be too intense for younger or more sensitive audiences. But when millions of lives are at stake, a man, or sometimes even a woman, has got to do what they have too do. Whether it's a nuclear threat, or deadly nerve gas or a threat from within CTU can be counted on to come through, no matter the cost to their selves, including their own safety or personal lives.
Filled with great performances that can make you  feel empathy for some characters and outright hate for the baddies, and anger at some of the a-hole bosses at CTU. One of my favorite characters is Chloe O'Brian (Mary lynn Rajskub) who came on board in season 3. One of the brightest and most indispensable operatives at CTU she has a problem controlling her smart-mouth attitude and always looks like she needs a good dose of ex-lax :) Miss Rajskub (some one pronounce that name for me please) has one of the most complicated characters in the series. One which I am sure she loves getting to sink her actors teeth into. In season 5 (wait, isn't this supposed to be a review of season 4?) she reluctantly gets pulled in to do some ""field"" work and even gets to shoot a few baddies.
All I can say is, I hope the edge of your seat is real comfortable because this show will keep you there. A lot. Okay, I'm done. Now where's that remote?",1424390400,,3989,4.255936675461742

2228463,3,B0007P14OE,"Without preconceived reverence for 24, it's basically just an action version of a soap opera.

Let me say, I've watched this long because I could not find any TV shows that I really was interested in. I never watched it the first time when it aired and remember how much acclaim it got, The Unit is probably my favorite show and just about any military/counter-terrorism show is a must see for me if it's well done and reasonably realistic.

I have absolutely no clue how this show was that popular. I get it was one of the first shows to use a single-camera set up and movie actors staring in a TV program but other than higher production values than TV was used to in the early 00's this is a terrible show.

The ""real time,"" format (each hour long episode is one hour in a day) seems as much a liability to me as it was critically praised. People are kidnapped like 3 times in one day, Jack get's injuries that would most definitely have taken a real soldier not just out of the fight, but out of the war and probably a medical discharge and not just once but several times...in one day...

What got me is not  just how dangerous the antagonist terrorist groups get after the first season, but how unrealistic and preposterous the behavior of the US bureaucrats gets. It's like a Neo-Conservative caricature of the world presented in a Soap.",1417392000,,1344,4.4471544715447155

2228597,5,B0007P14OE,"Season 4 of 24 is like a fine Italian wine: it is an excellent blend of action, adventure, and plot. 24 is no mere cliffhanger serial. It is the only series which develops heroes and villains as well as it develops a plot. The hero, Jack, is no Arnold Schwartznegger cartoon character. Rather then make Jack into a machine gun wielding moron, the writers of 24 have made him into a complex character who misses his dead wife and fears for his daughter's safety. To be sure Jack chokes people out, twists their necks until they are broken, and shots them dead, but he also likes ""nesting"" with daddy's career girl, Audrey Raines. The writers at 24 manage to turn every scene into an insightful slice of life which reveals depth of character as it advances plot. While most action/adventure heroines are simple minded sex pots whose boobs pop out of their bras while their butts squirm out of their panties, the women in 24 believe in causes, love their children and poison or shoot their enemies. Take the ""Rain-man like, Chloe character. She is not just some autistic freak who can instantly count how many matches have fallen on the floor. No, she is an Asperger's sufferer who struggles to project a human quality, but only manages to sound like a talking self help book. The Chloe is typical of what the viewer can expect from 24: she is a savant who always knows what computer key to push, but never knows which emotional cord to strike or how to do it. 24 is not just artsy action adventure; it is art imitating action adventure. Savor every sip. Shakespeare would have enjoyed 24.",1412121600,,1586,4.588028169014085

But the technological plot devices - OMG, so lame. Every season, I stop watching once, or twice, or three times, after 24 coughs up some techno-twist that is just... so... stupid.
(spoiler alert)
Hiding a massive attack on the nation's nuclear reactors... with a video broadcast?  I'm sorry, because the way we would detect that kind of attack... is by monitoring OVERALL internet traffic?
More fundamentally - the nation's nuclear reactor control systems... are hooked up to the Internet? Seriously???  Oh yeah, that sounds legit.  How else would you do it.
And a gadget that looks like a portable drive, that lets you remotely control a nuclear plant, including melting it down.  OK...
AND, and, that's not all. CTU has to solve the problem, because apparently, the FULL-TIME 24/7 STAFF IN EACH NUCLEAR PLANT can't do anything to keep the plant from melting down. There are no manual overrides.  I actually suspect that everybody who works on the scripts for 24 thinks nuclear plants are unmanned. Fully automated.  'Cause of ... uh... 'cause of all the, like, radiation, y'know.
And now, I've arrived at the episode where Edgar thinks he can (from his desk) reclaim control of all the nuclear plants, but if he makes a mistake, he might blow some of them up instead.  The Secretary of Defense and the Director of CTU are worried about this (and that, I have to admit, seems technically accurate), but NOBODY suggests that another analyst LOOK OVER HIS SHOULDER OR CHECK HIS WORK.  I paused the video. What is wrong with these people? Does the director have an assistant to operate his cellphone for him?  Are we still using hand-cranked film cameras? Hello?

Why doesn't Jack have an invisibility cloak, or a flying car, or precognition?  That would be less stupid than this.

2228833,5,B0007P14OE,"The show is simply riveting. While Jack Bauer has more lives than Felix the cat, the tension as he makes his way from catastrophe to triumphs is captivating.  The video editing is paced to the music in ways that over time finds your pulse beating sympathetically.  The implausible is passable due to the artistry with which the audience is moved between character flaws, moral conundrum, stupidity, ethical bankruptcy and heroism.  It is an amazing ride.  To pack all of this in a mere 24 hours is exhausting.  You have to admire the stamina of even the fictional characters as they go through beatings, shooting, romance, betrayals, and renewed allegiances all without taking a nap.

I am not convinced that this kind of drama is harmless fun.  Over time, repeated exposure to the violence cheapens respect for life.  The solutions of so many problems is through the barrel of gun, the cutting edge of knife, or some other forms of death.  To view these kinds of solutions to so many complex problems oversimplifies the problems of moral decision.  Jack Bauer has a strong humanistic streak as he helps the needy, deserving, and destitute.  Similarly he as an vicious contempt for evil which he has no hesitation in confronting.  24 is an interesting metaphor for the complexities of life, and quick simplification resulting in decisive remedies.

In nearly every episode, Jack seek the trust of some relatively powerless individual who as a consequence of the situation, suddenly has enormous power to provide the missing link that lets Bauer solve the problem.  His humility in asking for trust, and needing the assistance of the weak to empower him, is a frequent dynamic that reappears often.

The mix of music, video editing, acting, amazing situations, and a sense of pace, makes 24 incredibly engaging as it converts fictional situations reflective of contemporary potential realities into semi plausible adventure that weld you to your seat as new wrinkles unfold from this cloth intrigue.",1407456000,,1998,5.048780487804878

I love ""Jack"" but after 4 seasons, the writers/director haven't let him grow very much.  And must he always be a ""CTU"" outlaw?  It's excellent, but it is also predictable.",1405814400,,453,5.0

This first episode follows a very similar pattern.  For avid fans of 24 it does not disappoint. Plenty of action, intrigue, and Jack Bauer is his usual ""out of the box.""  No complaints here, but probably won't buy the whole season.  I'd rather watch season 3 of Homeland.

I don't think there has ever been a TV Series as well written, produced and played out as
24...Ever!!!!  Jack Bauer the main Character on 24 reminds me of Jack Reacher the main
Character in Lee Child's Books and they will do whatever it takes to stop anyone and
everyone in order to deal with a World Crisis.  The plots are complex and riveting and an
edge of your seat thrill ride.

2228987,5,B0007P14OE,"Probably the best season for 24, outside of the first. Season 4 has many twist and turns. The only negative, is that you will watch 5 or 6 episodes at a time.",1404172800,,158,3.96875
2228988,4,B0007P14OE,"I am enjoying this series, HOWEVER - do NOT watch this for any kind of insight into the workings of the US intelligence apparatus! The entire 24 vehicle is so full of holes it would never float - from technology that is impossibly far in the future (tine in-ear communication devices that seem to have infinite range and battery life, computers that appear to be faster, by several orders of magnitude, than what is available now [several years later]), to continuous use of brutal torture, to a network that seems to employ about 10% of the US population, with agents in place every quarter mile) - and yet the stories are fun.

It must have been quite an adventure for the writers, finding ways to twist every episode in some new way, or at least a different version of an old situation. Jack Bauer goes from hero to suspect villian back to hero so often one's head spins!

Again - it is still a fun show to watch. Do be sure, though, to let your imagination gloss over the obvious technical and technological errors (we can't help but laugh every time they mention ""sockets"" or ""protocols"" in their terse, so-serious tension-laden voices). Ignore the factual errors (talk of turning over domestic investigations and field operations to the NSA). Sit back and watch the action, and see if you can guess what's going to happen next.

Oh, and if the above cited glitches in the series start to wear on you, don't binge watch! Give it a slight rest, then come back to it in a few days.

2229051,2,B0007P14OE,"This show has been on my list to watch since the day when it aired. Back then I and most people watched TV as live broadcast via cable or satellite, waited for a show to come on during the week, gather around the big screen projection HDTV and suffer through the commercials. I remember watching bits and pieces of this show in early 2000's, and I recall how entertaining this show was. It WAS. Fast forward 10 years later and this show no longer holds up. Not in terms of story line, writing, acting, or format.

First problem. Unnecessary subplots that pollute the story line with fillers and detract the focus. Imagine taking a portrait where everything is in focus, no depth of field, no emphasis.

Two: women get kidnapped.

Three: Muslim terrorist plot that ends up being governed by some other European or government bodies. Every season so far the tone of the storyline repeated.

Four: Predictability. The background music and camera shots dumb down and predict the events to happen. Perfect example: In 4th season, the Turkish boy with a American girlfriend is about to deliver a briefcase. The writers decided to make her place a call right before the boy leaves home to make delivery. By the time the boy delivers the briefcase, I am sitting on the couch and telling my wife: Queue in the girlfriend, one, two, tree The girlfriend showed up on count of four. She followed the boy, because she was jealous. Imagine the staff meeting where writers voted this in. No one raised their hand and said - this is lame.

Five: this show was meant to be watched once a week in order for memory lapses to occur. Because when binge watching this on Prime, it makes no sense. A show has to make sense to hold up in the realm of believability. Wife and I constantly have moments of - I want to fire the writers, why did they just destroy a perfect story line with repetitive stupidity. Interoffice politics such as these cannot occur in any professional environment. But if they do, surely something is wrong with writing because it does not ring true.

This pattern of sub par writing began with first season. Despite what other reviewers say here, how they enjoyed Season X but Season Y is not to their standard. The style and execution of all the series up to season 4 is extremely consistent, with one exception. The sound quality has improved a bit. In earlier seasons, loud audio was clipped during production. Ooops, where were the sound engineers. It is fixed by season 4.

We were hoping that this show would improve, but it has not by SE4. We will continue watching this, because A) I made a commitment to it and B) it has its moments.

Each spell binding show was exciting, and kept you wanting to know what happened next.  For years, I held off on watching ""24"" because I usually do not like government  - political type drama thrillers.  Just out of curiosity, and with some coaxing from a friend, I finally gave in a month or so ago, and watched the first episode of series one.  I got hooked!  Now, I am currently watching Season 6.  The characters are credible and the theme is believable.  Maybe, Jack is just a wee bit over the top, but that makes his character more exciting.  And, Chloe is so interesting with her snippy attitude embedded within her incredible knowledge of computers. ""24"" just has a very well developed plot line.  Kudos to the creators and writers of the show as well as the actors.  I highly recommend this program to anyone who wants an above average TV program to view other that the usual humdrum nonsense which permeates much or the airwaves today.",1401580800,,1062,4.625668449197861

YES there are cheesy moments but its the overarching story thats awesome. Its like watching a 24 hr long 90's action movie. Nothing is ever as it seems. It is unpredictably predictable - meaning you know that nothing is going to go right and one plot will lead to another, but its the anticipation of figuring out exactly what IS going to happen that keeps you goin.

Truly a legendary show on all levels and Jack Bauer has got to be the single best protagonist created in the last decade! When writers try to create a character that the viewers look up to and yet personifies the words bad ass this is who they are trying to create. Kiefer Sutherland does it with ease. His portrayal of Jack makes any season of 24 a good season of 24.,1400976000,,460,4.122222222222222

This one is really good because it gives Chloe (one of my favorite characters) more of a role.  There are several different dangers that Jack and the crew must fight against, and it seems that, after each one, just when you think they have succeeded, another threat pops up!

2229130,5,B0007P14OE,"Got my new Amazon Fire TV and thought one of the first things to watch would be my favorite Season of 24. I enjoy this season because of the saga of the Araz family, the various villains are really well played, and of course the Marwan character. Great heart pumping crises and the subplots are all quite interesting. I particularly like the Tony/Michelle pairing and watching them slowly being drawn back to each other is well played by the two actors. Their two scenes of reconciliation, one of heart, the other the dramatic one when he returns after being feared dead, I could watch countless times. Love them. I think Secretary of Defense Heller is a great character--loving and compassionate on various fronts but firm and forceful when he needed to be. My least favorite story line is that of Audrey and her husband, but that's acceptable in that it didn't get too much screen time. Love Chloe and Edgar. Love them. The contrast of Presidents Logan and Palmer is fascinating. And last of all, Jack was classic Jack. Great, great season.",1400630400,,1042,4.730769230769231

2229153,2,B0007P14OE,"If you can manage to think of it as a cartoon.. or a comic book, then maybe it might be ok. But Jesus! This show is terrible! I can't seem to use enough exclamation marks to emphasize that! The first couple of episodes were sort of promising, but then the bad guys' IQs dropped to the level of rocks and it all went down hill from there. I stopped watching at the point where Jack Bauer infiltrates the villain's stronghold by kicking one guy's ass and making him drive into the facility. This is where I wanted to throw something at the television: Jack hid under a blanket in the back seat of a car with no tinted windows! I mean he literally just threw a blanket over himself and threatened the guy driving not to expose him. The bad guy guarding the gate questioned the driver about his beat up face and the driver mumbled something. The gate guy inspected the car (clear windows. no tint) as he was talking to the driver and he never said something like ""dude, what's that human-shaped thing under the blanket? Are you trying to smuggle someone inside? Because I can totally see a person hiding under the blanket..."" Also, Jack was completely covered by a blanket, the driver could have just signaled the heavily armed gate guard that someone was in the back, jumped out of the car and Jack Bauer should've been toast! But No! The bad guy at the gate didn't notice the obvious human-shaped lump in the back seat and the driver never tipped off the gate guard? Why? Because the storyline called for it.. I guess. That was the icing on the cake for me. I mean Jack Bauer had escaped a police pursuit, the feds and assassins prior to that, but man, oh man... that infiltration scene just completely turned me off. Jack Bauer should be dead goddamnit!",1399852800,,1752,4.461059190031152

I always thought 24 and jack Bauer were some kind of right wing nut story with excuses to torture ppl and blame muslims for national security and there is some of that, but then suddenly it wasn't the muslims we all suspected but some secret gov agency trying to help the oil companies control the middle east. Great deeo story lines that feel like you fell Into a well headfirst as the story gets deeper and deeper blind to what will happend next.

2229159,5,B0007P14OE,"Could there be a more perfect TV show than 24?  I don't think so.  This superb action/drama/thriller made television history in so many ways and helped to define a critical decade in America's history.

24 was shaped by its times with America's struggle against global terrorism in the post 9-11 era, but by reflecting that period and engaging difficult ethical and moral topics it also has in some ways helped to influence how we view it.  The show's hero, Jack Bauer, does not exist in real life but he captures the popular imagination and our wish for individuals who can step up and do what's necessary in times of extreme crisis.

Season 4 is easily one of best seasons of the show in its 8-year run, and there's a fair argument that it *is* the best.  Although viewers are familiar with the basic formula by now, the storylines in this season and the deft interleaving and execution of them by the actors, writers, directors, and editors are at such a peak level of excellence that one almost would not want to ever watch any other show afterwards.  The pacing is superb, and the action and drama are excellently managed to ramp up tension throughout a majority of episodes.

This is entertainment of the highest caliber and a work of art to be admired with multiple viewings.  Watch it, be enthralled by it, and be prepared to camp out on a sofa for many hours as the episodes roll on by.",1399680000,,1395,4.548

Watch any series on Netflix and you'll see what I mean.  Netflix lets you know exactly where you left off, both during an episode and which episode is next, all on the main screen for that series.  With Amazon, I need to make a note to myself to know which episode to open next.  With Netflix, when you choose, it's loaded & playing right away.  If you are binge watching. moving to the next episode is smooth, and without the Amazon ""checking download connection"" every time!  You've already checked it! Let's move!
Also, Netflix captions are easy to read and complete, whereas Amazon puts up partial words as well as partial sentences.

Most shows lead up to a final climax but a season in 24 usually has at least 3 climaxes in a season. Just when you think its over and it reaches a climax and the bad guy is captured or killed you find out theres another bad guy behind the the previous one.

Our hearts were pounding as we didn't know what to expect next! This show continues to amaze me with how the story is never really what it seems and the twists that it constantly puts in your way. I find this to be more similar to real life with the complexity of the issues instead of the very simple stories of most TV shows.,1397347200,,464,4.166666666666667

If you like yelling at the TV advising the hero what to do and he does just the opposite, you'll love this show. I personally like watching it in my workshop because I don't have to watch ever second to get the gest of what is going on. If you like revenge situations this show will sometimes satisfy you and other times drives you nuts. I'm on season 6 now, so I must enjoy it somewhat, but, because of its predictability, it doesn't have that ""can't wait for the next episode"" intrigue.",1396828800,,646,4.391666666666667

I don't want to get too excited over a tv series but this one is great, especially this season when Tony and Michelle return - despite the outcome.",1393372800,,269,4.09433962264151
2229308,5,B0007P14OE,"This was the season that led up to the best season of 24 in my opinion. Jack is more human than he ever was since season 1 and he perfectly transitions into the ice-veined Jack we've become accustomed to. Dennis Haysbert gave another awesome performance as David Palmer, and the stakes continued to ramp up as Jack finds himself in another crisis he has to resolve for himself and the country. Buy season 4 if your are a fan of 24.",1393113600,,431,4.333333333333333

2229311,5,B0007P14OE,"Season 4 was better than 2 and 3.  If you've watched 24 before you know that there are episodes that are more dragged out than others.  Sometimes the characters make such dumb decisions or take the stupidest actions but this is part of the show.  For every dumb decision or action, there is a welcoming YES!! when everything works out.",1392940800,,335,4.55
2229312,5,B0007P14OE,24 seams to cover possible scenarios of problems we could face. I find it entertaining and very realistic and the personalities of some like Cloie to be funny and dramatic t the same time.,1392940800,,188,4.5588235294117645

2229315,5,B0007P14OE,Every episode is a ticking time-bomb situation with split second life-or-death decision making.  Squeeze a nickle until the buffalo poops and jack will drop out squeaky clean every time.  Only 24 could pull off impossible situations and make it credible.  Great Series and it only gets better!!,1392681600,,294,5.212765957446808

2229317,5,B0007P14OE,"There is simply no comparison to any other TV production.  24, with Jack Bauer, Chloe, Edgar et al, present action and intrigue that is unprecedented.  If you missed it 8-10 years ago, like I did (I had so much better things to do, I said), there is no time like the present for you to see the best screenwriting and acting you will ever get on TV.  No wonder it is legendary!  Copy that!  Watch it or you are out of the loop.",1392595200,,426,4.0843373493975905

2229320,5,B0007P14OE,"Since I was not able to see many episodes of 24 when it aired on television, I have thoroughly enjoyed being able to watch one episode after another this time.  The writers certainly know how to keep me on the edge of my seat.  Even after 3 previous seasons, Season 4 is still action packed with a story line that will keep you guessing.  I am addicted.",1391990400,,353,4.2388059701492535

2229324,4,B0007P14OE,"Although much of the story is a bit outlandish, it still provides the viewer some ideas to consider for a possible end to the USA.

Only rarely did I have to wait for it to load (only a few seconds at the very beginning), but that could have been my wireless equipment or network. I loved the fact that it always remembered where I left off viewing each episode so that I could start it again later (at the same spot). Thank you Amazon!",1390867200,,385,4.216216216216216
2229336,5,B0007P14OE,"Had I not joined Amazon Prime membership I may have missed one of the  most riveting  action series on TV to-date. I apologize but 24, IMO, beats out the Bourne movies, & I thought those were gooood.  While Jack Bauer is one tough dude, he does have a kind heart, not saying Jason didn't.

What many may  relate to, while putting themselves into a fiction movie or book,  most likely depends on their own life experiences. Whether we're from a military family, a nuclear facility family, etc. I don't view 24 as strictly a ""guy"" series. Many can  likely relate to the strong rolls written for ""women"" in 24, especially Season 4. The Driscoll character reflects what she has to deal with in a highly professional position that is in crises mode  while going through A personal life. Trying to separate the two & the results of her actions/inactions may cause us to ask ourselves; what would we do?. I didn't care for Driscoll, at first, but as the story rolls along many women may relate to her conundrum.

The nuclear reactor story line in Season 4; many may or may not relate to as a realistic possibility. What goes on behind the scenes; we the people may not realize the actions taken to keep us & our country safe. Many have experienced the classified information that is never broadcast through the  media to prevent mass panic.

While I felt Season 4 started out a little slower than other seasons, it felt real. The outstanding music brought the action to the screen. I can't write enough great reviews about the actors. Love seeing some ""old timers"", William Devane, for example. Jack Bauer must be exhausted by this season and that Chloe is a real peach! I love her also, she makes me chuckle & relieves some of the intensity of the storyline! Warning: If Chloe doesn't ease up on her precious quirky facial expressions she's going to need Botox soon.",1390348800,,1860,4.606060606060606

2229338,5,B0007P14OE,"An incredibly edge-of-your-seat series. Jack Bauer is even better than James Bond.( Note they have the same initials.)

2229352,4,B0007P14OE,I like 24 and have watched season 6  8.  Season 1 is very predictable until the end.  To tell you the truth I got a little board and skipped some of the episodes.

If you've liked the first 3 seasons though, you'll like this one.  C'mon, it's JACK BAUER. Watching him kick butt for America never gets old, so buy it!",1377648000,,430,4.584415584415584

2229429,5,B0007P14OE,"My short review of Season Four. At the time of this release this season may have been the best outside of Season One. The only reason I use Season One as a baseline is it was the first. Now I purchased this DVD as a replacement due to a sabatoge of sorts by my Blu-Ray player that was connected to the internet, decided that Disc Three, I would assume, was a bootleg or something as it destroyed the disc. Yep, unplayable forever! I had purchased this season at Best Buy on the first days of it's release. It served me well until about this time last year(2012 Aug).Sony BDPS 390 was the model. Anyone else have a similar problem? Oh well. Pura Vida!",1377129600,,650,4.2926829268292686

2229449,5,B0007P14OE,This is an excellent continuation of an already very good series. Each episode picks up where the other left off and they're all guaranteed to keep you on the edge of your seat.,1376611200,,177,4.393939393939394

I'm not sure why the description/review and other reviews say this is different than other seasons - it's the same, right down to them having a spy inside CTU, which made me roll my eyes - any office that can't even stop spies from getting in every single season, shouldn't be operating and should have everyone fired.  But ignoring that fact this season is along the same as the others, so many plot twists (some good, some bad) it will make your head spin (and roll your eyes as they keep stringing you along).  I like watching these, but I also have my finger on the fast forward button as I skip around 10min of every episode because of side stories they build that don't fit the show.  I really wish Jack would have shot Mandy (assassin) in the leg after she got her immunity papers and say ""there wasn't anything in there about that from me, was there"".",1376438400,,1105,4.51

The story.  The villain's.  If you like the old fashion cowboys and Indian's and classic good vs. evil shows and movies of old you'll love this show.  This is the modern version.,1375142400,,354,4.4375

In the back of your mind you keep saying 'this can't all happen in one day' but then the ticking clock lets you know that time is winding down.  Jack is one bad man and he is not ashamed to let anyone (including a girlfriend, boss, president, or the popcorn vendor at the movies) know it.  When it was on originally I had to take a nap when the show was over just because it 'wore me out'.  Watching it for the (I lost count) thousandth time it still is the same.

The writing and acting compels you to watch episode after episode for hours at a time , and yet at the same time, you want to stretch there viewing out over a longer period because nearly every thing else on t.v. is no where near as good. The writers list of the best 100 written dramas ever on t.v. came out the other day. It put ""24"" .... 70th, tied with ""Roseanne""!!!! Are you kidding me . 70th place!!!

2229512,5,B0007P14OE,"24 hit its peak with this season, with some of the best weekly cliffhangers in the series, which keep you coming back for more. There is terrorist plot upon terrorist plot that would have made this a red letter day in the annals of terrorism.  OK, you got some real eye rolling moments but hey, this is 24. If you think this season is bad in terms of believability, wait til you see the ones that follow. It gets much worse. The soap opera elements bring it down a bit but it's not nearly as bad as  in later seasons. A very strong  supporting cast helps keep this season moving (the last in which series favorites Tony and Michelle play a key role)  and the Jack Bauer character is in full bloom with his to-hell-with-the-rules attitude and shoot first and ask questions later approach. The smarmy President Logan makes his first appearance, perhaps the most unlikeable character in the 24 series (well, except for the dopey Bauer daughter). He is a true weasel and plays a central role in the much-less interesting season 5.  Enjoy  season 4 because it doesn't get any better than this one",1371081600,,1091,4.540816326530612

Yes, it's so unbelievable & sometimes the dialogue makes me grin a little, but 24 cliffhanging episodes in a season is just unheard of for a non-reality show.

As with all seasons, this keeps you on the edge of your seat till the very end - wanting resolution and justice.

2229639,3,B0007P14OE,"This season had arguably one of the best endings to the popular series based around attempts to prevent terrorist strikes on homeland property. It's also one of the most gut-wrenching, nail-biting, un-politically-correct shows on television.

A train is derailed and a suitcase stolen from one of the passengers, who is then murdered. When a hacker stumbles across lethal information on the internet, he is barely able to pass it along to his friend Chloe (Mary Lynn Rajskub) at the Counter Terrorist Unit before he is hunted down by Arabs. His disappearance is perpetrated only hours before the kidnapping of Secretary of Defense James Heller ( Logan Marshall-Green) and his daughter Audrey (Kim Raver). Former special agent Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) is placed in command of the recovery operation, but soon discovers it was merely a distraction tactic for other, more deadly intentions. Little does anyone know that Jack and Audrey have been seeing another for several months, while waiting for her divorce to be finalized. Her kidnapping has rejuvenated the interest of her husband Paul (James Frain), who returns hoping to repair their broken marriage and start again.

The kidnapping is merely the tip of the iceberg, as Air Force one is intercepted by a seeker missile and sent plunging to earth. The nation is left in the incapable hands of the vice president, who in desperation sends for former President David Palmer (Dennis Haysbert) to assist him in making the necessary security decisions. Working beneath the radar of CTU, Bauer recruits friend and former operative Tony Almeida (Carlos Bernard) to assist him in a sleek underground operation to root out the terrorists. Tony's presence becomes something of an issue when his ex-wife, Michelle Dessler (Reiko Aylesworth) is brought in to replace the leadership of CTU. Knowing that terrorists nationwide are planning a nuclear strike that will devastate the United States, Bauer must take extreme tactics to unearth the conspirators and stop them before it's too late.

Attempting to summarize this season is extremely difficult, because there are a dozen or more main characters, spread out through an equal number of plot lines. The computer programmer whose mother is unable to get out of the way of a nuclear strike. The young Arab boy who realizes the depravity of his evil father only when it requires the death of his innocent Caucasian girlfriend. There is no end to the twists and turns, to kidnappings, assassinations, hostage situations, hold-ups, and near misses. Bauer comes close to catching the bad guys multiple times, only to have them escape through higher intervention, sheer dumb luck, or a political miscalculation. For the most part, with 24 all bets are off. If you think everyone will live through it, think again. If you believe the situation is nearly resolved, take another look.

One of the better seasons due to its lack of sexual content, this year brought us numerous heartfelt moments in addition to depictions of hair-raising escapades. I am not a die-hard fan of the series for the simple reason that it promotes a worldview that the outcome makes up for the means of getting there. There are numerous instances of torture tactics, not only used by the terrorists but government operatives as well. People are electrocuted, shot in the leg and have the wound pressed to increase the pain, have their arms broken, and cut with knives. Violence is extreme. Cars are overturned. Fire and explosions consume buildings. Spew of gunfire leaves many dead and others wounded. Women are slapped, punched, and shoved around by angry, evil men. Bauer makes many decisions in the heat of the moment that have devastating consequences for civilians.

It is implied Bauer and Audrey are involved in a sexual relationship, despite the fact that her divorce has not yet been finalized. A woman seduces men and murders them and/or uses them to her own evil advantage, but we're only given two ""afterglow"" shots. There's a scattered amount of language. Tony is living with a girl. On the up side, Tony and Michelle work to resolve their issues and repair their broken marriage. It's not something I would recommend to everyone simply because it is such a difficult program to watch, but for lovers of intense drama, 24 is definitely impacting.",1363824000,,4328,5.064516129032258

This season of ""24"" brings back some great old friends (Tony, Michelle, and David Palmer) and introduces delightful new ones (Chloe, Edgar, and Bill Buchanan).  There are twists and surprises at every turn and the body count is sky high; through it all, Jack keeps his cool and shows again that he can be vulnerable and still save humanity.

Kiefer Sutherland continues to wow us with his energy, intensity, and charisma.  Production values rival those on feature films with split screens, extravagant special effects, and gritty locations.  Season Four is addictive and fun.",1358899200,2,899,4.868421052631579

While the format of 24 got a little tired toward the end of the series, don't forget this was a groundbreaking TV show when it started...it broke a lot of the ""rules"" (just like Jack Bauer).

2229759,5,B0007P14OE,"""24"" Season 4 is an addictive, exciting, serialized drama that has no peer.  Hands down, this is the best drams to air on TV - there simply is no equal to it.  Each episode leaves you amazed, shaking-your-head-in-amazement, and wanting more. You cannot go wrong in purchasing this season - you will get 24 episodes of nail-biting heart-racing excitement as Jack Bauer leads the CTU team to  stop a nuclear terror strike on US soil.

Keifer Sutherland again reprises the role of Jack Bauer, CTU Field Agent who will stop at nothing and sacrifice everything to stop the threats that are trying to destroy his country.  This season again explores the almost impossible task of being a CTU agent and having a meaningful, fulfilling relationship.  This theme is explored through many characters, and is quite touching, and provides an emotional contrast to the non-stop action ""24"" is known for.  The supporting cast is superb, and the personal plot themes involving these characters lends an emotional reality to a show which already presents a race-against-the-clock stark dramatic reality.

I have watched four seasons of ""24"", and each season continues to top the season before.  In short, this is the best entertainment television can offer.  Not suitable for viewers under 12 years old due to violence, plot themes, and mild language.

Most highly recommended.

2229760,5,B0007P14OE,"I didn't really notice ""24"" until it's last season. I heard about it before, but never really bothered to try and watching it until it's last season and was surprised that it was actually a decent show.

I then noticed that seasons 1-7 were availible for Prime for free, which allowed me to watch every season on amazon, which took a few months watching a few episodes each week.

Kiefer Sutherland plays Jack Bauer, the main character, who seems to have everything go wrong at the wrong moments, somewhat reminds me of Bruce Willis in Die Hard. Many things in this series such as the circumstances and outcomes are not the most realistic scenarios. If you are looking for a realistic type show, this is not for you.

Each season has many twists in its story, while some more obvious than others. As of this review I have finished all seasons of ""24"", and have enjoyed watching Jack Bauer's experiences throughout the series.

While I am not a die hard 24 fan, I still enjoyed the series and will certainly watch the movie if/when it does get released. Would recommend watching to those who haven't already been immersed by this show!",1331942400,2,1134,4.626865671641791

I have never wrote a review on Amazon before but I enjoyed this so much I couldn't help myself. Prior to this Rome was my favorite TV series but this wins; I have never had so much fun watching something featured on TV or in a movie. Judging from the other reviews, season four is an ok place to start, but you better believe I will watch the next four seasons now. When I'm done with that I just might have to start with season 1. This is good stuff!

Also, I'm glad I mostly watched this alone because I kept shouting or cheering at the screen. But the reason I had to watch it alone was because the others who I watched it with wouldn't shut up. Not that I blame them but I recommend watching this alone...

Personally, I find that the whole show is put together so effectively that the obvious ""Oh, come on now!""s don't bother me too much.

I can, however, imagine the writers and the producers at a meeting to discuss the plot line:

""Well, let's see, so far in this series Jack Bauer has committed murder, assault, theft, kidnapping, burglary, torture, interfering with a Federal investigation, and about two dozen random Federal premises crimes.  What criminal act has he not committed that we can have him do this season?""

While Season 2 and Season 3 struggled at times to include a story for every character, this time, the story progresses on its own, and the characters are included only when they are relevant to the story.  Also, I did not feel, like other seasons, as if the changes in story were changed continually to keep the momentum going, but felt the entire story was congruent from begining until the end.

The characters and character development is an essential aspect of the show's success this year. There are now characters you genuinely care about, truly despise or even feel sorrow at their respective demises. And Christopher Henderson is the greatest character creation in the show since Nina Myers.

And then there's that 3 or 4 episode run round about middle of the series that is by far my favourite storyline in 24 history - so dramatic and emotional at the same time. One of those particular episode is among the greatest achievements of TV drama that I have ever seen: my jaw was open for the entire hour and I actually must have cried at least twice (which is remarkable for me).

2229874,4,B0007P14OE,"As far as I'm concerned, this season should be titled 12, instead of 24.  Yes there are 24 episodes just like every other season, but the first 12 episodes feel vastly different from the latter 12.  The first 12 episodes in my opinion were some of the worst and probably the most boring of the entire series (at the time of this writing, 7 seasons have aired, all of which I have seen).  The whole Araz family story was not remotely interesting to me, and it felt like they had as much screen time as Jack, if not more.  Also the nuclear power plants melting was not interesting to me, since we weren't really shown anything.  Although there was a lot going on in the first 12 episodes, it all felt a bit off.  Also at the beginning, only Jack and Chloe return from the previous season.  Things pick up a little bit starting in episode 7, when Tony FINALLY shows up, but still not as much as I wanted it to.

Now skip to episodes 13-24, and my review is the polar opposite.  To not spoil anything, I will just say that more characters return from previous seasons, and the action and drama pick up quickly.  The focus turns off the Araz family, and turns to Marwan, the big villain of the season.  To my surprise, starting at the half-way point, the season finally lived up to the 24 standard I'd come to expect from the show.  In fact, it was some of the best drama that the show has ever seen.  It gets especially exciting when the Chinese government gets involved, although I won't go into details in case anyone reading this hasn't seen the season yet.

It was a shame that the entire season couldn't have been like the second half because I felt that the first half was like pulling teeth.  I suppose that if you had to make a choice, it's better for the season to start weak and end strong, instead of the opposite.  In all fairness, I could only give the season a 4 out of 5 star review.  I would give the second half of the season a strong 5, but unfortunately I'd only give the first half 1 star, 2 at the most.  Having such a strong second half however made it impossible for me to not give the season a good review overall.  I also have to recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the show, just don't make a final judgement on the season until you get into the latter half.  Trust me, it'll be worth whatever you had to endure earlier with the season in order to get to that point.",1244505600,2,2391,4.213186813186813

Season Four introduces the usual agonizing plot twists but adds several exceptional new players: 'Edgar', Chloe's geeky (and ample) sidekick, Secretary of Defense Joseph Heller, his daughter Audrey, and the steely, purposeful terrorist Marwan.

Jack Bauer continues as the show's pivot: preternaturally principled in defense of his country, tactically beyond the pale, always on the edge of love but never quite achieving it.

The show is riveting, compelling, addictive. Superlatives need not apply, we've already got most of the available ones on salary and hard at work.

Just moments before they can do what in ""24"" always must be done to save the day, guess who shows up to mess up everything? You probably guessed it: a liberal. Well a guy that is a sort of talk radio Fox news sterotype of a liberal -- a lawyer from an organization called -get this- ""Amnesty Global"". Lol, For those not familiar, there is something in the real world called Amnesty International. It is an ""international non-governmental organization which defines its mission as 'to undertake research and action focused on preventing and ending abuses of the rights to physical and mental integrity, freedom of conscience and expression, and freedom from discrimination, within the context of its work to promote all human rights'"". Amnesty International does wonderful work throughout the world. But back to the show, so like this weasel lawyer spouts off a bunch of stuff about the Geneva Conventions and millions of people almost die because of it! Luckily lonestar Jack Bauer (J.B. are popular initials for super-agents) does the right thing, quiting the Terrorist Unit, Counter Terrorist Unit, becomes a private citizen and then is free to break the suspect's fingers. I was reading about an event sponsored by the ultra-rightwing Heritage Foundation at which ""24""'s producers along with three cast members appeared with Homeland Security Chief Michael Chertoff. A discussion was moderated by Rush Limbaugh about the public image of US terrorism policy.

""24"" repeatedly made the argument that torture works. ""24"" put forward to the American television viewing public the ""ticking time bomb"" case for torture: we must torture a suspect, or else thousands, maybe millions will die soon. Probably within the next hour. There has never been a ticking time bomb case but lone super-agent Jack Bauer faces them all the time. Yea it's just a TV show, but it's funny how TV has always both reflected and shaped the attitudes and views of the American public ain't it? Funny too how many of those who would shout the loudest it's just a TV show and unconcerned with violence and torture, are also often those more bothered by a naughty word or ""wardrobe malfunction"".

That was a big mistake on this season and kind of left part of the story incomplete for me. However the suspense lasted from the beginning to the end.

I would like to go on, but there are more reviews that can explain everything else more. I don't want to blow it for anyone, so I won't say much.

Is it me, or is this show starting to focus too much on CTU's personal relationships? I know everyone has their problems or unresolved solutions, but this season's love sections were a bit too much compared to the actual crimes that were being committed.

While the show does stretch the boundaries of believability at times it is still a very well made show and keeps you on the edge of your seat.

Because the concept of real time action is seriuosly hurt when we watch the episodes back to back wihtout the week-long intervals. The plot holes and absurdity of it all became much more clear to the viewer.

Anyway, Season Four reached the bottom of the barrel in the plot recordind the defense contractor company. Man, that was the most ludicrous history they ever wrote in 24... In order to not get cuaght and to not have bad publicity overt heir business, the company's directors are capable of having squads and more squads of hired killers and decide to use them to kil Federal agents and torture a civilian and, after this fails, tehy decide to use an eltromagnetic bomb to destroy all computers and electronic devices around, once again in front of the federal agent (bauer).

*  Plot

24 is a great show but even great shows have their bad seasons.  To enjoy this show you must suspend all disbelief.  The season begins with an train crash.  It turns out that someone on the train has a device that can comprimise every nuclear power plant in the nation.

Jack Bauer has been forced out of CTU and now works for the Secretary of Defense and is sleeping with his daughter, Audrey.  The Secretary sends Jack to CTU while he deals with his renagade son.  While at his son's he and his daughter are kidnapped by terrorists and put on trial.  Trial and his execution are to be broadcast on the internet.

Jack is pressed into service.  Using his renegade style, he rescues his boss and girlfriend.  But it turns out, that the kidnapping was just a cover.  The terrorists were behind the train bombing and used the intert surge to hack into the nuclear power plant computers and use the override device to melt down the power plants.

Jack finds out that one of the terrorists worked on the device at the defense contractor.  Jack and Audrey's husband, Paul, go to the defense contractor to see if they can get a thread on the terrorists.  The defense contractor agrees to cooperate but decide that it is not in their best interest.  Once Paul finds something, not only does the contractor send assassins in to kill Jack and Paul but mount an EMP that wipes out all electrical devices for 8 square miles.

Jack escapes with the information unscathed but Paul is shot pushing Jack out of the way.

One nuclear plant melts down in California but eventually, CTU is able to save the other 107.  But this was a cover too.  The real target was Air Force One.

The terrorists have arranged to have a mercenary steal a stealth bomber to shoot down Air Force One.  CTU uncovers this in time but cannot stop the stealth bomber and Air Force One is shot down.  The good news is the President is safe but hurt.  The bad news is that this is attack was a cover too.  The terrorists were after the Nuclear Football, a briefcase that can detonate all the US's nuclear bombs.

Oh, and did I mention that the terrorist just happened to steal a one of the largest nuclear warheads.  Now Jack must find the terrorist behind the attacks to stop the detonation.

Cloe gets a lead on someone involved with the latest attack which leads to a Chinese nuclear scientist.  But he is at the Chinese consulate and they will not give him up.  So Jack is authorized to kidnap him.  During the kidnapping the consulate gets killed by friendly fire.

Now this is just the highlights.  I didn't mention that Tony is out of jail and Michelle has left him but they are forced to work together in this crisis.  Or that the Vice President proves to be incompetent and blows the arrest of the lead terrorist.

For all this to happen, the US intellegence would have to be incompetent.  This is five major attacks that all have to happen in order for everything to happen.  That is everyone but Jack has to be incompetent.

Lets start with the train.  These are not government agents but employees of the a very powerful company with vast resources.  But this does not make sense, with a device so important, the company would use one of its corporate jets or helicopters, not a public train (that is so 50's!)

Next, the kidnapping and trial of the Secretary happened within a few hours.  In the morning when most people would be at work or school.  Therefore, all this internet activity would be unlikely.  It takes time for an event like this to happen.

And then, a company my try to hide illegal activity but to fry every electrical device within miles.  But this would be hard to cover and the law suits from this would sink any company.  Let alone the criminal charges.

Well enough of the over the top writing.

I do have to say that the acting in this is five star.  Keifer is great as usual but Cloe (Mary Lynn Rajskub) comes to life in this episode.  Alberta Walker is the lastest casualty as the new head of CTU.  Alberta is great but Erin Driscoll is no Madeline (La Femme Nikita).  Carlos Bernard and Rieko Aylesworth make the best out the mush they are given and prove that good actors can rise above mediocre writing. (Actually, everytime I see Rieko in any show (from SVU to ER), I realize that she is a hidden gem!)

If you are a die hard fan of 24 then buy this set, if you are a casual admirer then buy if you get a great deal.

Basically, a great cast in an absurd plot.

DVD EXTRAS:

As usual, the extras are really great including the Season 4 and Season 5 prequels (Or bridge).  But it would be better to put these great extras where they belong.  At the beginning of Disc 1 and the end of Disc 6, so they flow with what we are watching.

I love watching deleted scenes and this has a lot of them.  And they are great.  I also love having director commentary and usually watch them twice (once with commentary and then without).  But with this many scenes it would take over 2 hours to do this.  In future, I would suggest that Cassar just give a brief explanation before each scene - and also have a Play All option.

Also, they have the 24 minutesodes.  A promo that is totally seperate from the series but is linked to the initial plot line. (Based on unnessecary Chinese plotline and this.  I get a feeling that Keifer was in contract negotiations and the producers were testing this guy as a possible replacement.)

Also included are feaurettes on the series and aspects of the series.  As usual, these are outstanding.",1198713600,2,5573,4.42603550295858
2229931,3,B0007P14OE,"Season 4 begins with Jack Bauer working for the Secretary of Defense, James Heller. We have a new president in the form of John Keeler and most of the faces in CTU are also new. In addition, Jack has a new girlfriend in the form of Audrey Raines, daughter to Jack's boss. Jack, Audrey, and Heller are visiting L.A. when terrorist activity begins to heat up in a way that involves them very directly. Needless to say, it doesn't take long for Jack to be thrust back into action to stop the bad guys. Normally, I write reviews that offer a bit more info on the plot, but with this show I'm not comfortable doing that. Too much of the punch that 24 has to offer comes from all the twists and turns of the story and giving those away is not fair to new viewers.

As mentioned, there are many new faces in the cast this season and most of them work pretty well. Curtis Manning makes a good no-nonsense agent with a solid presence. Erin Driscoll is the new head of CTU Los Angeles and looks like a moronic bureaucrat in the first couple of episodes but then mercifully starts to act in a much more competent fashion. In addition to all the new faces, a few old friends return as the season progresses. A surprise absence was Kim Bauer, for which I was highly grateful. Probably the worst character depiction was Chloe O'Brian. She was quirky and abrasive in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/24-Season-Three/dp/B0002XVQSU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">24 - Season Three</a>&nbsp;but I liked her for the most part. This season, she is just rude and condescending every time she opens her mouth no matter what the situation is. It's so over the top that it really doesn't make any sense at all and is just irritating to watch.

Without giving away specifics, the plot is another case of very mixed quality ideas. The first half to two-thirds of the season is relatively tight and holds up well but then it stumbles badly. You start seeing things like a terrorist driving a jeep on a deserted road in the desert and yet a CTU helicopter can't find him. A company is afraid that computer records might make them look bad so they take actions that would be guaranteed to land the executives in jail for life and get the corporation shut down forever. A man is badly wounded and instead of taking him to a hospital, they take him to the little clinic at CTU. All of these things are contrivances to make things harder for Jack either immediately or later on, but they are so poorly conceived that they badly undermine the credibility of the show as you watch it.

Trying to give 24-Season 4 a rating in stars is difficult because the season fluctuates so wildly in quality almost from minute to minute. At it's best, it keeps you on the edge of your seat. At it's worst, you'll roll your eyes and grind your teeth as yet another arbitrary obstacle is thrown in Jack's way that makes no sense whatsoever. The soap opera that occurs between various characters also gets very tiresome. After watching the first four seasons on DVD (I've never watched the show on TV) I can say that more and more plot elements are getting recycled and the magic is starting to wear off for me. I may buy the next season at some point, but I'm ready for some time off after watching this one.

The villains in this season were fantastic (some ""might"" get away to add to the suspense of maybe coming back again to reprise their role for another season). This is why you watch action/suspense shows like this because they are absolutely fun. If you are not going to watch 24 for fun, then I do not recommend. I thought from 1st episode to the last had you on the edge of your seat waiting for ""what next"" and just wanting to see more.

However, I was very glad to watch all the DVDs, and finally I was not dissapointed at all.
Maybe if you know alredy the ""recipe"", you will see very few surprises...but nobody can really tell you that it's boring or with slow action. Perhaps phrases and key words are not so distinguihed as the other seasons. Highly recommended if you are a 24 fan.",1189123200,,451,4.512195121951219

Things started to look better when Tony Almeida suddenly showed up and the show went into high gear and got even better when Michelle Dessler (those two have great chemistry together; you could feel their love), Mike Novak and President Palmer turned up. My favorite scenes in the season were when Jack held up the gas station store, Mrs. Araz poisoned Debbie, when that couple camping in the desert came across the ""football"", when Jack forces the doctors to save a witness' life and let Paul Raines die, and that absolutely riveting scene where that first deadly female assassin impersonates an FBI agent. Also, I don't watch much TV, but this is the first time I ever heard Chinese nationals speaking official Mandarin Chinese rather than Cantonese. I thought that was so cool, and also that they didn't use any of those stock Asian American actors you usually always see on other shows and movies. My only disappointment with this season is that there was no scandalous side story to make things interesting; bring back Sherry Palmer!",1188259200,3,1488,4.932270916334661
2229937,5,B0007P14OE,"Even though it's one of the more popular shows on TV, I kind of stopped watching 24 around the start of season 3. After missing a couple of nights and being impatient about episode reruns, I kind of grew out of the show, watching the occasional episode. Being bored and hearing great things about season 4, on a complete whim I decided to buy the season and sure enough I got my money's worth. While it does have some non-nagging issues, it's compelling TV anyways.

Fired from CTU, Jack Bauer is now the advisor for the Secretary of Defense, James Heller while in a long relationship with Heller's daughter, Audrey. But he gets called into action when a train derails and Heller and Audrey are abducted by a terrorist faction. He quickly gets pulled back into CTU in trying to find the perpetrators and finds that the terrorist's leader has a lot more planned than a kidnapping.

Despite the fact it's one of the more compelling shows on TV, it's also one of the more difficult to revisit. On first viewing, you are hooked, period watching most likely several episodes or in my case, several discs at once. However since you already know how cliffhangers and plot threads will play out, you're more watching it for fun rather than an urge to find out what happens next. Not to mention because it's a season-long story and not mini-stories a la CSI or Law and Order, it makes the show difficult for specific episode watching. You might go ""man that one part with that firefight, that was cool!"" but you'd go ""wait, what episode was that on anyway""? But then again you're so completely enthralled you probably wouldn't care after awhile.

The show also requires massive suspension of disbelief as you're almost quite sure not this much can happen in this time, let alone this quickly. Leads immediately connect to each other in record time and then of course there's a larger plot than just a kidnapping which makes you wonder if the season's main villain is just super intelligent or really lucky. But you knew that about 24 already right? As long as it'll be good TV, it'll work and luckily for us, they find ways to make it work.

I'm not sure if it's the best season since I haven't really watched most of them but despite its questionable rewatch value and the incredulous events, no show can hook many a viewer than 24.",1188259200,2,2324,4.5927710843373495

As common to 24 however, there are a lot of things that happen that are quite frustrating :p.  But really this is a great season of 24 and worth watching whether you are a fan or not.

On a side note, I got my slim pack of Season 4 at a sale at an electonics store, I can't believe the ridiculous price Amazon is asking for these slim packs online.",1183852800,10,480,4.129032258064516

""24"" offers a lot of people running around to an emotionally manipulative soundtrack, and lots of cell phones beeping (maybe the cell phone industry paid for the endless product placement), and Arab people plotting our destruction.  The storyline runs like a press release from the Pentagon.  I wouldn't be at all surprised if people in the bowels of the Pentagon were writing the script.

2229971,4,B0007P14OE,"Ah, How refreshing that Jack's daughter is out of the show.  Unfortunately she isn't dead.  She really is the Jar Jar Binks of 24 (albeit an much better looking one), and it would be just as satisfying seeing her killed as it would have been to see him beheaded by a lightsaber.  Maybe they won't think to bring her back, or if they do maybe Mark Hammil could guest star as a washed out stick up man, and shoot her in a robbery gone bad.

Without going too much into the plot, this show has all the elements of 24 that make it good, cliff hangers, violence, torture, infltration of CTU, superiors that are disagreeable, plot twists, immunity papers, good presidents, bad presidents, Tony (who by the way has always reminded me of Moe on the Simpsons) etc.  Unfortunately, all these things were used in other seasons.  At least Jack isn't usning the ""H"" any more.

I was also starting to like agent Castle.  He was shaping up to be the ""Wedge"" character that survived all the episodes, but didn't really have that large of a part.  Unfortunately, he was killed giving in to a terrorist.  I would like to see somebody tell one of the bad guys NO, and just get shot, rather than help the villans and die later.

There really is nothing new here, infact you could skip many of the middle episodes, and just watch the previews and probably be as satisfied.  I did also enjoy watching the son of the Secretary of Defence (aka the man Ted Kennedy always wanted to be) repeatedly tortured.

I am giving this season 4 stars because I guess 3.5 rounds up.  It is entertaining, however the ending could be better in that Jack would have stayed dead and they revived him at the start of the next season, or had a special summer episode where he came back to life again.

My recommendation is that if you are still watching this show after last season, you will be satisfied renting this one.",1181692800,5,1879,4.437317784256559
2229972,5,B0007P14OE,"All Jack Bauer wants is to enjoy his new job as an advisor to Secretary of Defense, Heller.  He's even become seriously involved with the secretary's daughter, Audrey.  He's been out of CTU for 18 months after the new director fired him because she didn't trust him after his heroine addiction.  Jack is obviously happy with his new job and new relationship.  However, one has to ask, is this really the kind of life that Jack Bauer wants?  It might be.  But even he realizes very quickly that he's much better at something else: stopping terrorists.  Right from the get-go, Jack is visiting CTU to discuss the budget.  There is a situation brewing, and Jack can't help but give his input on a mission.  Someone during this season says that ""Jack is the best at what he does.""

CTU is a different place now.  Tony is gone.  Michelle is now assistant director of Los Angeles Division of CTU.  Kim is happily settled down with Chase.  There are new faces at CTU now, and a new crisis that may very well be greater than anything they've faced before.

Jack faces the most cunning and dangerous terrorist to date.  His name is Habib Marwan who is brilliantly played by South African actor, Arnold Vosloo.  This is a plan that has been in the works for years.  There are many terrorist cells involved, and they've got many attacks ready to go.  However, as with many ""24"" plots, not everything is as it seems.  It may take a good number of episodes to really grasp what the overall goal of the terrorists is, and what they're doing.  I won't give away any details here about the different plots.  It's important that viewer be given the fun and suspense of finding that out.  But just when you think one crisis has been averted, a new one pops into place.  But is there a connection between them?  Or are they separate?

New faces here are Erin Driscoll, played by Alberta Watson, as the new director of CTU branch in Los Angeles.  She's a hard woman who is not very bending or compromising on things.  She is not at all comfortable with having Jack at CTU, and even less so when he becomes involved.  But, even Driscoll can't deny that Jack is needed.  She's a smart, professional woman, who seems seasoned and knows what to do.

Chloe is still at CTU as their top analyst, whose annoying personality is still fully present.  She always manages to state the obvious at the wrong time, as if she's the only one who sees what everyone else already understands.  Many of her interactions are funny, and she's still likeable because she's so good at her job.  I'd hate to think how the terrorists would be stopped without Chloe at the helm of analyzing data and finding links.

A new computer analyst is Edgar Stiles, played by Louis Lombardi.  I like Edgar because he represents everyone.  He represents the common employee.  This isn't to say he isn't good at his job, because he is.  He is simply a bit naive to how things work.  He doesn't know when to speak up sometimes or when to keep his mouth shut.  Either way, Lombardi plays him with an almost child-like innocence; a man who is finally being baptized by fire during this crisis.

Season 4 pretty much starts right off and never lets up.  This is a thrill ride that pauses only briefly before taking off again.  When it's finally over, you almost have to remind yourself to breathe again.  It's that intense, but in a good way!  I don't think there is any other episodic television series that keeps the thrills, action, suspense, and overall intrigue going for 24 straight episodes.  Season 4 is the same as other seasons of 24; once you start, you find it very difficult to stop.  I don't know anyone who watches 24 on DVD and is able to stop after a single episode.  You always feel that you HAVE to find out what happens next!  The genius of the writing should be credited for that.

Once again, the performances of everyone, especially Kiefer Sutherland, is top-notch.  Jack Bauer isn't the guy you want for a friend, but he is the guy you want in situations like this.  The biggest reason for that is that he is willing to do whatever it takes, whether it be putting himself in a hornet's nest of terrorists, or risking the lives of those he cares about to save the country.  Secretary Heller explains to his daughter, ""we need people like Jack who will do whatever is necessary.""  Americans have truly found themselves a bonafide hero in Jack Bauer, and I think that's one of the reasons that people love to watch ""24.""",1181520000,4,4479,4.517456359102244
2229973,3,B0007P14OE,"Firstly, I want to thank the profit-maximizing, selfish, money-hungry producers of 24 for coming to their senses and writing Kim out of the show...entirely!

That is the best thing about this season.

Sadly, however, there aren't many other positive things that can be said about it.  And when I say that, please don't misinterpret me:  While there isn't anything flagrantly wrong with this season, there isn't a lot of things remarkable about it.

As some previous reviewers have said, the beginning is fast moving, clever, and exciting and so is the ending (probably the BEST ending to a 24 season ever).  But the middle is the weakest because the writers recycled old ideas (and didn't execute them as well as in previous seasons anyways): As in Season 1, there's a mole in CTU.  Like in Season 2, Arabs are the villains and nuclear technology is a part of their plan.  As in Season 3, a spouse must decide whether to help save their loved one or do their job.  And the president should realize by now that it will save some time if he simply gives Jack a bunch of immunity papers to put in his pocket and hand out as he captures the the bad guys who are (as always) only going to give information in exchange for immunity.

I don't think that the show has reached the bottom of the barrel just yet, but there's no denying that it isn't as fresh as it once was.  Probably the most memorable thing to happen in the middle is Chloe briefly showing off her Rombo side (I won't spoil it and trust me, it's cool).  And because the middle portion takes up the bulk of the time, I can't give this a high rating or recommend that you buy it.

(...)

I say this every time I review a 24 season, but THE only true season of 24 that is worth absolutely every penny is the first season.  The rest are for die-hard 24 fans.",1181433600,3,1813,4.370149253731343
2229974,5,B0007P14OE,"Season was a great, Season three was better, and Season four even outdid the other two seasons (don't ask me about Season 2 - it wasn't good).  Definitely worth the watch!",1180051200,,171,4.516129032258065
2229975,2,B0007P14OE,"..an' don'cha come back no mo', no mo', no mo', no mo'... Or, as that avid fan, Johann Sebastian Bach, having seen it, put it, in the words of BWV82, ""Ich habe genug"" (That's enough). I think I've come to the end of my ""24"" road.

It's not that it isn't exciting and often tense; it is. The action scenes are well executed and adrenalin-filled, and the cliff-hangers frequently, agonisingly cliff-hangerish. In addition, I've become fond of some of the characters - Chloe, amateur computer genius, professional social disaster, is my heroine. By opening her mouth only to change feet, she adds the only glimmering of humour in an otherwise relentlessly serious show. Admittedly, it can be hard to see the funny side of being blown up, infected, shot, poisoned, gassed, tortured or irradiated, but a little levity helps to offset the grimness and provide some welcome contrast.

However, I want some plot. Some sensible, semi-plausible plot. And that is absent in this season. We get not one terrorist plot, but a multiplicity of interconnected plots, in defiance of the real world principle that the more complex is a plot, the more likely it is to go wrong. Moreover, all of these occur in the same 24 hours and all are run by the same Moriartyish figure (any resemblance to previous Moriartyish figures, living or dead, is purely coincidental). Given what we now know of US intelligence competence and inter-agency cooperation, I guess we can be glad that such people don't really exist. If they did, they'd watch television, know to avoid the LA area and Jack Bauer completely and do their dastardly deeds on the East Coast - given the 24-hour real-time format, Jack couldn't get over there for 3 episodes, by which time the audience who survived the terror attack would have died of boredom. (And of course if Moriarty blew up D.C., nobody might actually care).

Anyway, the individual plots themselves vary from improbable to totally ludicrous, their combination is daft beyond measure, and all culminate in the final six hours or so in a conclusion of such mind-boggling absurdity that one (this one anyway) shakes one's head in disbelief that anyone could write such stuff. As the old Dilbert line has it; I admire their ability to get paid for this. Suspension of disbelief sometimes fails catastrophically.

Then there is Jack Bauer. Jack of the Charmed Life, Jack the Invincible, the Indestructible, the Inexhaustible, the Miracle Worker, the All-Wise. I find the character (and I do think Kiefer Sutherland plays him well) appealing and appalling in equal measure. Do people as utterly ruthless and single-minded as Jack exist? I hope not. In any case, I find Jack less and less credible as a normal mortal and more and more like a superhero. I would dearly love to believe that we are protected by superheroes, capable of leaping tall buildings with a single bound, but recent history has shown that the world is somewhat bereft of such people. Thankfully the world seems equally bereft of Moriartys.

One bothersome aspect is the ever more frequent recourse to torture, and as a first, rather than a last, resort. Moreover, it always works in getting the right information at the right time. Amnesty Who? But then this show is probably so popular at least partially because it's a picture of how post-9/11 America sees itself, surrounded and infiltrated by nasties with Middle Eastern accents, and fighting for its existence, with no holds barred. One could nearly be forgiven for thinking that the show is US Administration propaganda, designed to fuel Americans' paranoia and keep up the atmosphere of fear so necessary to sustain the current Administration.

In short, in order to enjoy ""24"", it seems one simply has to be in on the joke, as it were, accepting both Jack and plot(s) and the basic principle of the show that nothing exceeds like excess. A sort of escapist fairy tale for grown-ups, if you like. I find that I don't like so much any more. And so I bid a fond farewell to any more ""24"" purchases, with slight feelings of sadness. It was good while it lasted, but I simply can't justify buying what will most certainly be More Of The Same. (If I feel the need, it's bound to be on one of the German channels).

2229978,2,B0007P14OE,"I remember hearing that Season 3 lost ratings halfway due to a mixing of plotlines that seemed a desparate ploy by the writers to continue the plot. For Season 3 it worked alright in the end but Season 4 is a bit of a mess. It is much like the war in Iraq. The beginning is very well planned and faithfully executed and then everything goes to pieces. Up until the release of James Heller and Audrey everything goes well. And then the writers start grasping for straws. The real time formula has long since been abandoned, the most comic example being when Chloe is called back to work. She gets dressed and over there, checked in the building, reinstated and back to work in something like 3-5 real time minutes. I hope she lived close. And also, I don't know about you but if terrorists kidnapped the Secretary of Defense and planned to execute him AND his daughter live on the internet, shot down Air Force One, caused a freaking nuclear reactor to go off and then planned to fire a nuclear missile at some place in the States my confidence in the country would never be restored no matter how many tortures of possible ASSOCIATES (not actual terrorists mind) of terrorists the government brought about.

While Season 4 is a good bunch of DVDs for those of us who are already 24 fanatics (hence the 4 stars), the pace here was unrealistically fast. A worker has a full, formatted report on the boss's desk in 10 minutes. A person gets arrested, and 30 seconds later, they know all about it across town. A guy's mother dies, and 3 hours later he's almost completely forgetten about it. And so on. (I didn't mention any names here to avoid spoiling anything.)

In contrast, Season One has a much slower, more realistic pace. And as a result, ironically, it's more action-packed and suspenseful than the explosion-a-minute action-fest that is Season 4.",1173744000,4,784,4.7153284671532845

2230003,4,B0007P14OE,"This is another great season of 24 but it is not the best one. That is no surprise since it has set such a high standard for television drama. So instead of being superlative, it is merely great.

There are new characters and new leaders in this season along with some old standbys. There are also some old villains making surprise appearances. With the new cast, they combine for a powerful season and, as always, it is a season full of plot twists and unexpected surprises.

There are many out there who condemn 24 as a show that marginalizes Muslims. This season indeed has some nasty Muslim villains. I wonder if those same detractors noticed that some of the real heroes of this season are Muslims as well...and some of the worst villains are Anglo-American males. The point this series makes over and over again is that people who do bad things are bad and their religion has nothing to do with it.

Episode synopses appear below:

7-8 AM The season starts of with a whimper that quickly develops into a bang. Jack Bauer has not been back to CTU since he was fired. Today, he is supposed to go there with the Secretary of Defense to meet with the current director about the budget. The Secretary is unable to go and sends Jack in his stead. The new director does NOT like having him around and is more interested in turf control than in anything useful. While there, Jack gets to witness the takedown of some suspects in the bombing of a train. He recognizes one of them and suspects more is in store. The director will not listen to him, however. Jack takes matters into his own hands and extracts the information violently. The train was a diversion. The real target is the father of his lover, the Secretary of Defense. Jack is just placing the call when the man and the girl are kidnapped.

8-9 AM  The new director at CTU is still more worried about protecting her turf than in doing her job. She wants to do her job but doing it in a way that reflects well on her is more important. As such, she arrests Jack because he did not follow the rules. He gets a break from Chloe who still trusts him more than her. He learns that a friend of hers has stumbled onto a possible link involving an Internet virus. She had told the director about it earlier but had been shuffled aside. Now, her source's family have been killed and Jack gets the OK to try and bring him in. He's too late. Other people are in trouble too. The terrorist leader has his teenaged son act as a courier to take a briefcase to a meet. He is followed by his suspicious American girlfriend. As a result, the boy is in trouble and the girl is probably going to be eliminated. It is apparent that there are lots of leaks and that the bad guys are getting their information from the inside but nobody knows where yet. As the hour closes, an internet broadcast shows the Secretary of Defense. The bad guys are preparing to execute him live on the web.

9-10 AM Jack is following the guy who kidnapped the web geek but is doing so without authorization. In fact, CTU wants him brought in. He manages to rescue the guy in the nick of time and heads off after the terrorist who leaves him for dead. He is still having trouble getting the resources he needs and only Chloe is serving as a sort of go between for him and officialdom. Meanwhile, the teenage terrorist is torn up with angst about his American girlfriend. His father wants he dead. He goes to his mom for help only to learn that she has lured the girl over in order to do the whacking herself. Jack is still trying to follow his terrorist but he has to find a way to delay him while Chloe get satellite coverage set up. He is running out of time so he does the only thing he can to slow the guy down without arousing suspicion. He knocks over (robs) the convenience store the terrorist is using to get something to drink. It's LA. Its believable.

10-11 AM It's a tense standoff as Jack tries to rob a convenience store. He is doing it only to buy time until a satellite can be tasked to follow the terrorist. It seems, though, that just about everyone wants to visit that convenience store at that time. Finally, he learns that the satellite has been set up and he breaks out with the terrorist as his hostage. He lets the terrorist go in the hopes that he will lead him to the missing Secretary. Unfortunately the CTU director has found out about the scheme and sends the police to home in on Jack. She is about to pick up the terrorist too but it is pointed out to her that too many people already know that Jack was right and she was wrong. She's a bit distracted, though. She learns that her schizophrenic daughter is busy having a breakdown and she reroutes resources to prevent her daughter from being arrested. The teen terrorist makes a big decision to go with the girlfriend rather than the parents but his mom has anticipated him. She solves the problem herself. Jack is hot on the trail until he is taken into custody by the police.

11-Noon  Jack manages to get the CTU director to vouch for him and put him in command of a team going after the Secretary. He is closing in when a traffic stop blows the program. The terrorist is let go too easily so he gets suspicious and kills himself before he can be captured and questioned. Jack still has a hint of where they are going. He is ready to lead a strike team but is called off because the ""trial"" is getting too close. In order to avoid embarrassment, the President has decided to send in a missile to take out the whole site. The pres is not the only untrustworthy character. The CTU director is still too worried about turf and uses this instance to begin a purge; a contract laborer in CTU is clearly out to advance herself at everyone else's expense; a psychotic daughter is distracting the CTU director and, just to keep things tense, the terror kid who was having second thoughts is apparently over them.

12-1 PM Jack's one man assault is successful is rescuing the Secretary and his daughter but a few get away. They learn that the train wreck from the first episode was just a diversion for the kidnapping. Worse, they have reason to believe that the kidnapping is just a diversion for worse things to come. They need information but those who can provide it are reticent about doing so. Among these is the estranged son of the Secretary. With great pain, the Secretary authorizes more serious questioning techniques. Leaks are still plaguing the CTU. The contract hacker is apparently working for someone else. The Terror teen learns that his own father considered him to be a risk and has authorized his execution. This pleases neither the teen nor the mom.

1-2 PM The Secretary's daughter needs to be taken to a private security firm to try and ID one of the terrorists who took her; she remembers seeing him at a party they both attended and the firm has the tapes. Unfortunately, the mole in CTU sets them up for a hit. They barely make it out because Jack realizes the he can no longer trust CTU. He calls somebody he can trust, Tony, from the previous seasons. The terror mom decides to try and save the terror teen but the terror dad suspects. He ambushes them and now they are fugitives. From this we learn that the terror dad is reporting to somebody even higher up who is not happy. Also not happy is the CTU director. Her daughter goes into cardiac arrest when the wrong drugs are given. To ease the tension some, one of CTU's programmers manages to find a way to shut down the nuclear power plants that are threatened. Unfortunately, he is not able to get them all.

2-3 PM Jack finally has a lead as to who can shut down the nuclear disaster. The Secretary also manages to use his assets to track down the mole in CTU. Unfortunately, it is the wrong person. This is not found out before some...aggressive questioning takes place. Luckily, they do manage to find the right mole and she tries to make her escape. She is apprehended just as she learns her controller wants her dead. That seems to be the case for Jack's prisoner to. Just as they get him, he is assassinated. Terror mom and terror teen are not having much better luck. Because of her wounds, they head for an ER but there the police are called because she has a gunshot wound. They too get away.

3-4 PM CTU has had its biggest leads assassinated out from under them but they get lucky when they manage to trace the location of the cell phone of Terror Mom and Terror Teen. They break in and take the mom into custody and just barely manage to keep her from killing herself. Unfortunately, Terror Teen is out at a hospital trying to get some pain medication for mom. He is talking to his uncle, a pharmacist at the hospital. The uncle is suspicious and not a terrorist. He calls Terror Dad who tells him that jr. is a druggie. CTU heads to pick the boy up but gets there only in time to wind up in a standoff. Dad has his gun pointed at the boy. The mother, who has brokered a clemency deal for the boy, refuses to talk unless the boy is safe. With that, the episode is over.

4-5 PM  Jack manages to take both the terror teen and the terror dad alive. His plans break apart, though, on two fronts. Terror teen is still hacked off about dad ordering him to be killed so he takes an opportunistic shot and settles dad for good. Unfortunately, terror mom does not really no a whole lot. All she is able to give them is an address. When it is investigated, they find a new lead that leads right back to the Secretary of Defense and his daughter. Another lead comes from the interrogation of the mole captured at CTU. She is still trying to slime her way into a better position and reveals the existence of a computer where she might get some useful data. The catch is that she has to be present to give her thumbprint to the security program. Against many people's better judgment, she is taken to the site under escort. What they find is surprising and quite unhealthy. The CTU director is coming to grips with not being in Jack Bauer's league. She compensates by getting even more protective and devious about her turf.

5-6 PM CTU finally homes in on where the nuclear gizmo is located. To do so, they have had to violate lots and lots of civil rights. These include the rights of such persons as the husband of Jack's girlfriend. She is beginning to believe him and he MAY be innocent, but that is still up in the air. As they close in, the CTU director's daughter becomes more and more of a distraction with terrible consequences for everyone. CTU manages to shut down the nuclear meltdowns. They do so at the cost of letting the ostensible mastermind escape. The season is only half over. More is definitely to come.

6-7 PM CTU is trying to get things sorted out after averting a nuclear meltdown but the situation is chaos. The director is incapacitated by the apparent suicide of her daughter and Tony is tasked to fill in. Jack and the soon-to-be ex hubby of the Secretary head for the company that unknowingly employed the head terrorist. They want to track him down and see if he has anything else up his sleeve. The problem is that the company is paranoid that they will somehow be blamed for the fiasco. They undertake to try and deceive CTU and destroy any data on the premises. Taking out several square miles of downtown LA does not seem to bother them.

7-8 PM The plot has certainly thickened. The EMP bomb has meant chaos in downtown LA. Most of the episode is concerned with Jack and his romantic rival trying to get extricated while mercenaries from the company that set off the bomb try and track them down. The get help from the young, middle eastern gun store owners whose store they hole up in. (Anyone claiming that middle eastern=terrorist should see this episode to set the record straight.) Since CTU is working blind, Jack knows that his only hope is to attract their attention. He does so by engaging the mercs in a firefight. They survive and are rescued and have a vital printout to get back to CTU for decoding when one of the bad guys, (Anglo male) makes a last effort to kill Jack. He gets the jilted husband instead. This is a shame since he has shown himself to be a good guy and since the girlfriend will probably be really hacked. The episode closes with the revelation of what might be the real target. There is none bigger.

8-9 PM CTU still does not know what the big plan is but they know that there is one. In a desperate attempt to get information, Jack comes up with a scheme to get himself turned over to the bad guys by the terror mom. He talks her into it by promising to get her and her son into the witness protection program. She does her job and gets him to the head honcho but he is suspicious. When she fails his loyalty test, she and Jack are in big trouble. Meanwhile, a fake fighter pilot is getting ready to take to the air.

9-10 PM  Jack is a prisoner and CTU still does not know what the big picture is. The terror plot continues, though as an infiltrated pilot prepares to go airborne with a stolen F-117. Because of a few glitches, a diversion is needed so that CTU will not notice the missing pilot. The head terrorist contrives a plot in which the terror teen is exchanged for Jack. Seeing nothing else to do, they go through with it but nothing goes as it should. Jack is recovered but the boy is taken. The pilot is about to launch and they still don't know what the plot is.

10-11 PM The pilot is in the air and his target is a big one but CTU does not know what it is. They head to his apartment to find clues and encounter a woman posing as an FBI agent. They think she is legit but she is hunting for the same information they are. When Jack figures out what is going on, he notifies the target but not before it is hit. It is unsure whether the target survived.

11 - Midnight  The president is alive but in no condition to lead the country. That puts the succession on the vice president which poses 2 problems. He seems to be a weak man to begin with and his chief of staff is the slimeball who caused so much trouble for the last administration. Meanwhile, Jack is sent out to rescue the football, the briefcase containing the nuclear codes. It has been found by some innocent campers but the head terrorist wants them. It seems knocking off Air Force One was just a pretext to get the codes. Jack manages to rescue the football but there is something missing.

12-1 AM A lucky lead gives CTU the identity of an associate of the mastermind. They manage to close in just as the suspect is meeting with another unsavory character. Mr. Unsavory kills the terrorist as CTU closes in and claims to have been an innocent citizen defending himself. Everyone knows this is wrong so they get ready to do some intensive interrogation. That is just what the mastermind is afraid of and he places a discreet call to the ACLU types who get a court order to stop the interrogation. Since a nuclear warhead has been stolen, time is of the essence but the weak VP does not want to cloud the first act of his paranoid presidency. Jack decides to take the interrogation into his own hands by resigning from CTU and acting as a private citizen. He gets his information but it is doubtful whether it is enough.

1-2 AM Chloe become a field agent!...but that comes later. The president is hacked about Jack doing things independently and orders the Secret Service to pick him up immediately, even though he is warned that Jack is about to get the mastermind. He has been tracked to a club where he is running his operation. The Secret Service shows up at the worse possible time and tips off the terrorists to police presence. He gets away. This leads the president to realize that he may not be the best man for the job. His chief of staff advises him to call in the previous president to run the situation. (Maybe the guy did learn his lesson.) Chloe gets a tip from the suspicious girlfriend of one of the terrorists. Because they are shorthanded, CTU sends her out with a team to decode the information on the computer. Real agents are supposed to protect her but the bad guys eliminate them. Chloe has to take matters into her own hands with deadly results.

2-3 AM From Chloe's lead, CTU finds a connection to a Chinese national who has holed up in the consulate. The Chinese are willing to cooperate but diplomatic niceties take time...longer that the timetable for detonation of the warhead. The former president authorizes a clandestine operation to go into the consulate and take the man by force. This happens but the ""Chinese Fire Drill"" of the guards causes problems. In their wild shooting, they not only put a bullet into the terror suspect, they manage to kill their own consul. The diplomatic consequences are going to be grim. For Jack, it gets grimmer still. The suspect is dying and needs immediate surgery. Unfortunately, the surgeon is currently working on the husband of his girlfriend. Since the information is vital to many lives, Jack pulls his gun and forces the surgeon to work on the suspect with fatal consequences for the husband...and Jack's love life.

3-4 AM The Chinese are furious over the break in of their consulate and they want blood. Unfortunately, their cameras reveal the possible face of one of the CTU agents and the Chinese head of security demands an interview at CTU. CTU does a fair job of stonewalling but is hampered by the acting president, who no longer trusts former president Palmer, and by the need to appease the Chinese. Just when it looks like the Chinese will get no further information, an analyst lets something slip. While this is going on, Jack is in the field. Interrogation has at last yielded the location of the terror mastermind. They bring him down only learn that the stolen warhead had been mounted on a missile and the missile has just launched.

4-5 AM While going through the mastermind's cell phone, CTU finds a connection. His phone contains the number of the son of the Secretary of Defense, who has not been heard from since the first few episodes. They bring the boy in blubbering about his rights but he will not say what he knows; only that he is not a terrorist. His sister pleads with him and tell him that he will be tortured but that does not work. Finally, dad gets him to put out. He is gay and had an assignation with a guy who tapped his phone. Now, CTU is after the guy (part of a couple). They find him but he is dead and his accomplice has taken off with Tony as a hostage.

5-6 AM In an emotional roller coaster, the female terrorist plays upon the emotions at CTU bargaining with Tony's life. In the end, his estranged wife sees her responsibility to the millions who may be impacted by the missile so she shares the relevant information. Jack is ready to take her down when she apparently blows up herself and Tony it a fit over having been betrayed. Everyone thinks Tony and the terrorist are dead but Jack has doubts. He refuses to pull out, contrary to While House orders, and does manage to rescue Tony and take down the terrorist. It seems they will finally get the clue they need but the Chinese have other ideas. They are still hacked about the death of their consul and manage to kidnap the CTU agent who was identified but they want bigger fish. Under threat, they get him to talk and implicate Jack.

6-7 AM Jack does the impossible. He captures the mastermind, gets the information that lets the nuclear missile be destroyed and actually survives to tell the tale. His survival is inconvenient for the acting president, though. To placate the Chinese, he agrees to hand Jack over to them. Some are worried that puts sensitive information at risk but the president forbids any assassination attempt, he just doesn't do so very convincingly. One of his aides decides to take matters into his own hands and the former president, Palmer, gets wind of the situation. The only way out for everyone is for Jack to cease to exist. Jack agrees and, conveniently dies.

Season 5 Prequel Jack has been dead for a year. Now somebody has hacked into Chloe's files and learned that he is alive. That same person wants him dead. It's a long car chase as Jack leaves a clandestine meeting with Chloe meant to inform him of what is going on.",1171324800,6,20269,4.428379828326181
2230004,5,B0007P14OE,"This is an astonishing accomplishment. Great entertainment and an enormously creative work. Talking about the plot or saying it's suspense won't do it justice.

Like many of the other readers, I bought Season 1 got hooked, and have now watched the 4 seasons in little more than a month and am now ready for season 5. Without commericals and the ability to move from week to week without waiting, the Season is incredibly intense and addictive. I read much more than watch tv --but this is like great literature. Here's why --

1] the main character, Jack Bauer, is multi dimensional and complex; yes, he's an action hero --resourceful and ruthless, but he has a human side which is embedded in his character that makes you think about him as a person not just a stick figure;

2] the plotting is extremely intricate; it is amazing how well conceived each season is and how what happened first the prior week and then the prior year all ties together;

3] the acting is first rate --the situations at times stretch credulity but the quality of the acting makes the plot twists as believable as possible;

4] the level of suspense is unrelenting and unpredictable.

--all in all watching 24 is by analogy what it must have been  like to read Dickens' when his novels were first published as periodic installments. And I think this series will endure though I am not predicting it will be watched as broadly as Dickens is read!",1171152000,8,1424,4.649402390438247

If you purchase the DVD, you would give 10/10 because there are 39 deleted/extended scenes packaged together with the DVD of this series (which includes prequel of this season and season 5). The classification of the deleted scenes may vary from redundant, ridiculous (suddenly gas comes out when entering the wrong password on a PC), unnecessary or glorifying terrorism and the terrorists e.g. the terror planner meets his wife and son and the casualties from terror attacks.

This series may inspire more terror attacks on US soil, but it also inspire Americans to defend their country better.",1170374400,,838,4.901408450704225
2230007,5,B0007P14OE,"Love the show. Period. Have just finished watching the first 5 seasons (something of a marathon over the last month).

(Warning: some spoilers ahead.)

The first 3 seasons were good. But season 4 was far more complicated. Just as CTU seems to come to grips with one attack, it leads into something more sinister and larger than they had expected. The twists and turns just seem to keep coming, up through the very end. a very good season.

As to packaging and the discs themselves: the first 4 seasons come in fold-out packaging + outer sleeve, much like the Highlander series and a few others. The first discs contain the episodes themselves, and the last disc contains some bonus materials. There is also an option on the episode discs to view deleted or extended scenes in-line to the episode. Cool feature.

Season 4 continues to do a good job with chapter breaks, scene selection menus, and abonus features. Of course I don't have a large-screen/wide-screen TV or surround sound, so I can't test under all conditions. But if there were any video or audio issues I didn't notice them. Perhaps some moire/color issues in scenes with close parallel-line patterns. But I've noticed that on any number of DVD releases of other series from other studios, so I wouldn't say there was any more in 24 than other series.

Overall, I highly recommend this for anyone who hasn't seen 24, and who likes the spy/thriller type show. If you liked Alias and/or La Femme Nikita, you'll probably like 24 as well. There are some ""intense"" scenes and probably some harsh language, so preview episodes before showing it to any youngsters, if at all.",1170288000,,1632,4.773049645390071

2230009,5,B0007P14OE,"An outstanding series, 24 Season Four brings to the screen the ongoing adventures of CTU agent Jack Bauer.

The setting is Los Angeles one and a half years after the virus incident, and Federal (CTU) agent Jack Bauer is trying to thwart an attempt to bring about the meltdown of nuclear plants in the USA. As is the case with this series though, there is much more than meets than eye...

Kiefer Sutherland, Dennis Haysbert, Carlos Bernard, Reiko Aylesworth, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least.  Very well written and very well presented, the series is without a doubt guaranteed to provide hours of entertainment.

The major setbacks are in relation to:

1) Just like in the previous seasons, there is no closure from Season Three to Season Four; e.g. detailed info on Michelle/Tony ( or even Kim/Chase...), the President/nation rewarding Bauer for preventing the spread of the virus, what happened to the Palmer family and how they got on.

Instead Season Four starts abruptly and with a lot of gaps and unpleasant surprises in the shape of some not very likable CTU agents, like the new director.

2) Another traitor at CTU???  Enough already!

3) Speaks some truths about the USA being despised due to bad foreign policy.  Ideas of returning to their borders and minding their own business is not necessarily a bad thing, and ""demonizing"" one that thinks as such is not a good thing.

On the positive side:

1) Very original to have the whole series be ""24 hours.""

2) Arnold Vosloh (!) (Imhotep from Mummy and Mummy II) who is great in his role as Habib Marwan.

3) 24 sheds light on US Gov. operations that lead the rest of the world to resent America.

4) A good look into the dirty world of politics.

In short, 24 is a series definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!  KEEP'EM COMING!!!",1169856000,4,1927,4.721556886227545

Season one was sent to me by mistake from online rental service. I watched it since i had nothing better to do and was amazed!!! I have now rented every season in order to catch up to season 5, while I record them. My only complaint for season 4....Is the amount of spoilers!!! Are they serious ??!!?? Who was in charge of the screen caps for the dvd's??!!! I was so mad when Im litteraly biting my nails off at the end of an episode wondering whats going to happen next??? Then as I start the next episode There is a picture of the peson that was in danger only in the picture they are dead!!!!

I loved the show from then on, but knew I would have to get caught up to know what was going on. I never watched an episode again for a long time (because I always worked when it was on). Recently one of my friends was telling me how great a show 24 is, and a store had the Seasons 1-4 on sale for $16, so I decided, why the hell not. I bought Seasons 1-3, then four and now 5. This is by far the best TV show I have ever watched. You will literaly get hooked on it, as you will want to know what is going to happen next. It's full of plot twists and will not put you to sleep, it is very good. I don't want to give any details for those that have not watched it.  I don't want to tell you what this one is about, as it will spoil it for you if you haven't watched it.  Lets just say that when you think you know what is on the terrorists agenda, you will have to guess again.  Non-stop from beginning to end.  If you liked Season 3, this one will far exceed your expectations.  So go on, how dare you deprive yourself of this! Now I'm off to Season 5.  Will keep you posted.",1166832000,2,1246,3.84765625
2230046,4,B0007P14OE,"This show is the most fun I could possibly have rooting for Big Brother. For being the most openly neo-conservative show on TV they do have a way of avoiding controversy that they could be creating. Let's look at the world of ""24."" Surveillance has run amok. Stealing computer software leads you to having ties with Islamic terrorists. Having one night stands leads you to have ties with Islamic terrorists. It is not only OK, but rather expected, that you treat liberals as the enemy. And torture, which shows up in nearly every episode, is the only way to save all of God's children from these Islamic terrorists. Alberto Gonzalez himself could not have cooked up a more rosy picture of torture, but more on that later. Still the show wins fans and awards alike, and completely deserve them both. It is possibly the most entertaining thing on TV, and in the year 2006 that is saying something.

What is amazing to me about the show is the way that they are able to continuously create situations for these characters that are both plausible and suspenseful all the while keeping up the break neck pacing that they are so famous for. The very basic premise of this season is so simplistic and over the top. Terrorists (brown of course) are going to steal a nuclear weapon and shoot it at one of the US's main cities. The only hope we useless civilians have is the bravery of Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland). There are, as always, a gazillion side plots here and before all is said and done we will have three presidents, the Chinese, Tony Almeida, gay sex, a white suburban girl, a hunt for a ""football,"" the destruction of Air Force One, and that woman from ""House of Sand and Fog"" all involved. One of my favorite twists of this season was the introduction of sworn in President Charles Logan played brilliantly by Gregory Itzin. Logan is a man in way over his head but believes that a little tough talk and a few phony smiles will solve anything. Itzin's performance is at once hilarious and depressing, and I hear he only gets better in season 5. I was also intrigued by the angle early on that involved the son of the terrorists who had the bad fortune of having a white girlfriend. Now the parents were obviously delusional if they thought their son wouldn't get a taste for white meat living in the sanitized suburbs of America. That aside, the scene where his mom is left to poison his girlfriend to get her out of the way is played perfectly on a small, domestic level.

But then we have the torture. More than anything it is just stunning how often it shows up. If somebody isn't being tortured, then they are being threatened with torture. If I didn't know any better I would say that the makers of this show have some sort of fetish that involves the intense suffering of others. We also get scene where ""tough guys"" stomp their feet and cry because liberals are obstructing their ability to torture. I also found it in bad taste that the 1 (!) liberal character on the entire show was shown to be weak, whiny, skuzzy all while having ties to terrorism and, of course, being gay. That is because, as all red blooded conservatives know, all liberals are gay. But hey it is their show they can do what they want.

From the first episode on, we were hooked. We then purchased the Season Four DVD from Amazon.  The CLARITY is much much better on the DVD than on a tape.

William DeVane plays the secretary of defense, but he mysteriously disappears and returns for unexplained reasons.

This is how TV should be made. Sharp dialogue. Sharp Characters. Sharp action. But that's not the best of it! What's the most riveting and yet satisfying aspect of 24? The fact that something happens week in week out and, at the end of the series, instead of EVERYTHING building to a cliff-hanger with which to tease you till the start of the next season, 24 delivers the goods and resolves the entire season's storyline.

These are interesting, but there are so many of them; that the show really looses its once film feel. This season is really episodic in its storylines. Even more characters are added and perform really needless actions. They are really there to just take up time. The sad part to this season are the conflicts Jack and his colleges go through.

Some might say it is a hollow victory.  Make no mistake people: Season 4, though perfectly paced plot-wise, contains oodles of misogyny - just like the previous 3 seasons.

2230112,5,B0007P14OE,"""24"" just keeps getting better and better, and I'd say seasons 4 and 5 are easily the best yet.  Season 4, for the first time, illustrates that the writers developed a single, multifaceted story arc to last through the entire season, rather than just making stuff up as they went along, as was sometimes the case in the first three seasons (particularly season 1, since they only had a 12-episode order to begin with and had to provide a resolution in case the show wasn't picked up for a full season).  Better still, it's an intriguing and realistic arc, with <<<<<<< SPOILER ALERT >>>>>>> one of the best plot twists I've ever seen on television, namely when it becomes clear that the hijacked Stealth fighter will be used to shoot down Air Force One.

That said, the season isn't perfect.  There are two notable disconnects in the season, at points where it seems like the producers checked out the comments on the online ""24"" fan boards about the first few episodes and decided to make some changes.  Nearly all of the characters introduced this season, except for Audrey Raines, are abruptly eliminated by episode 12, almost as if the viewers hated the fact that Jack was the only major character to return from the previous seasons and the producers had to scramble to bring everyone back to the table.  (Thankfully, this list didn't include Kim.)  Thus, hello Tony, Michelle and Chloe; adios Erin, Sarah and Secretary Heller.  The introduction of President Logan and reintroduction of President Palmer and Mike Novick also follow this trajectory, although I'm guessing that was also partially done to set up the story arc in season 5 (which I won't spoil here).  I do not get, however, why Mike Novick - who worked for Democratic senator/president Palmer for 20 years - would suddenly be recruited to work for the new Republican VP; that's just not how it works in real life.

Plot holes/flaws: as several reviews have noted, Behrooz just completely disappears without any sort of explanation, but one thing not mentioned is that Edgar never receives any sort of reprisal for his failure to go over the LAPD hourlys and realize that the Air Force pilot scheduled to fly the Stealth was missing, which directly led to Air Force One being shot down.  This tragedy *could* have been prevented, and I can't believe Edgar wasn't ever called on his failure to prevent what ultimately becomes either the death or permanent incapacitation of President Keeler (unfortunately that's another plot hole, never explained in season 5).  Also, the writers were clearly going to set up a romance between Michelle and Buchanan before deciding barely two episodes later that it would interfere between Tony and Michelle getting back together, so they hastily had Bill claim ""we just went out a few times but it didn't go anywhere,"" never mind that the clear implication from the earlier episodes was otherwise.

A bigger qualm I have is that this particular season (unlike the other four) seems to go out of its way to lampoon ""politically correct"" types and defend the idea of torture as an intelligence extraction tool.  Now granted, in the context of the show I think torture is totally justified, but considering that these episodes were airing right around the time the Abu Ghraib prison torture scandal was erupting (which is definitely NOT a justifiable use of torture), I think the writers could've been a bit more sensitive to current real-life events.  The introduction of an Amnesty International lawyer, and the gleeful method in which Jack evades procedure to get at his defendant and then extracts info out of him by breaking all his fingers, is particularly egregious.

Nonetheless, this is the BEST drama on network TV (and on par with the best on TV, period, e.g. ""The Sopranos"") by a long shot, and I still rate this season five stars!",1151798400,5,3842,4.860643185298621

Chloe starts to really shine with this season as the employee that we all have to work with who is sarcastic, snippy, and always has an attitude, but at the same time is very efficient.  Besides Marvan, the season also gets great acting from Shohreh Aghdashloo, who plays Dina Araz.  She does a great job as she is trapped between the love for her son and the love for her husband.  Her son, Behrooz, though, sometimes is pretty annoying.  Quick SPOILER: ***What happened to Behrooz?  Is he dead?  They kind of just made the trade and we never saw him again.

1. some past tricks are recycled. They are therefore expected. too bad.

2. what Jack endures is unbelievably tough and sometimes you have a hard time accepting that he can recover so quickly. In the same manner, some technological tricks obviously do not exist.

3. I can't believe that the US government is so inefficient. At least its means are unlimited (in this context.) So why do they send a few guys to do critical but simple tasks while they have hundreds of highly trained soldiers/policeman/spies/whatever at the ready that can be sent on site with one order from the president? On the other hand, when you see how this administration managed to screw up its intervention in Iraq and Afghanistan, you wonder...

Last, I wish this show had been the occasion to say once more that torture is not only wrong, but also ineffective.

All this being said, brace yourself for a few short nights and enjoy!",1150070400,,1125,4.517241379310345
2230118,3,B0007P14OE,"The first 10 or 12 episodes of Season 4 are among the best of the entire series.  Shohreh Aghdashloo is incredible and probably the best villain of the entire series. Someone in Hollywood should cast her as a Bond villain. It was also nice to see that they got rid of some of the characters that had become tiresome in the first three seasons.

But somewhere in the middle of the season, all the old characters start to come back and the plot turns very cheesy -- a real disppointment after the terrific start.  Interestingly, the show really starts to lag when the Dina Arazi characters disappears.  One also gets a sense that the show has already used up all of the tricks that the writers can think of and just starts to repeat itself.

Things do pick up again in the last few episodes.  Not great quality stuff but pretty exciting.

Overall, however, I'd have to say that this is the weakest season so far.",1149465600,2,910,4.445783132530121
2230119,5,B0007P14OE,"There are so many intricate plot lines, and so many twists that completely change the storyline that if it might be considered hard to follow--but I don't think this is true.  The pacing of the show is done perfectly, to give viewers a perfect understanding about what is going on at certain times.  A great wonder that 24 pulls off is that despite the fact that many people who watch the show, including I, do not know much about the technology used in the episodes, it is still not at all difficult to understand what's happening.

Jack Bauer is a great hero, with flaws that make him all the more valiant.  When one finishes this season, they will have an unprecedented fondness and respect for Bauer.  The friendships he finds in Tony Almeida, the hilariously awkward Chloe O'Brian, and David Palmer are true and touching, and his angsty tribulations in which he goes through with Audrey Raines is heart wrenching.  Some of the other notable characters are Edgar, who one can truly sympathize with and feel for, as he is a through-and-through nice guy who is hard not to love.  Behrooz Araz, the son of a terrorist, is a believable character who connects with the rebel and human in all of us.

Now onto the villains.  Dina Araz is all over the place, and is not a very consistent character, nor are many of the less important terrorists.  Two villains stand out to me:  The fear-evoking Habid Marwan and the incredibly sexy ""Mandy.""  Habid is ruthless, and has a look of power and influence in his very gaze, and he is a formidable antagonist.  Mandy is gorgeous, kills with no remorse, and is as smart as Jack Bauer with her actions, but what is really terrifying about her is her clear blue eyes, which are so icy that you almost believe she could freeze you with them.

Now onto the few negatives of the series; it seems after a plot-line is milked, they throw it to the side and move to the next.  Why did the Behrooz plot-line just stop, and why do we never see what happens to him?  Why don't we see when Mandy arrives at CTU to get the paper the President signed in the last episode?  Why don't we see what happens after Secretary of Defense James Heller discovers his son's secret?  The rest of the plot-lines are summed up great, and the end is a bit tear-jerking, but what happened to those plot-lines?  I want to SEE what happened to those characters, not assume!

Otherwise, this season is amazing and well worth a buy.

2230121,3,B0007P14OE,"Our family is new to ""24"" having never watched it on TV.  On recommendation by a friend, we have watched on DVD most of season 4.  The only way to watch a TV series that is one long running story is to get the DVDs (buy or rent.)  There are no commercials and you can watch 4 episodes in about 3 hours.  In 3 evenings, you can watch 3 months worth of episodes.  Having only watched ""24"" like this, I can't imagine trying to follow the story week-to-week like TV viewers do.

The show itself is edge-of-your-seat suspenseful and action-packed.  Season 4 is particularly exciting and pretty relevant to post-9-11 America.  The plots and subplots are very layered; both the main story line and each character's personal life are shown in detail.

For a show of this type, it is fairly well written.  The most glaring shortcoming of ""24"" is its main premise, i.e. that each episode is 1 hour in a day, each season is a 24 hour period.  While unique, the device isn't terribly believeable because there is no way all that action could be packed into any one person's week let alone 1 day.  Too much happens in a few hours to believe that any one person or group of people could have participated in the events.  This shortcoming is particularly obvious when watching the episodes back-to-back, without commercial breaks.  Because TV viewers see 1 hour blocks 1 time per week, the action appears a bit more spread out, if you will.

Having not seen other seasons, I have no basis for comparison, but season 4 seems like a fine place to start following the show.",1147132800,8,1555,4.523297491039426
2230122,5,B0007P14OE,"24 is not just a show.  It's a phenomenon.  Over millions watched the premiere of season 5.  If that doesn't tell you right there that this show is awsome, then nothing can.  It's a heartpounding action-packed show about CTU (Counter Terrorism Unit) Jack Bauer as he attempts to save the world (and the president) from terrorists and such.  Kiefer Sutherland (Jack Bauer) pulls his character off so well making you believe the whole thing.  Rent it. Buy it. Borrow it.  Steal it (actually, I suggest not doing that last one).  Just see it. You won't be dissapointed.

This season unfolds more slowly than the previous ones.  Even half way into this season it is not clear what the full story will be.  While there is a plot line (Erin Driscoll's daughter) that doesn't tie into the rest, it is downplayed and therefore just a minor distraction. This season is quite probably the best to this point.",1145145600,2,490,4.351648351648351

Season 4 is great, with the drama surrounding the kidnapping of Secretary Heller and the terroist attacks, and watching a family of terrorists at work was an interesting concept, and the developing relationship between Jack and Audrey. After the loss of his wife,it was great to see Jack trusting in someone again. This season, much like the other 3 and certainly like season 5 (so far) takes you on a wild ride, and definitely does not disappoint.",1143763200,4,672,4.703389830508475

2230133,4,B0007P14OE,"When last we saw him, Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) had become a junkie in order to bring down a Mexican drug lord and stop a deadly virus from being unleashed upon Los Angeles. As always, Bauer managed to save the day. But instead of getting a medal, Bauer got the axe and was dismissed from his position as head of field operations at CTU Los Angeles.

Over a year later, Bauer has found a new life for himself working for Secretary of Defense, James Heller (William Devane). More importantly, Jack has discovered that away from CTU, he has the freedom to pursue a serious relationship. He soon finds himself in love- with Heller's not-quite divorced daughter Audrey (Kim Raver). Just as he's getting comfortable in Washington, Jack finds himself back at CTU meeting with Erin Driscoll (Alberta Watson), the woman who fired him. It soon becomes apparent that Jack's boss and the woman he loves are going to be the targets of a terrorist strike. And as long as they are in danger, Jack Bauer insists on working with CTU to save them- whether his help is wanted or not! As Jack races to rescue Audrey and Secretary Heller, it becomes clearer and clearer that their abduction is only part of what the terrorists have planned for the day- the worst is yet to come!

It's safe to say that Season Four is probably the worst of the series thus far. There's no shortage of new faces on the series, most of whom don't last for very long which makes for a disjointed season. That being said, the worst 24 has to offer is still edge-of-your-seat entertainment that blows away just about all of the competition (except for maybe The Shield). And the ending of Season 4 (which I won't get in to) is good enough that it almost makes up for any flaws the season might have.

Like the Season 3 DVD, Season 4 is packed with a disc worth of special features, chief among them the deleted scenes, an inside look at the designing of a new CTU set, and a prequel to Season 5 .

24, the Complete Fourth Season also stars Carlos Bernard, Reiko Aylesworth, Roger Cross, Lana Parilla, and Dennis Haysbert.",1142208000,2,2083,4.531914893617022

The action is non-stop and each episode ends with a cliff-hanger.  One evening, I viewed 4 episodes back-to-back and could have watched more if not for an early appointment the next day.

The season four DVD set, like its predecessors, contains all 24 season eposides of this riveting show. Many episodes come with special commentary from the directors and producers of the show, which while nice, it would be preferable to hear from the cast of the show.

The show itself, is as always, fantastic. Season four is quite possibly the greatest season yet, with the exception of the first.

Also I know that Keith Sutherland plays by his own rules and gets results but don't you think he should follow the rules a bit more often. Protocol is protocol and you need to follow it otherwise you go to jail. Also I don't think last night's episode was convincing where Jack discoverd a bomb in the hard drive of his computer.

2230147,5,B0007P14OE,"I have to admit, I initially was not a fan of this show.  While I thought the first season was entertaining it required SEVERE suspension of disbelief, especially with regards to the real-time premise of the show's format.  I mean, come on... just how can Jack really get across L.A. traffic in like 5 minutes anyway?  Just ONCE I would like to see an entire episode devoted to Jack stuck in rush hour traffic having to rely solely on cellular communications with CTU but then again, that does not make for suspenseful television now does it? ;)  Or how about devoting one episode with Jack on his lunch hour?  Nope.  This guy never eats nor sleeps nor requires a restroom break of any kind because he is JACK F---ING BAUER!

I made a pact with my friend.  I agreed to watch Season 4 if he would agree to watch Lost.  It only took me a week to burn through Season 4 and I have had so much fun that any doubts I had about 24 as an enjoyable series have been completely erased.  Jack Bauer is the real deal.  He makes Jason Bourne look like an amateur.  Kiefer Sutherland is so intense and so focused every minute he is on screen that you believe that the peril he is facing, no matter how ridiculously contrived, is real.

What makes season 4 the best day yet is due mostly to its perfect chemistry of suspenseful plot twists, frenetic pacing and editing, interactive character development and explosive action.  The writers seemed more concerned this season with creating jaw-dropping ""I can't believe they just did that!"" action than focusing on the soap opera-ish melodrama that watered down previous seasons.  While Elisha Cuthbert's Kim Bauer is pleasing to the eye to look at, thankfully she is out of the picture here so Jack can stay focused on his most intense day ever without the juvenile distractions.  Still, there are a few breaks in the action where our characters get caught up in their personal feelings and rivalries getting in the way of their professional judgments that make for a few brief groaners but are quickly subdued by the more immediate threats at hand.

Arnold Vosloo from The Mummy is this season's main baddy and he is the perfect intellectual foil for Jack Bauer.  He is always one step ahead of Jack who struggles desperately to keep up with Habib Marwan's diabolical acts of terrorism.  The most surprising thing is that Marwan, more often than not, succeeds and leaves the viewer with their jaw hanging wide open in disbelief.

This season features the return of familiar characters from earlier seasons including Tony Almeida, Michelle Dessler, Mike Novick, and CTU nerds Chloe O'Brien and newbie Edgar Stiles.  We are also introduced to several new faces at CTU including Curtis Manning, Erin Driscoll and Bill Buchanan.  Kim Raver is Jack's love interest Audrey Raines and her father, Secretary of Defense James Heller, is played by Rolling Thunder himself... William Devane.  After spending a real-time day in crisis with these characters you'll feel like they are all members of the immediate family.

Sean Callery's rousing and adrenaline pumping electronic score is the perfect compliment to the onscreen action and elevates the level of suspense faster than mercury rising in a thermometer.  Not since Mark Snow's electronic cues for X-Files has there been a more perfect accompaniment of incidental music to parallel the onscreen action.

24 Season 4 is more entertaining and suspenseful than most blockbuster action films and has cast the die for other series and films to follow in its aftermath.  Bruce Willis' John McClane may have inaugurated the age of the everyman action hero, but Kiefer Sutherland's Jack Bauer has taken heroism beyond the call of duty and has redefined, by very definition, the ideal Action Star.  At a time of political unrest and uncertainty in this country and the threat of terrorism abroad, one cannot help but feel a sense of restored patriotism by Jack's heroic deeds.  Indeed, Jack Bauer has become a Real American Hero.",1140912000,11,4000,4.832599118942731

If you enjoyed the first three seasons, number 4 will not disappoint you. If you did not, don't waste your time. And if you have not yet watched any season, and even though #4 is great, my advise would be to start from the beginning, with #1. But if you don't have patience and want to move on to this one, go for it. Not having watched the previous ones will have minor impact on your enjoyment.

24 is one of the most addictive action series ever. Its ""live drama"", simultaneous shots of actions happening in different places at the same time, its writers' willingness to create unexpected turns of events (those daring situations which usually you don't expect to happen), are some of the reasons why its so outstanding. You will be glued to your seat while you watch this fantastic show.

2230163,5,B0007P14OE,"24 began its life on television accompanied by the faint whiff of gimmicky desperation, not unlike fellow Fox show Prison Break, which is becoming increasingly unsatisfying. A strange thing happened, though. Instead of being constrained by the format - which, for those uninitiated, follows the action in more or less real time, with each episode detailing one hour in a single, hectic and action-oriented day - the difference from other dramatic serial conventions helped eventually spawn fresh new approaches to storytelling and sustained a show that has grown surprisingly substantive in its emotional depth.

As disgraced (now former) Counter Terrorist Unit agent Jack Bauer - who really should get together with Die Hard's John McClane at some point for a top-this, roundtable discussion of occupational highs and lows - Kiefer Sutherland has found what is undeniably the best role of his career. Equally impressive, though, is the manner in which he has both grown and settled into it as the series progresses, evincing new layers of complexity, coarseness and sublimated feeling.

The fourth season of 24 begins with creator Joel Surnow and Michael Loceff's superlative episode, in which the explosion of a train in the California desert serves as the cover for a snatch-and-grab. Blunt Secretary of Defense James Heller (William Devane, subbing nicely for Donald Rumsfeld) and his married daughter Audrey (Kim Raver), who's having a clandestine affair with Jack, are both kidnapped, and it's not long before a dangerous virus code on the Internet is linked to the attacks and America's nuclear reactors are teetering on the brink of meltdown. As these larger implications and ramifications of the kidnapping are exposed, a new and more ominous plot is revealed, with a family of Turkish immigrants, fronted by Navi and Dina Araz (Nestor Serrano and Shohreh Aghdashloo), at the center of an extremist Muslim terror cell. With both Jack and the CTU racing to figure out the terrorists' true objective, it becomes clear that the events of this day have been years in the making - and only a miracle will prevent the scheduled attacks that the terrorists believe will bring the United States to its knees.

Apart from its sterling production values, one of the most impressive things about re-watching 24 is the manner in which it sows the seeds for future dramatic tension - in this case with Charles Logan (Gregory Itzin), an ineffectual veep unprepared to inherit the mantle of the presidency. Some of the plot twists are a bit overly florid - the result of having to pack each hour with its own peaks and valleys - and the occasional re-introduction of supporting characters from past seasons reeks of attempted ratings manipulation, but the show overall delivers on a consistently high basis.

Distributor 20th Century Fox continues to do right by television fans, releasing superlative sets of both its new and catalogue properties. This seven-disc set's gatefold packaging is a bit ridiculous, the tapeworm of DVD presentation. But an exclusive prequel nicely bridges the fourth and fifth seasons of the show (the latter being on the air now), and the usual clutch of production featurettes, actor and filmmaker commentaries, deleted and extended scenes and more all nicely round out this release.",1139788800,2,3308,5.166044776119403
2230164,5,B0007P14OE,"Let me make this clear: I don't watch much television anymore. It feels as though the stations are scraping the barrel for what to put on TV. However, 24 is one of the most entertaining series I've ever seen. It's incredibly well written and made.

Yet I don't watch it on television. I only buy the DVDs! I've found that this is the best way to experience the show. You don't have any commercials, you can watch it whenever you want, and you don't have to wait a full week to find out what happens next. It's sometimes difficult to avoid all commercials about new episodes, but it's well worth it.

And I highly recommend you buy this season on DVD. I just finished watching the last episode this week and I'm just amazed that the show's writers and directors are still making such a terrific series. Buy this!!",1139443200,2,812,4.442953020134228

2230166,5,B0007P14OE,"I'm always scared when a great show comes along like 24 that it will jump the shark or capsize into moronic and desperate measures. But the writing on the show continues to be hard-edged and consistent. I generally can't tolerate ""action heroes"" but Jack Bauer, played by Keifer Sutherland, is a convincing character study of a man who is always at odds with the bureacrats who run Intelligence. Outlandish situations compel Bauer to break the rules and he's always right. His rebel behavior points to a subtext in this very intelligent suspense series: The clash between self-interested soggy-brained bureacrats and the real or authentic independent thinkers who must defy those bureacrats in order to be effective. By focusing on this universal theme and applying it to the show's focus on our war against terrorists, 24 has created a hero we can all empathize with.",1138838400,2,868,5.034722222222222
2230167,4,B0007P14OE,"I watched season 1 - 3 in rapid succession, on DVD, as I never watched the show when it was broadcast on our TV. I absolutely loved the first 3 seasons, and decided to watch season 4 the same way, on disc, and not with a week's break on TV. Maybe season 4 would work better with that 7 day break, as I did notice some cracks in the plot this time. Characters seemed to disappear unnaturally (Andrew Paige, Forbes, James Heller) or without satifactory explanation (injured president Keeler). Some became annoyingly unnatural in their conduct (vice-president Logan's behaviour, Audrey Heller's sudden corcern about the torture of a terrorist) etc. It also looked like no one at CTU was tired after 24hours on the job. These things won't bother so much if you watch each episode with a break in between, but for a DVD-junkie like me this season presented some problems due to continuous viewing. But let's be honest here - this show, after 4 seasons, is still one heck of a thrillride! And when season 5 comes out on DVD, I will surely be one of the first to buy it!!",1138838400,,1064,4.518134715025907
2230168,4,B0007P14OE,"24 - Season 4 is a definite departure from the first three seasons. For one, the cast is almost entirely new. Second, the pacing of each episode does not seem as frantic. There appears to be a shift from the reliance on plot-shifting cliff hangers (which in some ways dragged down the quality of Season 3), to a focus on complex, over-arcing, multiple storylines, albeit very violent. What may be missing in superficial action clichs is definitely compensated in a richer plot. That's not to say the show has slowed down, it's still amped up beyond anything else on TV, but compared to the previous seasons, 24 has gotten a lot smarter, and in turn, better.",1138752000,,657,4.672413793103448

2230170,5,B0007P14OE,"After 3 seasons on the hit FOX series 24, C.T.U. agent Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland), is a man on edge. The toll of his job keeping the nation safe from terrorism has worn on him deeply, as have the numerous losses and addictions he has endured as part of his job.

  At the Start of the shows 4th season, Jack seems to have put much of this behind him, as he has left C.T.U. in order to work for the Secretary of Defense. The fact that Jack has secretly been seeing the soon to be divorced daughter of the Secretary has seemingly put his life on track leaving his troubled past behind him.

  This all changes when the Secretary and his daughter are kidnapped by terrorists who threaten to kill them both if their demands are not met. Before long Jack is drawn back into C.T.U. in an effort to save them, and soon realizes that the kidnapping is just the tip of the iceberg in what is going to be another very deadly and long day for Jack.

  The 4th season of the show grabs you from the opening moments and never lets go. After 3 seasons, the real time concept has only grown stronger and the show has become even more addictive and topical with each passing year. The strong supporting cast and the gripping and intense work by Sutherland combined with the action and tension packed storylines not only makes the show addictive, but one of the best shows in television history.

The DVD Set is loaded with features such as deleted scenes, commentaries and a look at the upcoming 5th season including a prequel segment that connects the two seasons.

2230176,4,B0007P14OE,"God, I love 24.  I always thought the premise behind it was pretty cool, but it hasn't become a critical and fan favorite just because of its hooky idea: since its inception in 2001 it's survived its critics and become one of the most consistently entertaining shows on TV.  Honestly, the criticisms of this show as preposterous are getting a bit old at this point.  I mean, come on, from the very first ad for season one it should've been obvious the premise for 24 was farfetched--a spy drama that unfolds in real time over 24 episodes?  Obviously, at that point some people were just going to go with it or not go with it, and just as obviously Fox is going to continue milking the concept as long as ratings are good; they'd be stupid not to.  Shakespeare's plays were full of contrivances; that doesn't mean they made for bad drama.  More to the point, this is TV for Pete's sake, and while some people are obviously content to watch mundane reality shows about wife-swapping, makeovers, and people inexplicably trying to get a job working for Donald Trump, I'll take escapist entertainment, thank you very much.  And if that means accepting the occasional plot stretch, so be it.

Anyway, now that I've gotten off my soapbox, I'll just say this: of the three seasons of 24 I've watched (one and two being the others), I'd have to say season four is the best.  The melodrama and hokey plot devices of the first two seasons are largely absent here (and there are no mountain lions or amnesia to be found this time around, thank God), resulting in a darker and more tightly structured watch that actually raises the sense of danger and the emotional stakes even higher.  Still, the basic formula remains unchanged: duplicity, political intrigue, emotional fireworks, troubled relationships, and action, action, action.  Even with some comic relief injected (mostly by the ever-entertaining CTU analyst Chloe O'Brian), the prospect of death hangs heavily over this season as the unthinkable extent of the day's terrorist plots is progressively revealed.

Once again in the middle of it all is Jack Bauer, who by now has to have gotten on the short list of television's all-time great tough guys.  Even though 24 has always been a plot-driven show, Kiefer Sutherland has managed to turn Jack into one of TV's most memorable and defining characters of the 21st century.  Seriously, is it possible by now to picture anyone else in the role of Jack Bauer?  I for one can barely even picture Sutherland in another role, and I've *seen* him in other roles.  Even when the plot starts getting silly (which isn't much of a problem here, although it does pop up occasionally) Jack always remains the show's calm, collected center, a model of gravitas with a steely glare and a deadly accurate shot.  This season is sort of the ultimate culmination of his tormented hero persona, as we once again see his commitment to his job and country outweigh all other considerations, and he pays some heavy personal prices for it.

Even better, Jack actually gets a suitable counterpoint on the other side this time.  As in season two, the villains here are (mostly) Islamic radicals, but they're much better developed this time around, and they're also an improvement over the Dennis-Hopper led Serbs from season one.  Much of the acclaim this season generated was directed at Shohreh Agdashloo for her ultra-chilling portrayal of Dina Araz, and rightly so: she nails the dual role of protective mother and cold-blooded terrorist, with different facets of her character emerging as the season goes on (ironically, I read that she's pretty much banned from ever going home to Iran because of her criticism of that country's regime).  I actually thought some of the love she was given should have been directed elsewhere, though, as the terrorists' head honcho was nothing short of a classic bad guy in an even more pivotal role.  Arnold Vosloo is creepily believable as Habib Marwan, the quintessential true beliver who's unencumbered by any considerations of compassion or self-interest.  It's Marwan's twisted sense of idealism that makes him the most dangerous kind of guy there is: he's willing to do anything and kill anybody precisely because he truly believes that what he's doing is right.  He's coldly cerebral about what he does, but at the same time he's obviously completely committed to a higher cause, a contradiction that's conveyed extremely well here.

Good as it is, to my mind this season does present one flaw with 24's groundbreaking format: the show has almost become too good for it.  Sure, the real-time concept was a great way to hook viewers looking for something different, but by this point the show has become so complex, detailed and intriguing that such a crutch isn't even necessary.  I actually had some early conflicts about taking the plunge into watching this season because the idea of another 24-hour adventure seemed too gimmicky to me, and I'd hate to think of anyone else being scared off by the concept.  I've started wondering whether this show might work better if it were freed from the constraints of its 24-hour running time, but as that will almost certainly never happen we probably won't know.  And besides, as this season and the excellent beginning to season five demonstrate, Kiefer and Co. can still get it done, so who am I to complain?",1138147200,3,5373,4.860745614035087
2230177,4,B0007P14OE,"24 Season 4 has everything from kidnapping to gun fights to terrorist plots: all the things fans have come to love from the show. The most obvious flaw is the implausable plotline, in which all seasons had, but in comparison only Season 3 was more convaluted than Season 4. I still look at the first two season as being the best ones. Season 4 has some great suspense sequences, but the emotional moments of personal problems still seem silly given that the whole world needs saving. It's terrific escapist entertainment, well acted, and very exciting. Yeah it's rediculous in many ways, but as rediculous shows go it still doesn't get much better.",1138060800,,648,4.794642857142857
2230178,4,B0007P14OE,"No doubt-they have been able to squeeze the lemon once again, the outcome: sustain thriller with a sprinkle of romance.

I have found myself anxiously pressing the play button for the next episodes BUT there are limits for the eye&mind of the ""reasonable viewer"" that had been crossed repeatedly.

Don't get me wrong in here. 24 hours of the 4th season (technically it's less, each episode is less than 1 hour in real-time) would get you at least 20 hours of action, explosions, walking on the edge etc, but the remaining 4 hours got me to come to the conclusion that the writing team of 24 should get into the conference room and get a grip of themselves...

If you didn't watch it yet, don't read the following:

Another spy inside the CTU??? (boy, is it the CTU or central park?) A tiny hospital in the basement of the CTU in which Audrey's husband is being operated/the daughter of the CTU director suffering from schizophrenia is hospitalized? Michelle asking Almeida to watch out while stepping into the field and you know for 100% something bad would happen to him? There's a lot (really a lot more) but I have given them 4 stars after all...

2230179,5,B0007P14OE,"'24' Season Four is better than Day 3 (season three) and manages to be even more complex and compelling than the last two seasons. The technical work is better than ever, and the main storyline rivals season one's. Season Four brings a refreshing change to the show's formula with its many new cast members, and here are the highlights of this excellent season:

1) When we first see Jack Bauer, he's working for the Secretary of Defense James Heller (William Devane), all the while carrying on an affair with his daughter Audrey Raines (Kim Raver). Then a villian named Habib Marwan sets in motion a plan to bring down the US Government. Jack and Audrey's love for each other is affected by the day's events, and the emotional turmoils that develop are involving. Jack must risk his own life and the lives of others around him to save the US government and its people, which in turn complicates their relationship.

2) The twists are more predictable now that the formula has been played out several times prior to this season, but there are still some shocking events in the various storylines, and they are most prominent in the storyline involving the Araz family.

3) The acting by Keifer Sutherland is superb as he makes Jack Bauer a more poignant, grounded hero. Chloe O'Brian (Mary Lynn Rajskub), the sarcastic worker of CTU from season three, also shows some maturity and brings some well-needed humor to the ever-growing tension that develops in the season. Many new characters are introduced, but no one is more captivating than Dina Araz (Shoreh Aghdashloo). Her character traits contradict each other and are put to the test over the season, making her this season's most interesting character. Aghdashloo plays Dina as a mother who has no options in the situation she is caught up in, and the show is revitalized due to her brilliant performance. It's a travesty that she wasn't nominated for an Emmy or Golden Globe for her great supporting role.

4) The production values are consistent and the camerawork nearly flawless.

'24' Season Four improves on nearly everything from the previous seasons and does deserve its acclaim from critics and fans as the show's best season, but I personally prefer season one because its conclusion was more epic, deep, and true. Still, '24' Season Four makes for riveting television as it reinvents the thrilling formula that has made first-time viewers and long-time fans sit up and take notice.",1137628800,30,2447,4.900966183574879

2230182,4,B0007P14OE,"I've enjoyed every season of 24, yet with season 4 I found myself complaining during the show.  This season involves 1 terrorist plot, leading into another, which leads into another, which leads yet into another plot.  Each evolution is fine until you realize that each plot depends on the one before it being pulled off successfully by the terrorists.  At some point the complexity becomes overwhelming.

Furthermore, some of the plots obviously required long term planning down the exact date something happens, while other parts of the plot require the terrorist to have last minute knowledge of certain events.  In other words, you don't find out when something will happen until the day before, but parts of your plan depend on knowing that information weeks or months earlier.

I realize the writers have a tough job, and continuing to come up with inventive plot twists is hard work, but I have a memory, and after or during the show I may think about how we got from there to here, and it just doesn't jive.

The show is great fun to watch, and each episode leaves me wanting to see the next one, but it does take away from the fun when I'm yelling ""That couldn't of happened"" or That's Preposterous!"" at the TV.",1137024000,4,1220,4.672897196261682

The DVDs are popular because it's torture to have to wait till the next week to find out what happens. 24 is a brilliant piece of escapism, out-Bonding any recent James Bond effort or Jason Bourne. I know fans that range from kids in the U.S. to grandmothers in Scottish Highland villages. The themes of danger and love are always universal, and 24 hits the note pitch-perfect.

Anyway, besides the fact that a lot of themes of earlier seasons come back in this one, and in fact some episodes could be seamlessly taken from earlier seasons and put in here and vice versa, I thought this season was very good. Try not to think too hard, but the action in this one was good and Jack Bauer shot a lot of people, which is always fun.

2230190,3,B0007P14OE,"I may be the only one who notices this or who cares, but I find the paranoia and torture-justification of this season disturbing.

The paranoia comes in its portrayal of Arab Americans. Yes, I am sure there are a few terrorist cells here in North America somewhere. But this program ignores the fact that most of those are likely single men and certainly extreme religious conservatives.

The show goes out of its way to portray the normal, moderate-appearing, hardworking, upper middle class Muslim family next door as worst and most ruthless kind of terrorists. They don't just dislike their son dating an American Christian girl, they poison her tea and shoot her. (And frankly, any family this ruthless and extreme would sacrifice their own son to the cause without a qualm.)

There are no positive portrayals whatsoever of Arabs or Muslims, unless you count the doctor in the background of an episode or two.

Fostering this kind of paranoia -- don't trust your Muslim neighbors, cause they're probably terrorists anyway -- is not a nice game. It reminds me of the Red Menace scares of the '50s.

For the record, I am a Christian Euro-American whose family on both sides has been here over a century. I am also someone who has had the opportunity to know an Arab-American, Muslim family since childhood. This kind of slur on them and millions like them makes my skin crawl. Worse, it makes me worry for them.

The constant justification of torture is my other problem with this season. Someone is always ""having"" to torture someone, because they ""just don't have time"" to do it the legal way. One or two innocent people are shown being tortured, but we are always safely removed from the effects of it, and the fact that innocent people tortured will make things up to get the pain to stop. Real helpful when time is of the essence.

It's always shown as justified, and, incidentally, always shown as getting the correct information, which as we know often does not happen, even when the subject actually knows something. No consideration of how indistinguishable this makes the good guys from the bad guys seems to cross the producers' minds. Or that maybe, just maybe, America should stand for something better than torture.

The final problem I have with the show is simply the lighting. So many, many scenes make me want to say ""turn a light on."" They are so dark you can't see the actor's faces, which is obviously what they want to set mood, but actually distances the viewer.",1135814400,14,2487,4.7540603248259865

2230199,5,B0007P14OE,"24's third season was extremely nerve-wracking and it kept is all on the edge of our seats. Kiefer Sutherland is back and is about to have, yet, another bad day of his life.

  It has been a year and a half since JACK BAUER (again played by Kiefer Sutherland) ridded North America of a deadly virus. Shortly after completing this task, CTU was appointed a new head: ERIN DRISCOLL (played by Alberta Watson). Once she took up office as the head of CTU's Los Angeles office, she immediately relieved Jack Bauer of his duties.

  A year and a half later, CTU is still being run by Erin Driscoll. Most of CTU's employees have quit their jobs. Chase and Kim (though no sign of them at all in this season) have moved elsewhere and decided to build a life together. TONY ALMEIDA (again played by Carlos Bernard) is living alone, after Jack had bailed him out of jail. Tony has become an alcoholic, whereas his wife, Michelle Dessler, who worked for CTU and is now working for DIVISION, left Tony. The only member left from last season is CHLOE O'BRIAN (again played by Mary Lynn Rajskub). Among the new employees, there is EDGAR STYLES (played by Louis Lombardi). Edgar is a little slow with things and is a little nerdy, but Edgar is a good guy and is willing to do his job right.

  Jack is now working in Washington D.C. He is working for JAMES HELLER (played by William Devane), The U.S. Secratary Of Defense. Jack is secretly having an affair with James' beautiful daughter, AUDREY HELLER-RAINS (played by Kim Raver). Audrey is separated from her husband, PAUL RAINS. She will be filing for divorce soon. They are in L.A. at the moment, for Erin Driscoll wants a meeting with Jack.

  Jack arrives at CTU, has a brief conversation with Chloe and then heads for Erin's office. Their meeting is cut short for there is another terrorist threat getting ready to take play. Audrey and James are at Audrey's brother's house, where Audrey and James are kidnapped.

  Hours go by and Jack successfully rescues James and Audry. But they realize that their kidnapping was a part of an even bigger plan that has been spent years in the making. This plan is led by a terrorist named HABIB MARWAN (played by THE MUMMY'S ARNOLD VOSLOO). Working with Marwan is the ARAZ family, consisting of NAVI ARAZ, his wife, DINA, and their son, BARHOOZ. But Dina and Barhooz betray their father, for they want no parts of this.

Later that night, the newly elected President is seriously hurt in an explosion, where VICE PRESIDENT LOGAN is sworn in to office. PRESIDENT LOGAN is having a lot of trouble dealing with today's events, where he calls in a former President...DAVID PALMER (again played by Dennis Haysbert). At the same time, Erin Driscoll leaves CTU to deal with her daughter, who suffers from schizophrenia. Taking her place permanently is...MICHELLE DESSLER (again played by Reiko Aylesworth). Tony has already returned to CTU for today's events, wanting to help Jack. Over the next few hours, Michelle and Tony begin feeling for each other again.

  Paul steps in to help Jack as his partner, but Paul gets shot in the process. Hours later, Jack gets a lead at a Chinese company. He heads in to get the Chinese man who has information on Marwan's location, but the Chinese man is shot in the process, but seems as though he can be saved with the right amount of time and care. As Paul goes back into emergency surgeory, Jack comes in with their only possible lead, whereas Paul instantly dies, devastating Audrey, for she just started feeling things for her husband again.

  Tony goes out on assignment with Jack as extra help, but is kidnapped by a girl named Mandy. Mandy had been a connection to the first season's events, as well as almost killing David Palmer in season two. But Tony gives Jack clues as to where Mandy is taking him. Seems as though CTU is way too smart, for Jack finds Tony and has Mandy arrested. Michelle had been montering and was gonna help get Tony back, but she decided to help save the country, for she did not want to make the same mistake Tony had made, but she is extremely glad in knowing Tony is alive, for they have decided to get back together.

  Jack has already killed Marwan and stopped his plan to send a missil, exploding the entire U.S. Jack has done this successfully with the help of Tony, Michelle, Audrey, James, and David Palmer. But Jack has been called into the Chinese custody since he has been identified as the one who kidnapped their Chinese leader holding the info on Marwan. But the man sent to pick up Jack is sent to kill Jack. A few bullet fights and Jack is found on the floor...dead. Michelle, Chloe, and Tony arrive at Jack's body, give him CPR, where Jack awakes. Michelle, Tony, and Chloe knew about the man sent from the Chinese place wanting to kill Jack, so the three helped Jack make it look like Jack was murdered, where they help Jack escape, where he'll go on to create himself a new identity. Before he goes on his way, David Palmer calls him one last time to speak to Jack, David's only true best friend.

  I was disappointed in seeing most of the show's regulars to be missing from the show. But this season kept me on the edge of my seat. I am practically bald from pulling my hair out for the arrival of the fifth season.

2230200,5,B0007P14OE,"I discovered 24 last year. I rented season 2 on DVD a few days before Christmas . I was home alone, as my boyfriend was away on a trip and rented something to pass the time. After two episodes I was hooked and spent the next week watching seasons 1, 2 and 3. When my boyfriend came home from his trip , he also joined in. He does not care much for TV stuff, but he also was hooked immeditaely. So this year, as soon as season 4 was out, we rented it and watched it. And we were not dissapointed.

This season is just as good as the previous three. In fact it is better than season 3. The adrenalin rush is there all the way through and Jack Bauer is as great as ever. After missing some of the original carachters during the first half of season four, it was great to see them reintroduced a little at a time as the season progressed, in a very plausible manner. I was especially pleased when they brought back the ex president, as I love the guy that plays him.

The storyline was generally very exciting and ended in a very moving way, bringing a lot of feeling into the last few episodes of the show. As usual Keifer Sutherland fits the role of Jack Bauer like a glove. He was born for this role, a very interesting male hero archetype for the new milennium. James Bond eat your heart out!

Good action packed intelligent fun.",1135296000,3,1329,4.18359375
2230201,5,B0007P14OE,"I only caught the last hours of this season on t.v when it aired.  Even though I only watched a little bit, it made me buy the first season.  I never before seen this show, only heard.  After I bought the first season and watched the first hour, I was completely hooked.  I think I finished the first season less than a week. I then bought the second and third and then THIS ONE when it came out.  I think 24 is one of the best shows out there.  The whole concept and how every hour is an episode of a day.. it's great.  This fourth season is really good.  Jack Bauer does not work for CTU anymore.  He, in fact, works for the Secretary of Defense, Heller.  Jack is also falling in love with the Secretary of Defense's daughter, Audrey (Whom is seperated from her husband, Paul.)  After the Secretary and his daughter Audrey are kidnapped by a group of terrorists, Jack must join CTU to help find his boss and the woman he is falling in love with.  This season also starts off with the Araz family (Navi, the father, Dina, the mother, and Barooz, the son.) Navi and Dina are involved with the terrorits attacks that go on this day.  Dina (played by Shohreh Aghdashloo whom was in The House of Sand and Fog and was nominated for an Oscar) does a fantastic job, she's a great actress.  Dina and Barooz go on the run when Navi finds out that Barooz does not want anything to do with what they're doing.  Dina helps Barooz get away.  Navi, and many others, work for a man named Marwan, the man who is behind all the attacks this day.  I won't say anything else he has planned besides the Secretary and his daughter being kidnapped.  There are some returning characters, including Michelle Dessler and Tony Almeida, whom are not married anymore.  Also returning is Chloe O'Brian and former President David Palmer.  Some new characters are Erin Driscoll, the new head of CTU.  Also, Edgar Styles and Audrey Raines.  This show has so many twists and turns and so much action and suspense... it's worth every penny.

Great t.v.

.. And don't miss the final season of 24 which begins January 2006.",1135209600,3,2088,4.41994750656168
2230202,5,B0007P14OE,"""24"" is kind of like the Bond films; sure there's a formula and we know that Jack will break the rules and still come out ahead (although he ends up paying for it big time by the end of the day). Nevertheless, it's an enjoyable ride and well worth the price of admission. Still there are a couple of things I wonder about: 1) How many moles are in CTU 2) Are any of the agents other than Jack like the guys that wore the red shirts in ""Star Trek""?

The fourth rolls forward with Jack being fired from CTU by his new boss. He ends up at the Department of Defense working for the Secretary of Defense (William DeVane) and falling in love with his boss' daughter. Jack gets drawn back into CTU when he comes to Los Angeles with his boss. While in L.A. his boss is kidnapped by terrorists who plan on executing him live on the internet after he's been tried for his ""crimes"". Things are a lot more complex than they seem when a series of conspiracies come to light masterminded by a terrorist named Marwan. Jack goes back into action on a temporary basis with CTU to help secure his boss' release.

Picture quality is top notch as are the extras. The commentaries vary from decent to exceptionally good (although admittedly I haven't had a chance to listen to every one of them). We get both the prequel to the fourth season as well as the fifth. The fourth season prequel is the original version which was cut by the producers because it was a bit too ""sensual"". I don't want to spoil it for you who haven't seen it yet but the prequel for season five is an action packed sequence.

Once again a nice set from Fox. I just wish that the price were a bit lower and that vs. having a five minute ""prequel"" (which is a great idea)we'd get a longer prequel with a bit of story to it perhaps a half hour episode? Once again deleted scenes can be viewed within the context of the story or separately on the last disc. Not that I'm complaining mind you I like what we do get. Once again the series is packaged in an accordian style case that folds out with nice chapter placement. I do wish that there was a chapter placement right after the ""24"" logo so you could skip it. Since there's action during the opening titles if you elect to skip the ""previously on '24'"" recap and opening ""24"" logo you end up skipping important exposition at the beginning of the episode.",1135209600,6,2357,4.292134831460674
2230203,4,B0007P14OE,"shows still holding up....they use the same devices a tad too much, Jack is constantly going out of control and going against orders, then forgiven and put in charge again, there are more moles in CTU than employees, they try to shoehorn the Ex-President into the story (like they did with his ex-wife last year) the list goes on but its still a fun ride, weird how there is no mention of Jacks daughter at all....since a nuke is about to go off you'd think he'd be a little concerned... and uhhh why exactly is Shannon Doherty (yes THAT Shannon) doing a commentary? the only person who really excels at the commentaries is Mary Lynn Raksjub (im 99 percent sure i spelled her name wrong but im too lazy to go back)",1134864000,3,714,4.416666666666667
2230204,5,B0007P14OE,"24 just keeps getting better and better, with over the top plot twists and cliff hangers just about every minute. Season four was a particular stand out because, almost alone on TV or film, 24 dared to actually have Middle Eastern terrorists as the bad guys. Imagine, that in the post 9/11 world.",1134518400,6,296,4.60377358490566
2230205,4,B0007P14OE,"I thought seasons 1-3 were masterpieces of cliffhanger style suspense.

I don't know if it's just me or not but this season seemed very predictable. I was able to call way ahead of time just about every ""surprise"" this season.

The other bothersome thing is the 2nd plot element about the Dobson device. The very concept it beyond ridiculous. For all the resources the producers had they could have hired at one nuclear engineer to tell them how silly the idea was and how it would practically ruin the enjoyment of the series.

How could you take it seriously when they were talking such nonsense about the Dobson Override and its ""capabilities"". It was so idiotic it almost turned the rest of the season into a comedy. I was never so happy to see a plot segment finished as that one.

It would have been more credible if they had the terrorists using a Star Trek transporter to beam nuclear weapons into government buildings. Thats about the level of the Dobson device. It was just silly and stupid and I was very disappointed with this segment of the plot. I was never so happy to see a plot segment finished as that one.

It was even sillier than the Secretary of Defense pulling a Chuck Norris ""Missing in Action"" stunt even though Devane made it a little bit believable - but only a little.

I almost would have preferred to see the S2 cougar back again.

Fortunately the series got back on track after they found the override and we were back into an area where 24 excels - good old fashioned action/suspense. There were a few holes here and there, one of stretches of credibility and a more than a few spots where you wonder why Jack with all his skills and experience would do <spoiler deleted> and <spoiler deleted> but overall it was rolicking fun.

It was also great to see a few familiar faces from previous seasons.

In addition to the thrills and chills there are a few comedic aspects; the new President Logan gives a terrific ""Bush look"" confused and clueless while telling everyone he's in charge and he's the boss. He even looks a little like W, especially with the ""W"" patented ""deer in the headlights"" look every time something happens.

Overall it was a 4 star season, but the last two DVD's were 5+. It was the 2nd half of DVD 2 and all of DVD 3 that dragged the rating down. My ony bitch is the final element with the Chinese could have been so easily dealt with, it was obvious yet they chose the hard way and that was a bit unrealistic but essential to the ending we we can forgive.

It did set up what promises to be a very surreal and exciting Season 5!",1134432000,2,2581,4.424050632911392
2230206,3,B0007P14OE,"I have been watching 24 since its debut season.  It was an awesome show.

I watched Seasons 2 through 4 on DVD.  Season 4 is definitely a letdown.  Here are some of the reasons:

THE CHARACTERS:

The new characters are one-dimensional and poorly performed for the most part.

Mrs Araz:  Looks and acts like a robot.  Kills her son's girlfriend without any qualms, then flips out when her own son is sent to die.

Driscoll:  The new head of CTU, is annoying, incompetent, and cold.  She fights Bauer constantly, is forced to make the right calls by him, then takes credit for Heller's rescue.  Even with the addition of her schizophrenic daughter as a ""humanizing"" element; she is a waste of time.

Beirus Araz:  Looks like he is 12 years old.  Not believable as a terrorist.

Audrey Heller-Raines:  She's ok, but there is not a lot of chemistry between her and Jack.

The new president:  Cardboard cutout.

THE PLOT:

Same formulaic plot as in previous seasons:

1.  Jack not only fights terrorists but his own boss.

2.  There's a mole in CTU.

3.  Everyone is paranoid about everyone else and there's lots of backstabbing going on.

Plot flaws:

1. Mary Ann (mole) is new at CTU and given high-level clearance when she blackmails Edgar........

2. Mary Ann (again) overhears conversation between Edgar and Chloe which she later uses against Edgar.  This she does while standing at the top of the stairs  too far away from them to be able to cath the conversation.

On the other hand, Jack who is 10 feet away from terrorist in convenience store has a phone conversation with Chloe explaining his ploy to stage a holdup in order to delay terrorist.

3.  The list goes on.......

I still gave it 3 stars because, it is still exciting to watch and Kiefer Sutherland continues to give a strong and consistent performance throughout.  But I can see why the show didn't have a chance against LOST.",1134345600,5,1893,4.641337386018237
2230207,5,B0007P14OE,"THIS IS EASILY THE BEST SEASON YET. HOW THIS DIDN'T WIN THE EMMY OVER ""LOST"", I DON'T KNOW. OTHER THAN ""LOST"" BEING THE NEW SHOW AND ""24"" IS AN OLD VETERAN. IF THE NEXT TWO SEASONS ARE ANYTHING LIKE THIS ONE, LOS ANGELES IS DOOMED!!!!  ACTION PACKED FROM BEGINNING TO END. MOST EXCITING ,AND MY OPINION, BEST SHOW EVER.  WHO REALY CARES THAT THEY HAVE CELL PHONES THAT HAVE A NUCLEAR POWERED BATTERY THAT NEVER RUNS OUT. SERIOUSLY THE BEST SHOW EVER.",1134345600,2,450,4.475609756097561
2230208,5,B0007P14OE,"Emmy nominated for Best Drama series, 24 season 4 is considered by fans and critics to be the best season yet. Kiefer Sutherland stars in his Emmy nominated role as Jack Bauer, 24 Season 4 received the highest broadcast ratings of the series 4 year history.",1134259200,2,257,4.608695652173913
2230209,5,B0007P14OE,"The fourth longest day of Jack Bauer's life starts out with a bang, as usual. Jack has been dismissed from CTU by the new boss, Erin Driscoll (Alberta Watson), and now works for the Secretary of Defense, James Heller (William Devane.) Jack is secretly involved with Heller's married daughter, Audrey (Kim Raver.) Jack is in L.A. for a meeting with Driscoll over budgetary concerns, but as it happens, Muslim terrorists pick this very day to bomb a train and steal a very important briefcase from a courier. Things only get worse when Heller and Audrey are kidnapped and the terrorists threaten to put Heller on trial via the internet. These events launch Jack into yet another harrowing day filled with twists and turns. Along the way, Jack will make new enemies and will establish new friendships. He will also encounter familiar faces from the past like Tony Almeida, Chloe O'Brian, Michelle Dessler and even ex President David Palmer.

The problem with this season is in it's overall construction. In previous efforts, the writers had several large themes present throughout the entire course of one season that seemed to hold the plot together, even during the weak points. This time, they presented multiple threats with shorter story arcs. The result is short term satisfaction, but little story continuity as the mastermind terrorist goes from one plan to another and then another with inexplicable transition.

When the plots work, they work extremely well. The initial threat comes from the family next door, with Oscar-winner Shohreh Aghdashloo playing the terrorist matriarch and the scariest villain to ever grace 24. This plot was controversial enough that it caught the attention of certain American Muslim groups, who objected to the depiction of the Araz family. There's also a great storyline near season's end involving the Chinese, leading to an excellent season finale with a twist ending that sets things up nicely for Day 5. Unfortunately, we're also treated to too much torture, another mole in CTU and characters who disappear without explanation before we get to that point.

If there's one thing that 24 does better than most, it's the provision of great extras in almost every DVD set. The prequel to Day 5 isn't as long as producers promised, but it's a nice morsel that wets our appetites for things to come. All of the behind-the-scenes documentaries are a treat and some of the deleted scenes actually explain certain plot points that were cut from the broadcast episodes due to time constraints. There are also more commentaries in this set than any other and the insights given by writers and directors are great for us hard core fans, though its hard to figure out why Shannen Doherty could give us commentary, when Kiefer Sutherland couldn't.

Overall, 24 Season Four may be a mixed bag, but the good outweighs the bad and it still contains all of the riveting elements that make this one of the best shows on television today.",1134000000,,2962,4.965725806451613
2230210,5,B0007P14OE,"Season four of suspense drama 24 keeps the plot points coming and the suspense building once again.

In the aftermath of season 3, Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) was fired from CTU (Counter Terrorism Unit) Los Angeles.  But, always a resourceful guy, he lands on his feet with a job working for Secretary of Defense James Heller (William Devane).  In the year and a half away from CTU, true love may have finally come his way again as he builds a relationship with the boss's daughter, Audrey (Kim Raver).

All this comes crashing down as a cell of terrorists once again begin to carry out attacks on the US.  It starts with the kidnapping of James and Audrey, but that's only the start of a series of attacks planned by mastermind Habib Marvan (Arnold Vosloo).  As each crisis begins, the staff at CTU must find a way to deal with it all the while searching for Habib to end the constant attacks.

Viewers of the show were shocked to learn that many of the regulars from past years hadn't been asked to return for season 4.  While disappointing, it was probably a wise move because they were running out of storylines for these characters.  While Jack's daughter never did show up this season, they did bring back Tony (Carlos Bernard), Michelle (Reiko Aylesworth) and former President Palmer (Dennis Haysbert) in credible ways that added to the story.

Once again, the story reigns supreme with edge of your seat suspense from episode one until the end.  I didn't feel this season was quite as strong as the last one.  The multiple attacks made for a more fragmented feel for me.  Also, several of their plot complications are a little too familiar by now, making this season's cliffhangers some of the most predictable to date.  Still, these are minor squabbles in the grand scheme of things.  The pacing is sharp and the story line never gets too far off track.  And there are several surprising twists along the way.  I particularly enjoyed one involving CTU computer agent Chloe (Mary Lynn Rajskub).  Speaking of whom, she really grew on me this season.  While there are still times I love to hate her, I understand her more.

Which brings up an important point.  While plot is supreme on this show, characters are important as well.  By spending a very stressful day with these people, we do get to know, understand, and like them.  This point was really driven home to me near the end of the season when Tony and Michelle faced a crisis and I was so wrapped up in what would happen to them, I was actually more concerned with them then the millions of others in danger.

The contents of this seven disc set will come as no surprise to the fans that have been buying these all along.  The 24 episodes are presented in wide screen and full surround on the first six discs.  Each disc includes one commentary track and deleted scenes from the episodes.  Disc seven is where most of the bonus features are.  All the deleted scenes are presented again with optional commentary.  There are previews for season 5 as well as the new 24 video game.  Featurettes this go around include a look at creating the new set for CTU, a look at filming a car chase as well as the train explosion, and a look at the military expertise used to make CTU feel real.

While not my favorite season, this show is still at the top of its game and showing no signs of slowing down.  Because each season is its own story, new viewers could come in here without being too lost, although returning character's story lines won't mean as much.  Faithful fans will find much to love and little to complain about in this season.",1133827200,,3601,4.559190031152648
2230211,5,B0007P14OE,"You can argue about LOST, The Wire and Deadwood but for my money, this is as good as it gets. It does have a half life to it in that you tend to think nothing more can happen to Jack. But . . .

The show is buoyed by great tight writing. While Jack's voice is fantastic (how does he do that? Camels and Jack Daniels?) the guardians of the 24 gate are the writers. The plots are complicated and the mission equally multi-tasked. But the split screen and the subtle review of what's happened by a new person to the script-set-hour generally brings the audience up to snuff with each hour.

Additionally, the re-emergence of old tried and true characters like Dennis Haysbert (ex-President Palmer) and Carlos Bernard (Tony) is excellent both in the timing and the then current issue. I mean when Jack tells us he's got to turn to the one man he can trust, ya'll know he's going to find Tony somewhere and Tony's a litle drunk and feeling sorry for himself and misses Michelle (Reiko Aylesworth).

I don't miss Elisha Cuthbert. I mean she's a good actor and she's . . . . at the risk of being a sexist-pig-dog . . . a hottie. But I don't see her as the teenage or early 20's daughter of Jack Bauer, who, in the tradition of Jack Reacher and Luther Ewing, is a pleasant looking STONE COLD KILLER. I mean, did you catch the one where he cuts the guy's head off and brings it to someone to earn his trust? Elisha, all parts moving in synchronicity and showing a fair amount of skin hugging Jack and saying ""I love you, Daddy"" has me confused and a little off center.

So he should have a younger less sexy dauughter. You know, plunging necklines, cleavage and painted-on-jeans were all OK when in the first season she was in her rebellious, teenage slut mode. After that it grew tedious.

Nina was a great bent woman as was Sherry. Evil gorgeous women. Brrrr. I think it's a great series. Yes, eventually we'll get overloaded with it. Maybe they will have the decency to just end it without 3 or 4 years of the show being carried by the support staff. But for now, great stuff. What more TV ought to be like. Well. At least after the little tykes bed down. 5 stars. Latrr Scantlebury",1133481600,8,2176,4.349753694581281
2230212,4,B0007P14OE,"The television thriller 24 brought the audience a fresh and rapid TV series depicting genuine drama in real time.  The title stems from the notion of real time, as each season takes 24 hours and covers one concern while each episode covers one of these hours.  Within each hour, the audience gets to witness the actions of the bad guys, usually terrorists, being combated by the Los Angeles Counter Terrorist Unit (CTU) together with the involvement of the White House, as these matters are of highest priority to the national security.

The concept of 24 is brilliant, as Homeland Security has generated a color-coded security advisory system that reminds the people of the United States about the true nature of the terror threat.  While the people often ponder the notion of terror in fear, 24 merely cashes in on the audience's anxiety, by creating fictional scenarios that remain close to the politics and management of terrorism.  It is within the realism that the audience can connect with the events on the show, as similar incidents might (God forbid) happen to the people of United States.

The fourth season starts at 7:00AM, as a man on a train carries a metal briefcase chained to his wrist and has two guards with him.  However, the train runs into a truck and creates an explosion on impact.  It was a planned move by the attacker, Dar, who cuts the briefcase from the man's wrist.  The sudden opening catches the viewer's attention, as does the reason why the briefcase was stolen.  Shortly after, CTU is contacted and a meeting between the CTU and the Defense Department reveals that the main character, Agent Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland), has been fired from CTU by Erin Driscoll (Alberta Watson).

Jack now works for the Secretary of Defense James Heller (William Devane) and he is secretively having an affair with Heller's daughter Audrey (Kim Raver).  It is a year and a half past the deadly virus that threatened Los Angeles in season 3, but now a new threat has emerged in this season.  Besides the theft of the briefcase, the Secretary of Defense is kidnapped along with his daughter and later someone steals a stealth bomber, but all of these acts are preplanned to serve a greater malevolent scheme with a greater destructive purpose.  These plans surround one specific Habib Marvan, an Arabian terrorist, which the American government has been trying to locate, as he is in charge of a number of Middle Eastern terrorist cells.  A clear difference surfaces in the fourth season compared to the previous seasons, as there is not one threat, but multiple.

Season four is darker and stronger in some aspects.  For example, Jack has to face the dilemma of having his secret lover kidnapped, which possibly brings back memories when his wife was killed in the first season.  It could also be because the terrorists are rougher than before, which makes Jack approach the problems in a gloves-off approach.  In addition, the hideous act of torture for information has been an element in the previous seasons as well, but in the fourth season this too becomes more uncomplicated and cruel.  Otherwise the show continues to apply the split screens to help the audience understand what is happening while the occasional scurrying photography adds emotional aspects to the show such as realism, stress, and the element that time is of short supply.

24's fourth season does not reach the same high level as previous seasons.  One reason that affected 24's quality was the musical chair rotation of new and old faces in and out of the television thriller.  The changing of actors made it a little difficult to build connections with the new performers, and it affected the show somewhat.  Nonetheless, 24 offers a truly suspenseful political thriller that must be approached with the notion that it is fiction, or else it could intensify the anguish of watching the news and living life in the light of modern day politics.

DVD Features:

On the seventh disc on this DVD set of 24: Season Four the viewer can uncover a large number of goodies.  The special features open with a taste of the upcoming season five, which will air on television on January 15th, 2006.  The first feature on the next season is a Season 5 Prequel that offers an 11-minute introduction that will tip the audience to a little of what to expect.  Secondly, in the season five promotion there is a Fox Movie Channel: Making a Scene that shows the creation of a car chase.  A set design feature presenting the creation of the new CTU in fourth season of 24 and the opening train explosion has also received further treatment in the extras.  Lock and Load offers the audience some insight into the military expertise that was provided to create the tense militaristic approach that CTU provides in 24.  Three-dozen extended and deleted scenes will give the 24 enthusiasts an idea what could not be fitted to the time slots provided for its TV time.  There is also a chance for the audience to experience the innovating promotions of 24: Season Four that was sent through cell phones with the ability to play short mobisodes.  Here on the DVD set in the section that states 24: Conspiracy, the viewer can find all 24 mobisodes that originally were aired in Europe and later in the United States.  The audience can also enjoy the theme song from 24 performed by Sean Callery that is located on the second page of the extras section.  The extras end with the Inside Look that shows a promotional preview of The Sentinel (2006), a preview of 24: The Game, and link to website the 24: The Game.",1133395200,5,5581,4.777083333333334
2230213,2,B0007P14OE,"I have been an avid fan of the show since the first season. However, over the course of the past few seasons the show has started to become too predictable and stale both in the storytelling and locations. I was really psyched to hear that Jack was not going to be with CTU in the beginning of the 4th season, however the writers couldn't keep him away from that damn place. From that fall back, the writers continued to regurgitate old subplots, such as stop all progress on the terrorist threat and hunt down Bauer just so we can be a pain in the ass for Jack.  I mean come on, they've been doing that story for 3 seasons already! I want to see something new! Now onto the story telling and character development. First of all, I thought the pacing of the season was really rushed and had little or no development for the terrorist attacks nor the villains w/exception to the Araz family. Arnold Vosloo is a decent actor, but his portrayal of a terrorist leader was horrible to watch. Guys like Victor Drazen and Ramon Salazar brought character to the show, instead of just serving the story. I pray they go back to that formula for Season 5. As for the pros of season 4, I would have to say Secretary Heller was just badass. Despite not having Palmer involved for most of the season, you knew things were gonna be alright with Heller around (great addition to the show). And how about the inclusion of a greater threat....China! This was probably one of the redeeming points to the season. This plot thread will undoubtedly be continued into next season, and I think converting the show's locale of just CTU Los Angeles to international waters would really spice things up for intensity of the show. To me CTU has worn out its welcome, the writer's need to get Jack away from CTU and move on to bigger and better things. The D.O.D was a good start, I just think the show would be better served if Bauer started kicking ass over in Europe or Asia. The only reason I rated this season 2 stars, is for the 24 minute supposed prelude to season 5. I hope its worth it.",1132704000,11,2066,4.408376963350785
2230214,5,B0007P14OE,"Awesome is the best word i can find to describe this season. After watching the others one would have thought that 24 was at it's best but season 4 had to prove me wrong.

Jack is just awsome. This man does what he must to get the job done despite who he will offend doing it,wether it be his lady or the chinese. It doesn't matter who, he will do what it takes.

The terroists in this season are really a match for Jack. They are so relentless in their quest to destroy the USA that they forgot the person who  stood before their missions succeding or failing .'JACK BAUER'

I only wonder how season 5 will be

2230215,5,B0007P14OE,"The thrilling series ""24"" has changed the face of action-adventure. Big-screen movies are dull, plodding and timid compared to this brilliant television series. Season four was the very best -- meaning it was perhaps the greatest single action series ever on television. The creators obviously learned from what worked during previous seasons and they kept the action ratcheted up, streamlined the story to avoid any extraneous subplots, and continually topped themselves. Just when you thought -- no, they can't do that -- they did it! More than top-notch, edge-of-the-seat suspense, ""24"" redefines the genre. Intelligent, surprising, beautifully produced and craftily imagined, this is the kind of show you can't wait to share with your friends. And I can't wait for season five. A must for anyone who cares about and quality in action, adventure and drama.",1131753600,19,859,5.323529411764706
2230216,4,B0007P14OE,"Okay, let me first state that I have been hooked on this show since the very beginning. The idea of a tv show that unfolds in real time is a fascinating concept. That, and the fact that they blew up a plane in the first episode (less than two months removed from the worst terrorist attack in history, no less.) showed me that whoever was behind this project had serious balls and would push viewers to the limit.

Now, then, let me say that season 4 is going to be chided as unoriginal. How could they be original anymore? It's hard to keep that kind of continuity together when you write on the fly. And especially when you have to top yourself year after year to keep the show on the air. I enjoyed season 4 but it bugged me a lot.

Driscoll was practically useless. That and downright annoying. Good riddance. Bring in someone else in season 5 to run the show.

Another mole? Sheesh. I was on to Aisha Tyler from go. Worst attempt at re-creating Nina ever. (Man. I missed Nina this year. And Sherry Palmer too. The mega bitches are gone. Sigh.)

Arab terrorists with nuclear capabilities. Well, I know it's been talked about and all, terrorists getting their hands on nukes, but try another ethnic group. It's like, all of a sudden every terrorist cell will go for nukes within the same breath. Hey, if one don't get it the next one will, right? No wonder Kiefer had to make a PSA.

And the whole plot twist with Edgar's mom? Adam season 3, anyone? Jack, season 1? There needs to be a moritorium on families in harms way of the main and supporting characters.

The Araz family was a nice twist. Apple pie, Ward, June and the Beav, living in suburbia, plotting on the free world. A whole family. Good idea.

President Keeler. Such a waste. This show should never be without David Palmer in a presidential capacity. And as for Logan, can we sic Mandy on him? (I love her. Good character)

The Hellers were a mixed bag. Secretary Heller, fine. Audrey, pass. I'd rather have Kate Warner, thank you.

Tony and Michelle? Chase and Kim all over again.

But the ending? Magnifico!!! Made it all worth it. Lets just hope Samwise Gamge can function properly without having to protect Mr Frodo. For those lost ones out there, I'm referring to Sean Astin, who will be in Season 5.

And as for season 5, I think it'll be a manhunt at first, but then a 'hey Jack, we really need your help' kinda thing. Almost like season 2. But lets get a new threat please. No bioterror, no Arab nuke plots, and no assassinations. How about a militia or something? Just throwing that out! Looking forward to season 5. Can't wait!!",1130803200,8,2605,4.440251572327044
2230217,5,B0007P14OE,"Anyone who thought that a 4th series was a stretch too far for 24 were once again wrong, it just keeps going and doesn't lose any quality through each series.  As i stated in my review of the 3rd series it is no longer an original format but it never ceases to surprise me with it's amazing plot twists, this series perhaps more than any other.

First of all there are a number of new characters in the 4th series and a host of absentees from the previous season (some do return later on).  However it was probably time to clear out a few of the weaker characters such as Kim Bauer who hadn't really been important in the last two series.  Of the new characters the most significant is Audrey Raines, daughter of the Secretary of Defence (also prominent) and also Jack's new love interest.  Her husband how she is seperated from later appears to fight for her affections with Jack, and he is involved in one of the most amazing plot lines in all of the series.  Without giving too much away, Jack has to make a life or death decision, with dire consequences, this plot line probably surprised me more than any other in all 4 series, that is until the ending!

The ending is truly amazing, the best of all the series, I won't give it away but you'll never guess it, though it once again all makes sense in the end.  It will be very interesting to see how Jack is written into the 5th series.  Once again though, no quality has been lost since the last series, and buying this DVD is money well spent, can't wait for the return of the series in January over in England.",1130803200,,1567,4.302721088435374

A great TV series. This is not the type of show for occasional, casual viewing.",1130803200,6,341,4.396825396825397
2230219,3,B0007P14OE,"After all the dramatic changes in season 3 (Chappelle, Nina Meyers, and Sherry Palmer dead; Chase & Kim leaving CTU; Tony going to prison; Palmer not seeking re-election) season 4 starts off with only two returning characters, Jack and his numbskull secretary/tech guru Chloe.  Unfortunately most of the new characters just don't work out-- Erin Driscoll, the new head of CTU, is a retread on the ultra b***h Alberta Green (who the character should have been!).  After a lame melodramatic attempt to humanize her with her daughter, she leaves CTU in the middle of the season having served no purpose whatsoever.  Jack's new girlfriend, Audrey, is the lamest one he's had in four seasons of the show.  Kim Raver is unconvincing at times, and often has nothing to do later in the season.  Her father, the Secretary of Defense James Heller, is brilliantly played by William Devane, but the writing is so poor that it doesn't matter what he does.  By the end of the season, Heller drops of the map almost completely, appearing only once after leaving to meet with some people for the president in episode 16.  Speaking of the president, Keeler (yes, the Senator who you loved to hate from last season) is worthless, and suffers a similar fate to Driscoll.  At least his exit was more exciting (you'll have to see it to know what I mean).  His VP, played by Gregory Itzin, is a total weasel, and is unable to control the situation.  For some odd-reason (called low ratings) he decides to bring in (SPOILER!!!) David Palmer, even though he's a member of the opposite political party.  Other characters (Sarah, Curtis) are cardboard cutouts and uninteresting. It's no surpise when so many characters from previous seasons are brought back as the show progresses.

As for the plot of the season, it's hard to describe because it changes so many times over twety-four hours.  Remember the good old days of seasons 1 and 2 when their weren't so many threats?  The real-time aspect of 24 is often ignored in this season, and it cheapens it somewhat.

Now after all that, why did I give it three stars?  Because their are a few twists that you know about beforehand but don't expect to actually happen.  Because the ending is terrific (It's too bad the writers probably will give it the same treatment they gave the end of season 2).  Because Keifer Sutherland has never been better as Jack Bauer.  This is 24's worst season, but it's still worth watching.",1130630400,6,2444,4.748815165876778
2230220,5,B0007P14OE,"Though I will not compare ""24"" with Sitcoms, Animated Shows, and Reality TV because they are different categories- I will say without a doubt that 24 is the best drama on television.  The single flaw with the series is the selling point.  Most people do not give the show a chance, and once you miss an episode, it is extremely difficult to want to proceed.  The DVD sets, (though I have not yet had a chance to see the Season 5 prequel included on this) Are the height of the selling points.  Each set is comprhensive and contains exclusive content.  The DVDs are perhaps even a better way to go than watching the series on TV, save for the fact that not watching the show on TV decreases ratings- which is certainly not what the fans, including me, want.",1130198400,4,756,4.410071942446043

2230222,3,B0007P14OE,"It seems that there is a division among the reviewers as to whether Season 4 was the best season or the worst season.  I've been an avid 24 fan since Season 2 (bought Season 1 on DVD when it first came out).  I was actually excited to see what Season 4 had in store after seeing the extended trailer clips on the Season 3 set. However, by the end of the season I found myself very very dissapointed.

Don't get me wrong...24 is still a great show (one of the best on TV right now).  However, like many of the other reviewers, this season lacked the twists, the heart-racing ""what in the world is going to happen...I have to know?!?!?!"", strong characters, and any type of reasonably good subplot story.  Probably the worst thing done to the show in Season 3 was killing off two of the best arch-nemisis characters (Sherrie & Nina).  Then it's ""let's throw together the last three seasons into one""...mole Season 1, check...nuclear weapon in terrorist hands Season 2, check...villian with weird English sounding accent Season 3, check...Jack induced to a heart attack, Season 2, check...dropping something top secret into a wooded area/desert Season 1, check. No unpredictable twists in this season whatsoever unlike the preceding three seasons. And the only villian worth watching for is Mandy (who we recognize from Season 2) and I'm sure she'll be gone for the next season.  By mid-season, it was like the whole first half of the season had nothing to do with creating the ground for the second half (very disjointed).

The characters for the most part were ghastly.  I never liked Chloe last season and even with some improvement on her part, I still don't like her. Driscoll left too soon.  Aubrey was the worst love interest thus far. And the worst Tony/Michelle drama/situation yet. I guessed who the mole was this season by episode 2.

In spite of my major disappointments in the season, it is still a great show...in fact, it's better than most shows (exceptions in my book are Nip/Tuck and Family Guy).  For avid 24 fans, you'll probably pick up just like I will to complete the collection. However, for newer viewers, I highly recommend Seasons 1 & 2 and yes, even Season 3.",1129593600,5,2184,4.703412073490814

In season 4 the producers have decided to retreat from this extremely dark path. They have kept the creative surprises, action and suspense but have also paid more attention to pleasing the crowds. Contrary to the main stream of season 3, in season 4 positive things actually happen; there is a balance between good and evil and there's hope.

The events on screen do not fall from other events in prior seasons and some actually transcend the high points of the past.

2230227,3,B0007P14OE,"Season four does all the things wrong that seasons one and two got right. We loved 24 because it was an extended plot that happened at the pace it needed to happen, whether the ""climax"" was at the beginning, middle or end of the hour episode. I love long, intricately developed plots in TV shows (West Wing, Babylon 5, mid-run Buffy). Having watched the fourth season on TV (admittedly a different experience than DVD) you just get tired of 24 contrived mini-climaxes. And because they always tried to have a climax at the end of the episode, many are obviously delayed or otherwise contrived. The last episode is such a small climax that I failed to realise it was the last hour until just before the credits rolled. It would probably be OK if each episode was supposed to be a self-contained story, but the point of 24 is that it isn't.

So in summary, too much contrivance and, without better writing, I can't see the show lasting after season five, which I won't be bothering with on TV. I think the ""let's torture people to get information"" advocation should dropped from the show, too.",1127952000,9,1091,4.5948717948717945
2230228,3,B0007P14OE,"If you have seen Seasons 1-3 of 24 you will probably be disappointed by Season 4. Its repetetive, downright boring at times, the new characters explore incredible depths of lousy acting and the reoccuring characters are a shadow of their former selfes (maybe with the exception of Kiefer Sutherland and - surprisingly - Mary Lynn Rajskub (Chloe))

(Warning: The following may contain spoilers)

Granted, it may have been difficult to find some threat that tops the previous ones. If you expect something unique original or cunning, well... nope. Not this time. The writes/producers may have thought something along the line ""well, day 1 was scary, day 2 was scary, lets combine it into one day - must be doubly scary."" Well, its not. I believe that there are many different possible threats and plots that can be subtly developed throughout the course of the season and gain depth along the way, ""Bad Arab & Nuke"" is not one of them.

In fact, the entire plot is extremly repetitive and unimaginative. Regardless of what other reviewers may think ther are NO surprising twists. It is so transparent that from the storyline and the dialog - and because most of it is warmed up S1/S2 - you will know exactly what is going to happen in the next couple of episodes.

Not that the plot is the only ""remake"". There is absolutely nothing original in Season 4. It is a patchwork of basically every story element seen before in the other seasons: A love interest that falls apart, a love interest that develops, the Mole (I can't believe they put a mole in CTU - AGAIN!), the internal quarrels, the family drama, the key witness shot in anger by a distraught ""friendly"", the heroic agent going covert for the purpose of deniability, and on and on and on...)

In between its good old ""find lead, almost catch bad guy, loose lead"". And that is unfortunately all there is to say about their efforts. No clever plots to trap/track/convince witnesses as in S1/S2. It really is nothing more than ""find address on hostile computer, go there"". This is combined with an extremely ignorant and one-dimensional picture of arab families and values - of course not without telling us politcally correct that there may be good ones too, as long as they are born in america.

Credibility: I don't mind if writers go a little bit beyond whats ordinary possible, but this season is ridiculous, no, downright laughable. Book-sized devices that can make nuclear reactors melt down? All of them, remotly over the internet? That actually made me laugh. In addition, this time CTU seems to have unlimited technology (except anything remotely helpful in getting information from people), they found a way to make every single electronic device and network protocol compatible and they finally invented translocation. (I know that in prior seasons people also seemed to get to locations awfully fast but it was still believable. This time they manage to set up and execute two missions in opposite parts of LA in about 35 minutes) The way they get everywhere in no time at all is distracting and a big disappointment compared to the way the ""approach"" was integrated into the story in earlier seasons.

The combination of mediocre (at best) acting and sloppy, shallow character development make the first couple of episodes a pain to watch. ""Fortunately"" it becomes clear very early in the season that ""the good ol' team"" will be re-introduced bit by bit during the seasons but again it is so transparent that its a relief, not a surprise. (Nina in S3 was a surprise, ex-President Palmer coming back as advisor in Season 4 after the president stumbles along for 5 episodes and virtually every character makes his/her ""I'm not sure if the president is up to it..."" speech is please-hit-me-over-the-head-again obvious and corny.)

Conclusion:

I may be overly harsh with Season Four, mainly because I found Season 1 and especially Season 2 extremely well done. Season Four is unimaginative and predictable. In my opinion the show detoriated rather than developed since its early days and it has been severly dumbed down. Compared to the others 24-Seasons, Season Four deserves at most one star BUT compared to what else is out there it still deserves three.

My advice is: If you liked S1 and S2 but found S3 a bit boring, save your money and buy something else. If you are a big fan of 24 or of Kiefer Sutherland (who is not at his best this time but still good) you might want to buy this, just to see for yourself. If you have seen it in tv, or most of it in tv, again - save your money, Season Four has no re-view value.

If you have never seen 24 before (or just bits and pieces on tv) rather buy Season 1 and Season 2",1127779200,16,4688,4.711843711843712

Otherewise Jack Bauer is a  deadly shot and so committed that he is beginning to look too good to be true.  Nevertheless it is a great show.  Hopefully no Kim anymore.",1127174400,,356,4.415384615384616
2230234,5,B0007P14OE,"Season 4 of 24 is definitely bigger and better than the previous seasons.. It is by far more ambitious and the terrorists in season 4 are just very smart.. This has to be my favourite season so far. This new season also introduces some fresh new faces at CTU.

With more plot twists and action than ever before.. This has got to be the best 24 season so far.

I highly recommend this DVD set for all 24 fans out there!! A must have!",1126915200,5,432,4.130952380952381
2230235,3,B0007P14OE,"The problem with this series is that the first half is much better than the second. If the program were called '13' or '14', I suspect the writers would have an easier time. Or maybe we should call it 'Cisco Fox' because of all the product placement. HP also does well in placing its laptops and PDAs throughout each series.

Once the Araz family is eliminated, we get a 'Thunderbirds'-style story showing a wobbly nuclear missile taking off in someone's back garden and a Blackbird plane shooting down Airforce One. Production budgets prevent us from seeing much of this action, so we just get reported speech in the CTU control room to tell us what has happened.

The story leaves so many unanswered questions: What happens to the first youth who spots the unusual Internet activity? What happens to the Araz son? What happens to the defence chief's son? Where does Marwan get all his money from? Why doesn't CTU bother to investigate the source of Marwan's funding? After the knockout emission, what happens to the bosses of the dodgy company for which Marwan worked? Why is Jack Bauer never targeted by the terrorists before each story begins -- don't they know that he'll win the day for the President if allowed to live?

Perhaps 24 has too many writers, unconcerned about creating a joined-up story.

The best incident in the whole series is the moment when Tony returns. I'll try to give nothing more away.",1126742400,6,1414,4.735772357723577

I can't wait to see what they are going to do next season, I only hope we see some familiar faces in season 5 coming up. Anyone who has not watched any of the shows, should try season 1 first, but only if there's no where you have to be for a couple of days, as it's very hard to walk away from.  I got a couple of my friends hooked on this show, and it has yet to disappoint me.  I hope everyone enjoys this season, we have to keep it around!!!",1126483200,6,540,3.7610619469026547

*Fake technobabble
*Computer geeks who don't know what an EMP is
*""Competent"" people who attempt to stay hidden while playing with flashlights in the dark

* ""Plot armor"", literally, SUDDENLY becoming functional when vests, vehicles, and flimsy walls suddenly become extremely effective for protecting key characters from bullets - but remain quite useless for everybody else
