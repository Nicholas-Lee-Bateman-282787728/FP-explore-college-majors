8491710,5,B00632KSH4,"This set was previously released as ""Saturday Morning Cartoons, 1970s, Vol. One&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saturday-Morning-Cartoons-1970s-Vol-1/dp/B001QU880W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saturday Morning Cartoons: 1970s Vol. 1</a>. Open the case and you'll find the exact same two discs. So if you didn't get that set first time around, get this one. It's a great deal, with over five hours of cartoons. See the list below for complete contents. One may wonder why I'd give this five stars when I gave a lower rating to the previous 1960s 4 Kid Favorites&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/4-Kid-Favorites-Saturday-Morning-Cartoons-1960s/dp/B00632KUNG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">4 Kid Favorites: Saturday Morning Cartoons - 1960s</a>&nbsp;collection . It's merely a matter of timing. Everyone had already bought Saturday Morning Cartoons 1960s when it came out (and loved it)&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saturday-Morning-Cartoons-1960s-Vol-1/dp/B001QU880M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saturday Morning Cartoons: 1960s Vol. 1</a>, and thought the later set had different cartoons when, in fact, it was the same set repackaged. H-B merely could have noted that on the package and saved everyone a lot of trouble.

And whereas the first style of packaging included a slipcase, this second, budget style is simply odd. ""4 Kids"" is already the name of a non-H-B animation company. The ""4"" suggests you get lots of episodes of four different shows. You don't. You get 17 cartoons from various shows. Hong Kong Phooey is the only accurate portrayl on the case cover. Yogi Bear is actually the restyled (updated?) Yogi of ""Yogi's Gang"". The Josie cartoon is actually from the later spin-off series, ""Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space"" (presently only available as a custom-made DVD-R). The Batman episode is from the ""Batman/ Tarzan Adventure Hour"". And while the front heralds ""4 Kid Favorites"", the back contains a disclaimer so often seen on classic cartoons in our present, confused time: ""Some content may not be suitable for children."" If one read the fine print on the case, one might wonder why it lists legal details for The Banana Splits Show, Grape Ape, Inch High Private Eye, Shazzan, Sealab 2020 and other cartoons not actually on the discs. Hopefully shows like Banana Splits are slated for later release.

Some of these cartoons were shown on Cartoon Network's Boomerang channel, and on the ""Boomerang"" show on CN, and ran in various places in syndication since their original 1970's air dates. Critics are often dismissive of Hanna-Barbera's massive output, but you like 'em or you don't. Everyone has their favorites, and you tend to like what you grew up with. As a stalwart H-B fan, I welcome this blast from the past, even if my favorite H-B 'toons date from the '50s and '60s. Disclaimer or no, I'd say these cartoons, unlike so much TV of today, are completely suitable for kids of any age. Finally, TV you can watch with your kids, and adults may find their own H-B favorites.

8491711,3,B00632KSH4,"As an avid cartoon collector AND a child of the seventies, I was delighted when I first saw this collection on the shelves.  Unfortunately, being a collector also means that I already had about half of the cartoons contained therein.  Most of the titles here are from Hanna Barbera, and are availble on separate ""complete series"" collections.  But still, it's hard to argue with choices included.

I have very fond memories of watching shows like Speed Buggy, Josie & The Pussycats, and the Batman/Tarzan Adventure Hour (the only non-Hanna Barbera cartoon here, by the way) and eating a couple of bowls of cereal on those magical Saturday mornings.  And that's the appeal of this set.  It may be hard to get modern kids into silly shows like ""The Funky Phantom"" or the Charlie Chan one, but those of us watching them through the rose-colored glasses of nostalgia are willing to forgive their faults.

On a technical note, Warner Bros. has included a disclaimer that not all of the shows are derived from pristine elements.  I personally found them all to be quite acceptable, with the more high-profile shows like The Jetsons and Scooby Doo looking the best.  With over 5 hours of content spread over 2 discs, you'll get your money's worth, even if a few of the cartoons aren't exactly HD quality.

Bottom line: If you grew up watching these cartoons, you'll probably still get a kick out of them now.  If not. . .well, you'll probably wonder what the big deal is.",1333929600,6,1464,4.724409448818897
8491712,4,B00632KSH4,"I think that this is a great way to sample some of Sat AM the way Saturday morning used to be... We can have action, comedy, Adventure all in one setting... We have Hong Kong Phooey, Jose and the Pussycats, and Wheeley and the Chopper Bunch... I also think this was a great way to introduce new fans to some lesser known toons...  I think that the shows could have been cleaned up and restored for release in spite of the elaments used to bring us this DVD set...  I would think that WB would give these cartoons a good restoration and show some pride in their properties... Other then that.. This collection has something for everyone....",1332201600,2,639,4.452991452991453
