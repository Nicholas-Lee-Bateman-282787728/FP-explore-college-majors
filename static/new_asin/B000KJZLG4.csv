8160334,5,B000KJZLG4,"A-Z original DVD with book  by Keti breaks down all the moves, caberet, classical, folkloric and some advanced sequences. All dance sequences are creatively named to help you remember. Keti shows the frontal view and then  shows each move with her back to the camera so you can follow her steps like you were in her studio. This is a great addition for any bellydancers library.",1178496000,6,378,4.712121212121212
