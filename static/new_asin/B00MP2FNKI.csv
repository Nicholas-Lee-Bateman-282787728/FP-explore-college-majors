8673752,1,B00MP2FNKI,"Includes plot points, briefly. We already know everyone dies in the end except one person from the opening.

This is introduced as an anonymous source film being shown to a jury without any objection to admission of evidence. Once you get past this hurdle, we get to see a found footage tape shot by Billy (Ryken Zane) over a several day period while he wears the same shirt and tie. Billy is reluctantly shooting a kick-off promotional party for Firestarter Vodka without Drew Barrymore. The party is to take place in a haunted house. The film begins with a bunch of boring interviews, goes to a party where white people stand around drinking vodka in a plastic cup saying what a great party they are throwing. Tony (Dan Gruenberg) gets lucky and unlucky with Angela (Apriel Starkweather) whose face in on the screen doing a monologue and humping her pillow for the last 15 minutes or so. This was way too long. Interviews way too long and boring. And we never get to see the fire that killed them, light on special effects. I did like the Elvis guy.

8673754,1,B00MP2FNKI,"Worst movie ever.  Terrible, boring plot.  It is not funny, scary, or gory.  The acting is horrendous.  It essentially just promotes a vodka brand.  Don't waste your money.  Even if it were free to watch, I wouldn't recommend it.",1417132800,2,229,4.743589743589744
