8055367,5,B000823AZ2,"Mujaan is a Mongolian craftsman who builds round homes called ""gir"" mainly from wood and sheep's wool.  Chris McKee's film shows in exquisite detail how this is done.  There is almost no dialogue and very few subtitles.  Everything is visual.  From the windswept steppes (now in verdant summer green) to the big sky to the flies and blades of grass in the valley that cradles the craftsman as he works, McKee lets the events speak for themselves.  The idea is to show the ingenuity and artistry of a people.

The film works on three levels.  First there is the subject at work with hand axe and improvised mallet doing the construction.  We see moving snapshots of him at various stages as the house is being built.  Additionally we see the herds of sheep and the characteristic little horses of the Mongols.  There are some examples of what is eaten and how the food is prepared.  There is roasted marmot stuffed with garlic and hot rocks and there are dumplings of lamb.  We see a man and child playing at a game with sheep's bones used as dice.  We see Sukhbaatar, who is the craftsman, playing a sing-song game with the buyer of the house, a game that might be called ""how many fingers?"" as they try to guess how many fingers they will display together--zero to ten.

On another level McKee shows us how the various tableaux are painted in the traditional Mongolian artistic style called ""Mongol Zurag"" which emphasizes people in a landscape existing at the same time with no one at the center.  There is no sky and no perspective, as opposed to, for example, the Taoist style in which people are seen small against great mountains and high sky.  McKee shows the brush strokes of the artist at work painting the craftsman while his camera shows the craftsman at work.  The effect is to blend craftsmanship with art, to show humans as builders and painters who demonstrate their appreciation of the natural world through their work.  There is an irony here since the Mongols under the infamous Chingis Khan are better known historically for their ability to destroy and plunder.  But of course all peoples both build and destroy.

The third level is McKee's camera and how it captures a way of life.  Although I can see the dung flies and imagine the cold winter winds to come, right now all is idyllic.  One senses a unity of humans with their herd animals, each dependent upon the other.  In the most striking sequence of the film we see Mujaan take one of his herd and gently, but firmly turn the animal on its back on his lap, and with a very sharp knife lay open the sheep's belly.  It is almost an embrace, it is so lovingly done.  I am reminded of how the lion licks its prey after the killing and before the eating as though in loving ritual.  And then the man reaches into the abdominal cavity of the sheep and pulls out the beating heart and stills it with his hands.  In the background intermittently are examples of Mongolian music, some of the lyrics sung by Sukhbaatar.

In a commentary included on the DVD archaeologist Jeannine Davis-Kimball explains that in this manner the animal is not drained of blood, but instead the nutrients in the blood stay in the meat giving it a robust and gamey favor much appreciated by the nomadic people.

Comparing this film with the PBS documentary in which Julia Roberts appeared and the Globe Trekker production, both about the Mongols of the steppes, I have to say that Chris McKee's film, while shorter (about 25 minutes) is much more affecting, probably because it is a carefully composed work of art that goes beyond the merely descriptive.

Included with the DVD is a booklet with the Mongol Zurag painting on the cover, and inside are some suggested lessons to accompany the showing of the film in the classroom.

Bottom line: I was mesmerized by the artistry of McKee's technique and the way he used the various elements to tell his story, the story of building a shelter against the coming winds, a family's home made from materials at hand, a home that can be taken down and moved as the herds move to new grass, and put up again, the centerpiece of a nomadic way of life that has existed for millennia, a way of life that will soon be gone...captured on film.",1118534400,8,4225,4.57845744680851
8055368,5,B000823AZ2,"In an age when much of modern society has become alienated from the land, and this film offers a refreshing glimpse of that lost connection. In Mujaan, we encounter a tapestry of the sights and sounds of the Mongolian countryside, the nomadic people and their herds, their hand work, their humor, their families, and their art. This film is a colorful peek into an ancient and probably vanishing way of life, by a filmmaker who clearly honors his subjects and their world. The extras on the DVD are also fun and exciting!",1114300800,2,521,4.673913043478261
8055369,5,B000823AZ2,"Mujaan follows the building of a home in Mongolia. We watch as the worker goes through each step - from the felling of the tree to the crafting of each piece by hand -- and ultimately the raising of the home itself. I found it fascinating to watch this central part of a life - even central to us in this country (the home we live in), but a version of it so much simpler and close to nature than anything most of us will ever experience.",1114214400,,438,4.045977011494253
8055370,5,B000823AZ2,A captivating slice of life on how traditional nomadic tent dwellings- known as gir- are made from start to finish on the Mongolian steppes.  Highly recommended!!!,1113436800,,163,5.269230769230769
8055371,5,B000823AZ2,"If you have ever been interested in Mongolian culture that is over a thousand years old and will continue for generations, then this is the documentary for you.  Chris McKee very smoothly films the lifestyle of a Mongolian architect, who builds a house using primitive tools and techniques.  Narration is kept to a bare minimum, giving you the total feel of the experience.  The film is a fast 30 minutes, and is highly recommended.",1113177600,2,432,4.8108108108108105
8055372,5,B000823AZ2,"Taking you into another time, another world, Mujaan allows viewers a rare look into a lifestyle so very much different from our own. Leading us through the construction of the same ""houses"" that Genghis Khan's army used nearly a millenium ago, Mujaan takes you to a place very much the same as it was hundreds of years ago. Chris Mckee skillfully brings this alternate world into our homes with a magnificent eye for the beauty of this long lost countryside.",1112659200,,458,4.7375
8055373,5,B000823AZ2,"This film is as fascinating and authentic as it gets- you watch, step by step, a Mongolian nomad building a ger in the traditional manner, a unique form of cultural heritage and expression. The landscape is as stunning as Weeping Camel and shows a different side of Mongolia rarely depicted in film and books: Khenti Aimag, the remote north east region once the homeland of Genghis Khan (Chinggis Khaan)- I highly recommend this film for anyone interested in Mongolian culture, nomads or traditional building methods.",1111708800,4,517,5.094117647058823
8055374,5,B000823AZ2,A breath-taking study of the Mongolian countryside and a compelling homage to traditional Mongolian practices that will soon disappear. Discover Mongolia through Mujaan!,1111622400,5,169,6.391304347826087
