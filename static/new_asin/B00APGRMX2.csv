5463760,5,B00APGRMX2,This is one of the greatest season series I've ever purchased. I am a huge movie buff and Star Wars fan. I highly recommend them series of dvds.,1406505600,3,144,4.178571428571429
5463761,5,B00APGRMX2,"If you want to know what happened between Episode II and Episode III, then you'll want to watch this series. I actually like the Anikan is portrayed in this series than in the movies.",1400544000,4,183,4.411764705882353
5463762,5,B00APGRMX2,Great collection and a must buy for Star Wars fans!  I was a little hesitant to buy this collection at first just seeing screen caps but my buddy recommended it to me because he knew my love for Star Wars.  Well he was right.  Look past the few oddities of the show as it was made for kids and you will enjoy the series!,1397779200,24,320,3.96875
5463763,5,B00APGRMX2,"After the clone wars movie ran theatrically, this show aired on cartoon network (which no longer has 24 hours of Toons)! The episode weren't made in chronological order, two of them are set before the movie! I don't think the movie is included in this set (I bought each season by themselves), so it may be best to get that too! All episodes, including season six not yet on Blu Ray, can be watched by streaming on Netflix (bonus features not included)! I'm still waiting for the season six Blu Ray, but I've watched them on Netflix! If you don't care about Blu Ray bonuses, some people only watch the show (deleted scenes for a new hope, the empire strikes back & return of the Jedi wasn't enough for some), you can stream on Netflix!

If you like the phantom menace, attack of the clones & revenge of the Sith, you should enjoy the clone wars! It's set between attack of the clones & revenge of the Sith! Anakin Skywalker had a Padawan too: Ahsuka Tano! Anakin was taught by Obi-Wan! Obi-Wan was taught by Yoda & Qui-Gon! Qui-Gon was taught by Yoda & Count Dooku! Count Dooku was taught by Yoda (and perhaps someone else)! Now we know Anakin was teaching too!

The star wars clone wars micro series was entertaining, but couldn't be cannon if Bariss Offee was promoted to knight before Anakin Skywalker! In this show, she's still a Padawan when Ani is a knight! They can't both be right, so I side with the show created by George Lucas! Will just see how Star Wars Rebels & Star Wars Seven gets on without him!

Star Wars The Clone Wars Season Six Blu Ray is expected to come in October! I hope so! Want to complete my collection!",1397174400,6,1632,4.415282392026578
5463764,5,B00APGRMX2,"If you like star wars you will probably like these. Note that the first couple seasons start of pretty mild since they were essentially testing the waters, but don't be fooled, the series get's really good around season 3 and slowly endorses more and more mature themes.",1523232000,,270,4.76595744680851
5463765,5,B00APGRMX2,Arrived fast and all worked great.,1522713600,,34,4.833333333333333
5463766,4,B00APGRMX2,"The video quality is excellent, the physical cases/disks, etc. are perfectly fine.  The show is fantastic, and that's probably why you're here in the first place.  Now, if your plan is to rip these blu rays for digital storage, beware: All the episodes for Season 2 and Season 3 will show up as one giant video instead of separate episodes.  Seasons1, 4, and 5 are perfectly fine and do not have this issue, the episodes will show up individually.  I have absolutely no clue why this is the case.  I have tested all disks multiple times using MakeMKV to read/rip the content, and every time it's the same disks/seasons that do this.  I've never seen this with any other series, so it's pretty odd.  But again, if your intent is to simply watch these on a blu ray player, I don't think you'll have an issue.

For my case, though, I happen to be an Adobe Creative Cloud subscriber with Adobe Premiere. So I just ripped the huge video files, then converted them with Handbrake so they could be imported into Premiere, then I simply split the video files up and rendered each episode out individually.  Which was honestly kindof a pain in the ass, so def 1 star knocked off for that. Because if someone else happens to run into this and DOESN'T have a good video editor/render engine, they are pretty much screwed.

Other than all that, I'm really happy with my purchase!  I know Netflix has this show and all, but now I have the best quality (you'd be surprised how much Netflix actually kills the quality of the content they host....even a semi-cartoon show like this.  It's highly compressed, and it's noticeable.)

In closing, I'll echo the thoughts of most of the reviewers here in that this show is amazing.  If you're an adult and you've never seen it, and you're thinking ""it's just a stupid cartoon""...well, yeah, in some parts it can be pretty cheesy.  It is made for kids.  HOWEVER, that said, when you dive into it, you will notice more than enough content that can be appreciated by all ages.  There are some moments to this show that rival any other show I've ever seen in the quality of writing, voice acting, and general feeling/direction being shown on screen.  You will come to love the characters, and you will even find a newfound appreciation for the Prequels, because this show tells us how the Prequels COULD HAVE BEEN.  It's that good.  So jump on board and prepare to be amazed!",1522454400,2,2399,4.573770491803279
5463767,5,B00APGRMX2,Its such a good show! Introduces some great characters and explores many cool things in the Star Wars mythology.,1522108800,,112,4.947368421052632
5463768,5,B00APGRMX2,"I had read a review before buying saying that an episode was missing in s5. When I watched it I cross checked with Netflix. All episodes are there but the episode with Obi, Hondo, and Maul are now lumped in with the Mandalore/Death Watch arc.",1521676800,2,242,4.4

5463772,4,B00APGRMX2,"I haven't watched all of the episodes, but it looks like it has all episodes from seasons 1 thru 5. The episode list in the case for season 2, disc 3 is wrong. It repeats the names of 2 episodes, and a 3rd is out of order. But the episodes on the disc are correct.  Because of the misprint, Im dropping one star.

I was concerned when I read a review that the episode Revival from season 5 was missing. It is not missing, there was a decision to air it before the actual premiere. The episode appears on the disc in the original order.

Even though this an import, it played without a problem on my PS3.",1520640000,,603,4.093220338983051

5463779,5,B00APGRMX2,"Hm, what i liked the most.. oh idk! Its Star Wars! The least? Apparently this isn't the set that allows you to be stolen into the tv for hours on end living the dream, other than that the picture is great.",1517356800,,205,4.024390243902439
5463780,4,B00APGRMX2,"I enjoy this series.  I don't think it is nearly as good as the first Clone Wars' series that were written.  These also seem to have some inconsistencies.  That said, it is good animation and an all around enjoyable watch for any Star Wars fan.",1517184000,,244,4.377777777777778
5463781,4,B00APGRMX2,I was not interested in animated The Clone Wars until I started watching Rebels.  Once I got used to the pace and feel of Rebels I wanted to try out The Clone Wars.  I like that each episode is short.  They are easy to watch either one at a time or in batches.  I like the behind the scenes that are available in each season.  It really helps explain how the story and worlds developed.,1517097600,2,386,4.093333333333334

5463783,5,B00APGRMX2,"I highly recommend the UK set over the US set.  The seasons in cases that match the US individual season sets, plus the episode listings on the back of the inserts are much better than the jumbled mess you get in the US complete set.  Discs are all flawless, unlike my two attempts at buying the US set.  Plus, odds are you are getting a set with corrected season 5 discs now.  Mine are the corrected ones.  Amazing show.  Get it now before Disney and Warner get into it over rights.",1516579200,5,483,4.252747252747253

5463785,5,B00APGRMX2,"This series digs deep into the Clone Wars of the Old Republic (who really just called themselves the Republic).  It's also a fun expansion of the Force and Force abilities, and doesn't shy away from showing the sheer aptitude of combat Jedi in their prime.  The animation is really good for a 3D engine; sometimes the motion seems a little slow, but the colors more than make up for it, especially in 1080 HD.  Story and character quality varies from episode to episode, but inconsistency is sparse, and there're plenty of main and secondary characters to love, like, loathe, or love to hate.",1516147200,2,592,4.728155339805825

5463790,5,B00APGRMX2,"I am in love with this series. Very nicely packaged and bundled. It's a great series for any Star Wars lover. First season caters to a younger audience, middle seasons are incredible and fill in so much detail from the SW universe, last season Disney took over and wanted to end it so it's a bit of a mess and ended abruptly. It is still on Netflix, but with Disney starting their own streaming service soon, I'm sure it will be leaving soon.",1511654400,,442,4.337349397590361

5463793,5,B00APGRMX2,"It took me a long time to give this show a chance. I'm glad I did.

By Star Wars standards, the movie was not very good. Yes, it was basically just four early episodes of the show---its first proper story arc---strung back to back. But it's one of the weakest, dumbest story arcs in the whole series, and the characters hadn't quite gelled yet.

On top of that, I detested the show's look. Didn't like the character designs, didn't like how they moved. It's just not a style of animation I'm naturally drawn to.

But I'm glad I got over it. The stories are great, and you come to love the characters and care about their relationships. They expand and enrich the Star Wars canon in profound and meaningful ways. The show's fun, funny, sweet, heartbreaking, and often startlingly dark. A few moments in the Darth Maul arc are utterly terrifying in the best way. His arc, the Nightsisters arc, and the Zillo Beast arc are among my favorites.

The animation has grown on me, no doubt helped along by all of the above-listed virtues. In the case of some characters, particularly those we haven't yet seen (or have only seen minimally) in their flesh-and-blood forms, the style works brilliantly. The landscapes, cityscapes, creatures, and space action often look breathtaking. And the animation does, I think, become surer of itself as the series progresses.

Minuses include occasionally clunky dialogue and a ""camera"" that sometimes seems overly fascinated by the midsection and/or thighs of anyone female and remotely humanoid. For those reasons, plus the odd sub-par episode, I'd give the show 4.5 if I could. I'd give the same score to this Blu-ray collection; while the picture and sound quality are generally great, there's the occasional digital weirdness---but far from bad or frequent enough to dissuade you.

If you're looking for Season 6, it's available separately as ""The Lost Missions"" and includes some of the best episodes in the series' entire run.",1508976000,3,1962,4.912386706948641

5463795,5,B00APGRMX2,"I haven't bought the set yet because I can currently get it on Netflix.  But I AM going to buy it because I want it in my library!  This is a wonderful work of animation and movie making.  The quality of animation is fantastic and great detail has gone into it in every way.  The lighting, special effects (I know, its ALL special effects), plots voice overs, diversity and sound and music.  Voices are many of the original cast and the story lines follow the live movies.  I can't say enough about this series and am watching it the second time through with no loss of interest or enjoyment.  I am ordering the set soon!  As well as the Lost Missions!

5463805,5,B00APGRMX2,I watched the original series when it originally aired on Cartoon Network and loved it.

5463806,5,B00APGRMX2,A must watch for any Star Wars fan!! This will redeem the prequels! Anakins portrayal is done much better thanks to Feloni and team.

The library copy must have been carefully selected to have less violent episodes.  All of the episodes I let him watch (before I took it away and hid  it from him) were WAY too violent for a 5 year old.  I am a HUGE Star Wars lover, saw the first movie when I was 4 in the movie theaters, and have dreamed of being Princess Leia ever since.

Even the first episode looks stunning, even more so than more modern series. The listing is a little mislead as there are only 14 disks (just like the US release) the bonus 15th disk was a limited time addition when originally released.

5463860,1,B00APGRMX2,"Let me start off with the most important part: IT DOES NOT WORK.  I have region-free UK releases of Game of Thrones and Battlestar Galactica that work perfectly on every blu-ray reading device I own including an Xbox One and PS4. THIS ONE DOES NOT WORK.

Now, for the exponentially less important things.

As most will know, this is not the complete series. It doesn't include the theatrical film, nor Season 6 (""The Lost Missions"") or the 2003-2005 Cartoon Network miniseries (which canonically meshes with this series and introduces two critical characters not introduced in this 2008 series). At roughly 40% of the price of buying each season separately or the US Blu-Ray collection, you'll get the cheapest blu-ray cases that, with two or three discs each, take up as much space as some 6-disc cases I have, and does not include the mini art books and inserts that came with the initial releases of seasons 1 and 2, but that may still be worth it to you if your player can read Region B discs. Episode guides are on the flip side of the cover insert, but at least Season 2 has episodes listed on two separate discs while omitting others. In short, unreliable, which is bothersome considering how messed up the chronology of the first three seasons was (In usual Star Wars fashion).

However, the series is entertaining for kids and adults and the dark themes of Revenge of the Sith begin to show themselves halfway through the series, with several multi-episode arcs that are like watching an entire Star Wars movie. This is the easiest and by far cheapest way to get the ""whole"" series (To date, no set contains the movie and season 6 and they must be purchased separately) and is worth it if you're willing to deal with numerous superficial inconveniences and if your set happens to work in the US.

Pick up the movie, Season 6, and the original 2003 series (in two volumes) and find an episode guide to get the correct order of episodes. Force knows you'll need it.",1483660800,4,1972,4.655172413793103

The box itself is pretty nice too. Although I noticed with imports that they just take the regular seasons and put them in a box (they did this with Arrow seasons 1-3)

5463916,4,B00APGRMX2,"I'm reviewing this as a Star Wars fan who saw the first movie (Episode 4) when it was first released, and who tolerated but didn't love Episodes 1-3.  When I first heard about Clone Wars, I admit that I skipped it entirely.  It seemed like it would capture all of the worst points of the newer trilogy: mindless action, annoying kid-oriented characters, and poor writing.  But then more recently I gave Star Wars: Rebels a chance, and based on liking that series, I went back, ordered these discs, and watched the series.  I am glad that I did.

In some ways, Clone Wars is more daring than Star Wars: Rebels.  Rebels is a traditional episodic series that follows a group of would-be rebels through a series of adventures that are largely self-contained with core threads of continuity between them.  Clone Wars, in contrast, is a series of short stories set in the gap between Episodes 2 and 3.  Each story arc lasts 2 to 4 episodes, and many focus on characters that are secondary (at best) in the main Star Wars stories or even created from whole cloth for the specific story.  There are entire episode arcs where bounty hunters, clones, droids, random Jedi, leaders of other worlds, and minor Sith are the main characters and the ""major"" series characters like Yoda, Obi Wan, and Anakin barely appear.  This enables the writers to paint a much broader picture of the Star Wars universe and its back stories, but also sadly falls prey to the obvious pitfall of such a structure: some arcs are weak stories focusing on characters for which the audience has no attachment, leading to a run of several snooze-worthy episodes in a row.

Sure enough, there are some simplistic action oriented episodes for the kids, and like the second trilogy, Clone Wars seems to gravitate towards politically-driven plots that it simply can't handle.  The West Wing this is not.  Perhaps the most absurd example is a plot in which Mandalorian school children investigate a bribery ring involving dock workers, unscrupulous corporations, and an under-funded Mandalorian Department of Education that wishes to reduce the cost of school lunches.  Even the 30 second summary of this plot is tedious; the full episodes are torture.

However, there are so many gems that the clunkers are worth suffering.  We learn a lot more about the clones and through their devotion to their brothers in arms they become human characters that we are care about, not just the cannon-fodder of the movies.  We see how Anakin is perceived as a war hero and great Jedi, but in hindsight the warning signs are there.  We see the Jedi struggle to adjust to their new role as military leaders and how some embrace it while others have second thoughts.  We learn more about the Sith and their origins.  And we learn more about how the Chancellor / future Emperor is pulling the strings to obtain absolute power through a series of ""democratic"" steps, and how many neutral planets see the Clone Army of the Republic and the Jedi to be just as menacing as the Separatist droids.

Overall, Clone Wars probably won't capture the interest of anyone who is not already a Star Wars fanatic, and even a fan may find the fast forward button to be as irresistible as the Dark Side in certain episodes.  But there are enough great stories here to be worth watching.",1458950400,6,3311,4.7417102966841185

5463924,5,B00APGRMX2,"How could i be so stupid and missed watching this show?  It is soooooooooooooooo good.  When the series came out on tv, i was like meh because it wasn't that appealing because of the prequels.  Then recently, i saw it on a popular streaming service and decided to give a shot.  It gives a lot of background to the clone wars and its not just focused on Anakin, but the republic in general.  The clone troopers are awesome and i like their one liners.
For example, Obi Wan told Capt. Rex to take 2 of his men to go scout.  Rex tells 2 clones to come with him, and one clone said, i guess that means we're the best.  I just cracked up laughing when i heard that.
Then they bring Darth Maul back in the series which made it really interesting.  However, you do have to see Jar Jar binks at times and he can still be pretty annoying.  Luckily he's not in the majority of the episodes.  I also recommend getting the Lost Missions because it's pretty much considered season 6 and it fills in the background on how order 66 was executed.  It also shows Yoda seeking out Qui Gon to commune with him.  After watching this series, it makes the prequels a little bit more enjoyable to watch.  Also, if you haven't checked out Star Wars Rebels, i highly recommend watching that also because some of the characters carry over to that series and Rebels is pretty awesome.  If you are wondering  why i bought the series even though i just streamed it, It's because i travel a lot and i don't always have internet.  Ever since i finished watching the show, i've been craving to watch it again.  Trust me, its worth having in your collection.",1455926400,3,1625,4.3455149501661126

5463930,5,B00APGRMX2,"I have to admit, when I first saw the box for this series (it being animated), I automatically dismissed it as a child's cartoon. I am glad I decided to give it a try. The series is dark and the stories are fun to watch. I wish the creators/writers of this show took over the new live action movies -- I can just picture Ahsoka Tano on the big screen cutting down her opponents with a precision only a jedi could master.

Of course, with so many episodes per season, you will get some duds - particularly those involving Jar Jar Binks. Why they included him, I have no idea, but I will never like that character and wish they left him out entirely.

I find the art in the series a step above the rebels series. The characters have a more serious, dirty look.

Also, the series is violent, and some characters kill without mercy. (Just a warning to anyone looking to get this for a child). If you want a less violent (Disney friendly) version, then Rebels is the show you want.

Quality of the Blu-rays are perfect. Sharp picture and great sound. Everything you would expect from Blu-Ray.

It's a shame Disney killed this series. It was by far one of the best animated series ever made.",1455580800,,1185,4.368181818181818

5463949,5,B00APGRMX2,A must own for any Star Wars fan since after the Disney merge other than the Saga this is the one of the few if not maybe the only pre-merge Star Wars Stories to remain in the new canon. Also for all Rebels fans you get the origin of characters in the show and many more to come I'm sure. Whether or not if you liked the prequels this show is a must own and a reference I used for fans that dislike them.,1453075200,,404,3.8214285714285716
5463950,5,B00APGRMX2,"Taking place between Episode Two and Episode three, the Clone wars does an excellent job detailing the following (but not limited to):

+ Anakin and Obi wan's relationship. There are seldom significant moments in the prequels to highlight their friendship and growth.
+ Anakin and Padme's secret marriage. We've all seen the cheesy(arguably) scenes in two and three. There are many scenes and episodes to show their love and strain of keeping their marriage a secret. You can really feel the darkness start to overcome Anakin as he experiences jealousy, doubt, and conflict of interest.
+ Many wonderful story arcs to add to your understanding of the star wars universe. The story arcs such as saving planets, the clone squad training, the defective clone, light saber construction, slave trade, and darth maul are among my favorites.
+ Ahsoka Tano - Anakin's padawan. She steals the show.
+ The Jedi Order. Are they protectors or peacemakers? Why does Anakin ultimately leave the Jedi Order? A lot of meat to chew on when it comes to understanding the paradox in the Jedi Order.
+ Character building of Anakin, Obi Wan, Padme, Palpatine, Jar Jar (yes),Yoda, Mace Windu, Captain Rex, and R2D2. We think we know them. But this series shows a lot more than meets the eye.
+ Politics of war. There's the republic vs the separatist. But who is good and who is bad? Pirates. Do they only care about money? How about those thousands of neutral planets and systems? Everyone has a stake in this war and their stories paint quite the picture for the clone wars.
+ Bounty Hunters. The introduction of the young Boba Fett.

Animation, voice acting, music, and writing is just phenomenal. You'll probably watch this because you're a star wars fan, but you need not. There are morals and exciting action in every episode. The themes are still very relevant and thought provoking for all ages. Though the Nighsisters might spook your little one.

In my honest opinion, this show does a lot towards justifying Anakin's growing distrust of the Jedi Order and his eventual fall, as well as Anakin himself, both as a Jedi worthy of note and as a character.
It also brings back a lot of minor and major characters throughout the films, such as Darth Maul, Tarkin, Boba Fett, many bounty hunters, and yes, Jar Jar Binks (who, believe it or not isn't all that cringe inducing in TCW).",1447632000,2,611,4.464285714285714

5464002,5,B00APGRMX2,"I love this. This is by far one of my favorite shows. Way better than that piece of crap Star Wars Rebels. I just hate that the clone wars was cancelled.

Story: 10/10. Complete opposite of campy. Each episode is on a different planet, different environment, with different characters. The stories aren't all that kid friendly, which is why I LOVE IT. Much darker toned than even revenge of the sith at times.

Characters: 11/10. More characters than you can count. Get to know all the characters who got about 5 seconds of screen time in the main movies. Plo Koon, Kit Fisto (who has a Jamaican accent which i find humorous), Luminara, Shaak Ti, and many more. You also get to know the clones in their individual legions, like rex, and cody, and many other clones who you get attached to. Get to know the villians. Dooku, grievous, ventress. See darth maul rise again and cause galactic chaos.

Animation: 10/10. The animation wasn't the best in the 1st season, but by the fourth season it had better graphics than any show at the time. Special effects are beautiful, with emphasis on blue glows. Better than the movies tbh.

Voice Acting: 10/10. I could go on about the amazing performances by all the voice actors but that'd take forever. Take my word for it.

Action: 10/10. Better action scenes than the movies. Lightsaber duels can be brief at times but i savor every moment. And they aren't afraid to kill off characters. Seriously more main characters die than in game of thrones. Which again is why I LOVE IT.

Though the clone wars is over all the stories live on. This set is the perfect way to ensure that. Btw this does not include season 6, that is sold separately. You have to buy this.",1442016000,3,1701,4.560655737704918

5464023,5,B00APGRMX2,"If you've never seen Star Wars: The Clone Wars, there is never a better time to start. One of the primary concerns I had when placing this order was, ""how badly damaged will the box housing the DVDs be?"". A normally common problem primarily inflicting the corners of the box, I was happy when I saw there was bubble wrap in the box next to my set. The corners sustained minimal damage (only noticeable if you are actively searching for it). This product was well packaged.

As for the quality of disks:
I encountered no issues playing back any of the disks.
All of the disks are, as described, HD (Blu-ray) quality video and flawless quality sound.

Seasons 1-4 have 3 disks each, while season 5 has 2 disks (season 5 has fewer episodes than the others). I thought it would be annoying having to swap the disks out to continue playing one of the seasons, but it wasn't. Each disk has about 2 to 2.5 hours of episodes on them, so if you binge-watch a whole disk, it is as if you watched an entire movie.

Inside each DVD case for a season, there is a list of episodes, by disk number, as well as a brief description of that episode. If you stop a disk and can't remember the number episode you were on, the descriptions have been sufficient for me to determine where I stopped. Very helpful indeed! The list of episodes is securely fastened between two layers of plastic, so it is protected and cannot move around. The only con to this is that you have to remove disks 1 and 3 to read them on either side, and the design that holds the disks in place does block some of the text, making it harder to read. It has not been a serious problem for me, however, and is not so bad as to warrant dropping this to 4 stars.

For those who are unfamiliar to the Star Wars: The Clone Wars series (you have been missing out!), it is a TV series consisting of 6 seasons. Seasons 1-5 are included in this set, but season six must be purchased independently. Amazon has some DVD / Blu-ray sets available, and it is available digitally as well. If you like what you see here, I would suggest purchasing it.

The series itself takes place between episodes 2 and 3 of the official Star Wars films. Many would agree with me that these episodes are actually better than the films themselves, but you can decide that. The series hosts several major characters, including 2 high-ranking clones, and several recurring minor characters, again including clones. If you want to see jedi, clone, and even droid adventures, this series has it waiting for you! Because there is around 40 hours (including season 6) of episodes taking place at around the same time period, each major and minor character has a very well built character. The clones have memorable personalities. Even the battledroids make comical remarks; they are not just limited to ""roger, roger"" in this series.

Overall, this is something for everybody. Rated PG, this series is aimed at a younger audience, but mature audiences will find just as much fun in watching these well-made episodes. Grab a seat, crack a soda, cook some popcorn, and prepare yourself for a whole new Star Wars adventure in Star Wars: The Clone Wars!",1434326400,118,3166,4.526223776223776

5464063,5,B00APGRMX2,"So glad to have more Star Wars to watch.  We had been watching the 6 ""Star Wars"" movies over and over, then discovered this.

This TV series fills in between the 2nd and 3rd ""Star Wars"" movies.  It starts with a movie, then these 5 seasons, then a 6th season that never aired.

Things I like about these shows, in addition to being more ""Star Wars,"" is that you get to know more characters better and because they are short, we can watch them here and there.

The introductory movie has mixed reviews, but I would highly suggest it because it sets up these shows very well, especially the characters.",1421539200,8,600,4.418181818181818
5464084,5,B00APGRMX2,"Any true Star Wars fan must see this series, including the Lost Missions (Season 6).  It really helps understand how Anakin is the chosen one, gives another side to Mace Windu, and really makes you question the Jedi Order.  Just a few things.  This series gives a different light to Episode III that resonates throughout the rest of the series.",1420156800,,344,4.7

5464088,5,B00APGRMX2,If you are a star wars fan you NEED to watch clone wars from start to finish! it bridges the gaps left between episode 2 and 3 and even  explains some of what takes place between 3 and 4 as well as lets you get to know the clone troopers and the Jedi council much more than the movies allowed. I highly recommend this to any star wars fan. 5/5,1412467200,9,343,3.9
5464089,5,B00APGRMX2,"I was on the fence for the entire run of Clone Wars.  Having never seen an episode I finally decided to pick up all 5 seasons.  Awesome!  They did a great job. I'm almost through season 4 already. Sad that I'm nearing the end, but it will be just in time for Rebels!",1411516800,6,266,3.981132075471698
5464090,4,B00APGRMX2,"love the show only small complaint that moved product down to 4 stars that some of the episodes don't start from the menu, the commentary from the bonus features show instead, but I am able to watch the episode that won't play from menu if I play whole disc or start from the previous episode and fast forward for 30 seconds so its not a real problem",1410912000,3,350,4.2388059701492535
5464091,4,B00APGRMX2,"Excellent Quality , Good price just no spanish or french for language option in it . just a few germanic and scandanavian language . kinda weird for a north american product!",1410739200,,174,4.645161290322581
5464092,5,B00APGRMX2,"This series just got better and better as the series progressed. Season 5 in particular had excellent character development with an intriguing story line - the type of story line so rare in American animation (everything is roses and sunshine within 24 minutes) but instead slightly dark, heart-wrenching with real emotion being dealt with.

the animation also developed nicely over the 5 seasons as did the general production quality. How terribly unfortunate the series has ended, but at least it did end in a good way with an excellent story. I'll miss this, but at least I have 5 seasons to re-visit.

Recommended.",1409961600,,618,4.990291262135922

8555671,5,B00APGRMX2,"There is also a lost (or unaired) or season 6 Bluray set. It too is very good.
 It took me a few episodes to get used to the odd choice of animation. Everyone looks like plastic toys, and with no detail. After I got used to the animation, I loved almost every story. There is a few Stand Alone episodes, but it's mostly 3-4 episode story arcs. A couple so good I still find myself thinking of them and laughing at times.
  It's also great to see Anakin battle enemies with his friend he considers his brother. (Kenobi) as well as a young but great character Ashoka.
Voices are all great, they all sound like you would expect them to. I'd give this 10 stars if possible.
  More Star Wars on TV! Live action too!",1529625600,,710,4.229629629629629

8555673,5,B00APGRMX2,Got this at a great price. It works just fine on the PS4. My kids and I really enjoy watching this series. You really notice all the small details they put into making the series when watching it on blue ray.,1527465600,,208,4.097560975609756

8555675,3,B00APGRMX2,"I enjoy the show though I do get  tired of constant war. What I don't like is the menu system on the blu-ray. The programming has disabled the return to menu button. Once you enter an episode and then decide that you already watched it, you have to resort to skipping ahead, or eject the disk. Horrible.",1526774400,,303,4.315789473684211

I would've given it 5 Stars, but I hate the multi-disc separator panels inside the case.  It was broken and the panel was floating around.  I hate that.  Why cant they come up with better designs!!!

But, the disc was not floating around.  I ended up taking ALL the discs out and putting them in my Amazon Basics DVD/Blu Ray books.  But, for those that don't have these and use the cases, be ware that the cases are poorly designed.",1525564800,,564,4.388349514563107
8555679,5,B00APGRMX2,I hate the Prequels.  I hate them so much I stopped watching anything Star Wars for years.  I got rid of stuff I owned.  I just assumed Star Wars was junk forever and gave up.  Then I had a child and saw Rebels and became a Star Wars zombie once again.  Then I looked and feared Clone Wars.  I wanted more so much but Clone Wars echoed the films that were the crap's crap but eventually I got season one.  It's amazing.  It's so amazing I will happily tell my son that there are the prequels and the Lucas films were just fan films made buy a nutter with a lot of money.  Clone Wars is not just great but a cleansing experience.,1525478400,,628,4.040650406504065
