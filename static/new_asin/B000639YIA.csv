This concert on DVD isn't quite as good as being there, but it is probably the closest I'll get without going to Europe. It's beautifully produced, and Neil Hannon and friends are at the top of their game. The production values are really good, too, and there are some fun extras, such as a short documentary featuring an interview with Neil. Getting to watch a full concert was a treat, and at least gives an idea of what it might be like to be there in person.

Just a caution - though this DVD is advertised as Region 0, as another reviewer said, it won't play on a regular US DVD player. It did play on my Macbook without my having to switch regions.  There were a few glitches, but I was able to see the concert and extras without any interruptions, and it looked and sounded fantastic. I think ideally one should have a region-free DVD player, though.",1369094400,,932,4.32
8037808,5,B000639YIA,"This is not a review of the quality of the product, which, from what I've seen on YouTube, is exceptional: that's why I bought it.  No, despite the product details saying that it is NTSC, IT IS NOT!  And despite it being ""all-region,"" it will NOT play or even read as a disc in any normal US DVD player which has not been modified to play ""all region/PAL.""  I have ordered (through Amazon) such a player (for sixty bucks), and I hope it will play this DVD.  AMAZON PEOPLE: PLEASE CHANGE THE PRODUCT DETAILS TO WARN FUTURE POTENTIAL PURCHASERS! [As I cannot currently watch it, I am basing my rating on the YouTube selections I've seen.]",1282867200,3,636,4.456896551724138
