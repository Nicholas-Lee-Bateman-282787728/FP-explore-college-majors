2121823,5,B0002V7U14,"The other reviews are right.  If you like the Talking Words Factory, you should like this follow-on video.

In this episode, children are taught about long vowel sounds, 'silent E"", blended letters (such as sh and th), as well as blended vowels (the old when two vowels go walking the first one does the talking).

In addition, children are shown how vowels are forced to say their names when E's are added to their ends.  Fat becomes long-A fate, for example.

Worth the money, for sure.  [Certainly my 2.5 year-old would not know his letters and their sounds without these videos.]",1104192000,106,583,4.7227722772277225

2121825,5,B0002V7U14,"We have had this video for two days and the kids have already memorized the songs.  Leapfrog is a great company encorporating fun with learning.  I recommend watching the first two videos first if your child is still learning their letters and letter sounds.

There is now a total of 3 videos on letters and phonics. You must get all three.  The songs are catchy and it makes the concepts lots of fun.  Both my three and half and five year old love to watch them over and over again, but most importantly, they have really absorbed the concepts.

I highly recommend these educational videos.  Leapfrog has truly done it again.",1100822400,13,626,4.585585585585585
2121826,5,B0002V7U14,"Okay - we own a LOT of Leap Frog products.  We've liked the educational value of all their toys, and they've proven to be quite durable as well.

We own the first two Leap Frog DVD's (Letter Factory and Word Factory), and we were excited to see new DVD's come out for it.  Our 3-year old (almost 4) has loved the first two DVD's, so I thought she would like these new ones too.

I went out this morning and bought them at a local store, and she wanted to watch them right away.  We're now on our second viewing of the movie, and she's already starting to sing and dance along with the Frog family.

I really like how the content is explained to the kids, and I know our daughter isn't watching some ""brain numbing"" show on TV.

Bravo Leap Frog!!! Keep up the great work!  I would highly recommend these DVD's to anyone!",1100563200,14,819,4.205128205128205

Tad, Leap and Lily takes children on another exciting adventure to learn about A, E, I, O, U and sometimes Y, the silent ""E"" and how to blend  CH, SH, and TH sounds at the Silent E and Sound Machines. Here the children learn it that the silent ""E"" makes the first vowel say it's ""name"". The Sound Machine shows the children how to make blends and how they sound.

I used it to supplement his Rock N Learn Phonics DVD which were far better teaching material, but not as entertaining.  My son learned more from the Rock N Learn, but enjoyed this one more.  By mixing it up, I kept him interested.  FYI, this video Is a sequal to the Talking Word Factory and covers blends and silent E... but goes pretty fast.  It introduces the concepts, but doesn't really cover and review the material as well as other Leap Frog videos do.",1430956800,,561,4.407766990291262

So in purchasing this DVD I figured it would be great too. And it is! But EVEN BETTER ~ as our kids were watching it the first time, my husband and I looked at each other a couple times and said - ""did you know that?"" Seriously! Apparently we just memorized instead of learning the phonics rules. So this has been helpful for both a 4.5 yr old for learning how to sound out words and for us so we can teach him better.

""  Not having learned phonics myself, it was a new and very interesting!!  Catchy phrases on catchy music, easy to sing!  It helps when I'm doing reading with my 4&7yearolds.  I like ""when two vowels go walking, the first vowel does the talking"".  The kids have been watching this DVD just about everyday.  Also has a game to do with a remote control to test if the kids have understood the DVD.  If they need help, it also gives hints referring back to the DVD!  Then they want to watch it again.  Would recommend to anyone who have already learned the short vowels and consonant sounds .  Japanese don't learn phonics, but if they did, I'm sure it would help to sound out a new word!!  Fun for my kids and was very interesting for me!!",1427414400,,868,4.219512195121951

I would recommend that your child know his alphabet and basic letter sounds first. If they do not, I would first recommend Scout and Friends (which has letters, number, shapes and colors), then Letter Factory (teaches letter sounds) and Word Factory (teaches how to put some 3 letter words together).

It covers the diagraphs with new sounds sh, ch and th in addition to the blends (st and fr, etc.)  covered in TALKING WORDS FACTORY.  Our children have a diagnosis of Autism so visuals are an essential part of their education.  The catchy pleasant tunes also help us remember the rules as we are reading.  As a teacher's daughter I had learned these things as a child but had forgotten them and was struggling to help my children.  These films have helped all of us.  I think it could also be a help to English as a second language learners to help with some of the rules of English.

He has been able to recognize all the letters of the alphabet and say their appropriate sounds for well over a year- thanks to ""The Letter Factory"" and ""the Amazing Alphabet amusement park.""

He hasn't watched this particular one that often ( We've had it a little over a month) but when he does he enjoys it and it keeps his attention.

He sounds each letter out and states the spelling the same way it's done in the video. ""The first vowel says its name when you have a silent 'e' at the end!""

We love to play this (as well as other Leap Frog DVDs) in the car when we go on long drives. My kids like to use their doodle pads to practice along with the show, sometimes long after the DVD is finished!

These are their favorite shows and watch them all the time. They hradly want to watch anything else. We bought another program (your baby can read) but both girls lost interest very quickly.

The songs really help cement the ideas into his head (""When two vowels go a walking, the first one does the talking!"")  Really creative.

However he relates the words to the music and animations. I have pointed to sight words in store advertisements and he knows some of them I think that eventually he will know all of them by watching this DVD. He does not know his ABC's in order but he knows all of the letters when shown randomly and the sounds of most. Leap Frog Teaches this. I will be buying more in this series.

2122330,5,B0002V7U14,"Let me begin by saying that I have all the old Leap Frog DVD's.  I didn't purchase this for myself, since I figured that the same title meant the same video.  I did purchase these for friends with preschool age children. As an early childhood and later an elementary school teacher, I have taught many children how to read.  I have also seen many different videos, books, and other materials meant to aid children in the process that learning to read is.  I have to admit that this video series is simply one of the best phonics learning aids I have encountered in all my years teaching.  I recommend these to parents all the time.  These videos are the very best products ever produced by LeapFrog, and that is saying something since many of their toys are good.  The videos are 30 minutes long and targest basic phonics skills that children must master in order to learn how to read.  The running time for these movies is perfect considering the attention span of the children it targets.  The songs used are catchy, and the story lines are fun for most kids. The crowning jewels of the series are the first three phonics videos.

The Letter Factory teaches children the names and sounds of all the letters in the alphabet.  The vowels are only given their short sounds at this point, but that is ok for this level of learning.

The Talking Words Factory teaches children how to put letters and their sounds together to make simple words, mostly with the consonant-vowel-consonant pattern and a few consonant blends.

The Word Caper movie goes on to introduce silent E, long vowel sounds, and vowel-vowel combinations.

The Math Circus video from this series is also good for children learning their numbers and basic addition/subtraction.

Are these videos enough to teach a child to read?  No.  Will they help a child learn concepts faster and easier? Yes.  Is it a good resource for parents who want to help their children have a head start in their reading instruction or who want to help their children who are struggling with basic phonics?  Definitely.

Learning phonics skills early and well is essential for pre-school and school age children.  When a child struggles it must be addressed immediately, otherwise reading gets harder each grade level and students fall further behind until catching up is almost impossible.  These videos help to set a good foundation for children.  Watching the movies with their children and asking them questions based on the videos can also help parents know what their child should be learning and if they are struggling with these skills.

This video series is highly recommended.

PS  REMEMBER - Look at the title of the movies before purchasing.  This is the re-release of the older video series (You don't mess with a great thing!)  If you have the older DVD's in good working order, then you don't need these titles.  LeapFrog has released some newer videos which you might be interested in.  None are better than these originals though and they do not target the same skills.",1272326400,25,3028,4.7784200385356455

The DVDs not only kept him highly entertained and singing the songs until they 'came out our ears' (German saying, meaning until we got sick of hearing them), but also taught him so quickly how to decipher English words that he caught up to his American-born classmates in no time and now, a year after we have moved back to Germany, STILL reads very well, reminding himself of the rules learned in the DVDs every now and again.

2122429,5,B0002V7U14,"You DO learn something new every day, and this DVD will give you a few days worth.

While visiting the Complex Words Complex with their Dad and the Professor, Leap, Lily and Tad accidentally cause Mr. Websley to lose his voice in the Silent E Machine, and have to solve a word puzzle to get it back for him.

This DVD teaches three lessons in an easy and fun way that will have kids singing along and actually enjoying an educational program.

First of all, we learn about the silent E, visually depicted by a semi-transparent letter E with band-aids across its mouth.  Next, we learn about the sounds CH, SH and TH, and finally, how to pronounce words where two vowels come together.

Of course, given the complexities of the English language, these simple rules don't work in all cases, but your kids will easily grasp the basic concepts.

My one problem is in the opening sequence, where it sounds as if the Professor is incorrectly singing &#8220;the O says Aaaaah&#8221;, but that may be a case of either a strange accent or a bad audio transfer, so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt.

It certainly opened my eyes to a few learning tools, and I would recommend it to the parent or guardian of any child between 2 and 6 years old.

2122431,5,B0002V7U14,"My son has every Leapfrog DVD and they're all *excellent*. Code Word Caper is no different, showing children long vowel sounds, how the silent ""e"" changes a word, vowel blends, etc.

This DVD explains how that although there are 26 letters in the alphabet, there are far more sounds than just 26.

Through an engaging caper at the Complex Word Complex, Tad, Leap and Lily learn about A, E, I, O, U and sometimes Y. At the Silent E Machine, it's explained that the silent ""e"" makes the first vowel say it's ""name"". For example, cap and cape, pet and Pete, hid and hide, hope and hope, cut and cute, dim and dime, not and note. There's a fun song reinforcing this principle with lots of examples.

Then, at the Ch-Sh-Th Sound Machine, the youngsters are shown how to make blends and how they sound, e.g., chin, chat, ship, shop, thin, and think. Using another fun song, children are shown how consonant combos form blends: ""First you take a letter C then you add a letter H--put them both together and a whole new sound you make.""

Lastly, Code Word Capers demonstrates ""vowel teams""...when two vowels are ""stuck"" together. For example, oa, ea, and ie. An excellent song (whose lyrics were once on either Sesame Street or the Electric Company...I remember it as a kid!) says ""When 2 vowels go walking, the first one does the talking"". So the first vowel says its name in a vowel team. E.g. team, tail, leap, pay, pie, goat, boat, bee, and see.

My son really enjoys this DVD and it wasn't long before he was singing the songs around the house! Code Word Caper has helped him read consonant blends, vowel teams, and words with the silent 'e'...the results are very noticeable.

I highly recommend this DVD for children who have mastered short vowel sounds and 3-letter words and are ready to move on to more advanced Phonics.",1140739200,46,1822,4.590769230769231

2122461,5,B0002V7U14,"I have never felt strong enough to actually take the time to write a review.  I am a certified k-6 teacher who has told everyone I know about Leap Frog's 4 amazing movie and now I am telling you...

LF Letter Factory:  This was the first (out of 4) Leap Frog Movie that my children watched.  My 3 1/2 year old and 2 years 2 month old boys are allowed to watch 1 movie a day.  Each Day they agreed, in excitement, to watched this movie.  Under a week my 3 1/2 year old knew his letter sounds. He could sing the letter sound song almost as fast as he could sing the alphabet. After a week, he amazed us when he sat down on the ground and wrote out the entire alphabet like a 4th grader.  Had NO idea he could write like this!  Shortly thereafter, the 2 year old knew all his letter sounds and letter recognition.

Talking Words Factory:  I was so impressed that I bought them the Talking Words Factory that 2nd week.  I wasn't surprised that my 3 1/2 year old began to spell, writing, and sounding out 3 letter words.  He told me all about how the vowels were all sticky and their job was to stick letters together to make words.  He went around singing the vowel song.

My kids loved the videos so much that for 10 months...My son's (who used to play with Thomas the Trains and puppies) were obsessed with letters and words.  They made their own letter and word factory machines out of their toys and tubs, drew each letter cartoon character, and sang the letter and vowel songs, and the older one wrote, yes wrote, many of his own homemade books.

Talking Word Factory 2:  It doesn't stop there...They got the Talking Word Factory 2 and Math Circus when they came out this Christmas. In a couple of days, the now 4 year old, was telling me all about sh, ch, th, and other blends.  He told me how the silent e at the end of the word made the other vowel say its name (long vowel sound).  He went on to tell me also how ""when 2 vowels go walking the first one does the talking."" And he wrote and read new complex words such as, boat, home, dime, wait, etc.  This really increased his ability to read many, many new words - 8 letter words too!

Math Circus:  They loved it too!  Though it is fast moving for beginners, it is entertaining and has an easy concept.  Adding and subtracting now comes pretty easy for my 4 year old.  I gave him a math work sheet for addition and subtraction just for kicks.  Wouldn't you know it, he did all of them with no problem. He was so interested in adding that he started asking about problems such as 3 + 3 + 3.  Which helped him learn the concept of multiplication 3 x 3, 3 x 4, etc.  But, we told him that he had plenty of time to learn that later!

The only negative comments that I have to say about these Leap Frog videos:  Nothing, Oh, except that I wish my children weren't so obsessed with letters!  They eat, breath, and sleep letters.  Sometimes I just wish they would play with the trains, cars, and other toys.  They will have their entire school life to learn about letters and reading!  I just hope that when the time comes for school that they won't have grown board of it!

Other Leap Frog learning tools that reinforce what they learned on the videos:

LF Fridge Phonics Magnets - Love it.  It sings each letters song when you put the letter in the hole.

LF Word Whammer Fridge Phonics Set - LF just came out with this.  I know that they will love.  I bought it for the next birthday!  It is like the Fridge Phonics, but you can spell 3 letter words.

LF Letter Factory Board Game - Love it too!  It is interactive and the board game talks and sings!

LF Sing Along Letters Flash Cards & CD - Songs from the DVDs.  Not that you don't hear the songs sang enough from your children!

Wish they would make computer CD's too!

LF Leap Pad - Fun but they got board with the same books over & over.  $14 a book!

There are many others, but I had to draw the line somewhere!

If you check all the other reviews, I am not alone.  Only two out of 121 people gave this movie less than 5 stars!  It is about time someone made a movie that parents and children both agree on!  Thank you Leap Frog!",1112313600,16,4138,4.159090909090909
