8064313,2,B0009OL93Y,"Dick Merrill really is terrible in it, he delivers his lines as though he were reading them off of badly written cue cards. His co-pilot, Jack Lambie (my uncle) is suprisingly natural except for one scene, not that he had any demanding scenes. Hey, they were pilots, not actors.

The script is bad, but the acting is ... adequate to good. Now I think about it, the acting was pretty good for 1937.",1332720000,,397,4.438356164383562

SYNOPSIS:
Merrill (as transport pilot Dick Bennett) is somewhat peripheral to a love feud between Bill Edwards (Heyburn), designer of the plane Dick will fly in a cup race, and pretty blonde heiress Gale Strong (P. Stone). At an airport coffee shop, Gale overhears Bill make insulting remarks about her. That night at a party he tells her she's a spendthrift, not interested in aviation and afraid to fly. This upsets Gale and she leaves.

Bill later displays jealousy when he finds mechanic 'Pokey' (M. Stone) teaching Gale how to parachute jump. Gale informs Bill that she plans to marry Baron Heygard (Lebedeff) if he wins the air event. What follows is sabotage, a crash and a desperate race to procure a life-saving serum.
