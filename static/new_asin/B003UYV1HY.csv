4207802,4,B003UYV1HY,"I had someone recommend this to me, because I have a hard time sleeping. I find it works wonders...the scenery is so calming and dreamy.  The images of the wine country, and clouds passing overhead, and ocean is beautiful. And after a while, it becomes kind of hypnotic and tranquilizing. It's gotten to the point where when I put it on, within a couple of minutes I find myself getting drowsy and nodding off. Maybe it's just the power of suggestion, or the pacing, whatever. It's very therapeutic, and it works. And it's a healthy alternative to prescriptions. Well worth the money.",1344038400,,584,4.7254901960784315
4207803,5,B003UYV1HY,"Nicely photographed and scored, this video goes all over the universe.  The images were gentle and soothing, beginning with views of the Napa Valley, increasing the AWWWWW factor with a  flock of sheep cuddling together in a sunlit field, maple trees near running water,  rapidly-moving clouds, oceanside dusk-into-darkness, and finishing with a hypnotic view of stars moving rapidly toward the viewer, all to music guaranteed to elicit relaxation. The idea of being able to actually count sheep while going to sleep is amusing but not overdone. Actually, the sheep segment was my favorite part.",1341705600,3,595,5.308510638297872
4207804,1,B003UYV1HY,"waste of money laid awake waiting for results staring at screen, dvd was purchased based on other written reviews, feel free to purchase this dvd as long as you are willing to stare at plants, waterfalls and sheep.",1334275200,,214,4.657894736842105
4207805,5,B003UYV1HY,"I have a horrible time getting to sleep and this video has been the key. I don't really know how it works but I play it on my Kindle Fire with my headphones on and it always puts me right out.  I hardly ever make it to the ocean sounds and I never make it to the stars. I love it, it helps me get out of my head and get to a deep sleep!

I highly recommend it.  I love the little lambs. Instead of me counting them jump over whatever they are supposed to jump over I visualize them chewing with a gentle breeze and the sunshine all around. Somehow it is the most relaxing and calming thing I have ever felt.

Trouble sleeping, get this, it works!",1328745600,4,646,3.9461538461538463
4207806,5,B003UYV1HY,"I love my Deep Sleep DVD. My wife is an insomniac and I bought it for her. And it helped her fall asleep, so I started using it as well. Now we're both hooked. The video is top notch, the nature sounds are relaxing, and the scenes are peaceful and just watching them helps me ease the stress. If you have a hard time sleeping at night like we do, you might do well to give it a try. It's worth every penny I paid.",1278547200,8,413,3.8705882352941177
8406314,5,B003UYV1HY,"I have gotten mostly through the field of flowers, once to the sheep, never beyond that ...  ... And that is amazing to me .. I can lay awake in the dark for hours !!",1466553600,,166,3.742857142857143
8406315,3,B003UYV1HY,"I bought this for my husband who has dementia and has problems staying asleep at night. This is not the product I needed. The music is soft and relaxing, but at the end of the hour it is accompanied by a persistent staccato that sounds like an alarm clock and it woke him up every time. The videos are lovely and calming, but are too light (bright sunny meadows) to be conducive to sleep. The DVD might be effective during the day to calm patients but isn't a help for inducing all night deep sleep.",1457568000,,499,4.2631578947368425
8406316,3,B003UYV1HY,"it's fine, but didn't work for me.",1433894400,,34,4.0
8406317,1,B003UYV1HY,"Lame, highly doubt this was used by hospitals. Unless they were doing tests to try to make ppl go crazy.",1432080000,,104,4.25
8406318,1,B003UYV1HY,This did not help relax me.  After about 10 -15 minutes I was so irritated by it I could have thrown it out the window!!,1429315200,,120,3.8
8406319,4,B003UYV1HY,"good book , it helps to get some sleep and relaxes you,which is a necessity for sleep. Hope this helps.",1380672000,,103,4.2
8406320,2,B003UYV1HY,This is not relaxing and even a bit annoying.  Did not make me feel like I wanted to sleep.  Try the tracks from Steven Halpern.  That music does work.,1377216000,,151,4.137931034482759
8406321,1,B003UYV1HY,it is just an image and h. Music playing in the background. that I can find for free easily. I thought it would be a narrated induced sleep.,1377216000,,140,4.035714285714286
8406322,4,B003UYV1HY,"It's for relaxation...at night presumably. I get that it was designed for people in long-term hospital care, and it's strikingly beautiful but I don't want to adjust my LCD's brightness every time I watch it, either. so I use my blue-light filtering computer glasses, which is kind of annoying. Otherwise, it actually is pretty lulling. Better than watching something crazy on Hulu just before bed at any rate.",1363910400,,410,5.044117647058823
8406323,5,B003UYV1HY,Deep Sleep & Relaxation is truly a wonderful instrument for lulling you into a state of calm. Sometimes my mind is so loud with thoughts I need help to snuff out the noise and I found that this video helps to do that. The music and visuals are so beautiful one cannot help but succumb to the gentle massage of sight and sound which coaxes you into the peaceful bliss of relaxation.,1348272000,,381,4.305555555555555
