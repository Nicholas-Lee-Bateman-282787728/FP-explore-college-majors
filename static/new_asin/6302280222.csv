446966,2,6302280222,"I don't know what most people are thinking when they write a review about this movie saying how ""great"" it is. I thought it was awful, really awful to be exact. Most of the movie is just a copy of the original, the all too worn out tale of friendship blossoming into love. Yes, it was romantic with the FIRST movie but it was pure laziness on the writers and directors part in doing the entire thing over again.
I almost wrote to the people who made the movie and asked them to redo it. It was lazily done and I think, that with a little effort, it could have been much better.
It's not the nudity in the movie that makes it bad and I think people who complain about the nudity are ridiculous since being naked is perfectly natural, for children and adults, we've just grown up in a world where nudity is considered a ""sin"" *ahemreligiouspeopleahem*. :-) What makes this movie terrible is the overused plot and anyone who's seen The Blue Lagoon can tell you that after watching this movie.
I don't reccomend this movie to anyone, if you've seen The Blue Lagoon, just watching The Return to The Blue Lagoon is a waste of your time, it is the exact same thing and poorly made. In short, if the director is reading this I suggest to him to get off his lazy bum and redo and then put some E-F-F-O-R-T into it.",1073779200,3,1305,4.287449392712551
446967,4,6302280222,"The best thing about this movie and worth watching is seeing the very hot Brian Krausse! He has no shirt, very attractive, sadly little nudity for his part of the film. A must if you like looking at Krausse who is a handsome babe!",1066262400,3,230,4.25
446968,5,6302280222,"I did not buy this video but I did watch it on TV. However, it is enough for me to get the moral of the story. If most people will talk about the beauty appearances of the actress and actor or the island and the lagoon, I prefer to look deeper than the skin. This movie proposes us the new meaning of civilized and civilization. While most people think that civilized people come from the high civilization, this movie proves the contrary. From the story, we can conclude that advanced civilization does not always produce civilized society. In fact, the modest, or even somewhat primitive main characters are able to show the real meaning of civilized people; respect and love each other, keep the friendship alive, avoid the actions leading to conflict, and live harmoniously with nature. For us now, would we still consider that the civilized people ALWAYS come from the high civilization? Well, think again and look around you!",1053561600,8,931,4.788819875776397
446969,3,6302280222,"Ok,when compared to the The Blue Lagoon,it looks like Return to the Blue Lagoon doesn't hold up as well, but if you take a closer look the film really is good. It's well acted by Milla Jovovich and Brian Krause. Milla did a beautiful job of pulling it off compared to the wonderful Brooke Shields. And I don't just think this because I LOVE MILLA JOVOVICH. Ok actually i'm a Milla whore. I'm a complete Milla nut. I Love everything that I'v seen her in. This film is uniquely good when looked at in it's own catagory. The tenderness of the love story is handled nicely. It's beautifully shot. The story's interesting even if it is semi recycled from the original. But I believe given a chance,you will really like. If not there's always the original.",1045958400,2,750,4.522058823529412
446970,1,6302280222,"While the original ""Blue Lagoon"" movie was hardly great cinema, this remake of a ""sequel"" is even shlockier, sappier, and cornier than the original... Brian Krause (""Charmed"") is often embarrassing (ie his ongoing antagonism with a shark), but no so much as Mila Jovavich's pouting, simpering delivery.  No doubt popular with the baby-sitting teenybopper set, who most likely find the idea of being shipwrecked on a desert island with a ""cute boy"" the height of romance.  Perhaps they could lobby for a part three starring Britney Spears & Justin Timberlake...",1041206400,5,560,5.211111111111111

447051,2,6302280222,"I bought this after seeing a 47 second trailer and then reading a few 3-5 star reviews which I feel now were not well thought out. I saw a little of the acting of the two main characters, Jovovich and Krause and they are both the worst actors I have ever had the misfortune of seeing. They cannot hold a candle to Chris and Brooke in ""The Blue Lagoon"" of 1984. Krause, the teen boy in the 1991 version is  arrogant, haughty and rude as an actor. I don't like Milla's eyes as they look evil all the time. Maybe that is why all of her recent movies are about evilness which seems to suit her. I can't say too much more about this because I asked for a refund due to technical problems so I did not see all of it or the part where they fall in love and have a baby. It may have gotten better but I can't see that happening from the beginning of the film. I just thought they were both wrong for these parts and should stick to the villian roles they both play in their other movies. This one required sweet and tender innocence which neither of them have.  Oh and right at the beginning there is a scene where a missionary woman murders the boatman sailing with her with a whale hook. It was horrible! Yikes! It was just a mess! I do not recommend this as a sequel to the first wonderful lagoon film. Watch that one and just enjoy the fact that they were taken back to the Island by the father of Richard. That is the way I want to think of it. Enjoy the first one!",1377907200,,1462,4.055363321799308

447163,5,6302280222,"Return to the Blue Lagoon is the 1991 follow-up to the 1981 classic romantic-adventure that starred Brooke Shields and Christopher Atkins. The story takes place after the first lovers passed on and their son survives and is rescued. The boy befriend a nice lady and her young daughter soon after that. When the three survives their sunken boat they are stranded on a tropical, South Pacific island. As the mother dies, leaving the girl and boy alone, the two quickly learn to be self-reliant while being marooned. As the girl and boy matured they developed a deep love for each other and became husband and wife.

However when I started watching it I noticed that some of the scenes had been edited and that the rating had been changed from PG13 to PG.  If it had not been for the editing I would have given this film three stars.  However because it is edited I cannot in good conscience give it more than one star.,1277078400,4,357,4.0
447165,4,6302280222,"Return to the Blue Lagoon was a nice movie with an interesting story line. The movie starts with the the little boy Richard being rescued and a lady aboard the ship taking care of him like she was his mother. Not to long after the women, Richard and her daughter Lilly have to leave the ship because there is a decease on the vessel. Eventually they end up back at Blue Lagoon where Richard remembers his home. Later in the movie the women, who is mother to Lilly, dies from getting sick. Both Lilly and Richard are left then to take of themselves which they do very well.
The thing I found different about this movie from the original is that Lilly and Richard actually meet people on the island from a boat that all of a sudden found its way to their home. This movie is a good movie but the original Blue Lagoon still was the best of the 2.",1247788800,,843,4.209876543209877

447167,2,6302280222,"It took 11 years for a sequal to Blue Lagoon to come out.  Why there would or could ever be a sequal, I don't really know.  The first was more overtly sensual and raw than this one could have been, but, it is, after all, the same movie with different actors.

The son of Richard and Em, RIchard Jr., is rescued at sea when his parents (Christopher Atkins and Brooke Shields) were attempting to leave their island home at the end of the first movie.  Though the rescuing ship crew asks if they were dead when they were found, someone says that they were just sleeping.  When this movie begins at that point, the two are, in fact, dead, but their son Richard Jr. is alive.  The rescuing ship sinks, and a woman with Richard Jr. and her daughter, Lilly, will be marooned on an island in the South Pacific.  The woman dies soon after of illness, and Richard and Lilly are left alone on the island, to relive just what Brooke and Chris did in the first movie.

I wonder why they felt they had to make a sequal to a movie like Blue Lagoon, and if so this was more like a remake rather than the next chapter.  There are not one but two sequals (written by Henry De Vere Stacpoole in 1908, which included the first book, The Blue Lagoon, and the next two, Garden of God and The Gates of Morning).  The next book in the trilogy, as crazy as it may sound, is rather similar to their having Richard Jr. marooned again on the island but there are other things that happen to him rather than just falling for his female companion.  The story continuing is just kind of ridiculous, but then again that's the point isn't it?  I would have liked to see Richard Jr. be taken back to civilization and lead a civilized life.  THAT would be something.  And Richard Jr. and Lilly look just like their predecesors, and have every experience they had.  The only exception to this was the inclusion of the mother figure at the beginning on the island.  Here it was established that they learned some social, language, and survival skills from her, making their long existence on the island alone a little more believable.  Plus there is no suggestion of incest as it was in the first one, and they didn't have to use a fake nude Milla in some scenes.  The actors are HOT, and why wouldn't you want to see some gorgeous people having sex with other gorgeous people?  The innocence they have is rather appealing, but it was done the first time with more impact with the first movie.

Even the scenery wasn't as beuatiful as the first one's, but it was still wonderful.  Who wouldn't want a sandy beach for just a day or two to lounge about on?  And with a handsome man at that.  But it's just fluff.",1185321600,,2673,4.344758064516129
447168,2,6302280222,"I recently rented both of these movies at the same time. Big mistake. Obviously, the sequel was never meant to be seen in the company of the original.

how can a serious screenplay writer ever even think to end the 1st movie one way, and re-write the 2nd move to completely discount that 1st ending?

Given the storyline and the writing of it, you can't blame the actors, but the writers.

Brian Krause and the rest of the cast did a great job with what they had to work with; a badly written storyline with too much of the same thing as the original.

 There was not enough difference in it to make it worth watching.

But I think the movie would have been more fun if they showed us a Richard and Em in San Francisco or wherever they where going to, trying to adjust to life, seeing Richards face when people explained to him that Paddy was his son, because if you didn't noticed, he didn't have a clue about anything.  And then...tatatatannnn Richard and Em return with Paddy to the blue lagoon because honestly they felt like strangers.  Wouldn't that be more fun to watch?  I think it was cruel to kill them. When it was much fun and creative to let them live. Adjust.  The return doesn't even compare.  Even the nude scenes on the first can't be called nudity, is art, because they where beautifully done.

447234,4,6302280222,"I've also seen both Blue Lagoon stories, and like everybody else, was quite concerned with the lack of continuity and form between the two  . . the child was older, the parents were sleeping/dead. . and whatever happened to the loyal dad floating around at sea that found his kids finally sleeping in that little dinghy?

However, I was able to suspend reality and enjoy the second film by altering the first in my own mind.  I have to say that as far as the berries were concerned, I always DID think that Paddy (the baby) had a better chance of survival as he only swallowed a berry or two.  His parents each masticated (chewed) 20 - 25 berries each and swallowed them down.  Much more opportunity for poison to openly enter the blood stream.  But I digress...

The second movie, while not as ""brave"" as the first in terms of ""raw"" sensuality was still quite enjoyable, I thought.  I rather enjoyed the idea of two children who had ""some"" learning from a parent who had adequate time to teach them then left on their own.  It combined a different take than the first film.  In this film, the children have ""some"" idea of the values and mores of European civilization, but have to adapt those values to fit within their own experience.  In the first film, the children were quite simply too young and alone for far too long to really understand much of anything except what they learned on their own.  Because of these differences, I was able to enjoy each film in it's own right.

I think both films are worth a look, but if pressed, I would still have to choose the original as the best of the two . . as originals usually are.",1119398400,17,1630,4.411371237458194
447235,3,6302280222,"I DID enjoy this movie, but I'm glad I watched the original 1980 version first.  The parents are said to be alive in the original, but are just as quickly pronounced dead in the sequel (this is exactly how it happens in the two first books of the Blue Lagoon trilogy).  The boy is taken by a widow and her infant to the very island he grew up on, to escape the Cholera on the boat.  The boy and girl grow, become beautiful, and the mother dies.  Bam!  Now you have two hormonal teenagers alone on an island.  You can guess what happens next.

The movie attempts to ""clean up"" all the dirtiness from the first one.  The only nudity shown is Lilli's (Milla Jovovich), and somewhat briefly at that.  The actors do a better job than Brooke Shields and Chris Atkins did, but that's only because Brooke and Chris weren't all that good in the first place (Milla has done a whole bunch of good films, whereas Brooke is known best for inciting controversy in The Blue Lagoon, Pretty Baby, and her Calvin Klein jeans ads).  I have to admit that the acting was better, and I enjoyed watching the characters interact.  It's a good movie on its own.

447237,3,6302280222,"The first Blue Lagoon was daring and a bit controversial. It showed two children growing up without adults in their lives, growing up without inhibitions, without guidance, and learning some fundamental truths without help. It dared to show full-frontal nudity (carefully!) because that seemed natural. It had the courage to confront things like child birth for child-adults who had no idea of what was going on. That's some of what makes it a classic film, one which holds up even today.

This film, for all that it is a sequel, comes across as a revisionist attempt to ""clean up"" the original. It starts where the previous film left off, with a small boat being seen by a sailing vessel. Unlike the end of the previous film, where all three occupants of the boat are pronounced alive, in this film the parents are dead, and only the child survives. He is taken aboard the sailing vessel and entrusted to the care of a recently widowed woman who has an infant daughter. The woman, Sarah Hargreaves (Lisa Pelikan), and the two children, are cast adrift in a lifeboat a short while later because the ship is infected with cholera (a virtual death sentence for all aboard) - they are cast adrift in the hope they may survive. By pure happenstance (alright, by a piece of not-very-clever script-writing) they happen to arrive at an island that is supposed to look awfully familiar.

This time the children grow up with Sarah to teach them right and wrong, and all about God (she was a missionary), and so forth (all the things that were ""wrong"" in the first version). Eventually Sarah contracts pneumonia and dies, but not before she has time to explain how she'd like to be buried. Time passes and we get to see the new teenagers, Lilli (Milla Jovovich) and Richard (Brian Krause - best known as Leo in the TV show Charmed) doing the same sorts of things as we saw in the first film.

All in all, I cannot recommend this poor-quality remake. Buy the original, certainly, but leave this one sitting on the shelf. Perhaps the one good reason to watch this film is as an object lesson, to see what the original film could have been like, had the makers not taken the risks that they did.",1103068800,41,2182,4.604113110539846
447238,3,6302280222,ok people watch the first movie you will see at the end they are just sleeping when they are found. and in the begining of the second one they are dead???? how do they live in the first one but die in the sequel. and the child paddy was like 2 when they were found. but in return to the blue lagoon he is like 4 and re-named richard. how can the SAME director make two movies that are the same but with such huge differneces? and why now does everyone think that richard adn emmiline die? did they not watch the movie THERE ASLEEP!!!,1101600000,3,533,4.085714285714285
447239,5,6302280222,"I saw both ""The Blue Lagoon"" and ""Return to the Blue Lagoon"" when I was a bit younger, but when I rewatched them I got the same feeling as before.. they are both excellent movies about love and this one is no worse than the first. It's a similar storyline, but it provides a nice twist in the end when the two (now grown) teens are given a chance to return to civilization.
Also, I'd like to comment that in the end of The Blue Lagoon, Em and Richard did die because... the child only had one berrie, which made him go to sleep. But when a person has a lot of those berries (and no, I can't remember the name) then they die. It's like having one sleeping pill as opposed to twenty (which is essentially what Em and Richard did at the end of the first movie).
Also, this movie has much more gorgeous people. Brian Krause can now be found in the WB show Charmed (altho he's not as hot, of course) and Milla is going to be in the upcoming sequel to Resident Evil.. where she (again) fights evil zombie monsters in a sexy red dress and black boots. Wow, she's sexy. anyway... enough of my drooling. This movie is wonderful, I recommend it!",1079222400,4,1135,4.2110091743119265
447240,1,6302280222,When the ship found them they were sleeping not dead the berried made them fall asleep not die!!!!!!!!!! How can they make a sequel did the writers even see the first. Now all these reviews think they die in the orginal.,1074384000,9,220,4.390243902439025

7823416,1,6302280222,"What an incredible disappointment!!  At the end of the first movie, Richard, Emmaline, and Paddy are found alive.  So I was naturally expecting the sequel to pick up from there with the three of them getting rescued and adjusting to life in the civilized world.  But then for some insane reason they changed the ending so that only Paddy survived.  Return opens with Richard and Emmaline being buried at sea.  Then they recreate the first story with Paddy (re-named Richard) getting stranded on the same island with a little girl.  If they wanted to do a remake, why didn't they call it a remake instead of a sequel??",1508457600,,617,4.666666666666667
