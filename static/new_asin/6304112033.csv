7861885,4,6304112033,"MAN! This movie is so terrible but very entertaining at the same time.

The acting was pretty lame, the story is full of cliches, and the ""shootouts"" scenes were badly edited. There are like 3 action scenes in particular, the first two were ""shootouts"" and the final action scene is a long car chase.

As for the positive aspects: The car chase scene was SPECTACULAR! This movie has one of the best car chases ever since The Master Touch or Bullit. Even when the rest of the movie is sooo messed up the car chase is what makes this film so valuable. I also didn't liked the ending but at least it was unpredictable.

If you wanna laugh out loud with a stupid action movie or just watch a SUPERB car chase then this movie is definitively for you! Now, if you want a great crime action movie then you better search somewhere else.",1387324800,2,828,4.363636363636363

Only one was good because four cars were wrecked in the chase.",1294012800,,95,4.588235294117647
7861887,2,6304112033,"Directed by C. Thomas Howell.  Unfortunately this movie will disappoint you if you watch it with the expectation the trailer's convey.  The previews show this movie as an intense action packed movie, but what you actually get is something like the Naked Gun trio but with lots of attitude and intensity.

The comedy element overpowers the intensity thus this movie does not even come off like the Lethal Weapon movie which injected comedy into it's drama/suspence/action.  Again this comes off like Naked Gun with attitude.  Better described: Naked Gun meets Lethal Weapon.  With that in mind, you should find this a good buy/rent if you keep those things in mind.",1066608000,2,664,4.990909090909091
7861888,3,6304112033,"a campy movie that tries to be stylish and action-packed.  the gangster theme sours the whole project.  now, exactly why does becky (teri ann linn) decide she likes johnie (c.t. howell)?  just because he took the fall for  his pals?  it would take monumental acting to make this scene believable!  at least we get to see some of this pretty-eyed beauty, and in tastefully  semi-nude scenes, too!  it's a decent effort, like a good made-for-tv  movie.  teri ann linn should make more movies cause she looks great in a  close-up, her voice is honestly appealing, and she moves with a modern  grace.  leon is excellent to watch, too.",962668800,,630,4.722222222222222
