1804558,5,B00007AJGK,"This Stanley DVD is a favorite of my young kids.  Every episode uses animals to teach a lesson that they can apply in thier own lives.  There is nothing of a questionable nature in any of the the shows I have watched with my kids.  No need to worry that when you walk out of the room, people will start calling each other ""stupid"" or being unkind or doing things that you wouldn't want your kids to do.  I highly recommend anything with Stanley.",1083801600,15,445,4.261904761904762

7974747,5,B00007AJGK,"Everyone is certainly entitled to their opinion, but I have to say that I don't understand the negative review above.  I borrowed this one at the library for my two older kids (ages 4 and 5) and they absolutely love it.  Personally I think it's one of the best combinations of entertainment and educational childrens' series available (for that reason I like Blues Clues a lot too - for younger kids) - the show has led to all kinds of questions the kids have come up with spontaneously e.g. about geography (where is South America, Australia etc.) - so we've studied our globe as a result....and it has helped the kids learn all kinds of neat stuff and terminology about animals.  If I had simply told them these things they would have gone in one ear and out the other, but Stanley has a fun way of being educational ""through the back door"" - I highly recommend this series (we homeschool and so I'm always looking for fun ways to teach the kids).  I'm hoping our library will purchase some more!",1138233600,,998,4.497237569060774
7974748,5,B00007AJGK,We love this movie! We bought it for the 6 hour ride when we were moving this past month and our almost 4 year old LOVES it! It's positive-there's no negativity shown in this show-just positive learning and my son adores Stanley. He told us one morning that anteaters eat more than just ant-something he learned on the show. There's a section on recycling and my son now recycles the newspapers like Stanley. It's fantastic!!!!!!,1121731200,3,429,4.733333333333333
