8310187,4,B00005A05L,"I enjoyed this Playboy production immensely.  It offers an unusual, more casual view of the Playmates as they prepare to appear in a fashion show.  They are friends with each other; play jokes and tease; and are shown in a much more natural setting than is used in most other Playboy videos.  It is a behind-the-scenes setting with candid scenes rather than a scripted production.  If you ever wondered what Playmates are like in real life, this is a good place to get an idea.  This was an entertaining and worthwhile video.",989193600,8,525,4.663043478260869

The video states that it is a fashion show with around twenty eight or twenty nine playmates.  While this is true, most of the playmates you see for only seconds.  Literally only a few seconds.  The video shows clips of the playmates walking up and down the fashion runway.  Most of them look more like whores, than the beautiful woman that they truly are.  They are wearing so much eye make up that they look really trashy.
The DVD contains about twenty or so segments and the main feature is only 48 minutes long.  If you do the math, you can see that each segment is only about two minutes in length.  The segments show the fashion designer, Betsey Johnson, meeting the playmates, talking about the costumes designed for the playmates, and various other segments of her views on fashion.  I have never heard or seen Betsey Johnson, but trust me, she isn't very pleasant to look at.
There are a few very short segments included in the DVD featuring interviews and nudity of the various playmates.  Much of the nudity that is shown are old clips from the playmate's video clip.  The new stuff is just the girls talking about how great it is to be in a fashion show.  Some of the nudity is new, but it is mainly just the girls flashing in front of the camera.  Very tame flashing.
If you would enjoy seeing the playmates dressed up like a bunch of sluts, and see very little nudity, I recommend this video to you.  Otherwise, pass on the purchase of this video.",986947200,17,1669,4.458745874587459
