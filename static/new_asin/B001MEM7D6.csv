8321011,5,B001MEM7D6,"I have used this movie for introducing genetics for several years in my freshmen bio classes. Since the Bill Nye movies are no longer available on YouTube due to copyright, I opted to purchase it so I could continue to use it. It is entertaining, appropriate for short attention spans, informative on an entry level basis, and has some good review questions.",1481846400,,358,4.790322580645161

8321014,4,B001MEM7D6,"Great video but beware that this video cobtains information about AIDS and HIV. Very educational but as a teacher and parent, not sure if necessarily appropriate for younger audiences. I'm not ready for possible parent complaints.",1416182400,,230,5.416666666666667
8321015,5,B001MEM7D6,"I love the 2 day shipping.  Need an idea for a sub quickly.  Wrote my plans on Sunday, used a study guide for the DVD that I found online and got the DVD on Tuesday.  Kids, even 8th graders, love Bill Nye and it had all the basics they needed to start the lesson without me.",1408838400,,274,3.857142857142857

8321018,5,B001MEM7D6,All 45 of my 8th graders watched this episode after lunch and paid attention.  What can I say?  it is a Bill Nye Video.,1364256000,,119,3.9166666666666665
8321019,2,B001MEM7D6,"I remember Bill Nye being very good and he probably still is, but $49 for a 20 minute DVD is absurd.  The folks at Disney need to get a handle on their egos.  I can get a 12 hour lecture series from the Teaching Company for $69.  I love Amazon, but this product is ridiclously over-priced.",1243987200,8,289,4.125
