8163662,4,B000LQF05S,"My husband is a wildland firefighter, so the guy gets some pretty knotted up and sore muscles! I always try to give him a good massage when he comes home after weeks out on the fire line....but I never feel like I'm doing enough. I ordered this dvd and it works! I couldn't even get through the full program the first time before he fell asleep and didn't wake up until the next morning. He loves it!",1442188800,,400,4.207792207792208
8163663,5,B000LQF05S,"This is an exceptionally well done video for someone wanting to learn a bit about massage in order to give a massage to a friend, family member or loved one. While the title is ""couples massage"" there is nothing here that presumes that the pair are lovers, this is simply an excellent video to help a non-professional beginner learn to give a massage to someone they care about. This is not erotic or sexual. Watching this video is like having a professional massage therapist coach you on how to give a simple massage.

The video was created by Tiffany & Gary a husband and wife team, who are professional massage therapists. Their knowledge and care, shines through in the video.

The video is professionally shot & edited. High production values make this a pleasure to watch. The camera angles are right, lighting is right, sound is clear and at appropriate volume.  The voice over instruction is helpful and clear. In short, this is a professionally produced demonstration/short course on how to give a simple massage.

The video course consists of a short introduction, followed by an hour long demonstration of Gary giving Tiffany a massage. The camera follows the Gary's hands, while Tiffany provides the voice over narration explaining what he is doing and why.

The video serves two purposes.  Watch it by itself to learn how, then put it on to play while you are giving your sweetie a massage to help you remember what to do, in what order, and for how long. The one hour video shows you step-by-step how to do a one hour massage.  Basically put the disc in, hit ""play"" and follow along with Gary.

I'm not a professional, merely a husband who has discovered how nice it is to give my bride a massage. This is a great resource for someone like me interested in learning how to pamper my bride.

Highly recommended for beginners. The video is very basic, If you have already learned something about massage, this may be too simple for you. But as a foundation for getting started in massaging your partner, this is outstanding.",1394409600,,2037,4.699438202247191
8163664,5,B000LQF05S,Very clear instructions on beginning massage. My husband & I gave each our massage table for Christmas and we now alternate every weekend giving each other massages!! Wonderfully relaxing and a great way to connect after a hectic week. The menu is great in that you can go to any one body part to practice. We have since taken a 'Couples Massage' class at our local college and gotten even more tips on massage. Would definitely recommend this to anyone interested in learning about giving massages!!,1203292800,,500,4.825581395348837
