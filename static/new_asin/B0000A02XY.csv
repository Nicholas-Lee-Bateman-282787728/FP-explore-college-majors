7994798,3,B0000A02XY,"This was ok for what it was. We paid less than a rental to buy it so it wasn't a complete loss. We didn't know what to expect but once you appreciated that it was a ""making of"" type of show, it grew on you.",1277251200,,206,3.6
7994799,2,B0000A02XY,"My son bought this expecting to see some awesome skating, but instead it is what it says. ""THE MAKING OF"" What a waste. I thought $10 was kind of cheap. Turns out it was about $9 to much! Spend your money on the Gigantic Skatepark Tour video's if you want to be entertained.",1089936000,6,274,4.188679245283019
