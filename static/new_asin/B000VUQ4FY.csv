8220093,5,B000VUQ4FY,This was definitely helpful during my pregnancy.,1478217600,,48,6.0
8220094,5,B000VUQ4FY,"I used these DVDs during my third pregnancy and it was my easiest, happiest pregnancy and birth.  These workouts were easy to do after an exhausting day teaching and helped me unwind.",1419984000,,183,4.71875
8220095,4,B000VUQ4FY,"I am pretty out of shape. In some of the other reviews, I see people commenting that some people think this is too easy. I haven't even done the cardio portion yet because it makes me tired just looking at it - I think I need to work up to it. I have really enjoyed the yoga portion.",1413849600,,283,3.896551724137931
8220096,5,B000VUQ4FY,I love this! I love both the 2nd and 3rd tri videos! Brin can be kind of corny sometimes but what workout video isn't these days? And its funny not annoying! This is not a HARD HARD workout but I am to tired and run down after doing everything else in the day to work out hard. I do this video and did the 2nd trimester one 2xs a week and the yoga sessions at least once a week and walked very other day. My weight is perfect on track! I do watch what I eat but I still have ice cream a few times a week! I am 32 weeks and today my midwife called me thin (in a good way!!!). I am not the thin type I can look at a bagel and gain 3 lbs I have always been like that! To maintain 135lb at 5'2'' before preggo I had to exercise 2 hours a day HARD so I am thrilled with this! I just wish I had started the first trimester with her 1st video! I will also use her videos post-partum! She gives helpful and encouraging info during the workout as well. I tried other preggo workouts and just did not like them. They were to long or did things my Dr. said were big no nos during pregnancy. I have diastisis recti and Brin's videos give you an option for how to do workouts if that is something you have. LOVE IT!,1334188800,,1202,3.850806451612903
8220097,5,B000VUQ4FY,This is a great video! The entire series is very helpful. You can do the workout or just play the yoga section. The instructor does an amazing job of telling what to focus on and how to set yourselfin the correct position. She also give alternate positions for more advanced or beginners. Highly recommended for all moms-to-be!,1309478400,,327,4.754385964912281
8220098,5,B000VUQ4FY,"I really enjoyed having Lindsay Brin's workout during my second and third trimester. My sis, who was due two weeks before me, found it in her local library, and told me how much she liked it. It can be hard finding a workout that is specially designed for prego moms, so I was happy to hear of a good one! I ordered it, and was more than pleased with the actual workout when it arrived. I am now using Lindsay Brin's workout downloads to lose that baby weight!

I liked:
*The three different levels, easy, moderate, and advanced. I coudl just pick the one that felt right that day!
*The streches
*The extra Yoga section
*The price",1307750400,2,630,4.384615384615385
8220099,4,B000VUQ4FY,"Yes, Lindsay is a little cheesy.  Yes, she talks a little too much.  Yes, she's a little off beat and the camera angles are not always on cue.  But we know this about her from her 1st and 2nd trimester videos.  However, her workouts are effective without causing pain.  Some other commenters have complained that her workouts are not ""hard enough"" and ""didn't make them sweat"".  No...that's why it's not called ""cardio calorie blast"" or ""pregnancy bootcamp"".  This is my third pregnancy and my third try at pregnancy videos, and this is the series of videos I will be returning to for any future pregnancies, as well as the video I will recommend to other future moms.  It maintains muscle, elevates the heart a little here and there (without overworking or causing ANY concern for baby's heartrate), and helps you feel like less of a cow.  If the music and talking bother you, mute it and turn on your favorite jams.  After a couple of times watching the video, you know what comes next anyway.  Enjoy",1296691200,3,1002,4.636363636363637
8220100,5,B000VUQ4FY,"I just had my second child 5 weeks ago and really enjoyed doing this workout during my last trimester.  I liked that it included a little bit of cardio as well as toning, even core exercises.  As I got further further along in my pregnancy I was able to do the modified version if I wasn't feeling it that particular day.  There are 3 women representing 3 different levels of difficulty.  On days when I wasn't doing toning exercises there is a yoga section that can be done as a stand alone workout.  I would highly recommend this dvd series, I checked out many prenatal videos and these were the ones I enjoyed and did the most.",1270080000,2,630,4.35042735042735
8220101,5,B000VUQ4FY,"I did this DVD up til' the day I delivered (and I was 12 days overdue).
The yoga is so refreshing, and really helps make the swelling and body changes of pregnancy more tolerable.
The toning and cardio are SO important if you're hoping to get back into a workout routine once that little baby is out!

I really recommend prenatal yoga to ALL of my patients.  It helps the blood flow better to prevent swelling and painful aches.

There are so many prenatal DVD's out there but very few do a cardio and toning segment.  There are plenty of exercises you can do (many involving your upper body) just as well when you're not pregnant.  Take advantage of this time (before you have another thing on your list to distract you).

I'm so glad she splits it into the 3 trimesters as each trimester has different needs for your body.  You won't be sorry if you buy this one!",1270080000,,865,4.36875
8220102,5,B000VUQ4FY,"I started this DVD at 7 months along, because I thought the Second Trimester DVD was pushing me more and I hadn't gotten huge yet.  That was perfect timing for me - because by the time I'd really popped, the stretches and workouts were just enough to keep me motivated without being discouraging, and the muscles and ligaments that get worked in this DVD are exactly what need to be stretched during the Third Trimester.  I've had more than a few babies, and this series has made my current pregnancy the easiest so far, hands down.  (Doing the Boot Camps pre-pregnancy probably helped, too).",1269993600,,592,4.673076923076923
