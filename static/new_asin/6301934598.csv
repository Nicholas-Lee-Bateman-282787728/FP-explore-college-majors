7816940,5,6301934598,This video was such a surprise to find!  It is such a classic!  I enjoyed it and so did my kids!  This version is so much more enjoyable than the cartoon version.. Thank You!,1363219200,,174,4.0588235294117645
7816941,5,6301934598,"I have read the book, seen the play and also various cartoon versions but nothing is as good as this version of this childrens classic.  Suitable for children of any age, it tells the story clearly and in a manner that will inspire awe and requests for repeat viewings!",1054684800,4,269,4.489795918367347
7816942,5,6301934598,"Several people have commented on various versions of The Wind in the Willows, saying stuff like: ""If this is the one I'm thinking of, it's really great.""  Well, this is actually the one.  I know because I ordered it a week or so ago from this link, and now I have it.
This is the one that was made for British tv in 1983 and later generated a tv series, that has wonderful animation done by the Cosgrove Hall fellows, and that has the wonderful voices of Ian Carmichael, Richard Pearson, Michael Hordern, and David Jason as Ratty, Mole, Badger, and the irrepressible Mr. Toad.
Mostly though, this is the one that made my 21-year-old son and my 26-year-old daughter stop as they were wandering past during our screening.  They hadn't seen it in fifteen years or so, but they both remembered it vividly.  And they both asked, ""Can't we watch it from the beginning?""  So we did.  The whole family.
This is also the one that richly deserves a DVD release.  As it is, though, it's like a wonderful family heirloom that's been resting in that dimly-lit closet called ""Remember.""",1032134400,11,1072,4.5811518324607325
7816943,5,6301934598,I Love this movie to death!  I have been trying to find somewhere to buy it in Australia but there has been no luck what so ever. If anyone has a copy please write back in the comments please.,1029715200,,192,3.923076923076923
7816944,5,6301934598,"I am 55 years old and still a kid at heart I guess.  I find Wind in the Willows to be the most delightful, relaxing stories I have ever seen.  If the entire TV series that I first saw on the Disney channel 15 years ago was available I guarantee I would buy it.  As is, the ones that are available are excellant.  Be sure to buy the claymation version (Sir Michael Horndern as Badger) and don't waste time with the typical animation.  The music alone is worth the price of the vidioes.  I only wish they would bring out he entire set on DVD.  This is can't miss stuff.",1003536000,10,567,4.1
7816945,5,6301934598,"In a day and age when children's cartoons are full of violence, it is refreshing to see a children's movie that is peacefull, intelligent, and very enjoyable.  This is one such film, and easily the best adaptation of the wind in the willows you will ever see.  Not only is it completely loyal to Kenneth Graham's story, but the music is beautiful and the animation is absolutely fantastic.  This is a must-have for imaginative kids of all ages.  Enjoy!",972086400,7,452,4.6835443037974684
