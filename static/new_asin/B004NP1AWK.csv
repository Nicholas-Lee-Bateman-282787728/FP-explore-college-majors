8476046,4,B004NP1AWK,"I bought this video for my friend's youngest (3) to get her excited & soothe her nerves before I took her on her first visit to the zoo, (her brother had already been & told her a scary story about the animals escaping).  She loved the video & now loves the zoo, begging to go back every weekend. Needles to say the video gets watched A LOT.  I thought the information went by pretty fast at times but it does hold their attention which can be hard to do. Overall I am satisfied with the purchase & am thinking about getting them the rodeo video next.",1316390400,,551,4.188679245283019
8476047,4,B004NP1AWK,"We really enjoyed this video.  Our 10-year-old was interested in all the facts, and the 3-year-old loved the beautiful shots of zoo animals.  Highly recommended.",1316304000,,161,5.4
8476048,5,B004NP1AWK,"My kids -- ages 5 and 7 -- love this DVD. It grabs and keeps their attention, and I like that they learn so much about animals while enjoying it. It's so much better than your typical cartoon -- fast-paced enough to keep their attention but with a sweet story and top-notch photography.",1304985600,,286,4.415094339622642

It kept their attention the whole time, and they have been talking about their favorite parts of it ever since. Not only did it keep the students engaged, it was fun for me to watch, too! It would make a wonderful addition to any classroom or family home.",1301875200,,426,4.532467532467533
8476052,5,B004NP1AWK,"I showed this video to my third graders. I asked them to take notes on three of the animals shown in the video, which we would later discuss. While the video was playing, I was surprised to see that the students were so engaged in the information that they were taking notes on almost every animal. They totally loved the video and learned so much about animals at the same time! Two to three weeks later, we were talking about animals again, and several of my students referred back to the information they had learned in the video. They remembered the information and were still excited about it. The video is very kid-friendly and very engaging. I can't wait to see the rest of the series!",1301875200,2,692,4.5

I would definitely recommend!",1298332800,,318,4.696428571428571

I even found myself learning new things, and kids can't seem to take their attention away from the screen! I recommend this to anyone with children, or as a great gift for families!!",1298160000,,334,4.677966101694915
