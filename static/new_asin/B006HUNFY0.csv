8498630,5,B006HUNFY0,"Jon ""Bones"" Jones is incredible, he makes an amazing Light Heavyweight Champion, and nobody's even come close to putting a dent in him. Well, the same was once said of Lyoto ""The Dragon"" Machida, and ""Shogun"" Rua finally put him down and out at UFC 113, and that was after a controversial decision where Machida kept his title. Well, Machida finally gets another shot at UFC Gold, but he's got to go through Jones to get it! Is Machida capable of putting a dent of the armor of Jones? This is the Main Event for UFC 140!

Frank Mir and Big Nog were coaches for TUF 8, and they fought at UFC 92, with Mir putting a beat-down on Big Nog, being the first to stop him. Nogueira claims he wasn't 100% going into that one, and that he can easily take out Mir. Will that be the case? A rematch against these 2 is the Co-Main Event.

Not every UFC has impressive stuff. UFC 140, however, is impressive on MANY levels! There are 12 fights on this card, and I will list 'em all for you!!

John Cholish vs. Mitch Clarke: Both of these guys are ready to get our night underway, and they do. Clarke is a wild looking fellow, and Cholish is a man from Wall Street who's had some slick submissions before the Big Show. This is a good scrap, with a 2nd round TKO.

Jake Hecht vs. Rich Attonito: Obviously, Hecht knows how to throw down, and this is his UFC debut. Attonito also has held his own in the UFC, and is always a game opponent. Good stuff, ending with a 2nd round TKO.

Nik Lentz vs. Mark Bocek: When it comes down to it, Bocek has fought a who's who of opponents, and he's tapped a lot of 'em! Lentz has recently gone from being somewhat boring, to not-so-boring, and a FIGHT OF THE NIGHT or 2. Now, this isn't FOTN, but one of these guys does what he has to do to take the unanimous decision.

Walel Watson vs. Yves Jabouin: Both of these guys know how to bring it, but Yves is probably more well-known than Watson. This is a great scrap, and unfortunately, one of them has to lose a split decision. Good fight!

Dennis Hallman vs. John Makdessi: What can you say? Hallman's tapped out the likes of Matt Hughes twice in his career, and going to the ground with him is more than likely stupid. Makdessi's misdirection makes him dangerous, and a tough striker to deal with. But this one hits the ground fast, and somebody is submitted even faster!

Jared Hamman vs. Costa Philippou: I've always enjoyed watching Hamman, just because he can take a punch, and hey, taking out C.B. Dollaway is always a plus in my book. But Costa hits like a truck, and does it rather well. This KO is absolutely BRUTAL, and eventually in the 1st round, finally comes to an end.

Igor Pokrajac vs. Krzysztof Soszynski: You figure this would be a war. Right? WRONG! Somebody gets KO'd in under a minute...WOW!

Mark Hominick vs. Chan Sung Jung: Ok, you figure that THIS would be a war as well. Right??? WRONG! Somebody gets KO'd in under 10 SECONDS in this one, and somebody else gets KNOCK OUT OF THE NIGHT for that KO...DOUBLE WOW!!!

Claude Patrick vs. Brian Ebersole: Both are tough and durable, and both come to bring it each time. This ends in a split decision, and while I don't agree with who won, I can see why it was a split, and that's just the way this one went.

Tito Ortiz vs. Antonio ""L'il Nog"" Rogerio Nogueira: Wouldn't you know it? For the first time in probably a LONG time, Tito gets the same pre-fight interview treatment that everybody else gets. You could expect a dogfight in this one, but one person gets hurt early and slaughtered in a 1st round TKO!

Antonio ""Big Nog"" Rodrigo Nogueira vs. Frank Mir. Ok, lets be honest. Did anybody think that either of these guys would be forced to tap??? Well, one of them is and in the 1st round, and SUBMISSION OF THE NIGHT couldn't be more appropriate for the winner in this one!!!

Jon Jones vs. Lyoto Machida: Hey, Jones finally gets rocked. But hey, he also keeps his belt, and walks away with an impressive 2nd round submission! Way to get 'em, kid!!

See? I told you that this was impressive on many levels! Now, go out and get this, watch it time and time again, and be impressed time and time again. If you aren't impressed by a UFC of this caliber? Then I suppose you can always play Mike Tyson's PUNCH-OUT and see if that helps at all. But I doubt it. This is insanely good, and my eyes practically pop out of my head EVERY time I take this one in!!!",1364515200,,4398,4.3139393939393935
8498631,4,B006HUNFY0,"This was one of the best UFC events of 2011 because of the main event (Jones vs. Machida) and co-main event (Mir vs. ""Minotauro"" Nogueira).  Both fights involved highly technical fighters (Jones and Mir respectively) maintaining their composure during battle, overcoming adversity, and achieving victory.

One could easily argue that Mir executes the most satisfying victory of his MMA career by submitting Nogueira, the most highly decorated Brazilian Jujitsu Heavyweight of all-time.  Jones, on the other hand, shows us why he is a truly great Champion by securing a quick and decisive victory (in the second round) against Machida, an elusive and deadly striker.  A ""must see"" event for UFC fans!",1345334400,,699,5.27027027027027
8498632,5,B006HUNFY0,"It's hard to get a night of better fights than this! The Jones vs Machida, Mir vs Nogueria 2, and Ortiz vs Lil Nog were all worth the price of this dvd alone.",1341100800,,158,3.8181818181818183
8498633,4,B006HUNFY0,"UFC 140 was a good event, no doubt.

But not nearly as epic as some are making it out to be imo. It was very exciting to watch live for sure, but doesn't stand the test of repeated viewings because too many of the fights ended before you could really sink your teeth into them. I prefer an event where at least one of the fights on the main card involves two or three rounds of great action. The only fight that went the distance was a fairly mediocre one between two guys I barely knew and didn't care about. Most of the fights didn't even make it out of the first round.

Plus Frank Murr is the illegitimate son of the Devil and watching him almost get knocked out, only to cum back and break the arm of my beloved Nogueira was more than I could take.

Damn you Murr!

...Damn you to HELL!!!!",1331596800,,794,4.103225806451613
8498634,5,B006HUNFY0,"UFC 140 was an event that I was looking forward to for months ever since I heard Frank Mir would be fighting Nogueira for a second time and luckily the event did not disapoint. This event is a definent must buy for any UFC or MMA fan.

Claude Patrick vs Brian Ebersole  4/5
Tito Ortiz vs Antonio Rogerio Nogueira  5/5
Frank Mir vs Minotauro Nogueira  5/5
Jon Jones vs Lyoto Machida  5/5

Starting with the Prelims the bouts that I watched when they were re-aired during the main card were very good. Soszynski had a nice KO against Pokrajac. Philippou dominated Hamman and landed very acurate clean punches to knockout Hamman in an impressive manor, and Hallman submitted Makdessi with a rear naked choke. All three of these prelims were fun to watch and they all ended in the first round.

As for the main card UFC fans could not wish for a better card.

Chan Sung Jung tied the record for fastest KO in combat sports history with 7 seconds. Todd Duffee was the first fighter to set the record at UFC 102. When I watched the match i looked away for a moment and missed the fight, I was lucky that they replayed the knockout. Very Impressive performance by Chan Sung Jung

Ebersole vs Patrick was a good match when it came down to technique, but it was not a very entertaining fight, Ebersole ended up getting his third UFC victory with a decision over Patrick.

Ortiz came out fast in his third fight this year, in the beggining he seemed to be doing pretty well but Nogueira came back a started to overwelm Ortiz. A great knee by Nogueira to Ortiz's ribs brought him down and it was at that point that Nogueira came in with the ground and pound. Ortiz did what he could to fight back but it wasn't enough, Nogueira ended up getting a TKO against Ortiz.

In the co-main event Frank Mir's victory can be called nothing short of the best submission in UFC history. Mir became the first man to ever make Nogueira submit, and in their first fight back at UFC 92 Mir became the first man to ever score a KO victory against Nogueira. Nogueira landed a few good shots on Mir against the cage and brought Mir to the ground. Nogueira could have finished Mir but he went for a arm to try and submit him. Mir rolled Nogueira into a Kimura and had had his arm bent back so far that you saw Nogueira's shoulder pop just before he tapped. Mir ended up breaking the arm of Nogueira.

For the fourth time this year Jones impressed UFC fans with his submission victory over Machida. In the first round Machida showed some pretty good striking, he even managed to temporarly rock Jones with a few good strikes. The second round is were the match changed. Jones got Machida to the ground and landed an elbow the gave Machida a nice gash above the eye, after the doctors checked it out and the match resumed, Jones got a standing guillotine on Machida while in the guillotine Machida passed out against the cage earning Jones his fourth victory of the year, three of wich were against Light Heavyweight legends.",1324598400,4,3290,4.480737018425461
