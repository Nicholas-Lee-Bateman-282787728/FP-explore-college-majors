6413479,5,B00KBES386,Who doesn't love the Jetsons. Great cartoon fun. Spend an evening watching all the seasons of the Flintstones and the Jetsons with the family and see how good you all feel.,1407456000,,172,4.580645161290323

6413481,5,B00KBES386,"Buy it now to watch the episodes while you wait (probably indefinitely) for the other one to complete your series.  It's always better to be safe than sorry and have a backup plan.  It's a $20 investment - besides you are still getting the vintage cover paper on the DVD holder...which is half the battle...

...of course you could always wait and maybe Netflix will put the series on...yeah, right...",1402617600,3,401,4.7
6413482,5,B00KBES386,Anyone that grew up in the 70s must have the Jetsons as part of their childhood memories. They are still as good to today as when I use to watch them when I was little.,1402531200,3,168,3.8285714285714287
6413483,1,B00KBES386,"I have season 1 and season 2 vol 1 and I would like to get season 2 vol 2 and season 3, Only one problem --IT IS NOT ON PRESS DVDs--!!!! They are on organic dye based DVD-Rs. I will buy it when it is either on pressed DVDs or on Blu-Ray. I might consider getting it if they burn on demand on the M-Disk DVD-R by Millenniata, since it will not deteriorate for 1000 years as regular DVD-R only last for 3-7 years sometimes even sooner. I have stopped buying regular DVD-Rs and only use M-Disc, Now I know my personal pictures, files, and camcorder footage is secure and it will work when I decide to play it. I had 20 DVD-Rs with camcorder video that used to play but it is now a coaster.
Lucky I still have the VHS tapes and recaptured and saved on M-Disk. PS, The VHS tapes still works after 25 or so years while the DVD-R quit working after only 3 years. I would rate it 5 stars for completing the series but 0 stars for the media it is on.",1400976000,15,941,4.01063829787234

8657321,5,B00KBES386,"Loved this as a kid and still do. Glad to get it on DVD and now have the entire series, minus a movie. Clean animation, set in a cute futuristic version of earth with comedy that is 'family' friendly and just pure nostalgia for those of us who grew up watching shows like these. If you are tired of modern days twists on what should be good television, look to the older shows like these. Even my 21 year old and 8 year old, love this series. That should say something about today's television, which we hardly watch due to questionable plot lines and straight up bad formats.",1519776000,,576,4.342592592592593
8657322,5,B00KBES386,"The picture and animation quality is *OUTSTANDING* for a late 1980's cartoon show, as it was one of THE very first animated works to be animated with digital ink-and-paint processes.",1518912000,,182,5.1
