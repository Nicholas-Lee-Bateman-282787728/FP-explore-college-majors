6123255,5,B00GX5SYFO,"This is a wonderful movie. BUT, as much as I'd love to have the DVD, I don't know if my BluRay player will play European DVDs ...

... so do NOT order this DVD unless you are certain that you can play ""Region 2"" DVDs on your computer, on your DVD player or on your BluRay player.

I caught it on THIS TV, one of the free channels that you can receive in many HDTV markets around the country. They aired it twice that I know of, and the movie was so good the first time I watched it, that I put it on my schedule to watch it the next time THIS TV aired it.

Just like in ""Groundhog Day"" -- where our hero had to keep reliving the same day, over and over again, until he learned what he was supposed to learn -- our heroine in this movie discovers that every day is Christmas Eve, where she must deal with obnoxious ex-alumni, figure out why she and her boyfriend separated ten years previously, and must come to grips with what she thinks about her old home town after years in New York City.

At first, she deals with the multiply-repeated events with deliberate humor and negative behaviors, but eventually, she uses the time to improve her skills, deal positively with strangers, and realize what it is that is really important in her life and her future.

As I said above, be sure that you do NOT buy the DVD unless you are certain that you can play ""Region 2"" DVDs.

But if you can play it, get this movie, you'll be glad that you did. It is one that I will watch again in the future. Twice is NOT enough.

I highly recommend this movie, even if you have to find it on cable, on satellite, or as I did it, on your HDTV antenna.",1419292800,4,1631,4.110062893081761
8628251,2,B00GX5SYFO,"I watched this made-for-TV movie today--the day after Christmas!--with my 20-something daughter, who is something of an authority on Lifetime movies. (She doesn't blog, but her analyses of these productions are along the lines of Kacey on her site, [...](By the way, Kacey gave this 4 stars.)

Anyway, WARNING WARNING WARNING ! A major plot spoiler is coming! Proceed at your own risk!!!!!! Don't be like some FB friends who ignore Trigger Warnings and then have meltdowns.

OK, so maybe this isn't a major plot spoiler, because you can probably anticipate most of the plot after the first ten minutes, but watching Christmas movies isn't about character development and shocking storyline twists. It's about a holiday theme with a happy ending.

Unless you're a CAT.

Anyway, this movie is a lightweight ""Groundhog's Day"" with B plus acting and C plus scripting. The main character, Rebecca (Marla Sokoloff) gets fired from her high-salary NYC job. She's a bitter, superficial young woman whose only friend in the world is her CAT. She has a few scenes in the beginning of the movie that involve this CAT, so you kind of think the cat will reappear later on.

Anyway, Rebecca returns to her hometown in California at the urging of her human best friend (who she has kind of blown off for the past decade) who is getting married on Christmas Eve. Rebecca reunites with her mother, who she has also blown off for years, and at the wedding crosses paths with her high school sweetheart--yeah, she blew him off too.

She is only supposed to be gone for a day, presumably having left her cat with a pile of Friskies and a tureen of water.

But, the cab driver (George Wendt) is some sort of Angel Clarence and puts the whammy on Rebecca, and she is forced to relive Christmas Eve over and over and over again until she learns how to be less self-involved and more concerned about others. She repairs her relationship with her mom and rekindles the romance with her heartthrob. She accepts his marriage proposal and escapes the endless loop of her friend's wedding day.

The cab driver reappears intermittently throughout the movie to offer trite advice, but at the end he drives up in his cab. Rebecca announces that she does not, in fact, need a ride to the airport, because she is staying in her hometown and never ever returning to New York!

Then, the cab driver says he has ONE MORE Christmas present for her, and my daughter and I both thought that OF COURSE he would take a pet carrier out of the backseat and that Rebecca would be thrilled to see her cat again!

But no, his last Christmas gift is some sort of lame-o advice that the new, self-aware Rebecca should have figured out anyway.

No mention of the cat. Rebecca had NO friends in New York, so it's not like anyone is going into her apartment to feed it. The poor thing will eventually be reduced to eating whatever it can catch (the apartment is in New York City, after all) and drinking from the toilet bowl.

The cat wasn't even mentioned in the credits.

 Way to go, Rebecca. Have a nice life! Try to take better care of your kids, when you have them!

Merry Christmas!",1482710400,,3136,4.615107913669065

8628253,3,B00GX5SYFO,"I saw A CHRISTMAS WEDDING DATE on the ION channel some time ago and had okay fun watching it. It's not up there with the best holiday TV movies, but it does have the always watchable Marla Sokoloff. She plays Rebecca Wesley who has just engineered a momentous merger between her firm and another firm. Rightfully so, she thinks she's in for a promotion so is completely blindsided when, days away from Christmas, she's terminated, only her jerko boss calls it being ""phased out."" At least her boss gives her a gift bag as a parting token of appreciation. Rebecca glances at the bag and remarks, ""It says, to Barry."" The movie's funniest line comes onces the boss gives Rebecca the properly labeled gift bag, and she leaves, and he gets on the phone, "" Send in Barry."" Heh.

Tune in to CHRISTMAS IN BOSTON to see Sokoloff at her most endearing. Here, it's a chore for a huge chunk of the movie trying to like her. Her character, Rebecca, is one of those people who just can't be bothered, she's so busy, busy, busy, and dismissive of those around her. She's upset that no one would give her a job interview until after the holidays. When she goes back home to Santa Mira, CA to visit her widowed mom (Catherine Hicks) and to attend her friend's wedding on Christmas Eve, she does so grudgingly. On that wedding day, see Rebecca keep on being the neglectful daughter. See her be mean to a cookie-selling girl scout and to the guy offering ice skating lessons. Maybe it's a bit of a comeuppance, then, that she has a perfectly horrid time at the wedding and the reception, what with the catty maid of honor saying harsh things about her and then that same maid of honor throwing herself in the arms of Rebecca's ex-high school sweetheart, Chad (Chris Carmack).

Some time earlier, the cabbie (George Wendt) who dropped her off at her mom's, maybe to atone for nearly causing an accident, gives her a special Christmas ornament, one that, come to find, traps Rebecca into re-living that same wedding day over and over. Says the cabbie, ""When a soul is stuck in a self-destructive cycle, fate will show the way."" She wakes up the morning after Christmas Eve, thinking that horrible business was behind her. But, no.

I can't get enough of these GROUNDHOG DAY type of movies. I've seen the great ones like GROUNDHOG DAY and 12:01 and EDGE OF TOMORROW and good ones like THE TWELVE DATES OF CHRISTMAS and so-so ones like CHRISTMAS EVERY DAY, CHRISTMAS DO-OVER, and I DO, I DO, I DO. I'd plop A CHRISTMAS WEDDING DATE in the last category. It's so-so. Like the other movies I'd listed, this one cribs off GROUNDHOG DAY and isn't subtle about it. And if you hadn't seen GROUNDHOG DAY, maybe you'd be more into the plot. But there's no getting around the laziness of the script and the dishrag quality of the male lead. And, frankly, it's an awkward scene when Rebecca acts so familiarly with people who don't at all remember her (like that employee at the skating rink whom she congratulates for his wife's giving birth). I will say that Rebecca is at her most likable when she realizes that there won't be any lasting consequences and, so, she cuts loose, gobbling down stacks of food, charging her old company's credit card, getting arrested... We know she'll end up being nice to the girl scout. She'll take up ice skating lessons. She'll learn to cook. She'll rekindle her romance with the high school ex. She'll save her friend's wedding from the awful hired musicians.

***SPOILER*** alert now. It's been ten years, four months, three days since Rebecca broke up with Chad on grounds of a rumor that he cheated on her at some party during their 12th grade. From then on, they'd drifted apart, she moving to New York, he to Paris to learn to be a chef. So, it turns out, she never even confronted him. So, what, she just said, ""I'm out, deuces.""? That's dumb motivation especially since the break-up seems to be the linch pin to her becoming such a flawed person. The one person I cared about was Rebecca's long-suffering mom, Shirley, and that's because of Catherine Hicks' restrained performance. So many in the cast decided to go big and broad as their acting choices. Wendt, too, was pretty restrained, which I appreciated. We know her character eventually does break the cycle and wake up to Christmas Day, but does Marla Sokoloff salvage the movie? It depends on how much you are a diehard fan of her. She does have comic chops. Me, I give this one a slightly above average 3 out of 5 stars. She's no Bill Murray, and Chad is no Andie McDowell (but he may be Casper Van Dien). And the set design does somehow make the sunny California backdrop look Christmasy.

As others have mentioned, don't get this DVD unless you have a Region-Free (or is it All-Region?) DVD Player as this is a Region 2 disc.",1480809600,,4800,4.576744186046511

My first clue should have been that it  was being shipped from the UK and took a while to get here.

8628260,5,B00GX5SYFO,"I thought this was a quite enjoyable movie, albeit a ""chick"" flick.  It's a great film for a guy to watch with his honey around the holiday season, although it's not playable in the U.S. on the average DVD/Blu-ray player.  To play it here, you must have a region-free player or know how to re-author a PAL (Region 2) disc using a computer, which I chose to do.  Why this title isn't available domestically baffles me, as ION Television has run the film every year for the past three, but a recording from ION will have ad breaks and ION's logo on the screen throughout the movie.",1426896000,,579,4.392523364485982
