2523219,5,B000EMGF2Q,"Fall of Eagles is another of those wonderful BBC serial dramas from the 1970s, with elaborate costumes, highly literate scripts, and an attention to detail which is rarely found in these less patient times.  In 13 episodes, this is the story of the last sixty years or so of the great Hapsburg, Hohenzollern, and Romanov dynasties.  There is a large cast which includes many faces familiar to fans of Masterpiece Theater in the 1970s and early 1980s.  This series was first shown on the BBC in 1974, then on PBS in the late 1970s, and then in severely edited form on TBS and Bravo in the 1980s.  The episodes tend to be heavy on dialogue and light on action, but the scripts draw heavily from speeches, conversations, letters and diary entries of the various characters, providing an abundance of rich historical detail.

Since it has been so long since the series has been seen in its entirety, here is a brief summary of each episode:

1. Death Waltz.  Dealing with the early years of the marriage of Emperor Franz Josef of Austria and his beautiful young wife Elisabeth, this episode provides a good contrast between the absolutism of the Austrian court and the rise of European  liberalism and the growing nationalism of ethnic groups like the Hungarians.

2. The English Princess. This chronicles the difficulties faced by Victoria, Princess Royal of England.  The eldest daughter of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, Vicky had been raised by her father to be a voice for constitutional government and liberalism.  After Vicky married Frederick, Crown Prince of Prussia in 1858, she clashed repeatedly with the Prussian government over its plans to force the unification of Germany as an absolute monarchy. Very good performance by Curt Jurgens as Otto von Bismarck.

3. The Honest Broker.  Continuing the German story line, this episode focusses on Bismarck after his successful unification efforts, particularly on his alienation of Vicky and Fritz's son Willy from his parents.  After Willy becomes Kaiser William II, he then turns the tables on Bismarck and fires him, allowing for a very nice ""I told you so"" scene between Vicky and Bismarck at the end.

4. Requiem for a Crown Prince.  Returning to Austria, this is the story of the Mayerling tragedy, in which Crown Prince Rudolf first murdered his teenage mistress and then shot himself.  This episode is filmed as a crime drama, with dates and times repeatedly flashing on the screen as we see the murder/suicide first discovered, then covered up.

5. The Last Tsar.  Here we have the story of Nicholas II as a playboy tsarevich who cavorts with a ballerina while courting a shy German princess named Alix.  Nicholas finally convinces Alix to accept his proposals and change her religion to Orthodoxy and her name to Alexandra.  This episode contains one of my favorite lines: When one of Queen Victoria's granddaughters asks if it is a good idea for first cousins to marry each other, the old Queen regally proclaims ""The same blood only adds to the strength!"" (This is a verbatim quote from one of the Queen's letters, by the way.) This episode ends with the death of Tsar Alexander III, Nicholas' father.

6. Absolute Beginners.  This is the least ""royal"" episode.  It concentrates on Lenin's rise to power within the Russian Marxist movement and his creation of the Bolshevik party.  Some of the discussions drag a bit, and its not really clear what divides Bolshevik from Menshevik from Social Democrat from Social Revolutionary, but this episode does give a good idea of Lenin's energy, charm, and utter ruthlessness.

7. Dearest Nicky. Kaiser William II bombards Nicholas II with endless letters of advice and appallingly ugly paintings during the first years of the Tsar's reign. We get a good picture of Nicholas' fatalism and lack of initiative, and of Empress Alexandra's resolve to maintain the absolute monarchy and block any reforms within Russia. The scenes showing Nicholas and Alexandra's misery over their son and heir's hemophilia are particularly well done.

8. The Appointment.  Another Russian story, set in the period after the 1905 Revolution and the establishment of a semi-constitutional monarchy.  The main character is a double agent who simultaneously deals with the revolutionaries and the Tsar and the Empress, weakening reform efforts and increasing the instability. There's a particularly fine scene showing Alexandra interviewing the double agent while an orchestra plays ""I am a Courtier"" from Gilbert and Sullivan.

9. Dress Rehearsal. This deals with the Balkan Crisis of 1908, which nearly started World War I six years early.  The diplomatic machinations and double crosses are well portrayed. There are some nice scenes showing King Edward VII of England visiting Nicholas and Alexandra and otherwise playing a pivotal part in helping to prevent conflict.

10. Indian Summer of an Emperor.  The least well done episode, focussing on Franz Josef in the summer of 1914.  This mainly consists of a series of discussions before and after the Sarajevo assassinations and is meant to illustrate the diplomatic missteps which led to war, but it tends to be tedious.  There are some charming scenes showing Franz Josef with his platonic lady friend Katharina von Schratt, whom he visited every morning for coffee and conversation.

11. Tell the King the Sky is Falling.  The best episode, depicting Russia during World War I as the few competent leaders try to convince Nicholas to make reforms before its too late.  Gregory Rasputin is well played both as lecher and as holy man.  There's a particularly strong performance by Rosalie Crutchley as Grand Duchess Marie Pavlovna, aunt of the Tsar and the most domineering of all the Romanovs.

12. The Secret War.  Here we see the February Revolution that overthrows the Tsar and the subsequent negotiations between various Russian revolutionary/Marxist groups and the German government, leading to Lenin's triumphant return to Russia and his seizure of power in the October Revolution.  Kaiser William II is allowed to be uncharacteristically cautious in warning his ministers not to trust the Bolsheviks.

13. End Game.  The final episode, concentrating on the fall of the German monarchy and the last months of World War I.  The increasing desperation of the German High Command is well depicted.  My favorite scene shows the Kaiser with his wife, talking about their now estranged/dead British and Russian relations, with the German Empress breaking into tears when talking about the Tsar and Empress, saying ""Why did they shoot the children?  They didn't have to shoot the children!"" over and over.

This is a fine series with some excellent moments. If you're not familiar with late nineteenth century/early twentieth century royal European history some of the episodes might be confusing, but history buffs and royal aficionados will enjoy it immensely.",1147305600,379,6904,5.089698046181172
2523220,5,B000EMGF2Q,"A superb historical drama returns at last in DVD format, after going missing for decades. This 10+ hour drama, so beautifully written, is now more than 30 years old, but holds its own against anything of its kind today. Straightforward camera direction, outstanding production values, and a cast of dozens of the finest actors of the day, including Charles Kay, Peter Vaughan, Barry Foster (bringing Kaiser Wilhelm to life in an astounding performance) Michael Bryant, and Patrick Stewart (as the autocratic Lenin!) makes this series well worth having in your video library. A little grainy during the opening credits of a few of the episodes, but generally a good transfer. You'll want to scream at your television to stop the inevitable hurtling toward World War I.

2523221,5,B000EMGF2Q,"I'm writing this question in hopes that someone out there has already seen this soon-to-be-released US version.  Last year, I bought the British version of this DVD, plus a universal DVD player, because the British version wasn't compatible with my first DVD player.  The British version said in very small print that part of one episode about the Romanovs is missing from the BBC's archives and consequently not included on the British DVD.  I was wondering whether the missing footage (I think it was called ""Dearest Nicky"") has now been found, and will it be included on the US release of this fine series?  Like all of you, I watched it many years ago, was enthralled, and am anxious to have the entire series on DVD in Region 1 format.  I just now checked the Amazon.co.uk site, and it says that the total length of the British version is 690 minutes.  The forthcoming USA version quotes 710 minutes, which I'm taking as a good sign, if accurate.  Can anyone out there please verify that the US version will have the complete series with nothing missing, plus hopefully some extra material, such as a ""making-of"" featurette, interviews with cast, etc. ....??  Many thanks for reading such a long message!! :-)",1143072000,18,1214,4.77511961722488
2523222,5,B000EMGF2Q,I saw this many years age and loved it. What makes it great is how it deals with the characters of these people in the context of their time. This is much more then a dry recital of history.  The consequences of the fall of these dynasties defined much of the 20th century,1141776000,13,272,4.132075471698113

I recorded this off our local PBS station when it first aired and was considering copying it to DVD.  Now with the upcoming release I don't have to do that

To me, this is a considerably greater blow than World War II struck, though it caused far more killing.  World War I destroyed a complete societal structure, which, to me, changed for the worse.",1448064000,,583,4.676470588235294

2523228,5,B000EMGF2Q,"Okay, the production here is BBC mid=70's, video and 16mm film, so this isn't a lush set of visual stories, but the series depicts the moral rot of the ruling families of Europe that killed upwards of 100 million people (including WWI and WWII) due to their lack of intelligence, physical debilities, and insistency of their autocracy. Their are standout performances here that should not be ignored.  Patrick Stuart gives us a vivid powerful Lenin who makes his politics clear.  Barry Forster's befuddled, damaged Kaiser Wilhelm tries to bluff his way through the crises that led to WWI, and then force his non-selfware personality to try and stave off the disaster of German loss.  Charles Kay gives us a good Nicholas Romanov, the rather slow-witted last Czar of Russia in tandem with Gail Hunnicut's lively Tzarina.  Some  drawbacks: anti-Semiticism is sometimes addressed, but the Romanov's we're as near single-minded as the Nazi in trying to kill Jews.  In fact, the Czarina took one book with her into captivity, and that was an anti-Semitic tract.  I would have liked to see more of Micheal (Foyle's War) Kitchen's Trotsky here too.  Still, a great introduction in modern European History, and well worth the 13 hours of time it takes to view.  I would watch Reilly: Ace of Spies and Edward the King along with this series to get a broader perspective of how a thousand years of European history devolved into two totalitarian systems that perpetrated the greatest mass murders in history.",1442361600,4,1498,4.96

2523230,5,B000EMGF2Q,"The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) scores BIG!, in this highly anticipated, highly-acclaimed, color, 13-part, 1974, epic, mini-series, as depicted on 4, DVD-disc's. Within this star-studded series which includes, Actors: Michael Kitchen, Patrick Stewart, John Rhys-Davies, Gemma Jones and a host of others, accurately as per the pages of early 20th Century history, chronicles the lives of three, Royal Families. Which... when combined, were the Royal - Ruling Houses of practically, the entire world. Because their global influence was undeniable. Those being: The Hapsburg's of Austria-Hungary, the Romanov's of Russia, who alone - reigned over one-sixth of the world's land mass which included, Alaska. And, the Hobenzollern's of initially 'Little Prussia' and then, the whole of Germany at the height of it's geographic expansion. This superb mini-series is mesmerizing in it's vivid depiction of the true, lavish, opulent and often arrogant, pomp and circumstances and the Royal's 'head-in-the-sand' attitudes towards social reform, the establishments of a Parliament or a Russian Duma, better working conditions and overall, giving the people even a little, of what they wanted. With the exception of the extremely intelligent and very enlightened... Empress Elizabeth of Austria-Hungary, who... despite persistent political objections and even commands from all of those around her, loved and embraced the Hungarian people, anyway. For once, she got over her initial fear of acceptance and doing what was expected of her, she very quickly became her own person and didn't give a damn about what others thought or said, about her. And, in so doing, she changed the course of history. These regal minds that were shaped by tradition, pride, ignorance, haughty indifference and an overall malice towards those within their realm and of those who occupied official positions that were closest to them and made it possible for them to be the monarchs that they were, led to their personal doom and that of their respective kingdoms. And all..., at the expense of the innocent populous within their realm. An arrogant 'sense of entitlement' often leads to self-centered ingratitude. And, because of their vast and diversified influence which culminated in the First World War (1914-1918), literally millions..., needlessly perished. The symbolic dynastic crest of each individual Royal Family was a customized Eagle. So, when their respective reign and kingdoms fell into disgrace and disrepute all because of their stubbornness in refusing to give a listening ear to the people that they presided over, they - as humans, family members, monarchs and on behalf of their realm, bit the dust of destruction which history has recorded. Nevermore, to rise again. Hence, FALL OF EAGLES. Sometimes, even for a sovereign, it does pay to listen and learn. This is a dramatic and compelling drama which focuses on the internal royal mechanics and their indulgent indiscretions, frivolous escapades, utter stupidities, occultic worship of a person, idolatry of their own narrow perceptions, scandalous love affairs, suicide pacts and needless, regimental tradition which was archaic, detrimental and counter-productive. How can one look forward and move in that direction, if one is willfully stuck in yesteryear? This magnificent 13-part, epic, mini-series: FALL OF EAGLES, is as engaging as it is, riveting. It is a revealing, historical and insightful depiction which shows the stark contrast of palatial intrigue, the aristocratic mindset, the wealthy lifestyle and the affluent social 'graces', which at times were nauseating. In comparison too - the impoverished, human factories that were enslaved by starvation, depravity and utter hopelessness. Which consequently for the Royals, made for ripe and ready breeding grounds that were harvested in the manifested forms of rebellion and revolution. And, were further evidenced by a pulpit for the birth of Russian Communism, compliments of an all too willing madman by the name of Vladimir Lenin. This is an outstanding and compelling, mini-series which will historically educate, as well as, entertain you. A colossal television achievement and learning experience. A definite keepsake.

2523234,4,B000EMGF2Q,"An excellent series. I watched it, enthralled, when it was originally broadcast, and was delighted when it was issued on DVD. It is sumptuous, as historically accurate as any such series is likely to be and the acting is generally superb. My reasons for withholding the fifth star are two. First, in typical Hollywood fashion, the cover touts John Rhys-Davies as one of the stars, no doubt because his name is somewhat more familiar to American audiences than many others. However, he only appears VERY briefly, perhaps five or ten minutes, out of a series that runs almost eleven hours! I readily acknowledge that this is a minor complaint. My second is a bit more substantive. While, as previously noted, the acting is almost uniformly high quality, I found Charles Kay's performance as Tsar Nicholas II a bit problematic. Though an inept and clueless monarch, Nicholas had two redeeming qualities from everything I have ever read: he was a devoted family man, and he was consistently gracious and considerate of even the lowest servant with whom he came in contact. Mr. Kay portrays him as utterly humorless, acerbic and even waspish. I would attribute this to the writing and direction were it not for the fact that I have seen other performances by him, and this persona seems rather consistent. Michael Jayston's portrayal in ""Nicholas and Alexandra"" seems more accurate.  Nevertheless, a wonderful series.",1426982400,,1412,5.034188034188034

They make these great European royals come alive as very real (and sadly, very flawed) humans rather than the distant, megalomaniacal autocrats we so often tend to think of them as.  A very young Patrick Stewart puts in a memorable performance as Lenin.  The production value is typical of the rather low-budget look common with BBC productions of the era.  (Anyone who has seen 'The Six  Wives of Henry VIII' will know what I mean; even some of the sets appear to be the same used in that series.)

2523248,4,B000EMGF2Q,"First, I wish it had subtitles. I'm hearing-impaired and I found much of it hard to follow.
Second, I wish it had gone into the causes of the war a little more.
Third, I wish it had gone into the war itself a little more.

Out a a 13-part series, probably 11 parts were devoted to telling us just why these stupid royals so richly deserved the downfall that awaited them. I have no problem with that. But the fact remains that the three dynasties described would probably have gone on for another fifty years or even longer if the war hadn't come along. Most of the buildup had little to do with the war, and most of the action happened off-camera.

I read the book this was based on many years ago but I don't remember it as well as I'd like to. I think this series follows the book fairly well, but apparently it was made on a limited budget so most of the real action happened off-camera; for instance, when the heir to the Austrian throne was killed (the incident that most directly led to the war) that happened off camera and all we get are people's reactions to it. I would have liked to see a little more, although I understand that these miniseries from the 1970s and such were limited as to what they could do on camera. Maybe a remake...

But I waste time being wistful. What's there is very good, and the assembled cast of British character actors is as fine as you'll see: Michael Hordern, Charles Kay, Patrick Stewart and Curt Jurgens to name a few.

Indeed the cast has several members of the ""I Claudius"" gang stepping into the roles of late 19th early 20th century royals and politicians.  Yet for all the prestige and top notch casting, this miniseries left me cold.
The scope is much too long (we begin in the 1850s and end in 1918).  I was hoping for more royal family drama (there was plenty about the royals of this era that was drama worthy) rather than the heavy political back-and-forth from statesmen of the time that make up the dialogue of just about each episode.  My biggest qualm however is the sidelining of the British royal family (we see Queen Victoria exactly two times in the whole miniseries and Edward VII exactly once).  As much as the politics of this time were key to understanding the downfall of these three dynasties (the Habsburgs, Hohenzollerns, and Romanovs) it is too heavy for my taste.  If only the tone was a little lighter, less heavy with the foreboding of dynastic ruin, then it would have really lived up to being a prestige BBC production of the 1970s.",1396051200,,1221,4.655813953488372

And I wish the production itself (lighting, audio) had been better, although I realize that this was filmed a very long time ago and the conversion to DVD may have also affected the visual and audio qualities somewhat.

Overall, I felt it was worth watching, as what the series relates is very interesting and important to understanding the backdrop for the ""great"" wars.  However, those that do not love history may not make it through all the episodes.",1380499200,,794,4.902985074626866

I wanted to know more about the Austrian story line which was ignored after the Prince's suicide (another OVER-dramatized situation including bad acting).

Also, you can't really dramtize this time period without including more detail regarding Britain, France and Belgium.  Story continued to dwell on the Nicholas II & Alexandra saga...which is covered very well in the film ""Nicholas and Alexandra"".

2523279,5,B000EMGF2Q,"Some historians argue, and Winston Churchill is among them, that the two world wars of the twentieth century ought to be viewed as a single conflict, as another Thirty Years War. This is quite wrong.

World War One closed an era. It marked the end of the autocratic rule of the nobility in central Europe, of those born to the position. World War Two by contrast marks the birth of the military industrial complex, of a ruling system in which corporations and their lobbies have unprecedented influence. Today we are familiar with these powerful corporations, but we are not familiar with the aristocratic European ruling families of the nineteenth century.

Fall of Eagles fixes that by dramatizing the story of the political changes in Europe which lead to the war, and to the birth of the Soviet Union. We are shown key episodes in the fall of the imperial houses of Austria, Germany, and Russia; they are the eagles of the title.

Each episode of the 13 part series is self contained but also part of the larger story. We see a young British princess married to the heir to the Prussian throne. We see an Empress grieving at the suicide of her son. We see Bismarck rise, rule, and fall in three stages ranging over twenty five years. We see his inept successors unable to maintain the harmony among the nations of Europe. We see Lenin in the background ready to take the power lost by the Czar.

As usual for a BBC series, the costumes and dialogues are first rate. The production is not as slick as today's high definition shows, but the dialogue and content is more erudite. Patrick Stewart's magnificent portrayal of Lenin deserves special mention.

Commencing in the mid-19th century, this series traces these houses through their demise by the end of the first World War.  A fourth `house' is also studied from its birth pangs, the foundling Bolshevik movement and its creator god, Lenin.

While the subject matter of this series is an excellent examination of a key period in modern European history, the presentation occasionally suffers from poor production values and often ponderous screenplay.  For any student of history though, these latter deficiencies should not be allowed to overshadow the series' overwhelming positive attractions.

I am forced to assign a three star rating as a balance between this program's frequently ponderous presentation and the overall significance and quality of the subject matter.",1317772800,4,977,5.486666666666666

2523285,5,B000EMGF2Q,"In the late 1970s  the local PBS station showed this 1974 BBC production, often showing 2 or 3 episodes during subscription drives.  When I saw it was out on DVD several years ago, I immediately purchased a copy.

The mini-series begins in 1848 when young Franz Joseph becomes Emperor of Austria and ends in early 1919 when Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany finds sanctuary in the Netherlands.  In the 71 years (and 13 DVD hours) between those events Royalty marries (often to the consternation of the older generation), Prussia becomes Germany, Hapsburg Crown Princes die violently, the future Jean Luc Picard spreads revolutionary ideas, the Russian Empire narrowly misses teetering off the edge only to leap off a few episodes later, and there's that whole business about World War I.

The performances are uniformly good, with most royalty suitably petty, full of themselves, and posses absolute confidence in the Divine Right of Kings.  Overall the history is quite good, not perfect, but no really glaring inaccuracies (Pyotr Rachkofsky (whom the mini-series calls Theodore Ratchkovsky) probably wasn't as vital in 1906 as suggested--but as one of history's great 'evil geniuses' it was interesting to see him) .  The attention to detail in the costumes and sets is superb.  However this is a 1974 production so don't expect much in special effects or battle scenes.

It is the interaction between characters that makes this mini-series so great.  When the long put-on-the-shelf Empress Dowager tells the just-fired Bismark ""We dig our own graves, you know."", you feel both the sadness of two people who life has cast aside, as well as the jab Vickie is taking at her old nemesis.

Barry Foster's performance as Wilhelm II deserves special mention.  Foster captures all of the Kaiser's complexities perfectly.  Wilhelm is arrogant, tactless, a loving husband, and overall a competent leader.  His last line at the end of the final episode is a perfect ending.",1300147200,3,1960,5.084375

This program, dating from the early 1970s, ...far exceeds more than three decades of largely vapid television in the quality of its story-telling! The only television mini-series which compares to this in quality, is ""Peter the Great"" from the mid 1980s.

-See how family tragedies and scandals of the house of Hapsburg ultimately ended an empire.

2523288,5,B000EMGF2Q,"""Fall of Eagles"" is, simply put, a miniseries about the march of three dynasties - the Romanovs, the Habsburgs, and the Hohenzollerns - to their annihilation in World War I.  But, it is not a grand inquiry into causation.  Rather, the emphasis is on how the personal lives and decisions of the three imperial families contributed to their own collapse.  This calvacade of crowned heads, however, is offset by episodes where Lenin and Trotsky on the left, Pyotr Ratchkovsky on the right, and people like Sergei Witte, Paul Miliukov, and Georges Clemeanceau are all either trying to balance political extremes and stave off annihilation or actively seeking war and revolution for their own peculiar ends.  The miniseries is therefore a three layer cake of imperial dithering and miscalculation at the top, bureaucratic and military blundering in the middle, and seething discontent from below.  It is a nice snapshot of how the Europeans managed to unmake their world, often without any intention to do so and sometimes exactly with that intent in mind.

Performances throughout are uniformly good, whether they be large or small parts.  And, the film buff will appreciate how the Royal Shakespeare contributed more than a few names to this enterprise.  Indeed, it was very easy for me to forget the actors since they did not engage in significant grandstanding or scenery-chewing in any way divorced from their historical subjects (some of which were none too stable) so nicely did they inhabit their roles.  The writing, overall, is excellent.  And the whole is mercifully free of dramatic music and a continual emphasis on scandals and peccadilloes.  This allows this miniseries to flow like a well-thought history lecture - perhaps a little dry here and there, but no less engaging and thoughtful with heavy empahsis on only what is relevant as opposed to salacious nonsense.  The episode arrangement also allows the viewer to follow along without too much trouble, although the Marxist revolutionary scenes where the discussion revolves around theoretical constructions at the Party Congress could be tedious.  Again, though, even such dryly meaty dialogue is saved by superior ensemble acting headed up by a formidable Patrick Stewart giving a great turn as a younger Lenin.

Since this is a remaster, the viewer might notice that the colors are not as sharp as one might expect.  But this was adapted from a television miniseries of long ago, and the slight dullness and grain to the pictures is to be expected.  I also found that I adjusted to it within just a few minutes without any detriment to viewing pleasure.

Uniforms and sets are faithfully reproduced and contribute mightily to the authentic ""feel"" of the work.

It is true that some historical liberties occur here and there.  For example, Elizabeth of Austria was not in Vienna at the time her son, the Archduke Rudolph, took his own life and that of his lover.  But, the writers and directors obviously took great pains to keep those embellishments to the bare minimum possible, keeping the whole out of the realm of historical fiction.

I also note that the original miniseries aired with a companion book by the same title.  I have a copy, and it is an excellent primer on the European power politics of the pre-1914 world.  But, I do not think such a book is necessary to enjoy the miniseries, although a little back-reading to whose unfamiliar with the subject might enhance overall enjoyment.

""Fall of Eagles"" has its problems, but they pale next to the uniform excellence overall.  A wonderful buy for the history buff, amateur Europeanist, or lover of epic scale miniseries. But, I would add that the price is a bit high, so the prospective purchaser might want to see if the local library has a copy for pre-screening.

2523290,5,B000EMGF2Q,"I can hardly recall when I've viewed a television mini-series on DVD with more pleasure.

The Story: This 1974 BBC mini-series portrays the events and incidents which ultimately sparked off World War I and details much of the horror (as well as the lunacy) of that tragic conflagration, 98% of the focus being on the Europeans and Russia. There's little mention of the late-period U.S. involvement which does not at all take away from this remarkable production.

After 1848, the iron-fisted European Monarchs (chiefly Russia, Prussia/Germany, and the Austrian-Hungarian Empire) began to feel significant pressures to initiate reforms by the people whom they ruled. Great Britain's monarchy had pretty much already lost its legislative power to the country's Prime Minister and Parliament but, especially prior to World War One, the English monarchs were somewhat sympathetic with the European rulers for two reasons:

1. Great Britain's royalty was strongly rooted in Germany.

2. Three of Queen Victoria's grandsons had respectively become (or ultimately became) the rulers of Great Britain (King George V)); Germany (Kaiser ""Willy"" Wilhelm II); and, Russia (Tsar Nicholas II). She also had many other descendants and in-laws sprinkled across the European continent and intermarrying within the family realm was much encouraged. Unfortunately, Queen Victoria sported the hemophilia gene which carried on down to many of her descendants - the stricken females were the ""carriers"" and the males bore the disease.

Due in part to intriguers, old alliances, economic issues, treaties, and outdated philosophies, (but primarily to the outright hubris, power-monging, and stupidity of the involved monarchs), a chain of political events challenged the egos of these autocratic leaders and they all failed to envision the consequences of their bad tempers and collective apathy.

This mini-series particularly hones in upon the human facets of all these national peccadilloes from unfortunate royal successions, to the disastrous Russo-Japanese War, to mishandling insurgent trouble in the Balkans, to the aloofness of the Tsarina Alexandra and her ill-advised partnership with ""starets"" Grigory Rasputin. The chronicle ends with the murder of the Tsar and his family and Russia's Bolshevik Revolution.

As an enthusiastic history buff of this realm and period I'm compelled to remark that the casting throughout the episodes was nothing short of flawless. Here are just a few who will have you convinced that they were the actual characters (in both appearance and mannerism) whom they respectively portrayed:

Charles Kay -- Tsar Nicholas II
Gayle Hunnicutt -- Tsarina Alexandra
Patrick Stewart - Ulyanov (Lenin)
Curt Jrgens -- Otto von Bismarck
Barry Foster - [adult] ""Willy"" (Kaiser Wilhelm II)
Michael Aldridge - Grigory Rasputin

Additionally, these folks were each clearly plugged in to the actual historical personalities whom they played. The volume of research which perceptibly went into this mini-series becomes immediately apparent to the viewer.

The titles of the episodes would tell the prospective buyer very little in regard to what transpired in each one. At the cost of yielding up a lengthy review which some folks will not wish to read, I have appended a brief description to each entry. Many of these fine actors are not listed on the Internet Movie Database [IMDB] website and only a few are named on the product packaging. (I'm hardly an expert on WW I and if I have spoken poorly in describing some of these events, please forgive my unawareness):

1) Death Waltz - [Begins on Disc #1.] A narrator (Michael Hordern, who briefly narrates intermittent spots throughout the series) opens the scene in 1848 describing insurgent activity in the Balkans. Hapsburg Emperor Franz Joseph of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire crushes the ethnic Hungarians who were rioting over the self-rule issue. The Archduchess Sophia (Pamela Brown) expresses open discontent with her son's, Franz Joseph's (Miles Anderson) new wife, Elisabeth (Diane Keen), a young lady who sympathizes with the rebellious Hungarians. [Episode directed by Bill Hays.]

2) The English Princess - The scene opens in London, 1858: Queen Victoria (Perlita Neilson)  and Prince Albert's (Frank Thornton) daughter, ""Vicky"" (Gemma Jones) marries Prussian Prince Frederich ""Fritz"" William (Denis Lil), thereby linking the two monarchies. Vicky gives birth to their son, ""Willy,"" (""young Willy"" being played by Adam Cunliffe.) Prince Albert dies. Conflict arises between Prussia, ruled by Kaiser Wilhelm I (Maurin Denham), and Austria. In 1870, the rising power-baron of Prussia, Otto von Bismark (Curt Jrgens), provokes France into attacking Prussia and the French are ultimately soundly defeated at Sedan. German-Prussian unification moves closer to reality under Bismarck's shrewd guidance. [Episode directed by David Cunliffe.]

3) The Honest Broker - France is left very weak after the war with Prussia - Napoleon III flees to England and France proclaims a Third Republic. Prussia becomes formidable with increasing industrial development. Germany is finally united under the House of Hohenzollern. Princes of the German states gathered at the Versailles Palace's Hall of Mirrors in France to proclaim Wilhelm I of Prussia as Emperor Wilhelm I of the German Empire subsequent to the French capitulation in the Franco-Prussian War. A ""League of Emperors"" is formed: Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph, German Kaiser Wilhelm I, and Tsar Alexander III (Tony Jay.) Bismarck (""The Honest Broker"") had become Chancellor of Germany and ultimately served for two decades. Wilhelm I dies in 1888 but his son Fritz lives only briefly thereafter and then dies of throat cancer - this places an inept and hubristic ""Willy"" in power as Kaiser Wilhelm II, (""adult Willy"" is giftedly played by Barry Foster.) ""Willy"" brashly forces Bismark into retirement. [Episode directed by David Cunliffe.]

4) Requiem for a Crown Prince - This is my personal favorite among all the episodes because it's all about a sex scandal, murder, and suicide within a royal family. This entry also features a bounty of magnificent outdoor scenery. In 1889, the Emperor of Austria-Hungary was Franz Joseph. His son, the liberal and philandering Crown Prince Rudolph committed suicide by blowing his head off with a handgun, shortly after having killed his very young mistress at the royal family's sprawling and elaborate hunting lodge. Franz Joseph (Laurence Naismith) and his wife, the Empress Elisabeth (Rachel Gurney), attempt to suppress the scandal (unsuccessfully) and the Emperor's liberal nephew, Franz Ferdinand, thus becomes the heir apparent to the Austrian-Hungarian Empire. [Episode directed by James Ferman.]

5) The Last Tsar - [Begins on Disc #2.] The episode commences in 1884 under the new reign of Alexander III of Russia. Alexander's son, Nicholas (Charles Kay), carouses throughout St. Petersburg with rowdy friends, lending scant personal attention or concern to the fact that he is the Tsarevich, (heir apparent to the Russian throne.) Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov (a.k.a. ""Lenin,"" played by Patrick Stewart) arrives in St. Petersburg (the ""northern capital"" of Russia), and sets up shop where he meets his future wife, Nadezhda Krupskaya, (Lynn Farleigh.) Nicholas travels to Germany to propose to his princess cousin, Alix of Hesse who becomes the future Tsarina Alexandra (Gayle Hunnicutt). The event manifests a sizeable family reunion of European royals with Queen Victoria (""old"" Queen Victoria is played by Mavis Edwards) at the helm and Kaiser Wilhelm II providing moral support for his anxious cousin, Nicholas. Alexander III dies unexpectedly and Nicholas becomes ""The Last Tsar"" (Nicholas II) to ever rule Russia. At the beginning of this entry, ""young"" Nicholas (at his Grandfather's funeral) is played by John Sanderson. [Episode directed by Bill Hays.]

6) Absolute Beginners - Anarchists, Jews, social revolutionaries, and Marxists all become active in Russia, especially in St. Petersburg. Trotsky (Michael Kitchen) and Lenin meet for the first time. In 1903, (two years before the first Russian Revolution, which failed), the Bolsheviks (majority) and the Mensheviks (minority) part ways over party doctrines at an ""Exile Congress"" held in London. Another key character, Martov, is played by Edward Wilson. [Episode directed by Gareth Davies.]

7) Dearest Nicky - Kaiser ""Willy"" Wilhelm II urges Nicholas II to attack the Japanese over the sticky issue of Japan wanting the Russian military presence eliminated from Port Arthur on the Korean Peninsula. This was a strategic and crucial military and economic Pacific port for Russia. Von Plehve (Bruce Purchase) raises his concerns with the Tsar about dangerous domestic revolutionary activity. Kaiser Wilhelm II provokes the ire of Great Britain as Germany lends naval support to the Tsar and some British fishing boats are misguidedly sunk, having been foolishly mistaken for Japanese war ships. Corrupt Russian officials conspire with Orthodox Church leaders and their minions to repress Russian workers. Von Plehve, who was an inept minister, reviled by most Russians, is assassinated when a bomb is tossed into his carriage. The Tsarevich, Alexis, is born - the child is cursed with hemophilia. Workers gather by the thousands at the Tsar's Winter Palace in a peaceful assembly to present the Tsar with a petition in a plea for basic rights. Soldiers and police fire indiscriminately on the group and the incident becomes known internationally as ""Bloody Sunday"" - the Tsar and the Tsarina remain insensitive to the human carnage. [Episode directed by Bill Hays.]

8) The Appointment - In Russia, Grand Duke Sergius (the Tsar's uncle) is assassinated by revolutionaries. The hard-core Ratchkovsky (Michael Bryant) is subsequently appointed by the Tsar to administer the police force, including the ""Black Band"" secret police. Ratchkovsky allows revolutionary thought and insurrection to blossom. Exiled revolutionaries are thus duped into returning to Russia and Ratchkovsky's Black Band assassins begin killing off key revolutionary leaders. Father Gapon (Kenneth Colley) is bribed to function as a police informant. The Duma (parliament) is formed with Sergei Witte (Freddie Jones) as leader. In 1905, Moscow is stormed by the military to quell worker strikes. As more peaceful conditions prevail the Duma is dissolved by the Tsar. [Episode directed by David Cunliffe.]

9) Dress Rehearsal - [Begins on Disc #3.] 1908: King Edward VII of Great Britain (Derek Francis) meets with his nephew, Nicholas II, aboard the latter's ship, the ""Standart."" Russian Foreign Minister Alexander Isvolsky (Peter Vaughn) commences a diplomatic intrigue: He instigates a pact with Austrian Foreign Minister Aehrenthal (John Moffatt) to help open the Dardanelle Straits (a waterway controlled by Turkey along the Gallipoli Peninsula) to Russian Naval warships. The secret Russian quid pro quo is to involve the abandonment of Russian support for their close allies, the Serbs, as Austria expands its Empire. Isvolsky operates autonomously, neither informing the Tsar or his key ministers of his ill-conceived covert plan. The crushing defeat of Russia by Japan leaves Russia in economic and military ruin. Aehrenthal fleeces Isvolsky into signing a surreptitious deal between Austria and Russia which, when revealed prematurely, sets off a firestorm of rage across Europe as Austria announces its annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Tsar appeals to his cousin, German Emperor Wilhelm II, to intervene with Austria but the Kaiser ultimately supports the annexation. Austria's army stands against Serbia -- Serbian appeals to the Tsar go unanswered. By this final series of international incidents, the World War One battle lines are plainly established. French Foreign Minister Clemenceau is artfully played by John Bennett; Great Britain's Foreign Secretary, Sir Edward Grey, is played by Tom Criddle, and; Frank Middlemass conveys a particularly first-rate performance as the Russian Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Stolypin - Middlemass is also renowned for his inspired performances in both&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crime-Punishment-The-Complete-Miniseries/dp/B0000A5A1L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crime & Punishment - The Complete Miniseries</a>&nbsp;(as Mameladov) and, as General Kutuzov in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/War-Peace-1972/dp/B000QGE86K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">War & Peace (1972)</a>. I also wanted to remark that in this episode, the Tsar and Tsarina's hubristic attitude episode is artfully manifested by the festivities scene on the Standart, where the entire family dances lightheartedly to Chopin's Polonaise in A Major, op. 40 No. 1, ""Military,"" (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chopin-Favorite-Piano-Works/dp/B00000427J/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chopin: Favorite Piano Works</a>) while the masses in St. Petersburg are wretched and starving. [Episode directed by Rudolph Cartier.]

10) Indian Summer of an Emperor - Austrian Emperor Franz Josef, now 84, faces anti-monarch insurgency in Serbia, Romania, Montenegro, and elsewhere throughout his realm. ""Moving pictures"" (films) come to Austria! Crown Prince Franz Ferdinand (Peter Woodthorpe) sets up a farcical ""rabbit hunt"" for his pal Kaiser Wilhelm II (they shoot just released tame rabbits from the rear seat of a luxury car.) ""Willy"" gives him some sage counsel on dealing with the ethnic minorities within the Empire: ""Rule them with an Iron Fist!"" Franz Josef expresses his distaste for Franz Ferdinand's wife, the Archduchess Sophie. Franz Ferdinand and Sophie are assassinated by revolutionaries as they tour Sarajevo, thus making Franz Josef's other nephew, Archduke Karl (Roy McArthur), the heir apparent. Other key characters/actors include T.P. McKenna as Count (General) Conrad von Hotzendorf; Heather Page as the Archduchess Zita (Karl's wife), and; George Merritt as Ketterl (faithful servant to Franz Josef.) This episode would have been much better if they had portrayed an outdoor scene of Franz Ferdinand's assassination but for some reason, this pivotal incident was glossed over and simply referred to in the script by the principal characters. [Episode directed by Donald McWhinnie.]

11) Tell the King the Sky Is Falling - July 29, 1914: Austrian armies attack Belgrade, Serbia. The Serbs plead for help from the Tsar. Russian and German armies both mobilize - Germany declares war on Russia on August 1. On August 3, Germany attacks Belgium and France. Concern for the Tsarevich Alexis's (Piers Flint-Shipman) hemophilia reaches a pinnacle. The Tsar foolishly takes on the job of military Commander-in-Chief and travels south to his headquarters near the front. The Tsarina, who blindly follows the deplorable advice of the incompetent and malicious Interior Minister Alexander Protopopov (Hugh Burden), the witless Madame Vyrubova, and the infamous ""Mad Monk,"" Grigory Rasputin (Michael Aldridge), quickly reduces political matters in St. Petersburg to a shambles. The Duma, led by Mikhail Rodzianko (Charles Gray) is again dissolved. When the malleable and nave Tsar is persuaded to reconvene the Duma, the Tsarina throws a hysterical tantrum and quickly travels to the front to put pressure on her husband to reverse himself yet again. Prime Minister A. F. Trepov (Frank Mills) attempts to bribe Rasputin to turn on the Quixotic Alexander Protopopov but the unsavory Mad Monk refuses - but he accurately predicts to Trepov his own (Rasputin's) imminent death and the fact that the Russian Monarchy will soon fall to the revolutionaries. [Episode directed by David Sullivan Proudfoot.]

12) The Secret War - Kaiser Wilhelm II tires of the war. He is persuaded by his advisors that the eastern front must be promptly eliminated in order to strengthen their forces against France and Great Britain. To that aim, a decision is made to disrupt Russia politically by supporting the Marxist Bolsheviks, a group which opposes the war and is willing to strike a separate peace with the Central Powers. Unrestricted submarine warfare, an idea promoted by Admiral Von Holtzendorf (Alan Cullen), brings the United States into the war on the side of the Allies. Rasputin is murdered. The Duma, agitated by Kerensky (Jim Norton), gains strength. St. Petersburg has been re-named ""Petrograd"" (because the original name sounded ""too German"") - food riots continue there and the Imperial Garrison begins to mutiny, siding with the workers. Dr. Alexander Helphand (Michael Gough) meets with German Chancellor Bethmann-Hollweg (Peter Copley) to make arrangements for Lenin and other revolutionaries to re-enter Russia, from Switzerland, via a train through Germany. Kerensky, a Social Revolutionary Party leader in the Duma, presses to prolong Russia's participation in the war. The Tsar orders the Duma to dissolve and they reject his order. Revolution prevails as Cossacks refuse to follow royal commands. Protopopov is arrested and the Tsar is forced to abdicate by General Ruzski (Esmond Knight.) Lenin arrives in Petrograd to a hero's welcome. [Episode directed by Michael-Lindsay Hogg.]

13) End Game - [Begins on Disc #4.] In October, 1917, Lenin's Bolsheviks seize power in a nationwide coup. They sign a separate peace agreement with Germany in March, 1918, taking Russia out of the war. Austrian Emperor Franz Josef dies and the new Emperor, former Prince Karl, urges Germany to the peace table. Austria's monarchy and its army disintegrate. Former Tsar Nicholas II and his entire family are murdered by the Bolsheviks. (It would have been nice had there been more focus on this appalling incident - it simply rates a minor mention.) In August, 1918, the Germans unsuccessfully launch an attack on their western front against the Allies - Great Britain counter-attacks with large tanks and the German soldiers reel. Kaiser Wilhelm II meets with his military and ministerial staff near the front to discuss terms for an armistice. General Ludendorff (Michael Bates) collapses from exhaustion. German Field Marshall Hindenburg (Marius Goring) remains calm and steers policy. The Kaiser's cousin, Prince Max (Laurence Hardy), is appointed Chancellor of Germany - he forces the radical General Ludendorff to resign with the backing of the Kaiser. Then, Prince Max publicly announces the Kaiser's abdication and while the Kaiser is furious, he's nonetheless powerless to regain his monarchy. Prince Max resigns and hands over the government to the Social Democrat leadership - Hindenburg supports them with the military to restore order throughout the country. Former Kaiser ""Willy"" Wilhelm II flees to Holland and is given refuge at the mansion of Count Bentinck (Kevin Brennan.) I laughed aloud when the director shrewdly injected some clever humor at one point just to lighten the script: The Kaiser is in his last gasp of power, timidly approaching his wife with the subject of their son's illicit love affair with a French widow, and to calm his nerves he hums&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wagner-The-Ride-of-the-Valkyries-Overtures-and-Choruses/dp/B00000AFQY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wagner: The Ride of the Valkyries, Overtures and Choruses</a>. [Episode directed by Rudolph Cartier.]

Some interesting trivia, if you'd like to read most of this fascinating true story in book form (sometimes, word for word) then you can acquire this noteworthy book, originally published in 1967 but now revised:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nicholas-and-Alexandra/dp/0345438310/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nicholas and Alexandra</a>. It's quite helpful to one's comprehension to read the book prior to viewing the mini-series.

Another item, the ""Fall of Eagles"" title refers to the respective monograms of each of the three monarchies (two Central Powers and one Allied Power), Austria-Hungary, Prussia/Germany, and Russia. Each of these insignia features some depiction of an eagle.

Finally, the incidental music for the mini-series was composed by Kenneth Platts. The opening and closing theme, however, is the opening trumpet and orchestral performance of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mahler-Symphony-No-5/dp/B0000041ZH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mahler: Symphony No. 5</a>, a momentous composition completed by the Bohemian born Austrian composer-conductor in 1902 -- it was arguably the most famous of all his symphonies. Ironically, Mahler died in 1911, prior to the start of World War One - but this was certainly a fine selection for characterizing the relevant music central to the location and period of the account.

To summarize, this mini-series comes in double-boxed packaging (very nice) and is conveyed on four discs, the final one featuring a few interviews with one of the episode directors and some key cast members. There's also a ""photo gallery"" on this disc. The aspect ratio (4 x 3) is configured to fill the traditional-type television screen but looks just fine on a widescreen TV too. The clarity of the picture is terrific - all outdoors shots were captured on film and the indoor scenes were shot on videotape. The total running time for the entire mini-series is 10 hours 50 minutes I highly recommend it.",1253232000,10,21511,5.669978267618752

Well things really pick up in subsequent episodes. If you give Eagles a chance, you'll become engrossed.  For history buffs it doesn't get more fascinating than World War I, and this production dives into the details. The actors have to... act! Lenin, the Kaiser and Nicholas are real standouts.

All about greed, power, alliances, breaking apart countries and taking a part of each, etc.  Leave it to the BBC to produce a historical series that takes itself seriously and sticks to the facts, so much so, that my brain was about to explode from trying to keep track of the machinations, the doublecrossing, doubledealing,  lies, etc. that ended up in the loss of millions of innocent lives being lost over nothing except power of nations.  (What else is new?)

2523297,5,B000EMGF2Q,"If you are a history student, or just a history buff, you absolutely MUST watch this.  This excellent docudrama series tells the story of the end of absolute monarchy in Europe at the beginning of the 20th century.  It focuses on the ruling families of Austro-Hungary, Germany, and Russia, and how they ultimately lost power during the First World War.  But it doesn't just focus on the final days of these empires:  The story actually starts in the 1850s, and provides a rich and intimate portrait of these three families as they try to maintain absolute rule over their respective empires in the face of opposition from rising liberal and radical forces.  This is not the sort of dry chronicle of names, dates, battles, etc. that you typically find in history books and historical documentaries.  This is a brilliantly acted dramatic presentation that leaves you with the feeling that you are personally acquainted with each of the historical figures portrayed in this 13-part series -- Emperor Franz Josef, Kaiser Wilhelm II, Tsar Nicholas II, Tsarina Alexandra, Rasputin, Lenin, Trotsky, Bismarck, and many others.  I've studied the history of the events covered in this docudrama; but, after watching this, I feel almost as if I were actually there when these things happened.  I now feel that I really know who these people were, how they lived, what they did, and what drove them.  (And, from now on, whenever I think of Vladimir Lenin, I will picture Patrick Stewart, whose portrayal was masterful.)  Do yourself a favor and watch this series.  You'll be glad you did.",1217980800,8,1576,4.931818181818182
2523298,3,B000EMGF2Q,"This review is written as a corrective to the glowing reviews for a mini-series I mostly enjoyed.
I'm a student of history and found much pleasure in the historical drama to the runup to the collapse of the Hapsburgs in Austria-Hungary, the Romanovs in Russia and the Hohenzollern in Germany. The casual, part-time approach these monarchs used to rule their states, left virtually all the governing to ministries, including the foreign ministries, which led to the conflaguration in 1914, despite correspondence between cousins Nicky (Czar) and Willie (Emperor) with their declarations of peace to each other. The backdrop of the drama is compelling in itself as these three monarchs stumble their way into a vast catastrophic war that becomes their coup-de-gras; the demise of some 15 hundred years of monarchial style rule and political thinking that shortly led to inconceivably violent authoritarian Nazi and Communist regimes.

But the thirteen part series has many disabilities the average viewer will find offputting. The production values are not sub-par; they are amateurish. Thirty five years ago these may have been acceptable but today one cringes at the sight of some of this. Good editing is occassionally lacking, for example a quiet dialogue is jarringly interrupted with blarring music. Video is used to record indoor set scenes whch always belies art; we begin to see behind the art to the production. Additionally, outdoor scenes are suddenly switched to use ""fuzzy"" film(versus all too see-through video). Poorly fashioned graphics are used to depict large scale military and political events (riots and demonstrations): period line sketches quickly panned with dramatic music. Scenes drag as well, such as the opening of the Dress Rehersal episode, where several pointless minutes are taken to wake an aged Franz Joseph out of bed.

First episode, Death Waltz, begins with the Hapsburgs dynasty of Austrian Empire, with the aforementioned production defects plus stilted acting. The Empress dowager, purported to be able to dominate all around, seems no more menacing than an average mother-in-law not the forbidding woman that her son, the Emperor and all else fears. Sisi, the 16 year old ingenue, lacks the charm and innocense that would have captured the heart of an Emperor. Mercifully, we don't see any of these characters when some decades later they've been removed from the picture and Franz Joseph, in need of waking up as mentioned before, is now alone except for a female confidante. Unfortunately, we miss dramatic events with the fatal stabbing of Sisi by an Italian anarchist and the double-suicide of the couples son, Prince Rupert and his mistress in the interim. So the first episode gives an introduction but the characters are left to go nowhere.

The Production is redeemed in the next episode by the dramatic character of Bismark (played by Curt Jurgens), who was responsible, for good or bad, of the creation of modern Germany, fighting first Austria in 1866 and then France in 1870 to secure its existence: we see a most dramatic political character played expertly. Other fine performances, mentioning a few, Lenin (Patrick Stewart), Czarina Alexandria (Gayle Hunnicutt) and Kaiser Wilhelm II (Barry Foster). So overall the acting performances are excellent (excepting the initial episode). Political events are depicted with dramatic insight, especially interesting was Lenin forging the Bolshevik party at the 2nd Social Democratic Party Congress at London in 1903. He's seen as a Robespierre style manipulator, willing to sacrifice everyone to his goal of a revolutionary cadre bent on overthrow of the Czarist regime. Even Trotsky is seen betrayed, later a prominent member of the Communist leadership.

Bottom line the folks behind the production doesn't fully understand the medium of TV or Movies. This is a badly video'd/filmed theatre production of an amazing period of History. Watch and share the tragedy of the fall of several hundred years old monarchies; beware you must look beyond shoddy production.",1214956800,23,4061,5.291472868217054
2523299,5,B000EMGF2Q,"I enjoyed this series very much. Although very old when filmed, the recreation of the period is superb. I was really impressed when from her bedchamber, Empress Sissi views the ""real"" garden and gloriette of Schonnbrun!!!!!! Made my recollections of the place more vivid. Although all the cast is outstanding, for my taste the best is the one who embodies ""Kaiser Wilhelm"". Worth watching it.",1208044800,4,392,5.046153846153846
2523300,5,B000EMGF2Q,"I have always liked European history, and the issue of the fall of the royal dynasties is a very important aspect. When you consider that, for instance, the House of Habsburg was not only part of history, but ""made"" history for 800 years, you can realize how important this issue is. It is not only liking to see kings and emperors, but to understand that said men and women were the last rulers of centuries-long dynasties.

When I first saw these series, it was 1976, in Chile, in a very good Spanish translation. I was a child. I still remember several scenes, which now I have been able to remember watching these DVDs again. One, very comical, is when, during the Russian-Japanese War of 1905, Russia was contemplating to buy Chilean battleships (Chile was an important South Pacific power at that time). One of the ministers says ""I did not know Chile had a navy"". The Russians did not buy our ships, but the Japanese bought at least one, which fought the war with a Japanese name.

The whole series well deserves the 5 stars. The quality of the acting is superb. We must understand that this BBC series was more theatrical than big production. And the economical resourses for filming were probably not high. But the representation of the spirit of the time is great. This series fills in a blank, because as far as I know, there are no historical pictures dealing with most of these historical events.

Obviously you can always have prefered less of some aspects, and more of other one. But this series is what you seen, and you must take it as a whole, and admire it as such. I would have ommitted two chapters on Russia, one regarding Lenin and the other regarding the secret police. On the other hand, I would have included the death of emperor Franz Joseph and also the collapse of emperor's Karl ""Doppelmonarchie"". Also, probably the assasination of the Czar and his family (though probably the producers tried to avoid such a brutal episode).  But it is only my opinion. As a whole, the work is monumental.

Regarding the acting, when I first ""Fall of Eagles"" in 1976, the great actor was obviously Curd Jrgens, who, incidentally was perhaps the best-well known international star of the series. His portrayal of Otto von Bismarck is really cinematrographic, and moreover, he looks exactly like BIsmarck. The producers were able to reproduce all his manners and cloth, even his boots. Now it has come to the attention of the public that Patrick Stewart had an important part as Lenin, and, moreover, in the advertising of this DVD series he appears as a very important face. That is certainly because he is now a very well known star. In 1976 probably ha was not so important. His acting, at least for me, is excellent. He believes being Lenin.

Other very good aspect of the series is the sense of continuity. Even though it is made up of separate episodes, which are not really connected one with other (there is no ""To be continued ..."" at the end of each episode), and often in different directing styles, always the same actors return to their imperial characters. You can see de year-long development of Emperor Franz Joseph's political wisdom, the egocentric though carismatic personality of Kaiser William II (which, was also a modern ruler, conducted well the economical progress of his country and implemented important social reforms), the eternal weakness and lack of political view of Czar Nicholas II, the honourable but negative personality of Empress Alexandra, the political skills of Bismarck to reach a political goal for his monarch and how he lived his triumphs and also his dismissal, etc., etc. You live history, you come to know and love the characters (even if you are critical to most of them).

Now, we must take also into consideration the bad aspects of this DVD set. These comments does not refer to the series, but to the DVD presentation. It seems that the chapters were not remastered. Probably there were no good original masters. But the images have notorious stripes several times, the photography does not seem clear enough (probably it was a problem of the original English productions of that time), the sound is not very good (I had to put it at a high level). And, there are no subtitles. I would have prefered at least subtitles in English, because, at least for me, I must concentrate well in the English dialogue in order not to lose a line. With bad sound, you must rise the volume too high. On the other hand, if the subtitles were in another language, for instance Spanish, it might bring many other viewers, for instance my Children and my wife.

But, in spite of these shortcomings of the presentation, this work is monumental. It deserves to be in any good library. Probably in the future a better remasterization will come, but for the next coming years, what now we have is a must for history lovers.",1207440000,7,4866,4.716470588235294

2523304,5,B000EMGF2Q,"I must admit I am a history fan so this series of 13 episodes of Fall of Eagles was a treat for me. There is little action and much dialogue but the dialogue teaches the history in a personal and appealing manner. Much of the script was taken from actual diaries and historic documents, so an intimate picture of the times is obtained.

The overall theme of the entire production is one of incredible social revolution as an entire era and conceptualization of mankind violently disintegrates into the horror of World War I. At the beginning of the series in the 1860s, the old world was organized by ancient dynastic empires ruled by despotism and the entire populations who bought into the concept of divine right. The lack of economic and social reform - particularly in the area of democratic representative and constitutional government - begins to create a growing tension which eventually lead to chaos, war, revolution, and then reform. Pity that reform did not come sooner in the chain of events.  The lack of adaptive leadership in the privileged ruling families gradually moves all of Europe into the disaster of World War I which lead to the downfall of three Empires but also tragically killed a large percentage of Europe's young men, fighting in a conflict created by an outdated geo-political system with failed diplomacy. If there is a fault with the series it lies in not contrasting the stupidity and arrogant privilege of the ruling families to the incredible hardships and terror of death and disease experienced by ordinary citizens in World War I. The contrasts are drawn between the Romanovs, the Hapsburgs, and the Hohenzollerns as compared to an approach that might have contrasted those in privilege against those who suffer the consequences of that privilege.

The episodes on the Hapsburgs of Austria-Hungary depict a highly conservative ceremony obsessed Emperor Franz-Josef slowly deteriorating and losing control. His brother Maximillian attempts to become Emperor of Mexico but is killed in the revolution. His mentally unbalanced son, Crown Prince Rudolf kills his teen age lover and then himself in the family hunting lodge. His flighty dramatic wife, Elisabeth is stabbed and killed by anarchist. Then his nephew, Crown Prince Franz-Ferdinand and his wife Sofia are assassinated in Sarajevo, an event that sparks World War I. The events of history are shown to be far more than this overly rigid man can endure and the defeat of Austria in World War I marks the end of the Hapsburg empire.

Alexander III, a conservative dictator Tsar, is assassinated and his son Nicholas Romanov becomes Tsar. Nicholas was a man who loved women, his wife, his children, but was woefully unprepared for leadership responsibilities of this magnitude.  Russia fights a foolish war with Japan in which they lose almost their entire Navy. President Teddy Roosevelt won the Nobel Peace Prize for brokering the peace between Russia and Japan. The country is left without adequate reserves or resources but is drawn into World War I because of alliance with the Serbians, a country unwisely annexed by the Austrians. Nicholas could barely manage his religious fanatic wife, Alexandria, more less the disastrous diplomacy of Europe drifting toward war. A family man at heart, Nicholas is pulled between the conservative force of Alexandria and her religious advisor, Rasputin, and the rise of the Dumas, a ray of democratic light in the Russian darkness.  The defeat in World War I by troops personally lead by the Tsar along with a collapsing economy, brought about the rise of Lenin and the Bolskyviks and the overthrow of the Romanov dynasty.

Prince Albert's bright progressive daughter Vicki runs into a stone wall in the character of Otto von Bismarck.  Vicki and Crown Prince Frederick are sidelined by Bismarck and the old king while Bismarck moves Germany toward the height of European power. Unfortunately progressive Frederick dies and all this power falls to Kaiser Wilhelm II, a fascinating study in intellectual and personality flaws of the highest order. Kaiser Wilhelm II is possibly the most interesting character in the series. The tragedy of Nicholas and Alexandria revolves around small intellects and conservative beliefs that could not cope with the hemophilia of their son Alex while trying to rule a giant backward country falling apart at the seems. Wilhelm II by contrast is a small mind with ego-maniacal over-compensation tendencies paired with total lack of personal reflection or reality testing.

The characters of Nicholas II, Alexandria, and Wilhelm II were superbly played and brought this tragedy to life.  The entire series gains momentum so that the final two episodes reveal the tragedy that gradually builds throughout the series.",1195603200,4,4781,5.133676092544987
2523305,5,B000EMGF2Q,"Many persons write and ask if this DVD has subtitles, closed captions or has Spanish dubbing. I am writing to inform every buyer the following things that I have learned after I bought this DVD
1-This series has NO SUBTITLES NOR IS CLOSED-CAPTIONED.
2-The spoken language is ENGLISH and no one else.
3-The actors, as everyone is aware are ALL BRITISH, so the english spoken is the BRITISH ENGLISH, very pleasant to the ear of the persons who are habituated to it, but not for everyone.
4-Many times I had to rewind and hear again what the actors were saying because the plot is so full of subtleties that if you lose a phrase or even a word you may not understand what is happening.
5-Pay attention to the names and if you are interested, anote them. They are German, Russian, French and other different names that you may not recognized at once. A tip: In the end of each episode, the names are displayed with the name of the actor that played the role. The nicknames also are hard to get: Nicky is Nicholas, the Tzar, Willy is Willhem II, the Kaiser, Vicky is the mother of the Kaiser, Alex is the Tzarina, and so on. Pay attention because they are all cousins and they call each other by their nicknames!
Well, these are the drawbacks. If you love a really good series about the 19th century that is one of the best I have ever seen. Even seeing the same episode (there are 13!) twice to understand the plot, I have enjoyed immensely the series. Patrick Stewart as Lenin is unforgettable. The other names of the cast are unknown but magnificent! I would say: Buy this series. Be patient. Hear carefully and rewind if necessary. It is worthwhile. But BBC COULD release this masterpiece at least with closed captions as they did with Henry the Eight and Elizabeth R, other superb series that EVERYONE SHOULD SEE.

2523306,2,B000EMGF2Q,"It's hard to explain the central idea behind this 1974 BBC miniseries, which points right away to the general problem: there's just too much here to cover and make it cohere together adequately. The basic idea was to show key events in the lives of the main figures of three great imperial dynasties of nineteenth-century Europe--Hapsburg, Hohenzollern, and Romanov--and show how all three marched towards their own downfall in the first World War, where all three nations they represented were pitted in battle in part due to their own failings. Well over 65 years of history is covered, and most episodes center upon one particularly dynasty, which makes for quite a lot of hopscotching from one period and one court to another. Making things even more confusing is that the producers decided to devote considerable space (including an entire episode!) to the early careers of Vladimir Lenin and his wife, which doesn't fit in at all. (The Lenin episode, by the distinguished playwright Trevor Griffiths, seems like part of a different miniseries altogether.) There are guiding ideas, however, that tend to help hold things together: one is that the liberals in these empires, such as the Austrian Empress Elisabeth of Bavaria and the German Empress Victoria of the United Kingdom, tended to be squashed down by the reactionary forces of their courts hoping to hold on to power as tightly as possible. Another is that the tendency for the heirs to the throne to be forced to marry foreign princesses for reasons of snobbery and potential blood alliance tended to exacerbate tensions in their marriages and breed suspicion among the people towards their foreign empresses. While these are interesting observations, they hardly help to make this giant mishmash of incidents cohere. The whole thing seems too loose and fragmentary, and it's often quite hard to keep track of who's who unless you're really up on your royal, military, and political nineteenth-century European history.

Usually these long historical BBC miniseries are worth seeing just for the superb performances, and there is particularly excellent work from Barry Fosters as the headstrong and strutting Kaiser Wilhelm II, Curt Jurgens as the splenetic and politically ruthless (but surprisingly personally kindly) Otto von Bismarck, and Gayle Hunnicutt as the fanatical Russian Empress Alexandra of Hesse-Darmstadt, who becomes more and more scarily unhinged as the series progresses. Be warned, however, that there are also a surprising number of mediocre performances, and an awful lot of British stage actors who are far too fond of dramatically trilling their ""R"" sounds (Rachel Gurney, Charles Gray, and Freddie Jones are among the worst offenders, and Patrick Stewart, as the young Lenin, does tend to be pretty overripe here himself.) There are also perhaps really great dramatic scenes of the kind that these sorts of series usually feature at their heart: there's only one, of the new Kaiser Wilhelm II marching in to his parents' palace with his troops, to the disgust of his mother, just moments after his father has died in order to impound their letters and personal papers, that's as dramatically memorable as some of the best scenes from ""I, Claudius"" or even ""The First Churchills."" But the series does have great costumes and palace interiors, and several superb British and European stately homes beautifully double for the great palaces of the various dynasties.",1192233600,12,3451,5.195691202872531

2523308,5,B000EMGF2Q,"Fall of Eagles is an excellent series, the type of work the BBC and Masterpiece Theatre is best known for. The performances are first rate: especially Patrick Stewart as Lenin (driven, ruthless) and Barry Foster as Kaiser Wilhelm II (pompous, self-deluded). These two performances alone are worth the price of the box set - they are the ones that all others should be measured against.

I have to disagree with another reviewer's opinion of Wilhelm's father, Kaiser Frederick. He was not weak - he was a principled man of integrity who unfortunately came up against Bismarck and lost. Fritz and Vicky were high-minded liberals who wanted better living and working conditions for their people. Unfortunately, while they 'played the game' honorably, their opponents did not - so they were chewed up and spit out by the existing power structure.

I spent some time in Vienna last summer and visited the Sisi Museum - Empress Elizabeth as she is shown in the first and fourth episodes. Someone said that Sisi was Austria's Princess Diana - different time frame, but beautiful young woman almost crushed by the royal system who dies tragically. Go look her up - in some paintings, she has a Liv Tyler look, in others, she sort of looks like Julia Roberts.

Russia's Nicholas and Alexandra are rightly portrayed as flawed personalities who can't stay out of their own way. One sees the inevitability of SOME other system - ANY other system - taking over in Russia.

There's a screen on the third DVD of a conversation between Germany's Kaiser Wilhelm II and Austria Crown Prince Franz Ferdinand which is almost comical - the haughty/clueless talking to the haughty/clueless. Ironically, Wilhelm comes off as the MORE level-headed of the two. If this portrayal of Franz Ferdinand is anywhere near the truth (and I'm inclined to think it is, based on the truthfulness of the rest of the series), perhaps Europe was better off without Franz Ferdinand, although, of course, his assassination in Sarajevo was the trigger to the bloodiest war in history, WWI. This scene shows that Europe might have been worse off had he lived.

Another reviewer mentioned something about Queen Victoria and Prince Albert being the only contemporary monarchs who saw their position and duty as a public trust. After watching this series, you will no longer wonder why the others - Romanov, Hapsburg, and Hohenzollern - all fell apart. The leaders of Russia, Austria, and Germany are shown for what they were - dull (not just unintelligent but BORING), limited men and women who can't help but bungle their way into WWI.",1182124800,7,2591,4.93348623853211
2523309,5,B000EMGF2Q,"I write this review as a person who is not knowledgeable about world history.  Anything involving military history always goes way over my head.  That's why I absolutely love this miniseries, and rate it at the all-time top of my personal list.

Whether or not it's all historically accurate or not, I can't say.  But I have such a greater interest in this part of world history than before.  It also is a joy to see wonderful acting, beautiful sets, beautiful costumes, all without a single word of profanity, no explicit sex, and only ""historical"" violence (via documentary footage) from WWI and ""discussions,"" not re-enactments or visuals on the assassinations!

This is a wonderful miniseries for families with children above 12 years of age to watch together and learn something together.

A final plus is to see a younger Patrick Stewart as Vladmir Lenin!

2523310,3,B000EMGF2Q,"FALL OF EAGLES is a dramatization of the personal histories of Emperor Franz Joseph II & Empress Elizabeth; Emperor Frederich III and Victoria of Prussia, the Emperor Wilhelm II of Prussia, and Tsar Nicholas and Alexandra of Russia.  It covers the time period of 1855-1918.

For the history ""buff"", there is realistically scripted dialogue which is culled from various letters and biographies of the historical personages depicted here.  Yet, there are inaccurate interpretations (no doubt misinterpreted for television-dramatic purposes, but even so, really annoying).  These historical misrepresentations are, for example:  the writers depict Queen Victoria as being supportive of the marriage between Princess Alix of Hesse and the Tsarvich Nicholas (when in fact she dreaded and opposed it), and, after the death of Tsar Alexander III, Grand Duchess Serge (Ella) telling Alix to go home and to marry Nicholas later, because the Russian people would consider it bad luck that she came to be Tsarina after a funeral.

And then again, in ""Death Waltz"" (the dramatization of the early married life of Francis Joseph and Elizabeth of Austria) you have Franz Joseph being angry because Elizabeth gave birth to two daughters before they had a son.  Which, who knows, maybe he was secretly disappointed and/or worried but I've never read in any source I've consulted about their marriage that he was really FURIOUS at the birth of each daughter (the way he's depicted here - actually yelling with rage), or, that he thought they would never have a son.  I didn't think enough of Francis Joseph's loving fascination with Elizabeth was depicted.  In the teleplay he came across as a fairly rotten husband, cheating on her from the beginning (another mistaken interpretation - he was unfaithful at later times but not in the beginning of their marriage).

All the performances, however, are first rate, really A+, typical of most British productions.  Pamela Brown gives a perfect performance as Duchess Sophie, the mother of Franz Joseph.  Patrick Stewart makes a particularly cold and calculating Lenin, a wonderful performance.  And I love Rachel Gurney as the Empress Elizabeth (in later years).  The production values; the hairstyles and period clothing, are excellent.  None of the stories are in the least boring or draggy, but it could be said that the narrated bits (by Michael Hordern) are a little stodgy.  Overall, for a television production from 1974, it looks great, and all the stories are invariably interesting, if a bit flawed in terms of biographical information and the writers' interpretation of it.  My personal favorite episode is ""Requiem for a Crown Prince"" (the story of Crown Prince Rudolf's death at Mayerling) as I think it was probably the most historically accurate.

So overall, given my picky demand for more historical accuracy, I have to give this a solid 3.  I liked it, but I'm glad I didn't go to the expense of purchasing it, instead renting it from my local library.",1178064000,11,3000,5.123203285420945
2523311,3,B000EMGF2Q,"In general the series is very boring. It can put you to sleep in a matter of minutes. But there are some great and intense episodes: the one that tell the Bolshevik Revolution, centered around the character of Lenin. I found these few episodes very interesting. The man who plays Lenin really steals the show.

The stories about the Russian family of Romanov aren't that exciting but they hold well enough. The rest of the monarchies... I just had to fast forward those episodes. At the beginning of one of these I remember that 5 complete minutes had passed and the only thing that had happened was that somebody got out of bed and went to have breakfast, then a conversation started with the servant.

I think this series was aiming too high. It should have focused on one of the monarchies, no, rather on one of the countries. Watching those royal persons strutting around like peacocks is extremely boring. The product smells rancid, but I believe it still has some educational value. We have to thank the BBC for the try.",1176940800,2,1026,4.631868131868132
2523312,4,B000EMGF2Q,"""Fall of Eagles"" covers the decline and fall of the three great ruling dynasties of central Europe which disappeared after World War I.  These are the Habsburgs in Austria-Hungary, the Hohenzollerns in Germany, and the Romanovs in Russia.  The 13-part BBC mini-series was produced in 1974, and features the expected cast of familiar faces, most notably Patrick Stewart as Lenin, with the pivotal roles being first Miles Anderson and then Laurence Naismith as Emperor Franz Josef I, Charles Kay as Tsar Nicholas II, Gayle Hunnicutt as Tsarina Alexandra, and Barry Foster as ""Willy"" (Kaiser Wilhelm II).  The series begins in 1853 with the decision of the Franz Josef picks the wrong sister to be his wife while Queen Victoria's eldest daughter Vicky marries Crown Prince Frederick of Prussia.  The road to World War begins because one ruler marries a weak woman rather than a strong one, thereby laying the seeds for revolution, while another marries a strong woman but is only able to rule for 99 days before dying and leaving the throne to a son eager to turn his back on the desire of his parents to move towards a constitutional monarch and embrass Prussian militarism.

However, ""Fall of Eagles"" is not a balanced treatment of the fall of these three dynasties, with most of the emphasis being on what was happening in Russia even thought the Romanovs show up last.  There are six episodes focusing primarily on the Romanovs (5, 7-9, 11-12), with another episode (6) devoted to Lenin besting his rival Julius Martov for control of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party.  In contrast there are only three episodes focusing on the Habsburgs (1, 4, 10), one of which (4) is basically a detective story regarding the death of Crown Prince Rudolf and his mistress at Mayerling (which was interesting to see after having watch&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Illusionist/dp/B000NPHGZO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""The Illusionist""</a>&nbsp;this year).  The Hohenzollerns are also the subject of three episodes (2, 3, 13), including the last one, although Willy pops up several times in the context of his relationship with his cousin Nicky in Russia.  The emphasize on Austria-Hungary and Germany at the beginning certainly made it seem that we would be treated to the fall of each empire in equal measure, which certainly affected how much I enjoyed the mini-series as a whole.

It seems to me there is a concerted effort to avoid covering some of the most familiar ground from World War I and the Russian Revolution.  But while I can understand having the execution of the Romanovs and other key events covered in the 1971 film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nicholas-and-Alexandra/dp/0767827775/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Nicholas and Alexandra""</a>&nbsp;occur off screen, I was rather disappointed that the assassination of the Archduke Ferdinand in Sarajevo, the spark the set off the World War, happens that way as well.  I thought that would be one of the pivotal moments in the series and while I can appreciate the dramatic irony of doing it this way, it was still disappointing.  In that frame of mind I watched the final episodes fully aware how time and time again too much of the end game was happening off camera.  World War I is necessarily a whirl of contemporary film footage and Michael Hordern's narration, and that the two pivotal actions by Germany during the war were its use of unrestricted submarine warfare, which ultimately brought the United States into the war, and how they helped get Lenin and his comrades back to Russian to co-opt the revolution begun by Alexander Krensky.  Of course, back in 1974 the Soviet Union still existed, so what the Russian Revolution would clearly have been the great legacy from the end of these dynasties from the perspective of world history.

The end of ""Fall of Eagles"" comes not with the bang of the death of the Tsar and his family, but the whimper of the Kaiser greeting his exile as the chance to finally have a nice cup of English tea.  However, it was the off handed remark concerning what happened to the Habsburgs that was the final disappointment because I fully expected in the end to see the eagles fall and not just hear about it.  That being said I certainly know a lot more about the background of the First World War than I did before hand, especially in regards to Germany and Austria-Hungary.  I definitely appreciate the recommendations I found in other reviews here for books where I can ""read more about it.""  Earlier this month Charlotte Winters, the last surviving woman to have served in the American armed forces in World War I died, and the news reported that there are literally only a handful of American soldiers from that war still alive (20 Britons and one Australian too).  Seeng that story and watching this mini-series only underscores for me that this particular conflict has woefully underepresented in film and television.  Of what little is out there ""Fall of Eagles"" is a good place to turn to for an introduction to what the monarchies of Europe did to bring it about and cause their own downfalls.",1175990400,9,5196,5.102594339622642

After watching each episode, I would run to the computer and read his summary to understand, who was who, and what was happening.  Soon I would go to his description before AND after watching each episode.  It made it so intriguing!  I would have had little idea of what was going on without his description of the individual episodes. His review should be front and center on amazon's first page of reviews and not listed on the second page where others may not find it.  Also, because of his description of each episode, my local library decided that they would purchase the Fall of Eagles DVD for the library.

I will include his name so he receives the credit and from where I received the information. ALSO, there is a child/adult online teaching game, that is quite fun, to go with the Fall of Eagles. It was also necessary to provide background information to understanding this film series.

2523319,5,B000EMGF2Q,"When painting stories from 70 of the most tumultuous years in European history, no matter how large the available canvas, the artist must be quite selective. This 13 episode treat from 1974 is nearly perfect in every way, choosing events and people emblematic of this troubled time. I cannot vouch for the historical accuracy the way a professional historian could, but these certainly fit everything I know and seem reasonable and believable. If the actual conversations are invented, the reality of these doomed people is dazzlingly re-created.

30 plus years ago, British television had tiny budgets with which to work. Austere sets, limited costumes, minimal trappings to flesh out the look, and yet they created masterpieces still fondly remembered. I, Claudius, The Pallisers, and The Forsytes, and many others, all remain in the mind long after their closing credits. This series, new to me, joins that august company. The difference between then and now (and between British and American) is superlative scripts and splendid acting. Familiar faces abound throughout these tales, as we see and hear a supporting cast that has appeared in many BBC and British films. No weak spots, no boring or inept performances, just skilled artisans who deftly and completely capture what these famous names must have been like. Patrick Stewart is probably the most recognizable actor from this set, and his Lenin is absolutely believable. But he is by no means alone in inhabiting his character.

The recent film The Illusionist takes place during the same time, and concerns a fictional Austrian Prince; the suicide of the real prince is wonderfully portrayed in the episode ""Requiem for a Crown Prince"". What a difference we see between a tale told about people with emotions, desires, and beliefs, who are allowed to grow, sputter, and ultimately be what they are, and a contemporary film with a beautiful look, stunning and opulent sets, marvelous clothes, swords, trains, carriages and hats, but blessed with cartoon good and evil and devoid of soul. Garish and silly, sterile and dead, no matter how much gorgeous decoration is heaped upon it.

I only wish they had filmed another 20 or 30 episodes. A gripping, riveting story, wonderfully told that, after the somewhat sluggish first episode, holds your imagination and your intellect.

2523325,5,B000EMGF2Q,"I can't overstate how much I enjoyed this series. The sets,

the authentic costumes, the acting are all superb. My favorite

performances are those by Patrick Stewart who plays Lenin (the make-up men even gave Stewart the slighty Oriental eyelids that Lenin had, inherited from his Kalmyk grandmother), Barry Foster as Kaiser Wilhelm II, Curt Jurgens as Bismarck and Charles Kaye

as Tsar Nicholas II. Stewart's performance as Lenin is stupendous, displaying his cold fanaticism.

It should be pointed out, however, that the episodes are of

uneven quality. The episodes focusing on the Hapsburgs, i.e. the first where Emperor Franz Josef marries the Empress Elizabeth (his beloved ""Sisi"") and the later episode about the

suicide pact involving his son Crown Prince Rudolf and his mistress are not as well done as the others. On the other hand,

the episode showing Lenin's bringing about the historic split in the Russian Social Democratic Party into his Bolshevik (Majority) faction and the opposing Menshevik (Minority) in 1903 can stand alone as a dramatic program on its own. Here clearly shown are the roots of the tyranny the fanatic, amoral Lenin created and his split with Trotsky that, in spite of a reconciliation in 1917, would end up help bringing about his (Trotsky's) ultimate downfall at the hands of Stalin.

One scene in another episode that particularly impressed me showed that death of Tsar Alexander III and the conveying of the crown to his son Nicholas II. Nicholas is kneeling in front of the Russian Orthodox Patriarch who is proclaiming him

Tsar of all the Russias and Nicholas looks extremely vulnerable, child-like and really almost pathetic, incapable of bearing the burden of autocracy that he received.

One problem with the shows about Russia is that the major anti-Jewish pogroms that accompanied the revolutionary ferment of 1905 are not mentioned. Although there is mention of persecution of the Jews, these pogroms poisoned that attitude of the Western Democracies against the Tsarist regime, in the end leading to public pressure to prevent Britain from giving refuge to the Tsar and his family after they were overthrown. This is in spite of the fact that King George V of England was the Tsar's cousin. This is not made clear in the program.

In spite of this, the series is fantastic and I recommend this BBC historical series from the golden years of the 1970's.",1160870400,5,2406,5.035264483627204
2523326,4,B000EMGF2Q,"Fall of Eagles is thirty years old and takes it's title from the fall of the Romanov, Habsburg and Hohenzollern Empires, all of which used the eagle as an emblem. The series runs from 1848 to 1918 but concentrates on the years prior to, and during the First World War.

As you would expect of a BBC series costume series, it is very well done with great performances, in particular from Maurice Denhan as Kaiser Wilhelm I, Barry Foster as Wilhelm II ( Vain and stupid but not the monster of Allied propaganda ) and Curt Jurgens as Bismarck.

The problem is that it attempts to do to much, the Habsburgs in particular are pushed into the corners as the series concentrates on the German and Russian Imperial families. The result is that major events are only mentioned in passing, for example the murder of Rasputen, the murder of the Russian Imperial Family and the fall of the the last Habsburg monarch are all communicated by a couple of lines of dialogue between other fiqures. It could have done with having another four or five episodes to cover all the required history.

All in all however it is worth watching, but I guess you do need to have an interest in this period of history. For those who like to see actors outside their normal roles, look out for Patrick Stewart as Lenin and Michael Bates (Last of the Summer Wine and It an't Half Hot Mom ) as General Von Ludendorff.",1155772800,14,1385,4.488095238095238
2523327,5,B000EMGF2Q,Ever since I first viewed the series in the 70s I have been waiting for it to be out for purchase. By far one of the best series on the three doomed royal houses. I will be anxiously waiting for my copy to arrive so I can review a very interesting time in history from a very human approach.,1153440000,8,291,3.9491525423728815
2523328,5,B000EMGF2Q,"My heartfelt thanks to whoever is responsible for our finally being able to get DVDs of some of the best of British-made TV of the 1970s and 1980s -- a period of series-making featuring excellent ensemble casts, meticulous attention to detail, and above all, no dumbed-down or politically-correct history. Fall of Eagles is one of the best of these productions.

One reviewer has said, rightly, that as you watch this series you want to scream at your television to stop the inevitable progress toward World War I -- the culmination of ignorance, double-dealing, misunderstandings, fatalism, and downright stupidity on the part of the three major European empires and their rulers. The Hohenzollerns of Germany, the Habsburgs of Austria-Hungary and the Romanovs of Russia were determined to preserve their rule by ""Divine right"" while ignoring the social chaos, poverty, and burgeoning spirit of revolution among the many ethnic and cultural populations they controlled.

The series does a great job of showing that these rulers were rather unremarkable people coping with basic human experiences in very remarkable circumstances. They did not have exceptional intelligence or ability, some were prone to annoyingly histrionic behavior (Kaiser Wilhelm II), some were memorable, some oblivious of the world around them (Tsar Nicholas II and his Empress), some were pretty thick, and several, like Empress Elizabeth of Austria (SiSi), were outright flakes. They were surrounded by sycophants, but also by a few people of intelligence and integrity who could have steered them on less disastrous courses but who were largely ignored. And so we have the story of Prussia's territorial aggrandizement and unification of the German empire, Austria's attempts both to ignore and squelch the increasingly active Hungarian move toward autonomy, and Tsar Nicholas II's lethargic and pathetic obliviousness to the threat of the charismatic and politically savvy Lenin. Their Europe would disappear in the ashes of World War I, never to rise again.

If you love this series and want to know more about these fascinating people and times, let me recommend the book The Last Courts of Europe; A Family Album of Royalty at Home and Abroad, 1860-1914, by Robert K. Massie (available here at Amazon at a very reasonable price, a lot cheaper than I bought it years ago before there was an Amazon!). All of the people in the series are in it, both in text and a wealth of rare contemporary photographs -- you will marvel at how expertly the actors were made up to look like their real life counterparts. Most of these rulers were grandchildren of Queen Victoria of Great Britain, ""Granny Queen"", who had nine children and 44 grandchildren, all of whom married into the major and minor royalties of Europe. As you will have learned by watching the series, ""Cousin Willy"" (Kaiser Wilhelm II) and ""Cousin Nicky"" (Tsar Nicholas II) actually were cousins by way of their mothers, who were daughters of Queen Victoria. ""Cousin Nicky"" was visited aboard his royal yacht by ""Uncle Bertie"", King Edward VII of England.

If you are a history buff, or interested in the pre-World War I era, or you just plain like good television drama, you can't go wrong with this series. Yes, of course you may feel that some omissions should have been included, but on the whole, the series does an excellent job of exactly what it set out to do, show the intricate tapestry of Europe as it was and how it all came apart in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Again, I thank whoever is responsible for bringing it to us on DVD. Here's hoping there are more of such series to come.",1153180800,160,3641,4.983552631578948
2523329,5,B000EMGF2Q,Telling overlapping stories of events made this video series unique and much easier to see the complexity of history. Wish I had this when I was teaching history classes.,1152489600,7,170,4.896551724137931
2523330,5,B000EMGF2Q,"Well, the long awaited series that was a part of PBS television in the 70's has finally made it to DVD. I only saw bits and pieces of this Masterpiece Theatre presentation when it was originally aired. In particular, the sections on the state of Prussia during the time of Bismarck. There is no doubt that it is extremely well done and impressive. It is somewhat scholarly in the sense that we are seeing ""insider"" politics regarding the monarchs of Europe during a time of transition of power, when Europe gave up on the fantasy of a God ordained Leadership in favor of other radical ideas. I am reminded of that Al Stewart line in his song ""Manuscript"" ""and the Czar in his great Winter Palace called for the foreign news...an Archduke was shot down in Bosnia...but nothing much!"" This is what you are going to witness in this great production. As noted by another reviewer, the insight into the development of the Bolshevik party, led by Patrick Stewart as Lenin leaves us without much information on the various parties involved in the formation of that Socialist empire. It concentrates on Lenin and the immediate people in his circle. The parts about the Prussian Empire are interesting, the Austrian-Hungarian Empire under Franz Joseph are made more clear and a considerable amount of time is spent on the Romanov family and all of the silly decisions and fantasy that envelope that tragic situation. The German empire under the Kaiser is somewhat entertaining and informative regarding the immaturity of Willie, especially when he starts sending romanticized paintings, done in bad taste regarding the ""Yellow"" race to his ""relation"" Czar Nicholas. Nothing was more underestimated than the Japanese empire or more overestimated as to the God ordained connection of the various monarchs to make decisions in Europe. World War I was the result, and this tragic ""Christian Civil War"" brought about untold consequences for the entire world. You are left with the impression of ""if only"" when you see this History lesson unfold before your eyes. Perhaps Mad King Ludwig II of Bavaria (not covered here in any capacity) has been proved correct in the hindsight of 20/20 armchair historians regarding his extreme dislike of Prussian military ventures and their probable consequences on World History. Yes! This series is well worth your investment, although I have to report that one of my discs would not run in my DVD out of the four that this series covers. However it did run on my computer curiously enough. Try not to be too tired when you view this series, there is a lot of low conversation that you will miss that is important. A real boon for History buffs! Well recommended.",1152403200,10,2686,4.892543859649122

2523332,5,B000EMGF2Q,"When one dovetails the Second World War and the ensuing Cold War into the unresolved conclusion of the First World War, it isn't hard to come to the realization the events depicted here shaped all our lives, and continues to.  The Fall of Eagles thoroughly evokes the tragedy that was the First World War, illustrating a momentous conflict in which none of its combatants ever wanted to be there in the first place.  In the second to last episode, the Kaiser bellows at his chancellor the folly of speeding the exiled Bolsheviks secretly through Germany so they might take control of Russia and pull out from the war, ""We'll be replacing an enemy for a monster!"", and sighs the decision will one day be rued by future generations of Germans.  And Eastern Europe at the very least, he might have added.

When we follow the ripples of the events described in Fall of Eagles, it is dumbfounding.

Outside of the excellent performances and script, what really delivers are the sets, which are very believable, especially the monarch's grand living spaces.",1149724800,11,1051,4.816666666666666
2523333,5,B000EMGF2Q,"The director of some of the episodes in this series was asked what he would change if he could and he said that he would make the script less complicated. Thank heavens the series is ""set in stone"" as it is absolutely perfect as it is.  The director could not have done better--ditto for the cast, costumers and all who were associated with this top-notch project.  If you enjoy a series which features some history, a superb cast, intelligent dialogue and beautiful costumes, you will treasure this DVD.",1148947200,8,504,4.715909090909091
2523334,5,B000EMGF2Q,"This is among the outstanding historical dramatizations to come out of the BBC golden age of the 1970s.  As a serious student of history, I am highly impatient with inaccuracies and the glossing over of important issues.  This series did not disappoint.  ----  The splendid costumes and sets are impressive in their own right.",1147392000,13,326,4.981481481481482
8111286,5,B000EMGF2Q,"There is a scene in Fall of Eagles, when the German General Ludendorff falls into a fit of rage, screaming ""Traitors! Traitors!"" Ludendorff will appear later in history, near a certain beer hall in Munich, with an equally enraged colleague, who will visit upon us another world war.

After thirty years, BBC finally released Fall of Eagles on DVD. What's more, they did it right, with a beautiful transfer. This elaborate production presents the defining event of the twentieth century, the Great War (World War I), from the points of view of those who brought it about and were themselves consumed by it.

Some may regard Fall of Eagles as soap opera, and it is indeed staged like one, with almost all the scenes shot indoors. However, British television has always worked well within this constraint, as in I Claudius and Elizabeth R. The sets are magnificent and varied, shot in and around some imposing locations. The costumes are lavish and intricate, making me appreciate how ""dressing the part"" in those times could be called part of one's duty. I can't imagine how the women managed.

Except for Patrick Stewart, Barry Foster, Michael Kitchen, and Gayle Hunnicutt, the cast is made up of character actors unfamiliar to non-British audiences, especially when hidden by beards and mustaches. However, the depth of talent in this huge cast is striking, with convincing portrayals, from the walk-ons to the leads. The producers also should be praised for running a tight ship, which could easily have become unwieldy, with the parallel and complex events and the 13-episode length.

Though the story is made up of undocumentable private dialog (except perhaps via diaries), skillful writing, directing and acting create an intimacy that makes one truly to feel like a fly on the wall. Some of the scenes are indeed contrivances. For example, the future empress of Russia, Alexandra, is told by the current empress Marie Dagmar about her concern, that she, Alexandra, wife of the future Emperor, is not Russian Orthodox but German Lutheran. This should not have concerned the old Empress, since she herself was a Danish Lutheran who had converted and was embraced by the Russians. Alexandra not only converts to Russian Orthodoxy, but does it with a militancy that's downright, well, German. Though such an exchange probably wouldn't have taken place, it serves the historical and dramatic purpose of establishing religion as a major factor in the fate of the Romanov dynasty. Alexandra had something to prove, and she did so with a disastrous vengeance. Another value of apocryphal scenes like this is to portray characters as real people, rather than mere ""names on a page"". Through the intimacy of these private scenes, we can see how the lack of detachment from their own affairs and complete detachment from the affairs of their subjects is what brought about the Fall of Eagles -- the mundane concerns and banal motives in an age of romantic excess, drove monarchs, ministers and consorts, who in turn drove history. Oh yes, did I mention the word ""hubris""?

Do not let the length of Fall of Eagles put you off. This is one of those wonderful viewing experiences, so rich, so deep, that while watching it the first time, you resolve to watch it again, because you know that characters and events will fall into place, in a seamless, poignant, often maddening saga of real people, caught up in real events, trapped in a train speeding relentlessly to a precipice.

Fall of Eagles is not just a routine chronicle of events, but a particular interpretation of history, not only in its choice of dialog but in its perspectives and emphasis. For example, the actual trigger of the Great War depicted here is more complex than what you may recall from your generalized history lessons. So, yes, there is a bit of revisionism here -- that the Kaiser by no means bears sole responsibility for this tragedy, that there is plenty of blame to share among France, Britain, Russia and Germany. Though Fall of Eagles is top-down in perspective, it makes clear that history is not only driven by individuals in power but by the currents and events confronting them.

If you are truly concerned about how we got where we are today, you owe it to yourself to witness this amazing epic and pass it down to your children.

Further thoughts:

1. There are two soundtracks, one for the opening credits, the other for the end credits. (Opening theme is Mahler, I think.) Both are in perfect accord with their subject, the closing music, in particular, a chilling depiction of the title.

2. There is an indispensable program guide included with the DVD. Each episode is supplemented by well-written capsule biographies. There's even a genealogical chart to help keep the dynasty members and their kinships straight in our minds.

3. There are three interviews with two players (no Patrick Stewart, alas) and a director. Gayle Hunnicutt, in particular, stands out for her insightful observations.",1525392000,,5002,4.962962962962963

Bismarck and Kaiser Wilhelm are exceptionally well characterized. My only negative commentary is on the attitude to Nicholas II ( someone making this show clearly had a personal dislike for him).
