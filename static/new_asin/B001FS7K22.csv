8302538,5,B001FS7K22,"Such a thoughtful human approach in detailing why we need physical keepsakes to feel closer to those we can no longer experience as we did in the past. The backdrop is 9/11, but the focus is on keeping our memories alive through the objects our loved ones have left behind.
The author emailed me a while back and asked how I was planning to use the video. I told him I recently saw this on PBS and was so moved by its' message and beauty, that I wanted a copy for myself.
If you hold memories close to your heart, this film will take you on on a poignant, beautiful, and somewhat familiar journey of others who have been there and understand.",1464134400,,642,4.270491803278689
8302539,5,B001FS7K22,"Jonathan  Fein and Brian Danitz's Objects and Memory is a beautifully made, very sensitive an hour long film examining the importance of objects found in the wreckage of the World Trade Center. The film focuses upon objects found and then returned to family of the owners of the objects, or the owners themselves.  Each of the ""to camera"" personal stories is extraordinarily powerful. You can help but be moved.

The film also documents the personal internal battles the city's historians underwent, challenges over when to start collecting materials versus needing to be sensitive. And many of them personally affected by the events.

Staff of the unfortunately named Fresh Kills Landfill site, also get to tell their story and their role in sifting the material, and the importance they themselves placed finding items (including body parts) and returning these to families. A true sense of duty amongst a group of people we don't normally consider in our daily lives.

The Philip Glass score gives it a very new york feel, but also the serenity that a film of this type needs.

The film is an major contribution to our understanding of the intangible impacts of the disaster. The attribution of meaning to a disaster and sense making is very important to the individuals affected coming to terms with the event. The film shows how objects can be important for some people to start making sense.  It makes us realise how important ""stuff"" is, and can become.

I'd recommend anyone interested in this area getting hold of a copy. It should be required viewing in any training or education course.",1368316800,2,1597,4.932835820895522
8302540,4,B001FS7K22,I purchased J Fein's Objects and Memory because I was interested in reflecting upon the  power of objects as witnesses to history.  September 11th 2001 was a moving case study.  I liked that the interviews left me with possiblities of many themes that are contained within the various objects rather than picking objects that conveyed a pre-determined theme.  The visuals of the bent steel are quite amazing.,1353369600,3,408,5.044776119402985
8302541,5,B001FS7K22,"Objects and Memory is compelling and fascinating, and a wonderful gift for people who may have missed it in theatres or on PBS. The film makes us look at what we've lost and what is left after catastrophe--- seven years later, we are all still trying to make sense of Sept 11, and how to react in the aftermath. I strongly recommend this.
