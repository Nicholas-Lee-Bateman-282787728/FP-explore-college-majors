7881290,2,6304967217,"I was planning on writing a review for ""Killer Angels"" like I would any other action film, but the version I got my hands on - the European release from Carol Media - is such a shameful piece of work that I can't write too reliable a critique on the movie itself. Incomplete dubbing and some obvious, considerable cutting during the pictures' second half makes for a poor product that just oughtn't have been released. Thusly, I'm going to be careful in writing this review to make sure I don't blame something on the filmmakers that's the fault of western distributors...but even with that considered, this isn't that great of film.

The story: three undercover cops - Yau Li (Moon Lee,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zu-Warriors-From-the-Magic-Mountain/dp/B00023BN2E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zu - Warriors From the Magic Mountain</a>), Rosa (Kingdom Yuen,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Raped-by-an-Angel/dp/6305534543/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Raped by an Angel</a>), and Amy (Hung Yuen) - must protect an underworld witness, particularly from the efforts of an enigmatic assassin (Gordin Liu,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-36th-Chamber-of-Shaolin/dp/B000MM0LEG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The 36th Chamber of Shaolin</a>).

Only a year before this one was released, Moon Lee had made the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Iron-Angels/dp/B0054WVF58/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Iron Angels</a>&nbsp;movies, and if you have a choice between those ones and this, I suggest you go for the former: the premise is similar but the execution is much better. ""Killer Angels"" isn't a poorly-made flick but it's depressingly dark and humorless: director Tommy Loo (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bastard-Swordsman/dp/B0034KYF7W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bastard Swordsman</a>) inserts a bit of typical Hong Kong sex humor (i.e. the policewomen need to forcefully repel perverted advances), but overall the characters are unhappy and tragic, and a great deal of the movie takes place at night and in the shadows. With that said, the scene of Moon Lee doing a choreographed song & dance number in a club while undercover is sure to lift almost anyone's spirits!

The action content is what I'm most apprehensive about reviewing. There's not much in the first half of the picture - two quick fights and a shootout - but the second 45 minutes feature a couple shootouts with motorcycles, a short John Woo-style shootout wherein Gordon Liu takes on a bunch of fleeing henchmen, and a clustered finale including fights with gwailos Wayne Archer (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Operation-Condor/dp/B004SUDQ7W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Operation Condor</a>) and Mark Houghton (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Angel-on-Fire/dp/B00004RECY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Angel on Fire</a>). These are the biggest fault of the distributors, since they've been edited and cut so severely that no single fight is seen through to its completion - they just end, with the presumptive victor suddenly appearing in a different place. Action director Chui Fat (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crystal-Hunt/dp/B0000296QV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crystal Hunt</a>) could be the best in the business but you wouldn't know it from this edition of the film. Nevertheless, I'm going to assume I didn't miss too much: though fairly grounded, the choreography I did see was pretty basic and uninventive.

Perhaps the biggest mistake the filmmakers themselves made was the underutilization of Gordon Liu. Though he does well enough in the role, it seems like the part's beneath him, since the character tends to spend most of his time deadpanning while wearing sunglasses. It's cool that he carries such an enormous revolver, but I would've preferred to see more martial arts from him. As is, anybody could've played his part, and in the end, everything amounts to a very lackluster film. Seeing the fight scenes in their entirety may have raised this one's rating by one star, but I wouldn't advise too many people to go out looking for this one in any other version.",1357689600,,4365,6.494845360824742
7881291,3,6304967217,"Hong Kong fighting femme Moon Lee starred in a number of ANGEL films in 1988-90. These films featured a dizzying array of kung fu fights, shootouts, chases, and explosions and KILLER ANGELS (1989) is no exception. This one finds Moon leading the Blue Angels, an all-femme special operations unit of the Hong Kong Police Department. Assigned to bring down the Southeast Asian Shadows criminal gang, Moon goes undercover at the gang's nightclub and finds herself drawn to the gang's top enforcer, played by Gordon Liu, a popular 1970s kung fu star (THE MASTER KILLER). The gang leader, Don Chu, is played by Leung Kar Yan (THUNDERING MANTIS), another mainstay of 1970s kung fu films. Despite these actors' presence in the cast, it is Moon Lee and her female partners who dominate the kung fu in the film's nonstop series of action setpieces. Gordon shoots a lot of people but he never throws a punch or a kick. This may seem like a waste to hardcore kung fu fans, but the film remains thoroughly enjoyable and is highly recommended to fans of Hong Kong action cinema.",990835200,4,1065,4.762162162162162
