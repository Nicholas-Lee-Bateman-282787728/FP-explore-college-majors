2769004,2,B000NIBUVW,"I was hoping this would be a terrific set.  After all, how can it not be with The Great Escape, Battle of Britain, Run Silent Run Deep and A Bridge Too Far?  Unfortunately, upon playing my favorite of the bunch, The Great Escape in it, I was suprised to learn that it has not been enhanced for 16x9 TVs.  And likewise Run Silent, Run Deep.  Oddly, Battle of Britain and A Bridge Too Far both are enhanced.  But why not all four???  Seems a waste to have this set because I would rather keep looking for an enhanced Great Escape.",1199059200,15,528,4.23
2769005,5,B000NIBUVW,"This collection contains four excellent war films, all of them set during the second world war, and all of them made between 1958 (Run Silent, Run Deep) and 1977 (A Bridge Too Far). Run Silent is the classic submarine action adventure film, with Clark Gable and Burt Lancaster fighting each other as well as Japanese warships. This one is rivetting, superbly conveying the fear and claustrophobia of confinement in a submerged tin can, as well as the helplessness and terror of being bombarded by depth charges. The courage of submariners never fails to astound me.

The Great Escape, made in 1962 and starring dozens of famous American, English and German actors, is the true story of a mass escape from a German Stalag or prisoner of war camp. Three hours pass quickly as the splendid cast manage their ingenious escape. The film made a star of the motorcycle riding Steve McQueen, who's terrific, as is everyone else. A Bridge Too Far, directed by Sir Richard Attenborough, is a British production about the failed attempt to capture several bridges leading into Germany in a campaign called Operation Market-Garden, which was  conceived by General Montgomery. The operation was a failure and the film is unflinching in describing why. It is a harrowing story. Finally, The Battle of Britain, which features breathtaking aerial photography and vintage Spitfires, Messerschmitts and Stukas. Set in 1940, it shows the British Royal Air Force fighting their desperate battle against the German Luftwaffe for control of British air space to prevent the Nazi invasion of Britain that everyone expected. The airborne scenes are some of the best ever filmed. The film is thrilling and stars the the finest English actors of the era, including Laurence Olivier, Ralph Richardson, Michael Caine, Trevor Howard and a young Ian McShane (Deadwood, Lovejoy, Sexy Beast), in his first major film. The picture and sound in all four films are exemplary.

These are some of the finest war films ever made. If you enjoy the genre, you should love these. Strongly Recommended.

2769008,4,B000NIBUVW,"Have only watched Run Silent, Run Deep.  Back in 1957-58, I lived two blocks from a scene being filmed in Long Beach, CA and was interested to see what it would look like in the movie.  It took two full days of filming and ended up with about 15 seconds in the movie.  But, it was fun to see.  Movie was very good.

It does its best to be historically accurate, and the use of original British Spitfires and Hurricanes, as well as the SPanish Air Force versions of the Heinkel 111 bombers and Messerchmitt 109 fighters is brilliant. I saw this movie as a kid when it came out in the theatres, and it is still one of my very favorite movies.

The Great Escape with Steve McQueen, A Bridge Too Far with Sean Connery, and RUn SIlent, Run Dep with CLark Gable are all fantastic movies also, filled with action.",1363478400,,593,4.542056074766355

8177884,5,B000NIBUVW,"There have been only a handful of World War II films that tackle a major battle or campaign in the detail that this film does. THE LONGEST DAY, TORA! TORA! TORA! and A BRIDGE TOO FAR are some of the others. 1969's THE BATTLE OF BRITAIN brilliantly focuses on the campaign, the strategies, the battles and the brave men and women that fought this battle. It features Michael Caine, Christopher Plummer, Laurence Olivier, Robert Shaw, Trevor Howard, Susannah York, Curt Jurgens, Ralph Richardson, Michael Redgrave and Kenneth More. Ron Goodwin composed another excellent score. Goodwin cornered the market on World War II film soundtracks during this period (OPERATION CROSSBOW, WHERE EAGLES DARE, 633 SQUADRON and FORCE 10 FROM NAVARONE). 1969's THE BATTLE OF BRITAIN was directed by Guy Hamilton, and produced by Harry Saltzman and S. Benjamin Fisz.

1958's RUN SILENT, RUN DEEP directed by Robert Wise, is a tense WWII submarine drama comprised of Clark Gable (Commander Richardson) battling wits against an unseen Japanese enemy in his obsessive determination to destroy the vessel responsible for sinking his previous sub and responsible for the loss of his command. Clark Gable's determination leads him to vie for a new command and in doing so obtains the go-ahead to take command away from Burt Lancaster's sub. Keeping Lancaster on, as his executive officer, and the rest of Lancaster's crew aboard, Gable leads the submarine back to the Bonsai Straits to take on the enemy. Strong-willed Lancaster (Lieutenant Jim Bledsoe) and Gable battle each other every step of the way as the submarine and crew undergo relentless grueling practice drills for a tactic Gable is keeping secret to himself. Director Robert Wise brilliantly addresses themes concerning loyalty, respect, camaraderie and redemption for the characters aboard from John Gay's script based on Commander Edward L. Beach's novel. The veteran cast includes Jack Warden, Brad Dexter and Don Rickles. Veteran Special Effects man, A. Arnold Gillespie (THIRTY SECONDS OVER TOKYO, FORBIDDEN PLANET) designed some very effective and ominous looking Japanese naval vessels adding to the atmosphere of this lurking enemy that haunts Gable. As this film intensifies to its conclusion Robert Wise builds the tension and suspense of Gable's obsession matched against the crews suspicions that perhaps their Captain has gone mad. Only Lancaster gradually recognizes the force that drives Gable and his risky plan to outwit the Japanese. This is a very good war film exploring what drives and haunts men in command and examines what tests their effectiveness and resourcefulness as leaders.

1963's THE GREAT ESCAPE is director John Sturges' brilliant film presentation of the absorbing Paul Brickhill Book. John Sturges effectively retells the story from the script by James Clavell and W.R. Burnett, which is a condensation of events and people taken from the book. The film deals with the lives and efforts of the Allied POW's to escape from a German prison camp. We do not see John Sturges take any side in this film. Only near the end of the film does he begin to make a political statement on Nazism and its effect on traditional German military ethics and the lives of the captured Allies. Sturges' focus is more on the men caught in war and its effects on them. We see the men rely on dormant qualities they never knew existed until they put on a uniform and were captured and held in foreign territory. We see men going to extreme lengths to escape because of their inborn right to be free. This is represented by Steve McQueen's character Hilts otherwise known as the ""Cooler King,"" Charles Bronson as Danny and Angus Lennie as Ives the ""The Mole."" We see other men going to equal lengths to escape and cause havoc behind enemy lines by diverting German troops from the front to recapture them. This is the main purpose of the escape and Richard Attenborough as the ""Big X"" orchestrates the overall plan. He calls upon every expertise of the prisoners to reach this one goal. He calls upon tailors, forgers, scroungers, tinkers, and engineers, just about anyone capable of getting the job done. These are portrayed by James Garner, Donald Pleasence, James Coburn, David McCallum, John Leyton, Gordon Jackson, Tom Adams, Nigel Stock and others.

For years this was considered a great World War II action adventure film, but John Sturges' reaches far above that mundane distinction. His style and ease of direction glosses over his own profound statements that he makes in this film. For example, James Garner cleverly befriends a German guard for the sole purpose of stealing his wallet so he can extort a 35-mm. camera and film from the guard. On the surface the audience is very amused at Garner's sly tactics, after all the Germans are the bad guys. However, subconsciously Sturges gave us enough personal information about the guard that we almost feel sympathy for him. This is reinforced by Sturges' choice of James Garner, one of the most likable actors in Hollywood, to perpetrate the deception on the unknowing guard. How can a nice guy like James Garner do this? As it works out Sturges lets the guard redeem himself. It is this guard that discovers the first tunnel when he spills some coffee on the floor and it disappears through the cracks. Now you the viewer are faced with a moral dilemma. Do I still feel sympathy for the guard? Do I still think that James Garner is a scoundrel? Or do I think that in war I have to do what is necessary? Garner's character did what he had to do and so did the guard.

Editor Ferris Webster did an excellent job of putting this complex story together giving it coherence and drive yet never sacrificing any of the wonderful characterizations that is the backbone of this film. Daniel Fapp's cinematography brilliantly gives us a feeling of claustrophobia while in the prison camp. Once the escape begins he gives us panoramas of landscapes which have a dual symbolism. On one emotional hand we are free and the far-off horizons elusively symbolize that freedom. On the other rational hand we know that we are still not free and the vastness of those landscapes only strengthens the reality that ultimate escape and freedom is improbable for the majority of the escapees.

Composer Elmer Bernstein also has more to say than meets the ear. His main title theme is as much a tribute to the prisoners in this story as it is to all men who must overcome the odds through their own perseverance and unwillingness to bend to defeat to whatever noble end they strive for. Bernstein's complex score complements the theme by giving us passages and statements on the diversity of the individuals as well as their singular overall objective. Once ""on the road"" the music reaches exhilarating proportions unlike that of traditional action Hollywood scoring. Bernstein wants to put the audience through the same suspense and anticipation that the escapees feel and then unleashes our pent up emotions in a crescendo of rousing orchestrations that has us cheering them on.

1977's A BRIDGE TOO FAR directed by Richard Attenborough is one of the last great WWII films made on an epic and grand scale from the era of the late 1950s through the 1960s and finally faded away in the 1970s. In many ways this is the last from that bygone era. We have both the old school and the new the up and coming filmmakers, actors, technicians and the lot, prominently coming together on this film. I think A BRIDGE TOO FAR is a very good film in many respects. One of the most important things it achieved was to bring Operation Market Garden to the attention of so many people. Till this film and the novel, Operation Market Garden had been virtually overlooked in history books. To think an operation on such a scale was almost relegated to footnote status is hurtful in many ways. Cornelius Ryan and his 1974 book, William Goldman's script adapted from Ryan's book, producer by Joseph E. Levine and finally director Richard Attenborough should all be commended for bringing this story, and it is a story of so many men and women, to the screen and to the consciousness of all concerned in one way or another.",1421625600,,8194,4.904109589041096
