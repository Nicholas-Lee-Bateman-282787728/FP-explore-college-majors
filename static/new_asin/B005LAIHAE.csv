4768239,3,B005LAIHAE,"Henry Cavill (Theseus of Tarsem Singh-directed epic ""Immortals"") plays a young American businessman Will, who has just arrived in Spain to meet his family. While out on a yacht with his father Martin (Bruce Willis), mother Laurie (Caroline Goodall), young brother Josh (Rafi Gavron) and Josh's fianc&eacute;e Dara (Emma Hamilton), Will makes a mistake and one of them gets injured. To buy a medicine, Will goes on shore alone, but when Will comes back, he finds everyone on the boat has disappeared.

""The Cold Light of Day"" starts promisingly, and then it slowly loses momentum through a whole heap of clich&eacute;. Without revealing too much about the story, the US-Spanish thriller is about an American on foreign soil, who gets involved in a web of intrigue.

The film's basic idea (a bit sounds like ""Frantic"") is not bad. The problem is its poor execution. In short, the film has no style. Characters, storytelling, acting and action set-pieces - everything in the film is just OK, and nothing more. Some action stunts are impressive, and so are the film's on-location shots (in Madrid), but they are wasted among the banal narrative that no one is really interested.

French director Mabrouk El Mechri (known for his unique mocumentary/meta-film ""JCVD"" starring Jean-Claude Van Damme as himself) directs ""The Cold Light of Day,"" written by Scott Wiper (director of ""The Condemned"") and John Petro. In addition to the players mentioned above, the cast of ""The Cold Light of Day"" includes Ver&oacute;nica Echegui, Colm Meaney (in a cameo role), Roschdy Zem and Sigourney Weaver with a gun. The film's photography is by Remi Adefarasin (""Elizabeth"").

With names and talent attached to it, ""The Cold Light of Day"" could have been a more thrilling suspense. As it is, it only feels like watching a drawn-out episode for a TV show.",1353283200,10,1834,5.0230263157894735
4768240,3,B005LAIHAE,"***Minor Spoiler Warning***

Boilerplate action/thriller made more interesting given the lead - Henry Cavill - aka The New Superman.

Not sure if this effort is a good thing or not.

Reason: Given that I've screened him earlier in '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Tudors/dp/B0042RJWTC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Tudors</a>', where he was fantastic as Lord Brandon, it's an established fact that he has the thespian talent to craft a believable character. But this was a fairly routine flick utilizing a rubber-stamp screenplay, so it's difficult to properly discern the performance out of the static drone of predictability.

Tells the story of a mandatory family reunion in faraway Spain. Cavill's character, Will, isn't exactly enthused at the prospect for two simple reasons. First, his company is heading toward bankruptcy and leaving the country for a European get-together is exacerbating an already stressful situation. And second, engaging with his old man isn't high on the agenda. Long since estranged, father and son have to work hard just to be civil, otherwise things get nasty fairly quickly.

Simply put - Will's not a happy camper. And his negativity is both palpable and viral, spoiling the gathering for the rest of his family. Completing the circle of misery, the old man is thoroughly pissed at the sourness that his son has brought with him.

Needing to resupply, pick up a new phone to replace the one his father tossed overboard, and to get some much needed personal space - Will dives off the family's luxury sailboat and swims to shore.

He's only on shore for an hour or so, but when he returns - his entire family is gone.

Desperate and scared, he reaches out to the local police. Problem is that they're in on the conspiracy.

Will, who has absolutely no experience in such matters, is forced to run.

He has to figure out what his father was into, why, and who he can possibly trust to help. Hunted by good cops as an accused murderer, blackmailed by unknown intelligence agencies and stalked by a highly trained assassin - a standard tick-tock thriller flick ensues.

Overall not bad, just not particularly fresh or insightful. Could've used a more sympathetic (and focused) MacGuffin in the form of a beautiful damsel in distress, i.e. '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Frantic/dp/6305133476/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Frantic</a>'. Just my two pennies in that regard.

Movie Note: A slight bait-n-switch is made in this film. Given that Bruce Willis isn't the star, his character doesn't live beyond the opening scenes. Not that he didn't contribute; without his efforts the stage wouldn't have been set as nicely. But Marketing's choice of employing a deception - by featuring Bruce so prominently in the advertising and cover artwork - was aggravating. It would've been more accurate, and honestly more interesting, had he not even been featured at all. An unannounced cameo, which I typically enjoy more than some perfunctory credit in the ad campaign.",1352419200,4,3071,5.375
4768241,4,B005LAIHAE,"OK, having seen this movie I know first hand that this movie is not as bad as it is made out to be by ALL the reviewers here on Amazon. I won't go over the plot and the actors, as they have been dug deeply into in the previous reviews. Instead, I shall tell you it like it truly is.

The movie, 'Cold Light Of Day' is a good, decent action movie. You get pulled in and it never lets you go. Why? Well, you just don't know who to trust and what is around any given corner. Sure Henry C. is made out to be a ""super spy"" instead of the stockbroker he seemingly is, but that's OK, as it truly doesn't deter you from watching the movie. My guess is this movie was made a couple of years ago before his upcoming blockbuster 'Superman - Man Of Steel' comes to our screens. Sometimes these kind of direct-to-DVD movies sit on shelves for ages until one of the leads becomes famous. (Take, for instance, 'Cabin In The Woods' with Chris Hemsworth, filmed in 2009 and released this year due to 'Thor'!)

Anyway, I digress. But I do agree that Bruce W. is wasted in the role of the father living on a boat with his wife, Caroline G. They have moved around, as a family for years, but now have all the kids around the table (on said boat) for the first time in a while. Rafi G. as Henry C's younger brother is wasted film fodder, much the same as his GF, the lovely Emma H. More than a hint of 'Bourne' runs thru Henry C. but unlike that other action character, this one ""feels"" real in his mistakes, wrong turns, pain.

Vernica E. as Henry C.'s ""love interest turned sister"" is both beautiful and full of action angst herself. Mind you, when being chased by Sigourney W. thru the streets, and coming off their moped rather badly, they both get up - and she, wearing a short skirt throughout, hasn't a scratch on her delicate thigh in the slightest! And, they both get back up and on the broken bike and roar off!

Joseph M. as the main bad guy is a treat to watch, but gets predictable very quickly. I mean, Henry C. has three (3) clear cut chances to kill him or at least badly wound him to stop him trying to kill them, but never takes the shot. Instead he tries to chat his way out of things! For me though, Roschdy Z. as the bad guy/good guy is brilliant! His voice, with that vibe of Morgan Freeman running through it, makes the last third of the movie his own.

Anyway, running at 93 minutes, filmed in Spain (so great scenery), and staring some big names that yes, I agree, were doing ""paycheck movies,"" 'Cold Light Of Day' is definitely not to be taken seriously - but then again, are 'Bourne' and 'Taken' and all those others?!

4768242,3,B005LAIHAE,"This is one of those ""What the flipping deuces was that all about (amazon made me edit it)"" films but it is a harmless enough shoot em up and more importantly features some ""subtle"" product placement for Audi, including a comical shot introducing a scene is a square where the panning shot is interrupted by a detour to feature a large poster fo the Audi A1, which is featured later in the film in the climactic chase scene. Bruce Willis e-mailed his performance in and Sigourney Weaver I think was cut and pasted from the identical role when she was a CIA agent helping some lad who had some mistaken identity thing, and his dad was a spy and some people with guns was chasing him, and he had to do something in a football or baseball game at the end. So thats cleared that up then.",1347840000,2,783,4.333333333333333
4768243,2,B005LAIHAE,"This movie started out with great potential and slowly wound it's way down to a feeling of ""why am I still watching"". The main character is a man down on his luck forced into a family vacation that turns into a run for his life and a desperate attempt to save his family. The twists and big reviles were cliche and predicable. Half the time I kept wondering ""why is he doing that"" or no way he'd walk away from this. Unfortunately I had a hard time getting behind anyone in this film, good guy or bad guy. I think one of the chase scenes sums this movie up best as our hero takes 5 minutes of the movie to chase someone down only to run away when he caught up to them. I have only ever walked out of a movie once. This would have been my 2nd but 1 of the 3 of us  was actually enjoying the move so we stayed.",1347753600,6,808,3.926829268292683
4768244,1,B005LAIHAE,"I'm not sure I can explain ""The Cold Light of Day"", not knowing the inside story as to why the movie was made or how it was made with the likes of Bruce Willis and Sigourney Weaver. I do know that the lead actor in the film is Henry Cavill, who will soon be playing the lead role in the Superman movie ""Man of Steel"". As far as Bruce Willis and Sigourney Weaver go, this is what they call in the business, a paycheck or favor movie. As far as Cavill goes, my only assumption is that the studio, Warner Brothers, wanted to get Cavill's face out there before ""Man of Steel"" happened. I'm not sure ""The Cold Light of Day"" did them any favors.

Cavill, I'm sure is a fine actor, but given the material here, he is an after thought in the midst of poor filming, poor direction, poor scripting and just an overall train wreck of a film. Cavill plays Will, a small business owner who goes on vacation to see his family in Madrid, all the while receiving phone calls galore about his business sliding into bankruptcy back home. This is just one of the pointless and irrelevant plot points.

After accidentally tackling his brother's girlfriend on the boat and knocking her head into a railing, he decides to go to town for some pointless reason. I think it was to get ointment for the gash on her head. So, he dives into the water and swims to shore, leaving his family behind. When he returns, the family boat is gone and the spy, terrorist thriller begins. At this point, he looks out into the straight where his family boat should be, from the beach and sees nothing. Then we have to endure a ridiculous long pan from his view across a bunch of people and eventually the camera lands on Will's stunned face after what had to be a twenty second shot. After about five seconds, I sighed, as we endure another ten seconds of irrelevant stuff. This is the kind of stuff that plagues the film.

Moments later, as the ""Taken"", ""Bourne Legacy"" wannabe film goes into full swing, we have to endure a four or five minute scene with terrible lighting. There are scenes in the film where all of a sudden, Will is just somewhere. We don't know how he got there or why he got there, but of course moments later, he was supposed to be there.

The scripting is terrible. Will, at one-point yells to a man at the American embassy, ""My families missing and I'm wanted for a murder I didn't commit!""

I don't know what ""The Cold Light of Day"" was intended to be. Was it a vehicle for Cavill so that people could see his face before ""Man of Steel""? Was it intended to be good or was it thrown together. I'm not sure, but the bottom line is, the movie was terribly done. There are too many characters and there are too many things that don't matter. There are unreasonable plateau's between Will meeting people and them helping or hurting him. Bottom line, just because a movie has Bruce Willis in it, doesn't mean its good. Willis did do ""Hudson Hawk"" after all.",1347321600,6,2938,4.3638025594149905
4768245,3,B005LAIHAE,"There was plenty of time during this movie to run for snacks, come back, and not miss anything. This is certainly not one of Bruce Willis at his best, and the entire cast of acting was not to exciting. Will Shaw takes a trip to Spain for a family vacation to go sailing for a week. But, all hell breaks loose when his family is kidnapped by intelligence agents, who are anxious in recovering a mysterious briefcase, and he finds himself on the run. This reminded me very much of a movie I watched in the past. I believe it was with Harrison Ford, and 'Frantic' rings a bell, except the kidnapping was his wife, and he was on the run. ""THE COLD LIGHT OF DAY"" was too slow, boring, and not much action. Although the theme was about conspiracy, family, and kidnapping, the plot needed work. Overall, the movie had a lot of room for Improvement.",1346976000,6,841,4.3630573248407645
4768246,4,B005LAIHAE,"I accidentally took a nap during one of the action scenes although I was entertained and wanting to watch through the end; the acting was simply too unconvincing and the plot too far-fetched to feel true and believable enough to me to truly draw me in and hook me. Still Henry Cavill is quite pleasurable to watch run around and perform stunts; his half-sister, Ver&oacute;nica Echegui wasn't hard to look at either. Although I enjoyed that it was filmed in Spain, it was just another remake of the regular Hollywood Action Thriller that has been done/overdone to death.",1345680000,,570,4.826530612244898
4768247,3,B005LAIHAE,"A well traveled family has a reunion in Spain. The son, Will (Henry Cavill) is spending a lot of time on his cell phone as he just got a call his company is bankrupt. In spite of the sad violin music, they didn't bother to develop his character at this early point for me to care. Later, his brother Josh (Rafi Gavron), Dara (Emma Hamilton) and mom (Caroline Goodall) are kidnapped and ransomed. We discover Dad, Martin Shaw (Bruce Willis) is in the CIA. He and son Will must find a way to save their family in 24 hours. The kidnappers are demanding the return of a briefcase that Willis doesn't have, one that his case worker Jean Carrack (Sigourney Weaver) has already turned in.

Yes, that would have been a great movie, except Willis doesn't get paid past the first 20 minutes and Cavill has to outrun horses and defeat the bad guys alone. So let's see, he doesn't trust the CIA. The police are after him for a murder he didn't commit. Armed with his dad's cell phone and enlisting the help of some movie eye candy (Vernica Echegui), Will sets out to save his family. Pretty standard stuff and then we get to the expected twist. At this juncture, the movie almost caught my interest, except that Henry Cavill never becomes convincing in this role. Instead of Henry being a stock broker, they should have made him a karate instructor, or an Olympic marksman giving him a skill he could use...No wait! He did use the cell phone.

After awhile, I didn't care if he got away or not since the plot was as weak as they come.  Not worth watching.",1485734400,,446,4.525

4768371,3,B005LAIHAE,"Another DVD with Bruce Willis prominently marketed on the cover who has probably has a total of at most about ten minutes of screen time.  Would have been more ethical to have not mentioned him and have it as a bonus when you start playing it and say, hey didn't know Bruce was in this one?  He does do a pretty good job in his small role, most of it as a father not impressed his son who his family hasn't seen for a while is more interested in his phone than them.  But the son's behaviour does lead to him swimming to shore from the boat to get some antiseptic cream but upon exiting the shop realising, Bruce and the family have had enough of him and ditched him.  The boat is nowhere to be seen.  Luckily the police have found the boat (although I thought it used to be green), and when they take him there the son sensing this is a trap where he's likely to get killed, fights the cops and steals a police car.  Conveniently Bruce has been hiding in the bushes the whole time to tell him he's not a greeting card salesman or whatever he told them he was, the rest of the family has been kidnapped and if they don't act quickly, will be killed.

But alas this is not the high body count rescue family action movie you're probably hoping for.  There's some minor action, and some ridiculous stuff where serious injury such as skin being grazed off by a road just doesn't happen.  Sigourney  Weaver is also in it, she's probably got a bit more screen time than Bruce but not much.  The movie is pretty forgettable, I watched this a couple of days ago and other than something about a brief case I can't remember much else of what happened.",1484956800,,1642,4.247588424437299

After that, he began to strike out on his own.

I'd never heard of this movie until I saw a netflix ad for it and can't figure how it got past me.  I found it to be as good an action thriller as any Bruice Willis or Stallone movie. Perhaps a little more so because of Will Shaw's beginning ineptness. I was also surprised by the cast (as well as how they were billed) because the ad didn't mention Wills or Sigourney Weaver at all, or a minute appearance by Colm Meaney.

I found the acting credible, the action fast-paced  though a bit overkill (literally) when Weaver begins mowing down pedestrians right and left.  The chase scene and resulting auto accident is over-the-top and about as horrific as can be.  There was a couple of twists and turns thrown in to shake up everything.

All in all, another movie where the protagonist doesn't know who to trust and throws in his lot with the least likely, resulting in an entertaining if slightly tense movie.

Plot-wise, I thought killing off the Bruce Willis character near the beginning of the movie didn't really work -- it seemed like that was done because they couldn't afford Bruce Willis for a whole movie.  I kept expecting the character to come back. I liked the familiar faces/stars Bruce and Sigourney Weaver, and some other character actors; I guess I think they could have added to the suspense if they played out those characters a bit more, rather than just using their faces to draw viewers.  I liked the locations in Spain and the plot twists.  But Henry Cavill did more than his share to hold up the truncated plot.",1437523200,,703,4.511811023622047

Lovely European movie that you can feel from the get go, with starring performances by Willis and Weaver. Cavill wasn't bad at all, but this was him before Superman.

Very soft writing, just easy on the brain, not really a good justification of why are we chasing the bad guys, but hey! popcorn, significant other, couch, rainy sunday, who needs a Stanley Kubrick deep movie?

4769509,4,B005LAIHAE,"Nooo!!!  Bruce Willis was finally given an opportunity to correct the many many (15) years of unforgivably awful movies he starred in and... he dies in the first 20 minutes!  How can this be?  His character was perfect too!  He was a fiesty ruthless govenment advisor with a dark history, a perfect chance for more of his character to develop!  Shades of his better days a couple decades ago before he went down the wrong path and attempted horror, comedy and dressed up as a cheerleader on the David Letterman Show but... he dies.  *pounds ground*  Nooo!!!!!

Alright, so it's disappointing that Bruce had a chance to redeem himself but for storyline purposes, it just isn't happening.  It's also rare that such a big name actor is killed off in such a surprising way.  He even appeared to be the main star in the movie.  The good news is that Bruce Willis doesn't make this movie alone- Henry Cavill plays a pretty good role as a man on the run.  His father is Bruce's character and he has absolutely no idea why his father was suddenly shot in the middle of the night in Spain during a vacation.  Before getting shot however, Henry asks his father all kinds of questions pertaining to a violent outburst a moment earlier that involves Bruce helping Henry escape from a potentially life or death jam, but Bruce refuses to answer any of them.

Basically Henry spends the entire time running down city streets, avoiding gunfire of the bad guys (Sigourney Weaver in particular) and looking for an explanation what happened to his father, as well as saving his kidnapped family.  Along the way Henry meets up with an attractive woman by the name of Veronica Echegui and it turns out she knew Henry's father really well, so a partnership is born.

This is your typical ""run and gun"" high-octane suspense with car chases, gun shootings, etc.  The storyline is perhaps the weakest point since it never builds up any of the family members so we really have no reason to care if they live or die.  That could have been corrected had the movie been at least 20 minutes longer, but... that's that problem- it's too short.  85 minutes.  Still, even though it gets sort of chaotic after the halfway point as far as who's on Henry's side and who's not, it picks up remarkably well as soon as Sigourney Weaver plays a more significant role near the end.  A REALLY good action-packed period of excitement there.  It is hilarious how Sigourney plays it really calm and cool while guns are firing all around her, lol.

4769565,4,B005LAIHAE,The movie is a suspense-type chase film by a first-time director. Interesting for fans of Henry Cavill as this is the first movie where his character is the major focus and he is not competing with a cast of thousands and/or CGI special effects. He does a pretty good job considering he is working with a very thin story line and not much guidance from the director. Bruce Willis makes a brief appearance as his father and Sigourney Weaver plays her part with gusto. This film has some major pacing issues but I found myself enjoying it in spite of its flaws. I give it 4 stars because I did like it but I am just not sure it would be to everyone's taste..,1374537600,,656,4.298387096774194

The biggest thing they teach you in screenwriting classes and film classes is that absolutely every last thing in a movie has got to be there for a reason.  Everything must drive the story forwards.  Cold Light of Day people did not get the memo.  Make it a game for the whole family: shout out any moment that is superfluous to the story.

There is a lot of edge of your seat action and Henry's character gets put through a ringer. But the movie itself, while enjoyable to watch, just never really told you anything. It was a let down and I don't believe it had anything to do with Henry's part or his acting which was perfectly fine. This was a script issue and not a very good one and he deserves better as well as Bruce Willis. I think many fans of Henry won't consdier it a waste of time but if you aren't a fan then you will be disappointed in this film. Aside from all that there is a lot of action that is enjoyable to watch. Now if you want to see Henry in a major leading man role go see ""Man of Steel"".

Horrible editing (I believe the car chase repeated footage at least twice...this ain't a 70s B movie).  Snooze-tacular ending.

He is top notch and is only further helped by an excellent A-list supporting crew (Bruce Willis and Sigourney Weaver). The action is a bit weak for a ""spy film"" and the obligatory car chase at the end was a bit too long (see 2 chases in 1), but the characters were enjoyable and most importantly very believable. While some of the stunts are a bit ""action movie"" the reactions and decisions are of a ""real"" person... What would you do trapped in a foreign country with no allies and no training?
One major complaint is the lack of love interest or more accurately the shoddily written twist that turns the love interest into a mere companion. I say shoddily written as the chemistry and actions of the couple are not those of ""just friends"" but due to a last minute script addition it gives a distinct feel of Empire Strikes Back (if you get my drift) ;-)",1361145600,,1006,4.3563829787234045

4770071,2,B005LAIHAE,"Sick & Stupid Score: 2/7*

This is an amateur movie, especially because of its stilted dialog, clueless acting, and uncreative plot.

Bruce Willis is on screen for the first 20 minutes and then disappears, something we have noticed in several so-called Bruce Willis movies lately.  It seems he is just selling his name to the movie producers.  Ditto for Sigourney Weaver, although she does hang around until the end of the show, she pops in and out as needed, trying to look and act convincing as a stone-cold spy mistress.  She gives a ridiculous performance.

Otherwise, no-talent actors, uninteresting plot, and a couple obligatory car chases, probably filmed only for the purpose of making the trailer.  Made on the cheap in Spain.

4770163,4,B005LAIHAE,"The Cold Light of Day(released Apr/12)stars Henry Cavill as Will Shaw,Sigourney Weaver as Jean Carrack,Bruce Willis as Martin Shaw and others. The film is an intriguing drama with good performances all around,and that includes Cavill,the lead character,who I think has a promising career ahead if he keeps up the good work I witnessed in this film.
The story finds Cavill visiting his family in the Costa Del Sol region of Spain,from San Fran. He and his father Willis seem to have a strained relationship and Cavill is in not such a good humour,as he receives a phone call telling him his business has gone bankrupt. Next day the family goes out for a cruise in their sailboat. When a mishap on board occurs Cavill swims ashore to get some antibiotics. When he returns for the swim back,the boat is no where to be seen. He climbs a promontory and spies the boat sitting in a cove not too far away. Getting aboard he finds it to be deserted. He returns to shore and the police take him to a deserted area and introduce him to a man who asks him to come with them. He refuses,commandeers a police car and flees for his life. The pursuit ends when Cavill is run off the road and into a tree. As a cop puts a beating on him Willis pops out of nowhere and subdues the cop. Both father and son flee and Willis comes clean as to his real profession. It seems he works for a secret branch of the CIA,but can tell him little more. Willis has a rendezvous with Weaver,a fellow agent. They talk of a suitcase that Willis retrieved for her,but now he wants back to give to the people that he took it from,to save his family who are being held captive. Weaver is reluctant buts says she will see what she can do. As Willis gets back in the car,shots ring out and Willis falls dead. Retrieving his fathers gun and cell phone Cavill takes off.
Cavill is chased through the Madrid streets in car and on foot. A cop is killed by the sniper which looks like Cavill did it,so he is also wanted by the cops. Cavill manages to get to the US Embassy where he meets up with Weaver and the sniper who tried to kill him,in a car outside. He gets in the car but realizes if he stays he is going to end up like his father. He feigns imminent sickness to get out then runs for it. Cavill uses his dads cell phone to call a person called Diego that pops up on his screen quite often. A girl on the other end, directs him to her location but the sniper is there waiting. A tussle ensues and they flee to her uncle Diego's apartment. They find her uncle dead,and Weaver and the sniper are awaiting his arrival,and the convo isn't going amicably. The girl enters and starts blasting which gives she and Cavill a chance to escape to the rooftop. From there they land at a local club whose owner is friends with Diego. Cavill has been wounded in the escape and they help patch him up.
During their brief time there Cavill learns that the girl is actually his sister! He also gets a phone call by the kidnappers of his family demanding to talk with Willis. He tells them what has happened to him and he arranges to meet with them. He finds his family still alive and these men all Israeli agents. Willis took the briefcase from them,and they thought he was a rogue agent. It turns out now Willis was just under orders from Weaver,who is the real rogue. The trick now is to retrieve the briefcase,because if they don't Weaver and company will keep hunting Cavill and his family down until they are dead. Right now the family is safe under Israeli custody.
At the nightclub the sniper comes looking for Cavill,and the owner and his men are waiting for him. They subdue and beat him but he won't confess to anything. However he escapes and they follow him right back to Weaver who has the briefcase and the sale of it is going down to terrorists in a parking garage. Cavill and an Israeli agent argue and Weaver hears their commotion. She and the sniper shoot the terrorists and flee. The sniper is killed in the chase through Madrid streets and Weaver tries to first outrun Cavill and his""new"" sister. Along the way the tables are turned and all three end up in a terrible crash. Weaver manages to get out of her vehicle first,suitcase in hand,and is about to deal the coup de' gras when she is hit behind and killed by an Israeli agent. The film ends as Cavill and his family are reunited. A US agent offers Cavill a job like his dad but refuses. Cavill's mother and brother go on to introduce themselves to their new daughter/sister.
Admittedly there is alot of story to tell here but the pace,editing and drama keep you interested all the way through. I found very few slow ups and just enough twists and turns to keep it all interesting. Mention just has to be made for attention to details in this film,which you rarely see anymore in movies these days. When someone has a vehicular accident in this film,bystanders actually see it,react to it and come over to help. Most films a crash occurs and bystanders,if they are even see,react with little or no emotion let alone actually come to help. Another thing is as little as a car door being opened and left open. In reality your key causes a dinging sound to be heard. In this film you actually hear it,but in most movies you usually hear nothing. I LIKED that aspect of the film. It just made it seem more real and relevant. Bruce Willis is again on game in his relatively smaller part,as is a wonderful appearance by Sigourney ""Alien"" Weaver,whom I do not see enough of these days. Also watch for a too brief appearance by one of my favourite DS9(Star Trek-Deep Space Nine)folks,Colm Meaney;yet ANOTHER actor I see too little of.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp. There are no extras.
All in all a quite good action drama,whose pace,attention to detail and and good solid acting by all,will have you riveted the whole way through. Kudos to Cavill for bringing it to the table. Recommended.",1359676800,2,5958,4.422202001819836
4770164,2,B005LAIHAE,"COLD LIGHT OF DAY is one of those mindless action films that depends on numerous car chases, government deceptions and a normal guy suddenly becomes an action movie hero.  Possibly the studio's ploy to introduce Henry Clavill, their new Superman???  Shamelessly promoting Bruce Willis as a star when he gets bumped off very early?  And shame on Sigourney Weaver for running around with an Uzi, showing no signs of her iconic Ripley or any signs of her acting finesse.
COLD LIGHT OF DAY is purely a distraction aimed at testosterone junkies.",1359590400,,540,4.912087912087912
4770245,3,B005LAIHAE,Just ok.  Predictable.  Henry Cavill turned in a good performance.  Same for Willis.  Sigourneys performance was not up to snuff IMO.,1359590400,,133,5.190476190476191
4770246,2,B005LAIHAE,"Just like the title says, If you are expecting a Bruce Willis movie..you won't get it.  Bruce basically appears in the first 10 minutes of the movie and then thats it.  Looks like the producers wanted to put a big name in it to get people to buy or rent it thinking they are getting a movie where he is the prime star but instead do a switcharoo on you.  The action is ok, the acting is mediocre and the plot is nothing new.  It is by far not the worst movie I have seen but not worth buying for sure and really not rent worthy either.  This movie teeters on being B-movie quality.",1359504000,2,581,4.06140350877193
4770247,3,B005LAIHAE,"With so many action films and stories that deal with intrigue, especially ones that include terrorism, it is not surprising that there are a number of hits and misses. THE COLD LIGHT OF DAY has the feeling of a tryout for a television series (note the lines at movie's end when strangely, Colm Meaney addresses Henry Cavill with the concept that perhaps Cavill has performed his mission so well that he consider taking on a new life job...). The story as written by Scott Wiper and John Petro is flimsy and the direction by Mabrouk El Mechri is incompetent, yet despite this the film holds our attention throughout its 93 minutes of lack of substantial plot. The reason may just be that finally we get the opportunity to look at the handsome Henry Cavill for an hour and a half.

Will (Henry Cavill) is reunited with his family (Bruce Willis, father Martin, Carolyn Goodall, mother Laurie, Rafi Gavron, brother Josh, and Emma Hamilton, Josh's girlfriend Dara) in Spain for a vacation, though he is absentminded because of work issues back in USA: is small business has gone bankrupt. On a family outing on a sailboat Dara is injured and Will returns from a short trip to get supplies only to find the boat and his entire family missing. Someone has apparently kidnapped them and holding them hostage. It turns out that Will's father is not who he believes him to be. With the stakes high over a mysterious briefcase, it becomes a chase of cat and mouse without knowing whom to trust. Will discovers things about his family - his CIA agent father had an illegitimate daughter Lucia (Vernica Echegui) who of course is Will's sister, and his father was involved in a scheme with agent Carrack (Sigourney Weaver) and her sidekick Gorman (Joseph Mawle). The rest of the film is chase scenes with Will and Lucia in constant danger from Currack and apparently Israeli terrorists.

Of course you know how it is all going to end before it is barely started. The script is very thin, the direction is a bit silly, but the personalities on the screen hold it all together on their looks and their chops.  Not a bad film, not a good film, but worth an escapist watch on VOD.  Grady Harp, January 13",1359504000,,2186,4.626288659793815
4770248,1,B005LAIHAE,"You know a thriller is in serious trouble when the picteure-esque scenery is far more enthralling than the action scenes on screen. So goes the generic espionage potboiler the Cold Light of Day. The latest showcase for would-be British leading man Henry Cavill, that will leave you thinking to yourself that this guy will be forgotten, once...wait, what was his name again.
 Cavill, if you don't already know, will be seen next summer as the man of steel, so this vehicle, along with last year's lackluster Immortals are to familiarize audiences with him. You know kind of the way that the Recruit and Daredevil stalled the once promising career of Collin Farrell. Here, Cavill stars as Will Shaw, a man of anything but steel, on a week long boating vacation with a family that he seems to despise. When wouldn't you know it, mom (Caroline Goodall) and little brother Josh (Rafi Gaven) along with his girlfriend (Emma Hamilton) are all abducted by an unseen terrorist group. Pops (Bruce Willis) comes clean to Will about his real day job, he's not a cultural attach, but a CIA operative, so there plan seems to be to get some quality father-son bonding time in while getting the fam back.
 This movie is as ludicrous as it sounds, and strangely enough it sounds to me just like an ancient Gen Hackman-Matt Dillon flick called Target. The narrative is obvious, far-fetched and mindless in a way that will make your head hurt and your brain angry.
This all plays out as a sort of Taken, Jr., or maybe it's aim is as a cross between the Bourne films and the Spy Kids movies.
 At least the picture is set in a lovely Spain setting instead of Bulgaria or Yugoslavia, like so many actioners these days. The cinematography by Remi Andefarsijn, who also shot the gorgeous looking HBO mini-series Band of Brothers and  the Pacific, is something short of wonderful. Anderfarsjin manages to make the Cold Light of Day the best looking action movie I can remember this year, it's just such a damn shame that it is in the service of one of the most pedestrian.
 Directed by Mabrouk El Mechri, who's previous film was the critically esteemed JCVD. I didn't like that movie very much as I felt it reduced it's star and subject, action icon Jean-Claude Van Damme, to a whiney, self-loathing and an utterly embarrassing joke. Audiences seemed to know better and stayed away, I wrote at the time of it's release  that the same people who liked this film, were the same people who didn't like any of Van Damme's other movies. Now El Mechri has returned with another obnoxious movie with even more poorly staged action scenes, car chases, plot twists you'll see before you walk through the theater door and bland heroes. Action movies clearly are not his forte, and based on this evidence I would say that El Mechri has a distain for the genre, but I`m also not sure he has the skill or style for anything else. It almost seems like a curse, the one thing he has talent for he despises.
 Bruce Willis at least makes getting old look good, actually he manages to make it look cool, settling in quite well these days playing an older version of his well liked screen persona. Here, almighty Bruce gets to show he is still in full command of his bad assery, even more so than in recent titles like the Expendables 2 and the over hyped Red. However, he is not the star here, no matter what the marketing tries to lead you to believe, in fact he makes a none too unexpected, but no less unsatisfactory early exit. Leaving the picture in the hands of Cavill.
 Cavill is an intense, serious looking presence, with chiseled features and an action hero's physique, all that he is missing is charisma. Which is something no action star can do without, as we've seen before, actually acting chops are far more optional. As a leading man, he is just too colorless and prosaic, let's hope that things get better for him before sporting Superman`s cape. He makes a uninteresting film move at an even more lumbering pace.
 Sigourney Weaver, a class act and legendary movie star, is at her worst I have ever seen or even thought I would see from such a veteran talent,  Giving an entirely unconvincing performance  playing Jean Carrack, Willis' former partner, for the first half of the movie it's a badly kept secret that she's actually the villain. Part of the reason it is so badly kept is that Weaver plays the role as a villain from the get go. It's not that's she not a believable villain, she mostly plays villains these days, and it is certainty not that she can't pull off action roles. It is just such a badly written role that she has no idea what to do with it, she is saddled with some of the movie's worst dialogue, but also gets it's biggest laughs.  Then before it is all over, Weaver manages to morph into an unstoppable terminatrax.
 The seemingly endless car chases are at least givinen a little spunk by Valerio Bonelli's crisp editing which at least has trepidation if not suspense or successful audience involvement. Likewise Lucas Vidal's score does more to highlight the movie's lack of tension than to underline it.
 This kind of trite will only appeal to the least discriminating of action movie spectators, like last year's turkey Killer Elite. This one lacks the exhilarating spirit of earlier, much beloved action adventures, it's tedious and horribly boring too boot. This all goes on for what seems like hours, but in all actuality is just over ninety minutes. Once Willis exits the movie, at about the twenty or thirty minute mark, however, many viewers will find little to further their interest. If the Cold Light of Day proves anything it's that Cavill is no substitute for Bruce Willis.

When his families boat gets close to a town he heads in for supplies. When he comes back to the boat he finds his family gone and also finds some uncooperative police. It is now up to him alone to find and rescue his family. After the last few movies that Bruce Willis has made I had an expectation for this going in. I was right. Pretty much just a cookie cutter action movie that he is in for about five minutes. That said the movie was pretty entertaining and I did enjoy it. Nothing really all that gripping or original but it does have a decent story line and enough action to keep you watching. If you liked the movies ""Catch .44"" or ""Fire With Fire"" then you will like this one as well. Overall, nothing amazing but it is entertaining and I enjoyed it enough.

4770252,4,B005LAIHAE,"I saw this in the theater. The car chase in this film is awesome. Yes, Bruce's character gets killed off. That, said it's still fairly good. I tend to disagree with one reviewer, about not taking this film seriously. Also to put Taken on the same level as the Bourne films is unfair. Taken is so much better the Bourne films ever could be. Also, there seems to another story lying beneath the surface if you think for a minute. It seems portray the tenuous relationship that Israel and our country have in real life; and the trust issues that lye therein. There's a nice cameo by Colm Meany (of Star Trek).",1358726400,,606,4.419642857142857

4770346,2,B005LAIHAE,"I watched The Cold Light of Day thinking that it would be a decent / convincing enough thriller with the cast.  Instead, we have a rather un-intriguing passable action film.  Henry Cavill is a pretty stiff actor.  Bruce Willis doesn't get enough screen time.  And Sigourney Weaver - poor woman - ends up as a 3rd rate baddie with a machine gun.  She's a long way from her Alien Ripley days, and whoever thought she could pull this off convincingly should probably have been shot.  What's next for her?  Stop or my Mom will Shoot the Sequel?!

Lots of Henry running around like an NFL running back and getting hurt.  I'm wondering how he will fare as Superman.  A better script would have made this worthwhile!
