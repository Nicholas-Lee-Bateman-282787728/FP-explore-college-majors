It is NOT full of traditional compositional advice for artists. At best, it is intended for other ""craft-artists"" who like the author, posses little talent and even less training.

Examples of her advice:
Crop photos.
Carry a camera. Take lots and lots of shots. Chances are you'll get some references. Crop them too.
Steal ideas from other artists by cropping photos of their work.
Use copyrighted photos of famous people, but crop them, blur the background.
Copy. Crop. Copy. Crop. Crop and copy again.

Are you seeing a theme yet?

She does not stress learning to draw, drawing from life, value-studies, golden section, rule-of-thirds, cruciform, triangular, sketching, sketch diaries, color-harmonies, lost-edges, spacial divisions or ANY other legitimate advice we receive from art colleges and trained artists. Instead, she focuses on ways to imitate ""artistic"" images by ""copping and cropping"" existing images.

Throughout the video, you see examples of her work. One positive thing my painting professor told me about this video; ""This is a great video to show us what NOT to do."" He's right. If you want to see examples of truly AWFUL paintings, this is the source! Occasionally when I visit our local Michael's art-&-craft store for some cheap paper, I see their night-time painting classes in session. This woman paints like the students in those classes.

To understand JUST HOW AWFUL her work is, you need only realize that she looks UP to Steve Miller, a crummy painter in his own right. Just google image-search  ""paintings by Steve Miller"". Make sure you find the so-called ""artist"" not the pop-star singer/guitarist, who also demonstrates very little talent.

Like Steve Miller the singer, Steve Miller the painter is a copy-cat who makes weak imitations of stolen ideas. The fact that she thinks his work is ""awesome"" explains much. Steve Miller the painter copies photographs the same way teenagers render album covers, just as Steve Miller the guitarist steals guitar riffs and plays them without any passion.

What? Is it the heat in Texas or the name Steve Miller? It's too coincidental that two so-called ""artists"" in separate fields BOTH steal ideas, reproduce them poorly AND share the same name. But, I digress...

In addition to the good examples of bad art, we get to see her forced smile under bad makeup in harsh lighting.

You want some artistic advice? Here it is: Never trust a female artist who can't even put on decent makeup.

Between the colorful synthetic blouse and her bleach-blond bouffant with dark roots, we can almost taste her lack of taste. Her brick fireplace with beige trim, value-priced white shelving and carefully-staged tchotchke in the background speaks volumes about her esthetic sensibilities.

In her defense, the hot video lighting may have contributed to her melting makeup and rigid ""dream-catcher"" hair. The poor girl probably never did a video before and was nervous too. She DOES manage to talk her way through it though. Talking is something she is profoundly gifted at, and this video is mainly a record of that ability. She talks... a lot.

As a musician, I find her sing-song nasal vocalization especially irritating as she incessantly hits that F# and F. Somehow, she is able to talk continuously without breathing. From the standpoint of vocal technique, that characteristic is the most amazing talent she has.

From her ceaseless verbal sputum, we learn where she gets some of her ideas. ""From gift stores, greeting card shops and things like that!"" Her favorites books are from the society of illustrators.

It looks like the videographer went to the same school, or at least the same quality of school... the kind where they take your money and teach nothing. Either that or he is, like the author, ""self taught.""

For most of this video, (at least what I could tolerate) she remains framed dead-center, which is in itself a compositional no-no. Although she does not speak loudly (thankfully) her voice is distorted throughout the video. So for the price of admission, you get to see bad composition, bad lighting, and hear poor sound quality too! If you've ever seen those locally produced late-night commercials for car-dealers, you'll know the quality of videography I mean.

That's not all! The music is vapid too! Sickeningly so. Some cousin of hers (I'm guessing) has an acoustic-electric guitar and can fingerpick some chords. Maybe the videographer ""knows a guy with a recording studio who kin make some music for you."" Really, when I think of it, the only music more appropriate for this video would be some mindless repetitive midi sequence with cheezy artificial strings from a 1970's synthesizer. Actually, a soundtrack with a red Farfisa would be an improvement.

At some points in the video (after my second scotch) it became funny. Her pictures are SO bad they are laughable! She makes the kind of folksy crap you see at local art-fairs in small farm towns throughout the midwest... the kind of pictures that are recognizable (because she blatantly copies photos) so that uneducated people think it is ""art.""

""Hey look here at this one Thelma! That there is a cowboy! On a horse! That's a petunia! And this here one is of that blind singer... ol' what's his name! Dang Thelma, look at them there praices! Over a hunert bucks for a paintin! Whoo Doggies! She MUST be good!""

If you are an aspiring artist looking for useful information to improve YOUR paintings, you would do better to get ""Mastering Composition"" by Ian Roberts.

There might be some people who rush to the author's defense in rebutting this scathing review. If you see such rebuttals or any positive reviews of the author's work, you can safely disregard them since they are from ignoramuses with no taste or sense of humor.
