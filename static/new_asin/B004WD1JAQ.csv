The story is told from the point of view not of a vampire, but a ghoul, a mortal who has been injected with vampire blood in order to turn him into an obedient servant. The movie is as visually stylized as a Sin City movie, but the effects are much cheaper and I like them better.",1411776000,2,434,4.240963855421687

8444953,5,B004WD1JAQ,"This film is pretty amazing. I wasn't sure what to expect after reading the reviews, but I was fairly taken with it overall. It had a few problems here and there, but for the most part, I thought this movie was pretty fascinating. So great to see new talent! Reminded me of David Lynch's early work. The main actor looks like a dead ringer for a young DeNiro too.",1322179200,,363,4.27536231884058
8444954,1,B004WD1JAQ,"Once in awhile I take a ""flyer"" on something just based on how it looks and the info.  Sometimes it's a prize, sometimes it's a flop.  ""Sodium Babies"" had a catchy intruiging title and the ad copy made it sound slick.  I found it monotonous and never made it through the entire video.  Thumbs down.",1322179200,,298,4.363636363636363
