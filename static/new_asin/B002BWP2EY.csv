3896252,5,B002BWP2EY,"This season really gets Entourage back on track where as the previous season was a downer for the boys while Vinnie wasn't that mega-star that he used to be.  Everyone watches this show because they wish the story was about them and this season doesn't disappoint.  Vinnie is back to being the star that he is with all the girls vying to be his arm candy.  The boys are starting to do a lot more on their own in this season, almost making it appear as though Vinnie is bothered by being alone, but they still come together as a crew as usual to cap the season.",1259884800,23,560,4.214953271028038
3896253,4,B002BWP2EY,"I enjoy this series about the behind the scenes living for those in the Hollywood rat race. The entourage is everyone who is sustained in Hollywood, in part of in whole, by major Hollywood movie star, Vinnie Chase.  For me personally, the most enjoyable aspect this season was the further depiction of Vinnie's agent Ari Gold (by multiple Emmy winner for this role, Jeremy Piven), his assistant, Lloyd, and the supposedly lesser acting brother, Drama, played by Kevin Dillon.  This is the first time I so fully enjoyed the Drama character but he was given many more dimensions this season.  Those dimensions were more than ably brought out by Dillon, who before this has always toiled in the real life shadow of his own actor brother, Matt Dillon.  I think Kevin Dillon has finally come into his own as an actor. Another thing done by the show that mimics real life is that Kevin Dillon was always the not so spectacular looking brother (to real life Matt) just like his character is to the fictional Vinnie (Adrien Griener).  I applaud the creators for giving us such a richly ironic portrayal.  Lloyd has to do battle this season with Ari to try and make it as an agent himself rather than remaining Ari's eternal assistant.  Ari also has brought in another partner who is hilarious as he almost ruins Ari's business as his marriage comes apart, with both marital partners acting out semi-violently at the agency. This partner almost steals the whole show when he runs his car through his lavish house in order to secure a client (it works!).  I enjoy the other characters less on this show but that is a personal preference which may be entirely different from your own.  All characters on this show have their own loyal followers.

Is it just me or if you don't like it don't comment. What the mentally challenged kid chasing a  dollar on fishing pole are these comments. ""Oww Vince isn't the main star"". ""O the wheels are turning"". Shut the cluck up and sit the front down. Seriously HBO provides the best show ever and you ungrateful sons of birches say(in your best Fran Dresser impersonation"".) "" O it just wasn't enough for me"" . Seriously get hit by a bag of  cliques. Yes I obviously  have avoided obscenities in this review to not only hint on my genuis but as well pay a node to the obviously missed subtle messages in entourage. You are absolute pieces ships. They obviously harp on variety and us weekly taking a stab at ever media outlet but you dumb uneducated people still buy the show and comment again if you don't like it don't freaking comment. This acting, and writing is at the level that no of you ungrateful little funks could touch unless they needed a 9 season series about a fantasizing, overweight, gossip columnist, who has to get his self confidence from trashing quality and work.  I literally hope all the condescending Jack toffs who had the audacity to say and I quote"" show was great but they boys are changing"" "" this season went a in a direction which  where everybody had a coming out party but Vincent"". You dumb mother truckers the show is called Enotrauge not ""Hey I'm a movie star it's about me"" To all these hating motherfockers who left their  negative pass comments  just say  so they could lack off at the review they have written. Yes I purposely changed these words to shown the class I have unlike these other degenrents.

3897825,4,B002BWP2EY,"In season 6, we start to lose the Vince-centricity that started the series; now as each of the others in his Entourage starts to ""break out"", there are fewer episodes that focus on the star himself (we'll see that change soon), so the viewer is treated to ""E""s fractured love life, the meltdown of Andrew Klein, Ari's business maneuverings and ever-rocky personal dealings, Drama's - well - drama, and Turtle forging ahead with his own life in unexpected directions as his romance with a starlet hits the rocks.  Jeffrey Tambor provides a great comic relief at a golf-tournament-from-hell that actually foreshadows many events in episodes to come.  Vince is back ""on top"" after a hit movies and is getting all sorts of offers; viewers are treated to a fantastic ""test drive"" of four Ferraris that almost looks like an advert.  This season also begins the arc with George Segal as Murray Berenson and Scott Caan as a junior agent who comes across as a total jerk as (not-unconsciously) he treads into Ari-level territory of crassness.  The celebrity cameos continue, with appearances by sports stars and legendary businessmen.",1445558400,,1125,5.0

3898157,3,B002BWP2EY,"Lightweight entertainment, no murder or mayhem, an especially fun romp for man-boys, as its all about their bromance and sex talk and  conquests. Jeremy Piven is great in the role of the anti hero  Ari Gold as is Perrey Reeves who plays his wife whose name I don't think we ever know until she gets a potential boyfriend while she and Ari are separated:, the boyfriend is the only one to ever address her by name. Also Constance Zimmer is great as a studio head Dana Gordon and Aris former girl-friend.  Her role is my favorite female one.  The cameo roles of people playing themselves are enjoyable. The boys are just that for the most part.  I love Kevin Dillon, but his characters  anger and ignorance gets old. The actor playing the movie star Vince around whom the show is suppoaedly centered seems the least talented but he's cute. Lots of female nudity, casual sex, and reason to find the entire series misogynistic, but I was drawn too the Hollywood soap opera of it all.",1442016000,,979,4.565714285714286

3898661,5,B002BWP2EY,This was a cool season even though it was one of the later seasons. You see most of the players do more and expand. Even Vince gets better. He was annoying the first 3 seasons. Ari is still the best on this show.,1400630400,,212,3.953488372093023
3898662,4,B002BWP2EY,"Well, the ""boys"" are back in the fast lane. Vinnie Chase hits it big, Turtle gets a girlfriend, E is full of angst, and Johnny Drama frequently steals the show with his over-the-top antics. Ari Gold, super agent, gets a little too mean, a little too bombastic, but he redeems himself at the very end. And that's what his character and the show needed most. Of all the characters, Ari makes the biggest transition. Even Turtle gets a girlfriend, an important Hollywood star herself. So, the characters get to grow a little, if they don't actually grow up. Vince is the one who gets lost in the woods as his friends BEGIN to find lives of their own, at last. The trajectory of the show continues toward ever bigger things, which is a nice turn after the disappointments of the business they all went through in the previous season. Johnny Drama, though, is the best, his character almost turns his back on Hollywood, which any sane person in his position would do. But he shows his true stripes in stunning fashion at the end, and that was the best episode for him, one that really gave his character the depth he needed. Looking forward to Season 7.",1383091200,,1148,4.550724637681159

7 was pretty unwatchable.  There really was nowhere to go thematically or characterwise.)  Anyway, I thought season 6 had the right blend of humor and pathos.  Bravo!!!!!!",1338595200,,424,4.819444444444445

As for the rating of Season 6, I'd say the show is going down hill.  The first few seasons are much better in my opinion, though still a must watch.  For this, I give 'Entourage: The Complete Sixth Season' a 4 out of 5.  Highly recommended.",1325980800,,407,4.569444444444445

3898690,5,B002BWP2EY,"This season had sharp writing (probably the best of the series). The one-liners snap like a whip and no one misses a beat.  Vince is on top again with the Martin Scorcese movie 'Gatsby' and due to a delay with his next movie, it gives Vince some serious downtime.  E has branched out, as he closes his Murphy group and winds up taking a job setup by his ex. Good growth for the E character here.  Drama begins to have problems on his hit show 'Five Towns' as the producer of the show says he will have sex with Turtle's girlfriend (Jaime-Lynn Sigler). This scenario results in some hilarious situations. I don't buy the Turtle/Sigler relationship. The writers weakly explain it as her therapist said that she is 'attracted to losers'. Huh? whatever. A flailing attempt to expand the character of Turtle (when in fact he is a third fiddle character). Just have him drive Vince around and smoke weed, there is nothing more to Turtle than that.  Ari's ego and power increases in this season as does his torturing of the long suffering Lloyd. Great comedic moments between the two here (Ari's reaction on the phone to Lloyd leaving Ari's car after an accident...priceless!)

This is a near flawless season and will probably be the best one of the show's run.",1313366400,,1254,4.63063063063063
3898691,5,B002BWP2EY,"As a rabid Entourage fan (I have watched all the episodes multiple times) this season, as a season is my favorite.  As the Series started and went for the first two seasons, the plot is based around what is going on with Vince, but is really more about the other characters as a group.  The show is about other relationships, over pure ""Hollywood"" fame.

In fact, everyone seems to have interesting stories moving their characters great grounds, except Vince.  Eric's story line in fantastic in this season, as well as uncovering much more about Turtle.  You also get classic Drama, but in a 2.0 way.

Over all well written, greatly shot and keeps you wanting more.  The fame and fortune is merely the vehicle in which these guys get to do cool things (race Ferrari's) and hang out with each other.  The show is about friendship, not Fame and Fortune

A must watch for any Entourage Fans, and TV fanatics.  The actors all portray their characters well in a well written season as a whole, where many of the characters really come into their own.",1312416000,2,1045,4.6

3898738,3,B002BWP2EY,"I've watched Entourage every season and own every season on DVD to this point. Yet, I find myself frustrated with the series, because it seems like the series is just spinning it's wheels.

We've followed Vince and the gang for years now and not really seen any character development outside of E. Season 6 in my eyes was pretty disappointing, but it still required in my collection of the series.

The special features run slim with this season, so I can't justify a review any higher than 3 stars. If you're a fan of the show and dedicated to collecting all the seasons (even if they aren't great), then its an obvious purchase. If you're looking to get into the show, don't let the $20 purchase price sway you - just rent it on Netflix.",1283385600,4,739,4.466666666666667

I loved the plotlines and since it's filmed mostly in LA, I loved the whole concept. But this season, while still good, it is not up to snuff. Vince seems to only be a background character this season. None of the plotlines have revolved totally around him. Turtle has come to the front, about time, and Eric's love life and Drama's career has lots of play, but Vince seemed to just be there for one-liners.

And after the recent tirades by Mel Gibson, which made me sick, the way Ari yelled, screamed and insulted Lloyd sure didn't go down too well with me. Ari spent most of this season yelling his head off, and I never could figure out why he hated Lloyd so much.

You got Matt Dillon's less talented brother who was the drummer in The Doors, the kid from the Married With Children spin-off Unhappily Ever After, the bald guy who got a hair transplant and can't take sushi, the poor man's Benicio Del Toro, and some other actors I've never seen before.  Ironically this cast who couldn't make it in Hollywood made a show about actors who struggle to make it in Hollywood, and voila now they are stars!  Okay to watch if you don't have high expectations.  Picture and sound meet the blu-ray standard, but I can't recommend buying- there's way better shows out there than this, with replay value.",1279152000,3,792,4.549295774647887
3898757,2,B002BWP2EY,"First off, this has been one of my most favorite programs on tv.  Watching this helps you to escape your mundane life for a few minutes and live in a fantasy world few experience.  This was one of those shows people could watch for years without seeing the characters develop and be very content with that.  Sometimes people WANT to see that kind of ""not a care in the world"" attitude.  This season, which adds serious relationships, life reflection and other adult problems takes away from some of the fairy tale which made this show what it is.  Unfortunately, it (and season 5) has become more of a bland weekday soap opera with very limited substance compared to the first 4 seasons.  Subtle hints of the above were tolerable in previous seasons but it's starting to get stale now with the adult theme taking over.  I'll keep watching until the end, but I wish they would have stuck with the recipe that made me watch in the first place.  HBO is definitely milking the popularity for all it's worth, but I have a feeling the viewers will revolt soon.  I predict Season 8 will be the last at this rate.

The quality was equivalent to DVD resolution, it wasn't sharp at all. Ari's character seems more mean than sarcastic and they even made Eric sound like Ari. Not for anything but there can only be one Ari Gold. This season pretty much set up future seasons of Entourage, but it could have been a little more dynamic. Eric finds himself struggling to get in Sloane's pants all season and also find's himself caught up with some little barely legal chick. I have to also say that the whole crew including Ari are not aging well at all. The previous seasons of Entourage have been pretty original and maybe they set the bar a little to high, but for now I have to say you maybe very disappointed.",1278633600,8,837,4.2375

3898760,4,B002BWP2EY,"As the title suggests, season six develops in a manner much different than previous seasons. Yet while these changes stray from the normal theme of Entourage, the results still provide an entertaining, well written television season.

This change of direction exists to the benefit of the show's other main characters, who are given the opportunity to develop and shine on their own. Ordinarily, Vince is the center of attention, with the main story arc centered around him and his career. With season six, however, ""Vince drama"" is limited only to the first few episodes. The grand premiere of ""Gatsby,"" Vince's latest movie, gives viewers the impression that the film is a success. Apart from that, very little screen time is dedicated to Vince's career. In one episode, we learn that the start date for filming Vince's latest movie has been significantly delayed; this is perhaps a not so subtle hint by the show's writers that attention to Vince will be delayed too.

In the meantime, Eric undergoes a career transformation that better allows him to emerge from under the ""Vincent Chase shadow."" This story line is enjoyable and shows Eric's potential as a professional talent manager in a top-notch firm. Conversely, Eric's other main story line, his relationship with his neighbor Ashley, proves to be irritating, and is the season's weak point.

Drama, my favorite character, undergoes a similar career transformation throughout the season, and his character holds much promise for next season. Kevin Dillon's acting is spot-on as usual, providing both hilarity and emotional depth.

Turtle undergoes the biggest character transformation of all, shedding the slacker, unmotivated image he has held throughout the series. This is easily Jerry Ferrara's best season acting wise, and hopefully he will continue to progress as a character.

Ari is Ari, as usual, and his relationship with Lloyd takes center stage; both characters are poised for big things in season seven.

Why only four stars? With the change in focus of its main story line, season six loses much of its fast-paced nature, instead relying heavily on character relationships and dialogue without much action. Many of these scenes can be slow and leave much to be desired. Further, some of the main story arcs grow cumbersome; Eric's relationship with Ashley and Vince's stalker are two glaring examples.

Despite these deficits, beautiful locations, hilarious dialogue, entertaining story lines for the shows ""other"" characters, and quality cameos make this season one not to be missed.",1278374400,,2558,5.23960880195599

We watched an episode and were hooked!  The show intrigued us because he was about a group of guys who were buds since they were kids.  The writing was excellent and the characters they selected to play role seemed to be a good fit.  The cast seem to bond together thru the highs of the good times as well as the low ones.  My son & I are now the proud owners of all the DVD sets from Entourage's TV run.",1278374400,,655,4.0310077519379846
3898762,3,B002BWP2EY,"Season Six of HBO's ""Entourage"" really rests on its laurels. This season is probably the worst of them all, next to Season One. While that might sound like harsh criticism, it's really not all that bad- it's just a step down in quality compared to Season Four and Five's sheer brilliance. Season Six is all about relationships- which is great, but too bad none of them are all that interesting. Eric's storyline with Ashley is just plain annoying, but thankfully it's redeemed with a late season turn with Sloan back in the picture. Ari is still Ari, but his story lines make him out to be just plain mean, rather than sweet with an angry side as depicted in earlier seasons. Vince, the main character, is left out to dry with a storyline about a stalker that goes absolutely nowhere... and that's about it. He has sex a lot and the scenes do push the limit. Turtle walks away with the best depicted relationship and his scenes with Jamie-Lynn Sigler are sweet and honest. Drama wines a lot and acts like a fool per usual, but where they leave his character at the end, makes it worth it. The season is saved by a relaxed pace, wit, great cinematography, plenty of star cameos and the characters are still as likable as ever. Those elements will never go away but when the cast has great story lines to work with (like in Season's Four and Five) all those ever present positives are enhanced to genius. ""Entourage"" is still, in whole, one of the best shows on TV and Season Six may be a sidestep into the boring, but the finale (like Season One's) promises better tomorrows. Season Six is pretty lazy to tell you truth, but if you are a fan of the show, it's certainly still worth watching. I doubt this will win over any converts.

This Season Six set includes the episodes:
- Drive
- Amongst Friends
- One Car, Two Car, Red Car, Blue Car
- Running on E
- Fore!
- Murphy's Lie
- No More Drama
- The Sorkin Notes
- Security Briefs
- Berried Alive
- Scared Straight

3898763,3,B002BWP2EY,"This season was a real downturn in quality. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything like the previous seasons. Vince is a non-entity in the season. And all the other characters are basically involved in their own disconnected subplots. We get tons of relationship filler for Turtle and E. Drama was there alot but didn't do much. And the bulk of the show ended up focused on Ari and Lloyd which had really kind of run its course already. They (again) basically neglected the idea of Eric being a manager in favor of putting Sloan into every episode.

They managed to get wrong almost everything that entourage had previously got right. The show is entourage. It works when it focuses on the guys together and how they interact. Turning it into a personal growth and relationship show is a very bad idea. There were also too much celebrity cameos that were forced in and had nothing to do with the plot. And no more Matt Daemon in the show ever!",1277856000,5,942,4.541176470588235

3898767,4,B002BWP2EY,"In the past two days, I watched this particular season of Entourage from start to finish and came away impressed.

In the past few seasons, there have been some excellent story arcs, but rarely (outside of Ari Gold) any character development, nor any substantial change in the characters' status. In this season, nearly every major character's life changes for better or for worse.

It seems that the writers, particularly Ally Musika, have made a concerted effort to ensure that the series starts moving forward at a quicker pace.

The addition of Gary Cole to the cast (starring as an agent in Ari Gold's agency) injected some much-needed drama into the script. Cole's character, Andrew Klein, is a paradox - he's a magnetic rainmaker whom, unlike Ari, has absolutely no sense of self-preservation. Klein, either consciously or unconsciously, does everything he can to undermine his reputation, his personal life and his self-esteem.  Simultaneously, he does everything he can to validate all of the sacrifices Ari made to bring him into the agency. The internal conflict between his latent self-hatred and his longing to be loved by his peers is fascinating.

This season shows many of the supporting characters attempting to discover who they are - professionally, romantically and philosophically. Johnny Drama, Turtle and Lloyd are all given more to do than they have in past seasons and this is a good thing. Lloyd has to decide whether or not to remain in Ari Gold's manically paternalistic shadow or stake his own claim. Drama, in the midst of a career revival, struggles to control the strange impulses that have damaged his career over and over again. Turtle is a doubly-kept man - the star, Vincent Chase, has always ""had his back"" and his girlfriend, Jamie Lynn Siegler, a star in her own right, has shielded Turtle from the ""real world"" as well. At age 30, his dilemma is similar to Lloyd's in that he must decide if ""making it on his own"" is truly worth it - Is it better to be a weaker, kept man with all of your needs attended to or a stronger man who may suffer death by a thousand cuts through life myriad setbacks and indignations?  (As an aside, the final two episodes of this season were probably Turtle's dramatic best.)

Without spoiling anything, E's life in this season is shaken in every conceivable way imaginable. In my opinion, he seems to be becoming the person he hates the most - a less educated, less profane (but increasingly as cynical) version of Ari Gold.

My only reservation of this season is the mysterious lack of character development of Vincent Chase. But, perhaps his character is not developing because Vince is not capable of growth. There is a brilliant scene early in the season (where Vince sprawls on a couch like Don Draper from ""Mad Men"") that makes you wonder about his future. While he no longer seems destined to eventually inhabit the same career purgatory of his brother, Drama, there is this developing solitariness to him that we didn't see in prior seasons. It begs the question ""what happens to Vince's Peter Pan when his cadre of Lost Boys grows up and leaves the island of Lost Toys (models, cars, random trips) for the world of grown-ups?"" Does the alluring cipher that is Vincent Chase simply cease to exist? And is it just me or is Vincent Chase's character quiet fade from the show (we seem to see less and less of him evey season) an expression of everyone else's growth and his stunted development?

Obviously, I really enjoyed the season and I hope you do, too!",1277337600,3,3532,4.777049180327869
