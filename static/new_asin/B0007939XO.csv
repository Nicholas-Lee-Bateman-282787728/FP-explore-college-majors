2205291,5,B0007939XO,"Once in awhile, you stumble upon a movie that stays with you long after the credits have rolled. I discovered such a movie in Pit Pony.

This touching film shows the dedication of young Willie MacLean, who must work in the dangerous mines so that his poverty-stricken family doesn't succomb to starvation.  Willie excels in school, but he must leave his education behind to support his family, as he is their only hope. Not only that, but Willie also helps to care for his younger siblings. In the midst of this burden, Willie befriends a pony at the mine, which becomes somewhat like a ray of hope to Willie.

This heartwarming movie is one of my all-time favorites and has no objectionable content. However, it is not for the very young due to scary scenes in the mine and the loss of a loved one. It has several wonderful discussion opportunities, including the importance of courage, doing what's right in the midst of hardship, family loyalty, family unity, responsibility, and treating others with mercy and grace when they least deserve it.  I would highly recommend this movie and have added it to my Mom-Approved Movie Listing on my Wordpress blog.",1317600000,6,1157,4.77
2205292,5,B0007939XO,"Coming from Canada, I have always enjoyed true stories about my country; I also love horses/ponies thus the draw to this story, later made into a delightful series of personal events about the growing-up years of a youth who's family had made their livelihood working in coal mines. The plight of both people and Island ponies is touching, sad at times, joyous at times, reeking of harshness's of realities of life before unions.",1297209600,2,429,4.890410958904109
2205293,5,B0007939XO,"I may be an adult, but this is a lovely lovely movie. Very accurate portrait of the lives of those working in the mines... their families and the hardship of the times.  As an animal lover, I loved the way the movie handled the heroic help that the ponies provided the miners.  A great movie.",1288396800,4,292,4.290909090909091
2205294,5,B0007939XO,"This is another title that our library had on VHS in our old building. Actually, we had a series that's now out of print. But since it's book-based, it's good to replace it with a DVD.",1239321600,,184,4.138888888888889
2205295,5,B0007939XO,"What a heartwarming and wonderful movie for the whole family!!  It is a story about a young boy who loves horses and hates the coal mine his father and brother work in.  After his father is injured, the boy has no choice but to work in the scary and dangerous coal mine to provide for his family.  He is surprised to see a horse he befriended in the mine,  also.  They work together, and through gloomy times the young boy stays positive.  It makes me appreciate what I have!",1206921600,7,475,4.280898876404494
2205296,4,B0007939XO,"Set in the turn of the 19th century, on the island of Nova Scotia. It's about an Irish-Scottish coal mining family and the hardships they face. It's very realistic in it's portrayal of home life of that period...and a nice performance by the young lady playing the oldest daughter (who just happens to look a lot like Megan Follows).

It's not really a typical horse film, and definately not for the tiny tots, but it is an enjoyable and worthwhile family film for anyone above the age of 8. There are some mature and scary themes, including death of family members (One body being displayed on the kitchen table). So you'll want to use discretion.

 Overall it's not a great film, but it is very well made and well acted. Young boys of ten an older will surely benefit from watching it. As there are some good messages to learn from the story.

**** 4 Stars! Highly recommended.",1132099200,24,879,4.544303797468355

8045989,4,B0007939XO,"Pit Pony (Eric Till, 1997)

I've been trying to figure out how to review Pit Pony, an unassuming little made-for-TV movie that was popular enough to spawn a short-lived TV series. These days, when it is remembered at all (and there is precious little of that), it's because the movie was the first screen appearance of a spunky young actress then credited as Ellen Philpotts-Page. (She has since dropped the Philpotts and gone on to international superstardom.) But even given that, the movie seems to have faded into a kind of obscurity reserved for YA-themed historical-fiction made-for-TV movies. This is criminal, as Pit Pony is a simple tale, brilliantly told, with a top-notch cast and director.

The plot revolves around daily life on a hardscrabble island off the coast of Nova Scotia called Glace Bay at the turn of the century. Specifically, while the main plot points involve young Willie MacLean (Ben Rose-Davis, who never acted again) and the titular pony, who develop a strong bond over the course of the picture, the slice-of-life film is impossible to keep with one person, and so we get to know the facts and foibles of the entire MacLean familyRory (Haven's Richard Donat) and Nellie (Lives of the Saints' Jennie Richmond), dad and mum; irrepressible, happy-go-lucky oldest son John (Hope Springs' Andrew Keilty in his first screen appearance); and sisters Maggie (Page) and Sara (Three Days' Anna Wedolock). The MacLean family have been miners for as long as MacLeans have lived on Glace Bay; that is their lot in life, or so they have always believed. But a visionary elementary school teacher goes to work on convincing Willie, who at ten is already working the mines  as a trapper (one who transports mined coal to the surface; trappers were often children, and thus capable of getting through smaller tunnels adult miners were incapable of traversing), that he's got the brains to be able to leave the dangerous mining life behind and do something with his life that will likely increase his maximum age. But Willie's almost preternatural bond with Gem, one of the mine's pit ponies, keeps him underground while he still pursues his education. Of course, mining being the profession it is, it is only a matter of time until the MacLean family is hit with a personal tragedy or two that makes Willie re-evaluate his position...

Despite this being a slice-of-life movie, Till (perhaps best remembered on the YA front for directing the classic Fraggle Rock) never lets the subplots overwhelm the main story. Keep it simple seems to have been the overarching theme on the set here, and it worked; the action is straightforward, the emotion grows naturally from it, and because of that this is as genuine a movie as you're likely to run across. I cannot recommend this highly enough; if you missed it the first time around, see it at your earliest convenience. ****",1361404800,,2884,4.915811088295688
8045990,5,B0007939XO,"I highly recommend this movie, especially if you have Cape Breton connections-  It certainly shows how difficult coal mining was and how families struggled to survive.",1361404800,,167,5.423076923076923
