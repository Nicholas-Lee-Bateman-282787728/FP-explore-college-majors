8142661,5,B000I0559I,Nighthawk episode: Desert storm from the cockpit of the F-117. One of my favourite documentaries ever. One of the best on the gulf war. The Vietnam episode: I bought this pack for nighthawk but this Vietnam episode was a great find.,1433462400,,232,4.682926829268292

8142663,5,B000I0559I,"Have watched the shows on this DVD so many times and love it. Great lessons, interviews and historical details that I didn't know before but I learned watching the show. It might be a bit old cuz it was produced in early 1990s but still relevant. Highly recommended",1223078400,2,265,4.541666666666667
