3623205,5,B001H5X6OE,"This story has some of the same flavor as ""A Grandpa for Christmas.""

Tom Bosley is his usual wonderfully warm and wise self as he relates to his spunky and spicy granddaughter, played by Jordy Benattar. Actually, he is raising her in the emotional and often physical absence of the girl's father, who buries himself in his work to avoid dealing with his heartbreak over losing his wife.

I don't want to give away any more details and spoil the movie for those who may want to buy it, but this movie is truly heartwarming and a real tear-jerker. It is well worth your money. BUY IT!",1228521600,8,583,4.4392523364485985

3623223,5,B001H5X6OE,"The entire film is a learning experience of growing together through the years as a family...no matter the circumstances.  It has the wisdom of  a dedicated grandparent, the ups and downs of an early adolescent, the struggles that a single parent has who can't face his loss, and the reality of facing life and finally death. There is laughter; there are tears and it is not easy to forget the loving tie throughout the film.",1368144000,,425,4.653333333333333
3623224,5,B001H5X6OE,"This is a warm and wonderful film. I must say that the little girl didn't appeal to me very much, but it wasn't her acting, it was the character in and of itself. Regardless of why she was that way in the film, I have trouble accepting a know-it-all child, and that made it all the more difficult to feel very much emotion for her ordeal. At any rate, Tom Bosley is the star of this film, rightly so, and it's a good watch on a nice Sunday afternoon.",1362873600,,450,4.067415730337078

8307938,5,B001H5X6OE,"An excellent movie, well acted by all. Strange to say, but in my view the two outstanding performers were the oldest and youngest. I would recommend this to all. movie/film buffs. All concerned with Charlie and Me, deserve a great pat on the back. It was by far superior to some of the rubbish turned out as entertainment.",1523491200,,322,4.568965517241379

8307945,5,B001H5X6OE,"It was the hallmark channel where I first saw this wonderful heart warming story. Yet this movie has a sad theme, there are many parts that make you smile. As my own father would say "" time is the only thing we can' ever get back."" Many people did not like character of the father yet I felt his role was just perfect as the distant father & son.  This movie can be enjoined at just about any age group.",1432944000,,403,4.0375
