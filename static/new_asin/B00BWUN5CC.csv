5679828,5,B00BWUN5CC,I was happy to find both of these movies together and at a very reasonable price.  Star Trek is always awesome.,1401926400,,111,4.285714285714286
5679829,5,B00BWUN5CC,"The worst was, naturally, the Shatner-directed Star Trek V.  Second-worst Star Trek the Motion Picture is dragged down by a post-production flood of visual special effects tied to Roddenberry's unforgiveable plagiarization of his TV show writer's scripts, especially the Nomad episode.  Then Roddenberry was kicked upstairs and the way cleared for The Wrath of Khan, best of the Star Trek movies with the incomparable Ricardo Montalban returning as the arrogant Kahn Noonian Singh, seeking revenge at all costs against now-Admiral Kirk.  I know ST1 sucks rocks and ST2, however good, is an old movie, but any fan of Star Trek has to have both and there is no better way than in this single collection of both.",1395446400,,709,5.042735042735043
5679830,4,B00BWUN5CC,"Star Trek 1:The Motion Picture

When a destructive space entity is spotted approaching Earth, Admiral Kirk resumes command of the Starship Enterprise to intercept, examine, and stop it. Will the Enterprise stop it in time?
My review:To be completely honest, even though I loved the film and was glad to see the whole crew back in fine form, I really hated how the film got off to such a slow start. So slow, in fact, that- by the time it did get rolling- the film was over. Despite that, though, Star Trek: The Motion Picture is great ST storytelling that builds a strong foundation for the rest of the film series.

Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan

Admiral Kirk's midlife crisis is interrupted by the return of an old enemy, Khan, who's looking for revenge and a potentially destructive device.
My review:Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan is my favorite film out of the whole series of films. Of course, it's probably every ST fans favorite film and with good cause. There's lots of character, plot, action and special effects that all together makes this a great and fun Star Trek film. Definitely one that every Trek fan should view. I LOVE it!

Overall review:This double feature is worth purchasing at its' asking price and worth adding to your collection of Trek shows and films. I'm greatly satisfied with my purchase.",1370995200,,1319,4.672413793103448
5679831,5,B00BWUN5CC,"Having both movies together is great; Star Trek I was terrible except for the special effects, and Star Trek II has a great story. Its like getting Star Trek I for free.",1478649600,,169,4.3125

5679833,4,B00BWUN5CC,"Star Trek II is probably my favorite movie made with the original television series actors.  Star Trek I is my least favorite movie of this series.  I remember looking forward to going to the movie theater to see Star Trek I:  The Motion Picture, was I ever disappointed.  I kept hoping it would get better as it dragged on, but it never did.  I have never watched it again over all of these years, until I purchased it recently.  I almost did not watch it even now, but I did and it was better to me the second time around.  I think the anticipation of seeing the movie after all the years from the time the original TV series had been of the air had me expecting something really great, which it was not and still is not.  But having said that in combination with Star Trek II and the low price of this double feature it is well worth the purchasing.",1451606400,,852,4.216049382716049

5679835,5,B00BWUN5CC,"Excellent buy for the first 2 original Star Trek movies.  There are English subtitles for the hearing impaired and a couple of extras.

I had not seen either of these movies in probably 20 years.  The first one drags a little (to me) at the beginning as they seemed to spend too much time showing the ""new"" Enterprise (and too much music).  But after that it picked up. (I found the sound effects a bit annoying.)  Wrath of Khan still holds up well (and to me) was better than the first one.",1434412800,,491,4.293478260869565
