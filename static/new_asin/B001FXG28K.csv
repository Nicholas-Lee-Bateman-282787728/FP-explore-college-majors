3589503,2,B001FXG28K,"I ALREADY OWN THE LARGE SCHOLASTIC COLLECTION, AND ASSUMED THIS SMALLER ONE WOULD HAVE NEW MATERIAL. BUT SOME OF THE STORIES ARE REPEATED, THAT IS, DUPLICATED. AND SOME OF THEM ARE PRETTY LAME BY TODAY'S STANDARDS. MIGHT HAVE BEEN ACCEPTABLE IN THE FIFTIES. I'M SADLY DISAPPOINTED. ALSO AT THE MARKETING, WHICH DOES NOT INCLUDE A LIST OF CONTENTS. HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO KNOW WHAT IS INCLUDED AND NOT INCLUDED? STILL AM LOOKING FOR THE MISSING PIECES IN THE SCHOLASTIC VIDEOS OWN PROMO THAT BEGINS EVERY DISC FROM THE LARGER COLLECTION. SEVERAL CHARACTERS FROM THAT ARE NOT PART OF THAT SET. WHERE ARE THEY? MM CARSON",1277424000,5,617,4.830188679245283

3589506,4,B001FXG28K,"See your children's favorite storybook characters lovingly animated in this series of short films. My girls loved ""Where the Wild Things Are"", ""Blueberries for Sal"" and so many other classics. My only reason for giving it four stars is some of the selections are not as good as others or seem peculiarly dated. But the good outweighs the bad and I would highly recommend this to any family of preschool age children.",1243728000,10,416,4.791666666666667

If you are a teacher or a school this DVD does not come with performance rights, meaning you cannot show this DVD in a classroom or any public place.
