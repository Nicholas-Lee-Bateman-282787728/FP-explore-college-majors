8168331,3,B00000F6HR,"If you're looking for a collection of Russian ballet at its best, the
""Russian Ballet - The Glorious Tradition"" series is a better
bet.  But this video is a find if you're interested in recent ballet
history.  This archive of 70 years of performances by the Bolshoi
opens with the sublime--Galina Ulanova and Vladimir Preobrazhensky in
Chopiniana (Les Sylphides).  It is followed by the ridiculous--a 1913
pas de deux danced by early stars Ekaterina Geltzer and Vasili
Tikhomirov, in fine melodramatic, silent movie-era style.  With few
exceptions, however, most of the excerpts display the Bolshoi Ballet
at its best, with performances mostly from the '60s.  The most recent
production shown is a 1984 performance of ""Spartacus"" with
Mukhamedov and Bessmertnova, interspersed with excerpts from the 1968
premiere, starring the great Vladimir Vasiliev and Ekaterina Maximova.
The final excerpt is from ""The Little Humpbacked Horse""
danced by Maya Plisetskaya and Vasiliev.  Also notable are more
excerpts with Ulanova in her prime; the ""Moskovski Waltz,""
an acrobatic duet that dazzled audiences when the Bolshoi appeared in the
West in the late 1950's; a 1958 student performance by Maximova; a
charming pas de trois danced by 4th year students at the Bolshoi
school, among whom were Maximova and Vasiliev; and an excerpt from
Plisetskaya's debut(!) in Swan Lake.",962064000,14,1364,5.32093023255814
