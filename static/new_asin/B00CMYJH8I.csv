8583661,5,B00CMYJH8I,"This is a great concise video on the election and background of Pope Francis, a.k.a. Jorge Mario Bergoglio SJ. The film is made by Spain-based Goya Productions, with Spanish and dubbed English available as language options on the disc, and has been released in the U.S. on this DVD by Ignatius Press. It is a suitable video for school and for young people.

The video features footage of Pope Benedict's resignation, the conclave in March 2013, and Pope Francis appearing on the balcony upon his election. It also includes footage of the reactions in Argentina and interviews (dubbed in Spanish, but kept mercifully brief) with Spanish Catholic leaders and analysts. Finally, it has photographs of the pope's childhood and rare footage of Pope Francis as a cardinal, preaching the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius to Spanish bishops and preaching in the streets of Buenos Aires. It gives you a sense of the first Jesuit pope's background, passions, and piety.

The documentary is 50 minutes long and quite satisfying in offering a visual presentation of the new pontiff. Of course, the English-language DVD ""Francis: Pope from the Americas"" is a better and more American product, as the dubbed voices in this one mispronounce common English words and strain the ear a bit during interviews. This video, released only a few weeks after the pope's election, also lacks some of the deeper insights which have since emerged from Bergoglio's biography and theological insights. But this video remains a solid overview of our first pope from the Americas, the pope of the poor, even though my favorite documentary on him is know the above-mentioned disc from the Knights of Columbus.",1382140800,8,1680,5.061371841155235
8583662,5,B00CMYJH8I,"Great to learn more about this incredible man and his life of spiritual and material poverty.  He is an example to all and a blessing to any soul who believes in God.

I recommend this to anyone who wants to learn more about this fine Pope.",1379894400,,240,4.195652173913044
8583663,5,B00CMYJH8I,"I felt as if I were with the Holy Father on his travels.  His warmth and sincerity are palpable.  His love for the ""everyday"" man (person) is evident with his every action.",1375228800,3,172,4.34375
