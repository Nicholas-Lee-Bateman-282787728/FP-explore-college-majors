8044187,5,B0006ZP1VM,"I got this DVD to learn hand drumming and I loved it! I played sections of it over and over which gave me time to practice and understand the lessons. Learning correct drumming technique has made a huge difference in the range of sounds I can make on my djembe - from the tiny touches to the deepest bass notes, I now have a much greater understanding of this instrument. Now, I can join a drum circle with confidence! This was an excellent hand drum instructional DVD. I recommend it highly.",1445126400,,492,4.417582417582418
8044188,5,B0006ZP1VM,"This is a response and explanation to Martin Murphy's review of my DVD. I normally would not give my own DVD a review. The traditional ensemble rhythms in this instructional DVD were taught to me in 1985  1987 by Ibrahima Camara, former Musical Director of the Senegal National Ballet.

I have studied the traditional drumming from many Western African ethnic groups. Over my many years of studying and teaching of West African drumming, I have observed that it is a living evolving tradition. For example, the 4/4 time signature version of Kakilambe that I teach on the video, was very popular 30 years ago among  many drummers that I knew.  There is a 12/8 time signature version of Kakilambe which is currently being taught by Guinean drum masters.

One of my teachers of traditional Ghanaian drumming, the Ghanaian master drummer Godwin Agbeli from the Arts Council of Ghana said to me many years ago, when I was asking him about the specific history of a particular traditional rhythm, Oh that rhythm I made up last summer. Now all the groups in Ghana are playing it!

The drumming technique I present in the video is a synthesis of the djembe technique I learned from Ibrahima Camara and my own studying of African drumming technique over many years.  My experience having played with and observed many master djembe drummers over the years, is that there is range of variation in technique among masterful djembe players.

The following two videos are an example of two masterful djembe drummers, M'bemba Bangoura and Michael Markus, showing how they each have a different technique for playing the basic drum strokes on the djembe.

When I teach in a live situation, I offer greater nuances and options for traditional drumming technique than I do on this DVD.",1443398400,7,1958,5.049689440993789
8044189,5,B0006ZP1VM,Great DVD. I really enjoy how they make it so easy to understand. I definitely recommend this DVD.,1428019200,,98,4.5
8044190,1,B0006ZP1VM,"I found this very disappointing. This product demonstrates incorrect hand technique for traditional djembe based on my studies with many African masters from the countries where djembe is a traditional instrument. I have studied kakilambe and aconcon; this dvd presents parts for these traditional rhythms that I have never encountered, and offers no attribution of these rhythms to any traditional source. I hate to say it but this is the least beneficial djembe DVD I have seen; I'm grateful that I got it from Netflix to check it out before purchase and didn't spend money on it.",1363305600,,582,5.010309278350515
8044191,5,B0006ZP1VM,"Steve Leicach is an inspiring teacher and magnificent performer. For those not able to take lessons with him in person, this DVD is a the next best way to learn about Djembe drumming. Wish he'd follow this fine DVD with others such as one about Balaphon playing. To complete the Steve Leicach experience, wouldn't it be grand if he were to record a range of percussion and vocalization pieces, including his own magnificent compositions!",1299974400,2,437,4.918918918918919
