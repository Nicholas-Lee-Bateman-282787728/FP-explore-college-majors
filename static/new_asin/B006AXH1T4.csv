4981927,5,B006AXH1T4,"A friend of mine is a patient of Dr. Binder and recommended this DVD for my sister, who was 8 months pregnant.  I bought it for her as a baby shower gift knowing she wanted to have a ""natural childbirth"" and avoid drugs or epidurals, if possible.  She watched the DVD several times with her husband and they even brought it with them to the hospital.  The midwife, who assisted with the birth, watched it with them and said it was the perfect way to assist in the birthing process and is now recommending it to her clients as well. Needless to say, my sister had a safe and healthy delivery.  She felt that this DVD, and Dr. Binder in specific, were incredibly helpful and soothing to her.  She wound up having a completely natural birth and attributed the lack of pain and ease of delivery to the accupressure and breathing execises they learned from Dr. Binder.",1338768000,4,863,4.471337579617835
4981928,5,B006AXH1T4,"I highly recommend this DVD on Acupressure and breathing techniques for labor.
I am a childbirth educator, and I use this DVD in my class. Because of the way Laurie Binder presents the information, it makes it clear on the ways a woman and her partner can support the natural process of labor.
This DVD can be used during labor, and it will be very helpful.
Laurie Binder's voice and manner is so calming, in addition to all the instructive information, the DVD is amazing and reassuring for a woman who is preparing for labor and birth.",1336694400,,537,4.546391752577319
4981929,5,B006AXH1T4,"I started acupuncture sessions with Laurie shortly before undergoing an IVF cycle in the hopes it would increase our chances of success. I am happy to say the IVF worked first time and I am very confident that the acupuncture sessions I had with Laurie before and after egg retrieval and transfer played a large part in our success. I continued to see Laurie weekly throughout my pregnancy, working on several factors from holding and calming points to treatment for back and rib pain. Her knowledge of pregnancy related ailments and  their treatment using acupuncture really helped me stay active during my pregnancy. Later in my pregnancy we discussed acupressure for pain relief and more effective labor. I used Laurie's DVD 'Acupressure and Breathing in Childbirth' during my labor and had all the nurses surprised that I was in very little pain even though the monitor was showing strong contractions! The great thing about the DVD is that it is very calming, easy to follow and gave me something visual to focus on while copying the breathing techniques and it allowed my husband to be involved in the labor process by following the DVD and finding the correct pressure points on me that he could press to help with pain relief and help get the baby moving downwards. He was also very happy to be doing something useful during this time! I am so glad I had the opportunity to use this DVD and I would highly recommend it to anyone preparing to give birth whether naturally or medicated. It really is an invaluable tool and I will definitely use it again when we have baby no. 2! I cannot recommend Laurie highly enough. She is wonderful! Thank you Laurie!",1333843200,2,1661,4.727586206896552
4981930,5,B006AXH1T4,"I really believe these accupressure points helped lessen the pain of my contractions (esp. the sacrum points!) The instructions are very simple and easy to understand. My husband did a great job administering these points during labor. (Even though I knew I wanted to get an epidural, I was able to go to 6cm before I rec'd it; the anesthesiologist thought it was pretty impressive that I made it that far w/out any drugs.) Definitely worth it for us.",1333411200,,451,4.7215189873417724
8495855,5,B006AXH1T4,"This DVD is a great value to any pregnant mother. It provides succinct information that you need to know and not a lot of wasted time like other childbirth prep videos. I watched it several times, practiced the points and understood them.
I also enjoyed all the helpful childbirth information. I feel confident that I'll be able to use most of the info when I go into labor (I hope! ;)...
Thumbs up......",1382572800,,404,4.5479452054794525
8495856,1,B006AXH1T4,If I could put zero stars I would. Lasted 2 minutes. Not what I expected at all.  Do not waste your money,1378857600,,105,3.772727272727273
8495857,2,B006AXH1T4,I bought this for my daughter and should have paid more attention to the video length - 20 minutes.  Very little information or demonstrations on breathing techniques before or during labor.  Very little information on what the acuppressure points demonstrated were supposed to do. Sorry but not recommended for the cost and lack of content.,1371254400,,341,5.181818181818182
8495858,5,B006AXH1T4,"I thought that this dvd might be some sort of scam, since it was so short and more expensive than most. It's a cheaply made video, but is actually very helpful. I have extremely long and intense labors and have never been able to go completely natural, because the pain went on for so long. This video finally helped me get over the hump and make it through the entire process of my fourth labor. My husband was such a trooper and watched and practiced this dvd for weeks.",1369094400,3,472,4.314606741573034
8495859,3,B006AXH1T4,Overall I though the video was ok. I was expecting it to be more like a birthing class than a how to... for acupressure. The video is less than 30min and while it has some good information. It did not leave me feeling like I could have the baby tomorrow and be completely ready for what childbirth will be like.,1362096000,,311,4.2
8495860,2,B006AXH1T4,It was not what I expected and mostly focuses on the acupressure part instead of the breathing.  Good if you want that.,1359590400,,119,4.409090909090909
8495861,1,B006AXH1T4,"The first thing I'll say is that the woman who hosts the video seems very knowledgable and warm. THAT SAID, I feel it is completely dishonest and unethical to price a DVD that is literally less than 20 minutes long (with credits that last more than 2 minutes) for more than $10 or $15. If this was included in the product description, I sure missed it. My husband and I were really looking forward to getting at least an hour's worth of tips at this price to help prepare us for labor.

If you are looking for a very brief primer on acupressure points (anyone who has taken yoga will already know the breathing technicques), then this may help you, but just be forewarned that it is 17 minutes long.",1357603200,4,699,4.376923076923077
8495862,2,B006AXH1T4,This video did very little to prepare us for labor and delivery. A few pressure points were mentioned but it all seemed rather random.,1357430400,,134,4.625
8495863,1,B006AXH1T4,"This DVD is NOT what I thought it would be.  I thought this would give my husband and myself techniques to use in labor.  While she does provide acupressure points, I honestly don't think we will be able to remember all of these when the time comes.  The breathing section was a total waste of time.  All of this can be googled and you don't need to spend the money or the time watching this video.  If you are strictly looking for someone to show you a couple points to press, this video is for you  If you are looking for a more in depth video to help you are your partner through out labor, I would try to find something else. I'm so disappointed I wasted my money!!!",1357257600,,670,4.155038759689923
8495864,5,B006AXH1T4,"My husband and I watched Dr. Laurel Binder's DVD in preparation for labor and delivery.  The DVD provides easy to follow, effective instruction on using acupressure both to progress labor and to manage the pain of labor.  I highly recommend the DVD.",1342656000,,249,4.904761904761905
