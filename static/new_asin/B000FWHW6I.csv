2593001,4,B000FWHW6I,"Good story, but somehow it didn't ""feel"" like an Arthur show. Also I think certain parts did run on a little too long. But the entire gang is here and any Arthur fan should like seeing this!",1159488000,,190,4.162162162162162
2593002,5,B000FWHW6I,"We taped this from PBS and soon our tape will wear out and the DVD will be in our home. My daughter loves this movie and in true toodler style wants to see it again and again!!! My father actually groaned and got off of the sofa and left the room because we'd played it so much!!!! (an added benefit???) :) I agree that the dog chase scene is a little scary, she clutches my legs but still peeks at the screen; but, it's not too scary and it all works out in the end. :) We LOVE Arthur!!!",1158105600,5,488,3.9393939393939394
2593003,5,B000FWHW6I,"We caught this movie on PBS when it first came on, and my daughter was hooked.  It's a change from the regular Arthur animation - this one is computer animated.  She was very intrigued by that fact, and then the story is about a puppy... well there you go!  The story is well written, a little scary at times when the guard dogs are chasing after Pal.  There are even a few catchy tunes as well.  Highly recommend this to every Arthur fan out there!",1157414400,5,449,4.235294117647059
2593004,5,B000FWHW6I,"This is the first (and as far as I know, the only) feature length Arthur movie. It's done in computer animation, not like the tradition 2D animation that makes up the show. Unlike what some other reviewers have stated I actually think the animation is quite good - especially compared to other direct-to-dvd movies I've seen. And believe me, I've see a bunch. My 4 year old tears through these things and this one is definitely at the top in terms of quality.

The story line is a lot of fun and it's got all the great characters from the show. Overall, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this movie to anyone. And for the dedicated Arthur fan it's a must have!",1251417600,,659,4.446280991735537
2593005,5,B000FWHW6I,I got this DVD for my 4 year old and he loves it! We have to watch it each and every night or he has a fit. We even watched another Arthur dvd since we got this one but he prefers Missing Pal. The computer animation is awesome and the colors come to life! Plus the story line is very cute - we both love it.,1240444800,,307,3.6666666666666665
2593006,5,B000FWHW6I,Very entertaining. But Pal does not talk like he would in the PBS T.V. show.,1232668800,,76,4.133333333333334
2593007,3,B000FWHW6I,"This movie manages to bring together all the great things everybody enjoys about the ""Arthur"" series.  There are nods to DW's obsession with ""Mary Moo Cow"", Buster's annoying quirks, and Arthur's ""Charlie Brown"" personality.  Pure and simple, this is ""Arthur"".  If you typically enjoy watching the ""Arthur"" cartoon series with your children, you can probably manage to enjoy this movie.

Although the voice-acting is as superb as it is in the original animated series, the animation in this film is quite different.  This film is computer animated.  Although I typically enjoy computer-animated films, the animation in this film is somewhat sub-standard.  It is very similar to the children's series ""Backyardigans"".  It is a 3-D environment, but things move very slowly, are not highly detailed, and in general appear very much like a ""video game"".  It might be interesting seeing Arthur's world in 3D animation, but it detracts slightly from the original feel of the series.  For fans of the original series, it will take some time adjusting to this.  The characters don't have that ""fluffy"" quality -- they appear to be plastic.

Putting that point aside, this movie is a good family movie. It is short enough for short attention spans, and short enough so as not to bore parents to tears.  The story is enjoyable, and you won't regret watching it a few times with your children.",1218672000,,1382,5.008771929824562
2593008,5,B000FWHW6I,"My 5 year old rented this movie 3 times from the local video store, and then I bought it.  It is a cute movie for her and my 7 year old. Movie was new and in great condition.",1215388800,,174,3.5789473684210527
2593009,5,B000FWHW6I,"If you love Arthur and dogs, you will love this movie. Our kids ages 3,4,5 and 6 watch it over and over and over. Cute songs too!!",1199577600,,130,3.8518518518518516
2593010,2,B000FWHW6I,"As an avid fan of the Arthur television series, I found his first CGI movie to be very disappointing.  The pace of the story was rather slow and uninspired, and it looked more like a computer game than an animated movie.  A lot of the clever and humerous dialog I expect from the series is strangely absent.  I recommend instead, Arthur:  It's Only Rock 'n Roll, which is my favorite Arthur special.",1165017600,8,399,4.5
2593011,5,B000FWHW6I,"Wow, we really enjoyed 'Arthur's Missing Pal'. As always, Arthur comes through with teaching appropriate behavior in the form of responsibility. The movie was exciting to watch and had many plot twists to keep the entire family interested. We have watched it again and again. D.W. steals the show and is absolutely hilarious. My kids always mimick her dialogue and her actions! A true treat for the entire family

Thank You PBS",1161129600,2,427,4.930555555555555
2593012,3,B000FWHW6I,"Follow the clues with Arthur on an exciting trail to find his missing dog Pal in this first-ever movie, featuring all new CGI animation. You'll join Arthur and his whole crew of best friends, including Buster Baxter, Binky Barns, Francine, Brain and Muffy. Arthur's parents and sister, D.W., also figure prominently in this DVD. Buster dusts off his hold detective gear in order to solve the case--so get ready to uncover the secrets of Arthur's missing dog!

From an adult standpoint, the Arthur series on PBS is clever and downright hilarious. I can't tell you how many times my husband and I have caught ourselves sitting down watching this show!

When my son saw Arthur's Missing Pal advertised on PBS, he of course wanted the DVD when it came out.

I bought it for him and he watched it a few times--but then he hasn't brought it out again. (To be fair, he goes through seasons with his DVD's--often watching ""old favorites"" out of the blue...)

I watched Arthur's Missing Pal with my son, and it was weird; it didn't ""feel"" like the animated show and it lacked the cleverness I've come to expect from this series. Even the ""dream"" sequences seemed uninspired. The CGI was so-so, with something being lost in the translation from animation to computer rendering. Although I recognized everyone, it didn't seem like the gang as envisioned by Marc Brown!

Fans of Arthur will probably enjoy this DVD, but I can't help but feel the animated DVDs/videos are a lot better (but this is from an adult point of view, of course.) I don't think Arthur's Missing Pal is worth more than $10; in my opinion, parents/adults are better off ordering animated Arthur DVDs which often include 3 or more episodes. (The Boy With His Head in the Clouds is a recent favorite of my son, as is Arthur's Perfect Christmas, Arthur's Double Dare and Aruthur's Celebration.)",1160956800,6,1851,4.753894080996885

8127530,5,B000FWHW6I,such a great movie! I saw it on a commercial and thr munchkin I nanny for wanted it.  Now it will be around for the next set of kids!,1399939200,,133,3.586206896551724
8127531,1,B000FWHW6I,"I had such hope with this movie.  I love Arthur.  I grew up watching the show and I still watch it to this day as an adult.  I was really happy to hear that Arthur will make a jump from 2D animation to CGI animation with this new movie.  Although it was nice to see the new look, the movie itself is an insult to Arthur fans.

This movie is the perfect example of what Arthur looks like in the wrong hands.  The TV show is filled with a lot of heart and a lot of humor.  It's one of those rare shows that adults and kids can enjoy.  That magic is completely gone from this movie.  This movie is not funny at all and it completely misses the mark.

The weird thing about this movie is that they bring back the same actors who play Arthur's Mom, Arthur's Dad/Binky (they're played by the same guy) and Buster from the TV show, but the rest of the characters are voiced by completely different people.  I couldn't understand this.  Muffy and Francine have been voiced by the same actresses for the past 16 years, yet they couldn't be in the movie?  What makes Arthur so great is how much personality the characters have, but in this movie, the characters have little to no personality at all.  The performances of the new voice actors don't capture their character at all and just come across and annoying and whiny.

Let's not forget to mention that there was already an Arthur episode in the past about Pal running away and this movie reuses the same plot. I couldn't really care less about Pal running away and Arthur spending the entire movie trying to save him.  It becomes very tedious to watch, especially since the movie has no substance and it's already been done before, just in a different way.

I know this is a kids movie, but they should have at least done Arthur some justice.  The only people that I could see liking this movie would be children 6 and under.  Anyone over that age will most likely find the movie boring and uninspiring.  Arthur fans should definitely avoid it because it doesn't capture the essence of the show whatsoever and everything about it is way too childish.",1370563200,2,2096,4.394805194805195
8127532,5,B000FWHW6I,"My son loves his DVD player and movies, and this was one on his list.  Unfortunately, it's already gotten scratched and won't play.  It was fun while it lasted :)",1355270400,,162,4.366666666666666
8127533,4,B000FWHW6I,"Our son had seen a preview of the movie on another kid's DVD.  We finally got it for him for a special occasion.  It has been a great dvd for him.  Our son is at a an age where dvds he once enjoyed, he now finds a character ""scary"".  Arthur's Missing Pal has passed our son's criteria for no scary characters or scenes.  It's a very pleasant semi-detective movie with the message of loving one's pet.",1274486400,,400,4.2105263157894735
8127534,5,B000FWHW6I,Great DVD for the kids - Arthur stories always reinforce life's important lessons and this dvd is no exception,1272240000,,110,4.842105263157895
