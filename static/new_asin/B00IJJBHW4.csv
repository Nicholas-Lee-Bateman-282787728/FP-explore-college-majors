I might have to get the DVDs when they come out once the season ends next week.  This is easily the best series on television right now.",1395705600,24,296,3.8833333333333333

I'm hooked and hope they continue this show with more seasons. It's good quality TV and I don't have to worry about seeing body parts I don't want to see, or hearing language that I don't want to hear.",1395100800,6,357,4.188405797101449

6266144,5,B00IJJBHW4,"When Calls The Heart: Lost and Found is the first episode of a series that began on the Hallmark Channel Jan. 11, 2014. Based on the Canadian West novels of Janette Oke, but not an adaptation of the books. There was also a television movie that debuted last year that tied the 2 together a bit closer. I saw that movie and loved it. It also caused a bit of confusion at the beginning of this dvd for me since there was a change in the lead actress, a new Canadian Mountie, and the ending of the movie had been changed to reflect the new direction the series is taking. Also, a couple of other scenes from the movie had been reused with slight alterations. However, I quickly adapted and quit trying to compare the two.

The drama of a small town coming to grips with the disaster of a mine collapse and the deaths of so many

husbands, fathers, sons, relatives, and friends could easily become maudlin, but there are enough elements of comedy and romance to soften the harsh realities. While Elizabeth and Daniel may be the main focus, the story of the townspeople weaves through this a fascinating drama. The determination of the women to do whatever it takes to support their families and give them options, the children trying to adapt to their loss, and everyone in the town trying to come to terms with their new normal.

 The characters are well developed and each seems to have the determination and strength to get through no matter what comes their way. I do think it a little odd that even the weakest of them aren't more prone to give-up, but this is only episode 1. The character that I thought was the best written was the ""villian"" of the piece...the mine supervisor. There are times when he is does the wrong thing, but I felt that the very nature of his job would make him have to be a bit cold-hearted in making some decisions.

Altogether, really balanced storyline, characters that you will come to care about, delightful scenery, and you are left wanting to know more of the story at the end of the episode. The fact that my grandfather and a couple of uncles were coalminers gave this an additional fascination for me, but would have kept my attention anyway. Not quite a 5 star for me, but certainly a 4.5. I definitely recommend this particular dvd, and I am sure that the others will live up to the hope I have for this series.

Thank you to Edify Media and Word Entertainment for providing me with a copy of this dvd for review purposes. No expectations were given for a good review, and only an honest one was promised.",1394409600,4,2545,4.450643776824034
6266145,4,B00IJJBHW4,"Last week, I reviewed the book, Where Courage Calls, the story of Elizabeth Thatcher after she arrived in Coal Valley to teach school.  I was in a hurry to read it, because I knew I had this movie to watch and review.  Well, I didn't need to hurry.

  Have you heard the old line, ""The names have been changed to protect the innocent""?  Well, in this case, the names were almost the only thing that weren't changed!  Elizabeth was still the new teacher in Coal Valley, and  Jack Thornton was the constable for Coal Valley.  There was a single scene involving chalk dust that was in the book, but that's where the similarity ends.  I thought that this movie was a sequel to the first movie.  I thought the book was a sequel to the first movie.  Maybe they both are but with completely different story lines.  So, if you're a read-the-book then watch the movie person, be forewarned.  You can read about this movie in the official synopsis below.  It is my understanding that this movie is part of the When Calls the Heart television series.

MY THOUGHTS:
Things I liked:
~ The acting was good.
~ Good chemistry between Elizabeth and Jack.
~ Good variety of support characters.
~ Clean family film.
~ No bad language, love scenes, or violence.

Things I didn't like:
~ They didn't follow the book at all.
~ Although the actress playing Elizabeth was good, I didn't like changing the main character. The new Elizabeth was too different in my mind.
~ I found that the women working in the coal mine was a completely unrealistic transfer of 21st century women's behavior to early 20th century women.

The bottom line:
Would I recommend it?  Yes.  It was a film my entire family enjoyed.  I enjoyed it, too, after I realized it was a different story.
Four stars",1394236800,4,1755,4.525477707006369
6266146,5,B00IJJBHW4,"I've been completely addicted to this series since I watched the original movie When Calls The Heart. Then I was excited to learn that the Hallmark Channel had decided to pick this one up as a series and continue the story from best selling author Janette Oke. In this DVD, When Calls The Heart: Lost and Found, we find that Elizabeth Thatcher has left her wealthy and prominent life to journey west to become a teacher in Coal Valley. She believes despite all her father's misgivings she can do what they believe she can't. Armed with nothing more than her clothes and some books, she is soon the victim of a stage coach robbery that leaves her with little more than the clothes on her back. She arrives at the request of the women of Coal Valley that have suffered the loss of their husbands and older children in a mining explosion. Their only hope is that Elizabeth can educate their children so that they don't have to become miners when they grow up.

But Elizabeth isn't at all prepared for what she is hoping for and thus no matter how hard she struggles to fit in, she is more of a challenge than she thinks. From learning to deal with issues that the children are facing to establishing the school in a saloon during the day, there are numerous laughs to be found along the way. Elizabeth's biggest ally is Abigail  Stanton who has lost both her husband and son in the mining explosion. Yet both women persevere despite all the odds against them. Abigail dispenses motherly wisdom to Elizabeth when she feels overcome by the challenges facing her on the frontier and the two become friends.

Jack Thornton arrives as someone Elizabeth's father has hired to watch over his daughter while she insists on taking up the teaching in Coal Valley. Soon the sparks fly between the two even though they fight the attraction brewing between them. Yet after some time, Elizabeth soon discovers that Jack is more than just a friend and the harder they try to fight their romantic feelings the more they each are drawn closer together.

I received When Calls the Heart: Lost and Found compliments of Word Films, The Hallmark Channel and Edify Media Inc for my honest review. I did not receive any monetary compensation for my honest review and the opinions expressed are strictly my own unless otherwise noted. It's so wonderful to know that in a world where choices in television and movie entertainment is becoming challenging for families that a series like When Calls the Heart comes along. Completely suitable for all ages in your family it reminds me of Little House on the Prairie from my own childhood. This series is directed by Michael Landon Jr and produced and written by Brian Bird and will be one that I am sure you will LOVE. My entire family LOVES this series from my youngest daughter at 15 to my husband. This DVD will be the start of an incredible journey for you and your family and one I can easily give a 5 out of 5 stars too!",1394150400,12,2945,4.561436672967864
6266147,5,B00IJJBHW4,I just received this DVD today and could not wait to watch it.  I was somewhat disappointed that it did not go farther in the series.  I hope they will continue it on another DVD. I still enjoyed it very much.,1394064000,2,209,4.073170731707317
6266148,5,B00IJJBHW4,"I love this TV series--wonderful stories, great acting, and a bit of comedy and romance!  And the setting is a Canadian mining town in 1910.  I love period dramas like Little House on the Prairie, Christy, Dr. Quinn--if you enjoy this type of show, I urge you to try When Calls the Heart.  I plan on buying all the dvds!

Note--it does not follow the book ""When Calls the Heart"" by Janette Oke though based on it, but I like these characters even better!",1393804800,17,454,4.369047619047619
6266149,5,B00IJJBHW4,"An Hallmark Channel movie directed by Michael Landon Jr., When Calls The Heart - Lost and Found is inspired by the Janette Oke's best selling series and has all the making of a classic.
What better way to enjoy it therefore than with the whole family, sharing quality time the old fashioned way:TOGETHER!

For those of you who had the opportunity to see 'Little House On The Prairie' produced by Michael's legendary father, I am certain this movie will bring back many souvenirs!

Janette Oke, Michael Langdon Jr. and screen writer Brian Bird make a great team in this latest cooperation, providing viewers with Christian entertainment, a great cast and a change from Hollywood latests!
This is a much needed and greatly refreshing approach to movies which anyone will appreciate!

Anyone who had the opportunity to see the pilot movie (reviewed HERE) will notice a few changes of course in the cast but it still manages to come out 'new' with a different twist in the story as well as in the performances and provides good wholesome values to boot!

Filmed in British Columbia, Canada, it features breathtaking scenery and brings viewers a nostalgic look at life in a remote western town where the Mining Company rules everyone's life, the women fight for their families, the newly hired teacher instills hope in her students and Mounties keep the law!

Thoroughly enjoyable and well worth its 5 stars rating!!

6266173,5,B00IJJBHW4,"VERY GOOD!!! It took me a while to talk myself into trying this, but I'm SO glad I did!!! I LOVE THIS TV SERIES!!! Set in a small coal mining town in Canada, in the early 1900's, this show has a good ""old-fashioned"" charm. Privileged, caring Elizabeth Thatcher comes to Coal Valley to teach, and is quickly faced with the reality of life outside of her sheltered home. She quickly puts her shoulder to the wheel and does her best to help the local women who were widowed by an explosion in the mine. Driving her on is the determination to make it in Coal Valley, partly to prove Constable Jack Thornton wrong in thinking that she is a ""Daddy's girl"" that would run at the first sign of trouble. Jack can't help admiring her spunk, even as he very carefully tries not to fall for her. They gradually realize that they would make more progress helping the community by working together instead of fighting each other. Elizabeth learns the true meaning of ""community"" from the people of Coal Valley.  I have watched this ????? times since I got it from Walmart. This dvd contains the first 2 episodes from the Hallmark tv series. I have recommended it to several friends already. WOULD GLADLY GIVE IT 10 STARS IF I COULD!!! :-)",1410048000,14,1224,4.513513513513513

6266185,5,B00IJJBHW4,"Let me start off by saying that When Calls the Heart is a series on Hallmark Channel and Lost & Found is Episode 1 of 12....That being said, you won't be upset when you buy it and realize that it is only the beginning of a fantastic journey back in time.  When Calls the Heart is set in 1910 in the mining town of Coal Valley.  Elizabeth Thatcher is a young woman of privilege who is just being posted to her 1st teaching assignment.  Jack Thornton is a Mountie who is also newly appointed to his post in Coal Valley.  The people in Coal Valley are hard working, honest folk who are trying to recover from a great tragedy where many of them lost husbands, fathers, and brothers.  When Calls the Heart gives us great insight into what life was like over 100 years ago, often difficult, sometimes a bit primitive, but still so rewarding.  This is an excellent series that can be enjoyed by the entire family.  You won't have to worry about bad language or inappropriate scenes...in fact, I believe you will find the unfolding story of life in Coal Valley to be quite delightful.  Michael Landon, Jr. and Brian Bird put together a top-notch cast and crew for the production of this series and I think that once you arrive in Coal Valley, you will want to return over and over and over again.  As I said, it's one of the best new series I have seen in quite some time!!!",1403654400,,1366,4.346456692913386

6266187,5,B00IJJBHW4,I love this series and hope it continues this fall I love the actors and storyline i have always enjoyed reading books in the 1900's,1401926400,,132,4.32
6266188,5,B00IJJBHW4,"Together, these first two episodes constitute one of the strongest beginnings of a television series that I've ever experienced. This TV series really hits the ground running. Erin Krakow delights as Elizabeth Thatcher, Daniel Lissing intrigues as Constable Jack Thornton, and Lori Loughlin inspires as Abigail Stanton. In addition to instant chemistry, Krakow and Lissing bring a healthy dose of humor to their spirited interplay. Each establishes his or her character early, while lending their respective roles an air of authenticity that encourages viewers to want to get better acquainted with Elizabeth and Jack.

Not only will you enjoy Constable Jack and Miss Thatcher, you'll quickly grow fond of Coal Valley and its residents. It's impossible not to have your heartstrings tugged by the stories of these women widowed by a mining accident who struggle to keep their children safe and happy. You'll root for Elizabeth to earn the respect and trust of the school children, for Constable Jack to uncover the truth behind the mine accident, and for the widows to keep their homes intact and their children happy. Your heart will be buoyed by messages that touch on the importance of sacrifice and service as well as the value of suffering. And most importantly, through watching these lives unfold onscreen, you'll be reminded that with faith, nothing is impossible, and hope is never lost.

Verdict: 5 of 5 stars.  Must-see TV the whole family will love! With a talented cast of actors, gifted writers, and the guiding vision of Michael Landon, Jr. and Brian Bird, this inspiring show and its messages will warm your heart.

It is a show that can be viewed by every member of the family from 2 to 102.  It is based on Janette Oke's books and it will touch your heart!  It has mine.  I recommend this most highly but once you see this one, you will have to have the next one.",1398556800,,425,3.7191011235955056

6266209,5,B00IJJBHW4,I loved this dvd.  I am a Huge When calls the Heart fan.  I would love to get the whole first season on dvd.  I especially like Erin Krakow playing the part of Elizabeth Thatcher better than the original actress in the movie.  I am a huge fan of Lori Loughlin's.  So to see her staring in this was a real pleasure.  If people have not watched When calls the Heart they are missing out on a great show for all ages.,1397779200,2,414,3.9878048780487805

6266211,4,B00IJJBHW4,"Ever since I first read the Love Comes Softly Series as a teen, Ive loved all of Janette Okes books! So when Hallmark starting making series and movies inspired by her books I was excited about it! I learned quickly, however, that inspired by means just thatthese might have the same titles and character names, but the stories in the movies/series are very loosely based on the books. They are great in and of themselves, but if you are expecting a great book to tv adaptation you're going to become disappointed quickly. I learned this with the Love Come Softly movie series, so going into watching When Calls the Heart  Lost & Found DVD I was expecting something similar, and I was right. This DVD is actually the first 2 episodes in the When Calls the Heart Seriesso don't expect the full season. Its just enough to give you a great taste for the series and leaves you wanting more.

The story focuses around Elizabeth Thatchera starry eyed rich girl who goes to a rough and  tumble coal town that just suffered a devastating tragedy and who expects to change the world overnight by being the best teacher to the towns children that she can be. Erin Krakow plays the character well, although some of the mistakes she makes at first are a bit sillyeven for a spoiled rich girl. Also somewhat predictable is the oh-I-hate-you-now-but-you-can-tell-well-fall-in-love-in-the-end storyline between Elizabeth and the one, new, handsome eligible Mountie Jack Thornton; though I will give credit that even just in the first two episodes they work the changes in both directions in a believable and gradual manner, which is better than many movies and books which have a similar situation happen.

Characters like Abigail Stanton add a richness and depth to the plot line, and by the end of the second episode you find yourself pulling for the people of Coal Valley and anxious to see how their stories will play out. The acting was all great and the product value was wonderfullots of gorgeous shots, settings, and costumes.

If you loved the Love Comes Softly movie series or are just looking for some quality, family friendly entertainment then you will very much enjoy this DVD and series!",1397433600,,2187,4.8213333333333335

All I hope is that they keep all the same actors playing the parts Erin and Daniel (Elizabeth and Jack ) are a good choice for the falling in love the right way with courtship learning about each other, counting on each other almost like a knight in shinning armor but better he is a Mountie. This would be a good family movie for young children and will be watched by my grandchildren. This is a Christian home and we care of the values of courtship. this movie should get more than 5 stars. you can count on me to buy the full series as they are presented as I did with the Love come Softly series both great family movies.",1396742400,,946,4.118918918918919
6266219,5,B00IJJBHW4,"** EDIT: Two first season sets have now been released.  One by Millenium Entertainment (4 double sided discs) called the ""When Calls the Heart: Television Movie Collection"" (found in stores at Walmart, Amazon, eBay), and the (10 disc) ""When Calls the Heart: Complete Season 1"" by Word Films (via Fish Flix, Christian Family, Amazon, eBay).**
Filming for season 2 has just commenced in November 2014, and the premier date is set for April 25th.  For more information please check out: HeartiesWCTH.com , the official ""When Calls The Heart"" (TV Show) FB page, as well as the FB ""closed group"" fanpage: ""Fan's of Hallmark's When Calls The Heart"")!**

First off, I haven't read any of the Janette Oke book series this show is named after (although from what I've read, it's not actually based on the namesake's lead characters, but rather a new book spin-off entitled ""Where Courage Calls"").  And I didn't watch the pilot movie beforehand (FYI, the lead actors aren't even the same).

My initial impression/review of ep's 1-4, was a 4 star rating.  But I'm giving the entire season 5 stars, because I feel that the story lines from episodes 5-12 really take off!  Actually, some of the best moments of the season are in those episodes (ep's 9 & 12 are especially phenomenal)!!!
This is my first experience with either lead actor (well, technically Miss Krakow appeared in 1 episode of a show I watch, but I can't recall her performance).
I'm especially amazed at how well Mr. Lissing can conceal his accent, which I'm sure can't be easy!  Also, the chemistry between the leads seems to flow naturally, and doesn't feel contrived (despite the fact their characters get off to a rough start).

If I'm being totally honest, there are a few over dramatic, and somewhat predictable moments (*slight SPOILER*: for instance when the hero ""Jack"" is ALWAYS there to save the day-- seriously, pretty soon they're going to have to sew an ""S"" onto his uniform because he's the Edwardian version of ""Clark Kent""!).
But really, what does that matter when each episode has an underlying positive message, AND it's clean family friendly entertainment (a rarity these days)?!

It's definitely reminiscent of ""Christy"" (one of my favorite, but sadly short-lived TV series in the mid 90's), ""Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman"", and perhaps a little of ""Anne of Green Gables"", or ""Little House on the Prairie"".
My one real complaint, is that music is constantly being played during much of the dialogue and it competes with their voices (so unless you have closed caption on, you might have to replay it, and/or constantly adjust the volume)! Unfortunately, other Hallmark productions have this problem too...

I conclusion, I highly recommend this for anyone who loves this genre, or are who are simply looking for something decent for the whole family to watch!",1396483200,12,2830,4.936842105263158
