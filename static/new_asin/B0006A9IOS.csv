8040948,3,B0006A9IOS,This could of been a lot better movie. I'm big fan of Michael Dudikoff. I think he could of done a lot better than this movie. This was more of a science fiction movie. He is a very handsome man and he could of done better.,1402185600,,223,3.869565217391304
8040949,3,B0006A9IOS,"This also goes by the title of Virtual Assasin, and is a great movie.  Michael Dudikoff does a great job of playing a down and out ex-cop, and Brion James is always a good bad guy.  The movie looks great and the setting, storyline, and effects are all very good.  This is a movie I am glad to have in my collection and I have watched it many times.  If I lost my copy I would definitely seek out another.",1344902400,,404,4.0125
8040950,1,B0006A9IOS,"Being a collector of cyberpunk films, I have come across a lot of garbage. Cyberjack is definitely garbage, even if I have seen worse. It is unbelievable, badly acted and like many failed items of its genre it plays heavily on the audience's supposed irrational fear of computers. This may have been an effective gimmick in the early nineties but these days it is just campy. Production quality reminds me of a poor TV show and the less is said about the story the better. Cyberpunk is a genre easily done wrong and this is one more sorry low-budget attempt to cash into the then-trend with a generic B-action piece. Films like these inevitably pop-up when you are a collector but if you are not, steer clear.",1276560000,2,709,4.590551181102362
