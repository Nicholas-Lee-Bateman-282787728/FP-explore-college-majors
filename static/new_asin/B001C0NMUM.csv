3503442,5,B001C0NMUM,"OMGosh--Everytime Jennifer Galardi comes out with a new DVD, I always think ""Now this one is definitely my favorite!""  But it happened again!  You can't help but have an absolute blast doing this dance!  The moves are unique, incredibly fun, and boy, do I work up a sweat.  Remember when you do dance, the sweat comes when you really accent your moves.  So only I learned it, there was no problem getting a great intermediate workout!",1231286400,11,434,4.657894736842105
3503443,4,B001C0NMUM,"I  like this video because it is lively, has a good beat and is not to hard to keep up with.  A lot of work out videos are just too hard to do.  This one is just right.",1229904000,,168,3.3684210526315788
3503444,5,B001C0NMUM,"Great video!  Easy enough to do, but difficult enough to be interesting.  Not much traditional latin moves, but lots of fun and keeps you moving.",1229817600,,145,4.76
3503445,4,B001C0NMUM,"I've owned a handful of Latin dance fitness DVDs, and this is a nice break from those. The footwork is less complex, it incorporates more arm and upper body moves than most Latin dance DVDs, and it's all low-impact (so it may not be intense enough for intermediate exercisers). There aren't as much traditional Latin dance moves in this as in others - there are more aerobic dance moves. That said, the aerobic components are refreshingly original, without the usual tired, boring morass of chasses, grapevines, and knee lifts. (There's even a quick little move where you pretend to play conga drums.)

You won't need any equipment, but you'll need enough front and back floor space to be able to walk about 4 big (or 8 small steps), and enough space on the sides to take 2 big steps in each direction.

The warm-up and cooldown blend smoothly into the workout itself, so on the downside, there's no menu other than ""Play"" or ""Resume."" And if you're looking to learn traditional Latin dance steps you can take to your cousin's wedding, you'll be disappointed.

Overall, it's sexy, playful and fun, and easy to follow with plenty of cuing.",1228608000,19,1138,4.737373737373737
3503446,5,B001C0NMUM,"Jen is a favourite instructor of mine.  Her routines are fun and energetic and this is the same.  It's an intermediate workout with basic choreography and lowish impact.  It does get your heart rate up a bit and you do sweat a little, but it isn't quite challenging enough for me.
It's a combination of classic aerobics and fun latin moves.  You learn a basic aerobic move, and then she adds the latin flare to it.  I personally have only done this twice but never felt sore or tired as a result of it.  I'd use this on a day where I can't be bothered doing much else but still want to do something.  It's certainly going to burn off some calories, but advanced exercisers won't be overly impressed with this.  Jennifer is motivating and personable like usual, but I hope her next workout will be a little harder and more challenging.",1222905600,30,834,4.440789473684211
3503447,5,B001C0NMUM,You will always feel like dancing and feeling sexy by following this Latin Rhythms and losing weight is easier without you know it.,1331683200,,131,4.739130434782608
3503448,5,B001C0NMUM,"Jennifer is easy to follow, and very consistent with style in all of her workout videos.  That is why I purchase any of hers that I can find.  I have been exercising to workput videos since the Jane Fonda era and there are very few instructors that I return to again and again.  Jennifer is one of them.",1328227200,2,303,4.189655172413793
3503449,5,B001C0NMUM,This is an awesome workout. I also have her ballet dvd which is incredible. I have a lot of her stuff - she is by far the best! =)),1316476800,2,131,3.5517241379310347
3503450,2,B001C0NMUM,"I'm a huge Jennifer Galardi fan and I own almost all of her DVDs... but this one immediately went in the closet with all my other rejected workout videos. I don't know what it is about Crunch, but I just can't get into their DVDs. The music is awful, the cheesy dancers in the background are distracting, and it just makes me want to run and hide from the campiness of it all. Love Jennifer and love working out with her, but I won't be putting this DVD back in the player.",1306022400,4,473,4.1521739130434785
3503451,5,B001C0NMUM,"Jennifer Galardi is one of my all-time favorite instructors.  I have yet to do a video of hers I did not really enjoy.  She is a very good, and talented instructor.  The movements are fun, they are low impact and not hard to learn.  I really like this video and use it time and time again.  Of course, be sure you are cleared by your doctor to do exercise.  However, if you are healthy you will have fun.",1294531200,,404,4.115384615384615
3503452,5,B001C0NMUM,this dvd is the best dance dvd i have ever seen and i have seen alot of of dance dvds.the most fun i have had in along time.,1279584000,,124,3.4642857142857144
3503453,3,B001C0NMUM,"I ordered this DVD because I love the Crunch Cardio Salsa with Giselle Roque de Escobar. Unfortunately this DVD pales in comparison. I like that it is fast-paced and will cause you to work up a sweat, but there is very little latin styling or latin music involved. If you are a die hard latin workout fan like me, get the Crunch Cardio Salso instead, or Lisa Nunziella's 5-day latin dance system. Both are much better than this one.",1271980800,12,432,4.481012658227848
3503454,2,B001C0NMUM,"I am a fan of Jennifer and I like very much all her videos, the ten minute solution with the band and the one without, and the dance off the inches hip hop party. Unfortunately I didn't like the crunch videos and I really prefer the others. I see my level as an intermediate and a bit of a dancer and this wasn't fun to me because I hated the music it seamed that I was in an arena bullfighting instead of being dancing and this videos have also to many people in the background you get distracted when the camera changes from one person to another. I did it all once and by the end of the video I was lost because I was tired to think about the moves and in this one you really need to pay attention. I tried to do it two other times but the music really didn't got me going.",1266537600,7,776,3.949044585987261
3503455,5,B001C0NMUM,Not as much detail with instruction as her other DVDs but I don't need it as I am a retired ballet dancer and pick up movement well. I like this DVD. It was a good workout.,1265414400,,172,3.8055555555555554
3503456,4,B001C0NMUM,"This is a really fun dvd. You learn a lot of steps and forget that you are actually working out until you notice the sweat dripping away. The group in the dvd is fun and Jennifer is very upbeat and cheerful and fun.
I took away 1 star because it is not very easy to pick up the steps in the dvd. I had to rewind and replay each 10 minute section 5 times before I got the hang of it because the actual instruction is short and fast. Once I practiced each segment 5 times I began to get the hang of it and it was really fun. Just keep at it and don't give up; it's worth learning!",1263600000,,578,3.825
3503457,4,B001C0NMUM,"This dvd workout is great if you are very familiar with dance moves and can go quickly as she explains them! The instructor isn't a true teacher and doesn't spend enough time coaching you through the moves by a step-by-step slow pace so that you get the correct posture, footing, and rountine. The instructor starts off quickly to the workout beat with the dances, explaining while quickly keeping to the beat and rhythm, which is ok if your a dancer that's familiar with these moves. I found myself having to pause the dvd in increments in the beginning to get the footing down. This makes the learning process very frustrating to get any heart rate up in the workout until you learn the steps. I would like to see this dvd have an intro section for beginners to learn the steps and patterns then, have another segment for the workout for those who have it down.

With that said, I think it is a very good dance routine to have and I would recommend that if your purchase this, as most any age group up to 60 could participate, be warned that it will take awhile to learn moves & routine before really getting your cardio heart rate up.",1263254400,5,1137,4.440191387559809
3503458,5,B001C0NMUM,My work out routines have to be fun or i give up very easily. I read a number of reviews about this DVD before finally purchasing it. I am having so much fun working out to this DVD. The moves are sexy yet I still get quite a work out by the time am done. The steps are very easy to follow and am also learning some basic latin moves as well. i will be puchasing other latin moves DVDs for variety.,1261958400,,398,3.8658536585365852
3503459,5,B001C0NMUM,"I love Crunch, and I love Jennifer Galardi.  Mix the two together, and you get a great combination.  This is 40 minute workout with a warm-up, three routines, and a cool down.  The warm up is basic and easy, getting your blood flowing and getting you ready to work out.  The first routine seems to be a mixture of Cha-Cha and Samba.  It is my favorite as it is basic but really, really fun.  The second routine appears to be a mixture of Rumba, Cha-Cha, and Samba.  It is the longest, and it is my least favorite.  Jen seems to go from the top way too much, but it is cardio and fun, though slightly too repetitive.  The third one is mainly Merengue with a few other styles of Latin dance mixed in.  It is a little silly with moves such as ""sunshine"" and ""play the bongos.""  The cool-down is fabulous with some small, flowing dance steps and some great stretches.  This is, in my opinion, a perfect workout DVD, but you do have to appreciate Latin dance.  Yes, the middle routine is a little long and monotonous, but I still love this video.  My favorite video by far.",1259798400,,1068,4.301507537688442
3503460,3,B001C0NMUM,This does keep you moving but a little hard to follow the foot steps.  I have no dance experience(just that I like to dance) and find it a little difficult to keep up. As long as it keeps me moving I guess I am good with it.,1250467200,,224,3.765957446808511
3503461,4,B001C0NMUM,"I am a Jennifer Galardi fan because she has a fun and somewhat goofy personality without being annoying.  She is also a very talented dancer and creates really fun and challenging workouts.  As with other of her workouts that I have done the choreography in this one takes some work to master but it is FUN. I have also done a lot of Crunch DVDs.  I own several but I've tried even more then I have bought.  Usually Crunch DVDs strive to make fitness fun.  Sometimes it works.  Sometimes not so much.  This one works.  A word of caution the complexity of the steps may make this one hard for beginners or people with no dance experience to follow and the pace of the workout may not be challenging enough for more advanced fitness enthusiast.  The nice thing about this DVD is that the music is good.  The instructions are clear and there's a lot of room to add your own style and your own interpretation so its easy to make it more fun or more challenging.
A word on format: Unlike a lot of workout DVDs, especially most Crunch ones, this one does not have chapters so it's all or nothing and there are three distinctly different dance routines in addition to the warm up and cool down.  There's plenty of variety in the steps but the way Jennifer teaches is to build on each step so you may feel like you're doing the same move over and over as the steps build up and the routine gets more complex.",1249171200,,1400,4.325670498084291
3503462,1,B001C0NMUM,"I have used lots of other fitness dvds and this one is the pits. It feels more like the instructor is showing off the moves rather trying to get the viewer to do them. There is no learning time for moves, no repeats and definitely non-encouraging. There are tons of fitness videos out there to try..take my advice stay away from this one. The Dance of Inches ""Ballroom dancing"" is excellent so is the Hip Hop party.",1244678400,3,415,4.402597402597403
3503463,2,B001C0NMUM,"When I saw the preview to this video, I thought it looked like something that would be fun and fairly easy to follow. It's Not!  There is absolutely no instruction in how to do the different dance steps involved in the routine.  If you already know Latin dance, you could probably follow, have fun and get a great workout.  But for those who don't, don't waste your money.  The workout team obviously spent a LOT of time learning the routines.",1240531200,4,443,4.5
3503464,5,B001C0NMUM,"Quite one of my favourites.  Fast and fun, good music and Jennifer is the perfect dance instructor.",1238025600,,99,4.823529411764706
3503465,3,B001C0NMUM,I thought the video was good but hoped it to have more actual latin moves and a little more cardio.,1235433600,,99,4.0
3503466,4,B001C0NMUM,"I lost 10 kgs by exercising every morning with the ""Crunch Fitness"" and ""Gotta sweat"" programmes on ESPN several years ago.

Now I am need of losing that weight again so I purchased 3 of the Crunch fitness titles. This is my favourite. As a lover of latin music it certainly encourages me to get up and workout each morning.

I just wish there were Cory Everson would release her ""Gotta Sweat"" programmes on DVD.",1233446400,3,412,4.48

8285527,5,B001C0NMUM,This exercise DVD has you dancing like a star. Jennifer has the mose amazing moves in this Latin Rythems work out. I find myself doing it over and over again. I give this DVD 5 stars. Rena Batiste Daytona Beach Fl,1416268800,,213,4.219512195121951
8285528,3,B001C0NMUM,"This DVD lasts about 38 minutes total.  It has 5 minutes warm up, 28 minutes of OK routines and about 5 minutes cool down and stretching.  They put their knees on the floor for some of the stretching which we don't like to do since we don't have mats, but you can stretch standing (just modify these).  It doesn't show the steps, so that makes it a little hard to follow.  We have done this DVD about 5 times and it's still hard to understand the steps.  Thus, I am rating it 3 stars.  Maybe some day we will get the steps down?",1383004800,,528,4.077669902912621
8285529,5,B001C0NMUM,"Fun work out, it wasn't over the top with complicated Latin moves- which tend to intimidate a beginner like me. I found the moves easy to pick up. Jennifer builds the moves adding one at a time then starting at the beginning again. This one didn't have 'Cardio' in the title but it gets your heart rate up. The moves are really fun too, she keeps reminding you to swing your arms how you like and that helps you let loose.

Crunch videos have some downsides as other mentioned- too many dancers in the background, retro music and zooming it at the wrong times so you loose track of where the dancers are. Even with those draw backs, the dance moves and Jennifer's enthusiasm are so much fun that it totally makes up for it!

I usually go for hip hop themed videos but this one was a pleasant surprise. I really want Jennifer to come out with more Dvds- I have just about all of them!",1365724800,,883,4.281437125748503
8285530,4,B001C0NMUM,"I love doing Jennifer Galardi's hip hop routines. They are a fun, fantastic home-bound workout! I love latin dance as well. But these aren't my favorite latin routines.",1356998400,,168,5.035714285714286
8285531,5,B001C0NMUM,"Crunch has by far the best series of home DVD's for exercising.  I rotate through them almost every day when not going to the gym, and have yet to be disappointed.  The moves are often similar, but the teachers mix it up just enough to ""feel"" like it's different, and it makes for quick, painless exercising.
Jennifer is an excellent instructor, always cheery and enthusiastic but not annoying like some can be.  The routines are easy to learn and fun to do!",1356825600,,458,4.560975609756097
