8647409,5,B00J2G4YRI,I rated this cause I love the show but have a question - I read somewhere the 1987 family reunion movie is on this set as an extra. Is that true? Would anyone who knows be able to let me know?,1501113600,,192,3.707317073170732

8647412,5,B00J2G4YRI,"What can you say about a classic?  Getting to watch the ups and downs of the Bradford family once again is a treat.  Additionally, the quality is 100% great.  If you already have seasons 1-4 don't hesitate in getting season 5; you won't regret it.",1475452800,,247,4.444444444444445

8647415,5,B00J2G4YRI,"I absolutely love this show and I'm super glad that I have Season 5 because there are some gold nuggets here. (The birth of Susan's daughter comes to mind).  However, I think by Season 5, Eight is Enough was beginning to lose it's magic.  The kids were getting too old and the stories didn't hold my interest as much.  I'm glad they cancelled it when they did.  I think a 6th Season would have been too much.",1453852800,,408,4.259740259740259
