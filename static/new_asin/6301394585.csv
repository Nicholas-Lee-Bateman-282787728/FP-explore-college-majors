ALPHA VIDEO (visible under ""Product Details"" distributes VERY poor quality DVDs - maybe even bootlegged!!!! The top of the DVD was printed in water soluble ink!! The movie quality was extremely poor - with scratchy sound, flickering, snowy picture with the color going off in many scenes. My old worn out VHS copy was much better. I reordered this title from a different studio and was then very satisfied.",1479859200,,492,4.732558139534884

7811975,4,6301394585,"My experience with minor brand DVD companies (such as this unnamed plain box one) has been satisfactory, as I'm not interested in commentary, deleted scenes or other bonus features, that is, stuff these discs don't offer. Transfers are ""best available source"" and quality can vary from very good to only fair.

The opening scene in LETTER OF INTRODUCTION (1938) has Andrea Leeds and Edgar Bergen out walking among a New Year's Eve crowd. They reach their theatrical boarding house residence and discover that it's on fire. Other actors (vaudevillians, most likely) pour out of the smoking multi-story brownstone, including a fellow with a trained seal. Bergen rushes upstairs to grab his puppet, Charlie McCarthy but forgets to retrieve an important letter belonging to Leeds, so she dashes inside to get it.

Miss Leeds is overcome by smoke and a man who lives across the street, George Murphy rescues her. She and Murphy are immediately attracted to each other, much to Bergen's dismay and his dummy's delight.

The film stars Adolphe Menjou as an aging leading man who later learns from the introductory letter written by her now-dead mother that Andrea is his daughter. Menjou, who is filled with fatherly affection for Leeds, helps the struggling young actress land a lead role by agreeing to return to the stage and appear with her in a new production. On opening night this former matinee idol gets the jitters, drinks too much and collapses in front of a startled audience. Leeds is angry that he's spoiled her Broadway debut, but all is soon forgiven when her dad is involved in a terrible accident.

Other cast members include Ann Sheriden, Eve Arden and Frank Jenks.

7811977,4,6301394585,"I was looking for anything containing Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy... of the 3 DVD's I found, this was the only one featuring them in a movie setting.  The story is good, and their part in it makes sense.  Plus... when I want to share their antics and comedy with my family, I don't have to worry about language or shady situations.  For the time period this was made, the story line goes along pretty well.  Your emotions will vary, in a healthy way, meant to show the human side of life, and it does so very well.  I almost gave it 5 stars... and perhaps if I watch it again and again, I may well wish I had done so.  This features Charlie more than the other Bergen family members... and when Charlie ""acts on his own"" with no apparent ""help"" from Edgar, it shows that someone was thinking and not just making a movie.  Go ahead, enjoy it for yourself!",1268092800,6,860,4.271604938271605

Often, transfers are not of the highest quality. The movies themselves are unrestored and rarely pristine (but still watchable), extras are non-existent and inclusion of artwork or liner notes varies by manufacturer.

7811980,5,6301394585,"All new ventriloquists need to say a huge thank you to the Edgar Bergan, for creating the mystical world of the talking puppet.
Very bad ventriloquism, (i.e. mouth moving), but so well written, and animated, no one cared.

7811981,4,6301394585,"Letter of Introduction is a comedy drama with a great cast.  Adolphe Menjou (A Star is Born, Pollyanna) plays John Manning, a movie star past his prime.  When his now grown daughter Katy Martin (Andrea Leeds), whom he hasn't met since she was a child, shows up with a letter of introduction a few months after her mother's death, they agree to keep their relationship secret, partly because she wants to prove she can become a successful actress on her own, but primarily to protect his reputation.  Unfortunately his fiancee (Ann Sheridan (Good Sam, King's Row)) and Katy's friends all misunderstand their relationship, a situation fully exploited for dramatic as well as comedic effect.  Katy's romantic interest is played by George Murphy, a popular lead player in his time, appearing with Rondald Reagan in This Is The Army, and later becoming a US Senator from California, paving the way for Reagan and Arnold.  The plot is further complicated by Rita Johnson's (Edison The Man, All Mine To Give) romantic interest in him.  Katy's other friends are Eve Arden (Our Miss Brooks), Edgar Bergen (I Remember Mama), Charlie McCarthy (You Can't Cheat An Honest Man) and Mortimer Snerd (Charlie McCarthy, Detective).  Also,  Ernest Cossart is excellent as Manning's butler Andrew.  During the first half I found the story dragging a bit, at least by modern standards, but more than salvaged by a fair amount of Charlie McCarthy's comedy. However, in the second half the plot builds up dramatically as Manning plans to reveal his daughters identity at the curtain call of their first performance of the play ""Return To Paradise,"" intended to serve both as her debut and his come-back, but possibly driving the last nail into the coffin of his own career .But that's not where it ends.  Recommended for the original story and definitely a must for Bergen / McCarthy fans.",1121126400,,1866,4.951923076923077
7811982,2,6301394585,"It's such a shame that a better source print for this film wasn't used. The picture and sound quality are fine but it is full of splices. My first VHS copy of this movie that I was able to find was originally released in 1987 by United American Video and was wonderful. Hardly any splices anywhere but the sound had some hiss. I found a 2nd VHS copy originally released in 1986 by Viking Video hoping the sound would be better. It was, but it has the identical splices as this new DVD version. It's very disappointing to have the actors lines ruined buy these cuts.

If Alpha Video had done just a little more homework they could have found a better print for this DVD. This title deserves better.",1109980800,13,697,4.361538461538461
