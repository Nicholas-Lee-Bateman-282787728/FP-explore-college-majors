Those parts mostly had to do with grisly autopsy scenes and a fairly graphic sex scene so the plot wasn't too affected, but still there should have been an indication in the advertising.  It probabloy had to do with local Chinese censorship, because my DVD was a Chinese edition.  I managed to obtain a whole copy later, but I felt cheated anyway.  So if that matters to you, get the region-1 DVD that's now available in North America, rather than the 'all-region' one.",1381190400,,635,4.495652173913044
8435874,4,B004MB2768,"I liked this Korean revenge genre film.  It's about the police trying to solve a grisly murder and how the coroner gets caught up in it when his daughter is kidnapped. It keeps you engaged throughout the entire movie and has a very surprising ending that you definitely don't see coming. The acting was not outstanding but it was good and the plot, although having some holes in it, was still somewhat believable. I especially liked the actor who played the environmental activist. It has a lot of suspense. It's not on the same par with Oldboy and the other movies in that Korean revenge trilogy but still definitely worth viewing.",1331337600,,632,4.693693693693693
8435875,5,B004MB2768,Starts off a bit slower than your normal Korean Revenge flick and never really gets as fast paced as others' in the genre. This movie really hits you in the gut. Can't really say much more or it will spoil it. Highly recommend if you enjoy Korean Revenge movies. You know what you are getting into... Excellent movie.,1329523200,,317,4.482758620689655
